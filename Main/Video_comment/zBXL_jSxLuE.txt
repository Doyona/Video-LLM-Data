This makes me miss the 90's so much 😢
RIP Diane Keaton 🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
We loved these movies bc they weren't woke. This was way too woke. Yuck. But rip Diane Keaton. You're a gem.
This was dreadful, i would hate to be the actors having agreed to this dross.
So it's 2025, I finally started watching OMITB, which led me to watching old Steve Martin, watched Father of the Bride and just found out right now that this exists. This was at the very beginning of the pandemic when people were dropping like flies. At first I thought that while this is a cute idea, I was surprised a movie known for being a depiction of an artificially perfect family that almost no one gets to have would be showcased in that moment, when so many families were suffering, losing loved ones, and never had that Banks family perfection to begin with. But these are some of the best actors around and the charm won me over. It says a lot about the acting quality when even a Zoom movie can get the job done. I think I read that the original din't get glowing reviews, but over the years, it has been watched by so many young brides who love their father just like this. I hope these so-called artificial movies continue to be made. It might be remarkable and rare to see a loving and happy family, but they exist, and bless us all.
RIP Diane! U are so loved and missed!
Just finished watching Father of the Bride ❤ RIP Diane, rest well
❤
So deeply sad Diane Keaton passed away. She seemed so healthy and had such spirit and energy. I'm shocked she's gone. I wish we could have had at least another 20 years. ❤
Somehow, Ben Platt feels miscast. 😂
this is really beautifully arranged and setup !!   truly enjoyed watching it !  THANK YOU !! 🥰❤
How did I just find this now!?
❤😂was really great ❤️💝🐶💕🐾💜
Oct. 2025 this is my first for this Delightful Movie ish ⛲️💫🌺 Star  Mom pasted a few weeks ago😢
Love this!!
wow! “3”
Francke 😂😂😂😂😂
Fabulous ❤️  thank you Diane RIP
Wow what a really wonderful mini feature this is, as funny as the 2 magnificent Father Of The Bride Movies both were.   When I heard the sad news about Diane Keaton the Father Of The Bride Movies were the first thing I thought of, they were both greatly funny movies and I enjoy them very much whenever I can catch them especially Steve Martin and the hillarious Martin Short. Well done to all the actors and actresses involved..   R.I.P. Diane Keaton...
AMEN! GREAT 3RD FATHER OF THE BRIDE MOVIE! WE MISS YOU DIANE KEATON 😓 UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN ONE DAY IN HEAVEN...PLEASE KNOW WE ALL LOVE ❤ YOU!!!
JUST watching this for the first time. Great way to connect during this time and a wonderful cause.   Also, loved to see a little bit more of Diane <3
I will miss Diane Keaton so much... Her character of Nina felt like a mom for me, we love you Diane.
FRANCK 😭 Istg anytime I’m down I pull up a video of Franck, it never fails to make me feel better! Do da baby verkout 🤣 Love Martin Short sm!
This father of the bride is fun
? Gasp and floop!
I am just seeing this for the first time October 19, 2025.  Rest in the sweetest peace😇😇😇😇😇😇
In Remembrance to... Diane Keaton role as Nina Banks 🥀 (Born: January 5, 1946 – Died: October 11, 2025) ♥
💜💜💜
What? LOL. ROTFL. 😂😂😂😂
The nephew looked older than the uncle to me. I guess it was the facial hair or something.
😅father of the bride 1 and 2 are one of my favourite  movies   Rest in peace Diane Keaton. Thank you for all the joy you brought to us. .
Seeing this for the first time. It’s great seeing all of them. Rest in peace Diane Keaton. You won’t be forgotten.
Thanks for the memories Diane! The world will not be the same without you!
Diane Keaton, you are missed by millions.  Such a wonderful woman and actress.
And this is why you give people they're flowers before it's too late and why you trigger things before it's too late. Get this cast back together honor the matriarch of this great fictional family and give us one more run please
😢😢😢
*Sadly, Netflix waited too long for a full-length part 3, and now Diane Keaton is gone*
Omg I LOVE THIS!!! I just found out this existed
R.I.P Diane Keaton
R.I.P. Diane Keaton. You will be forever missed, but we will always have your movies. Rest easy beautiful lady.
Of course they had to make this politicaly correct and have Robert de Niro on. Please leave the two original good movies alone.
WATCHING THIS TO SEE HER FACE......RIP DIANE KEATON. I LOVE THIS SONG BECAUSE ON THE MOVIE "FATHER OF THE BRIDE" He did and awesome job singing it.
What a beautiful way to send our love to Diane Keaton. You brought so much joy to so  many of us. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. You'll always be remembered as the special one. You will be forever missed ❤
I Just found this in 2025, one day before Diane Keaton dies. George and Nina forever!! 💔💔
Their youngest daughter was Florence Pugh!!! And their grandson was that guy who played Ed Gein. That cast was amazing….why didn’t the studio do the final part 3.
How did I never hear about this back in 2020??!!???? 😞😩😳 Love it!! Always wished for a Part 3…..sadly this will be all we ever get now! 😭😭😭💔
Remember during lockdown we all went nuts when we saw this!!! It will never happen now 😞
Why didn’t they make the final part 3. 😔😔😔
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Here in 2025, RIP Diane ❤
Where was Bryan?!
This was wonderful!♥️❤
Beautiful smile Diane Keaton had, she  will always be remembered.  RIP Diane Keaton.
I am sad they never got around to making a real Father of the Bride 3 movie. RIP Diane Keaton.
RIP Diane Keaton
Rip Diane Keaton  its never gonna be the same without her 😢❤ this was so beautiful 😢❤ my heart
Why is people making such mean comments about this video & the actors & actresses in this?! I like this video
RIP Diane.
Miss you Diane
RIP 🙏
RIP Diane Keaton! When I first read about your passing on social media, I thought I read it wrong. Even though I wish I did read it wrong, I had to accept that I didn't. Thank you so much for your decades of work. It is a body of work that gives a true master class in acting.
RIP Diane Keaton
🥹🥰Thank you.. that was lovely to see the cast together again.  Like many of us here, one of my fave childhood movies growing up in the 90s.  Steve Martin movies are so wholesome.   Thank you ❤
Father of the Bride movie has ah special feeling to it, no matter how much time you watched it, it just has ah certain feeling❤❤
❤❤❤😂😂😂. I wish they would have shown Rachel Mom 😭!!!
Anyone want a part 4 a full one?
It's been five years. Can they make that movie now? 😊
Como só descobri isso agora? ❤
I kinda wish they had made this into a real movie. I mean, Martin & Short and De Niro together, is my everything!!
Was it aired in netflix?
Watching this for the first time in 2025 and looking back to 2020 all I can say is that was the stupidest thing I’ve ever watched and the biggest waste of 25 minutes and 31 seconds. Holly weird was so paranoid about a silly cold virus
Omg it was SO CUTE how Matty kept looking at Rachel❤❤❤ so well done!
Man just found out about it after watching the good half (dont watch it), something good at least. Good job everyone 👍
This is awesome!!!!!!!❤. Definitely need part three!!!!!
I want another full movie! I can already see the storyline in my head!
This was beautiful 🥹
Still waiting on The full movie
Never seen a father of bride movie until watching this but now i want to watch the other two
This is too stupid, I can't watch it.  Hollywood pushed the pļ@ndemic @gend@, so badly. 😠
😢❤😢
I wish they had done a movie. You basically had the script right there. Matti getting married.
Time to do a proper number 3 with baby Megan getting married
Make that Moment a Movie♥️♥️♥️♥️
This COVID insanity is giving me PTSD 5 years later. I can't believe people would wear masks in their houses alone.
This would be a perfect movie if it was made! Fun cast!❤
Loooooooooveeeeeee it. love love love it.
Please another movie😢
4 years on and still no full length movie 😢
It made me nostalgic..I love this movie❤️❤️
Why havent they made it😒
I like how George said to de niro welcome to the family, that shows no matter what, when your kids marry the parents become in laws to each other.
How about father of the bridegroom????
I need a full movie of Matthew and Rachel Gets Married: Father of the Bride (in this case Groom) 3 (And maybe Megan going to prom backstory)
Love this! Tho it's weird that Matthew looks younger than George Jr considering Matthew is George Jr's uncle. Still.. whooo love this covid time plot❤❤❤
Ugh, 🫀!
I stopped watching when they started with the woke nonsense. Bye!
It’s been 4 years. Please give us a FOB Pt 3
I love love love this movie my number 1 movie i love to watch and still watch tell this day ❤❤
Now we need a full father of the bride part 3
It’s nice
❤❤❤ Oh Wow ❤❤
This is the best movie, ever❤
No movies can make me feel so warm, fuzzy, and like everything will be ok as these movies.
Its 2025 and I have Covid again. Working from home and crying. Please please make this. Have Frank and his husband renew vows or marry and them all on vacation.
Steve Martin is also a talented musician. He is such a pure soul! Love him and Martin Short so much.
Please make this full movie. Watched both again.
This was just adorable 🥹
Diane Keaton never ages 😅
Is Robert using the meet the parents house sure looks like it
Make this with out the Covid stuff
When does this come out
Why is Yelena in this lol
The ending I longed for.  Seeing everyone again, and the two babies all grown up. ❤❤❤
Loving this but almost all of their backgrounds look obviously fake.  Like you can tell some of them used a green screen.
Can we get a mainstream 4th part plz😢  Please Nancy make more movies!!!❤❤
😢😢😢
Pandemic stuff doesn’t age well 🤣
So what age are they in 2025?
Father of the bride 3 ish no make the real deal
I have watched one and two so many times. I always wanted part three to be Annie and Bryan had a daughter a few years after George and now Bryan is going through what George Banks did when they got married. Gorge has the feels about being the grandpa to the bride and he and Bryan have heart to heart about he now understands what George went through emotionally when it he married Annie and even showing Annie and Nina talking about their feels. This was AMAZING and I loved this for sure. I hope a continuation movie can happen, even if it is never the idea I always hoped for. I love this family
PLEASE give me  Part 3 DVD immediately
I watch Parts 1&2 all the time & need a Part 3 with the Original Cast PLEASE
Почему нет русского перевода 🥲🥲🥲я посмотрела ни слова не понимая)))но это так интересно🤩
Ok I was watching FOB on tv and looked up some characters and this came up. I loved this. Please  make pt3
Robert DeNiro likes this son-in-law a lot more than Focker!
Now the actual wedding needs to happen ❤
Steve Martin doesn’t age 😂
How am I only finding this now? It's so creative and beautiful ❤❤
2025 and this hasn’t came  out as an actual full length movie
Oof pandemic cringe.
I just became aware of this now. This was so heartwarming. Bring on the full length film, we still need it!
Horrible
LITERALLY THE BEST IVE EVER SEEN!!!
Cringe
Brilliant film so funny . Steve Martin is a scream . Well done  all 😊
I just found out now about this, it brought so much memories. Loved it ❤
This f'ing sucks.
On brand for RD too
This is so cute!
Just watching this in November of 2024 thinking this it was a trailer for movie Father of the Bride Part 3 which will be out this month! Love it!❤
This was so great!!
I love the father of the bride movies. I was so excited when I found out about the father of the bride 3
Now that we know what a farce the lockdowns and the masks were this is hard to watch. And that's a shame because this looks so cute and I love these characters!
It’s almost 2025 and I’m just seeing this for the first time. It’s so sweet!!
I love this version of this Canon D pachella  - which is it.?
This was the stupidest thing I have ever seen in my life 😭 I’m so sad I was looking forward to this movie
Such a reunion special sorry even though they are in character still feels more like a reunion special
They need to make a part III!!!
I think they should do a real “father of the bride part three” and have it be Megan getting married and it could be called Father of the bride… Again. and maybe Mattie and Rachel could have a little girl who could be the flower girl.
I NEED ANOTHER ONE PLSSSSSSSSS
Assistindo em 2024 pela milésima vez.  Meu filme do coração!   Queremos a parte 3.
could totally do a part 3 with the birthday twins getting married, or at least megan, it could be called, "father of the 2nd bride" megan is around the right age, though a little older than her sister getting married, but its not bad getting married at 30
I think we need to wholesome movies again like this one, and yes a part 3 would be nice
Love this
I just found this and I am so friggin happy!!! Legit cried.  If a movie is made I will be there.
I love this! ❤
I watch this every now and then. And I love it more and more
I love movies that aren’t based on reality since I live it daily. An escape would have been nice.
Part 3 please!!!  It has to happen.
This is nice the youngest boy is a doll. Will be hard not to google him probably a lot younger than me age what the heck is a pulp exhibitor it’s funny bc Steve reminds me mom a little bit…is that Robert DINORO?  But really this is good enough for me they don’t need a movie.
I like how everyone is super close, especially the siblings despsite the age gap
This was heartwarming. Thank you everyone.
Can they please make a fourth one
Father of the Bride 1991 and 1995 are my absolute comfort films. I just feel so relaxed with the music, the house, the slice of life theme.
Not me ugly crying at this in 2024 at 3:00 in the morning 🥺 this was so heartwarming!
make a forth one!!!!!
This is sad. I was looking forward to not a pandemic commercial, but an actual sequel me and my family didn’t social distance and none of us got Covid /the flu which is what it really was this is sad. They turned a classic comedy into a Covid commercial by the World Health Organization.
*I really hope we get a real Part 3 one day... part 1 and 2 are such amazing 90s comfort movies*
I didn't even know they did this till now and honestly I'm glad cause i missed the cast and loved every second of it.
Fantastic 👏👏👏
I must say, it was heartwarming......THE PART OF THIS SHORT FILM,  I COULD ACTUALLY HEAR !    I DID NOT HEAR, THE NUPTIALS, THE FRANK"( FRUNK)  CEREMONY, NOR ANY OF THE  BANKS,  FAMILY MEMBERS; THROUGHOUT,  THE ENTIRE PART 3  .  I WOULD GUESS,  I ENJOYED 10 MINUTES, ....HERE,  AND THERE,  ....NO SOUND,  IN THE BEGINNING, THE MIDDLE, NOR, THE LAST SONG.,.....ONLY THE LAST,  OF WORDS,  OF THE SONG  !   HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING, TO SEE THIS BEAUTIFUL,  FAMILY,...ALL TOGETHER,  FOR " MADDIE'S WEDDING"!!!!   ....  I FEEL CHEATED !!!  I LOVED,  FATHER OF THE BRIDE, PLUS #2.,  ...AND MISSED,  ALMOST, ( 10 minutes here and there, never in sequence) ALL OF # 3,   !!!!!!   PLEASE, MAKE CERTAIN,  THE .......S O U N D,    ......IS WORKING, PLEASE,  ?????????????????????   Disappointed, artchem1
So glad covid is over and we can interact normally again instead of this zoom crap
U have left me doo happy and speechless thanku
Yes part 3 will be amazing ❤ I grew up watching this movie
Watching part 2… again!!! And just wondering about what others thought about it as I love both films only to find on Reddit a link to this!!!💜
How did I not know about this?? It’s so good!!
This made my day! I just found it ❤ Why not another full movie?! 😍
I was just a baby when this came out
I wish there will be a full length of megan's wedding! We need part 4! I love watching Father of the Bride 1 and 2...I grew up watching this film and it is my favorite movie ever! I never get tired of watching the Banks Family! ❤❤❤
I’m here in 2024 after binge watching Parts 1 & 2
This felt like coming to a family reunion.
Ok now i want a full sequel. I loved this movies as a kid!
I just found this (after a search for Kimberly Williams-Paisley) and I didn't expect to cry! Loved both of the original movies and would love to see a third full length film. I enjoy watching Martin and Steve on Only Murders in the Building. The cast members have all aged well. A great way to celebrate and raise money during a very strange and tough time in history!
Really?! Using this beautiful movie to spread lies and misinformation about the lies about covid. Disgusting
I only watched this because of Florence Pugh :)
wow annie has not aged!!!
September 25 is my wedding anniversary 🥰😍10  years to day this movie premieres on youtube ! I love it!
Franc, my favorite character ❤ but ruined it when you added Denado to it. Why of all actors did you add opionated,  no nothing, bad mouth to this movie. Shame, so many better actors who keep politics out of their mouths.
When does father of the bride come out on Netflix part 3
2024.  See how silly it all was.  I thought the lockdowns were stupid four years ago and this reminds me of why:  it unnecessarily kept families apart!    It was still wonderful to see the cast back together along with that beautiful theme music.
can we have this movieee
I was just saying Matty should get married, why isn’t this a fully movie I’m seriously mad. 🥹
Martin Short, I love him, this whole cast is perfect. 🥹
Matty is all grown up 🥹❤️
I cannot watch this nonsense.  I know it's supposed to be funny, and it is, sort of, but it's also just more sick propaganda
As far as zooms are concerned, first one I've ever appreciated. As for the story, probably the most charming thing I've ever seen on screen. Another vote for FOTB pt 3.
I love all there films ,please do a full length film .
I’m just going to say it… The PC of this kills the comedy.
Robert De Niro ruined this for me. Have to stop watching because I can't stand him.
So I guess the full feature will be called "father of the bride continues"
That was . . . unnecessary and not very good. Oh well, the first two movies will always be a great reminder of how awesome it was to be a well-to-do family in the 90’s before the internet set humanity on a collision course with doom.
Jesus Christ saves ❤
Democrats celebrating the pandemic!! 😂
Don't like the girl playing Meghan...yuck!
I own "Father of the Bride"1 & 2 and I have watched them both over 50 times since 1992. I, actually, was sewing my self designed wedding gown while I watched and listened to them.  I also bought the soundtrack and walked down the aisle to "Snow Scene".....my 3 Bridesmaids, then myself as the music slightly changed.  It came out perfectly.   I have worn out that CD as dozens of friends and family walked down the aisle using that same instrumental song, in their weddings.   I still cry during those movies. But they are sweet memory tears...😢 I can't believe it's been 32 years since the release of "Father of the Bride."   I had a Christmas wedding 1992..... (saves money on decorations in the Church as they decorate the Church for Christmas.....thus, I only had to buy the bridal party flowers....even the Candelabras were already at the altar....😊 Thank you for this sweet reunion of the cast, with Robert DeNiro added....awesome!❤
So cool!!! 🎉🎉🎉
This was amazing! Love it!!
Oh my gosh I absolutely loved this,brought tears to my eyes!
My favorite movies ever!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
Omg!!! Full length please!!!!!????
I'm so late, how did I not know this was around.
Well that was disappointing
please correct me if im wrong...is it a lock down episode???
What a movie and cast
I just found this in 2024, and my heart is so warm watching this. For a moment I thought to myself this didn’t feel like the movies without George’s commentary and then when it finally came I started crying. Though I don’t care for Covid dated shows or movies I  loved this!
Why is steve martin not making movies anymore? 🤔😪 I love the great actor he is!
I haven’t watched the first and 2nd Father of the bride movies in a long time. I have both copies
I loved it until that robert dinero became a part of the show, can't stomach him
R.I.P To the poor souls who were killed trying to serve humanity!
Part 3 please!!!
I love the first two movies. But the Steve Martin whining and anxiety after a while, you just want to tell him to shut up.
MAKE A 3!!!!!!!!! On matty and Megan !!! I’m so glad this snippet focused on Matty. He deserves it ❤
THIS IS SOOOOOO CHEESY.
Seriously excellent part 3
Not me discovering this in 2024 😮😂❤
My biggest love! To me “Father of the bride” is not just my favorite movie ever but also an example of perfect family relationship, lifestyle and love. I even built the same house they have in the movie this is how big of the fan I am ❤
This made me laugh and cry wish they would make father of the bride 3😂😊
I loved all 3 movies still keep watching them. I hope they keep on with more to watch .
Based on everything we now know about the scamdemic, this didn't age well from that perspective. 😂  But since all of us love the FOTB movies, I do appreciate them doing this and all being in character. It was cool to get a continuation of some kind.
Love Robert De Niro, but Eugene Levy should've been the father of the bride in this one.
I would love to know how many thumbs down this received...
Maybe George and  Megan have a double wedding
This was so good I wish we could get a 3rd movie. Great cast and amazing chemistry and Martin short is still amazing as frank
George is still EXTRA😂😂😂😂
Can we PLEASE have a part 3 movie??!!! It could be Megan getting married and call it "Father of the Bride Again"
Who is still watching in 2024?
How meghan Markle of them to have a inter racial wedding
Did they REALLY think they needed to make semi-Seinfeld music to make STEVE FRICKEN MARTIN more funny? Come on Netflix, you're better than that.
I wish they would have made it so Annie and Bryan had more kids.
Matty looks younger than Annie’s son, Georgie!
I didn’t know about this until today. And omg this was amazing! ❤
Highly unlikely the father could organise for the ring to be in the hotel desk, FAKE NEWS
too much adr
I need this movie to happen with Florence getting married ❤❤
I👏need👏more👏Ben👏Platt👏
Nina actually looks so much like Neena Gupta
Just watched the 2 films. 3 this needs to happen
Cousin Fuller grew up to marry Storm ☺
almost 4 years late to know about this, we all definitely need a part 3 movie!
This is one of the most cringe thing ive stumbled upon.
Omg ..3 years later and I’m only just finding out about this..they need to do a 3rd film properly
What?!
it will be vulgar. so no thanks.  no more creativity to make nothing better now
I love this
Ok it's 3 years later and the world has done and opened back up...we need a full Father of the Bride Part 3 movie 😌
Father of the bride Part 3 should be part about Megan getting married
Beautiful
But the baby girl wasn't really Florence Pugh? And the baby boy wasn't really the bearded Millenial?
It took me a while to recognize Ben Platt. Him singing and  Frank were the only parts I really liked but the rest was okay.
Just saw this for first time,how wonderful, we made it through and this would have been great during how did it fair? And please a real full 3 great acting everyone looks amazing
They should do father of the bride 3 where their grandkids get married and get pregnant!!
This is absolutely brilliant. Great writing. Flawless virtual acting. Has all the magic of the movies. It would make a great 3rd installment. It would be better than 90% of the stuff in Netflix.
Too good 👏
The accent was always ridiculous
They should definitely make this 🎉🎉
How wonderful......💝
Omg I needed this I got so excited when Franck popped up❤
Very sweet.❤❤❤
I need the part 3 complete!! Please! Lovely movies👌🏽🤗
World
He looks like the guy from boy meets
They should make a third one with the same people
Great movie
this just made my night i am going through a bit of a rough time and this was great to see now they need to take the 3 (ish) and make a full length part 3 like someone posted already i must tap into online resources and see if anything pops up on a possible full length part 3
Wholesome ❤😭
I know some here. How did I not know about this movie? What? And also where can I watch it? Cuz I seen the first two and now that I know that there's a third one like holy crap. I'm excited now and I'm a huge fan of the whole cast. And the first two movies I'm like beyond huge fan. And also can anybody tell me where I can watch it? That would be great, thanks!❤
I’m only 30 but these movies were my favorite growing up.
❤❤❤ 3 yrs late to this party but omg i wish they would make a 3rd movie... Fyi all cast members look fabulous
2023..post pandemic..we are waiting for the full length movie❤️😊. Fan from the Philippines 🇵🇭
watching it in 2023!!! why I am late in everything? this is too good. 25 min of pure emotions(happy).
We need a full length film & it could be the Banks Family dealing with George's retirement & Maddie's wedding done by Frank.
I now wanna see Robert De Niro, Steve Martin and Martin Short do a comedy together
The zoom though 😂😂😂❤❤❤
WOW I was just scrolling through YouTube and found this. Cool. I love it ❤. And Megan is all grown up also. I can't remember her real name but she was in the movie Black Widow. She was Nat's little sister. I'd love to see a part 3. Come on out with it. Please. You've come this far. Thanks. ❤
Where can u watch it
Would love to see a third one I hope they do make a third one loved this 😊
I just found this....i love both 1 & 2 definitely need a 3 ❤
❣ i still want a full part 3😩  An 4  Qn 5 An 6 An 7....i love this Family!!!
perfect ending.
it was great when Steve referenced it on Only Murders in The Building
Waiting for part 4 loving this 🎉❤❤
How had this not been made into a movie???? This would look amazing as another addition to the series!  Nancy Meyers GET ON IT!!!!!
How am i now knowing abt this in September 2023😮 i love it 🔥🔥
I love Father of the Bride  and I can watch it over and over and over....never gets old....😍😍😍
love it
Glad I never listened to the narrative.  Never quarantined, social distanced and kept life normal as possible and we all came through very well.
How did I miss this 😢😢
Covid cultists
I love this. We need father of the bride part 4
Is this just a preview of a film or is this it? Pretty boring if its 25 min long. Loved the 1st two films
Please make part 3 full length movie
Will ever be father of bride 4 later once this crazy virus or pandemic or variant names disease ever go away .
👑😍😭📖Love This Guys🙏🕊
Give us the 3rd sequel!  We miss the banks fam!
Hands-down stupidest movie I have ever seen in my life. What a waste of time are you freaking kidding me like we really need the freaking pandemic rubbed in our faces.. not funny! People have PTSD due to all of this. The ramifications from this are going to be for a decade or longer stupid just stupid and it figures that every cast member here to date in September 2023 is far left, etc..FIGURES! STUPID!
Lord why did this make me cry lol,  and I just found out this existed. Love love love it. I really wish they would make another Father of The Bride movie🥰🥰🥰
Lovely to catch up love this family movie we definately need part 3 sequel please 💕💕💕💕😊
I just found this beautiful jewel! Loved and needed this today! Please donate!! Love and prayers for the world!! God bless..
I had no idea they make this special  great idea one of my favorite movie I cry everytime I see it . Beautiful Thank you to all the cast .
I just found out about this and I loved it. I want to see of Father  the Bride part 3.
This is crazy!!!!! Oh my God!!!!! Why do i feel like im with family and we haven't seen each other in years? What are we the Shmoltz family?!🤗💜🙌🏻💜. This was awesome!!! Thank you thank you thank you for this. Yaaaaay! 🤗❤🤍❤️
This was GREAT!! Thank you 😘❤️I love the father of the bride !
GREAT! The first scene is a commercial for COVID! Come on y'all! 🙄
I am so ready for Part 3 Movie!!
So good 👍👍
That was awesome
I am still a fan in 2023 ❤❤❤❤
I wish they made this a film... I've loved both of the films before this small or mini film that it is, it's so nice to see the actors all grown up, it doesn't get boring how many times you watch them, I much prefer 80s and 90s film's, I've always liked Steve and Diane working well with eachother, it's a lovely family film...fingers crossed this will have reminded other people of the good old days of Steve Martin,Diane Keaton... please make this into a feature film... I'd buy it..🙏💯🍒😁😁😸😸💕
It proves I get emotional even over Zoom!
Just came across this now. Oh my God, you just made me cry. Literally. This film was one of our bonding movies (my brother and I). We watched both 1 and 2 when it came out here in the Philippines in the 90s. It was even one of the inspirations in my brother's first wedding. Sadly, my brother passed in 2013. This video coming across my account seemed like a sign that he is watching over me as I miss him every day since he passed. 10 years since, I still grieve. This was something to remember him by. So thank you for this. Thank you very much.
I love this, one of my all time favourites ❤ they need to make a movie length of this …….. please xxxx
I can't believe I missed this little gem back then! How fun! Always loved these movies :)
How did I just find this and not know of it until now?   ❤❤❤❤
Love this!  I was about 6 years old when this movie came out and we watched it all the time. How fun watching this little sequel.
These are my favorite movies, I loved them
I love, love, love this. Nancy Meyers, make more MOVIES PLEASE ❤❤
THAT WAS FLORENCE OHMYGOODNESS
♥️
I've just watched this in 2023. Wow, I loved this so much. I wish my Mum was here to watch this. She loved these movies ❤ I wasn't expecting Frunk to make an appearance but he is always so funny. We need a full length movie though.
I am a 61 year old fan of this movie 1 and 2. Ironically, I just watched part two last night and to see this pop up on my feed   just took me back. I mean it's like seeing your family  members after being gone a while. I'm In tears😂,but tears of joy. In such a world of not knowing  this here was a great consistent. Thanks and I hope there is more to come. Thank you ❤
The fact that they did this still makes me happy🥰
I just stumbled onto this after watching Father of the bride 2. So happy i did. So much fun.
Beautiful!
Loved it,
Wow, I never saw it is definitely in the father of the bride three
I cried with happiness almost the whole movie.  Favorite movies ever!!! Love them and they all look amazing!  They could do 5 more movies and I would be thrilled! I love Steve Martin and Diane Keaton.  And all the actors were amazing in this!  It shows how much they can act when they can portray a whole movie through zoom.  Please, please keep the movies and jokes going! We all need Martin Short's character to live on in these movies! How can everyone look even better than they ever did before?  They are really turning back the clocks! I would love to see Steve Martin deal with another wedding and pregnancy.  Great music! Love you guys!
❤❤❤
HEY FOLKS, IT'S NOW THE END OF 2023... STILL THINK THIS IS CUTE? OR DO YOU GET IT NOW...  THEY LIED TO YOU *ALL*
These movies have a very special place in my heart. I love the Banks family. ❤
ELISa
Why am I crying? Loved these movies as a kid 😭💜💜💜
Thank goodness that the Coronavirus pandemic is over
This was absolutely brilliantly done, it was so nice to see the cast again, the spirit of the original 2 movies is so much still there this part 3 has only confirmed it. Please make this into a full part 3 film we have all been waiting so long for this. This mini episode has only reinforced what the fan want. Please commission this into a film.
Steve Martin Is A Legend
My favorite movie family ever.
I'd love to see matty have a kid and meghan get married
I'd love if this happened
Ummmmmmmm.......ok then.
Jusy make the dam film
How could I have gone THREE LONG YEARS without knowing about this sequel? I loved the first 2 films and I absolutely freaked when I heard of this. And I absolutely loved it too, High on the scale of 1 to OMG! 😁
I wish they’d do a full length version. I loved the original 2 so much. They’re so cozy and heartwarming.
This was far more special and tearjerking than it had any right to be. Such incredible talent and very wonderful trip down memory lane. One of the few chick-flicky films that I loved as a young boy! Thank you, gang for making this happen. 🙏💙
Love FOTB. But this acting is so cringe
This was fantastic until DeNiro showed up 🤦
Omfg this is amazing I wish the short film was in German
"Hey, uh Rach. Iiiiiii have a question for you." That way he says that line is so much how Kieran would have said that in his tv show 'Succession' as his character Roman Roy in that. I bet that's a Kieran trait of his
As someone who’s dad is basically George Banks haha and who grew up watching Father of the Bride 1 and 2 this just warms my heart!!!!!
I watch the Father of the Bride movies at least once a year, and I have included this for the last 3 years as well.  I know that Steve Martin announced his retirement a while back, but I wish he and the other cast members (new and old) would consider doing a feature-length movie.  Maybe it could be a triple wedding. An official wedding for Matt and his bride Rachel as well as Megan and George M.  I think there could be so much potential in a third film, and I'm 100% sure that people would want to see it.  If not in theaters, at least on streaming.  We just want a physical copy of these for home media as well, lol.  If anyone is listening, take this into consideration, please! 😊
My favorite movie for all times 💖
Please make full lenght part 3
I LOVE THIS AND ALL OF YOU 🎉❤ 😭
Wow! I always cry seeing how the feelings to the daughter from the father are expresed during the movies because I have a daughter and I feel indentified. I just to cry again now for the feelings to the son, I have a son too jajaja.
Didn’t know this existed! I needed this. And smiling from ear to ear, the music and memories omg. My favorite movie of all time❤️
This hits different after Succession.
When n Why did people stop making movies like this..which are homely soft tones and soo soothing..u can watch them anytime of the day, decade or century.. I miss d 90s.. 😢 and d beauty n grace and sunny lawns and relaxing setting sun's and peaceful family gatherings...
Thank you, Reese, Diane, Steve, Martin et al… as soon as I have $ I will donate!
Lovely....thank you..thank you for reminding us to donate.  ❤😊
LOVE FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART 3 SUE!
Wow! I just discovered this. So great! Thank you and yes part 3 for real please!
When Franc is reading the vows, you can see he’s actually holding the whole script for this.
How did I not know about this??? I literally just found this out!! This was the feel good moment I needed!! To hear the theme music come on and to see all these faces that I practically grew up with just warmed my heart!! Thank you Banks family for doing it all over again!! Thank you all for coming together and making it as special as ot was 25 years ago!!
I have to save this is incredible acting, especially for people who are not in the same room as each other
Omg this is nothing like the first two movies and who the hell is rachel
COVID has been over for almost 2 years and the jokes in this piece still feel painful.
Wish they would make another father of the bride movie, this time Meghan getting married.
I honestly liked father of the bride 👰‍♂️ 2
I’m definitely getting teary eyed watching this. ❤
I’ve watched this at least 400 times. I’m not typically one for sequels, but I hope we get a part 3 for this special family 🥺
Oh my. This was amazing!!! And the actors for Maddie and Georgie were awesome too!
I loved this film, although short, it is a continuation of the "Father of the Bride" films and has the essence of the previous ones.  I wish they would do another one but including in the plot the first baby of Mattew and Rachel and Megan's engagement and wedding would be fun because we know how crazy George goes when his daughters get married.  It would be a nice way to close the Saga without losing its style that we all liked about these films
How did I not know this existed! After watching the original movies earlier today, I came across this online. This part 3 ish was a nice touch but man, we need a full length part 3 too! 💙
Father of the Bride 1 and 2 were both equally great, but "Father of the Bride 3-ish"?? I guess most US filmmakers simply DON'T KNOW WHEN TO QUIT, do they?
Wish they'd do a 4 now with Megans wedding!
This was really boring.
Frank is the OG lol always making things fabulous
Forget the zoom wedding, we need a real wedding 🥰🥰
We need a part 3 ❤❤❤ please
Moster and Mosses Bonks(as spoken by Franc Eggelhoffer),X 2. George,Nina,Matthew and his bride.
We need a part 4 from father of the bride, when Rachel and Annie get pregnant together along with their husbands, Matty and Mike, the same way like Nina and Annie except Annie already has George, but she gets pregnant again after 25 yrs! 😆😆😆👍👍👍😁😁❤️
Hey, I've seen De Niro as the father of the bride before
Steve's reaction when he saw marty as Frank- so adoreable and wholesome. 😮💖
As a big fan of FOTB, I cried. The love is incredible!
When's number 3 blu ray and dvd gonna be out of number 3 movie dying for it
Love ya Frank💯❣❣❣💯
Maddy still looks the same hahaha awesome movie for the family love the two wedding n baby shower planners too funny💯❣❣💯🤣🤣🤣
Defenetly need a pt 3 that will be Wonderful omg this is one of m favorite movies still keep watching it🤣🤣💯❣❣❣💯
Cool black girl. NOT!
Now we need a cheaper by the dozen part 3 (ish) lol
Wow watching this shows how paranoid some people were and still are. ( talking about George).
*crying*
Congratulations keiren I didn't know you were related to the home Alone boy and I love Martin Short I saw jungle to Jungle and the Santa Clause 3 the Escape Clause with you and Tim Allen
And I Especially love Kimberly for merrying a Country Singer AKA a freaking killer Guitarest
I freakin Love you Steve
Have to double comment 30 mins in. How beautiful is this? Thank you to the cast. This beautiful nostalgia eases so many of my fears. Beautiful film.
So beautiful and nostalgic. This film embodies everything I want in life.
I m a fan of all the Father of the Bride Movies and also the home alone movies and I saw Kimberly Williams on the 1st Father of the Bride then I saw her on the 2nd one and according to Jim and the Christmas Chronicles 1 and 2 I saw the last name paisley I'm like wait she's married to brad Paisley no way
Who donated?
I loved the original movies and casts, but this sucked. I turned it off halfway. And don't get me started on the political correctness BS. 🙄
I had NO idea the the babies in FOTB2 were Ben Platt and Florence Pugh. This was awesome and nostalgic. Such a Pandemic thing. I’m two years late to the party but better late than never. 😊
netflix pls im begging u for the full version
I am a HUGE fan of FOTB1 & 2, but this felt like a huge miss for me. No hate, but huge cringe fest for me. But you all are welcome to like it.
I’m definitely 2yrs late but we need a full film! Nexflix, Hulu, HBO Max, Movie theaters! Idc but I need a full film! Nina and George 2nd wedding, Matty becomes a Dad, Megan is getting married…SOMETHING! And now I expect to see Mr. De Niro!
Ik I’m 2 years late but after watching this we NEED a part 3 ASAP😂
Why am I just learning about this? Please turn this into a real movie.
I am so late… I love this
This reminds me of a bad corporate training video
That was beautiful
smh they got rid of all of Franck's gay
Wow, how worried we were of covid at that time. Now it seems like covid disappeared
Just watched part 1 and part 2 with my 8 y o daughter. Now we’re watch g part 3
So bad
And my sis was saying we needed father of the groom with some melanin. Instead, they made that other movie.
I just love this. I Loved the Father of The Bride movies.❤️❤️
I just learned of this today. I've loved this series since I was a child. What a lovely reunion and continuation of the story. Thanks!
LOL "I only send a thousand???" Good the script was SO GOOD  The backgrounds, the quality of the video, sound, lighting. Editing was tops  Thank you guys!
They lost me with this 2020 craziness version.
It looks so strange and not typically but despite this I'm glad to see them! Thank you all of you! I really like this movie and it's one of my favourite!
We need a full length movie..netflix please make this happen
Amazing. Enjoyed watching so very much!
That was really cute!  But there is still a daughter left?  Many blessings and love to all of you! 🥰
I just watched the first 2 movies, I hope you guys are going to film a 3rd!!! Such great movies!!!
Love it
I'm 2 years late to this but I would 100% watch a feature length Part 3. This got me right in the feels - laughs and cries.
This was not bad.  Not great but glad to see the banks family again and fraunk.   This reflects on how during covid we all had to be flexible.  Moral nothing is perfect just make the best if it and be flexible.
We need the full part 3 movie. I love the characters.
Loved it!!💖💖
I just watched Part 1 and 2 and this is one of my favorite movie series of all time!!!
god this makes me wish they would make a part 3 i've always wondered why they haven't. that remake that came out is ok but still make a part 3 .
You're playing with my emotions 😭😭😭
Why the hell did they have to stick that smug Florence Puke into this reunion??
Father of the Bride 3 please!
Unbelievably well played...well played.
Where Florence and Ben really the babies? I LOVE THAT IF SO
We need a real 3 with this cast, maybe Megan getting married?! I'd love to see it!!
good congratulations   Family
hi Annie how is your baby boy  is doing
Wow, how come I never knew about this until now!? I watched FotBII yesterday and then came across this video. Loved these movies growing up!. This was so, so good!. This cast is a match made in heaven...We really need a 3rd full-length movie. Please Netflix, or Disney or whoever owns the rights, stop investing your money in bad movies and make us a 3rd full-length movie of this sequel!
I loved this! Netflix please make it happen. We need The Father of the Bride 3!!
This was wonderful! And captured the feeling of the original and sequel.
Boy, Ben Platt is a great singer
Is there any way we can donate towards production of a new movie??
I grew up watching Father of the Bride and Father of the Bride Part 2. They were both some of my absolute favorite movies. I always dreamed of having a wedding and a house like the ones in the movie. My husband and I were supposed to get married on 6/13/2020. In the end, that obviously didn't happen. But, like Matty, I decided that after 9 years together and in the middle of some of the scariest times we'd faced, I didn't want to wait any longer. We got married via Zoom in our living room while my parents watched outside the doorway so that we could be safe. We ate cake on our deck and had dinner delivered to our small studio apartment (a fraction of the size of the Banks' home). I've always felt a little sad when I've thought about not having the wedding (although next year we will be having a small vow renewal celebration). But watching this, two years late, I started to cry. Thank you so much for this beautiful short. To know that, in a strange twist of fate, I actually did get married Father of the Bride style brought me so much joy. Thank you for reminding me that it is the people and the love shared between them that makes the Banks family worth aspiring to, not simply where or how you celebrate it.
I need this as a full length movie!!
I'm still crying!!
This is soooooooo bad...
Totally genius and beautiful. Steve Martin is a master.
I googled the cast of the 1st movie because I grew up loving it and only just found this. This is awesome!
i rly appreciate this so much but the covid references where just to cringe for me and off putting. thank you for making this  <3
De Niro is great in this, nice to see him act again.
This is a dream come true. I want a number 3 so very badly!!!
I'm sorry, but I'm still salty about the fact that THAT house cost less than Annie's wedding!
Pure propaganda.
Why the hell would they make a joke of it like this? I’ve been waiting for an actual sequel for years and then you’re gonna make some zoom call nonsense about it and make it about the plandemic? That’s outrageous
AHHH me emocione ver a todos
Love this movie!  🥰🥰🥰
This just had me in tears 😭🥺🥰 I really hope they make a 3rd movie !
Ojala que haya una pelicula completa!!! le dieran continuación a esta hermosa mini pelicula :)
I had no idea they made this until reading about it in People magazine this week! Such a fun trip down memory lane. I always enjoyed these movies
I thought Matty is gay?
Steve Martin is hysterical. I love the part where everyone thought he froze.
I wish they'd make a part 3. Loved this growing up. The new father of the bride on hbo was horrible...
We want part 4!
I just rewatched The Holiday and was looking through Nancy Meyers’ IMDb and JUST discovered this. So cool to see the original peeps and the new additions were perfect. A full length feature now would be wonderful to accompany this short. Either way I really hope that Nancy makes some more movies!
Want a real reboot !!! Please!!!
They should have a part full 3, 4, 5 &6 Excellent acting and good feel movie ❤💕
Today is June 20, 2022.....lve just discovered part 3.....Bravo
Nancy Meyers is always so posh that even their zoom account is premium. 🤣
Love it thanks for sharing
*Father of the Bride (franchise)* ◾ Father of the Bride - (June 16, 1950) ◾ Father's Little Dividend  - (April 27, 1951) ◾ Father of the Bride - (December 20, 1991) ◾ Father of the Bride, Part 2 - (December 8, 1995) ◾ Father of the Bride, Part 3 (ish) - (September 25, 2020) ◾ Father of the Bride - (June 16, 2022)
I always wished we could've gotten a 3rd Father of the Bride with the 1991 cast. Wonderful movie & so good to have seen them in the 3rdish.
Why did I not know about this???
Awe 😭😭💜💜💜💜💜
Yess I love this 😀 😍  One of my favorite movies 🎬
This is the coolest idea ever:-)))
That clarinet background sound is so nostalgic.
Can't believe you YouTube hasn't dropped this into my feed before this. Wonderful!!!!! We definitely need a full length version of this...all those wonderful characters😊😂❤️
This warms my heart so much 💓
Are Brian and Annie still together in this?
OMG THIS WAS AMAZING, AWESOME, SWEET, AND SO MANY MORE THINGS! MAKE THIS PART 3 PLEASE!
diane Keaton is still so gorgeous lady :)
… SOBBING 😭
This should be made a real movie part 3 please
I love both movies! I wish they made this movie when the babies were still growing up!
Just saw this? It would’ve been better if Eugene Levy sang again. Where is BD Wong? 🥺 so many missed opportunities.
I love it  it’s very funny he is the best ever yes I rekey there should be a3th movie
I think it's super cute that Megan calls George her birth twin.
I am an Indian and I didn't found Father of the Bride 3 (ish), so I had to watch it in YouTube
so many comments on here talking about how amazing this is, but its really not...... its even worse by dating it in 2020 cause covid... its cheesy in a way thats not fun to watch. The other movies were charming with cheese there is no Charm in this at all.
Just as I was thinking how great it would be for Franck to officiate.. "Halloooooo!!!!!!"
Still, left me some tears 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️ I've always loved this movie ❤️
Soooooo happy! I found this!
Martin Short ! . L💕🥰👍🦋🐶🤩😍ove him!
we all need great lovely stories all the time. Pandemic or not!!❤❤🤩😍👍🙏🦋🥰
Absolutely loved this ❤
That was sooo cool 😎 loved it❗🤧😂
I didn't know I needed this so much! I love it. ❤
Whoohoo! Congratulations to the Bride and Groom!
This plot was completely cheesy, but these characters still have so much fantastic chemistry that it's clear that a third film, with a good plot, needs to happen! Steve and Martin really brought their A games and made me smile! George and Franc were such a great comedy duo!
Maybe this is how, I'll get married!!! Over video chat :) :) -- Who knows tho?
Brilliant 👏
This is one of my favorite movie series!!! I’m so happy I ran across this delightful reunion 💜💜😍😍😍
Part 3 needs to be a full length now
This is the biggest let down.  Get out of your rooms, live your lives, we are here until we die anyways!
when Franke came on i was hoping George wouldve went ohhh Franke. How much is this going to cost me?
Man I was just watching FOB 2 over the weekend then I saw this!
OMG this was the reunion I needed. I have closure now with this family. I just watched Farher of the Bride 1 & 2 and this was the perfect ending. Thank you! 💗💗💗
I wish we had found out whether or not Annie and Bryan had more kids.
Amazing love it wish they add more from that like a proper reception and party xx
Yes!!  I am a Huge Fan of this Wonderful, Classic Movie.
This was Great!!  Father of The Bride, 1 2 and 3 !!  This has Always been on My Top Movies to Watch and Rewatch.  Never Gets Old!!  Such a Down to Earth and Loving Family.  Focuses on What is Real and What Matters in Life.  The Banks Family are Awesome!!
I can’t watch much more of this. It’s just bad. The movies were great. This not so much. Sorry, not sorry.
This was weird I didn't like it :/ I hope the ish means that this new cast isn't absolutely necessary because what made me fall in love with the original two was Kimberly and it was her first role...
🤣
steve martin hasnt aged at all
This needs to be a actual movie. Father of the groom
I love all The Father Of Bride movies they all made me cry just Beautiful😊❤💋🙋💯🎯
Franck doesn't age........impossible...hahahahaha
Who knows this person Nancy Meyers. Call, write and beg her to do another movie. We need this bad. The stupid Covid is settleddown and she could do it. PlEASE. I read about the new one that is being done, but it isn't htis family it isn't George Banks that we want to see All of these people are so special and we need this bad.
Loved this movie from the start
this was so cute.
this is more like a family reunion. Talking about the good or bad times.
They should make a third with the other daughter now
The part of Rachel wearing her late mothers wedding ring had me in tears.
Just now found out about this, and it's the most 2020 thing I've seen all day!!! And I love it!
“I memorized it”🙋🏼‍♀️
Oh my goodness I didn't know this was done,  so beautiful!!
I love this movie so much! I am touched by this sequel, really! Thank you for that! The father of the bride and the father of the bride part II are the movies that I watch to feel good, relaxed and happy. I love you guys!!!
Could we get a real part 3 please🥺
Steve martin and diane keaton are seriously just the best most realistic hollywood older couple... i grew up with these shows and this cast and this was just magical thank you everyone involved ❤ would love to see this on a weekly basis
Just stumbled on this after I watched Father of the Bride.....I would love a full length Father of the Bride part 3....this is great....
😭😭😭😭😭🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Great stuff ….! Steve Martin - brilliant ! The young actress “bride “ - extremely well done . The “mother “ , Diane Keaton , as always , effete and affected -  quite ghastly , same in everything - never recovered from “Annie Hall “ -  absolutely frightful as ever . “FRONK “ ? So exceptional ,the absolute making of the this movie . IMO.
Brings back memories 🥰
We need part 3, about Megan's wedding, Matty's baby and the Banks parents dealing with retirement and specifically, mortality. This needs to happen, as long as everyone from the cast is still available and able to do their part, including writers and composer Alan Silvestri.
What a lovely addition to the FOB series. So well done, just what I needed to see on a cold, winter's night.
Well I didn’t expect to be crying on a Sunday night 😭😭😭
Wow, I can't believe I just found this!  It was awesome!  Thank you Cast and Netflix for all doing this!
Please PLEASE make this happen on the big screen!! Even though this was short, and on a zoom call-I still got emotional and went right back into the story like I’d just seen it! Great job and please make a full length movie!! Maybe Mattie has a baby and Meghan gets married?? 🤷🏻‍♀️
This was so beautiful!!! ❤️❤️How did I not see this ?
Can’t believe the Banks’ and McKenzie’s gave birth to Florence Pugh and Ben Platt lmaooooo. I only found out that this existed bc I was looking through Florence Pugh’s filmography and saw this short and I was like “WAIT A MINUTE”
Franck stole the SHOW!!!
Frank is back 😂 iconic!
I didn’t even know this happened until now 😂
Loved the 2 movies, shooketh that Florence plays the youngest daughter… I need another movie!
This made my being sick ok.
This beyond awesome
Me and my 12 years old daughter just saw part 2. Didn't think she would love the Father of the Bride movies, but she loved it. She said, there are no movies like this nowadays.
“I think this is a brilliant beyond brilliant idea.” — nice Parent Trap reference there!
Жалко нет субтитров на русском((((
Omg. This was the best please make a part 3
I've always loved their house.
C’mooooooonnnnn do a full movie pleaseeseee!!!!! We need!!!!!
Cute
I wish they made a full movie of this I love father of the bride
Here's the spooky thing: Nancy Meyers wrote this 25 years ago, pandemic and Zoom call included.  *dun dun dun
I can’t watch Kieran without seeing Roman, im just waiting for him to say something absolutely despicable
Ugh, 1 year later, this didn't age that well.  Masks outside?  Gloves?  Leaving boxes outside/quarantined?  Changing shoes.  Disinfecting?  LMAO.  This short was like a record everything that was absolutely a huge waste of time to do/misinformation.  Ugh.  We need to be redeemed by an actual Father of the Bride 3.
Omg when I saw this on Megan's filmography since I was looking her up since black widow. I screamed!! I'm crying right nowwww ommmggg pls make this a film!!!!
Isn't that special!  There we go!  A masterpiece!  Thank you Steve Martin and cast!
Looking at Kieran Culkin, it’s hard to believe he just sent a D&&K pic on Succession!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
they need to use this cast and do a real part 3 with the youngest getting married
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I am about to rewatch those movies
I am so mad we can't get a real part 3. Martin and De Niro would of been so much fun to watch as dueling fathers
I loveeeee it
Wow. So who is with me on getting a full length movie. This would be epic.
I cannot believe I'm watching this and crying.  I'm a 62 year old black man that grew up watching every movie steve Martin ever made . Thank you Steve ( and all of you ) for bringing me so much joy ! 😊
I hope they make another full movie with these same characters, this was so funny.
This is so stupid it’s funny 😄
Whatever happened to Brian's mom?
This is the toughest thing towatch
The most heartwarming story ever 🥺❤️
When Steve put on his blazer!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yeah really Disney needs to stop screwing up everything and just make this full length 3rd film. Ugh
This was good till Robert De Nero showed his smug. It ruined it.
I have now become Fan of Nancy Meyers, what an incredibily smooth fun and romantic narration. I'm in love again I guess.
How the hell did I not know this existed? This is perfect I hope they do the whole movie.
Pathetic. It's like a competition to see who can be more fake on a Zoom call. Congrats to Kieran, though. Succession is a fantastic show, and Roman is a great character.
Today I have watched the 1, 2 and now meet the 3. OMG! Perfect! Sooo nostalgic. I love movies from 90's..
E queria muito que a Netflix fizesse o pai da noiva 3 o primeiro e o segundo filme fizeram parte da minha infancia e adolessencia. Tem mais algum Brasileiro ai?
Political decision to add the pandemic into this ?
Please make this into a full length movie, I don't know why this got me so emotional but I cried through the whole thing!
I love Franck🤣
This is the perfect premise for a part two of part 3. Once they get around to getting everyone on set, they could have a renewal ceremony with Matty's bride could also be having a baby.
super lame,  part of the programming and brainwashing of humanity.
That was brilliant, I think we need a full length movie
yasss Ben!!!
Eeetts all vuuury sheeek!!!
😍
One of the most interesting aspects of all these early pandemic videos is that we got to see what star's houses look like. Love De Niro's home; very rustic.
Gah, you'd have to have a lot of confidence in her decision. If you set all of that up and she said no you'd pretty much have no other option besides taking yourself out.
this is the cringiest creepiest thing I have ever seen. I loved the movies as a kid but this whole Covid narrative and zoom reality is just disgusting.
I hope they do a father of the bride 3 full Length movie
Loveeeee it 🤍🤍🤍
Georgie looks 40 😂
Well, this was horribly depressing.
BEN PLAAAAAAAAAAT
💞💞 adorable 😍!!! just finished Father of Bride...and Father of Bride 2....this just rounded it all especially during 2020 and even NOW!...
Can’t we get a Grandfather of the Bride movie? :)
Loved this. Where was Brian though??
Que delícia vê-los de novo.
This is the cheesiest thing ever.
Did anyone else feel they were reconnecting with family while watching this?
OH MY GOD I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVED THIS!!!! AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I’m not crying, YOU’RE crying 😭🥰
FULL LENGTH NETFLIX!!!!!
Had to turn it off when Ben Platt started singing because anything he is in, he just HAS to sing rather than just act but YAY! I'm so happy this happened!!!
The warmth of the first movie is really special.
Martin Short is a legend.
booooring
I loved this series and I'm so happy for this small reunion...Mad I found out about it a year late 😆
I didn't fuckin new that the new born babies were FLORENCE PUGH AND BEN PLATT!!!!?!?
Can’t believe I actually cried tears of joy
Cant believe I didn’t know this existed. Also didn’t know how much I missed Franck!
Give us part 3!!!!!
Just came back to rewatch for umpteen time. Felt like I needed a little schmaltz today.  💙✌️
Oh my goodness, thank you for this so so much!!!❤❤❤
Im only here for florence
I watched this when it first came out and didn't realise that was flo 🤦‍♀️
Why hasn't this been made into a full length movie yet
Father of the Bride 1 & 2 were on earlier today, and until now i had no idea this even existed. Such great movies and I absolutely loved this as well.
job well done Alan silvestri
Now they need a full length feature film about Megan getting married. They can call it Father of the Bride Again.
"Let's do a part 4.. we get the 2nd daughter married and finish the pandemics poor and happy!" (what would George Banks say..)
I wish they would actually make it into a full movie
I hope Netflix make part 3 for Christmas in 2021 or 2022!!!
I just happened to see this. Sooo cute. They need to do a Father Of The Bride part 3 ASAP.
Yelena!
I always thought Matt was comically ignored in the movies but it was also kind of sad to me so I'm glad he got something that focused on him!  Still think it could be for comical purposes that he only gets a short if a full Father of the Bride 3 comes out focusing on Megan's wedding lol
Glad to see them using nanny and poppy like we called our grandparents.
I NEED another Nancy Meyer movie!
PLS make this an actual movie
Please make a full movie!
i randomly had the urge to watch father of the bride 2 a few nights ago  and came across this. 🙂  what a nice surprise.
forgot for a sec that florence is british
I wasn’t expecting Ben Platt, best surprise ever 😍
Now what about part 4ish?
I can't believe that I didn't see this when it dropped last year! I looooove F.O.B. movies! This reboot was such a delightful reunion. These characters live in our hearts!❤
I'm in literal 😢 🥺  My family knows how much I LOVE this version of the movie and my son sent this clip to me!! It made my night❤ I'm sooo happy and can't wait to see this shall it getsta moving!!!
Me to  definitely do it.

Everytime i watched this movies it feels LIKE HOME
Its pissed me off I want a movie
we definitely need father of the bride 3....ASAP
OMG, I just found this. They need to make this into a full-length movie that picks up from this.
Omg i cried of joy I’m so happy !!!!!!!! Now we challenge you to make a complet movie  But that was good !! Heaven if it’s 25 minutes !!! Thanks Nancy !!!  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰😭😂
God knows this is touching ❤️ infact superb 👍
This was so sweeettt !!!! 😂😍😍🥰🥰
Come on. Dont play with our emotions like this. Make this happen already!
God bless, I wish this was a full movie❤️
OMG LOVE IT!😂
Martin Short hasn't aged either... and Kieran looks quite gorgeous! <3
Omg this is amazing
Watching this June ‘21, and A) just got the Banks Part 1/Banks Part 2 joke, and B) they need a 4th(abouts) where they are vaccinated, reunited, and doing whatever next step for this lovable family is.
Netflix Thank you for such a heart warming gift...I am falling in love with Nancy Meyers movies....I  saw Father of the Bride just yesterday...and today found this gem of a part 3(ish)....and am crying now....such a wonderful movie....
I will never watch this 3rd installment! They ruined it for me with the ad to donate! I was going to buy parts 1 & 2 but I am not going to now! Rachel is way too over the top for political correctness!
The mother needs to dress more like the movie lol (with a modern touch)
This was magical... Please let it be a movie i can do 2hrs maybe more... Of these people...💗
Father of the bride pt 3 that’s it
Diane is
Netflix do your thing and do this movie.
That was adorable. So 2020, but absolutely adorable. George losing his mind over not going to a wedding he didn't have to pay for cracked me up. Lmao
hang on, the doesn't include the original 1950s film with elizabeth taylor. Now that was brilliant!
I didn’t know this was a thing!?!  I need a full movie 😭
ladies, any guy that asks you to marry him and then doing it online... is not worth being with.
Forgot how much i loved these movies! Such a great family watch.
Loved it!!! Randomly watched father of the bride 1 last night and decided to watch 2 this morning. To then find out there was this part 3ish!! Simply amazing
Can't believe this actually got political. For ffs
We really want to see the movie "father of the bride 3". I hope you make a movie. Please like my comment so they see it.
I have a question when will this come out?
MAKE THIS A MOVIE
I always wished Steve Martin made a sequel to "LA Story".
OMFG I did not know this was a thing until legit an hour ago and I didn't know it was a thing I needed, I was always hoping for a 3rd part for these films (they are among my absolute favorites) and here I am having all the feels and the new additions just perfection! Come on Netflix do us the favor and give us a full length movie!!!
They really need to make a complete new movie - may be all the 3 youngsters can get married and cause George to go nuts
I love these films, funny and sweet ! I’ve a real soft spot for no, 2
Beautiful  movie . Why too short movie .
My #1 best of all my years part 1, part 2, and now 3❣️❣️❣️
The dislikes are all for De Niro. Steve Martin and Martin Short are national treasures.
I thought this was supposed to be funny?! Thank God this never got made into a feature length film. The stuff they were laughing at wasn't funny.
Please make a full length part 3 netflix!!!!!!
I LOVE THIS MOVIE MORE THAN ANYTHING PERIOD 😡😡
Get you somebody who looks at you like Rachel & Matty look at each other @16:35
Father Of The Bride was one of my favorite family movies growing up. 😍
It’s something we didn’t know we needed
This is just wonderful! We need a full-lengh movie!!!
OH MY GOD 😍😍😍😍😍
I can’t believe it. maybe I was so young that I didn’t speak yet when I first saw the father of the bride and from that moment it became my home, I've seen it with my family at least 2000 times and it is very important to me: every time I’m sad or something is wrong,  the father of the bride is always there to reassure me and make me feel better and when I’m happy the father of the bride increases my happiness. I don’t know what extraordinary power these movies have but I just know that they’re really so special and finding out that it was done the third part made my dream come true: I've always thought all the actors in the cast not only as characters, but as real people who continue to live their lives in a parallel world and also seeing them in the situation that we are all living makes me believe even more in this and it makes me so happy. thanks to everyone, thanks to this movie, to George, to Nina, to Annie, Matty, Bryan, Fronk, thank you for being part of my family❤🤞
guess who's crying?
When Father of the Bride is coming to the UK Disney Plus this weekend so you gotta prepare and watch this a thousand times 👀😍😂😂
13:46 HOLY SHIT ROBERT DE NIRO  Meet the Parents reunited.
Ever notice Steve Martin's background is a green screen.   Can we please have a part 3(a proper one).
0:06 Reese Witherspoon
I guess I should be a little embarrassed but I watched I and II last night.
I just love this!
They have the music!!!  My daughter is 10 and I can’t wait to walk her to that very music
Steve Martin is just too good
OMG PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MAKE THIS IN TO A TWO HOUR ESCAPE TO WATCH!!!
I hope weddings never have to actually be this way ( cute film tho)
Please make an actual third one 😍
I was just watching one and two yesterday
Cried so much watching it. Thank you. This was perfect
Florence wasn't in the original lol
My sweet heaven!! I need this movie to come true!! I'm crying real tears!! Seeing everyone so grown fills my heart with so much joy!!
Kimberly williams paisley played in Christmas chronicles 1 and 2 so i already know how much she has changed.
I’m crying stupid amounts. I love this. I never knew this existed until today. Thank you, Nancy! ♥️
So, Elf is the ultimate feel good Christmas movie. The Father of the Bride movies are that for the rest of the year. ❤️
That part three of father of the bride is amazing!
Why is everyone saying we need a full-length Father of the Bride 3 movie?! We do not! This was perfect! As much as I would love to see more of Martin Short as Franck, a full movie is too unnecessary. This is the perfect note to end the story on.
LMAOAOAOA WHEN JAMES CAME IN FLIRTING 😂😂😂😂😂
U Got to make this into a movie now   for 2021 maybe after what we saw
Wow.... Seriously amazing short movie
I would watch the movie..I love theese People so much
Very well done!!
So they just eliminated the black woman who was obviously the bride's mother? Typical hollywood racism. Dislike.
Come to think of it, I feel like they should have also included Megan the doctor.
Wonderful.
❤️
I love it I need full movie please
They destroyed this with talking about corona virus 🙄
I guess Florence Pugh aka Megan Banks can't escape yellow flowers!  In "Midsommar" she was Dani and surrounded by yellow flowers and other flower colors.
Annie has not aged at all-  Lord I’m jealous
I am damned that I don't have a family like this. Just me,Mom and Dad.
Hoping for part 3 full movie 🙏
Okay, but how about making it into an actual movie now?
Damn, Steve Martin owns this shit
I have no words ... Just awesome feelings. Thank you.
This was great brought a smile to my face. Can't believe I'm just seeing this
Legit cried ❤️
Awful
Crying! FOTB 1 and 2 are in my top 5 of all time favorite movies and this was just beautiful! 🥺❤️
Ick. This was cringe.
Sequel please, not a remake
Now we need to make a movie to see what happen next.
Love love this movie. Seen both 1 an 2 a few times. This little segment update was beautiful 😊🤗🤗
Lost me at deniro
I'm just seeing this now, but it was brilliant!!! We need more!!!
The Way you Look Tonight bring tears to my eyes, I danced that beautiful song with my papa (father in law) that very same version on my wedding day on 1995.
Leave it up to Hollywood people to try to normalize the abuse and debasement of humanity all in the name of a virus
I loved it!!! It brung me to tears too, wow after all these years the third one is Great too💜🙂😂! It was good to see everyone again after so many years later. May God Bless you All🙂💜🙏
Omg can’t believe part 3
Surprise surprise they put two leftist together for this. Shame on you Steve and Robert.
Boring!!! What a waste of time. They talked about Covid. 🥱🥱🥱🥱
Kimberly Williams still looks damn hot!
HIS PROPOSAL IS SO SWEET AND CUTE!!!
16:52 lolololol
omg this was so beautiful.
An uncredited Reese Witherspoon hosts this presentation.
Zoom weddings are much cheaper than lavish,multi-bodied ones with people in dress and formal attire. The Zooms are come-as-you-are events. They are very similar to the short-time Justice Of Peace knot-tyings. Apparently,Matthew Banks is not prejudiced at all,you can see he married a half-black girl. I didn't initially recognize the dude with the beard,but when I heard the name Georgie Mackenzie,that had to be Bryan's and Annie's young adult son who was born in FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART 2. The name of the other young girl seen here is George and Nina's third child Nina who was also born in FOTB PART 2.
we need a third movie!! love this!

I think I'm the only one who feels this way: George, heart full of giving totally loves Nina. Nina, always mocking and rolling her eyes; is she George's mother whose job is to correct him. In real life anyone who is so downplayed by their spouse for 50 years would likely have given up.
Omg !!! 😁😁
Help me! I'm dying of nostalgia!
They should totally do a sequel for real.
Steve Martin and Robert De Niro are hilarious.
Nah would've been better if it had been made in 2019
I love this so much! I own both movies and was actually just watching the first. There’s just something about this movie that brings me so much joy & happiness, it’s incredible. Watching this clip, especially right now with all this pandemic chaos going on, I couldn’t help but get a little emotional. My favorite family, self quarantining, and little Matty, all grown up getting married 💕 I just love it all. Definitely touched my heart and had me grinning from ear to ear. Everyone looks amazing, and maybe,  just maybe, after this COVID mess, they can go on and make a part 3 🥰❤️  Definitely needed this right now.
NEXTFLIX PLEASE MAKE THIS A REAL MOVIE IN 2021 OKAY?!?!?!
Could be the part 3 for the real? just wondering..
WHAT
Please let this become a movie!!!!!!
Hollywood screws up everything, It was a great movie but the liberals feel the need to "Woke" everything and that's why he has a light-skinned fiance.. get real.. liberalism is a Mental Retardation..
Steve Martin and DeNero need a film together.
I love these reunions but why do we always have to incorporate the pandemic into them. It would sure be nice to not be reminded of it everytime I watch something. I mean aren't movies and TV suppose to be escapism?
I so needed this in my life. a great feeling in my heart after my mother passed away. Thanks
This was one of my favorite movies growing up. Always watched it with my grandma.
Each part gets better. This will be a blast to look at I vote yes 4 it to be made in to a full length movie . PS this is the nest thing that has made me laugh so hard. Thank you so much for this God bless you all
Father of the bride 3 please
That's was amazing!♡♡♡
Okay sorry why am I only seeing this now?!
I loved every bit of this and bc I’m a huge fan of the 2 Father Of The Bride films I thought this 3rd film was so so sweet. So many precious moments that made my heart just melt and made me smile so big.
Worst fake piano playing ever.
Love love love!!!!!
Grew up with the first two movies and always loved them. Need a full length third movie. Make it happen, Netflix! I know you can afford it 😁
That girl is Storm from X Men, right?
Kieran could make this reunion but not the Scott Pilgrim Vs the World reunion!?
They had to throw in a black girl to offset the whiteness of this cast.
Omg literally tears in my eyes
Florence Pugh and Ben Platt as the babies? Aww
Omh i forgot how much iv missed father of the bride!!!!!!!!! Father of the groom?!!? Omg i needed franck 🤣🤣🤣
Benji?
This needs to be made😍
Cute movie short. Full length Movie? Would be great if the actors want to do it. Love both Father of the Bride I & II. After 2020, a feel-good movie without superheroes, wars, or car chases may be so needed!
I loved this movie 💜💜this was priceless
NETFLIX,  MAKE FATHER OF THE BRIDE 3 HAPPEENNNNNNNN, CMONN   WE NEED THIS
I so can't wait to watch this. it brought tears to my eyes. They all never change
Yaaaay frankkkkk. I was so peeved thinking he wasnt gonna show.
Absolutely enjoyed it!! Thank you!!
If we don't get a third full length movie after this teaser I will lose my mind! I can imagine how hilarious this will be with the new family additions. Please make this happen!!!
So cool!! Father of the bride is one of my favorite movies, thank you for doing this.
Love the Dan and Leland sticker on the guitar case!
Sorry boring, the world is sick and tired of covid and you make it into this movie. Not a good move
I dismissed FTOB as just another chick flick, until one night in 1993, when I came home from work after a really crappy day at work and this movie was one one of the subscription channels. I'd always liked Steve Martin and had been a fan of Diane Keaton since I saw her in "Sleeper," in the '70s. After watching the film while enjoying a couple of beers, I'd forgotten all about how bad the day had been. I saw the sequel with my girlfriend of the time, in early 1996, and it was good but didn't quite have the charm of the original. That said, both films are wonderfully cast and a perfect way to escape from the realities of life for a couple of hours. It's also great to see an Austin-Healey 3000 featured (I owned one for many years) in a film, although sharp-eyed watchers will note that a different Healey was used for FOTB2.
😍😍😍😍😍💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
I thought Matty was going to be gay for Father of the Bride 3
I won’t ever attend a virtual anything
This was really stupid
I love they go the corona virus in this movie. Freakin’ sheeple’s
MAKE THIS FOR HOME ALONE AND MEAN GIRLS
Just watched FOTB 1 and 2 then come across this part 3 December 2020 love from UK 🇬🇧
Some time ago there was a rumour about a third movie where Matty was supposed to get married but to a guy but it was just a rumour, Steve Martin stated that he was never asked to take the role neither he received a script. Well, that's not going to happen now
WOW! That was truly incredible! What an amazing treat! We defintely need another movie!
I wish FOTB 1 and 2 were actually on Netflix:/
martin short can still NAIL that accent.
Love it I’m hope they do make fob 3
My wife and I just got invested into this movie franchise because we’re fans of Steve Martin and Martin Short. Seeing this was amazing and seeing Robert DeNiro was just icing on this amazing cake! Please make a full length film with the same cast!
okay Annie’s son look way too old and the third kid doesn’t look like a sibling but oh well.  Make a father of the bride part 3
i'm so proud of them!!!
Omg that was complete rubbish what a stupid thing to do its not the 90s anymore move on
I LOVED THIS!!!! 💕💕💕💕 Great memories from the original movies and a lovely way to continue the story 🥰♥️♥️🤗🤗🌷🌷🌷.                   🌸
the season needs to be about the youngest girl
his aunt looks younger than him
OMG WOW
omg i loved those two father of the bride movies. this seems cool wishing it really was a movie though ..i know we can because of the pandemic.
That was bizarre.
My favorite movie omg yasss part 3 me plz
I hope you will make this into a real movie. I love it.
This is so perfect 🤩
This is part of the great reset 2021 ... scary 😦
I thought Georgie was called Jake in FOTB Part 2?
During the lockdown, I binge-watched the first two movies for the first time and I loved it so much. Can't believe that we get a mini-reunion/short film. I need a full length movie of Part 3.
Wonderful score by Alan Silvestri. 1991 defeats 2020. Of course!
We need a full movie when this pandemic is over! I so needed this. I loved it ♥️♥️
Hello all! I am just seeing this...I have watched part 1 and 2 too many times to count.  I always have a warm feeling when I watch these movies;  they are apart of my go-to.  I can't believe how happy this mini movie is making me!  Yay!!!!!!!!!
Is this a new show on net Flix????
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make this film! I’m laughing and in tears. This was sooooo good. The writing is what made this perfect. It gets you. Just watch.
Funny how the uncle looks younger than his nephew.
I love it, can’t believe I cried lol
Florence pugh is out this world this is a very smart idea and I hope they have raised a lot of money for these people on the front line fighting this terrible virus
I’m really crying I love this!!!!
This is the perfect Banks wedding if ever there was one! How fantastic! I loved every moment of this!!
My family love the 2 movies. I never knew to make part 3 ish.
This needs to be a full length movie that everyone can see and not just people who have a Netflix account.
This is literally my childhood dreams coming true! Thank you so much Netflix.
Thank you for this. We are still social physical distancing from almost everyone with the fam and it was really really hard. And that speech at the end really spoke to our hearts. And my mom also teared up- she felt understood and seen and that others are going thro what we are going through and made her feel better. Also the whole thing was relatable. All feelings all characters. Thank you so much for bringing this back. Thank you for the talk. Thank you for the topic. A part of history. Also aiding us having a hard time
Thank you for this
The song at the end should of been 'every party has a pooper, that's why we invited you. George Banks!'
I love Steve Martin, Diane Keaton and Martin Short....  This had too much Covid
I absolutely love this!! I've seen it 100 times already and still can't get enough of it. I really really hope it gets made into a full length film!!
If they don’t make this Into an actual film I’ll be bitterly disappointed !
I'm so happy to see this!!! I love this family!!!Thank you so much!!!
Annie hasn't aged! Still so cute! Wouldn't have recognised Bryan though.
Is Annie Banks still married? Why are they zooming separately?
I love this movie a lot.😊
Love this. I love how Florence was in it as well as the youngest daughter, just great.
Oh.. so beautiful
Ben Platt singing The Way You Look Tonight is everything.
Oh, I love it. I loved the two first movies.
One of my favourite movie of all times!Claudio, from Venice, Italy
I cried the whole time. Seeing all of them again as the Banks family.
Why am I crying? Why am I crying? The voice over 😭😭😭 So sweet
Is anyone else crying?? It just brought back SO MANY memories!! If you grew up watching this family and watching then grow with us, then I think we needed this more than we all know especially during these times
Wow this is terrible but WCK deserves all the $$$
I wonder if this will be used to test the waters and possibly have a 3rd film?    I know it was to raise funds for that charity but maybe it will be a stepping stone for a trilogy.
Adorei!
It's not funny
A little cheesy but worth the watch.
Even the music makes me emotionallllll.
Damn, he old
Please, stop asking for a full movie, name one of these reboots that lived up to the originals and didn't spoil our memories of them. This is as cute as it could possibly be (surprisingly!) and let's leave it at that. BELIEVE ME.
My Happy place!
احب الفيلم اتمنى يكون له جزء ٣ الوضع يحتاج لذلك
I never saw any advertisements for this. Clearly, I was living under a rock! Excited for this to be an actual movie! I’ve seen these movies trillions of times growing up...love them!
Sooo sweet!!! I love this movie!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is a movie that just makes 2020 so much better! We need this turned into a full movie pleaseeeeeee!!!!!
I just watched Father of the Bride (1) yesterday. I also loved part 2 so this is absolutely awesome!!!! Please please please do another full movie!!! 😊
Better than I was expecting!! When's the movie of their in person wedding and the baby getting married??
Love it 💕💕💕💕
As I wipe away tears I’m searching for the first movie to stream.  This was so lovely and joyful!
This was SO well done! Tasteful and not cringe. You still believe that this is the Banks family! Plus, none of them age😍😍
Amazing!!! Please please PLEASE one more 🍿 movie!!!
😍😍
Steve Martín.. I miss hem so much
The ish has to go!!!! It has to be just father of the bride 3
Love you Reese...Can’t wait for Legally Blond Part 3.....and your performance in “Vanity Fair” was truly the best ever done .
OMG This made me cry. I need a full movie and there needs to be a part 4 with great grandkids.
We need a full movie with the real wedding pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease
Why am I crying already
Thank you so much for giving us this! It was perfect. A reminder of better times we all hope to see again. So sweet. Love it ❤
This is easily the best thing I have watched in a very long time. I actually watched it twice in one sitting and will definitely watch it many more times. This made me so happy i cried. Please do more.
I was hoping for a moment when Robert De Niro got confused and asked if they were talking to him.
a full-length movie that ties in with this is very doable. i propose that the story would be is that once the quarantine ends and everything somewhat goes back to normal, they plan/do an actual ceremonial wedding. the sub-story would be that Robert De Niro plays his role as the "Father of the Bride" but George becomes somewhat jealous and clashing ensues between them.
I am a ball of tears...
Feels like so much NWO propaganda. Gag. Disappointed in these actors for participating.
This is one of the most over-acted and cringiest pieces of film I have ever seen in my life. It couldnt be more stereotypically Hollywood if it tried.
I love it... !!
This was so adorable!!!
My favorite part, the song at the end.
What they call, a love letter to the fans, like Ghostbusters Afterlife and TopGun Maverick.
Creative.
Loved it.  Thank you
😭😭😭😭😭 this. Is. The. Best. Please make part 3 full length movie.
This is NOTHING more than MINDCONTROL. Beast system. Wake up people.
Fell in love all over again.
Really part 3 on dvd I can’t wait plzs make more
This was incredibly written and performed fir a short!!! I want more!!!!!!!!! Please bring this movie into A series !!!
Two of my favorite childhood movies! I loved this ❤️❤️❤️❤️
PLEASEEEEE make this into a movie!!!!!! Father of the Bride 1 & 2 is 2 of my FAVORITE movies!!!!! I need that time of happiness and great quality movies back ❤️
So much love!! I love this! Congrats!!
Okay now I NEED Martin Short to officiate my wedding.
I'm just so happy I survived to see this! Thank you so much!!😭
OMG THIS WAS AMAZING !!!!
I need this movie as soon as this pandemic is over!! This was amazing! My sister and I loved these movies...this brought back so many memories!😍😍
Steve Martin's character in Father of the Bride always remind me of my late father. Miss you, Dad...
Movie please please xxxx
Awe!!!! So sweet!!! I am in love
I used to produce events, and i HATE weddings, but I've loved these movies my ENTIRE life. Diane Keaton, you're just the greatest. You're all adorable for this. Thank you!
I just love Father of Bride please bring it on
This made me so happy tears and smiles of joy such love is priceless!
When uncle Franck appeared I cried he is sooo sweeet
I love this movie! Please do Father of the Bride 3 movie!! This has to happen!!!
OMG!  THAT WAS THE BEST!🥰👍😅👏. Now you know we need a FULL part 3!
Robert De Nero <3 I love this <3
My favorite movie series of all time
Lovlely ❣️❣️❣️

🥰
Oh Matty 😭
I watch father of the bride every time I finish semester exams 😢 such a feel good movie ♥️
Such a great video! Made me so happy and cry tears of joy and love. I loved both Father of the Bride and Father of the Bride Part 2
When will Netflix release the film in Brazil?
❤️
Such a beautiful video 😭😭😭😘😘😍😍😍
Madre Mia !!!!!!! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍👏👏👏👌👌👌
"I give you this rung"
Ight Netflix.. the people has spoken.  We need it!!
Just make a movie....
I didn’t realize how much I needed this but I also need this to be a full movie...so here’s my plot: these two have an actual wedding or they’re pregnant and baby sister gets engaged and grandson gets engaged and they have a double wedding!
I love this movie ,,,  this is the best thing ever ,, Netflix gift us a full movie 🍿 we will cherish it so much... this what we need love and family union in the craziness of pandemic 😷 — I love 💕 it it make me cry in a good way..
So this was the legal part? Can we please have an actual wedding and a full length movie as the next part.
That was beautiful. Thank you Everyone 💖. It would be great to see more 🥰.
I like it, it’s funny, and good.
Ridiculous, that I cried 3x in under 30 minutes... but if anything will do it, it's definitely this
I haven’t cried so much like this since my mom died 18 months ago. The ring hit me hard. I’m wearing my moms favorite ring to remember her by. My fiancé said she gave it to him to give to me if he truly loved me. We’re getting married at Disneyworld in 2022. Had to put it off a year due to the pandemic. Also our wedding planner got word they will be closing the parks and resorts again for sanitization
I have just wept buckets.  Thank you to the cast for their sheer brilliance in this terrible year.  A perfect pick-me-up. 😍😷😭👰🏽💍💏
Imagine the savings in a zoom wedding
OMG I LOVE THIS MOVIE AS A KID AND I AM SO HAPPY YOU MADE THIS NETFLIXXXX ❤️❤️❤️ THANK YOUUUU
could this get any better
Thanks so much! Cast and Netflix. I’m sending, Love 💕 Light and Laughter to all!!..you put on these Movies, it brings Healing, Hope and Happiness in a Very Healthy and Prosperous way, In our lives. I’ve cried 😭Laughed😂🤣 🤭 😅 and I wanted more of this Brilliant feeling, I have. I’m trying to describe best.. Best Blessings Hope Love 💗 Light!! to dreams and Wishes happening into more fruition 🎉🎊 Yay!! Yay!!! Yay!!!!😁 Thank you,  all so much! Again.😉💜🌟🤗
Cried so many times. Love this movie franchise ❤️
I have no words to express how happy this made my heart... 😢 As a fan of these movies, this was just amazing and needed in this time... Thank you.
Please do a full movie on this. I didnt realize how much i missed this movie 😭😭
Oh my gosh! I loved it! I probably shouldn’t have been putting my makeup on while I was watching this, because it was a tearjerker😭Oh, I hope this becomes a movie🙏🏻
I absolutely loved Father of the Bride 1 and 2 and i miss the glorious movies of the 90s with such iconic actors and beautiful sets and how wonderful the 90s were which are sealed like a time capsule to revisit when we cnt tolerate how life has become anymore and if it werent for whoever is respomsible for pushing the whole online impersonal marriage and isolating the most intimate relationship of all by a screen and make it virtual and suck people into it. If it wasnt for this i would absolutely love it. And i want a part 3 with a REAL WEDDING. NOT BUYING THIS ONLINE VIRTUAL WEDDING PROPAGANDA. not going to catch on as much as the govt tries. Your not going to separate us. Not going to happen .so i hope netflix gets it right by making a part 3 whicj is desperately needed with a REAL WEDDING where the couple are present in person. But nonetheless i thank the actors for bringjng back a slice of the wonderful times through this revisit and if it wasnt filled with covid propaganda and separation of families and loved ones through screens it would be perfect. Still thank the actors for coming together to give thuer time and energy to donate to a worthy cause. The plot though was propaganda and whoever is responsible for this , just knw its not going to work. Were humans u cannot and will not succeed in keeping us apart and making us a robot generation.
I sooooo needed this..... NETFLIX as always you knocked it outta the park. I was in tears and emotional the entire time. Please make this movie for real when the pandemic is under control.... pick up right here at the end of the zoom meeting. God bless y’all for this.  Y’all PLEASE DONATE. Be blessed.
That was terrible
Im crying - my dad was so much like George Banks over my wedding - I lost my daddy this year and I miss him so so much
Please make it a movie, heal our hearts with the father of the bride 3, in this hard times  🙏🙏🙏
OMG I love this
Wow
Kieran culkin looks absolutely like he's been in Scott Pilgrim vs the world
Absolutely beautiful
❤️.... this need need need to be a real movie when this is all over ☺️
awsome x
Father of the Bride I & II are two of my all-time favorite movies. I thought that it was pretty cool that I saw FOTB I for the first time when we were actually planning our daughter's wedding and my husband could SO relate to George Banks, lol! I'd always hoped that a part 3 would be made. Great movies!
Nice.  Cheers and Office zoom is needed.
Thank you for this. ❤
This was beautiful! It made my day! Thank you ❤️🙏🏾
This was amazing
This is EVERYTHING!!!!!🙌🙌🙌 A full length movie version pleaseeeeeeeee 💖💖💖💖💖💖
amazing, beautiful
Wow!!! This was amazing🥰
Good grief why am I crying?!  Please make this a movie!
This was so so so sweet omg!!!
Love this!!!! ❤ i love how they are doing stuff like this with old movies after so long!
Wait but it’s like Steve has aged but like he hasn’t at the same time...🤔
I wanted "chaahpp chicken"!
Oh the joy this brought to my life!!! Made my heart smile. The cast of this movie is Phenomenal... makes me laugh & cry every time I watch both movies & this warms my ❤ THANK YOU!!!!
Ok we got the cast. Let’s make this happen!!! By the way. Don’t watch the first 2 then this one in a row. Your heart will explode with love and Care Bear stares. 😍😍😭😭
I need this movie 😭. Also I Love Florence and ben too.
The only reason i got through it is cuz i loved the show so much. This whole thing is a joke. What less than 10 people cant come together to share such a huge moment of life? No its more important to see who can be the most paronoid. Also btw you dont look that refreshed after a 24 hour shift. Lamest thing i ever seen.
Oh wow this is such a good movie I love that his gf Fiancé is black/biracial, like love ❤️! There going to need a part 4 where Mattye has a kid etc.
how did a zoom call make me cry?! this makes no sense!
This  just never gets old. Brilliantly done
Steve Martin looks good to be 75 yrs old! So does Diane Keaton and she's 74
SO BEAUTIFUL!!!!!
Please Netflix make it a part 3
Dumb
The song!!!
Wow what a wonderful way to help our families in need! Way to go Netflix nothing says caring like sharing! I loved the first film it's one of my all time favorites! Reese Witherspoon is America's sweetheart of goodness a true roll model for our young ladies! I did not even know this film assisted and it has all our awesome favorite characters yeah! Can't wait! Thank you for sharing this fun family film with our family of humanity! ♡♡♡ :)
Oh my! Loved it ! Crying so much! Thank you 🙏🏾
This was perfect 😍 I love Father of the Bride
I’m not crying, I’m not crying 😭 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
oh woww..that beautiful house...😍
OMG! Ben Platt, too? Woohoo!  Would love a full on movie sequel one day. 🥰🥰🥰
I don't want to exaggerate but this is as good as the two movies, thank you guys
Crying my eyes out! I love this so much!
Does anyone know where Reese got that top from?
The only sequel/reboot that I've seen that is actually good! Great Job!❤
lovely. I hate that they're remaking it :'(
MAKE 👏 THIS 👏 HAPPEN 👏
So great that they did this :)

I agree we need a father of the bride part 3. I actually love to see Matty get married and how the family is doing
❤️❤️❤️ Luv this!!!
Thank you so much for this.... Absolutely beautiful!
The best!! ❤❤
This was AWESOME! Happy tears 💖

Thank you!!!!!!!!!
THE KEATON!!!  I love this. Yes, we need a Father of the Bride 3❤
Awwwwwwww
Bravo 👏🏿 😭 ♥️
I had no idea this existed until an hour ago! I just watched it and I'm smiling ear to ear with some tears in my eyes. Wonderful, heartwarming short. The cast still manages to bring it with new additions. Rachel (and her actress) is beautiful, my gosh! It was a lovely short and Nancy did a great job with writing and directing. Thank you so much for this!
I soooooooo needed this today! Bless youuuuu!!!
Why did this make me cry??!! 😭😂💜💜
Omg this was awesome. More Father of the Bride movies to follow on from this one please.🙂
This is so sweet!!!They are so sweet!!! I really love them and  I really love this fantastic video!!! Thanks a lot NETFLIX!!! PLEASE THE COMPLETE MOVIE!!!!💕💕💕💕
Thanks a lot for this beautiful zoom!!! I  This is so great. I want the complete movie!!! They are wonderful actors and actress . Love them!!!💕💕💕💕
This was so special. Please consider expanding this little tidbit into a full length movie. These characters never get old.❤️
So many dislikes, but this was awesome. I love how they brought a little joy to this pandemic. Great idea -- whoever thought of it. Love this so much.
Came across this today. I am blubbering.  I loved both movies. Thank you for this gift.
😭😭😭😭🥰🥰🥳🎉❤️❤️
Makes me tearful evertime😩😩💗
Please do a 3!!
Omgosh I LOVE THIS ♥️♥️♥️ We miss the Banks family ♥️♥️♥️What an incredible thing to do and organization to support. We love you guys ♥️♥️♥️
Lovely 💖💖💖
This is too good!!! What a great idea!💖💖
That was just lovely.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'am crying right now🐾❤️
Ridiculous!
Omg I used to watch Father of the Bride 👰 part 1 and 2 all the time with my mom. It makes me feel so many emotions, I really love this but I feel like the pandemic ruined it. I did have this idea of a Skype wedding and it was a like 10 years ago.  I told some people my idea and they were like that is crazy. Haha it’s interesting that this is happening now. Feel so many different things right now.’
I used to watch Father of the Bride and the sequel all the time when I was young. This is a nice touch.
Love it, love it, love it. Make me laugh and cry, exactly like Father of the bride 1 and 2. Perfect cast, perfect everything. Perfect.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wedding in Tuscany with the Banks family when things all calm down? Please oh please. This was amazing I’m so happy this popped up on my feed. I’m crying I loved these movies so much!
Wait til they have a kid. PART 4 NETFLIX!!
Awww I love this they need to make a part 3 I would watch it we all need  something positive to watch during this hard times 😁
This is so close to home for those of us in the same situation in this strange year.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  LOVED both of the movies and this was GREAT!!!
Why am I crying????
I wish it was a full movie how awesome I absolutely l Loved it
Ok...we need a part 3 ASAP! Maybe throw in a Part 4 where the baby of the family and the grandson have a double wedding too!
This was soooooo stupid!! Dont mess with originals!!
Oh wow this was so much fun and really good seeing all the original characters!!!!
That moment when you realize Bryan from FOTB is also Charlie from Scandal. And yes I'm all for a part 3 😁👍
OMG I can't stop crying. I love this so much.
This was great!!! I really loved it!!!
Please make the 3rd movie
Omg please do a full length film. This is the perfect start. I love the additions .Please do this . I always wanted a prt 3.
My dad’s grandpa name is Poppy.
My favorite movies! There definitely needs to be 3rd one! Did anyone else tear up!
Why did this made me so emotional 😢❤️ now I really want a part 3 with this same cast
This was so sweet. Needed this today. Wishing everyone well.
omg love this.......please make this a movie, love this family....this needs to happen!!
I loved this thank you
Fantastic 👏 I cried watching this one as well
Ok Netflix, now we Need an actual Part 3. Let’s make it happen people !
Acting is corny
We need this movie then part 4 with the next wedding george needs to pay for
Wowwwww I am blown away we need to have a full length movie soon 🤩
This really makes me want part 3 ♥
I love this!! 🤣 This is my favorite movie saga. I needed this. 🥰 Absolutely love this.
I’m not crying your crying 😢
That’s so lovely, I can’t! They have to make a movie. Please, please! Father of the bride is the best! ❤️
Gosh this made me tear up. We need a post pandemic wedding in Italy ASAP!
Why am I not surprised that they didn’t bother to give her a mom or family beyond throwing Robert De Niro in as her dad...yeah I’m that hater in the comment section. And I’m completely okay with playing that role considering all they gave us was this preachy uninspired waste of time.
THANK YOU REESE! this brought me to tears, my son got married Sept.2020 , Also my daughter's free style figure skating program was to this music while she competed in the 90s, as we loved the movies .  here i am alone thinking of my 2 wonderful adult children in this pandemic.
Thank you so much!
Please make the full length movie!!!!! The original movies are my ultimate favorites!!!!! I can watch them over and over and still laugh and cry. The casting is perfect, the writing is perfect and now with the babies grown up please please please how about giving us a double wedding for both of the babies all grown up now?????
I. WANT. A. FotB3-MOVIE !!!!
Rachel's dad could be 2x worse than George!
@Netflix get the schedules, get a schedule,and do it!
He definitely is  caulking!
Gish dang it, why the hell am I crying. I’m a dumbass 😂😂
Kieran Culkin looks way younger than Ben Platt. C'mon now LOL
OMG!!! I cried so hard, all the way through ❤️ I can’t believe I can this, but I remember when the first movie came out while I was planning my wedding. Then the second movie came out while my mother-in-law and I were both pregnant together at the same time. Watching this puts everything into perspective at how many years have passed. Our children are grown...some are even married and I have grandchildren now. Loved this!! And yes!! Sequel please ☺️👍❤️🥰
Loved these  film I have them on dvds this just awesome
This is one of the best thing to come out of 2020! I LOVE THIS..Need i say make THE MOVIE.
Loved Father of the Bride but Martin Short’s Franc is one of my favorite characters of all tine
This is so amazing. This needs to be converted into an actual movie. This was d best😍😍😍😍😍😍
This was too cute 😍
I loved the movies. Love seeing all of them again
I can't believe how much I needed this. Such nostalgia, it felt like Christmas. I'm not sure any decade will ever beat the 90s!  What a great way for a great cast to come together for such a great cause. 🎉
Okay, this is what perfect acting is! 🤍💯 I didn't want this to end 🥺
Looooove this!
BEN!!!! PLATT!!!!!
Perfection
Love love loved it💕
We miss these types of movies!! Bring back to 90s! We had enough of these meanless new generation movies! I pray that none of these cast members pass away as this movie has to happen 🙏
we all needed this ♥ thank you so much netflix! also netflix please make father of the bride 4! ♥ plus this really means a lot to me because today was the anniversary of my mom's passing. we went to see the first two films together in the theaters back in the 90's so this is really special for me to see this ♥
Loved this! Thanks.  (Side note:could have left out nutbag DeNiro)
Are these kids real?
This is very sweet. I know this is to raise money. Some day would like to see a full length movie part 3. Nice to see the cast.
Once this thing is over (I pray that it will be) they have to do this as a full movie and have some of the money go to the foundation they are raising money for. This is so good.
Growing up Father of the Bride was a must watch every holiday season and this just made my year!!  I really hope after this, Father of Bride Part 3 can be actually made!
That was soo good!
Please do another movie!! So beautiful
I may be a bit tipsy, but keeping this family tree straight is hard. But I digress, I love everything about this.
Omg, it was liking watching a mini-movie and I can't believe how emotional I became!  The same reaction I had with the other two!  You guys are amazing.  Please make it a whole movie!
Please make a 3. I loved every minute of this.
Love it ❤️
Okay I’m trying my best not to cry. This was absolutely beautiful!!
Amazing! Thank you all for doing this, bringing back great memories and creating new ones!! Love you all!
My heart is melting right now💕💕..
I think the public would LOVE a Father of the Bride 3!!   I'd see it in a heartbeat.
Gosh I LOVE these movies soooo much and this reunion was perfect!!!!! 😭😍
Awwww...today was uber rough, and the week so long. But this, this brought back so many memories. This right here felt like a family reunion, full of warm loving hugs. And everyone still the same.  Thank you! 💜💜💜
I just loved it, you guys are amazing
Why can’t this be a movie why did this have to be like this ugh
I love this ‼️
Thank you, we needed that.❤️
Thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful part 3ish sequel. Great job everyone! Very sweet ❤
This emoji is my reaction to this: 🙄
I wish they would make a father of the bride 3. I love that movie.
oh my gosh this was so cathartic for me! I had  no idea how much ai needed this today! This was incredible and so much nostalgia! Please please please make this a full movie! Oh I love this so much! I want to hug all of them and thank them all for bringing light back into my heart! I missed them all so much!
This is really, really, really......STUPID!  No.
This got me so emotional. Gosh, the nostalgia!
Just beautiful 😍
And I didn't know he could sing like that!
A zoom wedding? Oh god, can 2020 get any weirder?
I can’t like this enough! I really enjoyed this.
That was great! 😊😉
Please make this a full movie.Time to rewatch Father of the Bride ❤️💙
I absolutely love this it was great it made me cry
I literally grew up watching this movie and only  recently i knew that annie is Brad Paisley's wife, one of my favourite artists, that makes it more exciting😄
At least George doesn't have to see anyone naked on his zoom call. Lol
This was so sweet!
Omg that made me cry! I love father of the bride!
I am crying my eyes out!!! I’m watching Father of the Bride tonight!!!!!
Omg. We need more of this
Brilliant - Full Movie please and thanks ☺️☺️☺️☺️
" It was her moms💍..." 😭 🥰👌
Dang I didn't see that flashback coming.. 😥😭😭
i dont even remember what happened in 1 and 2 but im kinda teary over this!
One the movies of my childhood.. the cast is amazing and the soundtrack always gives me chills!! Thank you so much for the memories, love from Italy🇮🇹🍾
Is ths a movie or wht ?
Amazing, thank you so much Netflix & YouTube for this. ♥️😭
This was just brilliant ♥️♥️♥️
I can't believe I never heard of this and just happen to come upon it when not being able to fall asleep tonight! It's wonderful!  It's touching and funny, made me LOL and cry.  I really hope that once they're able to, they actually make a Father of the Bride part 3, make this the very beginning of the movie and then go from there. I think whether it's released in theaters or Netflix, it would be a fantastic hit!
So cool love it.
BEST thing to happen in Quarantine! 👏👏👏👏👏🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
After the pandemic we better get the full 3rd
I have missed this family as much as my own! We demand a film guys! X
I can't believe how great this is!
Maybe the dislikes were because it wasn’t a full feature movie 🎥 & they wanted (like the majority who watched) more of the extended Banks family.
Omg....im bawling over here. Who would have thought this would have been so moving. Can we really get a part 3....well part 4 now?
I need this to be a weekly thing!! Also, I will always be on George’s side.
Can't wait for Megan Banks wedding!!
Thank you to the entire cast for a wonderful trip down memory lane.  This was truly so well done!
I love how Mattie recited the vows exactly as Frank was saying them! 🥰😂 So funny!
Oh my heart, the *music* is just the best.
Very sweet short little clip but I do wish that they could have made a Father of The Bride part 3 maybe one day next year
😂😂😂
Omg... this is amazing
This makes me feel so old! I love these movies. ❤
Coming from a 1984 🍼 baby, I really miss the 90’s :(
Oh my I just saw this pop up and clicked faster than anything & loved it 🥰🥲🤩
This is AWESOME!
Crying this is so beautiful and perfect
NETFLIX!!!, WE CHALLENGE YOU TO MAKE THE FULL-LENGTH MOVIE!!!!! C'MON!!!!
NetFlicks you finally did something right !  Thank You for this wonderful gift ❤️❤️Some of my favorite movies of all time ,George Banks set the bar for all fathers .  Please make this a full length film .
❤️❤️
I absolutely loved and needed this ❤️🥰
Late to the party, but happy I got to see this🥰😘🙏
Loved this!!!!  Thanks for making it! Will donate.  Please make more though!  Just great!❤️
The Culkins never age either I’m in shock with Steve Martin 😮
The only thing I didn't like about the first film was when George was outside arranging the car parking and missed most of his daughter's wedding. I thought that was very sad for him. But the rest of the movie and Fotb 2 were wonderful. And soo funny.
Yaaaaaasssss!!! Ready for it!!
Remakes of movies are seldom as good, but this one exceeds even or in spite of De Niro
Please make the movie!!!
I love this! I wish they would do a movie about this one.
Highlight of 2020❣️😭
Loving this!
This zoom call is not hitting it.
Don't like it. Blah.
Why am I crying on my sofa - just donate it's a good thing
Why am I crying?

I love everything about this! I rented the Father of the Bride movies so much from Blockbuster that my mom actually told me to rent something else. I need this to be a full length movie.
Ahhh...memory lane.🥰
That was AWESOME!!!   Loved Father of the Bride and Father of the Bride II!!!!
I like Annie George Nina his son
Diane, you look great.  Great to see Steve who is such a talented man.
If this doesn’t become a real feature length movie I AM GOING TO BE SO BUMMED OUT!!! THIS IS THE MOVIE I DIDN’T KNOW I NEEDED!
I LOVE THIS!!!!
Matty should have been gay
my heart is crying
Oh god, this made me miss my childhood😭 they don't make heart family movies like this anymore
Omg loved this! In tears 😭 Hoping for a real part 3 of this movie.

I loved it so much!!!! You need to really make this movie 🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yes, yes, yes!
Sorry, I was bored.
Wow. This was everything we needed as a 2020 antidote.
What month and day   2020 will it appear on Netflix?
Incredible 🥰🥰
Best thing in all of quarantine.
stopped what I was supposed to do when I saw this on my recommendations! i need a full movie! and Florence is the daughter  <3
❤️😢
This movie definitely undecided!
I loved the past two movies.
This is the best thing I have seen in such a long time!! Happy cried throughout the whole thing 😭😭😭
I've never even watched Father of the Bride but this made me cry
This is brilliant I love this and I love the Father of the Bride movies we all seriously need a part 3❤
I'll hug you in 2021 is like foreshadowing of full length part 3 FOTB!!!  🤙 wooohooo
I wish my zoom calls had an orchestration like this
Loved this so much, gave me the same feels as 1 and 2
Looking forward to watching this.  I love Father of the Bride.  Can't wait to see it.
Omg... I enjoyed this so much....thanks for the tears and laughter...🤗❤🇹🇹
I need a real movie where they actually get married. I love this so much
WE NEED THIS, WE NEED FOTB 3 ASAP.
Am crying here. So wonderful. Saw both movies in Cinema back then. Now guys there MUST be a 4th movie! Please :-) ...
Just beautiful 🥰
I love this and I'm so happy too see steve Martin and Diane keaton
Weird . But I love.this cast and the movies
This made me stupidly happy. I DID NOT KNOW THIS WAS MISSING FROM MY LIFE AND NOW I AM COMPLETE
I lost it when DeNiro came in
Awww this 😭😭❤️
This made me feel so good. So happy to see the cast hear the music . Blessings to you all. Father of bride Forever💜💜
What not to do during covid.
They need to make it a full-length movie
Guys please make a third. This short is a perfect springboard for another movie. It's amazing to have 1&2 to go back to, you know whatever's happening in your life these characters will always be there for you like family friends. As soon as the music came in on this video all the emotions from the first 2 came flooding back. Please make this happen.
I love Fronck!!!
Thank you I needed that
Full feature please!!!! Damn it after the year we've had...we deserve it😭😭🤞🤞🤞
This was awesome! 💚💚💚
One of my all time favorite movies. I have both and we need part 3.♥️♥️♥️
Love it
When I saw it in the suggested vids, I actually thought it was the first movie broken up in parts and thought to myself, “Finally! It’s on YouTube! I can watch it in parts!” Well what a sweet, pleasant surprise to see that was not the case! This warmed my heart so much and made me teary! I love how they 1) kept the same actors and 2) included all the characters (like the babies)! Soooo good! I wanna see this as a full length movie!!
Franck was always my favorite character
I love these movies so much!! I’d watch them over and over on the VHS! And I agree with the comment section: this needs to be an actual movie!!
Oh my gosh, I’m like crying over here!!!
😩❤️😇
Love this! Made me cry!
Cried!!!
Left together right together classic
What a letdown
No veo la hora de verla 🥺
❤❤❤❤👏👏👏👏👏
I love Martin short and he’s hysterical in this movie
This is Rosa Diaz approved.
I would LOVE a Father of the Bride 3!!!!!
Thank you so much for this priceless gift!!
Thanks for this. Really. Thank you. 💞🎉
When George goes and puts on the coat.... love EVERYTHING about this !!!!✨✨✨✨❤️
Yoooo. I was skeptic!! But this was sooooo great!!?
Wow. What a creative idea, story line!! :)))People will save money doing this in real life too!!!
Steve Martín is incredible
I like Robert De Ninero's beard.
The only one hoo stands out is Steve Martin.
This made me so happy 🥰😭😭😭
This was wonderful.  Now they really should make Father of The Bride 3. Please!! 😍❤
Not funny
Why am I teary eyed! This was amazing! Thank you 😊
💜
My daughter used to watch the video CONSTANTLY. her older brother finally hid it so she couldn’t watch it anymore. We were all going around asking what happened to the video???? Months later I found it under the living room sofa cushions. Haha. I still love this movie so much.
My heart is so full from this. ♥️
Oh, those movies are awesome!
Great well done!...i hope they make a full movie
2:54 I though she said "How is sobriety going?" and I was like whaaat!!!
I'm not crying you are 😭😭😭😭
Surpraise!  Love Fronck
How wonderful to give us this treat.
Ah, it’s Rachael Meghan Markle !
How sweet
I smiled and cried through the whole thing. This family makes me so happy! Love you all YouTube family! Let’s stay safe and healthy for each other😷😘☮️
Love this movie. 😍
Now we have a story to do the third sequel , the characters and the place, just focus people and we will have a great movie from Netflix at Tuscany!
Omg this made me so emotional. Loved this.
Omg I'm gona have to dig dvd player and disks out from somewhere now best films ever made defo need to make this one into a feature film xxx
This is awesome.  I wish they would make another movie.  But a great sweet surprise
How is it that I am crying because of a Zoom movie?
I loved this soooo much!!! I really hope they make a full length film soon!!
Steve martin ❤
What a beautiful movie...... ish 😊
Need need so need Father of the Bride Part 3❤️❤️
Well that was emotional 😭😭😭😭
Favourite movie of all time ❤️
Omg please can we get a part 3?! My favorite movie of all time❤️❤️
That is top class
I wanna cry so badly rn but I’m sitting with my family😭😭😂  Want a father of the bride 3 pleaseeeeee
Thank you so much for this. ♥️
Ben Platt looks forty in this
Ohhhh my gosh this made me so happy and cry happy tears💕💕💕
😭 I seriously cried this was too freakin sweet! Loved watching this two great movies with my mom.
It was great!!! Loved it. It's amazing how over this situation we can still be creative. I enjoyed it a lot. And I agree with all, Steve Martin doesn'r age at all!!!
oh if I could just give everyone there a great big hug!...
Awww Ben Platt ! ❤️
now these are actors!!  👏🏼👏🏼 Great job!  oh my gosh, when she opened her momma's ring 😭
This is amazing!🤍 The Banks family still got it 💖 This is such and iconic movie that never gets old and hopefully, this is just a teaser for a real movie with everyone in🤗. Thank you for doing this.⭐️❤️
We SO needed this!
🤣
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I thought this was so lame until I heard him say her father gets out of paying for a wedding 🤣
beautiful
WHY AM I CRYING?!
“I’m in sweats for Matty’s wedding!” 😂
The trickery!!I definitely thought an actual Part 3 movie was being announced. I even text my Mom with all the excitement 😂😂😂 Please do it for real @Netflix!!! I will personally help with production lol
Oh I like this . This would be so super cute if the whole covid thing really was a pandemic instead of just a weird psyop leading the world into communist directions.
I can say only one thing: THIS IS GENIUS!!!
Awwww I want another movie
Oh I loved this!
I was one of the babies in Father of the Bride part 2. Baby Megan!!! I am bummed I didn't get a call about this. I would love to have been a part of this. Crazy 25 years later.
would love a 3rd movie😍 please make it HAPPEN! This movie is a classic can't help but get emotional watching both movies. Steve Martin's character was the ultimate "girl dad" loved his and Annie's relationship!❤
This made my day! ❤️ Thank you so much from South Africa 🌍
I will always recognize and feel the music and score of this movie for as long as I live.
Omgosh I love this! I wish they would make a part 3. One of my favorite family movies. And when Georgie sings omgosh I'd about cried. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
That was very good the magic was all there.
I loved this! So cute! Now I'm going to watch the first two movies!❤❤
Beautiful & touching short movie 😭
After 25 years, this short film still managed to capture the magic we all loved so much in the first movies! But I think what I absolutely loved the most, was while it showed how their families are dealing with the pandemic (making this story so relatable), there wasn’t a political agenda being forced on the audience from either the right or the left. Entertainment at its best, disconnected from politics! Well done, hope to see this made into a full length film!
🥰😍❤️👏👍
Awww this is soooo cute! See this is how you do a sequel or continuation of a series or movie!👏👏👏 Stick to the original magic! What we fell in love with! they integrated this seamlessly with the original rambling the dad does and all the actors and even the current pandemic. This is so good they could do the whole part three like this and Id be here for it if they do some in person scenes as well somehow.
What a wonderful surprise!
Hoping there will be a reboot one of my all time favorite franchises!
This is amazing I love it!!
Why am I crying so hard
😍😍
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 that was a lot of fun we definitely need the 3rd and NOT ISH Part LIKE NOW, it was crazy good
Always a favourite
I got married in May of 1991 and my dad was just like George . I remember watching the movie a few weeks before I got married and cried my eyes out . In 1995 I found myself pregnant and I remember going to the movies to see it a few weeks before the baby was born . Watching this made me cry as we are move to the next phase in my life . Love the movie !
So they all forgot how to act the last 20 years?
So beautiful and heartfelt. I LOVE how much this moved me. It’s what we all needed during this crazy, crazy time of 2020. Thank you.
I shouldn't love this...but I do.  With the exception of the mask bit (which screamed Steve Martin wanting to clown) everyone embodied the characters perfectly.  And Anne didn't change...she just happened to react to George...
Robert Deniro??? Ugh
why did i get emotional
This is the greatest thing I’ve seen in a long time!
So creative and extremely well made!!!
This is my Dad 😂
💛💛💛💛💛❤️ Wow...so well done. Loved it!
Love it!
Why am I crying!!!!!!!! i love this!!!!
I would love to watch the making of this movie...
Guys.. Plz make dis a movie..
This 👏🏽 was 👏🏽 amazing 👏🏽 I cried when he began singing. I needed this! Love FOTB aaahhhh let’s get this Netflix!!!
Bravo! ❤️
Wait did dad freeze? 😂
Frunk!!!!!!!
Y’all best zoom proposal!!! Maddie is such a romantic!!!
Do y’all notice George!’s mid life crisis hat on his desk!!!
Look at Maddie following in his sisters footsteps!!!
Bryan looks the same!!!!
I can’t believe they had Ben Platt, and Amy from Little Women!!!!! I’ve missed this!!!
Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!! I absolutely loved this!!!!! Plz plz plz do a part 4 soon!!!!!!
😭 Absolutely LOVED it!! I laughed and made me cry 😭
Release part 3 for real real
This is great!!!   if you think that Father of The pride 1 was done in 1991!!!   and Fotb 2 was in 1995 ... now the son!!  :D :D :D  now the last girl!!
This is just amazing!!! The FOB franchise is GOLD! Thank you Netflix. A full length feature film would be the best!
Full length movie Please!! We want more !!! They all look great. Steve you are just the best thing ever! Love you 💙❤️💜🧡💚💛
Nobody realized - Kieran Culkin did his brother's scream from Home Alone (film series)??? 🤣 Also, seeing Ben Platt was so awesome..😍
That was the sweetest!! Made me cry, love the father of the bride movies!
Ben Platt as Georgie?!  YES! He,  Alexandra, and Florence were such a wonderful addition.  Was James teasing George about a hug in 2021 a hint? Do we have a full length in the making?
Love, love love this :)
Donated...guys.
OMG... Father of the Bride 1 & 2 are great! 😀 And making #3 ish for a good cause: is amazing! Netflix is awesome and these actors & actresses too. Loved the way they were able to reunite all the most important characters of these movies. 🤗
We need Father of the bride or groom 3!!!! ❤️
I didn't know how much I have been longing for Father of the bride 3 until just now... Netflix, I will never forgive you if you're not make this happen for real. But until then, thank you! I love it
I loveeeeddd this! Got me all in my feelings
This was truly funny and romantic and I cried as well. Thank you 😊🌸🇦🇺
Such a treat! Thank you! This was so needed from all that’s going on in the world, even if only for 25 minutes.   And it finally makes sense where I’ve seen Bryan before! (the one with the Yeti from Friends) 😂❤️
This was so sweet and awesome. I really needed this. 💗💐🤗👰
THANK YOU FOR THIS. Like many said.. Didn't know I needed this right now 😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Oh, I am so much in love with this beautiful move " Father of the Bride " just love every bit of the movie and every actor in the movie ...Nina, George & Franck they all still look still so wonderful
My mom went into labor with my sister watching the first one. My wife went into labor watching the 2nd years later. Life is a trip.
Happy to see them grow! =)
Me creerían que me dieron ganas de llorar. Ternurita!!!
That was AWESOME!!!! I am a huge huge fan of the first two films and an even bigger fan of the cast especially Martin Short...all of them.  I need a full length version now 😩
This is a very good movie, for the family gathering together stay together!!!..i felt crying...🥺🥺🥺
that was cute. and for all the live chatters that is Kieran Culkin not Macaulay
Beautiful wish it was longer.
This is wonderful. I have loved these movies. This is not long enough💕😷
Kieran Culkin got me in the feels. The nostalgia 😍
G!!! Witherspoon, you are everywhere!!!
Next full length movie should be father of the bride part 3 and a half and be Megan getting married Edit: and while they are preparing for the wedding Matty and his wife are pregnant
This is so sweet, I love a Steve Martin voice over 😭😍 and I definitely cried.
Why does Steve Martin looks like he hasn't aged in 20 Years?
Please! We want a new Movie of this!!
Very impressive
😂
😂
We need a full length film...in Tuscany!
This is and awesome movie is kinda funny but still a good movie
That was incredible, didn't think I'd get so emotional!  I forgot Diane Keaton was in that movie, love her!   Are these "sequels" happening a lot??   Such a great idea, and so clever and well made given the circumstances, and just perfect!  :)
I WANT A THE WHOLE MOVIE!!! I LOVED THIS!!!! 😭😭💞💞LOL
Thank you!!!  I really needed this. ♥️
Wait is Mattie McCauley Culkins brother.....

I didn't know how much I needed to see this. Thank you so much
Why is no one talking about Martin Short as Franck🥺He got all dressed up and everything😂❤️

Matt's expressions brings me to tears!
Brilliant!!!!! We need a full movie!!!!!!

Please do another film! I love all these characters. Watched this all the time with my mum when I was a kid. Thank you for creating this for charity!
FotB 3 plot: Meghan marries a woman. Therefore there will be 2 fathers of brides... George goes crazy... until he reconciles with current times
This is just sad... not this awesome short film... but the cruelty of these times whereas we can not live nor die with our loves one.
❤❤❤❤

Omg I can't stop crying... I'm So emotional Right now.. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT 💖 This is still one of my all time fave movies ever......  It was so well written and fun to watch😍.... Congrats Matty!!!!! Please Netflix, make another movie of Father of the Bride. This brings so many good memories of growing up watching this movie.

This one is priceless
Love both movies
This seriously needs to be a full length movie. 🙏🙏🙏🙏
That was Awesome and Beautiful... Just loved it!
Wonderful
Awful vibrato
This was the most Touching Clip I have Seen. I Cried through it all.
"This (short) film works so well simply because every moment of it is suffused with the joy of seeing familiar faces through a zoom meeting. Despite only being 25 minutes, it couldn't be more appropriate for family viewing or  post cotial cuddles." - ghost of Gene Siskell maybe.
This CASTING. I'm SOBBING.
I literally laughed out loud and cried!! This brought my heart so much joy and warmth!! Please consider a full length movie!! ❤️❤️❤️
I LOVE THIS!!!  Been waiting for too many years to see what came of the Banks family.  This is still my all-time favorite movie.  Please please please make a full length feature of this family.... after covid!   I need a new favorite movie after almost thirty years!!!!

I'm not crying - you're crying! Ok no really, I am crying. I am so glad I checked Steve Martin's twitter or I wouldn't have seen this - These are my favourite movies of all time, and it is so wonderful to see everyone again!!! Even if it is on zoom lol! I have donated!

I'm excited for this 3rd part❤
I was expecting George to walk behind Nina and be together on Zoom 😭😭 then I remembered....  iIt’s gonna take a while for me to accept the babies are now 25 YEARS OLD!!!!
Yes this needs to be  a movie when the world  gets back to normal  I love  Steve Martin  and  diane Keaton
They should turn this into a serious like Cobra Kia
I'm not crying, you're crying 😭 loved this so much
Simply WONDERFUL!

Thank you to all who worked to make this possible!  It is exactly what the last quarter turn of 2020 needed - a smile, a laugh and the shedding of one more tear but this time for joy! ☺️
It would be great father of the Bride 3.  I Love Steve MARTIN ♥
Steve Martin is a musician as well as being funny
That Alan Silvestri score is just so good... Martin Short has always been the best part of these movies for me, I love his character
Can we have the feel good movies of the 90’s back please!
How can I ever thank you for this, Netflix??? Loved it so much!

need this movie soon -🧡😢🧡🧡💕
I always loved these movies!! I love this soooo much!!!❤️❤️❤️
I love this so much,i cried😭😭♥️♥️
Agree. This needs to be a full movie. I miss all of them 💞
Why can't you put colony season 3 on Netflix what's the point of having the other 2 seasons when you can't finish it arching the whole thing thick af? From the UK so can't watch it anywhere else sort it out
This was amazing. Definitely need a FOTB 3. The cast looks incredible.
Thank you so much to all the actors and actresses and folks who put this together, it’s been such a horrific year of losses and we needed something like this.  Thank you thank you.🙏🏻❤️
i love it
When are you making the 2 season of jurasic World camp. My brother needs to see it he bothers to much
That was amazing! So needed and so appreciated!!!
So sweet! Tearing up! I needed this!❤️I loved all of these movies so much!! Please make this into a movie!!!💕❤️❤️
rach's sis ?
Hurray!! Father Of The Bride 1 & 2 are two of my favorite movies, stellar cast, this was just what the doctor ordered (the new doctor in the Banks Family!!), I loved the birth twins, all grown up and DeNiro as the new Father of the Braid, haha, Martin Short always gets me laughing 😂, with his ridiculous accent, I wonder if Catherine O’Hara studied her old SCTV pal, Marty’s accent, for hilarious Moira Rose?!? This was so sweet and nostalgic, Thank You so much & a full length movie 🎥 on Netflix would be spectacular!! And weddings for Ben Plat & Florence Pugh too please!! Maybe a Series, with lots of funny episodes??❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This was so great! Loved the first 2 movies, and love this! Thank you, for a bright light, in a dismal world 🌞
Aw, that was really sweet.
I couldn't stop smiling.
Netflix promotes pedophilia
This is What America needs Right Now😁😁😁Seeing them all grown up.
Netflix is going under for showcasing child porn on their forum.
I just love the music to this 🎥.   George Banks
I'm at work tearing up to this
Dammit, where’s my tissue?!
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE make a full length film instead of this short version. I love that you brought us up to 2020, but we need more! We need a " Father of the Bride--Groom!" so we can see Matty's REAL wedding! I am begging you....please do it!!!
Hey, I think you should put "this is us" from One direction back on Netflix
This is the most wonderful thing I've seen all year ❤❤❤❤❤

Propaganda

That was wonderful!
He still have one daughter, one grandson, and a wedding reception for his son to held, so father of the bride 4 (?) Is still possible right

I love this so much!! I watched part 2 last night!
I laughed, I cried.. This made my 2020!! Father of the Bride 1&2 are my favorite movies, been wanting Part 3 for years! Thank you to the cast & Netflix for this! Hoping for a movie when the pandemic is finally over!
Fantastic!
This is the most wonderful thing I've seen all year!! Thank you so much for making this, I absolutely loooove it <3 <3 <3
This was absolutely perfect!!
Seeing this FOTB PART 3ish was exactly what I needed to see..... along with thousands of others who love the Banks family!! The memories it brought back by seeing the clips from Parts 1 and 2 were perfect and wanting a Part 3 all the more!! It's time and this cast is beyond great. I'd love to see Franck's assistant Howard Weinstein (B. D. Wong) come back too. But mostly, I'd just love for Part 3ish become a full on FOTB PART 3!!! Great movie with a great cast!! In the meantime,  I'll be watching Part 3ish over and over again.
Bravo, this was wonderful!
OMG please Netflix you need to do this movie,, the cast is perfect!!!thank you for this gift!
AWESOME! Is there a FULL Length of this movie or this is it? They all aged beautifully. I still have my DVDs and now I need to watch again the FOTB 1 and 2.
We need an actual movie omgggg
This made me feel nostalgic as hell
Woooooaaaahhhhh 🥰 Thanks for this part 3 (ish)
LOVED IT!
Please please please let there be an actual 3rd movie in the works!!!
2020 ew corona
I'm expecting a full length feature after this. Don't let us down!
Money hest season 5
OMG! I just showed this movie to my friends, part 1 & 2 during Covid-19, and was wishing they would make a part 3 in today's time. Loved this movie as a kid and still love it. We need more family movies like this. And I was wondering one day what Kimberly Paisley was up too recently and saw her on the THE FLASH and Dolly Heartstrings. This needs to be a movie please.
Love these movies and hope they make another. This was amazing but not enough❤❤❤
All of this politics talk is making me sick
TRUMP 2020
I have both movies 1 and 2. I just love seeing this "Family". I Love the Banks!!! <3 PLEASE bring on the 3rd movie!!!
Please Netflix, make this happen :) There's a "baby" daughter that can now also be a bride <3
Please PLEASE make a part 3 movie!!! Please!!!!
Very heartwarming! Something we all need!
LOVE!!
Omg i loved this 😭❤
One of my all time favorite movies! I so needed this ❤️
Father of the bride films was what made me want to have kids. Then, I changed my mind. I might consider having them. If i meet the right person.
Oh my gosh... loved it!! Made so happy to see all of them and the music... 😍 took me back to the first time I watched it.
This is like a woooooooosiiiiiiiiiiiii I needed this omg I'm I'm smiling from ear to ear.. the laughing and crying at the same time was sooooo worth it hhhhhhhhhhh
I don't understand how 1.4K people dislikes this what is wrong with them? I liked it!
Kieran Culkin was the cutest little kid!
Please Netflix. Can you add spanish subtitles? I want to show this masterpiece to my family!! :D
AHHH 😭❤ AMAZING!! BRILLIANT!! WONDERFUL!!! Thank you to the cast, netflix, Nancy and Reese. Seriously this was amazing 😭❤ This movie really is my fave movie of all time. Lost my dad 2months before my 9th birthday and watching this movie seeing Annie's and George's bond was something i really longed for 😭 something i always imagine having with my dad that's why this movie has a special place in my heart ❤ started getting teary eyed when George was reminiscing 😭 my god those flashback brings so many emotions 😭 no matter how old we are, to our parents we'll always be their little girl/boy 😭❤ and also the way Annie's theme is playing throughout the video ahhhh so nostalgic 😭 cant help but get teary eyed but really lost it when Ben played The Way You Look Tonight 😭😭 oh how i wished my dad was here 😭 anyway congrats Matty and Rachel ❤🥂 hope we get a 4-ish with Megan, the baby of the family(make it happen Netflix!!). It's been a real treat to have this reunion ❤ was really worried about the quality and how they will do it through zoom. Lol i even thought it was only going to be an interview but my goodness they did amazing 😭👏👍 they managed to get the same feeling as before. I still got teary eyed just like the first two movies. 👏😭 and my goodness Kimberly does not age at all she looks so damn beautiful 😭😭❤
I can't believe that this 25min Father of the Bride 3 clip can make me cry 😭😭😭 And I will forever love George and Annie 😍
日本語字幕をつけてください。 お願いします。 スティーブマーティンは素晴らしい！
Fix the 100 season 7 ep 15
I didn’t know that I wanted  this  but so hear for it.
This was very sweet like the first two films. We need more movies like The Father of the Bride films.
So cried at the Matty flashbacks. Damn George does it to me every time.
Please do a movie, I'm begging you. I cried, laughed and I wanted to hug everyone here. Thank you Netflix. This was the last movie I watched with my dad before his death of almost a year because of my sister's wedding that happened just before the pandemic. This really meant A LOT to me. Take care everyone! Let's take care of each other!
Loved this and I totally cried!!!!
😆
Now I need to watch Father of the Bride 1&2 :)
This left me nostalgic for FOTB and the early days of pandemic when people were taking it as seriously as George
I have been looking for this short movie for a week now ... Today show said Netflix, or maybe that's all I heard...but I'm positive MANY fans like myself are still waiting for it to be shown on Netflix. Please, please, bring it to Netflix!!!!  I held it together til George's speech about Mattie...😭😭😭🥰🥰🥰...Quarantine perfection!!! Thank you Nancy Meyers!! DeNiro... brilliant casting!!
I loved this!! Reminds me of how much I loved Father of the Bride and it is great everybody reunited!! I cried with a smile on my face!!
This was exactly what I needed so much nostalgia, the original films are so good!! There needs to be a father of the bride 3 after seeing this!!
That was so much fun!! I donated to WCK as a way to say THANK YOU for creating this. It was such a joy to watch! Time to rewatch parts 1 and 2. Let's have a part 4!
Wonderful and uplifting full of laughter too. Something to give us joy in a difficult time.
That was so darling! Steve Martin is still so dang funny and Diane Keaton *gasp*. She is as elegant as ever. Now we need a whole movie. Thank you!
Loved this so much!  2020 needed this.  PLEASE make a part 3!!!
Oh my heart 😭❣
Hi
Cheered me up a lot
Loved it so goooddd
This shouldn't have made me cry and get this emotional but MAN, IT SURE DID. I'm not even all the way done yet. I hope they can do a longer one day.
OMG I loved this! Steve Martin is the best!
LOVE THIS!  OMG
This is super cute. I love it.
I’m not crying! You are! 😭😭😭😘🥰😍
Omg omg omg. Please Netflix. Make this happen in a full length film ASAP.
She’s gotta be black... such a shocker.
Thank you. I needed this more than you know. :) Blessings to everyone who made this possible.
Wow this is great! Full length movie please!
This is great! So many great flashbacks. Classic! Original characters too! Great surprise ending song! Had to watch again like parts 1 and 2. Sentimental (tears) Gives us hope during this time. About to watch 1 for the 10th time. Hehe.
I'm inside, sitting on the couch, and it's raining on my face. Why is it raining on my face? Netflix, when social/physical distancing is over, and we can hug/kiss/squeeze/punch/etc people again, please make this a reality!!!
Navy Myers is brilliant she managed to make a movie that takes place during a pandemic happy and up fitting. I would love to see a full length father of the bride 4th installment or anything else that Nancy decides to create
well done!
Netflix Cancel Cuties!!!! what's wrong with you??? It's  Awful!!!! Don't you get people like good, wholesome,decent movies... Not movies portraying children as sexual objects!!!!!
Loved it!!!! Where was B. D. Wong, Frank's assistant???
I’d love to see a feature length version of this some how
I love this, I hope there is going to be Father of the Bride 3 someday. I have been a huge fan since the beginning.☺️
I so looooved this ♥️ Thanks to all
I walked down the aisle to this same music and only did it because of this film. So of course I cried to seeing this moment for Matty! I thank Netflix for this so much!!
PLIS, DON'T MIX POLITICS WITH CONAN THE BARBARIAN IN THE NEW SERIE
Absolutely amazing!!!!
Philip Defranco Show sent me here!
This was so, so phenomenal! Thanks to you all!
I actually loved this so much 💕🥰 need more touching movies like these
My niece just told me about this.  I'm here.
Omg!!! ❤️❤️❤️
I loved this!!!!!!!
Matty is adorable!
I didn't know that there was a "Father of the Bride part 3".
Yo guys benez see my site
I've waited 20 years for a sequel. This made me so happy.
If my boyfriend did this to me, we would be done.
Missing wong tho
Don't forget to donate!!!
This brings me so much joy
One of my all time favorite movies
A+ cast.
I Enjoyed it I used to watch 1 & 2 all the time and how could 1.3K dislikes it, It was good and the people disliked it well you have no taste!
We need a full movie now. This is so awesome!!
They should totally make a sequel with Megan marrying a girl or just having her girlfriend come meet her family, I would love that ❤️
lame..... lol
We need father of the groom!!
Low key teared up thinking of my kids.
Cheesy and corny as hell but so so sweet! We need more of this!
Simply lovely!! 🥰
PLEASE DO A SCP FILM WE GEN Z BEG U
Please please please this story needs to continue.  Thank you for the joy this story brings.
Full length movie please 🤗
I love this so so much! Thank you for making this happen. I feel hope again. ❤️
Ok that's was so good and yes I'd love to see an actual Father of the bride 3 full length movie. I loved the first two so much. As a bride that was so blessed to have not one but two Father's walk me down the isle. The first two movies will always be special to me that showed the relationship between Father or in my case Father's of the Bride. Never let it be said that a step Father cannot love his daughter as much as the biological father does.
is this netflix trying to make up for sexualizing 11 year old girls and promoting pedophilia?
But seriously can we get a Father Of The Bride 3?
I can’t explain how happy I am right now, I remember watching this sequel with my parents during my childhood.  This special saved 2020.
I want full length. 😭
I love these movies, and yes we need a full length movie ASAP! These movies are full of family love and all parents feel this way when their child grows up and marry. I love them so much it pulls on your heartstrings! We needed this as a nation. Thank you
Oh my god this is soooo beautiful! My childhood come full circle! We need more of this, an actual movie please!
Awww I got all the feels with this one!!
Q lindo...espero por está continuação há anos..Amo Steve Martin..🇧🇷
Netflix. I see what you did here. If you were afraid and wondering if people would want a full feature flim, the answer is YES! The teaser confirms it! At least I hope it's a teaser. I need more!
With all the nonsense happening in this country and being thoroughly depressed about it all, this is the one thing that actually gave me a sense of hope and made me smile. Thumbs up to the Banks!!!!
I'd watch this movie alone for Florence Pugh 😍. But everyone in this loved the chemistry between the cast it's gold!
If they would all get together and do another movie I would so be there for that! I love this family!
It’s time for a feel good reunion movie.
Omg that was brilliant X
💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓 Also, Storm!!!
Need an official Father of the Bride 3!!!
This was my favourite film growing up so I'm so excited to watch this!
My all time favorite movie series!!! After watching these when I was a teen I always hoped that true love was really out there for me! So glad this was made!
I have always dreamed of a part 3. Please let it happen! It’s a whole new world than when Annie got married. No reason we can go through it again with Meghan....or maybe a double wedding with George too.
Love it!!! made me cry a little....xoxo
Omg I loved this ❤️ I hope we get a part 3 ❤️😘
Wow. Diane Keaton is so perfect even after all this time. She's fantastic.
I like the sentiment behind this, but I didn’t appreciate the propaganda behind it. Also the fact that they killed off the only potential person of complete color Saddens me 😢
Once this pandemic is over. This needs to be a movie. Steve Martin vs Deniro. With Martin Short in the middle. YES PLEASE.
I low key want to be a Culkin. But also want Diane Keaton to be my mom. And want Kimberley Paisly to be my sister.
THIS IS TOO MUCH, loved it.
Absolutely wonderful! I loved it and almost cried. Hope they make a movie that everyone can see. :)
This made me so, so happy!  Thanks to all involved, and the new cast is perfect!  Please make Part 3... the world needs it!
Ben Platt is so adorable especially with a beard
I can’t believe Brian ended up working for B613! Never realized it was the same guy, lol.
Very sweet! I've always meant to get the first two on blu-ray. I'll have to go do that. I loved them, and I still enjoy these characters. I'd love to see a third full length real movie, if we can ever go to the theatres again.
Wow Casting for the two Babies is perfect! They need to make a full feature!!!!!!!!!! Like i was born the year the first one came out but both films are two of my all time favourites!
MY CHILDHOOD
Enjoyed it.
I WANT THIS MOVIE NOW RIGHT NOW.😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Wish I could stream the movie tho
Tears of happiness.... I grew up watching these films!!!
So beautiful ...LOVED this so much.
This is puke worthy. Let's keep the covid propaganda going. The two movies had heart and connection, this has disconnection all over it.
this is awesome - didnt realise how much i missed these films can a third please be done
Florence Pugh saying "this is a brilliant, beyond brilliant, idea" as a nod to Meyers' other film The Parent Trap made me smile :D
I needed this. Thank you to all that made it possible.
this is a gem 😭💖 now who wants an actual part 3 in 2021/2022???
My mom loved this, if they made another movie pretty sure she would throw my inheritance at it lol jk she's the best
😭 if you enjoyed this, make sure you donate!!!
Boring 🙄
This made my night!!!!!!!! Make a movie....Megan needs a wedding!!!!!
I can’t look at Kieran Without thinking Succession now
So timely, so relevant👍👍👍 - putting  an “ancient” ( for lack of better term), universal tradition, the vow, of lifetime commitment in present context (of pandemic).
If Netflix don't make an official part 3/4 movie we RIOT He still has another daughter to marry off!!
Part 3!!! growing up in the 90s this was a family favorite for us!!!!
Jiminy Glick snuck in a couple times and I'm ok with that.
Franck‘s makeup and hair was fantastic!! 🤣
❤❤❤ this movie. Father of the Bride is my favorite, never gets old for me. 3 needs to be a movie. Please make this happen
What fun! 👰🏼 🤵
1.) Netflix, make a full length movie! 2.) If it would be great seeing George (Papi) and Annie (and Brian) dealing with becoming grandparents and great-grandparents. 3.) These movies have so much potential. Lets do a fourth movie as well :) 4.)Thanks to everyone who put  this together. It took me back to being a kid!
Ok the ring scene....................I am not crying, you're crying.
I LOVED it, hopefully a movie in the future,
The original FOTB music running through this is just wonderful. Absolute nostalgia 🥰🥰
This made my day!  Thank you so much Nancy for taking the time and your talent to create this script and to pull all these wonderful actors back together.  Godspeed!
Omygosh. When I saw Franck I burst into tears. He was my favorite person when I was younger. I’ve always and I still want him to run my wedding.
I was super little when  these movies came out but this still gave me all the feels 🥰🥰💞
I looove Father of the Bride!!!! I can't believe the last sequel was as old as I am. How I wish Netflix would really be doing the Part 3 for real. <3 This movie really makes me happy. Btw, Kimberley Williams did not age! She looks exactly the same!!!
This was so well written and well acted! So moving!
I loved these movies but god this was cringeworthy. Social conditioning much?! Come on people!
Please naruto shippuden
2020: sucks The Banks family: not on our watch
why is there no close caption???  I am deaf and huge fan of "father of the bride" movies. =(
wait is he the brother of Macauley Culkin??? btw now we need a real part 3.... we need movies like those from the 90s back. these feel good family movies
This need to happen I been watching father of the bride movies all the time I even have the movies on dvd and watch them like 20ish or more times in the week. I am so honored I got the opportunity to watch this short part 3ish of my all time favorite childhood movie right now as an adult and having his of my own. They need this full movie to be made and have real movies came back like this one!!!! Please please please made this movie again Nancy you are my best producer!!! But love your best and only lifetime fan!😘😢🙏🙌🏼💖💔😘🙏🙏🙏🙌🏼🙌🏼
Steve Martin is hilarious and a comedy genius!
I LOVED THIS SO MUCH 🥺😭❤️
Loved every minute of this!! ❤️❤️
This cringes me so much...and I don't know why!!! I love this concept yet......
I need a full length movie now! This is amazing. The characters are still so awesome. Robert De Niro vs Steve Martin will be epic
This is just awful
Cheesy to start, and then  heart warming. But then the song. What is with dude's voice? I mean the constant vibrato is jarring, and a tad creepy.
In the next 25 years, everyone would be as old as George. The man doesn’t age 😅
Wow.
Matty looks the same!! Just a lil taller!
I missed all of them. Happy to watch this here. Heart warming and funny as always
Megan!!!  Little George!!! So happy right now!  YAY, FRANCK, my favourite person!!!!  Whoever put this together , thank you very much.
Tearing up all over again. All those years later. Loved this
To me there will only be one "Father of the bride" and that is the original with Elizabeth Taylor and Spencer Tracy..Kiern Culkin is looking old wow!
Omg!!!! I loved this!!! We need a movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey Netflix I can't watch saiki pls help
OMG, why am I crying?? One hopes that there will be more in the future.
I became sooo excited hearing Frank !!!! Gosh I love this whole thing♥️
Wow just wow! I loved this movie when in was a kid. This was a great short. This also is a good way to make a movie like this involving marriage especially with what’s happening now. Thank you Netflix!
This was the best thing EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We need a full movie PLEASE !!!!
Lol this cringe 😬
Netflix needs to work its Cobra Kai magic on all our nostalgia ridden favorites!
This was great, and i'm eager for a day when an actual Father of the Bride Part 3 arrives. I actually wrote a third entry in college and I called it Grandfather of the Bride haha. Also I think a lot of us Touchstone fans deserve Sister Act 3: Return to the Habit, and While you Were Awake. :D
bravo netflix💛 awesome movie💕
Awww this was soo cute imma cry 🥺😭😢
Just awesome...would love love love a Father of the Bride part 3
Diane and Robert have this film together where they were divorce and have to pretend to be together because their adopted son is getting married and his real mom is not a fan of divorce couples.
Thanks for the quarantine tips netflix... oh and for shitting on Father of the Bride
When the world reopens can we get a third film with this whole cast. This was so lovely.
Aw memories. I loved these movies so much when I was a kid, still do
Cant wait 😭
Oh my gawd I love This!!!!!!
This is pure gold. I wasn't expecting to tear up, but this has me misty eyed. The additional casting is perfect! Love it!
This is soooo goood!!! Laughed cried etc..watched 3x already😀
🥰
The "I think dad is frozen" scene was pretty good @ 8:15.
Been wondering how the banks family has been fairing through the quarantine lol!!!
I was not expecting to cry as much as I am right now. Having said that, I’ve seen the first two movies so, I should’ve been expecting to cry this much...    Father of the Bride 1 and 2 are like, the ultimate comfort feel good movies. Kinda like The Parent Trap starring Lindsay Lohan. You know? Truly feel good films which is exactly what we need right now. ❤️ ❤️
This is mind numbing propaganda
To think, this aired on my 37th Birthday!!! And it inspired me to rewatch the first two films after so many years. Where does the time go by?  UPDATE: R.I.P. to Diane Keaton  Such a wonderful actress especially in comedy.
Love this
The rich stay rich by investing like and investing without stopping then the poor stay poor by spending like the rich yet not investing like the rich ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
Wish bdwong would’ve been a part of this
It's very over-acted.
Holy crap.  That was epic.
Dios de mi vida!! Me han hecho tan feliz!! Y eso que estoy llorando. Que bonito. Gracias!!
Looking at all the comments I feel better knowing I am not the only one who cried watching this lol
MARTIN SHORT HAD ME IN STITCHES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Loved this clip and I will definitely donate.🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
CRYING. OMG. CRYING SOOOO MUCH. my fav films ever.
I couldn't have loved this more! What an exceptional cast <3 Thanks for caring enough to make this happen!
PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES  ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')    There are some things that you should know:    1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:    Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"    Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"    It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.    2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:    Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."    Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."    Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.    3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).    Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.     Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.    You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.     Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.    Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."    4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:    ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I have sinned against you and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”    If you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ and meant it with all of your heart, you are now a child of God and will go to heaven. Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism
We need a full part 3 and 4 where the pandemic is over and Maddie and Rachel get their Tuscany wedding. Then Megan meets and elopes with her future husband in Italy and she and Rachel and Annie are all pregnant and someone is having triplets
I’m not crying..... you’re crying.
"Everybody's here!"  ...except literally any member of HER family?
The writing! On point! Well done all.
You all picked right up where you left off. What a treat. Thanks. Just donating to World Central Kitchen NOW!
Great short - really hope they do full length .. need it during these times 💖
That was beautiful.
Please can we make this happen this is so needed right now
I loved this and Kieren Culkin looks so cute.
This is weird.
This was awesome!!
I really love it! Please after all this crazyness could you guys do The Father of the bride part 3. PLEASE PLEASE
just a great event with a great purpose....God bless everyone involved
I’m not crying...you’re crying. :)
WHY AM I EMOTIONAL
Best moment of 2020 ❤️
This is great, but is the bride even out of high school? She doesn't look old enough to be a doctor.
This still didn't save them from cuties
ok well i didnt need to sob over this today omg
This is amazing!!
I loved this🤧🤧🤧
They're all so bougie - doctor, musician, TV writer...no forensic accountants, executive assistants or biotoxicologists
We gonna talk about how disgusting Cuties is?
This. Is. Everything.
Aww I remember this movie ❤️
This is the best movie
I’m going to say it this was cringe
Awwww too bad they didn’t make a whole movie, it would of been really great 🥰
This was soooo sweet! We need an official part 3!
The dad just buying excessive amounts of things for everyone is so unrelatable.
hopefully they can actually make a full movie
Starts at 9:59
Rose32285 This was such a joy to watch, and so well done....a global crisis that everyone is living through and coping with at the same time, and so the final message is really relatable. It was great seeing Megan and Georgie all grown up....I just love how even though George could be crazy at times, all three of the Banks kids turned out to be such kind, thoughtful, levelheaded, and family oriented people. It made me think about how, in the second movie, George feared he wouldn’t be young or strong enough to be “the same” for the new baby, but seeing how she turned out, it’s clear they were great parents. Awesome chemistry among the cast, and more than enough potential to start planning an actual Part 3. My only complaint is that I truly feel like Annie and Brian would have had more than one kid—two at the very least—but with a setup like this, I can understand why they wanted to keep the group small and not introduce too many new characters.
Loved this ❤️❤️❤️
Are those two the actual babies that appeared in the movie?
So well done and so much fun to see the original cast and bits from the earlier movies!  Thank you for adding a bright spot to the world!
MARCOS ALEX DOS SANTOS IDENTIDADE 209.44766.34-4 BT BLUETOOTH TECNOLOGIA YAMAHA INSTRUMENTOS MUSICAIS BRAZIL
When will the full length movie come out. This teaser crap is too over!
So awesome!  We definitely need another Father of the Bride movie!
I really needed this!  Thank you, and especially Nancy Meyers, who may have saved my heart from 2020...
Great work!
Who would down vote this?  What kind of a monster would do that?
Great show
Papala is my new name for my pops. Love it 🤣 Films like this jsut aren't around anymore. One of my all time faves growing up. Can't believe it's been so long. So glad to get the main cast back though. Such a joy to watch. Would very much like a feature length film now. Get on it Netflix!
This made my month----Make it a whole movie, PLEASE!  Sincerely, All of America
More please.  It is so great to see the Banks.  Please give us more.  This was awesome.
Did anyone catch The Parent Trap reference at 19:57? Nancy Meyers, Charles Shyer and Alan Silvestri also worked on The Parent Trap.
That 9-minte, 58-second opening is completely and utterly ridiculous and pointless. It was a complete and total waste of my time. Is it some sort of inside joke or something? Inside jokes are for writers and directors who can't come up with interesting content. This is also proof that Zoom movies don't work.
This was amazing!!!!! So nostalgic! Thanks, Netflix!
I’m in tears! So well done. Thank you for this beautiful story ❤️
This is GREAT!!! My childhood is once again!!!😍❤ btw I was born on 93'😂🥰
How can they make this and NOT have the actual movies available on Netflix?! 😩
The whitest movies of all time.
I was lowkey still hoping for the storyline where Matty is gay and brought home his boyfriend to announce he was getting married and it caused a rift with the entire family. 😭
I really do wish this was a full length movie 😍😍😍
Acts of kindness and support like this brilliant movie, especially amid a global pandemic, make the world a happier place. Netflix take note!
he reminds me of Klaus
I literally cried! This brings back so many memories!! One of my favorite movies to watch. Thank you Netflix for this.
Hey netflix, wtf is the sense of having a favorites list if you are constantly deleting movies?
we talked 2 hours ago...im still fine lol  wow, nephew and aunt were born on the say day. crazy!
Would’ve been better with a few dozen fewer jokes/references to “the pandemic”.
Surprised you sick fucks didn’t come out with a Cuties 2
I loved these movies growing up!
I love this.. seriously good story, great idea, so awesome to get the whole cast back together.  But how many people were in the bride's hotel room before she got there?
SO WONDERFUL!  We all KNOW AND LOVE THIS FAMILY❣️❣️❣️
Thank Cast, Netflix and ET for doing this!❤️
Ohhhh my heart!!!! ❤️
I love this ...
Brilliant
This is just perfect!!!!
Next is GAY WEDDING OF GEORGIE????  Polarizing question?  What would be the title?
Now I want to watch the first one!
This was sooo adorable.
Kimberly Williams looks like the child to Tina fey and Amy poehler..
‘Every party has a pooper that’s why we invited you, party pooper” gosh i grew up watching this movie(s)❤️
As always... everyone is perfect. Martin takes the show by mis pronouncing every word. The whole thing connected with the way you look tonight. Much needed, encore!!
I'm not crying... You're crying...  😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
30 minutes, and they still managed to catch us up, introduce new characters, and not, make them paper thin.  George is the same, Annie is clearly more her mother's daughter calling George on his silliness., Megan is a bit of an 'overachiever , eager daddy's little girl.  not annoyingly so Florence Pough's American accent is spot on! Overall, I forgot about the chaos around me for 30 minutes. It's very well done. I hope it does get flushed out to feature length..
My former 15 & 19 year old self thanks everyone who made this possible.  I LOVED these movies as a teenager and this touched my heart.
I need this to be an actual movie plssssss NETLFIX
Funny how everyone was made at netflix just a week ago and they put this out to divert the attention away and everyone fell for it 😂 ridiculous
I watched both of these a couple weeks ago. I love them!!
Lmao How does Steve look and sound almost the same as he did 25 years ago? He aged like wine, as did Annie's actress. Diane does look like age has hit her, but she still looks amazing.
I have been hoping to see Father of the Bride on Netflix. This is like an all-time fave. Awesome concept. I hope to see 1 and 2 on Netflix soon.
We need a real part 3 of father of the bride. Please netflix.
Brilliant!
Awwww- I love it!!!
The only thing that doesn't completely suck about this is Martin Short, because he can do no wrong. This is God awful.
Congratulations. You made a non canon Funny or Die skit. Brave and stunning.
Random question anyone.. are their backgrounds staged? Would they all be in their actual homes? They all look like a bit like they are on a set/ in a display home..
Very well made. Looks like Robert needed the bag tho🤑
KW was so hot and in a girl next door way.
Had De Nero still been married to Grace, she could have played the mother of the bride.
Thanks I didn't know I needed this .I laughed and cried It made me feel great .Joy is a wonderful thing.
this is without a doubt THE BEST thing to come out of 2020. thank you to everyone involved.
I LOVE THIS! Gave me all the feels even over zoom
This is my favourite thing of 2020!!
i want the father of the bride 3 for real, tho <3<3<3
It’s my birthday subscribe to my channel
Update:  Now Netflix is buying up poorly shot YouTube videos.
Hey, It's Dani from Midsommar.
I didn't know how much I needed this till I saw it! So emotional! 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺♥️♥️♥️♥️
George is the nursery!!! Lmao. I love it!!!
Aamburga....
This is cool and all but I want the actual Father of the Bride part 3
Nina looks fab
Wow they all look so good
Fully produced Father of The Bride 3 please :) This was so sweet.
This was perfect, how does Robert De Niro with one smile after saying it was her Mum's make me so emotional. Legend. I loved these movies from my childhood. And this has just made 2020 a little better! Thank you so much 💓
Man Robert De Niro showing up really caught me off guard 😭💕
Thank you for this...enjoyed immensely...just need more of it❣️.
Thank you very much guys! I've watched more than 100 times when we immigrated to learn English! I'm still loving the works that you guys have put it and thank you so much for a lot of things. You guys means a lot for me and has changed my life even though my brother I s gone and mom is gone...still have my dad like Banks!! Thank you and Thank you!!!
Both movies without a doubt are forever my absolute favorite!! They were both so comforting!! Love this 3 (ish) and I sure hope they make a full movie!!
Fun fact: The word "long" is shorter then the word "Short":-)
"Fun Fact" 7% of American adults believe that chocolate milk comes from brown cows.
AWESOMELY AWESOME 😭♥️♥️♥️
Awww..I'm  in tears!  I wish it was a full length movie!  🥰🥰🥰
LOVED THIS!!!  Got all teary eyed!
They didn’t miss a beat. Brought back so many good memories of the previous movies. If they are doing another movie, please do. It was great to see everyone!
How much does one have to pay DeNiro, Martin and Keaton for this?
Father of the Bride pts 1& 2, my all-time favorite movies!  ❤❤❤
That was soo sweet <3
"Did Dad freeze?" OMG! I love Steve Martin and this was wonderful and made me smile and cry. PLEASE make another full length movie!!!!
Dont u all get it its so funny there making fun of the coronavirus😂😂😂😂
Yes we need the 3rd one.
Is this really not closed-captioned? That's a violation of FCC guidelines, Netflix.
Oh my gosh!!! I have loved and watched these movies so many times and was SO excited that there would be a 3rd one. I really hope that a full length one will be made.  ❤️❤️
Thank you Nancy! You totally made my day! ❤️
Thank you, I didn't knew how much I needed this in these times
Very disappointed they did it like this
I need this to be a real movie! ASAP!!!
I LOVED THIS!!!!
Waiting for "Father of the Divorcee" :)
I cried. I used to rent the first and second movies on VHS every few weeks as a kid.. And then bought the dvds when I was older. Will always be some of my favourite movies ever.   Wish there could be a proper 3rd feature film!! I would go see it 5 times.
That was everything I needed! If we can ever make movies again I hope they make another one. 💜🥰🙌🏼👏🏼
🥺💗🙌
Extremely wack part 3 talk about quarantine 👎👎👎
I cried; I laughed 🥰
wish they put 1&2 on netflix
You have NO idea how happy this made me!  These are two of my most favourite movies, especially FOTB2.  I just watched it two days ago!  To see this...an update of the Banks family after all these years...it brought tears to my eyes.  LOVED seeing the original cast!  Thank you SO much for making this!!  This has really brightened my year!  ❤️
When George Banks came in 🤣
Propaganda
This is super cringe and I loved both movies.
I watched part 1 and 2 in preparation for part 3. So worth it and yes I cry during all 3. It was so wonderful getting to know the beautiful Banks family again. ❤️
I needed this MORE THAN YOU KNOW!!!! <3
WONDERFUL. Makes me feel that I have grown too.
Did anyone instantly hear the “brilliant beyond brilliant idea” line in baby Lindsey Lohan’s voice? WE SEE YOU SNEAKING PARENT TRAP LINES IN HERE NANCY.
I love this. So cute
Wow what an enormous waste of time. The whole thing is people in a fake FaceTime call. Lordy
This made 6months in lockdown so much better! Thank you :)
I wanna see their second wedding in Italy post pandemic with all the family.
Wtf
Thank you! This was just what my heart needed today! I love the Banks family! Don't go away again!
OMG I LOVE THIS!!!
OMG I just love love loved Father of the Bride 1 and 2 - I would love a 3.....please consider this!
Please make another movie loved the movies and cast Diane Keaton and Steve Martin make a great couple this made my day
How about turning on the captions for the Deaf and hard of hearing???  Thanks
This was the scummiest propaganda and agenda piece I’ve seen in along time. Can’t wait to cancel my subscription to this trash platform.
Aw, the sweet touch of Annie’s wedding photo in his room! 😊😊
WOW! From Peru. Great effort. We are donating.
This needs to be carried forward into a full movie!
Love the movie I wish them new one
I loved that very much. It made me as emotional as Part 1 and 2. Thank you for making my day xx
So That's Why Kieren Culkin Wasnt at the Scott Pilgrim Table Read
Florence Pugh oh my Midsommar Queen!
*Remember* *TODAY IS TOMORROWS YESTERDAY*
Kimberly Williams is still a fox
This is perfect!
Love it ❤️😊
Wowwww, Robert De Niro was a surprise! Please make it longer. Miss all the cast.
I demand an actual movie w/ 75 year old grouchy Steve Martin in which he must give away daughter Meg while again not understanding Franck on account of failing hearing aide & disbelief of wedding costs in the 2020’s. People would line up to see this.
Afffff Não está traduzido .... Sou brasileira Que pena sou super fã desta atriz que está apresentando nossa eterna Legalmente Loira ....e do Filme ....
Now redo it properly give us 3:00: hours and release it in cinemas
JUST AWESOME!  Thank you for making part 3 (ash)!
Loved it!  I have always wondered what happened to all of them. I wish more shows would do this,
The sweetest thing I have seen in 2020. Thanks for the memories.
This is WONDERFUL!!  Thank you <3
Franc is the only one who barely aged! I loved this movie so much growing up and watching this is bringing back so many good memories❤️
2019: *STAY POSITIVE* ❤  2020: *EVERYONE TESTING POSITIVE* 😷🦠
The amount of joy I felt 💜💜💜
Why does the son looks younger then the grandson?
Please make a feature film! My whole family is on the couch watching this on our tv!
Thanks Netflix!  🙌🙌🙌
It is awesome movie ever
I love this so much.
Perfect!!!
I SOBBED IT WAS THAT GOOD. 25 minutes and they got my to cry. I loved it, and this needs to happen. A WHOLE MOVIE.
you should set up captions for deaf and hard of hearing people to understand the video
PLEASE make a part 3! Have the in-person wedding! It was great to see the cast! Bring the entire cast back and make another movie! Loved it!
Florence Pugh with an American accent is so trippy even though she played Amy with an American accent!
Wow even the babies. Florence Pugh really??? 😱
Please make the full movie!!
Soooo goood
This is Genius!!
THANK YOU NANCY MEYERS!
I LOVE THIS and am crying!!
Matty's expressions did not change for a bit. The same eye rolling and head shaking. Loved this reunion!
♡!
This was spectacular!! Very well done!!
This was hard to watch. I still can't believe the people act like George in real life over COVID.
Georgie started singing and my chest tightened, love that song!
In tears now, this was wonderful very much needed, The memories! we definitely need the movie now it would be awesome 😁
Thank you Nancy Meyers and the cast and everyone involved! We needed this so much!!!
I want more of this family!   Hopefully this is the beginning of a new movie 🤞
I got married last year and one of the most special moments of my wedding day was when I entered the church with my dad and the quartet started playing Annie’s theme.   Priceless moment, priceless movie.
Thank You All! The World Needed This! ❤
cuti...  (go on)
Diane Keaton still looks lovely.
Wish they had made closed captioning available.
Jesus is coming when we least expect, pls repent. Beware of false prophets who will deceive many. get rid of what causes ur downfall, pray and read the Word. Jesus is the sole mediator. we're under God's wrath bc of sin. We're saved by grace not our works. God does not want us to perish in hell. dont be fooled by Satan, even he trembles before God. Im saying this bc i rlly luv u all, God bless.❤️
I wish Father of the Bride should be added on Disney+.
Another Full movie PLEASE!
Nancy nailed it!!
This was perfect! Thank you to everyone who put this together!!
This was perfect. Thank you to all who put it together!!!
I love this. Makes me happy. 💖
Thank you for this...Love love this part 3.. Cried a lot . At least we can live one of those greatest loves on movies
This is awesome. Can we get a full length movie, Netflix?
They had to make this shit all about covid? What a shame. Was really looking forward to it.
This was way better than the celebrity read out a side from the one with Shia  Labeouf.  I mean I love nostalgic content from my favorite celebrities but sometime it sounds cringey and awkward. I like how Flowy this was!
I love this!!!

Steve one the best to ever do it ,  no cap .  Same with Martin Short .  Loved watchin these wit me mum.  rip
Too cute! Everyone should take 27 minutes out of their day to watch, even if you haven't seen the movies it's still something nice and funny to make you feel good in a time when we could all use it!!! Thank you to everyone who helped make this; it was perfect❣
Loved this! So special!! Total tears! But u do have to ask Wheres BD Wong!!!??? Hope they come back for a real part 3!

Love this! Thank you!
Why did I cry at this?
Father of the Bride is one of my favorites, and this video is made with the same magic that made the other two so sweet and special. Everyone’s chemistry is still so natural, and Martin Short has not missed a beat! ❤️
one word...  cuties netflix really released it🤦🏾‍♂️
Wow that was actually good
By chance I just saw both movies again last week. I need it - just makes you feel good- that actually “ nothing real can be threatened, nothing unreal truly exists .”
When is FOTB 3 (not ish) happening?
This was cute 💖
Thank you to all involved in the making of “Father of the Bride Part 3 (ish). With all of the challenges the world has/continues to face on an daily basis, it’s refreshing to know we can take comfort in knowing, hope, joy and laughter is still alive and well.
This was so nice,  thanks for the break from reality.
WHO ELSE CRIED THOUGH SERIOUSLY THIS GOT ME WAAAAY TO EMOTIONAL
Happy tears, fuzzy warm feeling xx
OMG My Childhood memories, always loved this movie 🎥 and waiting part 4 2021 please!!!!!!
❤❤❤
This was AMAZING!!... so adorable we all loved it ... thank you for entertaining us.. be safe .
I cried at part one. I cried at part two. I cried at part three(ish). Thank you so much for this special gift. Please give us another for the big screen!

Florence Pugh and Ben Platt were the twins?! OMG I had no idea wow
I'm so happy I was a kid when i watched this movie , so now that I'm younger , this brings me a lot of happy memories I'm crying 😭♥️♥️♥️
I want a father of the bride part 3. Kimberly Williams Paisley looks the same.
Netflix has to put the. First two movies 🤩🤩
I love these movies as a kid I would love a full length part 3. Where they have the big ceremony. 😍😍😭😭😭
I really hate the "zoom" format
Absolutely beautiful💕 thank you for making this happen a beautiful addition to two lovely movies❤️
Clip Show! WTF one more reason to not get Netflix!
A full part 3 please!!!!
Love, love, love!
Love it! ❤️
So adorable
This BROKE my mum......
We needed this in 2020. So many things left undone on hold. But some of us may not have time to wait. In these times we never know. So take hold of now. We can make memories even in a new way.
Roman Roy gets married.... Kieran Culkin gives such a memorable performance in "Succession" that he is now only Roman Roy to me.   I loved both Father of The Bride movies in the 1990s. My late mother did too. I hate she can't see this reboot.
omg omg i never write comments but just wanted to share!!! i rmr being 13 watching this movie for the first time! Now 22 years old, 9 years later, and my heart feels so full. Just wanted to share. Thank you cast and all ❤️
This made me cry! 😍😍
How cool is this , I was just watching these movies last week 😁 Father of the Bride part 1 is a classic👌  I watch it all the time and everytime I watch it it feels like the first! Steve Martin and Diane Keaton are magical.
I had a comment on here previously and somehow it became a political debate 🙄   Anyways this was amazing, thank you to the cast, and nancy meyers. Especially thank you to WCK for helping out in this hard time.  I've rewatched Mattys wedding atleast 5 times now since friday evening. And each time I've laughed and cried.   Definitely need a full length movie, the banks story and Georges legacy can go on forever.
Beautiful! A family we love, we all the correct messages while in this pandemic moments 💕
Wow, Steve Martin still looks the same!! He’s amazing. He reminds me of the late Robin Williams.
HOLY SMOKES! Wonderful. Thank you all for this treasure. Thank you, World Central Kitchen.
If you want to be saved and have everlasting life believe Jesus died on the cross for our sins, and was buried. Then, rose on the third day, which proved He is truly our God and Savior. John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Beautiful yes they got to do an actual part 3
Omg I cryed . B est one ok know time to see the rest get married
That was a good cry!
A part 3 movie with Florence as the bride 😱😍 COME ON NETFLIX WE TRUST YOU 💪 Edit: and she is marrying a woman, so there are TWO fathers of the brides!!! Come on Netflix I'm giving you this idea for free.
We need a full movie for Marty’s wedding
This makes me so unbelievably happy!! 💖💖
Loved this.  Makes me miss 90s movies overall. They don't make sweet shows like this anymore.   I'd totally be here for a full movie with the daughter getting married. Especially played by Florence!
Plough was the actual baby in the movie?
awwwww
The Robert di Nero cameo was perfect
So sweet, really cool bit & awesome to see who they added to the roster 👍🏾
Netflix is ok with pedophilia!
You lost me at the mask scene. If you are wearing a mask and you are outside in fresh air or you are in a car by yourself, you are a moron!
I called it.....No way it was gonna be a white girl
It's so weird that people like this.
Honestly, I thought Matty would get to be the “bride” this time.  Oh well, it’s just acting.
Hello friends
Concentration implies resistance, whereas in attention there is no form of resistance. Resistance arises when there is fear. When you give attention, there is no entitiy who attends. When the brain is aware of how inattentive it is, then that very awareness of inattention becomes attention.
👍
ok Steve marin we are ready for a cheaper by the dozen 3 with GRANDKIDS GALORE
These movies were always the go-to rent from blockbuster for my family back in the 90s
Hi friends have a great day I love you
YouTube is getting real comfortable with these double no skip ads , imma cry in the corner
i think netflex is boycotted now
桐生ココ世界一位 kiryuu coco no.1
So touching, it made me cry!! Please have a Part 4 (ish)
i loved this movie as a child
Father of the bride and ben platt. Words fail to express how happy this made me

Not gonna lie, this made me cry a little 💛✨
I own those movies on dvd- ordered last year to rewatch with the family. This just made my night! Crying through the end. I loved it. Saw Steve Martin and Martin Short on their comedy tour, so funny... I will forever love them. The Father of the Bride movies were so perfect, funny and touching. Thank you all involved for this unexpected wonderful short! Warmed my heart!🥰
Brilliant, we need a third feature film please!
I miss the 90s so much it makes me wanna cry 😢
Steve looks the exact same! (in a good way)
Soo ..........This is a thing?....... interesting
I don't believe it. I really can't believe it. Like honestly, Its not true. What zoom meeting has *perfect* resolution‽
Has anyone captioned this? I can’t understand without subtitles... I am hard of hearing. Thanks 🙏🏻
So wonderful, very happy ideed👏👏👏👏👏😘💓
Cast culkin as adult sasuke.
I saw a clip of this on another show and I really thought it was Macaulay culkin
👺
This was just magical. I'm in tears. Thank you to all the cast and crew for doing this, this really has made my 2020. Sidenote: we literally have part one on atm. I do so love these movies, I have both of them on dvd ❤️
🦄
I absolutely died over this.  What a clever idea!  It made me feel so warm and fuzzy.  Ben Platt singing ‘The Way You Look Tonight’  was the perfect closing.  I cried!!!! 😭
this just doesn't hit in the same way in 2020. lol
How did you manage to make me cry through a zoom wedding? 😭😭😭😭😭
this was terrible lol. wow. i grew up on this film and as a 6, 7,8 and 9 year old it was my all time favourite film watched repeat. But this was terrible. And the big reveal of his girlfriend lord!!! She Black is the big surprise this time???????? bye y'all.
This made me so so so happy, as Annie once said - “ I feel All - Lit up inside” ☀️☀️✨💕
Subscribe
This was lovely 💕
Thank you. Loved this
I cried watching this. 😭😭
I’m glad people make great efforts to make amazing things happen.   And I just want to take a moment to accept that I wish One Direction made an effort like this.
This is amazing short sweet and straight to the point, it’s beautiful.
Just perfect for a sunday morning ! Absolutely loved this, amazing family zoom catch up! Please do more!😍
Now NETFLIX should make this film... we're all waiting for Father of the Bride 3 as a movie❤️❤️❤️
Hoakiest thing I've ever seen! STUPIDITY RUN AMUCK!! Don't bother making that full length part 3! Gag!!
I thought that was Ben Platt!!  My dentist is Ben’s uncle!
Loved it ❤ ❤Thank you ❤❤
omg 🥰🥰🥰 😭😭😭
That has to be the best thing that’s happened in 2020, that was wonderful to watch. I cried a few times, especially George’s speech of your kids growing up. Perfectly done, well done xx
I’m not crying...you’re crying 😭
This is what it means to be a family
Why Closed Captions are unavailable? I am hard of hearing and I need the CC to understand the movies. The deaf community needs the Closed Captions
I loved it! 💞
Well done!! Great concept! It's so nice to see them altogether again, together with new characters. This made me so happy, that I cried!
I absolutely loved this! Father of the Bride is my favorite movie :)
I liked the movies and the entertainers because it was a chance to escape... I even knew and became good friends with several actors over the decades...  But today, due the self centered political escapades plus learning about decades of perverted and inhumane activity, Flyover country chose to Boycott Hollywood... Oh some tried to watch the productions that were released during the last four years, but 95% of it is pure SJW, Critical Marxist Identity CRAP... IT ISN'T WORTH THE SILICON IT WAS RECORDED ON !!!   A few exceptions that didn't try to Indoctrinate the Silent Moral Majority with perverted SJW Marxist Identity Crap are: 1917, Apollo 11, Wick 3, First Man, A Quite Place, MI Fallout... Then again I don't know if these movies were produced before or after political Immorality saturated the industry...   As for this Father of the Bride 3 short, the acting is a bit below par for these superb actors... And as for the flick itself, it's s simply another Obey Your Globalist God's Indoctrination flick... I would rather Die than live a secluded life like this Short portrays... But I'd sure as Hell take as many Globalist Tyrants as possible with me...   Spread Truth, Reality And Wisdom World Wide Daily...
Loved this so much! Please make a Father of the Bride Part 3, we need it!
This made my day omg soo heart warming to see all of them grown up I'm not crying u are
*_You have to, take a deep breath. and allow the music to flow through you. Revel in it, allow yourself to awe. When you play , allow the music to break your heart with its beauty_*
It was a lovely special, it would be a great movie to watch, please make it.
Who else can we ask not to eat? I always loved that line😂
Amazing! Loved it!
Blubbering like a baby!!! For me, watching the two father of the bride films feels like coming home. They’re beautiful. And seeing this, well it just makes my heart sing!!! I’m so happy. Thank you SO MUCH, Netflix, for giving us this gem! 😍🥰  BONUS: one of my biggest celeb crushes plays Baby Megan all grown up?! YESSSSSS
one of my favorite white people movies. loved this, even the corny parts.
We liked 'em all, us after our 20 years married, could relate to the fam...
These black-ish spin-offs are getting out of hand!
Ok, I cried.... I loved it! Thank you Netflix, you’ve cheered me up!
God bless Steve Martin
This gave me everything i needed today 💙
This is making me so happy to watch even though it is way past my bedtime. The minute I heard this was a thing on youtube, I knew I had to watch this. I loved the first two movies.
This was so good!!!❤️🤩
💕💕💕Will definitely watch another sequel
❤️
Holy crap. I'm five minutes in and so far this is one of the most boring pieces of garbage I've ever seen. I don't think I can waste any more of my time watching such inane drivel. Too bad about the fundraiser -- I feel like THEY should send ME money for torturing me with this tripe.
Love this,  they haven't aged omg
"Oh! You best believe it baby! We gonna be eatin’ like Diane Keaton. Two point three six inches baby."
add subtitles plssss
And the tears are rolling. I have always loved Father of the Bride I and II. My childhood fav. Netflix please pick this up and continue.... It was Ben Platt singing Frank Sinatra’s “The way you look tonight” for me 😭
Fun fact: Steve Martin’s real wife is 1 year younger than the age of Steve’s daughter in Father of the Bride.
There could still be a full length feature. Maggie still needs to get married.i would love to see more craziness from George.
This was one of the few good moments of 2020!  Thanks!
I loved it.
I absolutely loved this and seeing all the cast again. I hope that there will be a full length movie with all the cast to come in the future. This is excellent and really helps to give some hope at this time. Thank you
Esse filme me marcou tanto quando criança, que lindo ver todos eles novamente em seus papéis ❤️
The full movie of this should be their wedding and then Baby Banks (Pugh) meets and marries her wife!
IT went down hill after Reece's part.
Reese is literally the sweetest actress!
I grew up on this movie!!! I really loved this!!! 90s movies are the best, and I loved the references.
Hope they just greenlight a full 3rd full.
I didn't know I needed this 🥰 Thanks!
Left together. Right together. Left together. Right together.
This is fantastic!
We need a whole movie. Stop teasing us  😭
Somehow watching this on a computer makes more sense than watching it on a TV set.
God.i love these movies ...yes I want to see it please.....
i love this. these movies are so special and nostalgic to me. whenever theyd come on t.v (usually aired together) my dad would always watch them with me, he was a man of the streets, kind of a rugged guy but we always enjoyed these movies together 😂
Please please please make a full length movie.
😂😂😂😂😂🥰🥰🥰....i like it!!! Its natural, funny, sad & of course 2020 🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍... thanks for the upload 😘
Good stuff, thank you to anyone who had anything to do with making it! ... And is it me or did this cast age as if 5 years went by instead of almost 30?
They are trying to make Netflix look good
They are trying to make Netflix look good
They are trying to make Netflix look good
Just like in real life only  Hollywood  has the money to stay home and still quarantine
I'M EXTREMELY IN LOVE WITH THIS PLEASE MAKE THIS A REAL MOVIE PLEEEEEAAASSSSEEE
That was fantastic!! Made 2020 a Little better.. well done, well done.
"RAPE" Stop with your horrible story and video. Why why why?
😭😭😭😭
This was great! I was just waiting for Martin Short... Wasnt dissapointed! So good. Happy tears laughing! Thanks for this!! 😂😂
Didn't know it was possible to happy cry for half an hour straight
Coisa linda um ver esse elenco reunido.
I literally saw this and thought this was fake lmao
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
hello can yall help me find this movie: as I remember I watched it in 2017 - 2014 that time it was a film about decoding the mystery of the church which was both decoding and action I remember there was a piece of the female character standing in  the middle of the church and the image started to rotate to review the background it's very vague but I still hope for any help or suggestion about the same movies.
Please,please,please make a third movie! This would be beyond perfect. I would love to see more of Matty and Rachel’s story and get to know Megan and Georgie now their grown up. Hollywood,instead of making reboots here’s an actual great idea!
I'm literally crying right now 😭 I have to share this with my dad 💕
I’m in love with florence Pugh
Im literally crying....idk why. I busted when i saw Frank!!!!❤❤😭😭😭😭
I NEED A WHOLE MOVIE 😩
Uh...,
So I’m the only one who missed B.D. Wong?
Loved 1&2 and hope they’ll really make a 3.  Isn’t it crazy how just after meeting the new characters that played they babies you can instantly like them and feel like they were really members of the family for all these years?
Fun fact: cotton candy was invented by a dentist
Fun fact: The word "long" is shorter then the word "Short"
I absolutely love 💕💕these movies and this was wonderful!!! But I need a full length number 3 movie please
OMG!!! THIS WAS PERFECT!!!! I needed this more than you all know. 🥰
Please make the 3er movie 🙏.  I'm a fan!
Well this definitely bought tears to my eyes! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love how well everyone got into character.  The only question is     Where is Frank's assistant Howard?
Truly loved this, please make a movie!

we needed this in 2020. thank you. and also, that movie's soundtrack i've always adored. hearing it here made me nearly cry
They should have a wedding or ten a day done that way otherwise there’s no telling when or how things could ever move forward - plus it’s too important not to celebrate love and be committed forever without worries - 🤷‍♂️🙋‍♂️🥰💒🙋‍♂️
😲🙋‍♂️ the babies - so easy to relate what about outside no fire green things no smoke strange to see nowadays - getting used to seeing the red or orange screen 😲 FaceTime since when ? He’s funny hope he’s still got his name on his quarantine mask 2020 how ironic ! Such a nice cute house - 😲😲🙋‍♂️🤣🤷‍♂️ I like the French doors - zoom 😲🤷‍♂️😳🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️😲😲😲😲💒💍 aww Shazam yippee that’s what I’m talking about go big or go home - 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣awww 😭🤷‍♂️🥰💍💒🌟💥⭐️💫🍾🏩🎉🎊🎊🧾 that was done classy and well done for a pandemic situation - it’s perfect - he said I’ll hug you 2021 🤣 listen to the music we should get doing that ! It’s the best - can always celebrate if the plague ever goes away ?  🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️💍🥰🏩💒💒🤷‍♂️
BRILLIANT..., Watching this movie as a kid is what made me believe in everlasting love and family. I tried so hard to hold back the tears, but they just jumped out of my eyes. Tears of absolute joy. So good to see the entire cast again. Loved it 🤗
Real nice
This seriously brought tears to my eyes! This was one of my all-time favorite movie series growing up (I am around Matty's age), and the sentimental moments in this short "film" brought back SO many memories! All the adults were spot ON bringing back their old characters (especially Steve Martin and Diane Keaton! They definitely still have chemistry even while Zooming separately!) The "babies" were such a fun addition - especially Megan and how she is so much like her father! Thank you to everyone who brought this together...it made my year!! ❤❤ Now for Parts 4 and 5...Megan and George's weddings! (I also love how I share the same name with Matty's wife! 😁)
I started crying when Franck came on.
Los que hicieron esta peli se sacaron un 10!!!! tiene toda la vibra de las películas originales, felicitaciones , me dio mucho gusto ver al cast original!!
This just means they need to make a 4th movie of them getting their wedding !!!
PLEASE we all ...the entire world needs the FATHER OF THE BRIDE 3 AND 4! When this will happen? this is gold! will pass through generations 💕✨✨✨✨✨
How is a zoom call making me cry ?!
So nostalgic! ❤️
We need a longer version of the show. Love the Sweeter Annie had on. That was amazing to watch. A Great Clip we have seen of it. It was Amazing.
Thank you for the happiness!
Omg loved it so much
this is so awsome
I still  talk about the   hot dogs and the buns, with my kids and wife
I was thinking the babies should be 15 years old, but OMG - it’s been 25 years?!
Whaaat! Love those shows so much
Thank you to all involved...much needed love and laughter in these times!!
*LORD JESUS DIED & ROSE AGAIN TO FREE U FROM SIN ACCEPT HIS GIFT* ✝️✝️✝️
I loved this! I need a real part 3 movie please and thank you Netflix. 🤞🙏
Wow, Kieran Culkin still looks young
This was legit the best of any of the celebrity get together and act out over Zoom's that have happened by far
Omg, I laughed, I cried. Damn, I gonna go donate now
Bravo 👏👏
Om goodness i love this movie soooooo much, please make the official part 3 after this pandemic 🤗😘🎉🇯🇲🇨🇦
I would love an actual part 3 after this pandemic is done and over with
Thank you so much, Nancy Meyers for creating such beautifully uplifting content in 2020. This sure does warm my heart to see this. ❤️
Wow, that was disappointing!
Wow, wow, WOW! This was so needed, thank you! I also did not cry (I’m lying)❤️
We need this movie!! This was incredible... tears of joy
Loved it!  Such a great cause as well!  Please do a part 3, we miss the Banks!
MY HEART!!! Father of the Bride is one of my ALL TIME favourite movie series! I absolutely loved this. ❤
Hope George is still removing the superfluous buns
Cute.  Couldn't figure out who all these "extras" are.  Disappointed though.  Typically "socially correct."  Perfect for today, but would never work back in the original--and excellent--movie.
This whole thing is about 4 months late
Great choice, Florence Pugh !
This is the lamest thing I have ever seen...not a sequel at all...

These FOTB movies are my most memorable childhood/family memories. Even the title sequence makes me tear up 💕 please make another full movie !!!!
I absolutely loved it!!! Loved that they referenced both movies, the music and the song at the end. Now I need to go watch part 1.💙
Wow just a little while ago Kieran Culkin reunited with the cast of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World for its 10th anniversary and now this, who knew he would be meeting so many old friends once again
I stopped watching at 6 mins. Beer Bug ad.
This made my entire day 😂💕
laughing so hard i'm crying  man i love these actors and the writers too at this point!
26 minutes and I both fell over laughing and cried with joy. I hope this accomplishes two very important things: raising all the money for a good cause, and MAKING ANOTHER FEATURE FILM! The Banks are exactly what we need to make up for the pitfalls of 2020. Maybe Megan should marry a woman - George can split the cost with another dad! Or Georgie can marry a man... and no one will know who is paying. No matter what the plot is... BRING BACK THE BANKS!
This made my heart burst with childhood  nostalgia 💖. Wish they would really make this movie!
This is a superior quality Zoom meeting
what an amazing sketch, right before the effing de niro showed up
This was AWESOME!
This is great!  I wish there was closed captioning available.
omgosh this is great and hilarious and it looks like 'mom and dad' haven't aged much since the last movie!  and its cool the rest of them have :)
Great video!
I enjoyed part 3. Was Frank suppose to look like he had too much plastic surgery?
It was awesome, I was smiling the whole time , loved it ♥
ish?????
This was great! Do a full feature film!!
We need  a real  full lenght movie  plzzzzz
So... wait. You're telling me that Franck knew, her father knew, Matty's nephew knew....  and no one thought to call a girl up and be like, "hey -- so...... that Zoom call we scheduled this week, maybe dress nice, ok??  I can't tell you why, but trust me, you're going to want to dress nice."
Top demais, agora só falta a versão em portugues!
When come out movie
This is beyond beautiful! I want more netflix!!!!!!!!🗣️
This was great!
I love this
😂😂😂😂 I loveeeeeeee this!!!!!
Currently bawling my eyes out
This is the Most important post you’ll ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments; To lie even once makes us liars, to steal even once makes us thieves. & James 2 : 10 states that to break one of the laws makes us guilty of them all. Problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because the creator is perfectly holy, meaning his standard is outside our reach; & just as he is perfect in holiness, he is also perfect in justice. So sin must go punished, & the wages of sin is death & hell, which the Holy Bible describes as eternal fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth  Thankfully God is so merciful, 2000 years ago he sent his son Jesus Christ down from his throne in heaven to this earth, & here he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take on judgment on our behalf by becoming our sin, & dying a grim death on a cross. Before he died, he said “it is finished” meaning, the debt of our sins have been paid. & On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement, not by earning it, but as a free gift of grace; except a gift can either be accepted or rejected  So what you must do in response is go before God & humbly admit you have sinned against him, turn away from your old ways through gratitude in his sacrifice, & confess with your mouth Jesus Christ is Lord, savior, & the ruler of your life from that moment forward. (Romans 10:9). The moment this happens God will grant you a new heart, new desires, & eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers.   This is the most urgent decision all of us will ever make, as it determines where we will spend eternity; & all of us wether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; do not even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written(Hebrews 9:27);   ‘it is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’  All glory honor & praise to Lord Jesus Christ
Netflix trying to redeem themselves with something wholesome. Keep going Netflix. Keep going. You can do this.
Writers get busy! Part 3 gonna be the best ever🤩😍
Definitely have to make a 3rd movie!!!
This was by far the most amazing thing to watch!! I have been wanting another movie for a while now. This helped so much! Crying! Thank you Netflix!
Masterpiece
Beautiful
I cried just like I did when I first saw 1 and 2... I love these movies so much and hope one day we have a full part 3!!!! We have 2 more kids to go to get married and have babies!!!
So disappointed in this 😥 I didn’t have high expectations and was still let down. The world doesn’t need 15 minutes of quarantine jokes. I loved the 1st two but this fell way short.
This was so precious, I am actually crying...the song was beautifully done, it all flowed together so sweetly
Loved this! Now if they can do this with “Friends” that would be the icing on the cake!
My daughter had a zoom wedding a couple of months ago and I've been really missing her. We would watch this over and over together. This made me cry. Thank you for doing this for the fans!
THIS. IS. AWESOME.  I have imagined this like a million times. Still can't believe it
Curious to see Hans Zimmer mentioned in the credits.
I just loved all the Father of the brides!! Omg!! Love it
This was so good! I cried! I love Father if There Bride. It was one of my favorites growing up. I want to see more.
Loved thisssssss omg🥺🥺
Adorable
Makes me wanna watch cheaper by the dozen agian
Why are they talking so weird?
They have a wonderful chemistry in this movie,we also need part 3 feature length, this really be amazing,
This was awesome ❤️
Nancy Meyers, you ROCK!  This was just what we needed in this very stressful time, BRAVO!  PLEASE.....make more movies, short or long, just keep them coming!!  <3
omg I love this! this is just what I needed!
Thank you Netflix ❤
Love this want an actual movie!
Que ideia maravilhosa simplesmente o máximo. Amei...
This made me cry...
Take down cuties, pedophiles!
This gave me the most amount of serotonin I’ve had in a while!!! THE MUSIC, THE CAST, THE EVERYTHING!! It’s perfect💜 Now we need a full length movie w the in person wedding!
Can I cry happy tears? ❤️
Once this pandemic is over and its safe to make proper movies again i demand a full film version with this cast.
So fun, happy, and relatable!  LOVE IT!
where was BD Wong?, however, this was incredible, (the best thing made in 2020 )I am crying in laughter and nostalgia and would love to see Father of the Bride 3(ish) continued as a full-length movie I want more, Ben Platt singing at the end was stunning and loved this storyline too, Father of the Bride is and always will be one of my favourite movies and the Banks family and Franck will always be so special having grown up laughing and crying alongside them. thank you Nancy Meyers, all the cast and those who made this reunion possible
Annie hasn’t aged A DAY.
Liked the movies.....this was kind of lame.
I love it
Osea part33333 siii
That was a cute little catch-up of my favorite movie from childhood.
Awesome!  I wanted more, hopefully in the next movie. 😉
If only Steve Martin knew that the number of views on this video would’ve paid for the wedding
Why not produce Season 2 of the series Liter of Turkish Tears, you will achieve great success  Neden Bir litre Türk gözyaşı  Edebiyatı dizisinin 2. sezonunu çekmiyorsunuz, büyük başarılar elde edeceksiniz
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️     Love this!!!!  I NEED MORE!
This was not long enough  for sure
Something else for you. If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.    God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16    God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, he loves you, open your heart take a chance receive Jesus as your savior.
I got the chills hearing the theme song in the opening credits.  I LOVED THIS, PLEASE MAKE A MOVIE . And yes I did all caps in that statement cause it needs to happen soon. Father of the Bride has always brought me happiness. The movie has always been fun, pure joy, and just a feel good movie .  It’s  message, story  and characters have remained relevant through the years.
Amazing!

Thank you for this, Nancy Meyers!  I've been missing the kind of special joy your movies bring during this time, and Father of the Bride is my all-time favorite!  So happy to donate to WCK! :)
WHAT DID THE GREAT CHINESE PHILOSOPHER SAY!
Well done! Loved this so much, I'm so sad it's over. Please do a full length film Part 3!
Two of my favourite films growing up and I can still watch them over and over never get tired of them. I so longed for a sequel for years. although this IS great, a full length (ahem) sequel would be amazing. Please !!! And made with all this awsome new cast too.  Nice one Nancy Meyers that's how you end 2020 !
This feels like it should've been released 5 months ago.
I love Steve Martin button
Well, this was unexpected. A pleasant trip down memory lane. Good job.
I’m not crying, you’re crying...
Ah dying!!
I'm a kid again
Good short piece.  Makes you want to see more FoB.....
What about her family? Is she an orphan?
That was bad!!  So not good!!
Let's all take those same 2 sleeping pills George took in #2, take a nap, and have someone wake us in 2021!!
Aw!!!!! Y'all made me cry!!!! BRAVO!!!!! I feel like Father of The Bride is a part of my life. : )
Getting real sick of multi millionaires asking us poor people to send donations...😒😒 yal the ones living in luxury while we live paycheck to paycheck to survive.
Loved the nod to Parent Trap 😍 brilliant beyond brilliant idea 💡 Nancy Meyers is the best!
This was adorable. De Niro was a wonderful surprise. I'd love to see a proper theatrical sequel!
Delightful. I'm smiling!! Thank you!

Where's Bryan?

Greatest thing to come out of COVID-19!!! Thank you Nancy for this awesome movie 😊👍❤
Billie Braff-Pugh! ❤️
Nostalgia
Love this 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Thank You for such a wonderful reminder of happier times. Loved Loved Loved it . Also will definitely donate to a wonderful cause
I'm not crying, you're crying 😢
I fell in love with Father of the Bride , I am watching it over and over. A 10+, It was amazing and sensational. Thank you Marilyn Azar
Rachel must be on a portal because of the zoom in feature.  LOL
Love this❤️❤️
😆  Diane Keaton has to COMPLETELY (TRY AND) hide her turkey NECK, like we DON'T know what's she's doing!!!!  😆 😆 😆.  That ALONE, detracts from ANYTHING the writers try and deliver--FOR ME!  AND PROBABLY THE REST OF THE WORLD!!  😆 😆 😆 😆 😆!!!!
Who the hell went into her hotel room and placed these?
Omg. I was just looking up Fronk scenes the other day! Loved both movies. And their house is my dream house.😊 thank you for this.
Frank didn't even age.
This is so cool I wish they'd make it into a movie... It would be so great an I would watch for sure
I love this show but its a big lie NO ONE wants to get married over zoom.
Cast?
i always wanted to know what Megan and George would look like when they get older! I love this thanks for sharing this and making 2020 just a little better.
Incredible!!! Loved it!! Great job, everyone!!!
Watching this I suddenly felt 12 years old, when I first saw and fell in love with these movies. Even though the theme is the damn virus, I felt like I was reuniting with family. Some things never change, glad to see the Banks and Makenzies are doing well!
Loved this! Didn't even know it was needed! Time for a full length feature.
Love 💘 so much!!
Oh I loved this! And for a great cause. Everyone looks great. Ready for a full length movie in 2021. Nancy Meyers,are u listening?!
2020 coronavirus pandemic:  Why nanotechnology should be this planet's #1 technological program. To be able to locate where this virus is at all times.
The wardrobe on the first two Father of the Brides has to be one of  the best wardrobes ever..
Honest to no god: Steve Martin just gave me an idea, not on how to remove a mask, but how to put one on: using long pencils. I have severe mobility (RA) problems with my elbows & hands: they can't flex & bend to get the mask straps around my ears. And I live alone, so nobody else can put a facemask on for me. Thanks, Steve!
This is THE BEST gift ever...Thank You for the memories and these characters. I want more!!!
hi
We're so used to actors NOT looking directly into the camera all the time  that now it seems strange when they do!
Love see allcastingfatherbrde
Soooo I’m just assuming that they will do a Feature length for Meghan’s wedding so they did this ish movie to marry matty really quick! This was just sooo amazing!! I cried so much
death by dialogue
It suck 💩
boycott netflix
Excellent movie. Thank you.
It's so weird to see Kieran on this now after seeing him on Succession.
A MUST! CONTINUE TO FEATURE THE MARRIAGE IS SOLEMLY A UNION TO CHERISHED FOREVER!
This was cute. I know I’m being picky but imho the reason why these movies were so wholesome was how picture perfect everything was. I don’t think a pandemic would ever happen in their “world”.
I must be the only one dissapointed, was expecting something better than a zoom call
You can have father of Bride 4 matt can get married like his big sister when this is completely finished great show I'm watching Father of Bride tonight
Thank god they shoe horned in a light skin black woman with her natural hair in here. Wow how progressive and inclusive of you. yuck
😀😂😀😂😀😂😂
My favourite movie of all time!
This was so cute!
Ok, to all the haters we all need a light when we need it. To the happy people this life you all up more. Relish the moments, we all need more of them now..   Life is complicated enough as it is. Watching this reminds me what’s more important it family, happiness not all this negative going on in our world. It doesn’t what you believe but we all need a light in this low part in this country. Peace is important, love conquers hate.
I hate to admit that I had never heard of Ben Platt, but I sure LOVED his sing at the end! Beautiful!
Ben Platt is looking rough 😂
If you didn’t cancel Netflix, you deserve to burn
Fah-bu-lous Dahlings
So cute.
If George can do it, we all can!
Amazing to see how views this has got! 😍 I loved this movie growing up, it’s so poignant now for many personal reasons - I’m hearing impaired, so disappointed theirs no captions.
Just make this a movie already please!!!!!!!!!!
LOL
I will always love the Banks Family. Father of the Bride is one of my all time favorite movies!
One of my top 3 all time favorite movies.  I watch these when I want to escape and see a bit of happiness on the screen.  PLEASE MAKE THIS A FULL MOVIE!!!!!!!!!  Houston, Texas
Biggest let down!!! I thought it would be a legit movie trailer or something for a 3rd one. Bleh. No one wants to watch this version. I mean, good intentions but....no.
Give the world what it wants, dammit!! Another Nancy movie about Florence’s wedding!!!
That was so good.  And, I really enjoyed it.  Thank you and I needed that uplifting almost 27 minutes !!!  Stay well everyone.  And, take care.  You only needed someone to be muted and forget that they were, ha ha ha.
Love love love !!!!
Hopefully they get a part three
2020: sucks The Banks family: not on our watch
It started off pretty awkwud like they need a brushing up on their acting but then it got funny  And entertaining ❤
This is... not awful but not great... kudos at the idwa tho
George will never forget paying for  Annie's wedding $250 a head 🤦‍♀
We neeeeed a full length part 3 😍😍😍😍😍
I need this to be a movie. I NEED THIS TO BE A MOVIE!!!   I love these movies so this feels like both so amazing and such a tease at the same time, but I'm so happy.
Wait so is Ben Platt and Florence Pugh supposed to be cousins?
Thank you for this. I made a whole deal out of it; brewed a fresh cup of coffee, sat UP,  tidied my space, etc. In other words, I WENT TO THE MOVIES 2020 style. For 20+ minutes I turned off the end times and enjoyed myself. And to have an action to take at the end that might make the teeniest positive difference in someone else's day was the best part. THANK YOU , THANK YOU.
Subtitles? Please. In Portuguese.
my dumbass for a solid half second: holy shit that was florence pugh and ben platt as BABIES??
Loved it! Need a part 3 Movie!!!
“Who’s been a TRUE fan of “Netflix” for OVER a year”😇”  “𝗶ᴍ ɢɪғT̶ɪɴɢ ᴇᴠᴇʀʏ✪ɴᴇ ᴡʜᴏ ʟɪᴋᴇs ᴀɴᴅ sᴜʙs ᴛᴏ ᴍᴇ" 😄🌹
This was everything I didn’t know I needed. These movies mean so much to me. And seeing them together again made me feel so incredibly happy. I sobbed when George spoke about Matty. I missed them so much. Thank you Netflix for doing this. I’m gonna watch it over and over.
This is amazing , creative people are awesome.
This short film proves we need the real full fledged part 3 movie !!
So it's like the princess bride home movies special on qubi and they all aged gracefully
Thank you for this 😊❤️
Just brilliant
I had COVID the past two weeks, but this made me feel so much better
this is so cute, a bit of nostalgia that really made my day ☺️
Most funny & enjoyable when we all need it most!
This film seriously needs to happen x
Omg how a, I sobbing at a 30 minute video?? 😍😍😍
Everyone looks lovely
my whole life changed with the help of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
These movies always make me cry, and this one was no different. Beautiful!
Good luck in GITMO
Hollywood perverts
Omg!!!! I want a long version of this. One of my favorite movies!!!
I appreciate the nostalgia!
Gitmo bound nasty ass actors
Wake uuuuuuup America
Pedophilia is pedowood  Pedowood is pizzagate  Pizzagate is pedophilia
Pedowood
My heart is warm ❤️and my eyes teary 😭 the nostalgia hits so hard. I looove this movie! Thank you for this sequel!
Hi, I just created a YouTube Channel!! Come check!!!
Lol i love this so freaking much
It feels awesome a 1993 movie managed to get #3 on trending so far
You nasty ass actors are disgusting
Oh damn!
Biggest cover up in Human History is Pedophilia in Pedowood
These people are sick
I just finished watching that movie it was good
Love it, So much!!!  Specifically because they did it for a good cause!!
This was so good. Thank you.
Why does Georgie look older than Matty tho?! 🤔😂😂
Thank you. 💕
I wish I could like this a 1000 times! This makes me nostalgic and brings tears to my eyes. Thank you for this❤
Can we just not. Hasn't 2020 been tragic enough
Pedophlix
I was obsessed with these movies when I was a kid, this just made me so happy!
Read article on U.S. covid cases: sad Watched Father of the Bride 3 (ish): happy again
ben platt and father of the bride i couldn’t ask for more
disappointed.. De Niro 👎🏼
The egos are going crazy and need attention ...these people are pathetic and covid19 has shown their true colours
Y’all gonna make a real movie right, because I got all the feels I got all those years ago I need you to make A movie with the birthday twins
When better times will come, there has to be part 4.
❤️
This was so smartly and charmingly done! I thoroughly enjoyed it.
We need a full length movie....❤️
This settles it....We NEED a part 3
I so love this and as stated before would love to see this as a full movie!!!
This was great! I think it would have been an incredible 90 minute movie! But I know it was to raise funds. So good choice!👰🤵Congratulations to the new couple!
This lady is still looking beautiful ! Never change!
Wow I'm excited too❤️
Hot take  The cast is great. The script is... Terrible
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈Non-Duality
Literally got all the feels! 😩❤
We really, really need a new movie about the Banks family next year.  Please.
I loved both movies so much . I need a part 3
This is awesome. 😭
Wow the memories! Its one of those feel good revival movies we really need at times like this. The way this short film is edited reminds me of an episode of Modern Family which is just as good and heart warming. ♥️  To see Robert De Niro is such a present surprise like what happens if they actually do a crossover with Meet the Fockers!
Brings me back to my childhood days crying with happiness while watching 😭❤
Ok we need an actual part three!!!!!! I grew up with the first and second one and even though this was cute! The thought we were getting an actual third one was beyond exciting!!! Do it!!!! Make a third one!!!! 2020 needs something awesome to look forward to in 2021! Actually make it into a Netflix series even!!! ❤❤❤
This was sooo awesome 👏🏻
absolutely outstanding!!!! thank you!!!!
OHMYGOD THIS IS EVERYTHING
Please we need part 3 🙏🏻
The nostalgia! I remember watching both movies and having my own big wedding like Annie and pretending my dad was George! I was really getting teary eyed at this 30 minute video. I laughed every second. The writing was perfect! It was like we got to jump into these characters lives again...old and new! They have to do a full length movie!!
ummmmmmmm Can I get a netflix real full length movie. We all deserve it after this year. I had to go actually check when father of the bride part II came out because I was like....Should they be this old?? Lol
I fuckin crying and laughing at the same time 😭  IM MANIFESTING THIS MOVIE INTO EXISTENCE PLEEEAASSEE!💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Every party has a pooper that’s why we invited you👉🏻  party pooper 🥳   party pooper 🥳
Simply Brilliant...Thank You for this lovely gift. Donating now. 🤍🥰
Aww! That's sweet! Matty married the girl he danced with at his sister's wedding! :)
Please please please can we get a movie please please please netflix
All I can think of while watching this is the vicious one liners Roman Roy would use on all these characters.
My all time favourite movie.I love Florence Pugh but she didn't fit as Megan for me,Annie was petite with this dark bushy hair when she was that age.They should have gone for a similar looking actress I feel.
I really want a full length movie!!
This is good. Steve Martin is Funny.
This is greatness. Made my day. I love these movies. ❤❤ What would make it even better, is if Martin Short popped up.....BAM. Then he does. Yes!!! 👍👍
Is that robert dinero as the bride's father ?
What! I love this! I just discovered and watched the 2 movies this summer.
I just loved it thanks so much netflix
I grew up with both movies in the 90’s and this brought back memories!!
The green screen kills it.
God I'm so emotionally watching this. I miss the 90s
That was SOOOO GOOD ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This really made me happy and help support a really worthwhile cause. Loved the way they were able to slip back into their characters. "Come on George! You are going to be the Grandfatherla!" HAHA!! : < )
This is amazing.
They don't need a marriage license in their state?
I think it's time to re-watch the movies.
BEN PLATT!!!
I laughed. I cried. My heart soared. I wished it was longer.
This was awesome!   I want more!     I love the family and the whole premise....please have an actual wedding post pandemic!
I am crying. 😭😭😭
Whoa Netflix streams on YouTube now?! Awesome
Diane Keaton is timeless 😚
Netflix should produce a feature length where they go to Tuscany to have an actual ceremony. Nice Planes, Trains and Automobiles style trip trying to get there.
Great movies and great short video! Brings back lots of memories! Make this a movie!
No need to constantly worry about the pandemic, DO NOT FEAR let God handle it..🧘‍♀️ God (AKA MotherNature TheUniverse All That Is Good In The World) is ALWAYS protecting us & guiding us! 🙏🥰 LOVE & fear are THE STRONGEST ENERGIES in the world and “they” know this so PLEASE CHOOSE WISELY❤️ edit: THE MIND IS SO ENDLESSLY POWERFUL THAT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE 🧘‍♀️❤️
Florence Pugh is shinning in this World 💖
Sheer joy! This movie IS my childhood. I couldn’t love it more and the music and soundtrack is beyond magical 💓 Please please please PLEASE make a full length movie!!! PLEASE!!! ☺️😍
This is the worst. I love the original movies but this is so bad.
This was BEAUTIFUL 🥰 Tears 😭 Now give us the FLORENCE PUGH MARRIAGE MOVIE NETFLIX!!!
I cried. I didn't know I still had a strong attachment to this movie series. Awww, Matty!
Florence Pugh .....swoon.
Netflix we need a full  length of  the movie!
Where are the captions???  George would not approve.
WICK MUST HAVE L*ST AN*THER I, HAVE U SEEN THE KITCHEN?
There is stuff here that netflix should greenlight a movie. I dont know if i would let Nancy right the screenplay. Story for sure.
Father of the Bride and a bubbe =)
Thank you Netflix for the amazing feeling I felt when I saw this video pop up.  The Father of the bride movies were my favorite growing up; I cried my eyes out during the first 10 minutes of this. I really hope that they do a third movie soon
Wow! This was absolutely brutal.  Funny how they even had to get the Interracial couple in, they checked every 2020 box didn’t they.
Thank you so much. This is FANTASTIC!
The Dislikes must have been from the Swans who weren’t invited back.
Steve Martin was about 45 when the first movie was released (I checked).  I’m 41 now.  This makes me feel old.
Funny questions :  1-Why do you put a round pizza in a square box and eat it in the shape of a triangle? 2-Why in the store, when you come just to look, do you have at least 3 salespeople on your back, and when you want to buy, you can't find any or are they all busy? 3-Why in the films do people on foot, chased by a car, always run on the road instead of crossing on the sides? 4-If snacking at night is bad, what use is the light in the fridge? 5-Why when you can not connect to the Internet, Windows offers to find a solution on the Internet? 6-Why is it written on shampoos: "does not sting the eyes" ... while on the back is written: "in case of contact with the eyes, rinse immediately"? 7-Why the closer we get to our home, the more we want to pee?
So sweet loving and happy! It was perfect. I just hope world kitchen got lots of donations.
Father of the Bride is one of my all time favorites! Please Netflix make a full length Part 3!
I can swallow the excessive/slighty cringey virtue signalling going on just to see Steve Martin and Martin Short play George & Franck again! And of course the nostalgia the rest of the cast gives me! 😍
I hope they make a full length father of the bride part 3!!
Finally, maybe there is still hope for 2020. God how i loved these movies. 💕
Wow  this so well done absolutely loved it.  A big thank you to everyone involved.  This is fabulous. It is so great to see all the cast together again. They really do still work together so well the chemistry is still so strong. It is amazing even with a 25 year break in between  It just feels like they never left.. I love the 2 movies that were made and really hope that you make the next movie the one which has been so long all the fans have been waiting for. To help continue the story. This mini movie clip just reinforced and proves the next chapter needs to be made. Once again well done to everyone involved and I cant wait to see the full movie when it is made.
This trip down memory lane has brought the biggest smile on my face during this pandemic. Absolutely fabulous!!!
Love it xxx
I was so hoping Martin Short would show up. I am not disappointed. They casted well for the additional characters, also.
There's no captions for the 30 million Americans who have a hearing loss :(
Yaradan beni 2007 de bir gecede  ıslah etti ve 2017  e kadarda eğitti vede ilk emrini 2019 da fakirlik haramdır diye vahyetti ve  bakın kardeşlerim Rabbimiz nediyor kendilerini Benim  dostum olarak ilan ettikleriniz ki,bilirseniz bu çok büyük bir söz ve bu sözle üzerinize büyük bir azabı çektiniz.Siz kutsal kitapları okuyup durduğunuz halde neden ihtiyaçtan fazlasını verin,fakirlerin hakkını verin,Faiz yemeyin  demiyorsunuz eğer Bu sözleri söyleseydiniz ülkelerinizde fakirlik olmaz idi çünkü sizler çokluğuyla övünenler tüm cemaatler ve tarikatler,hiristiyanların lideri papa yahudilerin hahamları sizler Rabbimizin sevgisi için değil  dünyalık ve saltanat için insanları  kullandınız,Ama hayır çok yakında sizler ve size inananlar azabı göreceksiniz ve yaptıklarınızdan hesaba çekileceksiniz. RABBIMİZ güzel sözlü ve doğruyu söyleyendir..!
This was just straight cringe!! As someone that grew up on these movies. Disappointed. Why make it so corana based? Had absolutely nothing to do with the old storyline and felt so awkward,and don't get me started on the actors they chose to play the twins ughh
I love how their families were part of the “at home production crew” in the credits ❤️
Ohhh I get it... *Part 3 (ish) Black-ish* 👏💥👏
Please at least promise to make a full one after the pandemic 😭😭
Thank you so much for this everyone!! 😭 I’ve been hoping for another film for ages and I hope we get a full sequel soon 🙌🏻
Where was B.D. Wong as Howard Weinstein?
Please do a Part 3. I need it. The world needs it. My unborn kids need it. ❤ This was a wonderful surprise. Thank you!
How sweet is this? Absolutely precious!
Is this available in uk ?
So are they going to sell Ben's cover as a single?
Am in tears this needs to be a movie! 😭🖤
Please make a Father of the Bride Christmas Movie!!  Please! Please! please!!
Just what I needed to see in 2020 🥳
Please, oh please!! I'm so ready for 3 😁
laciniate pandour
Considering this was made during a pandemic LOVE it. Can’t wait for another full movie 😊😊
They should do a fresh prince crossover where the banks family meets the... banks family.
Who is Matt's girlfriend played by?
this is so sweet! Thank you
this is so awesome
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
one of my fave movies of all time!
I want to see Matty's wedding after the pandemic. Imagine scenes with  Steve Martin and Robert De Niro, hilarious.
So is Netflix working on this ???? This should happen
BEN PLATT IS ANNIE'S SON OMG OMG OMG
God entered into my body, as a body. my same size. worlds only holy ghost . God entered into my body, as a body. my same size. worlds only holy ghost filled christian. please subscribe to my channel.
Love Part 1 and Part 2.   The first film is one of the best remakes of all time.  But this here is just cringe and not well written guys.  This deserved much better.
A wonderful followup to the movies and a great short for our times, thank you so much for the memories.
Check my channel for funny tiktok videos
We needed this 😭
What a gift in this strange time!  Thank you!
i screamed when i saw who were playing babies Megan and George... and i didnt stop screaming since. this is adorable!
Excellent casting! I feel like this needed a better script though.
Ugh...no thanks!
I totally forgot that Steve Martin has looked 70 since he was 30
so sweet i cried the entire time
Yes Part 3.... its been a long time...
Idk why, but i’m SMILING SO BIG right now 😂

I am sooo excited!!! GAHHH!!!  CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE THE 3RD ONE NETFLIX?! PLEASE!!! I remember watching the part 1 and 2 ever since I was a little girl and my father is the one that watched it with me. He always made plans how my wedding should be. Now i am about spend my life with the love of my life, my father is not around anymore...this movie has an attachment to me.
movie please.
they are probably testing the waters to see if there is still an audience, and there certainly is
This is the best thing that I saw on YouTube. Its great. It's just what we need right now. Good laughter and love for your family.
Franc!!!!!!!
Wow.  This gave me all the feels.  Please, please, make this into a real feature length film.
Two thumbs up for this!
This is so disappointing
We need a third one.
How sweet, we need more of these feel good movies period who would not donate after watching this.

Fabulous. SO fun to watch. Perfectly cast.
I didn’t know how much I needed this, literally sitting on my couch sobbing!! I need the full length!!
Oh, how I needed to see this.  Tears of sorrow, tears of joy, tears of life.  Thank you entire cast and crew and Nancy.  I donated.
I loved this SO MUCH
I love this!!!♥️♥️♥️  Why am I crying and laughing at the same time? 😄😄😢😢
Make a full length film. I love this movie. :-)
This is weird, they're all old now. Annie looks crazy different.
How can you not feel good after watching this? I definitely want more!
This was the best!!
Feelers anyone? Why not? Let's do this, Netflix & Disney work it out. Robert DeNiro, what a nice surprise!
What does Reese Witherspoon have to do with this?
This made me so happy, I cried. Please make the movie, we need it. Xoxo
I always thought it would be cool to have another movie and they'd all be grown up and Annie and Bryan had a girl I know they don't have it in the 2nd movie but doesn't mean they couldn't have a girl in the process anyways they had a girl and she was all grown up and George ( Steve) would help Bryan thru the it seens that he already been thru it I thought that would be a funny idea
When I go to the Netflix link above and search for this, it doesn't appear.  Nice work, Netflix. Good thing I know how to access YouTube on my tv.
Okay Netflix make this a full length feature film!!!!!!!
This video is AWESOME!!  It made my week as just what we need in this oppressive times!!!  We NEED a full Part 3 movie.  Sure need a tissue handy when watching the video.  Just REALLY SPECIAL!!  Thanks for this creation & to the wonderful cast.
George Newbern (the groom) looks like Tucker Carlson!
Robert denirro best acting award
they really need to make a 3rd movie, please !!!
I’m pretty sure this made my YEAR
This really made my day, even my year!!! Finally the Banks family back again. So much fun to watch. Netflix this is a great intro to part 3. Tuscany or any where else in the world, please make it happen. The whole setup between James (De Niro), and George is just awesome and would mean fireworks.  I will watch this many times and now hope for the full part 3!!! Thanks so much everyone for making this. Will go and Donate now!!!
This is great—I Loved the “Four weddings and funeral” Red Nose Day special too.
I wasted 25 minutes of my life. This is not worth the hype and full of propaganda. It is so poorly done and not even funny.
Very corny and political. Leave it to Hollywood....
Absolutely brilliant!  Nancy Meyers is a genius!  We want more! ❤️❤️❤️
Please please please make a full length part 3! This short was MAGICAL! We need this right now!
Like a tonic for the soul - thank you so much
Why am I crying? Loved it.
Full length version, pleeeeeease!!!
Well done!
Omgoodness matty I am crying happy tears now they should make a 4th movie too
Please , as soon as  possible  make another movie, Father of Bride.  All of the actors and actress compliment  each other. I laughed , cried, but all in happy tears. This is just what the doctor ordered for a long 2020.
This had to be the best thing ever! I LOVED THIS!!
Now you have to make 4. We need baby’s wedding. 😃
Ok ready for the whole thing now, someone make this happen.
To those who said thumbs down...who hurt you?
that was EPIC!!!! we need a full length movie!!
It was awesome best of the father of the bride movies
I love Fronk
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️i from Brazil!🇧🇷 love,love!
This is total ass. Propaganda at it’s finest.
I love seeing positive comments, that is all I and we need right now!!
omg florence and ben really look like they’re siblings
One of the best movies ever!
Stupid bi*tch
Remove cuties
I love this; the entire cast and Nancy Meyers.
I pray and hope that they make another movie out of this. It's such a cute and amazing movie.
Thank you to the cast for coming together to do this! I love love loved the way the plot went and it even brought a tear to my eye!
Just what we needed in 2020! A feel good movie!! 😍
Big smile on my face...
16.9 million people watched this, multiply that by 2.5 and you get 84.5 million potential movie goers to see an actual part 3! Make the movie!!
*Didn't George and Nina have a baby also in part 2?*
Please make a 3rd movie where the other girl get married and then make a 4th where she has a kid
*They don't make feel-good movies like this anymore. Netflix should buy the rights and make father of the bride part 3*
Make the movie pleaseeeee
Omg I love it thanks thanks I cant stop crying
Why isn't this trending??!!!
Cute follow up(ish) to  2 epic movies that will live on!Thank you for doing this!
This was so cute. I love this cast so much, they just feel like a real family. A whole 3rd movie could've saved 2020 for me though.
This is a joke right.... wtf is this shit.
This was so heartwarming and I am so happy glad I watched it 😍😍😍🥰
This movie was amazing. Thank you for doing it and making it available for us to watch on Netflix. We are donating today. Please make it a full length feature!
Parts one and two have always been my favorite! This was such a happy reunion to see! 💕
I flippin love Ben Platt
Alexandra Shipp 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I love this so much! I’m over here crying lol
My mom passed away yesterday and loved these movies and Ben Platt. This hits a little harder today. She would’ve loved this ♥️
Everything about this is AMAZING. All we are missing is Eugene Levy.... aspiring wedding singer in Part 1 and Mr. Habeeb in Part 2.  This was so beautifully done. I always have and always will adore Steve Martin and Diane Keaton as well as KWP and George Newbern.  Thanks so much for this!!! It is making this difficult time a little brighter.
It's so sad seeing Steve Martin with white hair.
Forgot to say thank you for this maens a lot
Show of hands who wants an actual part 3 ✋
I want to watch the father of the bride on Netflix please
Ifrom puerto rico saludos a todos i love you guys  god bless all
Robert De Niro was a disappointing addition otherwise this was appropo for the times.  We watched both movies before the zoom call.  Back when movies were love and magic.
Nancy Meyers makes this world a better place with every movie she makes
Love it! (And Kieran is still very good-looking!) I agree--we need a full-length version!
Yes, we definitely need a Part III feature!  This was too cute!
Awww, it would have been nice for the 25-yr anniversary to have actually done a full-length film where both his daughter and grandson are getting married and both he and Annie are going a little insane (both coming from a “long line of over-reactors”). Oh well, I guess I just have to survive off of this happy little surprise. Well done and for a great cause!
Where's George Bern?
Perfection!!
I could cry 😢 ❤️❤️❤️
Simple amazing!!! Loved it!
This was wonderful!  Thank you and I donated.
I am crying! This just made my morning!
I’m not crying 😭 I’m not crying 😭...please continue this franchise. 🙌🏽
chick flick 1000 percent .....
I have the premise . Florence Pugh character marries Robert DeNiro son. It’s still Father of the Bride !
Make this happen for real! Oh the tears! my favourite movie of all time! 💖💖💖
Netflix!! Do the right thing, come on, bring us Father of the Bride 3!! This is excellent with perfect additions to the already wonderful cast
This has been a very difficult time and this makes me feel happy!! Love how the Family is so together. It still moved me. WELL DONE
Why do youtubers have better sound quality than netflix? 🤣
boy am i crying right now
I AM UGLY CRYING!!!!! OMG THIS IS THE BEST PART 3 (ISH) EVER! THANK YOU THANK YOU NANCY MEYERS, THE CAST AND NETFLIX! 💜
I remember going to see them both at the movies with my mom and lil sister. I will STILL watch on tv whenever they're on...please Netflix? I'll pay you, I promise.** very nice. A little "we're in a pandimic and we're ok with it!" But really cute. I adore Ben Platt...amazing how wonderful-ie: the same-everyone looks. Hope y'all do this soon.
OMG I loved this! I really needed something so amazing !  I just wish there was more !!
A creative endeavor that truly delights. A great cause. Donation sent. Thank you.
I was up at 12:30am in my time zone, and waited for this to go live. Best decision ever!!! I watched it all and ended up sleeping with a big smile on my face 😊 There should be a part 3! This is such a feel-good movie ❤
What a great and original idea from Netflix. You guys made my eyes wet. Congrats! Greetings from Brazil! 🇧🇷
Father of the Bride 3- Megan (Francis Pugh) gets married!!! IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
Thank you so much for this! I’ve wanted part 3 since 1995 and this was perfect!
Loved it! So sweet! Made me cry! :)
Omg that was so great to see. Tears of joy are flowing!!!
Loved it! That was so cool. Everyone was amazing. I will be donating and I hope we get a full movie.
Yes I do agree Netflix should make father of the bride part 3 because I loved part 1 & part 2
This was very well done and a lot of fun.
I got teary. And that song!!!!
This was Perfect!
Hope this goes to video
*'Kimberly Williams looks remarkably like my older sister (closing-in on 70!)  only my 'Big Sissa' is MUCH older* *I wouldn't mind seeing a 'Threequel' to the 'Banks' family, IF the script is good!* (Like one of the 'kids' is nominated for some high Office or some other event that can involve the whole family, and of course George wants to 'take over' running it...and sooner or later 'Frank/Fronck' shows-up to 'dress-up' everyone...and somehow George is being considered for 'Governor of California' thru some weird chain of events)
Please Netflix make  part 3/4/5 omg I loved it  I still remember every word from every movie 🍿
OMG I am crying 😢 😭 🤧 😫....
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
So happy!
Admit it, we need a Part 3 for this to have a trilogy.
We need a full length movie now!!  🎥
Amazing!
Thank you Nancy and all the cast!! Please make a full length, just the medicine we need right now 🎥🙏❤️
Need a full length feature film please. I missed all of them.
Amazing i Love It
Ok. We need Father of the Bride 3 movie!
Did anybody else notice that Kevin Nealon and Zack Braff were part of the at home production crew?  I wonder who they were with in filming
😍😍😍
excellent! I agree there needs to be a full length feature....maybe Rachel giving birth.......
😍😍😍
A needed sweet surprise. Well done to Nancy, Diane, Steve and the team on this one.
I heard they used the freshest cringe made from the finest cheese to make this.   Edit: would’ve been better if they made an actual movie.
Father of the Bride 1&2 are 2 of my favorite movies of all time. I still use the Martin Short accent ocassionally 25 years later. And my favorite is that I just introduced my 8 and 9 year old daughters to the movies 2 weeks ago, now this!!! I couldn't be more thrilled!!
Amazing ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This was perfect 💜
اكو عرب ب نيت فلكس 😂😂😂
I’m sure they can make this a full length movie... they want an official wedding because the pandemic is over, fathers competing to pay for the wedding.... any thoughts? How will you add on to the storyline? How do you think the movie will go?
Absolutely well done!!! Hit all the major points of the movies we love in this mini sequel. The inclusion was beautiful. The continuation of the story line smartly put together <3! My mother and I adored these films. Though I wish I could watch it with her, and I wish she would've had the chance to be the "Mother of the Bride", I know she would have truly enjoyed watching this<3<3<3!!!   P.s. I didn't know I needed a horror/thriller with Florance Pugh (Megan) and Alexandra Shipp (Rachel) until JUST NOW. Continue to make my dreams come true Netflix!!!!!
BEN PLATT
Make the movie!
Please do a 4th with the youngest daughter I need this in my collection ❤❤❤❤❤❤🤗🤗🤗🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
They did this very well! It wasn’t a script read or just a recreation of the old movies. Well done and thank you!
This was absolutely AMAZING!! FATHER OF THE BRIDE WAS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER!!! Literally so awesome! 😁😁
Made me cry...
We need this!!!!!
And here we go again with the bending 🙄🤦🏽‍♂️
I was a big fan of this movie the way they brought the babies 👶🏾 back
Why i am crying? Diane Keaton is brilliant!
Thank you! This movie(ish) was exactly what I needed today!
This is just a Zoom but it's good as one and two of the original movie
This is great!
Make this into a full feature!!
I already watched AGAIN!!! My goodness I miss this people!! YES! WE NEEDED THIS!!! It’s being a such difficult year, and nothing like watching the Bank’s family back!
LOVED this!!
Loved this!!!
Ben Platt was perfect as always
Fantastic!! Absolutely FANTASTIC!!!!!! ❤️🥰❤️
PLEASE MAKE THIS INTO AN ACTUAL LONG MOVIE!!
Oh thank you. I sorely needed this bit of happy.
Loved it except for DeNiro but George is the best!! So my dad😊
Just wonderful!  Exactly what we needed right now!  Donate!
Oh this is Wonderful 👏 ❤ 😍 ♥  We need this in our life!
Thank you for this beautiful mini movie! My father passed away this year and he was a huge fan of Steve Martin—me too! Love the entire cast and would so look forward to a feature film sequel in the future.
Absolutely adorable. Well done!!!!
Omg. This was so good. Who would have guessed this would happen. Thank you Covid?  I hope a full movie comes out now.
This warms my soul and heart
Oh pure joy is this 😍😍😍😍😍
Awesome❤️❤️❤️
Thank you! What a comfort and a joy this was to watch. You all look beautiful Xx
started crying at the opening music
Oh I want this to be a real movie!!! 💗
I loved this. Such great memories of being a kid and seeing them for the first time. I bet they're going to actually make a 3rd full length movie. This was just a test to see the interest.
My childhood 😢
This was great!!! Except Ben platt he sucks
Father of the Bride 3 should be Megan getting married to a woman. The premise should be her fiancés father and George argue about who can throw the better wedding “Father of the Brides” there’s your title lol but who could play the other father?
This made me cry, I grew up on this movie and I’m so happy I got to relive this moment with them
So Bryan and Annie didn't hyphenate their son's last name nor give him an alternative last name afterall. They just went with Mackenzie. I'm so glad, and so pleased to finally know what they decided to do after wondering since 1995, haha.
Omg this is amazing 🥰🥰🥰
I loved this but it’s such a tease! 😩 I wonder if “I’ll hug you in 2021” is trying to tell us something?! I sure hope so! ❤️ ❤️❤️
Omg why am i in tears i need this to be an actual movie i loooove it!!!
How is Annie still the best looking girl in this film at her age? Like, damn!
So much fun, and Heart warming as the movies were,  still enjoy them.  Thank you Cast!!!! 🌈🙏🏽🎊🎉🥳🦋💕🕯💎😍
Megan and Rachel look similar.
انا عربي هل من عرب جام
Wait what she’s Ben Platt’s mum?! Aren’t they the same age?
WOW -  Lots emotions here  when watching this video. All of them so great!!  It was fun. Thank you
How did I know Rachel was going to be black as soon as they mentioned her?
Omg this is the best.
Ben Platt as Annie's boy, not realistic, he looks older than her!
Omg this movie was already perfect and they throw in Robert de Niro?! Omg can’t handle this!!
Ah man, this is one of my fav, what a pleasant surprise!!
I love this...but it needs to be a movie. This family requires visual dimensions to help you breathe outside of how...suffocatingly smushy they can be.  I feel like Banks wouldn’t be such a fan of social distance life.
This was just what we all needed, just so lovely and joyous..proves we need a real Part 3 soon! Also makes me smile so much to see my hero Steve Martin on-screen again. Bravo to all!
I have always been a fan great movies all of them .
Please put Brooklyn nine nine season 6 into finland.
This is the Sequel that I did not see that coming!
3 minutes in and I was already bawling my eyes out! Such a good movie, one of my favorites by far. NETFLIX please stop making canceled tv shows and invest in good old movies that you can totally see that has a loooot of fans.
I didn't even realize how much I needed this until I heard about it. So brilliant!
CRYING  Loved it!  One of my favorite movies.  As soon as the wedding song started, just like the original.  I started to cry!!
You have no idea how happy this made me. Please make an actual Part 3. Loved seeing these characters again. And the additions to the cast were excellent like casting Florence Pugh as Megan is just perfect and Ben Platt as Georgie you can't ask for anything better.
In a world where holy matrimony is so insignificant and meaningless, the vowels will be done over a zoom conference. Does this propaganda make you want this future for our children, are you buying into it?  this had to be written red lit and go through so many stages before it got finished how does that make you feel?
PLEASE bring this back. Watching this live last night made my heart burst. Such an amazing idea and a blast from the past.
Absolutely loved this! I wish they would make this into a part 3! I love these characters 💖 so fun!
Next movie should be George’s gay wedding
We need a part 3 in cinemas!
I screamed when I saw Florence Pugh playing Megan, it’s perfect!
this really good so sweet. hope there will someday be a full movie. i used to watch both father of the bride movies tons of times as a kid a lot of times i watched them with my mom. there no violence nor trashy movies. sentimental there thats the word
why God  must Netflix subject me to the worst crap possible?
I have always been a fan of the first two. THANK YOU for this!!!!❤️❤️❤️
I love Robert de Niro
Omg we sure need them to make a next part when this pandemic ends, see what future things could happen, maybe another grandchild for George and Nina
ALT BALAJI SIRF 20 RUPEY ME 3 MAHINO KE LIYE AGR APAKO BHI KARNA HAI TO MUJE 7738787394 IS PAR MESSAGE KRE
This is genius. And fun! 😄
Also: Nancy Meyers absolutely mastering the quarantine video with those sleek camera angles!
FLO PUGH IS IN THIS AHHHHGGGG YASSSSSSSS
Давно не видел такой паршивой  актёрской игры.
Kieran Culkin has always been the underrated Culkin brother..he's amazing! I love this! Father of the Bride was such an awesome movie!!
Aaaawwwwwwwww ❤❤❤❤❤❤... Thank you sooooooo much Netflix
Renew Dark Crystal!!!
Yes! More please!
I'm crying 😭😭😭
Netflix please make this an movie!!!!
omg i am bawling i never thought id see the cast together again
I'm not crying, you're crying!😭😭😭 This was AMAZING!! Definitely NEED a full length,  ABSOLUTELY LOVE this cast! The chemistry, the writing, everything! This was a great way to start my morning!
I’m crying. Sod off you haters with the thumbs down, go and get a bloody life.
This was amazing😭😭😭😭 We need more!!!
Diane keaton looks amazing!!!
Wow didn’t know how much I needed to see this right now!!! Thank you Reece for making this happen and my heart is so happy right now!!!! Love the Banks family!!!!!!! ❤️❤️
Omg 😆 super cornball zoom calls zoom wedding this was so odd seriously
Please please please make another full length film, we need something good after this horrible time ❤️
Awww this brought back all the feels. Loved it . Can we get a full movie in 2021
They seriously need to do a full length movie again, the obviously still have the fans. These are my fav movies of all time and i was so over joyed when they said they were doing this. I keep watching it over and over. Gonna watch the movies tonight x
Anyone else going to rewatch the father of the bride movies???
This is PERFECT.
I mean no this is an awful idea, the couple need to at least be together but it's nice they all came together
When are planning to take kissing booth 3  I am waiting
De Niro as the next Father of the Bride?! Now that’s a surprising turn of events 😂😊
This was amazing!!!
I was just talking about this movie maybe 2 months ago on IG stories, and then this happened. My prayers were answered. 🥰 Except I wish it was an actual full length movie.. and not on zoom! Father of the Bride has such a special place in my heart. It reminds me of my dad, and watching this movie with him growing up. I’m the oldest daughter, and was the first to leave the nest. When I left, my sister said she and my dad watched Father of the Bride again, and my dad said it reminded him of me and when I married and moved away. 😪😪
I based my own wedding on this movie so it feels like coming home. Thanks for giving me something I didn't know I needed.
Excellent 😊
That was actually really sweet. Well done.
This would have been amazing if it weren’t for all the propaganda within it. The cast still have chemistry though which is great to see
WHY ISN'T REESE AGING
This made my heart so happy 😭 Netflix please, make a third movie.
Thank you for this!  I think a lot of us REALLY needed it. Everyone was amazing and it proves there is still a lot of gas in this engine. Please do a full length movie to continue the story. Nancy Meyers is still able to make us laugh and cry, and the actors, both old and new, are absolute perfection. Please, please, please, let us keep being part of the Banks family story as they start a new chapter.
Thankyou Ben Platt for blessing our ears and being part of this, one fo the best films!!😭😍💖
Loved it!! Please, put subtitles in different languages, Father of the Bride has fans all over the world!!!
I didn’t know what this was going to be, but I needed it and I love it! Full length film needed!
Ben platt’s voice 😭😭
Pretty cool...
This was great whish it was longer
That little classic monologue from George 😭😭😭😭😭
Robert DeNiro?!!!!!!! WHAT
These movies have totally marked me!! Just had our wedding and we totally themed it liked “father of the bride 1” and also had “the way you look tonight” as our wedding song!!! This part 3ish was perfect!!! Love it love it love it!!!!! Please Netflix, make this into a full film!!!!!!!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Steve Martin Legend 🙌
Oh wow! Cried from the second it started!!! 😭❤️ This was incredible! X
So sweet. Need a full movie now
These are the best movies ever. We watch them over and over again. Fantastic actors that bring such happy moments memories and laughter into our lives at the touch of a button. True classics!
Bawling my eyes out as soon as I heard the music! I loved these movies so much, was perfect! Now we just need a full length feature!
FLORENCE PUGH?! BEN PLATT?!! OH MY GODDD 2020 is not too bad after all
Loved every minute of it
JUST. MAKE. THIS. DAMN. MOVIE.
I can’t stop smiling. This is my childhood
PLEASE COME OUT WITH A FULL LENGTH FEATURE FILM PART THREE
Couldn't stop smiling throughout the whole thing 😁
Please make a father of the bride part 4 2021❤❤❤
Love both movies from 1991 and 1995❤❤ Love father of the bride part 3❤❤
Florence pugh anddddd ben platt are you kidding meeeee
Not crying at this you are.
This was great.
No captions. :(
Netflix better make a third movie!!!!!
I loved this!!! The little 90's girl in me was all giddy watching. I hope Netflix picks this up as a series. Question though: Where was BD Wong?? It would have been complete with him there. And all for charity, that was great!
❤
This was so special! Thank you Nancy and cast! 25 years later and the chemistry, charm, (and gorgeous interiors) are still all there. Loved the throwbacks - laughed and cried! A raving success, so how about a full length feature in 2021? 😍🤞🏻
Love it!!!
So great. I Feel all warm. They Should Really make a whole movie out of this.
💕💕💕💕💕
This was very much needed!!
Loved this so much. This absolutely proved that a Part 3 movie would be a welcome addition to the family. So let’s make it happen hey folks?
OMG!!  YAY!!!!!
This was great!
i want the subtitles  for well to learn english beautiful women 😋
I think the first two movies were much better.
Absaloutley loved this these where my fav movie's
Netflix needs to makes this a movie
I hope the bride in this movie is over the age of 18.... But with netflix you never know.......
Super cute short film and makes light of the situation were all in, being stuck at home 🏡
This was perfect. But what would make even better would be to put on the big screen. The cast still has it and I can safely say it left us all wanting more. Someone make this happen! 🎂
LOVED IT! I've missed this family so much. Hoping for a full length movie too :)
Aww 😭😭😭😭😭👏👏👏👏
i think this is actually enough, a small "catch-up" . some movies just need to be left where they finished! not everything needs a lot of sequels
This is so cute!!!
Omg I loved this so much ❣️ thanks Netflix this was much needed
Omg actual tears. That was just so sweet.
Such a great surprise! Thank you all und thank you for Bobby ♥️ the real part 3 must come soon!
This was so cute, with a huge dose of nostalgia thrown in! Actually had me in happy tears!
All I see is Roman Roy 😭
I'm actually crying! I can't believe a half an hour short got me so invested. Love, love, love it! x
I love this so much.  This is the only film I keep watching for the last 20 years of my life.. Now that I'm fighting a second cancer in my life..I always had a dream to see my daughter graduated and getting married and live the same  happy moments as the film .. Thank you so much for making us all happy again for the third time..😍
I cried 😭😭😭😭😭
The entire smile I couldn't stop smiling, thankyou bonks family❤️
Omg 😳 omg 😱 my ❤️ is so happy 😀 🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈
I'M NOT CRYING YOU ARE
I got so excited to watch this, but I need more!! Who do I need to talk to?? Love love the father of the bride movies
This was the best reunion of 2020
Do it in full length now!!!!!!!!!!
This is my childhood, righ there! Great memories!!!
Totally loved this
Can you please continue season 4 my hero academia
Yawn. How dumb!
Yes. Just yes
Just the idea of ​​making a movie this way is brilliant. It proves that even covid-19 can not stop creative people.👍
Wow! 👏  Incredible pandemic achievement.
both movies should be added to Netflix
I loooove Steve Martin  🕊💙🏄‍♀️ .  This makes me remember the relationship with my sweet  father , what kind a husband I dream and what marriage I have  ... I want  a divorce  !  Thank you Netflix 😘🕊⛵  you make me remember  that  ...I'm not dead  yet ( I have  blood  pressure ) , I deserve better  . 🏄‍♀️
Florence pugh and ben platt. Wow!
To all the cast, writers and crew. You have crafted something really special, something we needed in this unprecedented time. I feel so much better Knowing the Banks family are together and back in 2020. Please make just one more FOTB we all could use it.
This was soo cute thank you for a much needed wholesome movie during this time of  uncertainty . I love Father of the Bride ! Well done 👏!  Would love to see the entire movie.
They need to make this into a full length movie
One good thing came out of the pandemic... ZOOM being a big part of creative acting. And, of course, this 3rd “film”. I loved 90s movies.
Loved it!!!👏👏👏👏 I can't believe that when I saw you all, tears started to roll down my face! These have been horrible times for everyone, and seeing you safe, and having us all thrilled with this "new" wedding, but with the "old" warm feeling of giving and love, has just been a precious gift....thank you all for this, and keep safe🙏💕💕
I wanted to watch something fun and light hearted to get away from this Covid crap.  Not have it continually shoved down my throat. Disappointed
Brilliant beyond brilliant!! 🥰
No, I’m not ugly crying.
My favorite movies of all time, I watch them over and over and over and over I cry and have the same emotions. Agree, Part 3 is overdue and the actors and actresses still got it, love them all, specially Steve Martin and Diane Keaton 💓
Movie or series pleaseeee
Kieran Culkin is such a GREAT actor!
So and who is writing the script for the real part 3 now ? :D
I LOVED IT!!!!! it was the cutes ever!! i laughed i cried it was definitely a treat and the best treat thus far in a crappy 2020
We need more of the Banks family. Please Netflix, make it happen.
Oh this was so great. Please make a 3rd movie for real. Loved the first 2.  This made me so happy after such a hard & hectic year. Thank you everyone and Netflix. ❤
Wow! Makahilak ta'g popcorn.
Omg I loved 1 and 2. I am literally 😢 crying .... Please please part 3 needs to happen
We need a full length feature film.
Please please please please please please please please please please please please make this into a movie once the pandemic is over!
Best movie
Just the best up lifting 30 minutes I’ve had since March 19th. Thank you to cast & crew! And for a good cause. Great idea!
No bad all around, spouses get married face to face, war zones and hospitals.   Stupid hype
When Alexandra Shipp appeared...I literally leapt out of my seat!
How lame.
Definitely need to make this a movie.
I would love to see a part 3 full length! Come on Netflix let’s do it
I am just crying rn. I love these movies so much.  I have seen both feature film a hundred of times. And I would probably watch this feature the same way. Please do a full one after all this is over.
I loved this except 2 things: 1. COVID theme (can we please forget about it already??) 2. Robert DeNiro
Need this movie ... Netflix do your thing
A little cheesy and wooden at times-- and yikes, some of the acting--, (which honestly was I think the fault of the script -- I mean, an impromptu zoom wedding?) but I know everyone had to work with what they had. Maybe they had a time restraint. Good reunion nonetheless. I would love to see a third film!
This was so great!  A full movie would be such a wonderful treat! Nancy Meyers I am thankful this pandemic brought this to mind for you and you along with everyone else made this happen.. even after retirement!  Thank you for doing this.. and for bringing back a little joy!! Love the Banks!!
Can you guys put rocky movies or something
Thank you, Banks family 😊😊😊👏🏽👏🏽
Love this! 👆 I wish all the actors would do their Reading Zooms like this! Brought me to tears. 😢💖
Well, well, well... this was just way too precious!!!  What an awesome way to end my birthday week -- THANK YOU 'BANKS' Family... what a reunion!!!!!  Congrats to Matt & Rachel!!
That was soooo cute, that was one of my favorite movies.  I can’t count how many times I’ve watched this movie.
That was so cute!
This is sooooo amazing!
This was beautiful n very emotional. Brought back memories...God bless!💕
I love this 😭 I needed this!
Ahh very cool. Not going to watch and support pedophiles though. Anybody who tries to put a movie on netflix needs to be shutdown for pedophilia.
Omg love it. Florence & Ben were perfect additions!!
This caused much tears omg would love another movie
And the Banks family saves 2020 ❤️
Okay, you HAVE to make a Part 3 Movie!!!!!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I laughed and I cried so hard.
OMG I love this movie ...the actors Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, and Kimberly Paisley! Can't wait to watch it!!!
I hate this trend of Zoom call productions. I’m so over Covid. Everything is the same now. The awkward pacing of the dialogue in this was cringy. The reasoning the characters gave for why each one was on a separate zoom account was cringy. The blatantly emotionally manipulative, thin plot was cringy. Either make the whole movie or don’t. This was painful.
Best thing I've seen in a really long time. I didn't know how much I needed this!! 🙏💜
"We're living in a tough time and we don't know how to do this or how it's going to turn out, but we've managed to stay ok. All these months. Because we have each other."
"Father of the Groom" would be perfect, a great way to have a trilogy :-) ahhh omg
Such an amazing cast and the new additions are perfect!!!
That was cute! 🥰😍
I loved this so much. Wholesome ✨♥️
For 26 minutes and 45 seconds,  2020 was not horrible, but rather splendid and joyous. It amazed me a bit how much I forgot just how much I loved these characters!!! This was just the right amounts of silly and lovely and nostalgic and wonderful.
this took me out of a depressive episode omg
The Banks family is exactly what we want these days....truly heartwarming...
♡♡♡♡♡♡♡ LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!
My wife actually cried when George spoke about how kids grow up and the moments are treasures. She was clutching our 1 year old sobbing....I could have sworn someone was cutting onions at the moment my eyes had some droplets watching them. By far one of the greatest 90s movies!
Is it only me or everyone else was crying too when they told: "I do"?
That was perfect for a mini zoom movie. They definitely need to make a full length movie.
Wasn’t long enough. I need a full feature film with the entire cast
Love this
It never fails....every time I'm at the grocery store and buy hot dogs...I will think of George Banks haha
PLEASE do a full movie!!!
That was amazing and sweet!! I would totally go to the theaters for a full feature of that cast!!
I forgot how much I missed Steve Martin in these types of roles. Martin Short fell back naturally into Franck as well. With the inclusion of Robert De Niro, I almost got a Meet the Parents vibe. The whole thing was very sweet and the new cast fit perfectly in the mold. Alan Silvestri's theme remains a treasure. Thanks for this, Netflix.
Loved father of the bride as a kid and still love to rewatch it today
In 20 mins you successfully managed to draw a few cheeky tears, just like in the movies.
Florence Pugh's American accent is tripping me out!
This couldn't get more better😍😍. Well done you guys. you all did a great job!!!💯💯
Absolutely loved it!!! So creative for 2020, thank you Nancy Meyers!
Could have done without the Reese Witherspoon introduction 🤦‍♀️like why???
I watched the 1st and second movie with my dad when they came out. My dad passed away I really wish he could have watched this with me. If I made spelling errors it's not because I am crying I just have dirt in my eyes. Forever and always daddy's little girl. Thank you for making this ❤
But tell me ...Why did I cry?
D-. Surprised with such good writing from the past two FOTB's that the writing of this was so weak. With such strong talent, (although, when filthy rich, communist lover, Robert Deniro entered, I almost turned off) this was all they came up with.
No captions? Come on, Netflix!
CAN WE GET A REAL SEQUEL THAT IS NOT ALL OF THEM READING A SCRIPT OFF A SCREEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I NEED THIS!!!
That was amazing!
I actually lost it when Matty proposed !! 😭😭😭
Love the fact that George is stoked about a wedding he doesn't have to pay for 😂
pedos
Beautiful. Thank you to the cast for bringing just a little bit of cheer during these crazy times..  P.S. Please Vote!
Where is the SUBTITLES??? I was so excited to watch it until there was no subtitles provided for deaf and hard of hearing users. Unacceptable!
Why am i crying so much😭😭
Shouldn’t Fronk be in his home country of Austria because of covid? The Italy 🇮🇹 Tuscany background looked so fake. And was Ben really playing the 🎹?
Me & my mother loved these movies. She would've loved to see this. Thank you Nancy Meyers.
This made me so happy 😭 😊 ☺ 💗
This was lovely! Thank you.
This was so cute! 💕💕💕💕
Steve Martin and Diane Keaton still got the chemistry. Shame they cannot be in the same room. Now as I get older I do sympathise with some of his anxiety and cheapskate traits but not overly- using ✏️ to take off 😷 = 😂  & his reaction to the wedding news was priceless.
Améeeeeeee❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wtf did Martin short do to his face
Love it
this was something i didn’t know i needed! thank you for putting such a smile on face. please continue with the plot & make another movie!!
Let’s donate!! 😀😷
who knows the ben platt baby will turn out to be THEEE BEN PLATT
I smiled through the whole thing. This was brilliant!!
Brilliant beyond brilliant - I see you Nancy Meyers
What happened to the rumors of filming Part III in Clemson, SC?!
Thank you!  Best thing in 2020!
Awesome! Please make part 3 full length movie ASAP!! In this time, we need it more then ever and it would be a HUGE hit. Cast is amazing!!
Awesome can’t believe I was excited, I laughed and cried all within 26 minutes. Just awesome 👏🏽
My goodness, I can’t believe I am tearie watching this!
I can finally enjoy life thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Dear Netflix,  we need father of the bride 3 asap in full length!!!
This was amazing!!!! Thank you Netflix!  Thank you YouTube!
I need this movie pleaseee😭😭❤️
Netflix wtf i tried to start a subscription but it wont let me  Idont care about this btw
Love it!!!
Look, this was awkward; in every sense.
OK IM JUST HERE TO SAY THERE SHOULD BE A 3RD SEASON OF INSATIABLE AND ALTHOUGH SHE BECOMES A KILLER, AND IT HAS PEOPLE BULLYING HER BECAUSE OF HER WEIGHT, SHE FIGHTS THROUGH IT, SHE EVEN INSPIRES A PERSON TO NOT GIVE UP. SO STOP BULLY JUST CUZ BULLY. I LOVE THE SHOW, I FEEL LIKE SHE HAS DEXTERS GENES IN HER DNA!!!
Couldn’t wait to watch this as father of the bride was my favourite childhood movie and I gotta say this made me feel exactly same way while watching. Made me laugh and cry. loved it ❤️. We need a another full length film
Cute! Please Nancy Myers, please make another movie!!! And don’t try to get all woke on it either. Just keep it classy, simple and feel good with good humor! A classic Nancy Meyers film, please!
No BD Wong???
OMG! Okay.. So I sat watching the entire thing with a goofy smile on my  face. I admit it!!!  Now I have to go back and watch the original  movie for the zillionth time!!!
awesome  loved the Banks family and the Father of the Bride movies!!!! Thanks for putting this together for us  this time we are going through is challenging and we need the smiles and laughter and tears  to help us keep going !
This was Beautiful - I Hope Netflix Does This With Home Alone For the Christmas Season.
AWESOME!!!!!’😂👍👏👏👏
Wow. Makes me want to see the first two (?) films. Where have you been, Steve Martin, you dirty rotten scoundrel!?
Omg I love this movie
This two movies happened exactly the same years I grew up and got married , my little brother was just like Matty and now he is a doctor !!! Omg can’t stop crying and I know it’s going to bring so many memories to my parents !!!! Amazing !!
This is probably the best thing to come out of 2020! I’ve been wanting a sequel FOREVER! They could do multiples: Part 3: Matty’s Reception, Part 4: Matty and Rachael having a baby, ending with Meghan getting engaged, which leads to Part 5: Meghan’s wedding! And it could just go on forever with kids and weddings! Seriously, this cast is so good together. And we could all use a lot more Franck in our lives!
I love part 1and 2 . I have it on iTunes .  Watch it all the time .   I heard  They were debating to making this  . I was hoping they would make a part 3 or 3 ish . Yay!!! Congrats 🎈   The cast and crew are so amazing
😭😭😭💕💕💕💕👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🙌🏽
Whoever thought of this...thanks you. It was so sweet and funny, it also made me cry lol. I loved these growing up and it was so great to see everyone again and bravo for the casting of all the new members, especially Ben Platt! This made my day❤️❤️
My favorite movie this had me 😆😆😆😆😆😆2020 I'm waiting asap this is funny 2008 2010 2011 my kids never seen it I'm ready pls bring it man they young Still
I would have enjoyed that more without all of the pandering and propoganda. I guess I should have expected it.
I'm sitting here sobbing. From the opening music my heart just leapt ❤❤ Thank you Banks family. Thank you Netflix and everyone involved
Love love love 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Thanks for doing this everyone!   We all needed this right now and it was great to see you all again!!!
Hey, forced diversity! Bad writing! Worse acting! Rich Californians talking about how they're making it through somehow as they stream from their mcmansions! Even the diversity hire got put up in a luxury hotel room. A bit tone deaf, eh?  Shame. I'd watch this format if it was actually well-written and heartwarming instead of just lousy :/
Tell me I wasn't the only one that cried.
Omg this was still the tear jerker and cute little movie like the other movies love it. Now I was more...
ugh my childhood ❤️❤️
BEST MOMENT OF 2020 💕
Ben Platt singing?  Wow! Enjoyed it all!  So charming!
Gah! no closed captioning... so freaking sad. :(
I CRIED I LAUGHED AND GOT FILLED WITH EMOTIONSS🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩👏👏👏👏👏 THE PERFORMANCES WERE BEAUTIFUL AND WITH THE BEST TALENTED ARTISTS OF ALL TIMES 🤩THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL AND NETFLIX THE BEST NICE SURPRISE IN 2020🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
FLORENCE PUGH WILL BE REMEMBERED AS THE GREATEST ACTRESS OF THIS GENERATION... YOU HEARD IT HERE 1ST
how is it that I can't find this on netflix but easily find it on youtube?
Lovely. Great music. Super editing. Congrats folks.
The whole thing was perfect we needed this badly but its a great idea for people wanting to get married this year
This was so beautiful. It brought tears to my friends eyes! I loved every minute
My heart is so full after watching this!
Omg I absolutely loved it, this brought back so many memories, I cried, I laughed it was amazing! I only wish they’d do a full length movie with everyone this was just too short ❤️👍👍👍👍 wonderful thank you!
Love it!! Thank you.
I always cry at a wedding....
I can not fine it
I'm getting married in 15 days and we watched this movie all the time when I was a kid. Thank you so much for this.
Crying! This was perfection!
Thank you for this and I'm hoping we can have a full-length Part 3!!!!!!! :)
Still have Chemistry!!! Wonderful! wanted more!!!
WE NEED A FULL ON PART 3 MOVIE PLEASE😭🙏🏾
Love it. Now when corona is over give us the 3rd movie.
Damn you Steve Martin for that monolog about your little boy growing up to be a man! I can't see the screen now.
Yes please make a new movie of this Netflix 😀🥰
This was just JOYOUS!!! Wish there had been more, but I thoroughly enjoyed all 25 minutes of it (including the closing credits)!!!
Absolutely loved this! Took me right back to the 90’s and brought back wonderful memories. Kudos to all involved in putting this together!
Love it, part 1 and 2 I cried and now guess what cried again, thank you to all the crew members from the production for this gift to all the forever fans of Father of the bride take care everyone!!! Many blessings
I love this!! I need the hole film please!

youngest one here hhahahaha
Wow!!! Thank you!!! From all of us who had COVID Weddings!!!! Thank you!!! Thank you also to this great organization for ally you have done and to all these wonderful actors for their support. The Father of the Bride set was the first thing I bought when my husband proposed and we found out how our wedding would be COVIDized! (We had planned on getting married later, but my husband’s job needed us married this year so I could travel with him.) I have seen the Spencer Tracy Father of the Bride movies, but love this one the best!! Thank you all again for bringing us another Banks Family Wedding with all our favorites and such special surprises!!! Thank you!! ❤️
Bring on Number 3!!!
Netflix please make a full length part 3 movie!!!! Please 🙏 we need it
Ive always loved Steve Martin and 80s/ 90s movies.  Something special about them that let's you rewatch
I was obsessed with these movies when I was growing up. This was the best! I'm so glad Matty got featured this time!
What a great movie for an amazing cause! Loved the surprise guest “FOTB”!! Well done!👏🏼👏🏼
Loved this!!!!! Now we need a full length film for Megan's wedding!!!  Dream senario ... it begins at the post pandemic reception of Mattie and Rachel, Megan meets Mr or Ms right, and away.. we.. Go!
Thank you for this! It does feel like a sequel to an actual full length feature film. Please, make it so! 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼
Absolutely loved this, it was exactly what I needed!! Franck Eggelhoffer officiating a Zoom wedding, omg, so perfect!
THIS WAS A DISSAPOIMENT I WAS EXPECTING TO SEE A NEW MOVIE NOT A REUNION BIT.
Thank you!  Loved it and great to see the original and new cast members!
I loved it!! We needed this, gave me a smile the whole time...😍. Needs a full length 🎥 🤞
Loveeeeeeeeeeeeeee
They did it again! I actually cried. Thank you all for doing this and like everyone else, I plead you all to make a full length part 3!
Love love love! 💕
This was a lovely bit of nostalgia.  I think this special event proves without a doubt this should be made into a feature-length film.  I hope this was a really cool public pitch meeting.  Father of the Groom: Coming December 2022?
Let's petition this to be part (3-ish) hell yessss Father of the Groom whose here for it !!!!
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️💯
I did not enjoy this.  Came off as very cringy and on the nose with a lot of narrative peddling.
Let me tell you, Nancy Myers and crew this really made my day. I went from crying to laughing to smiling like an idiot back to crying again. The Father of the Bride movies have a special place in my heart and memories of my dad and I watching them together. He's no longer here, but this is such a sweet memory I hold dear. THANK YOU TO THE ENTIRE CAST💕 your love for each other truly shines.
This is just amazing memories of one of my all time favorite movies! Father of the Bride lover forever thank you so much for doing this!!! I love you all!!
Aw it’s so baaaaad!!!! I still love them though!
Florence Pugh could punch me in the face and I'd thank her
Aww, I loved 1 and 2. And appreciate 3ish. It was awesome seeing them all. It really felt like a day in the life of the Banks family. Thank you so much for taking the time to get together and doing this. Your fans are cheering you on. Make another full length movie 🎥. Franc completed the skit. And here's welcoming the new comers. Thank you all.
That’s cool but please delete cuties
Love this!!
Please We need the movie part 3, this was so awesome 👏🏻 everything was so perfect 👌🏻. Please do part 3 , I assure will be a blockbuster 🙌🏻
I loved the first movie when it came out. I loved the second one even more. And this truly made me happy. Can they just keep having zoom meetings as continuations?
Love.  Thank you so much for this!!
bro, these movies are in my top 10 fave movies of all time! I need a part 3 full length feature please🥺
loved it
Please we need another movie !!!!
This was good wow cast still has it would love to see official part 3
I'M NOT CRYING, YOU ARE!
There NEEDS to be a full length part 3!! I enjoyed this soooooo much brought tears to my eyes with the memories 🥰
This made my heart happy and the tears flowing!  Loved seeing them again and the new cast...makes me want a #3 full feature!  Great job!  A Banks wedding in 2020 is EXACTLY what we needed!
Watch this and feel nothing. I dare you.
Can you please now mkae us a full feature length version of the movie. It's been my favorite since I was a kid.
Loved it! The only thing missing for me was Howard Weinstein. Also with all the Father of the Bride callbacks I was expecting James to say when Franck first showed up, "This guy is supposed to officiate a wedding, how with subtitles?"
Can we please get a full length film
Aww❤️❤️❤️❤️
I cried 😭 I love those movies 😭😭❤️
I always hoped that part 3 would be a double wedding of Megan and George. Steve Martin in the Father of the Bride role again, but adding the stress of 2 weddings at the same time kind of thing.
Amazing... I feel sooo happy it brings back so many memories.. Still one of my favorite movies.. ❤️❤️❤️
And I'm in tears lol MAKE THIS MOVIE HAPPEN FULL LENGTH!!!!! ❤
Died at Florence Pugh’s parent trap reference.
Loving this Soo much. Kept all.of.the characters just like they were. I love how George is so worried he supplies everyone with mask.even the hospital.
They made a movie on youtube? 😵
This was wonderful ❤️
Love Father of the Brides, we have and still watch these movies on VHS. But this video conference version is absolutely terrible. Why? Why do this? They would have be better of doing nothing at all.
This makes me cry so many happy tears!!!! FAVORITE movie EVER!!!! 💕💕
This is so perfect! I want a full-length sequel.
This was so sweet.  I loved it.
Is this the full length? The article said an hour long, but it only says 26 minutes here??
Such bad acting
I hope they continue this movie after the pandemic, with this cast. Originals and newest cast. Please netflix make it happen.
Amazing. thank you. WC Kitchen is so deserving too!!
Wow I can watch this over and over again.. It brought back the same feelings from back then.. great job everyone
Nina gets a compliment, George says '😳 '
Awesome!!!!! This was so great to watch.
LOVED THIS!!!!!
Please make a part 3, Official Movie!
I loved these movies so much growing up! This is hands down the best thing to happen in 2020. Make the 3rd film!
Dear Netflix I’m going to need you to make this movie happen,with everyone on this screen
Now all we need is a Three Amigos 2 ;)
Omg!!! Thank you for this.  One of my favorite movies of all time.  Please come out with a full length movie....
So sweet! Very happy to go and donate! Thank you WCK and Father of the Bride cast. Love you all!!!
I’m sorry, but whenever I see Matty I can only think of Wallace from Scott Pilgrim.
This was amazing!!!! Seriously!!!! If we don’t get a full length after this... I’m going to be so upset!!
There needs to be a part three!!
Yay Robbie Deniro!!
Oh my god this was the best ever I love these movies so much I need a part 3 badly with all of them
This was really good. Wow loved it
Gosh....that soundtrack! Yanks me back right away!❤️
Im a big fan of the first two they need to make a Full length movie.
I’m in sweats for Mattys Wedding 😆😆😆
This was awesome. Thanks to everyone that made this possible. Now let’s have a real movie
Oh this was so good, we need another full movie!
Loved this!!! Donate everyone it was for such a good cause. We need a 3rd movie - 90s movies were so much better we all need a little of this feeling after watching that! Pleaaaaaasse make a 3rd ❤️
We sure needed this tonight. Thank you!
Netflix Father Of the Bride 3 (ish) series. I'd watch it. I've watched the movies like 30 times each.
OKAY. NOW GIVE US A MOVIE !
Thank you for this beautiful light of hope for better days!❤️
30 seconds in and this is stupid...
Still pulled at my heart strings as the original💞 Listening to the soundtrack had me in tears😢 Steve narrating also had me in tears 😭 My kids are grown, 2 out of 5 have moved away, I'm a grandmother now, the years have gone by so fast, seeing clips of the original took me back to the early years! Enjoy every minute you have with your family. 💝
Bravo FOB part 3ish for making me laugh, cry & donate!! Woohoo well done! We just celebrated our 25th anniversary so great blast from the past and now present!!
*ugly crying* I needed this. So warm and fuzzy! 🥰😭
Please make a real Part 3 movie Netflix! ❤
I missed it!! watching it now
Give me a real part three  !
Omg, this is so beyond amazing!!
It was amazing! Great performance and brilliant choice of actors! Incredible! Must watch!
I can't see anyone else but Roman Roy now gah...
WE NEED, NEEED A 3RD MOVIE.
DeNiro and Martín together was what all need!
That was Soooo Nice... Please Netflix, we need a Movie
17:00 predictable yet totally still funny and rewatchable.
So beautiful and so touching, just what we need in these times ❤️👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I love this!!! I always hope for a part 3 movie. I’m so glad they decided to do this! Hopeful for a full length movie in the soon future
So sweet. This short film makes 2020 a little brighter. Thank you. The cast looks great
This is so cheesy but I love it
Now we need the actual Father of the bride part 3!!! Come on netflix! make it happen!
the fact that they included Ben Platt in this made it 10x better than before and it was absolutely amazing before. that is just an added bonus 💓
Brilliant 👏🏻
Awe, loved this movie as a kid! This was great! Also reminded me of my best friend's wedding, she got engaged and taken to her wedding, i had to get her a dress the day before...and filmed the whole thing. It's on my YouTube channel if you wanna see me almost mess the surprise up, and lots of happy tears!!!
🤦‍♂️ super corny 🤮
I can see a lot of new shows being done in this format! Fabulous 👏👏👏
Need captions
They should make it into a movie
❤️👏🏾❤️👏🏾❤️👏🏾❤️👏🏾❤️👏🏾❤️👏🏾❤️👏🏾❤️
2020: sucks  The Banks family: not on our watch
i really love this movie can someone please suggest movies like this
It would have been perfect if B.D. Wong were a part of this.
This was SPECATULARRRR!!!! Part 3 movie NEEDS to happen!!! Loved this so so much!! ❤️👰🏼🤵🏽👟
please make a full length version!! I loved this and those original clips still made my cry!  Love the Banks family!
So great. So so great.
LOVED the original 2, and love this 3(ish) version also. Wish i can like this more than once, so I compensate by liking many of you who says this needs to happen irl. 😁 oh! This is just SO BEAUTIFUL!! thanks reeae, netflix × youtube for making this happen.
Great movie clip... secretly hoping they come out with a movie soon!!!!  Please bring a full length movie in 2021.
Alright, I don't know if it's because of how much love I have for this incredibly special cast, or if it's that sweet jovial themed music that's always bouncing in the background or if it's just the entire sentiment of it all - but I straight up balled like a baby the same way I did throughout the two previous Father of The Brides.  Most of all, I think this just made me miss my Dad so much. It's been fifteen years since he passed away, and although I miss him every day, sometimes it's the sweetly emotional things like this that come my way that just really end up tugging on my heart strings.  ALSO - Who else LOST it when Frank's voice popped in?  I swear, these Father of The Bride movies will always have such a special place in my heart.
Wow, that was awesome!  I really needed that!  There needs to be a real part 3. I absolutely love this cast.
I can't stop crying. I never knew how much FOTB fans needed this!
The cheesiness is reeeeeeaaaaallll hahaha so cute tho
Steve Martin and Kimberly Williams have NOT AGED AT ALL!!!
I almost cried but I don't want to be mooshy on a gloomy day. I LOVE IT! Enjoyed every moment and scene of their movie back when I was a kid. So happy I am surviving this pandemic and get to see the original cast healthy and strong as well.  THANKS GUYS....  Stay Safe God Bless
That was wonderful!
These are my absolute favorite films of all time. They are perfect comfort films. Warm,lovely and emotional. Great cast and score. I adore it
Well I cried.  I'd love to see a movie post pandemic. The family reunion.
Hate Florence Pugh , otherwise everything else is perfect , heart emoji
Oh darn..this one's making me cry too!!😘
So... We need a legit movie in 2021!!! I'm holding them to their word on that "hug"
Por favor, alguien que sepa español, que quiere decir esto? Quiero decir, que si es para donar, pero el que? Alguien me puede explicar por favor. Gracias.
This made 2020 so much better. I just cried so much. I loved this. Those movies have stuck with over the years and I always wanted a family like that. Thank you so much for giving this precious gift to the world 🧡
So good. I love this family!
My fave franchise, saving 2020. This needs to be a thing.
I don't know what these movies are but now I want to watch it.
This was and is so needed... Thank You...
Couldn't love this more. I laughed, I cried, best best thing!
I loved this! And you made me cry again.
I NEED a full third movie 😭
Come on Netflix, you know you want to make a full length movie of this. Let’s make it happen and finally have something good come out of 2020.
Such a beautiful  wedding, so romantic!❤️
Robert De niro?!!
Appreciate the diversity, we are growing up!
This gave me all the feels😩😭 Thank you for doing this beautiful reunion. I love both “Father of the Bride” movies and this right here, made me smile and laugh❤️ It would be so great to actually get a part 3 movie👏🏼
George still petty as ever n I love it 😍🤣
Brings me back! I don’t understand something though...why is this made by Netflix but the movies are not on Netflix???
This was beautiful 🙂
loved this so much. thank you
I cried the entire time. This was wonderful!
So well-written and perfect!
26 minutes of pure joy!
That was delightful.  Totally brought a smile to my face.   Great to see the Banks family again.
This was great!, (but now I REALLY need to see Kieran's beard!!!)
I love Father of the Bride so I'm excited about this!
We want a 3rd movie!!   My family and I love this movie!  Its our family movie time together I’m so happy they got back together for this little mini reunion 😊😊
We really need a part 3 & 4!
Dear Hollywood Please give us the sequel we want, NOT the intended reboot with a different cast.  This works, don't ruin it. Kind regards The FotB fans.
It Was a good attempt but it was lacking the genuine spark and warmth of an old fashioned 👰 🤵 Where is BD Wong?
Awwww. So cute. I was smiling and shedding tears at the same time  while watching it. There should be a full-length Father of the Bride Part 3!
Diane keaton is still Beautiful as ever she never ages. ❤
This is so well done! I've watched a couple of these Zoom shows and this one is leagues above the rest.
This is my FAVORITE movie!! I own part 1 & 2 and watch them both at least twice a year! It’s just a feel good kinda movie❤️ Would love it if they made a part 3.. Maybe Grandpa of the Bride🤷🏻‍♀️😂
Was hoping this would be a full movie as I enjoyed this....but I want more now 😊
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
219 people did thumbs down.  What is wrong with you people? Everything ok at home? This is soooo cute and thoughtful <3
I look remember this
This is so amazing
This was the cutest thing! We def want to see more!
I love this! I wish this was a 2hr long movie!!!
And I’m crying.
I’m not crying your crying!
Love this mini movie.    I definitely want more.      Thanks so much for this
LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!
Awwww. This is beyond amazing. I love this and why am I crying???? Lol
You cast Ben Platt, you have him sing, that's just how it goes
I Loved this so much! Like I need a full length movie now.
Beautiful. Loved this!
This absolutely made my day!  For 20 whole minutes I didn’t think about how dire the political situation is, or RBG, or any of it.  The only thing that could’ve made it better is if they’d gotten B.D. Wong to show up, too. I’m with everyone else on this...WE NEED A FULL LENGTH ‘FATHER OF THE BRIDE 3’ !!!  This is a no-brainer, Netflix!  Get on it!  Donating to WCK, now. 🥰
Netflix, I will give you this one. Most of the time, I am let down by you. Most of your content, I hate. However, this is WONDERFUL. The new casting, writing, and acting is seamless and aligns beautifully with the other 2 films. This is 20-some minutes of HAPPINESS. A BIG THANK YOU to all of the people who made this happen. It's been one of the best things to happen this year. 🎉😂🎉
This was perfect and exactly what I needed. I laughed and cried it was like a hug from an old friend.
What a wonderful surprise!  Thank you so much!
What a wonderful surprise!  Thank you so much!
Bravo!!! Well done. Thanks and much love. ♥️
Oh. My. Goodness!!!! Yes bring them all back! What an especially wonderfully happy blessing in 2020
Love you guys! ❤️
Oh my, so delightful!!! And all the FEELS!!!!
Steve Martin hasn't aged a day.
Omg I would love love love a full feature, can't count how many times I have watched the other two.
I loved these movies. This brings back so many memories. This is such a cute mini movie.
THAT WAS PERFECT!!
Feels like a Star Wars Special
i need this as a feature film ASAP. i want to know the backstory between george and james😂😂
Silly but the wife and I definitely needed this!!
I love Nancy’s nod to the Parent Trap with the “brilliant beyond brilliant idea.”
Loved it until I saw De Niro. What a stain.
I love 1 and 2 but 3 is ridiculous so impersonal and do you have to have c19 in everything...really.
How sweet this was:) even brought tears to my eyes! Bravo Netflix great job on this one:))
Awwww This is amazing ❤️
Was over the moon when I heard about this, please do a full part 3
I was a little girl when Father Of The Bride came out, I must have watched it a few dozen times before having to return it to Blockbuster. The movie was everything I imagined for my wedding. Parents who were the perfect role models of marriage, a family full of love and happiness, a fiancé who was absolute perfect and exhilarating and to top it off, the perfect wedding day a girl could ever dream of. July 10th, 2020 was suppose to be my perfect wedding day. I was suppose to walk down the isle, in the most magnificent dress, passing by all of our loved ones, leaving the most wonderful parents a person could have to the most wonderful partner anyone could ask for... 2020 hit us all hard in many ways, and instead of watching the first Father Of The Bride the night before my wedding with my parents, I’m watching Father Of The Bride 3(ish) online, alone, in my bed. Although this “movie” was a bit of a teaser all my emotions came rushing in. I’m lucky to have my amazing fiancé, family and friends (and our puppy Rocky) who are all healthy and happy. And this little teaser was a simple reminder that my day will come, whether it be this year or next...or the one after that. So I thank the cast of Father Of The Bride 3(ish) for filling my heart with joy while watching their movie. It’s everything a little/big girl who has big dreams could ask for.
PERFECTION
Need a full length feature film!!!!!! Love love love
Amo estas peliculas. Me emocionan cada vez que las veo.  Gracias por volver.  Besos desde Buenos Aires
This is AMAZING! Ugh I need Ben Platt to sing that at my wedding 💗 Brings me right back to the 90s - ALL the tears😭
Lol how many is wAtching it again
Oh, God, did this lift my spirits or what?? It was wonderful seeing them together again. The chemistry is there, the feels, the laughs... Thank you.
PLEASE make a full length movie. We all need it!!!!!
I am all smiles 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
Just what I needed !!!
It could've been called Father of the Groom since it's about Matty's wedding but if they ever decide to make another it can still be Father of the Bride and have it be about Megan's wedding. It could come as a Netflix original film, I'd be down with that 💯
@beyondthetrailer it was less than 30min and just zoom. All the strikes in your book :(
Omg!!! I love this sooooo much. I cried, laugh so much. Pleaseeee do a feature film. The part 3ish is not enough. Thanks for the memories everyone.
Omg I cried laughed as I did for the other 3 !! Bring it to the screen
A classic 💜💜💜 This movie made me "a young person" love Frank Sinatra.
I love it!!
GEEZE Steve is old now 😢
We need a movie
This was great but the thing that would’ve made it slightly better is if B.D. Wong was in it too
I loved every minute of this mini movie! I can’t wait until we’re all able to see a full length movie version of “Father Of The Bride   3” soon!
Ang Saya NAMAN 😊🥳🥰

Just what people need at this time
I love it so much!!  😭😭😭

❤❤❤ love this so much, always loved these movies
This was wonderful!
OMG. I loved this SO much!!!!
I have always loved this family. Steve Martin is one of my celebrity crushes and favorite actors.
Umm I love this lol ❤
Lots of fun. Great surprise to have DeNiro show up. Good pandemic beard. And Diane looks as great as ever.  Nice job, Nancy!
I love this😍
I love this!! We absolutely need a full length movie!!
You need captions Pronto!
How do they pull off ADR "live"? LOL
I was so happy to see this! Thank you!!
Oh my goodness, I couldn't help but cry! This is so heartwarming and just so perfect. Brought back all the feels. Donating.
I can’t wait for the  part #3 ,  Father of the Bride is one of my favorites movies and I can watch it and watch it and the jokes never get old. To the cast please hurry with the movie ❤️
This made me happy and cry at the same time. I think we need the 90’s style movies in 2021 just to help us emotionally from this pandemic. Thank you Nancy!
Bravo! This was so good.  Parts 1 and 2 were really great movies and brings back some great memories.
What is this...?
I wish we had seen BD Wong (Howard), but other than that it was great.
We're all constantly searching for Clorox wipes 🤣👏👏
They killed this!!! I love itttt👏🏽👏🏽 made my day
This literally brought tears to my eyes! Thank you all for reuniting, this was perfection!
I love this like I’m teary!!! I have so many memories !!!
❤️
Oh my gawd my heart right now💛💛💛
Wish they would make a real sequel to it. I definitely would go watch it
Cute
So needed and lovely during this crazy time! ❤
this is amazing hahahha
Thank you, Nancy Meyers and Netflix for lifting my spirits. Can we get a full length feature when this shitshow of a year is over, please?!!!!!
A bit disappointed that they changed the storyline from Matt getting married to his boyfriend.  I know that wasn't an official storyline, but I kinda liked that. Above all, it was fun to see these actors portraying their characters after 25 years.  It makes wish they can do a full length of part 3.
I hope this means we’ll get an actual 3rd movie in 2021! Job well done guys. Was a fun half hour
Beautiful! How it made me smile.... loved the movies...they still have the chemistry!
So good! I seriously starting crying as soon as I heard the music. LOVE THIS SO MUCH!
I'm 2:32 minutes in and I'm 😁 and 😭 this. Classics never die 🍿🥤. I couldn't stop crying through this whole video. Can we say that guy sang his butt off. Everyone still has that tight bond it beamed through like a 🌈 after the rain.
okay i need 2 more hours of this
this is awesome! and so well done😍 we need a part three!❤️
I need a Father of the Bride 3 with Florence Pugh
*WHERE ARE THE SUBTITLES???*  Deaf people liked Father of the Bride too... ☹️
Loved it. Cried, like I did with every other of these movies. Thank you
a very sad for netflix of brazil not translaxion or legende for portuguese-BR
This is canon to the Father of the Bride series, in my book. Hope it's expanded on.
OMG! I loved this.  It was so beautifully done. Now I want to watch the first 2 movies again.
29 years since the original and Steve Martin looks exactly the same.
This is the best thing to come from 2020 by far. All the feels. It was great to see this story agian and to hear from these characters. Thank you.
I loved every bit of it please feel free to make a part three🥰🥰💘
I didn’t expect to cry from watching a zoom reunion but I did! Very well done. Hoping for a full length part 3! Thank you so much for this ❤️
This was awesome ❤❤❤❤
😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢 I'm sobbing!!!
It was so good - now we need the new full length movie!
I haven’t been able to see it.  I went on Netflix and it’s. Not there
BEN PLATTTTTTTTT
Love this. loved these movies
Wasn’t sure what to expect but this was just wonderful!
It was wonderful! Thank you!!
This was really the sweetest thing I have seen in a long time. It was so good 😊
What a great cast. A reunion I did not know I needed. Thank you!
Ben Platt singing “The way you look tonight” 😍
I'm crying over a Zoom call. Someone help me. I need a full length version of this please please please.
The fact that Ben Platt is in this 🥺❤️🥺
I smiled so big. Laughed & cried. So incredibly beautiful. I’ve been a huge fan of these films my whole life. Yes I’d love a 3rd movie but this was more than enough to remind me of beautiful memories & a hopeful future. Thank you to the cast & to Netflix. Let’s donate.
Seeing Roman Roy here is soooooo weird!
This was awesome, we need a full part 3 please!! ❤️
Me and my wife are crying for joy over this.  We  want a full length movie out of this PLEASE!!!
That was really good and so well done... Great idea and great job to all involved in this project! For a great cause as well... Awesome!!! :)
This was extremely well done. I greatly enjoyed seeing the familiar faces and meeting the new. I’m ready for Father of the Bride III.  Extremely worthy cause. Thank you for inviting us to this event and offering us an opportunity to help others.
Meh
Thank you for this! I really hope Netflix considers making an actual movie.... *fingers crossed*
Is this an actual movie or is it a wind up 😂
So much propaganda and programming it was hard to watch.
Congratulations and thank you!  Love from Telopea, Sydney, Australia.
¡¡Lo mejor del 2020!!
But now I need an actual part three ... full feature length!
Need full part 3 please
Just perfect!!!! Please bring a full 3 out soon!!
So weird watching it this way.
He’s never aged
Just logged on. Will it be shown again?
This was wonderful! Thanks so much for doing this!
Ben 😭
I missed the stream but this is a cool idea. Some of these streams should be done in the AM so all the weirdos like me can congregate.
They need to make a proper movie when they can so they can have the big wedding 🥰
Loved it! Hopefully they'll make a full length movie soon!
Thank you!!! When I found out ( through the Barefoot Contessa) I couldn’t believe it! My whole family needed this feel good snip-it! Thank you, thank you!!!! Wish they made movies like this more often! I cried and laughed vi Zoom with my sister! Did dad freeze? Lol!!!
My favorite movie franchise of all time ❤ ❤ ❤
OMG, why all the CV crap. I'd like to NOT hear about it for a while.
Bob De Niro????? Haaaaaaa!!! Did not see coming, THIS IS A STROKE OF GENIUS!
No caption?? Really??? Middle finger to you.
Lame.
Father of the Groom, let's do it people!!!
This had me feeling all the feels again! Everyone was just so wonderful. Donating now!
So cute 🥰
This was so good!
Now this is a movie Netflix should actually make
This might finally be the turning point for 2020. Everything has to be better after this.
I laughed and cried 💛💛💛💛💛 Love Kieran Culkin!!!!
Wonderful gift and such a treat. Thank-you
Everyone was good but Ben Platt looks too old
This is so cute 😭😭😭😭
OMG!! THANK YOU ALL SO DAMN MUCH!!! 👏🏻🥰
That was very sweet, thank you!
I’d like to start a petition for a full 3rd-ish movie!!!
This is so cute! Thanks for sending us comfort when we needed it the most! ❤
I full on cried watching this! I love the first movies❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fantastic!!! During this critical time we needed this. Congrats to all that did this sweet film. Oscars to all of you!!
I didn't know I needed this till just now
Love this....this brought joy to watch. ❤ Loved the messages of love and being there for one another and to stay safe in these crazy times. What made me cry was how parents look at their adult children and always see them young. That's exactly how I feel watching all my children become adults and starting their lives....thank you for this, it was much needed. ❤❤❤❤❤
No. I'm not crying!! Jeez this is amazing! Im sending this to my Mom!!!
What an awesome idea to help those who are in need!  Thankful for all involved and especially for the cast of Father of the Bride.  Have laughed and cried in each movie and during this one too!   Loved it!
Kiekan Culkin (Matty) is married to Jazz Charton in real life  (this was scriptrd for charity) Sorry to pop the balloon for those thinking it a real wedding, but this was cute anyway!
one of my favorite cast in one spot with extras this was great !
I love this so much! ❤❤❤
This has made me so happy!
Well this will be replayed often.
ooOOOOOOOOOOOYEAAASOHHHYess! Nice.
They need to do a whole movie loved part 2 more than part 1
Why does it keep saying almost ready?))
Shat
Loved it! This was soo much fun to watch!
Loved this❤
Absolutely love this!!! Father of the Bride 1 and 2 are amazing and this does not disappoint one bit! Thank you all so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️ much needed during these times.
I love this, and I hope to see more of the Banks family.
This was just perfect 😭🥰
I hope they rebroadcast.  I haven’t been able to log in to watch!
Get out of town'!
I didn't realise how much I needed this. Father of the Bride Part 3 needs to happen ASAP. It'll be the party to celebrate the joyous occasion and Meghan is going to have her own baby.. There's the plot Netflix and I'll take only 20% of the profits.
Light-heated and fun.  This brought smiles at a crazy time in our history.  Good job!  Look forward to a full-length movie in 2021!
Please, please, please, PLEASE make a new Father of the Bride, oh please oh please oh please ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Steve Martin is a genius. I admire him and all cast members immensely. Read some of his words from Father of the Bride at my own daughter's wedding. Thank you all!
Bravo Cast, Reese Witherspoon, Netflix. And all of the others who donated their time and skills to this project!  What an amazing gift to us all💗
LOL! I loved it! I wonder if a wedding on zoom is legally binding. 😂 It was really funny.
Wow I completely wasn't expecting that, but now I've seen it I simply couldn't imagine a reunion in any other way, it was amazing - loved every second of it, brought us so much joy - we've donated to the cause😊❤💒
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ohh! So beautiful! I almost cried!! I absolutely love the movies and now even more! Let’s donate people! It’s for a good cause!
So happy to see this! Now we need a big movie!
Amazing movies Trailer s,awesome
I want free neflix
This proves this movie still has fans. We need a part 3 feature length. They still have chemistry, I need a new one. Loved these as a kid
After Father of the Bride Part II I was hoping they'd make a third one called Father Of the Groom so we can see the young kid get married.
I loved this! ♥️
This is just what I needed 🤍
What a delightful surprise! This was a day brightener. 😊❤️
This was really cute!!! 🥰 Now I want a full movie
Love this! After this pandemic is over. I would love to see a full length movie. What a beautiful sequel!
Very sweet
Full length feature with this entire cast please! I adored this!!
I hope they do a  movie soon
This was such a great short part 3. So many new people. Well done. Loved it.
Oh my goodness 🥺
Ok the fact that matty  looks way younger than Annie’s kid is sad they should have picked someone else I’m sorry they didn’t need Ben Platt in this they could have gone with someone else also not a fan of the girl playing Nina and George’s daughter otherwise I loved this
Well done... I’m completely in my feelings... thank you!
Awwww too sweet! Thanks for this
That man Steve Martin does not age. 😂
It was good
PLEASE MAKE THIS FULL MOVIE!!!
Needed to see this ❤️
That was wonderful
Omg now I want a full length movie!! I have missed the Banks family so much!! ❤️❤️❤️
LOVE IT !!!!
Wtf is this? My son's zoom meetings with everyone yelling at the teacher are more interesting
Words cannot express the joy this brought me xo
This was so sweet!! Please make a full part 3 movie next year! Maybe you can make it about both grandkids having wedding the same year - sort of like part II being about 2 simultaneous pregnancies.
Martin Short looks like he did a complete overhaul of his face and hair. The man is 70.
Wow 🤩 that took me back to my childhood ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ absolutely loved the reunion!!
Why can you not watch it
guys, I've been waiting for this since I was a kid I played with dolls (made them out of plasticine) and came up with a script  I couldn't even imagine how it would be in 2020 💙
The Banks Family is exactly what I needed this year.
The best thing EVER!!!
Love It!!!
Are they going to show again?
I was expecting something else glad to see the cast together. But all us fans really want a. Real part 3 like the teaser sugjested.  Nice 2020 suprise, but most of us are wishing for more
This brought me a lot of joy. I will be showing my parents.
Still has me laughing after all these years, thank you for bringing back the best memories 😁👌🏾
I want the full movie!!
Enjoyed seeing the cast together again!!
I hope they make a movie out of this. Such a cuuuute movie
Father of the Bride 3 please
Have the people weren’t even in the original movies so it’s just weird seeing them 😂
Just what we needed this year 😭❤
Donated! What a great cause. I love they can have another FOTB wedding. What a great cast! They fit right back into the roles.
this is really what we needed? OF COURSE it is
So sweet!!! Ah the nostalgia 😊
so great
That was sweet. Make a movie
My body is ready. Father of the bride was a big part of my childhood. Watching it on VHS.
K, COVID MUST BE OVER BEFORE 2021
Made me laugh, made me cry... what a perfect little bit of happiness to watch amidst all this year has brought. So creative Nancy Meyers!! And the actors made something that I’m sure was difficult to make seem believable, not only that, but funny and heartwarming at the same time ❤️👰🏽😂
I literally cried
I had such hopes for this. Its. So. Bad.
Did they all have to consult with Dean Cundey?   Is that why the backgrounds have depth?
when will it be on again?
Why does the the bride's son look like he's in his late 30s? Ain't he supposed to be 25?
did I miss it? I'm watching a "almost ready" screen.
Congrats Matty! 🤪
why dont netflix put up their own money? whats was making this film really about hmmmm?
They all have the Nancy Meyers setting on their Zooms. Someone forward it to Rob Reiner and James L. Brooks.
Florence Pugh's American accent is spot on.  She reminds me of Kate Winslet.
It was a sweet reunion and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Thank you, Nancy Meyers et al!
Love this.  This makes me so happy
I love adult Megan. Florence was great! I would be really interested in a new full movie revolving around her wedding.
Would not work.  Why is this not on regular Netflix. Very disappointing after all the build up
This was so bad i have no words. The 1st movie inspired my personal wedding and i didn't expect such an awful 3rd part. The new actors were SO SO BAD. Why is the new bride socially distancing during her wedding? Why is her father white?? Why is everybody else alone? Why did they turned it a cam session?? Why talking about the pandemic?? Omgggg  WOW Netflix. Just Wow.
This makes me want a new full length movie with the whole gang!! 😍😁 Makes me feel so happy seeing them all together again.
I’d like to know if you are already working with some of the top Brokers in the market because I’ve a big and reliable affiliate network that can guarantee high CPA. If it sounds interesting to you, we can talk about it without any obligation. Thank you in advance!
Just great. They have to shove this "pandemic" nonsense everywhere.   They just ruined what could actually have been a continuation of a classic.
Thank you and I donated to WCK !
Please write Father of the bride 3.  Waiting for Coming to America 2 movie trailer.
**krusty the clown voice**  *_what the hell was that?_*
Awesome! So touching! Brilliant! Thanks so much.
Mr BONKS
This was lovely to watch and it made me so happy seeing all of them after all these years!  George reminds me so much of my dad especially the part about WhatsApp.
Thank you
Brilliantly done, well done to the cast & netflix. Thankyou for this from us all the fans. They all look so great still 👍🏽👏🏽
Thank you, that was great
Never mind 💀💀💀
Wait is this a full movie?
