I thought thé multiple player was free to play
I can’t find HC multiplayer
ugh jumping around corners. i wish they would penalize you people for doing that crap. it's so stupid.
Am i tripping.. or is there no hardcore multiplayer mode ..
Bro this is probably the worst cod I’ve ever played
Will there be a ranked Mode?
I prefer MW19 :( I have only played a few games so far, but the gameplay is really slow and clunky. Its much less realistic. The maps are boring and unrealistic compared to MW19. Spawn points are bad and get spawn killed. Voice acting sounds bad. The gameplay features and interface have a futuristic feel, similar to advanced warfare which I don't like. I even think the graphic and sounds were better on 19. I dunno I feel like MW19 was much more realistic
Fek, sburprised yah never trip up over the spped of your speech. Slooooooow down :(
Tier 1/ hardcore is not even in the game!!
its the weapon tuning for me 😮‍💨🔥
Where and how can i play tier 1 mode?
1 in the chamber and furniture hunt lol i want it
No Kill Confirmed?
Jesus Loves you all very much!!!! God Bless everyone!!!!
the last one stop working and became a sales game.
Wow.weak. he's wearing a hockey mask and a covid mask???
No prestige system 👎🏼 this game is going to be boring. Don’t buy this garbage
What’s up thanks for all the information it’s been awhile since I played but can’t wait to get back in it with this game
Blows my mind that people still care about Call of Duty. Get a hobby or a girlfriend guys.
R6 is the only shooter but gg
Bet you can’t wait to download 600 gb either
Where tf is Tier 1 mode?!
Those party city masks look so damn stupid...
Kinda bummed Nuke isn't a kill streak. Having a very high killstreak that wins the match was awesome back in the original and I spent many, many hours playing hoping to get one.
NO KILL CONFIRMED!
This game feels like battlefield while playing which is a let down
I am exited to be a proud rat
I need Sabotage to come back as a MP mode...
Orion looks mad ugly
The game play seems very slow. Call of Duty is in a bad spot
As i say, this is MY year for cod
Goes to show how much they really wanted to make this game a favorite
F*** All that... is ghost a main perk or not
$70
where is the gunfight representation 😕
Yes Sir! New to the channel. Liked and subscribed! Just in time. Thanks for the vid mate!
Has 2v2 gunfights been confirmed?
Spec Ops, baby!
I’m super upset about the perk system and the prestige system
When do mp come out
Wish there was night vision mode..
unless you change you console region to New Zealand 🤐🤫
really wanted minimap back
No gunfight? :(
cool, i guess.
Bring back prestige
@JGOD is going to hava a lot of fun with those fine tunings
Im iffy about it. Having the camos kinda was like a badge almost because many couldnt get platinum etc cause the time and difficulty. Now its kinda easy and not really like a badge of accomplishment.
No demolition :(
Is there a competitive ranking system?
I just hope lots of guns are viable options! I don’t want to just see the same 2/3 guns in the kill feed and then myself have to use them to compete.
Is it possible that gunfight is coming back?
I'm so excited for the new camos. I'm going to get them all again, this is the most fun in the game!!
No really like the perk package system. Wish they kept it how it used to be
I've not had this feeling about a cod for ages, takes me back man!!!
On PC Australia is last and not first to unlock. It's 15pm on October 28th for them. Los Angeles is first on October 27th 9pm PT.
Will gunfight be coming back?
Maybe I'm the only weirdo that loves kill confirmed. Can't believe it's not coming at launch.
It's crazy I was pulled away from Call of Duty Maybe 6:00 to 7 years ago to play Battlefield then Battlefield just fell apart and now it's like Call of Duty is picked itself up and it's looking looking real nice baby
Disbelief games are now £100
It really bothers me that I had preordered the game a month ago but it didn’t charge me I was able to play the beta and everything and now I don’t have the 100$ and u cant fucking play because it decides to charge me now I gotta wait
How many of the rewards will be purchasable only?
i subbed
HYPEEEEE 🎉🎉🎉
campaign was so good, really enjoyed it
The PlayStation 5 version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 disc does not include the game and appears to only include data with instructions to start downloading the digital version and installing 152GB to the console's storage. According to MP1st, reports began to emerge from several players who managed to get the physical version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 earlier, but found that the physical disk only includes about 70MB of data. When it's inserted into the PS5, it starts downloading the game and the launch update, mandatory to play on servers and access online modes, which takes up around 40GB and brings the total size of Call of Duty: Modern to approximately 152GB Warfare 2 on PS5. For now, we still don't have any reports about the Xbox version, but it's very likely that it's the same situation.
Camo grinding is my favourite bit. I skipped the last two games, in part, because I didn't like the camo skins.
Looks awesome! very hyped for weapon tuning. Though I thought adding a nuke to the killstreaks would be a no-brainer for a new version of mw2
Anyone else feeling like they’re 10 again?
Appreciate you bro. You work so hard to get us consistent information. Always have. Best Youtuber out there.
I hate it that you cannot ghost.... you always get the stupid UAV on to you... no skill whatsoever.. like why.. that would be the only negative thing in the game i quess
Maps are trash.
Oh wish the would have added prop hunt
No Cyber Attack.... 😕
Do we get to keep our cod points from other cods ??
no gunfight at launch, lame. guess ill wait for a sale and see if it gets added by then
Holding back toxicity in chat in other games to make sure the S&D lobbies have the right energy
What time does it drop EST? Midnight?
So they can't make a good COD game so they remake and mess it up how nice.
Disappointed it's seasonal prestiging again never going to reach master prestige again it sucks
Yo that weapon tuning is insane
the only thing im worried about is warzone 2 being the leach that feeds of new cod games like warzone 1
Like every cod I’ve played, sniper only all the way, can’t wait to piss people off with quickscoping. Sniping has always been soo satisfying. Going for clips with the boys!!
Next cod needs to be completely old fashioned as in none of this new extra shit to make the game look interesting and go actually gives a shit all we care about is getting the camos without having to level the gun up, prestige’s then once you hit max prestige you have extra special ones or up to level 1000 normal attachments normal sized maps normal equipment none of this extra dead silence and ddos shit we just want the get in a game shoot your gun throw grenades and flashes then we have a good cod, mw22 looks good but if they mess up the prestige system it’ll be dead after a few months seeing as the camo system is still a joke
Just want the old prestige system back , the black ops 3 system would be nice quite enjoyed the gold prestige’s but anything bo3 and earlier is what we need just normal prestige’s with free dlcs not this season shit like it’s fortnite
230k views at this point. Smashing it
Happy New COD guys 💯
Do you know when it drops for the Middle East?? I’m deployed and tryna play CoD👀👀
I enjoyed the beta multiplayer,and can't wait for the game starts!
Bring it on! I'm sick of playing Caldera.
We should BelieveThePanda 👌🙏
gunfight 2v2 game mode
Quick question, will Modern Warfare II have dedicated servers in South East Asia? Like Singapore maybe?
I kinda regret playing the campaign early :( but still excited for the mp. Especially the gunsmith
Please, say sth about what maps can we expect on the launch date.
they really need to find a solution for the uav/ghost issue for Search and destroy, it will create an awful experience early games tbh
So you think they will have the 2v2 mode at launch?
game isnt being realised based off local times btw. All releasing at exact same time.
What makes you think AU gets a midnight launch? The Launch Time Map shows them getting it at 3pm, OCT 28th?
Will we still be able to get a nuke for so many kills without a death?
I’m so fucking excited for this game!
Really hope they bring back gunfight!
I missed that intro sound man. 🔥🔥🔥
No specialist
wait is this midnight launch
Does anyone else know if COD is releasing 15 hours later for PC players, i cant find any info on it but according to cod themselves, console is releasing at midnight every where so Australia is the region to be as its the earliest... 8hours from this post (4PM)  I just, dont understand, pc players dont get this treatment so do we miss out on 15 hours of content, which is probbably almost enough to get to Level 55, if not atleast Level 40, probably a whole category of gold weapons and more. this doesnt make sense, someone please tell me its bs
Cyber attack?
All I want is the OG prestige system
Free for all is not a 6v6 game mode lol
Nobody:      Me: Iam a above average player and i feel like perks are just extra i dont need them really but there cool so really is what is for them.
I just wish they would get rid of the seasonal leveling. It makes leveling up meaningless
No specialist bonus is absolutely crazy
WHERES THE NUKE
I may have to “travel “ to New Zealand tomorrow morning
I've never understood these muppets that stay awake till midnight, too play the game too ''get a headstart on the rest'' and think it is a challenge to rank up fast. If you stay awake at midnight, too play a game thinking you will get ahead........... How? Because if you stay up till midnight, then crash in the morning when most NORMAL people will play it, work permitting, they will then catch you up while you sleep? I remember the last few CoD's, reading comments from people thinking it is a race to prestige..... Why? Does it really bother you that much, having a number or emblem against your name? So sad.
Can I just ask....what is the deal with hopping around corners and while in a firefight? Does it have to do with hitboxes or something? Is it really effective?
I’m curious if the nuke will be something you can call if, if they’ll add it as a killstreak, or if kills with killstreaks will stack towards it, if it’ll end the game or not, if there is specialist, but really I just love the killstreaks. You’ll catch me running vtol stealth bomber and gunship or cruise middle vtol chopper gunner all day long
I like the us Kiwis get it at midnight. Nomally we get shafted on release windows due to timezone differences.
You know… I’ve been thinking, I’m sure this is an old thought I’m sure. But I think multiplayer would be so much more diverse if they added the old prestige system back. Either stay at max level or prestige and reset everything. You’d likely see less games with people running the exact same meta setups.
Idk why but as we have gotten closer and closer to release my hype for the game has been going down
I wanted cyber attack
Is anybody having issues downloading all there updates?  I have Two of them that giving Me errors 😒
Orion looks SO GOOD. I cant wait to unlock it
I’m just wondering, is there zombies on the new mwii?
The tuning feature is massive. I dont even play COD, but I bought MW2 after not buying a single COD since advanced warfare.  However this feature will literally allow you to make your guns have no recoil, you just have to find out how to do it.
I feel like what they can do is bring back the old prestige system and go up to 15 or 20. And after you hit that switch over to a seasonal prestige system that way it can give some incentive to play after hitting max prestige/rank.
I can confirm, I'm in the multiplayer menu right as we speak. 3rd person mode has a toggle switch to have 1st person ADS or 3rd person ADS. It can be found in the graphics menu under "3rd person ADS transition". I'm playing it right now. Also there is a toggle to change from helmet cam to game perspective while spectating in prisoner rescue.
IDK about yall, but I'm mostly and probably only looking forward to the spec ops/ co-op
I wanted the moab or the nuke as a kill streak
You are the best 😊
Nice job espresso
Ready to watch videos on what is the best tune for my attachments 😂
I fell asleep hearing you talk. Just food for thought
So does that mean we are getting the old prestige system back? Like the 1-15th or 1-20th prestige? I sure hope so, always loved it.
I miss the old prestige system where you get an emblem and start over
Personally I like cod to be more realistic. I loved it how MW was prior to Warzone. It was tacti-cool but not totally over the top. The perfect mix of realism with fun customizations. You could have red camos, blue camos, skull camos and fun operator skins. But then it turned into whacky over the top customization. More toned down, realistic while still having some fun stuff I think is the perfect balance
They showing out with this one I see. 🥴🤓
yep yep
God I miss CTF.. I hope they will bring it back someday
Fuck seasonal prestige’s honestly ruined the hype for me 😩
How people can talk so much about a cash grab remake?
Campaign was so good
Tunner, even more specs to make op combos😑. For the past few years I’ve missed the og cod class system ex. Ump:sup/fmj you don’t need the perfect class to control recoil. Adding it will keep classes diverse but the attachment system is getting out of hand
If we are stuck at 55 for 2 weeks I’m going to lose interest honestly after 3-4 days I have nothing to do I don’t care about camos I don’t use  them I don’t do challenges I just want to grind online 6v6
I’m on ps5 and it won’t let me download the update
cod mobile needs these features.            Don't hate, some of us are broke.
A shame they kept this new perk system. Change for the sake of change is always worthless.
That tuning will come in handy for snipers it’ll be giving us ads speed
Grind time 💪
I grinded for zombie dark matter in Cold War and the whole year 90% of the gun looked fucking horrible hope from the start the camo works on the guns
sbmm?
you are one of the only COD youtubers who actually brings the news and doesn't scream into the camera while shilling merch every 5 minutes
i hope they got infected coming early
The proximity talk that's what I'm most excited about where you can hear your enemies in close proximity and you can talk to them that's going to be lit I can't wait
Funny I'm from NES; simpler times
Really hate that jumps around corners play style, very scrubby
Was there any update if dead silence is still gonna make that loud noise when you activate it?
Be me: live in Australia. Be stoked about getting it early like normal. Remember I play on PC now these days instead of my Xbox One X. Cry a little :')
Wake up 51 weapons to Grind for camos is to much. Its just for Playing the game everyday. What about People that Go to work?
They need to put Kill Confirmed back into the game.
Core is basically hard-core with 3 hit markers.
This game is literally nothing like MW2. They scammed us.
We still don't know if the enemies will have their nameplate above or how will they be marked. Remember, we didn't have any indicators to ID enemies and that was a concern of itself. I'm very curious about but tomorrow midnight we'll see
I don't care about modes of play.  I just want maps.  Lots and lots of variety of maps.  What are all the new maps like?
Bro I am all old now and can’t see shit. They need to put name plates above enemies… red dots on mini map when firing and regular perk setup would be nice, but not necessary
Bring back the og prestige system, this seasonal crap sucks and is just a money grab
When can I play this in Canada i got for my ps5.  Oct 27 or Oct 28 can some 1 help i am excited for multiplayer
Swear to god camos look different in Australia website platinum here is full of platinum Orion here is very different than in the video.
One thing I gotta ask, in case the video doesn't say it: will we customize our multi-player characters like Black Ops 1 or Ghosts, or is it predetermined characters Overwatch style?
seems like they changed absolutely nothing that we asked for since beta
Famas.  Not here.   Disappointing
Tuning attachments is just too much imo
love your content man keep up the great work
No FOV for consoles unexcusable
anyone else sad that there is no gun fight?
So when does the game release for consoles. I live in nc btw🙂
I am hella hyped for this cod, NOT TO MENTION we have it for 2 years? They really blew me away with this one especially considering how much of a disaster Vanguard was.....    And everyone (mainly competitive players & cod policing channels) will say the game is dogs***, while ONLY looking at the bad things about the game, which is mainly SBMM (The same thing they complained about for the past 3-4 games now)
The campaign achievements were fun to get
We need old proper prestige
I need gunfight tho...
MWII on xbox, it’s not giving me the option to download the first day update of 40GB…. :(
Why does CTF get no love.   Best game mode.  So many great clutch moments.
I don’t know why but I’m actually excited for this cod I haven’t been this excited since bo3 hope this game is a w
So in simple terms ranking up doesn't mean anything as you'll just lose it all. Naa I'm staying away from this game again
Man, New Zealand on console is gonna sound like the hot pot of the world tomorrow.
Pretty wack if we capped at 55 till sea 1. Gonna hit that in a few days some ppl In one session
Im calling in sick to play, the little kid in me is pretty stoked.
Hopefully I can get the game soon just moved into a new place but the beta was honestly fun I cant wait for the multiplayer videos 😤
I wonder if there will be other 'tiered' modes later on, like perhaps there could even be ranked or competitive modes based on tiers.
I want the old school prestige system back. I had this “seasonal progression” bs.
i want the old prestige... this is so garbage
Anyone else hear about how mw2 is malware because people are hacking
So the “challenges” are even less challenging than before. Not that they were ever challenging. Why not call it camo busy work
Yooooo hyped hyped
I just hope they fixed the excessive muzzle flash/smoke
Does anyone have the source for this website please
If they're still forcing the phone number BS, I'm not buying.
easiest grind since mw19
I thought they would of launched season 1 with the game, I am sure they usually do that and not have them separate?
any sort of ranked play? like a ranked/competitive mode?
Where is gunfight mode?
Get rid of seasonal levelling it sucks …. Bring back prestige’s … and if you don’t like losing your stuff then simply don’t prestige …..
I guess tomorrow morning, mine Xbox will be on New Zealand time zone.
I gotta say. I think I'm happy with what they're doing with the camos. It makes sense. This grind will be much easier. I only got gold on two weapons in mw19 because I just wasn't gonna try so damn hard for damascus.
What am I looking forward too the most?  What measures have they taken to quell the amount hackers that normally run rampant?
The attachment tuning is so exciting!  Maybe we won’t see everyone in warzone using the exact same barrel and mags lol.  Really though, it will be nice to have a weapon look how you want while not necessarily sacrificing performance.
I have high hopes this COD will make a huge impact on the series and the fps space. I hope it gets ranked as one of the greatest CODs ever made
The thing I'm looking forward to the most is, call of duty being an adult game again and not a fortnite rip off.. treat the player's with respect and not sell everything to us that we used to earn in the game by grinding through it.... And when i say sell, i mean those STUPID camouflage skins on guns and character's...and things that have absolutely nothing to do with the game... King Kong, Godzilla, unicorns, clowns, laser beam guns, rapper's,... Etc etc etc... I stopped playing years ago because of the route that cod has gone down, its a bloody joke and a laughing stock now.. CALL OF DUTY used to be a fun game, but not anymore. I know that I am going to get some flack for this but ghost's was the last decent cod game although I hated it at first but it slowly grew on me with some of the best maps and content in ages... And then the jetpack era was where it all started to go wrong and every year cod gets worse than the last one... Nobody is nostalgic for the modern cod's anymore.. because it just isn't FUN.. AND don't get me started with the hacker's and cheats in these games now, ricochet is a joke and a con and has NEVER properly worked and you know it
Honestly, the idea that you need to upgrade each firearm to unlock the attachments seems like a very old mechanic. Just give everybody all the attachments from the start. Am I wrong? It would only improve the balance of the game.
New YouTube update just dropped
Weapon tuning is gonna destroy casuals.
What about TTK? they didn't mention anything?
i just know that certain tunings are gonna make some guns super broken
Poor JGOD 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Did they dumb down the elephant trampling footsteps?
Weapon tuning sounds like 2K lmao
So hyped, though What’s so difficult about just having the original (and best) prestige system…?
Telling you now the weapon tuning is going to be broken
The tuning is there for the DMZ mode. Obviously
Don’t buy it. It doesn’t work. Warzone 2 is free.
Yay another 2 years of double xp not meaning a god damn thing.  Neat!
Thank god I was beginning to think IW swep the weapon tuning under the rug. And not only kill confirmed Capture the Flag is not there either.. sad face moment
Are they adding challenges for sights like in mw2019
6k subs in two days. My. Lord. I hope you meet you goal of 500k before the drop! Can’t wait to play!
What about gunfight??
I’m so glad MW2 got campaign early access. To me that basically the “real game”. Multiplayer is the extra since if I was desperate for MW2 then I would play MW2019.  Not saying I’m going to not play online, but I’m saying that while I’ll grind the first few months, I don’t see myself playing everyday for 2 years. Had a lot of fun on 3rd person, but standard TDM is super boring for old school players.
the content on the tunes is gonna be funny lmao  THIS TUNE IS OP!!!  TOP SECRECT TUNE WILL MAKE YOU A GOD!!!
So these pictures with the camos confirm we can do different camos on each part of the gun finally instead one solid camo?
Anybody know the name of the song at the end of the video?
Espresso is better then Nero, prestige, and every other cod news youtuber combined
I think I'm bout to move locations for a day 😆
NEW ZEALAND 🇳🇿  LFG!!!!
Please make a video on the best graphic/quality settings for PC, and some mouse/keyboard/controller settings you recommend.
I’m pretty excited for the camo grinding seeing there’s over 100 each gun, going for pistols first, hoping that catagory gets some love this game, need more semi-auto pistols
I hope the camo grind is like 2019 mw. I know alot of people hated it but i actually enjoyed the grind. It really made you feel like you accomplished something. If they make it easy then it wouldnt feel as special. Just my opinion.
I just checked Steam after watching this and read all of the content. SO. MUCH.  THANK YOU INFINITY WARD!! And a great thanks to you, Espresso, for always bringing us the finest content, simple, to the point, and informative. :)
Just  feel  like old gost game of call of duty!!
Hoping for the survival mode that was in MW3 to make a return.
Thank god for espresso. I was trying to find out all the info online and I was having trouble
I haven’t been this hype for multiplayer since MW19
Road to 500k 💪💪
They changed the pictures for the camos on the blog, i think this means we might be able to mix and match..
Thanks for the info! Got yourself a sub!
I really hope i don’t regret pre ordering it. Literally dropped $100 for the full package. This is the first time I’ve ever pre ordered. It looks awesome so far
all the mp was leaked so they added a new patch to the steam version that completely breaks the game, cant even play the last mission in the campaign without crashing after death
I'm hoping the mount kill requirements aren't brutal like modern warfare 2019
Go over caserma rhino please! I won't be able to even play the game with my false ban like thousands of others on steam! We need a loud voice to get activision to hear us.
You can play online now?
There's no cyber attack wtffff
It’s crazy how people aren’t subscribed to your channel, you have the best call of duty content out and your videos are unmatched bro! Keep up the good content I watch your videos every day! 🤟🏽
Good im tired of cold war
Weapon tuning sounds complicated af wtf
I'm lookimg forward to gettin shit on by cheaters because they have no idea how to stop them
Have they said how the perks are going to work for WZ 2.0?
father its me your son i miss you
I looked at the words you left under other people's comments I feel bad now
Can't wait to grind the cammos but I know I'm going to get slapped around on this game. Turned 40 this year and the reflexes have left me but I'm still a gamer at heart. Go easy on me chaps I'm an old man🤣
I really dislike season ranking systems.. old school mw2 was the best ranking system.
still no words on rank play?
Im honestly kinda excited for Spec-ops. Who else is ?
How can he already play mw2? I already played the campaign bit how can he play multiplayer
Just read patch notes, happy they added a diamond over enemy player's!!!
the tuning of a gun is WILD!!! al the youtubers are gonna have shit ton of work to figure this one out... for every weapon to meta... damn, Cod did listen to YT community real good. I'm so happy for everybody here.... lets goooo
Reckon there will be gunfight ?
I haven't watched many of your videos,  but so far you've taken the lead as my favorite cod content creator.
anybody else think Orion looks like straight dog as
All i want is ground war
Excited for the game but a bit unsure about the tunning. Looks complicated
They’ve already changed orion for the better! If you go on the blog post now it’s way different, doesn’t have the obsidian part
Tier1!!!! Hate how betas don't include hardcore. Core sucks. If I have you dead to rights shooting you first then you spin around and land a lucky headshot and kill me first is total BS... take more logic to play hardcore as you die faster.
Surely there's infected
I haven’t been this excited for a new cod since the I was a teen waiting for the original mw2 and mw3
90 fps 60 latency xD this cloudent make fun bro  shit performance d u play with raytracing on ?
will you have twitch drop Friday?
Is the score streaks still in from the beta? I really liked that
Does the tuning mean you can choose your favourite looking attachments and make them behave like a different attachment so you can just go for looks? Guess I’ll be finding out pretty soon
Noooice
Anyone in the UK I think it comes out at around midnight to 1 am
I love how much content this game has to offer
Man I wish I could tell how long I been following you
is it SBMM
Honestly expected more from the killstreaks and I hope they fixed that getting stuck on your ipad glitch 😂 all in all though looks fire loved the campaign
Prestige is key was able to explain all of it in one video
Corner campers paradise.
15 hours left for me 😁. Anybody wanna watch me stream?  I’ll have no mic cause I’m coughing my lungs out atm but I’ll stream for about 1-2 hours cause i got my doc appointment in the morning but if you wanna watch (I’m not the best lol) I’ll pop my twitch down in the comments later May just do the spec ops trying to plat the game
I wish there was a regular prestige system again. Nothing was more fun than grinding the new COD out in launch week and trying to be the first friend to prestige and then grinding it out again.
SO excited for cod this year! I haven't wanted to get on and play a game like this since I was a kid. I don't know if it's the nostalgia, the marketing or just the game itself but I'm in. Been loving the videos man, hope you hit the 500k
When can I play on Xbox in the UK?
If only they could fix the cheating epidemic..
What im skeptical about the most is the camo grind will it be enjoyable and challenging or will it be the first cod ever to make it super easy. I really enjoy a challenge but not those ones where yoy habe to sit on for days on end just to pray someone uses a certain kill streak to finish it
Im hearing there wont be kill confirm at launch?
Can you breakdown the running a little bit more?
So for my understanding Xbox can play the full game tomorrow(Thursday 27th) at 9pm?
Turning into Sports games with the complexity
Perk system is an absolute mess
That weapon tuning is such a cool idea, I really hope it works well! Love that they go all out on the attachments
Ah man I hate officer ranks. I really wanted the old prestige system back
Why is there tac insertion and NO INFECTION
Camos looking Sick 🔥🔥🔥
What I love is a lot of old veteran players coming back to play Cod again like me and a lot of mates of mine. We're so excited
Any news on improvements to the Lobby match match making ??
Your voice sounds like Graves a little bit 😅
I got my Xbox region set to Auckland and my alarm ready for 4am lmao. I haven’t been this excited since AW
On PC, are you able to change your location to play the Multiplayer early? Or is it IP-based?
I think the thing I'm least excited for, is the weapon tuning. The reason why I stopped playing WZ was the sole fact that recoil became non existent because of meta builds. Meaning if someone could hold their mouse/sticks on you, you just died. I hope they do it right so that lasers aren't really a thing, but WZ2 may be a short experience for me personally if this becomes a thing.
I like Tuning in Tokyo
Are you going live on twitch tomorrow? I’ll watch live to get that blueprint 😅
I wish they brought back the War Game Mode from Call of Duty WW2.
Regarding the 2 10 hour 2xp things form preorder, it that 10 hours for when you’re actually on the game or does the timer go down even when you aren’t on?
7k more subs lesgooooooooooooooooooooo
Begging for a Chicago multiplayer map from the campaign. In an ideal world, the L trains would rip across the tracks above you.
SBMM will ruin this for me too.
Im interested in the watches. Will there be any? Like in 2019?
As a cod fan living in Russia it absolutely sucks that mw2 is unavailable in the country. I’ve got over 1k hrs in cod mw1 and I feel devastated not being able to buy the new game…
I really hope they added weapons tuning for a good reason and not just for “infinite” weapon customization. We’ll all know the meta weapon tuning 3 days after launch and none of us will stray from that meta
I'm so hype. I love a new COD grind. I just hope they give us the ability to grind past 55 into Seasonal ranks in the launch window before Season 1 like we had with BOCW and Season 0. The camos look amazing. I hope the grind isn't too bad like MW2019
Cool now I know everyone will go to ads time
Seasonal levels should be a thing of the past miss them og prestige mode
It will be such a let down if they don't add gunfight. Hands down the best part of MW19 multi-player.
I Pre loaded the game today and thay deletet my ran and my Stewards from the beta
I love the info drop that espresso give. But I hate his gameplay dude never plays the actual object
I wish they brought back the old prestige 😔
I can’t be the only one who think this game is going to be complete shit 🙂
The length of espressos intros are going to give me an aneurism someday
Haven’t been this hyped since bo2, I cannot wait to grind this game with my older bro. Gonna be a great year fellas, stay frosty.🧊

There’s no feeling like that feeling of COD coming out in a few hours, and this time it’s for the next two years. Let’s get it boys & gals 👍🏽
I really wish hopping would be disabled for hardcore modes.. let's make the game more realistic but let players still bunny hop with full gear 🙄
Bro hoe many levels are there going to be for each weapon?
Love the videos, this cod and warzone 2.0 is where I go crazy with the grind. Hope you hit 500k before launch!
I like your videos brother, keep doing doing a great job
Dude did you steal your intro song from “Skill up”?
Idk how this game don't end up a huge bust bc not heard anything good bout it and only thing causing it hype is bc it's mw game yet campaign and multiplayer both are worse than 2019
For the first time in my cod playing career I’m going for camo challenges
first COD game I will be getting since black ops 3. i did play some mw 2019 and enjoyed it but this game looks much better and detailed. excited to get into the grind again. COD used to be SO GOOD back in the day. i hope we can get that back this year
I do hope we don’t get level capped in game we paid lots of money for!
Why do they keep this bad prestige system though, the old prestige system was soooo good
Man i hope no one glitches for the ultimate camo
Will juggernaut kills count towards a nuke, that’s the question aha
I'll keep commenting a liking because as per usual you deserve it my dude. Thanks for the top-tier news videos, I've appreciated it for every cod launch cycle for the past 3 years, and I can't see that changing any time soon! Top channel out there for this content hands down.
The update they dropped today to away my ability to play the campaign. 😂
Anyone going to use a PS5 controller on PC? Are you buying battlenet or steam and will the controller connect? (theres been issues in the past)
I just beat the campaign, can’t wait !
I'm afraid they may be trying to do too much. "Kit stars", "Spec Ops Stars", "Career Stars", XP, etc. Sometimes simpler is better, level up and unlock new guns, that's it
Seems like other camos might actually be cool to use finally 🎃
I am hoping they change the perk system. That's the main thing that is bothering me. I will say good bye to my  k/d if they don't give me ghost as a main perk. 😒
I never once was able to get the juggernaut and it won’t happen in this game either
No demolition?
you think i can grind vanguard's season 5 battlepass on the pre-season of mw2?
I'm kinda confused about the release time for my country. I live in Sweden, what time locally will I be able to play it? I'm in GMT+2
I hope gunfight is still coming in season 1
Gun customisation is gonna be SO fun !
Great content . Subbed 👍
I just got into mw2 and it said rank and stuff has been reset, I hope that doesn’t mean I’ve lost the beta rewards and the vault edition rewards
Has anyone checked on Jgod? I reckon he had a heart attack when he saw weapon tuning
There's other good COD news channels but this ones the best. Good stuff dude
Hope they give us some good ghost skins for multiplayer because I hate his base skin and I have no idea why they gave us that instead of his campaign appearance
Keep up the great content !!
I hope they bring back gunfight 2v2. Easily my favorite mp game mode
I'm gunna need that outro song on an hour long loop cause that goes hard XD
Enemy nameplates?  I’m low vision, can’t play without them.  I hope they come to be.
Is there a nuke ?
seasonal prestige again? great, so all my rankings get deleted for no reason. At least before, i can hit 6 prestige, stop playing for months, come back, and still be 6th prestige. now maxing out feels completely pointless yet again
Will our ranks from the open beta be reset when the multiplayer is released on Friday?
Despite not having dead Silence or the mini map or any of the other problems changed which I don't mind in all fairness but other then that all of this is sounding really interesting and I can't wait for it
Oh boy!! The jitters are real! Can’t wait, took the whole weekend off 😎so pumped for MW2
I haven’t done the COD completionist grind since COD4 when that was nothing like it is now. Looking forward to knocking this one out.
Change location to New Zealand
I'm excited!!
The jumping around corners is so fucking cancer in this game
I give it a monthly till everyone starts to hate it
Super excited about weapon tuning! Fine tuning a weapon to fit my playstyle sounds like so much fun
A level creator would add substance to the Spec Ops mode.
Im just exicted to play a new cod than vangarbage
really glad this channel showed up in my recommended. Thanks for keeping me up to date throughout launch!
The ghost perk is useless as UAVs are one of the main kill streaks which you get after 4 people kill streak and the perk won't activate until like halfway through or later in the match especially if you join an already started match then you most likely won't get it
I dont want a tip...     Put the whole thing in daddy
Man, it’s such a nice feeling to be hyped for a new cod again! Great video, I think it’s gonna be a great couple years! 😂🔥
I’m so happy that career challenges are back I will definitely be going for 100%
Weapon tuning is legit!!!
I love it when creators listen to their fans... I have high hopes, hope I'm not disappointed again but a triple a gaming compamy
I really want Gun Fight back in, hope to see it very soon. Incredible fun.
Hopefully I can play at 4 am lol if not I’ll just wait until 9pm PT tomorrow
so pumped to start the grind, but why are the camos different on the blog post now? the mastery camos you're showing us have changed on the blog post I'm so confused
I’d much rather the mw2019 leveling system than mw2’s I like gaining xp for just playing game and not by having to do ridiculous challenges like killing someone with a shotgun after I flashbang them.
W CAMOS, finally something worth grinding for
hey bro idd love to make content with u
They literally just changed the blog post he showed in the video again... Gold is still solid gold. Platinum is now solid Platinum, unlike what was shown in the video, Polymorphic is similar to how it was on the video but now the parts that were black are Polymorphic as well but just slightly darker. And the Orion looks way better now! Check the blog post yourself to see the new looks!
I like the idea of fine tuning but at the same time it feels like it can break the game
Please excuse my ignorance and I'm not trying to be sarcastic, why do people love these colourful weapon skins? I mean a purple glowing m4?
Call me when shipment 24/7
As a low skill casual player I dip in and out of games with fun being the goal. CoD has evolved as have many of it’s hardcore players. I’m absolutely going to get hammered and that’s okay. I’m that player who struggles to get kills while dying (being killed) is effortless.  Look out for me on-line and boost your k/d ratio lol
is the day one download available on xbox yet?
I keep seeing two different styles for the Orion Camo… I hope the one in this video is a actual one though
Seasonal prestige 😢
Where’s 2v2 Gunfight!? Is this not coming or is it a later addition?
I honestly feel like after black ops 2 , weapon camp have completely shit . And if the pictures are true of the mastery camos I would be disappointed. Like what the actual hell are those mastery camos 💀
Aah my semester is getting over at right time son !
the camos got updated take a look at the homepage ^^
I used to be a Hardcore player.  Now I’m a Tier 1 player.   Can’t wait!
You need a discord
People, please let us get the AN-94 back in the game
Any mention of missions coming back? Please tell the devs we need missions back they were the easiest way of just playing the game and unlocking blueprints, skins and calling cards. I don’t want it to be like CW and VG where the only way to get blueprints is by paying or seasonal prestige shop.
Hey just watched your video and was seeing if anyone knew about regiments and creating? will they be available on day one? Becuase ive been looking around and i havent seen anything.  Alright let me know if anyone knows anything!
1 month and it will be the same shit like every year
Are we going to have a big introduction like Vanguard are they going to livestream at tonight or tomorrow the Call of Duty
I am new to your channel I can’t wait to see the new Hardcore mode
Sitting here pre loading mw2 now. Honestly can’t wait to play to see how good the game is and unlocking mastery camos 😊
The camos look a lot better than the leak
Thank You
on the way? in australia ours unlocked 6 hrs ago
I really hope there’s a ranked mode 🤞
🍊👍
hmm I should share this to my friends...
Damn you got me hyped.
this is my first COD game atleast multiplayer besides warzone. I got hooked and can't wait to play this game. I hope everyone who gets stuck with me tomorrow night is gentle with me.
No matter how many "challenges" are in the game, it's 100% pointless after lvl 55. Why would I wanna work my ass off to 1000 when 2 months or so later you're back to 55.....ill probably do the camo grind and stop playing as I've been doing since seasonal prestige came into the picture.
Why the fukkk does the gunsmith have to be so confusing man. What the hell are these tuning sliders.
w Thx for info! Btw, nerf aim assist
I was able to login into multiplayer last night after I did a a update. But it was not live yet. I got access to the Home Screen that shows everything but only allows access to Campaign
Don’t think you mentioned score streaks. Viable option over kill streaks on an objective multiplayer mode? Appreciate your content 👍🏿
If your in north America do the new Zealand trick to play the game when it comes out tin new Zealand time
I'm so hype for this game after the last 2 flops, (imo) but thank you espresso for being my main source for CoD info!
Just subscribed. Thought i was for the longest time
Sadly won’t be a able to play till November but I’m very exited for this game (waiting to buy on pc when I have all the parts and have it built)
Love your vids Espresso! You are the one who actually keeps me updated and hyped for MWII. Keep it going!
New sub🖐
Right now I'm excited to get into MP. I completed the campaign and the first thing I want to do is earn all the Operators. Then getting into the flow of the game. I'm treating this like my last Call of Duty game as Vanguard left me lukewarm and I trust in Cold War, but Modern Warfare is a my favorite of the brands. Can't wait to dive in this weekend.
any news on Demolition mode?
no sbmm or the games already dead
Does anyone know if Xbox is getting the 40gb update?
I think what I'm most excited for is the variety of gameplay. When friends are on, play MP. If I'm solo, play spec ops. Friends like BR, WZ2. Friends prefer campaign style play, Raids. Should be great.
Don’t know about you all, but I’m headed with my Series X to New Zealand!
I’m most excited for the weapon tuning. I can (hopefully) make some faster ADS sniper rifles 😍
Co-op ?!?
As long as its better than cold war or vanguard ill be happy
No gun fight kinda mad about that not gonna lie one of my favorite modes in the game 😒
Tuning is utterly pointless without proper gun attribute stats.
I have update 52 gb for mw2 on battle net
Wasnt your name eColi Espresso? What happened to the ecoli part?
Keep up the great work bud. I am soo hyped. You are the G.O.A.T
Why does it feel like not trying to start an argument or like flame anybody but compared to Xbox and PC PlayStation multiplayer lobbies are so much easier to go crazy in
Espresso grinding out the videos
Is there a certified nuke at a 25-30 kill streak? I haven’t heard anything yet
*Me waiting for datamines to drop even tho the game comes out tomorrow*
Hype for this camo grind hope it’s not too easy tho. Keep up the work espresso!
I’m still wondering if the 40GB update is live for Xbox? I’ve restarted my console multiple times, powered on and off, still no patch update, however, the version of my game file is at the 1.03.0, which, to my understanding, is the latest version? Just wondering if anyone who is on Xbox Series console can enlighten me on this, lol?
if i can do all of that in spec ops that'll be great 👍
In love with the gameeeee. Ready for the grind!!
I miss being able to prestige and reset back to level 1, seasonal ranks are honestly boring and don't really give me the same rush as going back to 1
@Espresso are you going to stream today or when modern warfare 2 releases
Looking forward to spec ops, the raids, no red dots, and no slide cancel. This is my type of COD, im very excited.
I love the giddy feeling I get when a new cod comes out. It always brings me back to simpler times. Keep up the wonderful work Espresso, couldn't be happier to choose you as the person I keep going back to for everything cod!
The grind for those beautiful mastery camos is gonna be UNREAL!
Hopefully you can hit 500k before the launch, nice vids recently!
hi im back
Not first
first one to like.
Just a theory I have, that i see no one talking about you could use for your channel. Its seems odd platinum has so much gold camo in it and same for orion & poly having some blacked out parts…i think we will be able to choose a blueprint/camo per gun part/attachment. I would absolutely LOVE this if thats the case.
Anythings got to be better than this campaign
I can't wait for the grind
I’m so ready for the camo grind now it seems it’ll be easy
Fourth ;p
First?
First
