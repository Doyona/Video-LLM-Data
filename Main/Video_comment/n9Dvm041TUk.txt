I'm in the Band & Future-Worm are my favorite Disney XD shows
22:50 Ngl i just burst out laughter
I remember Disney xd
I don’t care about what anybody says, crash and Bernstein was peak entertainment
I usually remember watching Future Worm, Pickle & Peanut, Pokemon Sun & moon, and most importantly Phineas & Ferb for a very, very, VERY long time.
As a kid growing up in the 2010s but living in a house with vcrs and not even smelling the oppurtunity of cable, when i first got to watch disney xd at my uncles house, i was HOOKED. Mostly because it had power rangers. Hell yeah. Also i thought the XD meant Xtreme Disney or something
You forgot about Aaron Stone, the very first Disney XD original series which was premiered on February 13, 2009.  Also, are you able to do the history of Toon Disney (including the Jetix block) someday? If so, please let me know.
In latino America for some reason the fairy oddparents were in Disney XD
As someone from latin america, that grew up in the late 2000s/2010s, DisneyXD was goated, I never met someone who watched Disney Chennel, but everyone watched DisneyXD, Zeke Y Luther, Bayblade, Peter Punk, My Babysitter is a Vampire, Pair of Kings, Kick Buttowski, Ninjago (it aired in DisneyXD in my country), all bangers
A place where siblings are both the ruling Monarch. What is this, Narnia?
Pair of kings is so nostalgic for me that theme song sends me straight back to
it stands for LicroSoft
Sometimes I drink…. Sometimes I think 💯
17:51 how did I not notice the that
Pair of Kings is and has always been fire to me, and the theme is fire. Real homies never speak ill of Pair of Kings
Pair of Kings was amazing
Disney XD was my go to channel growing up alongside cartoon network. All these shows hit me with the best nostalgia, especially the nostalgia of hating a lot of the animated shows on the channel
At least now they have yugioh go rush
12:45   I cried. Brady was my favorite character and I was heartbroken that he left.   I was at my stepdad’s mom’s house and I went downstairs crying from the show and she didn’t understand me.  She eventually called my stepdad to call about how I was crying and she didn’t know why.  Eventually I managed to convey that it was because of a tv show and she was pissed off and made me go to bed early for it.  Fuck that bitch.
1:19 Pretty sure that show was specifically made for people who weren’t allowed to watch YouTube. I know that because that’s the show I watched when I wasn’t allowed to use YouTube for two weeks.
established titles is a scam‼️
Pair of Kings went hard af
Fun Fact: In crash & Bernstein there's a side character called pesto. He's played by a gentleman called Aaron Landon. After his role in crash & Bernstein he went on to become one of the developers of bendy and the ink machine as well as voicing Sammy Lawrence. I don't know why but that is still mind-blowing to me
You know that Disney XD (ex Jetix) as a cable tevision shut down from Serbia since maybe in 2013 or a 14 year and it's starts in 2009.
19:34 Why was their just a random cut? I remember you saying "This Disney sucks"
18:21 Lisa is goated
I didn't know Crash and Epstein was something I needed in my life
Wow est*blished t*tles
Ls= Los santos
I know this video is a couple years old but what is that music used in the background when Mark talked about Pair of Kings
The episode "Bros Go Pro" looked expensive
2:15 I know him it's the fucking kid ninja that gets shipped with Guy/Shezow 🙄😒
14:44 Catching Up shown before release!!!!
watching this video two years later and the sponsor....oof
ATTENTION GUYS .....there were a cartoon in which Titans were summoned from necklace ....lead boy were trying to find his lost father with a girl and eventually They get a teacher for boy to train him and evil organisation also after father of lead character ..which cartoon was that? Plot was like Powerful Titans summoned from necklace or bracelet
5:27 OOOOOOO, monke (Brent monke noises)
Always loved crash and burn and was so upset when they cancelled the show it's was amazing and I still believe to this day that it has plot
How do people talk about Disney XD and not talk about Aaron stone. One of the first shows they aired on that channel.
I grow up watching these shows and I miss watching them 😢
i loved DisneyXD my gramma had it on a lot for me and we’d watch super random unknown shows (and i watched other stuff that was there through streaming too)
1:20 DUDE I REMEMBER THIS I GOT SO EXCITED WHEN DAN WAS THERE 😭😭😭
Disney XD was alright for the first year or 2 when they still had Toon Disney shows as well as Naruto Shippuden, Fresh Prince of Bel Air, and DC animated shows
I loved alot of these shows man Zeke and luther pair of kings randy Cunningham kick buttowski  Kicking it mech x-4 gravity falls ....lets not forget my babysitters a vampire Hated when brady left tho And lets not forget Saturday nights with marvel stuff and cartoon network s toonami Ben Swartz does one of the mcducks from ducktales reboot
What's interesting to me is that over here in the Netherlands disneyXD replaced Jetix instead of that other channel I totally didn't already forget the name of
I miss Disney xD. Zeke and Luther, LabRats, Naruto Shippuden, X-men Evelution, Kick Buttowski was BANGERS. I’d swap back and forth between WWE Monday Night Raw and when it was on commercial I’d watch Disney XD. I miss those days in 2011 😔😔
You know Disney XD is my childhood favorite cable channel for teens since 2009, They had totally great shows like Phineas and Ferb, Wander over Yonder, Zeke and Luther, Pair of Kings, Lab Rats, Randy Cunningham, Star Wars Rebels, Pickle & Peanut, and many more shows that make happy like on my birthday.
Where's that talk about lab rats some other day Mark huh!!?😡 please make a video about lab rats
I remember pickle and peanut butter not much and I remember crash and Bernstein
Randy cunningham is so fire
i saw pickle and peanut as a little kid i was like this was good now im like "....... i don't remember doing drugs as a kid" 19:55 you sickos i know who you are watching this
does anyone remember parker plays
Disney XD means Xtreme digital by the way
In Colombia pair of kings was a top tier show, we all loved it, except when Luther replaced him
Some new behind the scenes stills of commando crash were leaked online. Guess this is the first step to finding it
I liked "Pair of Kings" a lot and it was not that bad of a show.
22:49 Wyatt is an amazing name
It stands for Lord and Savior. Lord and Savior Mark.
Pickle and Peanut feels like the show you watch as a kid before you're old enough to watch shows like Bojack and Rick and Morty
23:10 was that a Kanye reference?
I'm just hoping we never get a "DISNEY UWU"...
Pickle and peanut feels like a rejected adult swim clip show
Crazy thing about Crash and Bernstein, the kid plays the kid who makes the puppet is the kid they got to play young Wilson Fisk in daredevil in the flashback scene where he kills his dad. Also Mad (Cartoon Network) made a crash and bersnstien spoof where the puppet is just replaced with rainbow dash from my little pony
!!ESTABLISHED TITLES IS A SCAM!! 🚫🚫DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS SPONSOR🚫🚫
Randy cunningham had its appeal, but pickle and peanut?.. who greenlit this? 😭😭
I remember that Doctor Who aired on DisneyXD for a time, which certain episodes didn't air, and I also recall Saturday Morning Smackdown airing for  a time, rated fuckin G... that show got watered down. Certain moves were censored. Specifically the RKO when Randy Orton pulls it off, the camera cuts away before he lands on his target.
Disney XD was my childhood
6:48 ekt...? what are YOU doing here
Look what I found in your purse is crazy
Randy Cunningham 9th Grade Ninja was an underrated cartoon most Disney XD shows flew over my head or it never clicked but from the pilot I loved that cartoon and miss it
Im surprised how no one ever remembers Spliced. One if my favorite shows when I was a kid.
Rc9gn is peak
I remember Pickle and Peanut
Hi, i was a pair of Kings Fan and i actually thought that fish becoming a human was hard. Also hated buzz but watched it anyways
I actually like Crash and Bernstein
13:55 i loved this show
Mech x4
Randy cunnynham (however you write that) have one of my favorites jokes - the ninja sword can cut through anything except stupidity  - but i wasn't trying to cut stupidity i wanted to cut a bulldozer.... Oh
Crash And Bernstein Was Soo good. I remember ALOT 😂
I also grew up in Ireland during the same period. I recall only watching Gravity Falls.
That sponsorship did *_not_* age well lol
"look at what I found in your purse this morning" is absolutely hilarious
mildly fun fact one of the co-creators of randy cunningham, was born in my town and went to the same college as me
He forgot to talk about gravity falls
Me and my bestfriend loved crash and bernstein so much that we started doing the head bang (skallebank in norwegian) everytime we said goodbye. And I really loved DisneyXD as a kid!
Lab rats will never be forgotten
12:51 as a huge pair of king Stan, this change was heartbreaking cause Brady was my favorite character.   This other guy was just not good. He didn’t bring the charisma Brady brought.
I wonder how Jeremy wasn’t written off of Phineas and Ferb given Musso’s arrest the same way he was kicked from pair of kings
I’m in the band was my favorite fr
Oh yeah the established titles scane was still going around like 2 years ago
Dude I watched crash and bernstein as a kid and it was peak
I can’t be the only one who thought the XD stood for Xtra Disney
I knew all of these shows, had seen a couple episodes if not more of each. But I do not remember Pickle and Peanut and I think that says a lot about the quality lol
"Sometimes I drink" "Yeahhhhhhhhhhhh" "Sometimes I think"  Yeahhhhhhhhhhh Idk if music is your thing.. 😭😭😭😭
Im doing a watch of Daredevil and i xould not for the life of me understand where i recognised young Fisk from. HE'S FROM CRASH AND BERNSTEIN. And thats all
I adore Randy cunningham so much, honestly all of this shows were my childhood, I adored them so so much The superhero mornings, kid vs kat, slugterra, apir of kings and even zeke and luthor at times. They were my favorite. I miss those days and this was a fun watch to be reminded of them
Jessie was peak
I remember the summer days of watching Crash and Bernstein with my younger brother. That was a pretty fun show!
I used to love Disney xd
I would also review a Gamers Guide to pretty much Everything
Pickle and peanut seemed more like a rip off of uncle grandpa. Just pure weird chaos 😅😅   I personally think unc G did it way better tho.
They bought the rights to naruto shippuden towards the channels inception,  and that was what got me to tune in. I will say, i watched the ninja cartoon they had and a couple others that were pretty good. I wanna say the superhero robot monkey show was on there as well but I cant remember. That may have been CN 😅
Slugtera will be remembered
Wait what about Tron Uprising?
One of the few videos where the topic was something I have genuine nostalgia for! Disney XD was where I lived during my early-mid 2010s childhood, before I was allowed to regularly use YouTube and could understand it.   The shows I watched were RC9GN (Funny that I’m now watching the Sonic movies with that same Ben Schwartz voice), Wander over Yonder, Kick Buttowski, Doraemon, Doctor Who (I forget the Series #, but it was the first one with the Tenth Doctor {David Tennant}), Max Steel, Slugterra, Crash & Bernstein, Kid Fury, Packages from Planet X, Camp Lake Bottom, Gravity Falls (probably my favorite), Phineas & Ferb, Milo Murphy’s Law (lost interest before the inevitable Phineas & Ferb crossover), Star Wars Rebels (underrated show), Lab Rats (quit before they went to the island), Penn Zero: Part Time Hero (did they cancel it b/c of T.J. Miller?), and Mighty Med.   I practically lived on that platform! Shame it’s no longer with us, even though it did try to underhanded tactics at times. It truly was an epic 90s time…
Its interesting to hear this stuff as Disney XD got replaced with Disney Jr just a couple weeks ago here in The Netherlands. Its honestly a shame in my opinion
I watched a lot of Disney XD as a kid. My little brother and I preferred it to regular Disney Channel. I also loved Pair of Kings and hated when they changed characters. I freaking loved Kick Butowski. I really enjoyed Crash and Bernstein as a kid too. Pickle and Peanut made me uncomfortable...
I think I used to watch this as a kid wasn’t it on Netflix at one point?
Hey bro, great video you made! can you do a episode about I´m in the Band, would really like that
Pickle and Peanut appeared on Chibiverse during a cheer squad .
Disney XD had Naruto shippuden
Late to the party (blame YouTubes recommendation) but one of my favorites from Disney XD was Slugterra that show went hard when I was a kid
See the funny thing is Ben Schwartz does very similar voices for duey from ducktales and leo from rise of the teenage mutant ninja turtles, making him have three roles with blue coded characters
Thanks for reminding me about some of these lmao
Dude I remember crash but forgot the name for sooo long thank you
I loved Randy Cunningham, it was my favorite show as a kid and I still like it now. I prefer the later seasons though where they try to expand the lore
2 years late BUT I was a huge Pair of Kings fan, loved the theme song, loved the plot, was devastated when Adam Hicks replaced Mitchell lmao
2:32  Ooof
Sorely disappointed that I looked at the timestamps and saw nothing about ‘I’m In The Band’.   Am I the only one that watched that show??  Edit: okay so the video does mention it briefly after all
I just remember Crash being the most grating, annoying, insufferable character in existence, and he still is.
Growing up watching XD, I always felt like it was Disney but a little bit older. It didn’t have those toddler or kid shows that Disney had in the early morning.
How dare you not include wander over yonder
I love wander over yonder so much, randy cunningham and pair of kings were really fun to watch too :)
So glad to FINALLY see someone giving respect to Crash and Bernstein! That show made up like half of my childhood!
1:54  U GREW UP IN IRELAND!!??!?!..
Yea I don’t understand this video
3:00 my family legally owns 1 square foot of scotland
whenever i think of disney xd shows i always think of hotels cuz thats the only time i ever watched disney xd and most the shows i saw were boring af as a kid
List of bangers
Disney xd was rlly just Disney channel for the bros
To give Disney XD its cr@ck that the Writers used to create half of there line-up. As a kid i enjoyed some of there stuff, especially first Three seasons of "the lab rats" "crash and bernstein" and  "kickin' it" + a weird thing that happened is that pickle and peanut had a promotion and a crossover episode on a polish Story minecraft channel named "DCStudios" as a Significant plot point
Im a girl and i loved Kick, crash and berstein and pair of kings 💙 my childhood man.
Randy Cunningham's intro was so bad (or long) that in my country (Türkiye), after this scene at 15:12, it jumps to this part of the intro 18:14. Until I watch it on Disney plus, I thought that was the whole intro
14:59 I actually adore Randy Cunningham the 9th grade ninja 😭😭 it was one of my favourite shows with the art style being beautiful! It didn’t help that I had a massive crush on Randy as a kid 😂❤
Yeah I was unfortunately the peak demo for these shows back when they first aired, and I LOVED them all 💀
As someone who grew up with Disney XD and undiagnosed ADHD I’m 99% sure most of these shows significantly nerfed my attention span so irreversibly
19:49 thats literally the plot of an episode of family guy
Wasn’t shippuden on Dx?
After watching Mr nostalgia’s video on Zeke and Luther, I gotta say your review was so inaccurate and disingenuous
What i think is the most dead series to ever come out of DisneyXD is probably camp lakebottom, that shits peak
no way mark defends crash and burstein but says zeke and luther was bad 😭😭
What about two more eggs
Um is that blue lock reference 2:25
Peakle and Peaknut
I watched  a bunch of a pair of kings episodes and its was pretty good
10:43 my calling, omg. Yeah thats me. I watched that shit when it was on netflix ALL the time. It was my favorite show from the disney xd era and yes, i was on the edge of my seat for a good amount of it
Crash and Bernstein was just pure, young boy, stupidity, and I loved it, until I pretty much forgot about it for almost… Check notes, 12 years
Why does nobody talk about Aaron stone
I associated "XD" as a way to express laughter through text. Pretty much a written Emoji if you will.  X being the eyes. and D being the mouth. Which is inline to the era DisneyXD was introduced. Especially if you were on a social platform back then which would probably be Anime chat rooms, or forums.
A few more shows that are forgotten. Kid vs kat, Penn Zero part time hero, kickin it, and gamers guide to pretty much everything. Some might be acquired. I don't remember much about kid v kat but Penn Zero was one of my favorite shows that never got a big audience
“Disney😆”
Im i the only one who likes zeke and Luther?
Pickle and Peanut just sounds like Mr. Meaty
Your Pickle & Peanut opinion suckssss!!
22:51 that was actually kinda funny lol
4:22 I guess you could say that he’s a “tough Cookie” 🥁
1:27 it was still awesome tho
MECH X 4
I still use EPIC to this day
I remember each one of these quite fondly. And these are all of my favorites
Unironically I love crash and Bernstien
Disney Lol is actually a real thing (I USED TO PLAYED IT A LOT IN COMPUTER LAB)
Sir, i remember ever single show you mentioned on this video. I also did not like pickle n peanut
1:35 I had restricted internet access as a kid so I loved those youtuber shows, it also is what introduced me into overwatch from when they streamed the league
I feel like Pickle and Peanut is just a fusion of Uncle Grandpa and The Regular Show that just sucked
iCarly is the only show that did the toe-stuck-in-faucet gag right, and I won’t be explaining why.
The LS could stand for lord and saviour (the and is silent)
19:34 Why is there a cut there? I could have sworn there used to be a "THIS DISNEY SUCKS" and a rundown of that regular show episode where they go from having to set up a birthday party to unleashing demons from an arcade game
I like to think LS stands for little shit
19:33 why did he remove “this disney sucks!”
I enjoyed pickle and peanut because of the nonsense and weirdness (note one of my favorite shows to watch especially with my uncle was Uncle Grandpa
Tbh I really loved Disney XD growing up as a Brit in Germany having a TV Chanel I could watch in English was so amazing to have as a kid not just the German bullshit TV
This guy had ZERO accent until the ad read
Anyone remember mech x4? When I was a kid I loved pickle and peanut, mech x4, and kick buttowski. 100% nostalgia
2:31 my boy watch dbz abridged
14:44  The scene what was that show/animations calls😅
dont ever talk bad about my goat pickle and peanut ever again
YOU SCAM YOUR AUDIENCE
YOU SCAMMER
THE TITLE PACK IS A SCAM
11:00 the disrespect for Pair of Kings' theme song 😭😂  Edit: I believe in Crash and Bernstein supremacy
Just gonna say the established titles add aged like milk
Nah this brings back hella memories🤣
im 15 rn so i was the target demographic for this content when it was airing, I loved it.
Amanda: look what I found in the shower this morning 22:48   Crash: 22:51 whatever look what I found in your purse this morning
There is a show on Disney XD that got cancelled that was so good. Do you know Tron: Uprising ?
OK, I just gotta ask. Am I the only one who remembers Aron Stone?
You want forgotten? Try Aaron Stone, Mech-X4, Max Steel, or Kick Buttowski
I remember pickle and peanut grossing me out a lot when I was younger
6:38 also in a commercial about foster care!
RC9GN is a good show  And our fan community is pretty big
Crash and Bernstein was PEAK, where’s that sequel series?
You haven't played M&M's Kart Racing and it shows
I was the pair of kings fan getting gassed over the fish becoming human
Crash and bernstien was one of my favorites growing up lmao still think of the theme song once a week
What is music at 18:23
23:09 YO IMA LET YOU FINISH BUT…
I loved Randy Cunningham!!! I was so sad when I never got to finish it.
2:32 so does the S stand for scam?
Crash and Bernstein slander will not be tolerated
I mean to be fair Mitchell had a pretty strong background in music before he made a comeback in it later unlike the other dude so it makes more sense
I totally forgot about pickle and peanut, that shit is based shut your whore mouth
13:50 I remember Randy Cunningham
Welp that sponsor didn’t age well lol
So you telling me nooooooo one remembers slugterra omggggg
Call me dumb😂, crash and Bernstein was the right amount of dumb to be funny to me as a kid 😂, crash was just a hothead and no one can tell him what to do 😂
Bro there still more:   Future-worm  Billy dilly’s super and duper subterranean summer  Kirby buckets   Walk the prank   American Dragon Jake Long  11 (yes that’s the name)
i love owning one blade of grass in scotland!
A Curiosity of disney XD is that some programs broadcast by Cartoon Network such as Ninjago or Beyblade Metal Fusion, Fury and Masters, were broadcast here on the Disney XD in Latin America is that some programs broadcast by Cartoon Network such as Ninjago or Beyblade Metal Fusion, Fury and Masters, were broadcast here on the Disney XD in Latin America.
Aaron Stone and Kickin’ It were my favorite💯
I was poor ash growing up nd my better off cousin always had Disney XD playing while he played games I remember that ninja show made me fall off a wall as a kid 🤣
XD is the smiley ace folk
why do you keep switching between an irish and an american accent?
Is it me or does it seem like some clips were cut from this video?
No pair of kings slander will be tolerated
1:55 guilty as charged… I loved (and still love) Disney XD
Crash and Burn, Tear it up Dude!
i will not stand for this pickle and peanut slander 😔
I love pickle and peanut and so does everyone I show it too
Are we positive that Disney XD doesn’t stand for X-Treme Disney?
the best live action show in disney xd (and probably all the kids networks) is "im in the band". That shit didnt need to be so fucking funny
Randy Cunningham? That was ME I was the one person who watched it back in the day, and thus I believe I should be crowned "number one fan"
I don't think your Gen Z bro😅 your talking about these shows like they were just "okey" this is literally my childhood your talking about 🤦🏾‍♂️
I’m in the band I thought that show was great
I’m about 2 years late but why do you say lemonade mouth like that. Is it an accent thing that prohibits it or do you just never say those words so have no practice? If you read this or even see it please reply and tell me
Pair of Kings until they replaced Musso was literally one of the best shows ever.
RAWR
Only fav episode was the fountain of youth episode of pair of kings.
He forgot to mention Yin Yang Yo.
trippin bout saying pair of kings song being trash
You also forgot about Kid vs Kat
1:18 Brazil was one of them, but not anymore XD
Mane you forgetting about KID VS CAT everyone forgets that one
Pare of kings was my favorite xd show right behind kid vs cat
Where is kickin it
Pair of kings , was top 5
Kick Buttowski and Zeke & Luther are forever my favorite shows. Theyre unmatched and growing up skating, this is like a time machine to those days. The intro comes on and the nostalgia hits SO hard
Peanut and pickle isnt that bad go watch two more eggs thats was idk
Crash and bernstein was actually amazing
I can't believe you SCAMMED people with "established titles"
Nahhhhh broooo. Randy Cunningham was goated from the start bro🙌🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They lasted long enough to give me a decent childhood so I’m satisfied
Atomic puppet and Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil: left the chat
Kelsey Chow is still one of my celebrity crush’s. Still gorgeous as ever, even more so now
Who remembers fish hooks?
As someone that was always grounded with nothing but tv (and no attention span to really watch it), there’s SO many that I’ve seen a few times and never heard about again
Okay disney xd was not a sister channel and YOU know it. That shit had big brother energy all the way😂
Lab Rats is so goated
Bro got arrested for being a normal teenager heard
I used to love pair of kings as a kid
Not even lying crash and Bernstein did get its own meme (thats dead by now)
Lmao Disney child stars either go the Miley and Sabrina route or the Mitchell and Adam Route or just completely vanish off the face of the planet
I miss when stuff had edgy cool rock/metal music in it, I grew up with metalhead parents so I loved that kind of stuff even as a young kid and having some of my favorite shows and games have kick ass rock and metal was like frosting on the cake for me (I basically came out the womb watching Batman beyond for example, it is my favorite show ever for a reason). Now it’s depressingly uncommon to hear even slightly hard or heavy music in anything, so games like doom, trepang, killing floor 2, metal hellsinger etc are god sends.
These shows were not forgotten I think about them all the time
A Canadian show that I will never stop suggesting is Dententionare! It was my favourite show, I would wake up super early just to watch it! It streamed on Teletoon but was cancelled because of “low viewership”. I will never forgive Teletoon for that.
The kid that plays Bernstein is also young Wilson Fisk in Daredevil.
I feel like the true forgotten show is Aaron Stone, the OG Disney XD show that I never see anyone talk about when talking about Disney XD.
Randy Cunningham 9th grade ninja will always be my favorite Disney xd show
pair of kings was such a good show. me and my sister would be waiting every time a new episode aired… but after brady got kicked off the show it became slowly unwatchable then got cancelled. Crash and bernstein was another show we always watched bc of how dumb and funny it was
I never had Disney XD (I was only allowed to watch PBS kids) but before Disney+, most of the shows were put on netflix. I watched Pair of Kings RELIGIOUSLY when my parents would give me netflix time. I honestly thought the triplets reveal was really cool, but was confused why the other actor never showed up again. Now all these years later I can finally put that mystery that I've never thought about since I was 9 to rest...
5:46 Maybe the writer just thought the Wii U sucked and wanted to put a superior console in the show
I'm in the band mentioned 😭 fav show
This channel had a chokehold on me as a child mostly because the main channels Disney and Nickelodeon made you pay extra for them on cable 😭
I always thought growing up, that the XD stood for “Xtra Disney” but then was like “wait, then that would mean Disney Xtra Disney
dont go bad mouthing kickin it that was fire
If I remember correctly the XD either stands for Xtreme Disney or Xtra Disney. I’m pretty sure it’s the first.
What about Aaron Stone
Loved this channel most shows were goated 😅😂
5:58
i remember staying up late into the night to watch American dragon on XD
That 'epic' marketing tactic worked on me like a charm. Even if they catered more to boys, as a little girl I loved almost every dumb show in that channel.  EXCEPT PICKLE AND PEANUT! THAT SHOW CAN GO DIE IN A WHOLE!
Ngl Disney cod first 5 years had me in a chokehold
Bruh, wut if “XD” stood for “Xtreme Disney”!!!😮😂
"Look what I found in the shower this morning" "Whatever. Look what I found in your purse this morning." That actually made me laugh out loud, goddamn.
zeke and luther pair of kings and kick buttowski were my childhood
Can't believe you fell for a scam
I remember being obsessed with Disney XD and thinking it made me so different and cool and not like other girls I watched Suite Life on Deck back when I was 18 and I still loved it despite the campyness And you cant make me hate the Pair of Kings theme   I dont think i watched the ninja show, but i was obsessed with the computer game they made for it. Its probably what started me off gaming
you say forgotten i say i remember all of these except for pickle and peanut
Crash and Bernstein was the last show I remember watching on it before I moved and lost cable 😂 it was so cringe and I was glad to stop watching TV
Kid me would've absolutely hated you for your opinion on Randy Cunningham. At the time, that was peak cinema for me
Randy Cunningham was my jam in the day
I love suicide jokes in 2023
Let’s be honest,  Saying Disney XD is much better than seeing it as the emoticon ‘XD’, X D is so much better
I loved Randy Cunningham as a kid it was so entertaining
I lovvvvvved pair of kings😭 but when they replaced him with that ginger dude I did not fuck with as a child I was like damn and stopped watching 😂😂
Wokeseny XD
wokeseny
CRASH AND BERNSTEIN IS FIRE THATS MY SHIT RIGHT THERE!!!! ITS MY FAVORITE TV SHOW EVER!!!!
No Aaron Stone??? That show was fucking awesome as a kid idk about now but back then it was the shittttt
XD meant xtra Disney and Disney LOL was actually real 😱😱🤯🤯🤓🤓☝️
should've done Aaron Stone
You seriously don't know what the x stands for? Its for extreme 🤣
Bruh I used to watch Disney XD all the time when I was a little kid, bro. It was always my favorite childhood shows. 😢
I was the same in the sense that I and my friend stopped watching Pair of Kings because Box entered and I thought, yeah whatever!
Disney XD was goated. And is still alive and kickin in the netherlands. Recess, pokemon, inazuma eleven, cory in the house, phineas and ferb, etc. Were my youth
I wish people would stop taking established titles sponsorships, it's basically an over priced piece of paper with deceptive marking around to glossy it up. Kinda disappointing
Crash and Bernstein is literally a family friendly version of SML/Ted
Zeke and Luther was the bane of my existence as a kid. I just absolutely did not like it. I only ever watched it whenever I was completely out of anything else to do.
You should cover Disney XD Original Movies. (No, not Disney _Channel_ Original Movies, Disney _XD_ Original Movies.)
18:21 is that Delin from shenmue 2?
Um can you do max steel its one of my faverito so please do ir
I could not get into live action Disney XD shows, I would turn the channel whenever those shows came on. Did not like Pair of Kings. Only thing that I liked about Pickle and Peanut was the outro song. Randy Cunningham I actually enjoyed.
Crash was my fav on the channel during that time
I tuned into this channel a bunch back then for Avengers: Earth’s Mightiest Heroes. I was slowly becoming more aware of what about Marvel Comics I was really missing out on at the time and I adored EMH. I still adore it even today and I am so sad they rushed their finale material and then cancelled the show outright so they could make one to connect more to the MCU films.
Zeke and Luther was the best
Man I hate how Irish people say jail
I genuinely loved Zeke and Luther   I was a poor kid who still had a GameCube and was basically living in the 2000s   so it deeply resonated with me culturally.   it was like seeing my redneck life turned into skater punk.  it had a weird indie charm to it.
18:20 was not expecting to hear Work Harder lol
I miss when they didn’t play a million reruns of big city greens every morning
Donnie cates needs to have more say in marvel, everytime they hand a main book to him, he knocks it out of the park.  The best books the company's put out in years are both put out by him (venom 2018 - king in black, and thor 2020 - 2023) and both times after he left we got straight back to mediocrity
In my opinion pickle and peanut is like regular show mixed with aqua teen hunger force
Pickle and Peanut is actually hilarious I highly recommend 😂
Well- I was one of those hardcore Pair of Kings fans-
ad read shows how dated this video is now.
Was I the only one that watched walk the prank as a kid?
I always thought XD ment Xtreme Disney
I remember Pair of Kings, and I remember really liking it
I HATED SEASON 3 PAIR OF KINGS
My favorite show was Slugterra
6:40 PLINKETT IS EVERYWHEREEEEE
Listen right now Kapow and counterfeit cat were really fucking good with Disney XD going down. There were a lot of good shows that weren’t on YouTube and now just non-existent hell you could probably class a few of them as lost media like two eggs and bacon, it was a bunch of random skits and stuff done in 2-D animation also there were a lot of Australian specific ones that I watch. I can’t really remember too many of them but there were a lot.
As a child/young teen I never commeneted Disney XD to the XD reaction. I always saw it was extremme or something like that, like The Two leters where X and D like POkemon X and Y or CN when refering to cartoonenetwork
With Randy Cunningham, you should’ve mentioned the mystery surrounding the guy in the cowboy hat.  He was shown to be REALLY important in the show but it ended before they could resolve that.  And he seems to know the ninja. There was someone just like him with the first ninja that they show momentarily when explaining what the final lesson for all ninjas is.
crash and bernstein was my JAM as a kid!!!
WHY WAS JIMMY TWO SHOES FIRST EVEN THOUGH IT WAS FROM JETIX AND IT WAS FORGOTTEN! AND S2 WAS LITEARLLY GETTING PEOPLE LIKE oh let’s just forget that we watched this I LIKE THIS SHOW AND YOU CAN GET MAD AT ME ALL YOU WANT!!
XD Stands For “Xtreme Digital” See
I watched more Disney XD than actual Disney in general
What’s that game at 1:25? The one that’s in the jungle. It reminds me of a game I just can’t remember
Who here remembers Right Now Kapow
Randy Cunningham 9th Grade Ninja has got to be my favorite Disney XD show. It's 10 times better than Pickle and Peanut for Pete's sake.
It’s really funny how in your big mouth video you say that kids learned from big mouth. Just to be clear back in 2019, planned parenthood made 78% of its revenue from abortions. And an ex director went on multiple shows and said that they were told to sell abortions. The president even said multiple times that the fact that they “offer mammograms” was a lie.
Seriously establish titles?
Disney xd is my childhood 2009 to 2017 is was great pair of kings is my favorite show
20:16 you can honestly tell that the show had alot of love put into it's animation, I just wish it had that same love when it came to the actual show, the potential was amazing for what we got.
14:45 first clip of catching up!
Lab Rats was a goated show
I loved Randy cunningham
Yeah I don’t know if Randy Cunningham was forgotten…
I’m watching Randy Cunningham now
Lee Kenneth Allen David Rodriguez Barbara
y’all really were watching brain rot before tiktok, the shows are so bad I feel cringe knowing y’all feel any nostalgia towards em😂
100000% guarantee no modern show even comes close to being as good as the 90s/early 2000’s. adventure time was just about the last & that was still leftover teenagers hangin on for life lmao
Crash the muppet support Bernstein in a friendly way. I forgot that show
Phineas and Ferb
I love the clip of his pilot is in old videos sgows how long hes bern working on it!!
You think anyone else theorized that "Pickle and Peanut" was probably made on weed brownies or something?
put some respect on pickle and penuts name bro
Triplets born,a throne awaits a seer warns of a deadly fate Give up your childern.seperate. bide your time lie in wait  Sonic underground! Sonic underground!

I long for my childern,but I have to wait... to act too soon could seal their fate.. They made a vow there mother will be found! Sonic underground!
I remember a lot of these shows especially because back then Naruto was airing on DisneyXD and I had to as a big Naruto nerd. Randy cunningham particularly was memorable because it claimed to be a ninja show so my 14 year old self was like “ninjas = naruto” and it understandably wasn’t but I hated the show for that reason
I don’t remember to much about Crash and Bernstein except how people would throw him around, especially when the principal I believe tries to throw him out the door and has to do it again cause the door was closed 😂 Honestly still makes me laugh
Im late af, but randy Cunningham intro was different here in latam and actually slapped, the shows dub made in mexico is actually great I didn't know it was terrible in the US
Kids are so impressionable,i was like 10-11 when i watched the disney channel and i thought these shows were all amazing...looking back it was just nostalgia
The 9th grade ninja Is Is good Do you know Randy Voice actor is The same Voice actor Off Leo from rise of the turtles
What about slugterra or max steel me personally they were top tier
Remember, Mitchell Musso also had his own show on Disney Channel called Prank Stars that releases at about the same time his arrest happened.
Another forgotten show is Kirby Buckets, which from what I remember follows a boy(Kirby) with a bully older sister just trying to survive middle school. Obviously that sounds boring, so  Kirby is a cartoonist.
As a Cunningham, I think Randy Cunningham is goated.
My favourite time machine movie
WHERES gravity falls D=
Ninth grade Njnja, S3 ans Crash and Bernstein were some of my favourite shows! Crash and bernstein more so, I loved the muppet aspect and the absolute unhinged nature of him.
unironically loved Pair of Kings as a kid remember trying to catch all the episodes new
Over 10 years later and I still love Crash and Bernstein to this day.
These sitcoms for boys weren't as popular and it was short-lived comparing to what Disney channel waa doing you know it Hannah Montana wizards of Waverly place Sonny with a Chance shake It Up all of them being a girl demographic and they were way too popular especially when it blast off some of the biggest names
Remember that time on Disney XD did a YouTuber Collab with Parker plays and every other YouTuber with a show player select
20:57 pickle and peanut was cocaine for my ADHD brain. Kinda slightly gave me asdf movie vibes. But its definitely not the best show ever. It was loud and distracting enough for when i couldn't sit still
15:45 IS THAT A KINDERGARTEN REFERENCE
10:34 HAHAHAHAHA 😂
Mark just gave me a Vietnam Flashback of Pickle and Pennut and how Id have to sit through the show cause nothing good would be in any other channel at the time, and I jsut recall one episode where Pickle makes the worlds best cookies and his secret ingredient was just the Ashes of his dead Grandma
25:16 Erm, Crash, bro. You look succulent in a button-down dress.
Randy, Kick Butt, and Two Shoes are still well remembered
Burbank is the Morioh for Disney XD stars
shut up I liked pickle and peanut
I can't BELIEVE you didn't talk about Wander Over Yonder! It was such a great show that was completely sabotaged by Disney. If you see this, please check it out Mark!
In like 2015 when pickle and peanut came out I unironically loved the show and I told my friends and they told me that the show was ass
Crash actually got arrested for picking up a prostitute with possesion of over an ounce of heroin. He’s still in prison but I’m sure his rap comeback will also be EPIC
Not gonna lie I was a DisneyXD kid I fucking loved those shows and I still think some of them hold up today
Eeeeeeeek Established Titles?! Shame.. shame.. shame!!!!!!
It's like Disney was trying to make their version of "Regular Show" with "Pickle & Peanut" but ended up making another "Sanjay & Craig" instead
Strangely enough, the flash games that went along with these shows were almost better than the shows themselves.
Lord saltine crackers mark
I will never forgive Disney XD for killing Toon Disney
ggtpme is forgotten know
The begining 😂
yes. yes i do.
If anyone cares, there was this one show called Billy Dilley and it basically aired on Disney XD for a week and just disappeared, it was also the last original show made for the network (the show is on Disney+ btw)
For some reason when pickle and peanut first came out I was really obsessed with it. Like to the point of getting my mom to paint them and hang it up on my bedroom wall.
Mate you missed one Mech X 4
There was a cartoon on Disney xd, I've been looking for it for years but I can't find it.  There was a girl with orange hair as the lead character and her brother.  They had cafes, they could also be restaurants. The girl had a boy she liked, and she even got stuck in that cafe with that boy once.  Apart from this, there was also a bald boy with glasses at the girl's brother's school.  If anyone knows, please tell me
Thurston waffle cat my beloved
RIGHT NOW KAPOW IS A SHOW THAT EXISTED!, GOOGLE IT!
I LOVED crash and Bernstein. I was old enough when it came out that I could kinda appreciate "so bad its good"
I didn’t watch Disney XD a lot but the two shows I did watch whenever I saw that they were playing was Kickin’ It and Randy Cunningham 9th Grade Ninja. I’m only gonna talk about Randy Cunningham though cause it’s literally no secret that Kickin’ It was Disney XD’s most popular show. To this day, I see so many people who were fans of Randy Cunningham say that they want to see the show comeback as a Disney+ show. I’m one of those people. The art style was so awesome (thanks Jhonen Vasquez!) and the over arcing story was super well done! It was the perfect combo of silliness and maturity because Randy did learn a lot while being a ninja, but the show also reminded us that he was still a teenage boy who wasn’t perfect. I also love that the fandom isn’t cringe and is actually well represented online. Most of the fanart I see is really good and any fanfics I read back in the day were good and actually tied in well with the original story (most of them completed the story the show was trying to tell)
Kid vs Kat had to be my favorite XD show  I literally had every episode recorded so I could watch it whenever I wanted
Sponsor aged like milk
I miss every epic show and transition.. especially fish hook. I hate how hard it is to get back into shows you used to love..
crash and Bernstein was one of my favorite shows when I first seen it as a kid, I was like damn why they cancel it
Me: Sale  Mark: Seal
Man, I remember seeing these shows when I was a kid. I haven’t seen them since forever.
Pair of kings is that niche show i watched as a kid that i dont remember but fully remember
14:45 we didn’t notice. We couldn’t tell. We were fools. THE LS MARK CARTOON!!
I love the Ninja Show   It’s dumb but that’s the point
It means Xtreme Digital which is a nigh meaningless name but it certainly doesn't mean 'nothing'
The best Disney xd show is Milo Murphy's Law the sequel to Phineas and Ferb
Randy Cunningham Ninth Grade Ninja i adored lol. Motorcity, Tron Uprising, Kick Buttowski, Penn Zero: Part Time Hero were all HYPE Shows.
I remember loving crash and Bernstein. It was so weird and I loved the muppets so I liked it a lot. I remember one joke in particular where crash painted a beautiful landscape scene and Bernstein said “ you can paint that but you can’t even color inside the lines?” And I was like yep peak comedy right there.
picklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpicklemanpickleman
I’m just glad I’m not the only person in the world who watched pair of kings and zeke and Luther as a kid
I used to love pickle and peanut since there was no dub or even cartoon network in my country to watch regular show. I have good memories of it, but yeah if im gonna watch it today i will smash my screen, i was a rly dumb kid (like i enjoyed fanboy and chum chum)
Nah bro the pair of kings intro song was awesome 🤣
i watched crash and bernstein RELIGIOUSLY as a kid
You should absolutely talk about Kirby Buckets! I loved it as a kid and it's truly forgotten, Penn Zero part-time hero is another good animated show you should review too.
Avengers:Earth's Mightiest Heroes was really good on XD. Shame it got cancelled and had to have a garbage, rushed ending.
Am I tripping or is the Zeke&Luther Logo the German version saying "und" instead of "and"
Established titles? Damn, bills must be rough if you’ve gotta stoop that low.
god. I remember Crash & Bernstein.
When you said "Remember Disney LOL?" at the start I had a _very_ brief moment of mandela effect XD
The irony of describing Disney XD as a "sister channel" to Disney Channel is hilarious.
Nah I forgot about crash and burnstein classic🤣
Established Titles = Dislike.
XD doesn't mean anything because it's just supposed to be the XD emoji
Lmao and now I love pickle and peanut just for it being a great stoner show
I adored and grew up with Disney xd I still rewatch Randy cunningham till this day
Fan fact:Mighty Mad made same person who made Phineas and Ferp and Also recommended check Lad rats out because is really funny show and my favorite Disney XD show and my favorite Disney sitcom and my second favorite sitcom.
2:47 Oh... Yikes... That did not age well... r/agedlikemilk
Sadly (jk not really,) don’t remember any of these shows
Wow... In my country, Pickle and Peanut only aired around 3 in the morning, so I always thought it was a bizarre adult cartoon, I didn't know it was on Disney XD... that is the biggest surprise to me, considering I watched like 10 seconds of it while chanigng the channels and getting scared and scared(😏) at a lot of adult programming.
Oh... Established Titles... That aged well.
I loved pickle and peanut and crash and bernstein
Great now it turns out that cartoon I liked turns out to be one of the worst on the channel.  I'll still say I liked Pickle & Peanut.
hold up, whats the show at 14:44?
Established titles is false advertising and basically a scam btw
That "In the Mansion" bit was one of the worst things that I've ever heard, it's a true testament when something can give me a pure sense of cringe. I also liked the black guy that they added, nodding his head to the beat, like "See this black guy? /He/ approves of it, so it can't be that horrible!".
I was born in 2002. I was OBSESSED with Randy Cunningham, Pair of Kings, Zeke and Luthor, Lab Rats, and Kick Buttouski
Also nah randy cunningham was a good show and i really loved the intro as kid
Stfu cause you can say zeke and Luther is bad but it’s just drake and Josh but with a small and I mean very small reason to watch
Even with all these aids running wild, Disney XD 10000000000x better than Disney and yes watered down YouTube beats the crap out of disney
I have never heard or seen the toe getting stuck gag , thats new to me
Oh huh lol interesting
I really liked I’m in the Band and Jimmy two-shoes growing up.
"Guys, they're *ontop of the world,* did you catch that?" Bit of an odd take, by that logic Spongebobs theme should be bad too lol
When I was younger I always thought I was so cool for liking DisneyXD more than the regular Disney channel lol
You say this but smash players cling to that controller like the plague. Theres a reason it was rereleased in 2014 with an adaptor for the wii u and again in 2018 for the switch.
i have a very distinct memory of crash being given a wedgie in an episode and its revealed he wears a thong and when confronted about it his response was "my cheeks need to breathe bernstein"
God, I miss Mitchel Musso’s music career. Who’s with me?
the ls stands for lord supreme mark probably
2:59 was giving me major anxiety 💀👻😱
2 secconds of the pair of kings theme song made me remember everything
Pair of kings was the absolute best
I liked the yt era where they were experimenting with a lot of different games but they got rid of the better ones
Pickle and peanut is a worst version of cupcake and Dino which is a worst version of the regular show, so meta
is crash cannon to the muppets
The mickey show shorts was so fye
i remember one time when i was tired of watching ravens home i switched the channel to pickle and peanut and immediately clicked off after the intro
Ah, the Established Titles scam. Gives me memories.
Where’s Penn zero part time hero?
Okay so many years ago i had a dream about Crash and Burnstein. There was a picture of George Washington. Someone spilled Sprite on it. Crash burst out of it in a George washington costume screaming "milk" at the top of his lungs.  Later he set the building on fire
16:56 so this really is just miraculous for “LE #EPIC BOIZ”
you forgot Aaron Stone
I really enjoyed Pair of Kings. My favorite Disney XD show was Ultimate Spiderman.
it really is rather strange that Disney XD had such a small presence in other countries. Here in the Netherlands, after Jetix got canned, the same channel number started airing Disney XD. I was talking to some friends from elementary school and barely any of them watched the Disney Channel proper, only Disney XD.   A good third of the group present did not even know we had the actual Disney Channel somewhere. I'm kinda shocked that Disney XD was considered the 'second rate' Disney channel abroad.
these days , throw the male protagonist to the trash.
No Penn Zero?
I was that pair of kings fan and I stopped watching after the change
crash and bernstien is such a goated show, unironically
Where Was Crash And Epstein When Thanos Fought The Avengers in Infinity War?
11:11 excuse me good sir but AYO THAT MY NAME
I used to be absolutely obsessed with Randy Cunningham as a kid to the point I hand wrote an entire fanfiction in my school notebook that featured my own oc. I still stand by that show it's iconic
Established titles is a scam! Just letting you know
i remember this
When I was 9 or 10 Zeke and Luther was my favourite of these ones gone over (I thought it was a cheap knock off zack and cody, which I really liked)
I loved pair of kings growing up, it definitely fell off when Brady left though.
Dude I remember watching crash and Bernstein and I hated it but at the same time it was amazing
I wish wander over yonder ran for longer that was a good show
I just watched pickle and peanut for the first time this week and I’m loving it so far. Surprised to see so many people hate it
TERRIBLE THEME SONG?!
Dude, Randy Cunningham is was the shit as a kid. I loved it.
"replacing toon-disney" NAH IT REPLACED. JETIX, MY BELOVED 😭
Why does pickle and peanut just remind me of a worse smiling friends with worse jokes and more unfunny gags
L take
Loved Disney XD
i like c a b
As a kid,  Crash And Bernstein was in my top 10 favourite Disney XD shows,  and as an adult?  Still is.
it's really not as much of a coincidence as you think it is for two ex-disney stars to get arrested in burbank and try to start a music career.  seems like a pretty typical child star life path
I really wanted to watch Randy Cunningham so bad when it came out but due to irl circumstances i wasnt able to watch it as much as i could om tv but watched what i could through rips on YT, remember really liking the show
You get up in ireland? Me too!
Random fact: Adam Hicks raps the Mighty Med theme song
The guys arrested HAD to of known each other lmao
I mainly only watched Disney XD for Gravity Falls and Wonder Over Yonder but have a little nostalgia for Randy and remember watching a lot of Ducktales 2017.
You unlocked some fucking memories talking about that show of the island King's. I distinctly remember an episode where they had to negotiate with an underground race of mole people who had butts on their chins? Like functioning asses they did their business through??? So weird
Kid Vs. Kat
3:49 Germany title
I always liked to watch Wander Over Yonder growing up.
me and my mum used to loovvvee pickle n peanut, we still sing the outro song to eachother every once in a while
I remember Crash and Bernstein
I remember watching I'm In The Bad and really enjoying it is a kid and I also got into Lab Rats for a little while. The guy that played Donald Davenport is the same actor that talked to Spider-Man in the elevator of Spider-Man 2 when he was beginning to lose his powers. Also the guy that played the lead singer of Iron Weasel was the photographer in Spider-Man 3.
The parker plays and youtuber lets plays shows were big for me. I didn't have internet when they first aired. it was so cool getting to watch people i'd never heard of play games i'd never seen.
My brother was friends with Hutch Dano in middle/high school. Hutch was pretty narcissistic but he was kind of funny sometimes ahah. Hutch got into drugs and my brother dipped.
Advertiser is prob a scam
I will not take any pickle and peanut slander around here
Established titles lol
Yes I remember Randy Cunningham, since the Portuguese VA is the same as Peter Parker in Marvel's Spiderman PS4.
or Music Blasterz (no)
Antipixel (no)
i xd
Ok, honestly, I don’t think the theme song for Randy Cunningham or A pair of kings was that bad.
More like Disney >:3
When I was little I had a crush on Randy Cunningham 💀
Old video I know but what's funny is how the living zit episode of pickle & peanut is just the same concept of the evil zit made from the super zit destroying cream in Johnny Test. Disney ripped a whole other networks shows episode & failed utterly to replicate the same energy & magic.
Does anyone remember the show Parker plays on Disney xd?
It’s for Xtra Disney.
I USED TO LOVE CRASH ANE BERNSTEIN
I'm surprised Mark didn't mention this or people in the comments but does anyone remember Mr. Young? It was basically like Dougie Howser but instead of a young doctor it was a young teacher. I remember it being one of my favorite Disney XD shows but then again I was a kid and it probably doesn't hold up.
Man, i remember watching pair of kings, lab rats, slugtera, wonder over yonder and of course gravity falls.
Bruh as a kid zeke and luther was one of my favorites
There is also a Crash and Bernstein reference on Cartoon Network during the Mad skits. It was Rainbowdash and Bernstein. The premise was the same set up except instead of the kid getting Crash he got Rainbowdash from MLP who to be honest. Has a similar personality than Crash since she’s the epic rad pony
XD HAHA
Where tf is slugterra?
Should talk about Aaron Stone
For the love of all that is holy learn to end your sentences without an upward inflection. I'm so tired of all your sentences ending like this? Like there's a hidden question? As if you aren't really telling me but asking me?
Established titles is a complete scam, do the bare minimum before taking a sponsor and look them up on google
Crash Bersntein is the kind of show that's so cringe it goes back to being based
Sorta kinda miss the 2010's era, one day you'll be seeing your favorite actor going "bazinga ha ha" go full laughter and next day see said actor be unhinged on the news
As someone who grew watching the Jetix channel slowly dissapear into disney xd i remember worshipping Randy cunningham asking my parents to gift me a red scarf to wear 24/7 using it as a whip + shenanigans. What happened to me  💀
what was that one sitcom called abt ppl playing with bayblades or something
Yo you unlocked a core memory with Pickle and Peanut
Pickle and peanut goated
Billy dilly
I wish you would’ve talked about I’m in the Band, I feel like that show actually had some funny moments like the Geezers Rock song
20:53
I'd rather see a fight between Crash and Cousin Skeeter.
You should make a full on video about the “two more eggs” bumpers
7:30
Kirby bucket's was sorta funny sometimes yall remember that too
You should do brink or motor crossed!!
What about parker plays and odd squad?
Pickle and Peanut always made me want to take every hair off my body individually. It's on the same level of annoying as Almost Naked Animals.
Man I’m ancient   i know all of these
I used to watch all these shows and I used to love them all lol
The LS stands for little shi- I mean lovely sir... yeah...
YOOOOOO, I FUCKING *_LOVED_* CRASH & BERNSTEIN AS A KID!  ... I hardly remember the episodes, BUT STILL!
Billy Dilley is one of the most forgotten show of disney xd
Disney actors getting arrested seems pretty sus
Dude trust me you need to watch kickin it. It is amazing I loved it as a kid.
23:26 ok but unironically this is really funny
idk if u read back through these comments but i've been looking for this quote from a cartoon for years now that i just remembered that went "the way to forget is to remember" and its actually from RC9GN on the episode gossip boy
DisneyXD
I would watch all of these videos and crash was definitely a cool tv show 😂
Im 100% convinced that crash and bernstein was the inspiration for dave strider from homestuck
The XD stands for Xtreme Digital
The s means Scotland
kick buttowski was my fav cartoon when it was out at the time and same from 2009-2014 i watched it all too 💀 also i’m in the band was great and never spoken about 💀
Pickle and peanut is so funny because its so chaotic and stupid. Its just a stupid show.
if i remember correctly crash was also the host of like a prank show or whenever thanksgiving rolled around
5:27 look,it’s Fatz Geronimo,the grand pub a of the colander head movement
What's the name of the show seen at 14:46? It looks intresting
My buddy and I used to watch crash and Bernstein. Also,9th grade ninja is fuckin awesome
I was today year old when I realize that crash and bernstein is meant to sound like crash and burn and now i feel stupid
this s so funny XD
The zeke and luther slander is outragous it was a banger of a show when u r a kid
My  child hood was pickle and peanut and parker play's
Man Disney XD was my 2nd fav channel to tune into 1st place would be cartoon network sorry main XD fans but cartoon network had some beasts of a show neary every hour of every day there was a banger show to watch on. But yeah really enjoyed many shows on disney XD but as soon i was 15 was the year i started to watch way less of it as well as other kid shows, they just were not hitting the same as they once were with me really growing up and so with XD the only last thing i watched was Gravity Falls so when that ended so did me watching that channel.
Why do I feel like most of the episodes have sponsors in it
Can I just say I liked Pickle and Peanut!!!!!
pickle and peanut is post ironic a mere simpleton like you couldn't begin to conceive the excellence of p&p
You grew up in Ireland?
I watched disney xd for alot of 90s and early 2000s shows that were not available elsewhere anymore like kappa mikey and shows like that
Crash and Bernstein is the best show of all time and I believe it is so funny
2:37 That didn't age well, just like some of these disney series!
Where's mech x 4
I wish he talked about “Mech X-4”, it was basically a power rangers kind of rip off with giant robots that some kids can control if they all work together but the main character can control electricity or technology, it’s be like 7 years since I seen a episode of it
Growing up crash and burnstien was always my favorite show so I’m glad it was covered here.
LS? Lord Sidious mark?
HOW DARE YOU HATE ON PICKLE N PEANUT THAT SHOW IS SO AMAZING
I watched Crash and Bernstein when I was little, back when everything Disney used to be on Netflix. It was a good show. I remember some moments from it, like when Crash mistook his love interest’s puppeteer arm to be a hairy tail, or when Crash and the family pretended to go back in time. Sick show.
18:25 Pickle and Peanut is one of the only shows I’ve ever seen to truly understand what it’s like to be a post high school/pre college teenager. I’ve literally never seen a character as relatable as Peanut during this one era of my life.
The Pair of kings theme is a real bop that I can't get enough of. Who else wouldn't get enough of it like me? Even if we're in the adult age? There's always a kid in us. Don't forget that.
You forgot SlugTerra
23:43 IMMA LET YOU FINSH BUT DING DONG
Never did much like pickle and peanut. My cousin did, though.  But he's stupid frfr.
Any Kid vs Kat fans here? Was kinda expecting to see that show in this video heh
Crash and Burnstein was my favourite as a child
In fairness the Wii U did have GameCube controller support   Now not the wave bird like you showed but due to smash 4 there was a GameCube adapter made for the Wii U but only for smash bros   Plus the Wii had it built in with the first model due to its complete backwards compatibility though it was ripped out for the family edition (basically put it on its side) and the Wii mini (a tiny red one with no internet support you essentially got for free with the wii more and Mario kart Wii disk)
Bruh Crash and Bernstein were the only reason I clicked on this video
bro asked is skateboarding a sport
crash and Bernstein was great
I will not tolerate any XD slander it was my childhood Disney Channel was for STUPID BABY GIRLS!1!11😡😡😡
i was a hardcore pair of kings fan
Crash wouldn’t go quietly if the police caught him. He’d probably steal a police car, go on a high speed chase and be arrested after a shoot out at a Denny’s.
i only clicked this because of crash and Bernstein mainly because i had three sisters and no brothers so the show sentiment hit deep for me
I loved crash and Bernstein
I see you sneaking thps n64 music there
Okay I don’t know if any one remembers this show but does anyone Pen zero part time hero  That was an underrated one for me
i need to know where can i watch crahs and bernstein again
I only have 1 memory from pickle and peanut and im aware of how stupid this skunds but it was kinda traumatic. I was sleepung on the couch cause my sick mom was in my bed. My dad was there with me. It couldnt have been later than 3 am and the tv was still on, the episode where the store manager goes crazy at night was on and it scared the hell out of me, i was half asleep so i felt like i couldnt have woken up my dad to change the channel. That was the first ever all nighter i ever had and its still genuinely terrifying to think about all these years later. It sounds stupid but for a 5 yr old it was genuinely traumatic.
maybe my brain is just broken but ngl i laughed at the pickle and peanut intro lol
Watched this video specifically for another POV on “Kickin It” then he just glossed over it
Established titles got exposed as a scam like over a year ago and this videos only 11months old 😂
This guys accent keeps throwing me off. Like 80% of the words he says sounds like any random American and then there will be a random word with an unidentifiable accent
Pickle and peanut was the only one on this list that I forgot about
14:45 whats the show name
Damn I didn't remembered Zeke and Luther looking that cheap  also you forgor Aaron Stone, that show was like one of the big poster show when the channel started alongside Z&L
Am I the only one who remembers "I'm in the Band"?
Haven't seen anyone mention Penn Zero: Part Time Hero.
Aw man! Guess Aaron Stone didn’t make the cut
When u think about it, "miraculous" has a very similar premise as "Randy Cunningham". Except with much more drama
I was there when Jetix became DXD.
10:44 yes there are/were, first and foremost: My Mother who discovered the show and still to thus day watches it constantly. Honestly tho having seen all of it a dozen odd times i really enjoyed it. The third brother thing was awful tho
Top of the world was one of the best theme songs
Getting rid of jetix and toon Disney was a crime tbh
Please tell me what the music around 22:00 is I need it
I mostly watched Disney XD and Cartoon Network as a kid because we were too broke to afford Disney channel and nick
what the hell i have the same dresser from the girls room in crash and bernstein
I will never forget crash and burnstein!!!!!
Gravity falls is goated
Yep! Sonic, Dewey(?)i think,from duck tales,And...Wait for it... Leonardo from Rise of the tmnt! All of them basically have the same personality as well as the same voice,also interesting note Leo's a red eared slider and has red stripes on face Almost like the red stripes on Randy's ninja mask! Either odd foreshadowing or total hilarious in hindsight.and i don't know if this is canon or fanon but Sonic is Rise Leo's favorite cartoon.
As a kid, I always saw "disney xd" as the "disney for boys", so saying I liked some show of the channel was practically my way to "im not like the other girls" kinda avril lavigne style IDK
The 7D I barely see anyone talk about it
This video will probably age horribly bc of the ad…
Cliffhangers to certain animated shows are acceptable if it's not important
If cliffhangers are natural to some shows then it's fine with me but not with shows are in need of a series finale
Bro why did you talk smack about RC9GN
Lab Rats and Gravity Falls carried Disney XD
Crash & Bernstein was a very dumb show, but honestly the mindless chaos of it is what made it so much fun. Crash’s antics always made you want to tune in for more. The supporting cast was very memorable too. Wyatt was the everyman every boy could relate to. Cleo’s shtick of running an imaginary fashion company was great too. I remember having a huge crush on Amanda too.  Zeke & Luther was awesome. Seeing the two grow and their personalities clashing off each other. And Kojo. Who doesn’t love Kojo? (And Ozzie too). Everyone hates Ginger though. She was dollar-store Megan Parker without Miranda Cosgrove’s charm.
Motorcity is one of Disneys most underrated products imo, incredible art style and such a fun concept, dystopian Detroit is a great environment that has been done time after time but we hadn't really seen a unique animated take on the scene, id love to see you go back and review it.
This just reminded me of crash and bernstien now I’m gonna go watch it
I only saw ads for all of these, minus wander over yonder I did watch that. I may have caught them partially at my grandmas house, but I was more of a Cartoon Network/Nick kid.
not the established titles sponsor😭😭😭😭😭😭
Crash and Bernstein was fucking lit
I loved pickle and peanut it was my second Favorite show on disney xd
Even in a forgotten Disney XD show video, Future Worm remains forgotten… Check it out Mark… the worm beckons you
I used to watch pickle and peanut but I never really liked it I just had it on for background noise
I absolutely loved crash and Bernstein
Crash and Bernstein was my favourite show when it was on tv
Has any one heard of Camp Lake Bottom cause I remember episodes of it on YouTube and watching it
xd was extreme disney cus it had all the action shows like marvel and other cartoons that had fighting
Was randy Cunningham just miraculous ladybug before miraculous ladybug 😂😂
18:25 How could you Say That About Pickle and Peanut??!!???!???!?!??😰
I remember the day Disney XD replaced JetX it was sad day
I always thought the XD stood for extreme Disney
what's the name of the cartoon shown in 14:45?
it was my favourite channel i live in greece and there isnt CN or something this was paradise i would watch mylo murphy's law,gravity falls, phineas and ferb, spider man basicly everything
Damn pair of kings used to be so good
Fish hooks
Pair of kings was goated
hah you fell for the sponser
Lab Rats and Mighty Med both deserve a video on them, their too good and nostalgic not too  also the other cartoons you left out, being Kick Buttoski, Wander Over Yonder, Penn Zero, Etc. theres so many good shows that were on there that deserve to be preserved and remembered
i didn't have cable as a kid, only getting access to it in around 2013, when i moved in with my granny. My dad and i liked to watch Lab Rats and laugh at it, but we ended up seeing a lot of Kick Buttowski as well. they were both... good? good enough. i remember seeing one or two episodes of Pair of Kings and Crash and Bernstein, but all i got out of the collective watch time was the "crash and bern- STEIN" line from the intro of the latter. I also felt a kind of kinship with C&B since it's set in Portland, where i used to live in a town just over the border from and visited semi-frequently. their airport is pretty nice. they have a pretty cool local ice cream shop called the Salt and the Straw or something that has some experimental flavors and it's pretty cool.  Randy Cunningham, though? i always wanted to see more of it. i never got to see much at all, probably seeing only 4 or 5 episodes, half of which being reruns, but it scratched that itch that the animated Jackie Chan adventures used to back when Netflix still did physical rentals. I still never did get to see it proper, but at least i found a new show thanks to a canadian friend (i'm american) in the form of Detentionaire. actually a super cool show, and the whole thing is on YT on that same channel that has Clone High season 1
You forgot about hot wheels motor city
Pair of Kings was goated as a kid still genuinely sad they replaced the one of the main guys
Crash and Bernstein’s had the best game on their website
i honestly kind of like pickle and peanut
1) I loved Zeke and Luther.  2) pair of kings was Honestly funny to me lol, I didn’t know Micheal got arrested lol. I also didn’t know he got replaced tbh.  3) I think this show wasn’t in Canada.   4) I don’t know what the hell this show was.   5) I didn’t know what the hell this was one either lol.   Kickin it was heat. Mind you, I was only able to watch Disney shows every other weekend as a kid so maybe it was because I was barely able to watch it in the first place where I fell in love with these shows.
Say what you will, but "We Dancin' In The Mansion" is one of the best songs ever.
I used to watch all of these except pickle n peanut
I liked pickle and peanut lol
The s stands for saviour
The xd stands for xtreme disney
I’m gonna be honest and say that Crash and Bernstein is a show that I hated and still will never saw anything good about that show
Kickin it and I’m in the Band certainly deserve more recognition in my book! These shows were laugh-out loud funny and definitely deserve to be talked about more. Aaron Stone is also way underrated. Truth be told you picked a lot of obvious shows here. I don’t think this was your best video but I do think you did justice to Crash and Bernstein, it’s pretty good. You need to make another video for this topic and go over the truly forgotten shows from this channel! I still give you 3 stars out of five but that’s the best I can give you. Have a nice day. Please give Kickin it another look, it’s not as bad you make it out to be!
I cherished this channel as much as cartoon network, boomerang, and all the nick channels
I remember that some kid lied to my friend and told him that pickle and peanut was just like the amazing world of gumball. This hurt me on another level.
i loved crash as a kid and rewatching it, by god it still as awesome as ever.
The only trend Ireland ever got was every dude becoming a lets player
Walter from the Muppets rip off
I loved this channel but i remember my mom having to pay extra for it to be added to rhe channel list so she ended up just like not paying for it because we were broke. I really missed kick buttowski and pickle and peanut and shit after we left it i was sad
Does anyone here remember penn zero part time hero????
Lord (of) sadness mark
When I went to my grandmother's house some time back I sat down to watch tv for the first time in years with my younger cousins and I saw the show with let's players and I could not stop freaking laughing at the fact that they had to outsource to a whole different platform just to maintain any of the audience they have left.  What was worse was the added edits they added to the clips, not so much the censoring, or cutting down to time but the extra commentary, pausing, and cheap filters/effects over videos I'd already seen a dozen times myself. It was kind of sad and almost disheartening because I actually liked a bunch of Disney XD shows growing up, at least some of the animations, but that last ditch effort felt desperate and sad.
In case you dont want to watch full episodes at least get a taste with it and watch crash and bernstein without context videos
Disney XD was the worst thing I hated that mf. It gave boys that drink monster drinks 🫢
XD still exists.
Kick buttowski was a real one tho
You forgot another cartoon :(
I was watching some crash and bernstien out of context videos and ive gotta say i laugh more at the jokes today than i did as a kid. You can tell the puppeteer and voice actor for crash is really giving it his all.
@Ls Mark  U HAVEN'T EVEN SAID HALF OF THEM: 1 mighty med 2 boyster  3 counterfeit cat 4 future worm 5 Penn time 6 atomic puppet 7 dude that my ghost 8 walk the prank 9 the 2D I even think there is more but this are the ones that came to mind... And u mentions pickle and peanuts? People remember that show thou  10 Jimmy two shoes 11 kid vs kat
Remember Disney XD’s attempt at making their own version of MAD? If I recall it’s called Two More Eggs
Imo Disney Channel should've had all their cartoons on DC while Disney Channel shouldve moved all live-action shows to Disney XD. Cause I feel like if they moved their live action tv shows to Disney XD's then we could (and should've) had crossovers between XD new shows at the time to the shows moved over.
The fact that i remember all theese shows even tho i was like 4-5 and hated disney xd, but i would always  swipe through it to see if some shows that i loved (like my baby-sitter is a vampire) was airing. I miss it, not gonna lie
The first time I watched Coryxkenshin, it was not on YouTube, it was Player Select!
I remember some of these shows.
Pair of Kings was one of the best shows ever, until Mitchel Musso was fired and replaced by Adam Hicks, the show lost its audience and became cancelled
Look i love this video but the jokes were just terrible... no offense 😗
everyone seems to forget that disney xd was actually the first american channel to have rights to english version of naruto shippuden and since a edited version was never made like they did for OG naruto that means disney showed everything including blood, murder, and violence but disney would skip fillers too guess they didnt want to pay for them 🤣🤣
2:46 That didn't age well.
*ahem,* fish hooks.
I’ve rewatched crash and Bernstein like 3 times since I was younger and I love it everytime
My cable tv didnt have disney channel so my life was watching disney xd and cn
20:42💀
At first, I thought your avatar was part of the forgotten Disney XD shows 💀
I always thought Disney xd was for boys😂
back when the shows are good , at least I've been there
I watched kick buttoski on Disney XD as a kid along with most of the animated stuff
What is his accent? I cant pin point it??? It might be a speech impediment and if it is I’m sorry
Only reason I didn't watch Disney xd as a kid was because our cable provider charged extra for the channel. Otherwise it would've been my favorite channel when I was younger.
im in the band?
Crash no diffs goku
Randy Cunningham has a lovely rip-off of the Sailor Moon transformation sequence with the ribbons and all! Lol
crash and bernstein makes me miss being 9 years old
Ok so for the pair of kings recast i remember disney ignoring the arrest and they had a "contest" on their website for you to vote which king would be replaced and you scored these votes/points with a surfing mini game. Idk why
Pair of kings song slapped wym
Kid vs. Kat is another forgotten Disney XD show.
Randy Cunningham had such a strange allure to me as a kid. It seemed so cool but was filled with such a mixed bag of jokes. And they got a TON of huge names to voice characters? Tim Curry, Robert Englund, Jennifer Tilley
I like Pickle and Peanut for the absurdity of it. That's my kind of humor
7:14
I recall 2009 when they switched to Disney XD. It kinda broke me because I loved their Jetix block that played previously ran episodes of Power Rangers (while brand new episodes were every Saturday on ABC Kids). It was like that from 2003 to 2009. I remembered completely tuning out after they took my precious Power Rangers away lol I laugh at it now. Kinda made me stop watching the shows of my childhood all together.  The point of this long-winded comment? Personally. I'd love to see you dive into the Jetix era of Tune Disney. Because by the time they switched to DXD, it was definitely more than just Toon Disney. Ik it'd probably take time but. I'd definitely binge, given that that TV block was basically my childhood
Worst Disney show of all time, Pickle and Peanut.
you should talk about billy dilly worst show ever probably
At this point, I'm convinced LSMark had the worst music taste
I guess this means MECH X4 and Walk the Prank aren't forgotten. Cool!
I remember seeing Supa Strikas and damn the theme was fire
Agreed for the most part in regards to pickle and peanut, passed it off as another breadwinners as a kid though the girl scout cookie episode in particular had me laughing through it consistently  I gave the rest a chance but it did not live up to the hype, kudos to the writer though. Def worth checking out
Randy Cunningham 9th grade ninja is a bop and one of my favorite animated shows for my childhood and it roughly holds up for my taste
Plz make a jessie review
Damn, I watched all of these shows. Disney XD was my shit back in the day. All of them were actually fairly solid shows too.  Also, massive L, Pickle and Peanut is fire. That show is hilarious
Bro I love pickle and peanut
Crash was my childhood I am soooo glad that someone finally covered it in 10 years thank u mark
planet Sheen i understand cuz of Jimmy Newtron, but not Fanboy.
I only watched phineas and ferb at my gmas during the summer so I was under the impression they changed the opening theme song with every season (aka the lyrics “there’s 104 days of summer vacation”) So weird, the memories that just randomly resurface sometimes
that puppet bastard
i wat hed Disney XD as a kid parker plays was my favorite 🤷
Pickle and Peanut was meant for adult swim
19:18 when I first watched pickle and peanut I always thought it was a off-brand regular show so I always hated one it came on it also sucked so yeah-
Why didn't they just recast the character in Pair of Kings instead doing that convoluted plot development to write the character off?  Plenty of sitcons have done that in the past.
The sponsor aged pretty well
Crash & Bernstein had a dark joke on the last episode...
1:29 Rest in Peace, Thurston.
I'd feel like I'm the only person who still has passing thoughts about Randy Cunningham before watching this.
I never forgot these bangers
25:27 TO THE LOST MEDIA SUB REDIT
5:58 im holding a gc controller rn this guy is literally me
Disney XD was the GOAT
Wait Disney XD wasn't popular? Was I just a weirdo? Damn
The thing I remember most about Zeke and Luther is that one Halloween (?) episode episode. It was about a haunted skateboard the had a really spooky face at the bottom and was chasing the boys around, it scared the hell out of me as a child. I was anxiously checking every skateboard-sized cranny for weeks.  Also, I might be imagining this but I think they had an episode where someone was wrapped up in a carpet and (maybe??) thrown over a bridge, like there was a whole would-be murder plot going on? I think at the end of the episode it turned out nobody died after all, but that's still pretty intense for a Disney sitcom.
If Adam Hicks and Mitchell Musso do a song or album together, it better be called 'Pair Of Kings'.
2:06.   Same I’m from ireland and that was the only reason I watched Disney xd
rc9gn and mlb are the same thing  my friend and i rewatched it during 2020 and that’s when i made the connection
Yo kai watch
I loved pickle and peanut when I was little it was so silly to me 😭
OMG i remember loving all these shows! zeke and luther was my fav show on xd, and inspired me to become a skater myself. and when luther showed up as the 3rd king my mind got f*cking blown, it did strike me as od that braidy went away but i didn't really care lol. i also loved crash and burnstein because i assosiated with not having friends because im just a loser. all and all, disney xd was prob one of my fav childhood channel, tied with cartoon network. thanks for this awsome trip down memory lane Mark!
I loved Crash and Bernstein
0:21 yep. And it worked 😂 at least for me
I remember all these shows. I used to love all these, even those you didn’t talk about. I feel like I’m the only one who remembers all these shows, none of my friends do. Thank you ;~;
So good the show is sponsored by establish scam
Kickin it was slept on
Crash and Bernstein best show
I love Crash and Bernstein!!
oy mark the sponsor is a literal scam i would edit the ad out
I to this day quote Pickle and Peanut, loved that show so much
Watching this video in hopes Kid vs Kat is at least mentioned  Edit: sadge it wasn’t.
10:45 that person was me
I didnt have cable/satellite growing up, so it wasn't until today that I learned there were live action shows on XD
Damn you can here the irish
Pickle and peanut was crap
Randy Cunningham 🙃
I thought you were about to answer wat XD stands for
The three good xd shows are gravity falls okko and star vs the forces of evil
Pickle and peanut is one of my fav shows to this day💀
The sponsor of this video didn't age good at all
Disney XD was big in Brazil
i remember all the shows because i watched them all when i was an kid
Nah bro pickle & peanut is 🔥 if ur faded af
I actually loved watching Zeke and Luther and Pair of Kings and nowadays I consider to be a guilty pleasure fun.
I was a kid who loved anything basic and cool for a 2000s kid. I loved guitars, music, rock climbing. Disney XD was my icing on the cake for my basic 2000s kid arch.
When I was younger, I watched Disney XD for cartoons simply because it was right next to the other 2 channels I watched: Cartoon Network and Nick HD.
I remember watching randy cunningham ninth grade ninja, the whole time looking at the character when you were explaining him I thought to myself “he looks like he should be voice by ben schwartz” and thought it was a missed opportunity but that he was too big an actor for a disney xd show but he actually voiced him 😭😭 I doubt that i remember his voice especially since I didn’t know who ben schwartz was at the time and it was 10 yes ago, I think they just did a great job casting him lol
RC9GN shall not be slandered
I used to watch pair of kings allll the time 😭
I always thought XD meant “X-tra Disney”
KICK BUTTOWKSKI SLAAAAPED
Crash and Bernstein and Pair of Kings were among my favorite shows in that era. I think “unhinged” is a perfect descriptor of C&B and I think that’s why I enjoyed it so much. And I would love to see you talk about Kickin’ It, that was another of my favorites
OK now realizing I liked pickle and peanut the ninth grade ninja and crash because it’s just dumb
The one thing I will say about Disney XD is they had some good shows go on there, like Gravity Falls, Ducktales '17, and Star Vs. (minus the last 2 seasons). But one of the biggest things I remember about watching DXD was how they showed Naruto Shippuden on there for whatever reason for about 130 or so episodes, and censoring some things like the blood and that (but leaving in the characters dying), and at the same time that was airing, Lab Rats was also airing, and on that show was the older woman who also is the English VA for Naruto himself.  Also, I remembered when they decided to show an E3 Playstation event as it happened, and it was showing M-rated games, and they tried to censor all the cursing and other stuff on the spot. Didn't work so well  Edit: Just remembered they also got to show Pokémon as well on there, and somehow did better than Cartoon Network at advertising it/showing it at a decent time. They still show Yu-Gi-Oh! and Beyblade as well
I Like Disney XD
Zeke and Luther, crash and Bernstein I didn't watch them sooooo
It might have been slightly later and maybe not in your country but Supa Strikers was one of thee best shows on Disney XD
Ah yes watching gravity falls on Disney XD was the best time
Xd
Dude when I wold trip I'd love watching it but t when they did the scary episode I couldn't watch my t anymore I almost threw up from how fucked up it mad eme feel
zeke and luther was peak ngl
Established titles L
I actually LOVE these shows on Disney XD, I enjoy watching those shows back when I was in middle school, the likes of Zeke & Luther, Pair of Kings, and *Crash & Bernstein* and others have been ingrained into my childhood memories, to this day!!!!
Kickin it was the best! Didnt everyone watch XD?
18:22 oh cool, I didn’t know you were a Lisa the painful fan too
I forget Crash and Bernstein exists, but Crash refuses to let me forget him
nah im not taking that disrespect to the pair of kings opening, that shit's fire
22:38 ITS THE PRIME GUY!!!!1!!!!!!
Ever since i was a kid i hated the whole "lol XD so random" Type of humour in cartoons, that why i never watched shows like pickle and peanut or uncle grandpa or ttg, it felt like they were treating me like an idiot, like they were saying "we can just jangle a set of keys infront of a camara for 11 minutes and these dumb kids will love it" and im kinda sad that now adays it seems to work with young kids
Who's remember racket rabbit?
W video I just subscribe
I don't think Pickle and Peanut ever aired in Denmark, but Crash and Bernstein was the only one out of the rest of the shows which intro wasn't dubbed in danish
I never forgot about Crash and Bernstein because that stupid ugly ass puppet scared me
“‘please’ is jus not in this kid’s vocabulary right now lmao” 💀
I remember all
I remember one zeke and luthor episode that had the premise of the hangover
Kickin it was my fav
The one time I remember seeing Crash and Bernstein was when I was a kid going over to my dad's friend's house for some party. These mfs are LOADED so they had a huge indoor pool me and the other kids were in, and they had a giant TV that had cartoons running on it while we swam. I wound up floating a bit too far into the deep end and yet even while I desperately tried to keep my head above water and flailed desperately towards the shallow end, I still kept glancing up at the TV and trying to see whatever new object Crash had yeeted himself through
It's only now that I realize how much I actually watched Disney XD, legit I remember watching basically all these shows but somehow don't remember watching the channel that much
what about wander over yonder? that's a show
Nice scam, you just sponsored
Fun fact, the XD in Disney XD stands for Xtreme Digital. Still stupid, I know. I'm not defending it. But yeah, it does actually mean something.
Gravity falls was on Disney XD it's the best thing ever made
I remember trying to watch the egg episode of crash and Bernstein multiple times and every time I would get half way through it and fall asleep.
I loved Picke and Peanut... It's trash and I loved it 😂😂😂
Dude I clicked on this vid and seen an ad with emirichu
A lot of these show wierded me out or looked gross to me growing up. Also I hated rap as a kid and a lot of these had rap intros that made me change to cartoon network when some of these turned on
Bro I used to breathe everything this channel spat out
pickle and peanut kinda reminds me of Uncle Grandpa. but I remember actually laughing at Uncle Grandpa...
In 4th grade I didn’t give a shit about the show, but I thought the Pair of Kings theme song was SO COOL I even bought it on iTunes
Randy Ninja pretty dope though. I really like the angular rigged art style that look quite similar to some Canadian shows (my favourites lol), and I like its premise. I'm kinda annoyed how gigantic their hands are lol
All i remember about disney xd is phineas and ferb lmao
That Adam kid from Pair of Kings looks like Joffrey from Game of Thrones.
Do you guys remember the show Parker Plays that was on Disney XD? I made that show my personality for a while xD
Cousin skeeter would whoop crash’s @$$ lol
I remember when they aired the overwatch world league on dsney xd. That was weird.
I’m kinda sad I’m in the Band didn’t get a segment
When I'm in a taking sponsorships from scammers competition and my opponent is ls mark:
its been six months guess your dead
established titles L
6:46 not surprising that iCarly was one of them
I went to high school with one of these actors.
“whatever look what i found in your purse this morning” LMFAOOO WHY WAS THAT FUNNT
Randy Cunningham is a great part of my childhood I really like the animation and character design.
I’m in the band is so underrated 🔥
*THATS* why they changed the cast of Pair of Kings???
where i live we only got the disney channel in the early to mid 2010s and we had the disney XD shows on the regular programm. completely forgot about crash and bernstein untill now which is weird because i watched it such an absurd amount?
im sorry but pickle and peanut as stupid as it is, is one of my favorite shows unironically, i love how stupid it is and i love the specific genre of random it holds and i LOVE johnny pembertons voice
Crash ans Berstien was legendary
Why not Lord Splash Mark to represent splash dash?
The sonic adventure music is gas
What the animation from 14:45 ?
I remember pair of kings and I loved it as a kid.
Does anyone remember the short lived two more eggs show? I’ve never seen anyone talk about it but it’s still probably one of the greatest things ever.
Oh God the nostalgia
i was forced to stop watching crash and bernstein as a child due to crash's influence turning me into an absolute menace to society
HISS! HE SUPPORTS THE ESTABLISHED TIT-LES! Also, seriously, what DOES the LS stand for?
It replaced a channel called jetix where i lived and it was such a loss. Jetix aired classic 90s cartoons such as xmen and gargoyles but instead we got muppet boi. Not gonna lie though as a kid i loved zack and luther, randy cuningham and kick buttowski. Fun fact about the last one i didn't get the joke in his name till i was in high-school
Bro wdym forgotten I remember all of these... Except Pickle and Peanut
26:27 Damn, why did you have to say dat tho 🤣
im sad you didn’t mention the new beyblade burst series lol that was my childhood i didnt even know there was a beyblade series before it until i was older 😭
Crash and bernstein was the shit
LAB RATS WAS A DISNEY XD SHOW!?
So much nostalgia, my heart feels complete
Dude imagine watching zeke and luther as a kid then get robbed by luther and recognize him😂😂
Established titles is a scam stop accepting their sponsors
bro what about slug terra???
Lord Stinky Mark
anyone remember fish hooks?? i kinda digged it tbh
This was so funny why
F this channel, it was nothing but a channel to dumb cheap and lazy hopeful cash grabs. Which they obviously had a few successful ones, only bc so many of you dIsNeY enjoy your fucking stooopid. F Disney XD
jesus i love this video. Nostaliga packed 27 minutes
Walk the Plank was really cool at the time. But after I found those drive-thru pranks on YouTube, the WtP ship had sailed. Makes sense a fully funded Disney TV show couldn't beat and invisible man McDonalds prank.
Dude, when i was 7, crash and Bernstein fucking HIT. It is actually incredible. I'm surprised you didn't mention kirby buckets or walk the prank. Those are peak shit tier shows. Also kickn-it fucking rules.
Here's one I've not seen anyone mention yet: anyone remember Goalmouth? The show that was literally just two dudes (and later a woman) talking about and playing football. Looking back on it, it was really bad, but man I used to love that show
kickin it
I loved crash and Bernstein and crash was indeed the shit
Pickle and Peanut used to scare the shit out of me. I remember a really scary shopping market episode and i don't know if it was a dream or a real episode
18:29 do not diss pickle and peanut it was my favorite show like 9 years ago
Oh my God it’s Lord  SpongeBob mark
13:26 low key that actually kinda sounds good
3:48 song?
21:06
Crash and Bernstein was probably my favourite show out of all of them
Hey u copied hamination
I was around when Jetix was around before it got replaced by Disney XD. I was watching naruto before suddenly i saw some message saying something i forgot what. And suddenly it was disney shows playing. I was 6 when it happened
i will my lawyer has advised me not to finish this joke and apologize
one of my most embarrassing and darkest secret is that crash and Bernstein is unironically my favorite thing that came out of disney channel, besides the obvious ones
5:46 smash bros tho lol
crash is too powerful to be arrested
Every single one of these shows is better than The Owl House.
i remember watching all these back in the day and forgot completley about zeke and luther and pair of kings, these shows were bangers ahahah!
Established Titles; what a scam.
Established Titles is a scam
LMAAOOO😭 I love Pair of Kings😭😭
For that ninja show I was waiting for you to bring up that it looks exactly like invader zim.... I'm glad you caught that...  I've never heard of this show cause I'm a little bit older than you so I was already aging out of Disney XD by the time it was like coming on
Pickle and peanut is underrated
Kick butowski was so fire
Randy Cunningham doesn't get the respect it deserves
20:40 Damn, Bojack if he was mentally stable and had 3 personal trainers for his role in Secretariat
You forgot Disney XDs first show called Aaron Stone
This video unlocked so many memories I watched all of these so so long ago
I only know Randy Cunningman and Pickle and Peanut
Ever since i was a kid i had thought XD was short for Extreme Disney.
Don't talk crap about Pair of Kings. Thats my childhood and the theme song is just right the way it is
Imagine being sponsored by a scam
So relatable
Bro pickle and peanut is a legit good show im tired of grown men are hating on kids show
Dude I loved crash and Bernstein can’t believe I forgot about it
The.XD stands for Extreme Disney
Crash and Berstien foreshadowed my real life, I moved to Portland-Metro in Oregon and all I see is people talking to purple muppets (high on Heroine) and going to highschool (stealing from the now closed walmarts).
Pair of kings didn't deserve the hate
I didnt really realize this dude was irish until i started noticing how his words sometimes end in cursive
xd stands for xtrem dicccccccccccccccccccccccccc
I know a show that even you forgot to mention. I feel like only about 27 people know about the show. Its called "I'm in the band".
I remember one of my favorite parts of Zeke and Luther being Zekes real life name is mine, Hutch. Ive yet to meet another first name Hutch... one day 😂
pair of kings was my childhood and still is one of my favorite Disney shows
Hating Crash and Bernstein is a sin. Its a great show idc
I loved watching Crash & Bernstein as a kid. I was even surprised to find out shortly after watching those shows, that there is actually a Crash gear in roblox. There was probably some Crash & Bernstein event or something that I forgot about. That or some DisneyXD sponsor that happened.  If you equipped it in a game that allowed gears, it would just follow you around with the old roblox avatar animations (because, well, it's an old gear in general.)
Disney XD was the only I could watch, so I remember almost all of them
great video was hoping youd talk about Annedroids tho
Established Titles? Ooh, this didn't age well...
I actually didn’t mind pickle and peanut I liked how plainly stupid it is and it’s like a acid trip and a fever dream
15:58 howard = young ls mark
Maybe the XD was supposed to be like a laughing emoji.. bc I use XD a lot bc it looks like a laughing emoji, and some places like in games don't have emojis, but they could have just used a emoji
The channel that introduced me to Marvel, Avengers and Spiderman that I remember watching from 2012-2018 and came back to it in 2020 cos of the nostalgia
Motor city is underrated
Avengers earths mightiest heroes is the best disney xd show
I watched the entirety of Pair of King and Crash & Bernstein when I was younger and remember really liking them
Don’t diss pickle and peanut 🗣️
I got to see the pilot of Zeke and Luther before it aired

Zack and Cody was awesome!
Pair of Kings was one of my favorite shows as a kid but i stopped watching when Mitchell left and I had no idea what happened to him. guess it checks out it was a dui LMAO
Pickle and Peanut was my jam, the modern Internet would love it
isnt that established titel thing total bullshit?
Crash and Bernstein WAS MY FAVORITE SHOW EVER. It was so good I can’t. None of my friends watched it and for the longest time I literally felt like I was the only person who knew McKenna grace FROM this show hahahaha
I remember as a small child watching Crash and Bernstein religiously. I loved the show and a couple years later i even went searching the internet for it because of remembering just how much i liked the show, not knowing it was canceled (and not remembering the name correctly).
If you like Bertrum from Jessie do not watch Grace and Frankie
I watched crash and Bernstein
Literally my whole childhood.
I'm sad he didn't talk about The 7D, definitely an underrated one
12 year old me LOVED Crash and Bernstein. Something about it just struck the perfect chord. Even looking back at it now, I'm not laughing as much, but I'm still smiling.
Parker plays and player select was one of the new things i actually liked but Wonder over yonder, Pickle and Peanut, phineas and ferb, gamers guide, jesse, and other shows like that are legendary
You take back what you said about the Pair of Kings theme
I loved crash and Bernstein it was my childhood
I remember crash and Bernstein is the best show XD show ever
the pair of kings theme song is actually GAS and i will not be taking any slander of it
The fuck u mean pickle and peanut sucks it actully funny and its fun to watch
I absolutely LOVED Randy Cunningham ninth grade ninja in my childhood when it aired or was on the tv i would always watch it to the end lts just say it became kind of embedded in the back of my mind after that for Pickle and Peanut i mean it was decent? I guess it just wasnt that appealing to me unlike cartoon networks courage the cowardly dog
I remember a few of these shows growing up, they also had naruto shippuden
why were my fav shows the ones you didn’t talk about 😭
two slacker worker is trope not regular shows
15:10 I WILL NOT TOLERATE RC9GN SLANDER
How is that show called where a boy in a cinema catches villains in movies and stores them in a prison diary?
I thought it was Xtra Disney
Forgot how the Sun and Moon Pokemon anime aired on Disney XD
Dudu that my ghost
Bro got scammed by established titles
I genuinely liked C&B due to how much of a menace Crash was
Most of the Disney xd animated show were awesome keyword being most
Funny how i remember all of these "forgotten" shows... almost as if they're not forgotten. wow.
I liked how cheap Zeke and Luther looked😂😂being from Cali but not from LA or the Bay Area whenever they were outside it looked like it was down the street. Felt like they was dudes I'd see in school
I forgot about pickle and peanut
14:45 What cartoon is that?
I will NOT tolerate Zeke&Luther slander
Paying for a square foot piece of land that you will never own or see is a scam. It's like buying land on the moon or Mars. It's not real.
RC9GN sounds like some horrible chemical weapon used in the trenches or Afghanistan
10:46 IT WAS ME, I WAS THE HARDCORE PAIR OF KINGS FAN, I HAD NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED UNTIL RIGHT NOW OH MY GOD
Pair of kings was my favourite show as a kid and I don't know how
i loved pair of kings and i still love that theme song at 23. i was 11 and so upset mitchell musso was removed from the show for just a dui. especially since they were fine with him being Jeremy on Phineas and ferb. i also got even more upset adam hicks was brought on as i hated zeke and luther for being unfunny and stuffed down my throat by dis XD
I feel like XD is for Xtreme Disney
I loved pickle and peanut
Glad to know Mark is a Thurston fan ❤
why did you have to talk about all the bad shows also pickle and peanut had one good episode it was one with this guy called blood beard and it was edge as hell they made his   beard made of blood
Might wanna go back and remove the sponsor bit…
Apparently I’m so old I remember pickle and peanut. Why did I watch show I don’t know was it roting my brain probably but me and that I love that show
Motorcity is such a forgotten show, it didn't even make the list of Disney XD's forgotten shows...
Jetix Remember that before Disney xd
Kick buttowski was pretty cool,
I always thought the cartoon side of Disney XD was way more solid than their live action offerings
hey he forgit fishhooks
Poor TRON: Uprising is so forgotten it's not even mentioned in a compilation of forgotten shows
Anyone remember when Disney XD had Naruto Shippuden?... Ugh...
The sassy black lady nurse,  wait..  she played that character on Scrubs too.
Crash and bernstine was a mint show
When I got Disney+ for the first time I immediately searched for two shows, Mighty Med & Crash and Bernstein
22:13 when i was a kid, i thought that crash & bernstein was the dumbest show on earth but now i think it’s the best show ever made
I loved crash and Bernstein
Jimmy 2 Shoes is Hazbin Hotel for men
Kickin’ It is a classic I will not take this slander
randy cunningham was so hood growing up
You have a shitty opinion, your channel is a pile of dog shit
Zeke and Luther was great man
I absolutely loved Pair of Kings and Crash and Bernstein growing up. Re-watching them now makes me realize how annoyed my parents must have been all the time.
Pickle and Peanut sounds more like a child-friendly version of Dick Figures... but not good!
Not everybody can afford the newest game system i was still playing the ps 3 almost 2 years into the ps4 life span
I got banned off a school message board for spamming Crash and Bernstein quotes as a kid
The real og’s remembers Jetix ⚡️⚡️⚡️🔥🔥🔥🔥
If I remember correctly, that last one about the puppet isn’t all that original. There was a show on Nickelodeon in like the late 90s or early 2000s about a guy and his cousin who was a puppet. I think it had Cuba Gooding Jr.
Forgotten nah bro that my childhood right there
As a hispanic, i grew up in my homeland watching A LOT of Disney XD, almost everyone in my school watched the shows that were being showcased, and every kid couldn’t wait to see Kick Buttowski, Randy Cunningham, Kid vs Kat, Wander over Yonder, slugterra, and many other series, Disney XD has earned a spot in my heart and as one of the greatest childhood memories i could ever have.
crash and bernstein was my shit why did it become forgotten? i always watched that as a kid and never forgot the jokes from it growing into being an adult now i still make references to it.
Crash and Burnstein was great
I know Adam hicks regrets what he did but he acts like the justice system screwed him over but he threatened to shoot someone, he deserved to go to jail I'm sorry
Crash and Bernstein was great
I remember watching Disney XD exclusively. I have fond memories of it rip i guess
Mitchell's DUI was his third one, that's why they booted him
How were I'm in a Band and Mr. Young left out of this!!
I really liked Crash and Bernstein a lot as a kid, Crashes actor and delivery sells the whole thing but I loved how much of a smug asshole he was, not out of being a dick but due to ignorance
Crash and Bernstein is an overhated classic
That's what always felt wrong about disney xd for me: They we're always trying to appeal one audience more masculine, trying to fit the boys as a target, but all the shows that channel aired layed on nonsense humor, were we don't seem interesting characters growing and changing, just jokes that doesn't make any sense and the worst rap music you could ever heard. 15:06 never heard of that show, but it was pretty cool what they did here. A type of magical girl sailor moonesque transformation in a cartoon "made for boys". Wish we could seen more shows like that, expanding different types of humour and adventures that would appeal different types of boys (and girls as well).
Cartoon at 14:45?
It's sweet how you respond the artstyle to the animated shows, because I know to appreciate each artist and storyboard director for innovating in their field 🙂
I remember liking crash and Bernstein when I was young and I DO NOT remember him having sisters. I actually remember part of his character was being an only child
I REEEEEEAAAALLLLLYYYYYY hated the theme song to Zeke & Luther as a kid. Idk why.
Wait I thought it replaced Jedx? 0:19
That ad read really needs to be cut out of the video, I'm surprised its still in the video.
You should do a video on all those animated duo shows on Nickelodeon from like 2009-2014 like breadwinners, fanboy and chum chum, Sanjay and Craig, and robot and monster.
you forgot yin yang yo
22:14 It's better than two movies in particular. Those movies are ted (2012) and ted 2 (2015).
Hey, no pair of kings slander! lol
I loved pair of kings and I was disappointed in s3. If anybody wants to see mason’s actor play a way more hardcore character look up banshee.
Bruh i love disney xD 😅
Pickle n peanut is the best show
jetix was better than disney xd i miss  jetix
I think the XD part of Disney XD is supposed to be an emoji.
The most forgotten Disney XD show is definitely Kirby Buckets
I was freaking obsessed with Crash and Bernstein when I was younger!
Crash and Bernstein is as it's best when it's just Crash being a chaotic force that everyone is bothered by rather than doing the whole boys vs girls stuff.
The puppeteer for crash and Bernstein is named Tim lagasse... TIM LAGASSE. HIS NAME IS A PUN OF LEGACY I... HOW?
atp Disney Xd is mostly js reruns of Amphibia, Phineas, Gravity Falls, The Owl House, Hamster and Gretal, and The Ghost and Molly Mcgee, Big City Greens, and Ducktales. All of which have either been over for years or air on Disney Channel and js get handed to Disney XD as scraps. They’re good shows tho so not much to complain abt 🤷🏻‍♂️
23:28 this got me outta nowhere. it actually got a laugh outta me...
im a bit disappointed you didn’t include the other sitcoms you mentioned as i was quite fond of a few of them. lab rats and kickin’ it were two i watched often, and i had completely forgotten about the one about the band but i remember a key joke where the rock star used to sleep with his arm permanently up making the devil horns with his hand and i thought it was the funniest thing i had ever seen. it was a key memory in my childhood because i used to mimic it with my parents and they had no fucking idea why i did it or where it came from lmao
pickle and peanut is just such an OBVIOUS shameless attempt to clone the success of cartoon networks animated shows of the 2010s. Im surprised you didn’t compare it to the amazing world of gumball as the art style registers as almost identical to my eye. One of the few scenes you showed of the characters beatboxing is a straight up rip of adventure time, as well as the similarities to regular show you mentioned.
What I remember about Disney XD was that it marketed as the “BOY” channel. I remember people thinking that Disney channel was too girly and that’s why Disney XD was heavy on the epic, awesome, and dude bro stuff. Still watched it everything though.
Wait, Mark is allowing himself to be sponsored by Established titles? A proven scam? Damn, dude has little dignity
I definitely forgot all of these existed, but today I learned I was apparently an avid disney xd viewer
I remember one of the main selling points of kicking it was that they didn't use any stunt doubles . Or said they didn't . There was that commercial where the cast was saying " what you see is really us, doing the actions . When you see us eating falafel we're really eating falafel" followed by a close zoom on one of the kids eating falafel
lab rats and kickin' it were definitely my top 5 shows on disney XD. cant wait for you to cover it:)
Lsmark you seem to misunderstand, it’s Disney+ that messed up the order of episodes, you literally coulda just looked this up
as a kid i used to hate tv shows with real people in them, so i avoided almost all things on disney for the most part lol only watched this channel for the reruns of phineas and ferb or the fairly oddparents
Im pretty sure XD in Disney XD was supposed to be based on the text emoticon everyone was using in in game chat,text and emails back then. Basically it was meant to be an x with eyes and a big smile but  since it was a bunch of older people working at disney and they werent familar with the slang they had no idea what they were doing only that it would have targeted more boys since that was their target demographic. So basically im 99% sure they just used it because they saw a bunch of young people doing it and wanted to reach out to their audience despite them saying it doesn't mean anything.
I personally loved Disney XD. Especially shows like Zeke and Luther or Kick Buttowski
Can you do a video where you talk about the animated Disney Channel shows prior to the premiere of Phineas and Ferb? (like Kim Possible, Proud Family, etc.)
This is the first video I’ve seen of yours and before you mentioned that you grew up in Ireland I was thinking “my god this person has the most violently Canadian accent I’ve ever heard”
zeek and luther is excellent shut up
You got it wrong when you said the pair of kings song was bad
RIP Thurston, the boy was too good for this world
Y'know, as a kid, I always thought that XD was a parody of the terms SD & HD, as a way to show that Disney XD had high quality content
Yall remember kick buttowski
I loved kickin' it bro...
If you're looking for the crash and bernstein fans. Look no further. This show rocked. This song not only had the HARDEST intro theme but some banger humor and episodes. My favorite quote is "Its 4 against awesome, but awesome got a soul" TELL ME THAT THE WHOLE WRITING STUDIO AT DISNEY WAS NOT IN FLAMES AFTER THAT ONE
I thought Disney XD would be a block replacing Jetix when it was announced a few months before it launched.
Loved pair of kings
I'm sad that Aaron Stone wasn't mentioned at all in this video. That show has been truly forgotten :( I loved that show and was disappointed when they cancelled it
omg i loved crash and bernstein when i was a kid i tried to search the show on YouTube but i didn't know how to spell bernstein (also that show was kinda popular here in Malaysia)
I used to love crash and Bernstein and I’m pretty sure there was like a crash prop on roblox
Always thought the Xd stood for Xtra Disney 💀💀
am i going insane or was arron stone a real show i have a vague memory of it
Fanboy and Chum Chum is a masterpiece delivered from God him self. We are lucky our nostalgia isn't baby shark and pink sauce like kids nowadays.
Had to dislike due to the scam sponsorship.
idk man i really liked pickle and peanut. i think its random bullshitness is really fun and while kinda poorly aged, pretty entertaining.
I was obsessed with Luther waffles as a kid
Disappointed that there was no love for Mech X4, unironically the best Disney XD show
Zeke and luther was Definitely my favorite show as a kid I watched it all the time The "movie" was kind of Meh  And oh my God parakeem's I completely forgot that that show existed but now I remember watching it all the time you're bringing up so much nostalgia that show was awesome
Pickle and peanut is a masterpiece
I do love the art style of P&P
Me and my little cousin loved crash and bern and labrats. Lab rats was ass when they started to merge with mighty med and the whole world knew about them being bionic. They just changed the whole show and it was ruined
I will not stand for the pickle and peanut slander 😂
if i had a nickel for every time ben schwartz voiced a teenage ninja in a super stylized cartoon that deserved better than what the network gave them, i'd have two nickels. which isn't a lot but it's weird it's happened twice.
I remember DESPISING the show pickle and peanut as a little kid. Something about that show pissed me off so much😭
I loved pair of kings SO much 😭
Am I the only one who more than vaguely remembers Aaron Stone?
You're so right about the outdated controllers on TV. I'm a few years older than you and I remember during the PS2 Era seeing so many SNES controllers on kids sitcoms.
I grew up loving most of these shows “most” but crash and Bernstein was one of my favourite shows as a kid, something in my retro loving kid brain loved the idea of a modern muppet show (in no way am I comparing this to the muppets show just the fact the main characters are both puppets)
nothing beats im in the band
I used to LOVE Disney XD, especially Pair of Kings, Crash n Bernstein, Kickin’ It, Zeke n Luther and Lab Rats. Only live action stuff I would actually wanna see besides eastenders and Corrie. I was 9, means I saw what my parents did here and there 😂
I can’t believe Disney XD is gone. I loved it I want them to bring it back😢
Pair of kings  is great
I’m late but my personal favourite RC9GN episodes are   30 Seconds to Math, Nukid on the Block, Swampy Seconds, Shloomp! There it is and Sorcerer in Love part 1 and 2   What I love about them the most is Randy and Howard’s friendship, Howard knowing Randy’s the Ninja really adds to these episodes in my opinion, they write it so well for the short amount of time they have.  Maybe I’m biased because I had a huge hyperfixation on this show, but if you see this I’d recommend these episodes if you haven’t seen them already!
You forgot to mention Kid vs Kat here my man that one was a major DISNEY XD show
Crash and Bernstein feels like reincarnation of cousin Skeeter(does anybody remember this one?)
my christian family including extended banned all the kids from watching crash n burnstein because they saidit was inappropriate
Wonder if ls mark knows about the rule34 of himself his character version of his self has gay shit on rule34
2:31 w music taste nujabes the goat
There are tons of shows on Disney XD that go unremembered by most people. Fish Hooks and Penn Zero are two good shows that are  all but forgotten by everyone because way more popular shows aired around the same time and eclipsed their viewer base (Gravity Falls and SvtFoE respectively).
23:28
I'm surprised that when people talk about companies and brands trying to pander to younger demogrpahics despite being out of touch they never mention that Disney made a channel literally called 'DIsney XD'
I used to really like Disney XD, during those years from the late 2000s to mid 2010s I was mostly a youtube and video game kid but whenever I did turn the TV on it was probably Disney XD
Fun fact- the song in the credits of phineas and ferb across the 2nd dimension was supposed to be the theme song for pair of kings, but Disney was like “no we want a bad theme song”
The disrespect to Kickin’ It tho
Zeke and Luther, Pair of Kings, and Randy Cunningham were shows I adored. I rarely recorded shows as a kid but those three were all included lmao
18:05 BEN SCHWARTZ?! I LOVE BEN SCHWARTZ! I HAD NO IDEA! I wouldve watch the show just because he was in it.
I also stopped watching Pair of Kings once Musso was gone. But tbf I also stopped watching all of Disney XD by that time
I think the time the third brother was introduced was when I stopped watching Pair of Kings.
I’ve been binging your stuff and I’m loving all the Tekken music you use!
Crash can say the n-word
I my have only been on Disney Channel but what about Kid vs Cat
Haha you said jeel 😂
Haha you said jeel 😂
Zeke and Luther was a great show
Hmm most of these aired on normal Disney Channel where im at
RC9GN is one of those shows that I think had a lot of potential in terms of concept and the passion of the artistic team working behind it. I mean it's basically every "teen is secretly a superhero and can't tell friends" TV show that have always been popular (miraculous ladybug, Ben 10, Jake Long, Danny Phantom, etc.) I think with slightly better writing and more plot-progression overall with less 'monster-of-the-week' type episodes it could have been really great.
Bruh, the moment you mentioned the villain from Planet Sheen a wave of repressed memories came rushing forward. I ALSO have no idea why i watched that show. I think even as I watched the episodes I knew it was hot garbage but I didn't have a phone and wasn't allowed to watch YouTube so TV was all I had to pass the time and I just ... kept watching even if the show sucked. Glad to see someone else can relate.
i remember not being happy as a kid when they replaced Mitchell Musso in Pair of Kings. I think I did watch some episodes following that but definitely not as many and I don't think I enjoyed it as much. I genuinely had no idea he was written out because he got arrested though, omg. I just thought he didn't want to be a disney star anymore or something.
18:20 nobody. the sound my grandpa makes after taking a a whiff of my extra spicy taco-bell
Every time I think about Disney XD being not so great I remind myself that GRAVITY FALLS WAS A DISNEY XD SHOW.
Zeke and luther went hard
These shows are never forgotten
MIGHTY MED WAS SO BASED
Pair of Kings theme song is fire wtf you on about LS Mark lol
Established Titles is a scam. Do your research before you accept a sponsor.
Nah pickle and peanut was fucking amazing. I watched that shit every single night
23:53 I always thought about that in 2012 that Crash was literally Walter but purple😂
Pair of kings was amazing I wish they didn’t re cast him
Lol Crash and Bernstein is definitely just a weird white version of Cousin Skeeter
While I never watched Pickle & Penuts you can't tell me that it wouldn't have done much better on Adult Network there were so many shows with that half realistic/cartoon art style over there that or like MTV... Not saying it would have saved it or made it any better but that just by looking at it doesn't scream Disney imo
Zeke & Luther, Crash & Bernstein, Kickin It, I'm in the Band, Pair of Kings, Lab Rats, Lab Rats Elite Force were the only shows I watched on XD & I liked all of them
For some ungodly reason, I remember the intro to Crash and Bernstein. I don't remember actually watching it, just the intro song.
Lab rats and mighty med we're my childhoods so happy they're both on Disney xd
I loved crash and Bernstein. I wasn’t a fan of the opening theme, but the rest of the show was just the perfect amount of crazy.
Fun fact. Here in the netherlands most kids just had DisneyXD, and no disney channel. The most popular channels were Nickelodeon and Fox kids (which became jetix) and jetix became DisneyXD
Aaaaah I just finished rewatching Randy Cunningham and I miss it SO MUCH, I remember when it shifted to air at 5.30am I would wake up 5.25am on work days in 5th grade just to watch ONE episode  It was WORTH it from what I remember, when I got Disney+ at first, THE FIRST THING I started watching was RC9GN
I liked randys voice in Spanish
I Unironically liked crash and Bernstein
Brady from pair of kings looks exactly like one of my friends
Mighty Med was actually a really good show. not even kidding one of the best XD shows up with Wander over Yonder
Was avid Disney XD watcher and had the exact same opinion on Pair of Kings as you, Brady was infact my favorite character.
I find it funny that  the last year's of toon Disney  the jetix age  it would  play  beyblade
All i remember from zeke and Luther is that the guy who played cookie on Ned's declassified was in it
Funny enough when it started  it played  fresh prince of bel air and one time believe it or not  naruto shippuden
"Look what I found in your purse this morning."  Why was that so funny? Like seriously, why did that of all things make me laugh?!
Its a scam
I loved lab rats lol
Mark get out of the jokes before you become a idiot
Toon disney and Jetix >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Disney XD
You forgot a show Yokai Watch
no one remembers pen zero part time hero or kid vs cat
Remember watching Crash. Genuinely loved it.
I didn't forget about any of these shows. I was just never a fan of live action sitcom shows as a kid or a teen. But later as an adult I started to enjoy sitcoms
I really liked Crash & Bernstein
You forgot: Parker plays, and Polaris prime time
XD is literally the LOL emoticon 😅
Idk man pickle and peanut used to go so hard for me
I loved crash and Bernstein
I also stopped watching Pair of Kings after Brady was removed, I really like his character when I was young for some reason. Probably because he liked the cute girl (don’t remember her name).
Great video but, it’s not shiny..
Crash and Bernstein was my childhood and nobody else can relate🥲
I miss being a kid!
Get on with it bro
If pickle and peanut was a adult show I feel like it could be a lot funnier
Randy Cunningham 9th grade ninja was my favorite show
What show is at 14:45?
I don't know what made you  think these shows were forgotten there are millions of life long fans out there 😂
Disney XD have marked a then and now in children's childhood for Latin America. (Shout-out from Argentina)
One thing I'm not happy with Disney XD was Pokémon! But I got over it!
Grew up watching Zeke and Luther really liked it
Hey man the Randy Cunningham intro was fire 😭
Disney xd is actually still pretty popular in the netherlands but in the Netherlands disney channel is basically only the life action shows and more girl centric shows and disney xd also has shows like ducktales and amphibia which are on disney channel in america
Lab Rats was good until the last season... thats also true for Lair of Kings. Kick'n It was super good too, wayy too funny.
Anyone want to talk about freaking awesome Aaron Stone was?! I always thought besides A Pair of Kings (that won awards) would be top 5 from XD
Crash and Bernstein was my one of my favorite childhood shows as a kid I remember, i always wonder if they were gonna make another season but sadly they didn’t, good times back then
Randy Cunningham left a mark on my mind with that banger opening
15:05 “god awful theme song” dang first pair of kings and now peak randy cunnihan this guy has god awful taste
11:00 terrible theme song?! That was the best part of the show I loved to hear the theme everytime an episode aired
To me the randy op is still fire
Pickle and Peanut is actually a very deep and tragic tale about two young men slowly killing themselves because of their LSD addiction, causing them to be further distant from their friends, whom they now see as whimsical creatures due to how frequently they take the drug. You just wouldn’t understand.
Like Zeke and Luther, Lab Rats, Mighty Med Kickin' It, Crash and Bernstein, Pair of Kings, Walk the Prank, Mech X-4, Gamer's Guide To Pretty Much Everything and Villians of Valley View!
But Disney XD was never said to be exclusively cartoons, that was when it was Toon Disney, but Disney XD was a concept of following the action/ adventure side of Disney.
Basically any live shows.
I remember all of the Disney XD Shows
I have one that no one talked about Disney 11
Good video but I wouldn’t say nobody ever watched it, when it was in its peak everybody I knew watched it
I still have fond, albeit kind of vague, memories of Pair of Kings. I remember watching like every episode during the summer, door closed, AC on full blast, and playing with Legos. I think I liked it because it felt like it had lore. I also stopped watching when they switched Brady out. I didn't know what happened, but it felt cheap. They left the ever important question of Brady's love interest...well, maybe answered, but unsatisfactorily so. The theme song stuck with me for some reason. I do also second the Hicks-Musso Collab album. Make the saga come full circle!
I went to a audition for crash and i didn’t get it :(
I remember watching all of these holy
What about Kirby buckets
“The 2010’s is like the 90’s 2 but with more of the word epic” makes a lot of sense ngl
Never finished pair of kings after the change happened. Refused to watch the rest.
But wait does anyone remember CN real along with toon Disney and fox kids tho?
I remember being upset whenever a cool looking show would air on Disney XD instead of the disney channel.   It's nice that years later I could watch certain shows on youtube like Yin Yang Yo and Kick Buttowski. I started to watch Randy Cunningham too but I think got bored with it.
Pair of kings and crash and Bernstein are so goated
That ad didn’t age well lol
disney xd was too fire
Dang, want to watch some of these again
Man, Disney XD was my childhood. I remember watching Phineas And Ferb a lot on that channel.
As a pair of kings Stan, I stopped watching
How dare you bash the absolute banger that is the pair of kings theme song.
What about Two More Eggs and Kirby Buckets?
I loved crash and Bernstein
i love pickle and peanut i cant even describe why it’s just so fun for no reason
As a Latino, watching Disney XD was the best part of the day, i was in love with the show I’m in the band and even when they move it to 1:00AM I’d still stay late just to watch it, so many memories   Ps: I’m surprise a lot of Americans hate it for one reason or another, I hope Disney plus will add those shows in the future
I’m not the only one who remembers Aaron Stone, right??
The only show I didn’t know was pickle and peanut. And all I remember from rc9gn was ninja with red aura and red head friend… I could not tell you anything else about this show
Bruh I can’t be the only that liked pickle and peanut when I was a kid
I always thought XD was Xtreme Disney
Hey what is with I'm in the Band In EU Trip's Rockbsnd with Iron Wiesel. This was the best show ever on TV. And i will see it again on Disney+
Disney XD worked on me, I was definitely a Disney XD kid. I was also a hardcore pair of kings fan, one of my favorite show as a kid. I hated the change of Brady in the show and never finished it
I grew up with randy cunningham, i remember saving every single episode. I also remember crash and bernstein as something super cool that i couldn’t watch that much
No way i grew up with some of these shows
I literally grew up on Disney XD
What about fish hooks.
It was amazing for EU seeing american culture  It was Golden age   Perfect for my childhood and kid my age  Were you like 15 when it aired? Everybody says Zeke and Luther is 10/10  How are you so critical??? After than time what even was good?  Also only shows you liked I didn't I totally dont agree with your teakes and I'm annoyed I didnt watch superhero movies since Spiderman 3 or just nearly never movies  Also nobody heard about that pickle and Nut, maby it didn't air in EU?  Not sure you you know but We had Jetinx that was replaced by Disney xD Pretty sure We didn't have Americal stuff before cose my parents can only reference local polish Cartoons made with plushies or that substance you can modulate to any shape frame by frame So the difference was insane
Kick buttawski and Crash
Ive actually seen everything you mentioned back in the day and almost all of them from start too finish
nice ad.
nice scam of a sponsor
zeke and luther is a masterpiece
I want to rewatch zeke and Luther but it’s not on Disney
Where’s the one where the kid is a teacher
No shot he said pickle and peanut sucked. Buutt anyway this brought back amazing memories
Great another Irish YouTuber to add to my endless collection of Irish YouTubers I’m subscribed to
Zeke an Luther was one I’d forgotten the name of but not the characters.
What about Slugtera
Noooo, established titles got to everyone, dang
I LOVED RANDY CUNNINGHAM
Dude! Pair of kings is TOP TIER. Everyone should check it out.
Any update on commando crash?
Don't you slander crash and bernstein
It is fucking hilarious to me that I am in the exact same boat as Mark with the Pair of Kings triplet switch that shit was my introduction to disappointment as a child.
Thinking about Tron Legacy, an unironically fantastic animated series that basically got shafted by the channel. Definitely worth a watch, likely the best thing that channel ever produced.  I also remember that after a while they rebranded the Disney Channel to double down on the tween girl demographic which meant that shows like Phineas and Ferb and Gravity Falls which started their run on DC were actually moved to XD for the latter part of their run. It was odd.
Crash is just watered down deadpool tbh
zeke and luther was  the best
Im In The Band was the best one for me, when it ended it got me so sad. Wished it got at least 4 seasons.
I  remember crash and Bernstein not much tho I think I saw 3 episode of it
I watched all of these Shows, but... Not the Entire Series of each one of the Series tho. Lol. 🙃
Gonna be real I actually really like pickle and peanut. That mixed media artstyle scratches a certain itch in my brain and i thought the complete randomness was funny. To be fair I remember hating it as a kid when I first saw it, but it grew on me. 100% nostalgia talking.
I remember watching Kirby buckets and just recently I’ve noticed unless you look for the show no one remembers the show ever exsisted even though it was a pretty good show with a nice blend with 2d and live action
Ok wait… you made a video on forgotten XD shows, but didn’t cover wonder over Yonder!?!?!
Reminds me of CN real, a live action channel to cartoon network. Which of course also failed.
does anyone know what song plays during the title card for zeke and luther?
So they replaced a guy who was arrested for a DUI with an  actor who was arrested for armed robbery? Something is wrong here....
The Disney XD vanished off my kids channel on disney so i can watch mech-X4 and Jessie vanished off my kids channel on disney too :(
crash and bernstein is still my favorite disney XD show i remember watching it when i was younger and i still make references of it with my family, i should probably rewatch it to see if i still like it but it holds a special place in my heart
I remember the really buff guy from Pair of Kings came to my elementary school and talked to some classes. I was so mad he didn't speak to my class😂
The kid who play Bernstein also plays young king pin in daredevil
I loved crash and Bernstein
Ngl i mainly watched Disney XD for Ultimate Spider-Man, Kick Buttowski and Randy Cunningham. That's all i could remember, there's probably more tho that i watched Disney XD for
Calling the RC9GN opening anything but "bruce" is heresy 💀
I will say, Crash & Bernstein was unironically one of my favorite shows from my childhood along with stuff like Generator Rex, Ben 10, Max Steel, & Ninjago. It has a very nice sense of humor but doesn’t go too overboard to make it feel dumb like Pickle & Peanut which I watched a single episode of & notes that it was too dumb, even for my strange middle school taste in shows. I also really liked Pair of Kings, Randy Cunningham, Lab Rats, Mighty Med, & Kick Buttowski but Crash & Bernstein was peak entertainment for me & still remains one of my favorite shows of all time.
I feel offended by what you said about my fav shows as a kid but I like the video style so I am subscribing
LORD. SQUIRE. MARK 😮😮😮
so many of these shows has a special place in my heart i would legit switch between xd nick and cn i’m so glad i had so many different shows that were amazing
bro you need to review the American dragon jake long
Pickle and peanut is like if twomad made a cartoon
I am personally offended that he forgot Parker plays
I still sing the crash and Bernstein theme song but I don’t rmemeber anything of the actual show
I still sing the crash and Bernstein theme song but I don’t rmemeber anything of the actual show
I fuckin loved crash and bernstien it was so fuckin unhinged im gonna rewatch it
Zeke & Luther, Pair of Kings, Crash & Bernstein, Lab Rats, Randy Cunningham, Phineas & Ferb, Pokemon, Kick Buttowski, Kid vs Cat, Gravity Falls, Slugterra etc. My childhood man. Take me back!
Zeke and Luthor is the worst version of Drake and Josh  They both have controversies
FUCK I REMEMBER ALMOST ALL OF THESE AAAAAAAAAAAA
I have a soft spot for lab rats I have no idea why but it was good to me and also kick from that Disney show
I swear no one remebers "right now kapow" honestly remembering it feels like a fever dream to me and the fact that I've seen no one talk about it ever since it canceled makes me think I'm going crazy
disney xd was my childhood
12:26 not gunna lie this shit actually had me laughing.
Lloyd from the space?
What a shitty channel
pickle and peanut feels like a ytp on tv
Zeke and Luther was my shit back in the day
An other forgotten disney XD show was goody 2 shoes or something like that
you forgot kickin it and lab rats
I named my elf on a shelf after crash when I was 5
have you watched slugterra tho because that was peak
Delete that scam of sponsor
I genuinely gained some nostalgia watching this video
Crash and Bernstein was one of the best shows ever on XD
From what I believe, Disney XD merged the content of Toon Disney, JETIX and then newly created teen shows/animations
was this video pre people discovering established titles was a scam
I’m surprised you didn’t mention Kyle Massey and his exploits with the law
Its funny as a kid I actually unironically enjoyed Crash and Bernstein... Im 20 now.
Damn, I completely forgot about sticking my toes in the tub faucet and watching the thing on it go up and down
Disney XD was the shit dude
I was actually a hardcore fan of pair of kings because I remember Disney XD being the only kids channel I had when I was 5 and yes I was hyped asf when I found out the fish was gonna be a human
Idk if the show was Disney xd, but I remember some weird show about three kids who attempted to drill a hole to the center of the earth, but got stuck like half way through and were stuck in a massive hols. Does anyone remember the name of the show as I'm genuinely intrigued as I have never seen anyone talk about it. It was super short and a total flop, which explains why it is so unheard of.
10:46 i was indeed one of those fans i also loved crash and bernsiten
Wait wtf I didn't know that's why Mitchell left the show
Why does Adam hicks look younger now than he did before lmfao
Why does Adam hicks look younger now than he did before lmfao
Don’t work with established titles lmfao
holy sHIT I FORGOT ABOUT ROIDED CRASH
I love in love with pair of kings and after Brody left I stopped watching because little me had the fattest crush on him.
i absolutely loved crash and bernstein and watched all these shows were great. Disney XD was the greatest thing ever growing up.
Listen buddy you lost me when you slandered the pair of kings theme song that slaps and you know it
Also you forgot another called kid Vs Kat! It was a decent animated show that I watches when I was a kid
God pair of kings was my childhood
Stfu pickle and peanut is gangsta
ahhhhh the scammy sponsor ruined the video for me it’s not a legal title ffs
Why was “white boy who likes to rap” such a prevalent character trope 😭💀💀
I remember DisneyXD replacing Jetix here in Holland and since Jetix was one of the main children's channels, we all just started watching this instead. In contrast, Disney Channel was just some deepcut channel we didn't really watch.  For the longest time I didn't know DisneyXD wasn't actually the main channel tbh
Ngl crash and Bernstein gave me a nightmare or traumatize idk why
Super robot money them hyper force go and I’m in the band are some of my favorites
Bro this dude just unlocked a memory. I forgot about pair of kings
Thats Disney SuxD
My man from what I have gotten from other YouTubers, established titles is mound of a scam
I always thought Disney Xd was aimed for teens when I was younger
Idk why but I loved Crash and Bernstein as a child I still enjoy it to this day
i loved crash and bernstein when i was younger
This sponsorship didnt age well HAHAH
I actually remember hating Crash and Bernstein as a kid because I’d written a sitcom pilot that I’d sent to Disney with literally the exact same premise about a month or so before the show had debuted. I was so convinced that they ripped me off lol. Never ended up watching the show to find out, tho
Crash now makes money under his new name Randy Feltface
zeke and luther hate will not be tolorated top 10 xd shows
Pickle and peanut would have been better as and adult swim show with darker humor
I actually enjoyed only 3 of the shows he mentioned because now a days it just plays re-runs
make a video on teen nick! or toonnick
I liked Aaron Stone! Nowadays XD is used as a place for them to air the toy focused animes and other such series like Yokai Watch, Inuzuma 11, Beyblade whatever its called  now, Pokemon, and Yugioh SEVENS.
To put it simply Crash and Bernstein is a PG-13 version of Ted
i watched every single one of these shows
i f*cking love crash and berstein
My only memory of crash and breinstien was I went to England for a holiday and I saw them taking photos with the puppet on a bridge near the London eye lol.
Established titles is a scam
Sonic song In the background is fire. 🔥
Part 2?
Dam makes me feel old
What’s established titles? A scam where you buy a piece of paper to save trees 😐
Wander Over Yonder deserved better
I can’t wait to see crash revitalize his career with music
People re found 9th grade ninja actually, a few months ago I started seeing new videos clipping bits and pieces of the show that people liked.
I loved crash and berenstein so much, and I was so hype when they did the special where crash got a nose. My friend and I had the theme song memorized. top tier show.
I forgot how chaotic the funny purple muppet was
We must take the Reddit to find this crash and Bernstein lost media. If it is on the Internet if it is anywhere in the world or read, it will find it. It is the only thing we are good for finding useless shit.
So back in 2019 I had a brain tumor and when I was in the hospital, they had that YouTube or a short show and I’m gonna tell you this. I’ve had a tooth pulled out of my head while I was awake. It is painful as you think stitches put in my head wall again awake and pulled out again awake I’ve woken up a couple hours after surgery having to lay completely flat because well my blood needs to start flowing again, and even with all that the worst part of my experience was the lack of shows none if it was good I got that YouTube shorts show that fucking show about a girl who goes into a frog dimension and a bunch of adult shit which is ironic because I was in the kids ward trust me those doctors and nurses were shocked for reference I am 6 foot two and 235 pounds in the kids world wonder slowly came in stopped at the end of my bed, looked at my feet and slowly move her head up because I was 16 I technically couldn’t be in the adult ward
Does anyone remember The Problem Solvers and Secret Mountain Fort Awesome? Me and my friend would always put them on and laugh at how stupid and awful we thought they were. Were those Disney XD or cartoon network? I think theyre definitely worth a video themselves
No one ever gets my Turkey Jerky references
I never noticed how consistently bad Disney XD shows intros were (except for Kick Buttowski, Wander Over Yonder and Crash & Berstein)
Oh no established titles
“What’s established titles?” A scam
You should talk about Billy Dilley's Super-Duper Subterranean Summer if you make a part 2.
Disney xd Disney xtreme Disney
Uh uhm… I loved Pair of Kings and I still listen to the intro song till this day. I was extremely sad when it just stopped
Disney XD is still a thing. It's just full of cartoons now. And the lack of live action shows makes me wanna just stay on Disney Channel
“sometimes i drink… sometimes i think” 🕺🕺🕺🕺
I really liked Crash and Bernstein as a kid, it was my favorite show right behind Lab Rats and Kick Buttowski.  Ah... To be 12 years old again.
Randy Cunningham was a goated TV show and nobody can tell me otherwise, but I literally cringed at Pickle and Peanut even when I was a kid. Easily one of the worst cartoons ever made.
randy cunningham better not be forgotten it is my favorite show to this day
Does anyone remember yokai watch or walk the prank? They were my third and second favorite Disney XD shows followed by phineas and ferb.
RANDY CUNNINGHAM, PAIR OF KINGS, AND CRASH AND BERNSTINE ARE FIREE
I really liked Disney XD. But 8 year old me was ofcourse easier to entertain. Still I really liked Pair of Kings.
Brau I remember back when I did have cable tv was living on pickle 🥒🥜 and peanut now today tv I is just whatever I want 😓
Pickle and Peanut was the shit back in the day
I thought established titles was debunked as a scam a while ago
I loved watching slugterra on Disney xd though I have to admit it's art style is really bad
Also 9th grade ninja opening is fire, fuck you. It’s literally just beastie boys.
Personally I really loved 9th grade ninja, why? Idk
I always thought XD meant extra Disney
What if Disney xd was made because of 3 or 4 shows that Disney wanted but couldn't fit into their regular line up, so they made a whole channel before realizing those 4 shows weren't enough to run the whole day lmao
Is it wrong to have just noticed how many cast members that are shared between zeke and luther and pair of kings I never really watched see and luther and I used some of the other xd shows as filler to watch something till a more interesting show came on that wasn't preschool soap opera or crime drama
I don't know what it is about Disney XD Sitcoms in the 2010s, but I've always found them to be strangely relaxing to watch, to the point where they've helped me get through having depression. They're all such "turn-your-brain-off" type shows that require no thought or interpretation to be enjoyed. The writing is just good enough to be amusing but mid enough not elicit any stronge emotions, plots are predictable and not gripping enough to be stressful, and they're usually just straight up goofy and (as my mom likes to put it) dorky most of the time. They almost feel like shows that a middle schooler would imagine out of boredom, and it brings me back to simpler times of childhood before the weight of the world started to get so overbearing.
Why did u used the German logo fro zeke and Luther? 😭
I remember the first ever show on XD, aron stone
Anyone remember Star Wars Rebels? That was a rather good show…
I swear if " Zeen on Z 3 " isn't on here then you fucked up..
Considering Burbank is literally just over the hill from Hollywood it makes sense that both of the incidents happened in Burbank right by the Studio's where they'd be living
I remember phineas and ferb airing on Disney XD
I think some of these shows are better forgotten
Established titles I'm not spending a billion dollars for a glorified painting
Crash and bernstein was THE SHIT growing up
Pickle and peanut slaps sometime
When I saw that change episode in pair of kings I thought it was crazy and genius ( I was probably like 8 or something btw
kick buttowski will forever go down as the greatest show disney XD ever released
penn zero part time hero used to be my favorite show that no one seemed to care about
I stopped watching Disney XD when I was 9 or 10 because at that time Disney XD in my Country only showed Star Wars Rebels, which I hated and still hate,
No way bro just said the pair of kings theme song was terrible
Burbank is a city outside of LA that all celebrities live. It’s not surprising they both happened in Burbank lmao
I loved most disney xd shows they were actually good
I have a memory in which I was in 2nd grade and told one of my friends that I saw pickle and peanut on Disney xd the other day, she then told me that it was a really inappropriate cartoon for adults and that I shouldn't watch it. I just glared at her
I only had Disney xd growing up and zeke and Luther was one of my favorite show growing up🥲
Don’t ever talk shit about zeke and Luther. I almost had to unsubscribe.
Zeke and Luther felt like Disney's attempt at Ed Edd n Eddy mashed up with Tony hawk to capitalize on the video game series for skateboarding
Disny XD was my childhood; I watched it more than the regular channel
… it wasn’t shiny…
I loved pair kings and I was pressed when they replaced Mitchell Musso and also refused to watch it
Disney XD when it was a baby channel showed reruns of Jackie Chan Adventures and X-Men Evolution. Hey why don't you talk about Aaron Stone? 🤣
9:08 they could be fraternal twins in a mixed marriage
I really loved pair off kings
I didn't realize this was an older video and the sponsor jumpscared me
Really enjoyed pair of kings even after the change
24:11 why is bro wearing an Epstein hat 😭😭
it was extra dimension. That's why the kids are always jumping through portals that are the XD logo.
The ad for this aged like fine milk
Crash and burn was peak
Yea I definitely remember like Pair of Kings more the that Skateboard one
Thought XD was eXtra Disney
all i know that disney xd is still popular in poland
I didn't tune in because it cost a lot more money to have xd with disney, also why tf is there an established titles ad in this video? This video was posted after they were exposed as frauds
I watched them all hahaha. Its pretty shocking but my parents wasnt really there and cartoons raised me. I loved all of this cartoons.
I know RCH9GN is really bad but like, I love it. It’s so bad but I love it. 😭 I’m just glad other people actually know it exists 😭
Don't promote scams, Mark
At some point after watching Cubo & PBS living in a poor neighborhood veing african american and all the stuff (Wild Krats mostly and He Man at 2 A.M Jane and the Dragon etc....) we got on demand and terrible wifi and I remember binge watching 2 shows specifically Dragon Ball Z Kai which I had seen anime before but this made me a weeb full throttle. Then there was pair of kings and I didn't even understand what what a sitcom was I had saw Suite Life and stuff at my Nana's house but PAIR OF KINGS MAN I loved that show theme and all fucking amazing
The disrespect to kickin it made my heart shatter 😢
You forgot Aaron Stone, everyone did
Remember dxd had naruto 😂
Ngl the c&b intro is pretty decent
Randy cunningham was pretty good
Beware the dangers of established titles bc after I found out my step mom got one of those for my dad and so he is now a lord, any time I had to ask him a question and he was in his room I would knock on the door yelling "me lord?" is a lowly peasant voice or if I knew he was just watching tv in bed i would run into his room and scream "for you me lord" and throw a cheese stick at him XD
title established?????
Wander Over Yonder is REALLY underrated. It still holds up to this day, tbh. Shame it got cancelled.
I'd forgotten crash, I remember watching that!
You forgot a show called Kirby buckets who likes to draw shit or something I can't remember but the va for Naruto is in that show I think
After Pickle and Penut it all went downhill  Or at least that’s how I remember it
Like half these shows were super popular when they aired then just died out right after
Oh thank god I didn't hallucinate this channel
Disney XD was a direct downgrade to Toon Disney
I got the doofenschmirtz reference at the begining
Pour one out for Wander Over Yonder.
Zeke and Luther was just stupid, the name itself was horrible
i wasn't allowed to watch youtube so that show they would air that was literally just clips of gaming youtubers made my day lmao,, one time i actually managed to secretly get my sister's old laptop and watched jacksepticeye for the first time without censorship and i felt like i was doing something illegal
there’s an episode of Pickle and Peanut where there’s this poorly animated snowball fight and when me and my brother first saw it it was the funniest shit ever. we laughed at that snowball fight for hours. and I love the animation, although nowadays I’d say the shows not that great
I had a legit obsession with randy Cunningham 9th Grade Ninja like I was rabid over Julian
Mark shilling esablished scam
Ok After this vidéo i watch pickel and peanuts and 1 i think i'ts australien humour,and 2 did you watch thé show breadbraker i'ts thé same whith to duck thé same Bad joke ...but i love thé art style of pickel and peanuts ...
Disneyxd..for me i'm french but When I heard the X.D I thought of extreme sports, wasn't that the marketing goal?
Skateboarding is more than a sport it's a lifestyle
Is skating a sport I'm so mad at you ls mark
Doesnt LS stand for LightSpeed?
I was one of those hardcore pair of kings fans, for some fucking reason
Wtf I was raised on that channel
6:40 I'm surprised it's happened so many times in other shows and this video is the first time I've ever heard of that gag.
I actually remember enjoying Zeke and Luther a lot, it was my first guilty pleasure of a show, I enjoyed seeing just how ridiculous the episodes would get, and the sorta "vlog" style segments felt oddly fresh, not *good* but a good change of pace from what I'd seen before.
hoylfuck the girl on pair of kings WAS HAWT AF  ! :O
As a kid I was never able to put my finger on why I watched Crash and Bernstein. I think maybe I thought it was parodying the "rad awesome dude bro" stuff that was popular around that time
Rebel taxi music
Clicked the video because I couldn't believe that someone would remember pair of kings. I also hated the actor change
Was gonna watch but you never took the scam sponsorship out so deuces
kick buttowski??? wowwwwwwww
I wish I could have forgotten Pickle and Peanut, omg. I hated that show when I was younger
Disney stars and getting arrested come hand in hand
11:00 "Especially given the terrible theme song" THAT SONG IS A MASTERPIECE AND IT LIVES IN MY HEAD RENT FREE HOW DARE YOU😭😭  Also, I remember watching all of these shows but only cuz it was the only channel that would air episodes in Spanish (I live in a Spanish speaking country) for some reason the actual Disney Channel would air stuff in Spanish despite the episode clearly saying it was (must have been a cable company issue)
Kickin it was my shit back in the day
I'm unironically sad that Kick Buttowski wasn't discussed in-depth and Wander Over Yonder wasn't actually mentioned in this video 💀
I'm ngl 20:49 was funny asf
thank you for making this video mark. too many of thee youtubers grew up with the disney channel or nickelodeon so it's great to see you're going over some of my childhood shows i used to watch as a kid on disney xd. and yes me and my sister had the same experience with pair of kings and kind of just lost interest when the luther guy from zeke and luther replaced the other dude
I remember Disney xd did this stupid thing where the channel wouldn’t air anything from midnight till 6am problem is where I’m from I have to go to school at 630 so I would wake up at 5am to watch cartoons and get ready but I couldn’t watch Disney xd before I went so I just defaulted to Cartoon Network all though I did watch Aton of Phineas and Ferb and that 9th grade ninja show but my favorite was gravity falls they only aired the show there so i would set a timer for when the show would air on my receivers timer when  it was still on air the channel is still alive tho where I live mostly airing Phineas and Ferb and lab rats buts that’s about it
I got bored and watched pickle and peanut cause what could go wrong and I found myself laughing at a few of the jokes, if it was uploaded online it would’ve gotten a lot more popular, Disney XD definitely held it back as a show for random bs, I imagine it’s what Hellbenders would’ve been like if Zach and Chris actually got it picked up, of course more child friendly
bro all these old shows is so nostolgic, thank you for covering disney XD, kicky B the goat
Luther meets musso
Crash and berstine is special to me
I know XD does have some animes on it, but mostly Yu-Gi-Oh and stuff like that
I completely forgot about pair of king but when you played the theme songs it all came flooding back
As a kid i didnt think XD was suposed too be for boys i thougth it was for older kids😭
I have no clue how I watched a ton of Disney XD but don’t remember a single one of these existing. Must have been watching Boomerang or Cartoon Network when these were being aired.
forgot gamers guide to pretty much everything truly truly truly disappointed
I did like Mitchell mussos hey album tho. Hey is a good song and no one can tell me other wise.
The disney channel doesnt exist in The Netherlands. Atleast not in the standard package. So the dutchies grew up with only nickelodeon and DisneyXD. Not even cartoon network and boomerang were in the standard package
stablished titles is a scam, its been proven to be a scam so glad you were one to accept a scam sponsor
Tbh as a kid I always liked disney xd more since i just didn't like the typical story where a misunderstood girl in high school finds her true love through the power of music and friendship.
The gamecube controller actually I think is meant to make the show more timeless, as at the time, the gamecube controller was one of the only controllers that people preferred over current nintendo controllers, and to this day it's still comparable with Pro controllers and leagues better than the normal switch controllers.
makes sense they were both arrested in burbank, i think that's where disney's tv studios are.
Didn't Star vs the forces of evil Play on Disney XD
I loved crash and Bernstein. For a long time as a kid I used crash as my gamer tag
nooooooooooo mark established titles is a scammmm
honestly I really like disney xd for really no reason, my favorite show being Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero
Xd is older thn jessie
if mark was on tv i would watch it.
crash and bernstein!!!!! i loved that show so so so so much
God this makes me think of mighty med. holy shit did that show suck. It was like if someone took the trope of making a character an obnoxious jerk in the hopes of making them endearing but applied to every character.
Does anyone remember mechx4 I never saw it but I saw some advertisements
Ah hell naw Lieutenant Specialist Mark sponsored by the scam company
that randy show has grotesque humor like boggers and farts. it really made me almost throw up thinking about it again. but kick was my shit
Play the entire pair of kings intro That goes hard
Huge pair of kings fan here, yes the fish was an incredible moment for me when I was a kid lol
pickle and peanut is the best show ever
This was my period of Disney Channel! In Israel there was no DisneyXD, just the Disney Channel, so these were combined with regular Disney Channel programming. You unlocked so many memories.
If Ben Schwartz gets older Will he still be voicing sonic in the sonic movies😮😮
I think the reason I hate mayo comes from Crash And Bernstein
Crash and Bernstein was my favorite show of all time for like 3 years
Somehow feeling blessed that I grew up with the 90's cartoon shows , major missing !
Funny thing, In Japan they LOOOOVED Pickle and Peanut, it got tons of merchandise and had a huge following. So much so that Disney XD's final broadcast in Japan was an episode of Pickle and Peanut
i watched disney xd every day
I remember crash and Bernstein and Pickle and peanut
Disney xd was my entire personality. I felt so cool just watching it
Pickle and peanut is still one of my favorite shows, I still can’t believed it aired on Disney though.
I lived Disney XD because I was unable to watch the other cartoon channels I remember watching from around 2013 and man, this video provides some good nostalgia
Can u cover the live action cartoon network shows? Im part of the nostalgic era for it lol
You forgot about Kirby Buckets
I occasionally remember Crash and Bernstein and it is a fantastic fever dream
Crash and Bernstein was my favorite as a kid cuz of how funny and manic it was
Pickle and peanut is so underrated
Crash reminds me of randy feltface
I'm from the netherlands, not sure if it was like this for others, but when i grew up i never watched disney channel and olny ever disney XD. It had so much good content imo. Always got confused when i heared americans shit on the channel lol.
I feel like I stopped watching pair of kings when Adam came on cause I fully don't remember that.
Hi huge Pair of skins fan here. I was fucking pissed with the new king bc I hated him he was so annoying. I never watched it again and still haven’t
Ben shwarts … DEWEY DUCK
Guys what about YoKai Watch and Kaito Joker?  *the second one may not have aired in the US's DisXD but it's obscure, so let it count*
Whatever happened to jetix
Today I learned that "toe stuck in a bathtub faucet" is apparently a common comedy gag. Seriously, who gets their toe stuck on a bathtub faucet?
I remember loving pickle and peanut and as usual I am very disappointed in young me
I  unironically enjoyed all of the shows that were mentioned in this video
Established titles 💀
Rash and Bernstein lived in my head rent free and taunts me about it every single day.
I remember tuning into Disney Xd only to watch the Pokémon anime, Yokai Watch, the let’s play shows, Parker plays and walk the prank show. Do anyone remember these?
I don't know i think pickle and peanut would have been like a Internet cartoon or one for new grounds
Sheen is the man!
Lord Sonic Mark
Wasn't there some show called "boyster?" Disney XD was weird man
When I'm high as hell I f*cking love pickle and peanut (ironically) because it's just pure nonsense and the constant changing art style makes me trip. But yes a regular show is the best, no doubt
Is it wrong to say I actually i laughed at the look at what I found in your purse scene
Next time I hope you cover Slugterra, the most underrated Disney XD show. Max Steel was also alright.
Crash and Bernstein was a guilty pleasure of mine
I swear I watched every show in DisneyXD that were out since 2006...
He mentioned every show I watched in DisneyXD that I enjoyed
Pretty sure they're way more than two actors that went to prison
Maybe you forgot about Randy Cunningham but I never did. As a kid I was especially obsessed with the fan crossover "The Secret Trio" which included Randy, Danny Phantom, and American Dragon: Jake Long. 14 yr old magical boys with secret identities had a chokehold on a decent sized portion of cartoon fandom tumblr. Not to mention how the secret trio an already fan crossover would crossover with "the mystery kids" another fan crossover
If I had a nickel for everytime mark used the “if I had a nickel” joke from phineas and ferb, I’d have two nickels. Which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it’s happened twice
that peanut an pickle thing is horrible! its a artstyle mix like gumball with a story like regular show!   pair of kings theme was great, okay lyrics not great but the actual music yeah!
He watched Fanboy and Chum Chum because it's an actually good show
I think I remember watching crash and Bernstein, but then I just forgot it and it was just a fever dream ever since
Don't want to sound cringey but the channel was a little nostalgic for me ( mostly because of the cartoons and only some sitcom)  but they took it away from south Africa, RIP ( at least there are at Disney channel ) but I wasn't really a fan of the skating and gaming stuff back then
I loved randy Cunningham!!! Used to read famfics about it. To this day ill always love this one fic about necronomican x randy
I remember me and a friend really really liked Crash and Bernstein.
You just got scammed! xd
Only one I didn't remember is Pickle and Peanut. But I think that's cause I never seen it.
never see people talking about Wreck It Rabbit
That Established Titles ad has aged poorly now that they've been exposed as a Scam
If I had a nickel for every time a scam has sponsored LS Mark, I'd have 1 nickel. (then again idk if there have been any others i just wanted to make the funny haha joke he did)
Lmaoo.. the way I only watched zeke and Luther was because hormonal 10 year old me just had a crush on Zeke..literally I would just stare at him and wait for phineas and ferb or chip and dale come on
Seek and Luther and pair of kings were such fever dreams where I remembered how it looked but nothing else😭 but I love lab rats
Established titles is a scam
UNPOPULAR OPINION ALERT  While I do see Pickle and Peanut as a second-rate answer to Cartoon Network's Regular Show, I don't see it as Disney's worst animated series. I'd still watch it over Gravity Falls (which is my least favorite Disney animated series). At least Pickle and Peanut had affectionate parodies of two of my favorite animated series, Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends and TaleSpin, in the respective forms of Li'l Chugger the Face Train and 90's Adventure Bear.
Fun fact: in spanish, kickin' it was called the wasabi warriors. Why
Shows with Muppets are always the best
You guys remaindered me of Kickin In. I stopped watching the show because they get rid of like half of the cast and I think only 3 were left in the end.
Ahh, the greatest last resort in history
you'll be shocked for the fanbase that still exists for RC9GN.
Man I was pissed when they wrote mf luther into Pair of Kings, shit sucked. Also, we're gonna need that kickin it review, get on that shit.
10/10 video. Funnier than among us memes? This video is great for the boys. get the whole squad around for this masterpiece. This was the first youtube review my father truly loved, in fact every time he watches the video he laughs so hard that he froths from the mouth from lack of oxygen intake. My brother loves this show so much that he goes through a magical transformation turning him into "Crash man". In fact he loses his mind and scream Crash man while beating up my children. Good boxing practice. And I chuckled at least once so the video is a masterpiece. Change my mind.
9:44 I gotta say LS Mark that “enemy” was REEEAALLLYY CLOSE
i love pair of kings but i stopped watching when they switched too. went back and watched it recently on disney plus tho and i don’t regret any second of it
I love the pair of king them song
I watched crash and burn as a kid and i loved it 😭
For the king's show I think it's possible they planned to have 3 kings at some point anyway and just were able to replace him due to that or at least had some sorta plan
So my uncle (yes I know the stereotype but I stg I’m not lying) worked on “Crash and Bernstein”, and swore it was gonna be a huge hit. He called it something like  “the muppets but with more farts” to get my little brothers excited, though said I probably wouldn’t like it cause I’m a girl. When the show came out he gave us some merch for the show, (including a umbrella that we still use all the time), and told us to hype it up to all of our friends. Needless to say, it’s now a point of laughter everytime we see him lol  I think he’ll be glad to know that someone liked it, even if ironically lol  (Luckily he’s worked on stuff that didn’t fail so massively, such as “Drake and Josh”, and a few episodes of “icarly”)
I never seemed to forget Crash and Bernstein. It just stayed in the back of my brain.
I preferred Jetix to Disney XD but Disney XD killed it. They tried adding all these new shows I hated that shafted out all my fav cartoons Jetix had been showing. I even believe the first ever show shown on that channel was kid vs kat.
As a child I loved crash, the purple puppet I loved it!
I live in Southeast Asia so the sitcoms for whatever reason we're moved to 2 AM every Thursday and Friday. I remember i love Crash and Bernstein so much i actually wake up till 2 AM so i can watch that show and also other Disney XD sitcoms that aired before Crash and Bernstein. Disney XD sitcoms are the reason why i have insomnia now lol
Crash and Bernstein was the best
Ah yes. My Favorite disney show: crash and epstein
BRUH I LOVE KICK BUTTOWSKI! HE IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST AND YOUNGEST DAREDEVIL IN DISNEY HISTORY!!!!    LIKE IF U AGREE!
I LOVED CRASH AND BERNSTEIN!!!!!!!!!
Can you do for the Forgotten Nickelodeon shows here the shows  The Mighty B teenage mutant ninja turtles 2012 el tiger  ChalkZone my life as a teenage robot
Dude, I remember watching Disney XD so much. Stuff like KiD Vs KaT, Kick Buttowski, Phineas And Ferb, Pair Of Kings, Kickin It, Lab Rats, Crash And Bernstein, Pucca, Randy Cunningham, Jimmy Two-Shoes, and a few others.
Forgotten shows but nothing about Penn Zero: Part-time Hero, I really miss this show it was really good in my opinion
i liked randy cunningham it was cool :P
I can't quite remember. But I think I liked pickle and peanut, I mean, this is coming from someone who loves uncle grandpa, so it not too far of a stretch. Don't know why I liked weird shows like that. Maybe I just wanted something different from the norm.
As a 12-14 yr old randy cunningham was my favorite cartoon ever!
Nah but no way you said the Pair of Kings opening is bad. The nerve of this dude T-T
i remember loving crash and bernstein. i used to quote it all the fucking time and sometimes i still do quote it. whenever i see a bird in a game my autistic brain kicks in and i go "FALCON NOISE FALCON NOISE".
Kick was fucking lit
Loved Randy. And then slowly starting not to like. And jimmy was fire
Pair of kings was lit
Zeke and Luther was ok
I remember enjoying Zeke and Luther as a kid but I don't remember any episode besides the one where it's Luther's(?) birthday and he turns 4 because of February 29. I think if I were to watch it today it would just be to see how any locations I recognize since the pier in some of the shots is close to my house.  However I do miss I'm in the Band and as far as I'm aware it's not on Disney+.
One that I vaguely remember but haven’t seen anything on in a while is Kirby buckets. I don’t even remember the plot of the show, just that there was this principle with long hair, a zombie dog thing that got shot with a crossbow, and then there was like a hood and evil principal with the good one having dimension where time is slower. That’s all I remember tho, I don’t know the plots to those at all
Me seeing the name Epstein at 24:10: Wait.....What?
I saw your thumbnail and saw crash and I was like “HOLY FCK ITS THE PURPLE PUPPET I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT THAT SHOW”
“Whats established titles?”  A scam.
I remember going on disney xd to watch youtubers play because i got banned from YouTube
i vividly remember crash and berenstein and i fucking loved that show
its so cool to see these shows talked about again. if there is a follow-up, i hope it includes kirby buckets, wander over yonder, fish hooks, and penn zero part time hero. i don't remember if they hold up, but i don't see anyone talk about these
13:49 tekken 7 vermilion gates theme if anyone is curious about the ost
Everyone always forgets about Aaron Stone😮‍💨
I wish he had talked about Mr. Young. Does anyone else remember that show? It was about some teenage genius who graduated college at like 16 and decided to become a high school teacher. So he has trouble gaining everyone’s respect since he is their age. I loved that show and randomly remembered it recently.
Lord Sonic The Hedgehog Marcus
Pickle and Peanut is a waste of money and that money can be used for better projects. Change my mind.
I loved Zeke and Luther. The episode where Zeke got his toe was memorable and I didn't know that it was done before. I was sad when I heard what happened to luther. I really love md Disney XD  I loved pairs of kings, I still remember the theme song, the change really affected the show and I didn't care about it again
Oh there is also this one so called right now kapow  on disney xd I love it its like robot chicken but kid friendly and with the same characters
9:24 Hey it's Chuck!
Crash and Bernstein was awesome crash was a goat
That Sponsorship didn't age well.
if you decide to make more disney forgoten shows i got a cartoon named dude thats my ghost
4:53 I don’t like the way he looked at him
I remember this It was my childhood It was kinda cringe but It was my childhood
my crash and Bernstein suppressed memories came flooding in, when you brought it up.
I was a serious XD kid I watched (and loved) pretty much all these shows you talked about I actually still watch pickle and peanut all the time
Pair of Kings was one of my most favorite shows ever as a kid lol. I memorized the theme song and all 😂
Pair of Kings was my shit man, still holding out hope there will be that rumoured movie that has been tossed around
I know I’ve watched every single show that you showed pair of kings and crash and Bernstein were my jams when I was younger.
I’m Irish and watched the shit out of Disney XD, Kickin It, I’m in the band, Zeke and Luther, Pair of Kings, Kick Buttowski Total Drama Island and Lab rats were the only shows I watched though
Bout time someone talked about Crash and Bernstein. We stan Mr. Poolos
Wait, is that why Brady disappeared?  I also remember Crash and Bernstein and I found it funny sometimes but too intense.
As if i could ever forget Crash and Bernstein
Heyy! I worked on TWO of these shows!
I'm surprised you didn't mention Boyster
2:43 This didn't age well...
Note: Established Titles Is A Scam.
I loved pair of kings and I actually loved the switch between boz and brady
Pickle and peanut was great.
20:42 WTF WHY IS THE HORSE COMING ALL OVER THE ORPHANAGE
Did you know that the kid who played Wyatt Bernstein was in Daredevil and played young Wilson Fisk. So yeah Wyatt Bernstein killed Bill Fisk
honestly, i knew ben schwartz from randy cunningham. so when i heard him in the sonic movies my brain turned geek mode on.
I can only imagine what Commando Crash would look like. I see him quickly out ranking everyone in his platoon almost instantly, fighting entire wars with his bare hands, and high fiving the president or something like that
Remember Toon Disney? They could've been just like Cartoon Network, but they don't have the talent, the drive, or the ambition to pull it off. So instead, they became A boy version of Disney Channel who was already becoming A girly channel by that point'. Also, remember when Disney Channel had shows like 'Disney Family Album', or 'Masterpiece Theater' with George Plimpton? Yeah, I'm the old guy in the room.
Pair of kings theme song terrible? Nah u buggin
Watch pair of kings and rank it
Pair of kings theme song was fan-fuckin-tastic
Not to be dramatic but i would die for RC9GN
remember atomic puppet and tron uprising
I clicked on this video JUST for crash and Bernstein that was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid I'm so glad you enjoyed it
Fuck tron uprising I guess
I'm surprised you didn't include _Penn Zero: Part Time Hero_ as that Cartoon is overlooked by the rest of the Disney Cartoon community.
Imagine crash and Jeffy from SML in the same room 😭🤣
Honestly, but a thousand times I prefer the Disney XD series like randy, kick, camp lakebottom, slugterra, kid vs kat, etc. along with the classics from the 2000s and 90s from CN and Nick, I never liked those 2010 series from CN and all those disney channel series like amphibia, TOH, ladybug etc.  PS: As for the reboots, I prefer TTGO since at least with that series we have a more daring and risky humor, it's like watching Bobs Burger, American Dad, Family Guy and Futurama, but for all audiences, it's more now than adult series. They are coming back with more force I have seen PRIMAL and I was impressed hopefully for the 3rd season spear returns and everyone can be together
Thank you for reminding of Crash and Bernstein, I am forever in your debt.
PICKLE AND PEANUT GOES HARD AS HELL, WATCH THIS SHIT WHILE HIGH SHITS GREAT
YOU DIDNT INCLUDE PENN ZERO PART TIME HERO
Zeke and Luther was one of the shows that got me into skateboarding more.
I think pickle and  peanut is very underrated
I used to love crash and Bernstein and had totally forgotten about it! Thanks for the great memories xx
Pair of Kings was the best. It's a shame that Michele Musso got fired.
I remember when I first watched Pickle & Peanut, and one of the first thoughts that I had about the show was “I think I owe Fanboy and Chum-Chum an apology for calling them the most annoying cartoon I’ve ever watched”. Yes, it was that bad.
I guess u can call me a die hard pair of kings fan cuz I still read some of the fan fiction years after it ended. Also, when boz came in I hated it too at first but then I learned to like him
Missed this when it was first uploaded so I'm only just now watching it, that sponsor segment aged poorly very quickly lol, literal days before the video talking about how shady the company is, kind of surprised it hasn't been edited out of the video.
I think Pickle & Peanut is a pretty alright show, it reminds me of the Adventures of flapjack it’s so fucking weird I LOVE it.
Just mentioning quickly that Mitchell was always making music, it didn't start after his arrest. That's not an excuse, just an acknowledgement of an inaccuracy in the video. His first album is from 2009.
i never saw one single kid that ever liked pickle and peanut in my entire life one of the worst shows that i ever saw
gosh i LOVED Crash and Bernstein and Pair of Kings(a little salty about the cast change) as a kid
I used to watch Crash and Bernstein on Netflix back when Disney stuff was still on there😭
i f*cking love crash and bernstein- forgot about it until now :)
I LOVED DISNEY XD especially kickin it, I'm with the band and zeke and luther😭😭😭
As someone who was absolutely obsessed with Disney XD and occasionally watched Randy Cunningham 9th Grade Ninja, I just thought it was a rip off of American Dragon Jake Long but with a really shitty theme song lol
Pickle and peanut reminded me of the show chowder anyone else think that
Lord sonic mark=LSmark
Anyone remember Camp Lakebottom or Doraemon being on Disney XD?
I remember how I had promotional gear for some of these shows on Roblox lol
The sponsor is a scam
I stated on Disney xd I won’t lie lmao that and jetix they got a young Zach right
Established titles is a scam dude
i watched disney dx, cause starwars, and there were a few anime there that were a great pokemon substitute for that age where i wanted something that felt edgyer
Established titles is a scam
Disney cdc10 had so many gems kicking it pair of kings gravity falls kick buttowckie
I didn’t realize Disney XD was targeted for boys. We just watched whatever our brother put since he was in charge of the controller (he was the quickest to change the channel when we would watch adult swim)
Crash is him😭💀
The only part of crash and Bernstane is the pare where crash seas mayo is white diarrhea
Bro says most forgotten shows doesn’t even mention Aaron stone
I see a lot of people mentioning Kickin’ it, but personally a show I don’t think gets enough recognition is Penn zero: Part-time hero. The characters are pretty 2 dimensional, but I remember loving the art style, and the premise of the show was actually pretty interesting and fun. My favorite episode was the cereal one. Such a same it got cancelled after only 2 seasons…
Kick n It was actually lowkey lit
I think I only watched Disney XD because Gravity Falls was moved there, meaning that I had to sit through half of this bullshit
Did this video come out before established titles was found out to be a scam?
I loved pickle and peanut ngl
i loved randy cunningham it was peak tv for me and still is pretty good i remembered hating how they changed the theme song tho the old one for the 1st season was better
Established titles is a scam. Look it up on YouTube.
I did enjoy pair of kings and the change really did piss me off when I was younger but I kept on watching. And let me just say, it didn't get any better, for some reason it went from two annoying "twins" with good chemistry one decently funny and annoying king and a very out of place one with their only trope being I'm wackier
Ngl Crash and Bern was a banger, even the intro song was kinda good
I thought Zeke and Luther and lab rats was so cool growing up
My opinions for these shows: Zeke and Luthor was ok for like a filler show when I was waiting for other shows. As a kid I liked pair of kings but stopped watching when the last season aired. Randy Cunningham is something I liked watching at first, then got old of it after I got a bit older, only to come back and realize it was actually ok. I hate pickle and peanut I…. Remember crash and Bernstein but it’s like I just remember watching it. I just can’t remember anything from it.  Also Kicken It was awesome and just wanted to throw it out there
Kickin It is the best show Disney made and it’s long enough you could do a whole video on just it.
your uptalking is pissing me off i cannot watch this entire video
I always thought that Disney XD had a bigger downfall than Disney Channel. It was building something but after the popular shows ended around 2015-16 it slowly faded away for me
That I recall crash and Bernstein gave a lazy explanation for why he was alive in the final episode   In mail crash and family get mail from the factory saying he's defective along with a large Bach of toys like him . so thay do some " rad and extreme " stuff and eventually take him in hoping it's just repairs and stuff that might remove his memory but sadly   find the company plans to throw him in a wood chiper ( it was given a cute name and lazy decoration ) some how thay throw crash in and when thay leve the factory crash is back and like " ¥øű çăņ ńõť đ€fê£ț mę " and the family is happy
Top of the world was a great song
Why did you watch planet sheen or fanboy and chum chum
Pair of Kings was forgotten but I personally loved it tbh it was goated 🐐  Randy Cunningham 9th Grade Ninja was also goated
the XD is meant to be a laughing emoticon
Me I remember all of these
Remember when Disney XD aired Doctor Who for like 5 minutes? Yes, that happened.
It had doctor who, lab rats, and the occasional let’s play which was fun to see randomly
i LOVED crash when i was like 10 it was insane!! i wasn’t allowed to watch this at my moms so whenever we went to my dad’s girlfriend house me and my brother would bindge this show from the moment we ate breakfast to the moment we went to bed
I loved pickle and peanut
Damn I still think bout these a lot tbh
Pickle and peanut was weird to me even when i was like 7 a mix of a nightmare and fever dream super weird
Kickin it and lab rats were pretty solid
Pickle and Peanut gives me the same vibes as Apple and Onion
XD stood for “eXtreme Digital”, what research did you do?
If you ever do another one of these videos on Disney XD, I think itd be really cool if you look into Motorcity. Its genuinely a pretty good series with nice animation, yet no one know what Im talking about whenever I try to mention it. Was sadly treated pretty poorly by Disney XD.
Pickle and peanut has a unique art style? The amazing world of gumball wants to know your location.
I remember the caveman episode of Pair of Kings, couldn’t remember the name of the show though, been trying to figure it out for YEARS
Zeke and Luther were the best for me they had cute boys and cookie
And pair of kings was the best Disney cd show
Zeke and Luther was amazing
Pair of kings>>>>>
Crash and bernstein was my favorite show of all time when it came out and i love it still
BRO PAIR OF KINGS WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHOWS ESPECIALLY CRASH AND BERNSTEIN
Established titles is a scam. Dissapointed that you took their money and still havent taken down the sponsor after all the news with them. But kudos to you and your channel. I wish to retract my view from your channel.
pickle and peanut looks like those adult swim shows that just feel like fever dreams 😭 if that makes any sense
If you make a part two you should check out Two More Eggs
Disliked video as you are still actively promoting a scam to your viewers come on man do better delete the comment stop costing your viewers there valuable money
Zeke and luther, pair of kings ,lab rats and kicking it were great
Pair of Kings is my first experience with betrayal. Brady was my favourite character and to say he was NEVER part of the prophesy?! I was pissed and turned my back on the show forever!
I love pickle and peanut and also regular show but I love the randomness of both shows
Randy cunningham is goated
The og’s remember the switch from Jetix to Disney XD. 😤
Please check Special delivery from Planet X, it’s stuck in my mind for years and it’s gone from the internet
Isn’t established titles a scam
Pickle and Peanut used to scare me but I was so compelled to watch  The squirrel girl episode scared me so bad
I remember Cartoon Network's MAD doing parodies of some of these and getting Gilbert Gottfried to voice Crash in the Crash & Bernstein parody. RIP legend.
i was a massive fan of pair of kings as a kid and the cast change turned me off completely u are not alone
Didn’t the sipcom about superhero medics was on Disney xd
Rest in peace Thurston the cat
That sponsorship sure aged well

Zeke and Luther was goated it made my childhood
I loved pickle and peanut.  The randomness being normalized was funny to me.  Little details like how peanut can never park a car normal despite being a decent driver was on of my favorite continuing gags. I had a phase where I thought if peanut was a human he would be hot so I would draw him as a human a lot plus I shipped him with pickle.  I also had a randy Cunningham phase and I loved his voice actor, to this day I get randy nostalgia hearing Ben Schwartz anywhere.
when i was little i loved crash and bernstein! It was my favorite show i watch every second! i forgot about till this video
horrible  taste in shows kickin it and lab rats and pair of kings are amazing
I actually loved randy Cunningham. I also liked pair of kings and zeke and Luther but I don’t remember zeke and Luther looking that cheap lol. I also to this day think the opening to pair of kings is a banger
and kickbutttoski
How is it that the only show in this video I didn’t watch was Pickle & Peanut?
@LSMark if you research more about “Established Titles”, it’s essentially a scam.
Disney cod was for the cool kids
I remember all of them
"don't ask why I watched either of those shows I was 8" yeah... I'm personally confused about my younger love for Fanboy and Chum Chum. I think with Planet Sheen I just wanted more stuff to do with Jimmy Neutron...
The real question is where Milo Murphy's Law fits into this whole topic
Crash and Bernstein is a underrated classic!!
You do know your promoting a scam
pair of kings, kickin’ it and lad rats were my childhood!! still has a special place in my heart!
Nah you’ll never unconvinced me the XD in Disney XD does not stand for Extra Disney…..wait Fuck I thought it stood for that but now typing it out I realize Extra starts with an E not an X Welp there goes my logic I’ve had since childhood down the drain 😂😅
Disney XD was the only other channel besides pbs for cartoons that we had so I remeber these shows fondly.
Pair of kings was okay, but I hated when they changed the actors and I stopped watching like you did. But some of these shows was cool, but cringe now
The sponsor did not age well lol
I remember being a hardcore pair of kings fan
The ad is a scam font buy anything like this
Your actually crazy for saying the pair of kings intro song was terrible, that song was goated.
The reason I started watching Disney is because of Pair of King
TIL that the original name for that karate series is "Kickin' it", for some reasons here in Brazil it became "Os guerreiros wasabi" or "The wasabi warriors".
YOU DID NOT JUST TALK ABOUT PICKLE AND PENUT LIKE THAT
I fuckin hated pickle and peanut lmao
I loved crash dude
remember also the short clips of two more eggs used to love that show
No hate , fanboy and chumchum was bomd
yall remember penn zero part time hero that used to be the best show every to watch in 2014
2:51 Great, I always wanted to look like a gullible twat to all my peasant peers. You know even before I knew Established Titles was a scam I was like "This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard". Given Raid: Shadow Legends has sponsored you in the past, it's clear you'll take any sponsorship.
Scam
Since I guess this guy likes to gloss over stuff, Kick Buttowski's "resurge of popularity" is what I believe to be the comic made by Jourd4n, who made a comic based on the show called "Welcome to Mellowbrook" which was really popular for the few chapters they made, where they retold and built upon some aspects in the show, especially the romance between Kick and Kendall.
DisneyXD was my shit every day after school shit was good
I love crash and Bernstein I always got excited when I found it on TV
Nicktoons
actualy disney xd stands for Disney Xtreme Digital
C&B was one of my favorite shows back than lol
I grew up with jetex(or jedex, regardless it was part of my childhood) and Disney XD since it first started and I remember almost all of these shows including "I'm in the band" that was one of my favorites.
i just think it’s really funny that the most successful person from that show today is the baby sister.
Crash and Bernstein went so hard, Crash was an absolute menace and insanely based
11:45 just a gem
Disney XD was my life in my elementary school days. Lab Rats, Mighty Med, Randy Cunningham, even some animes like Beyblade was my life for a while. Shame it got pulled from my country.
Hey dude, you probably shouldn't take sponsor's from established titles, they're apparently a scam, but, do what you want.
I was that pair of kings fan, and i love that song  Crash was OG
Love the video but you missed SlugTera which is completely forgotten but in its prime had a solid concept
Qxir: GROWING UP IN IRELAND
You crossed the line with lab rats that was a good show so is might med
Remember Aaron Stone
Pickle and Peanut is SO GOOD
"I can only assume to make everyone his bitch" -LS Mark 2022
rip established titles lmao
DisneyXD had more memorable shows don’t @me
I thought it replaced jetx
Dude I grew up on Zeke and Luther that show took up a lot of my childhood
Established titles isn’t established nor does it give you a real title
I can confirm that is just what it's like to live in burbank
SCAM SPONSORSHIP
Why does it kind of match the video and audio at 25:18
I remember going on TV every single day just to watch those YouTube snippets because I didn’t have access to my mom‘s phone 😂
Crash and berstein was the loud house before the loud house. I also think it was funnier
Glad you said subscribe. I hadent yet and I been watching this chnanel for 3 years
The only thing i rember about zack and luthor is the episode where they hide skateboards because they became ilegal in the neighborhood  Pair of Kings is somewhat better because i found the characters slightly funny, ironically the exception is the main characters  Randy & kick are absolutly great and im goad they are coming back  Puppet purple guy and the weird fat kid is a 7/10 but crash is a 20/10
Pair of Kings was the only Disney channel show I enjoyed ngl
Poor Mark, prolly just recently found out established titles was a scam
kick buttowski, mighty med, and pickle and peanut were my favorites growing. i remember when they used to show yo-kai watch too
I watched this channel a lot of the time back when I was younger.
I saw Crash on the thumbnail and quite literally gasped, that show was my childhood in so many ways
I really don't care how weird these old shows were on Disney XD they sure were the best during my childhood.
Pair of Kings went downhill after Mitchell Musso left. I used to love that show as a kid
Talk about the weird fish show
Crash gives off real Scout vibes…
crash and bernstein goes hard
I can't remember the name  that show about a boy and a magic rabbit from another dimension if anyone knows pls tell me I Loved that show
In the comments whats the best second version of a network disney xd toon nick mtv2 and mant more
established titles is a scam, its been covered by various youtubers
dude, zeke and luther is goat
dude i loved crash and bernstein
I will pay good money for a crash puppet
that established titles promo did not age well
You forgot zeak and Luther
DisneyXD was lowkey Fye sometimes
To be fair Lab Rats was an amazing show and one of Disney's best. The rest are another story
Zeke and luther How can Ginger afford shirts
That crash one loosely reminds me of 'Cousin Skeeter'
I remember watching Crash and Bernstein and laughing extremely hard at Crash puking in a hamster ball. It’s the dumbest thing ever but it was hysterical to little me for some reason
Fun Fact: Dan Povenmire pitched a theme song for pair of kings, but his didn’t get chosen. He swapped some lyrics and made it “Takin Care of Things” that played at the end of Across the 2nd Dimension
I knew someone I watched did an established titles ad. Though I vaguely remember him also doing raycons so ig I'm not surprised
I’m literally so happy finally someone is talking about crash and Bernstein because that was one of my favorite shows growing up and it still is. I am watching it on Disney+ and show I even showed it to my little cousin and she seems to enjoy it. I never really understood why when I was little thinking about it like why did crash left? I will always cried to my mom. Why crash left? I always always love that muppet what does anyone know what happened to the puppet it sounds like did they burn it that or they throw it out because if they didn’t, I would like to purchase it.
Established titles didnt age well
Established titles sponsorship is a scam just letting you know
Disney XD had gravity falls so I’d say 2010s it was elite 🤌🏾🤌🏾😊
one time i was watching crash and bernstein and there was a scene where they were being chased by godzilla or some big monster and i couldnt pause it and the noises were scary so i cried and went downstairs and cried for about 25 minutes ranting to my parents about this scary show and they were like "well the episode is probably over by now??" so i went back upstairs and the credits were playing meanwhile i was confused because i thought i'd only been down there for 5 minutes. i was around 5 by the way.
i saw crash at the thumbnail and got hit wave a wave of nostalgia
I like Zeke and luther  Zeke little sister Ginger has expensive clothes and shirt
Pickle and peanut kinda creeped me out
Established titles sponsorship aged like milk in the sun
I liked lab rats for a while but  remember liking kicking it, but I was probably 7. Zeke and luthor and pair of kings were both shows I didnt like but I definitely liked Zeke and Luthor better of the two, never really liked crash and Bernstein but it was something I did watch. A show that was unlocked from the recesses of my memory from watching this was that show where that kid was like a genius science teacher and I remember somewhat liking it but finding it boring most of the time.
Genuinely, ben Schwartz doesnt know any other voice. Have no clue how hes voiced so many characters. Hes even leonardo in rise of the TMNT. HE ONLY HAS ONE VOICE!!!
Oh god established titles
I loved 9th grade ninja and kick buttowski
I thought XD meant Xtreme Disney
I remember watching a show in Disney XD called peter punk
Wdym Pair of Kings and 9th Grader Ninja is “forgotten” That shows were such a hit in my country(among me and my friends and family at least) and they were our reason to watch the channel for. I remember having a crush on the Ninja book (don’t ask why)
Y'all forgetting such classics like Dude, That's my Ghost or Kid vs Kat
I manly remembered Disney XD for them showing reruns of BOTH Phineas and Ferb and Gravity Falls
my Favorite sitcom from Disney XD is Kickin It and Lab Rats
I have disney XD imagine where i live hint:my pfp
The LS stands for loves spooning. There figured it out now where's my money😎😎😎
hey mark, established titles is a scam. look it up on youtube
disney xd shows stand for xoxo disney
This advertisement didnt hold up very well
I LOVED Randy Cunningham! It was my favorite show! Still kinda is, I rewatch every now and then just to get that nostalgia. That nostalgia never dies man.  Wish we got a third season… F in the chat
Crash and Bernstein is underrated asf, loved that show when I was like 8
OHH NO ESABLISH TITLE
Adam Hicks is the real-life J-Roc from trailer park boys
Isn’t established titles like.. not great?
As a kid with ADHD don't hate on me for this but I've liked pickle and peanut, it kept my attention to where it was just chaotic and stupid enough for my attention span of a 5 year old to latch on to.
The Established titles ad ruins the whole video
the ad section didn't aged well
okay, i loved watching rc9gn growing up because i was always like "Ninjas>>>superheroes" and im SO glad they put the show on disney+, im still hopeful for a season 3 tho, the author said they made a petition for a season 3 so.....  ye ^^
I actually watched DisneyXD pretty extensively, UwU I remember when Kick Buttowski moved over there OwO that’s how I found out it was a thing Rawr!!
14:45 what show is this cilp from?
NOOOOOO NOT ESTABLISHED TITLES
I remember seeing my older brother watching randy the ninja cartoon, he really enjoyed it, i've told him yesterday if he remembered that show, he said no. That show truly fell into shadows man
I BOLTED UPRIGHT AND SHOUTED "EPSTEIN?" 24:09 i wasnt expecting that omfg
Crash is not the CEO of Based, he is the CREATOR of based
Crash is a fucking monster.
0:11 I really want to say that it was heavily implied XD stood for Extreme Disney. Like I swear at some point the announcer guy would say “Disney XD, Extreme Disney!” At the end of some commercial breaks or in between shows.
Surprised no motor city. Great video!
I remember watching Crash and Bernstein.... it was a nice show, I miss it
Cousin Skeeter walked so Crash and Berestein could walk slightly faster I guess
20:53 at least Oddballs is somewhat good
Pickle and peanut was Good. Nobody cannot change my opinion
Randy Cunningham was my absolute shit, especially when it got into the lore of the ninja and the characters around it. At one point Randy goes to some ninja camp that's actually a cover from a previous ninja who let the power go to his head, now an adult and still trying to get the mask back. There was also one that, iirc, dealt with a weirdly prominent problem: social media, and how quickly public perception can change with it. I remember that one specifically because it contains the only "behind the scenes" shot in the show where they somewhat explain how he disappears in the smoke bombs (he just moves really fast while people react to the initial blast)   I do wish they expanded more on the human side of things though, maybe treated  Randy and the ninja as two separate entities, because the seemingly two separate identities felt too interlinked to really set them apart (how would randy as himself solve a ninja problem or how would he, as the ninja, solve a teenager problem, etc.)

10:47 Arin Hansen⁉️⁉️⁉️
There's this cartoon network show called Apple and Onion and it's everything that Pickle and Peanut wants to be
How can we forget the classic that was Aaron Stone?! I remember I used to love it being into gaming heavily
Have you ever been in Antrim
i enjoyed Pair of Kings shit was fye 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 dont care for the change tho
Disney “XMOWOf DID”
Crash and Bernstein was a great show.  I hope its on Disney+
Welp, since Established Titles is a scam, we may never know what the LS in LS Mark means now
Established Titles is a scam. There’s Scottish laws stating why it’s fake. More of a gag gift than anything. Also, you can always just add a title to your documents if allowed
I mean, consider the path Miley Cyrus went down. It’s all very similar, and I personally think it’s all just promo. It’s all planned, nothing is genuine
I just rewatched pair of kings not that long ago and surprisingly it wasn’t as cringy as I thought. The dumb jokes actually made me laugh.
what’s the show at 14:44?
Before I watched this video I only remembered 2 things about Disney XD, Kick Buttowski was absolutely awesome, and that I really wanted to make the cheese smoothie from Zeke and Luther when I was young. Didn't remember anything else about that show, just the smoothie.
Maybe distance yourself from established titles. It's getting a lot of heat right now as a scam.
God, when you zoomed out saying “watching on THIS channel” and the recommendations included a bunch of DBZA, I tripped out bc my recommendations was listing the latest DBZA creator commentary video!
Oh my god he stopped putting Brian in the thumbnails we're all gonna die
Mark established titles is a scam
established titles is a scam
LS Mark Lord Sex Mark
DISNEY LMAO DHRBGHFBR- 🤣  I unironically loved Disney XD
I love crash I mean he was the face of pranksgiving
I am one of the hardcore Pair of Kings fans who loved that show. It was one of the first fantasy sitcoms that had incredible storylines and character arcs. I wasn't a fan of season 3 mainly because Mitchell musso was gone, him and Doc Shaw really did have great comedy chemistry. I will always love Pair of Kings. P.S Am I also the only one who misses I'm in the Band?
i still remember kirby buckets
I loved 9th grade ninja cartoon! It was so captivating to watch
Don’t buy in to established titles, it’s a proven scam
EVERYONE DONT SO ANYTHING WITH ESTABLISHED TITLES ITS A SCAM PEOPLE
Remember Cosomodore???
you should make a part two!! doing one on nicktoons would also be cool
Xd and cartoon sometime Nickelodeon
Bobby Wasabi will not be forgotten.
I like the episode of Crash and Bernstein where Crash keeps having erotic nightmares about his doctor’s mustache.
I never really liked completely random shows like uncle grandpa, aqua teen hunger force, 12oz mouse, but I really liked pickle and peanut.
Idk abt you guys but Disney XD I was 100% their demographic. I was like woah action and bro stuff, sweet
rip thurston :(
9th grade ninja reminded of a reboot of the American dragon that had almost a similar plot line not surprised tho as Disney does use the same ideas but with a new style added as a difference or in basic terms, repackaged.
Established titles is a known scam btw!!!
I want to bring to attention established titles is a scam
2:41 well that’s an oof right there
I love crash and Bernstein best show ever
Um.... DJ do you know Estaelished title is a scam right?
Zeke and Luther was filmed in my county and their weird little apartment was down the street from my cousins house. Seeing landmarks all around in a show on TV really cool a the time and still kind of cool to me now lol. So unfortunate though how one of the protaganists ended up though  also their finale was filmed at an aquarium that no longer exists
i loved pickle and peanut because of how stupid it was. like i would watch it and know it sucked as a child
Does everyone promote this fake sponsorship.
Established titles is a fucking scam bro
The s in ls Mark now stands for sonic
Contents cringe I'd found your voice less annoying if you did Content reading about jesus
I HATE PICKLE AND PEANUT!! I HATE REGULAR SHOW!!
i loved crash and bernstein as a kid i would rewatch the show all the time and then it disappeared one day
Your sponsor is a scam
Inb4 wahhhh wahhhh muh scam
The LS in LSMark stands for Loose soup. I can’t believe your loose with your food beverages….SHAME 😂😂😂
established titles is a scam
I remember watching Disney XD more than Disney Channel. I mainly watched Phineas and Ferb, Star vs. the forces of evil, Gravity Falls and Lab Rats but I didn’t watch the other ones as much as Lab Rats at the time. Me and cousins loved Lab Rats.
Your sponsors a scam💀
When I'm in a selling out to shitty companies contest and my opponent is LS Mark 😰😰😰😰😰
One of my favorite Disney shows I never see anyone talk about is Penn Zero Part-Time Hero
No we definitely used epic more in the 90s 😂
MAKE A PART 2
Crash and Bernstein was the groundwork for my sense of humor
I forgot about pickle and peanut what a throwback 😂
I used to love Pair of Kings and after the change I just stopped watching lol
Crash and bernstein was the best show of all time
Watch little demon on hulu
Hey, Mark you should probably look into the recent controversy around Established Titles being a scam.  I’m sure you didn’t know, but you should really look into this and then consider removing the ad-read from this video.
Established titles is a scam mark
I can’t believe I didn’t talk about so random the iconic song socks with sandals
Bro i loved watching pickle and peanut and randy cunningham i still watch p and p to this day.
I absolutely loved Kickin' It and Pair of Kings when I was a child. Still remember those goblins(?) that pissed from their buttchins from that one Pair of Kings episode
Kick Buttowski was the best thing to came out from Disney XD
Oh no established titles ☹️
Really would have been pissed if you shat on Kick Buttowski... Oh wait no I wouldn't I would have been slightly disappointed someone I respect didn't share the same opinion on a show I personally enjoy.  Anyway glad you like Kick Buttowski
The fact that the zoom out had a bunch of dbza stuff really took me off guard, I’ve been watching all of that too
you know established titles is a scam 💀
Now that you mentioned it I want to know your opinion on TheOdd1sOut show because it’s out and nobody’s talking about it
It's a shame that they deleted Disney XD i really enjoyed watching this channel on tv....😞 I hope one day they get it back up on tv again....
Wasn’t gravity falls in Disney XD? And star vs the forces of evil. Golden shows 🤩
25:18 Crussy)
not far in but I was a kid that watched XD. it was 99% for pucca.
I remember crash and Bernstein so vividly
Maybe you should stop giving a scam company time on your channel. Established Titles is a scam stop pushing them
We gonna need to see a part 2, I used to unironically LOVE kicking it and I’m curious to see if it was actually a good show or not
Idk I grew up with a lot of lab rats so I wouldn’t consider it forgotten. My school used to have it playing a lot when we had nothing to do.
Slugterria?
the sponsor’s a scam btw (do your research mark)
One reason people may not have watched the channel is because it wasn't on s basic cable package. Normally you get Nick, Disney, and CN together and for stuff like Disney XD, Boomerang, and NickToons you had to pay extra or get a different package. At least that's how I remember it.
Man I loved Crash and Bernstein when I was younger it was the only thing  I watched on Disney xd
Crash and Bernstein was my childhood
I watched some pair of kings like 3 episode was like I want to watch this and my parents where like absolutely not
You forgot shows like I’m in the band and mr young lol
I am that hardcore Pair of Kings fan. When Boz was revealed with that folded picture, holy crap i lost it. But also I loved Mitchell Musso so i was super mad when he left,,,, (obviously i didn’t realise why lmao)
Really awesome of you to take the stance on the Zeke and Luther guy that you did. Obviously doing bad things is bad, but people do deserve to restart to an extent. It's really odd to me seeing so many people actively trying to destroy people's lives when they say or do something stupid, as if it's not normal for humans to make stupid choices.
Established titles is a scam, they dont own an office in ireland, simply owning a small piece of land is not enough to legally give the title lord/lady, nor does established titles the abillity to sell ownership of the land in the first place, and it is not proven they actually plant trees.
as a kid, i always hated kick buttowskeie or however the fuck you spell it. they tried making that mf so cool and just everything they thought boys liked, it was so cringe. but crash and Bernstein… oh man. that shit was so funny for literally no reason. it was meta without trying to be meta while being meta
zèle and Luther was my shit fr!!
Established titles is a scam, you are actively promoting a scam my dude
Pair of Kings is a show that makes me smile whenever it comes into memory.
I remember enjoying Kickin sim and getting invested into it. Each character was a stereotypical trope but it still had a lot of variety in its cast and I liked how the main actor was actually a high level martial artist and would do a lot of his own stunts
Wander Over Yonder, and Phineas and Ferb were honestly good and witty shows man.
pickle and peanut was goated
I was absolutely a Disney XD stan. I actually loved Pair of Kings, Kick Buttowski and Crash and Bernstein so much!
Don’t be dissing pickle and peanut
1:05 that is literally the 4th time of me hearing that fucking joke, please, fuck off
Everyone, I highly recommend checking out YouTuber/interviewer Joe from @JZProductions26! He honestly deserves more subs! He's interviewed the following: Ben Schwartz (Randy) & Andrew Lewis Caldwell (Weinerman) from RC9GN Dylan Riley Snyder (Milton), Alex Christian Jones (Eddie) & Joel McCrary (Bobby Wasabi) from Kickin' It Tom Kenny AKA SpongeBob Kendall Schmidt from Big Time Rush And many many more!
I never watched Crash and Bernstein but I swear it was advertised all the time
“Channel that no one really watched”????? Disney XD is part of my childhood and tbh if we’re counting them as Disney channel shows then shows like Lab Rats, Kickin It, & Pair of Kings are in the top 10 imo
Make an entire video on Kickin' It and another on Mighty Med and Lab Rats. Those 3 shows weren't necessarily forgotten, but they were fire.
It stands for extra Disney and was a popular face thing people used to type XD
I remember lab rats! I remember that episode where the robot went evil and almost drowned someone in corn flakes or something.
I loved I'm in the Band
That sponsorship aged like wine.
I remember a lot of these 😅 but remember that one show that didn’t last long called shezow where a boy turns into a super hero girl that one a lot of people forgot
I loved pair of kings when I was younger ,  though I forgotten about it after many years. I didn't like the change but the show still entertained me, it was so goofy ah that it worked.
Did you perhaps do any sort of research into established titles ??? I’m still a scam
Oof that established titles sponsor
Kinda bummed that you ended up partnering with Established Title's, it's sketchy as all hell. They are a company located in Hong Kong who claim to have land in Scotland (but they really provide no proof), and Scotland has even had to come out and say "Hey, just because these schemes sell you land, doesn't make you a Lord or Lady". Also, they haven't provided any proof that they actually have planted any trees,
Crash and burnstein is a great hidden gem
Crash and Bernstein was always my favorite!
Still can’t believe Disney plus doesn’t have wander over yonder
Crash and burnstine oh oh the memories
can you make a vid about pen zero part time hero?
It’s hilarious that this was the video what was recommended to me after watching a video exposing how Established Titles was a Scam.
Hey Mark, I haven’t seen people really mention this, and I’m not sure how NDA’s with sponsorships work, but Established Titles is getting exposed as an scam, there are some good videos describing the situation but the main idea of Established Titles, being a lord or lady, isn’t all that true. I hope you research this and cut ties with them, sorry if this comment is a bit messy.
Lol
So you just scammed us
How does it feel to have been promoting a scam to your audience this whole time?
If I had a nickel for every time I've seen LS Mark make a 2 nickels joke, I'd have two nickels. Which admittedly isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice.
I was obsessed with Zeke and Luther and Pair of Kings.
Nah Pickle & Peanut was good😭
Pickle and peanut was my show to get high to
Yea I would really like to know where pair of kings is??🥱😩
The most forgotten Disney xd show is problems I’m in the band
Men I will never forgive them for cancelling Jetix for Disney XD
Established titles is a scam. A video blew up about it a few days after this came out
Established titles is a horrid scam company, dont be a fucking pig and do your due diligence on your sponsors.
6:12 Ginger business woman
I loved Disney XD i also loved that channel called the hub It was also called something else but it had shows like dan vs
DUDE, BE CAREFUL OF ESTABLISHED TITLES, apparently that company is a scam!!
See pair of kings was fire to me as a king and was one of my favorite shows on Disney xd and I started to re watch it and nothing but nostalgic feels but when mitch got tossed to the side I just completely stopped watching it
I KNOW THE 7D IS GONE NOOOOOO😢
I remember when Crash and Bernstein first aired.  It had funny moments, and looking at it now, it's still decent.    The show never got the proper series finale it deserved, and honestly, Disney XD is something I don't watch anymore because of how neglectful Disney is, I don't care much about them.
I think XD was the XD laughing symbol
Mark please don’t promote this scam site again. I urge you to properly do research on them before you make the choice to sponsor them again
Funny how A ninth grade ninja, a blue hedgehog, and a duck triplet all have the same voice actor
There is no ScrewAttack, Mark. Death Battle assimilated it to gain its power.
Why do you talk like that
What's the show at 14:45
Disney XD have one show that you not going to think motor city interested in that pal 😏
Crash and Bernstein is goated
I binged pickle and peanut when it came out on Disney plus. It just brought back good memories
years ago when i was a tiny lil tater tot i watched this show called “right now kapow” and i LOVED it. it sadly only lasted one season and i never got to see it again. this video was a reminder that it exists and i re-visited what video clips there were for free, loved it just as much as i did before.
Just as a heads up, the established titles thing is a scam, it’s all over Twitter now
Lol didn't establish titles just get caught for being a massive scam
Mark you sold out established titles is a scam do you research before promoting shit like this
Absolutely hated pickle and peanut
Disney XD introduced me to to my favorite cartoon amphibia
All I have to say is Disney XD IS NEVER FORGOTTEN.
Ngl, the Crash and Bernstein gag with him taking money from her purse made me bust out laughing
Alright the only complaint i have is you ragging on the gamecube controller. It works on all the modern Nintendo's and is still most ppls preferred controller.
My favorite Disney XD show is Aaron Stone, and I feel like Disney also tries to forget this show existed because its not even on Disney+. This and Tower Prep are two live-action shows i feel like their respective studios are just trying to sweep under the rug but are actually some of the best shows the networks have produced.
your twitter and twitch is gone, I hope you are ok Mark
Pickle and Peanut is supposed to be watched high. Like Mr. Pickles
Kirby Buckets?
What is the show at 14:45???
I aged out really fast and I think the only one of these I caught was Randy Cunningham.  Also I can't tell if I always tuned in late, or somehow completely forgot how bad the theme song was lol
Lab rats is fire
I used to like pickle and peanut (somehow)
Disney XD be like:      Established Titles is a charity service that allows you to become a "lord" or "lady" by purchasing a plot of land in Scotland. That's what the company wants you to think, because this is all completely made up. You can't legally sell or buy land in Scotland. Not only that, but the company is based in Hong Kong, not Scotland. I understand why people are accepting their sponsorships, they just want to help the planet. But this has been proven to be a scam, and I want something to be done about it.
Oh man I loved Disney XD. Also rip the sponsorship
Guys ESTABLISHED TITLES IS A SCAM please do not purchase it it is a scam you get litterally nothing but it costs hundreds of dollars please don't buy it or if you do buy it do research first
PICKLE AND PEANUT IS GOATED
Toon Disney is better then Disney XD
I was that pair of kings stan as a kid I loved it. It legit made my scream and cry and hype and all the emotions. And I immediately stopped watching when Brady was gone
Mark, I gotta say it. Establishment titles is a scam. When you guy land, you don’t officially get land in Scotland, just in the eyes of establishment, same with being a lord, your offficail name isn’t lord now, it’s only officially lord to again establishment
I just realized that most of the shows on this list’s names just use the name of the main character(s)
The funny thing is that Mitchel Muso and Adam Hicks both released those songs on the same day, on October 28th this year. Well at least on spotify it is the same date.
I definitely forgotten about Pair of Kings, used to love it
One thing that was kinda cool about Disney XD was how after Toonami ended in 2008, Naruto Shippuden moved to Disney XD. And for a while they also showed Doraemon, which as someone who spent his childhood living in Asia but then teen years in the US and Canada, was odd but cool for me to see because before then nobody else I knew in North America knew what Doraemon was haha
To answer your question about Pair of Kings fans opinion on the "casting change" I still wish they kept Mitchell because even though his character was just dumb guy #2  I think he just brought a little more charm to the character than his replacement did. At that point when they replaced him, I had watched Zeke and Luther sometimes so it was weird seeing , what my kid brain thought was still just Zeke, becoming a king.  As an adult I still remember Pair of Kings fondly because as a little girl the story sucked me in and it basically had my perfect dumb sense of humor at the time.
""ownership of a souvenier plot of land does not bring with it the right to any description suhc as 'laird', 'lord' or 'lady'."" you legally cannot own an area as small as 1sqft. they are just selling you souveniers that do not equate to owning the land they have no proof they actually plant trees to help reforestation and none of them are irish. its a chinese company based in hong kong .   please dont take sponsorships from established titles. they are a scam. you are just paying for a certificate and pretending to own a square foot of land. all of the money goes straight to them.
You might be too young to remember a show on nickelodeon called cousin Skeeter but the whole puppet and human best friend shit is old and actually worked in that show
I SWORE Crash and Bernstein existed but none of my friends remembered it, I swore I was the only one who ever watched it lol. Glad it's being remembered
Established Titles Is a Scam Please Watch a Video by Scott Shafer to Understand The Full Situation. Even SomeOrdinaryGamer Talk About It.
I completely forgot about goodie two shoes, memory unlocked
The only ones I know are Lab Rats, Kickin' it, and Mighty Med.
Disney XD was goated, this guy acting surprised that kids shows don’t have good storylines lol
Mark, established titles is a scam, they are not what they seem
Pickle and peanut will always be remembered in my heart as a fucking love that show
Crash and Bernstein was the best.
Randy Cunningham is STRONGLY embedded in my mind and I absolutely love it😂
XD stands for a facial expression
I watched like 2 shows on Disney XD, penn zero and randy Cunningham. I miss penn zero and sadly it’s not on Disney+, the second one is though
FINALLY SOMEONE GIVES CRASH N BERNSTEIN THE CREDIT IT DESERVES!!!🥹🫡
I just came from blue face and crissean rock slander to pure nostalgia. I love YouTube
Randy Cunningham 9th Grade Ninja reminded of shows like Danny Phantom and Jake Long The American Dragon  which is funny because all three of them look like a little bit 😂
Just watched a video about how established titles is a scam, how ironic
pickle and peanut is just a high budget yt shitpost but on cable and I loved it lol it mustve been hell on earth to try and green light something so bizarre
Crash: face slam
Disney XD is like the only other channel I watched apart from Nick, I loved Pair Of Kings, Crash & Bernstein, I'm In The Band and Zeke and Luther (plus a lit of cartoons on it but mostly them), even tho I cringe at some of these shows now I still even come back and watch them, when Paid Of Kings got rid of Brady I refused to watch the channel for awhile cause I hated the commercial they played to advertise the replacement of Brady, I even wrote a fanfic of when he came back and him and Mikayla lol. Idk why I loved these shows so much and why I still hold them close to heart but I do
Established titles is a scam, can't wait for these YouTubers to quietly step away from it after the realization😂😂😂😂😂
Motorcity ☹️☹️
Pair of kings was ok lol
I loved Disney XD and watched every single episode of Pair of Kings. I'll never forgive Disney for dropping Mitchell Musso from the show. Doc and he had such great chemistry. When He was replaced by Adam I knew the show was doomed from that point forward. I'll give the show 7/10 as a whole though. but a solid 8/10 if it was just Mitchell and Doc
I remember hating the pair of kings change too
Ginger white boy rapping about taking problems to the streets
ah man seeing thurston made me sad😭
17:00 , (look at the book cover ) possibly an Easter egg to invader Zim ?
i miss crash and berstein 💔
Mark you gotta make a apology video about established titles, they uh did some stuff
Rest in peace thurston
you forgot "Billy Dillie's Super-Duper Subterranean Summer"
Hey Mark just wanna let you know Established titles has been outted as a scam company thought you should know
1:32 R.I.P. Thurston
Fun fact: my parents went to school with Tim Lagasse, apparently he’s always been really talented
Hey you need to not support Established Titles. They actually are a scam and can’t legally give you the title of Lord or Lady. I’d research it because it’s incredibly sketchy. Especially the “land” you are “buying”.
😭I was a pair of kings hardcore fan AND I LOVED THE THEME SONG!!!
Fun fact: Mitchel Musso is trying to bring pair of kings back
When he mentioned he was from Ireland I instantly heard the accent….
I don’t appreciate the pickle and peanut slander 😠, the intro is a while bop
Fish hooks would’ve been cool
21:38 sad world clip W
Pickle and Peanut was not forgotten, it’s gross humor is certainly memorable.
Crash and berstien was the best change my mind
17:48 Random Kris Kross reference
I also enjoyed 9th grade ninja.
what about the qubo shows?
What’s that show  at 14:45
i REALLY liked crash and bernstein as a kid. this vid was like memory lane lol
I always thought that the XD just stood for eXtra Disney
5 year old me loved watching crash and Bernstein I wish they still made the show I love the nastalgia to on the show
I remember one time my older sister got offended by Crash & Bernstein. I wish I was joking
Poor Adam Hicks, he played a great character in Lemonade Mouth
crash and Bernstein's humor is the perfect level of unhinged I'm gad you put it that way, it was my favorite show as a kid
The Crash and Bernstein theme is just an ICP song
Gonna need a part 2
I ironically like Pickle and Peanut.
This video didn't age well, what with all the Established Titles drama.
My dad actually worked for Disney/DisneyXD. He always said the staff said it meant Disney Xtra Disney, a continuation of Disney(Disney Extra Disney)
Watched a couple of your videos before, was probably gonna subscribe. Then I heard, "I'm just waiting to hear Crash getting arrested in Burbank" immediate subscribe
Usually XD in films means the directors cut
who remembers kirby buckets?
Ooof on the Established Titles sponsorship.  That's a scam.
Disney XD replaced JETIX, Not Toon Disney.
That dude really is a major dick for going around pointing guns at people.  Maybe give him a few more years before you think he’s good because that’s EXTREME.
theres was another show called two more eggs that NO ONE even remembers airing on disney XD
NO! Not Established Titles!!!!
I remember when Disney XD had the rights to the Pokémon show
I wouldn’t let these guys sponsor you anymore dawg
Steve the llama from Disney XD is one of my favorite things, my whole family calls random llamas Steve now
Eso brad
It’s a scam
Hi Mark. Great video! I wanted to let you know that Established Titles is very sketchy. I recommend watching Scott Shafer's video "Established Titles Scam -YouTube's BIGGEST Con! Graham Stephan & Andrei Jikh".
I will never forget Randy Cunningham
Oh boy oh boy I sure do hope a fake LS Mark scam account replies to this comment
Established titles is actually a scam, they do a good job at fooling people into thinking they are credible. A lot of YouTubers have made videos about it. They are very sketchy. I don’t blame you for thinking they are legit enough to do a sponsorship
You should’ve mentioned Big hero 6 the series, it’s so good but it’s literally so forgotten by everyone😭 It got cancelled after season 3
Omfg I REMEMBER ALL OF THESE I FORGOT ABOUT HALF OF THEM even though a lot of these sucked ass I loved them as a kid
24:24 “So bad it’s good”
Average Bernstein Fan: 🤓  Average Crash Enjoyer: 😎
Also DisneyXD did the first Naruto Shippuden dub (heavily censored) but canceling it because parents said it was too violent.
I just found out from blooms that established titles is a scam
a bumper with jp manoux as his character from aaron stone , stated that xd stands for extreme dimension
What the HELL man. You're going threw the video and not even mention "I'm in the Band" and "Kickin It".
Man I freakin love Pair of Kings. Still love the theme😂 that's the song of my childhood man. I remember being really confused by the change in cast, but while uncomfortable I was really excited thinking their was going to be a grand return for Brady. Sigh
Replaces Jetix*
Everyone forgot these shows accept me
Have you heard o Motorcity, it is a really good Disney XD cartoon that is incredibly underrated and deserves more attention.
one disney xd show i remember vividly that i don't ever see anyone talk about is boyster it's about a boy that's half human half oyster does anyone else remember it
L scam sponsor
2:52 That sponsor is a scam, that company ia not from Scotland, it's from China, and they don't even give you land, they give you some "Plots"
Disney XD stands for “Xtreme Disney” I thought everyone knew that💀💀💀
Might wanna edit the sponsorship out of this vid since it turns out it's a rather viscious Scam that doesn't do any of the things it proports to do
Sponsor is a scam lol 😂
You live in Ireland I live in Ireland to TWINSYS
Wen the pair of kings thing happened I wasn’t aware that actors were actors so I kept watching the show hoping Brady wud come back little did I know
the kanye reference in the 'crash and bernstein' theme song is pretty funny
Forgotton? I could never forget the little gems of my childhood!  (Also why'd you pick the German Zeke and Luther logo?)
Wasn't there like a massive controversy around Established titles?
All I remember from Zeke and Luther is Zeke and Luthor where Lex Luthor replaces Luther in order to win a prize of 1000 dollars because being a millionaire isn't enough
How did bro never mention kickin it?
Wow established titles lol I just watched a video about this. Don’t sweat btw they lied to everyone
DOES ANYBODY REMEMBER KIRBY BUCKETS AND DORAEMON???
Hey Mark, You know that established titles is a scam right? You can't become a lord or lady by purchasing souvenir plots of land. They don't have any record of donating to charity and it's basically a nft lol. Seriously look into them, theyre sketchy as hell. I dont know if you'll see this but you are promoting a scam.
I used to mostly watch shows that Disney XD owned the airing rights too, like Kid Vs. Kat, Jimmy Two-Shoes (i used to find candaian cartoons neat, most of the time).......and of course Kick Buttowski  Watching this video makes me wish i watched Randy Cunningham 9th Grade Ninja and Crash & Bernstein as a kid, but i didn't for some reason
I LOVED DISNEY XD !!! it’s so nice seeing people actually remember pair of kings, crash and berstein, kick buttowski, and wonder over yonder !!!! i also loved lab rats and kickin’ it :)
Pickle and peanut was fire a little gross tho 😭
Pickle and peanut was fire a little gross tho 😭
Dear LS Mark, PLEASE read this comment. Established Titles is a SCAM. To get the full story, please watch Scott Shafer or Valiskibum’s video!
I started gravitating towards Disney XD once Suite Life On Deck on Disney Channel was coming to a close. My friends & I even wrote 2 fan fic triple show crossovers. Zeke & Luthor Are Kickin' It With The Pair of Kings then Lab Rats Are Kickin' It With The Pair of Kings. This was our response to That So Suite Life Of Hannah Montana & Wizards On Deck With Hannah Montana
My fav lone in Pair of Kings was when James Hong's character said "Wrong again wring guy." I still quite that to this day 🤣
I remember that disney XD was HUGE in latin america. to the point where it lasted quite longer than in the US. going off the air just this year
I’m glad someone else actually says LOL and LMAO, my family makes fun of me for not doing L-O-L and L-M-A-O
Disney XD was my childhood and Zeke and Luther looked so cool, I used to come from school and literally with Disney XD for hours 🔥❤️ and of course Pheneas and Ferb, Kick Buttowski and mainly Kid vs Kat 😡 it was always on repeat, my favourite Disney XD show was actually Aaron Stone it was fire 🔥👍 I am a Disney Kid 🥰😔
Does anyone remember I'm in the band sitcom? I never see anyone talking about it
You forgot im in the band seriosly am I the only one who remembers that show?
I was a Randy Stan back then ngl
when will you do studio ghibli ranking?
LS MARK I HEARD THAT LISA THE PAINFUL MUSIC.
You may wanna cancel that sponsorship. Lots of other creators have information come to light that the company is a complete scam.
The way you say "now" gives me joy.
My man, I would really cut ties with established titles
15:16 ah this is why in Italy they completely changed the intro, make sense
crash and bernstein is like alf
crash and bernstain is straight out of homestuck.
Crash and Bernstein is an unlocked memory that I forgot about
The XD stands for a laugh
Q:funnier than pickle rick? A:most likely(pickle rick isn't funny).
I was actually one of the testing audience kids for Pickle and Peanut before it aired. I don't think a single kid in that room enjoyed it and I was honestly shocked when I saw it on TV later on
Damn it means nothing I legit thought that shit stood for Extreme Disney
Wish you would’ve talked about Aaron Stone. I’ve never heard anyone talk about it lol.
OMG RANDY CUNNINGHAM 9TH GRADE NINJA??
Bring Brady back... I might watch pair of kings... No promises thou.
For some reason crash and Bernstein was my favourite show when I was like 9
wait wait wait wait wait hold your horses everybody shut the umizoomi front door are we not going to talk about the fact that star vs the forces of evil was probably on Disney XD for only its first season and then it got moved to Disney Channel because I want to talk about this problem because I feel like star vs the forces of evil should have been on Disney XD for its entire run because there was so much more to this show than just simple friendships and hugs and rainbows and puppies
i was lucky enough to grow up with the good animated shows and not corny sitcoms because it really shaped my childhood.
i thought pickle and peanut was dumb fun when i was younger and i personally still like the animation but the actual show is so insanely boring
Sad to see Mark promote scams to us.
When Luther squirted lotion in that guys hand wanting a tip was hilarious
Pickle and peanut is such an iconic gem in my books, me and my brother watched this show on the channel a ton of times years ago
Holy fuck these shows are nostalgic for me. I mostly grew up with Disney channel in the 2000s, but disneyxd was mostly a filler if there wasn’t anything good on. Pair of kings, Crash and Bernstein, Randy, etc all of these shows were great imo.
I always thought the XD was eXtreme Disney... But then I guess that would make it Disney eXtreme Disney
Crash and Bernstein is one of my top 10 favorite shows of all time. It’s SO funny! 😂
1:54 same, I moved to Germany for 4 years and when I came back, suddenly everything was skateboard themed.
If you do another part you have to put two more eggs I always watched it as a kid and for some reason I loved it also that show with people who had shapes for faces are forgot what show that was called.  Edit: just remembered it's called right now kapow
Dude you use the best bgm <3
Established Titles is a scam
Because you chose not to include Kickin it my disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined
I miss crash and Bernstein
I have a hate of Crash & Burnstein because my then girlfriends handicapped brother always tried to imitate the show and headbutt me in the damn mouth
I was just talking to my friends about crash and Bernstein about how everyone remembers it but no one talks about it.
I liked Pair of Kings when I was a kid, it was a funny show, but the last season was pretty bad, Crash & Berstein was something I watched from time to time, mostly because Crash looked like a muppet. On those other shows that were not included, I liked Kickn'it except for the later seasons.
I feel the only show that actually made a name for itself was Gravity Falls. I remember a few other shows being really good but got cut off before they could take off. I always commend Alex Hirsch for all that hard work he put into his show to make sure it didn't get that "Disney XD" fate other shows had. Alex had a clear goal, tried to find every loophole so he could continue without being shut down, and completed a fantastic show.
My brother and i used to sit in the basement and watch pair of kings. I remember 1 episode where someone had evil arm pit hair🤣
I remember Disney xd use to watch it so much
We won ninja bros someone talked about randy cunningham in the year of our lord 2022 for a whole 6 minutes
pucca my beloved...
i loved pair of kings :(
Pair of Kings is still one of the best shows ever, at least until Brady left
I remember everyone of these 😅
I had a dream and in it appeared a snarky purple puppet and then two weeks later Disney revealed Crash and Bernstein and it freaked me the fuck out
I'm glad this channel reminded me that Randy Feltface has an origin story
I know I am only up to the Intro, but I am so glad that you used Tekken 2’s Character Select theme song cuz that song is soooo gooood! I’m guessing you play Tekken, right?
Just so you and anyone who sees this comment knows… Dont buy from established titles theyre a scam that everyones buying into rn and promoting none of its real and they arent even plating trees. L for promoting this shit without doing research
i watched all of these and forgot a few, or just pickle and peanut, but anyways yeah
Isn’t the boy from crash and hawk from cobra Kai, if so I really want to show this to my little cousin bc rn he’s basing his whole personality on hawk. Also what I find funny is the “chorus” of the intro for it “Crash and Bern…stein” bc Damb that really predicted the lifetime of Disney XD
Does anyone remember the nightmare that was 2 More Eggs and CGI Palz? It’s sort of like DHMIS for kids! Ran on the Disney channel...
I remember when naruto was on Disney xd
Pair of Kings is part of my junior high memories and it one of my favorite sitcoms until Brady left the show. It turned to an unfunny mid show after that happened.
Something interesting to point out is that Mitchel Musso was still allowed to voice Jeremy on Phineas and Ferb, even when he was kicked off of Pair of Kings. I guess him just doing some voice acting for a reoccurring character isn't as big of a risk as being the co-lead on a live action production.
Love the content as usual, but you should really look into Established titles a bit further. Scott Shafer made a good video on why they should be avoided as a sponsor.
I actually remember watching every single one of these when they first aired when I was a kid. I really enjoyed all of them (except Pickle and Peanut I was scared shitless of that lmao) but still loved watching every single one of them, fond memories before the dread of graduating High School set in lmao.  Also there are way, waay, WAAAAY More shows you missed so this totally deserves a Part 2 and I would kill to see it!
I hope if mark is gonna do another one of these,that he covers the truly forgotten cartoon "Penn Zero Part Time Hero"
I have a soft spot for Aaron Stone ( and then Lab Rats & Mighty Med —-they really fumbled the spin-off though)…
Pickle and Peanut is just adult swim without curse words, nudity , and (some) adult situations.   Change my mind.
It's cute that you think the cops can stop Crash.
pickle and peanut scared the shit out of me when i was a kid
i used to live randy cunningham 9th grade ninja like a lot
Did anyone tell you that Screw Attack was completely integrated into Rooster Teeth?
crash and bernstein was my favorite 🥲
you should have talked about pen zero part-time hero
I was in 5th grade when crash and Bernstein came out and it was the funniest shit I’ve ever seen crash is definitely based he could body any fictional character
Established titles Is literally a scam. The title of lord is not recognized by the Scottish government
pickle and peanut scared me as a child 😭
Shame on you for being sponsored by established titles they are scam!
Crash and Bernstein was one of my favorite shows when I was younger, it’s always interesting seeing people talk aboutnit
does anyone else remember that in like 2010 DisneyXD would shoe Naruto shippuden and it would last up to hidan and kakuzu
I can’t say I was ever a hardcore Pair of Kings fan, but little me was DEFINITELY surprised and excited when the fish turned into a dude, so much so that that single memory of the show that I have was the reason I watched this video
I want it to be know that I remembered everyone of these shows zeke and Luther the least tho I just remembered two skater dudes
THIS MANS TASTE IN INTROS IS ASS 😂 Pair of Kings and randy cunningham intros are fuckin vibesssss
When I was a kid, I watched pair of kings and was legit upset when Brady was replaced, it just never felt the same and made even 11 year old me just stop watching.
You’re a hater Fr zeke and Luther and pair of kings were good shows
Pickle and peanut ran so apple and onion could fly
P&p is the only show that actually got any type of merch from this list
I'm in the band had a beat em up rhythm game that I was obsessed with as a child and that's all I got out of the channels existence And the pair of kings game as well that was alright Aaaaand the randy cuttingham game
I honestly didn't realize Disney XD was not avaliable on every cable package, my being a kid whose family did shell out for the appropriate package. Which means the channel, like most 2nd or 3rd channels, was actually a bit of a gallows or graveyard for nearly every show on it.
Crash and bernsten will always have a special place in my heart
Bro kicken it wad actually one of my favorite cartoons when i was s kid
This channel was my entire childhood
I loved randy Cunningham and crash and Bernstein growing up. None of my friends remembered tho
I remember when pickle and peanut came on the TV me and my sister were basically puking the whole time. We hated it. And it appeared only once for us so that only added to its horrifying presence.
I only really recall that Randy Cunningham was on in a triple bill with Wander Over Yonder and Fish Hooks, but I do remember enjoying it  And Franz Newkid
💜💜💜😆
Hey just before anyone clicks on the established titles link, don’t. It’s being outed as a scam.
Is flipping Sonic I don't remember his voice sounding like that it's been a while man I am blushing over here in the corner geez I remember when I used to watch that show and I was younger I would have rewatched it if I knew he was the voice actor 🤣
He forgot Star Wars rebels
How dare you I was a sweet little girl I flip and rewatched the show and I love the theme song so much what are you talking about 🤣🤣🤣😭 I would always stand up and dance to it whenever you watched it
I found weird was that I believe Pickle and Peanut were basically the Disney XD mascots for XD Japan. I remember seeing the bumpers playing right before the Japanese XD shut down on YouTube and remember seeing so much Pickle and Peanut popping up.
Bisarvark was one of the funniest shows I've ever seen
Hey just so you’re aware, Established Titles is a scam! Legally speaking Scotland does not allow such small plots of land to be bought and sold off as well as the fact owning land doesn’t allow you to call yourself Lord or Lady. They claim to plant trees with the money but have provided no proof of actually doing so.   They’re own by Chinese company called Fail Ventures that’s based out of Hong-Kong
rch9n is a really good show. its a magical boy show in disguise dont ever glance over it.  also there was a lot of episodes where randys identity is at stake. its a really good show and i think it would be also better for a 22 minute run time instead of an 11 minute. its definitely american boys precure
Do a video about kick putouscy
God how DARE you remind me of the abomination that was Pickle and Peanut
If I had a nickel for every pair of kings star that got arrested in burbank, then came back in 2022 with a music career I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it's happened twice right?
I loved Disney XD as a kid
Crash and Bernstein is peak fiction
Does anyone remember Slug Terra from Disney XD? It was my jam when I was 13.
I loved Zeke and Luther
Crash and Burnstein lives in my nightmares
Funny video.
Lol I recognized all of these. I loved Pair of Kings
I still get Disney XD on my Nanas TV She also has this really old channel called boomerang that had like Looney Tunes and stuff  idk how she still has these 😅
Ngl as a kid crash from crash and Bernstein scared me as a kid
There was a show called future worm which was completely forgotten as well
I think you skipped over slugterra
I grew up loving every show on this list. (Except Pickle and Peanut, that show traumatized me…) I’ve seen every episode of all of them, and it’s honestly just fun to watch when I was younger. I may watch them again thanks to you now lmao
New here nice content
Cousin Skeeter did the whole puppet best friend of a human thing way better.
Saying jail like that is a crime upon itself
Bro Crash and Bernstein was the shit when i was a kid
Crash and Bernstein was one of those shows which I watched just cause it felt very... Relatable? Ig? Like not that I'd ever go through any of this stuff, but how Bernstein felt about his sisters, how crash rearranged the buttons on a keyboard cause they were all mussed up, having to explain to your friends why you don't celebrate Christmas. It just felt nice and the energy kept me entertained (also the movie had no right to be as fun as it was)
I hated the character change in Pair of King and I really like that show as a kid
If tennis is a sport skating is definitely a sport
Man I feel old
Pair of kings a classic idc
Crash & Bernstein was one of my favorite shows when I was little
I remember the crash show but I only remember him getting sick all over the place
I really enjoy Jimmy two shoes and pickle and peanut was really bad that’s why I liked regular show better and is crash and Bernstein is like a extreme version of cousin skeeter
Idk why but loved Kickin'It
I only watched disney xd for: Phineas and Ferb, Gravity falls, milo murphy and Lab rats before it was bad
established titles is a scam please do not buy this
I fell off of the channel itself on its switch to XD after Toon Disney and Jetix
I remember when the channel actually got made, and a whole bunch of shows from a different channel (I can’t remember the name, but it was  what the X in XD stood for) we’re running on it. Slowly XD just became “rad “ Disney instead of a mix of the two channels, but damn there were a lot of shows I legitimately loved watching as a kid form here, and pretty much all of them were animated. Hell I remember a really old one I believe was called Monster Buster Club that aired around the beginning of the channel’s existence. It was basically just a 3d animated monster of the week show with the premise revolving around aliens, and a group of kids helping to stop them. I doubt it would be good now, but I fondly remember that show.
Crash defiantly fucks
I just put it on from time to time to watch previously ended or cancelled shows 😭
using lisa music in the segment about pickle and peanut is an odd one, but it fits
Zeke and Luther was my shit back in the day… mostly because I started skating around when it came out so I felt like it was made for me
Damn, I guess Aaron Stone is so forgotten that it wasn't even mentioned.
Bro I think I found my wife after checking out the Adam Hicks Chosen One music video lol. Shawty that played his girl bad af thank you for putting me on bro lmaooo
DisneyXD just dumped shows that got canclled there some people knew them like the the goat( Phineas and Ferb) and then we got some random show here like kid vs kat WHO THE HELL IS KID AND KAT thats why i never watched any disney shows when i grew up except Phineas and Ferb that shows was badass This is why nick and cartoon network were good we actually got shows we knew like Hey arnold and Spongebob
It's weird that ONLY 2 Disney stars went to prison and not all but 2.
I remember watching Crash and Bernstein! It was my favorite series, kinda bummed that it ended on a cliffhanger and the spin off pilot episode didn’t air. I’m glad it’s on Disney+ so I can rewatch every episode. I hope someday they might bring it back as a sequel series where Wyatt and Cleo are in college, Jasmine is in middle or high school and Amanda is married, Pesto being the manager at the arcade, and Crash trying to figure on what he wants to do or become in his life setting up the spin off series at the end of the series.
18:17 No god pls no dont remember me of that dumpster fire
Rc9gn actually has a pretty decent fanbase.
Nice Street Fighter III music in the background
I need a forgotten cartooon network shows
Disney xD was My childhood.
I loved crash and bern it was my favorite show as a kid😅
I know this is going to start a little bit of controversy but the first show that comes to mind when I think Disney XD is Gravity Falls the second is Randy Cunningham and the third is Phineas and Ferb
I was the biggest stan of mitchel musso when I was younger like he was the actual love of my life
I'm in the band is like a old fever dream to me. The only thing I remember is that it existed and they had cheap version of Ozzy Osborne. But apparently children propaganda works, ten years passed and I'm obsessed with this satanic music
Remember crash and Bernstein being in a really funny show when I was a preteen
oh and funny story about pickle and peanut i genuinely gave a guy head while it was playing in the background
I loved Crash and Bernstein because I thought it was funny
i genuinely loved disney XD as a young girl i know it was catered to me but it always made me feel like i was one of the cool ass teen boys. i loved zeke and luther, crash and berstein and pair of kings. zeke and luther will always have such a special place in my heart though
dude i remember my mom loooooved crash and berstein it was the only kids show she actually enjoyed LMAO
The episodes probably didn’t air out of order. That’s probably just how they are listed on the streaming service. Because for whatever reason, every streaming service has to mix up the order of every episode of every series that originally aired on TV.
I was the hardcore pair of kings fan when I was younger, I got better when I discovered gravity falls. Didn't see the third king added to the cast but I'd probably have been all over it as a kid.  Also the Brazilian version of Randy Cunningham's intro song is so much better it's not even funny.
Definitely stopped watching after Brady left 🙅‍♂️
I remember when Crash and Bernstein was on Netflix. Yea I’m one of THOSE people I guess.
honest to god my tv doesn't leave disney xd. until miraculous ladybug comes on and then it's cartoon network for an hour
I actually found the last seasons of Pair of Brothers better then the first seasons
Disney XD used to be jetix
also im not afraid to admit  enjoyed crash and burn.. one of my favs also  growin up lmao.. still hurts i waited for so long to till i found out the show was canceled
I only remember watching Crash and Bernstein JUST for Oana Gregory. I... uhh, still follow her on Instagram.
seeing pair of kings after so long.. nostalgic actually had fond memories with the show.. before i became tech savvy
I know, established titles is a *scam* you see, you're paying for micro land, not a real land
What’s crazy about Kickin’ It is that every episode they killed off a character until there was no one left in the dojo
It worked on me
In Pair of Kings, I always thought the gringer was goofier than the black haired one. He just felt more physical comedic than the other one which threw me off guard
I like to think that randy cunningham is canon to invader zim universe
I remember when XD premiered in nz, I was up at 6:00am for the first episode of mighty med to air.
I hope the follow-up includes Motorcity! I'm mourning that show. It only got one season, but my god, what a season it was. It was really popular with college students for a reason.
It's weirding me out just how many channels I'm subscribed to are sponsored by Established Titles...
I actually liked Randy Cunningham’s and Pair of Kings’ theme songs
14:09 Jimmy Two-Shoes wasn't meant for adults, even in the dark as hell early concept, it was always meant for children from the very start
I thought the XD stood for Extra Disney which sounds dumb but made more sense than nothing i guess
Wait your from Ireland? I would have never guessed from your accent
The only one I ever watched was The Thundermans. Nobody talks about The Thundermans.
Pickle and peanut is a great show to watch while tripping balls
A separate video on Kickin It, Lab Rats and Mighty Med is needed. These were the Gems on DisneyXD I was always waiting for.
I remember when I was living in Washington back in 2009, I saw tons of DisneyXD commercials, and I faintly remember that the channel and its shows were supposed to be geared towards young teens, as it had more "mature" programs. And not as in violent, but as in it had Big Kid humor and slightly more serious tones with the overall story. I also remember it had so many damn reruns of Kick Buttowski lmfao, to this day I still know that theme song by heart just because of those reruns lmao. Anyways because of those memories, whenever I think about DisneyXD, I think about how happy I was as a kid and how rainy Washington state was all the time. Thank you for the memories, DisneyXD.
I loved crash n bernsteinnnn
'Calls Pair of Kings' theme song bad.' Disliked. Reported. Blocked.  'Calls Randy Cunningham's theme song bad.' Okay, you have a point.
"Whenever Randy spoke, I could only hear Sonic."  Bro, Dewey Duck popped in my head immediately.
Now forgotten Cartoon Network shows like Incredible Crew
26:25 That actually WAS the lost pilot Mark
My mom taught Bernstein in high school
24:31 💀
I liked pair of kings and not too long watched all of zeke and Luther just cause  my question is this: how come no one talks about Aaron Stone? Did something happen that I am not aware of?
Does anyone think it was weird that Mitchel Musso lost his part on Pair of Kings but was able to keep his role on Phineas and Ferb? Gusse, with it being a voice, it wouldn't matter.
Not forgotten + the only channel I’ve watched
Can we please have an Iron Weasel comeback?
Crash and burn🎶
Seeing you reference regular show makes me want to beg for you to rank every single episode of regular show
No one remembers "Fishbone" or something like that?  That show was forgotten crazy
I dunno I remember pickle and peanut getting funnier as it went on
Can confirm that when that fish was gonna return to his human form it was pretty hype, I think it even had a timer countdown for the episode
PAIR OF KINGS THEME SONG WAS FIRE😭😭💔
i loved 2010 disney XD so much
Disney XD was my childhood. I love almost all of these shows
as a homosexual, I love crash and bernstein the show was unexpectedly great I’d always watch it. Show shouldve gone for 13 seasons and a movie smh
I’m sorry but I genuinely loved crash and burnsiten. I now see that crash is incredibly based and I love him even more.
Pair of Kings was solid too🙏🏽
Zeke and Luther was a pretty solid show🤙🏽
Crash and Bernstein and Kickin it was my shidd, used to stay up until like 1-3 am just to watch reruns of it. They're not that great, but good enough as a youngin with nothing to watch
I remember every single one of these shows and I have no idea why.   Also, you forgot about *Fish Hooks*
I used to love crash and Bernstein. I completely forgot about that show
Crash could definitely take Goki
oh my god my very first fanfiction was zeke and luther!! We had these image prompt things in year 5 english and mine was a skateboard, hospital and something else that I don't remember, so I stole an episode plot but ended it in a twist about zeke breaking his neck by flying off his board and completely eating shit.  The only ones who have read it is me, my teacher and probably the rats at some landfill they dump all the old work at but it's still really embarassing...
Pls do a part 2 with kickin it I genuinely want to know your opinion on it
Say what you want, I freakin loved the Randy Coningham theme song.  Also loved Crash and Bernstein
at the beginning disney xd was a very shitty channel. the shows were bad, took some years to finally relase good things. me already an old man of 27 cant stand when young people say shit like im in the band is part of their childhood
Tbh, I remember loving Pair of Kings and this show having a impact in me realize I’m gay because the girl was cute and then seeing Girls like Girl by Hayley Kiyoko and seeing her and the girl from ant farm and was losing my mind 🤣🤣
The Chess episode is one of the best in Randy Cunningham
I’m just here to say: Kickin It was and still is a banger.
The fact that you forgot about Fish Hooks shows it should be on this list...
Crash and Bernstein used to be my shit, I am so happy I still find it funny
Forgotten and I've seen them all
I feel for the Non Cool Kids of Disney, like Bernestein, the Mighty Med boys, Eddie from Kickin' It, and a few others, and hope they're doing well in their very normal lives.
4:54 wtf the twins of ahs Murder House were in Zeke and Luther?
Disney XD bad. TooNDisney was the absolute goat.
Crash and Bernstein was one of my favorite shows as a kid i don’t know why 🤣 and honestly I still think it’s good
I'm sexually attracted to Crash
This is Legit the first time I've seen a video like this focusing on media i remeber from my teenage years. In canada it was more expensive or just impossible to get channels like were in the states so i grew up watching YTV until DisneyXD became a thing on our basic cable package out of the blue. Genuinely Loved both pair of kings and crash and bernstein. I was so obsessed with crash and bernstein that i became hyperfixated on puppeteering for a hot second. Thanks for giving the spotlight to some of the most recent childhood i had
i remember c&b, forgot the name, been looking for it for years, thank you kindly sir
1:20 The funny thing is that they stopped doing that. I guess they ran out of money to pay for it.        I still love and watch disney XD…
Still wish Disney+ would put I’m in a band on there.
all of this was my childhood i hated some of the disney channel shows so then i would just always change the channel to disney XD cause the shows were more funny and interesting
Is that cartoon if so what's the name of this 14:45
I was 14 when pair of kings game on, didn't watch it after the red head came on the show wasn't the same.
Bro why are you promoting established titles it litterally a scam bro
thurston!!!
Lab Rats, Mighty med, and the combo were covered by another youtuber, but they're still pretty forgotten none the less
Fun fact, Zeke and Luther got the first ever 3rd party Roblox promo event
I loved Disney xd
Rank every phineas and ferb episode please
You should make a video on Kirby Buckets next
EPIC
I grew up with Zeke and Luther, Pair of Kings, Kick buttowski, I'm in the Band, Slugterra and whatever Fort Boyard was, and other disney XD shows and damn, I miss them now. I want to go and do a rewatch of Pair of Kings or Kickin' It now for absolutely no good reason. They bring me back to when I was 9-12 🥲
When did they add Zeke and Luther?! It was the first thing I looked for when I got D+ and it wasn’t there!
15:06 I have never disagreed so much
Pls do elite force and other stuff, I love disney XD even to this day. I really don’t hope it ends but still pls review it
I didnt grow up watching Disney but i do remember some of the sitcoms like Shake It Up and Dog With A Blog. Maybe i should give Crash and Bernstein a watch since i like puppetry like this. It seems like a funny show
The schafrillas reference in this movie is crazy
I stopped watching Disney XD almost 5 years ago. Similar to Nicktoons it was a fun channel for new shows, but then later showed nothing but reruns from the main channel.
what about Yokai Watch.
Zeke UND Luther
I remember watching Randy Cunningham,Pickle and Peanut and Crash and Bernstein and Slugterra on that channel.What a nostalgia and thank you very much LS Mark for making this video and bring the memories back
I fucking love crash and Bernstein that show slaps
Around this time I was not a Disney person but my younger brother loved it. Because of him I watched this channel in high school and for some reason pair of kings always stuck with me and was one of my favorites.
Fuckin loved Crash and Bernstein
Hey look, a video that doesn’t take literally half a day to watch. Cool.
My top shows from Disney XD are definitely Lab Rats, Mighty Med, and Randy Cunningham. But does anyone remember that fever dream of a show walk the prank…?
8:03 when you visit a foreign country once and make it your whole personality
crash and bernstein is genuinely funny idc
Pickle and peanutbutter is regular show x amazing world of gumball
No way Crash and Bernstein came out in 2012 I remember watching it when it first came out.
Am I only the mf who likes randy
yo, you know that sponsor is a scam site riiiight? haha..
He sounded like benson @ 19:53 lmao
The most ironic thing about Pickle and Peanut is that even though it was one of the most hated shows on the network. It was the ONLY Disney tv show (Not Star Wars Rebels or Spider-Man) that had a decent amount of merchandise. Not Star vs, not Milo Murphy, not even the dick sucked Gravity Falls, had plushies, bags, keychains, candy and more. Disney Japan really ate that shit up.
I never forgot about pickle and peanut
Screwattack doesn't own Death Battle anymore and idk if they even still exist
I think Randy Cunningham is currently the only major character ben Schwartz has played who's primary color isn't blue
Is that fucking Randy Feltface?
Just found out that all of my favorite Disney shows were from Disney XD...nice
I watched all of these except pickle and peanut that’s when I dipped.
Dude Adam looks like Todd from breaking bad now
Honestly I thought Kick Buttowski was underrated
Randy Cunningham isn't forgotten they aired episodes not so long ago  Edit: Kirby Buckets is way more forgotten
The cadence at the end of every one of your sentences is so fucking annoying, you stretch the final syllable of every phrase with occasional uptalking. Your content is good though.
Kick bittowski was the shit
You grew up in ireland yet dont sound irish where ye from?
CRASH AND BURNSTIEN
I also grew up in Ireland and grew up on Disney XD
Whats that name of the Show,with the guy how is playing the main character in A video game in real life
Also I am now really depressed they took the website off so now the only version of it is in Canada and it’s a shell of its former self thanks a lot Disney for ruining our childhood even more your pr#cks
I'm surprised you didn't talk about Aaron Stone, aka the show that Disney tried to replace Power Rangers with.
in one of my theories the XD means This 😂 yeah XD actually was the laughing crying emoji before it came out
I was the kid who like pickle and peanut lol i was so fucking retarded!
I feel like DisneyXD was their response to Toonami
Fun fact: Pickle and Peanut was a massive success on Japan and was the face of the channel until the last days of it.
14:44 What show is that
Disney XD was fire. Nobody can change my mind
Way off on Pickle & Peanut....legit the funniest show Disney has ever made.  No irony.
As a kid I LOVED Crash and Bernstein and my dad absolutely hated it
Randy Cunningham was one of my favorite shows of all time. I honestly loved Disney XD, though a few of the shows to me were dumb nonsensical nonsense, so I didn’t watch it 24/7. It was like a second Cartoon Network to me, just owned by Disney with a few good live action shows.
Even though I never loved Pickle and Peanut. I have always appreciated it. I have always loved the art style, liked how weird it is and I actually really like the theme song (something I know most people don't). I also see pickle and peanut as too strange and it got too much hate at that time from the animation community for me to ever see it as a forgotten Disney xd cartoon. I think that honor should really be given to penn Zero Part-Time Hero. No one ever mentions that show which is sad as even though i never watched it that much when I did I quite liked it. The concept was really cool and it was quite solid, but I think it got overshadowed by way better stuff airing at the same time so I never saw anyone talk about it.    Also thanks for mentioning Crash and Bernstein I always thought that show was a weird fever dream. As I have never seen anyone ever discuss it. I would mostly watch it if nothing else was really on as it's overly bro and overly rad energy kind of made me feel a bit off. But there is this one episode that always stuck with me. Crash becomes writes a self-help book about being lazy with zero words in it and everyone treats it as if it is the deepest thing ever, and he becomes a best-selling novel. And yeah I remember finding that episode weirdly funny as a kid and it stuck with me for some reason.
I did a brief stint working as production staff on a DisneyXD show from 2014-2015, but not one that was mentioned in this video (Gaming Show In My Parents Garage). It always throws me for a loop when I see a video about the channel and then I realize that was 8 YEARS ago. Holy crap.
Sorry girls but Disney XD is for the BOYYYYSSS
I loved crash and Bernstein man
That sponsor completely ruins the video
Mark how do you not mention Musso’s role as Jeremy Johnson from Phineas amd Ferb
RIP to the shrimp god Thurston
I am him, I was the big fan boy of DisneyXD, I was indeed in the edge of my seat during the dark side of the pair of kings, no one ever explains that to a kid either, so I was just wondering where Mitchel Musso went when he was frequently on Disney shows, I did not watch after the change though. Loved Crash and Bern... Stein.
Where is the gaming show in my parents garage
holy shit that's why they replaced the guy in the pair of kings? When I was a kid I always wondered why they removed the guy but never looked into it lol
I like how Mark trashes every show and the comments are like "yaaay I use to love this show" 🤣 makes no sense lol
I used to be a huge Pair of Kings fan, I was hyped for the premiere of the new show when it was being advertised, but when Mitchel Musso got replaced by a new character I stopped watching entirely. I gave him a couple episodes to give him a chance but he had a different style of gross-out humor that I could not get past at the time.
i watched a LOT of crash and bernstein bc it got dumped on netflix
Low Sodium Mark
Its ok Aaron Stone fans one day one day
im in the band was so good!!! they gotta add it to disney plus
Kinda wish you went over Motorcity and Tron. Those were definitely the best Disney XD shows.
Brooo where was wonder over yonder???? That was the shit
I’ve seen C&B. I sadly cannot forget this show. It seared off part of my brain, meaning I will never forget whatever the fuck that show was
Pickle and Peanut was the bomb.
Pickle and peanut is not forgotten it lives on with me every day
established titles is the new raid shadow legends
I TOTALLY FORGOT ABT CRASH AND BERNSTEIN
I was a fanatic for Disney XD. If Cartoon Network wasn’t showing anything I wanted to see, I went straight to there. I need a second part of this, cuz we haven’t gotten to the craziest show out there: Lab Rats. That show had so many layers to it, it was insane
In my opinion, Pickle and Peanut is actually pretty good. I remember watching a few episodes like a year ago and thinking it was pretty funny. As a fan of shows like Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Smiling Friends, the show came off as pretty funny.
Crazy was a fire ass show idgaf
Really wish people would stop promotion Established Titles, it's a scam and is about as legally or morally acceptable as those people who sell you a star or real estate on the moon... No buying lamnd doesn't make you a Lord in Scotland. The fact it's so openly promoted on Youtube when it's nothing more than a scam is honestly outragous
you'd get more than just 2 nickels
i always thought disney XD was far superior to disney channel as a kid. crash and bernstein and kick buttowski were favourites of mine.
You missed motorcity
If you ever do a sequel to this video you should talk about Penn Zero: Part time hero. I don’t remember much about it but I remember it had an awesome finale
Aaron Stone Come on..
Well, I guess calling these shows forgotten isn't wrong. I completely forgot that randy Cunningham and pickle and peanut existed, even though I watched them daily growing up
GOD JUST TALK ABOUT KICK BUTTOWSKY
why do you want EVERYTHING to be innovative and new? everything has already been done before, get off originality's vagina, bro. also, you horrible taste in music.
The only show I seem to remember from my childhood on Disney ds is Randy Cunningham, and those are memories of a good show lol
Wow I sure learned a lot about shows that I don't see anymore
great video, hope for a vol.2 with more shows
bru- wait. i was about to say, " bruh u forgot tron uprising n motorcity" but i dont remember if motorcity is a XD original. but tron its original so yea that
Check out Aaron Stone, a teen action show that was darker than anything Disney made before.
I fkn loved pickle and peanut, it’s so dumb and funny how dare you
I don't know why I clicked on this video expecting Mark to talk about Aaron Stone, and I don't even know why i still remember the name of that show but I don't remember anything else from it lmao
Crash and Bernstein I watched that when I was 10. That was 8 years ago. Man I miss those times
Man I did not remember crash being that crazy  Also a labrats video would be amazing that was my favorite show when I was little
Obviously Mark doesn’t realize that Burbank is where all the famous turned criminals go, it’s the rule.
Used to watch pair of kings as a kid, I fucking hated the hitch change
Bro if you find the crash spin off please make a video and update us because I was a huge fan of the og show n didn’t know their was a spin off made!
I freaking loved crash his show ( even though I had to watch it in the dutch dub that are always awful ) Because it didn't try to be over edgy like most puppet shows like this and it didn't try to be to friendly either  Well still have great messages like short people are overpowered and can't be stopped what ever we do
Pickle and Peanut was the best show on DisneyXD.
Growing up I basically exclusively watched Disney XD, I loved how they had a variety of action packed series compared to the Disney channel which ended up feeling pretty boring in comparison. I didn't have access to CN so Disney XD was the next best thing :)   Btw about pair of Kings, I also disliked the change they made at the time and stopped watching it
You should check Aaron Stone at least here in Latin America, it was the first show that premiered when Jetix ended in 2009 to begin the Disney XD era ( and yeah, our side lost Disney XD just this february, though I am not surprised, since Disney Plus coming to Latin America, that channel was pretty much dead  )
I loved crash and Bernstein it was legitimately my favorite show at the time
Watch kirby buckets I remember watchin it and liking it but not many remember it
I remember all these and loved them all. Disney XD was the best part of my childhood.
HOW COULD YOU SKIP OVER KICKIN IT?!?! 😭 Most underrated Disney show ever.
i dont remember much of randy cunningham but what i do remember is enjoying the show and being invested in randy as a character. idk why but he was just a lot of fun to experience.   fast forward a decade later and now i know why: its just ben schwartz doin his thing only this time with rise of the tmnt's leo. Like put randy and leo side by side and its almost like looking at the exact same person its nuts  (rise fans pls do not come for me i am one of you and im a leo stan i am justified in tearing my blue boy apart ok? /j)
I remember really liking Pair of Kings when it came out. I didn't catch all the episodes but I watched it enough to still care about it when the 3rd season was announced. The whole triplet thing and replacement for Brady was enough for me to not enjoy the show anymore. I think I watched maybe 3 episodes of the season and that was it.
Crash and Bernstein was my favorite as a kid I completely forgot about it until today lol
Who else here actually liked crash and Bernstein?
20:30 be gripping I bet
Crash and Bernstein is one I still remember too. Didn't like it too much, maybe not at all, but still fun.
Aww Thurston 😻
I remember the god damm into to pair of kings now how could you make me remember my 9 year old self
17:50 THAT'S WHY MOVIE SONIC SOUNDED SO FAMILIAR! AND THING IS I BARELY WATCHED 9TH GRADE NINJA; THAT VOICE IS JSUT SO RECOGNIZABLE.
Zeke Und Luther was the name in other countries? Makes sense, but feels too weird
I remember most of these shows. What gets me about Pair of Kings is that they replaced one guy because of his arrest, only for the new guy to get arrested after the show ended. When the second half of Pair of Kings was airing, they never showed reruns with the Brady actor, not even during the marathon up to the series finale. Zeke and Luther was always on at night right up until his arrest too, and then both Zeke and Luther and both halves of Pair of Kings were never shown again. Also I'm in the band still has the same weird liminal nostalgia, as a "watching this showI remember most of these shows. What gets me about Pair of Kings is that they replaced one guy because of his arrest, only for the new guy to get arrested after the show ended. When the second half of Pair of Kings was airing, they never showed reruns with the Brady actor, not even during the marathon up to the series finale. Zeke and Luther was always on at night right up until his arrest too, and then both Zeke and Luther and both halves of Pair of Kings were never shown again. Also I'm in the band still has the same weird liminal nostalgia as Zeke and Luther, as a "watching this show while trying to go to sleep on the weekends" while trying to go to sleep on the weekends".
I remember always watching Crash and Bernstein and unironically laughing sometimes, the show to me still holds up and it's nice to go back after a while and watch a purple puppet with the power of a god, go to an island and meet "Bigfoot".
Dawg ur so nit picky holy shit like u give actual hood criticism sometime but like sometimes u just be hatin on shit to hate on shit like bro it’s a kids show
L take Pair of Kings intro song is fire
Fun Fact: Pickle is played by Jon Heder
All live action shows on there looked cheap.
This channel sucked. The only good stuff were Zeke & Luther, Mr Young (I think it was acquired from Canada), I’m in the Band, Kickin’ It, and Slugterra. I kind of want to check out Aaron Stone. I always thought it was cheap and had an outdated concept when it premiered. I also want to watch Motorcity and the Tron show.   Edit: I also liked the re-runs of 2000s cartoons and shows.
You showed a clip of Yin Yang Yo when you said they had “good original shows” … Yin Yang Yo is from Jetix. It ended in early 2009.
I actually did enjoy crash and Bernstein. It was good fun as a kid
I remember watching Crash and Bernstein only to see the Mom She kinda got it going on
The fact Aaron Stone wasn't even mentioned as something that wasn't even worth mentioning says a lot about it
I would’ve loved if you covered Kickin’ It. I recall watching it all the time as a child and all the characters. Bobby Wasabi is probably still my favorite
What about Aaron Stone
I always thought when I was a kid the XD in Disney XD stood for “X-tra Disney” or “X-tra Dude”
I hate disney xd and everything it stands for
randy Cunningham was just a new spiderman without all the baggage
This, to me as someone who religiously watched all of these shows in my early years is basically equal to those nostalgia compilations. I feel 7 again.
I had a hard time watching season 3 Pair of Kings , I tried only for Lanny but I hate the new king.  Lanny is also the best character in show…
I grew up with DisneyXD cuz my mom wouldnt pay for disney channel (or Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network) so imagine how my brain was blown when i heard some of the shows weren't even from that channel lol
maybr i have a bad taste but has a kid a loved all the live shows
pickle of peanuts appeal is basically being a acid trip
I Absolutely Love all of these Brilliant Disney XD Masterpiece Shows Throughout the Years. Aaron Stone, Kickin' It, Lab Rats, Zeke and Luther, Pair of Kings, Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja, Yin Yang Yo!, Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil, I'm in the Band, Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero, Jimmy Two-Shoes, DuckTales 2017, Wander Over Yonder, Player Select, Mighty Med and all of the Best of the Best Marvel Animated Series, like Spider-Man: The Animated Series (1994), X-Men: The Animated Series, X-Men: Evolution, The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, Marvel's Avengers Assemble, The Spectacular Spider-Man and Marvel's Ultimate Spider-Man are all part of my Life Throughout the Years. I'll miss them all SO much.
Crash and Bernstein was rlly bad ...
I wish you talked about Aaron Stone because it was Disney xd's first show just to know
I assumed that XD was just supposed to be a laughing face emoji.
Man remember when Naruto was on XD
I think yo-kai watch and Inazuma 11 aired on Disney XD
Lol yeah when I was a kid and they replaced brady I swore to never watch that show again and that it was trash lmao
did anyone else remember on disney xd aaron stone and mr young?
HOLY AHIT YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON IVE EVER SEEN TALK ABOUT CRASH AND BERNSTEIN, CRASH AND BERNSTEIN WAS MY WHOLE FUCKING CHILDHOOD
I'm sorry but I tried so.. SO hard to forget Krash and Bernstein 😭 I grew up with only Disney XD sadly, and I hated that show idek why, that throw up scene still lives in my head rent free 💀
I watched camp lake bottom and randy cunning ham a lot
The sponsor is a literal scam
God, I hated pickle and peanut. It was like annoying orange part 2 for me at least.
Never had disney xd, the only reason why I'd try to watch anything from it is because disney had a tendency to move any cartoon show from the main channel onto xd. So, really I was just looking to watch gravity falls in wander over yonder in peace. Don't know why they kept doing that.
The big one I think of when I think forgotten Disney XD shows is Penn Zero Part Time Hero
That crash and Bernstein one was my favorite part. I have never heard anyone mention it. Hearing someone having the same thoughts on it was so satisfying, and accurate. Crash is not a force to be reckoned with
ngl id love to see your opinion lab rats cuz i remember loving the show, but when i go back to it now im like damn this aint as good
LS Mark@ What About Disney XD's Marvel Universe
I loved Disney XD but after they started the gaming YouTube thing I watched it on OnDemand. Most of the things I watched were OnDemand when I thing about it. The Rug Rats, Marvel shows, the Randy Ninja show, and a quite a lot of other things I loved on there are more nostalgic than some Disney Chanel shows. TheRug rats was my favorite live action show and my favorite animated show was The Ultimate Spiderman even though it barely edges out the Avengers show and more original ones like the Randy ninja one but I don’t know why I can’t remember their names. Yes this is a Rant… Edit: I searched it up and my other favorites were Kick Buttowski, Phineas and Ferb, Kickin it, Gravity Falls, Mighty Med, Kirby Buckets, I guess Walk The Prank, Max Steel, and Star War Rebels.
Crash and Bernstein was amazing, I remember dying with laughter when i first saw the football episode
I loved Crash and Bernstein and was really sad after learning it was canceled.
I honestly didn’t know anyone else knew what Zeke and Luther was
Your not the only one Pair of Kings fail off for me when they swapped actors
Lab rats is God tier
One of the twins of pair of kings must be adopted.
Crash and Bernstein was a blip in my childhood
I remember Pickle and Peanut, there was a "Halloween episode" (in quotes because idk if it came out on Halloween) about this guy called nose bleed stealing their shopping trolleys, but there was also a storm going on outside and the TV kept cutting in and out. But at one point the TV cut out for a while and when it went back in there was this really gory security camera footage of some slumped over humunculous stumbling around blasting giant amounts of blood out his nose in a room covered in plastic. Then it cut out again and went back to the normal stuff. It's a really bizarre vivid memory I have, I can't find any proof of its existence (like as a broadcasting error or something) so it probably didn't even happen and I'm just  remembering weird. Pretty wacky tho.   Edit: He's called blood beard and there's a bit they do where they flash a bunch of weird images and one of them is a guy in a leather mask with blood around his mouth and one of those medical circular saws. So that's probably where that came from...
You call these forgotten? I’m still having flashbacks every night.
Damn I forgot pair of king exist
Commando crash didn’t air because chrash’s use in battle was deemed a war crime
I started watching the show again last night
Man I remember loving crash and burnstien as a kid, I wouldn’t expect it to hold up tho, seeing it become ironically funny is not something I expected
Your right LS Mark, i do like pickle and peanut. But not ironically.  Its random but the randomness is consistent with eachother. The you gotta watch the entire show.
Crash and Bernstein was pretty funny from what I remember
Lord sack 2:39
I thought disney XD replaced JETIX?
Hot take: Pickle and Peanut was just as good as Regular Show
I remember all of these, but i didn’t like Pickle and peanut that much
The fact that Pickle and Peanut was a real thing and not just a figment of my imagination kinda haunts me
legit brought back a memory. Me and my dad used to watched Crash and Bernstein when I was younger. Thought it was the funniest shit ever. Might go watch it again with my dad and see if I still holds up with my humor but considering my humor has been decreasing throughout the pandemic it will probably still make me laugh hysterically.
that crash doll gave me nightmares
I have a fucked up story about pair of kings. When i was about 2 i started to have terrible nightmares and that was about 2005 long before disney xd apeard in my country and the nightmare would happen every month. After a few years it started to disapear and one year when it was gone at all a new episode of pair of kings came out so i watched and there was a 1 to 1 copy of the monster that haunted me all life. That night i was having the nightmare again and the monster was just waving at me not attacking me while i was hidding in my dads car
I forgot how much of a menace to society Crash was
The greatest show on Disney XD hands down is American dragon Jake long
Crash and Bernstein was an awesome comedy show, it should’ve had more seasons
Um hey LSMark please watch Vailskibum video on Established titles
I lovvvee Tim Curry. I know that because I have tingles on my back when you said Tim Curry 😭
I never watched Randy Cunningham but I really enjoyed Jordan Fringe’s video on it. And he had some good things to say.
I actually kinda liked pair of kings but when Boz was introduced and Brady left that's when I stopped watching it
I'm sad I like pickle and peanut and now hearing your opinion I feel I should stop watching it which makes me sad to think about
0:30 ok using footage of jessie cropped to 4:3 is such a power move   makes me almost wanna resubscribe
I’m starting to think Aaron Stone is on a new tier of forgotten because it’s always left out of “forgotten” lists. Please I am begging a n y o n e to talk about that show. I believe it was the very first Disney XD original show, and was used to promote the channel before it aired.
I only remember that Zeke and Luther is a thing that exist mostly because of the first Roblox event collab with Disney XD They made way back in 2010 lol.    Was kind of weird but cool nonethless cause they introduced skateboards. -Such lovely memories will always be in my heart...-
how dare you forget the godly show parker plays
Pair of Kings and randy 9th garaged ninja was my go to shows as a kid lol anyone else loved it xxx
mark i will break your knees for not liking zeke and luther
I swear, Disney XD had some of the best shows on a budget of $5
Pair kings is my favorite show
-Looks at the Thumbnail  Me: wtf do you mean I remember all of those
Forgotten dysney xd shows? More like who the fuck remembers dysney xd????
I loved Crash and Bernstein
I had fond memories watching Crash and Bernstein as a kid I'm glad someone else feels the same  way
I can't choose if I wish Mighty Med or Randy Cunningham had gotten another season. I loved both shows, but Mighty Med was left on a major cliffhanger and Randy Cunningham was fun with lots of potential to continue. I know Mighty Med has no chance, but I *so* hope RC9GN can be brought back as a Disney+ show
Crash is just Randy felt face before he became Australian
Pickle and Peanut was awesome
... We just going to ignore the fact that they used one of his sisters bras as a blindfold?
i loved pickle and peanut so much and still rewatch it, its so great i swear😭
Randy Cunningham 9th Grade Ninja is one of my favorite things. (It's set in Japanifornia lol) I love randy so much.
disney xd still exists where i am
You left out Tron: Uprising
I remember back in the day I refused to watch Pickle and Peanut based on how stupid I found the premise alone to be.
the accent change oml 😭 newry who
14:44 sneaky self promo lol
And yes, Skateboarding is a sport, and this is why the more athletic skaters often tend to beat the potheads at the X-Games. Lol
To be fair Mitchell musso was doing music on Hannah Montanah
You should do a part 2 with Aaron Stone, no one really talks about it, but it used to be one of my favorites. It was even my first ringtone haha
Man says Randh Cunningham is forgotten. MAN ITS STILL TALKED ABOUT
I didn't watch Disney XD but I have been enjoying Keyan Carlile's video essays on Lab Rats and Mighty Med unironically 😂
If I had a nickel for every time I saw someone on the internet make that goddamn Doofenshmirtz reference, I’d be a fucking billionaire
I remember when they first promoted xd before it came out I loved it as a kid kick and u had kid vs kat etc
Thank you for bringing up those shows and TV Channel.... I remember watching it alot  Did you plan to cover "the secret show" at some point
Pair of kings was peak
I used to love watching pair of kings back in the day, was really sad when they replaced Brady with the other guy. Totally ruined by the new guy, just didn't hit right :(
Can’t remember but never forgotten
Ya but they have beyblade so 10 out of 10 in my book
I always thought the XD stood for Xtra Disney
Umm, does one else here remember Slugterra? That show was incredible.
you should do a episode on Mr. Meaty
I loved pair of kings. But season 3 is where I stopped watching. Boz sucked as a character
Pair of kings was RAW
First time someone's actually mentioned the Crash and Bernstein I remember watching it's a lot of the kid good stuff in my opinion
Holy shit I completely forgot about crash and Bernstein
I can’t even lie I grew up watching Disney XD wayyy more than the regular Disney channel, I even remember when they came out with all those ass gaming shows 😂
I wanted to enjoy Disney XD (bc I was a sucker for anything Disney), but I really couldn’t get into it. I don’t think it was bc it might’ve been a “boys/teens program” bc I loved shows like ATLA, Danny Phantom, Teen Titans, etc. as a kid. The only show I managed to catch that was interesting me was Randy Cunningham, but then I forgot the shows name and could never watch it 😭  Side note/tangent: GOD, I hated shows like M.A.D or Uncle Grandpa. THEY WERE SO FREAKING UGLY AND ANNOYING and even tho I never saw or heard of Pickle and Peanut until now, it triggered that same sense of anger.
Disney XD used be one of them channel nobody watched blood lol. 💯 😂
NOOOOOO THAT SPONSER IS A SCAM!!! SCAM!!! LOOK INTO LSMARK YOUR SELLING YOUR FANS AND VIEWERS SCAMS!!!!
Ok, does anyone remember Aaron Stone? I think it aired around the time the channel launched. Can’t find much on it now. It was… something else.
So I actually used to like Pair of Kings because I was a dumb child once, but also my brother and I are mixed race, and whilst not twins (triplets w/e) he is black whilst I'm white due to having parents of either race  The show was hilariously plausible to us because of this in the choice of actors, but regardless I don't remember that much from the show and I did stop watching before the whole arrested actor debacle, so this was news to me  The main thing I remember was the love interest chick for the white brother who was just stereotypical hot smart cute girl who the protag pines for since the first meeting, and it's a "will they, won't they" for the entire show before they finally get together towards the end, or halfway through the series, break up and reconcile at the end  I distinctly remember starting to get really sick of this character archetype as she is in every fcking series, and they always try to overcompensate for her essentially being the hot girlfriend prize for the main character guy to finally win at the end of the show, by making her a "strong character" by being incredibly mature and intelligent, and essentially the only capable and responsible character around, whos only flaws are that shes kind of a bossy control freak   It was with her character I started to recognise this archetype that pops up constantly in these shows, and I began to find it so damn annoying.  The lanky, nerdy and immature audience self-insert of the main protag of a show that has comedy always has this crush. It's always the smart hot girl who is made flawlessly intelligent and mature and extremely skilled at things to prove shes actually a strong female character, and not just the trophy prize wish-fulfillment hottest girl in school gf  But she is. She always is. You know exactly what her character role is going to be, and what her arc will be and how their relationship will play out  She'll start off annoyed by the main characters goofiness and stupidness, and She'll have been an extremely talented and skilled prodigy who earned her place in whatever thing the main character suddenly forced his way into being at the top of due to his protagonist birthright and plot armour, and She'll resent him for it because he's so dumb, immature and unskilled and he didnt work for the position he got and doesn't deserve it. He will have a crush at first sight on her, and she will hate him intensely at first whenever his protagonist powers give him a one-up over her and he beats her at something she works super hard for and that makes her furious, especially if it's a public defeat where shes humiliated and storms off, then over time she sees his soft heart and the potential within him and starts to warm up, but he's still a manchild and that's all she sees him as until the end of the series and he finally reaches his protag potential   Her flaws are being bossy and a control freak who doesn't know how to let loose, and that's something he has to teach her to do and show her the fun side of life, but mostly she's just annoyed by his antics and would never imagine dating him  You can probably picture countless examples of this character and this dynamic as shes in both movies, games and TV shows
What about the show “I’m in the Band”? I loved that show!
I ironically like pickle and peanut as a guilty pleasure but I respect your opinion
These aren’t really forgotten since they were among main shows  on the channel.   This is like me calling the shows on Boomerang forgotten.   It’s just that they transformed the channel to reruns or series they think won’t draw, with occasional appearances of shows that originated there
Disney XD was such a TV show mortuary that there's enough for a sequel to this video, with shows like Boyster, Penn Zero, and that one incredibly low budget live action show about video games that aired like one episode every 4 months
Hey Mark, you forgot about Tron Uprising and Motor City, those shows are completely underrated gems!!
The only show I remember existing is pickle and peanut. Not anything about it. but just the fact it existed has been stuck in my head for years
I loved pickle and peanut ironically as a child, especially the intro
Crash and Bernstein looks like the white remake of My Cousin Skeeter
Established titles is a scam
I fucking loved Crash and Bernstein, it was so funny to little me
I love Randy Cuttingham so much
Amazing video of lost Disney channel/Disney XD shows LS mark,fantastic job. I watch half of those shows and some of them were ok watchable too. I did not know there was a ninja cartoon from Disney weird.
I unironically loved Pair of Kings and especially Crash Puppetman.
I remember Kickin’ It and Lab Rats fondly. I bet I’d dislike Kickin It on a rewatch but I actually did rewatch Lab Rats recently and still like it a fair bit.
Is weird because we had jimmy two shoes here on nickelodeon, idk it fit perfectly there
Fuck loved all these back in the day lol u shouldn’t done I’m in a band I totally forgot about it until u mentioned
you forgot about Aaron Stone
man i remember the crash and Bernstein puppet in roblox
I have this memory of randy cunningham where he like, goes through a mirror or something
Yes, we will require another one of these. We must expose the entirety of shows that lean on either end of extremes of total shit to masterpiece which was Disney XD. How else will the public know of such bangers as Motorcity while also riling in disgust over trash heaps such as Billy Dilly
Idk I thought XD shows went hard more than I saw on Disney Channel but also that could be my age      Edit (never mind ಥ_ಥ)
Might just be me but I loved all of these shows as a kid including crash and Bernstein mighty med and zeke and Luther XD ruled better than Disney at times And in my country gravity falls premiered on xd
i read the title and immediately thought of right now kapow. that show lives rent-free in my head and i have never seen anyone talk about it
Its good to know that Jimmy two shoes (a candian cartoon) actually had popularity in the states as it would run on mostly on Teletoon for us. Though I do remember seeing it on Disney XD when I was channel surfing one time. An amazingly funny show regardless.
I never forgot the cartoons from XD
I am HEARTBROKEN that you didn’t talk about Motorcity and it’s bullshit cancellation. That was an incredible show and it deserved so much better than what we got. If it ever got revived now, I’d be SO down to watch it.
Can’t have shit in Burbank
Bro I love the RC9GN theme….
I LOVED Randy Cunningham, only bc we share a last name that to me isnt exactly known, so it made me happy
Clearly, nothing will ever top the next-to-cinematic prowess that is Pickle and Peanut, with its complex understanding of the demented human psyche and its portrayal of the hardships that come with lower-class living. I will fall to my knees and cry out to the heavens when they create its deserved grand epic movie for Disney+
Bro I used to LOVE Crash and Bernstein. I need to rewatch it to see if it was as good as I remembered it 💀💀
"look what I found in your purse this morning" actually got me wtf
Honestly, I remember loving Crash and Bernstein solely because I had (have) a soft spot for puppets. Sometimes the intro pops into my head during random times of the day.
I thought the XD was suppose to be like emoji, cause at the time when it came out that's how kids typed.
I remember literally all of these. Fun trip
I loved kickin it. It feels like pre-cobra Kai. As in teenagers doing karate. Mighty meds jokes still hold up. And lab rats was great until a bit of a drop in quality in the fourth season. The sudden transition to a bionic island was strange too
i never had tv during this era but i remember most these shows from their sponsored roblox events
the crash and bernstein theme song lives rent free in my head
Very happy to see fellow Randy Cunningham fans in the comment section
I grew up and remember all of these shows, these arnt forgotten shows, especially crash and burnstine
I just recently saw a video from Valskibum about the sponsor https://youtu.be/R1odi73Yzz0
I may just be looking through rose tinted glasses but I'd probably still think Zeke and Luther is great because of my nostalgia for it. You have to admit that theme song and their handshake slaps though
Can u do a video about the three stooges 2012 movie?
Disney XD was after my time for the most part, but I did still watch Pair of Kings. I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, and consider it at the edge of 'Good' Disney sitcoms alongside early episodes of Jesse and Good Luck Charlie. Though, around the middle of Good Luck Charlie and after the first season of Pair of Kings is when I completely fell off watching TV and switched to Youtube and Netflix...... And pirating! :D
I loved Randy Cunningham as a kid I watched every episode that aired on TRTÉ
so, a lot of these ended up on Netflix. My sister and i were OBSSESSED with kickin it and pair of kings. I don't completely remember how i felt about boz, but i remember liking the other guy more. I also remember crash and berenstein but remember being scared of it.
Didn’t forgot rcngn
I had the exact same experience with Pair of Kings.  Love season 1 and 2 but refused to watched 3.  When it came out on Disney Plus a few years ago I finally checked it out, and, it was ok. It's not as good as season 2 and 1 and it's clear they panicked with Mitchells arrest, but it wasn't horrible.
4:20 someone please don't take this out of context.
21:07 I thought Mark was joking at first. And then I read the review.
Bro, when I was younger, Crash and Bernstein was my LIFE. I always loved watching it back when it was still on Netflix (Curse you, Disney+.).
I remember that I used to be obsessed with this channel when I was younger
I loved a majority of these shows C&B RC9GN Kerby Buckets and PoK… I miss the 2010s.
Oh god not another established titles sponsorship when are these creators going to stop shoving scams into our faces because they want more money
This is what I watched as a kid
Hope you can mention "I'm in the Band" sometime. I used to laugh out loud with that show but I was ashamed to admit it.
zeke and luther looks like british tv i cant explain it
Fantastic RLM moment at the 6:45 mark, Mark.
Lord Sonic Mark Rings like a bell.
I will say, I do not remember the show about a muppet on xanax
4:56 wait... Are those the kids who died in American Horror Story? Like the first episode of the first season. The two bratty boys who didn't listen to the girl who said they were gonna die in the murder house and like died in the murder house?
I can’t wait for Drake Bell’s rap album in a few years.
Wasn't there a show called Mr Young about a 13 year old as a teacher at a high school because he a genius? And there was this funny Asian janitor named "Dang"?
i liked pickle and peanut :(
To me randy Cunningham both rocks and is super cringe, the world building in my opinion is actually super cool and seeing some of the past ninjas and how they helped was sick but my god they just need to slow down a bit and the use of hip new slang like bruce and cheese just fuckin ew
I remember having a huge crush on bearns poetry sister
I need Crash and Bernstein on Hulu!
CRASH ABS BERSTEAN AND RANDY CUNNINGHAM MISS THEM SO MUCH
Did you make the kts wekrd that its happened twice joke again. 💫💫💫💫 hubba hubba daddy
Labrats was pretty much still airing a few years ago, i don't think it's forgotten, i remember watching that show on the normal Disney channel
Here on Latinoamerica it replaced Jetix, I think it was way more beloved over here since Jetix was on life support and only aired episodes of Pucca and the Fairly odd parents (they still aired it on DxD, but not as bad as Jetix, only episodes until season 5, everything else was only aired on Nickelodeon) everything that was new was a plus for us, even when DxD leased with like 4 originals, a bunch of re-runs and a ton of shovelware type shit
part 2 part 2 part 2 part 2
he didnt cover two more eggs,,,,,
I remember some of these shows. For better or worse
I never forgot these Disney shows.. great entertainment
I didn't watch that channel at all.
So nobody is going to talk about I'm in the band??? that show was awesome!!!
Kick buttowski…..enough said
I still remember having fond memories of Crash and Bernstein from way back then, so recently a few months ago, I rewatched it on Disney+ just to see how good it actually was.  Aside from some pretty good jokes and a unique concept, it was not exactly the best.  (Also, yikes, Established Titles got to you. I mean, they aren't the worst, but they are very much a scam if what people are saying is true.)
I remember a show called motor city I've been trying to find it for a bit and it only had one season on Disney xd the thing is it has the same animator as the band gorillaz
I will not stand for the Pickle and Peanut slander >:(
I remember I hated pickle and peanut and would always change the channel if it was on
labs rats and crash and bernstein were are w’s
I watched Disney XD a lot as a kid and oh my god Crash and Bernstein was one of my absolute favorites. Everything about it was so funny as a kid and I loved it.
I still love crash and Bernstein
2:30 hey, LS Mark... you doing okay, buddy? you're listening to an album called "Sweet Sticky Thing".... do we need to have another talk? is everything going okay at home? we care for you champ, never forget that
Where's Walk the Prank?
Lab rats was amazing
I’ve never forgotten crash and burnstiem
Imagine it being called Disney LMFAO
Fun fact the German voice of Kick Buttowski is the same voice actor as german Yami Yugi, which I find hilarious
Disney XD was dope..... At the time
Finally some acknowledgement of I'm In The Band, that show was my shizz when I w as 12. As such, I will forgive your desecration of the banger that is the Pair of Kings theme
I think you should do a video on the nickelodeon show the barbarian and the troll it's made with puppets either last year or early this year
i loved randy cunningham so much as a kid i probably watched that show all the way thru 2 times lol
Anyone remember the Disney XD atrocity that was Xiaolin Chronicles?
I actually didnt like how they changed the Pair of Kings series in season 3 either. You summed it up pretty well
xD
22:14 I discovered this show from an ad in a sports magazine where Crash was in the toilet.
I remember when Naruto shippuden used to air even have a couple mangas that say watch Naruto on Disney cod
One dude went to prison for multiple years the other paid a fine. I feel like these arn't really comparable.
i remember watching to watch crash and bernstein only because it was based in my state. after watching it though when i was 12 it was actually pretty cool for me as a kid. I like muppet stuff and creative media in general, so seeing that as a kid was awesome. I liked the show for many things, but one of them was that my mom or other family member would watch with me and enjoy it instead of crap talking my tastes in entertainment lol
The one and only pickle and peanut here
Ah, Lab Rats. The sub-par sitcom with Sci-fi elements and god awful people.
my character trait is being one of those people that's very vocal about woy being one of the greatest cartoons ever made
Randy Cunningham was knock off Jake Long
I honestly grew up more on Disney XD than I did Disney channel, I always remember loving the shows, especially Crash and Bernstein. The channel was really marketed as for cool 2000s boys more than it was for girls but it really had something for everyone.
Randy Cunningham was a dope show from what I remember, I was so surprised when I found out later the creator of Invader Zim did the show's designs. I thought that was neat.
This became THE channel. Disney XD didnt drop the ball on me like Nick and CN ended up doing. I loved just about all the shows aired... And if there was a rerun I didnt want to watch, nick, cn, or boomerang would come through for me.
Crash and Bernstein is a masterpiece if you have anything negative to say about it you are wrong you should be ashamed to have that opinion but its clear most people's limited intellect cant comprehend the sheer master craft that is this show and its comedy.
CRASH AND BERNSTIEN, MY CHILDHOOD. I LOVED THIS SHOW ALOT
okay, i can forgive the weird criticism of the pair of kings intro, but i can NOT forgive the SLANDER of the randy cunningham intro, that shit SLAPS
I hate to say it but I named my old pet hamster Crash after that stupid puppet
I love crash and Bernstein so much I named my roblox account zekebernstein lol
Shame on you for skipping kickin it
oh my fucking god, that's what the shows were called? pair of kings and zeke and luther? I remember watching them (esp pair of kings, a lot) but I never remembered the names. I thought it was just some fever dream I had as a kid but no, they were real
forgot to comment, just a single comment
How you not gon' talk about Kickin' It bruh Kickin' It was lit
Here's hoping next time you do a video like this PLEASE mention that Naruto Shippudan aired on Disney XD
What i think the XD stands for X-Dad D-Please -Come -Back
25:25 It’s not lost media if it was never meant to be shown to the public.
I watch Disney XD Watching kid vs catz,phineas and ferb,ultimate spiderman and Gravity falls To Bad Disney xd in My country Shut down and died You can watch the disney XD shows in disney + but it's not the same watching them on tv
*_"S"_* means speed so…     Lord Speed Mark!
10:43 hi it's me I was obsessed with this show in middle school 😬
Watch Kenan carlile's video if you want fun lab rats/mighty med. Videos
RC9GN is such a bangers it fells like miraculous ladybug but actually good, most of the characters have interesting personality especially the villans (macfist is hilarious)
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Great video mark. Btw it is very possible for two twins to look as different as the Pair of Twins brothers .There is actually a family who has that exact same setup. They are the durant-spooner family. They had to take DNA test all the time to prove their daughters were related.
Thing thing is almost all of these shows were og
Where is the name of that cartoon with that fucsia-haired kid with a robot who has an obsession with his crush? Does anyone remember it?
Bruh I forgot about mighty med
When it comes to Zeke and Luther and Pair of Kings, I always thought of it as a water down version of Smosh
Why does the guy that plays Randy have the same voice in every Roll I was watching DuckTales than the first sonic trailer came and it was the same voice
I mostly know Mitchell Musso as his role for Jeremy in Phineas and Ferb (and Milo Murphy's Law in that one episode that officially canonized Milo/Amanda)  A Phineas and Ferb actor getting arrested sounds WAY MORE interesting than a Pair of Kings actor getting arrested, IMO
Excuse me, but isn't 3:47 the German brand of Zeke AND Luther Zeke UND Luther?
Lord Ship Mark
Aye don't disrespect Zeke and luther
Brady being replaced straight up ruined the "Lady of the cave" plotpoint, where her cave paintings always come true.  She predicted that Brady and Boomer were going to save the island, and they just act like it never happened.
Lmfaoooo the Kai cenat clip
I actually liked crash and Bernstein
LS JUST UNLOCKED SOME CHILDHOOD BLOCK OF CRASH AND BERNSTIEN I F'ING LOVED THAT SHOW
calling the pair of kings intro terrible is the worst take of the video
Omg i remember pair of kings!! I loved that show when i was 7! I completely forgot abt it, childhood memories are coming back
I remember trying to find crash and Bernstein for 2 years, because I saw it on Netflix like 6 years ago and they took it off
I thought Disney XD was for 12 year olds that skateboard 💀
The crazy thing about Randy Cunningham is the star-studded voice cast. So many big names
Good video, I used to watch crash and burnstein with my son and he loved it.
Them using a Gamecube controller means there WAS a Gamer on set, Super Smash Bros Melee is nothing to sneeze at
My sibling and I both loved Pair of Kings as a kid! I remember being confused and disappointed when they wrote out Brady though and didn’t watch much further after that
Man I remember that I switched to watching disney xd when pokemon went over there and then stopped watching tv after I realized that sun and moon were boring as hell
Randy Cunningham was a potentially awesome show and a part of my childhood   It’s sad that they couldn’t make third season and if you’ve watched the finale, you’ll know what I means
Kirby Buckets, Gamers Guide to Pretty Much Everything, the two animated Avengers shows, The animated Hulk show, the two animated Spider-Man shows, the animated Guardians of the Galaxy show, Penn Zero, 7D, Wonder Over Yander, Star vs the Forces of Evil, and the Tron show. (The shows people actually forgot about)
I remember watching Randy Cunningham  Forgot how much I enjoyed it, but it had funny things like that one where his identity almost gets revealed (not giving spoilers because I think it would be more funny that way)
WE NEED COMMANDO CRASH NOW
Lab rats was a good show but cringe
As a pair of kings fan I hated the change, the dynamic never felt the same
holy shit i was not expecting Crash and Bernstein to be so fucking insane in how you covered it here, i want to see at least one episode now
I unironically have always loved Crash and Bernstein. There’s always been something about it’s humor that sticks with me all these years later. And I’m so glad someone else has finally acknowledged it’s greatness.
When I saw the triplet reveal in pair of kings as a kid unironically I thought I was experiencing peak tv show and that no piece of fiction will ever surpass this sublime plot twist
Randy Cunningham is awesome!Thanks for putting him here
i rewatch crash and Bernstein every year. genuinely love that show so much
BRO ME AND MY BROTHER USED TO MAKE FUN OF CRASH AND BERNSTEIN FOR YEARS
I actually loved pickle and peanut.
God I loved XD as a kid! Gravity falls, lab rats, crash and bernstien, mighty med, star vs, wander over yander, and phineas and ferb. Now that I think of it, I had lots of fond memories regardless of how it aged. Oh lord pickle and peanut was a abomination! Even weird 9 year old me was horrified and I barely had established taste back then
These shows are unironically my favorites when i was 7
"Forgotten Disney XD Show" Proceeds to list my entire childhood. All of these have a special place in my heart.
I hate you
Crash and Bernstein was popular in my school. Many kids watched and even had one kid who resembled the Bernstein guy. People would tell him, “where was crash” or would say stuff crash would say
8:20 this dude is a serious wigger
my brother fucking loves pickle and peanut and i have no idea why he's liked it ever since he first saw it on disney xd he's 11 now but jesus kid why this show
Crash and Bern my favorite...! In fact I named my first Minecraft name after Wyatt
I remember most of these shows   Loved crash and Bern as a kid
I will not have Pair of Kings theme song slander
It’s crazy all the shows in the thumbnail are shows id always watch and talk about with my friends
Not forgotten, most of you weren't even born yet. This video is just for views because you are too lazy to get a job
BREAKING NEWS: Lord (s) Mark does a Ghandi until Commando Crash Pilot is found
One of my favorites was mech x4 was a great show about a kid who had the power to control technology and his two friends and brother would control a giant robot and fight monsters send by their moms evil boyfriend
You forgot Motorcity
A lot of people don’t talk about penn zero part time hero and I believe that’s one of Disney xd’s best and underrated cartoons
24:11 You can definitely tell he hasn’t watched Death Battle in ages.
What do you think about Wonder Over Yonder Mark?
The only show I remember absolutely no one talking about on Disney XD was some show called Kirby Buckets
Crash and Bernstein is fuckin amazing, and a creative idea, better than Teen Titans Go at least
My favorite Disney XD story is when they decided they wanted in on that “Annie-May” thing the kids were getting into and decided to put Naruto Shippuden onto their programming block, only to realize too late that it was a lot more violent then they wanted which caused them to run a censored version until they could sell the broadcast rights to Adult Swim and Toonami.
Did you know they are going to try to continue Randy Cunningham 9th grade ninja?
You just stink of "I'm gay please don't use trigger words"
I wonder what dark secrets the guy that made Pickle & Peanut knows so he can blackmail Disney to give them shows.
Thank you for reminding me how awesome Crash & Bernstein is
Jimmy two shoes sounds like a rip off of jimmy two two anyone else remember that show
Dos aynywon remember conterfiet cat
Crash and Bernstein has a parody made by Madtv where Crash was replaced by Rainbow Dash
Bro no disrespect but the Pair of Kings theme song SLAPPED and you should take that back
L S MARK s d p a l  s a h s h
I remember watching all of these shows you talked about and enjoying most (Pickle and Peanut I watched for the randomness). Polaris: Player Select (the YouTube snippets one) was one I heavily enjoyed (I never heard of any of the YouTubers that was on there before watching it, then I started watching Jacksepticeye not-long after as a result. Another one I enjoyed was Parker Plays and the Pranksgiving annual episodes (always released around Thanksgiving, but they stopped making it at some point). Crash and Beirstein was won that I was surprised I liked after watching the first episode when it first aired.  13:01, I felt similar but still watched it out of curiosity what will happen. The main episode I remember was the one where the band Black Eyed Pees (not sure how to spell the band’s name) was mentioned. Never heard of them before then, but I liked a song of theirs after (Tonight’s gonna be a good night).
Bro I fucking loved Crash and Bernstein as a kid, that show was so rad to 9 y/o me. Hopefully I'm not the only one who feels that way.
2 more eggs
Non of these were forgotten… they were my freaking childhood lol
14:45 why does that clip seem familiar?
Randy cunningham was my most favorite cartoon and it still is one of my go to shows....... sadly we never got season 3 😔
XD stands for Xuck a Deeznutz
Dayumn my nigga Luther was from da East side 😂🤪🔥 🔫 💨💨
Established Titles is a scam!! Don't waste your money like I did.
Anyone else remember the Nerdcorp shows like MaxSteel and Slugterra
I. Remember. ALL OF THEM.
I’d love to see you cover all the others shows mentioned at the end including the ones you didn’t think were worth talking about. This video was great!  It’s nice looking back on these shows regardless of whether I enjoyed them. It feels weird that I missed most of them Disney stuff like the Jake Paul show yet saw all of these.
YO I'MA LET YOU FINISH BUT, DING DONG, YO IT'S CRASH AT THE DOOR, DON'T WAIT FOR YOU TO OPEN, KICK IT DOWN, HARDCORE, IM PURPLE WITH A TOOD, WHERE YA MOM HIDE THE FOOD, IN THE FRIDGE, I'MA EAT IT THEN WE TEAR IT UP DOOOOD, NO MAKE UP, FEELINGS, TEA PARTIES OR DOLLS, NOW IT'S NINJAS, FOOTBALL, AND FACE SLAMS, GOOD CALL, CRASH AND BERNSTEIN, CRASH AND BERNSTEIN, CRASH AND BERNSTEIN, WHAT HE SAID, CRASH AND BERNSTEIN, CRASH AND BERNSTEIN, CRASH BERNSTEIN WHAT HE SAID, IT'S WAR AGAINST AWESOME AND AWESOME GOTTA SWORD, ILL BE GROWNED FOREVER, THATS WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR, CRASH AND BERNSTEIN, CRASH AND BERNSTEIN, CRASH AND BERN- I SAID STEIN, WHAT HE SAID  HEHEHE
i honestly really liked the ending, actually caught me a bit off guard, and that final area was so cool
There are probably tons of people who waited a year since the pilot and I myself waited eight months🎉 This is much appreciated.
Crash and Bernstein used to be my shit for some perplexing reason
Sir I am Indian how to make this cartoon animation in mobile please help me
I forgot pickle and peanut excited and I regret remembering it
I remember them fondly but pickle and peanut I didn't like that show
As someone with ADHD, I actually really like Pickle and Peanut. The absolute chaotic nature of the show, coupled with the fact that there’s no real breaks in said chaos, gives me something I can focus on without being super distracted.
I haven't forgotten. My hatred still runs deep.
Randy Cunningham 9th Grade Ninja's intro animation is some of the best animation I have seen from its time
Thank you 'Lord Sussy Mark'
U should talk about wander over yonder
Zeke and Luther was supreme over anything at all
I like Randy Cunningham, and also Ben Schwartz is Randy's Voice actor
make a video watching all of regular show pls‼️‼️🙏🏽
Mark is tone deaf confirmed. Man really said Pair of Kings and RC9GN's theme songs suck...bro idc what u say, that shiz slaps.
Commander Peepers is my spirit animal.
Him switching between American and Irish accents made me laugh throughout half of the video🐱
Disney XD always will hold a place in my heart with weird cartoons. Crash and Bernstein, counterfeit cat, billy dilly’s super duper subterranean summer, I loved them all
I'm actually pretty shocked that you never mentioned the 7D, I don't hear anyone talk about that one. Although it might not really count considering it was on Disney Channel for a while if I remember correctly. If you ever come back to something like this video it would be cool to see you review it. Used to love it as a kid but I have no idea if it holds up.
The commercial theme of “Crash and Burn. STEIN!” Has been stuck in my brain for YEARS.
Pickle and Peanut is similar to Nickelodeon show Breadwinners
Kickin It deserved some time
Forgot Aron stone
THANK YOU I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE NAME OF CRASH AND BERNESTEIN FOR 5 YEARS. there was this scene of the puppet going "I haven't even tackled by bucket list. Blue bucket, green bucket, red bucket"
I don't think it's SUPER weird that two people who film shows in or around Burbank got arrested in Burbank. It would've been weird if they'd both gotten arrested in Kenosha.
You should have mentioned another show called Motorcity, it was made by Titmouse and was canceled after only one season but it’s incredibly underrated imo
Where’s Aaron Stone?
Established Titles is a Scam....
I completely forgot that Crash and Berstein ever existed!! Me and my brother used to record every episode over the week and then sit and watch them one after another. Most of the time it was reruns, we didn't care, we just worshipped Crash.
I find it incredibly funny that McFist just looks like The Scotsman from Samurai Jack AND they're voiced by the same guy. There's no way that was an accident.
You talked about the "toe in a faucet" gag being old, but the "two characters who look nothing alike thinking they're identical twins" was a running gag in one of the Muppet movies - Kermit and Fozzie were supposedly identical twins.
We need Kick back 💯 and to finally get together with Kendra 💯
14:45 that cartoon looks familiar,anyone know the name of it?
I pushed "play" and "REMEMBER" flashed on the screen, the screen turned white, and no audio played and nothing else happened. It was weirdly creepy.
You gotta do a second vid on this, such a nostalgia trip
Crash and Bernstein was the shit and you can’t tell me otherwise
*Lord Jordan*
I remember when Bernstein killed his father by repeatedly bashing a hammer to the back of his head.
I loved all of these shows as a kid, the epicness and radness really stuck to me as a young influential child
As a kid, I would watch almost anything that was on TV. And as my parents had an awful tv packet that for some strage reason only included Disney XD and Nickelodeon as cartoon channels, I spent a lot of time with Disney XD. And I remember liking most of their stuff. But I vividly hated Pickle and Peanut, after watching first episode. I hated it, and after it premiered, of course, DXD schedule was full of its episodes for long time.
It’s crazy how from 2000-2009 had some of the best kids media but then 2010 came around and it was all down hill
I remember when Disney XD started showing Naruto and Pokémon. I was used to Pokémon being a Cartoon Network thing, and Naruto was more young adult oriented, so this came as a surprise to me.
I can honestly see Crash and Uncle Grandpa having a competition. Like tricks with their own severed heads, ways to smash through a wall, having swords.
I know you need the money but...this company has no actual offices, the land won't actually be registered as belonging to you in the UK by their own admission, and the person who is the official in charge of recognising who holds the title of Laird, the Lord Lyon King of Arms of the Lyon Court at Edinburgh, has stated these titles are meaningless.
17:11 I'm sorry...DICK DOWN?!
Man I missed it
Hold on Mighty Med and Lab Rats fucking merged into the one show?  WHY DID I NEVER SEE ANYTHING ABOUT IT?!
Kick Buttowski is the greatest Disney XD show
The XD Shutdowns themselves are a pretty fascinating entity. You can actually find most of them on YouTube as most of those dead channels weren’t pulled until only 2-3 years ago and there’s enough footage of them to make SEVERAL HOUR COMPILATIONS. Most of the time it’s spent on showing the preceding ads but it does show a lot about each country’s approach in running their version of XD and/or they handled the closing… if they actually even bother indicating one as what makes these compilations kinda haunting to watch is seeing the vast majority of them just unceremoniously pull the plug in the middle of a show or ad. Japan has been the only one so far to actually give a proper sendoff (as others at best just dished out a bumper ambiguously implying their demise,) and Pickle and Peanut was apparently very popular over there as it was featured pretty prominently in their closing tribute (which was hosted by the bumper narrator himself and even had the Japanese VA for Dr Doofenshmirtz pop in.) There’s also footage of a more generalised Disney-owned Japanese channel closing of DLife where there is this extensive closing credits scene where they list EVERYTHING THEY AIRED in the 8 years it was on broadcast, it’s pretty glorious.
I loooove kick butowski still
Make a vid on oney
Man Gaming Show in my Parents' Garage was GOAT
The X of Disney XD is from an old cartoon channel Disney bought called Jetix
I remember how I used to watch Crash and Bernstein whenever I was bored
The sponsorship didn't age well 💀
The sponsor was fake
I'm in the band was goated.  I don't remember the irl drama tho, maybe I missed it lmao.
I used to watch Pickle and Peanut and made a Roblox game about it, please execute me.
Crash and Bern  STEIN Crash and Bern STEIN CRash and Bern STEIN WHAT HE SAID CRASH AND BERN STEIN crash and Bern I SAID STEIN
Nice video! I remember watching all of these shows back in the day and lovin' em !! ...except for Crash & Bernstein and Pickle & Peanut. I was waiting for you to talk about some truly forgotten shows like Aaron Stone but it was a nice trip down memory lane. Good one!
Damn, so many memories from childhood, both the good ones like randy cunningam, crash or lab rats, and bad like pickle and peanut
I grew up with this shit
I love the part where Crash says, it's crashin time, and crashed all over those guys. Crash and Bernstein is truly one of the shows of all time.
Kick Buttowski was my go to show
Personally, I was obsessed with Disney XD, Nicktoons, and other such "edgier" branded tv networks growing up. It was either because I craved as much action based simulation as possible because of my crippling ADHD or because it was a subconscious way for me to project my trans man fantasies onto the characters on screen. My favorite shows were Kick Buttowski, Randy Cunningham 9th Grade Ninja, Lab Rats, Ying Yang Yo, American Dragon: Jake Long, Fish Hooks, and Slugterra. I could include a ton more but a lot of the cartoons that I adored would often play catch by constantly shifting airing them between Disney XD and Disney Channel (Gives loving headpats to Star Vs The Forces Of Evil and Gravity Falls)  Also also, Pickle And Peanut came out around the time I started no longer being interested in watching TV and instead preferring to be on the computer, and that fucking show feels like it was the final nail in the coffin for my interest in the channel. It just. Around that fucking show so many shitty things came out around it. And it made me feel bad because I recognized the art style from Fish Hooks which made me assume it was made by the same people, and while I fucking adored Fish Hooks I just simply could not go into Pickle And Peanut despite it. Nicktoons also started coming out with pretty icky shows around that same year too, looking at Sanjay And Craig for example. I was a kid that was simply not picky, and I enjoyed whatever gave me that sweet sweet dopamine. So when that dopamine stopped and was replaced with fart jokes? That got me to step right back out lmao
The sponsorship is a scam lmfao
Randy Cunningham was my favourite show as a kid but I swear it was never on
I forgot about Crash and Bernstein lol. I actually enjoyed the show when I was younger.
The funny bit is in the past year I was introduced to RC9GN, didn’t mind it was alright and good but the person who showed me this loved the character Julian who is a character that’s great…Howard’s still a jerk
Lab rats was my entire childhood how dare you not review every pixel of that show.  Unsubscribe
I literally only watched Disney XD for Phineas and Ferb because it was on Disney XD more than on Disney Channel
I was not expecting Mark to like Randy Cunningham, but it was a genuinely weird surprise... (I'm only saying this because I liked lol)           Crash vs. Uncle Grandpa is the battle to battle all battles...     Edit: Okay, scrolling through the comments, I WAS NOT EXPECTING SO MANY PEOPLE TO LIKE RC9GN, WHAT THE HECKING HECK!? I was under the impression that I was the only person who liked it, or even knew it existed, but, no, I guess not...
I am in the Band was another classic that was on Disney XD
Established Titles is a scam
I enjoyed these past shows
They did Randy Cunningham DIRTY 😞
On the next one you should do Kirby Buckets
Crash was freakin physcotic and it was great
Dude can please not cuss and love sonic too and Randy cunning ham was actually not that bad
14:46 art style of the show is good
Crash and burnstian was my favourite one in the roster
Crash and Bernstein is honestly my favorite Disney sitcom. Sure it's chaotic and dumb, but I really enjoy the creative antics that Crash gets into. They took full advantage of the creativity of having a muppet-like character in the setting of a family sitcom. It's just unironically entertaining.
For me, I would compare Pickle and Peanut to Adult Swim's Smiling Friends This show is almost exactly what Pickle and Peanut wishes it could've been Only difference is Smiling Friends earns its nonsense because it's very funny while Pickle and Peanut is just randomness for the sake of randomness
0:00 Mark is like making a beat over here.
no man. randy cunningham was so good.
I think it's unfortunate that Mitchel Musso is better known for his role in Hannah Montana than Phineas and Ferb, a show that's actually good. But then again Jeremy is a pretty unmemorable character, so I'm not exactly surprised either.
seeing crash and bernstein mentioned dug up an unholy amount of childhood memories. thank you for forcing me to remember Puppet Man
I loved pair of kings as a kid and was extremely dissapointed when they replaced the character for another with thr triplet reveal even as a 10 year old i recognized the the plot as just a way to introduce a character to replace him. Also my younger brother was a big crash and bern fan and at first i hated it but as i kept watching i actually enjoyed it.
10:51 I wouldn't say I was a hard-core pair of kings fan, but I was definitely hyped when ads for lore heavy episodes played and always tuned in to them.
Anybody remember right now kapow ? It was like a skit show that was animated
I always thought it was xtreme disney
The fact that Adam Hix was in BOTH of those shows connected LMFAO
Rest in peace Thurston Waffles 😭
I remember loving Crash and Bernstein as a kid and thinking the theme was awesome. It's simply an escapist fantasy that just jelled with me. It's cringey looking back but I don't regret watching it.
The third season of pair of kings was terrible
Man crash and Bernstein was sooo fire 🔥
I used to love the DisneyXD channel as a kid, I remember all the amazing shows, I have been searching for THAT puppet show for years ngl lol
I need the episode with the “look what I found in your purse this morning”
I mean hey, Bernstein's actor went on to play a young Wilson Fisk on Netflix's Daredevil, and that's how I even recognized him from Crash and Bernstein. I don't know what else he's been in since but hey he made an appearance in an amazing show as Daredevil so that's something
I was always a CN kid and always said “Disney XD is where Disney puts the shoes that don’t suck” because I hated live action when I was younger
Xd was 🐐
I still watch crash and Bernstein
Something that shocked me is that Mitchel Musso actually returned to Disney a few years ago in Phineas and Ferb Candace against the universe
Disney should have never killed Jetix for Disney XD. Jetix was perfect!
Nice Tekken 3 character select screen music
As a Nintendo nerd, it could possible be that they were playing a Wii which did support Gamecube Controllers. So if I had to guess, they were playing either Melee or Brawl
I used to be terrified of Pickle and Peanut as a kid for some reason
I remember Disney kept pushing the hell outta this show (gimmicks and all) in the led up to its premiere and during its first season. I assume they felt this was their next big hit. And yet it only ran for two seasons and was quietly put aside... Also fun fact - Tim Lagasse also played Oobi, so Oobi's basically Crash naked.
Crash and Bern  I SAID STEIN
I wish I could forget Pickle and Peanut. Everything else was good or decent.  Except Randy Cunningham. That was fantastic.
Man, crash and Bernstein was my childhood show growing up
Idk how I should feel being most familiar with these shows over any others.
I remember when there was this big surprise and secret about Crash getting a new nose and people going to websites to see what it would be, only for it to be used I like one episode
the arrested arrows got me
You know what mark…SCREW YOU! I’m done! Im done! You think you can hate on Zeke and Luther?! You Sped Sonic fan! I unsubscribed and I reported all your videos! You lost your number one fan! You’re a generic hater! You feed off of mediocrity!
Does anyone remember the seven dwarves show that used to air on Disney XD?
You forgot all about Tron uprising, the best and most forgotten of the Disney XD shows
Kicking it is a banger
Pair of kings and crash and Berenstain were my favorite part of Disney xd and the others I vaguely remember and it's crazy looking back now (and I was a pair of kings fan that got excited at the story) The change sucked but not knowing why I just went with it and liked the show less
I hope someone is able to find that Crash and Bernstein pilot. I loved that show as a kid, and it would cool to see it.
Jeez I remember Crash and Bernstein but in a Spanish dub since I was in my grandmother's house in Peru at that time. I accidently discovered Disney XD and that show was playing and already at the first few seconds I was laughing my head off. Never watched it since but it is too memorable to forget.
When I was younger I used to watch pickle and peanut all the time despite being somewhat disgusted by it, I’m not sure if I actually liked it or I just watched it because it was on
Maybe look into ''Atomic puppet'' it was an animated disney show from 2016. Have been really intetrested in it for like a month now and noone talks about it I have noidea why it did so badly its so good
Fun fact - William Brent (the actor who played Chase) also got a DUI arrest during production of "Lab Rats", yet he didn't get fired.  He prolly looked at Mitchel and was like: "Damn, that coulda been me."
Thoughts on the shows you mentioned:  1) I've seen some early episodes of Zeke and Luther as a kid, but I've completely forgotten about that show until you mentioned it. I had no idea it's budget was shit and that Adam got arrested in 2018. 2) I've never seen an episode of pair of kings as a kid, but it looks pretty good. I should go check it out. 3) I've only seen one episode of randy Cunningham and to be honest, it wasn't very interesting to me, but Its cool that ben Schwartz was in it and i didn't know it. 4) Fish Hooks was way better than pickle and peanut (they're made by the same creator, btw) 5) HOW DID I LIKE CRASH AND BERNSTEIN AS A KID???!!!
Even though I've never seen "Zeke and Luther", here's an interesting thing.  The Show MAD, on Cartoon Network (Can's family-friendly version of Robot Chicken), had a parody called "Zeke and Luthor" (or Zeke and Lex Luthor) where one of the characters is replaced by Lex Luthor to compete in a skateboard competition.  I think one of their competitors was Superman.
me and my cat liked this video
Fairly new to your channel...congrats on getting on trending!
Me and my buddy watched pickle and peanut while we were playing rainbow six siege ranked, and uh we came to the honest conclusion that pickle and peanut is from the chaotic visions of methed up Nazis.
Tim Lagasse is also known for playing the title character of Oobi. That's definitely a huge 180 from Crash And Bernstein.
is no-one going to menchin how the two kings cousin is Ryan Ochoa aka chuck Spencers arch enemy.
I watched all of these shows mainly because I was in love with most of the characters but the quality was amazing to me and was the perfect adjacent to Disney Channel for me at the time. My favorite show of all time on Disney XD and Disney respectively is lab rats and I just love it so much (hate elite force but I watched it because Chase was in it) but I REFUSED to watch pickle and peanut and I used to have a ban against wander over yonder if it even had a commercial turn on I would mute or turn off the TV lmao i was so against it. I remember being the biggest fucking SIMP for Randy Cunningham. I watched a bit of kick Buttowski but I missed most of the episodes so I never really got too into it but wasn’t against it. I loved crash and Bernstein and even got my sisters to watch which was big because they were mainly Disney Channel stans. Zeke and Luther (I still know nothing about skateboarding but I was so into them riding across town), Pair of kings (I was pissed when Brady got replaced and I was so scared when I thought that fish was gonna come to life) were like top-tier with kicking it for me and lab rats already mentioned and yes again it was because I was in love with Billy Unger (now goes by William Brent), Leo Howard, Hutch Dano, Mitchel Musso, and Adam hicks. It does make me sad to see where Disney XD is out today considering I remember loving making the jump with the lab rats duel premier on Disney + Disney XD (they said sexy in the pilot & little catholic me at the time felt like a baddie for watching, so much so that i watched both premieres just to see it again) but I will say I’m glad I was able to enjoy its prime and keep up on the shows at the time!
the criminal conicidences are really weird
Wonder over yander and phineas and pherb are the goats 🐐
I never watched pickle and peanut but knew of it's existence, but i did watch pair of kings and crash and berenstein Shiiit bro i forgot kickin it existed, i used to watch that shit too
Bro I was so obsessed with pair of kings 💀
This is probably just nostalgia talking, but I would like for you to look into Kickin’ It, I remember there were some actual arcs that characters go through and it actually has a story, at least at some point. If not make a video about it, at least look into it.
I’ll get Blameitonjorge to talk about Commando Crash an it’ll probably be found in like 3 days
WAIT WHY WAS THERE NO MENTION OF MIGHTY MED I L O V E D THAT SHOW
Pair of kings and Zeke and Luther at least twice a week. Crash and Bernstein too but less pleasant thoughts lol
we don't talk about Crash and Bernstein
my dad and i love pickle and penut
I remember Disney XD For just having better shows then Disney Channel, mostly in terms of animation. Sometimes we had anime just appear on there, like Digimon. Gravity Falls made its home there more so then on Disney Channel, so that was one good reason to put more focus on XD... And I guess I watched Pair of Kings too! Just a little.  I really do think XD was better then Disney Channel though.
10:43 I feel called out
i’m 98% sure my sister and i were obsessed w crash and bernstein when we were little. you’ve dug up some memories
At 2:30 that is LITERALLY MY FEED i was scared for a second what the hell
randy cunningham is one of the shows of my childhood, no doubt but lookng back, i most definetly had a bias towards ninjas when i was younger lmao
Rip Jetix before it turned into Disney XD.
Fun fact:    Half these forgotten shows are on Disney+
Theres been a resurgence for Kick Buttowski??
Does anyone here remember Two More Eggs?
Tron uprising deserves to be on this list, so forgotten you even forgot about it
pickle and peanut is good if you like crazy nonsense
I loveeeddddd pair of kings 🥲  Hateeeddddd the change from Brady to the strawberry blonde   Is it bad that I’ve watched all of these🥲
TRON: Uprising was the A1, & geometrical show on Disney XD+Disney Channel it would be dope if had like 3 or 4 seasons.
Hi yes I was one of the die hard pair of kings👑👑
I'm loving the tekken music my man
Hey mark, you should watch all of regular show and review it
My cousin actually was friends with Adam hicks the co star of Zeke and Luther. They went to the same church growing up but then he became a big star and moved to hollywood or something
If you want to do a second video talk about Kirby buckets and I’m in the band
Oh man, I'm so glad more people are talking about rc9gn. It's hella cringe at times but genuinely has a decent serialized story, and super cool animation. And probably started Ben Schwartz voicing like, the exact same character every time, tbh. (Randy, Leo, Dewey, Sonic.)  But yeah, the intro and all the fake slang are still really bad, and I'm glad someone else noticed the weird mock-seinfeld Ben does.  (+Props to queenofgravyfries for reintroducing basically all of cartoon youtube to rc9gn.)
Disney XD is just Disney for The Boys™
R.I.P Thurston. He's going on walks in the stars now. 😔
I actually grew up with Randy Cunningham. It may be forgotten by some, but for me, I loved this show. Even them using the words  "Bruise," "Juice," and whatever else did not bother me at all
rip Motorcity being mentioned in the video  Also Disney XD Jetix on top of Toon Disney so mega unbased
If you are considering the next look around, try Mech-X4 and see how you like it
2:41  ATTENTION: I have just received news from Vaskalibum (yes I know I misspelled it) that “Established Titles” is likely a scam. Please do not purchase anything from the company. Your money will thank you.
Pair Of Kings was not forgotten & I'll admit all of these are expect the 1st ( Born in 06 ) Never Seen that One That one can Be basically Never have been made
xd
Disney ROFL
I absolutely loved Randy Cunningham as a kid, and I'm really sad to see it won't be revived at all.
Kanye reference in the Crash Bernstein intro
Crash is the definition of a giga chad
There was also I'm In The Band that no one remembers apparently.
5:21 I'm pretty sure that's just Disney+. they have a bad habit of listing the episodes for most of the disney XD shows out of order.
When I saw the name "Zeke and Luther" in this video I had no idea what the show was. Then I saw the actors for the show and it opened up a ton of nostalgia for me. Still don't remember the show but I do remember seeing their faces all the time.
Does anyone remember parker plays?
10:33 😭tf
remember slugterra?
Disney XD was (and sometimes still is) my go to “background noise” channel. It mainly showed the animated Disney shows so it was at least ok content mainly and anything else usuialy wasnt bad enough to get me to change the channel, just kinda mid. Yeah theres a lot of strange shows on this channel. I still  remember the switchover from Toon Disney to Disney XD. I was at my grandmas house when it happened. Also ima be real with you i think that the Lab Rats show was almost good if they put more focus on the plot and got rid of (or at least played down) the “comedy”.
Old Disney XD is childhood but now it doesnt have a lot of shows anymore
I will always remember pickle and peanut
no aaron stone :(
👍👍👍
I remember watching Pair of Kings at my grandparents’ when there was an earthquake, and nobody even remotely felt it.  [edit] also, I guess Mark gets a seat in the House of Lords now, exactly what he’ll do with this power remains to be seen
guys established titles is a scam dont do it
Kick’in it slaps!
I remember loving both RC9GN and Crash and Bernstein, both were great for my 12 year old brain
“Look what I found in the shower this morning…”  “Whatever, look what I found in your purse this morning.”   An absolute menace
There was a really, REALLY obscure show that aired on DXD about some kids going to a summer camp but the counselors were monsters. It was a sitcom and all I remember is the main character’s name was McGee
20:42 bro what
i generally forgot how good Crash is. _honestly he's SML Jeffy puppet done in a tasteful manner..._ Why do i have strange desire to see you do a review on the Disney Channel cartoons that have been forgotten...
Ninjago.
I remember every single one of the XD shows
Here in portugal we never had disneu xd lol all went to normal disney
Dawg Lab Rats is my childhood and I sometimes binge it and I want more, I also watched quite a bit of Crash and Bernstein but that was later when I older
Crash and Bernstein was one of the only shows I liked on Disney XD as a kid. Probably because the concept itself kinda vibed with me because I also grew up with only 3 sisters.
I love Marvel's Spider-Man.
Anyone else remember that one short series called Two More Eggs? Also I absolutely loved Crash and Bernstein lmfao
One show I wish you covered was motorcity a amazing show that deserved better
I never got that the XD was supposed to be the emoticon. I'm not a smart person.
I literally loved Crash and Bernstein when I was little. My mom found it so obnoxious she would leave the room and complain when I watched it. It makes me so sad that a lot of people today call this show bad. It's INSANE and that's why it's SO FUNNY.
I hope one day Mark makes a Wander Over Yonder video
pickle and peanut  WAS PEAK!!!
I feel like absolutely nobody remembers the Disney XD show: Dude That's My Ghost does anyone remember???
I was definitely not the target audience, but I legitimately enjoyed Walk the Prank and Kick Buttowski ^^
Didn't DisneyXD pay a bunch of youtuber to air their youtube videos
I always thought Disney XD, was a mixture of the old Jetix and Disney. You know, jetiXDisney? And another Disney cause they have to have top billing.
Adam hicks new songs are soooo fire
Crash and Bernstein is one of my favorite shows ever, and I’m glad you agree🫵😀👍🏽
great video
I completely forgot about Pair of Kings. Not sure why though because season 1 was pretty solid
Yeah I remember Crash and Bernstein and Wander Over Yonder!
I haven’t watched the video. But I hope you talk about the most forgotten and one of my favorite disneyXD shows. (I’ll be back)  Ok so you didn’t talk about Pen Zero Part Time Hero. But RC9GN was so cool As a kid 😂
Disney XD has a special place in my heart. It brought me nostalgia to the peak of my life. When the channel first aired in my country, I was done with high school and entered college. College was a lifechanging experience to my life.
The way they just put YouTube videos with shitty boomer editing on their channel is so stupid, pandering, bottom of the barrel shit I didn't even think the creators knew about it
Not the established titles scam
watching this reminded me of one show i completely forgot about that was on xd: penn zero: part time hero
I loved Zeke and Luther, Pair of Kings, and Crash and Bernstein when I was a kid lol
Isn't Jimmy Two-Shoes a canadian cartoon too?
The fact he didn’t talk about the masterpiece of a show that is Two More Eggs it leads me to believe that I’m the only one who remembers it
Not me immediately clicking onto the video once I see pickle and peanut.
Disney XD was something I use to watch as a kid. But I do remember at least some of these shows actually. I am not surprised about how the program is going down hill
Sorry to do this but tiny correction: It's Sykes, not Skyes. The UK comedy starring Eric Sykes. Specifically it was called Sykes And... A Bath.
Idk about that sponsor, I've heard that it's  a scam, not entirely sure if it's TRUE, but it's worth looking into
Remember jetix the better version of Disney XD
I remember liking some of these as a kid
Slugterra isn't talked about enough for how forgotten and great it was, also Penn zero
This Holiday season Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas (1999) on Disney XD
as a kid who was a hardcore pair of kings stan i remember being so bitter about the change because saying brady wasn’t meant to be a king retconned whatever lore they set up in the first two seasons. some other people have said it too, but pair of kings was pretty good for an accessible action-fantasy for kids. i have fond memories of it but i’m too afraid to rewatch it and realize it’s not as good lol.
💗🐾🐶🐾💗I still miss 101 Dalmatian Stress.
Wonder over Yonder was a great show to come out of it at least.
I loved I’m in the band, I wish it was on Disney plus
Irish person doing an ad for Scottish land got a little confusing.
Actually, GameCube controllers are widely considered to be the best Nintendo controller and were made compatible with the Wii U and Switch via adapters, and they are still widely used to this day. So maybe the GameCube controller was the one detail in Zeke and Luther's production that they actually got right.
Hell yeah, love Crash & Burnsteen . My favoriteDisney XD
Moustachiooooooo
Idk how ppl actually liked crash and Bernstein???? That show was garbage wasnt funny and literally a Walmart version of cousin skeeter
I heard established titles is a scam sponsorship
Oh shit that puppet guy looking kinda nostalgic for some reason even tho i dont think i ever watched the show once
Does the LS stand for ligma sugma
It feels weird that I remember all of these, Australian childhoods in our time were weird
I don’t care what anyone else says dxp was a good addition to Disney xd
As a massive pair of kings fan when I was younger the third season was the worst thing ever
I’m so glad that you mentioned crash and Bernstein, it seemed like I was the only one who remembered it, and I absolutely loved every episode of it due to Crash just being a chad
Lab Rats in definitely not forgotten
The villain of Randy Cunningham sits on his butt in a room all day and waits for someone to get mildly upset so he can corrupt them with his evil magic and turn them into a monster and an inhumanely stupid teenager in a Spirit Halloween costume has to save the day.  All I'm saying is Miraculous Ladybug ripped this show off big time
Crash and Epstein, I’m down
Pickle n Peanut was bomb, suck my ass that shit was good af ❤❤❤
This is the first time I ever heard that Disney XD had live action shows, so this is a surprise to me lol
10:51 I feel called out... Also, The theme song was my jam. I'd listen to it for hours while rollerskating. Wait..The guy from pair of kings was also the Hannah Montana guy?????
broooo one of the dudes from zeke & luther AND one of the dudes from a pair of kings got arrested?! 😭😭😭😭😭
Funny thing is, a lot of fans of Disney's current lineup of TV Animation have been getting into Randy Cunningham. Probably because it tries to combine comedy with something else.
Funny how Crash and Bernstein and bizzardbark are both hated on I might have to give this show a second chance because I really like bizzardbark
You forgot to put Brian griffin in the thumbnail smh😑
I was wondering for a long time what that show about two kings but they were from America was… thank god I remembered it…  Pair of Kings is amazing…
I’m glad you also despise pickle and peanut
“God awful intro-“ blasphemy
A lot of these shows I watched all the time but have ni recollection of until you talk about them.
*dies of nostalgia*
I remember all of these myself except pickle and peanut which I watched like 2 episodes of probably and personally I am still a bit sad that randy cunningham got cancelled, I think it was quite good and really went somewhere
I always assumed XD was meant to be "Xtreme Disney" or something
Surprised to see someone talk about Randy Cunningham, used to be my favorite show :)
I have literally been rewatching Pair of Kings the last few days lol
18:34
I liked zeak and luther and crash and bernstein
I’m not surprised RC9GN had such a cult fan base   I’m in a cult .😮
Its me, Im the hardcore Pair of Kings fan. Love that show and the opening song lol
So does Penn-Zero Part Time Hero exist or was it all just a hallucination?
Please do a video on kick Buttowski
19:41 there's a reason why I put this show in the ytp section of my brain
really
You forgot Aaron Stone it was the first Disney XD series it was extremely good
Thank you LS Mark, you’ve done our beloved show justice, and for that, I thank you 🙏🏽
I do think turning Disney XD into a boomerang equivalent for Disney would be cool
As for Pickle and Peanut, some say it's more like Breadwinners. Which stinks. Meaning if you DO like BW, P&P isn't good enough to be like that.  Also, watch Apple and Onion. It's a lot better.
Apparently XD Asia is airing jetix shows, the fact super robot monkey team hyperforce go is part of the line up. Also the Disney curse is real
I always dead laughing when crush head blown off that I was watching as a kid good time
I’ll never forget crash and Bernstein that was my childhood
Disney rawr xd
I always thought the XD meant Extreme definition to seem cool
I forgot Crash and Bernstein existed, thank you for reminding me of that masterpiece
Zeke and luther  Ginger has many shirts
"pickle and peanut sucks"  *proceeds to play the greatest thing I've ever seen*
Mark's username stands for Lord sMad Mark
Disney XD was popular in Tj and sometimes still is
12:25 That a decent gag
There were definitely some favorites of mine when I was younger; Wander Over Yonder, Lab Rats, and Kick Buttowski probably being my favorites of the bunch. A time long since past though, miss those simpler times.
When I saw the title of this video, I immediately thought of three shows I loved, Crash and Bernstein, Randy Cunningham, and Kick Buttowski.
i want to see crash,uncle grampa, and goku fight
I use to watch Crash and Bernstine with my brother… some of the best memories of childhood. So many funny things that shouldn’t have been but we’re to us
"Where's that Death Battle, Screwattack?!"  Who wants to tell him?
If it weren’t for Crash and Bernstien, I wouldn’t have met of my best friends. Who might as well be the Human Crash.   So in that regard, Crash and Bernstien will hold a special place in my heart
WHERE THE HELL IS GRAVITY FALLS
Mark... do you seriously think Crash would ALLOW himself to be arrested, you wouldn't hear about him being arrested, you'd hear about the US launching nukes to try and take down the interdimensional threat Crash poses to humanity
When i was younger i used to wake up at like 3am, sneak downstairs and every time i looked at disney xd, this show called kid vs kat was on
I wanted to rewatch Crash and Burnstein but I keep holding it off with other procrastinating stuff. Procrastination is hard work. Why the juice is it so hard to fit other procrastination stuff in one day!?
burbank is by LA, it's not so much of a coincidence. I don't know if you know that or not since you're irish
Bro crash and Bernstein was my shit in 5th grade I was so sad when it ended but I remember recording those episodes just for crash pure basedness
As a skater myself I loved Zeke and Luther growing up! Now it's just a funny memory
20:42 I think I'm gunna watch this show
i mostly watched  Disney XD because they would still on occasion air old disney cartoons along with marvel shows from the 90s but now most of it is on disney +
Motorcity?
What about Right Now Kapow?
As someone who watched Crash and Bernstein a lot as a kid, the show was wild. Like yeah it was low production value and had a lot of unfunny jokes but somehow that in combination with a true menace like Crash, just made the show all the better. It’s such an enjoyably weird experience.
I remember
I fucking loved Zeke and Luther. That theme song is an absolute banger
pickle and peanut is made to just turn your brain off, if your in any other mood, it's pretty bad. Bun on the contrary if its a Friday night and you've been working all day (school or actual job) Pickle and Peanut is an amazing show to just turn your brain off and watch.
I really feel like the show they have with a ton of YouTuber compilations just basically steals their content (never been confirmed but still) cuz like Seán is in it a *lot* and he's never once mentioned basically being on a show, not to mention they're just YouTube clips that DisneyXD thinks kids will find funny I'm not saying that they actually do steal their content but it's just what it seems like to me
kickin it slander is NOT appreciated.
I see some has been rewatching dbza
Please tell me someone here knows/remembers boyster 😭
Zeke and Luther felt like a mid 2000s show that just forgot to air for like 6 years
I low-key liked pickle and peanut, the outro was funny tho🤣🤣🤣
I actually watched Randy Cunningham on TV when I was in school. It has a lot of enjoyable aspects. I especially love the finale, and it solidified my all time favorite trope in any media, the main villain and hero team up to beat an even bigger threat. Glad you talked about it
Crash was my favorite!
Fanboy & chum chum and planet sheen goes HARD💪
BTW Established Titles is a scam.
Imagine not knowing Dorkus’ name from planet sheen 😂😂😂
As a kid I kinda saw XD as the "boy" channel and the Disney Channel as the "girl" channel  But I liked Disney XD, it's a shame it died tho, rip✊
I I kind of like Disney Junior I loved because he has a program called Sofia the First
What's the show at 14:44? I haven't seen it before.
I never expected to hear a LISA song in a LS Mark video but I'm not complaining. Pretty great video and trip down memory lane, as well.
ls mark but awesome
Hey Mark, this has nothing to do with the video topic, but the sponsor is actually a scam. Just wanted to let you know man
Another really good Disney XD show I liked when I was a kid was Kickin' It, got a black belt because of it
At least unlike him I love the pair of kings intro also I hate pickle and peanut
I realised one of the c and bstn sisters is the same  actor as cyd from best friends whenever
RC9GN, Star Wars Rebels, Motorcity, Max Steel (2013), Ultimate Spider-Man, TRON: Uprising, Kickin’ It, Kick Buttowski. So many good shows that I used to watch. I actually still do occasionally watch clips from these shows.
I grew up with Disney XD  One of my recent favorites was Tron:Uprising  Also, I'm hoping disney eventually release Motorcity on Disney+, I heard great things about it, but I haven't seen it for myself yet
Cookie evolved into cake, god damn.
Crash and Bernstein really thought they were gonna pop off being the Caucasian carbon copy of Cousin Skeeter 💅🏽😂 Baby YOU COULD NEVER
I loved Crash And Bernstein as a kid. The show is so perfect on capturing on the cool radical stuff with Crash and make it seem cool with the most epic rap for the intro just showed what type of show I liked as a kid
when i was like 10 i found out about randy cunningham ninth grade ninja and watched a majority of it on youtube because i was interested in the plot and the character designs were really good, it sadly has a handful of outdated and unfunny jokes, but it deserved a 3rd season and was still pretty good.
I was a casual Disney XD watcher, didn't really have anything I particularly liked except Star Wars Rebels tho
Crash and bernstein is an underrated masterpiece and no one will ever change my mind  Also mr Poulos is one of the best characters in the show, especially his famous line “GET AWAY FROM ME YOU WALKING RAGWEED”
Beware of established titles, it's a scam
LS Mark? More like L MARK (He will never recover from this) ((There’s also no reason for this I’m just trying to be funny man))
Would love to see a Toon Disney/Jetix video some day. That was my fav channel as a kid
Anyone else remember Future Worm?
Ok so I loved disney XD I remember pair if kings, kick in it, kick buttoski ,wonder over yonder. These all slapped 4 me  Also I remember pickle and peanut and having a hate love relationship with it
Kinda funny how Miraculous Ladybug took the whole premise from RC9GN
Ngl I actually liked Pickle & Peanuts theme song.
Is it possible Disney named it XD not only cause of the texting lingo but the high octane action programming would be considered Extreme (X-treme Disney, similar to the X-games being Xtreme Games)
I met someone named mouse today (legally). I found a family of mice in my car so I doused the inside of it with peppermint oil. Don’t care if they’re in there but I don’t want them to chew the wires and fuck up the car (also would prefer they just leave instead of killing them) I was tearing up the entire day, my ass went numb because I used WAY too much peppermint and everyone told me all day I smell like a freaking Wrigley’s factory, anyways I get my car inspected and the dude was like yo wtf. I told him the story, he says: “My name’s Mouse you definitely deterred me!” The other guy is like  “I know that’s really funny but his name is legit mouse.”  Turns around points to his uniform and whips out his ID. Hilarity ensues, I give him a fist bump and save humanity. (Ok that LAST one was a lie.)
Dude you should've gone over lab rats I loved that show as a kid I also remember being ok with kickin it loved Randy Cunningham and mighty med
I'm honestly so glad you talked about rc9gn and you liked it sdjfsdgsfdg it deserved more of a chance tbh. Also you should probably watch the episodes Ninja Camp and Enter the Nomicon. They're two of the best episodes in the series imo
Who is that dude you kept showing
PICKLE AND FUCKING PEANUT
Kick Buttowski retrospective when
Ik this is probably unpopular but my fav Disney XD show was “Two More Eggs” they were shorts and they were so funny to me
If only more people watched Tron: Uprising..... I'M STILL MAD DISNEY!
I remember liking C&B because when i was a kid i just liked how crash was not a average puppet.
Honestly I loved crash and Bernstein as a kid it was my childhood I was sad when they wouldn’t make another season it will forever hold a special place in my heart and the funny thing is I hated literally every other show on that channel
I WAS A HUGE PAIR OF KINGS FAN (still)😅
I remember absolutely LOVING Crash and Bernstein as a kid. I have fond memories of rapping along to the theme song, dying from laughter when watching it, talking about it to my friends at school, and my sisters completely hating it whenever I watched it. It's one of those things that I don't pay attention to in memory but when mentioned all of these memories rush to my head like a train going at top speed.
Pcikle and peanut kicks ass. Too soon for it to shine. Fun as hell.
I watched all these growing up
Does anyone else remember a show called Motor City or something? All I remember about it was an underground city and cars with copious amounts a guns, I really hope I’m not making this one up because I think it was pretty good
Damn bro I’m the guy who likes pickle and peanut. I think there’s some charm in being a regular show ripoff
Ok but what about Penn Zero Part Time Hero?
Sad you didn't walk about I'm In The Band hahaha it's still my favorite sitcom since back then
Wow to think you would call Death Battle screw attack after they changed there name this is defamatory. The only way to pay for such transactions is to review the show you don't seem to know at all.
Literally the only thing about Zeke and Luther I remember is that one episode was a full parody of the hangover  If you are asking what kids would have understood references to the hangover in 2010...  Yes
I loved crash and berstine. I love him because he reminds my of randi felt face.
Honestly I also remember Slugterra and Motor City. Those shows were peak tv for me at the time
hi! i was watching pair of kings as it was airing! i was the one who was like “THE FISH IS BECOMING A HUMAN!????”
Crash and bernstien was my shit as a kid
Ok, but the Polaris prime time 2017 summer block was my late childhood. Some shows like Parker plays were actual shows with YouTubers and not just clip shows.
I enjoyed Pickle and Peanut, probably because it was the least Disney thing on Disney Channel. It felt more like someone got a deal and got to have a lot of creative freedom compared to just following the "what does kidz think is cool" algorithm. Them blasting extreme metal whenever driving around really added to that feeling, so out of place.
The Disney XD verse is all connected. We have Oliver (Mitchell Musso) from Hannah Montana who went to be on Pair of Kings only to be replaced by Luthor (Adam hicks) from Zeke and Luthor…a show that also features Cookie from Neds Declassified who we see at 6:05 with Jake Short who would then go onto Ant Farm and eventually return to Disney XD to do Mighty Med along side Gabe from Good Luck Charlie who’s Neighbor was Mrs Dabnee who would join The current Disney XD/plus show The Villians of Valley View… and that brings us to 2022!
I remember literally all of these, this channel was my childhood. Randy Cunningham was my FAVORITE.
Interesting fact about kick...one of the people who worked on it was the creator of loud house....let that sink in.
Who here remembers androids
Best thing Disney XD did was Rebels
Adam Hicks wasn’t acting on lemonade mouth. 😂💅🏽 no shade but he can ACTUALLY RAP. I heard he wrote on lemonade mouth as well. And I’m sorry I LOVE lemonade mouth and his raps were great there which is hard to do under the kid friendly filter
I fucken loved Kickin' It back in the day along with Randy Cunningham. Nice to see some light shed on RC9GN.  Seeing Kickin' It covered would be pretty neat. My brother and I still quote it to this day, it can be pretty hilarious. It also has Lore which is hilarious in and of itself.  How the actors of Luther AND Brady were BOTH caught committing crimes and arrested in my hometown and I somehow never heard of it is baffling to me.  Mind blowing. Thanks Mark.
Disney XD is what introduced me to Doraemon in 2014, think that was the first time it was brought to America? I've been a fan ever since, so there's something to thank the channel for lol
I loved all these shows. I loved the fact they were twins on pair of kings. As a black person it reminded me of Brandy Cinderella where u had an asian king dark skin queen etc. I love color blind casting. For years racist would use the excuse of ‘the family’ on TV for not casting black ppl. This type of color blind casting is what kids need to see. Especially if ur in a family with a white patent a black parent and dif race siblings haha
All of these are shows I watched in passing growing up and mostly just remember very vaguely bc I've rarely heard about them since they aired. Also they almost all have a very specific memories tied to them in some way but nothing enough for me to ever think about them more than in passing. (The memories in question: Zeke and Luther was the first time I remember hearing the name "Luther" so anytime someone says "lex Luther" I think of this show. In Pair of Kings, one episode has a joke about "black eyed peas" and id never heard of the band so that's what I think of whenever I hear black eyed peas. And finally in Crash and Bernstein, for some reason anytime I hear about Portland Oregon, I think of the moment in the intro where they show the Portland sign and their apartment.)
The reason why the animation in rc9gn is different is because it was animated by two different studios. Titmouse handled the general animation, but bolder media did the fight scenes. Also there's more to rc9gn, then it seems at first. I'm making a YouTube channel to review all the episodes and characters of the show, to show just how amazing it is.
Crash and burn stein was insane to watch with my cousin when we were younger
I fucking loved pickle and peanut when it came out💀
For me, Kickin it was my jam. I revisit it the odd time with it being on Disney plus and it sucks but nostalgia amiright so don’t hate it Edit* Kickin it mention at the end 🙌
all i remeber about crash and bernstien is that there was an episode where they had to take care of an egg baby and that there was some joke about how all the boys in the class broke the egg baby except for i think bernstien? who then accidentally broke his egg baby after being finding out he was going to get an A, now getting an F. that's it
I love crash and Bernstein
Positive comment
You unlocked my Disney XD memories, like after school I would literally watch pair or kings and randy Cunningham
I remember all these shows
Lab rats was an amazing show as well miss that one
the only thing I remember about Zeke and Luther is an episode where one of them ends up breaking his leg and can't skate for a while, but then finds out there's a possibility he could never skate again.   I only saw the commercial for it though. Never watched the actual show.
So Crash is just Disney XD Skeeter?
I'm surprised you didn't mention how the VA for Peanut, Johnny Pemberton, responded to Cartoon Brew making an article about it by calling the people in the comments that disliked the show "cum-guzzling trolls [with] negative follower/following ratios". I know, it's a completely insane thing to say, but that's the only thing I remember about the show.
OMG I FORGOT IM IN A BAND!!! That was one of my fav shows on Disney xd
Planet Sheen review when?
LS Mark is horny
I have personally never disliked a video but when he said kick’in  it wasn’t worth mentioning I just had to
Sorry sir but I didn’t see mighty med on here
I don't know if anyone else even remembers this show but I was half expecting Slugterra to be on here. Since it actually wasn't I think that seeing you make a video on it would be pretty cool, I think the show had a pretty unique premise and you might even like it.
I hate that I watched all of these shows back when they were running
LS Mark is now cringe, he didn’t include Fish Hooks, he’s going to lose subscriber.
I hope you cover lab rats and mighty med at some point, mighty med is unironically really good. Lab rats sucks though.
1:16 Not only that but also the channel since 2019 started shutting down around the world, currently Disney XD is only avaliable on the United States, Poland, Canada and the Netherlands. I live in Chile and here Disney XD shutted down in april.
I never forgot Kicking It, Mighty Med, or Lab Rats because they are the greatest pieces of art in human history
i remenber tron: uprising. it was an animated series set in the tron world. it was my favorite and it seens to be forgotten but it was really good, story driven and it gets pretty wild since no one is "real" so there are pretty crazy deaths in the show
Here in Mexico that channel was awful, only reruns of shows from other channels, the few original shows like kick Buttowski, but man the movies were like f*ing 1 dollar movies most of the time and the programming started at 4 am to 12pm and then it repeated everything all over again. The ads were so annoying and repeated a lot sometimes it repeated the same Disney XD jumper 4 times in a row, but man o man there were 2 days 2 f*ing days that repeated the same Phineas and Ferb episode with the only break being the jumpers in between each repetition, if I hated it so much why I kept watching? Because where I was living at that point of time, there wasn't good reception and the only kids channel that was available was this ugly aaahhh channel, thanks Disney I hate it.
I only remember I’m in a band because of the characters is named burger, or at least I remember them being named burger.
aww mannnnn i love pickle and peanut...
Disney XD's fine I guess, but they should've kept Toon Disney honestly.
I remember watching Pickle and Peanut for the first time and thinking "this show is so hateable, but I love it so much". I probably wouldn't like it quite as much upon rewatch, but its off-the-wall humor was a fun contrast to the story-driven shows I watched like Gravity Falls and Steven Universe. I remember it getting better close to the end of its run, too.
20:42  🤨🤨🤨
I really enjoyed Crash and Bernstein I actually just finished rewatching it last month
I remember when all these shows were out and I watched all of them, and tbh out of all the shows I remember Crash and Bernstein was my favorite, with RC9GN behind it.
10:50
Mark I hate to tell you this but you fell for a scam, established titles is a scam. It’s a company based in Hong Kong that isn’t recognized by any official entity or person in Scotland and/or the UK. With the logic that ET uses, everyone that owns land in Scotland should be a lord. Obviously, that’s not true.
The only major thing I remember about Disney XD was how they aired Doraemon at one point. Even as a kid I thought it was ironic that the network that advertises itself as cool and edgy would air one of the most wholesome anime out there.
I remember thinking the Crash and bernestein opening song was the shit when I was a kid
He didn't hide Brian in the thumbnail:(
Finally someone figured out how much of an underrated masterpiece crash and berenstien
I always watched gaming show in my parents garage
Breadwinner and pickle and peanuts were shamless clones of the regular show. I know everyone already knows I'm just lonely and wanted to vocalize this
AHHHH PAIR OF KINGS and CRASH AND BURNSTEIN WERE SOME OF MY FAVORITE SHOWS 😭
back when i was 9 i was so scared that the crash doll would pop up out of my toilet that i just wouldn't go anymore
I legit don't see anyone talk about Kirby Buckets that show was so werid I physically can't understand why I watched it so much as a kid it basically was about a teen and his friends going on wacky adventures while his drawings came to life to hang out and be comedic relief it's legitimately the Disney XD equivalent to Lizzie Maguire expect way more confusing
18:34 I love Hugo’s stage bgm
I really like Pair of Kings when I was a kid. I was in the same camp too. I stopped watching once they replaced Brady
Wait… Disney XD Is Gone????
*i need your help* There was a series when I used to watch it  when I was little, I don't remember if it was from Disney, Nickelodeon, CN, there is a possibility that it was even broadcast on Jetix! I have no idea! I remember in the series there are two brothers and their older sister hates them, they constantly play games and imagine that they are in space, a forest, a kingdom and always their sister is a monster or something please I've been trying for years to remember what it was!!! Please help me and look for this series!
I remember that first time I watch pickle and peanut for some reason it scared me so much that anytime it was on i would run away
I remember all of these shows and I thought they were all good except for peanut and pickle that show sucked
i never forgot pickle and peanut and i never will, same for wonder over yonder
The only good thing is gravity falls
I’m glad Crash isn’t real or he’s be the guy found guilty of soliciting minors  or something
I thought crash and Bernstein was just a Ripoff of "cousin skeeter"
I definitely do remember watching Pickle and Peanut and thinking it was like a worse Regular Show. That being said, I don’t think it sucked and I did keep watching it for a bit even after I thought that, I guess I found the characters likable even though it was so random
Can you not work with established titles it's a hong kong company and a scam, please do research who you work with
Mitchel Musso may be most well-known for Hannah Montana, but he also did Monster House.
I remember watching mostly the animated series, Specially Kick Buttowski
I have to really thank my sister for liking these Disney shows because I was into sports, Discovery and animated shows like SpongeBob and Fairly Oddparents when I was a kid and would just watch these shows with her.  Zeke and Luther — saw a considerable amount of episodes and thought it was mediocre  (Never saw Planet Sheen, but saw a few episodes of FanBoy and ChumChum, didn’t really like it at the time but now I hate it) RC9GN — Never saw it but was aware of it by commercials Pair of Kings — amazing show with a good theme song, we only saw the first episode of Season 3, don’t recall seeing others Pickle and Peanut — the commercials alone show just how awful it is Kick Buttowski — loved it Crash and Bernstein — my sister and I saw the pilot episode and thought it would be good, but after I saw commercials of it, I thought it was stupid. We never saw anymore episodes after the pilot.
Dude I forgot kickin it existed until showed it go back
"Whatever, look what I found in your purse this morning" and holding up money may be THE sickest comeback I've ever seen
That means kick buttowski was remembered
Kick Butowski is great but I'm sad there was at least not a single mention of single handedly the best produced show by Disney which is Motor City
I grew up on Crash and Bernstein, Mighty Med, and Wander Over Yonder and cherish all of them deeply. I still quote WOY and MM and I specifically find both of those shows to be underappreciated gems. I was quite sad when I found out that these shows got canceled before they could truly run their course.
Crash looks like Walter if he was the edgelord son of Thanos
He should have added the Toon Disney era on to it and added other forgotten shows on like The Buzz On Maggie and Brandy And Mr. Whiskers on to the list.
'Pickle & Peanut' felt like it was trying to be the next 'Breadwinners', with how "in your face" and "lol random" and how despite that shows are at trying to be "hip" and "relevant".  But because this is Disney, they couldn't go overboard or stray from their family friendly brand, so it also felt very watered down and kinda bland.  Not complimenting 'Breadwinners' or anything, but just making a comparison.
crash and bernstien is the best
I wish he talked about Dude That's My Ghost but nonetheless I really enjoyed the video!
i forgot about pickle and peanut but now that you reminded me of it i remember there was a bloody mary episode that scared 9yr old me SHITLESS
Okay with the exception of Randy Cunningham, Pickle and Peanut, and Crash and Berntstein; I agree that Zeke and Luthor and Pair of kings were total blanks in my mind. Hell, I'm impressed people acknowledge Crash and Bernstein exists, I thought people remember the MAD parody version (Rainbow Dash and Bernstein) existed even more. I mean up until rewatching it on Disney plus I just thougtht it was just the poor man's Cousin Skeeter.(I must be even more out of the loop of what becomes a cult classic than I imagined.)
It worked on me and I didn’t even like the advertisements
established titles is scam @LS Mark trust me look it up
Bro, to find the commando crash pilot We need Blameitonjorge to talk about it I mean like Every time he talks about a piece of lost media, it's found within an hour.
as a kid i loved gravity falls, star vs. the forces of evil, and for some reason walk the prank and…. pickle and peanut 💀
25:25 dont worry ,im ready to sell out ,and search for this damn thing.. 25:24      25:20  /  or or                                                               /  or  or      25:23 (:
I remember reading somewhere that Disney XD stood for "Xtreme Digital".   And that made sense to me, because the rebranding was a pretty transparent response to both Disney Channel becoming girl-centric("Xtreme" being a word that pandered to young boys, albeit in the 90s) and digital forms of broadcasting television officially replacing the old analog methods at the same time.
I loved crash and Bernstein and pickle and peanut
The Mitchel Musso/Adam Hicks crossover album would be called Pair of Kings.
I'm back to comment again!
Yup pair of kings went really downhill in the 3rd season. They just didn't have the same chemistry
Watch kinking it , it might look like trash but it is a masterpiece in disguise. And HOW THE FUCK Is lab rats forgotten THERE IS A GUY THAT DID A 3 hour long video on it.
I literally only remember Zeke and Luther for it's parody on Mad
I unironically have always loved Crash and Bernstein. There’s always been something about it’s humor that sticks with me all these years later. And I’m so glad someone else has finally acknowledged it’s greatness.
I actually have a quite embarassing memeory acociated with RC9GN. Okay >Be me >Be in like 2nd or 3rd grade >Be in party city, looking for halloween costume >Find ninja costume >Buy it >Be stupidly obsessed with rc9gn >Be in the bathroom at night pretending that the costume was like the one from the show >One day, I ask my mom if I can bring the costume to school >She says "Son, Real life isn't like that show you like" >Realize that, I've been hella cringe this entire time That's my story, I still cringe to that memory to this very day.
Why did you not talk about the Ducktales reboot!!    😡
you GOTTA talk about two more eggs
I remember watching a whole episode of pickle and peanut and i felt horrible after doing it, like my brain just started to collapse. I think it was one of the last cartoons i watched on Disney XD, it was so horrible it made me stop watching TV
for some reason i never watched randy Cunningham as a kid bc my countries channel didn't dub it (until I found out that they did dub it but it was already too late) I found out about it when I decided to rewatch ninjago but I was too lazy to type the 'go' in ninjago and it came up in the searches and I was curious bc it was a disney show so I watched it and at first I didn't like it at all from start to finish it was way too obsessed with its fart jokes and I was dying everytime they made it. a few years later I forgot about it until I saw a post on it on instegram and I decided to give it another chance and omfg I was so dumb as a kid I should have appreciated it more. now I am dying bc there is no season 3 and I am still hoping to get one.
Kick n it was the best one and you should’ve included it
Crash and Bernstein intro actually goes hard. I remember watching the show but I didn't remember how much of an ass Crash was
Does anyone else remember this Disney XD sitcom called kickin it?
I miss kid vs cat
23:22 I’m sorry but this is the first time a Disney sitcom got me to do a comical double take and laugh my ass off
i remember Crash and Bernstein having me dying on the floor laughing
I was literally just thinking of crash and Bernstein
Personally pickle and peanut was my favorite show I used to watch it a bunch
I remember watching crash and bern and I loved it as a young child it was a great time
I love tim curry. No matter how shity the show/movie/game is, he still gives it his all
Yeah I remember Disney XD bro I just didn't watch a lot like Cartoon Network lol. 😂
Who would forget Disney XD?
One of the shows that popped into my head that was on DisneyXD was The 7D. Basically a revampped version of the seven dwarves, I remember nothing of the show other than that.
You’ll get raisins when you win
Team four star fan 5 videos in this video
Yo Mark where was right now kapow if that’s even what it’s called it was incredibly fever dreamy and I need someone to comfirm it’s existence
Crash will likely be arressted by drug possesion... but didn't consume it, just be chaotic as usual
Yes
I can remember watching and liking all these shows... except for Pickle and Peanut. Saw the animation, and I hated it immediately. I love the first two seasons of Pair of Kings but not the third. I can remember Zeke and Luther but not much about it. RC9GN is still a show a enjoy very much and honestly, I can't tell you why, I just found it funny.
Wander Is a God
I used to think it stood for Xtra Dimension or something lol. Thought it was the fancy version of Disney as a kid.
You should check out Penn Zero: Part Time Hero. I remember watching a lot of this show as a kid and even at the time I thought it was pretty underrated. Anyone else remember it?
I have no idea why but the Pair of King triplets unapologetically looking nothing alike and having no acknowledgement of it is actually pretty funny. Idk why.
It feels so weird remembering watching EVERY. SHOW. MENTIONED. In this video since I usually watch stuff on YouTube about something that is just out my generation.
Pickle and peanut gave me night terrors the first I saw it
woah jimmy two shoes was a nostalgic memory unlocked i loved that show and completely forgot it
I had a cringe flash back hearing the theme song of crash and bearnstien where I preformed the song in front of my second grade class.
Ayo Cookie killin it tho Also, that Crash And Bernstein fan art was so wholesome
Don't worry I'll make your Death Battle wish known.
I feel pretty embarrassed to say I liked watching Rany kunandham or whatever its name was..   I mean, just those jokes and Randy being clueless every episode of what the Ninjanomicon is telling him is a bit annoying, he just never learned
I loved crash and bern
Not gonna lie, Crash and Bernstein was such an Cool show I enjoyed watching.
No remembers boyster and counterfeit cat.
I remember watching before and after Brady left and I thought it was alright the humor was still kind of there and the action was still great from what I can remember
Randy Cunningham was not forgotten there’s a very active small community that I,,, know about,,, for,, some reason,,,,,
OKAY DOES ANYONE REMEMBER KIRBY BUCKET WHERE A DUDE DRAWS STUFF TO LIFE???????
Pickle and peanut reminds more of Mr. Meaty than Regular Show.
Man, i´m greatful for my country´s dub of every show listed here, their voices made the shows not so dependable on the story in each episode
I don't know if anybody know about "pen zero part time hero" that was on Disney XD
Jimmy Two Shoes was aired on Cartoon Network here in Australia when I was a kid. I never really watched it but i caught the backend of a rerun once, wasn't my thing, but then again 5 year old me thought The Garfield Show was peak so take that little bastard's opinion with a grain of salt
I remember All these shows
I never rly watched much of Disney XD cus i always thought that it was only for boys 💀
There was a person making a petition for Disney to bring back Randy Cunningham.
Randy Cunningham was the absolute shit still is!!!
Disney XD was my second most watched thing on tv really got after Cartoon Network. I just remember having both Disney and Disney XD and preferring XD because whenever I went on the main tv channel it was always some “Girly” show on (at least my kid brain thought so). I guess that might have just been bad luck with timing. Didn’t really know what time tables were so never checked them.
I wonder if you're going to do Gen X forgotten titles cuz there's quite a few of those
Remember Pickle and Peanut and Kick Buttowski on Disney XD?
OMG ur from ireland!? i had no idea u sound American lol
Yes skating is a sport! It’s even an Olympic sport now!!
NO don’t u dare call kickin it or lab rats “forgotten”
9:54 I feel like I recognize that kid from another Disney or Nick sitcom. Does anyone know who he is? 24:32 Is that Cort from ‘iCarly’?
Pickle and peanut was my shit when I was 8
I really enjoyed Randy Cunningham as a kid and it was really charming as a series. I wish it had gotten a 3rd season, as it really had a lot of potential with its world that I wish I got to see.
I always thought that the XD stood for "Extra Disney".
I used to love crash and Bernstein. Crash used to be the funniest mentally ill puppet out there
please make a video on Im in the Band. it’s one of my favorite shows from my childhood and it’s not on disney+.
Fun Fact: Kelli Berglund (who played Bree on Lab Rats) was also arrested
Tuned in every now and then as a kid to watch gravity falls, wander over yonder and maybe randy Cunningham but that’s it
My older brother and I just finished Zeke and Luther on Disney+ a few weeks ago, and we both loved it. The episodes are so fun and hilarious, and the bromance between Zeke and Luther is some of the best I’ve seen on TV.
pickle and peanut is only funny when your high
RC9GN is SO important to me so I was nervous, so it's wonderful to hear you enjoyed it and I'm glad you gave a little shout out to season 2! Such a lovely show that deserved a lot more.
16:05 Ayy, it's the actually good Xiaoyu theme!
You just made nostalgia punch me in the face a lot.
Think of pickle and peanut like aqua team hunger force my point is it's good when your High
HOnestly. A show I remember on Disney XD but like nobody else does is K9. I loved that show as a kid about the robot dog from doctor who
Great video Mark! Your definitely starting to drift away from the more “sour side” of your older videos from the past year and a 1/2👏 Should definitely do a part 2 to this at some point, if so one DisneyXD show I would like to see get discussed is Mech-X4 it’s this interesting blend of traditional DXD sitcom, combined with monster of the week mecha action. It’s also note worthy in being one of few live action series that use CGI for the mecha fights on a TV budget as a pose to going the Power Rangers route of just using costumed characters:/ surprisingly in my opinion it holds up better than I expected, and even has a pretty well done storyline! Highly doubt your opinions will be ANYTHING like mine but hey I like hearing em anyway🙃 to me Mech-X4 was pretty much my Evangelion, minus all of the religious imagery, gore, and “mayonnaise”🙄 still find it hard to believe that Mech-X4 is 10 feet taller than Eva Unit 01 what a world we live in🫠😐🫡🫥
Crash absolutely was my favorite Disney sitcom, honestly probably still is.  I don’t think any of the Disney sitcoms hold up to well, but none of them are as based as crash is. Plus the fact that crash, a being with limbs made from fabric and stuffing, can punch through a door almost effortlessly.
Hey jessie is a cult classic
9th grade ninja also had spin offs of it called 10th grade, and I believe 11th grade ninja as well.
I had found out about Established Titles being a scam sponsorship hours ago, and the very next 20-30 minute video I watch has an Established Titles sponsor. They're even getting to the smart people. God help us all.
It would be cool if you did some of the Cartoon Network shows like the old Lego shows and stuff would love to hear your thoughts on it
i would love a part 2 with shows like kicking it, american dragon jake long and such
I actually grew up with the Pair of Kings and still enjoyed it
Bro plz do a part 2 or anything Covering TRON UPRISING, one of the best things Disney has ever made on XD in their time before it was cut after 1 season
penn zero part time hero seems to be a show completely missing from people’s memory. I really liked that show though so you hate to see it.
the XD in Disney XD stands for Xtreme Dick
Bro... Randy Cunningham was the shit back in my day!
The nostalgia I have for disney xd is immense. For some reason I couldn't watch the channel live so I had to watch it on On-Demand.
"yoo imma let you finish but" did crash just quote Kanye?? he truly is based asf
Honesty I remembered crash but I was worried it was actually just some bad show that young me liked so I’m so glad I wasn’t wrong
"the 2010s was like the 90s 2" is a surprisingly valid mindset
Who remembers Two More Eggs on Disney XD?  Please.
I loved Crash and Bernstein when i was younger it was one of my favorite shows on disney xd
Pair of kings was my fav till the change happened
If Crash and Bernstein didn't exists we wouldn't have gotten the masterpiece that is Rainbow Dash and Bernstein from MadTV.
No Motorcity????
I didn't expect to see Thurston here...... Now I'm sad.
Ummm...Mark. I Just Found Out That Established Titles Is Actually A Scam I Found This Out By One Of Valiskibump's Community Posts Eariler. So Next Time You Metion Them Again, Probably Do Some More Rescearch BeforeHand.
Pickle and peanut. What happens when you take an adult swim show and shift enough things about it so you can air it to children
I'm in the Band was my favourite show as a kid.
I actually really liked Pickle and Peanut when it first aired. I liked it so much in fact that I would go into a pickle fueled rage drive all the way to my brothers house just to beat his children.
7:27 family guy joke moment
I will find the piolet
Kick Buttowski was my absolute jam when I was younger, I loved that show :D
I remember when toon disney and jetix combined into disney XD, I remember both channels always telling you that they are stopping and combining into what you know to be disney XD.
Randy Cunningham deserves more love, and I couldn't help but thank Mark for reminding me that Jhonen Vasquez designed the characters, since Invader Zim is one of Nick in the 2000s' hidden gems next to My Life As A Teenage Robot, El Tigre, among others.  I find it ironic that both Zeke and Luther and Pair of Kings feature two stars who went to prison.
Say what you want about Pickle and Peanut, but just know that it was LEAGUES better then Billy Nilly's Super Duper Subterranean Summer
I haven’t watched Pickle and Peanut in a long time, but I really liked it. But I don’t want to rewatch it because I’ll probably think it’s shit
My disdain for Pickle and Peanut is everlasting. Great video though<3
Im convinced that Mark plays tekken
I remember downloading an episode of crash and Bernstein on iTunes
I heard you were throwin shade at ma bois pickle and peanut.
Mark, you can connect the GameCube controls to the Wii. Also the Wii U had GameCube controller support during that time. But to be fair, the crew probably got a random GameCube controller and told the actor to pretend to play a video game and called it a day.
Yeah Disney XD was a strange place.
I hated pickle and peanut. But me and my friends would constantly reference the "friend ship tunnel" or pickles bird "little pickle" but in the end we hated and thought the show was cringe but had a retarded sense of humor that was funny sometimes
I loved randy Cunningham
i always assumed Disney XD would be like a new spin on Nick GaS, but unfortunately that never happened lmfao.
I thought establish titles is a scam
Crossover album called pair of kings return or our magical kingdom
I was the same way I hated when they replace Brady and didn't continue the show after that
Wander over yonder is my favorite show, a little sad you didn't talk about it, the 2nd season is so wholesome
There was a Disney XD show for a time called Lockie Leonard that was the second series of a weird Australian kids(?) show that had an episode where the main conflict was Leonard having wet dreams while his grandparents were visiting.  Just a fun fact.
I remember when my high school cafeteria had a flat screen TV and it played Disney XD one time
Does anyone remember aaron stone?
also naruto shipudden was on disney xd highly edited though but kept the openings which was weird .
I only remember Crash & Bernstein for an ad on how a guy suffers ptsd from Crash or something like that
You know something, I actually see Disney XD now as a almost the better Disney Channel, seeing as this XD actually now has pretty much only it’s better animated content rather than throwing in a bunch of sitcoms like the modern Disney channel.
Did you know that the child actor who played Bernstein on "Crash and Bernstein" also played Wilson Fisk on daredevil
Crash and Bernstein was the reason child me would go feral begging my parents to buy cable so I can watch it on Disney XD
Listen man, I’m dying for somebody to make motorcity relevant again
Crash would get hit with Rico charges
When i was young, i absolutely loved I'm in the Band, and i also remember enjoying Pair of Kings, but for me, after the premiere of Kickn' it, i tried my best and this is where DisneyXD died for me
oh man, the only thing I ever think about regarding _Pickle & Peanut_ was that i used to follow someone on Tumblr who worked on the storyboards. whenever people would express their condolences for working on such a shitty show they'd get standoffish and defensive about it. they also had some bad takes about Lilo from _Lilo & Stitch_ and later moved to Parler.  if you know you know
Crash and burnstin was the best show ever
I actually enjoy pickle and peanut, it has a very random sense of humor where everything’s bouncing off the walls for sure, but when it’s not all over the place it has that good very quick sense of humor that just runs a joke real quick but doesn’t bring much attention to it (which is why it’s funny) but I think it also helps in the shows favor as when the joke isn’t funny the fast pacing makes up for it and moves on quickly and I enjoy it, also the pickle has a large ass
Ah, Disney XD, the one children channel I had access to as a kid. I loved nearly ever show, there was just something about the XD shows that was just so, unique, about them and grabbed me as soon as I started watching. Nowadays yeah, I can acknowledge most of it isn’t so great when compared to mainline Disney Channel, but yeah I guess my nostalgia keeps me coming back every now and then to the good episodes of certain shows. In fact, it was thanks to this channel that I was introduced to Gravity Falls, Phineas and Ferb, and was given my love for animated shows in general, but yeah I’m more than happy to let this channel be laid to rest in the near future due to it not being supported as much as it was previously. Thanks for the memories and nostalgia Disney XD, but I’m happy to let it go.

I loved how the Crash and Bernstein theme song referenced Kanye West lol
Kick Buttowski and Randy Cunningham we’re my childhood. And I, too, hated Pickle and Peanut.
i did watch pickle and peanut did i did remember enjoying it but ofc it was weird and looking back it was a tv show that belonged to a channel that is not qubo and i watch the whole 5 seasons of lab rats and i did enjoy it and my dad too but it was not funny after when it had a elite force and that only lasted to 12 because it was cancel
Its funny how ben Schwartz always uses his same voice because im pretty sure he has done things where he shows he has some range
i like those shows.
As someone who watched Disney XD I liked it because it was more different than what was on the main Disney Channel which was nothing more than sit comes which I didn't like
WARNING: The sponsor of this video is a scam! Do not fall for it
Bruh why does NO ONE remember Parker Plays, its a Disney XD show that aired at 8pm, and its basically watered down DanTDM
watching crash feels like disney took a crack head, told them “do whatever you want but keep it pg and we’ll fund your crack addiction forever” and then started rolling
Guys he finally did it after his long career he mentions regular show this is a hint regular show is getting ranked next
Imo the running gag in pair of kings with the constantly regenerating vase that was broken in every episode was so funny to me as a kid
yeah but also wonder over yonder was pretty cool
Disney XD will forever be know to me as that one network that aired gravity falls and nothing else.
As a kid i really like pickle and peanut! As a teen i think its ok;never really watched all of it just like five episodes
What about that terrible shows with monkeys in space
Crash and Bernstein was my favorite show growing up
Anyone remember Kirby buckets? No? Okey
Kickin't, Lab Rats, & Mighty Med weren't forgotten but the best during the time, but Also there was RC9GN, C&B and Ultimate Spider-Man
Literally only used to watch Disney XD for the cartoons and I remember being obsessed with rc9gn for a bit, ironically I never knew Vasquez did the design, but god its so obvious looking at it.  I also remember watching a bit of pair of kings, but only like the last 10 mins or so before something like phineas and ferb or gravity falls came on, but I def remember being confused when they swapped out the actors.
The only thing I remember watching was randy and pickle and peanut the formers thought was ok the latter I was weirded out by
Fish Hooks anyone?
I grew up with dxd instead of Disney channel
I loved crash and Bernstein
DisneyXD and Nicktoons were the forgotten channels but I watched them religiously
Disney XD raised me as a child, although it was mostly the Marvel shows, reruns of Gravity Falls and P&F, the first 2 seasons of Star VS, and all of Ducktales 2017. Yeah, I'm a man of selective taste. Even my siblings didn't like most of what I watched.
So pickle and peanut wasn’t just an acid dream i had
Disney XD was awesome
The most enduring memory I have of Zeke and Luther is when they did a parody of The Hangover. Good times.
It’s weird that all the actors on Disney do crazy shit. I assume it’s to escape the clutches of Disney(they’re really really bad people)
Very cool that I’m not the only person who enjoyed jimmy two shoes as a kid.
Remember cousin skeeter? I got ptsd flashbacks when that puppet show showed up
The most forgotten show on Disney XD is by far Motorcity. I swear I’m the only person that remembers it but it had the most amazing animation Id ever seen in a Disney show. I would really recommend watching it!!
bold statement, I think about the crash and bernstein theme every so often LMAO
British
i will never forget randy cunningham
i was weirdly obsessed with crash and bernstein for no reason
god disney xd was such a huge part of my childhood, thanks for covering it! i saw you including yin yang yo at the start of the video, and that got me thinking about jetix. now THAT was the real #epic channel. did you know they had a monster truck??? i'd love to see you (or more people at all, really) cover it
In between my favourite XD shows, i.e. Phineas and Ferb and Gravity Falls, my go-to Disney XD live-action sitcom was always Mighty Med. It was actually pretty funny tbh I enjoyed it
I unironically like pickle and peanut
I remember watching a show about the 7 Dwarves from Snow White on Disney XD and it just disappeared one day and I never saw it again and I feel like no one even knows about its existence 😭
I actually really liked pair of kings
What about Kid Vs Kat?
I remember this old show on Disney XD called “parker plays” that took the let’s player format and did something interesting with it. The best part was that every game on the show was an indie game, meaning that small devs got to see their small games being played on  a relatively big tv channel
Sooo I am guessing while this vid was being made. This was BEFORE The Sponsored thing was known to be a absolute scam?
This is the most I’ve heard anyone except me talk about “I’m in the band”
I whith I coud see the pupet show becase I renever episode 1
I used to think the XD stood for extreme and I don’t know why. Aside from the x they have no correlation
I feel both Disney XD and Nicktoons are on borrowed time.  Not only is cable a dying breed but also those two channels are on additional cable packages that most people wouldn’t want to pay
I was such a fan of Pair of Kings in my younger years. Up until Michell Musso left (was arrested for a DUI lol).
Honestly I miss this era and I honestly don’t know why. I really miss going to watch Pokémon on Cartoon Network or gravity falls on Disney channel or XD during the week and doing homework. Also the many games I would play during the weekend like: Persona 3 and 4, Mario, Pokémon, smash bros. I love how you made this video because it made me look back on a simpler time in my life and miss it.
Find it funny how there is an even more forgotten to show on this
Pickle and Peanut wanted to be Regular Show so bad and fell flat on it’s face
Am I the only one who watched Kirby Buckets?
watching crash and bernstein on netflix in 2014 at the age of 5 was the best decision i've ever made
You know, there is one show that I saw on early Disney XD that I legit think no one remembers.  That show is Aaron Stone, a show where a guy gets the powers of his video game avatar that fights the baddies from same game.  I also remember it had an asian girl next door who I thought was cute when I was little, and she also gets videogame powers too.
As a kid. I always watched Disney XD over Disney Channel. I didn’t even know what XD meant, since it isn’t really a term in the Netherlands. I just watched it because XD actually had cartoons. Meanwhile Disney channel was mainly sitcoms. Which are absolutely HORRIBLE to watch dubbed. We didn’t have Cartoon Network, and Nickelodeon wasn’t really my thing because of the sitcoms. And basically the only cartoon being Fanboy and Chum Chum. I did watch SpongeBob a lot though
Ngl the rap went hard
I. love. crash.
I hate how I used to watch these shows and that I used to love them
I have über nostalgia for Jetix
Crash and Bernsteine was one of my fav shows at the time. I still remember it like once every month, and just can't tell if its awful or so awful its great.
Randy Cunningham will never be forgotten. Shame it didn’t continue longer.
Only thing I think is memrble about that show is how miz and the great kali gest stared in it
Me and my dad only watched Disney XD for all the animated Marvel shows and Star Wars Rebels
Lad Rats and Mighty Med was so funny, but Lab Rats Elite Force was so bad they just got everything wrong
lost it here LOL  24:58
Please give Kick buttowski it’s own video🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Pickle&Peanut is funny, i will die on this hill. Regular show is better tho.
Crash and Bernstein is a Guilty Pleasure of mine, it trys so hard to be cool, but imo ends up being so rediculous it's engaging to just see what crazy stuff they come up with.  My sense of humor is kind of broken
should have included aaron stone
Honestly when Mitchell Musso left I stopped watching because to me Adam Hicks could not act
I must admit, the "look what i found in your wallet" made me laugh I think its down to the immediate cut, but even so, decently good joke
Mighty Med was great and Elite force shat all over it
First thing I think about when someone says Disney XD is Kick Buttowski’s bubble butf
Crash will never get caught if they try he’ll just beat up the cops
Low key the crash & Bernstein intro is actually kinda good and I remember watching it as a kid and constantly laughing at crash's antics
I loved Randy Cunningham so much
i never forget crash and bernstein, my friend was banned from watching it and he would come over and we would watch that show the whole time bc we loved it
Idc about ratings I NEED a pair of kings reboot
When I saw the triplet reveal in pair of kings as a kid unironically I thought I was experiencing peak tv show and that no piece of fiction will ever surpass this sublime plot twist
I watched Crash and Bernstein on netflix when I was little and I was so sad when it got removed :(
i forgot all of these shows existed
What's the song that plays during the Crash n Bernstein section?
Fun fact: one of the crew members of Pickle and Peanut called haters "cum-guzzling faggots" on Twitter. How wacky! Can't find the tweet anymore for obvious reasons but I swear to Christ this actually happened at one point
Ngl the old Disney XD is really nostalgic, it was one of the only channels I really watched when I was younger, especially the show "I'm in the band", had the hardest theme song ever
24:15 Oh silly mark, ScrewAttack isn’t real anymore
Does anyone else remember Aaron Stone? I don’t think anyone else remembers Aaron Stone, & that show was one of the first shows on Disney XD!
I have only remembered crash because disney paid for an ad in the second to last issue of nintendo power for it.
Only thing I remembered about Crash and Bernstein was cross over shorts they did to promote the series, specifically one where they prank Randy Cunningham. Definitely don’t remember Crash being so *epic* though.
NGL, Miraculous is kinda like the new Randy Cunningham.
Establish Titles is a scam @LSMark, you are aware of this correct?
I've fully watched Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja twice (once as a child and one a few years ago), and I've never knew the show had an intro what?!
Bro Crash and Bernstein was the fucking SHIT back then. I remember around the time it first came out they would promote it on Disney Channel encouraging people to watch it on Disney XD (to which my family didn’t have) so I would beg my parents to buy access to the channel just so I could watch it. It would later stream to Netflix after a little while and that’s how I was able to watch it. Something about it and it’s humor appealed to me so much back when I was 10 and I was so obsessed with it, if there was ever a funny moment I would replay it maybe too many times and laugh my ass off at it. It’s good that looking back at it years later it can still be unironically hilarious at parts. Good ass memories man.
Pickle and peanut wished it could be gumball
A new Ls mark video it’s a good day
When Penn Zero is so forgotten that it wasn't mentioned on forgotten Disney XD shows......
Crash the 🐐
Atomic puppet anyone
Who here only know about pickle and peanut because of the sponsor they did to fgteev
Wander over Yonder was the crazy, zany show I loved watching loved watching next to TAWOG.
I started watching rc9gn 2 years ago and I still love it. I wish it would come back
Crash can kill Thanos
Fun fact: there was a real thing called Disney LOL. It was an app that gave you a bunch of random screenshots and gifs from Disney stuff that you turn into meme templates. Made a couple of those myself. It was a dark time....
If you do another video like this about Disney xd (which I hope I hope you do) can you mention gaming show in my parents garage
10:46  "Any hardcore Pair Of Kings fan"  *raises hand* I was one of them.....
I was more of a Cartoon Network/Disney XD/Nickelodeon person back in the day... Cus I didn't have Disney channel
If you review Lab Rats it would be awesome. Never thought it was good per se, but the concept and the show overall were so much fun!
I LOVE Pickle and Peanut! Still listen to that ending song today.
The GameCube wars LEAGUES better and had better titles than the Wii had, in the same franchise.  Don’t you ever disrespect the cube like that 💀
Lab rats will forever make me laugh
I used to love Randy Cunningham and Crash and Bernstein. Kid me loved that, and that show Kid Vs Kat. I feel like I'm the only person who remembers that show. I remember watching KvK while eating donuts in my basement, good times.
I dunno why I liked Crash and Bernstein. That show was pretty ass. And I hate puppets. Also, Kickin It was a good sitcom man.
Hello I have subscribe to your YouTube Channel
When I saw the sonic trailer my neurons activated because I had watched Randy Cunningham growing up
I always thought XD meant “X-treme Disney” or something. With shows like Kick Buttowski or Zeke and Luther kind of made me think of extreme sports or something.
Nah fam I remember these classics, god I wish I can go back this was really good
You forgot Right Now Kapow.
i miss pair of kings
It says Zeke and Luther is set around San Jose (Gilroy), but I always thought they lived in SoCal.
Sum tells me to keep they’re careers disney was like yall gotta make apology songs so the kids believe ur wholesome or at least regretful 💀💀
Sucks that you didn't talk about Kirby Buckets.
Holy fuck, I forgot about crash and Bernstein. I used to fucking love that show
I've never really watched Disney XD (I've mostly seen the Friday night block it had on Disney Channel) but even if DXD isn't good nowadays, it's doing far better than Nicktoons and Universal Kids.
Title is wrong! I remember all of these shows!
I miss randy bro. That show was crazy
I personally watched Randy Cunningham since the beginning and thought it was pretty good  Pretty funny solid animation and great cast
Gonna disagree that Randy Cunningham is a "forgotten show". There's a lot of fanfiction
I video documentary on Right Now kKpow would be very cool, I've never heard anyone talk about the show, and it is still really funny
Parker plays was dope no debate
Remember when Disney XD showed Naruto Shippuden? That was wild.
Forgotten? Nah man, these have been engraved into my head since I grew up with these shows since it was a part of public tv here where I am from.
lowkey hurt a little to see 9th grade ninja on this list😭 i loved that show so much and ig child me assumed everyone did too
XD was always better than Disney Channel, sad it lost support it was my jam in Middle school and early high school
I had no idea that Crash Bernstein was like a badass jerk character, and honestly kinda makes me want to watch that show, because the premise of a puppet who thinks he’s the big cheese sounds amazing.
17:33 weirdly enough  I thought that fosters home for imaginary friends would’ve benefited from having 11 minutes per episode rather than 20 minutes because I think the show can get boring  But for randy it’s the opposite I think lots of development and rooms for potential would have happen if it was 20 minutes
I miss and remember all of these shows pair of kings was one of my favorite Disney xd shows
Didn't xd replace uk channel jetx if I remember right? Used to watch pokemon, dinosaur King and power rangers on that
What about Kid vs. Kat?
If Disney xd came out now it'd be called Disney bruh
I remember the day DisneyXD replaced Jetix and to this day that shit still makes me mald
I remember when I saw Pickle and Peanut as a kid I thought it was an Adult Swim show
Motorcity and Tron:Uprising are so forgotten that they didn't even get into a video about forgotten Disney XD shows
bro anyone remember Parker Plays? jesus that was my shit back in like what 2017, still wish it got a third season, not to mention the fact it made me a fan of Parker's youtube channel
10:19 You watched them because you were based?
Never not he salty this was the channel that replaced Jetix
14:23 i just realized something  Jimmy two shoes  Goody two shoes  Ha ....
What about Tron uprising and Motorcity?
Established Titles is really establishing itself amongst my regular YouTubers.
Yo Kai watch. Just YO. KAI. WATCH.
I remembered Crash and Bernstein cause of that crash April fools thing
Disney XD is the channel I feel like most notoriously had the dub of Naruto Shippuden. Why they felt like a show that barely worked on cartoon Network outside of adult swim would work on a network far more stringent as far as content and a show that was far darker and more violent than the original more kid oriented earlier series. (Barely) XD was always a weird one to me. A channel that was always going to be a failure and it is but then again so is all of cable now.
I completely forgot that I watched pair of kings as a kid, if it weren’t for your video I wouldn't have remembered
Where is Brian Griffin!
Wow thank you so much for Bringing so many memories back in one video!
23:25 the most epic line in fiction
Day 3 of asking mark to talk about the movie HOME
I randomly found Randy Cunningham, and I am genuinely so glad I watched it. There were flaws, and the pilot was mid, but I ended up loving the show, I'm so glad its on Disney+ where I am!
I like Randy Cunningham Pair of Kings and Zeke and Luther and pickle and peanut are so trash I didn't want any more of that episode after the first fifth one
GL Charlie lab rats mighty med and especially Jessie are amazing though
I have had that show about the purple puppet doll thing on my mind for the past few months and have never been able to remember it so seeing it in the thumbnail was quite the scare
someone PLEASE tell me the name of the song playing behind the pickle and peanut review i NEED to know
Today is my birthday btw
Where’s slugterra
there actually was a drop Shadow on Zeke and Luther's to be continued too, it was just so big it filled the screen
lord sus mark
Wish you would've brought up the time Cartoon Network's MAD made a parody of Crash and Bernstein where the kid was a brony.
Can’t believe you didn’t mentioned tron uprising
Idk, I have never heard of DisneyRofl, probably because I am not from the Commonwealth and US.
Aaron Stone was one of my favorite
I understand why it wasn't mentioned but I think Wander over Yonder was a hidden gem during the time it aired. I remember being excited to watch the newest episode on the Disney XD app when it would come out lol.
I remember loving Kickin It as a kid. Netflix had a bunch of Disney sitcoms, so I watched Kickin It, Wizards of Waverly Place, and Lab Rats a lot, though I barely remember some of those shows.
I remember Crash turning into a cat
Also, I saw one random episode of Randy, never came back to it.
My dude you REALLY need to watch Mech-X4 and talk about it, it does try so hard to be serious and cool while at the same time trying to tell a good story, it does have a small fanbase, many people like the show, myself included.
XD was Phineas and Ferb plus a bunch of forgettable junk…except the LEGENDARY kickbuttowski!
I just remember kick buttowski, I don’t remember if it was any good though lol
I never grew up with tv but watching pirated episodes on YouTube or other websites all the stuff I wanted to watch always had "Disney XD" on the corner or during the ads and so I always though Disney XD must be the best Chanel that everyone would only watch
Honestly I think Crash and Bernstein could have an R rated reboot in the style of Ted because both are surprisingly similar in idea
Kick’in it is low key 10 out of 10
Was really looking forward to you covering Wander Over Yonder and Kick. Hopefully you can cover them in a future video.
I got a cameo for the guy who plays Mr poulos and he barley mentioned being in crash and Bernstein 😭 only talked about Santa Buddies. Makes me wonder if he didn’t like the show or something
I love how he uses ridge racer songs
watch out, Established Titles is a scam.
Pickle and peanut FUCKING ROCKS
I never thought of myself of being a particularly nostalgic person but wow this brought some memories back.
18:21 I think I only saw the second season which it sounds like you didn’t. The show is crazy, but from what I remember it had somewhat normal characters that had sane and cohesive thoughts. So when all the craziness was happening, their was still something that made sense and you could follow, and gave it just bit of heart.  It’s been years though.  Still liked it.
I hope Mark realizes that established titles is actually a scam
Am I the only one who felt the need to throw up when I tried to watch pickle and peanut
It weird they wrote Mitchel Musso out of the shows for thst reason cause they allowed him to cobtinue voiceing Jeremy in phineas and ferb and even got a bigger role in later seasons of it
ok WHERE IS SLUGTERRA?!
Disney XD cartoons were my childhood. Those let's plays shows were how I found gaming channels. Also the fact you called my childhood the 90s part 2 made me unmeasurably happy!😁
Randy curing ham was the first show I was on Disney xd it was so cool!
But LS Mark do you remember Supah Ninjas?????
In latin american spanish dub, sonic voice is made by a youtuber
Pac-Man ghostly aventures was on Disney XD wish it had a good ending not end on a cliffhanger
The crash and Bernstein nose voting was so strange and had a strange ending
We all know about pickle and peanut  We just don't want to admit it
Pair of Kings and Zeke and Luther were my favourite shows as a kid lmao, before I had taste in what’s a good and bad show😅
Pair of Kings and Zeke and Luther were my favourite shows as a kid lmao, before I had taste in what’s a good and bad show😅
What's the boppin' music playing during the Pickle and Peanut review. No I do not mean the theme song.
You'll always be Love Sonic Mark, no matter what your sponsorship transition tells me
The crash show is so bad it's good. Haven't seen it but if I can I will watch it to get a good laugh
Did you watch the season 1 finale of Randy Cunningham? It’s a two-parter that paves the way for the second season and basically see Randy and Howard mess up their timeline. The formula is around the same, but the run-time is longer if you wanted to check it out^^
you should make a video about the  2011 muppets movie
Man I was hoping you’d talk about Wander over Yonder, I remember really enjoying that show
How could I ever forget crash and Bernstein? Absolute classic
The first two were part of my childhood  and i didnt know about these actors also i loved to watch Kick Buttowski
17:10 Am I the only one that thinks this character looks like Alice Cooper
Aw man, I was really hoping you'd touch on Aaron Stone! I remember me and my friends, we were probably like 14 at the time, thinking it was SO edgy and mature. Every time memories of it randomly float to the surface, I wonder if it holds it, but no youtubers ever talk about it **editing to add, I fucking CACKLED when you called the 2010s "the 90s part 2". It's just such a perfect explanation, I can't believe I've heard it before
Pickle and peanut
What about camp lake bottom
Throw back to when new episodes of Naruto Shippiden premiered on Disney XD
Disney XD gave us Gravity Falls and Amphibia so I'm glad they exist purely for that reason.
Disney XD was a real trip. Does anyone here remember Two More Eggs or Right Now Kapow? Looking back, I don't even understand how they were greenlit if a typical episode in both shows was just a compilation of unrelated animations with only a few in each having a sort of plot.
I've seen the first two episodes of Crash & Bernstein so far, and I'm actually liking it...   What is happening to me...
Me and my younger brother loved crash and bernstein, we named one of our dogs wendal because of an episode of it. i think the context is crash was trying to think of a cool and awesome name and came up with wendal. i tried finding the clip but it doesn't pop up.
Lab Rats was one of the shows with the most potential, and ruined in the end season. So sad
Kickbuttowski was epic
I AM ZIM!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm surprised by how much I like the humans in pickle and peanut, from what was shown in the video. Having no lines really overlap (chin line doesn't continue, limbs pretty loose, etc.) allows for each character to have a pretty cool look anatomically that other cartoons, with different styles, restrict. Think of adult cartoons where the lines are stricter, and specifically women all look the same. Also I just like look of the chick with eyeliner. She looks cool...  Just looked up some human characters and... who is Wayne. I like wayne Yeah I'm gonna go watch the Wayne episode. Brb As I'm watching the episode I gotta say that peanut sounds like the main character from Hoops. I agree with peanut the wife was hot Finished. Wayne was really cool for trying to kill them especially since peanut sucks. But the swimming in the t-shirt thing made me sad, personally.
You undersold the crash and bernstein theme. Second verse goes so hard
If we get that Uncle Grandpa vs Crash Death Battle, the Death Battle Curse will aid us in our cause to find the lost pilot.
Me and my brother loved crash and Bernstein and watched it all the time and when we got Disney+ we immediately looked for it and when we found it we binged the whole series
I remember vaguely liking pair of kings and stopped watching after Brady left and I liked RC9GN a lot
randy cunningham is based
I grew up watching Crash and Bernstein, and I see what you mean in a "so bad it's good" description. I still watch now occasionally just for fun, comfort or just nostalgia. Plus, for the longest time as a child, I wanted to change my name to Crash 😅
Crash really is a chaos god
Did you know that Zeke and Luther did a crossover with another Disney show, but this show was not in English speaking show? That show was Pete punk a Argentine sitcom for Disney dx in Latin America. (and no i'm not joking it real)
Honestly, seeing Olivia Rodrigo and Jake Paul in the same room feels surreal now.
Id really enjoy seeing a sequel to this video. Theres so many other disney xd shows to talk about. Penn zero part time hero, the american doraemon adaptation/dub, and the fucking GOAT that is kickin it
22:48 Ah yes. I remember Crash & Bernstein. My head cannon always was his mother taking Wyatt to a Build-a-Bears knockoff on his f*cking birthday was so inconsiderate that Crash came to life to torture the Bernstein family for all of eternity.
i wish you didn't remind me about the show with puppet.
i LOVED crash and bernstein, in a very genuine way- crash was so funny to me and i still laugh at his jokes
Parker Plays and Lab Rats are by far my absolute favorite Disney XD shows. Parker especially had such a charm about him and watching his YouTube videos after the first season of his show finished was so fun. I remember specifically watching his playthrough of Minecraft Story Mode and it was so goddamn fun. Idk much about him but he seems like such a fun guy who really likes video games.
You forgot about Penn zero ☹️
Randy Cunnigham feels to me sort of like the 80's Ninja Turtles, in that I can totally see a more serialized reboot of that show being made. In fact, Rise of the TMNT feels a lot like if Randy Cunningham had a bigger budget for it's animation, they both even got Ben Schwartz as a lead voice actor!
Excited about this video and your new Animated Series.
Look what I found in the shower this morning... Euhhh... Whatever, look what I've found in your purse!
FINALLY someone is talking about crash and bernstein. I loved that show to death I even named my guinea pig Crash I thought it was the funniest show to ever exist
Disney XD stands for something right? Like imagine if the actual name is Xtreme Disney. That wouldn’t be right though, since the full name would be Disney Xtreme Disney.   I’m so confused…
ah   Disney xd   creator of the worse clone wars yes (:
Smiling friends in some aspects is just pickle and peanut done alot better
Crash and bernstien used to be good when it came out
Is crash and Bernstein just a white washed cousin skeeter?
Okay but Crash and Bernstein was the peak of my childhood on DisneyXD I’m glad Crash is getting the recognition he oh so deserves
I remember feeling the same way about Crash when I was a kid. It is exactly the way I remember it. The fact that you ironically enjoy it warms my heart.
I FOUND IT after some searching i found it  hears the link its pretty obvious why they canceled it  lol  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0&ab_channel=Duran
*sad tron noises*
Bro I actually used to watch crash and bernstein that was like my favorite show I loved it I completely forgot it existed until now
I was an avid watcher of all these shows. I only watched Crash, because it had a puppet as the main character.
I don’t like Disney XD anyway!! They really gotta bring back Toon Disney ❤❤❤❤!
Disney XD was one of my favourite channels growing up. I vividly remember watching all of these shows(except pickle and peanut, that’s new to me).  Weird tangent, but I grew up Catholic and never knew about other religious holidays, so I was really confused when Crash and Bernstein had a Hanukkah episode, and thought they made it up for the show.  God, I was dumb
I loved Disney XD when it came out because I was *not like other girls*
who wants to bet that Crash can definitely beat Thanos?
When do you think that Disney xd will come back
Pickle and Peanut was such a fever dream that I watched it while I was really badly sick and I though I dreamed it
As a Pickle and Penut former enjoyer, yeah it’s mid but the big nostalgia of me and my mom watching it on the weekends. Still revisit it sometimes.
CRASH AND BERNSTEIN WAS 10/10 WE NEED THE REVAMP
We couldn’t get the actual Disney channel in my part of Canada so this was my childhood. Gaming in My Parent’s Garage was my fucking life, man
Randy Cunningham was always such a mixed bag for me, even as a kid. The action and overarching plots told via monsters of the week called on my love of Power Rangers then (and Kamen Rider now), but the humor was always the type of "butt fart LOL" stuff I hated. I wouldn't mind seeing it make a comeback.
At least the pair of kings theme song is a bop
Forgotten??? NEVER  The theme song for Crash and Bernstein SLAPS
I remember watching Disney XD a lot as a kid. Was mainly a time waster. The only shows I really remember are Pair of Kings, Kickin it and Lab rats. Pair of Kings was my favorite but after Brady left, I stopped watching because I hated the new characters
I remember every one of these.
I actually think about pair of kings a lot, I used to love that show
i watched disneyxd so much when i was younger so i remember almost all of these, my favourite was always a pair of kings, the rest was just kind of eh... i did watch it but only because i was a kid and i had nothing better to do
established titles is taking over youtube sponsors
I guess yokai watch could go in that pile
I never forgot Zeke & Luther
How about Tron Uprising?
Unsubscribed- 1/10 he did not bring up Kick Buttowski 💀
I don’t care what anyone says, I know it’s probably just nostalgia but I love crash and Bernstein unironically, it’s so fucking funny to me, when I was a child I would quote it constantly and it shaped my style of humor with just how absurd it is I love it
"Imagine watching disney channel as a kid"  - this comment was made by the LATAM gang
We need Blameitonjorge to do a video talking about this legendary pilot to Commando Crash. We need to drum up attention so all the Crash and Bernstein connoisseurs can finally rest easy. (after the pilot's been found)
I remember losing interest in Pair of Kings after season 3 because of the change in characters lmao you're not alone
I remember pair of kings and I kinda loved it   But overall I loved xd more cause Disney channel was very predictable and kinda boring at times some were good but yea
I watch Disney XD a lot when I was 7
Pair of Kings was a crazy show idea back when I was a kid ngl.
One day while I was watching Disney XD, I saw one episode of crash and bernstein and immediately fell in love with this show, to this day it remains to be my favorite Disney XD show
Kickin' It was a pretty good Disney version of Karate Kid from what I remembered
I remember sometimes watching Disney XD, i don't know if i have a fav show that i liked to watch. It was actually a cool channel. Sometimes, on YouTube, i would watch clips from my fav shows from marvel or something. I also thought it was better than Disney channel because it doesn't have anything like Kirby buckets or kick buttowski.
Mitchell Musso also voiced Jeremy Johnson from Phineas and Ferb as well
lord super mark
When they replaced Mitchell Musso with Adam Hicks, I didn't like it. Maybe not as much as others, but I slowly stopped watching the show. I think I didn't like it because I liked Mitchell Musso so much from Hannah Montana. Adam Hicks was fine, and I really liked Zeke and Luther as a kid, but even as a kid I could tell that they just shoehorned the whole lost brother thing.
◑✚◔
i remember seeing promos for crash and bernstein
I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR PAIR OF KINGS FOR AGES I THOUGHT I MADE IT UP
Bad video, you forgot to add Brian in the Thumbnail
Man I remember trying to find Jetix one day and seeing Disney XD and just... never watching it at all
Crash reminds me of Yellow Guy from DHMIS. I don't really know why.
I got an idea  you could make a full video on Disney channel sitcoms
What about parker plays?that was a forgotten show
In france we had Inazuma Eleven on disney xd, absolutely amazing
It's not the First time a male voice actor has used there normal voice for every character in a piece of media that's been made I mean hello Biran Griffin for example
You forgot mr.young. thank you. It needs to stay forgotten.
oh god pickle and peanut was very strange me and my older sister watched it during the og run and i was scared of the Halloween special episode we tried to rewatch it recently and realized that this show was very strange for kids to be watching
i have no clue what to say but i genuinely love rc9gn so much, i saw the thumbnail and i'm shaking with pure joy. i re-discovered it in late 2021 (re-discovered as in i saw 1 episode on Disney XD one time) and i decided to watch it, i didn't really get hooked so i stopped but decided to sit through the rest of it a few months later and i love it. mostly now i just go back and re-watch my favourite episodes since i've watched the full thing almost 5 times since i've had nothing better to do. but seeing all these comments talking about it is filling me with so much joy, thank you so much for talking about it!
what was the song playing behind the pickle peanut review?
i used to watch pickle and peanut religiously
Disney XD was my shit
I've never seen Randy Cunningham but I was surprise that Jhonen Vasquez did the character designs!
Glad to see other people view Crash as the based chad that he is
I love pickle and peanut AND NOBODY CAN STOP ME!!!
I remember a show on Disney XD called Mech X4, kid me absolutely ate it up. You should review it.
Hey, you should've seen the greats: PENN ZERO: PART-TIME HERO AND SLUGTERRA
I loved Disney XD as a kid.  Fun fact: the channel was made to try and appeal to boys, but was more popular with girls. I guess me and my sister are a testament to that 🤣
18:21 Is that a motherfucking Lisa reference?
play the pinile and peanut obby on roblox
I always thought the XD stood for Xtra Disney
Bruh Aaron Stone gets no respect. That shit was weirdly good.
I remember the suite life and the suite life on deck were so horrible and annoying
“Who cares, look what I found in your PURSE this morning!” Fucking floored me
I used to love pickle and peanut lol
Remember Disney UwU?
As someone who liked Pair of Kings when younger, the 3rd season definitely had a drop of quality
the guy who played adam in mighty med ran someone over, not sure if he went to jail for it though. he’s also an nft bro now…
Kick and gunther 2 duds enjoying life in the most epic way possible
Don't forget about some Animated shows like Slugterra and Kid vs Kat Another live action show like Mr Young
Dang bro I remember walk the prank
Just to let you know, the actor for Cookie gave up a continuation for Ned’s Declassified for Zeke and Luther.
You should review Kirby buckets and kick buttowsku next
Please discuss I'm in the Band, I swear I am the only who remembers it among my peers.
I watched Pair of Kings a lot.
Oh come on, a video about Disney XD shows and NOT bringing up Tron: Uprising?! 😭💔 It’s unironically one of the best animated series Disney has ever made PERIOD.
The arrests of these actors is what Disney does to a mf
As someone who loved every single one of the shows in this video as a kid I can confidently say that I had low standards
Now they seem to be a Gravity Falls/BCG/etc. rerun house.
M
its been a while but despite not likeing live action shows at that time i actually watched most of the Disney XD shows.....so i guess my thought on the ones mentioned in the vid below... Zeke and Luther: Laughed once or twice but as a kid i just found it at least moderatly entertaining, also it made me want to try skateboarding :V Pair of Kings: Very enjoyable and watched almost every episode. Laughed multiple times and yea some effects were cheap but characters and setting kept me in. The actor change later on, yea i was bummed about it and never came around to it but still liked it overall Randy Cunnin- ya know: Pretty much evrything what LS Mark said, solid animation and action, character designs, fairly simple but cool plot n premise. This and Kick Butowski were 2 of my favourites from Disney XD Pickle and Peanut: Watched like 2 episodes and imidietly knew its not for my brain. The animation is creative and nice but anything else is a solid nah from me. Crash and Bern: again Mark summed it up pretty well. Sometimes cringe and trying to hard to be "rad" but i pretty much loved it. For sure in my top 5 Disney XD shows
Crash is the most epic character in all of fiction
I remember liking Kicking it.
This video just unearthed some really deep memories
Am I the only who thought of Steve (Krumm’s pimple) from “Ahhh! Real monsters!” When they heard about Greg from pickle and peanut?
I watched the crash show when I was a kid. I forgot what the show was called, but I remembered the puppet. The show was one of my favorites when I watched it when I think I was 7.
I remember watching Crash and Bernstein a ton as a kid. I haven’t seen the show in years, but from what I can remember, I would agree that Crash was the best part of the show. An absolute chad in every sense of the word.
I still think that slugtera was the most underated of the Disney xd shows there is a youtube channel that has posted the episodes so if you ever wanna check it out for a video its there
I remember zeke and Luther my favorite episode was with the famous monkey and them taking him to go to the zoo. Randy Cunningham 9th grade ninja was a show I also grown up with and it was actually kinda funny him using his friends body to get his back from the ninjanomicon possessing his body and acting like a “cool” randy
LS clearly means Ladam Sandler
RC9GN was the coolest show on Disney XD to me when I was younger, and as a kid with ADHD I loved how batshit insane Pickle and Peanut was, mostly ironically though.
I remember all these shows! this was a nostalgic gold mine for me 🫢
Oh wow, this one is a surprise.  A welcome one of course.
The fact that Two More Eggs is so forgotten even a video about forgotten Disney XD shows didn’t cover it
Crash and Bernstein used to be kid me’s shit  for some reason
Wish this was a full video on Crash instead
I did not expect LS mark to speak about randy cunningham. Still one of my top 10 cartoons
Great video, but to honesty, it's an absolute TRAVESTY you didn't cover the Yo-Kai Watch show. I'm pretty sure that was only broadcast on Disney XD. That show was (Unless I'm misremembering.) hilarious and clearly had a lot of effort put into it. Heck, I'm pretty sure they aired an almost movie-like special for the show, that's how popular it was.
Fools. I have NEVER forgotten about Crash & Bernstein.
I'll always have a soft spot for crash and Bernstein, and I'll always hope it'll get revived in some way
crash and bernstein was so weird in the best way possible
I literally only remember Zeke and Luther and Pair of Kings.
Oh, I wish Disney XD had actually been good. Because there were shows that were good.
“Whatever. Look what I found in your purse this morning.”  That made me laugh way harder than I really should’ve.
Zeke and Luther went hard tbh
Mark if you do a part two, please Include Kickin It, I grew up on that show
RANDY CUNNINGHAM RANDY CUNNINGHAM RANDY CUNNINGHAM RANDY CUNNINGHAM RANDY CUNNINGHAM RANDY CUNNINGHAM RANDY CUNNINGHAM RANDY CUNNINGHAM RANDY CUNNINGHAM RANDY CUNNINGHAM RANDY CUNNINGHAM RANDY CUNNINGHAM RANDY CUNNINGHAM RANDY CUNNINGHAM
I vividly remember that there's a kid named Pesto in Crash and Bernstein
I always watched Zeke and Luther, and Kick Butowski was awesome 😁🤘
What I did remember about Crash, is that when I was a kid, I watched it dub, as I don't come from a English speaking country, but the openings where all still in English or Spanish, so when I DID learned English, I just re-descovered these songs, I just cry. Cus'they're 2010 fire. Mainly crash and I'm in the band
So the ls means lord and savior
6:46 of course its in icarly.
Yup Disney Xd was my fucking childhood
I still remember Crash and Bernstein, That rap intro still gets me as I remember all the words.
Crash & Bernstein is bootleg My Cousin Bobby
Yo, I didn’t even notice this came out about 3 hours ago
There are a few other Disney XD shows that i know of from around the time the network began airing, those shows being Jibber Jabber and Kid Vs Kat. However I’m not sure if these shows aired everywhere as they were from the the Latin American launch of Disney XD, but I do think they might’ve aired in the states and the UK
Hope he does a episode on Jimmy two shoes
In America Pair of Kings aired on regular Disney channel
you saved yourself Mark, I was going to crucified you after you started talking randy cunnigham and said the theme song was bad but saved yourself on the last part and wait it was rigged animation?!! it was well done than because is hard to tell is rigged compare to other shows
Man didn't talk about future worm smh I'm not upset I'm just disappointed
Finally someone talked about crash and Bernstein
Crash and Bernstein was one of my favorites honestly and after this I really want to watch it again
I remember all these and more Disney XD shows like Im In The Band and Kid vs Kat. Disney XD was the best alongside CN
Ngl despite liking crash and Bernstein as a kid, for some reason I eventually started having nightmares about it and I have no idea why
I unironically love Pickle and Peanut. I watched it alot growing up and I still laugh at it. Something about it is just so funny
Kickin it was the best
Time to add LSMark to the "list of YouTubers that are promoting a scam"
Crash and Bernstein was hype af
Ls mark now stands for lord sexiest mark
I absolutely will not accept the slander for the Pair of Kings theme song  That shi had me hype every single episode 💯
18:24 i used to think that pickle and Peanut was actually good
Crash and Bernstein was my shit when I was younger. Crash was hands down the perfect being of chaos that Disney has ever created. So once realizing that they actually made a good show with a non annoying based character, they decided to cancel it... foe Jake Paul......
Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja and Kick Buttowski were the only good ones from the Disney XD shows in my opinion
What about Kirby Buckets?
Personal addition Camp Lakebottom, forgotten show on this channel and pretty fun.
Would Crash beat Brian Griffin tho? Also in 20:54 I thought you were gonna compare the tone with The Patrick Star Show, just realised that everybody forgot about that show looooong ago.
I’ve seen a ton of LS Mark videos, but this is the first time I realize his strange half-accent is because he’s actually Irish. It’s so close to an American accent, just every once in a while he will say some syllable in a way that catches me off guard.
23:28 more on this he isn’t wrong I just remembered that during their thanksgiving special for thanksgiving week Crash straight up just took over and started pranking different characters from different shows. And he doesn’t stop and the live action shows no he went after Randy and his friend for no reason other than and I quote “My friends Randy and Howard think their safe just because their cartoons. Watch me prove them wrong.” He isn’t JUST a force of nature he IS a force of nature.
18:22 Pickle and Peanut is a WORST Version of Regular Show
Lord Stinky Mask ☺️👍🦆
Who else remembers Jacob Two Two?
My old worship pastor toured with Mitchell Musso and played guitar for him when disney was promoting his first album. He said Mitchell was a massive jerk and couldn't stay off drugs for the life of him even though the label gave him plenty of chances.
FINALLY the original into song's back
In Czechia we had only Disney Channel, but it was full of Disney XD tv shows. No I finally understand why nobody talks about them, when they are mentioning Disney Channel shows from that time
Zeke & Luther was one of those shows it took a long time for me to get into. Pair of Kings it already had me hooked because of Mitchel Musso and Doc Shaw. All I remember about Lab Rats is that Naruto is in it. Kick Buttowski is probably my favorite DisneyXD cartoon.
god, i loved ALL of tgese shows when i was little. i still love crash and bernstein on the bases of how fucking unhinged every second of that show was.
Does anybody else remember Packages from Planet X, Camp Lake Bottom, Boyster, or 7D?
Funny enough, While writing a script about how some really good shows people like, didn't age very well, I mentioned how it doesn't really matter that the show was written for children, and here was I think "well, these shows aren't that bad *They were made for children* " This opinion is a disease we all have
I watched pair of kings...the first episode of season 3 was the hardest I ever dropped a series as a kid. Which is funny cuz I had zero idea of quality back then.
13:57 to me Randy Cunningham 9th Grade Ninja is truly the most Highly underrated and Great animated series from Disney XD 17:50 I'd still do think Ben Swartz is Awesome for doing the voice of Sonic the Hedgehog in the two live action Sonic the Hedgehog movies
Crash went on to become famous comedian, Randy Feltface
18:23 Fuck yeah its LISA! Never thought I would hear that in a LS Mark video.
For the record, Screwattack seems to be gone. And now it's just Death Battle.
Pickle and Peanut upset me since Laura Bailey kinda showed up in it when she stopped doing as much anime roles...
I wasn’t expecting a Death Battle reference
I was also upset about the king of kings cast change kid, I was also equally captivated by Crash and how unfunny it was as a kid
11:01 hey no!! it was an amazing theme song
Randy Cunningham on rewatch was honestly a lot better than I thought
Disney's Nicktoons Network
Crash feels like Ted if Ted was actually funny.  "Look what I found in your purse this morning." Is such an unexpected line that I actually burst out laughing, bro is just based as hell.
I remember enjoying pair of kings. I already liked Mitchell Musso from his role in Hannah Montana and I was really into adventure fantasy stuff as a kid.
Thank you Mark, I've been genuinely questioning if Crash and Bernstein actually existed or I just made every aspect up because I could find no info about it and no one I knew had any idea what I was going on about. I can finally be at peace
I was today's years old when I realized I don't know what RAWR actually means
Honestly, while I do understand why Crash and Bernstein isn't a very liked or memorable Disney show, that show was still basically my childhood and I'm happy at least *some* people remember its existence. I will admit, the show was extremely unfunny, but I died of laughter just by how dumb and how little sense it made alone. Thanks for talking about it, Mark.
That goody two shoes show. I always noticed how the leaders looked like devils....and the towns called miseryville. Should’ve put two and two together. XD
Randy cutting ham is like Greg hefly he wants to be popular and has A fat best friend.
I loved watching Randy Cunningham, Kick Buttowski, Kid vs. Kat, Jimmy Two-Shoes, etc
I'd remembered a lot from Disney XD from there forgotten shows
I could never forget Zeke and Luther, the root beer episode is cemented in my mind
I think Randy's friend ended up getting mystical pass for knowing because of some lore stuff
Does anyone know what the show at 14:44 was? It seemed interesting.
I think the show was more popular in Latin America
The network that absolutely no one had
17:11 "another sorcerer that they have to dick down"
i forgot about crash its an ok show and labrats is also ok just ok no more no less just ok
pickle and peanut would be amazing if it was like smilling friends, it kinda remembers me
Randy cunningham was my childhood
Mitchal muzzo DUI's in a studio kicks him, meanwhile Dan Schneider Nickelodeon...
hi!!!!!
Disney XD was the channel I watched the most for some reason. My favorite show that aired on there was Slugterra and I sometimes go back to visit it. Pretty good show honestly.
Only people born 2001 - 2008 Remember when Disney XD was alive  I was born in 2003 and I remember watching Disney XD around 2013/14 Until 2015 because I live in Canada and my Family didn't get bell fibe until 2013/2014 so I'm alittle late but I got to experience Disney XD's alive era none the less :D
Wait I thought it was replacing jinx
Randy Cunningham 9th grade ninja was part of my childhood, it was one of the few shows along with Gravity falls that had caught that similar Storytelling quality charm. I would love to see a revival on Disney+. Kick buttowski had captured that Rocket power vibe I remembered playing its online video games at my school which was really cool.
I really love Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja! He's basically Disney's version of Spider-Man! Also, I'm making my own Season 3.
crash and Bernstein was the best show i’ve ever watched tbh
Pickle and Peanut, is hilariously bad, it's kinda like the room
Man, you should’ve talked about Milo Murphy’s Law! It’s kinda cool.
You should've mentioned a show called Doraemon dubbed by Disney XD back in 2015, it was amazing, but unfortunately not many people really care about it now.
Hopefully crash doesn’t go to Bernstein 😟
Idk what ur talkin about, pickle and peanut is a masterpiece 💀
I watched this channel as a kid to watch yu-gi-oh every sunday
disney XD was my childhood (YES. CANCLEL.ME.)
Man I wish you mentioned Aaron stone. One of the best shows on XD simply ended too early.
Despite having Jhonen Vasques's character designs and Ben Swartz voicing the main character, I found Randy Cunningham 9th Grade Ninja to be an obnoxious shows that gave me a headache. And I found Kick Buttoski to be a way more entertaining show than that Pickle and Peanut garbage. And all the live-action shows pretty much sucked. Btw I really like these types of videos of looking back at forgotten content. It really surprises me when I remember old shows that use to be on tv. It's a real "oh!" moment. Keep up the great work Mark!!!😤😊😁
Zeke & Luther got me into Skater Culture lol RK 9th Grade Ninja was what I preferred over Danny Phantom oddly enough
Motorcity is one of the MOST UNDERRATED Disney XD shows! It NEEDS to make a comeback after 10 years!!!!!
It makes me sad how many people really hate pickle and peanut. I do get why but I do think it can be genuinely funny at times, it's mainly in the later parts of the show that really shine but the early episodes are pretty rough though. Of course I still liked, Kick Buttowski, Randy Cunningham, and Pair of Kings a lot, but I grown to like pickle and peanut as time went on. Also Crash and Bernstein is not good in any way to me and to me is so boring and only has me occasionally awkwardly smile when there is an ok joke.
I was really confused with the Zeke and Luther title card, I read "Zeke und Luther" and I thought it was a German cartoon lmao
I'm pretty sure you didn't covered Jimmy with two shoes or kick buttasky because cosm...oh right
Ben Schwartz went from voicing randy a ninja to vocing rise of the tmnt leo a blue ninja to voicing sonic who is blue clearly this was some kind of transition. also he voiced Dewey the blue duck in the duck tails reboot. I wonder if he just likes blue. In all seriousness I love Ben's work.
Quite depressing many of these shows are good yet they were left to be forgotten
eXtra Disney
Randy Cunningham 9th grade ninja, Kick Buttowski and Chaotic were awesome shows
I reacted the same way to the cast change and I was around the same age
I miss watching Disney xd at center parcs!
Two more eggs is so forgotten, Mark forgot to put it on his list
Speaking of forgotten cartoons, I bet I am the only one who remembers there being a Cartoon called Detentionaire. I dont think more than a season aired in my area of the US but I know in Canada where it was created it had like 2-3 seasons.   Very obscure cartoon from around 2013.
The "XD" in Disney XD stood for "Xtreme Digital" afaik, really trying to cater to young boys  ...also has anyone ever heard of Aaron Stone? That was like, their first ever original series on that
From what I remember, XD stood for Xtreme Digital. There was way more to it than just a TV channel too.
As a child I was glued to DisneyXD for the majority of it. I remember basically the majority of the shows that aired, and I remember all the shows I despised. I was also the same having to put up with the bad shows so I can watch my funny cartoon characters. I do definitely remember enjoying Randy Cunningham a lot and was actually planning to rewatch it to revisit some old memories :)
For some reason I used to like Pair of Kings, there is even a joke that got stuck in my head ever since about them having to save the other brother after they fight over random shit, then the guard said they must save him not only because I'd his brother and the king, but because the two together barely made up for one king.  This is shorter in the series, and I don't know why I explained it but here it is. I even had the logo as profile pic somewhere because I liked how it looks.
ah yes Disney XD the Jetix killer Also like the Tekken 2 Character Selection theme in the begining
why does this guy give me a feeling his a child predator
Anyone remember 2 more eggs? I hated that show so much
Lord Super Mark.
Ngl a lot of shows on there deserves more credit like penn zero and randy
Pickle and peanut was the worst show when it came out
My hatred for Pickle & Peanut was so strong back when it aired, I think it kept me from watching DisneyXD. Like, I couldn't risk accidentally watching it.  Another thing that kept me from watching DisneyXD was that it wasn't just available on regular cable for the longest time. Whenever I could watch it, it was at a relative's house and that wasn't frequent enough to get attached to any of the shows then. Whenever I saw RC9GN, though, it had my full attention. By the time we got DisneyXD, I was mainly watching for Gravity Falls (you know, when Disney shifted it there for whatever reason) and RC9GN was a distant memory. They also weren't playing reruns at that point, I don't think.   I've recently picked RC9GN back up, tho, and I cannot stress enough how fun it is and how ending it so early was a basket of missed opportunities. The fandom for it is surprisingly active if you look for it, tho :D
RC9GN had a couple really devoted fans on tumblr, my friend was one of them. But dang the one Disney XD shows that imho deserved way more attention was Penn Zero Part Time Hero - it was so good! I wish more people watched it...
I was a really big fan of Pair of Kings as a kid lol - like actually it slapped to me  I didn’t watch the show when the new guy came. Just, too big of a change.
I used to watch Crash & Bernstein. It was my favorite show back then. It was the ONLY show I binge watch all of.
right now kapow is one of the most forgotten shows for me. i love the show alot but the marketing was absolutly terrible.
so... when are ya'gonna rank every episode of south park?
I remember loving Randy Cunningham ninth grade ninja as a kid and i was really disappointed to find out no one else really watched it.
Pickle and Peanut is hilarious
I used to watch Disney XD right when it started airing, and that was also the time I started to actually watch Disney channel and, tbh I sometimes would like Disney XD way more than Disney, i didn’t watch allll the shows but most shows that got dumped on their from the main channel cause Disney thinks it’s too good if a show doesn’t make as much money as they think it should 🫤
Don't bother doing Lab Rats or Mighty Med. A different guy called Kayan Carlile made MASSIVE analysis' of all 3 shows that were like 2 hours EACH and blew up so hard that I doubt you'll ever top it. They're practically no longer forgotten.
Zeke And Luther was that one show that you’d watch begrudgingly when your parents sent you to your room, but didn’t tell you that you couldn’t watch TV.
Thank you for talking about some of these, I legit questioned if anyone else saw them as I grew up. I watched the muppet one the most and after some time I wondered, the fuck was even that.
Too bad you never mentioned the absolute banger that was Penn Zero: Part Time Hero, aside from the dumb ending the show was really good, and had a super unique premise. Goes to show the show is so forgotten that it isn’t even in a video about forgotten Disney XD shows.
Kinda hypocritical about randy being forgotten and not kick buttosky. Randy has seen a huge recergence
I really liked kid vs cat and MechX4
I... Watched all of this... Every day...well, except pickle and peanut, i may have a horrible taste, but even i have my limits
I loved this channel so much
1:30 Rest In Peace, thurston
mark i find pilot i swear
What the hell this is the third video of this day that has established titles as the ad
Crash&bernstein is the worst shit Disneyxd created. Loved kickn’it tho
I remember Disney XD acknowledging the hate that Pickle and Peanut had it even aired an ad focusing on the negative reviews it had with one kid even vomiting, crazy
Kick Buttowski is the greatest show ever 😊
With Daredevil and Crash and Bernstein on Disney+, the kids can follow the complete Bernstein history from how he becomes Wilson Fisk and kills his father with a claw hammer
You can never forget Pair of Kings.
Patiently awaiting the fanboy and chum chum review
What about wander over yander?
Does anybody else remember fish hooks?
I think the name is supposed to be a pun of (E)Xtreme with Disney, so it's XD
Ok I’ll subscribe
I just realized crash and Bernstein is basically a Disney sitcom version of ted
ong im sorry, i rewatched Pair of Kings plus a bunch of other disney sitcoms (good luck charlie, Mighty med, lab rats, etc.) and i cant explain i adore that show so goddamn much, Lanny is iconic as shit, Brady is fucking great, the world is actually interesting and expansive, and Boomer is just funny as shit, idk i cant help it
Honestly, Kickin' It was the shit.
please, dont ever watch player select. please.
You should do a video about Mech X4
Crash is based and a sigma
RC9N was too good to be 11 min type of show
This was all I watched, I’ve had the crash and Bernstein theme stuck in my head for years
Commenting before watching the video (I know, I know) but I grew up loving Disney XD’s cartoons. Randy Cunningham, Pickle and Peanut, Kick Buttowski, Right Now Kapow, etc. Can’t wait to see how Mark scathingly tears my nostalgia to shreds lol
I have absolutely no memory of Zeke & Luther
Ok but like how do these sitcom people get their toes stuck when their feet are covered in soap??
It was a warm memory
I remember hating the Pair of Kings theme song because they claimed that island was the top of the world and my neurodivergent 9 year old brain was like “umm actually isn’t the North Pole the top of the word?”  Also how is Commando Crash lost media? I was there when the were advertising it on DisneyXD.
ah the phineas and ferb rerun channels underknown shows.
I’m In The Band was my fave show which is sad cuz it’s insanely underrated and forgotten. I’ve been truing to find the Brazilian dub for this show for so long but there isn’t much
Ron funches was a regular on crash and berstien
So, Pickle and Peanut never aired directly on Disney Channel in my region, but it aired on a side channel that bought the rights for it. The same channel viewed anything Adult Swim produced (including Regular Show btw), plus Matt Groening and Seth McFarlane shows, Nickelodeon TV series based on DreamWorks - and also SpongeBob SquarePants, which was apparently rated 16+ as a joke. Yeah.  Both Pickle and Peanut and Regular Show were one of my favourite cartoons during my adolescense. IDK, I just... love the premise of unfiltered wackiness, including random character designs and weird plots. Though Pickle and Peanut DID lack compared to Regular Show or The Amazing World of Gumball, imo.
i actually have a lot of nostalgia about randy cunningham but i never see someone talking about it, thanks
I was a MAJOR fan of pair of kings. Idk why
I'm literally writing a crossover Disney channel fanfic and I know all this Disney channel stuff on the back of my hand, but then with Disney XD, I'm thinking "I have to do ACTUAL research now" 😭😭 By "research", I mean watching episodes shows I like and going through character trivias on wiki, but I didn't watch a lot of Disney XD, so I actually have to pay attention now 😭😭💀
As someone without wifi, I low-key miss the days where YouTube would be on cable. I used to watch vine on tv.
I really hoped you'd mention my favorite Disney XD show Penn Zero. 😔
I repressed Pickle and Peanut and now I remember it. God did it make me uncomfortable.
Surprised to not see a single mention of Miraculous Ladybug when talking about Randy, those 2 are VERY frequently compared to each other due to having almost exactly the same core premise. They do devaite from it in different ways tho... And miraculous is ofc Infinitely more popular, currently running through it's 5th season while randy is long dead
Randy Cunningham was a phenomenal show
No slugterra?
I watched Disney xd for three shows gravity falls season 2, lab rats, and mighty med and for the people who don't know what those 2 are mighty med is about children comic lovers find out comic characters are real and work at a hospital while going to school and lab rats is what if a child who's mother married a rich guy found out humans genetically engineered and have super powers/bionics while going to school Mighty med holds up way better
why roast rcngn
The Pair of Kings theme song was fire what are you talking about?
18:17 My favorite, actually. Loved this fucking thing.
Can we get mitchell and adam on meeting halfway
PAIR OF KINGS WAS PEAK THO TOP 1
The weird part about Crash & Bernstein is that Crash was both designed and puppeted by Muppet veterans, yet the Jim Henson Company isn't credited at all with production. Makes the show feel like an under the table deal behind the backs of the executives.
Anyone remember a barbarian show on Netflix that also ran on Disney xd
Nah Crash & Bernstein was top 5 💯
Disney XD is life
man became Bobby sands over the programme about the funny puppet in the army
I remember watching the Crash and Bernstein pilot all the way back then and Crash scared the shit out of me
Lets not forget that Gravity Falls aired on Disney XD
Crash was a goated Show. Change my Mind
U forgot penn zero part time hero lol
Lil Stinker Mark
Pickle and peanut was a good show i remeber it airing on disney xd it was very funny for its time but its sad it did get forgotton
Fun fact crash and berenstein got a MAD parody called dash and berenstein where it’s rainbow dash and the kid and I enjoyed that more tbh
Am I the only one who liked pickle and peanut as a kid
12:20 That actually made me laugh 😅
I used to love Crash and Bernstein
i watched crash and bernstein all the time when i was a little kid, same with lab rats. thank you, lord mark, for bringing these back to my attention
Penn Zero anyone?
XD is supposed to stand for a laughing face
I used to fucking love crash and bernstein, what the fuck was I thinking?
i only know zeke and luther because of a roblox event from 2010
Jesus Christ I’ve been seeing so many sponsors of established titles every video I’ve been watching stop it no one wants your pointless piece of paper
Disney XD had sooo many classics, this shit was my childhood
Im always amazed that the first thing people thinks about Disney XD is Zeke and Luther and other stuff and shows like Motorcity and TRON Uprising are let to rot by the wayside.
WHERE THE FUCK IS TWO MORE EGGS
I like pickle and peanut but only in like short burst like 1-3 episodes every once in a while
Forgotten? I remember all of theses
Wait Cory was in DisneyXD at one point?
What do you mean “remember” Disney XD? It still exists.
Anyone remember the gaming show that just had a bunch of popular YouTubers with unfunny cut-in
Did anyone else watch Monster Buster Club? I was obsessed with it for a while as a kid…
Disney in the 2010s was so random. Thank God they're not like that now.
I have also seen every single one of these! I was a huge Disney XD fan.
The strangest thing is that I specifically remember both Pickle and Peanut and Crash and Bernstein being promoted on ROBLOX, of all things. There were even in game cosmetics based on these shows.
I remember zeke and luther and pair of kings from flash games in the disney xd website, randy cunningham from actually wathcing it, peanut and pickle from some weird ads, and crash and  bernstein from the Roblox collab.
I am in the same camp as you, after Brady was changed I dropped the show and hated it
Funnily enough most of my Disney nostalgia comes from Disney XD, i don't have much nostalgia for the films aside from Robin Hood, Cinderella and the sword in the stone but the second i saw pair of kings in your thumbnail it brought me back. Funniest part of that is i was nowhere near the intended core audience, i just didn't gel with main channel Disney and also Disney XD got the reruns of all the cool shows like Phineas and Ferb and gravity falls.   i have distinct memories of that episode of dude i'm in the band where they're trying to get the main character to piss his pants for a music video. Shit was weird.
I remember I was into Crash and Bernstein, I thought it was decently funny. I recorded as many episodes as I could to the DVR.  I remember XD also had this game show called Japanizi: Going, Going, Gong, which was basically an attempt to expose US kids to what a Japanese reality show is like. It seemed like a really fun show and the host was pretty into it.
I need "I'm in the Band" on Disney+
I remember flipping LOVING Randy Cunningham when i was a child, same thing with LabRats and Mighty Med, thanks for the nostalgia hit.
Man, what is it with former child actors and committing crimes?  Just yesterday I learned of the official Diary of a Wimpy Kid musical (you should check that out Mark, btw), and that led me to discover that one of the supporting kid actors from the first movie fucking killed his own mom and also wants to kill Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which was a fucking wild side tangent to run across on a write up about a children's musical.   Also, Crash & Bernstein makes me wish Disney would make a new Muppet show. Maybe a BTS fake sitcom about all the Muppets living together and juggling their day lives and show lives.
0:28 the thing I didn't expect today was lsmark talking about my too favourite sitcoms . I was 11 ok ?
has anyone noticed that randy cunningham kind of looks like dib from invader zim  i know the same guy worked on both shows but it might be a good theory
I’m still never forgiving them for getting rid of Toon Disney & Jetix for XD.
I'm that pair of kings fan that freaked out when fish turned into a dude
Randy Cunningham was my shithttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvnQlY-mU3s
I remember crash and Bernstein That show was fucking hilarious
Why is the kid from Zeke and Luther look like the Neo guy who kidnapped Jessie from breaking bad
I actually watched crash and bernstein in my younger years, my thought process if i recall was "theres a midget and the purple guy has SWORDS"
20:42 SUS
before i watch this does anyone else remember kirby buckets? or kickin it, or fishhooks i'm sure there are atleast 6 different lesser known shows that have completely faded out of my memory that i haven't mentioned but for right now that's all I can think of also does anyone know what happened with lab rats elite force all i can actually remember is that there was some sort of a clif hanger at the end of season one and i never saw that show so did it end up being prematurely cancelled
No amount of hype will ever compare to anything I felt watching the lab rats s3 finale
pickle and peanut is one of the most dog shit shows I've ever seen, the fact it was disney's answer to Regular show is so sad because they even copied their catchphrase of "hm! hm! hm hm hm! hm hm hm!" and they made them say "bo! bo! bo! bo bo! bo! bo bo!!" which is just... nothing LOL
You should've talked about mighty med the best show ever made
remember the mad sketch call rainbowdash and berstighn
The S is silent
I think you could’ve included Kirby buckets it’s this kid who’s drawings come to life if I remember correctly I hardly see any talk about that
The three shows from this I enjoyed was definitely randy, kick, and crash those I recently revisited (minus crash) because I was reminded of them. Lab rats was there too but like a lot of shows that go that long I lost tract at some point
I'll never forget Tron: Uprising, the show that took all of the cool stuff from Tron: Legacy and bolstered it with a great story and characters... and tragically cancelled after one season
I really like Randy Cunningham, it had a really strong voice cast and actually does a good job with humor and jokes. It's a shame it got cancelled because the second season and ending has somewhat of a story arc. The episodic run time definitely brought this series down with that monster-of-the-week and rinse/repeat style. If you had a decent fill of the series, just skip to the two-part finale and you can be done with it.
Ah yes, Crash and Bernstein, a show I came upon in my early years and still enjoy to this day. I just stumbled upon it on some streaming service back in, I wanna say 2017? Not sure if Disney+ was a thing back then, but I found this show to be the shit back then, it was literally the only thing distracting me from my mom's roommates getting frisky in the other room (and making the damn house shake in doing so), while she was in another part of the roach infested flat getting blazed out of her mind and listening to Sublime.... Good times. Anyway, yeah that show has stuck with me into my teenage years, not because it's a masterpiece of a TV show, but just because I found it interesting compared to literally anything else at the time. It was an ok show, and I have a strange nostalgia for it.
*LSMark will be arrested in Burbank for dressing as s Squirrel and attacking people in the park.*
I don't know about other countries but Disney XD was actually pretty popular in Poland
I mean, it had phineas and ferb which was a great show I watched as a teenager, everything else however, didn't really care for it.
Somehow, you sold my SMG4 loving brain sold on Crash and Bernstein.
kick buttowski >>>>> any other show ever
I remember Crash and Bernstein, that was my favorite during my childhood and I still love this show.
Who remembers DXP, the segment that aired a bunch of gaming stuff like overwatch league?
Disney XD was also the place where Disney sent shows to die, like Wander over Yonder.
Me and my brothers uncritically like pickle and peanut we still remember this one quote from one episode were the just say "one way trip to the sun." And I loved crash and Bernstein like I still remember the theme song by heart.
sadly this channel worked on me as a kid I loved Lab Rats and Randy Cunningham
I actually preferred Disney XD over Disney Channel
@LS Mark I'm surprised that you didn't mention Tron: Uprising and Motorcity in 2012. It was the best shows Disney had on XD and Disney Channel at the time. Love to see more people talk about it as Disney truly good had something good until they canceled both after one season and forgot them. 😔😔😔
It's me. I was the diehard Pair of Kings fan as a kid.
Disney XD ruined my sleep schedule as a kid, I would stay up late just to watch reruns of Randy Cunningham, and I wouldn’t admit it but I enjoyed Kick Buttowski
XDXDXDXDXDXSXEXXSXSXS
I never forgot crash and Bernstein and I never will, I made a bet with my friends based on it. Release the Commando Crash Disney.
that one episode where crash attacks a scammer ganny still kills me today
I'll be honest with you, I don't see the resemblance between Randy Cunningham & Invader Zim.
Take a look at CGI pals it makes me want to die
Not gonna mention that Mitchell Musso voiced Jeremy in Phineas and Ferb?
The only modern Disney shows that I like are Big City Greens, Mickey Mouse shorts, and Bluey. I ain’t into non of that Amphibia or The Owl House type stuff. I LOVE shows like Gravity Falls and Phineas & Ferb though. The Ghost and Molly McGee and Hamster & Gretel are decent in my opinion too. And I basically just hate sitcom shows in general (except for Jessie, that show’s ok)
Established Titles is the new Raid Shadow Legends
Fun Fact the LSMark channel is a Disney XD show
I had fun growing up with Disney XD.  I had a massive crush on the hot girl from Pair of Kings (Kelsey Chow; now known as Kelsey Asbille, from Wind River and Yellowstone) and still have a poster of her hanging in my room.
Never diss Crash an Bernstein an all the rest of them less soo the Pickle show but still
When you mentioned kickin it at the end the fucking theme song popped directly in my head
Tbh I came here for randy cunningham in this video
Uh, What about “Penn Zero: part-time hero”? That was a Disney XD show.
If I had a nickle for every time Mark made the if I had a nickle reference from the phineas and ferb movie I’d be Jeff bezos
Pickle and Peanut looks like a bootleg YouTube video.  (Does a bootleg YouTube actually exist?... 🤔)
I remember watching this channel all the time as a kid even though I wasn't the target demographic since I was the sterotypical fairy princess mermaid loving 8 year old girl. My favorite shows were Crash and Berstein, Mighty Med, and a Pair of Kings. And yes I was pissed when they replaced Brady with that red head even though Boomer was the superior twin. I remember virtually nothing about the skate boarding one except that I learn what a leap year was from it since the red head was technically 8 since he was born on February 29th. Weirdly those shows influenced me a lot since Mighty Med (along with like 25 other shows) helped solidify my love for superheros and comics, Crash and Berstein was my first introduction into puppets and now I absolutely adore anything with puppets, and a Pair of Kings had a hot chick that made my 8 year old lesbian brain go AWOOGA
Lab rats is amazing wander over yonder is amazing kick butt to ski was good 9th grade ninja was good there was a show called right now kappa that I like crash and Bernstein is ok, but by god is pickle and peanut awful
Does anyone remember Kickin’t?
Really had to shit on Kickin It?
For some weird reason, I expected the last thing to be something like: Crash was arrested or something weird like that
when i was a kid i was so fucking obsessed with crash and bernstein i had seen every episode like 3 times and was so mad that nobodt talked about it and to this day i still quote crashes line "CROW NOISES, CROW NOISES"
I remember randy cunnington, pickle and peanut, kickin it, lab rats, wander over yonder, and kick buttowski, and I remember seeing ads for the purple muppet one but I don’t remember anything about it
The only thing I remember about Disney XD was that I had Chicken Little recorded on my TV from there, and that I used to watch that movie ALL THE TIME. I was a really dumb kid
if i remember correctly didnt the final episode of crash and berstein end with a doctor telling crash that he was gonna die soon?
Mark, why'd you give the most based music choice to Pickle and Peanut?  You gotta use your LISA soundtrack wisely, my guy!
:Someone: say space :Ls Mark: spece
I WILL NOT TOLERATE SLANDER OF THE PAIR OF KINGS THEME SONG
I've actually seen more people talking about Randy Cunningham recently! Which I think it's pretty cool cause it's not a bad series  Sure I personally don't think it's anything groundbreaking or huge but it's still a fun watch
Big City Green is a good show
Disney XD went from a teenage alternative to Disney Channel, to basically Toon Disney again, to a graveyard channel, to a channel that tried to compete with the internet, and back to a graveyard channel.
Disney XD Gale of Darkness
I remember actually enjoying Crash n Bernstein. It's one of the few shows that actually made me legitemately laugh as a kid. Most shows and cartoons were never directly "Haha" funny, just enjoyable enough to watch I'm In The Band was also one I enjoyed but feels very forgotten by most people
Dang, no Counterfeit Cat..
No one watched disney XD? Thats new to me, welp. I had fun with it, i think. It was enjoyable
I remember Bernie and Crashson  Best acid trip of my life
I’m surprised you haven’t brought up Billy Dilley, since it’s also a show that been forgotten after 5 years.
Damn I got baited by seeing the Paul Rudish Mickey in the thumbnail. I'd love to see that show get covered it's so overlooked
18:24 How dare you.
You are totaly irish urban tails fan
Oh boy another channel  sponsored by a scam. Don't buy those things, you don't own land or get an official title. It all goes into the pockets of some people or one that owns like 5 other sites like these. These people popped up a few years ago and got called out by MANY people that it is a scam, it's so easy to research about it.
Ls means L = Lord S = Sonic, AKA Lord Sonic Mark, but hey that just a theory
When I got Disney Plus, I watched Crash And Bernstein. I liked it, then I found out that they actor for Bernstein also played Young Kingpin in Dare Devil and every time I see him I think "Keep hitting him!"
In that exact same time, 4pm on a Saturday i turn on the TV and watch with delight Randy Cunningham and Dude That's My Ghost. Love them both not only because of the animation but the stories resonated with me when i was a weird teenager with a few friends. Randy Cunningham also has such a cool character development. It was this close to be a Gravity Falls if it was more serialized.
some disney channel series,aired on disney XD Like,even stevens,phil of the future,the famous jett jackson,the suite life of zack and cody,suite life on deck,cory in the house,prank stars,and some jetix series too like,oban star racers,digimon,digimon data squad,monster buster club,and some DC Series like,superman the animated series,batman the animated series
Crash & Bernstein is so fucking awful, I love it.
I was kinda sad you didn’t review Mighty Med and Wonder Over Yandor, as they are my favorite Disney XD shows.  Also Lab Rats was just worse Mighty Med but it was alright.
Funnily enough I think someone from mighty med was also charged for something/ accused of doing something. Keyan Carlile’s video was really informative.
Who remembers when disney xd showd doraemon the kids anime dubbed, a classic
I was genuinely terrified of Crash from Crash and Bernstein when I was a kid. I think I just had a phobia of puppets and dolls cause whenever I saw a commercial, I was terrified for no reason. I never even watched the show, it was just seeing him that scared me.
I love Pair Of Kings!! It did suck that brady had to leave but it wasn't bad!!!
Oh man, I used to watch Jetix so much when I was a kid.
The first one reminds me of the Smosh Movie
I can't wait for Crash to start his rap career
Shippuden was my fav Disney Xd show  I almost cried when they stopped showing it
I only has Disney xd growing up and my childhood was empty
I actually loved pickle and peanut to be honest.  I'm just not all good in the head with random and terrible humor I guess.
Ngl, I loved Zeke & Luther and Kickin' It as a kid but you just totally brought them out of the recesses of my mind... Where I think I'd rather have them stay. I'm gonna go rewatch Regular Show now.
I remember Crash and Burnstien because I still have the roblox collectables.
Kinda forgot there's one episode in season 2 of rc9gn where one of the characters figured out randy's identity as the ninja and almost got himself killed !
I never thought I’d see the day where someone remembered Crash and Bernstein’s existence. The only reason why I remember it so well is all due to this one episode where Crash was in a bubble to protect himself from germs only to get sick and start vomiting for a solid minute and a half. Little me was terrified of the show ever since. Truly the sitcom of all time.  Also the fact that I watched every show mentioned here during their original runs deeply saddens me.
No way a new video to eat my food to? LET’S GOOO
I love Disney XD’s Kirby buckets, so unique, iconic, and nostalgic.
The purple puppet show reminds me of that puppet comedian
Why are you talking about XD in the past-tense? It still exists, albeit in very little countries
I IMMEDIATELY clicked on this video when I saw Disney XD in the thumbnail, Disney XD was part of my childhood and its awesome to see more people online talk about these forgotten shows, also if you ever plan on making a sequel to this vid, you should check out Motorcity and TRON: Uprising, two great action cartoons from the same era, thanks LS Mark!
*sigh* Disney XD recently closed in my area (Latin America) and I already miss it. During it’s final years, they aired some of the older Disney Cartoons. The channel was actually beloved here and many viewers were shattered seeing it go (and with an abrupt feed cut with zero goodbye messages nonetheless).  I cannot thank it enough for all the fun memories it gave me. It’s absence makes my TV feel empty.   I also remember it fondly when it was known as Jetix (it was a full channel rather than a programming block here). Cherished childhood memories that now serve as fuel for my creative career as an adult.
As a kid, I loved Pair Of Kings and then they added in the triplet thing, I was confused and pissed- I stopped watchin it and kinda forgot about it til now. I vividly remember the mermaid episode though-
Here at 23,770 views.
Lord Sonic Mark I’m calling it
I made a video similar to this that’s really cool you did it to ❤🎉
Crashinfest is here  Everyone will cheer
Disney skull emoji
watch LAB RATS and MIGHTY MED
I'm not going to lie I did like crash and Bernstein especially the theme song
I thought XD stood for Extra Disney but spelt like Xtra cause it's the cool second channel
Yeah definitely was in the same situation with the Pair of Kings switch up when it happened. I don't even remember why but I just really didn't like the fact there was a new character replacing an old one so I just lost interest entirely in the show.
Crash was literally my favorite character ever when I first watched the show
yeah why not give me a mf'ing centimeter of land and call me lord Beegus sounds great
This was a nice blast from the past. I watched this network all the time when I was younger. Kick Buttowski was my favorite show.
Damn I got so much nostalgia from watching this video I loved Disney XD as a kid
I watch crash and Bernstein the complete series 3 times I’ve I found it out on Disney+
So ls mark stands for lord sonic mark got it
Mighty med was my favorite show back then
Honestly I loved Disney xd and it’s shows. Sure that may be the nostalgia but it was still goatee nonetheless
Disney XD tried way too hard to be “epic” but most shows went there to die if only toon disney and jetix stayed but good video LS Fart
Its funny thinking of how Mitchell Musso was replaced in Pair of Kings and how his other show got axed, yet he remained as Jeremy in Phineas & Ferb. Anyway, Disney XD for me was mainly just Phineas and Ferb & Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes. I vaguely remember seeing Total Drama Island on the channel. Also remember watching Pokémon on Disney XD until CITV took the broadcast rights for it.  I never liked any of the live action stuff (especially Zeke & Luther), as for Kick Buttowski, I regretfully didn't watch it as I wasn't fond ot the humor. Have not seen the other shows thou
Kickin It was lit. Also I legit loved Pair of Kings and watched it hardcore. And Brady leaving was awful and destroyed the entire trajectory of the show
This was such a nostalgia hit. Do a part two or other parts with different networks!
I remember being a little Weeb child and catching up on Naruto Shippuden on Disney XD because I havnt found my black market site yet.   What a nerd.
Marks family after finding out he is now a noble of the enemy Scots: 😡
Nah, Disney XD replaced Jetix for us in the UK and I hate that. I remember watching Ying Yang Yo before it changed... So upsetting.
I loved Kick Buttowski and Fish Hooks when I was younger, and to be honest I still do.
I remember watching Crash and Bernstein when I was 6, I loved it back then.
Crash is a force to be reckoned with
Disney xd the home of digimon
God I would get so irrationally angry at pickle and peanut when ever I caught an episode.
For some reason I thought that Crash and Bernstein was the funniest shit as a kid. I guess funny, loud puppet man really tickled my fancy as the little rapscallion I was
Bru u say jeil bro it's jail
What’s the music at 22:14?
I always remember Disney xd, kick buttowski, randy Cunningham, crash and Bernstein, wander over yander, and right now kapow were all my childhood.
damn the Zeke and Luther actor got arrested? I always loved that dude, crazy how much messed up stuff goes on behind the scenes even with the 'cool' disney actors.
I miss wonder over yonder so much, I wish they got to finish what they wanted to do
It blows my mind every time that Randy Cunningham had Jhonen Vasquez as the  character designer.
Crash got that dawg in him
I wanna have a 2nd Video like this with WoY so bad
I used to LOVE pickle and peanut it was literally one of the few reasons i watched XD
Man, Randy Cullinghams 9th Grade Ninja, I remember watching that's an loving every episode, Same for Crash and BURNstein.  Man memory's Freaking Unlocked.   And how could I forget Wander over Yonder, seriously what an amazing series. I need to watch the series again.
I actually enjoyed Crash & Bernstein. I enjoy any show that includes Muppets.
I wish more people like randy cunningham 9th grade ninja this was the show that show me the art style that i love and i love everything about it there is some episode that they can make more to take on but more or less is a best show  9/10 get it Also evil julian or ghoulian how we call him in the fandom could have turn into the next bill cipher if you see the show he was slowly turning into him
Crash is by far the best character XD produced next to Kick Buttowski he is the physical incarnation of the idea of giving a Muppet crack.
i did not forget Randy Cunningham i forgot half of the channel name but i like it I always find them in YouTube so i love it its still around
I remember all of these. I would watch Disney XD WAY more than Disney channel I was rewatching Zemeckis and Luther the other day actually.
Dude screwattack is dead the entire channel has been renamed death battle and they stopped making any videos that aren't death battle
I don’t know about everyone else but I remembered every single one of these shows
4:48 oh my god that got me 😂😂
It did mark a one season show based upon the Tron: legacy show that was amazing and like the movie, it was mostly forgotten as well.
Remember Disney XD had that one show called Dude That's my Ghost and another one called Almost Naked Animals. These shows sound like fever dreams and they were wild. Also that other weird cartoon about a boy who was also an oyster; Boyster💀
Just wen i thought my weekend would be boring, Mark saves it again 😌
they weren't really forgotten just abandon I guess
Finally somebody talking about Disney XD, I loved to watch that channel but somehow I thought some of these shows only existed in my head since nobody else knew them and I forgot the names of the shows.   Although I was and always will be confused by who thought XD was a good name for this channel. Because of that I always connect "coolness" with the XD
I just restarted watching Pair of Kings and it honestly holds up really well.
5:48 counterpoint: Zeke and Luther are both professional melee players
1:35 i miss Thurston, i hope he gets lots of tuna in kitty heaven.
I used to love zeke and Luther it's a classic, same with crash and Berstien it's just peak   Crash wasn't arrested because the police are too scared of him
Bold of you to assume I forgot Zeke and Luther
Mighty med was fantastic, and genuinely funny. Actually the best thing Disney has done. I shan’t take further questions
Crash and Bernstein was probably my favourite show growing up. I remember recording all the episodes on TV and watching them over and over when I came home from school. Randy Cunningham was also super sick and i loved that show as well
The only reason I remember crash and Bernstein is because there was a period in my early years where I watched it. But specifically I remember a moment where I was watching it and a lot of fucking blood was just running down my legs out of nowhere and I had to go wash it off. Crash is so powerful he caused my legs to bleed for no reason.     Not even God is safe from his wrath.      Btw that wasn't a joke that actually happened
Ok, now make a video about how they managed to make some masterpieces, you need to talk ablut something better-than-average someday, right?
Can we call you Lord *Saint* Mark?
I loved Crash and Bernstein then, and I still love it now. It's just so funny to watch, MORE PEOPLE NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT!
Lab rats was my guilty pleasure
It took me almost 20 years to realize what the XD in the tittle was actually for
Am i the only one who remember camp lakebottom?
I LOVED crash and burnsting
i loved crash and bernstein as a kid ngl
The most forgotten Disney XD show is Right Now Kapow
The amount of pain caused by stumbling  upon pickle and peanut when trying to tune into Disney XD to watch gravity falls is indescribable.
I remember really liking Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero when it was airing, but it seems to get no attention now. It’s not even in Disney+.
LS could stand for Lord n Savor
Wait, don't tell me, dude, you won't believe what happened
12:46
I would love to see a video talking about some of the less forgotten gems of the Disney XD lineups over the years especially their high budget animated shows like Motor City, Kickbuttowski Tron Uprising, Wonder over Yonder or any of the Marvel shows like Avengers Assemble. DisneyXD had some great animated shows that aren't talked about enough today but these examples are much less forgotten for good reason
bruh i forgot "kicking it" completely but i remember that show made me try Falafel for the first time
why do i remember pickle and peanut
finally, mark talks about Peak and Peak (pickle and peanut)
I watched a lot of crash and Bernstein when I was younger. I still remember quite fondly as well. I definitely see the flaws now, but crash himself is still a ball to watch.
I still remember staying up until midnight at my grandma's house to watch Randy Cunningham. I don't believe how I still remember Zeke and Luthor and Pair of Kings, and how I watched it with my sister along with Lab rats and Mighty Med and also Kickin it.
The LS stands for “Loves Sonic” doesn’t it?
Crash vs uncle grandpa would a insane fight but uncle grandpa wins
i used to love pickle and peanut when i was younger
Disney XD: Extra Disney?
I wouldn’t really call Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja a forgotten show. From what I found, it has its own cult following and a petition for a Season 3 made by some fans
I remember watching Disney XD a lot and my favorites shows were definitely Randy Cunningham , Mighty Med, and  Kick buttowski.
im watching this 44 minutes after it came out, love ur vids LS mark!
Funnily enough, Ben Schwartz also used that same voice for Dewey in the DuckTales reboot.
They haven't played choose your gamer and Parker plays in years
Part 2
Man I miss the good old days watching disney xd from my parents room or living room. Watching Gravity Falls, Wander over Yonder, Phineas and Ferb and etc, not caring the world is in danger or anything. I really want to watch disney xd maybe one day just to revisit my childhood all over again.
I fucking love Crash and Bernstein with a passion. It’s such a guilty pleasure of mine and you described it best on how it tries to be so hard and cool that it’s hard and cool because of it. I’m so glad more and more people bring it up
pair of kings unlocked a memory in me i didnt even know i had.....
i didnt forget randy cunningham 9th grade ninja!  Or on that note! Zeke and luther! Yeah baby!  i miss the whimsy of my childhood.
I just remember Crash And Bernstein so much cuz I thought one of my daycare friends was the boy
10:46: It's me 😭😭
Randy Cunningham 9th Grade Ninja is easily one of Disney XD's most underrated shows. I've seen it make a resurgence with kick buttowski.
I feel like I’m the the only person who remembers pair of kings
I wanna see a 2nd Video like this with Wander over Yonder
I thought the toe in the faucet comment was meant to be sarcastic, never realised there was a whole genre of comedy based around it lol
While Zeke and Luther wasn't my favorite show as a kid, I'll never forget the episode where Luther got a part of a bike stuck up his ass and every time Zeke turned it, Luther would become this unhinged madman that everyone feared.
Can't wait for the Ghetto Smosh collab!
0:08 CORRECTION: the XD actually stands for “Xtreme Digital”
WHERES RIGHT NOW KAPOW?
Crash and Bernstein is the most underrated show I've seen  it's not good, but I fucking love it, the show of all time /srs
Why tf does Luther look like ihe
i like to think disney xd means disney: xtra disney
22:41. Hey hey hey HEY, Bizaardvark was awesome. And as much as I despise Jake Paul as a person, him and Bernie were the best characters on the show.
Crash has now been arrested in Burbank for possessions of drugs.
Mitchell Musso also voiced Jeremy in Phineas and Ferb, but he wasn’t recast.
Max Steel was the one show that I remembered watching on the Disney XD, and it was a solid show with good animation, very funny jokes, and memorable characters to boot.
9:59 Umm… Mark? Zeke & Luther’s was on a black background
3:48 that music made me think I accidentally clicked on a rebeltaxi video
I remember all these lol
The pair of kings theme song is the rawest intro you tripping 🗿
Disney XD held on to Naruto for a while, until Adult Swim came to pick it up later that evening...
Quite Frankly LS Mark I prefer if Disney brings back Toon Disney.
I watched Crash & Bernstein as a kid, and I adored it being the 12 year old edgelord I was at the time. Of course, now I look at it with nothing but embarrasment but I can still recall some stuff about it that I found unironically pretty funny, ignoring how genuinely terrible the story of each episode is.
Mark are u from armagh? Because Im pretty sure my cousin who I havent seen in years (who's name Is also Mark and is also from around Armagh) AND IS ALSO APPARENTLY INTO ANIMATION could be you?? im like 90% certain?????? do u have cousins named daniel and owen???
ah... the memorie most good, some not so good
There was a moment in time of my Disney XD Arc where I would binge these all day, everyday
Pickel and Peanut is the worst because it gives pristine/ great show of Regular show a bad name
Finally some justice for my child hood. Disney channel was amazing but Disney XD always hit different for me as a kid. Thanks for bringing back the memories.
I remember watching Disney XD way more than Disney Channel, i don't know if it's just my country but at some point Disney Channel straight up died here only airing same 3 life action shows non stop mainly Violetta and later Soy Luna while Disney XD had all new cartoons and even better life action shows and when i check tv on rare occasions it seems like it stayed that way. Maybe it's because "XD" in my country is to this day very widely used and important part of internet slag while Disney Channel got reputation of channel only airing "girly shows" i don't know but it's always weird to me how westerners remembers this channel vs how i do, for me Disney XD always seemed like the "main" one while Disney Channel was on never ending life support.
Does anyone else remember Fort Boyard: Ultimate Challenge besides me? I remember that from Disney XD for some reason.
I liked Crash and Bernstein, and the rap at the beginning is awesome!
1:29 RIP Thurston
With the mixed media and random comedy, I wonder if pickle and peanut was supposed to be an answer to Gumball. And the similarities to Regular Show are coincidental.
1:30 rip thurston :(
I remember watching Pair of Kings when it came out.
I always thought Disney XD just meant eXtra Disney or eXtreme Disney
Champion Horse sounds like a nod to RRBM (Really Really Big Man) from Rocko’s Modern Life.
Ben Schuwartz not only used his normal voice for both Randy and Sonic, but also Leonardo from the Rise of the Tennage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Dewey from the ducktales reboot
I haven’t watched it since it aired on Disney XD, but I remember loving I’m in the Band and thinking it was hilarious. I hope one day Disney Plus puts it on its platform
Ben Schuwartz not only used his normal voice for both Randy and Sonic, but also Leonardo from the Rise of the Tennage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Dewey from the ducktales reboot
It's funny because they remove the theme song from Randy Cunningham
The only shows I watched on the channel was Randy Cunningham initially because I’m a big Jhonen Vasquez fan but it ended up being pretty nice. I also liked Avengers: Earth’s Mightiest Heroes. Unfortunately for me both shows were unceremoniously canceled after only two seasons…
“Crash and Bernstein” reminds me of that Nick show “My Cousin Skeeter” if anyone remembers that
Honestly thought Disney XD was just the end of Jetix and the start of Disney but Disney being them just wanted their name in it twice
i actually remember pickle and peanut me and my sister watched this
just yesterday i was thinking "is lsmark going to upload a video soon?"
Hear me out although this video about the forgotten shows about Disney XD is great and all but there is a few other shows that you forgot for an example 101 Dalmatian Street if you want to look into that.
Please do a video about cartoon network shows
Yooo Crash Bernstein was my shit! Along with Mighty Med and Lab Rats  Lab Rats from what I remember was actually fairly decent, I feel like it had a lot of ideas but it didn't have the budget for it. Mighty Med was okish, sadly I was not there when the two combined but if I did I would've lost it lmao
Crash and Bernstein has been a running gag with my friends “build a bestie”
Ahhhh Disney XD, the channel I would watch when I was a kid when Nickelodeon didn’t have anything I wanted to watch, thanks for the nostalgia trip Mark.  Also Crash and Bernstein was my favorite live action show because of Crash himself lol. Also also plz do a short video on Kick pretty plz, I rewatched it last year and I think it still holds up really well!
270th
You forgot about Motorcity
*I love when LSMark said "It's reviewin' time!" and reviewed all over the Disney XD shows. Truly one of the videos of all time.!*
Please do Labs Rats
I used to love Pair of kings!
I saw pair of kings so infrequently and late at night as a child that I literally thought it was a dream up until this video. I only bothered watching it because I thought the idea of twins being different races was cool since I'm biracial and when I just so happened to see an episode a couple years after watching some of the first and it was a completely new guy I was so confused I guess I just assumed it wasn't real 😭
Surely someone has already said it but Keyan Carlisle covered Lab Rats and the other two shows and boy the vids are long but legitimately worth the watch!!!!
N.. B.
Are twins with different skin colors possible?
I remember loving Crash & Bernstein! I binged it on Netflix back in the day. The reason I got into is is because I remembered constantly seeing it in a magazine in the library when I was really young. Like Elementary School. They had those same magazines at all the tables for the entire time I was there. So it was engrained into my memory.  ALSO MIGHTY MED IS SO GOOD, PLEASE WATCH IT. ...I honestly hate Elite Force tho. We never got a proper conclusion to Mighty Med, just a sudden spinoff that no one asked for, and takes place after the non-existent finale. Though I love its intro theme! Shame it's wasted on such a mediocre show.
I remember pickle and peanut I loved that show and thought It was hilarious, looked it up on disney+ and it wasn't there...
We need that pilot video 📹
I prefer Disney XD over Disney Channel. They air much more actually interesting stuff today than Disney Channel.
I used to think pickle and peanut was funny this is why children shouldn't have opinions
crash and bernstein wasn't something i made up in my head and i don't know how to feel about it
Xreme Disney.
Crash and Bernstein was amazing I tuned in every single day to see Crash and Bernstein content. I’m happy that you know what player select is, ls mark  This is a amazing video 👍
what is bro in the top left doing 😳 16:48
Nice toon Disney and Jetix were better tho
One forgotten disney xd show that i´m really surprised it´s so obscure is Aaron Stone, i mean yeah , by the time it premiered disney owned power rangers and aired it on Disney XD ,so A.S was considered a power ranger rip off , but in all sincerity , it´s a pretty all right show even with the  low budget and far from stellar writting team
Zeke and Luther and Kick Butowski used to be my shit. The king of islands was cool for some episodes
18:21 This transition music is fucking perfect.
I see Splash Dash, xd lol lmao
I am surprised he didn't say anything about Penn Zero: Part-time Hero because any person in my classes I have asked if they new it and I think maybe 1 person knew it.
What about Camp Lakebottom? That was on XD…
Who commented less than 1 hour after release? Me.
Randy Cunningham and Crash were both shows that I watched a lot of and are by far my favorite of these. I remember looking up Disney Infinity 2.0 figures and seeing a fake Crash figure and saying that I wanted it.
If you do another one of these try the 7D’s and kirby buckets
Disney XD was even better than Disney to me back then. Kick Buttowski, Randy Cummingham, Penn Zero, and Lego Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures were the best.
All of these awful Disney XD shows are on Disney+ now.
Ngl that joke with Crash stealing money from the mothers purse actually got a laugh out of me
Lost Media find the pilot of crash spinoff
i still love the pair of kings theme song
This channel was a special treat for me, because I didn't have it at my house, but my grandparents did. I really loved the cartoons they aired on there.
im not accepting the Pickle and Peanut slander
Me seeing Crash frim Crash and Burnestien in the tumb nail: ...I MAKE ALL THE GIRLS GO WHAT WHAT GOT A PICTURE OF YOU ON MY BUTT BUTT-
I used to watch Crash and Bernstein, I remember very little
Banger upload, Lord Mark
Crash and Bernstein was the only show on disney at the time that had an actually jewish main cast. like full blown Chanukah episode instead of Christmas and they call back to them being jewish repeatably. as a jewish guy this show is what I had in terms of representation so I have to appreciate the show for that alone.
26 mins ago
I still vaguely recall Aaron Stone. I was disappointed that Hero Rising is not a real game.
I never had Disney channel only Disney xd
Kick Buttowski and Randy Cunningham were like crack to me. I could not get enough of those two shows specifically.    PS. Only real ones remember when the internet was obsessed with crossing over Randy Cunningham with Danny Phantom and American Dragon Jake Long.
Channel 304 on DSTV
When I think of Disney XD, my mind usually drifts to Lab Rats. Not sure how it holds up nowadays, but I do have fond memories of it though.
Man I loved Randy Cunningham , still wish it got a 3rd season
the only thing that can stop the monster crash is apparently mustaches, im not even kidding
Mark do you like Bojangles
How could you not mention Kick Buttowski? That show was awesome and I would watch it all the time when I was younger
I thought Crash and Bernstein was a fever dream
Lord Satan Mark
No Brian Grifffin in the thumbnail?
I find it bizarre how Disney XD is still going, despite Disney not caring about it. I barely watched the channel growing up, but without it, I wouldn't have come across Gravity Falls, Phineas and Ferb, etc. But still, it's weird how much they hyped it up, only for it to fall into obscurity by the mid-2010s, and have most of the international channels shut down for Disney+.
I was a pair of kings fan 💀😭
My mom loved the ninja show
I think the random episode order is more of a Disney+ issue, some of their shows have episodes in random order for no apparent reason.
11:02  Am I the only one who loved the catchy theme song?
I used to watch crash and ernie as a kid.
i love watching disney lol 😂
First ten seconds got me to like
I tried so hard to find Disney XD as a kid, but I was never able to figure out which channel it was.  I eventually gave up when my parents canceled cable for streaming services
Crash shares the same performer as Oobi and Arty Smartypants from Between the Lions. You're welcome.
Damn bro good shit
I remember being into Pickle and Peanut as a kid but then I watched a bad review of it on yt and decided to not like it anymore I was spineless lmao
guys do NOT go to 13:36!!! do not!!!
ABOUT Disney XD...Sky had a falling-out with Disney and because of this, Disney wouldn't air their channels on Sky anymore! So when I woke up early one day, Disney XD said it was "no longer on Sky". I cried that day. Also for some reason it appealed to me, and I'M also Irish
Pickle and peanut goes hard fr (NOT sarcasm)
I watched all these shows as a kid! I had weird tastes
As an 8 year old I was the hardcore Pair Of Kings fan
Zeke and Luther is my and brother's favorite show. Reminds us of Drake and Josh but on Disney XD.
I remember a time when Disney XD did some gaming shows back in 2017 that was basically a watered down version of gamer YouTubers. They censored almost EVERYTHING with cute kitten to block out the blood and gore whenever Jacksepticeye would play Happy Wheels! That's also how I actually found  jacksepticeye, Coryxkenshin, Cinnamon Toast Ken, Crankgamesplays, and ame Grumps! 🎮
The only ones I remember were Randy and Pickle and Peanut, crazy.
You forgot Right Now Kapow
Randy Cunningham deserves much more space in the thumb smh, it is definitely the reason people clicked on this
Remember when Disney XD showed E3? Watching all of the Smash Bros. announcements on Disney XD was great, but as for everything else... what was Disney thinking?
does anyone remember pranksgiving?
I was so pissed when JETIX rebraned to this, they took away my Digimon and Power ranger and replaced it with Sitcoms too unfunny for the main channel and Phineas and Ferb reruns which were already on the main channel!
I Feel bad for yuji naka he's in the video of aressted celebrites from mark's chiloodhood
The only episode of gravity falls they didn’t have was a tale of two stans
My stomach sank when mark started talking about pickle and peanut and idk why
Oh that’s were Malik from House of Payne went 😂
Mark, there is so much nostalgia in this video, that I can't take it. I don't care if most of these weren't that good, this is MY ERA, and I ACCEPT THEM ALL!! XD  Except Crash and Bernstein. I only remember the intro. Complete and total blur otherwise.
18:26 how dare u
Should have included fish hooks. Does anyone remember that show
The animation studios for Randy Cunningham (Titmouse and Boulder Media) definitely help to make the action more fluid. This was also the show that introduced me to Ben Schwartz, and he nails the role of Randy, though I wonder how James Arnold Taylor would've been in the role. Also, the creators of the show (Jed Elinoff & Scott Thomas) worked on Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated, which helps out.
KICK! KICK! KICK! KICK! KICK BUTTOWSKI
*_cries in no billy dilly's subterranean something something i don't remember the name_*
One of my friends likes to randomly make fun of Crash and Bernstein, and I can definitely see why.
I thought a lot of Disney xd's shows were boring (the live action ones)..
Wait, Randy Cunningham 9th Grade Ninja was forgotten? That's WONK!
theres a show called "kirby buckets" i never heard of that disney xd show until a few months ago, i watched it on disney plus and i gotta say it was very forgettable. You should check it out and maybe make a video about it.
L. S. Mark = Lord Sanic Mark
Crash and Bernstein was literally my childhood. I would quote that show so much as a kid that my entire family hates it now. Something about the surrealist humor just clicked with ten-year-old me. I still have fond memories of the show, it’s not top-tier entertainment by any means, yeah it’s dated and pandering to edgy fourth graders, but it’s just fun and ridiculous that I can’t help but smile at it even to this day. I still revisit it occasionally, if only to remember what a bizarre kid I was. I also remember Pair of Kings, but I wasn’t quite as in love with that show as I was with C&B. Thanks for reminding me of my embarrassing childhood, ginger cartoon man. Cheers!
Pair of Kings was all-time favorite growing up. I still listen to the theme song every now and then. 🤴🏻🤴🏾
I miss "Wander Over Yonder".
If Disney XD came out a couple years ago, it'd be "Disney 😝" or something
I used to love Disney XD (also I remember they for some reason used to play dubstep music like skrillex all the time)
I think we can forget about these. (except Randy)
He called the Pair of Kings intro terrible how could you
I remember Disneyuwu
Some shows that should have been added https://youtu.be/rHe2HRgUyrY
Randy Cunningham is so fucking GOATED, imo it's on the same level of quality as Danny Phantom and Ben 10.  I pray they'll revive the show somehow
I mained Crash in some random car racer game
The old XD micky shorts went hard
Oh my god I thought I was the only MF on earth that actually remembered Crash and Bernstein
Walk the prank was weird as hell
crash and bernstein is like my biggest guilty pleasure, i get so much ironic enjoyment from it, it is so stupid
Crash and Burnstein, Zeke and Luther, Randy Cunningham 9th Grade Ninja, Pair of Kings, Mickey Mouse shorts, Pickle and Peanut.
Why
I loved DisneyXD, anything from Phineas and Ferb to gamers guide to star versus the force of the univers to Jessie
I will hold the fact that Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja, did Miraculous Ladybug but in America gloriously.
Let’s see, will he mention The 7D? You know, the show that won the “It’s Raining Taco’s” guy a daytime Emmy? Please say I’m not the only person who remembers that.  Edit: Guess it’s just me.
135th comment
That bionic thing was the coolest shit ever when you were a kid
18:21 fun fact: that was the same person who made fish hooks
One thing I’m never gonna forget is the fact that freaking Eric Andre appeared in an episode of Zeke and Luther.
0:31 Mark I need you to tell me, was this show original 4:3, or did you intentionally crop it/smush it to gaslight me. Seriously I'm losing my mind here and need to know the truth.
I'm in the band was easily the best Disney XD live action show.
Disney XD was childhood! I always go there to watch cartoons! Thanks for reminding me of it :)
Finally a video dedicated to Crash and Bernstein
I never watched it much besides watching wander over yonder and catching like 2 episodes of penn zero part time hero at my cousins' house
I'd totally be down for Randy Cunningham being revived on Disney+ or Hulu out of all these shows.
Oh my god I am so fucking happy someone remembers Crash and Bernstein.
Loved these shows
You just brough up so many childhood memories I supressed for good reason... My day is ruined
I forgot about disney XD lol
I haven't watched the video yet, but I swear if Doraemon isn't here, I riot.
XD was such a strange thing to use to seem edgy
Me and Booboo we’re gonna get our own Disney XD show! And then we were arrested as corporate spies for Warner Bros!
A majority of this video is already just me saying what the hell are these shows as I had no idea they existed
no the LS stands for life support
ive recently rewatched Randy Cunningham it was unexpected  to see him pop up on my home page
Remember Jetix?   Childhood.
I used to love all of these shows. Pair of kings used to be my favourite, but I remember hating the third season
I am the stone that the builder e refused i am the isual
Crash and Bernstein was such a great part of my childhood!!!
LEAVING A DISLIKE FOR THE SCAM ADVERT. DO NOT TRUST THOSE SCUMBAGS. THEY ARE LITERALLY A SCAM. I WISH YOU'D DO YOUR RESEARCH NEXT TIME MARK BECAUSE YOU'RE SUPPORTING A FALSE THING. i had to caps lock so hopefully people can see this and not believe the crap they lie about.🙄🙄🙄🙄 leaving bright emojis for more attention as well. please do better next time mark
Lab rats its where is at
Disney movie
When i was a kid i watched Disney XD a Lot more that Disney Chanel cause i only care about the Cartoon and at least here in Brazil 90% of the shows was cartoons
Disney XD shows were odd but I love them cuz they were odd
LS Mark you lie. Crash and Bernstein are not on Disney plus in the UK
I remember every program that aired on Disney WTF
Forgotten Disney Xd shows definitely feel like an oxymoron in a way .
they thought they can be hip with the kids by using slang like XD
Disney ROFL
Walk the prank was my jam back in the day ngl
I fucking love kick buttowski. Best show they had to offer at the time in my opinion.
where the frick is the hidden family guy dog brian in the thumbnail? You better hope I'm just blind LS Mark or there will be consequences.
Wow
Ah man, i remember watching all of these shows as a kid  ...but i must say, seeing arrows pointing in some actors saying "arrested" was like getting slapped by a frozen fish
Is it depressing that I know and watched all of these shows? 😢
In 2020 me and my friends rediscovered randy Cunningham on Disney+ so we watched all of it over discord and we still use the fake slang from the show with each other today like “what the juice” “shoob” “Bruce” “the cheese” “wonk” and much much more
You should rank every episode of King of the Hill
hell yeah crash and bernstein was awesome
Fun fact did you know there is actually a pseudo-sequel to Jessie called Bunk’d it didn’t fall Oh Jesse but I did follow the kids she babysat going to camp
If Randy Cunningham get revival,it might not be the same as back then. People will compare the series with Miraculos Ladybug.
You're the first person I've seen reference anything related to Crash and Bernstein in nearly a decade
In Eastern Europe Disney XD was just Disney channel. All their shows were on the Disney channel
Pickle and Peanut still solos ever other Disney show
i liked labrats, but funny thing was how long the name was in polish. Such a mouthfull, also try to pronouce it:  "Szczury laboratoryjne" - lab rats
The S stands for Sponsor; Lord Sponsor Mark
Any Randy Cunningham friends there is petition for season 3
Anyone remember that weird show of Disney trying to appease to games Parker Plays?
All these shows were my childhood
man, I remember every one of these
Disney XD was amazing
hello mark
Every time they moved a Disney Channel cartoon onto Disney XD, it would just get cancelled after about 2 or 3 seasons.  Disney XD is basically the Disney counterpart to Nicktoons.
mangosteen
I absolutely loved randy chunningham but the other shows like crash and burnstine is mid! Like with the other shows Oh and I forgot all about how much I binged kick buttowski!
i remember having a insane crush on bertram
The difference between DisneyXD and Nicktoons is that Disney doesn't treat DisneyXD as a dumping ground for shows in the hopes of justifying their cancelations.
I only watched this channel for Phineus and Ferb, Gravity Falls and Pokémon (I still don’t know why Pokémon was on there to this day)
You know that Disney YouTube thing sucked because ls mark wasn’t there
Disney XD was my early teens phase. That and edgier anime.
Jokes on you i actually did watch these shows while they were showiny
Bro I was  literally just thinking about old shows on Disney XD and I got this notification 💀
RIP Cameron Boyce! 😭😭😭
I could tell Randy Cunningham is the reason why they picked Ben as Sonic for the movie. And since Randy Cunningham was the first series that introduce me of Ben Schwartz,i couldn't think of Randy talking.
Hope I’m not the only one who remembered Crash & Bernstein
i bet wonder over yonder is going to be here, litteraly no one talks about it
Disney XD is so hip and cool!1!1!
You forgot Boyster 🥲💔
I genuinely had no idea what the XD stood for as a kid! XD
seeing that goddamn puppet in the thumbnail gave me war flashbacks
Ohai mark
woah
this is cool
Happy that Lab Rats isn’t considered forgotten
RIP jetx  Gonne to soon
What about Sonic Underground, Mark?
Anyone remember Wander Over Yonder?
Remember Yin Yang Yo or Power Rangers before Disney XD? Also Kick Buttowski
Man I love Disney XD
Can't wait for Disney XD to buy out marks sonic gameplay
I remember Crash and Bernstein! I was a huge fan of the 2011 Muppets movie when I was younger and when I saw that on XD I was hooked. Unfortunately looking back it was not as good as I remember, but at least it led to me becoming the huge Muppet fan I am today!  Also what happened to Brian in the thumbnails?
Need me some radical and epic children’s programming on god
Let's be all honest, Disney XD was pretty much a forgotten channel to begin with The channel didn't have that many memorable shows like the regular Disney channel and has been pretty much been swept under the rug until this video
Man, as a kid growing up during the early-mid 2010s, Disney XD used to hype me up so much.
Just the thumbnail reopened my childhood
The joke at the beginning 💀
Crash and Bernstein felt like a fever dream
Disney XD has the best Disney shows  And some of the worst.
Wow im early!
First!
I actually liked Crash and bernstein. Interesting concept that could be executed better
even if it's not a part of the video... Please mention Mech X4, Please mention Mech X4, Please mention Mech X4
All they had to do was put XD in the name and 9 year old me was in, didnt even know what XD meant...
