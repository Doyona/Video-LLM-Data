Some players are holding 🏀 and running
funny vines
4:12 AHHHHHHHHHHHH‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
tsm
No
That 2 hand layup is the second version Of the MJ on
wu tang clan
Beginning of minute 4: my favorite move of the game.
Please watch my live stream Boyce Avenue Greatest Hits https://youtu.be/P2hKLfd9J9c

Go LeBron
Great video. Thanks so much for sharing. All the best. Survive & Thrive. David
Every one else whos watchin like:😲😡  Me whos watching this for distance learning and doesnt know squat about basketball:  \✏_👁👄👁_📖/
That Boy Murray Shifty lay up was so Saucy sheesh 🤧 🔥 📛 👨‍🚒
Refs ruined it. Game 5 was hard to watch. They literally gave jokic three personal fouls out the jump and you could tell it was calculated 🤦‍♂️
, .ikb b;/m
lonely island
came back here to read comments on how "the nuggets put the lakers where they want them to be" "comeback kids will win the series" "nuggets in 7" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 🤣
Congrats Lakers.
Bts showdown haha
Who cares
Let's go lakers
where is the 3-1 comeback?
Jamal Murray is a walking bucket wtf
Who's here after Lakers beat the Nuggets in game 5!?
Lebron is the GOAT!!  CLUTCH!!
THiS GAME' s OVER, L.A's Going TO THE FiNAL's.
Lakers have paid NBA to win this year . Umpires taking nikola and Jamal out of game with fouls . This is cheating
Covid 19 Championship no one cares the season is write off Period. No one going respect 2020 championship sorry Lakers.  Basketball needs fans because home court advantage is so important . And those teams that where top seeds played so hard for home court advantage and that went out the window with no fans.  Cancel season its All BS bull BS bull trash 🤔🤧🥱🙃🤯
Crown 👑 the Lakers bron gets a triple double shit is over ...y’all bandwagon nuggets fan we can get y’all for 99.cents at burger 🍔 king lol.. y’all will do anything to hate on greatness
Mr Malone pls out   porter Jr because he don't have a defense if you want to win
Why the best quality has to be only 720p!
Jamal Murray ain't noting to fuck with
AWSOME
Goddamn carusso always carrying LeBron and AD
Any team with lebron james is not worth watching.
Nobody noticed JR smith was out this whole time thats how solid of a team the lakers are. I can only imagine what there going to do now. The whole great thing bout it is that everyone playing great its not only a lebron and AD show like people thought it was going to be
Refs bullshit 35 free throws you had a whole quarter worth of points in free throws just rigging the game
Can someone explain how the nuggets aren’t a tier one team in 2k? Literally would bust a nut for a nugget update on stats
Win or go home for nuggets but even if they lose everyone should respect what they've done in this playoff bubble to get to this point!! No team has comeback from a 3-1 deficit twice and this young squad with Murray leading the charge is going to have a bright future and if they get Bol Bol going down low which they should be doing against this tall lanky Lakers team they will be even better which is scary because they are this good without having size!! I don't understand how coach Malone won't use Bol Bol in this series 7'2" with a 7'9" wingspan I mean wtf and the kid can shoot its really stupid i mean if u wanna win u need more size its not brain surgery get him in this damn game tonight plus u need more rebounds for the love of god and why is no one  else saying this either?
Murray......he doesn't have the reputation yet but the league knows he's am MVP
I wonder why james is mad the entire game
Someone on Nuggets makes bucket when someone on Lakers is supposed to be guarding them- Lebron *throws up hands and cries* someone on Nuggets makes bucket over Lebron- LeBron *looks around trying to find someone else to blame*
Whoever wins game 5 wins the series
This should be fun 🍿Lakers in game 5 we ain't the slippers!
Rondo out there eating
Hello Team Lakers and Coach Frank Vogel! How is everybody doing? Hi Coaches! Here is a summary of an article i've just read two days ago about offensive strategies that i recommend Team Lakers acknowledges about  this whole excerpt. It starts with: Basic Offensive Plays for Youth Basketball Coaches.  In Youth basketball,  most productive offensive plays are characterized by continuous passing and simple movement. Motion or continuity offenses will contain passes,  cuts and screens in either a free flowing system that enables your players to make reads and decisions,  within some basic rules or in a fixed pattern that will lead back to starting formation to be repeated.   Motion offenses are great for youth basketball because they allow every player to handle the ball, make decisions and have scoring opportunities that will help their development .  They also won't confine players to specific positions based on their size,  so young players will have a chance to work on many different skills and gain experiences at different spots throughout a game.  There are motion-based offenses that can be run against both man-to-man and zone defenses,  and these basic sets can be effective for your youth team.  Here are five formations that i would like to acquaint Team Lakers with   the formats. But then,  i am hesitant that my instruction is not that very clear and informative to guide our team to the next Basketball Season in an unrelenting circumstance of my mannerly personality. So i would like to let Coach Frank Vogel handles this situation for all of us. Thank you!   Offenses vs. Man-to-Man Defense  The first one is Basic Motion. The second one is Flex. The third one is 5 Out. The fourth one is 4 Out. Offense vs. Zone Defense,  and it is also the fifth one and that is to say the least High-Low. Good wishes given to someone who has tried tremendously hard with upkeep for this pre-champ victory. Thank you very much!
Danny green jersey say how many more 😂😂😭😭
Mr.need more foul to win and goat wanna be.
What happened to dion waiters?
38 days till biden and his racist supporters get late term aborted
It's over.... For the lakers. Nuggets down 3-1 again eh?
You could say Dwight put his ass to work 💀
There is no such thing as "FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS."
*Lakers wins game 4 and is now up 3-1 Nuggets: So you chose death
The truth that Lakers have a talented coach and having a best players with working chemistry.  All this factors have made Lakers to make it in the Championship games.
LIVINGROOM HAHA
On the table
Proud of our Nuggets here in Colorado. They've come so far.
LA  Lakers
4:05 Air Murray!!!
Lakers! #Lebron #Anthony Davis
Go CLIPPERS!
Murray's giving me aomine vibes tf
Murray is very tired of this game.he tried to make it any shot and assist every single minutes.but he did make it to win to tie the game.but I still very proud of you..idol...and jovic.
Rondo gets the pick of the century from the joker 3:22 😂🤦🏾‍♂️
4:02 what a basket????????
Hmmmm, just curious...  but was it me or the whistle didn’t blow on some of the seemingly foul by lakers?  My confusion was best expressed by Murray’s reaction in one of that events.  (Didn’t believe it but now I’m starting to think NBA want matches to prolong so the full 7 game can be played as much as possible.)  Anyway, just a thought, but I think the nuggets could’ve win on this game.
Another thrilling game. But if the Lakers shall advance, they need to stop letting their opposition back into the contest. Say for instance, Miami clinches; then L.A. will have a harder time, containing Jimmy Butler, Jae Crowder, Bo Ambadayo, and Gordon Dragic. That's four caliber players on one squad. Denver has, at best, what, two? (With Jamal Murray & Nikola Jokic) Boston has more productive players in my opinion. So, all n' all, it'll get harder from there.
Den should pick up Yannis
I'm going for the lakers but this game was rigged I couldn't believe how many foul shots were made by the nugget players mainly Jamal murray.
Look at al the non calls for Denver, refs helped lakers for sure.. too bad this all set up anyway
This man Murray gots to be 98 overall like tf this some 2k shit
Dwight is just having fun,big weapon kinda reminds me of a humble but still gay Dennis Rodman lol.
Wow murray 4:06
3 - 1 again.  Murray Time
Allô tout le monde
Dwight is the best counter for Jokic, man imagine Jokic forcing his way in but a big wall is in front of him.
Ppl actually saying Lebron didn’t foul Murray on that drive? That’s why I’ll never cheer for a team he’s on even though I respect his greatness. Who calls the fucking league to cry? See all the soft calls he was getting. This is your King?
Denver will come back 3 - 3 series in 7game same like last time against clipper 7game
Clerics or heat, it would be like packs of dogs vs lions against lakers.
Jamal Murray and Kyrie Irving are the most talented scorers in the league.
Let's gooo!!!!!!! Ain't no stopping bron that's a grown ass man c'mon man
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yggbaJx1Ksc&t=1066s
If LBJ guards murray he will likely just stop driving on him and drill 3s or 15 ft jump shots in his face instead either way Bron aint stopping him!! Only person who can stop Murray is Murray!!! Let's go Nugs 3-1 triple comeback to make history that no team will ever be able to repeat!!!
Lakers are playing the pick an roll nice defensively. Switch the play coach. Denver and Boston should atleast push to game six hopefully
Why does Rondo look like Bronny Jr 🤔
LAL 3-1 DEN,  DEN was like: "Finally, I'm in a place I'm comfortable with....."
Game 7
this is a L for lakers. Lebron, AD, dwight howard and rondo. All of them getting destroyed by Murray. double/triple teaming not working on him
Lalaban pa yan
Nuggets are down 3-1 you know what's next...
I just noticed, Jokic and Murray is like Stockton and Malone but more passing and shooting
Watch out Lakers fans,these Nuggets relish for having their backs against the wall.They are most dangerous only when they face elimination.They come at you like a wounded animal or should I say like a wounded warriors.Ask the Jazz and Pat Beverly
For Kobe
Throught 4 games: Lakers 114 FT attempts Nuggets 114 FT attempts  Any excuses?
The only reason we lost game 3 is cause we slept on Dwight and benched him for McGee we had no rebounds or paint defense.. McGee is low key trash
4-1 Houston 4-1 nuggets 4-1 heat i think or Celtics
Sorry Denver Nuggets, the spot in the NBA finals has already been paid for.  Lebron and AD have pushed the BLM narrative enough to secure their spot. They can promote the BLM and thats fine but “after” the playoff. There were many police incidents prior to playoff.  You have to question the “timing” and their intentions. They are famous and can draw attention even after the playoff.  But just like any arrangement pay first before the ring Lebron knows this and he is playing it well! If he does not hold up the end of the bargain, expect another cramping in the finals (Finals 2014 against Spurs).
unreal shots by murray
Tuff to beat the Lakers and officials
Nuggets: 1-3 deficit? No hassle. Been there done that.
So I'd say the lakers in 6
Tbh I feel like the most the nuggets could get is one more win
Nobody:   Nuggets: down 3-1 again
How many offensive fouls is LeBron going to get away with??? Even the commentators are saying it like bro wtf.
In the 4th, Lebron got no ball and just moved murray in the air on one layup. and hit him on the wrist and hit no ball again on the other layup. you can see that the ball doesnt move at all, just straight up and down. so lebron didnt redirect it. he just hit the wrist causing the ball to not go very far. both clear fouls. at least with replay. the refs just helped lebron win lmao. nba should try just letting them play a fair game and see how that goes. might be more entertaining...
Boring. Guys still watch basketball. No thanks. Trump 2020
9:46 💀💀💀 lbj like you better not fuck up
That murray's lay up on lebron make him mad then blocked
Lebron is the only player  that would guard some way smaller than him to win. That's some pussy shit smh
Did this Nigga bron drop the 5😳😂😂😂
don't sleep on denver they playing with there back against the wall they knocked off 2 hall of famers in kawhi and pg 13  coming back from 3 to 1 so da lakers can't take the pedal of the gas
Butler and Herro finna fuc over the lakers😂
Let's go nuggets!
I’m a lakers fan, but dang Murray is sweet with it
Guess who’s down 31
This is exactly were the nuggets wan to be in the playoffs
Laker Fan In The House Says Great Game But I Love That Sweet Layup Move To The Basket By Jamal Murray Much Respect 2nd Quarter Of 2:35 minutes  💯
2:11 rondo faked going for a layup on porter jr... just like he did to lebron in the 2010 playoffs. but now its lebron getting the pass. still weird to see them on the same team
Can we all agree Coach Vogel is slow in changing the lineup.... Dwight should of started against Denver from the start...not slow ass McGee...
Welp Denver time again to roll up them sleeves and come back from a 3-1 deficit
gotta love james always complaining when his teammates get 3 pointed but when he does, it's good
👍Let close this deal on 4....go lakers👍
FOR THOS THAT JUST WATCH HIGHLIGHTS AND NOT THE WHOLE GAME! Dwight was the real star last night. His defense in the first half allowed lakers to pull ahead. Never seen him rebound that much. Also kudos for not punking jokic and guarding him like he should of been doing in game 3
That's was a foul on Murray
Dwight’s defense is a problem💯
Murray is a 2k park player 😂
Damn how can Lebron run without a spine?
You gotta give it to the Nuggets. This series could very easily be 2-2 if AD didn't knock down that game winner. Hell of a group they have in Denver
Dwight is angry on those boards, love to see it.
thanks to Stephen A. Smith calling him out on First Take the other day, Kyle Kuzma actually decided to make a much-needed cameo appearance in this game for once in this series. He needs to stay hungry and be that complementary scorer to AD and LBJ that he is supposed to be or they may decide he is not a vital component to the roster next season. Just my opinion. Also, Danny Green needs to step up and be more consistent going forward.
Playoff rondo 💯
Frank Vogel the other day: Frank: Hey refs Refs: Wassup Frank Frank: I see that Lebron and us Lakers not getting enough free throws Refs: they actually get more than they deserve and we don’t call offensive fouls on Bron when he charges in with the left shoulder  Frank: I see. -takes out $500- Refs: what is that for? Frank: this will be our little secret just make sure the Lakers get plenty of free throws and win game 4 😉 and I’ll give each of you $500 Refs: Aight Fosho Frank: Cool
man kuzma is a trash defender.. smh. liability
The L.A Lakers prevailed against the Denver Nuggets!!! LeBron James had a good day against the Denver Nuggets!!! One more win for the L.A Lakers and they're moving on to the NBA!!! I'm waiting for LeBron James to take on his former team the Miami Heat in the NBA finals so, he'll face off against Jimmy Butler in the NBA finals!!! Lakers and the Heat in the NBA finals!!! Let's go Lakers!!! I 🖤 L.A!!! Let's go LeBron James and Anthony Davis!!! How bout them L.A Lakers!!!
💜💛💜💛
Lakers + refs vs Beast Murry
Kcp can't miss from that corner 3
Who's better lebron or ad
7:24 Paul Millsap should be fired for not taking this shot.
Murray is the anti George paul
6:46 Porter clowns Kuz Part 2 lmfao
Starting line up. S. curry, Doncic, Murray's, greek freak, klay Thompson
6:39 lmao Porter makes Kuz look like a clown
Bro Murray is the biggest let down for the nuggets   If they stop playing him maybe the nuggets could win smh 🤦‍♂️
How many fouls are the refs not gonna call for the nuggets holy shit :D
Sucks, can’t finished the video
The real X Factors are KCP & Dwight Howard this series
I’m a lakers fan so I want them to win and the refs seems like they do too 🤣.
play 4:05 at 0.25 speed, thank me with a sub <3
Anyone else except these L.A. phonies period .
Fk the nba, fk the blm and mostly Fk the Woke, Black Lives MAGA
Lakers in 5
4:04 Murray makes a triple clutch move mid air for the layup, mans went right left right for the finish sheeeesh
You know AD is hurt. He rolled his ankle. I don't think he's okay. That's good news for the nuggets.
Lbj is a gd?
Murray is better than Steph..
love watching Rondo.  whether his positioning or his passing its always at the right spot.
I’ve seen enough Danny slander
i like how Jr smith is on top of full support to his team. gives energy to them
Man Murray did have a game but PLAYOFF RONDO IS A GOD
jr at the end💀
Maaaaan I would quit my job to go to game  5 !
Aye the nuggets are 3-1, you know what’s about to go down 😏
Lakers making me damn proud this year.
Oh no I’m scare if the nuggets gonna come back
Heat vs Lakers Finals!
nice Lakers  👊👍
Lakers in 5
Man KCP was MVP this game, clutch shots
Why is it that everytime the nuggets score lebron always complain damn🤣
Denver is a good team they came back from 3-1 twice already
Playoff Rondo has been my surprise this season let's go Lakers
I don’t see the Lakers beating Miami
Not going to lie I’m done watching the nba for the year. I’m not a nuggets fan but if the refs are going to give the season to the lakers why watch?
Weak ass shit so lame
Lakers
If you just watched the highlights, you would think that AD is the key player but what you don’t see is his laziness on defense and lack of rebounding. Not to mention when he doesn’t get back on defense because he’s too busy complaining about a foul call or thinks he has a season ending injury that he later walks off.
I see A lot of steve nash in murray with that one legged runner
We have the active best of all time blocks leader, the active second of all time steals leader, the active second and third assists leaders, the active points leader, and the active steals leader. On one team.   Say whatever you want about Steph or Kawhi or Durant, go ahead.
They better not pull a Clippers and choke the lead. Close them Nuggets out.
8:15 no cap, the best kinda of 3 to hit.
Yo 5 wins away, Kobe is watching..   Let's get it, #17💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛
If the Lakers lose, then viewer ratings for the Finals will drop significantly.  Without a doubt Lakers will win to keep viewerships up
personal fouls game 4 Nuggets 28 lakers 25 Game 3 Lakers 26 Nuggets 21 Game 2 Lakers 30 Nuggets 22 Game 1 Lakers 28 Nuggets 26 Total Lakers 104 Nuggets 97 Game 4 only game in the series nuggets had more personal fouls then Lakers but Lakers are cheating right?
Referee is terrible they are doing favor to lebronica, daviscy every time they touch the ball not fair
Dwight Howard was a monster laster. Period💪🏾
Letsss go lakers ..
4:06 - makes me proud to be Canadian.
I love seeing Rondo all "ok fine, I'll do it myself"
He's not Jewish but LeBron's Kippah is starting to show.
If Mason Plumlee goes down with a real bad injury, Bol Bol really should see some action.
9:30 AC & AD sync claps
Lakers up 3-1? Uh oh. RIP lakers.
6:41 step back.. When are refs gonna call that a travel.  Kuzma is killing the lakers with his play..
Series should be 2-2 is AD didn’t make that game winner, but the nuggets are a hell of a team
1:55 really bad travel followed by an extremely great pass
Wouldn't It Be Intresting To See Jimmy Butler Go Against LeBron
Nuggets gotta play hard,play mpj bol bol  more and put plumblee on davis for athleticism  more and jokic needs be more physical and they need hit freethrows and defense
Lakers please don't blow it. I feel like the Nuggets are scripting their playoff run.
La Lakers championship la
Free Hong Kong
Refs not calling obvious contact for the nuggets but calling foul if a player barely brushes a laker... this whole series is fixed so the lakers and LeFlop win the title...
I find watching basketball highlights nerve wrecking. So I fast forward to the final score, then to the beginning to enjoy the athleticism and artistry of the game.
yea wth i never knew Murray was this good, he carried denver to playoff, i thought porter was
Murray's passing is underrated
People after seeing another 3-1 series on a nuggets game  Ahh sht here we go again.
7:31 7:50 9:00 😑 these are just 3 LATE GAME BLATANTLY MISSED calls.   A shooting foul is when the defender alters the shooter’s shot illegally. Here are some things that would cause a shooting foul.  Hitting the shooter’s hand while he or she is in the shooting motion Hitting the shooter’s hand while he or she is in the follow through. OTHERWISE MAKING CONTACT WITH THE SHOOTER  WHILE HE OR SHE IS IN THE SHOOTING MOTION.
Lakers still calling out the officiating? Its been one sided again and guess what, Lakers up 3-1. 35-23 FT in favour of Lakers is embarrassing especially after seeing the kind of calls they make. Even Chuck called it out.
Kuz getting cooked like bacon 🥓 outcha 😂😂
Clipper fan boys where are u?
Nuggets Vs refs
Something is seriously going on with these paid refs
can someone please tell AD he's a big.. He's afraid to get hit
Lakers constantly getting bailed out by refs, the bias is blatantly obvious!!!
everybody saying murray this and that when he had a whopping zero field goals in the last 5 minutes with bron on him lmao. overrated just like that joke jokic
Another finals appearance bouta get added to the Kings resume!..
I think we can all say Kentucky puts out the best NBA players
Rondos should be the only person guarding him or put jr on him he too fuckin dangerous 💯
The only team I'm worried is the Miami Heat. They can beat the Lakers.
is Jamal Murray gonna say they should be up 3-1 too? haha
Lets go where up 3-1!!! *Gulp*
Dwight Howard in the First Five. Yeah. 😁😁😁
Murray...why you had to do that?
It’s over for the lakers
I’m a big bron fan but I hate when he holds the ball like for 15 seconds out of the 24 seconds🤦🏻‍♂️just move the ball and make them chase the ball
The Lakers now have a team that can compete for a championship they look very Dangerous
Uh oh it’s 3-1 again😨
Nuggets are done! Anyone need ketchup with that?
All of you saying or Murray this Murray that it’s only cuz he’s in Denver and nobody pays them attention even when they are right at there at the top tier west team. He’s been cooking for a while now y’all just now tuning in
The nba refs beat dnever ! Same shit ! Nba is a fake sports league it’s just as real as wwe etc
Funny how the commentators always cream their pants whenever Denver scores lmao
Anyone else think refs were favouring the lakers throughout the game
bro murry is so smart in driving
Hell of a game
Jamal Murray has become my new favorite player to watch some of the shots he makes are just ridiculous.
Anybody see lebron at the end drop da rakes 🤘🏽😤
Nuggets bros we have them right where we want them
Nba don't bully my ancestors from phils you racist
🏀🏀🏀
Nba don't bully my ancestor from china you racist
I don’t think I heard joker name once.  Damn
Where did Murray go after Bron started guarding him? 😂 Boy was ghost lol
I am not a nuggets fan but I clearly observed the refs giving the game away to the Lakers. I can't believe the Nuggets had 23 overall free throws attempts in the entire game while the Lakers LeBron James and Anthony Davis had a combined 28 free throw attempts in the game alone. Why didn't they complain when they were up 2-0 about foul calls then, but waited when they were at 2-1? It looks a little suspicious. It also comes as to no surprise finding out that the Lakers actually called the NBA office to complain about LeBron and Anthony Davis not getting enough foul calls in the playoffs. It makes people wonder if they even call prior to the beginning of the planning of the NBA schedule so that they can make it easier for them to get chemistry and accumulate wins like playing teams who are typically below .500 on back to backs and road games and be challenged here and there as an odometer to see where they stand, all while the league saves the tougher opponents towards the end of the season like the pattern has shown for many years except for when they were without Kobe or LeBron. As an NBA fan and we are being robbed and herded like cattle to a particular outcome because one team has more bandwagon fans than the other. It would be cool to have a powerball/lottery style schedule maker so that no team may have the advantage over the other and being able to influence their NBA Daddy.
Time to send the nuggets back to pothead mountains ⛰
Bubu Lakers bisag kusog ..galisod..😝😝😝😛😛😋😋😋😋
Lakers are lucky the Nuggets are out of gas after having come back 3-1 down in the previous 2 series....
is NBA didn't recognize the steping in inbound?..look at DAVIS inbound the ball..he pass the ball but his 1 leg is in inside  🤔
Man how many times is Dwight Howard going inbound the ball 10 feet past the inbound line  and not  get a call
Danny green was a BUM last night he need to start hitting his shot more cause he's giving the nuggets a chance to score.
Look at plumlee +/- and help me understand why Paul milsap is starting
Nuggets are down 3-1? It’ll be interesting to see them in the finals.
Can we talk about Murray? The man is fire yooo
Well, well, well, looks like the Lakers formal complaint to the League paid off!
Dwight howard keep balling brother we need It !  Lets go LA
Nuggets did good for having to play the Lakers and the reffs starting to say fuck the NBA
Yo you realize that since 2010 the Lakers have been in the finals so long ago man LETS GO LAKERS
LeBron is the goat not mj sorry.😁😁😁😁
Worst called series I have ever seen. These refs are terrible.
Nuggets need another Robert Kraft happy ending .  Go Nuggets !
Rondos pass fake broke Jamal Murray’s ankles 💯😂💪🏼 6:36
I want to see Lakers vs Miami former LeBron team🙄🙄🤔🤔😬😬
Js, they ain't even got got Bradley out there
Murray was incredible last night, despite the L
Where all of them nuggets fans lol 😂
Looks like that letter from the Lakers to the NBA paid off
here comes the 1-3 again for nuggets
Keep playing with your balls as your ratings crash.
Lakers had defended all their 3-1 lead in the playoffs while the nuggets always came back at 1-3. quite interesting
100% Lakers players pay the refs not even  nuggets fan but lakers have all these player and still having a hard time
They do NOT call fouls on the lakers
Can someone tell lebron to stop running down the clock and then forcing a pressured shot to one of the role players? I know he wants those assist stats but they're not helping
refs help Denver lose.
Murray is an absolute monster.
Need more minutes out of paul milsap
The nba referees are disgusting! Shame shame shame on these guys ruining big games! How much did LeBron pay these guys??👎👎🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
If Denver's manages another 3 1 comeback
as i have said before...watch how the refs will destroy the Nuggets the whole series...
Fuck it was Lakers ref....
Nuggets: makes a shot   Lebron:loses hair
Grant don’t play like that on 2k 💀💀
4:06 💪🔥
BRUH, LeBron holding down Murray in the 4th qtr at 35, when Kawhi and George were helpless against him, is just another entry in the chronicles of his greatness.
Seem like Lakers get's every call 🤔🤔
That was legit anger at 2:24 lol lebron chill
Lebrons reaction each time Denver scores. 🤮
Labron fouled Murray 👀🤦‍♂️2 57
playoff Rondo is real. yall better stop playing with this boy.
As a lakers fan I still want the clippers to win one more game, they have been over achieving in this playoff run and its fun to watch them play. Probably just me tho 😅
Jamal Murray sold his damn soul when tf was he this good
Murray something special to watch👀🔥💯
To the person who's reading this. Keep safe
nuggets did it on purpose they like it when its 3-1.
They better wear the mamba jerseys next game
Murray is the most underrated player in this playoffs no doubt.
That boy Jamal Murray is a straight bucket💯
3-1     Let the comeback commence
Saturdays game is gonna be SO 🔥🔥
I would sympathize with bad calls by the refs against the Nuggets but I’ve seen too many times throughout this series LeBron drive to the hole and get hit on the arm or head and because it doesn’t affect him like it would a normal-sized player, they don’t call it. Like nahhh bruh I don’t feel bad for the Nuggets not getting 1 or 2 foul calls late in the game
Imagine the nuggets coming back from a 3-1 lead again
Great Game on Both sides! Man the vets are shining for the LAKERS..  Very Talented All STar  VETS!!
Nba needs to ban Murrys shoes wow so bad.
JR smith really don’t play fr
Davis and James, not so much in the second half. Lakers win because of one guy...Rondo.
Kuzmo doesn't know how to play D
@6:40 that's a travel u shouldn't be able to get away with that.  Nobody plays hopscotch in basketball
Murray changing his mind in mid air.  "Im goona posterize lebron...... nahh I just gonna reverse it.
As a  lakers fan hats off to jamal Murray for  making those insane shots omg
3-1 lead. Damn nuggets really gonna win it in 7
Yo tht 4th quarter hit and lebron looked at the refs like “ok now do ur job, Lakers need to win”.
Lebron likes to cry eh?
Dwight Howard is so weird
Man in the crowd yelled white power @4:21.
Jamal just warming up for the next 3 games
Is Lame Bron auditioning for the WWE ? Breathe on him and he goes down with a flagrant foul called by the refs. The refs making sure Lakers get into the finals. This ain't  basketball!!!! I listen to Nelly' s ride with me during Lame Bron games cuz "It's all about the MONEY!!!" 🤣💵
Murry stock just went up
Lezz goo lakers
The best MVP king LeBron ♥️🥰♥️
Rondo is the general on the floor for the Lakers
GG On My Birthday 💯🎂🎉
The refs gave legroin what he wanted. Rigged game.
Denver:another comeback is happining
wERe nOt tHE cLIpPErs
Murray top 5 point after all these performances
Trade kuzma
“They have been in this situation twice.  We've been in the situation twice.  But both teams are familiar with these situations" - Anthony Davis  Let me lead to end this in game 5 -King LBJ 38pts  16reb  10ast 🤘
Commentators: The Lakers are up 3-1!  Lakers: Sh*t we're doomed
Imagine if Lebron, Ad and Murry on the same team.  Powerhouse
Hope our Lakers don't blow the lead like..... The Jazz and the LA Chockers.... Lol......
8
Well, they won't make this superteam for nothing. What do you expect?
Give credit to both teams. Lakers never collapsed when the Nuggets made a run, Nuggets never let the Lakers run too far. Just gritty basketball. I do love an underdog story but seeing playoff LeBron in true form at this stage in his career is amazing.
Murray got aim assist in basketball bro ong😂
cp3 s on fire hahaha
Let me just set the record straight about Kuz... While everyone keeps criticizing my boi... You guys must know that he only gets 7 shots per game!! Bron and Ad gets 20 shots or more every game... With that being said... KUZ NOT GONNA RESIGN WITH THE LAKERS 💯💯 everytime bron didn't play this year he did his thing... They got my boi cutting and playing a role out there WHEN HE CAN REALLY GET 20 OUT THERE EVERYNIGHT... SO KUZ IF YOU SEE THIS Don't RESIGN WITH LA. JUST WIN YOUR RING AND LEAVE #FREEGAME
It’s funny everyone’ is saying the ref are helping the lakers jus check the box scores Game 2 they basically had 20 extra free throws.. game 1 Denver had 9 more free throws same as game 3 ...too many excuses
Nuggets are over
Luckyass Lakers
Y'all in these comments bet not ever say LeBron a crybaby cuz y'all been crying about that little Block or Foul all night 😭😭😭😭🤣😂
NBA: The Nuggets are down 1-3   The Jazz and Clippers have left the Chat (bubble)...
The be fouling the Hell out of Jokic lol
Murray uncalled travelled at 1:54 (view at 0.25x, he got the ball and took 2 steps before dribbling)
Damn the nuggets are gonna go to the FINALS?!?
Hey guys check out this video https://youtu.be/OhiJa1N-gxo
NIGGA Lebron was fucking hacking
Iyak Murray. Hahahahah
AD can get touched and the refs will call a flagrant
Nuggets will come back. Just because Lakers has lebron dont mean shit . That niggas light will dim.
Nuggest would be lethal with another Shooter off the bench. I dont even think they need another star, but someone like Covington and Rose on that second unit with Porter would be sick
Lol the fakers should've lost now it's time Denver wins again.
Not gonna lie refs kinda fucked the nuggets at the end
This game pissed me off. The refs ruined it. Just let the guys play! Felt like the final 3min were nothing but free throws!
LBJ AND AD THE BEST SCORING MACHINE ...
Murray has been the most exciting player this whole playoffs. Dudes heart is Lion! Clippers could learn something from him
What is up with this old ass Lakers team looking like their prime selves? Lebron is Lebron even at 35. Rondo looking like the true top 3 pg when he was a Celtic. Dwight rebounding and boxing like he’s still on the magic. Even KCP hitting shots. I think Kobe putting some good JuJu on this team. Props to Denver they aren’t going without a fight. Murray is a bad man
Murray got so robbed lmfaoooo bro was fouled every damn possession
lakers in 5 we ain’t the clippers
We need Brons defensive highlights from this game! Notice how when Bron started guarding him we stopped seeing highlights from Murray.
What ever you say Lebron's defense is great no one can guard jamal at that time  No excuse ! Lakers deseve to win blaming refs is not an excuses haters is always a haters even there is no glass for coffee they will tell you i saw it #LeKingLeGoatLeLion = Lebron's IQ Skill and Power #RealMVP = LebronGetRobbed
The lakers are a prime example of why u should just stay in ur role
Uh oh, Denver has them right where they want'em now. But, Game 5 won't be played on a Thursday.  Chuck can't put a Guarantee on this one. Battle Royale, here we come!
Show me 1 play that Bron didnt get fouled on those FTs ? And Denver and Lakers has shot the same amount of FTs so shut up
Damn. I like to root for the underdogs, but I think this series is over. I do like the nugget’s prospects for next year. But LA v Miami will be lit!
Jeramy grant is trash # 9
Laker up 3-1  Everyone: Wait for it...
We all need a teammate like JR on the bench 💯
Ever noticed on your pursuit of Greatness and you show moments of imperfection, there will be those that will rally against you and wish for your defeat? F'em!  The series is now 3-1 BTW. Actions SPEAK LOUDER 🔊!
I hope Davis injury was not serious.🙏🏾
. . .murray with jordan move. . .
As of here today I’m witnessing the greatest come back of history Lakers not going I’m tryna tell you
I feel so  bad Murray he nice but no match for James
The refs every time the Nuggets almost tied the game... 😂 they really called everything for the lakers like 4 seconds after the shots went up  Anthony Davis actually deserves an Oscar for his performances last night tho
wonder if Kawhi regrets joining the sad sack clippers yet, teaming up with the playoff choker george, when if he teamed with AD he could win the next 3 champ. but no bellmer knows more than the Buss family about winning.
As a LeBron Fan, i truly am scared for what is to come with Denver next season. No Will Barton or BolBol Technically either! this team could be a dynasty sooner than we thought!
Y’all know what about to happen! 😂
Man they want Lakers to win so bad....damn refs
Would be nice to have player stats at the end of the video! Thanks for the highlights
Any takers on a $1000 bet this isn't going 7. 6 maybe. I got over a grand on my cashapp. What's up nuggets fans?
#NoDiscussions DG is only strong back to back champ. lol 😂
If the nuggets come back 3-1 again I’m turning gay
Nuggets rn: ahhh yes what a familiar sight
Lebron keep letting the haters know who is the best👑
lebron stepped up when it was needed but jamal is a superstar in the making
That block on Murray was revenge for that cheap ass elbow
Bruh just imagine heat and nuggets NBA FINALS ! I rather see that the most ! Both teams deserve
Please answer me ad is injured yes or no
It’s apparent to me that free throw attempt disparity is the likely cause for Lakers (+12 attempts) to win easily in this one. If this trend continues, I have more reasons to believe that the game is rigged that the refs fixed games. The next 3 games if the Nuggets can’t have a game that has 12 more attempts than the Lakers, I see that as a sign.
Kuzma and Danny Green are ass
Im Lakers fan but this dont mean the series is over cuz 3-1 so I'm scared
Nuggets got beaten by the Los Angeles Refs.
I'm tired of seeing danny brick's all season long he cant shoot 3s mid shorts lay ups etc... What the hell happen to him???
Clippers would say to the Lakers: 3-1 lead? Better be careful!
this whole game i'm reminded of what i've been saying all along:  "Reggie Miller really hates Lebron James.."  ..he's swaying casual fans with his commentary to hate on Lebron. i mean, why are we even listening to someone who didn't even WON A SINGLE RING?!?
3-1 nuggets is a different team
Rondo been nice... If it wasn't for them injuries tho lol... His IQ for the game crazy his vision
Murray is the future and I am glad he is getting this exposure but HE STILL GON LOSE FUK U TALKIN BOUT
Heart of a champions are always hard to beat... lakers are more experience in finals
Now the series begins nuggets in 7
mambamentality
Lakers better not blow 3-1 lead
Nuggets in the locker room: LETS GOOOOO WE DOWN 3-1 TIME TO CELEBRATE BOYS
Lebron really said cmhere lil boy at 5 mins in the 4th and locked murray up cuz dude was something special ln, mans a bucket
So much traveling #spaceship
Ok before this playoffs i have been sleepin on this Nuggets team
We know what happens now...
WHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT DENVER NEEDS TO WIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I like how Murray was killing it and then no more highlights after LBJ decided to give him the Rose Treatment in the 4th
Nothing wrong with being happy that we won but let’s stay humble and be ready for the next game we still haven’t done anything yet! #LakerNation 💛💜
When Are the Nuggets Gonna Get Those Late Game Rebounds Together 2 games in a Row yal took the Ls Because Nobody Is Hungry For The Boards Late.
Lakers vs Miami would be an interesting series if they both successfully proceed in the finals.
Damn dude both teams hitting some shots!! Pretty good game for both teams
Shannons prediction was right, a 6 point lead win for the lakers 👀
What's gonna hold true?: Lakers beating teams 4 -1 or the Denver Nuggets coming back from 3-1, my money is on the Lakers
Rondo a floor general indeed.
I feel bad for Denver. They are the underdogs that you root for and you see these calls and non calls taking out the momentum on this team. I’m just smh as I watch game 4 yesterday. GG though to both sides
Neither team is my city but damn did both teams play great, Lakers defence has been incredible, Murray out there looking like a future goat. It’s undeniable that the refs were favouring the lakers though, the blatant no call when James fouled Murray, to then trip and be rewarded 2 Fts. Sad ending to a great game.
The Lakers look nervous that they just took a 3-1 lead
3:40 wheres the foul ref?? Very obvious, REF FAVOURITISM.
Kobe better , fuck Lebum and the lakers
I was to sleepy to do anything so I missed the game so here I am now
This is bad for the Lakers.
Nuggets came back from down 3-1 twice. But the Lakers lost 1 game and won the rest of the series twice. Somethings gotta give.
4:04
🔥
It's so nice to see that dwight is now playing as a starting line up
3-1 lead, nuggets boutta do the same thing they did in the last 2 rounds
Kuzma missing in action
The refs be playin too much to keep the nuggets in the game
Nuggets almost got the comeback  but the refs are fishy in this game
uh oh lakers shouldve just throw this game away
When we taught they ganna make 3-1 comeback against jazz and clippers they didn't believe now lakers
Lakers aren’t the Clippers and LeBron hasn’t lost a series up 3-1 and hasnt lost a GM 7 since 2008. There’s no comeback for the Nuggets this time.
Nuggets... We got them right where we want them.. 😂😭
The prime Rondo is back
The Lakers went to the league crying about Lebron not gone to the free throw line and they put him on the every time he missed a shot inside. We all know Lebron  snit
Dang Davis really went hard
If the Nuggets had two players like Murray there wouldn't be no Lakers by now. Great job Murray !!
I want the nuggets to win so bad but i also want dwight to get his first ring 😭
I wish that the lakers would let  Quinn Cook play at least for 10 minutes
Lakers have this season tbh
Finally VOGEL had a brain fart & started Howard. Now swap ANYONE for Danny Green. He just doesn't have it this series. Start Rondo .........Green looks lost , nervous, no confidence . He doesnt have what it takes . Maybe come off the bench
AD needs to grab more boards.
Lefoul and the Refs does it again😂😂😂
Chicken nuggets taste good to the Lakers
lakers on top
Lavar ball : lakers will never win another ring —- okkkkkkkk they are on the way to win a ring without your son lonzo bust !!!
Good deal GOATJAMES & babyGoat AD
Lol kuzma used to have so much swag💯  He's just out there looking like he's just happy to be on the court now🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️  Maybe if they gave him actual minutes instead of danny green we'd get to see that kuzma that kept him a laker in the first place🤷🏿‍♂️
Jamal Murray is the Jamaican-Syrian-Canadian basketball superstar that we have all been waiting for!
All I’m saying is if Murray is a problem for Bron imagine what Jimmy is gonna do
Jamal Murray 🔥🔥🔥🔥🙅‍♂️🧢💯💯 but I'm a lebron and Davis fan
The west is weaker right now no GSW and Spurs dynasty to face. Leflop is smart he going to weaker conference and he has the superteam again lehelp cant win without switching trading recruiting to win the championship hahahaha lol
The ref stole that win from the nuggets, lakers had to call the ref to give Lebron more free throws 😂🤣😂🤣
Refs vs nuggets if you disagree you clearly didn’t watch the game
Dont forget caruso the goat
Without lbj ad rando and kuzma the lakers are 15th place
Good vid
Refs
I don’t know how y’all hate on lebron ! Boy put some defense on Murray in the last minutes . Did a block came back and got a lay up . GREATNESS
😲 Lakers will slam the door shut
That block of Lebroom on murray is underappreciated
5:29 the commentator sounds straight out of 2k
Everybody talking about Tyler herro instead of Murray this kid is a beast one of the best players right now if not the best.
Murray played like AI , great show, Rondo was playoff Rondo
So no foul calls for Jamal Murray but only for Lebron James when it really mattered in the 4th Q. Just a friendly reminder: you’re more of a goat 🐐 by fighting a stacked all star team and winning 4 playoff elimination games in a row. Without AD, Rondo, Howard and Greene, Lakers wouldn’t even have made it into the playoffs (like they didn’t last year). Stopped watching this rigged NBA from now on. Moving to NFL/NHL. This amazing nuggets team were robbed in game 1 by making their star players (only two of them: Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray) sit the entire first half of the game. If it wasn’t for that 3 by AD in game 2, the nuggets definitely came close to beating a stacked all star lakers team. Game 3 was also robbed from the nuggets by calling fouls for Lebron and giving him free throws and not for Jamal Murray. Denver nuggets deserve to be up 3-1. They ply with heart and passion but people only like stacked bully teams like lakers and their previous contenders: golden state warriors. Anyways, it’s basically Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray versus Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Rajon Rondo, Dwight Howard, Danny Greene and the refs. Basically a 2 vs 6. Much more respect for the nuggets who despite being bullied (2 vs 6) end up playing their best basketball and are usually only down 3-5 points. That’s fucking RESPECT right there. Forever your fan: Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray 🙏🏽🐐🙏🏽
Hey guyss! Can you please subscribe to our channel🙏🏼 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJJA9h9EatA5kag1hRGgduw
I gotta give it them nuggets I gotta give them boys they respext
Lebron and AD, knows how to put in their work. The denver deserves their respects though. I won't get cocky, because the series isn't over. Good luck denver fans.
Jamal Murray has made one of the most acrobatic layups of all time. This man is gonna be in the all star next season.
Dame rondos fake lob to AD twisted Murry!!! 👀
jamal murray: dribbles        lebron: AND THEN WE’RE GONNA CLAP EM
who did say that Pope is the third scorer in the Lakers team?
Should’ve let the Clippers make it in...
Anybody on the Lakers including Vogel can get cornrow but LeBron
Why Lebron seems so angry and frustrated everytime nuggets score. Just get back on defense and make a stop on the next possession. Body language says it all. He mad at his teammates. He ain't like that on the Blazers and Rockets series.
Welp it was a good run for the lakers
Murray wasn’t making no crazy shots like this in losses against the Clippers and Jazz. Lakers in 5.
Trash. These idiots don't know how to not turn the ball over. Should be a 3 to 1 series for Denver right now. Have no idea why they beat the clippers, I would havd enjoyed a lskers clippers match. Would have went 7 games.
Oh no, not this again
If the Lakers played like the Nuggets on offense they'd score 150 a game. Way too many jump shots when driving would make more sense. Oh yeah Danny Green is garbo Waiters should have his minutes
Too many calls in favor of lakers this refs are disgusting, whenever denver is on a comeback the refs are tryin to step on it.
Uh oh, Denver’s down 3-1. You know what happens next.😳
3-1 lead lakers.   Denver: activate 4-3 resilience mode!
Lakers us my fav team. But after watching nuggets play specially Murray. I feel for them. They have such a young team but they are fighting hard. Like really hard. I want Lakers to win the championship. But also didn't want nuggets to loose. Can't we have 2 winners😅
Game was rigged , no fouls called for Nuggets , sad but just because they’re the “Lakers” they get every BS call
Man oh DG is a disappointment in his starting role. Better if they start JR than DG is playing awful basketball and is way past his prime.
Who else thought grant got blocked on that dunk he got in
Man I’ve always hated on KCP but he’s been playing great every game this series.
Weird how Lakers win the game where refs didn't call dozens of fouls
Denver down 3-1  Where have we seen this before?🤔
Do NOT allow junior Kuzman to play in the playoff until he makes 70% jumper shots.
Lebron block on Murray was personal. It was payback for that elbow young blood.
Wanna see an Evil Lebron james? Watch game 5..
DEN needs to get Gary Harris more involved
JM is like MJ with his nifty moves.
I wil not be surprised if the nuggets beat the lakers on 3-1 standings.. just saying.
Murray is playing insane. I didn't think he'd be this good. Gonna be a superstar, already on his way. Easily the most fun player to watch on the court. Deserved to win game 2. Only thing he's gotta do is not worry about the calls by the referee until there is a break and continue to run back on defence regardless, because had he ran back to cover Rondo after Bron fouled him, they might have gotten a stop and the score still would have been 105-102
inbound pass Rondo is underrated
If lakers play with energy and fast paced then game 5 is there’s
Yall give rondo too much praise he playing with lebron and ad he can not lead a team or control anything this man left celtics and mavs literally crying  lol
Awful def by Kuz almost cost the lakers🤦‍♂️
People don't know this but rondo is a better PG than lebron.
Now the nuggets have a chance to win since they're down 3 to 1 again
Up e oy
Murray is nxt MJ if he stays healthy & keeps pulling those kind of moves
Rondo gave Kobe and LeBron fits when he was in green. Because of his ability to control to pace/tempo of the game
It's clear the Lakers make sure to limit the second-chance points and hand-cuff Murray in the final minutes of the game by LBJ. Murray does not have a point against LBJ with 5 minutes in the game.
Hep hep MURRAY
Bronsexuals & Laker Fans are everywhere. I know Lakers gonna cakewalk to the championship, and Adam Silver will make sure of that, but I want heat to win just to see laker fans make excuses. Shits gonna be hella hilarious.
If the nuggets would have won this game Lakers in 6, but now the plot thickens
Boys, there in position, now just let the basketball gods do the rest.
They said Lebron don’t play defense.... whole 4th quarter locked down Murray
I’m really not impressed with Danny Green’s, or Kyle Kuzma’s defense in this game bruh they gotta do better.
Will Lebron James stop playing for protesting..... he should but he is in the playoffs he don't want to mess up his opportunity because he want that ring..... Sad...  Wake up!!!!
Rondo still got playoff game, he got every1 involved in the game,every1 scored the ball and played good D but I think this series is over it don't think the nuggets can come back again no way eather 4 " 1 or maybe 4-2 but denver it's done already game 2 was the key for them but hey not every1 is perfect any error can end everything.
playoff Rondo or playoff LebWrong i mean Lebron?
Can we talk about @8:57
Anyone else who sees it. Rondo is playing amazing. But he doesn't like LBJ. I don't know why or what. I see him constantly trying to diminish LBJ. Like passing the ball out even instead of laying it up on a fast break, even when he is right under the basket by himself. Because that pass would've gotten LBJ the triple dub. Always making sure not to pass to LBJ for an easy highlight dunks.  Sometimes, purposely making a lob harder to handle. Of all players, you can't tell me that Rondo can't throw a perfect pass... So I know those are on purpose.  I've been noticing that for some time now. Armchair psychology.  Interesting to me.
Pero miami parin papasok ng finals...!!!👊👊👊👊
Oh! Miami tlaga acu pero matic boston mananalo bukas.. Nangangapa kc c blank!!! Hehehe,
Lebron always fouling refs never call it but when he get fouled they have 2020 vision
Im done with basketball until LeBron retires. They crowned him before he even did shit. Any basketball historian knows this is the SOFTEST era in modern basketball history and they still make exceptions and excuses for him. You cant hand check him but he can bowl fools over and get the call. This fool has played with more star players than Robert Horry with less rings and more years played! No more comparisons to MJ! This is competitive sports not a popularity contest. ATP his comp is Wade and Steph because they all have 3 rings. As far as I can see he is still behind Shaq, Duncan, Kobe before you can even mention MJ.
Tell me why AD had to fake being hurt twice like the little B*^#+ he is and lebron was crying to the refs while Denver wasn’t getting any calls in the 4th 😂😂😂
3-1 curse or 1-3 curse?
Lakers taking it 🍾
LeBRON's effort on D against Murray in late games is just brutal..He also got away with a couple of fouls Let's Go Lakers
I love how everyone is like" murray is so good" when nugget win and when they lose they are like"lebron is the best murray suck"
Even without the win the nuggets are impressive. Murray is almost unstoppable.
Jamal Murray is a MONSTER !!
The Nuggets need to put in Bol Bol.
The lakers are screwed now...they’re up 3-1 to the nuggets in the playoffs
LeGoat 💯
It's okay the nuggets planned to be down 3-1 and then come back to whop they ass
No lie I fell asleep at halftime 😂
Nuggets: it's now 3-1 hehe, get ready to go home Lakers  Lakers: (Wears Mamba jersey) Well, let's see...
Tf up with rondos hair tho..lookin like he trying to start a team for suicide squad 2
Dwight is a freaking monster with that dunk. And I’m glad they’re running more plays for kuzma
Ok so now  we know who’s winning now
6:39 double stepback🤯
Murray ain't so good when Lebron James on his ass..
Lets see if the 3:1 bug is already fix 😁
Anyone else notice Jokic is a complete non-factor? Gotta love Rondo at QB, and when AD plays well theres nobody can keep up with the Lakers
You gotta give prob to Dwight Howard. He sucks out the energy of jokic.
100% clear foul ..picture perfect. 😂 . . Big help from the referee .. too obvious ..LeBron's hand touch in Murray's wrist.
Bron has no excuse not to get it this year.
Where's bat dad when you need him
Denver down 1-3 "Ah shit here go again"
LEGOAT
*Lakers wins game 4 and is now up 3-1 . . . Nuggets: So you chose death
Now, game 5 will be the most interesting game in this series.. There will be dogs war for sure..
Why are most of the NBA players whining after every ref call. I mean these guys are supposedly be role models, they are talking a lot about accountability and justice, but when is time to show their own attitude facing the rules they act like the opposite. Man, I am all in favor of the BLM movement, but I feel like the NBA players culture have to change as well. In  international basketball you have to rise your hand after you make a foul. You have to accept what you did. Impose that to the NBA please, I don’t want to see the face of the players complaining after every single call anymore!
Stockton to Malone reborn  - Murry to Jokic
Idc what nobody saves AD is favorite for big man of the year let’s argue.
F dis series go to 3-2.. Nuggets in 7..
Boy the NBA suck I didn't care for either one of the team's but for a longtime I didn't respect L.J game  but now I know why   because the guys that he play's against are just pussy   but just not them the entire  NBA has gone pussy  bust your ass coming down the middle line you think twice next time      you know when old school players from another team hung out together when they fucking  retired  stop all this weak shit.   P.S. where is Jason Terry when you need them Denver lol
6:01 wasn’t that a travel??? And Lebron pickin up Murray in the 4th is what superstars do!!
WHAT THE FUCK was THAT MOVE MURRAY!! LAWD HAVE MERCY!🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯🔥🔥.  I've watched this shit a 20 time's already,  lol🔥🔥
Let's go lakers
The Lakers going up 3-1 against the Nuggets will be the death of them yet lol
Who knew writing a letter to the NBA complaining about would give Every Star on the Lakers 15+ free throw each. The 2nd half was full of BS calls against the Nuggets. These Highlights are going to show how the game really went. No one in the NBA wants to really see Denver in the finals when Lebron is still an active player... All about the ratings...
Jamal that was one of the nastiest fake dunk into a layup moments I’ve ever seen and on Lebron James in the playoffs...😳
HOWARD should have Been Started over McGee🤦🏾‍♂️, Double Double every time he starts
Dang Murray has a brighter future. This battle with lakers just proves it.
1:43 was that inbound good or nah?
Javale McGee is the guy on the team who does nothing but show boats when they win
I wonder how many games den gone win looking like a sweep
Nuggets got a crazy squad, IMO they got the better squad only reason lakers won is those rebounds Murray was outplaying everyone. mpjr could’ve been more aggressive. Ad was on fire but he gon choke against warriors next year
I didn't get any foul shots== Lebron Next game 14 foul shots==LeBron's upset give him what he wants!! NBA==Sellouts
Why did the Lakers win? Lakers are done
Bias announcer
Which one will continue to happen? Denver overcoming 1-3 or Lakers securing 4-1? Comment for Lakers Like for Nuggets.
If the Lakers had Klay Thompson 😤🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
Dang my boy JR will be getting a new ring :)
Lakers All Day 🔥🔥
Lebron is the KING of NO DEFENSE.. always act like he is chellenging all tje shots in front of him.. He cannnot even challenge the layups.. TRADE Lebron 😂🤦‍♂️🤔
Lakers defense sucks!
Nuggets should tweak their style in some last few minutes of fourth quarter...like letting someone else lead or direct the ball instead of Murray...
How the Lakers won but this is mostly Nuggets highlights
Wow murry..... That man a beast
Murray did no taunting this game and no trash talking afterwards.
Lakers lead 3 to 1 against nuggets we almost close to win get in NBA finals go lakers
LeBron babied by the official tonight
AD going down as the best 5!
4:14 dwight a bully bro, straight bbq chicken
So the Lakers realize that their going to have to eat some senzu beans or something if they plan on finishing off the Nuggets because as we already know the Nuggets are the come back kings
Herro and D rob gon get picked on every play. Bron calling for the switch every play. Joker and J Mal and better offensively then Bam and Butler. I woulda rather seen Celtics vs Lakers idk how they loose to the heat 🤦🏾‍♂️
Lebron shot 38% from the field.....yeah these goat convos can stop now. It aint him
Rondo look like he’s wearing a wig 🤣
The last 5 mins of 4th Qtr seems like it gets personal on King James.
Please shoutout to my one and only love Patricia Gaylle Mendoza, thanks.
LeBron is getting rusty man. 7/18 FG, can't pull it off from 3pt line and perimeter shots. Could've been a blowout victory but anyhow, a win is still a win. Let's go Lakers
The defense of LeBron on Murray at the end tho.
Evrytime the lakers win people blame the refs gotta love it lakers in 5 I’m ready for heat vs lakers finals
Bro green and kuz is killing us
This what bron been looking for. A support cast  to help him out in big moments at big times where he doesn’t gotta have every single possession fall on his shoulders. If they all stay healthy and get another 3rd option semi-star for some picks and role players... I could see this team making many many runs🔥👀
If Nuggets will win game 5 to 7... that was epic...   to survive 3-1 deficit 2 times is very impossible...  but again, I am a gsw fan
So danny green hit all them 3's for san Antonio in Toronto Get back with Bron his ass under the spotlight can't hit shyt
no foul calls on la shit rigged for kobe just cause he died sad
JR got easy ring by doing cheer up😂
To the person who's reading this, I pray you will become a successful person someday..
No player ALMOST in their late 30’s can win a chip alone lol . Get off Lebrons case
Rondo dropping dimes like 69 😭
DEN won 3, 3-1 lead. Den in 7.
If Lebron checks Jamal from tip off the lakers win easily
Now we know why he’s called King James.
Great series .... Rondo has been HUGE
Man rondo is something else
i miss the Young Prime Rondo, a legit non stat pad walking triple double. How time flies.
4:03 is the sweetest scope shot.. salute to murray
Even if lakers win this series nuggets shouldn't feel bad one bit they over exceeded expectations by a mile and is even more respected as a team then ever before, they've always been a good team but now they'll be looked at as a great team 😎👌🏿
Denver Nuggets will make another history and came back from 3-1 deficit for the 3rd straight time.
NBA watering down their own game with all these side agendas. Just emphasizes how insignificant basketball is & gets ppl hyped up about everything but basketball.
I felt like I've seen this situation before.....
Lakeshowwwww
Lebron could literally get hit on the arm by 3 different nuggets players and won’t get a call.
down to 3-1....this is in favor of Nuggets😆
LBJ gurading murray is amazing
Good game Nuggets
rip to the lakers they just put the nuggets down 3-1
lebum fouled murray and wasnt called -not so rigged nba
Not even a nuggets fan.. but I just feel bad for Nuggets.. these Refs straight away giving the game to Lakers .. this is unfair man..!
3-1 down in the series same story, G7 NUGGETS
Rondo 🔥
Is nobody going to talk about how rigged this game was? The calls were absolutely terrible. So many fouls that should have sent denver to the line werent called and the lakers kept going to the line for no calls.
I’m a laker fan. Playoff Rondo is my boy. AD is really showing up. Lebron is Lebron.  But I gotta give it up for Jamal Murray. I mean god damn...
Lebron fouled the ish out of Murray when the score was 105-102 (CHEATING) It must of been about 7 or more NO CALLS. That's fked up.
3-1 is where the game finally begins
King rando
https://youtu.be/ph-yM3QxC2Q  Exposed...Must WATCH 🔥
If only Danny Green could hit open 3's like he's supposed to, Lakers would probably be undefeated right now..
They robbed the Nuggets of Game 4. Too many unnecessary fouls giving to James and the Lakers. And when the Nuggets challenged 2 clear fouls and that out of bound on Rondo they still gave it to the lakers.  Literally 10 fouls gave them the game. Even with this clear one sided game the Nuggets still managed to be 1pt behind the Lakers in the half of the 4th. Even then the game was given to the Lakers, clearly due to all the fouls.
Fake audience
4:02 I know they lost but damn this move by murray is crazy. reminded me of that jordan play in 91
Murray got all my respect that guy be hooping but Lakers need to gone head and end it
Nuggets in 7
Denver is a lil gritty ass team
LeBron needs to stick Murray the whole game he shut him down late in the forth
Game 5 will be like a game 7 finals. LAL that never lose a 3-1 lead vs DEN who can comeback after down 1-3
If AD won't play in 5 the nuggets have the chance to repeat 3-1 deficit to win the game in the series
Refs really tried hard for denver to win.
Did JM just go MJ on that play with the hand switch sheesh ✈️
Mpj cooked Kuz tho
Grown men getting paid to talk about an play a game an you say there is no god Haaaa!!!
Nuggets vs Refs 4-1 😂
I think the sports announcer was bustin nuts on himself everytime Murray!!!!!   Got the ball?
Hey jokit 3 seconds in the paint
Let the Denver take the upcoming series if Lakers continue to play trash like these. Its not fun that you felt admiration from the other side of the team that deserves the credit.
Murray was going off in the 4th quarter, until Lebron stepped up to the plate and guarded him like a Brick Wall. Murray couldn't do a damn thing.   This takes me back to 2011 when Derrick Rose was the mvp, and Lebron guarded him in the 4th quarter.  He put the clamps on him. He did the same to Tony Parker in 2013. These are classic moments when Lebron was a 1st team all defense and could guard positions 1 thru 5.
Lebron stepped up big on D and didn't let his off shooting deter him. Props.

Dwight Howard was back in Orlando in that 1st quarter. #SavageMode
Murray has definitely put the league on notice 😳 👏
Nugg3-1s activated
Men no calls on the refs for denver.
Rondo the most overhyped player in NBA history putting up basic ass numbers, doing what he's supposed to do, while being praised like he's Chris Paul. Stop it already.
Nugs fans claim every loss is the refs fault. No mention of rebounds or Jokic’ scoreless 4th. Last yr the refs cheated for Portland too. CJ McCollum didn’t light em up in game 7. 😂😂
James always feel depressing
Denver didn't get any foul calls in the 3rd quarter, this series is gonna get rigged.
This is not a convincing win for the lakers. Even Denver gets unfair calls they deserve also to be champs.They r not whining for unfair calls but they continue to play with there heart.

Jamal Murray is a biggest losser
Rondoo?
Absolutely can not get complacent with this Denver team. They.....just....keep...coming at you non stop. Boys can’t take their foot of the gas in game 5. One more W.
Dang Howard is still a allstar player to me dawg out here catching bodies tho😳
The Lakers have fallen right into the Nuggets trap.
The Lakers are playing inspired basketball...lets do it for kobe
Shout out idol
For all you Laker fans that couldn't grasp why we kept Rondo... You're welcome.
Nuggets in 7? Its 3-1😂
Don't think Denver would have gotten this far without Murray, The Nuggets will get "cooked" in game 5( maybe)
Nice ref Laker now up 3-1
Now the pressure is on Lakers, knowing that this Nuggets came back from 3-1 twice to win the series...still I'll go for the Lakers. Much respect to the Denver Nuggets!!!
Until this season I never really paid attention to Murray. Didn’t know he was gonna be this good. Ik the Knicks are kicking themselves in the head for yet again letting another great player pass through their organization 🤦🏾‍♂️
Maayo unta in ana ta katag as no
Ad is a good scorer, but he's so soft, guard got more rebounds than ad. He should work on the inside game. He cant guard joker, few bumps from joker thats it. Easy 2 points. Hes relying too much on his out side shots
Lakers proving the true champion..
He said ad the best offensive player on the floor 👀👀 yeah after Lebron
Lakers 3-1 lead not safe with the Nuggets... we've seen it happen twice this playoff time :)
Miami vs lakers hits likee
Say whatever but Murray is a beast. GG to both team
No game 7 nuggets is lacking good players.
Boston punching air and wishing they still have Rondo
Mom oh man if the Lakers pull a Clippers and blow a 3-1 lead, Lebron better retire because he will never hear the end of it! But I only wrote this comment to make the salty Nuggets fans feel better because we know that’s never going to happen! 🤷🏽‍♂️
Idk what’s more pathetic to see lebron flexing and screaming after dunking on a smaller man or crying when he get touched 😂
Lakers in 5 in every series till the chip lets go🔥🔥
Nice game for my favorite point guard Chris Paul
Jamal Murray different
The refs sold 😒, only reason  why lakers won.
It should easily be 3-1 lmaoo for the nuggets. Game 2 and 4 the officiating was insanely bad. N I hope those refs never coach in the playoffs again.
Hope we can beat the heat too go lakers and dodgers LA’s next world champs 🎉
bol bol could be a game changer, why they didnt let him play
Murray I've Never Seen A Finish WIth That Amount of Premier Jelly My Goodness....
4:06 I’m a Laker fan but even I know that Murray has solidified himself as a star. How in the hell did he make that??
LBJ is one consistent guy!
Murray is a problem
The problem.  The refs, in these series both teams got same number of fouls. Yet the fouls not called and called are against Denver. Quite clearly there are many instances in this match where Los Angeles is allowed to get away with rougher play and Denver is getting called for the slightest touch. That takes off a lot of pressure from Denvers defense.
Nuggets now : we have got them right where we wanted......
rondo was a good sign for lakers
The ref favors the lakers imao.
nuggets got no calls they was fouling Murray
Bata ka pa Murray haha mga 8 taon pa siguro okay ka na parang oladipo din dati
I dont like davis how he played is vry dramatic..
Go go nuggets
This is the plan all along right? To be down 3-1? 😂😂
Waiting for GAME 7 !!!!!!!
Lebron got carried from ad
Soooo....nobody's gonna talk about j Murray with the Jordan move? He executed it perfectly besides the fact that Jordan jumped a lot higher
Lol what is he even saying at 2:50 is that even a question
Highlights after highlights
$16 Million for airballing!! Dgreen can I have some of that free money  🤣  🤣
so the nuggets cant get a foul?
i'm a laker fan but anthony davis stepping on the inbound line and ref didn't see LMAO 1:43
Hmm yall ready for this 3–1 cheese?
47s that’s all fact best offensive of player on the floor. Like I always said if lakers win won’t be bcuz of lebum it will be bcuz of AD OR RONDO. That bum scared of presser
Murray the magician!!! what a basket!!
To be honest, LeBron has not looked as impressive offensively in this series as he did against the Rockets, however he was the difference late in the game guarding Jamal.
This 3-1 Curse is No Effects on Lakers..There are ...Six Lakers.. Playing On the Court...
Ez win
They pronounced J-RAAAAA-Me Grant's name wrong.
Lakeshow baack were they need to be on top
I know lakers is set to win this but let's all  appreciate the moves Murray did at 4:05. Damn!!
I just came from inside the NBA Charles basically took up for Jokic saying he was gassed because he had to guard AD as you can see in the first quarter they've been switching Grant on AD instead of Jokic having go guard him therefore Charles stop making excuses for AD
Can we all agree that Dwight was the best thing that happen to the lakers besides Lbj and AD.. Man put in work! Proud of him!
7:23 why you do that A.D. lmao
Lakers past 2 series 3-1 leads > Nuggets past 2 series 3-1 deficits
Rondo been ballinggg
Now nuggets down 1-3...you know what's gonna happen next..goodbye Lakers.
Lakers=💍
Me birthday
Ganda ng flow ng offense ng Lakers pag si Rondo ngcocontrol.
I would say that the nuggets are out of this but this is the third time they’ve been down three one so maybe they like it this way.
Finally the Nuggets are down 3-1 in a series again, Can the Lakers end the streak?
All Day Anthony Davis!! AD!!!
Lakers are so very cool it's 3-1
Welp it was nice seeing the lakers
Remember no Playoff P at Lakers 😎
Rondo and Dwight ma men
LETZ GO LAKERS 2K20!!!🏆💜💛💜🎉🎊🙏🍺
Rondo and Howard playing like it’s 2009! Holy shit!!!
Great team effort by the Lakers. But gotta look at Lebron. 17th season WCF game 4 and accepting the challenge of guarding Murray late in the 4th. Can’t believe some people question his will to win.
smith and lebron not having a different handshake lol
Jokic sobrang tamad mo sa depensa potang ina mo.... Takbuhan ang laban hindi yung para kang pagong kong kumilos gago...
So funny when i backread on lakers vs clippers. Bullshit bandwagon fans often says "clippers in 5 or 6"😂
Plumlee is a horrible defender
Its a sure ring waiting for lebron
Reggie Miller and Chris Webber needed to stfu all game long. Riding them Nuggets hard.
Damn both team deserve to be in the finals they’re both lit 🔥 i love this match up! Lakers in 5 lets go!!! 💪🏽
1:43 look closely davis foot 🤣
Rondo playing like he was in celtics before, a great and constant passer. Lakers would be criusing easily on the championshio trophy if he keeps on doing this.
All I’m saying is, Murray has cemented himself in these playoffs. Major respects. Murray better marry that girl 😂😂
Rondo is so underrated🔥🔥
What clippers bench? 🤣
Ang the legend of playoff rondo continues
3-1? ITS TIME TO 🤔
you know that the  west final is over..lakers is not the clippers that the reality..and the the lakers hold the court advantage..thats why the west finals is over in game5
Dwight be working hard boxing out and getting great position. Wish they played him in the second half more
Nuggets in 7
Refs favoring LA - FACTS (not even a nugget fan)
Lakers vs.Miami-2020 NBA Finals 2020 NBA champions-Miami Heat-prediction
Great game all though I’m rooting for the Lakers. The refs did the nuggets dirty.
pina isa na gsto manalo pa hayzz😔
Murray is the guy who you think probably isnt that good and he takes weird shots but he always fkn makes em. Impossible what the guy will do.
may vlogger ulit na mag stop mag upload dahil nanalo lakers,hayzz😔
I know Lebron not bout to let the lakers lose, but I hope the nuggets do what they did all playoffs and prove how tough and how great of a team they are.
I just noticed Coach Michael Malone of the Nuggets claps his hands almost everytime someone scores for his team. As a Lakers fan, I have to say that he's a great coach.
My boy Rondo coming out the wood works for that ass!! Lol LEEETS GO LAKERS!!!!
I could not watch live did the refs do good or nah? Good job by the lakers btw and big respect for denver🔥
frank vogel did a great job whe  he  benched kuzma..no offense to kuzma but his defense sucks..
Playoff rondo> Playoff P
Lakers will wear the Mamba Jersey for game 5......
pray.... Lord forgive me a sinner, i accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior and believe He has risen
REPENT and believe the gospel of Jesus Christ and be converted or u will be condemned.
I love the lakers and this series made me love the nuggets too, i hav so much respect for all of them now
REPENT and believe the gospel of Jesus Christ and be converted or u will be condemned.
James is my idol . James is no longer James 23. He's not James i know before since he was in cleveland and miami. Hes lucky on having davis on his side. i want to see James played like he was in cleveland. Less turnover /
LAKERS!!!!
PAYBACK TIME RAJON RONDO
yawn....   get excited the queen wins another championship but this time in the CCBA (Communist Chinese Basketball Association)  Or should we call it a Collective...
Nuggets aka fuggets coming with the waves of reasons 😂😂😂
Look at howard man he wants it bad
Here we go again: Utah got 3-1 lead  Clippers got 3-1 lead Lakers 3-1
is it gonna be 3-1 or 4-1 curse.
Aight now lake show let's keep that same energy with game 5 and finish this💪🏾
Murray's luck is not enough
Lakers: We're up 3-1!! Nuggets: So you have chosen death
8:57 murray was fouled hard by LBJ
So we know that Playoff Lebron and AD is not softy right. Lakers 4-1
Everyone : FORGET RONDO, HE'S NOT GONNA SHOOT IT  Rondo : i'm gonna end this team whole career
Jordan Murray "always" be balling!
now its 3-1 again for the 3rd time denver will dominate again for the 3rd time? big question mark?
Nuggets crying over no calls, but not talking about all travels Murray is getting away with. Changing pivot foot on your fade away is still a travel.
Denver fans...take care your self..not Clippers.
This Lakers team is clearly and obviously a championship team. The Lakers will win multiple championships
Danny green is Goat Mah boi have a good choice Choosing lakers than Flipper.
Lakers present case to NBA regarding LeBron James’ lack of free throws - 14 free throw for lebron. Politics
LeBron woke up feeling dangerous😈  7 no charge calls 😤 3 no block calls 😡 42 complaints to the refs 😏 3, $100,000 “donations” to the refs and there families 🐐 The only thing stopping this man are actual good calls 😫
Man rondo is lit mannn
Mark My Words this Denver team is gonna be classic team on 2k one day💯
I wanna see Denver come back from down 3-1 but not this time I think they finally are running out of gas because they just played 2 seven game series and the fatigue is finally starting to show and Lakers on played 2 short 5 game series this one will be over in 5 also
Why did Lebron look pissed for the entire game...?
Pls everyone listen to The Whistleblower Podcast & confirm everything you as a fan already know. Refs controls games!!! It’s fixed!
Jokic the new dirk nowitzki♥️♥️
And then 3-2 happened in the next game 😲 that will scare the shit out of the lakers fans if that happened. 😂😂😂
Murray is unorthodox straight getting to the basket
Jamal murry did a kobe lay ub at 4:06. R.i.p goat kobe. and no disrespect but he plays like kobe to
LOS ANGELES Lakers 114 vs 108 DENVER Nuggets
It's time to rest nuggets 🤣🤣🤣
Let's go Lakers
4:04 🔥
Not either teams fan, however just imagining Rondo with both a Celtics and Lakers ring would be an interesting sight.
6:41 that stepstepback tho
this game is unbelievable lakers gatting most of the calls
Do it for kobe Bryant and his daughter win Lakers
Good win, but still not good enough. I still cant pin point why they lakers are not blowing this team away. The score shouldn't be this close.
The refs mvp for the Lakers this game. They have to make sure they get Lakers To the finals so the NBA can make more of their money back. I hope Heat busts their ass when they get to the Finals. Nuggets avenged Mavs, now Heat need to avenge Nuggets.
8:58 clear foul, not called
LeBron James be lookin like somebodies auntie whenever the lakers leave a nigga open.
You know you in trouble when Lebron is making both his freethrows in the 4th.
rondo is the difference
This series is over for 3 reasons 1. The Lakers are up 3-1 2. Lebron James ain't Donovan Mitchell and Utah or Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers The Lakers are aware of what  Denver is capable of and they won't make the same mistake 3.When Lebron James has the opportunity to finish you off he doesn't hesitate at all
LeBron  u r just an animal!! I just love u ❤️❤️❤️
Definitely would have been a series had clippers faced lakers.
Man tht is AD’s signature move😆 I dnt have to say it he does it all the time and where is jr smith? I haven’t heard his name in like 4 games
Murray is Something else man!
Game 5 is a massacre....
Oh no Lakers goes up 3-1, advantage goes to the Nuggets in the next 3 games hahahahaa
That was the best  Western Final I ever seen in years.Both teams played like they wanted to win every possession,but, we all know it's only one winner.I top my hat to both teams.Those youngsters played their hearts out tonight.
i love jr he knows he can't help on the floor so he's 90% standing up on the bench way to play your role
Refs were trash, but overall it was a good ball game 👌
That rondo in 4th quarter is fucking beasts. Hes the one who controlling the game
Its over for the lakers
Rondo has that "misdirection" power.
Good news for the nuggets: Jamal Murray is playing like Michael Jordan   Bad news for the nuggets: Lebron is the opposition
Jr smith just talking shit on the sideline all game long lmao
Playoff Rondo!
Bruh. imagine Giannis brother getting his first championship🔥🔥🔥
Since when does House of Highlights show made free throws?  Guess King making two free throws is extreme shit.
Now we got ourselves a series, Denver bout to show out.
I still cant beleive Rondo is a Laker. I used to hate him back then.
yep rebounds win games!
The Lakers are poised and ready for a chance at the chip, but shoutout to Denver for playing like they are, Jamal has been so impressive, that kid is only going to get better. He's been playing like a superstar.
WARRIOR'S FANS= BLAZERS 👉🏻 ROCKETS 👉🏻 CLIPPERS 👉🏻 NUGGETS 👉🏻 HEAT. what a journey 😂😂😂
Nice refs support....
Lakers up 3-1..  Denver: "Now its time to clap'em"
Who wanna bet  Lakers Or Nuggets?
Which layup yall thought was better? Rondo fake pass layup or Murray's up & under lebron layup?
For all you nuggets fans who thinks you guys will rally back from this deficit, put your money up. #lakeshow  Great game and bright future for the nuggs. Murray and Jokic are in my top 20 now
@8:57 Lebron be like: Nice try kid 😁
yooooooooo this could go to anyone denver got that 1-3 comeback or lakers losing 1 game
My prediction is good.that's 4-1.
Danny green should really consider retirement not even being funny hes so washed up it aint even funny bootlegged ass lazy on defense
LAKERS WINNING THE WHOLE DAMN THING THIS YEAR... THERE IS NO COMPETITION...  LIKE IT OR NOT... LAKERS ARE TO GOOD POUND FOR POUND.. NO MATCH ...
Denver will lose the series, but murray he is playing in another level. Everyone must watch murray ascend to the mount rushmore. This guy is not a joke. Wao an amazed by his basketball
If Nuggets comeback 3-1 against the Lakers, I won’t be surprised if they come back 3-0 in the finals.
Win this for Kobe!
4:05 is the best RIP replay
Go Lakers! Please finish the game at game 5! Win this series all the way!
Nuggets : "1-3. That feels weirdly familiar".
LA Lakers is not the Los Angeles Chokers. This WCF is over! See ya all in the Finals.
Clearly porter is better than kuzma no question. Kuz is gone next year win or lose
Rondo being a Point God.
AD became a good actor when he join bron and the lakers
NBA+ Refs+ Lakers against Nuggets in this game.   Q: Why Lakers have to cheat with NBA to win this game???   A: Because LAL is scared of Denver Nuggets now  And I'm a Lebron James fan
Lakers veterans are on a mission rn!
Go lakers.....
Lakers are 36-1 when up 3-1 🤷‍♂️
lebron is a cry baby
8:57 .... no foul???
AD looking like Kobe out there🐍
Nuggets fan: we can come back Lakers: hold the sauces...
2 straight 3s right in front of Kuzma 🤦🏼‍♂️ God he was so horrible on D.
NBA FINALS: MIAMI HEAT VS. LA LAKERS like if you agree
Honestly after seeing the first quarter I knew who was going to win.
Imma big LeBron fan but i really hate how he handled the ball, it was like it took a while before he passed the ball and they were running out of time at the same time. I understand he was frustrated to make his basket but he aint efficient this night. You can do better next time bron!
refs can't help nuggets tonight
I love that NOBODY on this LAL team is selfish. It's a completely utilitarian system.
Im a Lakers fan but i watched these highlights for Murray.. This guy is a highlight reel by himself
Why is nobody talking about Jamal murray? Guys a damn beast
Lebron haters be like he needs superstars to win. Bruh no one wins champion alone even jordan need pippen and rodman even kobe need shaq and  pau 🤦‍♂️ basket ball isn't a one on one game
IMAGINE NUGGETS COMEBACK AGAIN 3-1
👂🏾 👂🏾👂🏾👂🏾👂🏾👂🏾👂🏾👂🏾👂🏾👂🏾👂🏾👂🏾👂🏾👂🏾
DENVERRR
Leborns Defence of Murray in the last 5 minutes is Superb. Something the Dogs like Kahwi and PG cannot do against Murray.
My team, the Lakers should finish 😤 this next game 🎮 hahanahahaha!
Playoff Murray is going to be a legit problem for all teams  throughout his career & tonight proved that..
Guess we gotta do that 1-3 thing again lol
LAKERS WIN BECAUSE OF FREETHROWS IN THE FINAL MINUTES TERRIBLE GAME
Nuggets: It's 3-1 time 👊 Lakers: Hold my beer, It's 4-1 time 😎
If the NUGGETS give PORTERHOUSE more minutes I believe they can win game5 but not the series.🤔
Refs be loving on the lakers
imma text trump to get murray on lakers
Let denver get they calls
Respect denver and lakers. This play offs is one of the most amazing play off bec of denver
Kobe would never want the Lakers to win by ref. He would want the Lakers to win fair and square.....rip Mamba
For gawddamn sake please don't start green.. jr looks far better than him.. every game misses bag full of open shots.. smh..
I'd rather be up 3-1 than down 3-1.  It's not over, but great game - the quality was the best of the playoffs so far. Go Lakers!
I think next season denver will be a beast if they keep their roster
MP.Jr looks like he could be next KD
cant believe i’m boutta see my Lakers in the finals after 10 long years...life is good man
Please Lakers finished it on G5 for 4-1
Im LA all day but that boy Murray is nastyyyyy wit it
Rondo is the secondary LeBron when he not in wit the passes
Lakers have to stop blowing big leads
Plsss give credits to kuzma also❤️
Danny Green is so trash offensively.
I watched it live, still can’t believe that Murray lay up
Bruh who else was scared shitless when ad got "injured"
I thought James was ballin with one shoe for a second 😂
3:59 is that an inbound violation?
lmao Murray asking for a foul
This Chicago Bulls Rondo
Big 3 for the Lakers LBJ, Davis,  and Rondo.....put some respek on #9's name
Kuzma and KCP is Wtf. 🏀😶
I swear man this golden nuggets “fans” be trippin... They be like lebron can’t win without an allstar help like bro use your brain even jordan and kobe got help winning a chip
JAMAL MURRAY MY FAVORITE
"There is only one KING" 👑 in this land's and He bring championship rings!!!! To every city that he plays for... JAMES that's right LeBron james can you dig it!!! 💯🔥👑
Games 1-3 Bron only shoots 10 FT combined and no one bats an eye. Game 4 Bron finally gets some well deserved calls and everyone goes crazy saying refs are fixing the game lol Nah keep that same energy. Refs have really only had one bad half against the Nuggets everything else has been in the Nuggets favor.
Playoff rondo looked like rihanna playing for playoffs
Lakers ~ Ready to tip it up ~ and the WHOLE THING, not JUST a thing of beauty, but fluid Art !
Nuggets in 7
yall think the nuggets are nice but when the crowd comes back theyll be cold
For those complaining for either side about foul calls this series...   FTA Lakers 113 Nuggets 113   Personal Fouls Lakers 109 Nuggets 98
ok. it's 3-1. Lakers watch out! It;s nuggets time.
Man those were some incredible shots by Murray.
Howard im not the softest gay n the league 4:20
Me: "how do you bite from a step back pump fake"??? Kusma: "hold My Beer"
Lakers: It's 3-1. You're done.  Nuggets: I like those odds.
Referee want give denver the foul calls..Lebron be foul denver ever game no call..
FKN HALARIOUS HOW STUPID PPL WERE LIKE OHHHHHH DENVER WON 1 NOW WE GOTTA SERIES ! BAHAHAHAH FKN LOSER SHEEPS NON BASKETBALL MORONS
These dudes really playing plumlee over BOL BOL
8:56 omg that block of LeBron definitely said it all.
NUGGETS NEED TO PLAY BOL BOL!!!!!!
Bruh I hate how they give so much minutes to Danny slightly early and kuz they both constantly under perform
Denver is giving the Lakers more trouble than the Rockets and the Blazers LOL
Trade Kyle Kuzma please😂
Typical Lakers giving 1 win against every team
Fuck man

6:39
yo Shannon Sharpe predicted this game perfectly
Super team still needed refs to win this game
Lebron shutting down Murray is gonna ruin dude's confidence for rest of the series. Hope AD recovers after tonights injury..
720p bruh? It's not 2007...
Nice travel by porter
0:53 when Green Help on the drive, leaving his man wide open, when Dwight and Lebron are right behind him. How are these guys in the NBA??? this is so basic...its hard to watch such low IQ on the court.
Bet y’all chicken nuggets fan are crying. Y’all should’ve not put yourself through this torture and not watch the games
9:47 every laker fan says let’s go
Here we go again😂😂
Nuggets ah shit here we go again😎
Man as a laker fan Denver is tough then boys ain’t got no quit in them and kuzma needs to stay planted and stop jumping in the same damn move
familiar 3-1 for denver.
Nuggets: down 1-3 Everyone: hmmmm where have we seen this before? Me as a lakers fan: 😶😶😶
Imagine the nuggs make another 3-1 comeback 3rd time in a row Playoffs Agianst the lakers with Anthony davis and lebron James
typical bron getting carried, boo boo lip bron asking for more foul free throws and he got em.
*DENVER PLANNED TO G0 DOWN 3-1..ITS THEIR STRATEGY...*
Anthony Davis is carrying this series
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiUUTejzUyk      5:24-5:32 commentator mess up
It’s 3-1 again 😐
I think i hate Kyle Kusma. Trash day is tomorrow, and he should be right next to my Garbage.lol he sucks
Lakers just poked the bear, Nuggets will do what they did to Clippers and Jazz lol.
Rondo and LeBron are strictly teammates looking for a ring. Low-key that don't like each other
Bench Harris - Nuggets fan
1:42 AD out of bounds
Snoop Dogg: “we not the clippers.”😂💯
Lebron taking Murray at the end won the game for us! That boy is a fire cracker man and he was still going hard with lbj on him. The clamps tho I’m pretty sure he didn’t score after the switch. We will need this next game too
Danny Green 🗑 he been getting away with it cause we winning
3 - 1? Based on what I have seen, Lakers are playing great. Davis has improved more his shooting. Rondo's IQ and experience will surely be of great help.
When denver wins, if they win, next game, the internet is gonna be shaking 😂
Lakers take so many free throws it’s crazy
You know it’s official when the commutator says “playoff rondo” mad respect ✊🏾 for rondo!
4:02 SMOOOOOTH
OOPS!!!
Is 3-1 The series officially begins 😂
The refs gave it away in the end, a couple of dumb calls in favor of Lakers and no calls in major cases for Denver. I'm not a Nuggets fan particularily, nor do I hate the Lakers, especially since they're also fighting for Kobe, but Denver is playinf with a lot of heart so it hurts to see then treated like this.
Am i the only one who see that kuzma is useless for lakers?
I feel like Denver made alot of miracle shots and LA made alot of easy / quality shots, better team won.
this nuggets team is dangerous. Murray is so clutch.
Rondo out there holding the playoffs hostage!!!
Rondo 👌👏👏👏
anyone remember when Kusma pushed Lebron, asking him to play defense??? Play some defense Kusma. My god!
Hard to win when its 8vs5. Good effort Nuggets. The NBA was never gonna let you win this series.
Murray has the potential to be better than curry.....
Murray just might drop 40 next game, but that flight back to Denver will be long & quiet.
That was a clear foul on Murray tho by James at the end when the score was 103 - 105... The ref was right there idk why he didn't call a foul
Rondos always been a stud man
Hey guys 4:13 Dhoward, is that legal? or offensive foul? he did throw that man away right? What strength lol
How much did you pay to get a Laker season pass, J. R. Smith?
parang kape 😂3 in 1💪
The only reason L.A. is good is cuz they got so many good people
Malaking pakinabang c howard sa lakers
Ay nisukol!!!! Hahahahahahhaha
Goddamn playoff rondo is good!
4:03 if you dont like that, you dont like nba basketball😭 man Jamal Murray is cooking in the conference 🔥
Now 3-1 as Nuggets wished, but it is not gotta work on Lakers. Just enjoy your last game on Saturday.
To all you clowns saying the refs are rigging the games...don't you think they would have rigged it for the Clippers to win so it can be Lakers/Clippers??? You guys are really pathetic smh. Bunch of crybabies lol
Rondo Loki still that nigga
Lakers: 3-1 Nuggets: Here we go! the time has come.
Dude jamal murray is starting to look like 2015 curry .. different style of plays but you can see how dangerous they are on the court
Nobody:   Murray: 100% contested
my starting five for the lakers: bron, davis, kcp, rondo & howard. come on guys! why do this coach keeps on putting green on? hes a good 3pt shooter but he's not consistent and hes like out there always waiting for the ball.
Murray reminds me of Tony Parker
cook is the lakers' lucky charm. stay on the bench bruh.
Refs had brons dong in their mouth for this one
Milsap and G Harris lost them this game...refs cheated like a mf....listen to commentators during and after the game for proof
Its over bro 😪
JR Smiths is now a motivational player to the Lakers organization on the bench ..Good signing 🙂
I don’t think Jokic hit a field goal in the second half. (Cough paid off cough).
Congratulations to the Nuggets for taking out the Lakers. Good luck in the finals
Okay, the WCF have officially started
Recuerda que Murray la mete.... AASTA QUEE LEBRON LO GARDEAAAA
I hope AD ankle is good.
If you guard Rondo, he passes it, Lakers score. If you dont guard Rondo, he shoots it, Lakers score.
lakers vs prtland  3-1 lakers vs houston 3-1 lakers vs denver 3-1 denver vs utah 1-3 denver vs clippers 1-3 denver vs lakers 1-3 good match up
Is it me or does anyone else think they  need to do a investigation on the lakers and lebron cause they always get whatever call they want I personally think that their paying the refs
Why is Murray out there doing nikka like that lol smh he hit them with that mj move act like u gonna dunk than reversing on you wasn't as high but he still did it 💪👌👈
Honestly Lakers are very overrated they should of lost they been getting lucky Denver really could be up 3-1 lakers have no scores beside AD Danny green should consider retirement i mean hes literally gettn shooting advice from Shaq pure garbage
Denver might've won if they kept hitting 3 pointers but they didn't.
Lebron clamped that shit up
Damn green and kuzma lmao.. Start playing cook, Smith and tucker.. Maybe better 3 pointers
Lakers gonna lose straight now since they're up 3-1
Oh no, are the nuggets down 3-1? What ever are they to do?? 😱
I won't lie... A Murray vs Herro finals would be the most fun 🤷
Lakers: Let’s go we are up 3-1 Nuggets: ALRIGHT BET
You can have all the highlights, i will get the win
Jokic defense honestly is terrible. Offensively the man is a crazy threat. But the Lakers lived in that paint. Jokic cannot defend Bron or AD on switches. Virtually impossible especially of they getting what they want in the paint. Nuggets need to put someone defensively sound in the 2021 roster. Like a young stretch big
They should always start Howard and Rondo shining older guys shining bright All my older Alphas keep shining in discipline #dontbeshockedaolderAlphatakeurbae💖💪🏽🙏🏽😂💀🤣😂💪🏽
People after Denver win game 3:The Lakers are in trouble.  People after Lakers win game 4: Silence.
Gd  game LA
I just wanna commend what dwight Howard did in this game. You are on shape ma'Bigfilla 🔥🔥🔥💯
Say what u want about wats going to happen in this series...as a die hard Lakers fan dat brutha Murray is a beast...didn't realise how good dis dude was
Lakers got out rebounded in game three by a large margin.  They fixed that problem tonight and it was the difference
NICE LAKERS .. PLAY A LOT OF DEFENSE AND OFFENSE .. A LOT OF ENERY .. NICE TEAM WORK .. LBJ AND AD IS VERY UNSTOPPABLE ...
NBA is rigged Vegas called the shots. Second half the over under was 108 points. Lakers and denver scored 107 total 2nd half and Lakers spread was half a point for the 2nd half and Lakers scored just 1 point more than Denver this betting odd is impossible to win.
As a Lakers fan, I used to think Murray was a punk. Psssh...I give myself an L for that. Dude is a KILLER. He made three shots in this game that would've been ICONIC just 10 years ago. Mavs and Nuggets are setup for some real title chances in the next 4-5 years with their young core. But now, it's our time.
Now we bout to do what everyone could not do not blow a 3-1 lead
4:04 this move is sick
Hope y’all boys having a great night man win or lose we should be blessed to watch the best sport in the world.  I’m a small YouTuber looking for some support appreciate y’all ✊🏾
OFFICIATING IN THIS GAME SUCKED!
Another 3-1 situation for Denver
Lakers need to be on point next game . Them nuggets are gonna come with that heat . They got heart not gonna lie
Cry baby lebron wasnt getting enough FT hope hes happy now
4:02
wtf happen to LB jump shot
Nuggets down 3-1. Oh Well here we go again.
Nuggets 3-1 Comebacks 3-1 vs Utah 3-1 vs Clippers  Lakers 3-1 Lead 3-1 vs Portland 3-1 vs Rockets NOW GAME 5 IS THE DECIDING GAME🔥😳🏀
Rondo ipasses Scottie pippen 😎🏆
Props to Murray tho, dude was putting on a show 🔥
Damn refs okay I see you. Too bad you can’t see how bad you are at your damn job
Playoff Jamal Murray > playoff rondo
playoff rondo is not a myth..his court vision is underrated tho
Heat will Dominate this lebum team
Oh ohh its 3-1 careful lakers
I remember my only one, LAL, 24 IDOL KOBE BRAYNT..missing you Legend💛🇵🇭
Just imagine if they had Avery Bradley in the bubble
if you switch rondo with cp3 then cp3 will dominate aswell with that group. Cp3 is better
We will see whos team will do the same in the past rivalries. Lakers to 4-1 or denver 4-3. This is exciting guys 🔥
Cry baby Lakers
LeBron has 14-0 record in NBA playoffs after taking 3-1 lead...
5 more victories L.A. Go get it!! Mamba $hots!!
AD's ankle is going to be the determining factor now. If he's good LA can close this.
I'd love to see  nuggets win simply because I'm tired of seeing the same players and teams win I want new faces, however I doubt they can, not gonna say it's impossible because if any team can do it, it's the nuggets simply because no other team has done it but highly unlikely. Also Murray did from dirty on that layup lol . I guarantee u if from starts on Murray when he's fresh Murray will be doing all kind of tricks on him. People saying LeBron shut him down, I didn't see it. Rondo did all the work on murray then LeBron stepped in and basically took the credit. I often wonder if NBA is rigged for certain teams to get the chip?
Refs in 6
Ref: im with you lakers
This game was so rigged 😂
7:44  Murray's shot switching from right to left was insane body control on mid-air.
Nuggets hoping to win against the 'King' is pathetic!
So people are actually rooting for the lakers... same people that rooted for golden state back in the day I see... fuck lebron
Danny Green loses his form after joining the lakers.
Rondo looks like KCP with that new look
Let's go Lakers!!! I think this series is over and all they have to do is put Denver away to move on to the finals
The "History" repeat itself
LAKERS IN 5: AM I RIGHT? MIAMI - 3-1 👍👍👍♥️🏀♥️👍👍👍 LAKERS -3-1 CONGRATS!♥️ RONDO ON FINALS  MODE
Time to fry some nuggets Lakers send them home for messing with your lil brothers
The series just started for the Nuggets. At 1-3 deficit, they got the Lakers at where they wanted them to be.
Kuzma lover
Shannon called it Lakers by 6 points tonight.
Bron looking at his teamates after every nugget point is like the most toxic trait in a team... every point hes already looking for someone to blame
Playoff Murray is a beast. Playoff mvp material.
Lakers in 5
playoff rondo is real ladies and gentlemen
That defense on murray by LBJ into the last 5 mins of the game was absolutely perfect 👊👊
I’m convinced that whoever wins game 5 will win the series
C'mon Lakers time to flush these Nuggets down the toilet where they belong.
Cp3 for the win
People are quick to bring up Nuggets past 2 series with 3-1 deficits, but don't forget the Lakers were also in this situation the past 2 series up 3-1 and won in 5 games in both series. Lakers got this in the bag! It's over.
Nuggets trying to repeat a 3-1 come back. But Lakers trying to repeat a 4-1 close out.
We ain't the clippers or the jazz just to let yall nuggets fans know
Good job lakers
Ohh shit lets wait and see now can the nuggets make it three in a row come back from 3- 1 down
play off rondo  is real but murray is fun to watch😎
Nuggets: Exactly the position we want to be in right now. Lakers: Also exactly the position we want to be in right now after losing only one game.
Lebron has great game awareness for being one of the stupidest people on earth
3 1 again denver
It's a wrap Nuggets ain't gonna make a comeback for sure Lakers going to the finals
This is it nuggets gonna win this series.
Lebron needs to play off ball more. Eveytime Rondo ran the o good things happened
LA referees 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁!!!
Murray out here wylin tho
LA vs DEN: 3-1.. aah sjit, here we go again.
Hold up, are we gonna ignore Jamal Murray and his crazy inside shots. God dam he ballin
Lakeshow ☝️🏀🖤
Bruh playoff rondo is no joke 🔥🔥🔥
NBA refs disgusting as always. Can't wait for Lebron to retire.
Rondo needs to play more , also Howard
NBA to Refs: Lakers must win! LeBron to Refs: "Screams like a bit** every time he's driving to the basket".
4:02 is what you all came here for.
Yawn
JM is amazing
I'm really not seeing a comeback now! I doubted Denver before but the Lakers are motived. They have 1 goal. To win the chip for Kobe!
Denver let's go let bol bol play so you can win
9:42 bruh how many handshakes does LeBron got
4:06 wooow michael jordan
✌🏾🙏🏾🐜Lets Go Lakers 🙏🏾✌🏾🐜A Ring & Trophy for my Sisters’, please and thank you dearly
Heat Lakers in Finals
It should be illegal how bad Danny Green is
Referees fixed this game. LeBum faulted Murray all night long but corrupt referees did nothing about it !
All part of the plan.
Let’s face it, the NUGGETS are GREAT. But the Lakers are determined. Everyone knows Kobe passed away, the Lakers will not settle for anything less than the chip.
too much drama lakers will win this match up game and win a ring this season haha
When the sloppy toppy stops getting you dubs 👀✍️
Bro......... Jamal did it on the main players for the LAL. He's a UK beast. LAL better not sleep. (You Slip You Slide)
It is too lopsided, and it is no fun to watch the playoffs this year because Lakers has all the big guns and they are going to win the Championships.   They blew away Rockets which is good team. They are going to blow away Nuggets.   May as well give them the NBA trophy now.
THIS IS WHY LEBRON RECRUITED RONDO. SOME SUPERSTARS GONE IN THE PLAYOFFS BUT RONDO KNOWS HOW TO PLAY RIGHT IN THE PRESSURE.
Two words: PLAYOFF RONDO. When it comes to the playoffs, nothing beats experience and maturity - and it showed in the 2nd half. Rondo just kept on making plays left and right to keep the Lakers afloat! LET’S GO LAKESHOW, EYES ON THE PRIZE BABY
These Lakers are solid!
4:01 Murray's acrobatic layup is so cool..
It’s hard to watch the NBA because of their garbage refs. If it wasn’t for such a wide free throw attempt discrepancy, the Nuggets easily win this game.
@4:13 look at the Dwight Howard just SHOVE Jeremi Grant!!!  The NBA needs the Lakers in the finals... Especially with this social crap going on
As a die hard Lakers fan I've probably had a couple of mini strokes during the last 2 games. Much respect to the Nuggets nevertheless. Go Lakers!
That boy Murray has my respect as a Laker fan 💯
Lakers สู้สู้สู้
nice game..
The Nuggets got the Lakers right where they want em.
Howard should start over McGee tbh at the 5
Take Danny Green out and put in j.r.
If games 2 and 3 had been officiated fairly, the Lakers would have been going for the sweep in this game.
AD deserves Final MVP, & not LBJ  if Lakers win it all ..Even though am a Lebron fan
Murray reminds me of young russel westbrook back in young okc finals vs miami
3-1 nuggets will win this no doubt
This Lakers team has came a long way :,) I remember watching lebron miss all his free throws last season and ball shoot air balls lol
Okay its now 3-1 again. Nuggets magic activate!
Ouch ... Porter Jr put Kuzma on skates .. 💜💛
Where not the flippers
did rondo break murray's ankles with that fake pass?
Bron lookin frustrated lol
Denver came back 3-1 in 2 series Lakers 4-1 in 1st 2nd round
Also work on that 3-2 zone defense you guys was terrible on that 1st half defense
Nice 1 Lakers 😆
"Your in no position to challenge my Expertise"-Lakers Organization
Lakers fucked up. Nuggets wanted to be down 3 - 1 😭😭
Lakers need to complain about Lebron's no-calls more 😂😂😂 fucking crybabies but it works
Did Murray pull a Jordan move at 4:02 ???
Jamal Murray is something else yo
Shannon: Hehehe BABY GOAT! Ol' Bron doing Goatish things as usual  Skip: mmm, scoff, sigh...the basketball gods said let there be LeBron.  Shannon: Skiup you a hater--How you doing Skip?
AD was ungaurdable the first half but Murray with them crazy moves!
Joselico gracias 🇺🇸🏦🏀💪🏻
We're not the Clippers. This series is over
Wow I’m a Jamal Murray fan I’m convinced dude is really good the lakers are just a better team
Better game LeBron keep going to the basket aggressively don't worry about the outside right now. These teams are trying to take you out so focus on the championship only.
This was the worst game. The refs gave the lakers that win. Just like in all the games.
4:04
Murray is rl cold wtf , man woke up in this bubble and jokic they are a tandem
Lakers: We're up 3-1 Nuggets: *activates "Ultra Instinct" mode
If lakers win one more game its over
cool play off rondo wat a nice game for lakers
Rondo giving me chills.
4:04 i had almost the exact same reaction as the commentators. WOW
Lebron played bad 😔, they should have lost
murray🔥🔥
That Jamal Murray supernova layup is instant classic legendary status! My goodness! Gr8 cirtical game 4 win Lakers!!
Okay, so nobody's gonna talk about The King's clutch free throws🤷🏻‍♂️
Love seing Howard on the first 5👊
I know his bro is in charge of the barbers and everything, but damn I think Rondo's changed his cut more times in the bubble than the rest of his career combined...
Raptors fan here: IM AM SCARED FOR LA.
Nobody talking about Murray in the comments
everyone knows what happens to a 3-1 lead😄😄😄if the lakers can handle the pressure they can win it all, but miami is hungry to win it all too👍👍👍
114-106 from game 3
Gotta give props to da nuggets but Lakers in 5 !!! 🥳LeBron closer AD undeniable
Nice to see the refs coming through for the Lakers after that complaint.
I think Miami vs LA would go 7 games and AD would go for like 40 and win it all. AD, Jimmy Butler, and Jamal Murray are fucking eating these playoffs
I think its funny how LeBron became apart of the highlights making 2 free-throws late in the 4th #notthenorm🤣🤣🤣
Jamal Murray is amazing.
When the lakers bench shows up they are hard to beat. Good effort denver
Way to blow another nba finals season nuggets
Lakers in 6 I'm calling it!!!
And u think LEBRON WILL CHOKE A 3-1 LEAD?  FUCKK OFF
Nuggets: we got them right where we want them hehehehe
Denver VS ref and lakers
Man, Rondo and Dwight tho. Sheesh
Lakers win or lose All i want is Bron, Rondo & Howard to play like they used to when they were on their prime. These guys might seem old, but they have much more to deliver to this sports. I just love seeing them playing. I cannot hate these legends for who they were and who they are in this playoffs. ♥️
Nuggets: 3-1 is exactly the recipe we want.
WTF Rondo controling the ball!
Respect for Jamal Murray. This man just showed plenty of highlights in this game.
Dayum. Murray is on 🔥, but the Lakers gonna win anyways
3:12   : Kyle Kuzma has scored the last 8 for the lakers. wAiT WHaTtTt?...
Rondo is the key of lakers success
Lakers should have lost this game.....Now the Nuggets down 3-1 and got them right where they want them😅
Can't imagine what a Kentucky alumni pick up game looks like but Jamal and Rajon can't be on the same team. Good game!✌
here we go again they another 3-1 drama
Lebron just gotta bully Murray  common man 😤
Best players on Lakers team were referees.They were silent last 4 minutes every time Murray got smacked by James.
I would love to see a HEAT vs LAKERS finals.     Great Teamwork Grind vs Superstars combo powered LA. The west teams are dominated with star duo powered team: Kawhi and Pandemic P, Harden/ Westbrook, Lebronica/Davis. EAST has only Gianni's. But the Heat took him down easilly. That's really interesting.😀😉
Looks like lebron is missing a shoe
Job not done. You are up 3-1... JOB NOT DONE.
The 3 - 1 comeback begins now
We should still be talking about “Playoff Murray”🔥
Jim is so wonderful
After this performance there's no way we can say giannis is better than anthony davis I'm sorry
After this year the NBA's gonna have to put some real respect on Murray's name frfr, kid nice
Lmao refs in 6. Seriously, so many calls went LeBrons way. And let’s not even mention how AD rolled his OWN ankle but they gave a foul to Millsap and 2 free throws to AD. Charles Barkley even said it himself, one of the worst officiating games he’s seen in the bubble. I’ve never been one to say games/sports are rigged, but this one was almost spoon-fed to the Lakers.
Lot of bad calls!!!
jamal Murray is going to be a SUPERSTAR!!! mark my words!!!
9/24/2020 for Kobe. I love it bro. 3-1 lead if the nuggets make a major comeback like they did to the clippers my heart will explode 😆 🤣 jk I love it man can't wait
lakers in 6.
nuggets heart been snatched after the game hahahaha thats what you get murray after that little three that you have haha
Honestly. Murray > PG13
rondo is a problem
Jamal Murray is balling out of his mind
I'm a Lebron fan but how come Anthony Davis is never in the thumbnail. Like he has outscored Bron in a lot of these playoff games including this one.
Man why the nuggets ain't got bol bol out there it's not making no sense something must be going on behind the scenes because bol is a demi
lebron asking kawhi and curry now for tips
The times rondo had the ball he looked like he was scared trying to give it away and just lost
damn jamal Oh My ghad
6:00 what a move
Alot of people hating on kuzma (why)its his first playoffs beside we're not flippers fan we are not going to turn our back on him cause he had some bad games.. Lakers Loyalty
Miami the 2020 NBA CHAMPION
3-1:! Nuggets: Challenge accepted
Solid Lakers here.😘😀 Both team are doing a great job Kobe is watching.😘😘😘
Refs want Lakers to win so bad, rigged
Super team sure win👍
Lot of these players wouldn’t be shining if crowd was in the house
Ad is so talented
I can practically hear the 'LeBron, you didn't take my salad' 😂😂😂
👀👀👀
If Dwight Howard started in game 3 we would have swept it.
" We've been here before & we won't fold time to win 3 st8"  - Nuggets after the game
4:03 jamal murry got the move 🔥
Miami and Lakers will face in NBA FINALS!!..mark my word because its scripted
Los Angeles VS Miami
The series is done for. Nuggets on 7
Kuzma is garbage
There's no comeback for this 3-1 deficit. Lebron for sure knows how to close the series. Even if there will be g7. Lakers will win
Bias commentators 👎🏻
Refs tried against Heat yesterday.. Nuggets already down and refd still stepping on their faces.. Saw this scripts since 2000s.. NBA aint legit.. Time to switch to Euro.. Atleast they're not political..
Who gives a shit about basketball in today's world? They should cancel this nonsense!!!
Lookingvibrant.com is the 👑💯
too easy.cliopers shouldve face the lakers
They should have given porter jr more on court time..
Give Jamal credit he wasn't trying go down 3-1 to the lakers👏
Nuggets right now: it is what it is
They were only down by 6, and had over 6 seconds left. Not even going to attempt to come back?
This is what happens when you wear that rainbow colour shit on ur kit
I hate Javid please Jamal go off
Nice win Lakers!!! 💪💜💛 gudluck to that 3-1 comeback coz it will never happen. 😂😛
3-1 is a dangerous lead for all the wrong reasons these days,  especially against this team evidently since it's their specialty
Denver +6  its a draw!
Nuggets bout to turn on the jets after this game
lebron will win this for Kobe.
Nuggets time
Fuck lebron mann🤦😂
Game rigged.. refs not calling any calls.. nuggets was getting fouled all night
3-1 Nuggets vs. Mamba jersey Lakers.  Immovable Object vs. an Unstoppable Force
No doubt lakers will win this series, they have many A-rank players.
"3-1 emergency service, ACTIVATE!" - Nuggets
get these wack ass announcers off TV
Jamal finna get that good good to get that boost
Lakers will win this series .. i bet 200,000
lebron lang pala katapat mo murray 😂😂
Go go go sago lakers👊✌🥰🥰🥰🥰
There’s no way the nba is gonna let the lakers lose because of Kobe what’s gonna happen is the lakers are gonna win and make a tribute for Kobe...
The defense is the key. Murray out scored by lbj last 3 minutes
Portland 4 - 1 Houston 4 - 1 Denver 4 - 1 Heat 4 - 1
Yea true nuggets came back from a 3-1 series beat clippers. But face it clippers only had one experienced champion n that is kawaii Leonard. Lakers got four champion players experience. Lakers have better chance closing out the nuggets.
The Monstars gonna win it all
*win, lose, draw.. Jamal Murray is the Playoffs MVP*
After watching LeBron in the 4th, I honestly don't think skip will discredit him
Karma has come full force Clippers aren't a true team they just business colleagues
Bruh Rondo literally out there controlling the game it's crazy
1:51 Howard with 8 rebounds in the 1st quarter? What?
KCP and Rondo. 👀  Also Dwight had 8 boards in the 1st??😬
Lebron best player in the world and best player on his team. A complete package player not just in points but also in rebounds and assist unlike AD. Too many records in NBA History and an MVP runner up this year and An All NBA First team
denver , especially Murray showing alot of heart on these series.
Lol it's the battle between Colorado and California for who has the best green I guess we will find out who wants the smoke
Not a chance!
I been saying for the longest,These games are rigged!
Lakers were getting all the calls nuggets weren't getting anything
Chicken Nuggets for dinner!
Damn, where this defense from LeBron?? Looking like a little of the all nba Miami version LBJ, took assignment of Murray when nobody could slow him down. And hit clutch FTs...if either LeBron or AD is off night shooting, they're too versatile not to impact the game in other ways
Nuggets must let the 2 bigman play in 4rth q
Why was two guards rebounding for a free throw. Who were the other two on the floor? That was weird
Remember that time... Rondo bumped into that ref that left ah skid mark and they didn't wipe it off. Lol
We all see this as an absolute win.
AD was unstoppable in the 1st QT like Damn!
Rondo played bad this game. He need an offensive game
Let's go lakers,,,,let's go lakers.
Everytime LB plays the point or defend Murray, it causes the Nuggets a lot of problems.Sure enough,they put James at the point in game 5,the Lakers win the series LB gets a triple double and Murray is not as affective as he usually be.I knew this was Lakers coaches game plan for game 5.
So rondo's miss rebound is a highlight?
lebron also came back from a 3-1 so maybe he won't choke. at least i hope not.
Welcome to the "blocked by james" highlight, jamal murray
I hate when Jokic is so passive he needs 2be more aggressive sometimes
Bruh that 4:08 shot is unreal
3-1 vs 1-3 lol
Nuggets know what time it is. They gone shock the world watch
Lebum fouled Murray couple of times in the late game but got away....all this time LeBron benefits from leniency show by the refs....look at the amount of easy points LeBron score.... opponents can't defend like he does because they know they would get called.
as a lebron fan it's hard seeing Lebron kinda losing his prime 😢 #17th season
Chris Paul with that defense
Too many contact no foul .
Too many free throws for the lakers
COME NUGGETS, CLIPPERS AND GSW FANS,, LETS GO SUPPORT MIAMI HEAT NOW.
Can we talk about how trash KUZMA has been. MY LORD.
I want this to go to 7 games but these Refs aren't gonna let that happen they know what happens now when the Nuggets are down 3-1.
Rondo made Murray fall with that pass fake 😭😂
Nuggets have em right where they want em down 3-1
Familiar territory?... I'm not so sure this time
You simply cannot rely heavily on cheese if you want to beat the Lakers. Go take charges and try to draw 40 fouls a game elsewhere.
LBJ on Murray turning point of the game
looping at 4:05
LeBron defense in the 4th 🔥🔥🔥
All series 4-1 haha from the start to end 💪💪💪
Lakers vs heat finals
They got cheated on calls idgaf I’m a bucks fan & that shit was rigged
LA on the way, ,,,,
Nuggets known for coming back in 3-1  But Lakers known for finishing series on 4-1 😅😅😅
Imagine the criticism LeBron would have got if he missed those clutch free throws..
not gonna lie i like denvers flow than lakers.. lakers are too stagnant when lebron is with the ball..but that lebron D on Murray tho..
Lbj put the clamps on murray, in the last few minutes
Good game! Nuggets are good but the Lakers have been the more aggressive team. Hopefully people don’t switch the narratives to suit their own personal bias because this is what the nba fan base is coming down to.
ONE MORE WIN LAKERS ONE MORE!!!!!!       GA GA
Gosh that was close, where was lebrons 4th quarter mentality. I miss that
8:41 and 9:00 Murray slow AF. This is why they lost.
*LeBron the goat*
I am so happy for Dwight Howard, he really came out and set the tone for the Lakers early in the first quarter.
The prolific scorer gets to play 20 mins/game off the bench.  Thanks, Coach Malone.  Easy win for the Lakers.
This game was so rigged it’s disgusting
So now the game begins. They have fell right into the nuggets trap. Chuck predicted a sweep, Nuggets blown out game 1, Nuggets down 3-1. History bought to be made
Denver down 3-1 from Utah and Clippers.  Lakers 3-1 leads from Portland and Rockets. Let's go! 💪💛💜🤍🖤  You know what I'm saying.  Congrats Lakers 4-1! 🤘
Lakers gonna put their nuggets on bbq sauce bruh.
w and she is so fat and he has no one in her
Nuggets is so very dangerous team to face in the play offs..
If the lakers dont win 4:1 next game nuggets will go to the finals they always win 4:3 😂
Nuggets Bench at 4:07
Took a super team effort to take down these Nuggets, they are no joke, even though they got the joker on their team.
frey was my
Now the series starts
Rajon rondo looks like Roger from American dad
lakers in 7!!
DENVER TOTAL REBOUNDS 33 LAKERS TOTAL REBOUNDS 41  Proof of great adjustment for the lakers big to do their job get rebound and making AD a catch and shoot PF and dominate the painted area.. 💪 lets go lakers finish this series its over
Thanks for sitting Porter Jr and let him play 30 mins per game.  Go Lakers!!
I didnt know Nightblue3 played for Denver Nuggets
The game moves to fast for these refs.
Jamal literally ascended during these playoffs
This seems familiar
Rajon Rondo el mejor jugador en lo personal..!! 🏀
6:30 Playoff Rondo 🙏
GG this series is over no way the nuggets come back from another 3-1
Imagine half you points being from free throws *cough lbj
Yes I'm Lakers Fan but it's 3-1 favor to Lakers But it's nuggets
LAL:  2-0 in 3-1 lead this playoff DEN: 2-0 in coming back 1-3 deficit this playoff  LET'S SEE WHICH OF THE 2 WILL DOMINATE!
Everyone commenting on Nuggets coming back from 3-1. But let's also not forget that the Lakers are undefeated when up 3-1. Just throwing that out there
OG Rondo keeping Lakers nerves in check. GM 5 every laker should wear number 24 or 8. Go Lakers
MiaHeatvsLakers NBA FINALS
Nuggets went down 3-1 because they wanted a challenge. They will win it in 7! LMAO.
Rondo is a huge player for the Lakers to have
Hol on... rondo got hair
Nuggets up 1 game to 3 on the Lakers.... : D
Man playoff Rondo be dropping dimes faster than USPS expedite. 📬😤😤
I Remember The Dream Match Of 2010-11 NBA Finals Miami and Lakers Lebron And Kobe  That Lakers Didn't Come Into Finals Because Dallas Mavericks Sweep The Lakers RIP Kobe #24
DENVER: Guys Enter Comeback mode! LAKERS: THIS IS NOT A MOVIE 🍿
Without avery bradley, murray been killing every defender thrown to him.    Now lakers missing Bradley's excellent defense and shooting.
The Nuggets got the Lakers to where they want it 3-1.
The Lakers is not yet in OP form now since Bron was still playing with one shoe in this game.
Murray is on a league on his own.
Kyle Kuzma got worked tonight by porter😂💯
Just a reminder they are the LAKERS 😎
WTF is Howard doing? 1:02
Playoff Rondo is inevitable.
LeBron needs to guard Murray all day and ad do the scoring with rondo to take the next game GO LAKERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That boy murry wth
I FUCKING LOVE RONDO
LeBron Ad Rondo Three Headed Dragon
1:43 inbound violation in front of the ref imma a Laker fan by the way
Denver not ready, they play wayyy to scary. I watched Jamal and 3 others wide open for 3 and instead ran to the hoop. They scary and not confident enough they aint got grit they to soft its over
luto...in elish nuggets were cooked.....its lakers team plus tthree ref.vs.nuggets.....NBA is shit...
LAKERS at 5!  Wear the Mamba jersey!
Lakers 😆💪💪💪
Look at MJ teammates  when he won 5 champions..Look at Bron's teammates now..LOL..Come on..
If nuggets won again this time Miami should beat them 4-0 lol hahaha. Or atlest make them won 2 times then beat them.
the only nuggets i love is the ones i eat, 3-1 ya done this is not the jazz or clippers nigga.
Lakers about to show the jazz and flippers how to wrap up the nuggets in game 5.💯
I'm glad the Lakers won but man LeBron gets on my nerves. Everytime the other team score he throws his hands up and bitch.....BRUH JUST PLAY
Lebron guarding Murray is good to close out games Jokic gets hurt when setting screens on Lebron so it helps the game
So for the dummies that keep doubting the Lakers keep sleeping...
But who saw LeBron shit down Murray the last couple minutes? Still the best defender in the league when he wants to be.
In the end, the refs handed to LeBron.
F#@$ THE NBA !!!  Refs gave that game to LA, total shite
No lie they need to put JR on Murray instead of Danny Green. At least we know JR will be rough with him. Green soft as baby shit right now lol smh
Sorry Nuggets fans, I know you’re gonna be triggered by this but LA Lakers are not the bum ass Jazz or Clippers. Bron is closing this out & the Nuggets will wake up to reality. LA has way more experience & Bron has a ton of experience dealing with teams like the Nuggets if not better, throughout his whole career during the playoffs. That’s why he’s so calm & collected. It’s not like he’s seen Curry Klay KD & Green before lol..
That follow up dunk by DWIGHT THO. WHEWW.....
LAKERS at 5!  Wear the Mamba jersey!
Even tho Denver lost Murray is a beast.
The lakers made a big mistake going up 3-1 against the nuggets
Nuggets have the Lakers right were they want 'em....down 3-1
so... its 3-1 again fuck
Heat vs Lakers let’s go
I feel like I just found out that Jamal Murray might be a top 15 player in the league and I’m upset I didn’t see it sooner. This man can fuckin play
This rondo playing like hes only paid in playoffs.
Go Dwight..😊
Nuggets in 7 ✊
Nuggets be like "a sh*t here we go again" 😂😂
3rd gentleman's sweep...
Dwight playing with all his heart, wrestles, fight into position, locking down Jokic.  Dwight turns back the clock and turns back in 2009 Howard.
OMG did Frank Vogul not go over the game plan??? They were supposed to throw so they didn't go up 3-1! c'mon Nuggets in 7 now damnit
J mf Murray hell of a game b
LAL vs Heat?
Lakers: go up 3-1 Nuggets: our strategy is working!
lakers getting lucky here
Nuggets 3-1 mode vs Kobe jerseys
Hug to hug guys .. godbless..
Another 3-1 🤔 Nuggets got another huge huge chance of winning the series😂😂..  If they won the 3 remaining games, they have all the luck in the World.
This is it Nuggets this is what you were waiting for, another 3-1 comeback. Oh wait, Lakers will close this out, bye Nuggets.
the nuggets are on their 3-loss power spike
see you put in rondo and howard and you win ez.
Dwight need more minutes. He needs to be in the 4th quarter to guard jokic and offensive rebounds.
If the lakers played serious in game 3 this could’ve been a sweep
3-1 😳
Nice tnx for sharing this video .,.,
As a fan of neither team, let’s just put some fact out there. AD has been carrying LeBron this series
Series is over don't care what no one says
Porter and grant are great but this is on them. Gotta help jokic more on rebounding. He is alone against la's athletic bigs.
When u play 2k go to career mode and pick playoff Rondo
Oh no......
So much appreciation of Rajon Rondo ❤️
Jokic is a bum. Absolutely garbage
L.A. trice to beat advantage.   It may look absurdly mind blowing to defeat the Lakers trice successive!
All you Chicken Nugget fans with your "comeback kids" BS,  🔐 that 💩 up, Lakers about to close it out next game so we dont have to hear you guys flappin your gums, 💩 is annoying af
Rondo needs to be their third best player for them to win the title.
Jamal Murray is differenttt
Denver: Going 3-1 down  Jazz and Clippers: *Interesting*
Jammal Murray is a big baby. Seriously what is he going to cry about on twitter now?
playoff rondo and Ad straight up carried the lakers tonight
6:34 That rondo fake pass uncle breaker
Man I’m a lakers fan but gah damn that boy Jamal murray can hoop.
Congrats Lakers for win but I suggest to LeBron please don't make multiple THREES ATTEMPT TO MUCH...
its either lakers in 5 or nuggets in 7 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lakers played super well! Almost near perfect 👌🏼
Lakers leading 3-1....Denver has them right where they want them...lol
Hope I don’t play this series I might fuck it up
that layup by Murray though...
Playoffs Rondo brings back memories of that 08 finals😩
AD you play too much bruh. Don’t play like that 😭
This game gave some heart attack moments.
Am I tripping, or was lebron shaking up bd with his teammates? I hope my eyes are deceiving me!🤔
Fuck the Lakers
If that wasn’t a travel at 6:02 idk what is 😆
Davis for Finals MVP
Lebron defending murray in 4th qtr  thumbs up to jamal... Forcin lebron to defend him in 4th cus no can match jamal even rondo.. Only lebron
Jamal was b-b-ballin
4-1
Excellent play by the Nuggets. They now have the Lakers right where they want them😂
Even though they lost Ja thinking like wow I just postered LeBron at 4:06 great highlight of my career
I'm just worried about ad
Nba is rigged we denver fans we want fair n square calls how many times we see lakers have so many calls they push jokic on foul trouble to lose his rythm this is facts
4:06 - Reminds of MJ's reverse layup
less minutes for caruso?
Murray stupid out there. Heat fan just checking in 👌🏿
COME BACK AGAIN                                       . IS IN YOUR DREAM HAHAHA
Good bye Nuggets.
Danny Green = goat
Can I get a large order of Chic Fila nuggets with a side of come back season game 7
Sweet chilli sauce..no game 6.. no question
Murray and Jokic fought hard and really put their team on the map. This dude Murray is crazy fr
The finals might be Boston & Nuggets who knows?🤔
Imagine they comeback 3 in a row in a game 3 In a row
Lakers know what nuggets can do being 3-1 they are going to have some good planning
Are mc nuggets champ r they ?
Here we again 3-1
4:06 was straight out of a NBA  2k moment Murray balling like Curry
6:34 smooth chris paul
Total Free Throws in this series   Lakers:  113 Nuggets: 113   Total fouls CALLED ON THE LAKERS  In this series:  109   Total fouls CALLED ON THE NUGGETS in this series : 97   Technicals on the Lakers: 4 Technicals on Den: 1   Do what you wish with this information before crying about the officials
Charles barkely better not say shit
What a signature move by playoff Rondoooo!!
Okay everyone, all together now...  “ThE nUgGetS hAvE eM rIgHt wHeRe ThEy WaNt Em”
THOSE PERFECT TURN AROUND BY ANTHONY DAVIS ARE LEGIT🔥🔥🔥
Chicken Nuggets 😂😂😂😂🔵🔴🔵🔴🔵🔴🔵
That's it Lakers' are screwed, goodbye championship hopes. Lmao
Lakers leads 3-1. No miracles this time for Denver. This ain't Jazz, this ain't Clippers. They are playing against the Real Team in LA. There is no Pandemic P here 😁
Jamal Murray playing like he's the best Point Guard in the NBA.
Bro 4:08 Murray does the Jordan only it was actually necessary in this case!!! 😯
LAKERS...so strong on fastbreak and  paint ...  Balance team...  Nuggets..always relied on Jokic and murray..pick n roll...
Game 5 on Saturday will be better than any Game 7 this season.
will history repeat itself is the real question we asking
can we talk about playoff rondo's impact  on the game #MadRespect4Rondo
As a player and a fan this is what you want for players stay confident and never fear your opponent... Denver Nuggets players are so confident thats why they are hard to beat
Is anyone else kinda scared for the lakers?
They ain't calling no fouls against Murray for some reason.  I guess he makes it look easy. Those crazy double clutch lay ups were some of the best I've seen in a while. Thats bull though, at very least I saw three in this highlight alone that should have been called. Especially the one at the end of the game.
LeBron James  1st game : 4 FT 2nd game : 4 FT 3rd game : 2 FT Complaints to the NBA about FTs 4th game : 14 FT
Mannnn get the nuggets another guard and that team will be nasty
AD going to work, Kuz balled out, Rondo played his role🔥
Nuggets are BUMS
Murray should join NETS with Kyrie and Durant
3-1     “History repeat itself”.   —— Denver
Blue lives matter
harris missing alot of shots.
Lakers baby! Lets go!
*Lebron James is ONE WIN away from another trip to the NBA Finals, he’s not about to choke a 3-1 Lead.*
Them Nuggets are finger laking good :)
Canada🇨🇦 just needs a few more high calibre players before they can become an olympic threat. (PG)Murray, (SG) Gilgieos Alexander, (SF) Wiggins, (PF) Thompson, (C) Olynyk, Bench: Dillon Brooks, RJ Barret, Brandon Clarke, Dwight Powell and Corey Jospeh. Hopefully Barret can break though as an All Star ! Could use a more dominant front court player though. Oh yeah and Steve Nash as coach of course.
The curse starts right here.
The rescuing that game LeBron James is still whining and crying grown ass man needs to quit acting like a child
LEBRON BLOCK🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️in Murray⚒️⚒️⚒️⚒️⚒️
Murray's shoes though.. 👏👍
Lebron never blew a 3-1 lead
The Nuggets only chance is this 3-1 thing. Lets see if they can still do it with LA's 4-1 thing. 👍😁
Rondo really played well.
Lakers why did you make it a 3-1lead you know whats gonna happen next , they should have give it up to the nuggets in game 4 shit
Why does jokic get a pass by the media on defense he doesn't contest shit in the paint not one block shot defensive rebound or steal
The refs be acting like lebron can't foul, shit lame af
That murray turnover. Tsk.
Lakers in game 5 😤😈
If Jokic doesn't get in foul trouble they win this game. One of the best games ever by Jamal Murray. It's like a career highlight reel in one game. If he didn't complain about not getting a call on Lebron at the end and he was right, he may have made it back to block Rondo which would've changed everything, but I get it. Should be 3-1 Nuggets right now.
My mind says lakers but my heart shouts nuggets.
Malone asked to be down 1-3 again and he got what he asked for.
Refs got a bonus tonight for helping LA.
As a laker fan I am still scared of Jamal murry
PLAYOFF RONDO 💪🏻
HARRIS AND MILSAP PLAYING TOTALLY TRASH THIS SEASON
Off night for The King who’s also fighting racia injustice while chasing his 4th ring 👑 💪🏽 🐐 26-9-8 | 3-1
I rather Lakers make this 2-2. We all know what happens when nuggets are down 3-1,they turn
I'm not celebrating yet
If Lakers do go to the next round, they need to give props to Nuggets for prepping them to go against the Heat. They are going to be as relentless.
5:42 sooo we gone ignore that play??🔥🔥🔥🔥
Come on guys the Nuggets are only down 3-1......
Nice game Lakers. Last one to finish the Western finals. But I think the defence was slappy and need it to be more tighter. James should guard Murray since he's the only one lifting the Nughets
Rondo presense is really big thing for lakers
Here comes the comments that think Lebron really gonna let the Nuggets come back 😂
*Clippers watching the WCF like: We’ll get em Next Years guys!*
Joker, hey guys let's upset a 3-1 lead AGAIN!
Kuzma can't guard porter
Playoff Rondo in the haaaauuz
Now the series begin
Must be tough to lose the game after so many insane offensive highlights
All man 😔😩😔
Basketball is basically soccer now. These calls are pathetic
Can someone say something about that d bron playing?! At least quit with the kawhi and his by far best 2 way player bs
JAMAL MURRAY with the JORDAN move!!! @4:00
3-1 down? Against a team from LA? You know what that means.
Get that murray to all star!
LAKERS GIVING ANSWER WITH COMEBACK TO EVERY CRITIC 🔥🔥🔥
Another 3-1
imagine if nuggets comeback 3~1 deficient again hahaha history
Miami heat ref's all over again..🤔🤔
That letter sure helped! Good for them
I wish I was as invested as I was in the past in these playoffs so that I can take the time to break down the games so I can provide proof of how much the league has a hand in making sure the Lakers win it all. Not for them but for LBJ. Im sure someone else will do it though.
Bugok so jeo promise
Murray blatantly fouled by LeFlop multiple times in dying minutes - LeFLop cries to object to foul calls the whole game  (even when he kneed Murray in the groin) so in the end the ref's were influenced to stop blowing whistle on LeFlop
Lakers were looking for 3rd best player in regular season and bubble. Forgot about Playoff Rondo. This dude is a cold faced assassin wondering his stats if he was playing more than 30 min.
jordan played against plumbers and truck drivers
Here we go again!😅😅😅 Nuggets might go to the finals with that 3-1 deficit lmao
Jeo bubuuuu!
People say nuggets have a chance but remember the lakers have went 4-1 against 2 teams already
Nuggets need to step up their defense
Lakers is a type of team who gives 1 victory and finish a 4-1 lead.  Nuggets is a type of team who can come back from a 3-1 lead.  Man this is an interesting fight.
It was all fun and games until DENVER is down by 3-1
4:07🔥
nuggets down 3-1, Jamal Murray: It’s show time
Okay, well we all know what happens when the series goes to 3-1.
4:19 😱🔥
Reggie Miller rooting against LA🤣
Damn Shannon won the scoring prediction in the end 🤦‍♂️😂
Game 5:  Rondo (play maker), LBJ (atk & def), AD (atk & def), Dwight (rim protector), Green (def & rebound) 4th quarter play
Nagyabng nnmn lebron james...kala nya siya n mqgling...di Sana manlo ng championship yn ubod ng yabang..ssabihin sya pinakamgling na basketball player..kapal mo.di kaprin uubra kanila kobe bryant,wilt frazier,abdhul jabbar,julius erving,bill russell, jerry west larry bird, wilt chamberlain..at Micheal jordan..kahit era mo ngyon di kaprin mqgling...dahil lahat ng kkmpi mo puro hugot...di mo kaya na dalwang superstar lng..let ng reserve player mahuhusay..dahil tkot ka na 2superstar lng...sayoh ngsimula ng gnyan  wa kwenta n manood ng nba dahil Alam n tao sinu na mag champion
Nuggets had 14 more free throws than the Lakers in game 2 and Lakers still won... but the haters are saying that this series is rigged after this game lol. Haters are funny smh💀💀😂😂
@1:12 was so beautiful ;)
Lakers vs heat will be a 7 game series
That 4rt quarter and jamil murray trying to break defence of lebron   Lebronjames: Trying hard kid😆
The curse of the nuggets (3-1)
Hey guys its 3-1.. I think I dont know whats gonna happen.😮😲😧
nc win for lakers
Refs absolutely ass this game
Damn what happened to all these laker haters and Legoat haters well ig there back in their caves
4:04 best move of the game!! 👍👍👍
Rondo is so brilliant.
Lakers: We up 3-1 Nuggets: So, you have chosen death
The story of this game was Lakers 12-6 ORB, with a more than 15+ pts of 2nd chances difference. But tbh this game's foul calls were stupid. Most of them were made after the contact or were totally unnecessary calls because its the PLAYOFFS not to mention the Conference Finals
Atleast nuggets not a allstar team..
The lakers is up 3-1 now.. Nuggets in finals secured.
*Since it's 3-1, now we got a series!!!*
Murray pulled a Miles Morales move on Lebron
good luck lakers for the 2020 nba finals.
Lakers are doomed
just one more win Lakers
They ain't clippers
DENVER GOT ROBBED
Refs gave the lakers this game
Time to rant. Isn't it hilarious how when Lebron who is a superstar complains about his free throws (rightfully so) in the conference finals the haters are so quick to yell rigged? yet when they look at games 1 2 & 3 they have nothing to show for any "rigging". Ironically, they will be the same people to say he's afraid to drive, he's so passive, he cants make his late gam free throws, he runs away from the free-throw line etc. Now here he is. Driving, going to the line, making his free throws. yet what do we do?? We scream rigged at the top of our lungs. FACT: through the first 4 games of the series Lakers and Denver have the same amount of FTA at 113. No one said anything when the Denver nuggets had +14 free throws in game 2 and 3. No one acknowledges the fact that the Lakers took mro3e shots this game, we're better on the defensive sides, dominated the boards, and had fewer turnovers. Yet all we hear is Refs rigged it for the Lakers. The same refs that didn't bother to rig it in games 2 and 3? The same refs who didn't bother to give Clippers the win in round 2 for Western Conference ratings. Okay, I'm done.
Lebron sometimes seems to chase stats at the expense of winning. At least they got bailed out this time.
KCP coming big
Its kinda hard to think Bron won't get his 4th ring this year, who in the east can stop him or AD
My man Dwight went from zero to hero in record time.
Bad move for the lakers dont go 3-1 over nuggets
Nuggets are ass bruh
Referees desperately want lakers to win.
Congratulations Lakers good luck at game 5 ..But I know the Nuggets have won 3-1 deficit .It might be going to be three times so be careful Lakers and good luck...
Ah shit here we go again
Much respect to Lebron played almost the entire 4th quarter and was guarding the best player on the other team down the stretch.  Also Rondo was HUGE in the second half.
lol laker signature 4-1
1 more let’s not be like the slippers
Lakers and Miami in the finals.
Why everyone hate Lebron James?
9:11 that's for Skip Bayless
COACH RONSHOW  RONDO WITH 4sharpshooters and good defense can a LEAD A TEAM for a CHAMPIONSHIP EASY RESPECT ✊ 💪🏽🏀💯
Ref helps the lakers alot. Well played.   Its 3-1 the miracle continues
I'm sorry but those boys going home this time down 3-1 Lakers are not the Clippers
Nuggets go down 3-1 Also nuggets:  "Looks like you've activated my trap card.."
Will History repeat itself.. But the lakers ain't  the Flippers.
LAKERS UP 3-1 Nuggets: So you have chosen death
Jamal Murray should not have to play 45 minutes when he has good teammates but when the second highest amount of points came from Jeremy Grant who only had 17 he has to
Now its a series, denver down 3-1 😂
Lakers: We're up 3-1 😤🔥 Nuggets: You know what time it is 😎
Jamal Murray IS-in the words of Stephen A.- box office! But tonight,  A.D. was goin' in. And The Lakers as a whole: just went for it! If the front office doesn't mess this up: this is only the beginning for Denver--what a team!
The refs cheated the chicken nuggets 😂😂😂 but nawfr they were cheated
we aint utah or clippers
Nuggets in 7
finally lebron lock murray @4th
Murray is the new harden of the FT line
And this is when the nuggets win the next 3 games!!!
LeGoat
Man, refs are helping the lakers
Lakers lead 3-1  (boss music starts playing) (3-1 curse activated)  Jazz&Clippers: oh no.
Lakers should win for Kobe
*Katelyn Faber vs. Kobe Bryant*  Denver in 7
The 35 year old king is stop the mumentom of the younger and good player  murray, damn he is the one that good defence in murray that game,  salute you king lebron
The lakers are not the clippers i guarantee they will not blow a 3-1 lead
176 Dislikes are John Greene and the Bron Haters
That man Murray a problem...I was watching the game and felt his presence on the floor he nice fr🤦🏽‍♂️
Refs were garbage
I'm a lakers fan but fuck Murray is balling...respect to him
Play off rondo is the key for lebron an AD
Damn the referees cheated 2nite maybe they got that phone call
So is this the part where nuggets are like...oh hhh buddy,we got the lakers exactly where we want them.its a wrapped 😆 🤣
We gone whoop they ass and win the series (the Lakers) but can we admire jamal murray's greatness. he is the truth 🔥🔥🔥
Murray out here with more EPSN top 10 plays in one game than the Lakers all series...
The bubble series had been crazy fr.
My heart skipped a beat when AD hurt his ankle. Davis was a flat out beast tonight. Now just 5 more wins to #17🏆
LAKERS TRAP 3-1 vs blazers & rockets or NUGGETS TRAP 1-3 vs jazz & clippers 💪🔥🔥💪
Yokic gotta stop cheating on those jump balls, ain’t no way he’s winning those over Dwight.
playoffs rondo
Me: Bruh its 3-1, Lakers champs Nuggets: Hold my sauce for the 3rd times
Lakers barely won via rebounding. Lebron's shot isn't falling and AD keeps posting up at the 3 point line. Murray and Jokic are going to get theirs, but they can't let guys like Jerami Grant get 17 points.
Murray's probably going to say in the post game interview that the Nuggets should be up 3-1 in this series lol
Lakers up 3-1 when series should be 2-2. Without AD lakers would lose to the Nuggets fosho. Murray 🔥. Refs lead lakers to win 😳
boys we know what's gonna happen next
Murray clearly got fouled on that play. Bad call.
Denver Nuggets 3-1 trap is activated
aight its 3-1, time for the nuggets to start trying
Events repeats twice but not thrice🔥
People still saying they going to game 7 since Denver down 3-1. Remember LeBron said “The close out game is the most intense one.”
Now the series begin
Lol Murray getting payback for disrespecting lakers when they were winning. Now that we have better players, we can get that revenge.
LeBron got the championship in his hands again
1-3 guys
Damn The Refs and the NBA making it to obvious that they want Lakers to win the Championship ... SMH
4:14 watch Dwight he’s on takeover
Two words to strike fear in the hearts of you over confident Laker fans...THREE-ONE
Nuggets just wasted those two heroic comebacks. Jokic is softer than AD, too emotional to compete.
Danny Green and Caruso played over 20 mins and scored less than 7 points combined......Vogel PLZ PLAY  JR, God damn its crazy Caruso plays more minutes than Kuzma and he avg more pts...
Lakers just gave themselves the kiss of death. Going up 3-1 against Denver is the last thing you want in this year's playoffs
tough game 2 teams
How to stop Murray? Let the KING Lebron guard him. Lol
Lebron shot under 40% and still easily better than Jordan. Jordan would be at the bubble casino gambling and getting bounced in the 2nd round like Kawhi did
I think this time no 3-1 comeback. Sorry Nuggets🙁
"I'm a Lakers fan but I don't know man I think the nuggets can really win the championship." Sike, Lakers in 5
4:45 bruh Rondo on Joker lmfao
Nuggets in 7🥱
Nuggets in 7, three 3 to 1 comebacks in one playoffs 😮
How many times did the Lakers go to the free throw line in the 4th QTR? This game is so much BS.
Refs clearly won the game for the Lakers got lebron complaining he aint getting to the foul line enough.  😂😂 lebron and refs are a joke
Alright, it's 3 - 1 again. Let's start the Choke Meter shall we, battle of LA.  Lakers vs Clippers :)
Dwight really bothered Jokic💣
bromance at 9:45
Kaon!
Seems that this is what nuggets want.
Y’all really thought the Nuggets had us, y’all must have thought we were the Clippers. We really dodged a bullet not picking up PG13%
The refs were completely biased again this game - Lebron crying non stop - NEVER seen JORDAN cry like this it is so disturbing to watch this grown ass man cry like a baby...even when he blatantly knees Murray in the groin and because of it the refs stop blowing the whistle in the last few minutes - Murray fouled by Lebron so many times and no call - shame on the NBA
They ask to be 3-1 at the beginning lol but we are not the clips  nor the jazz Let’s go LAkers this one is for kob
as a Nuggets fan, it really hurts 💔
That Murray Kid has a future.
If nuggets will lose this series. They will gonna trade plumlee

I smell sum salt from these nuggets fans
Lakers en 5
The 3-1 blowout curse is waving.
murray is nothing when lebron starts to guard him..😁😁😁
Rondo vision is just special
3-1  or 4-1 wtf!!!! Will see we an’t clippers we r lakernation means thr is no 3-1 tlkshow
Nuggets really beat the clippers just to give us this boring ass series I hate this team even more now ruined the whole  nba season
Damn. Yall better stop chuck from predicting shit yet again. He might jinx the lakers. No shit!
can someone send this to pat bev?
I'm a LeBron fan for life, but Murray balling out. The Nuggets have something special with this team. Clippers blew a shot because next season, the west is going to be stacked. Lakers, Nuggets, Warriors, Blazers, Jazz. It's going to be a rough road.
I think Jamal Murray is better than steph curry overall not shooting
Nugs time to go to worj
Rondo has HOF Dimer Badge
3-1 --------> 3-4
It’s been a good series, but I think the Lakers close them out next game
Who will prevail!!?? Tha LA 4-1playoff trend or the 3-1 Denver upsets lol
9:26 LMAO i thought it Dwight😂
Lebron locking down Murray in the final minutes reminds me of 2011 ECF when he locked D.rose
Murray to lakers...hahahah
I'm a Laker fan  a five decade ago. but man,,Murray is a pain in the ass for the Lakerr Team.. Hat's Off to Jamal😎
ok dis is it..down to 3-1 again...make some history nuggets!!!
Well, it looks like the Nuggets have them where they want them...
Dejavu?
Well lakers also win 4-1 this playoff
Look at Rondo's Shoes. Damn! Gonna get one of those.
When Anthony davis started holding his ankle on the ground almost gave me a heart attack if it was searious it could probably cost lakers the championship
That Murray guy is really good at basketball.
Nuggets in 5
NBA is rigged. TRUTH
Man If Denver ain’t getting torched by 25+ Don’t sleep💯 they sticking with LA and they got some dawgs🍴🏀 this a good ass series #Game7
I love how every one saying nuggets got a chance cuz they are down 3-1 but forgot lakers never went to a game 6 this season so far
There’s no way the Lakers lose 3 more games to these Nuggets
The nuggets ain get this far to choke. They earned it. Murray a beast too
Bandwagon! Im jumping off the Clippers and joining the Lakers. No way Denver could ever come back from 3-1 deficit.
Anthony Davis is on a mission
Now.. let the game begins.
Let's gooo man, I see you Rondo, KCP and Leeeebron. Sub to my Channel, mannnnn
On the cool murry got fouled like 3 times and once in crunch time by lebron since he not looked at as a super star he didn't get that call not saying that would have changed the entire game just saying that lost by 6 would have be 4 if murry got them freethrows
Well looks like jr Smith about to make his 5th finals appearance well earned buddy all those 3s made bro its crazy
Nuggets fans think they can comeback from 3-1 deficit not remembering that Lakers always finish all their series in 5 games
Gs, Okc, Clippers: welcome to the club Lakers: nope
Not gonna happen thou! Not on my WASHED list😎!
Lebron really makes the finals every year💀
LeChoke should thank AD, RONDO, KCP and of course their 6th man(referee) for always winning their  game. Super obvious the NBA officiating sucks in favor always of the Lakers. What's with the Lakers that they cant resist to officiate fairly?
You gotta respect the Denver for playing so well. There's a reason why they're on the conference finals.
Let rondo control the ball not james..
Going for the lakers, there’s nothing more terrifying than them being 3-1 on the nuggets.
Murray can f ing ball man. Dude was making some ridiculous shots. Got nervous every time he had the ball in his hands
Lakers are going to need to play jr smith and Dion waiters against who ever in the finals if they want a chance to win
Bad new Nuggets like 3-1 got um right where we want um lakers like wrong team respect dis NBA playoffs gangsta no cap lol stay safe RIP CB wakanda forever God bless BLM checkout The Main Squeeze🙏
@54 that was Gary Harris only points of the game smh.
No more comeback lakers are not jazz and clippers 😂 lal in 5
Congrats to Nuggets bro for makin in all the way to the finals. Beating the Two LA teams
Lakers need 30+ pts in 1st QTR to win... if they didn't score 30 in 1st QTR they loses.
Look at the effort he took him to pull him up😂😳 AD big man💣 7:18
Lakers be like: we are not flippers😂  Wow so many likes btw this is my first time 😂 thanks
Nuggets trailed all game. If they want to win games they need to get on top early and stay there.
Murray or Steph curry
Guys I’m from the future, Nuggets win in 7.
No one wants to talk about the fact that AD was the best player this game
LEZGOLAKERS!!🏀
The lakers would close the chicken nuggets in game 5
Jordan's Bulls can't beat this Nuggets team.
Respect for Murray, He always surprise me with all the circus shots and buckets he does, what a guy!
Lebron hater this season: Le3-6 Lebron hater next season: Le4-6
The refs again.
It's the coach fault
As a lakers fan, i have high respect to this nuggets team. They're aint a joke. They didn't comback 3-1 twice for no reason. Lakers must take game 5 seriously.
Its so hard as Lakers fan watching these possessions from Lebron hold onto the ball until there's 5 seconds left in the shotclock then chuckin up a stepback. Put some damn pressure on the offense and drive and kick or something
LeBron guarding the best player in the 4th and sunk 2 clutch free throws, wonder what skip will have to say tmrw lmao
Anybody on the Lakers can go off at any time. That’s why they’re difficult to beat. And you have Bron and Rondo sharing the Pg duties. They just rolling over on good teams man. I hope the Heat can give these dudes a 7 game series
It aint 3-1 cause chicken nuggets fans been spouting its actually 2-2 right now.
Lebron: Easy work for my team.  Nuggets: wait it's 3-1 now right? No problem.
someone in the commentator box is really HATING on LeBron James. idk who but his remarks on LeBron is awful.
4:06 like wtf man! Baboy si lebron!
The series starts now for Denver 😄
Lakers: "goes up 3-1" Nuggets: thats all i needed
Danny Green should sit the remainder of the playoffs. Might as well play Caruso or Morris in his spot. What a let down 🤦‍♂️
great game Lakers came in clutch in the 4th especially the refs
*Remember!*   Doc Rivers *purposely* threw that last series, because he had to keep his record of blowing 3-1 leads *once per President* alive.     And, He’ll gladly do it to next year’s president, just to F with his Ex potential Son-in-Law, and completely destroy PG13%’s legacy before they both leave the Clippers.
6:35 look at Jamal Murray legs😂
Game ball goes to Rondo.
Yesss suhhhh
Crucial non call on that play 8:56, there is a replay that shows it more clearly
Man jamal murray is a beast
Jamal Murray. Put some respect on his name🔥🔥 Wow! Simply amazing
Let me guess... Denver should be up 3-1😂😂😂
Win or lose this series, nuggets had a great playoffs this year..... im a jazz fan btw
Damn Jamal Murray with that tough shots. I think he is better than Pandemic P
The Lakers will close the series in game 5.  The nuggets threw their hardest haymaker in game 4 and rattled the Lakers developed a chin.  The nuggets  still can swing they won't go away but the Lakers led most of the game. That means the Lakers have the nuggets frustrated against the ropes.  The bus stops here for the nuggets the comeback kids.
Deja Vu
Lakers need the mamba jersey in game 5 for them to win
Breaking news the nuggets and the heat will meat in the finals
The officiating in the nba + the rules are fucking terribad. trash
@6:09 ...Playoff Rondo? Facts! 😁 Sorry Pandemic P aka George Paul 😭
Are the Nuggets better than the Heat?
JR Smith Chillin’ like imma get another ring, thank you lebron HAHAHAHA
rondo looks weird with his hair haha
I love the Lakers, but it just seems that the refs don’t call fouls fairly in these playoffs. It’s like the NBA wants the lakers to win the championship, anyone else notice that? Like I said, I’m a Lakers fan so I ain’t being biased
And now the conference finals begins!!!
Apart from game 1 this has been a very close series. Nuggets have not been easy beats
BEEN WATCHING BASKETBALL S1NC3 1991 AND MADD RESPECT FOR THAT BOII K.C.P HE LOWKEY CARRYIN THAT LAKERS PRIDE!!!
Bro the refs just want Lakers to win series at this point
Who else ready for the 3-1 comeback😂
arrogant murray that is for you.. takr it back what you had said that you should be 2-1 by now before this game.
Im feeling it. Rondo's going to pull that fake behind the back move 🤞
This Denver Nuggets about to give me a heart attack but since am a diehard fan LEBRON so we don’t die like that unlike the the fake king of LA and the the fake PJ playoffs who were in the driver seat without a license
Rondos hair looks like it’s velcroed to his head. Good game for Rondo tho. I want him to get another ring.
Jamal: Circus layup  Harper:"he is aHEAD on the loss"
since y'all want to cry  Free throw count for the whole series Lakers- 113 Nuggets-113 All fair
Denver is done...
The nuggets have the lakers exactly where they want them
It’s gotten to that huh? Two 15 sec non skippable ads. 🤦🏻
Congrats Denver for making it to the finals. That's the 3rc comeback win already for a history. Lebron blew a 3-1 lead this time. Sorry Lakers.
Another dub for the refs. Man I've been watching a few "NBA is rigged" videos, which is usually from a fan of the losing team, but idk, it just seems so obvious now. Disgusting to watch, some teams have to work twice as hard to get half as far without really having a chance
Game 5 is an elimination game for the lakers
Nice game! Though scarey for LAL caused of Nuggets 1-3 standing.
3-1 again
4:14 howard veteran moves
1:53 wasn't that a travel
Honestly doesn't matter if AD plays in the next game or not, I promise yall Lebron is finishing them in game 5, yall will see the difference between him and Kawhi/PG
Murray making some of these shots like hes Aomine XD
2010's: Hoodie Melo 2020 Finals: Playoff Murray 🤔
Blazers vs Lal 4-1 Houston vs Lal 4-1  Jazz vs Den 4-3 Clippers vs Den 4-3  Lal vs Den 4-1 or Denv vs Lal 4-3 They both have that Scenario so Shirt the f*ck up Saying that your chicken nuggets Can get back at 3-1 series when Lakers even have this kind of scenario and have that 4-1 win series back to back too
come on lakers! show us what you look like game 5!
This ain't clippers😂its over
Murray's last 3pt shot missed...not this time boi!!!!
LeBron James need to step up in the fourth offensively. I don't know why he keeps taking bad shots. The only reason we won today was Dwight Howard, Playoff Rondo and Bron's defence on Murray otherwise we would've lost.
I might need to create an account for the Miami Heat now
Would be still very nice to see Herro vs Murray!!
I told you joker will never win against superman
"Well, you can't come back from a 3-1 lead without going down 3 games first." -Nuggets probably
We all agree that the Lakers gonna make to the final ✊🏾
Lebron and Rondo Clutch Freethrows🔥🔥
Alright Lebron we only need one dominant game from you to close out this series. Rather then 4 times whne you were in cleveland this time we need 1
@NBA YOUR HIGHLIGHTS SUCK WHOEVER DOES THEM FIRE THEM
Losing the battle to win the war 😂😂
Howard looks like he getting younger to or just his lags still young he getting up there dunking alot
Bron packed Jamal ball to another Demintion you gotta pull up stronger than that😂 anyways GO 🏀💪🏾💯
The nuggets got them right where they want them.😂
Nice
3-1 right where they want them
Mamba Mentality all through game 5.
Refs gave this game to the Lakers
Let's Go Lakers...clap clap...clap clap clap
Nuggets wanted to go 1-3 to prove themselves... well, here ya have it. No way they are coming back! I'd eat my Kobe jersey if they did!
fuck these refsss
Mann, i wanted team jokic to win but i know it's impossible right now
The lakers should finish this series next game, or else this will be the same story as the denver comeback from the jazz and clipps
Denver: daje vu
4:05 not a nuggets fan but man.. i've seen this with MJ
Nobody:      Nuggets: We got em right were we want em.
So either the Lakers will lose their first series this year while up 3-1, or the Nuggets will lose their first series this year while DOWN 3-1.
Miami vs lakers in the finals 👀
3-1 but nuggets will get it
The Nuggets have them right where they want them...lol
Here we go again. The real series starts at a 3-1 deficit. Come back kids are about to do the impossible! #GoNuggets
Not going 7 games. Lakers will not lose 2 str8
Bad  calling tonight
Porter Jr. is gonna be something special. He just needs more confidence going to the basket and not settling for jumpshots and threes. Laker fan here.
Lakers on trouble now...
IF the Nuggets win the Ship, would they be the youngest team to win one?
You know it's over when Rondo is snagging boards 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lakers took care of business today got the boards played some d got the win up 3-1
When caruso and jr smith were celebrating....rondo so focus in the game..
4:14 Dwight giving flashbacks
Yeah Nuggets have been coming back from 3-1 series, but the Lakers are the 4-1 Kings.
Dwight Howard play fantastic tonight 💪💪
4:06 Murray is on his MJ sh**.
And there goes the lakers chance of winning 😂😂
Nuggets: Okay  time to turn 100 game slider on.
Stevie Wonder could have officiated this game better...
Everytime lebron scores it looks like he gets younger somehow dude still in his prime seems like
My god. Jamal Murray is fucking balling out there. He can just literally throw the ball and it would still go in but Lakers made a great defense to trap him and force him to pass the ball.
This series could easily be flipped. Lakers got very lucky in game 2 and they really labored in this game. Lebron's age is showing, Murray's been unstoppable, Jokic cancels AD's impact, and Nuggets support cast has been very solid. But it was Rondo and Dwight's energy that got the Lakers over the hump in this game. Any other series it's basically over, but given this Denver team seems foolish to bet against while down 3-1.
Where are all your lakers haters and the lebron haters at now
Awwhh.. when i saw bron and smith shaking hands and body bump! Im so happy! To see that. And i go back to that part 5x..
Michael porter jr is really showing what he can do out there he looks like a good fit for the blazers he can create a shot he can spot up and he can defend and finish that’s someone u want
Kyle Kuzma is trash...would definitely trade him for a bag of Spaulding balls
Nuggets: No worries we’ve been with this situation before down 1-3.  Lebron and Co.: We are not the CLAPPERS.
Playoff Rondo
Smith looks like he has a new role, lebron's hype man
There not alot good teans this year in NBA lakers are good win chip bit there not looking that good
Stop crying chicken nuggets bandwagon fans , the game is over Lakers win OK 😎
9:00 is my Favorite !! LBJ Blocked that kid LMAO
Like in Spartacus... Nuggets: Shall I begin?
Howard Superman 💕
Don’t know if the refs can stop the nuggets when they’re down 3-1
Murray the best PG in the league rn. He’s havin one of the greatest playoff runs we’ve ever seen. Hopefully LA can close em out
Lakers: "how about another joke murray..." 😂😂😂
I'd leak the whole video if I were Jamal murrays girlfriend.
Nuggets fans saying refs ... meanwhile   Nuggets FTA : 113 Lakers FTA : 113     But go off
King 👑
Jamal girl just needa suck all the Nuggets for this Finals W
For the idiots who call Dwight soft. Look at 4:13 near the rim what he does to a 6'9 220 grown man. He's been doing that his entire career.
If Denver wins game 5 it’s over.!!
0:21 did that even go in?
3-1 is the best way to win a championship
Anyone else heart stop when AD went down
Jamal bout to pull a KD and join lakers next
Playoff Rondoooo! For MVP
One guy at my work is a big Lakers fan. Another is a big Nuggets fan. Im looking forward to the conversation at work tomorrow. How do you kids say it, facts? Facts 👍
This game changed when Bron decided to check Jamal Murray!! That sealed it!!!
Thank you ref for going that game to the Lakers don't worry the Miami heat going win the NBA finals CHAMPIONS 😂🤣😂🤣😂🏆
Imagine if the Celtics and the Nuggets come back down 3-1.
I would love to see the Lakers win the finals this year (bc of Kobe, Dwight, AD, etc.) but it seems like they’re cheating with those calls. Not fun. I wish either the Heat or Celtics will beat the Lakers🤷‍♂️. Respect for the Nuggets❤️💪
Nuggets wining in 7 they have done it 2 times
Will look into murray contract. How many years till he’s a free agent
Murray making difficult shots just like Mitchell back when they were against okc in the playoffs
Lakers will be showing the LA CHOKERS how to close out a 3-1 lead
Lakers....don’t you know? This is the last team you wanna go up 3-1 against. Make sure Murray doesn’t see the court for game 5.
refs in 5
By the first highlight after tip off Paul Milsap already had 2 fouls and went to the bench.
And now the real series starts lol
Dwight Howard is back💪💪💪🦾
Rigged asf who’s paying the refs bruh, they gave lakers the game
Just waiting for flight reaction
goddam no not again the 3-1 lead
Murray really play well. Applaud 💙💙
Lebrons 14-0 record being up 3-1 Nuggets 1-3 comeback streak Only one can live
Rondo is becoming that 3rd option.
Lakers fan, and have been for life but refs deff make it seem like they helping . We don’t need ya help
Close game in 4th quarter Denver didn't lose in turn over they lose in fouls
Congrats Lakers 💛💜
Who else hates Jamal Murray! He’s so fuckin annoying!
That shit over they going to wear the black mamba Jersey
It's either Lakers in 5 or Nuggets in 7 in this series
You guys have so much expectation to Denver going to finals . If they can, they won't let lakers take that series lead, Lakers is far different from what denver defeated with comeback wins .
We def aren’t the Lakers with Kwame Brown to blow a 3-1 lead in the playoffs 🤣🤣🤣
A sensational finish from Murray. Now I'm anxious that the Lakers hold a 3-1 lead tho.
34 to 23 in free throws. The whining worked
Nuggets: We will comeback, just watch   Lakers: We ain't Clippers, we ain't choking like em
Through 4 games  Lakers: 113 fta Nuggets: 113 fta  But yea its rigged?
Hoping to get likes for a non game related comment because I’m quite early 😂
6:36 classic rondo
Great effort by the Nuggets.......but they came up short.......it's win or go home now
Jamal Murray was possessed by Michael Jordan on that layup!
Murray is beast
Not a Denver fan but if Denver comeback Lakers this series I'mma lose my mind
Give respect to Murray! But Lakers one win away from finals!! Just gotta keep stepping on the pedal until the finish line and let’s finish it in 5!
AD legit forgot how to grab rebounds in the first half. Glad he pick it up in the second half tho.
I just can’t believe how garbage Danny Green is
Can’t wait till Lakers close this out on Saturday so we can stop seeing these pathetic Denver bandwagon fangs comment about being good. Good season but y’all will never win a championship ever... call the owner and tell them to relocate to a city that matters.  They had a miracle run this bubble and it won’t happen again next season.
Why he do Bron like that tho that lay up was clean jordan like 1🤙🏾😤 Murray better be on the top plays at least 3 times idc
Lakers 3-1 Nuggets: Let's do it again LeBron: Really nigga?
You nugget fans are sounding like clowns. I know we fans but for real ,cmon man. Y’all talking more about those fouls then the turnovers and hero ball that lost you the game
Lakers - Miami Finals😳
Lebron sweting ocean when he saw AD in pain
Must be nice to have the refs wearing purple and gold too
WOW! 35 FTA for the Lakers to just 23 for the Nuggets. Lakers win by 6. Could have been a different game... I guess crying to the Refs ("we want more free throws...") helps win championships...
Its hard to score against nuggets than rockets
Green and Koz are trash. Rondo is more clutch than Lebron. Murray is beautiful to watch.
Lakers: *takes a 3-1 lead* Nuggets: you've activated my trap card
I know the reffing wasnt good that game but thats doesnt just make it rigged free throws can be lopsided and this time it was lopsided into the Lakers favor
RONDO WON THAT GAME
Need to give props to goat James for taking Murray in the 4th on defense AND hitting BOTH his clutch fts
3-1, let’s see how next game goes😭
I’m not saying the nuggets can’t comeback down 3 to 1 but I am saying that the percentages catch up to you eventually!
Board team gets wins
The reverse was nasty by Maurray
The biggest mistake of lakers is losing game 3 and winning game 4. This will cost them the series.
some of these shots are crazy good
I swear I shit my pants when I saw AD fall and hold onto his ankle like that.
Nuggets fans up 3-1 IN THERE DREAMS
Game is on now...Nuggets1-3 Lakers
IT WAS FUN AND INTERESTING WHILE IT LASTED TOO MUCH LAKE SHOW!! 3-1 IT'S A AMAZON, UPS AND FEDEX WRAP!!
Command code 3-1 entered. Nugget will go Final !
LeBron Finally Shut down Murray
I grant that AD and LeBron can and should stand still on the peremiter but the other guys should be setting screens for each other to give danny, KCP, Caruso, and markieef space for the 3 and the bigs should in turn be cutting to the basket ALL night...this will give LeBron and AD options and lighten the load they carry the Lakers are actually deep enough to keep fresh legs around AD and LeBron all game so I don't understand why they don't utilize the other guys ability and just rely on draining Lebrow's energy so that their fatigued in the fourth.... The other guys have to just shoot their shot when they catch the pass after the defense sags off to help on lebron and AD. If the shooters on the Lakers would just shoot with some MILLION DOLLAR CONVICTION then L.A could 4-1  the heat.but no LeBron and AD do all this dribbling and expend all this effort getting the defense to follow them just for Danny, KCP, and Carushow to brick a 3 after only having been standing still in ONE spot🗣️🤬🤷‍♂️
For *Normal Nba teams* this would be bad, to be 3-1 down in a series...  *But the Nuggets aren’t normal now are they.....*
2:24 - 2:27 Lebron gets PISSED 😡 about Bald Eagle not helping Rondo crowd out which results in giving up free 2 points off a free throw rebound.   This is the type of sloppy play inexperienced players display which can cost you games in the post season.   LBJ punches the bass and sets Baldy Carrushow straight.
KCP and Danny Green need less minutes holy shit they are horrible, but then again who are they gonna get replaced by? Even worse players?
Goodbye Lakers 👋 You know what means being down 3-1 for Nuggets 😝
Nuggets fans be like: *Oh yeah, It's all coming together*
Any superstar free agent would want to join the nuggets in the offseason
Lakers needed to lose this one now they are 3-1 lol
Good game. Laker's maintain the lead that's you play playoff basketball everybody hitting shot's that bull Murray is a problem salute to him
Down 3-1 against la again but not clippers
This is all part of Denver’s plan
Playoff Rondo's pass fake at the free throw line in the 4th Quarter was absolutely jaw dropping.
Never count the nuggets out. Down 3-1 once again. Been there done that. I won't be surprised if the nuggets win 3 straight games.  Will the lakers close them out or will the nuggets bounce back once again?
All the great game by Jamal Murray he only got 32 points. Lakers in 5.
here we go again down by 3-1 denver in game 7 GUARANTEED!!!
They want Lakers 4 the rating hmf
LeBelt still finna whoop LBJJ's ass
Nuggets need 3-1
Lets see how AD's ankle informs game 5.
Lakers held the lead throughout this game and that’s the edge they have unlike other teams. Meanwhile Murray continues being All-Star in the Nuggets squad. Go Lakers!
Refs lowkey tryna bail the Lakers out for Kobe's legacy. Sorry Denver fans, you cannot win a series with refs against y'all.
Shannon was right on the money...Lakers win by 6
The nuggets got the Lakers exactly where they wanted 3-1.
These Denver fans don't know if they are scared or happy about being down 3-1😂😂 You're not coming back this time, lakers in 5😂
Lakers win to get 3-1 lead  Nuggets: So you have chosen death!
NBA is rigged bullshit. Really want the lakers to win for Kobe huh
4:04 oh my goodness!!!
It appears the nuggets are down 3-1 again
Lakers must win for GAME 5
Where is javale at tho?? 😂😂
always a lucky shot for murray
Gumana na nman ang larong walo lima hahaha
1:53 thats a fcking travel murray!!
"Uh OHh dENveRs dOwn 3-1 u KnO wHAt tHaT mEans"  Dont start that shit cuz its not happenin its o-v-a
G1: Lakers 27/37 FT, Nuggets 23/28 FT G2: Lakers 18/19 FT, Nuggets 25/33 FT G3: Lakers 14/22 FT, Nuggets 23/29 G4: Lakers 28/35 FT, Nuggets 20/23  For those people that's complaining about the refs helping the lakers. HAHAHAHA
DENVER NUGGETS REALIZE THAT THEY CAN'T WIN THIS SERIES, THE SIZE, THE DEFENSE, THE LENGTH OF THE LAKER'S,  THIS SERIES IS OFFICIALLY OVER DENVER NUGGETS REALIZE THAT. BUT TRUST ME DENVER NUGGETS KEEP THIS TEAM TOGETHER AND THEY WILL WIN A NBA CHAMPIONSHIP NO DOUBT. 3-1 IT'S NOT HAPPENING, THEY WON'T WIN 3 STRAIGHT OVER THE LAKER'S
Had to stop and replay Murrays layup on James and circus shot
I think it was a good win nuggets are a Damm good team good game ad and Bron and rondo and kcp and nice defense lebron james
Terrible sportsmanship from the Lakers bench when the Nuggets are at the line
Markieff Morris is Ass!!!! 6 fouls and 2 points in 17 mins omg bench him
Every basketball analyst after game 3: Denver could easily be 2-1 now. Yeah, if they actually won games 1 and 2 🤣🤣
Murray top ten player
Lol silly NBA. Y'all messed up the title it's supposed to be "NBA Referees vs Denver Nuggets"
Reduce kuzma time....😁
It's official. The Denver Nuggets are advance to the Nba Finals☝️😎😎💙
Lakers in 5, we not like the fucked up Clippers!
lakers only won because they have more points than the nuggets
Joker was to quite in this game
Freaking refs bro!!! Call 5-6 fouls in lakers favor while not calling any fouls for nuggets(Jamal Murray). Common man. (Not a fan of any of the teams left in the playoff)
Playoff rondo😯
Is no one gonna talk about Howard’s performance
dwights energy was UNMATCHED tonight
Without AD this is not a playoff team
All the calls went towards the Lakers down the stretch and that's what won them the game. 35 FTS to 23, there's absolutely no way the league isn't making sure the Lakers win the title for Kobe. That's the only way they profit at all from the covid season.
🤞🏼
Here we go again with the fans. smh!
We got them right where we want them
nuggets in 7
Lakers r in trouble .they r up 3-1 against the nuggets
Lakers haters just remembered Kobe at the age of 41.              Portland Trailblazer  4 -1            Houston Rockets.  4 - 1.           CHICKEN Nuggets  4 - 1
The only  way lakers will loose is a day when AD don't play well
Jamal Murray Layup Package is fire.
Everybody knows 3 - 1 is nuggets  comeback time!!!  But King LeBron has never lost when up 3 - 1!
Wish Dwight Howard played like that when he was with Kobe....🙊
Refs+Lakers against nuggets smh
The Lakers take 12 more free throws than the Nuggets. Yikes. I really do hate NBA narrative pushing.
I’m not gonna cap but Jamal Murray really balling out in the playoffs right now
Nuggets vs heat 😉
la lakers vs miami heat in nba finals!lakers did a good job starting howard,give respect to murray and jokic duo!
So the Lakers fell for Denver's 3-1 trap...
Wow what a surprise LeBron James 14 free throws. All you have to do is complain to the league. Winning is easy. WWE Basketball league
(Lakers leads the series 3-1) Nuggets: Here we go again
Murray playing like Kyrie with all those circus shot.
https://youtu.be/D1CStARz6Z4
Hindi pa talaga binibigay ng Lakers ang 100% nila sa game nato. Maaring naka reserba talaga ito sa finals!
Murray after loosing tonight: "We feel like we should be up 3-1 right now, to be honest" :d
do the nugget rainbow ride comeback
Rebound the ball
Nuggets not coming back on this one, they played right into the Lakers pace, hard to make runs when you're opponent is slowing the game down.
Murray a jelly fam?
Filipino  Natalo ng Los Angeles Lakers ang Denver Nuggets, 114-108, upang manguna sa 3-1 series. Sina Anthony Davis (34 PTS, 5 REB) at LeBron James (26 PTS, 9 REB, 8 AST) ay pinagsama para sa 60 Ang PTS para sa Lakers, habang si Jamal Murray ay umabot sa 32 PTS at 8 AST para kay Denver.
Lake show💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
The Nuggets have already made a crazy play off history by coming back and winning from 3-1 twice. By the laws of probability alone, they can't win this series.
Series end in next game
Maybe good ol James dominating the paint is now extinct..  I think Davis is now the face of lakers?
how good is jamal murray...damn, dude can Ball!!!
Refs blew 2:2 away.
How about a magic trick? 3-1 Nuggets in 7
No one tell me nothing Lebron is a goat 🐐
magpapaputol ako ng itits pag na comeback nila to
This series is more intense than the Trailblazers and Rockets. J Murray has showned up what his capable of. But Lakers will win this series
baligya lawas wanpepti lang 😂
lakers are 14-0 when leading after 4th quarter..🤔🤔🤔
ahahahahaha Whadafak .....
THE NBA IS RIGGED SO THAT BIG MARKET TEAMS WIN, END OF DISCUSSION
Sorry clippers, we know you were watching and hoping the Lakers would fall like you did, but your sorry asses are disappointed again...Pajama George and the claw can't drive in our lane
Jamal Murray = James Harden 2.00 version
Lakers are easily NBA Champs this season
Dwight coming big, banging down low.AD and Lebron need to drive and put Jokic in foul trouble like today and game 1.
am sure d nbamemes .will remind that 3-1 again .
Denver literaly has ZERO defense
Colby covington somewhere mad asf rn looool
is the Denver nuggets  coming back 3-1 again
I like how everyone are assuming the Denver is gonna win against the #1 seed in the West with a series 3-1 like hell they're not flippers LMAO they're against a freaking playoff veterans. Rondo Lebron Howard and Davis. Do you really think they had a chance against them> Y'all dreaming hard lmao
Shit over 😂😉
https://youtu.be/S7yy2zKsoAY
Danny Green always trash
How is nobody talking about Markieff Morris weak ass!!! Dude had 2 points and 6 fouls played 17 mins smh
MPJ WITH THE HARDEN STEPBACC 😭😭😭😭😭
imagine when they give the finals mvp to LJ instead of AD.
https://youtu.be/S7yy2zKsoAY
Denver Locker Room So it’s 3-1? Hold my bear bruh
LeQuit has stooped to a new low in his whining game.......he actually wrote a letter to the league asking for more foul calls, gets the foul calls and still runs around whining and flapping his arms.  Then goes down to the other end and hammers Murray, of course no foul..........what a tool...........
I’m still going with the lakers💛💜
Playoff Murray > Playoff Pandemic P
My man Jamal Murray in 7
They need to keep the big man in the game
well cooked!!! hahaha
Lakers destroy rockets and portland in 3-1 series,,and baby nuggets got comeback at 3-1 series,, got a watch game 5 it will be crazy performance from both teams,
What's not seen in the highlights are  1. Jokic was saddled with 5 fouls and was in and out of crunch time ti avoid getting attacked 2. James locked down Murray in tje final minutes 3. Rondo made winning plays, mostly on 50/50 balls 4. Murray was his usual 4th quarter beast mode performance but some were negated by the defense down the stretch 5. Howard was annoyingly good as a starter against Jokic     You're welcome
Murray's shoes fit his game, they look like a green shot meter off 2k
Nuggets are going out of business Lol!!!! Let's go LAKERS
I was hoping the Lakers lose this game 2-2. Avoid being up 3-1, thats when the Nuggets are dangerous. Just ask Kawhi and PG13%. Either way Lakers finish it on Saturday game 5.
Murray gave bron the ultimate sloppy  toppy jordi spin lay
9:44 an 9:49 um bron, when you start banging?😂😂
Anthony Davis is obviously the Lakers go to guy averaging 30+ points in the playoffs.  Hitting big shots.  Yet somehow the delusional “king” calls himself the GOAT?  Imagine Michael Jordan having a guy on his team scoring 30+ and more points per game than him!!   Hahahahaha.  Holy sh*!
Sorry Denver warriors
Lebron fans.Why is your guy complaining for a foul everytime he gets to the rim without somebody even touching him?
The series has just begun lol.....nuggets in 9!
Murray has given the Lakers a better fight than Dame and Harden 🤣
Murray a thousand times better than Lonzo by mass Ball
Still rigged.
Kudos to Lebron stopping Murray in the last 5 minutes of the game. Last time this happened Iverson broke Jordan's ankles😳
Lakers chewing on them Chicken Nuggets. Lakers in 5 *yawn
Lakers really put Denver on this spot.. 3-1. Damn
Lakers not the clippers or the Jazz. The nuggets might get one more game but the lakers will be in the finals. And if lebron plays the heat they will win in 6 for Kobe 🤷🏽‍♂️
did you see that Jordan move at 4:05 on lebron
The nuggets have the Lakers just where they want them down 3 games to 1
AD: I like ranch with my nuggets.
It’s either nuggets in 7 or lakers in 5, if lakers loose next game they goin to loose the series watch lmao
Jamal Murray reminds me a lot of Montae Ellis for some reason in terms of playstyle
Lakers mystery player is just so overpowered!!! No way Nuggets coming back from a 1-3 HAHAHAHAHA!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zif-cBAOBFE
I miss XimoPierto 😭
Next Season jokic must work on his agility, he is being abuse deffensively, hi is a deffensively liability
I can't wait till Lebron say, "KOBE!, This is FOR YOU!"
If you see this you will be rich someday
Lakers gonna win the Championship this year! 💪😎👊
Hahahahahahahaha L
What’s crazy is whenever lakers are 3-1 in they playoffs they win game 5, and another crazy thing is in the playoffs is Denver comes back 3-1. Game Five abouta go crazy
Lot of people here are just Denver state warriors fans of Stephen Murray 😂
Lets act like lebron didn’t get on murray after that he didn’t score
I hope the Lake show don't blow that 3-1 lead like we did back in 2016.
A random guy off the side of the road could of reffed this game better that was so bad the refs love LeBron way to much.
Lakers beat all the teams with a do or die situation  Portland vs nets advance or go home Rockets vs thunder Game 7 Clippers vs Nuggets Game 7
Bruh the lakers shoulda lost this one. They just gave the biggest the green light to activate the down 3-1 version of themselves
Nuggets 3-1 comeback activated
it will be Lakers vs Heat The Finals or Celtics vs Nuggets?
Murray after game4 : It should have been 2-2
Playoff Rondo is real
Lakers vs miami nba finals
jamal murray is playing like prime steph curry.
09:02 That fake!
Chicken nuggets.. Still murray's still disbelief that they are down 2-1.. Shut ur mouth murray you ain't gonna win this. Now you are down 3-1 and we'll make it 4-1 murray you son of a bitch.
This shit over 😂
Ok 3-1 , Now lets talk about people talking about the possible comeback of nuggets , come on people Lakers ain't clipper or Jazz and LeBron ain't kawhi hahahaha you think LeBron James gonna let this happen? Hahaha y'all joke
Murray & jokic will indefinitely be offered max contracts in the near future.
This is the only series where I don't even care who wins in the end. Both teams are playing with their hearts and that's why I watch NBA
Hate to say it. But the refs cheated the nuggets. 2 outlandish bogus calls and 1 no call that the commentators couldn't even ignore to stop a serious run from the nuggets. Sad to watch games like this and I'm not rooting for either team over the other
Trust me lebron not gonna blow a 3-1 lead trust me
One more to go💥💥💥💥💥💥💚💜💛💜💛💜💛💜Congratulations 👏 💖 Lakers
6:35 classical playoff Rondo 💪
Oh no.....its 3-1... Y did the Lakers let this happen?
Lol being up 3-1 against Nuggets isn't a good sign 😂😂
Refs being the six player on the floor lol.
These chicken nuggets just don't know when to quit.
It all boils down to the battle of 3-1s.. One being up and the other one down.
lakers might lose the series because of the 3-1 nuggets and they got cursed by Barkley saying lakers are guaranteed to win the series
I’m a laker but the refs lost it for the nuggets.
Damn 35 free throws for the lakers. Lmao talk about wanting the Lakers in the FINALS. 😂😂
The Lakers in trouble the are leading 3 to 1 😁😁😁
Damn referre
Bron was hacking tf out of Murray every time he drove to the rim lmao
Bad officiating tonight especially in the end, all the calls went the Lakers favor
Lakers need those mamba Jerseys for game 5
Cooking show,so many uncall foul ,
2:24 bronny finna get it when lebron gets home
Danny Green please remove every tattoo you have related to shooting such as Bullseye, Deadshot, and the target on your elbow 😂 all jokes aside he needs to pick it up or LeGM moving him out of LA
The NBA really is a fucking joke huh.  Lebron and company whined and bitched and complained to literally everyone about "Oh I need my free throws every call has to go my way!" The nuggets were the better team tonight better FG% and 3P% but those fouls and free throws...12 more FT attempts AND Jokic was in constant foul trouble. We all know damn well that if this were any other person whining like this they would've been told to shut up, but not him. So congrats on another easy series win can't wait to see what bullshit goes your way next round
Lakers: *wins  Nuggets: You fools, you activated my 3-1 deficit team power booster omega 2 times comeback 5s Max R  Murray: yeah and also my gf's gawk gawk lickity suckity 3000 underscoop super max
its all part of the plan
Nice job lakers they use howard for now as first center nice win
nice try Denver 😊
They need to trade Kuzma for a bag of chips... Just in case Lebron get hungry on the bench
Its a cooking show ,
Good fight Nuggets,But y’all run ends in game 5.See y’all there..pack your stuff..#Lakersnation
4:04 that was sick
REF’s are the real MVP here. Can you imagine nuggets have 12 more fouls than lakers.  3.. 2.. 1.. Here they come..
Jamal Murray proved himself idc he showed out all playoffs, his energy gonna be missed in the playoffs
Bron guarded Murray down the stretch. RESPECT
This isn’t the Clippers GAME SET AND MATCH
That’s as far the Nuggets will get because Lakers are not Clippers💪🏻🏀
Lakers: we’re up 3-1 no worries. Jazz: 3-1, been there done that no worries.
Lecarries
- if bron didn't deliver and somebody did a great job "lebron got carried" - if lebron led his team to W "lakers have the refs"  yeah whatever man
One more Lakers!!🏆🙂🙏
These Lakers dont look like Championship Lakers.
Lakers: wins Game 4    Denver: Were ready for a comeback
Game 5: Lakers need to come out there like it's game 7, cuz Nuggets will! Props to the nuggets, what a tough team to beat but #Lakersin5
Nice Lakers Dwight Howard is a nice starter
People keep saying the refs were on the Lakers side. Even if that’s true it’s only fair considering the bullshit calls last game
james,davis, howard ano hyt nyo Katamad panuorin manong gang brigade lakers nilamon lang ng buhay ni Murray Kahiya nmn
Lakers: *Up 3-1*  Nuggets: *It’d be a shame if something happened to that lead* 😈
Denver was really robbed from alot of calls no lie man smh
That shit was scripted leflop hella fouled Murray on that layup.
oh no! Lakers will lose these series up 3-1 T_T. joke!
So no one wants to talk about lebron very clutch free throws smh
Murray with that jelly shit was tough
3-1 Nuggets vs 3-1 Lakers. Game 5 is about to be epic.
Are Nuggets fans really thinking being down 3-1 is a good thing? You guys will twist anything to believe the Nuggets will advance. The Lakers ain’t the Jazz or Clippers. It’s over, Lakers in 5
Seriously, it is 1-3 again...
Lebron will watch for Murray in this series. It will be a battle on Game 5 for sure!
Ref's played really like a team tonight, well deserved win. Go Ref's.
When you realize the nuggets are 2-0 in game 5
DEVNER: JUST where we want them 3-1 sure win.
Butler and James final
The NBA doesn’t even try to hide how rigged it is  LeBron James Free Throw Attempts:  Game 1: 4 Game 2: 4 Game 3: 2 *cries to league office for more calls* Game 4: 14
Nuggets are down 3-1. They could gain a lot of confidence being down 3-1.
Jamal Murray my point guard over Russell Westbrook all day 💯
Aye, refs tried to give Denver the game and we still won. Denver should be heading home right now
U guys that lazy. Change the thumbnail
Denver and Boston about to pullout the impossible. Watch out
Need 5 wins to 17 ring for the Lakers....💜💛
Lakers 3-1 series lead Nuggets: “CHECKMATE”
They were both good when playing 3-1..but the difference will be wearing of Black Mamba Jersey in Game 5..🤣🤣🤣
Pretty Sure The Nuggets Can Never Do That To Lakers From 3-1 Deficit Like They Did To Clippers. One Win Away LAKERS..
Dwight is like a bubblegum that dont want to leave Jokic alone lol
Nuggets are a difficult team to beat... had me on my seat :)
4:07, 6:03, 7:07, 7:34, 7:48, HIGHLIGHTS BABY 🔥
Lakers in 5
Next Season Jamal Murray Needs To Join Steph Curry Klay Thompson In Golden State
I will talk about how bad I’m disappointed in LeBron James complaining about everything but I’m more excited that I seen the most magnificent basketball move in my life but of course I’ve seen Michael Jordan do dat amazing two hand 🖐 🤚 switch with his tongue out if only  Jamall Murray had his tongue out he would’ve emulated the REAL GOAT 🐐.. instead of playing with just A OLD GOAT 🐐 “lj “
Lakers up 3-1.  Nuggets, you know the drill! 😝
Bugok ibahin nyo Lakers
3-1 The Nuggets have them right where they want them....
We got the Lakers where we wanted! 3:1! now it's our chance to strike back!
Tingnan natin kung kaya pa makabalik ng nuggets sa 3-1 deficit sa series na to hehe..
Denver need to stop fouling
Both teams played really well till last 20 seconds, but having experience on the floor like the  👑  LBJ and Rondo with super shoter AD, and Dwight makes this team really consistent.  Otherwise, they could   outscored us. We must play as serious as this game till last seconds for the rest of games and finals!
Just like what i predicted, the Nuggets intentionally lost this one. Now they have activated their 100% winrate when down 3-1 that is a bug that they have been abusing.
So anyone thinking it ain’t rigged is stupid !! I love lakers but China trying to make sure lebron wins for being a SJW !!! I’m done lakers I should have retired when Kobe left.. refs are paid it’s too obvious.. patriots ,astros ,rams and now lakers !!! I’m good on another boxing league!
Lebron: doesn’t get calls  Lakers: hey look at the film he should get more calls   Lebron: gets more calls   Fans: rigged.
*Nuggets Sucks*
*Lakers*     -   Lead 3-1 *Nuggets*  -  "So you fell right into our trap" 😈  Bron and Brow combined for 60 pts! Let's go Lakers! Do it for Kobe!
3-1 ??? Injured AD ???  *EMERGENCY MEETING*
Lakers:   3-1 Denver:  ain’t gonna do shit
Why does it feels like win or go home for LA at Game 5
Mpj with the double step back to beat the buzzer!!!
The nuggets can’t come back 3-1 this time, Lebron wouldn’t allow it and y’all know this
The Lakers will be good for only 2 or 3 years left. The Nuggets will be good for the next 10 to 15 years.
Rondo wearing a wig
Im a laker fan But murray wow just wow That finish on lbj is so fantastic . I respect that guy bec.he give hes best every time he plays.
So far I have not seen an AD carried LeBron comment...Love to see it. Cry you salty haters 🖕🏻
Thank you and God bless
LBJ wasn't having it with jamal 😂
Refs help lakers to win 😂😂😂
All those free throws for the lakers though hmm..... 🤔🤔🤔
Bruh I’m not even a nuggets fan but the lakers had so many fouls uncalled... refs carried them
Lord have mercy this boy Murray is ballin ballin I can't FUCKING believe this.   Wow. Just...fucking wow.   Haven't paid for an NBA Game since '14 but goddamn this was some video game shit fr fr......
Ah 3-1, exactly what the nuggets wanted.
Bruh
Jammal Murray is simply showcasing why he is a SUPERSTAR in the making. Man is hella dangerous 😤🔥
Can someone please tell me why is Danny Green still playing? 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ moer'fucker supposed to be a 3 point shooter but can't even score
Imagine being called “Lakers” in Los Angeles
This the wrong LA team to go down 3-1 on
Flight be like: PCP dude is not that nice ,  Rondo can’t shoot a three he’s not like that. Nobody player, Porter William  Michael of Jr is so lucky.”
Thanks to Rondo you have this championship in your hands  James!!!!
They scored 60 points and barely won they should just let Adam silver run point
Nugget fans: Mwuahhahaha it’s all going to plan Mwuahahahhaha
Rip nuggets
HELL YAAAAH WE GOIN TO THE FINALS BABBBYYYY
men Murray is monster
Lakers doing it for Kobe 👏
Shanon called it earlier today. Lakers win by 6.
1:44 Lmao A.D.
The Denver Nuggets have officially made it to the NBA Finals....
Play at 02:22 , why lebron all mad? He the one that never plays defense smh
To be honest besides game 1 the nuggets been right there at the end every game if they keep this core together they gonna win a ring!!!
The fact that the lakers had to cry to the nba board  just to get foul calls for Lebron is biased asf its rigged asf
MPJ should have been playing in the game for Millsap late in the game
If nuggets come back 3-1 again... lebron better retire.
Oh no the lakers in trouble
rEfS RiGged tHE GaMe   Im so tired of this refs rigging shit honestly you should stop watching baskteball years ago if you still on that shit every year refs is just controversial and inconsistent in bigtime games. so for everyone who's still refs rigging shit should stfu
Dwight Howard was the X-factor for Lakers win.
I'm not used to seeing LeBron play wearing long shorts this year. Felt weird. 😅
At 2:24 you see how angry LeBron is imagine what he’s going to do to Bronny 😳
Nuggets down 1-3. It's over for the Lakers
Now the Lakers should not do what jazz & clippers did. Or should they
and don't forget the 3-1 curse of Denver ^_^ ahahahahaha
Everyone gangsta about the 3-1 jokes until the games end them in 5.
Most improved player=KCP
Free Throw Attempts through 4 games! Lakers - 113 Nuggets - 113  LeBron James Free Throw Attempts:  Game 1: 4 Game 2: 4 Game 3: 2 Game 4: 14
AD and Bron is the best dou this Season, AD could be top 10 or 20 in the list and Lebron deserves the top 5!!!!
you should blame Denver offense not the referees because if there offense  is better and there defense is better to probably they will win but The defense and offense of the lakers are doing Great Nuggets choke
We all know it ain’t over yet
Nuggets might have a chance since they’re 3-1!
Ohhh. . . be careful with that 3-1 lead, Lakers 🤣 It would be funny if this went to game 7, ngl. Just to give them a scare and run for their money 🤣
“When your down 3-1 again against the Los Angeles but it’s not the clipper”.
Murray replay over and over 4:04
i think LAL and MIA will meet in the finals.  but im still with LAL.
Kuzma cannot guard to save his life and can Danny green hit the shots he was getting in Toronto like damn. He just out there running
Lebron and AD combine for 60 Shannon won his case of Dew😀
Chip Bitch
Lakers needed to lose a game each series in order to advance. The Nuggest also needed to he down 3-1 in order to win the series.... who you bet?
*IT’S LeRIGGED!!!*
Denver got all the calls by the refs in the last 2 games now Lakers got calls in the 1 and 4  games i say its pretty dame even...👍
AD's injury looked really bad. Hope hes ok
Lakers in 5!
The Lakers should've just gave this game to Denver it's much better to be 2-2 than 3-1 against Denver
Lakers been in a shooting slump. I feel like the refs saved them this game. Lakers in 5
Jazz up 3-1 Clippers up 3-1 Lakers up 3-1 Nuggets: how many do we have to teach you this lesson, old man?
The refs are the real mvp.
DAVIS VS KD WHO YOU GOT??   COMMENT BELOW
If the nuggets win this game, toxic lakers fans like, "the refs help the nuggets win😭😭😭😭"
Howard and rondo x factor
Game 1 and game 4 were gift wrapped to the Lakers Game 2 and 3 to the Nuggets  Fire Scott Foster and the bald guy How is Foster still there when he was involved in the Tim Donaghy scandal
Lakers vs Heat: Lakers in 6
The 3-1 Deficit Course is Coming... 😅✌️
Nuggets : after lossing the game 3-1 oh f**k here we go again
Lebron undefeated when closing out a series
No bs, tho. The Lakers have no choice but to close them out in the next game. Can’t give the Chicken Nuggets any confidence, they’ll thrive off of it. Facts.
Congratss Lakers King James soLid ✊
Uncle shannon voice 🗣 don't do that skip 😂
refs wanted the series to go 3 - 1
Somebody give an ice pack to Murray for his back for carrying the team
dont care who wins championship this season doesnt count haha
Nuggets Fans really thinking that the Nuggets can force game 7💀
Hep ! Hep ! Murray bwahaha

Uh-oh its 3-1. Lakers won both series when up by such but nuggets won both also when down 1-3.  Playoff rondo so good. Unlike playoff p. Hahaha
Kuzma can't guard Porter.
Well Denver is now in another 3-1 deficit for the THIRD time in this playoffs. This was a solid game from both teams & now the question remains, will the Nuggets make another comeback or will the Lakers seal the deal?
MVP for the Lakers was definitely the Whistles!  What a performance!   35 FTs for LA, 23 for Den.
Denver Nugget 2020 is like Detroit Pistons 2004 w/o a Ben Wallace and Chauncey Billups. They play good though
basketball is the best.  I play a ton of basketball.
Nuggets lost this game more than the Lakers won it
AD's miraculous ankle recovery should be written up in The Medical journal of Bullshit
Ha hatdog
Thought lebron had one shoe on the whole game
Niceee onee lakers
cool video. go jazz and heat.
Nuggets winning series confirmed
Kuzma needs to step up.
you just activated the nuggets 3-1 power
No matter what happens Murray really showed out inna playoffs
Activate the 3-1 Mode---Denver
We Smokin a nuggets pack
Down 3-1 nuggets 😬
6:34
Niceee onee lakers
Let's go lakers and 5
La Haters like every game   "LOs AnGelEs rEfs" "Refs are bad" "Davis Carried Lebron"
I know Lakers won but this game is one of those game that you should not compare Lebron to the Goat, Lebron is almost a "NO SHOW" during the 4th quarter. Paul Milsap and Nikola Jokic got 5 foul each how come you are not attacking and just taking outside jumpers. SMH.
Murray was really playing on MJ level, mama!
Player of the match - refs
damn i hope they dont blow this lead im a big lakers fan ill be sooo heartbreking if they blow the 3-1 lead peace
they knew when the nuggets  are walking through the locker room they aint clippers and  utah
Lakers might have had a chance if they lost this one
Next up: 4-1 or 3-2
LoL the refs are giving away free shots to Lakers. Like the lakers are so precious and untouchable. Anyways Nuggets 3-1
bobo talo talaga Denver wag niyo na sisihin ang referee
fake, nobody is watching this crap!
Can Murray get help his teammates missing wide open shots.
I thought nuggets wins because of comments.  Ps i read the comments before watching HAHA😂
Rebounds win games!!!
bad defense of nuggets
I see rondo 2008 Assist
Nuggets need to improve their rebound game big time and they have to stop relying on Murray no way these ugly fucks Lakers win the finals
Kuzma needs to be traded
Exceptional game play by Jamal Murray....great...your shoes always highlighted you 😂😂and most of the time I was watching you😎😎
Yahoo!!!Panalo ang Lakers, Noon Game 3 Gipagbig yan Lang ang Denver Manalo Dahil may naghamon Figth UFC kay IDol LeBron James Hahaha.....
3-1 you know what that means....
Coach Malone got his wish.  SOMEHOW beating a mature LeBron playoff team, down 3-1, with Playoff Rondo and AD on the other team.   *Now that would be a freaking miracle, and kinda fitting for how F’d up 2020 has been*
Joker: how about another joke murray?
Nuggets have the Lakers right where they want them now.
Nuggets have them right where they want them!😂😂😂
3 things in life are guaranteed.. Death  Taxes Playoff Rondo
APPRECIATE RONDO PLAYOFF
Defund the referees.
Fake pass @ 6:37 was DIRTYY 🔥
Lebron if u seeing this comment.   I want u do the same. this is for u Cleveland When u win the title I want u too say  This is for u Kobe Bryant Make it go viral
Murray put on a show, they may have lost but man that guy is a monster.
murray - i got lebron posterized layup
Y’all saying refs saved lakers like the refs didn’t save the nuggets for winning two 3-1 series Lmaoo lakers in 5 bitch
Lakers for the win
Lakers: Beats Denver 3-1 Also Lakers: WHY DO I HEAR BOSS MUSIC
Lakers has a chance to go 4-1 all series.
Lakers taking the whole Dimmsdale Dimmadome this season quote me on it
Nuggets fans need to let it sink in now.. series is over with refs and Lakers playing like this.
3-1.. Let's see if the curse will continue..
Rondo is the Man.
rajon rondonis the man in game 4 💪😎
Lakers about to show the world they ain't the clippers.. Series over in 5
Play off rondo is real ❤️
3-1 baby lets go lakers on top baby
Play off Rondo😤💪
Lakers done fucked up
We all know how this series is going to end we've seen it before.
Y'all dont be suprised the Nuggets are 1st seed in the west next year Murray is gonna average 25+ and Porter Jr is only gonna get better and Jokic is the best center in the game
Nuggets: the key is to let them have 3-1 lead so we can start our show
I swear I wanted to throw my TV when Keiff picked up those two late game fouls, one being an offensive foul, & the other sending Murray to the line.
3-1 Lakers.... Here we go again...
3-1? We all know whats next😆
The refs are so good at their job 🤦🏾‍♂️
Basically its 8v5 on the court🤣🤣 But its denver 3-1 its just a number for them lets wait for game5
Nuggets in 7
Can’t wait for the 3-1 comeback
I’m so proud to see no first comments 🙂
Lakers saucin the nuggets
Nuggets have already made it to the Finals after this L
I got Lakers and Heat.
Nuggets in 7?
This is brons last chance to win a ring if he doesn’t do it then the goat convo is finally settled
Sorry denver fans. You're the sacramento 2.0. It's a business. The cooking show continues.🤣😭😭
Congrats to Denver! Making for their first final appearance!
lmao at dwight constantly harassing jokic for the 3 sec defensive count
Lakers winning this for Kobe
Denver would’ve won if they called a foul on bitchass Lebron when Murray drove it in.
Lakers saved
Nuggets have officially made the finals.
Nba Finals: Lakers in 5 screenshot and dm me @robertrelish on ig
KCP is still being slept on? Rondo is it. AD came thru to get it done ✅
RIGGED FUCKING GARBAGE. JOKE OF A LEAGUE
3:59 LOLLLLLLL!!!!
What a great win for the lakers actually happy for them going to the finals since 2010
Lakers How To Win Book: Foul Out Jokic,  2nd. Wear The Mamba Jerseys  3rd. Teach Dwight Howard How To Defend without Fouling Step 2 To Part 3. Start Howard  4th. Win The Game?
Denver in 7 will probably not happen again
Lakers: We’re up 3-1 Nuggets: You have activated our trap card
Dwight Fucking Howard!!!!!
Oww yeah Lakers make it on the final for Kobe🤴
Lakers vs Portland 4-1 Lakers vs Rockets 4-1 Lakers vs Nuggets 4-1 💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜
Howard was beast
Nuggets games 1-4: Meh   Nuggets games 5-7 Being down 3-1: Super Saiyan Activated!
MJ, I mean JM was playing terrific. 3-1 vs 1-3? Who you got?
Rondo will celebrate maturbation tonight
LeBron looked tired and didn’t shoot well at all tonight kinda surprising I wonder what was up with him he still locked up Murray tho in the 4th
Whoever's announcing the score during live is a bitch
Thrice is enough
It took LBJ to guard Murray in the crucial minutes to make him miss his shots.....
Should be at least 2-2. Lebum bailed out once again. Easiest path to the championship in 30 years and still relies on teammates, refs, and even other teams players (plumlee) to barely win just like he has his whole career. Only thing keeping his legacy alive are 14 yr olds on twitter
Being a Lakers fan I wanna pay my respect to Jamal Murray. Man was straight out Balling.
The refs were ABYSMAL in the fourth
Once again with a quick upload 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nuggets you can't give up 12 offensive boards and expect to win a game especially against the Lakers. Good run but y'all blew it with this.
LeBron James (26 PTS, 9 REB, 8 AST) & Anthony Davis (34 PTS) help the Los Angeles Lakers take a 3-1 series lead! Game 5: Saturday at 9pm/et on TNT #NBAPlayoffs   Dwight Howard: 12 PTS, 11 REB Rajon Rondo: 11 PTS, 7 AST Jamal Murray: 32 PTS, 8 AST
Le King snatching triple doubles at year 17 like any other prime athletes....GOAT things 🔥🔥
For anyone saying this series is rigged or unfair to the nuggets, take a look at the free throw disparity over the last 4 games Lakers: 113    Nuggets: 113  If you think the series should've been tied 2-2 because of that AD lucky shot then what about Jokic's no look lucky tip in to tied the game with less than 30 seconds? By the way AD took an open 3 which is not luck since the ball didn't take 4 bounces or some odd shot. Lakers up 3-1 will finish them by game 5.
Congrats to Rondo for passing another all-time great playoff performer, Scottie Pippen, in playoff assists.
BBQ, Hot Mustard, Honey Mustard, Sweet & Sour, Ranch, Ketchup, man these Nuggets go with anything! Good thing the Lakers are NOT the Clippers.
Refs were a great 6th man for the Lakers, guessing they're crying helped !  Nuggets the better team. Glad AD's ankle "injury" turned out to be fake though.
2 Ways to win against the Nuggets 1. don’t go up 3-1 2. foul Mason BUMlee and let him chunk up free throws
I hope AD is not injured today
I almost had a heart attack thinking AD had a sprain and will be out at least a month like Hayward did. Luckily he just walked it off. That's what I get for betting money I don't have for the Lakers to win the NBA Finals.
That’s how we bounce back much respect for the nuggets in the bubble just leaving it all out there and playing hard let’s go lakers and close this series out int 5
murray has been most outstanding player throughout the playoffs
WHO WILL REPEAT: Is it Lakers 4-1 or Nuggets 7-3?
GS💛❤️
Here come the delusional denver fans that are actually happy because their down 3-1 😂🌽🌽
Ah yes, the dreaded 3-1 lead
Everyone: LAL TAKES 3-1 LEAD ITS OVER FOR DENVER   DENVER: HOLD MY NUGGETS
4:04 What. A. Move.
Lakers are now 52-0 when in lead entering the fourth quarter
I watched the game from the TNT OT cameras but to me it seemed like the refs rigged the game. Every time the Nuggets started to make a comeback either AD or LeBron would get a bad call going their way and get 2 free throws
5 more wins till LBj's 4th ring
Lebron really said "oh hey murray"
I hope people will see this they will be safe from covid19 🙏pray for world recovery .Amen
Mannnnn Rondo just trying to tell Nba to raise my man's stats
Shannon prediction about the lead was on point.
After the game Everyone: damn we’re down 3-1 Murray: was that not the goal?
Dwight and Rondo make a cute couple, No?
Nuggets in 7
Like and i'll give you a link about Emily Willis and Lexi Lore
👍
That Jamal Murray acrobatic shot reminds me of 90's Michael Jordan wow...
I know I ain't the only one who's heart stopped for a second when A.D went down!! 😬😳
Imagine if the nuggets come back from a 3 1 lead agian...
Tonight game was good
Playoff Rondo and Superman 🔥🔥🔥
Now you will unleash the beast
Lakers in 5🙏🔥
MAN!!! This year's playoffs is the most exciting game since 2016. As Lakers fan, I got to give Nuggets Murray some kudos for those impossible plays. But we have to be consistent as the Nuggets are known to make a come back. Got thing coach V knows how to play his squad.
You know what happens to the Nuggets when they're down 3-1?  Nuggets in 7.
Idk man, I feel like Murry carrying Denver in the 4th ain't going to be enough
Honestly nugget couldn’t get rebound but them refs tho 🤦‍♂️
Lebron Locked Murray up in crunch time 💪🏽
Welp might as well go ahead a chalk it up cause their is NO WAY the Nuggets do it Three times in a Row I don't believe it  Sorry Denver but it was a Good Run and a Good Journey  Next up Lakers vs Heat Finals that hopefully can be a very good if the Lakers dont just roll threw them which I hope they don't
Lakers 3 - 1  Denver: Trap Card Activated
Idk if Michael Jordan’s dating Jamal Murray girl friend cause wtv she got it’s something special
Oh crap. The lakers have fallen into the trap.
Rondo was Clutch!!
Im not a Denver fan, but the refs took good care of the Lakers tonight
Why no one is talking about the layup of Jamal Murray
LeBron's defense on Murray made the difference down the stretch. #Year17
ibahin nyo ang lakers sa clipoers hahaha
Saw this one coming 🤣🧏🏽‍♂️
Honestly as a Danny green fan I'd rather have henny shooting
i ain’t even gonna cap. lebron some hot cheeks rn. he needs to step up.
Danny green been consistent this series tho🤦‍♂️
Murray will have trouble if LeBron is checking him.  6'3 200 versus a 6'9 260 pound defender.
Don’t worry, I will make my moves in the off season       For Kuzma and Green
Lakers: We're 3-1 up,  Nuggets: We're about to take the Playoffs personal
Let’s close this one out, before I get a stroke or something 😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂
Dwight should have a longer playing time in the 4th qtr. Markieff is not just effective.
Man davis is goated
how bout jerami grant defense
Lakers Let’s Use That Energy To Win The Other Games Coming!!!
Whoaaaahh
There will be no 3-1 Comeback this time, Guaaaaaaaaranteeed (Barkley's Voice)
Denver has them right where they want them.
1990’s: Shaquille O’Neal vs. Alonzo Mourning 2000’s: Kobe Bryant vs. Dwyane Wade 2010’s Kobe Bryant vs. LeBron James 2020’s LeBron James & Anthony Davis vs. Jimmy Butler & Bam Adebayo
way too fast uploading bro
With less than a minute left 24 fouls for LA 27 fouls for Denver ........... seem fair to me  stfu cry me a river
Well lakers... don't mess this 1-3 Nuggets are a different beast!!
Good win by the Lakers. LeBron’s defense on Murray was clutch and impressive Rondo has been a big surprise and improved his shooting. Lakers vs Heat finals would be fun if it happens. We need to finish the job in game 5 and don’t let them have any momentum at all.
Who else saw Kyle” I fall for every pump fake” Kuzma!?
NEVER GIVE UP NUGGETS!!!
Next time jammal Murray gf should give the whole team head I wonder what’s so good about it
*Ah shit, here we go again*
nuggets in 7
This game sucked Denver messed up they needed this game as a Nuggets fan this sucks and it hurts and I hate to admit it but it's over 3 times is not a charm Denver in reality will not come back down 3-1 again not to the Lakers it sucks but it was definitely a great year for the Nuggets they showed fight and heart what a year for the Nuggets I am just so proud I just wished the Nuggets showed urgency in this game we needed this game it sucks that the season is over
Tbh I feel like there were alot of calls that went la way that they shouldn't have,ad stepped on Millsap and they called it a foul on him,LeBron fouled Murray two possessions in a row and no call,but overall good game
All the call of the reffs are in favor of lakers..what the fuking game is that
Lakers: 3-1 Mike Malone: you have activated my trap card
Nuggets: ight we down 3-1 boys we know what coming right? Lakers: *wearing black Mamba jerseys game 5 An unstoppable force vs. an immovable object
Youtube is getting real comfortable with these double 15 second no skip ads .
nuggets: goes down 3-1  ah shit here we go again...
4:04 dear Lord have mercy🥶🥶
"Fun Fact": Crows can hold grudges against specific individual people.
Nuggets are always down 3-1. Lakers are always up 3-1.
Lmaooooo, just bench Kuzma all game in game 5 and we win 🤣🤣🤣
All the lakers gotta do is not do what the Clippers did
Murray: Nuggets should be 4-0 now
Im waiting for comments that say refs with the lakers win ahahaa.. 😂😅🤦
Remember they're not Jazz and Clippers to blow a 3-1 lead. That's the Lakers with LeBron James.
Nuggets are going as planned       3-1
Damn man Nuggets had that game too if it wasn't for the foul trouble and Rebounds
Murray elite bro no cap new superstar on the way
Refs had on purple n yellow jersey's tonight
Lakers in 5 .... 😁😁😁😁😁😁😝😝😝😝
Which is more powerful: Nuggets being down 3-1, or Lakers Gentleman's Sweep?
nice play denver but you know the lakers didn't want to lose this game lakers in 5😊
Great fast upload! Thanks, bro. - philippines
Lakers will make the finals come back to this commet if im right
Go Nuggets
I'm glad what Denver has achieved in this playoffs so far, but the Lakers will win the WCF
I think we all know whats going to happen now.
been a while since the yellow jerseys
1:40 watch ad take it out after they score
Another 3-1 comeback maybe? Anyway, Murray proves himself to be a superstar caliber player. Wish to see them play more games and take it to Game 7.
Nuggets fans on suicide watch lmaooo 😂 Lakers ain't the same team!
POV:your here after the lakers blew a 3-1 lead
Dwight Howard is the player of the game if u ask me. Can’t believe I’m saying this Lol
Murray has really made a name for himself in the playoffs.
Am I gonna be the one to do it? Fine , NBA are clearly setting the storyline up for the Lakers to win it all , Look at their commercials , look at everything but hey , Give Bron that ring im happy with that
Even tho I want the Lakers to win, I gotta admit, Denver has a future Star on their hands in Murray.
Which team going to keep their streak:- Lakers win series in game 5 or Nuggets comeback from 3-1 down or game 6???
All part of the Nuggets plan...3-1. Congrats on making the finals. 👊
Murray played a great game in the loss and he was 1000%fouled late in the 4th by LBJ but anyways they had chances to tie themselves. Let's see how Denver responds.
Its over, i said if the Lakers win 3 before the Nuggets get 2 it’s over. Doesn’t matter if it’s next game or game 7, Lakers to the finals, end of story. 😤😤
Congratulations LAKERS! 🎉❤
Shannon sharp was right on the head with the point differential
Down 3-1 nuggets vs up 3-1 lakers. Both are undefeated so far at these points. Question is, who wins
It’s so blatant the series is rigged. Lebron and the lakers can thank the refs for this one and game 1.
Thank God AD did not break his ankle that would be it for my purple yellow team❤️
Lebron: I've came back from down 3-1  Nuggets: *Uno Reverse Card*
Kobe died at 41, so that means every laker series is going to be 4-1👁
nuggets is dangerous when there down 3-1  rondo is the x factor for lakers
Must be nice to cry and get the calls you want. Talk about a rigged game. SMH
Not this time Denver. 3-1 will be 4-1 ! This Ain't the Clippers.
Murray’s girl doing a good job😹🤣🤣🤣
These guys just WON'T LOSE!
LeBron needs to be more aggresive
Let’s go Lakers
AD is out there balling but I just hope his knee is ok and Lebron is a beast and playoff Rondo is real and the Lakers need to start Dwight Howard every game from this point on
Lakers should not allow nuggets to have 3peat of comeback.
Lebrons the Greatest of Alltime.  Lebron and AD are the best Duo in Basketball not kawhi and PG
It was a good game but I swear the refs helped the Lakers so much this game, God damn, good win for the Lakers, but seriously refs were on the Lakers side, God damn Refs listening to Bring Bron, LeHelp
No one..    Ight we down 3 1  lets play for real!
I am
Bruh Danny Green is so bad Jesus Christ.
Lakers living in the free-throw line
That 4th quarter was tense. Good thing Lakers got a lot of those off rebounds in the 4th. Rest those ankles AD. Lakers in 5 now rather than 6
Who is a lakers fan
Denver Nuggets: I see you fell into my trap. Being up 3-1.
Sorry Laker fans,it's over
Refs back at it again making the difference
Almost got a heart attack watching this game 😂
I’m sorry but the nuggets deserved to win this game.... Murray was fouled TWICE on the drive. These refs are so bad
Mike malone is an idiot for not playing porter in the forth they could've won
Damn its 3-1 Will the Nuggets do the miracle??
Lebron's defense on Murray
LAKERS IN 6!
Daddy bron won
Jamal Murray what a fantastic play but Jokich was not playing that aggressively that the reason Denver lost
5 Wins to go for the #17th_23LakerNation_World_Championship_Title!
Nuggets vs Refs 🤦🏽‍♂️
Let's not ignore the affair of Lakers n referees who are ruinning thiz talents... so disguised how referees decide who is gonna win it 😤😤
Lakers go up 3-1 Denver Nuggets😏
Jamal Murray was ABUSING Dwight Howard (and pretty much all of the Lakers D) tonight.  He and Joker might be a PROBLEM for the league for years to come.
nuggets vs heat secured now
Lakers: Has a 3-1 lead Also Lakers: We’re in the endgame now..
KOBEEEE💜💛💜💛💜💛
Lakers made a mistake by going up 3-1
Honestly I'm not excited for this game, my mind is looking forward for Game 5. 🤧🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😔
Dwight Howard showed up to play tonight!! Beast Mode activated. 💪🏿
Lakers can’t sleep on the Nuggets, these boys can play! Lakers still need to go all out next game to close it out!
Down 1-3, the Nuggets are on the right track!
How do these get posted so fast what the heck
LeBron really called his daddy Adam silver for more help
the difference between the lakers and the clippers is that the clippers belong in the basement for underestimating the nuggets. Good win, lakers. #LeGOATJames
3-1 lead, Uh oh
Lebron James has been improving on The Free Throws.
Dwight Howard played like his boyfriend was watching.
Love that King James guarded Murray the last final minutes 👑🐐
I want to see more of the Dwight Howard in Orlando version
A.D or JOKER   Like for Ad   Comment for  JOKER
if you think lakers will blow a 3-1 lead, just quit pls
Bruh why did the Lakers win u know they ganna come back 3-1 again I thought they were smart smh   If u don’t know this is a joke Lakers in 6
Jokic after this game: WE HAVE THEM RIGHT WHERE WE WANT THEM!
Let me guess "Nuggets in 7"? Not happening. LeBron never backs down from a 3-1 lead
I said it at the start, Lakers in 5 or 6. But if Nuggets somehow pulled off a 3-1 comeback again I would bet on them to win it all.
Who ever is reading this have a blessed day stay safe!!  Small basketball youtuber looking for your support here
3-1 again.
6:39 Kuzma is SO ASS on defense lmao
3-1
Lakers for the win...! see ya all at FINALS...!!!
😂😂💀💀 I thought I was first not even third
Murray legit almost played like Jordan in the 4th quarter...those shots were IMPECCABLE. But that AD x Bron connection... 18-1 when over combined 60pts baby! 🤩 #ForTheChip 💜💛
Howard was looking like Orlando Magic Howard out there. Got damn. What a genius move by Vogel to start him
Refs won this game. Bron called the league bitching for more foul calls
Game 2 nuggets 33 fts lakers 19 Nuggets fans -This is fine i like this  Game 4 Lakers 35 fts nggets 23 Nuggets fans-THEY cheating fuck REFS! lol
It's 3-1 again.. 😃😃
Is cool
AD  AND MURRAY ALMOST INJURED
Those offensive bounds late in the game saved us!!
Nuggets: They're up 3-1. Let's comeback and win this series in 7.   Lakers: And we're gonna clap em.
Rest Davis until finals
Danny Green  21 minutes 3 rebounds 3 points  My Man looking a TEAM PLAYER😤😤 because we don't know which team he on
Up 3-1! We ain't the Jazz and the Clippers! This is the Lakers, we built different! Onto game 5! One more win to advance to the NBA Finals! Close out the Series!  #L4L! #lakersnation!!!!
Who came straight to the comments section
I scored as many points as Murray once Lebron guarded him.  ZERO
Nuggets Coach: We're down 3-1! We got them right where we want them!!! HAHAHAAHAH
Lakers win 3-1 Nuggets here we go again
Nuggets become trash can in this series hahahaha
This is how much championships the Lakers will win!  👇
LeBron Haters said the season doesn't count if the Lakers win the chip 😂😂😂😂😂
Lebron and the lakers complained about Lebron not getting fouls and the refs delivered.
3-1.. oh crap i’m scared for the lakers but who knows
Pls lakers don’t blow a 3-1 lead
Lakers in 5 Skiiuuuup, put some Dew on that!
Frick Jamal Murry man
Can’t lie LeBron was a$$ in the 4th..
Jamal Murray losing on purpose so he can appear like this 😎 just to comeback 3-1
Like if Lakers are winning Finals ⬇️
Porter Jr. has been embarrassing Kyle Kuzma all series.
Lakers in 5
One win away from advancing to the NBA Finals #GOLAKERS #FORKOBE 💜💛🙏🏾☝🏾🏆
You could tell AD was feeling that ankle injury those last 6 min or so 😬
Lakers if you loose to the heat say bye bye to bron bron he goin back than
I almost shit my pants when AD got hurt
LIBERATE LOS ANGELES!
Another 3-1 lead might to overcome by Denver
As much as I wanted the Nuggets to win, I think this time they cannot get out of this 3-1 lead one more time.
The Lakers better watch out that they don’t get complacent in game 5
Up 3-1 baby! No comeback this time. Denver is now battling the REAL Los Angeles team! Dont compare them to the ringless clippers 🏆🏆 #Lakersin5
I spend most of my time in "recording", "gameplay" and editing and uploading. I need all my brother's and sisters' support.  🙏🙏🙏🙏
Kostas might get a ring first before Giannis🤣
Murray: Down 1-3? That’s what we want
“tHe rEfS hElPeD tHeM tO wIn”
Lakers: Were up 3-1     Everyone: We all know whats coming 😂
Like Steph A said, “Denver is going down!!”  They ain’t coming back from 1-3 against the #1 seed in the West.
The series just officially started 🤣
A LeBron hater dies a thousand deaths.
Just wait for all the nuggets down 3-1 stuff that’s about to be posted
The refs were so awful
Playoff Rondo! Good Clean up. Anthony Davis good shit! Lets go Lakers!
LeBron is better than Kobe and Mj put together! Crazy
The LeBron haters already got the excuses ready for when he wins the chip like this ring don’t count,easy pass to the finals,carried by AD, the NBA is rigged etc.
Lmaoo Nuggets just activated.
Those Rebounds killing nuggets.
If nuggets can win this series down 3-1 for the third time bruh this shit is lit
This is where nuggets want them
AD TWIST HIS ANKLES AND YET REFS CALLED A FOUL ON MILSAP
Tt
Nuggets really need to step up their rebounding, because they allowed so many second chance points in the last few minutes, that cost them big time
I think we've seen this story before.
Let's go Lakers up 3-1
Theres no way Nuggets come back from 3-1. Good season tho
Now they fucked up 😂
I hate Lebron whyyyyyy
Lakers:3-1  Nuggets:Challenge Accepted
LETSSS GOOO
ANOTHER 3-1
we’ve seen teams have a 3-1 lead over the nuggets
Who ever is reading this have a blessed day stay safe!!  Small basketball youtuber looking for your support here
Oh no the lakers are done. The nuggets are winning the championship. Their down 3-1
Post game interview asked Lebron how he stopped Murray defensively lol. Bro, he put up 30+ on your ass Lebum, shut up!
Nuggets: ah shit here we go again
We all know what happens next
How many people believe lakers will take it all??
If Nuggets come back 3-1 again, I will let you guys throw rocks at me🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Nuggets after losing: "You haven't seen our final form ye-"  Lakers: "shut up, Lakers in 5"
*Lakers in 5.*
wow thats fast HAHAHA!
Uploaded 16 seconds ago and I already clicked, liked, and commented
Admit it you almost had a heart attack while watching this game.   Moreover, Lebron is always giving the zone players time to anticipate and gear up their defense when his holding the ball too long or when he's overdribbling. There are a lot of instances where he could just rip through the moment he touches the ball. I also want him to re-explore his pull up J he's really hurting his chances of hitting them when he's fading away or stepping back on those.
Hope AD injury isn’t bad.
Murray sold idc. Dude kept trying lebron inna paint passing up hella wide open ppl. They lost cus of him.
Unpopular opinion: The WNBA is better than the NBA
You know I still think the nuggets can force a game 6 at least
The refs get on their hands and knees for Lebron and Ad There were (i counted) 6 missed fouls accounting for 8 points for the lakers
I just watched this
Murray choked harder than his GF on dat brick of a 3 wit that last shot 💀💀💀💀💀💀 LAKERS IN 5 THO MFS!!!! 👋👋👋👋👋

Sad to say maybe no more comeback💔
I hope 1% that reads this will follow their dreams an never give up. My dream is to become a successful Youtuber.
Lakers boy how bout them LAKERS 🏁🤟🏾😎
LEBRON HAD TO PAY OFF THE REFS
This was a good game
Welp it’s over for the lakers, they up 3-1 😂
Lakers made a mistake going up 3-1...
*I can’t even lie AD played AMAZING today.*
I was just watching it
Lakers finishing this Saturday they not clippers
Oh no lakers are up 3-1...
Hats off to Frank Vogel . Just great coaching tonight
1.If you gonna complain about calls stop it game 2 nuggets 33 fts lakers just 19 an ya still lost lol  2. The miss call on Bron when he hit Murray ya need to get mad at coach malone for not challenging it lol he would of won it.
Well that was fast haha
If the Nuggets can come back from a 3-1 deficit AGAIN, Man that would be crazy.
I have to give props to jamal he played really well tonight

Murray should have gotten more free throws last quarter -___-
We’ve reached the ultimate paradox in the NBA Bubble:   The Nuggets are invincible when down 3-1 yet the Lakers are invincible when losing one game and then they get the gentleman sweep
Lakers just made a terrible mistake
Yes

Well the nuggets have just advanced to the finals
Guys repent from your sins Jesus Christ is coming back soon you don’t want to be left behind.

Admit it you almost had a hurt attack while watching this game.   Moreover, Lebron is always giving the zone players time to anticipate and gear up their defense when his holding the ball too long or when he's overdribbling.
