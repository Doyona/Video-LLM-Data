100m flop
Wow
Sick i cant believe this I cant wait to meet him because I'm such a fan of man city
Can I get the jack Grealish card
Who’s here in 458AD 👇
WHO is here after the breakup
And the idiots think he's not talented 🤣🤣🤣
Pretty easy when the wall doesn’t jump
❤goodness
Grealish goat

واوووووو
People watching this in 2070

Can't do any of that in a competitive fixture lol😂
Es muy bueno
ผมขัดtv🌼🌼
❤❤❤❤❤
Dimarco x jack grealish
Imagine bringing a pro footballer and being shocked he's got skills.. 🤦‍♂
Jack Grealish 💪
👎
he's more than 47 defense
terrible GK
Jack Grealsih is a legend
I am shocked
07:53 if his dribbling is 2nd to none that implies he's better than Messi. Hilarious 🤣
My favorite English footballer!
It's easy to forget the off-the-charts skill level of some of these guys when all you see them do most of the time is battle other insanely good players for the ball on tv. It's tough for Grealish to stand out when he's among so many other great players at City and other sides. But put a camera on him and let him eff around for a while and you're reminded right quick about how you never had a chance at going pro if this is the level of skill required.
Fkn awesome
No deflection
Billy Wingrove just sounds like David Beckham.
Nooo
He is obviosly better in volleys than kai haverts😂💀
Jack and "David"  LOL
Se parece al Andre Pier gignac
I laughed throughout the wholeeeee video 😂😂😂😂😂 Jack is soooo funny
Jacks touch is just amazing 😮
Tarrt ❤❤
Jack Grealish is 🔥🔥🔥
fly me out to to be goalkeeper i would save all his shots
Goalie was drunk
Yos Jack has so manny brilliant free kicks I think he should take free kick s for Man City I think he should have gone we’re with the water
Jack greasely.... What card we looking for 😅 😮
I thought from the thumbnail it was jaimy tart
🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍👍👍👍👍👍👍
BL Win
I thought that was Jamie Tartt
Grealish's skills? He can drink....
🌪🌪🌪🌪
Who's here after the treble?
he is not appropriate for big teams because too avarage player broo
You was shocked a £100 million player could do keepy ups and have a nice touch ?
Jack freakish is my dad’s friend Jonny Wilson and I am Aodhan wilson
I am  Better than jack grealish when I imagine my a professional football in my thoughts 😎😎 🤣😏
Why would you be surprised , he’s on a top team and he’s one of the best footballers compared to an average player 😂
overprice player
all i can say is i love his hair
Nice video, music too load at times cheers
T hernandez ?
Jack looks stoned out of his mind during the pack opening
Top
Poped up after UCL Final , =)
Surprised he didn't flop in the video
Who is came here after champion league final 💙💙💙
Nice volley jack
And quite a few clowns doubted he was any good, if Southgate hadn’t bottled it we would have won the euros
And quite a few clowns couldn’t even see what a player he was and is
jack grealish can you  weigh at least 80kg?
Good keeper😂
I actually want to watch this bit the music is ridiculous...I'm out
Jack is insane
Your the best YouTuber in the whole wide universe ❤
You’re so lucky to play with Jack Grealish🎉🎉🎉😮
Incredible Football at this level is not even imaginable
Jack you are just amazing
10 minutes of marketing and 1 minute of playing.
Pep, pep guardiola
He's okay. Not as good as Barry Bannan though.
Depois do Beckham é o jogador mais bonito que eu já vi 😍
Grealish is the best...
Hes playing for city, ofc hes good man
Jack is a legend, keeper is shiite
Que buena dupla, Beckham y Grealish
Devastante 👏👏
Sucks , RichKid💩💩💩
Skill ----> Luck
Он впечатлил меня!
he is a great brummie the best old vllain
not sure of show of surprise?? JG is a very good footballer
This Guy is incredible
Showed levels 🎉
He needs to be taking free kicks in matches
Jamie tarttttttt
A good player yes, but to announce him as a Legend 😂🤔no no , not even close.
Would love to see a v2 now!
😀👌👌👌
He really earned that PL title this year. Absolutely loved watching him play
Well done billy..glad u carried on...
Only player with a better touch on the City team is probably Mahrez
Blondie is like a David Beckham and Russell Brand love child.
Jack Girlish
can't do it in a match though.
I would've blocked ALL of those free kicks
Its so crazy how someone can be so skilled but on Man City he hardly ever scores.
England should build a team around him.......but woke our current wokey jokey manager no chance
A natural talent like gazza!!
that Maldini card RIP lmao
He is insane 😮😲
Keeper woeful
he's wasted at City
God
Get him on the free kicks pep🔥
Absolutely brilliant skills.
Grealish spends more time in games on his back than on his feet lol
Casually opening a 2400$ card 😅
What's the music on 2:43?
Imagine having calf’s like that and spending most of your career on the floor 😂😂
Wicked talent. That was a blast to watch.
Hes reakly coming into his own now for us, hes helping create goals open up soace keeos hold of the ball better than anyone in the team fraws fouls in reall good areas and is forming a great oartnership with Haaland and alverez
What's with Jack's chick hair? Scrap that thing!!!
His best talent is at falling down. No one does it better.
his skill set, touch, shot. . . . .  is amazing!
How sick is that ! Amazing skills !
To kids that are watching, buy stocks instead of useless sports cards. You are welcome
With his money, you’d think he could afford a better haircut.
i got jack card
chill out with the sponsorship bruh lol
You haven't seen the what's app messages
I'm I the only person who sees this guy as so overrated and not worth the money and the hype he's being given? the guy has mediocre dribbling that barely works, his pace is somewhat ok and he's not technical at all? the only thing that he's got that I can give him credit for is work ethic.. he does work hard!! apart from that I do not see him a mancity level. Aston villa and the likes where he belongs.. perhaps there he outshines everyone else..
Way better player than for example Mohamed Salah
I thought that was david Beckham
This aged well. Grealish developed great ad City. You really have to give pep credit for this. He gave bayern sane because he knew that he needs so improve a lot, Grealish is way better there and plays great with haaland and de bruyne.
Che scarso grealish..120 milioni di euro buttati ahahahah leao allora vale 300 milioni,theo 250 milioni maignan 500 milioni ahahahaahah
To the presenter guy - lay off the St.Tropez lad.
The Gk is dumb
What a beast. Have to say your overaction and that bad keeper aren't really up to the level tho.
⚽️🔥🔥🔥🔥👏🏽
Damn u looks like Beckham somehow 😂❤ I love it
I want Jack Grelish to come to my house
Jack Grelish
I want Jacari list to come to my house and I got his card
Ä
Makes me squeal that you never put the signed card in a penny sleeve or top loader!
Tormann beruflich TürSTEHER
Thank for is a beautiful vides him, Jack. you are a balls control incredible⚽
how do me is win a cards ?
I tought he's Jammie Taart
Why is he being this good at  shooting in practice but bad in games…
Get a good haircut man.
Jack simply is enjoying his job , soccer game !!!!
those calf's have more history than my entire life
O bichão é monstro
ジャック！
You should do phil foden and jack grealish there a great duo both have amazing control
Give me the WAha hahahahaha
Jacksinho
Legend😂😂😂
Haha the last chalange was to easy
Nepal ❤❤❤
Sometime please get that haircut off of him, he looks 11 years old. 😅
а в игре че так не забивает то?
Bottle o wotah
"Legend"??  Got carried away there, F2.  But I admit - after a rocky start, he's growing on me.  And always seems like a good bloke.
Billy’s job is to just go “WOOOOAAAHHHH YESSSS” after everything he does.
Jack my mom has a crush on your calves
Jack Grealish aka Jamie Tart 😂
Never heard of these cards, would players like Mbappé or Haaland be rarer than others?
0:09
AI LÀ NG VIETNAM
wtf is with that goalkeeper?
Based on his free kicks , How good must debruyne or  mahrez be 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
GOAT GERALISH
Absolute baller ☘️
What a legend
Alright calm down. It wasn't maradonna
great job ❤
The hair of grealish looks so stupid
Those calves are crystalized talent
You need a better goalkeeper, at least one who can make the things a bit more difficult for professional football players so they can show more.  Regards
bros calves are huge
GOAT GREALISH
Is Jack Grealish Gay?
That keeper on the last exercise: “tf you expect me to do here mate…”
He’s a premier league player for the most consistent club in the last 10 years and he’s an international. What did you expect? 😂
the difference with Professionals man iits actually insane to think how good they are compared to the average and even more advanced players
turn the sound effects down
i love alisson
WHAT IS THE GK DOING? 💀
My 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 player
"Big man pass me the water" 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Grealish is funny called him big man and all
Bro copying Pavard goal 😂😂
3.25 икры😮
Faon           haland               cevin  De   broid
Yes
Brasil 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆  England 🏆
You look like theo hernandez 😂😂
fack up
I think Grealish would look cooler with a buzz cut
Get a better goalkeeper
Bring vvd
He seems to be an intuitive player.
Why is this guy so bad in the official games?
my favourite player is Jack Grealish
เเก้เเน่อ้ายหรั่ง
I was sad for the goalkeeper 🥲🤣
Good shots, but the keeper is kind of rubbish, I would think that I would be able to save half those freekick
แข่งจริงกูไม่เห็นจะยิงเลย
Is that,the real jack grealish
No deflection.
hi
His playing style is clean no messes
The calves man himself
29 goals in 128 appearances at Aston villa you guys are so dumb as soccer fans gets real he’s good not great not oozing talent he’s 27
He’s not even that great you guys are insane Saku better I can name 20 guys better at that position 😂😂😂
u ppl really schocked a 1,2b player can juggle the ball?... England! smh
A modern day Beckham
Jack is such a friendly geezer if you get the chance to meet him consider you a very lucky man
Keeper looks super slow
3:23 can we talk about jacks calfs wtf
He is a great player.
I’m trying my hardest to get you  and you are my best favourite player
“This guy’s ridiculous”  It’s like he’s a professional player 🤦🏻‍♂️😂
I can’t believe that Jack Grealish actually came to ur house
The keeper was not hurt in this video  " His feelings were "
No
that keeps was a serious NPC
More shocked he stayed on his feet and hit back of the net
Wait so Messi and Jack have the same offensive rating 🤣🤣🤣
Then Messi
Next time do Ronaldo
With his luck as well straight after I got him in the same pack I got Ronaldo
Haven't got one of them cars but I have got a star sign in Jack card
Grealish who’s your best friend for Man City I hope it’s little Phil
Grealish I love you city is the best❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
t2
Jack grealish is one of the best free kick takers in the world in my opinion
He’s shite seen better on a Sunday morning
Then he goes and misses that shot against Real Madrid that could have ended madrid at that moment. Thankkkkkk you mate I love you for that 😂. HALA MADRID !!!!!
Were is Jeremy
Please can I have the sighed card pleeeeeeeaaaaaaaase
Problem is he seems too happy to be a super sub! What’s the problem? Does he not have the stamina t play for 90 minutes? Pep and Southgate start him ffs!!! 😂
Hopefully see him on for England more in future!
Jack is the best  but,I think their is more better players
Why is he grey tho?
Deflection
Wwow
Not to be a downer, but this goal keeper was terrible.  Obviously  Jack was on auto pilot.
Skillswise he is honestly a basic footballer with NOTHING special lmao, not sure how people can be this blind🤔
Bad aka trash
Grealish has gone  backwards at man city he's stopped developing.
One of the British players who deserves to wear Brasilian national team jersey!
dude sucks
Hes a really good player, and his touches are insane too. Hope to see a good future for him
That keeper can’t save not even a word document .
A modest overrated player. It is normal that he knows how to do basic things to serve in a championship team.
You may as well put my Nan in goal instead of this hopeless keeper ffs🤣
Thats not the original card he signed.....just saying COE!
1:54 How name is melody ?
only skillful English player i know was Paul Gascoigne
❤❤❤
هو احمد عامل ايه 😂😂
My fav when at villa but at city he's not really find his form yet
I play DLS and I have Jack he is the CAPTAIN
Omg
Grealish breathes Billy : AWWWWW LOVE ITTT
Almiron is better than you
Play like Almliron
What was the keeper doing?… for real bro
why is grealish  attack 93 and haaland 91
I wish it could be “we” 😞😞
I wish it could be “we” 😞😞
والله جاك غريليش صوته فخم حق اغنياء
🤩🤩🤩
Where is the goalkeeper in this video?
Not a deflection
Aguante almirón
in the game he doesn't do that
he better than he is on the pich😊
lol he good
Good Baller
Amazing Jack Grealish
Amazing🤯but what its the name of his haircut?
Eu não sou goleiro mais alguns chutes quer esse cara daí da pro goleiro pegar esse goleiro é um frangueiro
●●●●wow●●●●
Jack Grealish needs to be in a club where he is the main man. He has a potential.
How about you get a real goalkeeper and stop lying to the channel's audience. That keeper clearly has an order to not try his best (or he really sucks). No need to BS you audience.
Same thing jack
Grealish sobra en el city, una soberana 💩
David Beckham vs Jack grealis
He's the goat
Maaan, Grealish looks like Chrissy Costanza's (from Against the Current) brother
British Zac Efron
Keeper getting payed for doin nothing he lucky
Back in the day When Haland’s attack was 91 😆
How can he be rated the same as Messi tho.. with better defense so basically better than Messi
Calves 😅
How do you win this card
You were shocked that a £100m player was good at football?
There are a lot of players don't deserve their position .....
100 milhoes no Grelish,  guardiola tambem erra klkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Fortissimo Jack 😎
I think he should play starting eleven in Man city because he is for me one of the best left wingers in the world.
Captain brown tongue these
This player is awesome
Wish he done this in the real GAME!!!!! I 💙💙💙💙
Is he popular among English people?
My fav player💗❣
Show Pony, It’s nothing special, ask him to do Maradonas trick of kicking the ball vertically as high as he can and not moving off the spot when it comes back down.
Could be the next Gareth Bale if he have the same dicipline
I’ve got Jack Grealish limited edition card
Why do they look like two different eras of David Beckham hair styles
Respect to all man city player’s first touch ! ❤️‍🔥
Joga mto o homi
Man City: how can we burn a 100 million pounds? Sports director at MC: there is this player at Aston villa
Jack got a shield card 🤣
Is it a swan on his head?oh oppss thats his hair😁
Football is the best
👉 Check this out: https://youtu.be/TjEabsNi-9c. Thanks!!
Wow bro
It’s like a semi-clone of david beckham
9:00 because I train like I play.
Another over rated player 🤣
The talent of these world class footballers is other worldly.
skillfull, but no vision 😎
This guy is super handsome
I have 2/3 cards of the 2022 adrenalyn panini pack
I got the card
https://youtube.com/channel/UCcKLj9kC7L1wGrr2yI8I6LQ
Don't be shocked. He spends more time free styling than actually delivering on pitch so yeah!
That aint no premier league goalie tho
i'm sorry but the keepers they get are just absolute crap. If they had decent keepers then it would make Grealish's skills look even more impressive
🏛🎓🎏🎮🖼9
Bill did you leave f2
00:10
Nothing extraordinary
Cousin of Harry m
If only he could do it in an actual match…
I think my favorite part of this is when you try to criticize the way Grealish practices, just to have him explain to you how it works to be a professional player.
Yeah those tepid two yard back passes, zero assists and zero goals so far this season are frightening
manager sell grealish with this video,   in the euro , final, dont appear this player, hahaha
JACK who?
They both look kinda like Beckham
Biggest calves in the game
To bad he cant do any of that when the game starts....
That guy in goal ever made a save?
To good. Ive seen Ozil fail miserably in the past with these challenges. Guys a great natural baller.
He is overrated .... I'm french and I know about football. Mbappe way stronger
Lol i have more skill
Gets on a pro pitch, jumps on floor
Do it in a game, then!
Jack just needs the freedom to play. Instead of worrying about giving the ball away as instructed. “His words” just play on instinct. Greatness awaits!
Can he read a book?
He’s a great player for sure but your keeper is crap being honest
Jack's either tired or hungover lol. Man looks like death
most overrated player ever exist
Why do you never have someone who is good in goal though?
too many adds....
Why doesn't he use gel?
I'm a villa fan and this makes me proud,fed up,jealous, happy  and a few more all rolled in2 1 lol..
His 3rd and 4th strike . Just warming up. Wow
He's not getting challenged on the training pitch so he's got the time to concentrate and not worry about opponents, name many a player which is also great on the training pitch?? It's pretty easy. Problem is Grealish on the match pitch, he just falls apart, in many ways. What pointless trash, Villa saw this so dumped him on City for plenty of money. City will get rid of him soon. He is shooting above his weight.
Is it just me, or does Billy look like David Beckham?
There was no deflection
his calllvesssss
Goalie is about 14 yrs old
Could have put a proper goalie in and not my nephew.
😵😵
the balls what were delivered to him when he had to have one or two touches before striking at goal   With the type of service he was getting at Aston Villa
Not going to lie, these videos are so much better with just Billy…
Please tell him do this in real match tooo😁
That was pure filth🔥18+
Jack is a girlie hair
0:10 bo’o o wa’ah
These videos put into perspective just how massive the difference is between elite professional players and the best player in your typical sunday league. Different planets
Same like Higuain - good only at training..
English premium.. so much overrated
Nice goalkeeper
Anyone wants to play with me? Feel free to watch my video and let me know if you are interesting in losing the match! https://youtu.be/gRMQ4K6GxY4
Can't get past the little Dutch Girl Hairstyle.

comment #2000
Better than I thought. Not easy to perform in a Y-tube show.
overrated
The guys talent is astounding.
Legend ? I don’t know what happened to football 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Give me the waAar
Did I just hear lion-el messi? Yo wtf... it's lionel
A lot of people looking at J.G. with the transfer-fee in their mind. But actually that‘s the market and can‘t be influenced by the players (in the most cases). I just think that the amounts put a lot of pressure on (especially young) players who are actually really talented. And yeah I know they are getting paid huge amounts for that. But at the and of the day we are human beings who feel pressure, anxiety etc. as well. For these reasons I‘m not that sure if this development benefit the players (even they earn more and more…).  A non-english football fan (that‘s why i apologize for the bad language as well btw).  Cheers
The 100 mill flop.  Cheers city 😅😅
Test Harry kane free kick... I don't know why he always takes them, mayb he scores them on training 🤷🤷
the ending was dumb you should atleast defend and let him try to score goal while your defending rather then solo run on the keeper poor keeper
Matchattacks just gambling for kids
Very talented player..
No
Course this plank of wood would do this.
A little dink so it don't get the hair. Sad, don't u think
Basically just an advert. Get it up you.
football is dream
how much did the cue pay for the goal keeper actor?
2 Beckham wannabes 😂
this reminds me of the michael owen video for some reason
2:10 song TheGrefg siuuuu
One ofthe most overrated players in the EPL.  3 assists a 3 goals for mancity in the league?  15 goals and 17 assists in 4 years for villa.  What a player 👏
"The legend Jack Grealish"  to be a legend you have to do legendary stuff.... 1 trophee to his name, and that was for his first season at city....
Wasted at Man City
No
Chiesa is way better then this primadonna
Sexy in football in looks and voice 🤩
Simple - Grealish is a top player.  Also, nice vid but PLEASE turn the vol. down on the background music next time. Way too loud.
Disrespectful player for Almiron jibe
He’s a cool lad and the history behind and his family made me a fan
Why would u shock..he's professional football player
Now he is playing outstanding in this new season. His passing , play making , ball control, dribbling is amazing.He will be more better for sure.
Champ!
Кипера хоть поставили бы)
Most overrated player I’ve ever seen
What a brilliant player he is
He only signed by city and price tag cos it was political at time and he’s British
All he does is play for fouls super super overated
You guys are awesome Bill and Jess the best
Jack the king
I wanna see Jack’s parking skills in the next video.
As a Villa fan I’ve always loved jack grealish
Billy sounds like and even has the looks of Becks a few years ago!
yeah GREILISH Is A Baller
Ad city
Why is the presenter wearing foundation and fake tan on his face?
Don't know why u put shocked in the title everyone's knows and sees Jacks quality week in and week out
He just needs to do it the game now lol
What skills are you taking about..he's not worth it 100 millions...skills he got doing his hair that all  lol
Brilliant player BUT jack please stop making out your a villa fan mate no villa fan would leave their club they support . Your a ex villa player that’s all
Love Player Boy
No be deflection na goal
Aren't we talking about how beautiful that field is? Omg. Wish we have fields like this in my country.
He looks happy, settled in now and will hopefully shine next year.. ctid come on jack 💙
Overrated n overpaid as with almost all English players. A squad member at best.
Too bad he can’t do them free kicks in a real game 🫠
Your keeper is a useless.
A shame he's only allowed take a touch and pass it straight back down the line to his full back. I remember when he used to be the most exciting player on the pitch. Sold his should to the Saudi oil dollar.
The most overrated player in the world-typical English
What have you all done better than Jack????,yeah NOTHING.
Quality
"legend" please he is far from being a legend...
I'd like to know how much Jack got paid to do this.
He is good. I know that
too bad he couldn't finish like that against real madrid
over hyped
Wasn't even impressed
4:00 boul of wota
Greilish should retire from football and focus on a modeling career.
I like Grealish but hes wasted at City
That shirt is gruesome.
For me he is better than sterling.
Wasted at citeh.....without a doubt..but money talks...
mate have you got fake tan on?
They were called shoot out cards when I collected them
He is most antipatic player in the world !!!
Why is your face so orange
Real footballer’s don’t have long hair dat is a form of distraction like seriously
do foden
Somebody put a real goalkeeper in goals.
Wait what's bo'ohwaer
bro grealish do this things for manchester city
Yes but he never we take a free kick when de bruyne there is
Well, I see why Man City paid what they paid for him
How does haaland have a lower attack score than grealish ??
he cant even start at Man City, Def not worth the money
Jack grealish ain't become legend yet..
The keeper👨🏻‍🦯👨🏻‍🦯👨🏻‍🦯
Jack Grealish is about to take off
Could’ve been a good video… sell out
I never understand these violent when it comes to games they can never make a shot
He just looks like David Beckham
Jack's biggest year of his life coming up!
I love Jack Grealish , but goalkeeper here looks like he’s dying
Those skills best I’ve ever seen on this channel. He’s a genius.
is the host a son of Beckham?
Billy, did you just say a "Legend" 😂
did u see his legs
Fav  jack 😘😘
The amount of dickriding made me click off the video 😂
Why he can't do it with pro players
That goalkeeper is trash.
English version of Figo
During game..he is average
It's all those calves )
Hope this is his season what a player
Było tam Glika postawić to nic by nie strzelił po meczu w Warszawie
Billy looks alot like D.Backham🙂
So grealish is a wonderful player he has everything but people talk about his price and how he isn’t worth is but if you think about it modric's first season on Real Madrid was awful but look we’re he is now and I think Jack can do the same thing he just needs some time to prove himself that he was worth it. Come on on Jack you can do it I think you can do it
SupEr jack10
Gayleash with gayest gaycut
He just needs to put the booze down
just publicity
It's kinda like what happened to Cancelo in 2019-2020 he wasnt that good but in  2021 he turned into a beast
When you bring back a girl from Birmingham & turns out she's a super freak 5:38
Flop ,🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can’t believe how much my man looks like Beckham not grealish the other dude
Your talent is  free kick
truly dont get the hair is this "in" now? this is like a boy band from the 90s. great baller tho
Where pep
You're just amazing!! I want to be like you
He just needs adaption in city and he will play like he did in Aston Villa
Grealish is clearly a talented player but I feel like he does not have that elite mindset. He looks like he would be able to take decent free kicks but you don't see him fighting to take any. KDB has not scored a free kick in like 3 years or so, Grealish should be stepping up to take some.
Grealish is my favorite player. I love grealish
elegant control Grealish
You should get Alino Diamanti on the show :) Underrated freekick / set pieces taker ..
he can scrub becks sons boots for him
Grealish good skills,I learn from him
getting him in a promotion is absolutely crazy lad! cheers!
how tall is jack ?
My lendenged what a player skills and everything ⚽️🥅💙10
Billy you now what your chip was insane
Hes so good wdym man he costs 100M he must be good
this video just shows the absolute LEVELS these world class players are on
I am new on your channel I want to ask you a question that what is your name
Cheeky Jacky. you know..
бездарь за 100 млн
JACK GREALISH
Top class pack opening :|
Goalkeeper Karius
Song name at 1:25 some1 pls ?
7:38 what a touch.
Grealish has as many boys downstairs as he has upstairs.... Lol... Dumbass....!!! 2 nuts floating in the wind.... Funny Funny Funny...idiot
Cmon City!
Grealish: breathes Billy: Isn't he awesome?
Great video
https://youtu.be/Mv0P8VNS2P4
Abdi ithoopia
I love you jack
Multiverse confirm xD
Å
Es tan bueno que no hizo nada ante el Madrid 🤷
We need to Thiago Alcántara ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This man is overrated lmao vini can show him up
He will never shine at city as they are just robots under pep! They have to play a certain way and now all teams are doing it and it’s gonna ruin football
$100M is such a waste.
Should of practiced diving
The last 5 games grealish has been one of city’s player he’s gonna be a big player
100mil worth of trash 🗑
Bill get ya tongue out of jack's arse son it's proper embarrassing fella
He's good... but not 100 million good , you know what I mean?
Just a Nice Guy and insanely talented
Is there much point in having a keeper in these?
I didn't expect tat his voice will be tis loud🧐🔥🔥👌
What I just saw was insane. How is jack not taking city free kicks??!?!
😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
These video's are better without that other melt
amazing skill
He is a counter attacking player🙏
Keeper looked 🔥
great player
whats wrong with the Goalkeeper?? Why dont he do anything?
Just as well he’s decent at football because he’s not the sharpest tool in the box
Jack so seems like he can become a good friend quite fast
If u can't do any of these skills u never played football..
Wow, Jack what a beast for over 150 millions worth of player showing his skills off the pitch , if F2 give trophy 🏆 that could be his first trophy for City
⚽️❤️ Jack grealish is a good shooter my legened10
Grealish + Icardi
Top 👍... 🇩🇪
David Backham is back😂😂👍😄
Why is billy and the other one not doing videos anymore, Billy’s made the decision 😂
O may good
Volley vs West Ham🔥🔥🔥
Free kicks were good, editing can also be good!?
Will be amazing get some professional keepers too, always bad always easy
L3azba
I can stay better goalkeeper than him
The skinniest calves of England vs the thickest calves of the premier league.
If he can do like this every game man city should win the match
Why does this blonde man wear trousers under his shorts?
Wats the card name
Haaland and Grealish combo has potential
Jack is class, your keeper is trash.
Kiper oon
Yu r champ ❣️ jack
Grealish just scored on the volley against west ham and I had To come back to this video and thank you for making him practice that
I feel bad for the keeper, their crushing the dudes dreams.
Unreal😱... the consistency!!!
Match  grealsh 😐 video grealish🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😮😮
Enjoyed this.. love Jack... All the best next season Ynwa
Why are you and jezza doing not doing videos togeather
Pero si jugando es un paquete 😪😪🤣🤣🤣🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Easy on the training ground….needs to do it for real at City
เซียนหรั่ง
Keeper  paid for do nothing 😜
NOT SO MANY SKILLS AT THE BERNABÉU HEY JACK?
THE GOALKEEPER WAS DE GEA, ZERO SAVES
Solo lo ví haciendo un par de jugadas y supe que es un jugadorazo.
Now Maguire
Match attacks used to cost 45p per pack,  so imagine how many packs you could get … I used to cat for that silver CR7🤣🤣🤣
Mendy ? 😉💔
oh damn i just realised Billy looks and sounds like David Beckham
아 머리스타일 ㅋㅋ 쫌 바꿔라
Asif Jack packed shiny Benzema 😂😂😂
If I was Billy then I would have pulled Jack's hair for that extra content
#المترم 🤣🤪
In trainning so good skill but in matchday  something wrong😅😅
I used to love the bubblegum smell opening footy cards 🥰
"He is skill full but no vision." Justinus laksana
Finally some grealish season highlights
Умеет, могёт!
Es gibt auch noch nicht so viele Dinge wie du bist und ich bin auch schon so viel Spaß 😉
Mr Calf
No one talk about best goalkeeper 🥰
Muita mídia e pouco futebol.  Desse nível aí, aqui na série B do campeonato brasileiro, tem uns 100.
gimi d wa a
🎉🎉🎉🎉
nice  jd
why are u bald
Ppl who say Grealish is overrated only judge him on his price tag. The lad is seriously a good footballer, who just needs a bit more time to fully implement in Guardiola´s system.
Gay action man with fake tan
GREALISHHHHHHHHHH‼︎‼︎
one million cuts ... wonder how many attempts it took to take these shots. there are skill videos of other footballers where you don't experience cuts between every single attempt.
Man city is a bad fit for Jack. He needs freedom to express himself. He needs to go back to a smaller team and be the man there. Newcastle might be a better fit for. Would have loved him at Man U but right now we are a mess.
Courtois 🤣🤣🤣 bye bye
How many goals this season? 5?
His talent
This is an advertisment
HENHEN
I also shocked 😂
He ain’t no legend stop the 🧢
Am i the only one that never underestimated his skills before this video??
I’m laughing at these comments back in my head I’m just wondering what you lot thought city was paying him millions of quid for 🤣🤣
Why does billy look like he has been dipped in a bag of Doritos? His face is orange but his hands are white?
good
He packed Benzema🤣
Jack joga demais 🔥
SANDRO TONALI
I miss jeremy and Billy
Es muy muy muy muy bueno... hasta que llega al Bernabeu🤣🤣
I have legs exactly like his. We are leg dopplers.
You need a new Goalkeeper i apply for it 😉
“1 Peter 4:8: Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.”
David Beckam duplikat 😅
he is really great. he just need to improves his visions and IQ.
Love Grealish but hes wasting his time at City. They rarely even start him. He needs to be on a team where his skills are more used.
...a legend, Grealish 😂😂😂
Против Реала надо было такой перфоманс выдавать
Nnn
Grealish the nekt david beckham
He is overrated
Yes villa fans know what he’s capable, can we have him back?
hala madrid
1:22 the shot so beautiful
Corona
These videos are great apart from the annoying blokes who host. What's with the constant fake reactions?
I'm have Grealish in FIFA 22
No jogo não faz nada disso
Jack did amazing on the champions league semifinal game at the Bernabéu !!
Igualito q con el madrid jajaja
I guess swazza jezz was panning the camera this time ay
4:35tormenting you BENZEMA  ￼ ³/¹
Skillful but no vision
presenter needs to grow up , screaming like teenager and copying beckham look its a litle bit worying for grown up man... get a grip man!
Where are you now greashil?
Real didn’t see any of this.
World class skills on the cards and on the pitch all to expected from them editing was bangers for the cards love peace and terkkkers
If Jack Harlow played futbol
Why doesn't he do this in pl??
Oh my god❤❤❤❤❤
Overrated like all English just above average skills.
i love Jack Grealish
Hala Madrid........jajajajajaja
That's a sorry ass goalkeeper
Yes , reserve
Te ngalarti bahasana
Not again 4:30 ffs Jack
Benzema 90 attack????🤣🤣🤣 should be much higher
Grealish packed destiny in his card opening
Villa fan here 😞 hope he finds his feet at city.. although I hated when he left still think the lads class..
Grealish es humo. 3-1 y para casa a ver la final desde el sofá
any footballer can do that
3:10  what's the name of the song
Why you not test ronaldo/messi ? Because 30+  years old
@4:33 what a player he is indeed, sent city packing last night 😭😂
please more videos with grealish and foden please
Think he will be a game changer next season
Mancity out champions league by grilish.
typical overrated English player
Summary of the video: tHIS VIDEO IS SPONSORED BY THIS CARD
Good skills, but not good enough for Real Madrid
Insane calves!🦵🏼
england got some ballers these days grealish foden saka just to name a few 😎
Grealish has more Attack Rating than Haaland?! 😅😅😅
Where is his talent against Madrid when needed??? Sure he is talented.. But if you can't show it in Big matches.. Sorry.
He missed
omg
C'est un monstre ce mec, tout le monde le descend mais attention il peut revenir très fort la saison prochaine, surtout avec pep derrière lui ça peut aller vite ! Je suis pas très fan mais je lui souhaites de revenir en force 👌🏽😁
Still couldn’t beat Madrid tho
No hizo ni mrd ante el Real madrid.  Una decepción ese tipo de jugadores
Que portero tan malo
hahahahahahahaha real madrid reacts sad
Still waiting for the goalie to try
I came here to see his hairs 😍
Quello che ha fatto lui lo facevo tranquillamente a 17 anni senza giocare in premier League...e lo faccio anche ora senza giocare da 10 anni...per chi ha giocato a pallone e lo sa fare stoppare un lancio al volo di 30 metri e rilanciare all altro la palla è di una facilità assurda...i tiri al volo sono un po' più complicato ma non mi pare l abbia messa sotto la incrocio tutte le volte...gli uno contro uno il portiere era sulla linea di porta...praticamente come se non ci fosse
Nothing special...in my opinion...every Kid can do that...
HALA MADRID Y NADA MÁS!!!!!
this didnt age well
Who’s there after Real Madrid 3-1 Manchester City?
Billy that spray tan is awful mate. Great video tho
I Looove really your Shirt's ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
If grealish's is shooting 85, the best in Sunday league is 15
I like those match attax jerseys
Was that guy going for the Donald Trump level of tan? He looks like a carrot.
The technique he has 🤩🤩

il giocatore più scarso in circolazione...
grealish: walks billy: oooohhhhhh!!!
Mahrez 📱🙌
Imagine if he was at Villa now with Coutinho 🔥
https://youtu.be/WKFFP1w474Q
So scripted
Ask him to take a single a simplest shot with his left foot. Look kind a goals Son scores for Spurs - Right foot left foot Don’t matter to him. Greenish -  Highly overrated player.
Mahrez the best 🎩🪄🇩🇿🦾
pero si es malisimo
What a Player 🤩 and he sit always on the bench 🙅🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️
POOR KEEPER LOL
"Hello guys, we are here with Gucci Man"🤑💎
He's underrated but I think with a premier league keeper  he wouldve saved some of those free kicks cause he went  the same way but he's masterclass
That's why we bought him 100 M Pounds
We wanna see all of this in really games
PLANdemic
Cut your hair Jack, like Greizmann
You'd think he be good enough to play for villa based on these clips.
Can't wait to see everyones excuses next season when he doesn't turn into an assisting, goal scoring machine.
Grealish annan uyir love from India😘😘😘
Esse aí é MT mídia e pouco futebol
Who remembers the days when we used to watch them do Messi Vs Ronaldo
Bring Jabs back
If Maguire was a keeper
overated player.
Match Attax: How much paid promotions do you want to do? F2: Yes
Fun fact: Jack’s middle name is Hamish 👍🏼
Ahh the power of editing...
Where do you find all these sorts of video’s please anyone?
He wants too be Beckham
Egypt 👍
Where’s that creep Jeremy lynch
Can I be goalie in your videos.
His calves though
He’d be so hard to play against😭 once he gets in a rhythm at city he’ll be dangerous
Gurpal Singh is a real g he knows what pep does to players
This man has calfs of a god. Holy moly
Damn this guy is FIRE
And in a real match he cant pass anyone and do only bavk passes. Fraud
Your keeper sucks
He is worth 100M
He’s amazing. Bring on the World Cup, England gonna destroy
This guy is like beckham from wish
He looks certified still. I had my doubts. But F2 revealed the player
How da Fuk is he a Legend ??   Not
Jack's legs ahaha damn, I ain't never gona wear shorts again with my chicken legs ! HAHA  5 star skills though, super talented.
Becks lookallike
Jack is underrated 😑 he is really one of the best footballer ever ❤️
Billy u look more like The legend DAVID BECKHAM, i swear to god ,  u look alot like him bro ❤️ anyways love u both Billy and Jeremy ❤️ much love - u guys are one of the best , and as i love football like u guys do - i love all your vids ❤️❤️❤️ Lastly please can i get a pair of boot sign by you and Jeremy, can u make my dream come true? 😅 Please bro
grealish is not as great as you might expect, the high price doesn't guarantee he scores a lot of goals and assists. different from Luis Diaz, the price is standard but the quality is your own judgement.
I can't stop starring at his calves lol
When a footballer care his haircut more then football
them calves tho...
Goalkeeper <<<
Pep just seems to find THE TALENT. Incredible Jack❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
What a Legend , love ya jack UTV
They should have a MATCH ATTACK CARD FOR DRIVING SKILLS😂
Plzz i have subcribed intill 2020 so plzz can i have those cards plzz
He should start for City
Go to Riyad Mahrez to teach you a little fairy magic
Riyad Mahrez
Jack is ridiculously skilled. Born to play football.
BRUH that keeper aint doing nothing at all
Goes to show the standard of the Premier League. This guy is flopping at City right now but is obviously a brilliant player that needs time. Makes you appreciate the likes of KDB and Mane who perform week in week out.
Edited
Great talent, bad hair style
You are saying you compare yourself to a Premiere League player and you were shocked at his skills. Are you serious? You think PL players are not better skilled then regular people?
Why do you not make videos with jezz anymore?
Spray tans a little mutch m8
what is the song when they are talking about the card stats at the start 0:50
Grealish? very skillful but no vision
Beckhams skincare routine is next level, he looks 20 years younger
5:37
5:38
Grealish that volley was cracking no chance to keep us getting it
When he asks him to hit it first time, notice there is only 1 ball with him. When he goes to kick, another appears lol needed more smooth editing to get away with that one or just not have the ball just appear lol
Let Billy yesterday at the Etihad nice bloke
100m
Grealish's calves are so big I had to hook up my laptop to 70" screen to watch this video
bro has sick calves
This lad is worth nowhere near the price paid by City. you are impressed for his "skills"? Any high end professional can do this stuff when out of pressure etc. Literally, not that impressive...
He never once had a pack as a kid
No it wasn’t a deflection
Jack will be massive for City next season, mark my words.
Grealish is a quality player and it's up to City to get that out of him just as much as it's up to him.
Why do footballers always make everything in videos then go out and miss a lot in games
Subscribe
Best video ever
Well done Grealish your free kick are really good
Good video
영국인이라서 실력보다 고평가된 선수
CR7 next
Dude is garbage on the pitch. Anyone can do this in training
Super Jack
jack looks so gay! I think he is, unlucky hes locked in the world of football :(
Surprised he didn't fall over taking those shots.
It’s great to see Paddy McGuinness doing bits for the F2 crew 💪🏽💪🏽
Grealishes technique is brilliant he the best player  I've seen
the goalie is a Christmas cut out
is this video sponsored by Match attax ?? Just want to make sure 🤔
Big fan
No deflection
Such a scripted pack opening lmaooo
The f2 with another banger
Amazing player
These are pretty much standard skill drills touches & technique, Jack is doing here, that any competent professional footballer should be capable of undertaking.  In training skills; Maradona, R9, Ronaldinho, were by all accounts. Mind blowing! 🤯
he's the most teqnique player he deserves to be in a better team
Grealish might win the double this season,
Music in 2:45 please ❤
Bench riding pu***
Billy is a great hype man fasho 🤣
Grealish is an amazing talent, Y'all use the word legend  lightly in England...tbh
These kind of vids make you realise the quality of some of these players
it used to be at least 85 % tekkers before. nowadays its 70 % product placements and weird segments and only 30 percent tekkers. sagde
Billy looks like David beckham big time with that trim
Did you come back from dubai
DUSTY BALLER
Where is Jez
we need mahrez
Do you say legend...????
0:17 legend??  For what? For getting 100m?
This shot is magic.
jack literally just touching the ball " AHHHHHH I LOVE IT!"
Overrated player, Skillful but No Vision  No offense
Jack breathes... Ohh my daaaaays ! Love it
His calves 😮
calf merchant
He plays so good in training and in videos, but not the best in games.
Give number 10 at bernando or sterling or foden
You'd be more shocked if you give him a car.
Invit neymer please🙏 please🙏
The goalkeeper jumps a little late😅
Match attax used to be so good
Nothing Special! Plenty of Bell Ends been Booting Leather around Before this One
He is good there but on the match he’s not so good 😕
The only and biggest skill of englanders is NOT TO WIN A CUP
I wish he adapted to city and performed as well as he did here😭
93 attack? Might be due to his dribbling, passing and shooting combined, but surely thats to high
И возьми какого-нибудь русского игрока из топ клуба премьерке.... Он сделает максимум 20% из всего этого)
Gabriel Jesus > Jack Grealish.
Grealish is a mediocre player 🤮
https://youtube.com/channel/UC8y09xFQM2xutVddm_SHNvQ
When you have too much to drink at a night out 6:07
I open this packs
Jack is so underrated being hidden under de Bruyne and Sterling but is probably already on their level if not above it
“I was shocked” over a 100 million player and what he can do 🤣
How is grealish attack higher than Haaland
Best grealish
You need a better goalkeeper
He should be on freekicks for England at the world cup 💯
The most overated player ever
Legends says: GREALISH still living in Achraf Hakimi pocket.
I think he  got two goals and was assisted in a year with City. He is still a weak player
Man Jacks touch is just immense mate
If Man city had a star striker like Lionel Messi the link up play would be insane
fantastic skills Jack, but very poor effort with the water, you could probably learn something from Gazzas dentist chair
I'm watching this channel after quite a while can anyone tell me where is jez I didn't see him in the recent vids
you look like david beckham bro
Pure talent.
Get Lynch back in the vids!! It’s better with both of you🔥
You were shocked a 100 million player knew how to shoot?
Klopp could made him a monster
First time I approach to this page, but am I wrong or the goal keeper is not that great?
Hi  I am a Man city fan
He is proven at Villa, dictate attack and got a lot of the balls as a free role.. at city he need to be more discipline in positioning and timing, be part of team attack..learn to be efficient with less touch. Once he fully gel with the team..he will run riot.. everything will look too easy then for him.
So edited.  His first time volley was not first attempt
I seriously wonder how many takes it really took Jack to hit that full volley stinger.  I don't doubt his ability to hit it sweet first attempt, but I wonder if the F2 boys tell all these footballers, "Don't worry mate, you can take as many cracks as you'd like, we'll react everytime like it was magic and keep the best one/edit out all the ones that went into row Z."
Everything aside...but why are you looking like david Beckham 😂
wish to win, great skills by jack grealish. big fan from all the wat from dubai.
I tap into this
Mahrez was poor 1st season But Pep knew his quality Pep waited until Mahrez fluent in System Now Mahrez Penalty and Free Kick specialist Pep knows Grealishs inherent qualities As Grealish gets fluent in System Then his special qualities will flourish,best utilised by Pep
Were is Jeremy
bros calves are just amazing tbh
Grealish never skips leg day sheesh
gus why dont the f2 film tpghether now?
Jack will be as good with time as lewandowski Mark my words
If you can cut live games like you cut these videos everyone will look like Ronaldinho.🤣
It is football not soccer
When you loose the next WC to Italy or Spain- don`t cry, just remember this is the brain of your back 3 :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Boo o waver.
Jest tu ktoś z Polski ?
becks is lookin good for his age
3:59 bo'ohw'o'wo'er
For a second I thought it was David Beckham
the best player ive watched yet!!!!!
Wow😮😮😮
Please Next Mahrez i love that guy 💙
How you shocked the guy cost hundred mil
F2 yall need to do a how to in soccer aka football
always better videos without that Jez helmet
Why is billy yellow
great vid! as a video editor knit picking....get those music levels down a bit when theres speaking guys :)
Need to play In MD not attack
117 million £ for this guy? Completely overrated
He is like David
VAR!!! VAR!!! 🤯🤯🤯🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So Haaland has a lower attack than Grealish? Ok.
🗑
Why is sterling rifling free kicks over the bar when grealish can bag like this
The madly lumber summatively clear because cotton subjectively improve via a teeny statement. distinct, spotless sphynx
Don't do this in games tho dose he
You not intelligent and your shoot is power and beutiful. but your gk is lower and lazy. can you up over roll your gk?hhhhhh
Za tyle pieniążków moglby strzelić chociaz jedna taka w klubie :) mi na orliku też takie wchodzą :)
Why is he acting like Jack isn’t a pro footballer
The most wasting money from M. City for one player of bench.
Respect to the Keeper
So underrated
Gucci boy got some tekkers 🔥🔥🔥
10/10
That leg 🦵
Give him those volleys in a match or those free kicks and he'll miss 9/10 times
Oh booowwwaa wattaaaa 😂😂
Pedri algún día llegará a este canal, o es solo para anglosajones?
music is a bit too loud in this video
It is so cool that you met him
Does this video have a sponsor
almost half of the video is a commercial well done my brother
Liverpool are better than city
In the game... No sccor
As much as I can't stand seeing such a bright original seed like Jack at a corrupt soulless club like MC, at least he didn't end up accepting a transfer to Man United. Though tbh where he's playing atm he isn't getting what he needs as a player and he's getting unhealthy influences, he has avoided drowning with the sinking ship that is MUFC. So, there's that, I guess. Would still rather he played for a scrappy, passionate, more locally-connected midtable PL side, though!
just overated player
I think hes ovverrated. Yeah...hes good but he cant skill and dribling
Until this video I though Grealish was left footed…..
w player L club
Harry Potter
Jack is classy, but pls invite Maguire and challenge the real GOAT
The video that Guardiola must watch
This video was terrific
Is jezza gone?
Next Harry Maguire please 🌚
where is jezza
00:09 Bo'oh'o'wa'er 😂
What is the music when he starts hitting free kicks?
unsubscribeing for that
Man doing things here but not helping City with anything 😂 He is the most overrated player in this generation 💯 No matters pep is still winning 🔥
Take a video with Frenkie de Jong
diaz is better🙌
Fair play that was impressive
Riyad Mahrez pliiz
Let's be honest here there are loads of takes in this. Can't be showing a 100m pound player messing it up
C.ronaldo nexx bro
I’m convinced billy wears makeup
Jack Grelisch is a Great Football Player
Savič has already liked this video 🤔💯

Get Tbjzl and Miniminter in a video
Broo let him to say bye...

that guy is not even a keeper , it looks like he is invisible
when you dont defenders you play like this
His technique is off the football encyclopedia -A what?🤣
Daisey Grealish
เซียนหรั่ง
If you look at Mahrez and Gundo when they just came to city and where they are now you wouldn’t underestimate Grealish
Is jack get paid for this?  Or its just a funny day for him
I thought jack with beckham
Grealish : i still dont get it why my club and country not let me to be a freekick taker
Bring Kevin De Bruyne and Let's get shocked🔥
If only he could show this skill at City. But in all seriousness I feel like Jack deserves more playing time by starting more than being on the bench all the time.
Guardiola don't know how to use him
what a video
https://youtu.be/X57zAQ_dUao
GK: Why am I here? Just to suffer?
Haven’t seen a vid in a while, where is Jez?
That goalie is trash
How can you be shocked? He is a professional footballer 🤷‍♂️🤔🤣🤣🤣and cost 100 million he should be able to kick a ball, drip
People forget that Bernardo, Sterling, Mahrez, Rodri, Canselo and so on, also had tough time at the beginning in Man City. They probably need time to understand what Pep wants from them. I have no doubt that Jack will be great at City.
You should hire better goalkeeper
Jack’s Calves are big man😮‍💨
*I will be very happy to see Gheorghe HAGI on your challenges. Keep it Up boys. You are fenomenal* ❤
Grealish is Royalty he is gifted  already a legend at villa His family is legendary there too so he's got it.
The Keeper 🤡
dont reduce the weight of the word legend by giving it random wannabe players
He is a pretty girl...
Please make such videos with Harry Maguire.....You will be amazed by his skills......I guarantee.......#diehardfan
His shots and his touches amazing she should go to Real Madrid I’m by the way I’m a boy
He was sick at Villa but now he’s trash at Man City
Video whit insigne pls
The greatest back passer ever
🔥🔥🔥
City have a free kick specialist ‼️‼️‼️  Need to see him behind those dead balls
Thought the blonde was Beckham
Overrated
why do you not take free kicks for us😔
Gucci
Jack the hype job grealish!
A skill you DON'T see in this video is his VISION: he has the ability to see where the unmarked player is located. He looks and passes the ball to the player best positioned.
No jogo ele n faz issu
Madddddd never doubted jack had tec…🔥🔥
Say to jack cooooool
🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
What happened between him and Jezza?
Man’s calves….
Amy footballer could do some of those first try
In England there’s this place called Cornwall and in Cornwall there is A place called Troon and I paly for that football club
Do some more videos with Jack Grealish please
His best skill is falling two the floor
Hair beautiful but skill 100 m ? 😂
Reeeeeally overrated
cool dude man
This is more fake then my dad saying he loves me
F2 have declined so much they've had to resort to clickbait
What a player 😱
where this goalkeeper plays casualy?
Songs vídeo?
Name of the songs please 🙏🏽
I see first goal for jack this season 😂😂
Were s Jeremy.  I miss him bring him back pls.
Please support my football page 🙏🏾 ❤.
He is unique to any other football player in the world.  His ability and speed is unbelievable  He was phenomenal at Villa last season
Underrated talent
Legende what a joke 🤣🤣🤣
That's good you know 🏆
suprised he wasnt diving
Were is jermy
Class baller one would say
Who's in goal Cal the Dragon?
oscar award to the goalkeeper
Legend has it he's still brushing his hair to this day.
Messi
Not seen him play for villa in ages. Wtf
너가 영국인이 아니였다면 K리그 주전정도 실력임
English fans here overating the guy again as if he's going to be Messi next season🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️hold on your horses he might not even be playing just like this season...he's a genuinly average player thats it💯💯
He is a traditional number 10 player, but unfortunately City doesn't play with his kind of profile.
You can't judge player by one season look modric 2012 he was baddest transfer market in spain   Hope he will rocked next season
Do it in matches
I don’t know what people expected to see from champions league caliber players I don’t know why people are shocked that his technique is “that good” just cause he doesn’t start or get statistics right now in a team like Manchester city lol
If he could do this in matches...
Jesus loves you!!
Dont underestimate him, next season pep will turn him into a machine
F2 can we have another_can you do this?
Did Billy and jezza devorce
Sack the keeper 😂😅
You have to wonder why they denied him a penalty against Italy despite begging to take one…….
Where is your brother?
Wow forte
Billy n jack 🤌🏻
rugby pitch behind 👌👌
Look at those calves   🤯
100 Million, how are you shocked
At least Maguire than this guy 🤭🤌🏿
Get past a player cut back and pass it back. All he's done since arriving at Man City.
If EA meets this goalkeeper,his OVR will be 30
Please next time bring rice west ham 🙏
Anyone else found that the standard/quality and caliber of their vids has just gone downhill?  I mean I’ve been a big f2 fan for years now and just find it’s not the same energy, enthusiasm and just general enjoyment of the vids on the channrl
Please next time Rice
hello there
Great
The only thing is grealish is in Man City and he got beaten by liverpool
Is it only me who thought the guy was theo hernandez in the thumbnail
Sorry Mahrez but Grealish should be on free kicks
You should get Lord Harry Maguire to be in your vids, see if you're able to outclass him 😝
Beckham vs grealish
JG's touch and control is superb. I think the keeper had lead in his boots or were those shots faster than they looked on screen? Also, JG was quite out of breath and the training was not that intensive, was it? No questioning his skill though.
Pep will definitely make him a better player....just need some time
Idol Jack grealish 🕶️

I’m related to him
Unbelievable footballer
kamil glik

Love Grealish but rated over Haaland and Benzema in attack?
Grealish pemain harga 100 juta pound yang gk bisa apa apa..semoga lekas di jual oleh mancity...😩

Look at my name
The world of football has seen so many overrated players , but the English ones are just world class overrated , thanks to the English Media  Edit : Billy introduced Grealish as "The Legend" .....Euuukay
100 million for this
jack 100 củ
You look like Beckham...
Goalkeeper was so easy
why are they apart
Play with saka
Siapa itu Jack grealis, henen mah engga tau
JUST CALL NEYMAR
overrated
Pep should put him for penalties
Gnabry the twin of "the weekend" Billy the twin of D.Beckham I the twin of "All of you"
Get this man behind close range freekicks at City.💙
Omgggggggg its gh
SUBSCRIBE TO THE WINGROVE FAMILY!
i’m glad this is what he’s doing for the 100 million we paid him …. i’m jp love him #longlivetheking
8:27 that keeper was going in his head like" why r we here .just to suffer"
Jacky🚀🚀🚀
He is the player ever even better than Harry kane he just needs some more game time
Jack Grealish when he sees Billy have the Foden haircut
Shame Jack wasn't able to play like that against Liverpool at Wembley on the 15th
Pliz Mahrez 🔥
We Don't know about this  https://youtu.be/ekh4yXU_gOg
Jack grealish is just underrated
They gave him 10% more rating i reckon cos he promoted them. No way hes better than that haaland monster.
nobody gonna talk about how jack's card is better than messi's. Ok fine
https://youtu.be/UtphOq3GS1I  I use to be a goalkeeper ☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️
He doesn't move himself nor does he move tha ball
His good just overprice
You are very good at the ball
Anyone underestimating him is braindead.
the calves on the bloke
7:44 Jack is now comfortable and friends with billy at this point
Billy u made him score against liverpool
Bisa gitu tendangan nya , keren banget
*_Yesterday is history Tomorrow is a mystery today is a gift that's why its called the present. - Master Oogway_*
why is f2 gk so trash
Anyone else got that Jonny sins ad 🤔
🔥🔥🔥🤠😎
*It's crazy how much time and effort you put into these videos. Huge respect. Keep up good work.* ❣❣
WE wante Riyad Mahrez
I just realized there is a 13 years age gap between them. yes, billy is 39
Le gardien n'est pas là
Instead of fockit money
wonderful💙💙💙
all right mates grealish is good, but we need to respect also the goalkeeper. #respect
There's never a goalkeeper😐
Adama traore vs Billy batller speed?
Why they are still in Underground ???🔥🔥🔥 https://youtu.be/X5IEP3RKRiY
He's good an one of us can win Jack grealish card
https://youtu.be/BRPTnAu8yYo
I remember watching him in the villa training ground he was always good with freekicks he used to dip em in all of the time. He should try sometimes for city he's really good
https://youtube.com/shorts/OD1Iazb5L0Q?feature=share
The talent and ability is definitely there with grealish. He needs to try and adapt to peps style and be abit more selfish in front of goal.Pep is ruthless if he dont see the hard work and grind.he will get rid of you. Keep away from the night life and drinking. Concentrate on football and training like a beast. Jack will become a great player for man city.
https://youtube.com/channel/UCEj7mZ6tKKyZsL5tSvrDc8Q
Man so inspiring
If he doesn’t fix his lifestyle he is gonna be a wasted Balotelli with tons of talent.
Hi
Hi
mahrez
PROPER TEKKERS INNIT😅🙌🏼
Class player 👌🏻
we need Mahrez again plz 😭
I can tell they both English eeeeh!😉😁
Hi there. If u wanna be saved today read this. The Bible says we are saved by believing in the Gospel by realising we are sinners Romans 3:23 and hell is the result of our sins Romans 6:23. And to go to heaven we need to be perfect revelation 21:27. But God says we can't earn our salvation because we aren't perfect but we can be saved through the blood of Jesus alone Ephesians 2 8 9 so we  have it by Grace.  we simply believe on Jesus Christ's   death burial and resurrection saved us. 2Corinthians 5:21 and 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. And it's only by believing John 3:16, John 6:47. And from This we know Jesus alone saved us from our sins  not by our works as Ephesians shows but by Grace through Faith in Him. And we can know we are saved through 1John 5:12-13. Have a good day.
City jack come on your brilliant keep it up
E
He’s really good
Grealish are very skillful player but he has no vision in football
And I actually did get the card
1:36 grealish does it in training, mane show him How its done in a game
The keeper is terrible
Grealsh was really strong but the goalkeeper is very bad
i don't understand why he's so hated to be honest
Jack Grealih
Is it just me or is Jack grealish like actually JACKED??
Bring David Beckham pls like this comment to let know
A 10 minute video containing 3 minutes of Jack kicking ball. Great job 👏👏
Why  can't he do that for England!?!?
Grealish or saka?
Jack grealish best in Manchester city ❤️❤️❤️❤️😍
https://youtu.be/eftruF4wQi0
a Squirt with a bottle?  Where is the high grade water guns with the F2 Budget?

I feel bad for the goalkeeper :'(

Video with mahrez
Where was this against Liverpool 💀
i love his voice.
The Fact that the guy with white hair looks like David Beckham...
Can you give away some football boots
We want more vedios
"underrated" city brouht him for 100 milione🤣
Bo'oh''o'wa'er!
Ive never been impressed by a pro footballer in a YouTube collab till this
Imagine how much money match attax must have paid grealish for this
Wow good England chose him he is a warrior with the ball elegance and technical gifts love lads
Has anyone told you you look and sound like David Beckham?
lol
Waste of a 100 mill
what a stupid hairstyle
Billy’s such a great hype man 😂 his touch and shot is prob on par with Jacks
3-2 liverpool GODO
Where is the comment of Grealish
I'm now covered in Match Attax stickers head to toe. Great advert.
I feel really feel sad for the keeper. It's he's not even there
English hype lol 93 attack l my nuts
The legend
keeper has a high ping
From here maybe Pep should trust Grealish to take the freekick because his instincts are sharp
Respect🙏
Don
waw
Keeper lol🙄
Love all the vids keep it up👍
I am youtuber
gucci man good
Can i have it pls I always watch all of wingrove f2 freesylers
JACK GREALISH he is one of my fav plays because he’s English like me
baller but massive flop at city lmao
Could of picked a better keeper😂😂
Great, i come from Vietnam. Love all
overrated af
Billy looking more orange than Donald Trump 😂😂
Skillfull but no vision
I don't know why they are using a goal keeper.? I feel sad for him.
So what u guys think about Kane 💭 Definitely I would like him to come to city 🧠✌🏿
Hhhhhh
Give me the woaa
He obviously has the potential to work at peps preferred level, it's just a matter of the club getting a proper striker and whether he can maintain the level pep wants in his players.
Tbh one of the wall dummies as a goalkeeper would have been more effective than my boy there
The strength in jacks legs is overwhelming, I imagine that strength reaches right to the top of his legs and he knows what some guys want !!!!. I do.,
dead balla
Jack had a team played around him, now he's just a part of a team, that's why he have issues
still wait for Totti on this channel. Whole rome will come on YT watching ur video im sure lmao
Whoever is reading this...You are going to be Successful....  Universe got your back
3:25 “You have a keeper in goal” 🤣🤣
Baller
He’s amazing when he tensces his calf’s
He seems just a down to earth typical nice villa fan 👍👍🇬🇧🇺🇦
His talent is off the charts. Fantastic technique, composure, everything. Proper baller.
jackgrealish is my favourite player but i didn't know he had this ability pep should put him for free kick. he is as good as bill
Wow! Love your page! Let’s connect?
Jack breathes*  Billy: OH MY WORD HES RIDICULOUS
Grealish showing levels in this video 😅 we hope to see more of him going into the next season, he brings a unique style to football 🙌⚽️
If you didn't  now that city lost against  Liverpool
That's why he's 💯 Million absolute different level
Loool who noticed haaland beside grealish on the wall? He's definitely coming to City lool
אוווווווווויייי
Make a video with Bruno Fernandes
Omg hey
He’s a really good player I live in Australia so in July can you come in July because there’s a Man U V Melbourne but I go for Man U
Loved it  His calves 💥💥💥💥 👍👍👊👊
His first touch is sick 🔥.. By the way he scored against Liverpool   today
This is the closest we can see billy meeting becham which we all wanted
vs ATM he didnt play like this...😩😩
1:40 Look at this guy
"Legend" hahaha
Noooooooo
We're here for the calves 👌
This shows that he's just "underrated" eben for 100mil. Just take a look at Griezmann or João Felix🤷🏻‍♂️
I don't think it was a deflection idk maybe im wrong what do y'all other guys think let me know
It should be huge.... For Grealish to meet Billy wingrove...
5 goals
kissing his ass so much😂
Jack Grealish is excellent at attack
6:08
"a few packs from the shop" same Jack same
Probably most hated pl player after Harry Maguire, people called it overrated in his first season, people saying in the match vs Atlético highlights, that wants to punch on his Gucci face as well. I mean, I cannot understand why, this guy is pure class, he'll be a beast with Pep, he just need adaptation
Here before 1 million views.
As a villa fan grealish has always had a disgusting volley
Tell him to shoot that well on fifa i use hus one to watch card a d that 79 shooting sucks
Natural beast
Jack Greallish nice
I would like to see F2 stop "Wo Ho" everytime a footballer scoring against statue Goal keeper xD hahaha
800th comment
Goalkeeper???????
Why can’t he perform well irl anymore
Cadê os brasileiros
One the best players
Why didn't u ask bout his calves " so one thing I noticed is that you've got really big calves , tell us bout how u got so big calves " that would be a good question
(3_2) 2022 😂😂
He suited villa
Those CALVES
Like how you cut out all the saves the youth keeper made very realistic
I think pep has a process for him. He likes to take on players and dribble. But peps style of play is more touch and pass quickly. Give him another season and he’ll be a beast
8:15  song?
sometimes the ass licking is a bit too much.
#1 trending sheesh god job
Pep will do to him exactly what he did with kimmich at Bayern
He's had more game time here than his whole season at city
3-2 😁. Liverpool is going to win all the trophies this seasone
the cut back merchant man💯💯
Jack still a snake
grealish is the most over rated english player in the last 10 years. he's made zero impact for city. i honestly think he's only buzzing because he has the david beckham look... but beckham actually worked hard on the pitch. All well and good to do whatever this is, but if you don't do it on the pitch who cares? He was work 50-60m's at most - and thats being generous.
The most expensive bench warmer right here
"It is not like this  obviously you have a goal  keeper in goal "🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I got one G
100mil flopp
MATCH ATTAX TOOOO DA MOON......
Je just need more adaptation at City
Sound de bruyne for training  pls!!
bit crazy calling him a legend at the start of the video. Certainly close to that with Villa fans but he's no where close to a legend yet
bolleouota
Why doesn't he play like this in city matches
Dead keeper
Those volleys were a joke
Armando Broja pleace
Please film with Mahrez
Worse decision he ever made going to city.
He is my favourite! Great goal today Jack!😍❤
I did it
but Joe Gomez got robbed after fifa 20 video. Should've given him 99 shooting
Your keeper is so basic
He just scored in today's match vs Liverpool 🔥
If you want to see behind the scenes head over to the wingrove family channel there a family of legends #🐐
Aye no disrespect but that keeper ain’t it😂😭
Grealish is a super good player
4:00 BO’OH’O’WA’ER
Hello
He can score here every free kick but in match, there YouTube things 🤷🏻‍♂️
Hi
Done
Done
No deflection
He’s literally been bought for £100 million, I would expect him to have serious tekkers
why don't you use a goalkeeper?
1:25  Didn't see that coming 💯🔥
Jack grealish did brilliant shots at the start of the video and you did brilliant throws well done    🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃
Ben foster got me thinking “would ben save that?” Whenever I see a football video now
if only he played this good for City 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
No
90 % promo is pushing it a bit :D
lol trying to find in the fa cup
Billy can i have the Box with fotball cards pleass😏Thank you but it need be in norway🇳🇴 Ok
Little did we know he would score for city just after
W2S music yesssss
Grealish is a different gravyyy😤🔥
Why don’t jack play like that in games
Don’t call him a legend please lmao
How is he NOT on free kicks at city?
I have The Grealish hair style lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
WOW!!
6:07 give you the what??
Happy Easter f2 and I wish a happy  happy Easter to jack grealish I will be getting some match attax extra on Easter hopefully I get a grealish stars of 2021 card and Ronaldo  101 unbeatable  and messi out of this world
Happy Easter everyone when it comes :)

grealish should try to take a fk for man city
What is the music called that starts at  2:22
😕 why dont he play like this for city i know he scored toddy but still
There was know deflection
It's Jack Grealish. Can't be shocked by anything he does.
Love Jack❤️❤️ big fan
His firsttouches are unbelieveable🫠
Only if he could do that in city
QUERO VER DESAFIAR O LUVA DE PEDREIRO NA "CHAPADA".

Thanks for the video. I appreciate jack for his time
So glad the editor turned up the volume on the music so I couldn’t hear them talk 👌🏼
I love Jack grealish... ❤️❤️
Why did he bottle it today then if he has that many skills 😂🤦‍♂️
Bro man don’t criticise   Jack he does not suck and he is a baller and a g🔥🔥🔥🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿keep it up Jack some advise:please join Liverpool to become a legend hope you qualify for World Cup 2022
Jack showed he's worth 110 million  , IN F2 😅😂 and f2 has the best goalkeeper
Most exciting English player
I m not flexing but i got Jack Grealish
Grealish looks like a carbon copy of David Beckham!  Who all agree?
Do with Messi
Confidence from grealish 🔥
Make a video with Riyad Mahrez
how do i win the cards
Bruh,Grealish just scored🤣🤣🤣
Pov grealish just scored
Trash😂
POV youre watching this at half time 3-0
Come on Liverpool come on Liverpool come on Liverpool come on Liverpool come on Liverpool come on Liverpool
Anyone watching this when city are losing 3-0 against Liverpool? Well yeah I am and I'm not happy 😒
With just more adaptation to city they can bring the grealish we all knew from villa.Otherwise great player
Jack seems like i guy you would want to hang out with 🤙🏼
It wasn't even the 93 attack one though?
Amaizing volleys 🥴
❤❤❤
Overated
Shoot with Messi.
Why he doesn't shot free kicks like that in a real games, so many players do well in training but when it comes to a real game they lost 50% of their focus under pressure
Please can I have the cards
His hair is nice isn't it
At least his English is better than Kane
When i see jack grealish i can only see his calves of his whole body
Erling Haaland, Hala Madrid !
I love this guys content
NO DEFECTION
I love you so much and jack
Are u a clone of david beckam u to,s are looking same😱😱😱i thought its david beckam and clicked this vdo
After pep watching this grealish now is top XI for the squad and he now is the new free kick taker
A £15m rated player sold for £115m .. just English thing
Billy I watched you since I was one keep up the good work you and jack are good ❤️❤️
Too many ads
Keepers shocking
Jack’s volley was nuts
Riyad Mahrez Tiger
This is such a fire video
Fun
Man city didn't spend 100M for Grealish for nothing
Grealish Is Legend , from Italy.
Only need Suiiiiiiii
How tall is grealsih
Damn that's some skill.
Nice !
Best player in the world jack grealish just really want that card Please
Pity he just can't do it in a city shirt😔
Play similar for us City fan
Wish F2 made OG videos, nowadays is just a sponsor with a footballer not as good content tbh.
#win#matchattack
That was a deflection
I think he'd be more successful as a Center Foward than a wiger. He's got physic, exceptional ball control and shooting ability.
The only bit of good skill he has done all season.
ya
The goalkeeper was humiliated
نطالب بالترجمه للعربيه
The song from sidemen reacts
The song tho😂😂
What he said is facts as a player I always hear "train the way you play"
SOMEBODY SEND THIS TO PEP !!!!
in my personal opinion, you need a stronger goalkeeper
Been waiting so long
Great vid! Now you should do one with Haaland!
Don’t forget our super Jack
Im from Algeria 🇩🇿🇩🇿🔥🔥
What a vid
this is why he's on my fifa lineup
Dont underestimate him, next season pep will turn him into a machine
WALAHI DO THIS FOR CITY PLEASE
Hes an amazing player with sick skills!!!!!💯🔥 Man City just has to give him more attention cause he is a calss winger with amazing potential💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥!!!!!!!!!! Amazing vid as always ❤👍
Ronaldo?
He is quality. Can’t be doubted.
Jack Grealish : Worth the 100 Million. 👌❤️
Next season he will be fire  trust me
People are fasting  Man be considerate
IS A BALLER MAN THAT CONTROL ELITE
nice hair jack✂️
jack is a legend?
i was waiting for savic
Jacks first touch is a joke
One of the most overrated English players since Walcott.
can you do a video with leo messi pleassssss
Mahrez pleuse
Bo oh of wa er…..
How come he can't do this in a proper match 🤔🤔🤔🤔
2:30 what is the song name?
What a lad
Why does the keeper even try,y'all don't pay him enough 😭
He is anUnderrated player.
Savic wants to know your location.
What if both of them swapped their hairstyles , it will be hard to differ who is grealish and who is the host 😂
Price tag should have been 35 Max end of discussion
My Favorite player in the world..
video and mahrez
Good luck for your match today hope you win
Love that it was just billy makes it so much better
Nowadays mentioning kane has been regular 😅
Jack grealish my name is jack I’m on my dads ipad  (baller)
Im literally like billy wingrove because I’m left footed and a massive Tottenham Hotspur supporter
Are he gara starting ci with Real Madrid jack
Who else want to meet jack?
Sheeeeeeeèèəşh
wo'a
Not bad for a bench warmer
Grealish got his hair pulled
Realy Great video
Jack's first touch is actually immense🔥
He should be taking city free kicka from now on 😁
who is this gk
I really wanna see Grealish score a hat trick 🎩💪
I had an ad pop up on beat drop 🤬🤬😭😭😭
Wait what...? He said he's a legend ? Since when ?
pls can i get the match attacks im 9 pls
why dont they invite Savic as well
#win #win #win #win #win#win #win#win#win
i cant go on instagram #win
Awesome video!
The Boy has skillz ⚽️👍🏻
😱👽
u should go for a keeper who knows how to play as a keeper
Can i have some of those pack
But Jack is not a Legrand  yet
One of my favorite he will be a goal monster next season
Is Great but Del Piero >
"gimme the wa'ah" - Grealish
He just needs more adaptation at City, especially if City have a sharp striker like Haaland, I'm sure he's potential will certainly be seen as an assister and proper winger at City.
We’re does it say how to win
? Was not even the same card
After grealish moved to city, everyone can now ser hes the most overrated englishman in history, literally has achieved nothing
That volley was 🔥
💙💙💙Great video with Jack💙💙💙
the keeper was very dodgy
loved this video so much. jack’s skill and ability is insane and I love the pack opening bit of the video as well 😂
So obvious that this sponsorship with matchattack is so forced 😂. Asking him did he ever dream of being on a card about 3 times
that did not have a deflection because i have good eyes
Keeper didn´t even tried
Definitely worth 100 Mill.
What
I love how he said Bo'al O wo'er
#win
If city manages to sign Haaland. Then city's gonna have the beast team.
I new it was going to come out I saw a vid on Billy’s family
please be with kevin de bruyne for the second time
🤢
Today is my birthday
Shoulda cut his hair for a challenge
H his lovely we just need him to be scoring for us ... come on Jack
100mln is obviously is good
You people overate English players only  Its full of crap
Sheeesh Siu
Chance goalkeeper
Great player, but with '90 hair cut in 2022... 😑
I subbed ,liked and put the notifications on
SO IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT JACK GREALISHS THIGHS
Invite Cristiano Ronaldo to do this challenge
Jack is a great player thats all i can say
Idk why but grealish looked a bit pale
Play like this in a proper game
For someone who can't get game time, he's still got it
Never thought he had that much of skill and control...fair play to him
আমি বাংলাদেশে বাস করি আপনি বাংলাদেশে আসেন
മലയാളി 👇
If u see this give it a like 👍
GREAT VIDEO I LOVEE ITTT  😍
No more satisfying technique than a side volley with a low trajectory or backspin riser
Bro which which songs you add in this video?
His freekicks would never go in in a real match
LOVE FROM INDIA
Villa grealish > City grealish
Calves bigger than biceps💯
No reflection
So why is Kevin on free kicks again 😅🤯
At 26 years old he has alot of potential
why is you head orange
Yeees, my favorite player is Grealish💪💪💪
Damn, I didn't realize!!! .... Jack Grealish is probably one of the most underrated players in the Premier League, his skills here were as Bill said ridiculous and simply out of this world but come on Jack, you should have done the whole bottle 😂😂😂🤦‍♀️
nice vid
mohammed camara next
get joao felix
ive liked subed and shared the video 😍🥰
Many people are shaming Grealish for not doing as well as expected at City, but honestly all he needs is a little time to adapt, and I think he could be a fantastic player. 🔥
He is just underrated
Is it just me who kept comparing both Jack's and Billy's calves throughout the video?
Do not miss the great football and sports videos on the menu⚽️👑🤴 New video uploaded😱🔥🤙 Please support🙏😘😍
New six pack tutorial video🤴👑 Uploaded do not miss😱🙌💯⚽️
He is beautiful and amazing in her tiee
Most overrated player on the face of the earth
Billy at the last min. I love it the back round song mate . Can you put that even the next time !! That video was a massive video.
Why is Grealish a legend? 🤔
Waste of money
That's why 100 mill is worth
I love everything of him😍
That card is about to be worth a cool 50 grand
Finally
좋은영상 감사합니다
Zlatan pls 😍
this videos budget was 100M
Same day as the legendary game  Man City vs Liverpool I personally love Man City as they are going to win this match and be top of the table
https://youtube.com/channel/UC5wfSEZpeLvAgYOLDaSSrNw
Should Jack be traning for the man city and Liverpool match
premier league player, premier league standards
imagine pep sees this vid
At school, shineys were worth 3 "normal" ones.
No deflection
Great video, but get some better keepers mate.
Jack!!! :)
Hope he didn't call you a c***
jack and billy is such a good duo
Jak c'ést le meilleur jeuor
Why can't he do that in a game😂
I wil tas  grealisch kart
no offence
Trotters background music
i love foden beter
100 million euros to be messi in training and fight in matches.🤣
Hell nah
nice
Is this david Beckham?
Damn now I understand he's worth
Do you pay them to have them on the video?
so  so  so  good ！！！☺
I would not give him 93 more like 83
I' remember that he is good but his shot is better than his card
Jack gearlish power 🥵
Jack kicks like a girl
Bring mahrez plz
I want he’s back
he suits man utd style of play more, they need a winger who could carry the ball up for them. him and sancho went to the wrong parts of manchester
I see Mahrez has been giving u first touch lessons 😅💙
jack “tekkers” grealish
Grealish gonna show this vid to pep for more game time
half the video was about that dumb card packs thing. If they did more with Jack, I think it would've been a better video tbh
So we're gonna breeze over the fact that the goal keepers in these videos are either bare trash or blatantly allowing the ball to go in🥱
How to win?
Aszzzzz
HES AMAZING
Jack freekick taker?
Jacky GREALISH
EARLY
Overrated player
He is very kind 🙏🏽❤❤
F2 the best 😍😍
City are playing to day aswell
step by step, he will prove haters that he's not overrated🔥💪
Great video with Jack so insightful. Keep up the phenomenal work.
Very boring
Who would've thought jack Grealish was a professional footballer?
I don’t want to admit what atrocities I’d commit to have those calves
good luck against liverpool
FYI This was the exact place Billy brought his son Roman to meet him. Bill addresses an F2 video in his video in his other channel. Subscribe!
Kalo pas pertandingan biasa biasa aja main nya

can you do a video with messi 🐐?
hello
Pep wants to set Grealish a set piece taker for today's match
He just needs more adaptation at City, especially if City have a sharp striker like Haaland, I'm sure he's potential will certainly be seen as an assister and proper winger at City.
Jesus what a video well in bill
Why does jack the guy I met look so grey in the pack opening
Misunderstood
O yeahhh Jackie grelish
One thing I don't understand is why goalkeepers always look like they don't want to make a save...
Incredibly talented.
mahrez
I thought grealish's hair was injured
Savić>Grealish
How didn’t he bring up his calfs
Jack is so good
do one with ruben neves
Good to see F2 being back
I was playing with Jack Grealish on fifa yesterday
bam boom
f2 with a stupid gk as usual
He should of chose Ireland😪
I think the keeper is mizo
Guys You are the best I hope you will make a video also with a footballer called Lorenzo Insigne
Gotta be a new free kick for city
Io avrei messo un portiere ancora più scarso
He is just🔥
Grealish should leave mancity ASAP, he's just getting rotten on d bench, and he's got huge potential if he's given enough chance on shine 😓
Burmarike
Jack grealish ain't a legend 😂
