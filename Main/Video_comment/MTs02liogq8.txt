dark's fall off needs to be studied 💀
What banner and avatar border is musty using
I love dark 🤩
it's hard to belive he is just 14year old may ALLAH bless him
musty 1v1 me
6:38 that was so stupid, you could've scored that if u did not go back.
You need to 1v1 him again now , after 2 years . To see who has inproved the most.
dark isnt  14  bruh
who is just now watching this in 2025
Es geht aber wnn mann das zu viel macht klappt das nicht mehr zum beischspiel bei mir
He was 12 at that time
Anyone here in 2025? Also is it only me waiting for him to see the replay when dark hits like a crazy save
11:19 musty tryn not to tilt
Who’s in here in 2025?
So his name is dark and you said this dude is different?
Bro giving poppy playtime vibes
Wow
10:55
it may be me but this looks scripted
guys, I don't think he was really taking this as a normal 1v1
I wanna see dark? VS RUBII
Light work lol *cap detected in this comment*
Musty: "I'm definitely going to get clipped on"  Clipped on in the first five seconds
i’m in danger😂
its crazy how he's only 14 and does stuff like that bro will be better than zen in the future
Scripted
Do you still push this eSwap stuff? I bought the thing so I could swap out broken sticks if needed.  Now all the replacement sticks are "conveniently" out of stock on Amazon and the Thrustmaster sight. But of course the more expensive package is available!   S C A M     You should not support these guys
But would he beat osuea?
AI
Dark                 Osuea 👇                      👇
yo @amustycow can we 1v1, im a c3 and i want to 1v1 to see how i fair against you!, my user is doomsy.
it'd be great to see 1v1 of dark vs squishy
im ten and imchamp1
how gud are you
hey
7:02 “ bro live in saudi so let’s change it to a cold map ?😅
i’m 14 and hoping by 15 i’m dark😂
Hey musty you should try out his camera setting on yt they're INSANE even I am shocked that I hit a triple reset on plat
POV rocket league now: you load into ranked you play someone with skill like musty. You try take a break from ranked to go to casual you vs dark 💀
You youngins have dark now back In my day we had osm peaking in comp 1s
Me Vs Dark  Time started:  3  2 1  Me left the game banned for 5 minutes.
Bro is casually hitting triple resets lol
zen is way better then him
Zen isn’t proud!!!! Lol
11:18 “haha I’m in danger!!!” Got me dying
He's 14???? Bro how? I literally started playing when I was almost 14, how is bro already a mechanical goat and barely in high school?
bet i could score on dark
Exactly
"xd thats how you know he's 14 brouwhhh"
What if dark is rw9
im c3 and i would clap u in a 1v1
Dark is confident and hard commits because he knows he can get back in time
is he on controler or kbm?
Nice musty
This aged pretty well tbh no one pays attention to him anymore really
Musty is the only one best player in the league
Dark is better than zen
dark is not even that good zen can clappppp dark easily
Time for a rematch!!!! He has improved big time.
hey musty wanna play?
I’m knowing dark before he’s gonna be a superstar pro😀
i knew about dark but i didnt know he was only 14
Dark : Great Attacker Musty : Great Defender  Game #1
Video idea We need to see dark vs Zen cus they both play Eu
Play against A7md he is Iraqi , way better than Dark
It's been a year since this vid and I've been watching a ton of 1's recently and I have to say dark is the all time fastest player I've ever seen. His only downfall is counterattacks since he goes for insane shots it is easy to counter attack if you can save it.
don't tell me you play with this controller
I want to see him play Zen
To be fair, this is really good, but he ballchases 24/-7 and only goes for resets, pogos and musty's. As i said before this is not hating but just saying my opnion. He is really really good like you can see he has the mechanics.
The opponent you get when you're about to rank up In 1s:
Love my eswap, best investment I’ve made in gaming, besides my pc lol
11:22 no second reset but he has a jump. Someone should look into it. Frame by frame.
Dark is The Mbappe of rocket league cuz his young, fast and mchanical in rocket league
Need a new video with him he is more insane now!
musty forgot his gfuel
We need to see this guy 1v1 Zen
1 year later after this video was uploaded,trading is removed!!!😭😭
sponsed shit
bro's bouta be the new Zen
honestly i would pay to see dark against old pros like squishy, first killer, justin
Bro was wasted by a youngster💀
Yeah of musty paid dark for this cause dark is much better it's so obvious that dark is trolling and freestyling in every situation.
This is literally like an anime fight lol... You are a very good player who played against the best of the best, but then there is a villain who comes to eat your ass who has been training for like 10 000 years and he is so fast and so good that you have never seen anything like that and you are trying to figure out how to be better lol.
How many times did musty say WHAT? lol
1v1 ZEN
Game 2 was kinda racist lol😂
U think musty goes for Israel
i like how on 4:27 he beats musty with his own flick
hes the zen of the past
Holy shit, it’s scary how you can watch a literal RCLS x champ struggling against this guy, it just puts it into perspective. This kid disrespected Musty with the ‘xd’ after a play too nonetheless 😭 Shit was crazy! This is one of the few games where I see someone far better than me and I actually feel inspired to grind. Maybe I just got a touch of the ‘tism, a dash or a sprinkle if you will, but I’ll have random spurts of weeks where I’ll solely dedicate my life and energy to just learning everything about one topic or practicing one thing, whether it’s a video game or guitar or learning to code/game dev… But Rocket League is just one of those games where I can’t help but need to play it at least fairly often. Just wanted to share my love for the game, even tho it was kinda random. ❤
Do a updated version with zen please
I’m telling y’all he bouta be the new zen
Who would win dark or zen in a 1v1?
for polish comunity video is 21:37 long
Video idea:2v2 with dark please do it
Is he muslim
And now its zen xD
Bruh did he smuggle an Xbox and internet tower into Saudi Arabia im pretty sure they’re in poverty
Imagine his prime bro... at the moment we can prob say he a rival for zen 😭
His name is Dark, and he is good  Im Light, and Im bad
Rfook Dallas gR e
Free 1s ha
4:02 Evil laugh 😈
I love how this video was made on my birthday 🎇🎇
11:30 he just jump for the ball and get an impact from it and it look like that
He only know how to pogo and not save boost and air dribble
He is ok like me just play for freestyle
Dark vs Zen...
19:36 what touched the Ball for it to go up???
Isn’t this fake? At 19:34 he doesn’t make a connection with the ball and there is plenty of other points in the games where weird things happen but could just be lag
My man saw the pogo into the musty and started opening he’s score board 😂😂😂
I have never seen someone play this way. That pogo maneuver is crazy.
Musty when u play against any pros atleast have 12 boost saved in kickoff(before u hit the ball) thats what dark does so thats how he is faster on kick off whenbtaking boost
I PLAYED WITH DARK AND IT WAS A GOLD COMP MATCH HE WASNT MECHANICAL
He looks like he's using a bot
this dude was just saudi evample xddd
I DIDNT KNOW HES 14. DAMN
What is dark’s decal the new v1 or the old?
You had him a few times. Your problem is that you were not fast enough because you're expecting him to win, which caused you to be on the backfoot and wait more. I have a hunch that your general problem is a lack of speed has compared to the best pros. You need to think less and feel more adrenaline 💪
I mean yeah he's really good mechanically but look how hard he's trying to actually score a goal using an absurd amount of boost for every play its not really practical the only reason he can get away with it is because he also is smart and has game sense but if he didn't try so hard to be super flashy I feel like he could be a much better player than he already is and be one of the top pros in rl history if he didn't focus so much on trying to score a free style goal every time he goes for a shot
Dark always wins kickoff
Play against sam from Saudi Arabia
Bro cannot be stopped😮
He's 14... Imagine he had more experience...
r u able to get in a discord call with him?
For the fake kick off I think he just barely rolls to make you thinks he’s going for it
the fake at 4:00 was just crazy
1v1 Crystal_keys pls he says your bad musty
Fun fact, it is confirmed by scientists that dark(?) Is the fastest rl player in the world and that he is either not moving or at mock 5
Gotta get the mechanical goats in one room. Squishy, Leth, Dark, and Musty
I’m in rlcs  😊
Just wait till he’s sighned
Musty: “This guy is different/magnificent!”  Me: The new best 1v1 player in the game with limited boost freestyles, DARK!
Dark is an aimbot
The glazing in this video is crazy
16:58 musty just got dribbled
Arabs are built different 😈
he mustied on musty
try to zap dash like dark pro tip btw🙂
The amount of freeplay that dark has done must be insane
The hell I am 19 but I am div ll gc1 and this Man makes me and everyone look unranked
يعيال منجد ذا سعودي؟ ما اعرف اللعبه لاكن حقيقة انه لاعب محترف وصانع محتوى " من اللي فهمته من الكومنت انه محترف" ويمدح دارك طول اليوم هذا شي يدعو للفخر ! وين اعلامنا عن هالنماذج مغير يطلعون لنا الحبه الخضراء و الحمراء وبور وفالكون
Me every time dark scores a musty in this vid: MUSTY ON MUSTY
Dark might be a future pro player.
Zen VS dark
The way he uses the resets at 11:25 to position his car for the last second air dribble was nuts.
Dark is crazy bro Musty  looks like a bot to Dark, if anyone wants to add me my username is TTGnarlesBarkley  i am a d3 and very mechanical.
what my duo mate says what he will do if he had boost
I can't believe Musty saud that was a fake,  but it was just dark flipping to far.
Please 1v1 Evample!
What does he uses for making clips?
9:42 that classy flick was clean
Dark is my favorite
Someone sign this kid
Only 14 dam he's impressive young inspiration
Musty got mustied
Bro thinks 10 steps ahead
me vs dark bro i cant even hit an air dribble in free play im done like 69-0 to him
6:13 … The fact you have to worry about him hitting that.
Wait is drku and dark the same players or? 6:28
No way that this guy's 15
im in a call with dxrk rn in ur discord server :D
I still cant get over that fake
Bro thinks he’s me
Only Poles know what 21 37 means
I’m form Saudi Arabia
Dxrk isn’t from Saudi Arabia. He sounds American
Jesus died for you
I’d like to see musty vs firstkilla
Every pro I see, I think I can beat till I understand how he plays, but dark is the first and only player that i’d be scared of if I'm being honest 😮
16:57 no no no
11:37  yeah except for me :(
True
I love how musty says "my bad" even though he doesn't have a teammate 😂
Do you drink prime
4 jumps in air with no touching ground? is that legit?
I liked the part where musty got clipped on
14:09 what IS THIS MANS CONFIDENCE ?!?!? HE WENT FOR A MURI ?!?!??!
🎉
he’s not even good
Please can I be in your vids
dark is so good that he hits the best clips of your life multiple times in a single match😂
W and a lovely vid
What if dark made team with squishy and arsenal 😮
19:37 what kind of hitbox is that?
He may be good at offense but if you look his defense is kinda trash
Different
Hi
Hey musty, I’m a c3 player that uses normal air roll and I’m actually good at freestyle, but I’m not good at games. Also stay musty
Most mechanical play Evample has left the chat
It felt like you were not trying .
This must be how the Sidemen felt when musty starts doing aerial in their 1v7
Yes wene dark won i was so happy cause im from Saudi Arabia
The glazing is crazy
is he on controller?
Bro was playing rocket league of the age of 1 day old…
Dark is insane
It's evample 2.0
most mechanical = yanxnz 🔥
This is the dead state if he was in flow state he would’ve won
bro what tf is happening
Mustys the goat
Bro I swear musty scores like a triple flip reset and doesn’t react lmao I would be screaming 😅
Let me planet me play against you I’m d3 and I’m a freestyler
Do dark vs Jack
I swear i got a far friend on ps and he named his self dark and hes ssl WHAT
All the eu player’s are insanely talented at games
he needs to go pro.
Bro needs to be in rlcs
The whole SA region is great at the game. Dark,TRK,oKhalid and Ahmad are just some of those crazy players.
When Dark has the ball boss fight music starts playing.
You know he is just 16!!!! Dark is a beast
He’s not 14 he’s 24
Whats he using to clip stuff?
This dude plays in cursive
ik
Rocket league is like chess really
Bro is jit death from puss in boots 2 the last wish💀💀💀💀
There are people double this guy's age and they can't do half the things he can. Just how...
First killer vs dark?…..
yo
He is from saudi arabic like me😄😄
Crazy how dark is almost making musty look like a intermediate player while he’s a pro musty scores average goals while Dark hits consistent bangers on an pro. And makes it seem like Musty has mid air mechanics
You should play against BigRooster
Dark makes musty seem like a diamond rank
xd
What boost are you using
Be only won because he was in your head. Run into him in 1s and that’s all you.
that portal was crazyyy 😈
فخر العربب
if you want to beat dark, do not look at dark look at the ball.
Looks like you deliberately threw the first match to me!  Hmmmm...
any1 knows what boost does dark use?
And people say freestyles are useless meanwhile this guy doing freestyles for every goal bro is just different/unique
Finally an Arabic player Also I’m Arabic
“Within a few months my left stick gets really worn down or even gets stick drift”  My ~8 year old ps4 controller that I still use to play rocket league on pc: -_-
dark is 14?
At 19:37 dark hit the ball without touching it?
Is he actually 14
how can you air dribble   happy new year\2023
12:19 playing like chess
This 14 year old makes musty look like a plat😂
So much flashing stuff a top 100 1v1s player would shit on dark ngl  (Edit) not to say he’s not cracked out his little 14yr old mind and I’m sure he will be a top player in years to come  But rn he is just pretty mich a free styler
This dude gets a reset off the air particles
Siema polska  Fajny czas ma ten odcinek c nie?
This man is like the next LJ from Spacestation gaming
Top five fastest things on Earth :5 a Cheetah :4 Bugatti Veyron  :3 a plan :2 speed of Lights :1 pro rl player dark
It's love to see Dark play with/against @Lethamyr
Saudi Arabia already has one of the best 1s pros This kid goes to Falcons next year, they're gonna be unstoppable
How i feel when smurfers exist:
he ain't playing like he does against pros and he still a damn god
we need to see dark vs drku
The fact that he is playing on 90 ping as well is insane 👏🏻
The most mechanical player în the world is evample dude
I wanna see Him vs. Evample 👽
Replay files?
"14 year old, amazing at the game, unbeatable freestyler" yeah but how much do you bench
Dark is free styling while must is tying to paid style 💀💀💀
His bloody incredible. That’s was so nutty on what he was pulling off.
Next opponent drku
What’s the song that starts playing at 5:48?
16:39 what he say?//
Would u say u need a controller with back throttles to get good at rocket league yes or no
17:00 no ur not ur not leaning forward lol
U should take dark into duos and see how the opponents react
cool vid u tryd ur best that all that matters and can do a part 2 in 2203
I think you should try darks settings by searching up rl clips dark
NRG! Give this man Dark a f***ing contract.
Is dark better than evample?
Do they have one of those pro controllers that's compatible with a ps4?? Anyone know if they do? Please help me out.
Jk
*Musty gets replaced for Dark on NRG
Yessss my home boy 🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦
Im from Saudi Arabia and hes the same as me
Decal from dark?
We need dark vs drku
Whats that touch on 19:37? He dosent touch the ball…
Bro is the Allen Iverson of Rocket league.
You have to 1v1 darku-_- next similar name he beat dark so you have to try him
I feel like Musty is conducting a scientific experiment just to see how stupid the people who follow/subscribe to his content are. He was not disappointed.
Musty doing the ol' Color of Money trick on everyone lol. Suckers.
Musty be toying with this 14 yr old like sure, I'll publicize you in exchange for that Saudi Oil $$$, chaching.
You noobs salivating over this kid fail to realize that Musty is the far, far superior player. He can barely keep a straight face. I mean good grief, are you all really  this horrible at the game not to see this?
Musty is so good he can blatantly, intentionally throw a match, confident that 99% of people will be totally  oblivious to it. Musty is letting this kid get goals to build up his profile. I was buying it for a while, but it was laid on too thick. Musty for real man, don't damage your brand like this. Saudi Arabian kid = Saudi Arabian money = Musty lets him get goals to build up his profile. Money, FTL. Don't be taken by this nonsense.
Evample is better
sometimes I feel like musty smokes weed bruh🤣🤣🤣
Why was the intro so echoey
Dark just won against SSG Daniel lol
9:43 what is the name of this flick please someone tell me
I like how scrub arsenal okhalid and the others cant beat him but musty can come closer than them
No way he’s 14
Guys i have the eswap s he is not lying
ggs musty :)
Can you beat evample
Dark hasss to be the next pulse member
Dannnnnng
Could you try this with Nwpo? If Dark is the most mechanical player in the world, Nwpo is the fastest. Would be cool to see what it's like from an SSL perspective
AM FROM SAUDI ARABIA YOOOOO 😮
He a freestyler to
Musty:I’m gonna kuxir pinch this guy 😉💪 Also musty: oh that actually might be kinda ✨hard✨ to do 😥
Bro 1v1 Drku
All the Saudi players are goated there all young and mad mechanical
.
He is like Ahmad and Jhzer put together
This guy just has Justin’s 600 boost Mod.
I can barley do a speed flip when dark over here freestyling on musty
Justin is still better than dark
Musty I'm sorry to tell you but your not on a pro level, you never have been.
I actually just hit gold three yesterday🎉
No disrespect to Dark, but Musty was overthinking everything. He relies pretty heavily on the freestyle shots for his offense. If the defender is just ball watching, then it's a goal, but early pressure makes him rush, and that just results in easy counter attacks. You can see what I mean when he plays against other top 1s players. He's being given all the time in the world to do things like the "pogo"
“I started lagging” -🤓    Me on 300 ping daily: 🗿
One day I will be as good as Dark  bwahahahah doubtful
he is simply on middle east, if you know, you know.
8:50 what did you say Musty?
Hah car
Musty goals look so simple but dark has mad mechanics Ariel goals to pogos
I would argue Nwpo is more mechanicle.
Lol thrust master😂 that’s what your mom calls me
The actual fear coming from musty when dark has the ball
Dark not even trying 🤣
ich
Musty i want to join the discord thing from you but it says that its expired
Hey Musty , for the next time you react to any RL Montages , I can only recommend "The Heatseeker Community Montage 3 | Edited by Lydipai" . Its a great Montage from a Channel thats not that big and doesnt get that many views but the Editing is just crisp and clean with a few amazing parts.
13:14 did he even touch the ball though???

bro pls play trobu league i play it and i just want you to to do a air dibbli in the game pls
Oh I see musty if you don’t know what he did to get the weird touch is that he dribble and jumps while in the air he spins and lands on the ball and jump straight away it’s a technique that I’ve done a lot by accident (when I mess up dribbles)
les gooo musty got sponsored
Should i stop playing rocket league im gold 2 my friends are plat 1 and now they hate me cuz im gold.

I wanna see this dude 1v1 jstn
Hey musty I don’t know if you know me my name is saif and my username is parkorsaif you just taught me how to play thanks
I really liked the moment when in a recent match of the popular video game Rocket League, YouTuber Mustycow pulled off an incredible series of moves that left their opponent, fellow YouTuber Sunlesskhan, and the watching audience in awe.  The move began with a groundpop, where Mustycow used their rocket-powered car to launch into the air and gain height and momentum. From there, they executed a perfect airdribble, using the ball to maintain control and direction while still in the air.  Next, Mustycow pulled off a difficult pogo, using the ball to bounce off the ground and gain even more height and speed. With incredible precision and timing, they then performed a mustyflick, a signature move that involves using the ball to flip the car and spin it in mid-air.  The move wasn't over yet, as Mustycow then executed a triple flip reset double tap, spinning and flipping their car multiple times before landing perfectly and striking the ball with precise force. To top it all off, they managed to hit the crossbar and score, leaving Sunlesskhan and the watching audience in amazement.  Mustycow's impressive display of skill and quick thinking was a highlight of the match, and a testament to their expertise in the world of Rocket League. The groundpop into airdribble to pogo to mustyflick to triple flip reset double tap and crossbar down was a true masterpiece of in-game maneuvering, and left fans and fellow players alike wondering if anyone would ever be able to replicate such a difficult and impressive move.  This was truly one of the moments of time.
how much did “Dark” from Saudi $ you Musty dear? (you’re doing it too much)
I invented a new mechanic it’s a sting pop with the ball on your four wheels
I made a new mechanic

Hey everyone sorry I'm late but December 5th is my birthday so pls wish me a happy birthday
this is the first time I'm seeing musty's face and he looks like jesse pinkman
Dark is by far the most entertaining player to watch. The useful and applied freestyle mechanics he’s incorporated into his game are changing how rocket league is played in the 1’s scene
I wanna see u and dark play a game together
wow i cant even air dribble.
Dark is the best ever

Musty can you tell me what's the name of your headset?
Musty you look pretty mid did you fall off
Now he should 1v1 drku
Hi musty if your seeing this I made a new mechanica its called timer a d it's when the ball is a bit off the ground and you dodge the ball and a little bit of your wheel hits the ball and it goes flying in the  goal
Bro he made u look like a bronze player ☠️
This new Nexto version looks really good!  Nice that he can chat now too!
11:17 soundbite 😂
Once dark learns to mix in some passive play with his aggressiveness he’ll be a top ones player
Crazy how good dark is, especially at *14.* crazy.
Dark is just freestyling 💀
Id like to watch Daniel play this guy
No one thinks you're not trying your hardest. U r a pretty mid player overall
he playing chess engole ur playing checkers, his saving ability and being able to be 1 or 2 steps ahead is crazy
wait musty has 2.7 million subscribers!??? 😭 swear he just had like 60k wtfffff
Vamos por los 30M , no dejemos de apoyar a nuestro líder
This is old game footage i think
Darku
please
How about a 1v1 vs every rank but you have to hold power slide the whole time
He did just make musty look like a C3 wtf Already following him on twitter, already knew he's cracked out of his mind But still impressed, bro is just too consistent
He’s just got a better gaming chair
dark os very good.very good but i feel like musty was kinda not challenging and letting him do his thing on purpose.Idk just wondering
Dark is good
How come I cant type "lol" in RL chat 😭
I’m a play and play like that on a good day he ain’t even that good.
evample is better
I swear Dark is just spamming jump at this point.
He takes the speedflip kick off by side flipping st the start so it looks like he went for it but he is actually staying back
what is ur boost musty
can u 1v1 DRKU? I think he won against Dark
HELLO BRO IT'S ME KARPUZII01 AND MUZMUZII01 !!!
Yo should play with or do a challenge with drku he’s 16 from england has a discord server and a tiktok he beat dark 8-5 while freestyling and it might be fun to do a video with him
Bro got lucky
Ay he’s really good
This is an unpopular opinion but I think Dark goes for freestyles too much
Musty losing his touch
Evample
While Dark is amazing, I think Musty gave him way too much space while playing.  In 1s, you never give your opponent space ESPECIALLY if they are that skilled where they can pull off aerials and ceiling shots with ease. The closer they get to the goal before you challenge them, the lower your chance is of stopping them (assuming you read them in time; a lot of the time by the time you figure out what they are doing, it's too late to stop them).  You keep the pressure on them until they break and start making mistakes.  Even a player with simple mechanics can rank high in 1s as long as they don't crack under pressure and make silly mistakes.
I don’t understand how musty lost when darks shots were basically either pogo or flip reset it’s easy to predict when he’s flying towards the ground tail end smh dark is good but I feel this was scripted
6:37 why would you not just put it in???
Definitely not the most mechanical
I got the musty gfuel I was so happy
Drku destroyed him 7-5
f @DARK(?)
Y'know what would be a good rocketleague video? Placement matches with eye tracking
Misty you have gotten so old now :( you’ve changed
I think the only way to counter him is too just not give him any space
This is when musty plays against hard people.He freaks out
If he is so fast he is justin!
The RL Arabian power🔥🔥🔥
Yo musty you should change your name to NRG musty 👌
Still think nrg jstn is the best player in the world and most mechanical. Dark(?) is still great but I don’t think anything tops jstn.
Me 2120 mmr
Dark sucks
im sueing him he did my flick
This is ,,Ronaldinho" of Rocket League 😁
for the first 10min I thought he was cheating XD
that fake kickoff though...
when you switch cams at 14:12 it looks like a jump cut
Musty, idk why, maybe because of the history, but I'd pay money to see you 1v1 forky best of 5
That controller costs more than my old motorola i7e
Settings in this video?
10:24 😂😂😂😂
Is this the same guy that has been playing all the 1v1 matches on Feer's channel?
"How do I defeat a better player" *Immediately goes for the bump*   Nice Musty
There is a another freestyle called drku and he is 14 to 16
Nah this kid is the gayeast guy ever
average plat ngl
That’s crazy?!
this music is amazing for gaming to i love it !!!
This guy is crazy holy crap. How does he do that.
What happened to mooments
i just hit platinum!
POV: you’re looking for dark in the comments 😂
Clearly don’t know drku
This the smartest stuff I’ve ever seen in rl tbh and I’m in high champ at 13, I’ll take me years to do that type of stuff
He needs a sign
Someone needs to give dark alpha boost, he honestly deserves its
He just a freestyler, like what's the fuss about ?
This players aggressiveness is crazy who wouldn't be scared
“Hey gamer”
Hi IM The almost best kid in The sideswipe Anna 1v1
and I play on ps4
Every video I watch seems like the ball is floating. When I play, it falls like a rock.
DARK NEEDS TO PLAY AGAINST FIRSTKILLER
gd cuh he has mad skillz
You should 1v1 drku
Dude is playing rocket league sideswipe on regular rocket league
يااااااعرب
Its drku innit?
Musty is almost cying
21:37 minutes video?  polish know Kinda sUs
Reminds me of Evample tbh. Obviously much more competitive at higher levels, but Evample is the only other person I've ever seen make freestyling techniques competitively viable like this
Yo musty, i have a question your cam and sensivity is same like 1 year ago? If no, can you please give us your cam? And sens
idk how my flip reset lasts like a second and for them it lasts like 5...
@liviscontent
I JUST WATCHED YOU CHANGE YOUR NAME TO "random."😛
If this guy is good .. he can't do this   Air dribble double musty pogo triple reset   musty pogo kuxir pinch double tap 0.5272m away and 142.75kph top left
I felt disrespected for you.
The most mechanical player 💀
Musty
Ain’t no way he hit a musty flick on musty
music?
Sub to pedguh
Go against with drku
I'm pretty hard pressed to believe this is even real. It literally looks like his car just moves faster. Like, beyond the built in speed cap. I can't imagine if he started sweating.
That fake kick off is perfect. Like holy shit.
Try making jstn 1v1 him
He makes it look so easy
Touch some grass bro never touches grass bro!
I like watching you because I get better at rocket league. I can go in the air and kinda dribble all because of you. How how! Can hedo that
How... how do I do darks fake kickoff
He shit on you right at the start lmao
....what's wrong w being champ 2....... 🥲
Anyone think he has a chance to join nrg?
if mr beast gave him money every time he pogos he gotta be a mellionare rn
We gotta see squishy vs dark js
it sometimes looks like he doesn't get all 4 wheels on the ball to get a flip reset. I've noticed in other videos too, anyone else seeing this? Could he be doing some funky business to make flip resets easier?
How y’all so good I’m literally unranked 💀
Musty have you play a player called OfbLayton?
we've gotta see evample vs dark someday
3:08 what music name pls
People say that if I like the video, I can get a pin. 😯  Can I get a pin 📌
most mech comp player
How about drku
That pogo move is unreal. Love seeing something new like that come out for competitive play. I can see pros learning and implementing that soon
how about you make dark vs jstn the best match in history
Hey Musty. Gonna call bullshit on you using that controller, don’t lie to your audience man..
Musty can we 1v1 in rocket League
dark vs Drku ??
Vid idea: You should ask jstn to 1v1 dis dude
This is how it feels playing Sideswipe these days in any rank below GC.
Is anyone else getting the impression that musty wasn’t trying lol
Musty 1v1 drku
11:16 this shot is scary
Musty I have 2 request and I think it would be a pretty good video if you could 1v1                  Pulsejxsh
They are outplaying their opponents outplays who get outplayed.
I once beat a dude twice my skill level in a comp 1 game just by not worrying about my mechanics, and just paying attention to making smart plays
Sign this man
Musty when he gets scored on:    CSHoo-
Can you sub to my yt musty? R activity is at the church today... bring your card
6:55 you're a genius
My brother in Christ what is the name of the song you used during your promo?! Been hunting it for some time now 🥴
Dark is very repetitive but man he's quick to recover and shoot and consistent
Props on the defense. You adapting to how he used the flip-reset pogo really helped illustrate all the options he has with the move. Looks like somebody trying to fight an 8-armed Mike Tyson.
Broooo im getting that controller thank u musty. Stick drift is hell
he is literally the perfect player
please get him to play 1v1 with lethamyr
1 thousandth comment
when we gonna see Dark vs Drku? hmmmmm
dark vs landen, make it happen musty!
This guy needs to touch some grass
Dark might honestly already be the best player or will end up being best player
he was so goof musty says " the thing is he's actually like messing up" 5:37
u should vs drku
he takes freestyle 1v1 to the next level
OK i knew he was gonna be good but this literally blew my mind he's definitely going to be one of the best pros ever.
xf
do a 1v1 against Firstkiller i'd love to see how that would go ;)
Dark makes me think there is a rank called Ultrasonic Legend
The fact that dark is only a kid he’s 14 it’s just crazy
yoo this man needs an own rocket league rank
Musty plz reply
His pov is already insane but the opponents pov is giving me anxiety
جلد جلد 😂💔
Hes really good, but something about watching his gameplay really irritates for some reason 😅
@19:22 that "xd" comment you made was hilariously accurate.
Α
even if he had a bad setup he still so dangerous its scary af
HAHAHAHA "I'm in danger"
داركنا  تنمر على مستي هههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههه
Today were watching a clip compilation against musty
I feel like he’s hacking
Layered defense beats dark. You have to be constantly switching stances on defense. Fakes, repositions, and prayer.
I like how at 3:05 Dark(?) scores a musty musty on Musty, on musty's channel
Dark reminds me of Daniel so much mechanically dark is clear however back before Daniel signed and he used to do the 1v1 show matches always had the same mentality every chance he got he would bring it to the air for some sort of air dribble, flip rest etc
Musty vs Evample
how tf is he this good
the fact musty went to the snowy field to give home an “advantage”😂😂😂
Bruh dark is diff
i think that this guy could actually be sick in a pro 3s squad if he got used to, his game style is pretty predictable and in 1s if you understand how his brain works you can predict him fairly easily, but in 3, while focusing on other 2 dudes this could actually be perfect
See, now he’s so fast and good because of his reaction speed and game sense. For example the fake squishy save, he’s seen pros/players go for the backflip so many times, he’s able to read it fast enough and decide “ok, car slows, backflip, car doesn’t slow, normal shot” and he can deduce it in that 0.005 second window, actually insane
Love the reactions Nick! Hopefully i get to play with you sometime:)
This trailer was the definition of "don't let them know your next move." Honestly there was so much I wasn't expecting.
I wanna see squishy 1v1 him
drku is better
Who’s ready for the new season let’s goo
I wanna see the replay for that one save
Drku???
This guy prolly uploads montages every day lol!!
bro is a freshman in hs and hes already one of the best pros ive ever seen
Just dont give him any space
What controllers do you use!? I have this red one that's lasted me 3 years!
thrust master lmfao
Go outside and play football
what an absolute menace
MUSTY you should have Leathamyr go against this dude
"in saudi arabia its always really hot imma try a new strat here" had me rolling
What dark YouTube name
21 minutes of absolute meat riding
I want Dark, Evample, and AppJack on a rlcs team.
darks a grand muffin chicken nugget sandwich with ice cream
NO MORE KITCHEN CHAIR SETUP!!!!
Stuff like this makes me want to grind rocket leauge
Pro tip for you Musty: Try not to let the ball go in your net. You’re welcome.
dude does mustys against musty
He's playing m+kb right?
i was trying to understand why he isnt going pro yet then u said he's 14., i was like "WHAT THE ACTUAL F..."
Play against Evample next lol
Play against Evample next lol
I want to see dark vs evample
Bru just challenge it
Drku?
Are we sure dark isn't cheating? Most of his shots feel TAS effected
today we are playing dark (puts a pic of a black guy) lol
Rocket league players in ohio be like 💀
He is almost the defenition of not touching grass lol he only 14!
This guy might be Justin or MonkeyMoon's match maybe even Mawkzy
Love how musty looks like a silver player only waiting for dark to mess up his shot so he can score a simple one shot goal from the distance lol
What's amazing about this is when you realize that the reason Dark has such a terrifying presence is because *every time* he gets the ball, you *know* with every fiber of your being that he's doing something with it; Even if you don't see it yet.  And once he's in your head, he has all the advantage he needs. Very well done keeping your cool, Musty.
Bruh I fell like this man Is an AI designed by a group of INSANE designers like bruh he don’t seem human
Bro is the same age as me and is also the same country as me and I can’t even do a 5 second air dribble 😭💀
rotine: go on freeplay and train resets and pogos next go train parkour packs to be faster and manage boost well
dark's problem is that he isnt creative which makes him readable if you know his style of play and if he misses the freestyle, its an ez counter attack
“he outplays my outplays” ~ NRG Musty
The music is so annoying
Musty please reply I just want to talk to one of my favorite youtubers ever
now 1v1 okhalid
Musty: replaceable joystick for only 20 pounds  Me:living off 20 pounds
aawq
Surprised Musty can't challenge Darks pogo on the way down as slow as the ball is traveling. It looks scary and awkward but the pattern and trajectory for it doesn't change since his momentum is gone.
I'm the same age as him, and from the same place as him, and I couldn't dream of being this consistent and mechanical lol.
Whenever this guy starts competing in freestyling tournaments he's gonna do so well. He is so consistent!
6:43 * facepalm meme *
Can u be my tutor on rocket league please 😢
Are u sure this man is 14
prolly said bismillah
He is supersonic 3
yo musty how did u get ur goal explosion?
Take the shot! Take the shot! Take the shot!
I love the way he plays
Azapatos next! His recoveries are better in my opinion, they are very close with speed but different play styles which are crazy unique!
dark is not even in the top 10. he's "only" mechanical and thats all. ofc im not saying hes bad but there are better players
Evample does it better 😤
Musty has had soooo many mood-swings in this video; one second "YES I saved his shot!", two seconds later "Oh no"
**dark going easy on musty** musty: IM DOiNg bEttER Than I tHouGhT
dark is trash lol met him at 2k and he threw the game freestyling he challenge so braindead
1:34 what is my mans doing
Dark is insane!!!!
From one generation to the next. This was... phew. Man. Good work, and Dark is amazeballs good.
Finally someone who uses the pogo properly.
day 4 of asking mustard to train me
my Saudi brother good job
papież 2137
New title  Getting destroyed by a 14 year old
play 2s with him in comp
Nwpo got him beat
Yo musty is SSL one of the best RL players but against this guy he looks like a diamond who just learned the game lol
a lot of high ranked toxic players try to play like this to tilt you but usually they suck. this guys invincible
Musty is not at his prime😢
The best video in your channel musty
yo, do a horse vid with this guy. THAT WOULD BE INSANE
he is gonna be in rlcs
everybody now knows to not what a save him
This shows the difference between an SSL and not just a pro player, but a real prodigy. Love Musty but the skill gap cannot be denied, and honestly respect to him for doing this suicide matchup
he is the next Justin
Let's go saudi arabia 🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦
Wtf? the musty flick looks wrong???? he jumps, turned his nose upwards but still backflips forward and also with a delay?????
imagine dark vs jstn into this will be crazy
Sratergy: One guy goalkeeper. Another guy boosting around the whole field (Trying to rob opponents boost and trying to not take team mates boost) ALSO important the person taking boost stays at supersonic speed most of the time, which means if he sees someone he can demo everyone also. And the third person is ballchasing and shooting on goal. So 1st- Goalkeeper 2nd- Takes boost and demoes (ALOT) 3rd- ballchases and scores MUSTY PLEASE TRY THIS IT TOOK ME SO LONG TO THINK OF IT
Anyone just look at the chat in the upper left corner before a play to see if they being toxic or friendly or is it only me?
crazy how u can't even beat dark come 1v1 me tomorrow ill smoke u differently
Musty you should have just changed your name to light then it would have been and easy win.
This is probably the best recovery person in the world.
Musty play against Mawkzy  Like so that Musty can see this ❤
Wanna play 1v1
dark is trying to learn ground plays now guys top 10 rl 1v1s are looking scary with dark being as good as he his in the air now hes trying to be a ground player aswell
That video was sooo entertaining to watch! Just mind-blowing  how fast Dark is when you know how fast you already are
I would love to see dark 1v1 evample
When mustard said i feel like an actual champ 2 I took that personally 🤣 like wait wtf that's what I am lmao
Hey musty can u add me please because I've always wanted to play with u and you've inspired to play rocket league so please and im a plat one so hopefully we can play 💯💯💯💯💯💯
my opponent on my rank game:
The demo into the fake.  Musty trying to end this man's whole career🤣🤣 3:56
Bro I always look forward to a musty video.  Honestly great work keep up the bangin content!🤙
dark is just diff
11:26 and 16:30 , 17:00 - ngl, I think the guy is cheating. How does he have the second flip? I can understand ping moments that Musty couldn’t get (as a player who played 120 ping for a year, I can tell the ping is stacking in RL, and drops out about a tick, a 1 second out of the game). But these timecodes - I cannot believe. Sorry in advance if I’m wrong, and 14 y.o. Dark is legit, but… I need approval of this from someone more in-depth on the topic, maybe  even the Grey Hats.
Dark’s skill level is what mine would be in 1000years😂
Plz play against drku
Jezz , Dark is too good for musty . Damn , this is 14 years old ???? It looks like more than 20 years old . Bro...
Play drku
Bro get him in to nrg before any other team
This is wut I call a real freestyle to ssl
COULD YOU MAKE DARK VS ARSENAL?!?!? it wold be funny for ars! lol
Musty in a slump
Unless dark is cheating somehow this just shows how skilled you can actually get at this game and I love it ..... I'm still kinda trash lol
Johnnyboi has some badass show matches on his channel with dark, the kid is never level and he’s pushing the skill ceiling to places we haven’t seen yet. I enjoyed this one musty thanks for the upload!
I can not believe that he is 14
Musty plz do more. Videos in less then a week because I really like ur videos
Now make this guy 1v1 Justin
Thrustmaster, well damn where’s my cut since that what all your mothers call me
Average champ player right here
I’m not hating but I’m just saying Evample had been doing this for awhile. I’m just a big Evample fan really.
Damnn
Video idea musty  Play your rank up matches in one's but every time you loose you unbind a key to make it progressively harder to play
next one against nwpo :D
this is aint drku for all yall confused dark beat drku like 6-1
Is this darku?
A normal player’s peak clip is literally just his average goal. He’s insane
Epic
I am 12 and i am gc 1 and i was thinking that i was good for my age until i see dark
Run some 2s w him!!
I need a controller whose bumpers last long
7:00😂😂😂😂👌
One of the best in game freestylers
Seeing the way dark hits these shots consistently is a reminder that we r nowhere near the games peak skill ceiling
Squishy vs Dark????
The whole video is musty regretting he invented the flick
I swear musty is faking how hard it is, no disrespect to dark but musty was soft trolling a lot
Prob a leth ai, idk lmao
Oh yeah and hes also 14
Just give dark infinite boost
Drku>
i feel like you'd have a better chance against him if you didn't know it was him
this guy is like nexto if he was a feestyler
Can’t imagine dark in like 10 ping 😂
Evample did it first 🥱
Y’all ever notice musty looks like quadeca
Maakes me so happy you made a video with Dark
He's a creative genius, honestly.
Very entertaining 💯 love seeing musty try 101%
loki mustys better
Pure. Clean. Dark, I see you!  Thanks for sharing Musty!
Wow that guy is CRAZY😳
Imagine if this guy peaks also he should go pro ngl
I’m the 100,224 view
Mawkzy is better
Bro was crazy, and to make it even better he skipped ever insane shot he made.
you should do horse with them.
squishy when musty 1v1ed him "there's no way bro" musty becomes the next prodigy when musty 1v1s dark "there's no way bro" this proves that dark is the next prodigy.
A HORSE VIDE WITH THIS GUY WOULD BE INSANE!!
16:16 how on earth did he manage to get that reset and pop it over you there, crazy player
Is he singed
bro is 14 and straight up bullied a rl cs player like whats next bully a whole rl cs team?
im from saudi arabia as well but the game is really hard for me idk how to get better either its me or my teammates because usually i play 3v3-2v2
Jstn vs dark ?
Musty: “gets mad because he’s losing”  Me noticing that musty is on 200 ping like the whole game: “HoW iS ThAt FAIR”
I have cousins in Saudi Arabia and they are 14 so...
I legit know who he is.
I think dark is hacking
Dark is like you are playing someone in sideswipe
.
I just got one of those E swap controllers sad I missed the code, but the controller is super worth it. The tactile buttons are so nice, granted the toggle switching is the reason I got it the buttons make the controller
Musty every 5 seconds- What?…   Lol
Dark's car just feels faster its insane
How does he get so many resets ☠️
I need pink NeYoYos any1 wanna trade?
they talk about freestylers smurfing on bronzes then theres this dude smurfing on pros
We need a see them play together in ranked
Musty do this video idea do a horse vid against maktuf vs dark and let’s see who’s better
I've been playing since 2018 and still plat
dark(?) is the truth
Bro is playing sideswipe but for real lol
W guy
10:43 new mechanic
Hey musty good vid and my friend sent u a message on Twitter bc I can’t have Twitter so when u can pls read it thx it’s about me, rl, and u
Must my birthday is on dec 9
RLCS sub dark? maybe?
best general in the navy 200  iQ strat's  6:51
Musty is washed now
The future of Rocket League in one player...
It looks so fake bro it's obvious the way you're talking and play it's obvious
Hey Musty! Could you arrange a bo3 with Dark(?) and Evample? Both are competitive freestylers. Would be interesting to see. Nice video!!
Sign em💀
I thought you were talking about drku is that the same person?
So many of his resets look like he didn't get them, yet I get perfect looking resets that don't give me a flip lol
Isin’t it drku And not dark
Bro musty you gotta vs Evample the guys is cracked I feel like he’s maybe matching darks skill but everything is so clean that he does
Musty vs Retals on feer's channel. When?
The kids really good and I imagine he’s messing around a lot because some of those shots and the extra movement is going to get him scored on every time against top players
Wow this guy ist insane but you beat him 1 time gratulate 😂❤🎉
tactical god
lol cold environment
Musty got put in his place
whoa~ Dark is a beast
Damn
anyone else wanna see him against justin now?
and it’s an Xbox knight
I mean that’s just you personally me my controller hasn’t broken over half a year
No musty skits. 😭😭🤧
Wait a minute!  OMG!  OMG!  OMG!  I RECOGNIZE THIS GUY! HE IS FROM CBELLS PLAYERS VS THE RANK THEY THINK THEY DESERVE VIDEO! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S ACTUALLY HIM!
does ur bakkesmod still work????
What does he play on ?
who is better? Dark(?) or Drku_
Dude he's insane
Dark should 1v1 Justin
Everytime musty even touches his controller all I hear is the ankles breaking sound effect.
that‘s insane
Is this drku or someone else ?
with that Thrustmaster Eswap can you map the grip buttons to keyboard? no controllers have been able to do that... and the way I have my Steam Controller set up is the Grip buttons are , and . so I can assign them to air roll left and air roll right, but every controller I've tried and I've tried a lot of high ticket controllers, it makes you assign the extra buttons to exiting buttons on the controller so that doesn't help and I always tear up my left analog stick, and sense steam stopped making the steam controller I'm always having to find them on ebay or what not
He’s built different
what is that dark design i dont mean version 1
Musty was 105 ping all the game, i'm constantly playing with more than 100, i know for fact most of his goals where just lag from Musty
Please play with Evample as well, his free-styling to ssl series are amazing, I’d love to see that collab
Dark repping v1, my man
The pogo god dark 🔥
Hah you finally experience how we feel
NOOOOOOOO IM LATE😭😭😭 IVE NEVER BEEN LATE TO HIS VIDS😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
You should make a video like the watermelon car but with all the hexagon items.
we need the horse matchup
w vid
It’s always a good day when musty and wayton post
idk kinda feels like hes cheating with the flip resets :/
Did this guy perfect the strat against nexto and just does it in 1v1 till it’s polished?
Darks been thrashing loads of top players. I saw him pogoing against scrub killa and he dominated.
question: would a backwards mustard be a ketchup flick?
Video idea: U play a few games and for every win you have to wear a glove that gets thicker and thicker so it gets harder to play with every game
You should ask pros to vs this kid (Leth, retals, arsenal, etc…) in one’s but say it’s you. Or just have them vs him and see if they can win either way lol I think it would be a solid vid to watch. anyone agree?
Day 3 of asking musty to call me musty
What are your settings? 😊
Fake vid lol
Musty you are one of the most talented rocket leugue players I’ve ever seen I mean I know your against a pro in this video but in general you are just a really good player keep it up love the vids 😂❤
hey musty can we get a video where you go over your settings and your controller binds?
I would like to see drku vs dark
i thought you were talking about drku at first
Umm, I've been to Saudi Arabia and its not always so hot there lol 6:54
Anyone have his tiktok account
This 13yr old kid lives in Saudi Arabia? Man this loser needs to go outside once in his life jesus……pathetic he’s this good at that age, he’s just wasting his life
I desperately want to see a dark versus Evample 1v1
Musty just got cyber bullied
18:31 WTH🤨🤨
I would love to see this guy on falcons
at one point in my life i thought musty was the best but nahhh i was wrong
Who else wants to see him play ApparantlyJack??
cheater
I liked the part when dark clipped on musty
bro said only 20 dollars
rare moment of mustys questionable rocket league career
I feel like he has infinite flip hack trust me I have a friend that has that hack and he does resets like that
Bro where the gfuel skit musty?
330th
Hello musty can u train me because im gold
This is how people feel like when with freestlye smurfs
bro 21:37 video 🤨
bro does to much
I thought you were gonna 1v1 drku
Somebody signed this kid
I like how musty seems to think dark is actually trying when dude is clearly trolling and just going for clips on every offensive drive 😂. Like why are you happy you won a game when he's not even taking you seriously, lol
He should replace u on nrg lol not trying to be rude btw ur very good musty
Musty is good like trust me but if dark actually tried he’d be winning 10-0
Play against Evample
The fact that musty (even though he’s cracked ) is sweating so hard and Dark is just doing freestyle shots is insane ☠️
SOMEBODY SIGN THIS GUY
Is this guy a free style player?
Now we need a horse game with Dark and Drku
What is the ball doing here? 7:48
Is Justin better?
Musty I love these videos I'm diamond and you have helped my 1v1 skills on how to challenge when you should an when u shouldn't and loads more thank you 🙂
Musty you need to play nwpo hes like 3x better than dark
Yo you should totally played against drku he’s pretty younger and he is super mechanical
Yay he’s from Saudi Arabia and so am I and I’m not that far at being close to his level cause I have some clips on my channel and I think I’m not that far from him in mechanics but in ones he’s way better cause he thinks differently
Great video, he is such a good player. But musty... you really thought you could beat Dark after losing to me? 🤔😈
Dark is very young but a good Player 😂
Nah Justin more mechanical
Just asking what is your field of veiw
drku vs dark for a video??
hi
Can you do a video where you team up with him (with voice chat) and play 2v2s.
Grand plats across the globe saying “I can beat this guy”
you need to do this with comms
Mawkzy still beat him easily
U need to play more against pro/high level players.
Bro skipped school to often💀💀💀
Jack has better mechanics
New title: i got destroyed for 21 minutes
I thought it was going to be the goat drku
The way he makes Musty look like a normal RL player is insane.
Mussstyyyy!
I like how even when you tie the game you’re like “this is winnable” as if you’re against insurmountable odds lol, which you kind of are since this guy is oddly good at the game
You should do this with drku
anyone kno wht boost dark is using
Love the vids Musty keep up the good work!
hope to see him in rlcs one day
He's just a freestyler vs him with out going up for an Ariel.all shots were him going to the ceiling
Keep posting 2s until I loose
Man has no reflexes. You can't fake him
Dark is insane he should play pro
OLNY POLES KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS VIDEO  hint: this video is nice and long
we need a rocket league horse video with him
Music is fire in this edit!
It’s crazy how good musty is but all of his goals are so simple while dark is hitting the craziest shots like it’s nothing
Hey gamer !
The scariest thing about dark is that he's only 14 years old. Imagine him as a 25 y/o He'll be more of a menace. This guy's just insane.
0:22 probably the most honest take Musty could give 😆
say ma sha2 allah
I wanna see dark 1v1 Jzr
Video idea: u should do a vid on the NRG rl channel where everyone tries to beat ‘Dark(?)’
Go watch Feer show matches. Dark is good if you're an average player, if you're above average, he's just another kid to beat. Still better than I'll ever be though.
Bro is actually just trolling arround, and Are still Winning to hard💀
Most mechanical player in rocket league??? Seems like you dont know evample then...
ngl, Dark is OP
Next he should 1v1 actually stepping on grass
dark vs drku???
hi
Dark is actually insane you should do some 2s with dark it would be a banger and I really want to see dark vs Daniel I wonder who will win that game
I get absolutely destroyed in 1v1 by 10 yr olds on rocket league and it's so frustrating
no wayyy. i remember first seeing him play against scrub killa i think. crazy to see him on here. he goin up
This guy is beating pros and I’m stuck in silver-gold. And we’re the same age
I would love to see Musty's reaction to Evample
The thing is, when Dark plays 'normal' he plays better that the other 1v1 players
Who do you guys think is the best. Drku or dark?
Next you should 1 v 1 Rw9. Would like to see if you could break down his defense
Finally dark in the spotlight! This is the video I have been waiting for. Also I think Daniel is just as good but he isn’t as flashy
Hypothesis: Dark is an AI produced by Psyonix themselves to make players explore the skill ceiling and to make RLCS more exciting in terms of mechanics.
man dont go outside
Evample 2.0
I love how dark doesn’t touch grass, it’s so sick
early
What a player
Make a video with Drku
Musty your my favourite rocket league YouTuber
Bro you know what I was thinking esports team wise Dark Daniel and app jack
Dark is my favoritt player
Am I actually early to a Musty video??🎉❤😊
Your opponent is so like me in this roblox game, he fakes alot and I do too
195th
will the legend respond ???
His getting subs faster than his mutating😂💀
love to see Dark play Drku
Dark(?) had one of the most unique 1s play styles. So fun to watch
If I 1v1d dark I would destroy 🔥🔥   The score after...  Me.               Dark 0.                   245215
dark is crazy lmao
Musty you are the goat and my favourite rocket league player I’ve been watching you for 4 years
Nice  vids musty can I get a musty car pls name pure-adio9 thx bro

Early
Top 200 to comment
good luck on 3 mil  musty!
Musty says hey gamer in every video but we never say hey back…   Hey musty
The quality of these videos are insane!
ok but dark is genuinely going to single-handedly change the way the game is going to be played, it shows freestyling is viable in ranked and actually works. His fake kickoffs are really smart as well as he either gets boost + ball or a really good kickoff if the opponent is taking a more cautious approach to kickoff. He's only 14 as well so he has a long way to grow and improve
dark is so underrated😂😂
Bro mustid on musty
Sup
musty your not a gamer
me: ima use code musty100
I like musty do you like him?
Musty is the best YouTuber by                  far
Weird I don’t remember playing you
Nah nah we all know musty is the most mechanical player
How does dark do so well when he’s only 14 and he’s from Saudi Arabia?
It’s a great day when musty posts 😂
