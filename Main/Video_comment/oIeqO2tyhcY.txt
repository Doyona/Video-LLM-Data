Am i tripping, or she looks like Blue Ivy. ❤
Fire🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 amazing Chloe 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love her music.. She is so talented..
I would love for her to do jazz music like Patti Austin because her voice is sultry and it would be an amazing crossover. So soothingly smooth
My gawd, this is beyond excellent. Wow! I love the deep runs and the sharp highs. Ugh, actual real talent.
You can hear Beyoncé songs she wrote
Stop playing with her. Chloe should be so much higher than she is
These young women are phenomenally talented!! Her voice is (and has always been) AH-Mazing!! 🔥😍….her and Halle.
Chloe is that girl! So talented
🔥🔥🔥🔥
She the Beyoncé hands down
Her beauty 😮😮😮😮
Yes ❤
as good as she sounds, where is the crowd???? I hear 'people' but how come we can't SEE THE PEOPLE? Tiny Desk Concert USED to show the people when it was more well known artists.....
ateeee
I wish I could like this a million times
Chloe is sharp and so very talented! I'm so proud of her and her sister, Hallie. ❤
🧚🏼⊹ฺ
this version of body do is insanee
Time stamps are not correct
She gives me TOni Braxton vibes.
How this only showed up in 2025, August 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
She’s cold AF just like her lil sister. They are truly blessed with such beautiful voices 💜🔥🔥🔥
No background singers can keep up with Miss Chlöe! Absolutely amazing
the BEST tiny desk thus far
Talented women can sing, write, perform and act as a actress i just love her and appreciate her talent
I always come back for more.  Chloe has a such voice!
All around great artist!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

You're almost there. Now, don't f" this.... 😂😂😂😂
Brains! ✔️ TALENT! 🎉 🎉🎉  Beauty! ❤
Beyonce made it her mission to ruin those two little girls by making them two sluttier versions of herself. And she succeeded. One of my top 10 reasons for loathing the music industry.
Chloë is indefinitely my little Cookie. 🌻
Ok Chloe!! My girl said she a grown woman!!! ❤
She [Chloë... "Ms. Bailey, if you nasty"] seems to be channelling Janet Jackson, Beyoncé & Chaka Khan here. 🎉🥰🤩🙄😮😲🤯😆😁✨️💫🌙🔥🩵🍾🥂🍸🍹🍶
To be honest, she can sing, but just because she can sing doesn’t mean that she‘s able to transmit the emotions of the song. There’s something missing. But maybe it‘s just me, I don’t like her voice and her way of singing.
She's so pretty & talented! I need those lashes she's wearing, someone find out what kind they are for me..quickly lol ❤
She is so cute 🥰🥰‼️ 🎤🎙️🎶💃🏽how could anyone hate on her💕‼️
this girl is amazing🙌🙌
She bad den a muuuufucca GODDESS
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Love this !!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This performance made me wanna rediscover her debut album all over again which btw  was so much better than the critics claimed it was. Luv Chloe Always 💕
Her voice is AMAZING  AND SO MESMERIZING❤

🔥🔥🔥🔥🤍🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hear so much Beyoncé influence in her voice yet she’s still got her own style.
Wow her voice literally brought me to tears
Wow, this is the best version of you it's sexy but classy as well !!! I would like to see more of this !!!! Shine, beautiful sis !!!
Wallafamer, concrete, rock solid peformers
Easily one of the best tiny desk concerts in my opinion ❤
She should go more towards the neo soul route. She got the voice and vibe for it fasho.
This girl is maddddd talented!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ms. Baily
18:40 this reminds me of the ending of “green eyes” by Erykah badu
She has a tiny desk...oh wow
WAY BETTER THAN BEYONCE TO ME 🤷🏿‍♀️
Amazing voice and each musician in her group is an amazing vibe too
i love this version of '' i dont mind''
This is one of MANY Digital Animation versions of Chloe Bailey. Tiny Desk is 100% Digital Animation, it's all Digital to cover for the Celebrities who never existed at all
Where can I find the EX song.. I looking on her album but can not find the song  someone help! Love that song!!
Funny think. gs like a bold bit$h lol. That’s gonna cuss them out for being dumb and then Curve them… don’t be nice
Shes wonderful 💯💯❤❤
Chloe you better sang.
Ms.Chloe is a whole vibe and can sang her a$$ off so mysterious as well ❤❤❤❤
HER VOICEEEE!!! WOW!

Chloe you are Amazing!
She is BETTER THEN BEYONCÉ ALL DAY
I don’t mind really thaat song🕺🏾

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
A true artist, vocalist
She’s one of the best singers right now
The talent this woman has😫
Body do 💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
Im sorry i wish she did more just straight up singing instead of the talk singing because she has a beautiful beautiful voice that we are starved from with the mainstream girls nowadays… 😢😢
Her voice is niiiiiiiccceee.
I don’t like her using the “N” word and you have other races there and using it a lot so they are going to think that it acceptable since she calls her own people that use your words carefully and see who is your crowd
I love the Bailey's together and separate Much Love ♥♥♥
do FLO plssss
She’s everything and more ❤️😍😍
Sadly if I idolized my favorite singer and they stop me from being their competition by joining their label. Her and her sister are so talented.
Watched this a minimum of 48 times excluding th reverse an replays
Watched this a minimum of 48 times excluding th reverse an replays
Obviously this is the best show tiny desk has ever run
I love her voice and she is beautiful but she is trying to be like Beyoncé and I don’t like that vibe with sone of this music she is way better and no hate I followed her and sister before they got signed and they was just on YouTube
Neo soul is where she belongs!!!!! This ate!!!!! Girl come on over to the Neo-soul world. I promise you won’t regret it! The vibe is there!!! This just rocked out!
Love Chloe’s live performances. Such a talent
Smooth Tweakin 😂
Walker Brian Moore Barbara Robinson Helen
What part is body do?
I'm finally convinced that these girls(Chlöe & Halle) are truly talented. Wish nothing but the best for these two young ladies.
A REAL VOCALIST
naaaa CHLOE , I LOVE U! this wasssss beautifulll<3333  still manifesting to be one of your tour dancerssss<3
True talent !!
THIS IS IT! Just a mic and her voice!!  WITH Clothes, NO worn out twerkin. It's the mismarketing that has kept all her work from being #1. This is it!!!!!
GO CHLÖE!!!!
🇺🇸❤️🙏🏽Pure Joy Absolutely Pure Joy Bravo Sis 🇺🇸❤️🙏🏽
❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
Grammy next!
Moore Margaret Hall Mark Garcia Jeffrey
I remember when Chloe x Halle were doing covers before Beyoncé signed them. Chlöe has come so far and is continuing to develop her vocals. She's a master of her craft.
The first song is called surprise, not make it rain ! The video subdivisions are titled wrong.
I didn't even notice the lack of background singers until I read the description and I have already watched this 3 times over already. Incredible performance from an amazing singer and performer.
Jones Sharon Moore Larry Young Shirley
Song was better higher on the parts she pushed her voice like pain in it
Pieces was written to low in some parts wrong key but beautiful song meaning voice I'm surprised Beyonce cleared it unfinished
Her low register is beautiful
oh my God, she is amazing, unbeliveble😍😍🥰🔥🔥🔥
❤🌟🙏🏼 Yeah j'aime le feeling et la Beauté ensemble , merci ☆♡****
She does give Janet vibes ❤
The band killing it too though!
She is so fire!!! Her and Halle are sooooo wonderful!!!  Perfect in their realms...I need them to make another album together. Chloe  is soooo bomb though goodness.
Next level... Beyonce need to make couple of records with these sisters already!
Chloé darling you gave me life hunni...Yesss!!❤🙌🏾
She’s not NEO SOUL. She’s original.
💜💜💜💜💜💜
Listening to this Tiny Desk for the first time after her release of Trouble in Paradise (some amazing songs on there!). Her vocals are something else and she is the sweetest!!!!
she needs to do another one with trouble in paradise songs now 😭 imagine how amazing fys or might as well would sound acoustic
Rodriguez Kevin Clark Steven Anderson Edward
🔥 🔥
I always heard people talk about Tiny Desk. Im glad I saw Maxwell' post saying he was pn it. I love this platform raw singing
So impressed
Lopez Angela Lee Nancy Johnson Joseph
she sounds and looks beautiful. i’m so proud of you chlöe 💫
You cant play with CHLOE or HAlle ... Ever !!!!!
I miss old Chloe. There's no doubt she has talent and the vocals are crazy but I would've preferred a more wholesome and slow set up.
This is possibly the best Tiny Desk ... the talent is mindblowin'
MAD!!!!!!!! That is all. Madness. Wow. This was emaculate.
How come Tiny Desk sounds so much better than most live concerts?
te amo clo❤
2:25 ❤❤❤
Chloe is amazing!! She is the sh*t!!! I luv her. Why do I feel like she freestyle all of the song on here. If she did!!🤯🤯🤯 I don’t know or hear no R&B artist freestyles singing!!! 😮
The singing is awesome!!! The music is superb!!! The lyrics to some of her songs are just not for me. Her lyrics hit the majority of listeners, so that's what matters, I'm sure. I represent a small percentage. It's why she makes the big bucks!!! 💰 🤑 💸
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Tão querida e talentosa 🥰
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is why they mad, CHLOE is that girl! When u have the talent and the beauty they don’t like that; but just like they did Beyonce, nobody can stop her. Pure talent❤❤❤
For me, because the timestamps are kinda funky.  00:15 - Surprise  02:26 - Body Do 05:12 - I Don't Mind 07:42 - Worried 11:23 - In Pieces 15:10 - Cheatback
She is soooo talented, but for some reason non of her solo songs really resonate with me
ICONIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Feel like a child in this place. So relatable. Hit me hard. Watch me turn in circles like a tiger in a cage
In pieces is such a beautiful song. The line nobody else to hold when I am in pieces is giving your the one my true love. The lyrics are absolutely eternal. Like a fire needs a spark, like a full moon in the dark.
I love this performance so much. I come back often. Her diction, notes, and attitude solidify her as a solo artist amongst the rest.
Amazing talent!
We need this version of surprise ASAP!!!!!!!!
You are Amazing & naturally gifted... Love your music n you Queen♥️🔥♥️🔥♥️
For starter have a little. Old Millie Jackson, and Betty Wright in her if seen perfrom live. Eye have enjoy 😉 🙂 😎
I don't mind 5:15
Chlöe Bailey is so beautiful and multitalented. 🎤🎶💞
she has always reminded me of Heather Headley. They sing and look alike
👏👏👏👏
the amount of cadence and vocal changes she is capable of is so cool
A VOCALIST!!! No background singers .. her greatest gift is that voice.
The band is groovin' out. Love it.💃🏾
Reminds me of a young Toni Braxton, Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey AND Jill Scott wrapped in a melody. 😮😮  Lawdhammercy. I cannot wait to see her career continue to unfold!!! 🔥💜
Attitude, vocal, confidence, beauty, oh my god, she's amazing.
I did get it before...but now with everything stripped down i feel her music. She should consider going neo soul
Amazing EFFORTLESS
Beautiful happy tears  I just literally love you sis ❤
Style beauty talent  personality ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Cringe worthy 😬
That voice is wow. Love love love ❤️
❤❤❤ 🎶 lovely 🌹
I love her energy. Ucalm. ukahle
Untouchable.
Great job she is so talented and beautiful and wish the best for her career.... More then a fan a Great stage director....❤🎉😊👏😎😉
I see why she got so many haters!...including Beyonce 😢😮
My favorite singer ❤❤❤❤
I dont if Beyonce has been inspired by chole and her sister or if they been inspired by Beyonce. To me i keep hearing Beyonce. And i dont want to keep thinking that Chloe cant stand alone because she can. She sounds healthy and strong. I BELIEVE she needs more tv time and recognition. Her BET performance is what brought me here
She’s solid
🔥🔥🔥she’s very talented!! Keep going Chloe 👍🏽
❤
talented.
Love her for this.  They were having such a good time too
You this DEMARCO LEWIS YA HUSBAND❤🌹 LO😂
Sang OSHUN
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I've come back to this performance a few times... Love her & her sister 💕
Whoa!  She's really talented and kind of seasoned to be so young.
My shorty never miss a beat!😎🌊🫀💯💙
Are you and your sister going to get matching nose jobs as well?
I hope continuous wonderfulness happens to Chloe.  I would love to hear that voice sing many, many, many happy songs. 🗣 🎶💝💖🎵💞💕💓💗🎶
Her face card is valid 😮😍
All I hear is Beyonce where is her sound?  I get that's her mentor but be yourself.
Belo show. Ela canta super bem.. ❤❤
Beautiful talent. Guard your heart and Spirit baby! God Bless you!🙏🏽👏🏽❣️🌺
Band is locked! She sounds great. I'm impressed
apart from her vocals being solid, they are also consistent.
What a wonderful masterclass in VOCALS❤ chloe is my gyal❤❤❤
Great performance, 75% of which oozed copulation🙂Love the way too the whole band was fired up🙂Had never heard of Chloe until today, 12th June 2024. She's very talented and has great energy🙂Regards, Michael M. Kamau, Nairobi, Kenya, East Africa, 12th June 2024.
Soulful melodies resonates/Chloe.
Wow ❤🎉
Not me not knowing the lyrics and can't sing, trying to sing.
Her low notes are such a sweet treat ❤❤❤
This by far is one of my favorite tiny desk❤❤❤FABULOUS CHLOE.❤❤❤
Chloe’s voice is impeccable
Yeah we know she jealous of you Chloe ... hehehe 😂
Her putting the cult classic Body Do in here 💜❤
Chloe ❤
This sounds like a legit cd album from the 90s
I wish this version of Body Do could be released ☺️☺️
Why does that lady playing the bass keep laughing it's so annoying what's so funny just stop
Love her voice. Such an underrated talent. People act as if because she's sensual she's not talented; but she definitely is.
Her voice😍 Her smile😍❤
A d remember she legit can act too!
she reminds me of ....a girl called Knowles 🙂
It’s like the tone and vocal tricks of Beyoncé, but the content is like Jill Scott’s, but her personality is shy like Janet Jackson. It’s interesting.
Surprise felt good AF!! OMG!! 😩😍
Thank you for your upcoming hits. Love always Patricia ❤😊
2:45 I mean…ummm…no? Well maybe now… I don’t know, should I? 😂 That was very random.
say hi to Fonki Cheff.
It gave Beyoncesha and i like dat
Omg, her voice is so amazing, talent dripping from her finger tips!
Don't you all see how exrtemely amazing this is, why are THESE not the studio version? Why is everything on an album these days generic synthesizer pop?! These are such talented musicians and the industry circumsizes them!
0:02 - Suprise ✨✨ 2:55 - Body Do 💜💜🏋‍♀ 5:16 - I Don’t Mind 🪄🍑 7:58 - Worried  11:29 - In Pieces 💔❤‍🩹 15:52 - Cheatback 💣📿
Wow No back ground singers?
This is actually a stellar performance. She should use this setup more often, less theatrics and dancing and more sanginggg! This was it
Ms Chloe is so under-rated
Simply amazing! 🌟 🤩 ⭐️
Never seen such an unfortunate artist on stage , there s ALWAYS something happening right? but she always manages to give her best with her giggling so sweet ,the duality omg
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
powerful
The more people hate and dislike the more talented you are. She get  negativity cus she is that good. Supernova ⭐️ ❤
No background singers🤯 I'm so impressed ❤ She's so talented. This was an amazing showcase.
She tries to be Beyoncé but she ain't.
Jeeeeeesusssssssss!!!!!!!!!! Been watching Chloe since her and Halle where itty bitty doing covers, she just won’t stop getting better and better ❤️❤️
She did that 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾❤️
She really sounds a lot like Beyonce... it is amazing ! But for me, that's also a shame. If I want to hear Beyonce, I want to see Beyonce's face, not Chlöe's...
Shout out to the band!!! Shawty on the piano was killing 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
My plans are mine! I recieved it! Thank you! 🙌🏽🙏🏽🙌🏽😘🐞😘
You and your band did such a great job❤❤❤❤
So Beautiful Queen❤❤❤❤
Watching again and wondering why this doesn’t have way more views. Chlöe is just IT! Hopefully one day soon she gets the praise she deserves because her talent is undeniable.
2024 ❤
I had no idea she was making music like thissss 😅❤❤❤❤
I love you chloe❤
The great bandthe women and  men so powerful 👏
This Queen  should be seen and herd on tv and radio what great voice  and body a  true Queen wow
Chloe is super amazing, super talented, super beautiful, body goal and she killed this and the band too.
So enjoyed this❤❤ Keep it coming!! Also sounds alot like Beyonce...
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I won't blame your solution 😰
Why did she not introduce the band names like everyone else
Her voice is AMAZING ❤
Babyyyyy her voice control is crazy.. Such a beautiful soul
My gosh🤧🔥🔥🔥. Amazing👌🏾.
I like the "lady in my life" instrumental in the background of "surprise".
Chloe and Hailey are both sides of Beyoncé’s persona…
Chloe girl I love your gift you are so talented and well grounded.Thanku my sister for sharing your God”s gift of your uniqueness talent with us.💕🔥🔥Another one🔥🔥🔥💓💓
Awesome!!!
This is fire 🔥 I love it 🥰
This was absolutely amazing I can’t wait until Victoria Monét has a chance to do one of these!!!!!!!
❤❤❤❤❤
Good voice but lyrics too secual unnecessarily.
I see s younger version of Beyonce... Ijs...
I can agree with and attest to the best part of business, is, in fact, when you mind your own ❤
love herrr! always !
SOOO AMAZING WAS SOOO GOOOD
She has it all!Beauty that runs from her skin to her soul and through her artistry. Sing Chloe!!!!
Chloe as an artist is both an old old soul and far ahead of age at the same time. Her voice incredibly beautiful & her  beauty is stunning! Her talent is limitless... Chloe is phenomenal & she's just getting started!!! 🩷🩷🩷🩷
Yesssssssss sis
Wow so Nice!
I love Chloe she's  super talented and beautiful. Let the haters hate. She's going to go far.

She makes curse words sound beautiful 😭 She’s beautiful and voice is beautiful
The Bailey sisters are by far more talented than most in their generation ❤
The band fire
Mama 🎤 was definitely on
Great vocalist
❤❤❤❤❤
A freaking BEAST!! Love Chloe!!!!!!
The band is throughly enjoying themselves ❤
This definitely might be in top tiny desks, Chloe is radiant and the chemistry in the band is seamless. Beautiful set, uplifting! ✨
Tiny desk should also invite Toni Braxton. I would love to hear what she would sound like😊
A STAR!
Her voice is beautiful!!
I love this Queen  voice and her great band need more of this  Queen  wow

SHE IS INCREDIBLY TALENTED
11:13 🥹😇🙏🏾
8:21 ❤
Imagine her journey as a youtuber to NPR tiny desk… so surreal. I’ve never encountered another soul like that in her age range.
This is more than above what credits Chloe & Halle was given. They are the greatest songtresses. This is an emaculent performance. They don't need Beyonce, they need to branch out on their own.❤💕❤💕❤💕❤💕❤💕❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥💯👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
🙏
❤❤❤❤❤
She nice but sound too much like Beyoncé
Chloe and her band did a fantastic job!! It was beautiful time.
Super super talented… I Love her and her sisters ❤❤❤
🔥🤎😍 FIRE
her CHEMISTRY 🤩🥺
Yea her boss was def hating
Chloe makes music that is so layered. Its current , with a dab of contemporary jazz flow. Any artist that has that kind of smooth vibe is destined for greatness.
ADIKTA
No background singers is CRAZZZZYYYYY👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 go off lil sis
Baby she ate that surprise…. I don’t even like that song but I need that version
No need for the swearing spoils it.
Love her!
UHM WHY THE AD AT 14.10 RIGHT WHEN SHES HITTING HER NOTE. WHOEVER DID THAT TRUST U WILL BE DEALT WITH
She is a star! They talked about her and she kept going!
Ugh, so talented!!! 😩 Girl! Please release music that can showcase that.
Her voice I can’t get with like that she do too much and it’s forced out
Chloë rocks!!!❤
Absolutely beautiful. Bravo.👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽❤️
Beautiful 🤎
Way better then Bey
If you all don't feel something listening to this,...............this is honest and transparent unlike anything I have ever heard before😄
This young lady is very, very talented and lots of people has been comparing her as the new baby Beyonce but I believe she’s gonna create her own destiny for her self I pray for longevity in the music industry Ms.Chloe Bailey and continued success 👍😎😌
I don't understand why is she so underrated? like what?
Love you Chloe ❤❤❤
In Pieces went insaneeeee
Its definitely me running up the views! I'm fuking stuck!
Sexy and Beautiful groove.. I love Chole ❤
so good..gotta love chloe
Absolutely Breathtaking Performance! I adorable everything that she does!
She is amazing.. they stay hating on excellence ❤
This is really what hard work & consistency sound like her breath control, range, & pitch is fuckn crazy!!! What's the saying "It takes 10,000hrs to master a skill" She definitely there! 🥹💞
This was great
❤️🇧🇷❤️🇧🇷❤️🇧🇷
Chloe’s vocals are sick!! 🔥😰
Omg this woman is spectacular!!!! Her voice and performance is amazing every time!!!!
awesomeeee
love her
"My favorite pop-up business is when you mind your own." Church!
She's very pretty, but i never took a chance on listening to her music til that collab w/Future. Close-minded, i know, but I'm glad i checked for this now. Just as talented as she is beautiful.
This was beautiful! ❤
We need this version instead… come on over to the neo soul side.. we welcome you with open arms lol
Okay girl give us absolutely everything!
👀 🔥🔥🔥 Okaaaayyy, Chloe!
Her energy and personality don’t fit the music but I appreciate her . This what our generation going through anyways it’s relevant, I can’t stop but be annoyed that she sound like Beyoncé 😭
So mad she didn’t do Pray it Away!!! I love that song…. ❤❤❤❤
what do you really do with pure talent like this. Chloe will always be in my prayers
The runs and the breath control! The tone!
First listen to the album I definitely overlooked the songs. But I could listen to the live version for hours.
Wow I didn’t know she was this good. I don’t care for her choice of music at all. But her talent is REAL. All the comparisons to Beyoncé needs to stop. She sings a lot better than her Period. 🔥
Cheat Back!  I was hoping that she would sing this one on tiny desk.
You better understand, Chloe Bailey is fire.
Her Vocals are like paint on a canvas beautiful work of art her voice is so instrumental ❤💯 Awesome band great performance
That’s who sings that song 🎶 ♥️♥️♥️
She is in her own way. The love for music  and talent is enough for success. But i feel her and her management insists on other stuff to make her grow.  A few writers would get her the grammy
She is so beautiful and talented. Her voice is everything! A collab with Victoria Monét, WHEN? They should totally write and dance together.  😍  Edit: I hope Naomi Cannibal and Kimberly Nicole Foster listened to this bec. we are all rooting for Chlöe to succeed!
Chloe no doubt is dope, but one time for the band❤❤
Im stuck in the first 7 minutes of this 🥰
10/10 Chloe ❤❤🎉
Another beautiful young lady holding her own with a strong band and background vocals. NPR tiny desk concerts, Im loving it at 65 years old! Raunchy, but far to real. Go head lady...❤🎉
Im 4 months late but Chloe is always on time! ♋️gang ❤
Always back to see this, iconic
18:35  That laugh was SO BEYONCÉ coded 🤍
“Body Do” did it FOR MEEEEEE‼️‼️That band,Chloe’s voice,and attitude sold it so✨AMAZINGLY✨‼️‼️ Then that Island/tropical/Caribbean breakdown towards the end of the song was Muah 😚😚”Chefs Kiss”‼️
I love her❤
5:10 THAT GROOVE
an instant favorite of mine
That Body Do version 😭😍
the audience on this one
love this version
@tamarbraxton next pls
For her to be able to sing both her vocals (main) and backing, is on another level!!!🔥🔥
Love me some Chloe 🦋
Worried 🙌💃
💙
🐐🐐
Chloe is just so beautiful. Everything about her is so beautiful. Her voice is amazing and so steady. She sings with so much emotions and it’s so fun watching her performance. I love her smile too! It lights up a room ❤❤❤❤
Reminds me sooo much of Beyonce with the ranges! Pure talent!
I find she could of sensored… but that’s just me
I love Chloe
So 🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Seen her in Tyler Perry’s Meet the Brown and said that’s her now.  I thought she was going into acting didn’t know she could sing but her voice is like Angels. She has to be the Best Singer I have ever  heard the Breath Control and She dances is Crazy.  I see Why Queen B took you under her wing. She will be the Queen of Every music genre One Day cause She got it all the way around. Blessings Queen … Cause you coming for the Spot ❤
that song "I dont mind" she just tore it up for me i love it her voice is so soothing ... she's such a beautiful young lady ..
that one girl playing the trumpet (forgive me if its not idk instruments) is having a blast lol. shes me.
Omg my baby girl isn't appreciated enough for a vocal beast that she is 😩❤️
She is so talented lord have mercy ❤
Wow she’s good ❤
So beautiful. ilyyy Chloe ❤❤❤
This was amazing
😍♥️🔥
🙌🏻👑💘
She needs all the flowers !!!
This band is IIIIIIIIIIIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! whew chile
She make me hot even if she ain't doing nothing drinking a glass of water I'm hot😂
This young lady has conquered performance levels, and can we all agree that........ when she sings it's like listening Beyonce. Literally if my eyes were closed I could easily say this is Beyonce singing. She has an Amazing voice, anything her or her sister sing sound good. Though I dont usually listen to these type of music. I'm a gospel music lover and singer. I happen to pass by and checked out her voice it's so amazing I need some singing lessons from her for sure.
I really love her song peices
you have a piece of my heart 💙
Just so much talent
It doesn’t get much better than that!  I wasn’t a fan of hers, boy that changed my whole my mind.  She’s all that and a bag of chips 😂 showing my age.
Buenazo ❤
Like her or not, she's TALENTED
Wow she is really talented,  her and her sister. I really do like her voice. She sounds like a mixture of Toni Braxton. Jill Scott, and Beyonce. She definitely needs to go Neo Soul. I will definitely buy her music. Because how she sounded is like legendary iconic, us Millienals and Gen Xers will support you. This is the type of music we grew up to...❤❤❤
Not trying to be Bey ,only Chloe do ehat you do ! So much talent , fire , she so nice , sweet , ratchet keeping it sexy !
This band is 🔥
🔥
Chloe you’re doing what you’re supposed to be doing. This is your lane x❤
That talent of all the band.. so dope🔥🔥
Wow just wow. I need this love version of the 1st song on tidal 😍.
The more I listen to tiny desk the more I see what music, to me personally, is missing from music which is collaboration. I love when multiple artists use their skills and talents to make music. From the vocalist all the way to the drummer. Each person knows they are pivotal to the progression of the art piece being created through sound and each person plays their role well. Artists need more live bands with and collaborative experiences.

Ms.Bailey if you nastyyyyyy!
Yessssss
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥I love ❤️ Chloe’s voice. Love ❤️ the album ❤❤❤❤. Ms Bailey if you nasty Chloe and her sister are so beautiful 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
If she gets some of those Beyonce hit song writers on her team she'll be the second coming of Beyonce. She's without a doubt a good writer herself, but it usually takes a collective to write a hit.
*Ms. Bailey and Common collab album executive produced by the Alchemist.*
The only artist I've seen in a while to sing her own backgrounds and full on vocal control.... this could be a great ep. To rebrand that album👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾❤️
This. Band. Chlöe great. But this band was in the pocket!
Chloe is that girl. Love her ❤
You can tell that she LOVES what she does. She’s ice cold 🥶 with it too.
The attitude- The Look- The voice THATS A POPSTAR. Forget all those TIK TOK people please
She needs to collaborate with Jhene A. 🔥
Her laugh is so cute❤
This is probably one of my favorite Tiny Desks this year. The vocals, the instrumentation, the vibe....just top tier!
Eu sou viciada nesse npr com a chloe, de longe um dos meus favoritos, meu sonho um show intimista dela !!!!
yeah!
Go Chloe, that was bomb.
Just had to rewatch in this snowy weather
Chlöe❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is perfection!
her performance of "I Don't Mind " is definitely one of my favorite performances of 2023
🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️
Jill Scott vibe
all the facial expressions im pulling watching this cause chloes vocally and physically just so expressive and emotive!!
I was not ready for this to be as good as it was.
el nivel de la voz esta algo bajo , increible sesion :)
amazing
GO CHLOË!!!!
The band is dope
She has great stage presence like a full on veteran in the game.

She’s high on my top 20 of GOAT her Halle ❤😊 SERVE CHLOE!!
Oh my goodness, this young lady is phenomenal! Her vocals are insane. I see why she has haters. She's beautiful and talented and dancers her behind off. ❤❤❤

I don’t mind 🥹
Wow
Oof, that drummer though... 🔥🔥🔥
Lady on da bass mind blowing literal
I need her to release the full version of "Surprise" JUST LIKE THIS... My goodness!!!
The YouTube algorithm has definitely failed me. I can't believe it took over a month for Chloe's Tiny Desk Concert to be recommended to me.
Awesome performance! Talented, courageous, and beautiful!  It’s all loved! Thoroughly enjoyed this and the positive energy!
Are these the same songs from her album? They all sound brand new lol
Every single person in the band is feeeeeling ittt 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Her transitions between songs is fire 🔥🔥
she's amazing!! she been like this too
Unmatched.
❤❤❤❤
Ela arrasa! E que banda sensacional
Does anybody else come back to this a few times a week?
Her confidence on top of her talent is so attractive, not in romantic terms.  But It draws you to her and you can't look Away.
Chloe has a beautiful voice I enjoy her music 🎶
WOW, first time listening to Chloe, this young Lady is AMAZING!
her lil giggles are adorable
Just too good!
Omg!! Shes so good!! Fire❤️

Her vocals really shine whenever she does Cheatback
Amazing ❤

❤❤
Sooo underrated!!! She is phenomenal
definitely one of the best (top 2, not...) tiny desks that tiny desk has up currently!
She’s ok but her sound isn’t unique enough
She is so amazing! Like…. definitely slept on. Vocals just out of this world. Control… effortless!
Surprise  Body I don’t mind In pieces  Cheat back
Worried is kind of slept on
My Girl Never dissapointed kiss you

cantoraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, artista, af perfeitaaaa
Ok Chloe do your thang gurl love it. 💐💐
This should be at 1million views cause Chloe did that!!!
😏 Kinda disappointing. If you can't perform your songs stripped down to just an acoustic guitar and you singing, then I don't know what to say. Not hating at all!!! That's just me, and my opinion. You do you.
Amazingly talented. I was jamming down ❤
Love her! This is 🔥❤️
This show was a whole vibe i Stan chole she 🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤❤...Her voice is so beautiful..She is so underrated wrd... Respect to u Chloe ❤❤❤❤

I’m gon tell y’all …. I’m a 28 year old mom of three that hasn’t felt sexy for four years till today…. Just listening to this in my AirPods. WAY TO GO QUEEN 🦋
It's the First time I hear Chloe and I can honestly say I'm hooked
You guys need to get Tems on here
Possibly the best vocalist right now
Y’all need Teezo touchdown next
Sing down Chloe!!!
I'll take this version of her album.  heard body do here first, and after hearing the album version, the live version is that sauce.  Chloe truly is a light.  in person she's a real person, bright, and stays smiling.  she's kinda like that girl that you want to have as a homegirl.
Her whole album is 🔥
💫
💗💎👑🌟😍😘💕
I think the reception to her album would have been better if she had toned down the production and auto tune and let her true vocals shine with more live instruments.   There were a few songs that she sang that I love here, but not the studio versions.
Nah she remind me of Beyoncé fr fr with the vocals 🥹
She’s amazing
I fear, she's exactly who she thinks she is. 🔥🔥🔥
This set was so musical and energetic AF! Big up to you Miss Bailey
Im happy she has clothes on
Wow, her voice! Goodness!
This woman is fire 🔥
I heard a lil Beyoncé in that first song
❤❤❤❤😊

sooo amazing. her songs are so autotuned and edited for what 😭 she’s got raw talent and SOUL.
What a pretty woman can you get me her number? 🙂
Here again. For the thousandnth lol time. The vocals are vocaling baby
Great voice and super charming. There were moments where she reminded me a little of Beyonce. Her phrasing, her voice, her humility, and her giggle displayed an innocence that was endearing. I've never heard of her, but this was an unexpected surprise.
Timbre e Meslismas parecidos com o da Beyoncé..
This is beautiful ❤
3:17 eyyyy

Simply amazing!!!!! Her vocals are 🔥
Fire 🔥🔥🔥🤌🏾🤌🏾
a room full of talent
I love hearing Surprise this way..... sounds soooo good
My Favorite Tiny Desk Performance ❤
Amazing talent.  Her voice and texture is so amazing.  I’d love more uplifting lyrics that raise us to God-consciousness, even in how we can view relationships.  Those may be challenging to write and promote but will be such a gift to the world.
That was fire
Incrível!!!
Everything fire. The Band, her voice. Everything for me. Except the lyrics. This shows the way we set standard for our society. It saddens me a lot. Why dont we sing about deeper meaning of our lives, mindsets...
She did that! This is one of the best performances I’ve seen yet! Chick is seriously talented, her and her sister 🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Almost a month later....still not a million views....my point proven. Not viable. Doesn't sell. No interest.
first time listening intentively to IN PIECES song. now its my fav on the albulm
Why is the instrumental sisters looking so good❤
I think I'm loving Chloe. And the band is 🔥🔥
This was actually amazing cxh both have amazing talent. I can’t wait until people start appreciating this beautiful album..WE LOVE YOU CHLOEEE
17:50 the girl in the back is literally me… I love Chloe she’s such a vibe
Talented and A Beautiful Soul.  Proud of You Chloe😊

Killing it in Eve lemonade hoodie 😤
Wow, what a voice and band! This tiny desk issa vibe❤ Can they put this on streaming? Lol
This made me like the album even more❤
I’m even more a fan after this performance
She’s dope. I can’t hate her. Or rather, I will not.
Que isso! Esplêndido!!
Spiritual!!
16:25 i love her too *loud and then came a yippa I just believe amen

SING GUL!!!!
She’s a natural performer. Her confidence and skill is amazing.
She ate this tf up.
Straight fire 🔥 from the band to her vocals it all was straight fire 🔥 and groovy. Them vocals just beautiful and in another level for real
Hey Chloe!!!!! I hope MBJ likes you back. I would never say it publicly unless I'm sure he likes me back. I'm a little more discreet in making the first move. I love your confidence. And, and you are beautiful X. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️....
Didn’t think I could love you anymore, but I DO!!!!😆🙌🏾🤎🩷🤎😭🤎😭🤎🔒
Chloe?!!!!! THIS WAS PHENOMENAL!!!!!!
Perfect,Chloe 🔥🔥🔥🔥🫰🏾🫶🏾
COME ON GIRLLLLLL 🥰🥰😍😍😍😍
😢
Thanks for the music🎉❤
I goggled ur mini desk tiny desk or what have you … mam 😮😮😮😮😂😂😂
The beauty and talent 🔥 sheesh!
I love her voice and stage control. What I can't relate to is much of the content, and I am sure it is an age thing, so it will be interesting to see if there's any change in the content/topics as she gets older. She definitely can sing about vast issues with her voice!
Часто слушаю, NPR, спасибо большое Вам! Жизнь прекрасна с Вами❤
Love your voice Chloe! And your lyrics are powerful. I just got goosebumps listening to CheatBack! Thanks for resonating with thousands of broken hearts who got stronger or on the way! ❤❤❤
Chloe ate this right on upppp 🔥🔥🫰🏾🫰🏾🫰🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾

She needs to do an acoustic version of her album. This was sooo good ❤!!!
The best.
True talent
Fire! Hit me up bruh.
If Beyonce is hating and not promoting her, I see why ..... 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥰
Body Do live is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
holy...the voice and the control are unreal
Honestly she killed it
Her voice and the skill is crazy omg what is wrong with people
Amazing!!!
I love Chloe's personality and energy she's so cool and down to earth. 🦋
where is chloes pr team??? the views not adding up. she should already have made a mill like cmon
The truth. Factual.
what a beautiful performer, singer and artist.
I really like this
No matter what anybody says you can't say she can't sing !! A VOCALIST
The arrangements for this are absolutely insane!
her cute lil laughs after each song omg too cute
This feels so good
And ATE DOWN!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
the transition from body do to I don't mind is CRAZY this entire performance is amazing
This isn’t confidence.  It’s GODFIDENCE!!
Yassss !!! 😍❤️‍🔥 and the women a part of the band 🙌🏾👏🏾
This is simply amazing. I already saw this a lot of times. You're precious my beautiful Goddess   Love you,  Bella (From Portugal & Angola) ❤
She made me put my cigarette out😂😂,lol
Love seeing women musicians!!! YESSS CHLOE - I loved this!
I have always loved the Bailey sisters. So talented and sweet young ladies. They don’t care about no one opinion but theirs and Queen Bee. When I saw those girls filming videos in their mom and dads back yard with their younger brother doing the recording. I said talent!!!!!
fix the song names.......
I need to go work for tiny desk coz the employees get all these amazing intimate concerts in person... i need it 🙌🏿😍
Never heard of her, but what a talent!
Legit cried, this was such a lovely performance!!!!
Plss her giggling and comments in between songs is too cute! Bailey sisters will eat every time 😍😍
Incredible performance and her scene in Swam was incredible too. I need a cigarette and I don't even smoke nothing
I love this!!!
PHENOMENAL CHLOE 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉JUST WOW!!!!
I know the tricks Beyoncé is up too but at least she has helped this girl
The tiny desk team must have the best jobs in the world. Dear npr/tiny desk, if you ever need desserts I have a bakery and I deliver. Anytime but preferably on the day you decide to have a tiny desk by Luke James or Dre Scot. 😊 Please and Thank You. Oh, and did I mention I’m in Brooklyn???  Love, London Sweets. I’m so serious….
That band is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
these versions are magic 💜
the way the band grooves along, so cool to see this group of people creating art together!
Oh my god!!! Crazy talented and beautiful, inside and out. You go Chlöe, we love you🫶🏼
"oversexualization" if ur not used to a sexually liberated and confident woman just say that. its never an issue for ur favorite male artists. she aint the kid we grew up w
Surreal 🙌🏾 Chloe is a different 🔥
Chloe is such a gem! Brought such a new life to these songs compared to the studio versions
You can tell she admires Bey, and I thank she learned from the best. She say in her lyrics what some of us are scared to say, with her twist of swagg. The pieces song reminds of Bey Halo song, she can defiantly sing.
Wow if it were me doing it I would be out of breath having to sing all that in 15 min with no help! Girl is great!
She has so much talent I’m feeling so grateful that i get to see her in London!! ❤
What an amazing version. An incredible atmosphere
CHOLE!!🧡💚💜💛💙❤️_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
WOOOW 😮😮😍😍🤩🤩
so talented. Like unbelievable. mind blown!!!!! She is so freakin' good. Real deal so she will not be big for a real. I always find real talent takes a lot of time.
Top 5 best tiny desks!! She is so incredibly talented 🔥
IMO she's the best artist of her generation! Her peers can sing, dance, or play an instrument. Chlöe can do it ALL!
SO. MUCH. TALENT.
She has developed into a firehouse! Her womanhood has just added the sass. She can saaannnnnnggggg!!!!!
Her lower register is insane!  Her vocals are raw and she’s just a performer. Even her more lowkey moments, Chloe is captivating. I’m proud to have been a fan since her first days!!  Her talent is undeniable and people can’t not see it.
Amazing Chloe!!!!!!
I don't like that "Ms. Bailey if you're nasty."
Loving her hair, I wonder  if she got rid  of her locs tho, that's what made them stand out I hope they don't let the industry  change who they are as black queens I was loving the loc they both had . 😮😢
One is raunchy and one is classy I like them both❤
So sexy ❤
What in the Beyonce this is? this was fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow, just wow. What a talented group of musicians. And you mr. sound engineer, fantastic job
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
In Pieces ist mein Lieblingslied von ihr❤
My girl Chloooeeee!! Yesss
❤❤❤❤❤
Textures, complexions, styles - what a show 💕
Chloe🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
This was pure PERFECTION. Band, vocal ability, musicality. 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Chloe is an absolute star. I overly enjoyed every second. Keep being “too much”. Just wow.
❤
This girl can really sing.  I just wish she'd stop with the silly theatrics and twerking.
why does she remind me of Gina from Martin lol
This is going down as a tiny desk favorite and of course there have been some icons on here she is making a place for herself to be called one as well keep doing you singing and looking beautiful effortlessly 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
She might be the overall baddest there is right now... **update** she is
This album wil forever have a place In my heart ❤️ first solo trip turned 25 banged this the whole way . Love Chloe !
DopeAzzFk🔥🔥🔥🔥
If she worth it and I cheat she gotta get better for being someone I cheat on. But you gotta be worth teaching how not to get cheatback
I love that her band is mostly women!!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Chloe is this generation Queen Bey and I will also say this until the world realizes it.
🔥🔥🔥
Yeeah.. what's the guitarist's social handle ..tryyna see sumn! 🧘🏾‍♂☕
What are these shortcut titles💀😂 I love it 🥰
Gorgeous ❤
You can tell she is a joy to be around by the smild the whole band had throughout the whole performance ❤
Dude SHUT UP! The only problem Chlöe has is dealing with haters like you who aren't talented yet want to tell a TALENTED woman like her what to do!
How is it humanly possible to have this much talent? Such a brilliant artist.
absolute perfection!
She said Dodo😄
Voice like whipped butter 🔥 truly an angel among men😇
I love her so much ❤
the bands always DELIVER I swear that bassist go head now!!!
Esse arranjo ficou incrível!!
This is beautiful no lie💪
Beyoncé and Chloe need a song
This young woman is Amazing

Beyonce 2.0
I love this acoustic sound! It showcases her voice more! ✨🫶🏾 she’s so talented
She's so talented it's actually insane 🔥 🔥
an adorable mix of cute, talent and sexy. love the Bailey sisters and Chloe!
She ate.
She’s amazing 🔥🔥🔥 A triple threat … she can sing, dance, act. One of my favorite Tiny Desk Performances… I see & hear so much Beyoncé in her ❤
Go Chloe
so proud of Chloe! she did this performance justice 🙌🏾🥺
This is in my top 10!!!
The problem with Chloe is that we KNOW she’s talented. This ? This would sell. But she keeps putting out nonsense over produced tracks.
🎉🎉
That's our Queen ❤❤❤❤ so talented!!
Amazing. What a pure talent!
a true vocalist 😍🔥💯🤯 pure talent!!!!!
I respect Chloe for going out of her comfort zone, she easily could be a success by conforming to this kind of sound but she's playing by her own rules
Why wasnt “I don't mind” a single?
she BODIED that song fr 😍
She ate that up
Can we have kiana lede on tiny desk please
The Best Tiny Desk to date imo! Wow!
Wow so much soul in her voice. Pieces made me cry😢
❤❤
Next Performance: Tone Stith ❤
I love how her whole band is feeling it and vibing with her
The vocals good lord! I need these versions for download !
That transition from Body Do to I Don't Mind was everything
ijbol not her asking THE question 😭
this tiny desk is so good. im back here to watch it AGAIN
One thing about Tiny Desk is it will make you fall inlove with Artists you never noticed before. She brought it!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤ Her beautiful Aura shines through and through. 😍 Thank you Tiny Desk
Ms Bailey if you NASTYYYYY you did your thinggggg
Yes Fam!!!!
I need a live album now
Yessssss Chlo!!!!! Shut the negative folk tf up! Ur CHLOE, not Beyonce!
The band didn't have to snap like that on Body Do. That was funky af. ❤
I’m sorry but the intro to Body Do here was SUPERIOR. I wish she had that sass on the album version.
Chloe just seems like such a sweet person. I’ll never understand the hate she receives. But one thing you can’t deny is her talent. She put a lot of time and effort into her craft and it shows. She’s great at what she does! ❤
She is the greatest cutest ever!! I love her energy and her pure kindness that accompanies her. I pray that God continues to bless her and allow people to clear their eyes and see the gift she has brought to music!!
Fresh Artist keeping it real singing her life story
Her Artistry is incomparable but standing ovation for the musicians
Go Chloe! Love your voice!
I need a song with her and usher
i wonder how the people on the instruments feeel being around talented individuals
Chloeeeeee is 😍😍😍😍
you’ll forever be famous! ❤️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love when she focuses on her voice and not the show she is so beautiful and so is her voice 💜💜💜💜🫶🏾
Shout out to everyone who got to enjoy this with quality speakers or headphones!! It’s a different level experience 🫶🏾
Her vocal control is outrageous 🔥‼️
She and her sister are freaking talented
No background singers ! How many can say
if you’ve been following the bailey sisters for a while , you know this type of setting is very natural for chloe
I dislike her solo work but the immense talent this woman possesses made it impossible for me to not come and support. Her and her sister's live performances are just, unmatched.
Chloe is awesome 👏
Bank and the Skangas
omgggggggggggg amazed, this is a gift
Y'all need to get Joey Badass on this
She radiates positive energy wow
So underrated 🔥
Love this. It was a great performance but all I hear is Beyoncé. I wanna hear her. I want her to have her own sound. Respectfully! No hate!
Amazing back then AMAZING NOW!
This girl is BAD🔥🔥🔥
Can we talk about that transition into "I Don't Mind." Have mercy absolute fire 🔥🔥🔥
Protect her at all costs. She’s just getting started. Well done, l’il sis.
Chlöe if you see this…. A live album 💿
This was an amazing way to start the day ❤
Gosh! i'M ROOTING FOR THIS GIRL!!
Raw talent 😍
I love how the artist reinvent their songs and bring their best versions and sometimes it's better than the studio version

We love Chloe always
Stellar performance and the band is 🔥
Super talented!!
In pieces made the whole thing ❤

How does this only have 48 likes....?
She should have done make it look easy to
Okayyyyyy Chloe
This a vibe😫
The best talent out here...she is fire❤❤❤❤
Wow this is making me go back and give this album another try. She is killin it! 🔥🔥🔥
This is too short😩😩
She’s so dope 😁
So much talent, she just needs to do neo soul instead of thirst trap Pop N B. I have no issues with that genre of music, but I feel like it just is a disservice to her raw talent and distracting from it. I would play her on repeat if she was doing some Jill Scott Floetry type stuff.
I love you Chloe!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I see you in London🎉🎉🎉
aww but I love Mercy
Nahhh sheeee is slidingggg
How cute is she with that little giggle. And what a talented young singer she is - you have long and bright future ahead of you! A triple threat for sure.
CRAZY vocals
Cheat back is my favorite song
I love her hair it looks great on her
Chloe is absolutely amazing her vocals are top tier and her production and songwriting skills are icing on the cake 👏👏👏💖💜💖
Breath control, insane. Musicality, insane. Vocals, insane. 🤯
She def did that !!! And without back ground vocals ! Body Do was my favorite performance here . She just need better material to get hit records to take her to the next level . I would of loved hear how Have Mercy would have sounded love that song !!
This was good. Really really good. 🔥🔥🔥🔥She’s really a true soloist.
This live version is so gooooooooood, stays on repeat!! Well done Ms Bailey❤️🥵
How many times can I like this?!!!
This so cool. I like the vibe ❤❤
Can't believe this has been out for a week & still somehow has less than a million views. This is a fantastic Tiny Desk, amazed at how underappreciated it is.
She is so talented. Just not like some of her songs are about
A beautiful woman, voice and talent.
Amazing
I think people dislike Chloe because she emulates Beyoncé (We already have a Beyoncé). Granted her music is original and organic, It doesn’t feel authentic and it shows in her solo artist music. Chloe isn’t just one genre though and a lot people haven’t accepted that yet. She engineers a lot different sounds. Now, the theatrics in her performances reminds me of Beyoncé 100% but I mean that is her IDOL. Her authenticity and originality will form and when it do, this woman is going to PROBLEM!!👏🏾🔥
Love love love Chloe's voice! No auto tune just her natural instrument AND she has her own style. It's refreshing 🫶🏾
Sheesh. She is insane musically because it sounds so good with out background singers. This woman is hella talented. Wow. Wow. Wow. 🔥 🔥 🔥
How i wanna experience a Chloe X Halley concert!!
Videos like this will make her go on to be even greater. She has one of those voices that can be even more trained.
Atlanta baby!!
Listennnnnn talent is inmates 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 vocals giving me chills

She's so sweet and TALENTED
My love i love you beloved ❤️ shine bright 🌞
In pieces is my song!
People be sleeping on her low notes like those notes don't matter. They do, that's why they are here. They give me chills.
Worried is my fav song of hers !!
This is beautiful 😍
I cannot believe she sang live!! 😮😮 this was perfection chloe is that GIRL
WHEN SHE HIT THAT HIGH NOTE IN "IN PIECES" ...i 😮
I wish she slowed "i dont mind" downnnnn
She should have skipped "body do" but im here for chloe lol
Chloe i am so proud and i love you!
I love you chloe bailey! Your music is top tier..i listen your album everyday girl...slow people will catch up
She sounds great 👍🏿❤
Why so foul?  Dineva was right.
A beautiful talent ✨ well done Chloe 😊
💛💛💛
Fabulous indeed, aye!!!
She’s so cute ❤
I love her little giggles in between she's so cute
Oh her tiny desk is equivalent to ushers tiny desk! She ate that
Her album actually wasn’t bad I just think it’s the songs she chose to roll out first that threw a lot of ppl off. She shoulda rolled out with Body Do, Don’t worry & then that Chris brown feature song
thank u chlöe
Such a talented beautiful young woman. She writes. Produce, play instruments nd she can act. What a blessing 🙏🙏🙏Im so glad she pays the haters no mind🙄🙄if they're not hating ur not popping PERIOD‼️
She’s a very good vocalist and her musicality is insane. These arrangements and her rhythms are so intricate. 5 stars!
Good singer, good band and I love her hair
Sounds better than the original, I love it 🥰
She sounds so adorable gosh!
Her little giggles were so cute❤
3 minutes in and i'm already calling this the best tiny desk concert ever.
Chloe is a beast!!!!! Her and Halle will be around in the industry a long time.
Chloe is seriously a once-in-a-generation artist!!!! she's crazy talented and her energy is infectious 😭
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS SIS I SUPPORT YOU
I sooo enjoyed this🔥🤎💯💃🏾💘
The band 🔥
Please bring on black sherif
The breath control and flow is OUTRAGEOUS!! She has refined her voice to instrument levels. The arrangements are fabulous. Her comments in between are both on theme sassy and surprisingly vulnerable and nervous. The band is BOSS AF! This may be my favorite tiny desk.
I've came back here almost everyday since this was uploaded. It's aging like fine wine tbh. Chloe & the whole band was amazing. <3
If this is not Raw and uncut  talent I don't know what is❤
Wow this was incredible 🔥
She is so talented and adorable 😍
Chlo chlo 🫶🏽❤❤
What a pleasant surprise from the start ❤
So beautiful Chloe..I LOVE YOU
Skillfully sung performance. Congrats Miss Bailey!
Vocals 🔥
Coco Jones should do one next
here skin is PERFECT. very cool style🤟
Chloe is def IT! I She's so unproblematic..I really don't understand the hate people have for her. This was LIT! I need to see her LIVE!
❤❤❤
Her vocals truly speak to my soul, and she gives life to every note 🥺She's young, fresh, and full of charisma and since the debut of Chloe x Halle you could tell a career will skyrocket !
She’s so beautiful sheeshhhh
Lead guitarist looks like Regina King
Hey bassist 😍
The hate is BC she is so talented and her fan base wants to hear the vocals and production. It’s there but distracted by allot of other things.
Love it❤
All I hear is Beyoncé I can’t take her serious.
i love how she giggles throughout the performance! her personality is bomb!
Chloe grew on me in the best way. I luv her voice. She is so talented. Stay blessed Chloe.😊
I love me some Chole she is talented and so beautifulhow can people hate her like what 💕💕🫶🏽
Yassss Chloe!!!! Been advocating for you since forever and forever will!!!! A beast, love you forever 🩷🩷🩷
She just needs to stay consistent as times goes on we gonna need her for sexy grown folk jams.  Jazz joints. Whew , Issa vibe
Chloe is insanely talented I can't wait for more music for this queen
Woah the intro ... Chloe ATE ...
Chloe's ... insane! like how!!!!!
This was really good, and Chloe looks beautiful!  It is refreshing to just hear her beautiful voice and see her sunny personality without all of the EXTRA stuff.  I don’t mean to pile on but I am in the camp that wishes that she would do LESS.  That said, it’s her life and she can do whatever she wants to with it.  I still love her as an artist… 😊
ahhhhhh yes! That old school talent! Not my favorite music but I can sure appreciate how good it is! She is incredible. Ugh I've been dying to say that about a new pop artist for so long lol.
@9:05 that run was INSANE 🔥 the texture, execution and tone was amazing. I can tell she meant that “You could be somebody elseeeee Elleee elseee”. I felt that lol
The arrangements with the horns and bass are fire 🔥✨ … lowkey liking this vibe more than a few of the original versions 🫣
Wow
She is a great singer and performer...but the songwriting is meh...just my opinion...talented good looking girl tho.
The musicians are supporting her perfectly! The balance allows her to SHINE so beautifully! Congrats Chole on a phenomenal performance and all that you continue to do!🎉💜✨
Very talented as a unit/band 👏🏿👌🏿 Very good Vocalist 👍🏿  Greetings from Uganda 🇺🇬👊🏿🖤
Yes Sis! ✍🏾👏🏾
She needs to make this version of Surprise available on streaming services🥵
It's just the type of lyrics she chooses her voice is s beautiful just not for this type of music . I won't be surprised if she has an only fans .
Body do and transition to I dont mind was something else. And I have to admit, i like this Body do version better than the clip version... and that speaks volumes of how good of a singer she is and her band too! All my divas have that better live than studio thing
Wearing a cross while cursing and singing about fornication… interesting. Beautiful voice tho.
Love Chloe
everyone in the band is having such a good time, it's really lovely
This was a great display of her true authentic talent and range. Great Tiny Desk 👏🏽
In awe from the first 30 seconds 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Such talent 🔥🔥🔥
Beautiful performance ❤❤
This girl has the makings of a Diva. A real Diva. God bless you, Chloe.
The wackiest performance
I will always rock with Chloe !!! ❤❤❤❤
Wow… i’ve already respected her as an artist, but this entire performance made me adore her even more! Pure freaking talent!!!!
Love that women-majority band.  ❤
Love her! ❤
A standing ovation👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
She killed it.Welldone Chloe🎉🎉🎉🎉
Wow! No background singers and she KILLED this!
🙌🙌🔥
Such an IMMENSE amount of talent being wasted 😔😔😔 I seriously pray she gets a new team that TRULY CARES about her and her image/sound, so that we can revel in everything that the TRUE FANS know she is capable of. And keep your “hater” comments to yourself, because those of us that KNOW the industry, know that what I’m saying is truth. We literally want nothing but the best for Chloe. So if this triggers you, sorry, but not sorry. Love ya Chloe!!!!
Add Dr. Jennifer Lincoln next time
That cheatback goes hard ❤ 🫶🏽
She’s talented sing dance and writes and produces her music
Beautiful! Thank you for your gift Chloe!! ❤ Smiling the whole time 😊
👏
The girl is just purely talented! All the hate about what people think she should or shouldn’t do or be is just that, HATE! You be you girl and just keep pushing. At the end of the day you are f’ckin TALENTED and GIFTED! Everything else will fall into place eventually.
Her voice is golden 🔥🔥😳
I know alot of people hate to compare her to beyonce but I love it!! To me it means people can see the greatness in her talent and know her journey is goin to prove so many people wrong! Keep it going chloe‼️‼️
❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
Beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
My respects to the bassist

Chloe is a full-grown woman, super talented, I hope her next album she brings adult contemporary music and less pop teenage talk.
SUPERB!

She’s so sweet; her and her sister, watched them growing up and love seeing their growth and can’t wait to keep supporting

UGH SHE FINALLY GIVING SURPRISE HER FLOWERS AGAIN 😩‼️

🔥🙌🏾👏🏾🔥🙌🏾👏🏾
What a talented queen 👸🏾 you can tell that she loves to perform 💐
I LOVE YOU 💖😁🥰😍😍
You can definitely tell she’s Beyoncé artist, so freaking talented
BEST TINY DESK CONCERT EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
‼️🔥💙🩵💙🩵💙🩵🔥‼️
There’s no evident reason to question her talent. Moving past that, we should discuss in an empowering way how her approach to the audience is (more based on her personality, so organically resonating, yet let’s not forget behind the artist there’s a whole PR firm) heavily based on the years her music’s inspiration comes from. The whole thing sounds nostalgic and familiar enough to charm anyone! It’s quite the business move and a considerable homage to the artists that laid the notes she now plays in her songs
Remarkably magnificent A1 talent💯💕🔥💕🔥💕🔥💕
this is so beautiful
Real, Raw, & Unique ❤❤❤❤❤❤
👍👍👍👍👍💯💯💯💯💯🆒🆒🆒🆒🆒
COME ON MISS BAILEYYYYYYY!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Beautiful! The vibe of that first song is dope!❤
'Cheatback' my favorite, all sounds better live .💎✨
She’s so lovely ❤
she pretty, talented, funny, charismatic and the full package in general. Def need more support!!! ✨👏🏻
Chloe is giving what she ALWAYS gives— sheer talent!! 🙌🏽💯 Oh and the beauty is what it is too…undeniable!! ❤❤ Let’em eat cake Chloe!!!!
This Sista is badd!
Beyonce wanted her to be good but not this good😢😅😅😅
Such a beautiful young lady with a beautiful voice
I really enjoyed this tiny desk concert with Chloe Bailey. She is very talented. I hate that she gets so much scrutiny for just being herself. She seems like such a beautiful soul. Keep doing your thing Chloe. 👏🏽💓
In pieces is so beautiful
I’m confused why worried wasn’t ever a hit single cause It goes hard
I come back everyday to get you the views you deserve 1 Million
Finally proper album promotion. Everyone just drops albums these days w an ig post
No wonder beyonce loves her
Your voice is so beautiful and so are you!! Wishing you all the success that you DESERVE!! God Bless! 🙏🏾❤
I love Chloe so much, so talented and such a sweetheart ❤
I hate when amazing voices get wasted on bad songs like this 😩
Even her band seem like proud of this performance ! The way they look at her don't lie. Beyoncé influence is in here, love it !!  This concert is in my playlist now!
Pleaaase release this as an album
Personality, Charisma, Professionalism and a real talented vocalist/ future icon🤩 We needed a Chloe ♥️♥️❤️♥️❤️🙌🏾
i love her makeup and hair so pretty. shes getting better live get it chole
this is not bad commenting this , awesome
This is what it looks like when an artist has been DEVELOPED. In this day and age artists like her are very few and far between. Stage presence, vocal training, musicianship…our girl has it ALL. That’s why she attracts such hate because she is a light and shows people how mediocre they really are. But a REAL artist would be inspired not intimidated by her!
with Chloë’s vocals and presence and the band and their cohesiveness, they gave us one of the best tiny desk performances. i am so proud of Chloë and her journey 🩵
Theres no denying Chloe has the talent not to mention she's gorgeous. She has the voice, with those vocals and breath control, and the looks. The personality, charisma and she can dance too. SHE HAS EVERYTHING. But her songs are GARBAGE. She needs better producers and most importantly great song writers. She can be huge.
I called her "Sunshine" when I worked on Grownish and I'm happy to see her sun STILL shines through. I am truly proud of this young lady!!!
Chloe still bae though fw y'all talking about
serving vocals and kim possible realness,,, iconic
Wow she killed it 💐💐
Wow tini did it again....for me another changing life music moment  One word? Thanks!!!
This concert is impeccable!
My Fav TD performance next to Anderson Pak. These songs transitions are fire!!!
Such a beautiful bold queen. Keep going. We rooting for you!
Yasss Chloe!!!!
When she is Singing it’s Fire!🔥🔥🔥 🤍🤍🤍 So amazing.
This is awesome!! Thank you Tiny Desk for letting me know so many amazing artists. For some reason this one made me think that having Maysa Leak in a Tiny Desk would be incredible.
Rainha da voz, do RnB e da presença de palco ❤ Maravilhosa
Heyyyyy Ms.Bailey!!! 😍😍😍😍😍
How can you not buy this album after seeing this. It’s so good! It would be timeless with a different choice of some lyrics. Good job, Chloe!
Chloe is a natural talent for sure!!! She has a beautiful voice. ♥️😊
Hand me a  jacket!, i got chillssssss! 🩷🖤🥺
incredible artist!
It sounds like Beyonce wants to be too much. She's good, but I'm not a fan of the sound. I like different that sounds original, but you can still hear the influences. Sounds like she only has one.
Chloe!!! You did that!! I love your talent
Voice is fire
You did spectacular Chloe!!!!❤🎉
EXCELLENT WORK CHLOE 😍💛
This was the worst tiny desk and I thought I loved Chloe. This music is for thirsty side chics when Chloe should be giving us main character energy.  Vocals were great, songs are trash and I see why her album tanked
I swear she is giggliest ! It’s so cute and her vocals is crazy!!
Yo Chole, you understand the assignment ❤
When she sang “in pieces” wow…I cried feeling all of the emotions she emitted into the words of this song. Such a beautiful voice and a beautiful soul! I absolutely love you girl!!!!!
i love me some Chloe i hate all the hate she gets cause she’s so talented😩
Girl, you better sing! I have chill bumps 😮
Knocked her second tiny desk performance right out the PARK!
All I can say is BRAVO!!!
Chloe is such a masterpiece ❤❤❤
Like her or not; agree with her music and what she does to display her creativity or not…you cannot deny that she has tremendous talent. And this girl exudes passion for her style of music
I thought Tiny Desk concerts where for legends…
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 STRAIGHT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I just love her energy,voice, confidence when she preforms! ❤ i really enjoyed this ❤ She’s truly made for this 😊
🗣️💪 This girl is talented ‼️It ain't even funny 😂
That first song was sooo 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
YESSSS SO CLASSY!!!!!!! So refreshing!!!
A maioral ❤❤❤❤❤
🔥
❤❤❤
Chloe has a lot of potential, the potential to be a great vocalist, but I feel like she needs to find her own voice/singing style. She’s very influenced by Beyoncé’s way of singing and I don’t think that suits her voice. Just my opinion
❤❤❤❤
Y'all can't get a million views but there is over a million I sat followers. 😂 That tells me people are fake followers on insta😂
of course she is beautiful and highly talent. what bothers me is hollywood's satanic industry doing these diamonds be silly, oversexy and even dirty to aledgelly sell more... look to doja cat.
True talent.
does anybody know what's her hairstyle name I love it
PERIOD CHLOE ❤❤❤❤
OMFG this band!
THAT... GUITAR... PLAYER... THOUGH!!!
I love her confidence And she is still young. My age. I pray for bigger things for her. Love Chloe from south Africa ❤
Beautifully done Chloe! So glad I got to see her earlier this year.
Her vocals and the band, insanely good!!
Cool🎉
Not a hater..... a congratulator!👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Wow pure talent!!! 🎉
Omfg ❤
She was good…..Durand was still the best!!
I love how throught the video you can see the band react to her artistry. Chloe is baaaaaad man!
Chloe is a great performer and singer! First time watching her in concert. Had me singing along to songs I don’t even know during Saturday morning breakfast. This was fun!
Her and her sister are so talented their parents are blessed to have two successful daughters who are actually talented. And i love how their hairstylist is so versatile with their locs. Love to see it.
🏃🏾‍♀️🏃🏾‍♀️🏃🏾‍♀️🏃🏾‍♀️ to go stream In pieces. Yes, I was sleep on how amazing she is.
People try to compare her to Beyoncé and that’s there too but let’s not forget how crazy talented Aaliyah’s last album Aaliyah was . She was so creative with every song . The beat shifted and changed and it was an amazing listen .
Chole bringing the soul back in love music . I think live soulful  music is her niche as an artist .
🔥🔥🔥🔥
She sounds just like Bey🐝
No I didn’t know she was such a good singer one of the best girl you can sing your voice gives me chills and I really don’t get that 💃❤️❤️you Clo clo
Love her❤
I love this 🥰
She knows she’s good at what she do❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
🔥🔥🔥
She is her MC her background and her own hypeman ....vocals are absolutely beautiful and flawless
Singing come on Chloe. Come on….. I don’t know where we going but let’s go.
The band and her vocals on surprise is amazinggggg ❤❤❤❤ she is so beautiful. Love the honey gold braids🔥🔥🔥
Chloe really is so talented. I hope she just continues to do her thing and ignore the negativity. She can do anything she puts her mind to.
talented girl but too much clothes on
Smooth smooth band 😊
The haters need to find a life and have something to look back on because life is too short to harvest negative thoughts.  Chloe is living hers to the fullest
Shes definitely creating a lane! 20 years from now shes going to be the mother of some kind of musical movement. Shes definitely going to pivot the industry. Give her time! its going to happen. Shes like fine wine as she matures she'll only get better and more refined in her vision and that vision will grow into a movement and inspire so many after.
chloe 😍😍😍💙💙💙
Incredible ❤
her energy, cadence, and of course her skillsss are beyond magnetic!!
Her and her sisters voices are amazing.
I wish she’s would do more of these performances 😊none of the over sexualised stuff
Please have Tinashe do a tiny desk concert 🙏🏽🫶🏽
Chlöe is everything.
I see why Beyonce didnt promote her.. couldn't handle the competition. Smh.
❤❤🔥🔥🎤
Girl, you should try country, dancehall, house and another genres, you can do everything. Not only the sexy pop style. Mark Ronson’s music is a good example.
This is so beautiful. Great talent, personality, confidence; I love 💓💓💕💕
The way the lady playing the guitar is smiling at her is me HAHAH
This tiny desk helped showcased her raw gift I'm sending so much prosperity, peace loving energy to her success 💯
I see why beyonce didn't help promote her career she is a real threat she actually better then beyonce even tho that's her inspiration💯
Alot of us were holding on to her childhood like overly protective aunties like Chlo why is you growing up sooooooooo fast, you got time for that. When 'In Pieces' initially dropped I heard it and remember how much my heart fluttered and how proud I was of our internet niece for how she intentionally arranged her album and how evident her voice had matured and of her incredible control and just in complete awe. You have to step back and realize that she's now an adult woman, liberated. This entire performance gives me mature version of YouTube Chlöe back when she and her sister arranged their covers to sound like original songs by them. To Chlöe, we're very proud of you and the work you contribute to the entertainment and music industry.  You're really an out if body experience, truly 1 of a kind, super human and keep being amazing
What a TALENT ❤
Not Gonna Lie I Have a been waiting on This Tiny Desk 😎😉😅😅😍😘
She is underrated. That's all I have to say
I like these versions even better. She is too dope. 🔥
Erykah Badu and Beyonce in one
Nobody ever said she was untalented. We just aren't buying the over s3xuality from Chloe
❤❤❤❤❤ yasssssss Chloe👏🏾👏🏾💕💕💕😝😝🥰🥰so beautiful and flawless Great Job 🎉
Watched this unbiased and not knowing a single song.. but this was great❤
Why no Pray It Away 🥲
So happy she sung all my favs from the album 🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Chloe is just awesome . I to love her . Talent for days❤❤❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love these versions of her songs. her voice is so raw and controlled. amazing
Talented and beautiful
The band showed major love. Her vocals are amazing.
This Chloe! This! We need MORE OF THIS! You never needed any of that extra ish. This is type of performance that we want to hear from you. Keep them catsuits.  That voice needs no distractions.
It’s 6:51 for me! Her voice perfectly harmonizes with the instruments. Kudos to them all, I’ve never heard anything like that before. 👏🏽👏🏽
At my BIG age, I’m happy, excited, and proud to say I’m proud on my industry NeiceyPooh!! This baby child got IT!!!
Chloe's music have been helping me so much in building my confidence!!! I love her so much!! She's so talented yet humble!!!
I'm so proud of her and forever a fan! Magically gifted on every level!
Giving Beyoncé lil sister I love it
I enjoyed this 🙌🏾❤️🙌🏾
She’s definitely super duper talented!!! ❤
THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT!
Amazing amazing amazing. What a talent.
her giggles are adorable
Chloe is so gifted!!! Her style, personality, stage presence and definitely vocals ain't to be played with!!! O. K. ❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fully enjoyed!❤
This is phenomenal. I like her live much better than her mixed songs. She’s sooo good and doesn’t need any extra production over her voice.
She ain’t Been in the game long enough to do a Tiny desk foh
❤
But lol the last song😂. 💃🏽too many ppl relate
Mama Medusa 4Iver❤🎉
This was so unmoving, I hope she really finds her own sound
Her talent matches her beauty get it girl
She's  So Talented
Chloe should definitely go with this more acoustic effortlessly sexy vibe. It works for her.
Such a class girl
I saw the clip on Instagram and immediately wanted to come to utube to witness THIS! I dont even know where to start!! The breathe control- just like Megan's tiny desk!!! Out of this World!! What she does musically!!! She up there!!! With the best of the best-- Jasmine, Bey, Mariah,Adele & the musical Bible herself- Bran!!!! Chloe i pray has longevity!! Her voice is so versatile- she is gonna crossover ALL genres!!! 10 stars!! Did u hear her harmonize perfectly like she got backup singers!!! I 💞wanna hear those vocal coaches critique THIS masterpiece!! Band 🔥
THATS MY GOOD SISSSS RIGHT THERE!! ❤😊
That second song was everything how she transitioned on every element of that song was bananas!!!
Creative genius. Beautiful woman. Resilient. So proud of her. She radiates joy and passion. You can tell she really gives her all to her vision. It’s understandable that Beyoncé signed her. And, she’s still transparent and emotional. She’s authentic talent. Go Chlo! I love both of the sisters. Such pure raw talent.
Tiny desk can y’all strategically place the ad between 2 songs & not have the song cut off for a paid ad.
I love her vocals n don’t care what none of the haters say abt her
She gave me Brooke Valentine vibes with the look and the vocal tones. I would to see them collaborate.
I absolutely LOVE her
The fact that she sung “In Pieces” lifted me up! I LOVE that song sooooo much🩵
Chloe and Halle are both Beautiful and sooo talented!!! I hope they don't stop what they do, they're very gifted 😇😍🎵💕🔥💯
❤❤❤❤
she had NO background vocals. she a beast!! so talented
I don't understand how people don't like her. She's unproblematic, beautiful, a good singer, and a good dancer. Not to mention she's being mentored by the best.
Them vocals Lawd 😬🥶😱 She got voice tricks and so much control. No one can deny her talent. She works hard and it shows.
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
This just moisturized my skin, oiled my scalp and grew my locs 5 inches
Her lane may not be mainstream music, but why not Broadway?? I think she would be great  !!
this is so good. Chloe is amazing
Alittle Beyoncé flavor with alittle janelle !!! Love it
Yesssss Chloe ❤❤
This woman 🥹🙌🏽🔥
I just know Halle is in the audience, I love them. Vocalists 🔥
Perfeita
Is no one gonna talk about her hair though!? 😍
Yay!!! She is fully clothed😂😂😂😂😂
The fact she can command attention in any environment 🔥🔥🔥 Chloe has that super star quality, can wait to see her journey father on ❤
She got me boppin and having chills and all the feels I love her!!!
Her vocals are FLAWLESS. I just hoped her mic was tuned better cause the instrumental is a bit too loud. Nevertheless she’s amazingly talented and pretty ❤
That’s how it’s done Chlöe. Job well done, sis 👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾 you ate up this tiny desk concert 🔥 🔥 🔥  ❤️ 🍀 ☘️
Yassssss Chloe❤❤🥰🥰
she makes the secular soulful.
YASSSSSSS !!
Only thing I hated about this is that it had to end
The FUTURE.🤍
In Pieces, the album as a whole, should have been way bigger than it was. Such an underrated masterpiece. Worried is one of my favorite songs ever!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ms. Bailey if ya nasty!! 😂😂🩷
This woman's vocals are crazy.💙💜💙💜
Angazi nokuthi ngithini Wow
By the way Body Do sounds much better than the original version
Why is cheat back a whole bop?
Chloe & Halle I have 4 kidsi been watching y'all for a very long time I love the sister bond you are the most 2 beautiful black woman 🖤 I have ever seen keep up the good work ladys
Always riding for team Black girl ❤ Go Chloe!!
Hmmm, Chlöe have always been an amazing talent with great VOCALS...one of the best VOICE in music right now. I don't know any artist of her generation whose Live VOCALS can rival that of Chlöe. No wonder she gets so much HATE for no effing reason. All bc they wish their fave is the one getting all the attention chlöe is getting. No wonder they refused to buy  her album n trash talk the songs on the album without even paying attention. Above all of that chlöe went on tour n SOLD OUT all her dates. Now she's on the 2nd phase of her tour. Dear chlöe please give us a medley of in pieces album at the VMAs. I know you're not the recipient of the Michael Jackson vanguard award but we deserve a medley.
OMG finished way too fast, why is this so short?!! No Treat Me?? 😭😭😭😭
Fire that agent
Chloe's giggle can take you to paradise
Let me guess, the best singer at the church in a small town? Let her know that auto tune is NOT on.
Tiny desk, keep inviting Chloe please
This in pieces should feature a big movie... Chloe I love you so much, all the way from Africa
Yes young lady 😍😍 loving it!! Pieces ❤❤❤
I am Chloe, miss Bailey if you're nasty
I’m so excited! These ads need to hurry up! ❤ Chloe
I so much love Chloe
Is there anyone more TALENTED ?! NOPE....❤❤
She’s UNREAL 🥰😍😍 AND SHES INCREDIBLY TALENTED 👏👏👏
PLZ GET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VVICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET VICTORIA MONET!
Love how hype the band is.
too much theatrics, you get so lost and don’t understand anything that’s going on. amazing vocalist, amazing vocals but it’s too much
Her vocals n realisation of self is everything🔥,,,her smile is soo cute!
Cheatback is 🔥!
Every time she sings it puts me to tears. I hate that ppl have so much negativity towards her. But that’s ok Chole you keep on rising like the star you were destined to be. God bless you, your endeavors, and your family!
Dang.
Chills.
I think she simply understands live performances. This is what I miss watching .
I really liked this performance, there's been a few times I was like (side eye) but I really like this performance for her.
Young Beyoncé ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Tiny Desk has a way with improving songs
No words...
yesss Chloe!! THis girl is one of the most talented artists out. Keep pushin Chloe!! 🥰
I understand her wanting to have fun in her artistry. But THIS is her sound
Chole is SOMETHING SERIOUS - HER VOICE- ESPECIALLY LIVEEEEE IS SOOOO INSANE. BAR FAR ONE OF THE GREATEST SINGERS IN THE INDUSTRY PERIODT
Chefs kiss ☺️☺️☺️🥰 go Chloe!!!
Chloe is Top Tier PERIOD, even through her growing phase she still delivers quality vocals, entertainment, attitude she is that girl
One thing Ms Bailey gon' do is PERFORM! She was born to be a performer. And her vocals are just marvelous!
Talented, beautiful, and confident. WE LOVE TO SEE IT!!!!
This young lady is a beautiful moment.  Had to fight the urge to go slice Funky Dineva tires.  💯
These trumpets sit perfectly in the mix. Fantastic performance all around.
I need her to officially release this whole thing💕
She deserves so much more attention than she gets she’s just too talented
she can get it
Chloe & In Pieces are FIRE!!!! Cop this album ASAP!!!💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love me some Chloe❤❤❤
I loooove you Chloe  Great job
00:00 Suprise 2:30 Body Do 5:26 I dont mind  8:02 Worries 11:26 In pieces 15:55 Cheatback
i love how she laugh all along! what a beautiful soul
The only thing is she kind of sounds like Beyonce and it people be saying she is copying but hey at least she gets Beyonce as her mentor 😊
She is super gifted!!!
She's REALLY good! 🙂 This is my first time hearing her sing. I don't follow her or anybody really. Lol
Hard ❤
I love her so much. She's such a good musician.
We all know why they hate SHE too goodtt that’s why😂
❤❤❤💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾👸🏾👸🏾👸🏾👸🏾
ARTIST!
Don’t let the haters distract you. Chloe is that girl! Her talent speaks for itself! You can tell she’s put time & effort into her craft & it’s paying off.
ahhhh I saw Taylor Gamble and got so excited. if you see this Taylor, I love you so much!! 💛💛
Pure talent. However, too much profanity.   Not sure what category to put her in. You need to win all age groups to be a superstar.  All that profanity puts you in  one category
Yes i love this! She's such a great talent!
Ok Ms Bailey...when are you coming to Paris. Cuz baby this was 🔥🔥🔥
Thank you NPR, this is what I want to see. This live is Amazing.  Hope I'll have any single chance to see your stage! Love you クロエさん from🇯🇵🫶
Chloe you are amazing … ❤️❤️❤️
The only problem with Chloe is that she's blooming at a time when machines are glorified over actual art. Where artists are made to compete with versions of themselves created in binary.   A rose growing from concrete.
Gioorlll I live for this but can we talk about her hair 😍😍😍
Wow! I loved the entire performance! I love her voice in this setting!! She doesn't need any fancy beat, that's how talented she is.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Pop POP ya bdy lik deezzz!!!
So when is the collab with Victoria Monet coming Chloe?? I need that please!!🫶🏾
That's my girl, Miss Bailey. Go head on now!! Keep dping ya thang.
I'm so happy for Chloe, i feel like she finally found herself as an artist. She doesn't need to be oversexualized. This is pure talent! Please make an album that sound like this, it will be a success for sure.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
so beautiful. she’s amaaazing.
QUE NIVEL DE MUJER! dijo Luismi 😍
Beautiful Job 🤍🤍😮‍💨
Reminds me of tina marie
She beautiful and talented ❤❤❤❤❤Do your thing Chole. She has a beautiful spirit!!!
Too dramatic
For her to have so much talent!! With this much talent you don’t need much sexuality, but Chloe overly expressing sexuality is because this industry is not allowing her to express her versatility. Because of this, she believes (in my opinion) that this is what her audience wants from her. Whyte ppl didn’t want to see her wholesome image. I know because I looked at the views of certain shows. Chloe is gifted from the Gods, I only wish she knows this for herself. Leave these thugs alone, get with a man that will promote her talent , give her inspiration, coming from high vibrational love rather than toxicity.
This lady is sangin' her pretty face off! I see now why they be hatin'! 😂 Get it, Chloe! ✊🏾 Keep makin' 'em mad, sis!
como é bom admirar você, Chlöe ❤
a maior e melhor artista atual
She really is talented, & beauty, is a threat to most women, but stay classy Chole, & you will shine ⭐️⭐️⭐️
For a second, I believed the haters when they said her album was bad.  This is MUSIC! Guuuuys... are you hearing this?!
Wow.  She is good
I mean I like her but She just so corny.
ive watched this about 100x already and im not ashamed about it
It’s giving Beyoncé in her early days😍😍😍
quebraaaa irmã ❤️‍🔥
Chloe is fiyah
I don’t dislike her, & she’s absolutely stunning voice is amazing as well but her voice wonders quickly & I think it’s bc she’s absolutely engaged in performing. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it can be. I’m rooting for her!
This was a vocal masterclass!
She a baby Beyoncé she sound just like her
Just beautiful, pure beauty!!! 😍 ❤❤❤ Chloe is the whole package!
Salute to Chloe!
Her giggles at the end are so cute! Everything about her is perfection!
Chloe is a quuuueeeennn!!!! Like just beyond talented & beautiful! They just love to hate her, it's crazy!
Chloe is very talented
🥹🩵🇧🇷
Beautiful
She's the moment ❤
pqp essa mulher é perfeita
i've been a fan of Chloe and Halle for a while, and I really like what Chloe is doing on her own. What a joy to watch her growing into this gorgeous talented woman <3 WOW she's good
Dang she was going in 🤣🙈🔥🔥🔥🔥
Loveeeeeee her so beautiful
I LOVE LOVE THIS. I love the smiles her team has. They are all enjoy it and we are enjoying it too!!
I fell in love listening to her perform “body do”
crazy good vocals. sounds just like the studio
You hoes could never that's why yall mad
Beyonces dubai run could’ve been sang in the intro🔥🔥
She sounds bomb! 🔥
She is just dope. Haters are clearly jealous, as they should be!
Okay, reading the comments, everyone is like oh she's so talented. Stop hyping trash. She's not the worst artist but you I don't like this style of music. Call me a hater all you want. It's just to much going on and her voice isn't that great. Lyrics lack substance. Even the background seems disorganized. It's a no for me.🙁
Shes a pure talent, Chlöe you gonna make it big girl ✨
🖤🖤🖤
Unrelated to literally everything but I feel like y’all should get laufey in here ❤❤❤
I love you chlöe <333
❤❤❤❤❤💐💐💐💐💐🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow wow 🤩.,,,. This is really therapeutic! Her music automatically gets the listener confidence….. Go girl ! Spread the positivity….  God is on your side . 😘😘😘🔥
🍃💛💚💙🍃
I swear if she went NEO SOUL she would be FIRE!!!! Her voice is lovely at this pace. That opening song was 🔥🔥🔥 THIS ENTIRE SHOW WAS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Chloe is exactly who she thinks she is.... I love her
Unreal!🏆
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amazing feel good set❤
WE STANNNN THE PRINCESS
YES CHLOEEEEEEE
SOOOOOO TALENTED, DIVINE AND STUNNING CHLOE. You move with the meaning of Grace wow, never let anyone tell you different!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
💜💜💜😍
Talent speaks for itself. She is all we need in music 🤌🏽 aaaand her personality is everything ✨love heeeeeer 💗
Absolutely incredible! Her voice is an instrument 👏🏽👌🏽❤️
chloë mfking baileyyyyy everyone!
Miss Bailey if you nasty 🤭🤭
What an odd comment to make. You're too grown for this. Anyone reading this comment, she doesn't sing like this because that's the studio version and the songs aren't jazz influenced like this. But her album does have an incredible jazz-infused intro that leads you into a soulful, R&B lead single, Pray It Away which is amazing. Chloe's album showcases her vocals and creativity as a producer. She's the vocal producer for her album, which is no surprise seeing as she produced a significant chunk of her and her sister's, Halle (yes, of The Little Mermaid), 5-time Grammy nominated albums, The Kids Are Alright and Ungodly Hour.   So don't be afraid to check out Ms Chloe's debut album, In Pieces, you'll be just as amazed. Also, the writer a over is a certified hater because any veteran fan of Chloe or Halle, or Chloe x Halle, knows to expect their live versions of their music to be ×1000 better than the studio version, not because they're horrible singers or because the music is terrible, but because they're just that good at elevating the experience every time!
Why would someone hate on Chloe though, WHY????  Those giggles in-between are everything!
🔥🔥🔥
she's sooo good! i love her and halle way too muchh!
Why did this tiny desk lowkey make me emotional lol 😭😭   This was so amazing Chloë, you are DEFINITELY THAT GIRL.  Absolutely beautiful performance
True and effortlessly talented ❤
Yes she’s talented, but I dislike this character of a woman. It’s the same old toxic storyline 🤦🏾‍♀️
NOTICE:  She DOES NOT sing her songs NOTHING LIKE THIS ON HER ALBUM 💔👀💯🫡 Do not buy her album expecting NONEOF THESE SONGS ON THIS VIDEO to sound anything LIKE THIS. Unfortunately. If she would’ve sangggggg like THIS it would’ve been more interesting. Sad but true Chloe.
Only miserable people hate on her. She’s naturally talented ❤
Cloe😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I will forever be the Bailey's sisters biggest fan....the authenticity and how they do it effortlessly is pure talent
16:06 yeah this the one she likes lol. she getting into it at last
I wish she song Looze U
Flawless as always, haters will do their job and hate!!! Flourish madam!
MSBAILEY YOU ARE SO FIIIIINEEEEE
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
perfect for tiny desk!
Chloe is exquisite.
I love you Chloe girl ❤❤❤❤
no but how she completely reinvented all these songs is crazy she really is such a force
She is just.... a Talent! Be yound  MEASURE! She's amazing!
Impeccable performance!!
Superb
360!
THAT WAS AMAZING!!!!!
chloe is such a talent . she deserves more !
Absolutely in love with this!!!  This live version sounds so amazing and truly lets us hear your beautiful voice emotions 😍😍
Wow, surprised to see her with clothes on
Big mistake leaving "For The Night" out. Who is helping her make decisions??
She pays attention to every little detail, it's inspiring to watch
She is such a beautiful,  confident, talented young lady❤
LeToya Luckett next!
please start respecting babygirl UHKAY?!?!?!
The beat on surprise gives me Take a Little Trip by Minnie Riperton
I hated on this girl..When she's amazing in every way. 🙌🏾
Breezy need to do one of these
Get it Lil sis! Keep being you❤ @Chole
💜
I love this I want to see more of this with her ❤❤❤
CHLOE❤
Omg i enjoyed this.  She is so talented ❤❤
Норм.
I love when she does performances like this. The overboard on the choreography and bedazzled bodysuits take away from our ability to connect sometimes. She doesn’t need all of that
This live instrumentation absolutely suits & highlights Chloes awesome vocal talent. She has the vocal strength to not have to rely on auto tune, back tracks, and/or heavy synths & percussion. Hopefully this more stripped down production & style similar to this performance come to her studio recordings as well. This is top tier live music.
Saaaang baby girl! ❤❤❤
interesting seeing her sing with cloths on. I think she overdoes it with the sexy and the dancing. Her voice is phenomenal.
This is gold. Hope she is proud of this performance.
im unimpressed she sounds like every r@b chick thats out right now.i didnt hear anything that separates her from the rest.
i neeeed her and Raye to collab
I think the issue with her album is it was too poppy and polished compared to her and her sister's comeup. A lot of autotune and synthesizers. She needs more instruments to compliment her talent. Less manufactured sound imo.
I honestly love her. Keep shining!❤❤
The amazing
The Best ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ok talent come thru….
I don't mind listening to these vocals over and over. I enjoyed this. ❤❤❤
She killed it🔥
Stunning
I need a full version of this body do mix. Wow
You can tell by their faces that her band is ALWAYS having a good time ❤❤❤ lovely!!! Such a talent!
She’s a vocal beast 🔥
Yess sis ❤❤❤. This is enjoyable. Great work Chloe
I love this so much, we love you being true to you. no matter what.
CONGRATS , I DIDNT KNOW SHE HAD ENOUGH SONGS FOR A CONCERT! But I’ll support and listen!
PURE TALENT!!!
She is incredible❤❤❤
Signature Halle/Chloe sound:   surprise (0:34, 0:47), side (0:50)...   ya'll know what I mean? It's like they sing ending with "eye" in the sultriest, coolest way. I love both of them individually and together.
Soooooooooooo imma need this as an official audio release.  Fantastic job at creating a moment!
she needa realize all these versions with the band instead
Undeniable talent, so proud of you Chloe ❤
I love hearing her and Hale giggle ❤
Ugh music is just always so much better live!!!!!
Phenomenal vocals!!!🤗🥰😉
Make an acoustic album bae 🤍
People ask for real! People ask for transparency! People ask for talent! People ask for beauty! People ask for confidence! People ask for great music! People ask for everything! It’s when it presents itself in true form, that people realize…….THEY WERE NOT REALLY READY FOR IT!!!!! NOW DEAL WITH IT!!! Chloe is being who Chloe knows she is!!!❤❤❤❤
Aside the singer Chloe being amazing i find the ladies playing the instruments very amazing ❤
This was a really pleasant surprise from tiny desk! I really got to appreciate Chloe in a totally different way. Kudos to her and the music director for allowing the recordings to translate nicely to live.
It’s the way everyone on that stage is enjoying this performance ❤️❤️🔥🔥 Y’all aaaaaaaate!! Talent all around.🙌🏾
The way people denied her support, I would absolutely support her if she never made another album for some of these raggedy fair weather fans. They blamed EVERYTHING for their reason not to support her. Half of them haven’t even heard Sugar Symphony. They say they loved UnGodly Hour, and that’s what they was expect In Pieces to be a continuation of, but they didn’t buy that either. Ungodly Hour only sold $24,000 copies when it released. Instead of nitpicking her image. How bout actually support her the way true fans would.
yasss baby give me some soul <3333333
I clicked immediately. I love her so much. Saw her Atlanta show on the tour and I screamed so loud.
Ok Chloe im waiting on a Jazz album sis.❤🤞🏾🌿💛
She killed this.  Well done.
I was blessed to see Chlöe in concert & she was all of this plus more… Definitely a Vibe. I hate that people compare her to Beyoncé when they are DIFFERENT & she is making her own lane. I wish Chlöe so much Success 💕💕💕💕
Sheeeeeeesh ❤
Can someone tell me how they do braids while they have locs? I like them both, her and the sister.
I just saw her live last night and she is AMAZING!!!! Everything you would expect and more! Keep glowing girl!
She's def one of the biggest vocalists of this generation. I'm a a fan! Congrats on this amazingly divine gift you have and more and more success Chloe. Keep killing it!!!
Very talented but her records sales do not reflect this at all. Support her if your a fan of hers.
Get it Chloe!!
she is killing it!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Talent.
CHLOE IS THAT GIRLLLLLLL🔥🔥🔥🔥💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐
Loved it ! 😍😍😍🥺
She killed this. I loved her concert in Norfolk. I got. VIP so I got to meet her, get a photo, and do a Q&A. She is such a awesome and free spirit. I don’t care what haters say. She is killing it rn. Also waist where?
Amazing!
I feel like she shines best when there's space on the song. Her chest voice is so beautiful. In Pieces was my favorite song of this performance
Actually felt like I was in the crowd🔥
I wasn't but now I am....A fan!! This woman is TALENTED and gorgeous!! Good for her...Thank your haters because they keep you growing and humble! Much success to you Chloe❤
Love how giggly she gets 💜
I really wish she would’ve opened with In pieces. Her album is underrated I listen to it from beginning to end atleast once a day. ❤ Cheatback even sounds better in the album placement. ❤
I was a fan already, but now <3 what a talent
Mrs. Balley tem O MOLHO !!!!!!!!
I COULDN’T , STOP DANCING , LAUGHING AND JUST SEEING HER BE SO HAPPY AND POWERFUL 😂😂🍃🍃🌍🌍🪐🪐🙌🏽✨✨ I WILL MEET HER ONE DAY ! And not to far . 😉 Amen 🙌🏽✨
That was beautiful!!❤
I’ve watched this 100 times
I hadn't listened to her music, and this has made me a fan. Charisma, her voice registers, intensity, and presence sets her apart from many in the industry. ❤
I just have to say that my boyfriend just asked if I was listening to Beyonce in the shower
Not hating... But first 6mins be giving me owambe vibes. 😂
Its weird that she gets the amount of hate that she gets. She seems so nice
Talent, baby.. talent.
Why did you make the album have these edits Chloe????
Well goodness! This woman is super talented and all of the praise it warranted. I truly enjoyed this tiny desk performance. Her band is fly as well. Go ahead and fly sis.
OK NOW WE NEED HALLEEEEEEE
Quality ❤
Ion tryna hate…but how does Brent Faiyaz not have one yet😭
Chloe a producer songwriter preformer and a beautiful woman! They need to stop hating and take notes💅🏽 so proud of chloe and her growth! Sad i missedher concert again but i will be financially stable and can go live my best life soon periodtt GREAT JOB as always chloe ❤❤😊
Chloe is such a talented woman, I can’t get enough fr and her smile is so cute!!
I love how I know all of her songs and how great they sound live!!! Such a HUGE Chloe fan, keep it going girl <3
She is amazing. Her songs just aren't
2:19 is that part for me!!!
To all new YouTubers out there, Stay positive, and remember that every YouTuber starts somewhere. Keep pushing forward.
I wanna be a fan of her so bad. She’s so talented ….I just don’t care for the music she makes.  I wish she made more neo soul sounding music than r&b /pop sound cause this SLAPS!!!!
No shade, these versions I prefer more. It has a more rounded evolved  lux lounge sound. And can be timeless. Still a great artist. Nice work Chole.
I'm loving the album idk why it aint. Do well
Ehh…
11:23 In pieces was brilliant
Her laugh is like an ad-lib lol
I love this ❤
ALRIGHT NOW MS. BAILEY😍🔥 absolutely YES👏🏾 this did not disappoint.
Idc what anybody says. Chloe & Halle are unmatched & underrated. They have the most beautiful, gifted voices full of range AND they can produce & write their own music. Not to mention Chloe can dance. Ain’t nobody touching them 🔥
She has such great control. I think people have an issue with her voice because it’s so nasally now as she got older. She’s so cute when she giggles though 😢
Saw her last night live, she is beautifully talented! People are miserable. Her and Beyonce are in their own lanes, respectively. Did she get pointers and mannerisms from an idol of hers? Yes, buy most artists do. People don't know talent anymore.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Niece is talking about some grown ish! The band is on fire 🔥
WHO DID YOUR MAKE UP 🔫
So much fkn control over her voice..flowing through chest, mid, head effortless, the yodeling, the softness in the transition to head voice. Not a single person her age is singing like Chloe 😂😂 ❤️❤️❤️
YK THEM CANCERS DO IT THE BEST 🧡
This lady gives me chills 😮🔥🥰🫨
C- performance all the songs about the same thing 😐
She’s so cute. I love hearing her giggle. So pure. The talent is undeniable. Haters gon hate but she gets more love than anything. Keep shining, baby girl.🫶🏽
Her lyrics are terrible. She has a nice voice and the music is nice. She won't want to hear those lyrics when she's 40. She needs to find someone that can insinuate what she wants to say without being so forward about it.
Yessssss... she is gooood her makeup is givinggggggggg
Nah.
Chloe is a force for the generations. She is that continuing thread of songstresses from Bessie Smith, Ella Fitzgerald, Nancy Wilson, Minnie Riperton, Whitney Houston, Anita Baker, Beyonce and now Chloe & Hallie Bailey ❤
I feel she should stay as a Producer/Songwriter for a bit. For some reason, people don't resonate with her. Her lyrics, songwriting and singing is on point! People only co-sign braindead, rude people these days, And the whole Beyonce thing is overshadowing her talent.
If I was this beautiful, talented, with a nice body, and as young as she is- I would live my best life unapologetically
You can't break Chlöe. Kyla sup You stole the show 😊 And one last thing..It's gonna be tough hating on Chlöe and liking her lil girl 😄
love it. so fresh and pure. :D
h000000000000000000t. the wh0le band is h0t. x) smooth, slicky and slippy but not sleepy. x)
12:30 track = instant tears
She has it all and the only thing she needs to do is put in the time and build her catalog.
Chlöe doing what Chlöe does....DELIVERRRR. Baby sings downnnn. Such an amazing talent  and can we get some commotion for this hair? It's giving honey honey🍯. She looks 😍 😍😍. I hope she stays resilient in staying herself.
She sounds like a mixture of Beyoncé and Willow Smith, Black girl magic really is a thing🤌🏽
Go Chloe ❤❤❤ a true artist.
Such a talented beautiful Bw. She got so many haters cause they only wish their talents could be just as great🧐😂😂Keep doing you sis💪🏾You’re supporters got your back🫶🏾🫶🏾
She did so good as expected omg 💕💕
I feel like she appeals to her fans when she lets her voice shine. Hence the "too much" when the performance overshadows the voice. She's free to express herself any way she feels. So much talent.
Her musicians are really feeling it too. 😊
Chloe is so talented. She's awesome.
Awesome ❤
Let's go Chloe!!! (and band!!!  (:  )
Love herrr 💓💓💓
Girl playing the guitar.
This girl can real sing but idk it’s just not my type of music 🥴
excellent
the horns and drum machine during body do >>>>>><
Perfection Sweetheart ❤😍
The joy in the end 🥹
Love, love, love her! Keep shining bright and the world will be forced to see it! 💕
Sad she doesn’t do more of this. We don’t always need you sexualized and doing demonic rituals in your music videos. Oh yeah, guys go look up “have mercy” and the dark demonic spells she’s doing
👑Spitting out bar’s
Loved you Chloe ❤❤  Pure talented 💯
That transition into BODY DO?! 😮😭🔥
2:44 that caught me so off guard.
Very talented!! She has an amazing gift. Continue delivering those vocals and sharing with the world. Very beautiful!!
I love this rendition of surprise ❤
I'd never seen her perform since she & her sister were YouTube youngsters. she is very talented but honestly,  this doesn't live up to the tiny desk vibe.
The "Tiny Desk" you never knew you needed...I love Chloe ❤
The In Pieces version was so beautiful ❤
AMAZING — TOP 5 Tiny Desk Performances EASILY
How can you not smile when you hear her speak? 😻 I fall in love every time!
You can tell a singer is good when you see the musicians are also feeling it too! 😎
I am in awe as always, Chloe. You really master your craft & this was phenomenal!. Beautiful & talented inside out! Much love ❤❤❤❤❤
Chole's vocals, personality and performance is everything!!! Great job Chole💛 How could anyone not like her?!
She’s so fire 🔥
She is a vocalist!
Chlöe is a superstar! 😍🌟
Beautiful young lady, beautiful talent.  That’s why they’re mad
Like the diversity in the musicians, especially the bass and lead guitar.
Say whatever you want,, but y’all can’t deny that Chloe has always been talented. I love seeing her growth. Especially as an individual talent.
She. Can. SAAAANG!!
She is greatest
You better SANG!!! 💃🏾
Love Chloe so much! 😍🫶🏽🥰
I love her voice so so much. I wish I liked her debut album more- but I think these unplugged editions truly showcase an artist's talent and skill. She's incapable of making a truly bad song, even if they don't all speak to me. I love her so much, and I wish her nothing but success. I cannot believe the power in her voice. I would adore her to cover more Nina Simone songs, especially "I Got Life" and "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood", because Chloe truly blew it out of the water with the Nina Simone song she already covered. I am gonna keep my eye on Chloe Bailey forever! Truly the most amazing voice out there today, in my opinion.
I love this girl ❤
She can just yawn and it can be a grammy winning song
Honestly I’ve never really listened to their or her music…but she’s actually beyond talented and beautiful! Loved it! These arrangements are 🔥🔥🔥
Please re record cheatback without future. We need the studio and acoustic version 👍🏾
Chloe is SANGINGGGGG 🔥🔥🔥
Yes ma’am chloe ❤!!! I also love the guitarist facial expressions behind her. She definitely feeling my girl vibe 🥰!
She is giving me a mix of bey and jill scott with her voice!
These songs stripped back sound soooooo much better.
such beauty and talent! so cool seeing her on tiny desk
👏🏾 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Love this ❤❤
It is like I am watching Ariëls’ sister in concert. I can not help but see under sea plants, treasures and fish 😄
In pieces 🥺🥺🥺💝
Omg what a singer 🏆🏆🏆🏆
Not having background singers and doing all the singing yourself is wild... this is fire!
Girl can siiiiinnnnggggg
Chloe for president!!!!!
The fact i use to be a church boy and i went out in thid world tryna do sum worldy things tryna be like everyone else but i can honestly say now that im running back to the church because i understand now. Church people be so insecure and but im now realizing that's why they going to cuz they have flaws too. We all fall short of the glory everyday but the old mentality they try to act like its still ok to act like that in a church but its up to us now to change and be more about glorifying god
She’s gorgeous, she’s charming, she’s funny, she’s Sexy, she’s outrageously talented …. Why the hate ? What else do people want ???!!  I’m rooting for her….. Go ‘head queen!  ❤️
Her laugh is so beautiful
Singgggggggguhhhh
LOVE IT!!
Yes queen! ✊🏾👑🤭💐❤️
Pure talent and beauty! Them girls worked hard and deserve the recognition!
It’s just effortless! 😮‍💨
She needs to release an UnPlugged Version of her album!! It will go PLATINUM 😭
We stan talent. So happy for my girl Chloe ❤❤❤
Chloe is beautiful inside and out plus she’s very talented
Beyoncé vibes
It’s the drummer reppin’ that SF hat 💯‼️🌉
How do you fit so much talent in a tiny desk 🎉😂❤
🥱🥱🥱🥱
Now THIS is a sound I can appreciate! I would just want an old school clean album version and the explicit, I can listen to when the kiddies aren't in the car. ✨
Even the way she says N**** is cute and funny. 😂😂😂
She's just perfect
Ate and left no crumbs. This was such a great show!!!!!! 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
Chloe Fan!
She can sang
Goose bumps the whole time dope
Chloe can do no wrong
Chloe just want to do what she love to do and have fun doing it. ❤
Her voice 😮
Chloe. You did that. 💙💙💙🔥💥
Amazing talent did not need back up singers, would love to go to a concert!!
YASSSSS CHLOE!!!!❤
Wow 🔥🔥🔥
Wish these unique arrangements were on the album. This had that magic I was looking for from her debut. Bravo!
Vocals……you can’t question them. Leave this girl alone! She too talented!!! TOOOOOO talented! Pen, producer, performance……I see why they hate!
That last song... Yesss... That's talent ...
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGG YESSSSSSS CHLOE!!!!
Chloe is THAT GIRL‼️ Yes, she can be extra lol but you can’t deny the talent and the beauty.! 😍
I think some of y'all's favorite wants to sound like this.
An amazing talent ❤
this is just so good
Yay she did not worried! This was amazing, everything she does is though 😊❤
I thoroughly enjoyed this! She’s so talented ❤ I thought about Beyonce throughout the entirety of the last song (love that she displays her idol/mentor in that way but it was almost exact vocally, was it a cover or something?)
YESSSS
I LOVE CHLOE
She has the capacity to be a superstar ✨️  I can't wait to see her belt I know she can! Most new singers can't these days
Essa menina se inspirou muito na Beyoncé, é perceptível. Não é de se surpreender se a Chloe ficar muito mais famosa daqui a uns tempos. Todo o estudo, técnica e esforço, em conjunto com a personalidade imposta na voz, e esse timbre maravilhoso... ela vai longe
I don't understand why this woman gets so mush undeserved hate. This was great performance.
Chlöe is such an amazing talent. This was amazing 👏🏿👏🏿
Loved it!!! Keep Blossoming into the Beautiful, Talented, Confident woman God has Destined U to be Queen!!! 👑❤️‍🔥🎤
Such a great talent!  So proud of you Chlöe!
That was awesome! Watched it  2x
Wanna hear a solid R&B album from her…. Something to put me in my feelings, love her talent and beauty. Keep going Chloë
Vocal GOON!!  Sang biiiiih!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
The music content can definitely be better but the band is smashing. She has so much talent I'd love to hear better music versus this modern state of R&B. Nobody sings about love anymore, just trying to one up the other person
God that girl it’s just tooooo talented ! There’s no one like her in the game ! Against her those girls look like toys 😂😂😂
This girl seem to have had and continue to have the BIGGEST push in Black music but something is off with her connection with the masses.
the guitarist is the same person from the ari lennox tiny desk video!!!!!! 😍😍
💛💛💛💛💛
If you have hate for someone so genuine. The problem is ‘You’. Literally her voice speaks to your soul. Pure talent ❤, grace and beauty.
What an increeeedible performer. She naturally glows, and the haters gon hate, but she shines. So inspiring to see something embrace all facets of her individuality, her vulnerability, her sexy, and so much more. She shows us that we are more than one thing, and I am grateful to witness it.
i like the way she rides
to be this talented and THIS BEAUTIFUL???? unmatched!!!! other by than her own sister and beyonce lol
Her voice is so pure and amazing ❤
Chloe is a vibe, amazing. Is it just me i hear a little Beyonce in her voice
❤❤❤❤
I love Chloe and all her performance strength but let this prove, yet again, she doesn't need much! Her voice is so amazing, her talents need nothing extra. This was so good! Already replaying.
she's so comfortable and that's beautiful
She’s so talented & versatile 🙌🏾❤️
Alright, I need a Jazmine Sullivan collab immediately. Or even just a Jazmine verse on Cheatback
She is so gooddddddddddd!!!!!
Seeing her on Saturday. I can't wait!
The range. Such a flex
Her voice is soooo good❤❤
.... i hate that i always hear beyonce when she sings
What am I not hearing.. I’m jealous of everyone that can enjoy this as much as the comments seem. I grew up with much better live singers I feel.. also this the shortest tiny desk and weird to see someone so popular here as well.. the connections are real. 😅
Ok Chloe‼️‼️ sis gave ALL VOICE.
She’s so talented and true to herself that’s why she thrives the way that she does. I love everything about this Tiny Desk concert. Like I wanna be her friend she’s always been so cool to me. But this just even more confirms my love for miss Chloe Bailey ❤. A true artist & forever a legend!!
Come on Queen!!! Do you understand the amount of breathe support it takes to sing her songs with no seperation! You don't even hear when she take a breath! She killed it!
So much better when she performs live. A true vocalist.
Beautiful voice but why the "N-word?"...Maybe it's me?
just saw her last night, and what a performer! she loves what she does, sounds incredible live, and her energy is super infectious. she's a sweetheart and a star. 💕
Seeing her live a couple weeks ago was a TREAT. Y’all stop sleeping on this woman. A talent 🔥🔥🔥
Loved this Chloe is so talented!
Today’s my brother’s Birthday, but listening to this makes me feel Gifted! Thank you Chlöe and NPR’s Tiny Desk!
Great singer but her writing /content aint hitting for me. Good luck to her though
This was too short for me 😭 I NEED MORE OF HER.
Chlöe you rock girl!!!!
Her lyrics are so dumb thats the problem. Shes too talented for the vulgarity and shallowness and this proves it. She needs better writers/ arrangers to allow her to run on a track like she did here
Love Chloe🫶🏾🫶🏾
the fact that the band is having just as much fun playing makes me so happy
Sometimes I think I love her because I add her up into the upper echelon of our greatest singers because each of our greatest singers had their own unique sound and she has her. So does her sister. And beyoncé has hers. Our greatest female singers. You can almost immediately tell who's singing just because of their signature sound. It's one of the reasons why I knew Amy winehouse would have been so much greater if we still had her. Other artists don't sound too unique so you may end up liking a couple of songs from them that are bops, but their voices aren't unique enough to make you like. Stand them the way you stand when you houston Christina Aguilera beyond say Ariana grande. You know Tony Braxton of our greatest singers. Tina Turner, etc. Jennifer Hudson these women are so great because each of them have their own. You don't really feel like they're mimicking anybody else. People always say Chloe is trying to mimic beyoncé but I think the reason that I are attaching her to be on say is because she's on beyoncé's label and just because she has like fearsome pop songs they want to say it's just like beyoncé but no this is Chloe's sound. Beyoncé has a different sound
BEAUTIFUL voice, BEAUTIFUL energy, love the music, talent and all. I just would love to see that powerful energy directed more thoughtfully. In addition to the exes, You chose to close out your set about ‘cheating back on a n——‘? She has more depth than that, and if not go back to the drawing aboard amongst those with some depth.
15:55
lots of love for chloe :)
There it is. There's that star power, raw talent, and lovely amazing vocals. Chlöe 🤎🖤
COME THROUGH BAND!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
It’s the pianist and the bass player giving the stank crunk face. Feeling it 🔥
It took for her to be in a small room for her to be really appreciated. She really shines in this setting. Her confidence is beautiful. Go ‘head baby girl! Love her!
Such a great live performer!  Thoroughly enjoyed this!!  Loved her album, wish this version of Cheatback were on the album. 🎤💿❤️
This was beautiful! No one can deny her talent
🔥🫶🏾💪🏾
Surprise and In Pieces were amazing
Choleeeee❤
This is one of my favorite Tiny Desk Concerts of all time. Chloe hypnotizes me in pieces with her vocals. 5 stars of 5!
I love her. 10/10
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Baby is a SUPER STAR
Chloe is just AMAZING and sooooo talented and genuinely sweet. Even her laugh is so sweet and innocent like. I just love her even through the bs and haters she continues to shine and live her life as her genuine self. She hasn't fallen for feeling like she needs to have her body done or "enhance" her looks for other people and the industry. She is just amazing 🥰
🙏💎
She really is a performer, I always love her performances version better. I’m sure that she works hard to be able to perform this good, but God, her presence and talent is definitely natural, you can’t just replicate that sort of thing
Love the band, love her look, love her voice, however her lyrics lack substance and ruins the beauty of everything else
Hey voice is like butter- sheesh!! You can tell she also a musician, because she uses her voice like an instrument with so much intentionality.  No note is sung by accident- love her! 💜
This womans talent is out of this world! been obsessed since the duo but its great to see both of em shining in their own way ❤
This made me appreciate the album more. She killed this & the mic is definitely on! 👑
❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥
GO CHLOE!!!🔥
Can we have an album with her songs sung like this? Just laid back
Go off Chloe!!!!!
The giggle is everything 😍 Keep that same energy for life. I'm proud like you, my baby. Sing baby, perform baby, smile baby, dance baby win and win again, baby!
It shines as bright as the sun. Incredible what a facial expression she has when singing
Trumpeter was jamming hehe
Honey this young lady rode it out!!! Yes ma'am beautiful! Show them beautiful can mean it all spirit, mind, body, brains and talent! Foot on their necks! ❤
I love her energy, she loves what she is doing and her adorable laughs..Love u SM chlöe💖❤️
What a shame. So much talent. Such a beautiful voice. Doing way too much in her vocals, phrasing, lyrics, song arrangements.   Less is more Chloe.   Hold a simple melody, one Beyoncé vocal type riff in the song. One. Be strong.  Don’t give in. It’s not necessary and takes from the beauty of your song.   It’s like Michael Jordan doing dance moves after his dunk and trying to hype up the crowd. It’s really not necessary.
I caught off guard! I love y'all!!😭🔥❤️
Good music. It's just something weird about how she pronounces her words. Almost like she doesn't want open her mouth all the way or something IDK. 😐
This is sooo good. ❤🔥
Great performance felt like I was there❤❤
her voice im in love
YAAAAASSSSSSS Indeed!!! My girl!!!! ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
She is a genuine person and living her dream. That alone makes people uncomfortable. I’m rooting for her always. She’s going to be just fine. This is an example of that. Chloe don’t compare your journey to anyone else’s. You are an amazing talent!
Ela é uma das artistas mais completas da atualidade, muito orgulho da Chloe
Just raw talented so underrated
How many times you’ve watched this??? Yes 🔥🔥🔥😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨🔥🔥🔥🔥
NPR pleaseeeee put these tiny desks on streaming platforms
The band is on fire. Great concert……..
Ur lyingggg This rendition of body do is everythingg
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤
Chloe!!!! ma’am can you give me my edges back!? 🤯 please & thank you !! 💕
We love you Chloe❤ keep on with the good work,m supporting you just like Apollo 😂❤
Oh Chloe 😭😍
i actually appreciate her vocals and music more when she put her clothes on.
20 minutes of ABSOLUTELY AMAZING vocals!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Quite a Vibe ✨🔥India Arie but to a different level
This performance was flawless, BUT... Who the f* decided to slap an ad in the middle of her song????! And not in one of the moments the music stops? Want to strangle whoever did that
Go girl
You can see how much she loves music!! Salute to her.
This was 🔥
Chloe is talented Chloe is beautiful Chloe can sang Chloe can perform Chloe is that girl
The band is amazing
You can still Beyonce in her just beautiful too beautiful ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Chlöe didn’t disappoint ✨👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Oooooffff😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨yeesssssss maaaaaan!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Honestly why is she still underrated? Like these vocals ??????
I mean geez! This woman is amazing!
yasssssssss
I have to be honest, Chloe needs to do more soul R&B than pop R&B. Fits her voice better.
Band went crazzzyyyyy.
Chole, has something funky Dineva wish he had (talent)(beauty) and a (😺)
Vocals are 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The guitarist and the bassist, somebody get me their names
Get azealia banks on here
I wish her the best
The musicians are 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That drummer be wanting to go HAM with those sticks but instead she got a tappity tap for 20 mins hahahaha her face
Get it Chloe❤✨️✨️🎶🎶🎶🥰
No BG vocals and she still ate
YESS
The over-sexualising is not needed to sell records. The talent speaks for itself.
I wish y’all will stop with the back handed compliments, compliment the talent and keep it moving. She’s clearly making the music she wants and you staying that you prefer her doing x music is annoying, or that you’d rather she was like this and not that, or comparing her with her sister. Just stop. Enjoy or keep it moving. She’s had enough of vitriol thrown at her unnecessarily for 2 years, she’s not changing, so either enjoy the art and who she is or go look for another artist that gives you what you want. This tiny desk was amazing, and she’ll get her hearts desires and more.
Honey, this is ittt😍!!
This is the Woman i want to see and hear 💪
Amazing
She needed background singers, but not really. Would’ve been cool if Halle sing back up for her! Absolutely loooooooooved this
🫶
Not many people in Hollywood have this much likeability. I like her!
wow i mean.. didn’t expect less 😚😚 my queen
This is the kind of talent that should never go ignored. Chloe’s harmonious vocals and remarkable stage presences makes this whole thing worthwhile to watch.
Yessss CHLÖE !! you better clear the mfn room ! 😻🥰 the song worried is definitely one of my favs off the album a heavily slept on gem chloe should've made a visual to worried or " I don't mind it has a cute lil vibe makes you wanna wine your hips , 😂😩🔥
She’s a good singer but her songs are annoying. The singing rap or whatever it is, is annoying.  When she said”do you ever wonder who is f*%**+ your man?” Super cringe
She legit rapping! Sounds better than most female rappers in the industry
She has bars!
I know wonder how dope she is on stage during this tour. This was amazing, the energy, the band. Just vibes. Beautiful 🩷
Greatest vocalist of her Generation.  Pull up. Not scared. I said what I said.
Yeah this is the arragement i need the album in cause this is my 5 time listening to this today
UNREAL this level of talent and making it look easy
Very Beyonce influenced! Go Chloe!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Chloe baby u just ate this and left no crumbs ♥️❣️❤️
I enjoyed this. I really connected to her artistry with this performance.
Respectfully!!!  This Woman can SANGGGG!!!!! Don't need gimmicks RAW SPIRITUAL GIFTED I LOVE-LOVE Her Voice 👏👏👏
So good live. Prefer it actually
Chloe my girl since ungodly hour , shining as ever and even more brighter. Love you forever
I wish the album had this arrangement this is my kinda vibe
This is good and there missing a background vocalist and it doesn't seem like it
Please invite FLO next!!!🥰💗
Bigs up to the horn players
I’m so proud of her, I wanted to cry multiple times because she’s come so far. And seeing her as a young black woman making strides in her own way is such a beautiful, inspiring thing to see. I’m excited to see where she’ll be in 10 years. A legend in the making 🤍
Love it amazing artist!!! Hopefully yall can get bonethugs on there soon🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Chloe is BAD bad 🔥🔥🔥!! Enjoyed this so much!! And the semi all girl band? Yaaaas. Loved the vibe ❤
she is too cute! love her.
She is the BEEESSSSTTTT! Chlöe, I Trully am your fan! <3
❤❤❤❤
Got to see her here in Denver Colorado a couple weeks ago, she was phenomenal, and I never use that word❤
It’s refreshing to see such a tight knit and throughly rehearsed set be executed like this, too many performers i feel like are so nonchalant
Thanks for blessing DC with your talent.🎉
🥰🥰🥰
Hopefully Beyince can keep her momentum all they way up to 90 that way chloe doesnt shine meaning chloe be in her mid 60s which is perfect
Ummm hello wheres the rest ??? Ima need part 2
Her vocal transitions are so underrated to me she be going from head to chest voice to wherever she feels so flawlessly. I need y’all to understand she produced these songs so shoutout to her musicians but a special shoutout to the fact that she even created this art for them to emulate (You can tell they had fun doing it too)!
0:02 - Suprise  2:55 - Body Do  5:16 - I Don’t Mind  7:58 - Worried  11:29 - In Pieces  15:52 - Cheatback
Wow. Her studio songs are fire but live?! 🫠
Continue to do you Chloe 🙌🏿 ❤️you have supporters who appreciate your talent and enjoy you as an entertainer. The band is/was amazing 👏🏿💯
❤
BEAUTIFULL!!!
This woman is gorgeeeouuuussss
Pure Talent. Pure Beauty. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow ... is all I can say. Absolutely divine! ♥
Chlöe ❤️🔥
I love everything about chloe
That was wonderful!
She’s beautiful
I see why she scared of Chloe! 😂
Her hair is do well done I forgot she even has locs 🔥🔥❤️❤️ The hair stylist deserves an award for the slayage
boring.
She did this!
I love Chloe❤❤❤❤
People are triggered how she taps into her sensuality and femininity. Makes them uncomfortable because “she’s supposed to wear “child star and perfection forever”.  Not forgetting her individuality and still trying to compare her to her sister. The more they try to box her in she rebels and pushes back. I love this for her. She’s herself and that’s all there is. Not who “they want her to be” It be your own people and the perfect Patties on the internet.🤦🏾‍♀️
That GIRL period true baddies know ❤
perfeito
Flawless singing and her emotion tied to the lyrics is infectious simply raw talent!!
A graduate from the School of Beyonce...I present Chloe mf Bailey. She's so individually amazing. You can tell Beyonce had her and Halle putting in WORK on the backend.
I WISH THIS WOULD HAVE CAME OUT AFTER THE RENAISSANCE TOUR.
You better sannnng Beautiful!! So Proud of All Your Success and Beautiful music stay just the way you are Baby Girl!!! ❤🔥🔥🔥🦋
❤❤❤❤
Hi my name is Chloe ….I was waiting on Halle to introduce herself 😢
Her vocals are insane. This was good but she's just playing having fun on here. She's a vocal BEAST!!!!!
that “do you ever wonder” made me laugh out loud. This girl is so great.
😍❤💯🤎
EDIT: Ok, juste WOW. La présence, la voix, LE RANGE autant vocalement que les beats YO! I swear to God Chloe Bailey is next level. And the way ALL the musicians have fun, ça en dit beaucoup. She is so charismatic and hella talented.   Sorry not sorry, mais l'élève a dépassé le maitre sur un esti de temps. I meannnn it shows that she has Beyonce as a mentor, but she's beyond.   OK BUUUT, Chloe Bailey has been stepping into her powe,r and WOW. 2 minutes in and I'm shook !  euhmm, excuse you Tiny desk team, the lady said, " Say it with me" ...Why I ain't heard nobody say "Pop your body like this"  Chloe is stepping into her power and it is phenomenal!!!
I absolutely love her talent, but the content of her music is weird!
Love her! ❤
No the band OUTDID THEM SELFFFUHHH!!! As they shouldddd❤🎉
chloe definitely give beyonce vibes, she will definitely be on top soon
Love Chloë
Yesssss!
You can tell she’s 💯 genuine. That’s rare now a days.
Chloe I hope you never stop singing performing writing producing dancing all of it is perfect. ❤
Im not understanding how you couldn’t like Chloe. The talent is unreal ! Not to mention she writes her own music. I love her
Love her talent. Will now be looking for a little more depth lyrically. 👌🏾
Really really talented!!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Chloë es una excelente cantante
Love everything bout you Chloe ❤😊
🔥🔥🔥
ok not gonna lie,,,i need an acoustic set from chloe ,,shes definitely a dance girl and we  love and need that but this soooooo good.
😴
Straight slayed!!  These tiny desk be making my day and blowing my mind. I love that it shows the artists raw talent with the band and i couldn't tell it was a background singer missing.❤❤❤❤😊
She did amazing I love it!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
YESSS CHLOEEEEEE !!!!!! ❤️
Omg!! A neo soul version of Surprise, like yes yes and yes!! 😢
Dang, this made me wanna listen to the album!! This is IT!!! 😩
She is absolutely beautiful, she writes, creates and sings with an unreal beautiful vocal range.  Shes amazing.  Her jazzy sounding band is a vibe, also.  I was digging the keyboard player's vibe, and the horn section too.  I wanted hwr to do Have Mercy, also!
Phenomenal Performance,expect nothing less from Ms. Chloé,and the band, did their thing. Love all the ladies in the band too,I  don't see that very often. Thank you again NPR Tiny Desk!❤
I could see this performance 100x and never get tired! New levels of respect for Chloe
❤
A true performer! Loved this!!
🔥🔥🔥Beautiful!!!❤️
People get stuck in certain vibes of music but Chloe is so old-school people were not paying attention. Vocals are impeccable she goes from her head to her diaphragm to the back of her throat, this girl's bad.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I dont mind! When she gets to *what was the reason?*  I hear Cardi
Once beautiful.. always and forever beautiful 🎂❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
rema next rema next!!
Tell me you aren’t truly advised by Beyoncé, w/o telling me…  it’s pretty clear  Sis has pipes 🔥  Who signed off on these arrangements 😮
Chloe is that girl
She needed background singers on Body Do, she doing all parts got her running outta breath and rushing to sing all parts
See I've been sitting around here for a few years waiting for one of these youngins to come on the scene vocally with that "IT FACTOR". Well here she is ladies and gentlemen Ms. Chloë Bailey...  I will admit I was not a fan at all in the beginning when I first heard about her and her sibling. About a few months ago I hear this one song "SUPRISE" loved it and needless to say I just chalked it up in the category of anybody can make me like something about them and continued not paying much attention to this young lady. Well I just happen to be on X and there was a small clip of this performance and I decided to check it out. To say that not only was I "SURPRISED" by her presence and delivery I was actually in awe. Now I come away from this experience as a bonified "CHLOE" fan, how about that!!!!  Out
Come on now Chlöe!!!! 👑👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
To think about Chloe and Halle’s tiny desk 2 years ago and to see her doing her solo tiny desk today is so beautiful. Together or solo these young ladies are thriving doing what they love. So happy to see them growing!
You can’t listen to Chlöe and not move. Like she will make you vibe outtttt!
Sing Chloe!!!!! these arrangements are Chef’s Kiss ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Chloe Bailey In Pieces Albulm is a Diamond Find. She shows us that she shouldnt be placed in a box. Glass Ceiling SHATTERED. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👑
🔥🔥🔥
Our light flows thru the cracks to heal others, to heal this World ❤️
Give this young one her flowers please!
Worried should be big!!! 😭😭 it’s too good
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 as always! & may I add, Not a background singer in sight! YOU GO CHLOE ‼️🖤
That's what's wrong ..she trying to be bigger than life way too fast....like ain't been did 10 plus yrs..like everyone want to be mj way too fast...
ONE THING BOUT MISS CHLÖE, SHE GONE FEED HER FANS
🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾
She favors  BEY so much. CHLOE literally resembles her in so many ways.
So many bnagers !
WHAAATTT??? Omgggg Such a good VIBEEEE
Chloe ateeeeeeee and left no crumbs
Body Do version is fire
she has vocals yeah but her sound and delivery is so beyonce coded. chloe has potential but she needs to find her own sound that is really her. And shes doing too much with her adlibs and runs which is unnecessary for the song.
Queen C. Period
Funky Dineva could NEVA! That’s why he hates her so much cause he doesn’t wish he could
Okay baby 😊
Amazing!!!! I wish she did pray it away and how does it feel tho 💗
Her musicality is INSANEEE. The way the band just grooves and jives in sync with her is fantastic.
I love the all POC band
This woman…
Can’t wait to see you in London on the 21st 🎉🎉🎉🎉
She’s fantastic
Such a strong performer and incredible voice, amazing job Chlöe, can’t wait to see you live
She lost me when she said "Who F ing your man." She had some talent and class up to that point. Her talent doesn't need the contemporary need for such gutter indignity.
Really loved this. Actually wish her album was a live set as she is supremely talented but I way prefer this to the recorded album.
You better sang!
grabs my attention all the way to the end, that's rich... thanks
Welcome me to the fandom y’all. This definitely sold me. She is insanely talented and the album sounds incredible!!!
I love me some Chloe but I wish she  would start over with her sound. I skipped this whole performance 😒
This is a no for me…
Chloe is crazy talented 👏👏👏
Eu amooo ♥️♥️♥️🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Excellent vocals and stamina. Very superb live performance.👏
Ela é filha da Beyoncé. Os fatos
She’s so beautiful and gifted!😍🔥 Love this🥰
She sound like Beyonce a lil bit😮😊
Much love for Chöle ❤
Más talentosa no hay ❤
Her vocals are honestly just unmatched 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Can not deny her talent. This is a vibe. Love this.
Talented she really undoubtedly is...i just wished her management listened to fans about over sexualising her image. Its the fans that make the artist!
❤ ❤❤❤
eventually, people are going to give chlöe the credits, she duly does deserve. this woman talent personified and a force in our generation. a person with a difference, a breath of fresh air. people are going to catch up eventually, they just have to.
I love it when her and her sister sing together. I love their vocals
Loved this! I really like this live version of Surprise.
This is excellent vocally and musically. Wow a whole vibe 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽❤️❤️
Here’s the thing she can actually sing seems like this is becoming more and more rare
It’s her range for me.
I love your work ! I love your mind ! I love your soûl ! I love your songs ! I love you ! ❤❤❤
ONE OF THE BEST TINY DESKS. EVER!!!
I just adore Chloe, I smiled all the way through this. So happy I'm going to see her on tour soon. This is a pre-game treat goodness she's amazing. 🥰
💕🤌🏾 pure talent
Give Chloe her 10s. She ate tf down. Came on Tiny giving greatness.
Go Chloe! This was excellent! She can sing her a$$ off.
Love it sang girl ❤
I’m in love with this lady 😌
Live versions are always better than the  album ❤❤❤
She is fantastic!
The way she runs in her vocals so effortlessly is insane!!! Her voice is like honey and silk 😢❤
Amazing! I wish she gave us Looze U
Definitely need acoustic versions of some of these classics like worried💯
Okkkkk! Vocals are on 20! I can't wait for the lyrics to catch up to what that voice is doing bc it's heaven SENT!
When will be depeche mode's turn?....
Love Chloe❤️She is unapologetically confident and it is infectious. As a black woman, she reminds me that it is okay to be confident and secure with the beauty inside and outside of me! Chloe keep it going, don't stop. Love your music and your voice❤️
11:29 - In Pieces 💔❤‍🩹
The mic is on. But I still dont like when she does that opera thing with her voice. A bit to much
chloe’s always been good and will ALWAYS deliver perfectly. would love to see her live
The instrumentalists bring majority girls 🤌🏾 chefs kiss, Cherry on top of this beautiful performance ❤
CHLOE!!!!!😀😀😀👏👏👏👏!!!!
❤
Breath control is out of this stratosphere! I also like how one of the triplets sounded like a backup singer.
Totally Musical ! great concert ! Lyrics perhaps a little prem' dregree but.. its just my way... im fed up off my day, and its make me care. Thanks again to the artists and the NPR team for the impeccable work. Bravo !
I love how she has her own unique sound but you can definitely hear the influence of Beyonce on her voice and style as well! I love it!
I want music more and more the older I get and I just can’t get enough
chole we love you ☘️🤍
Not nan her peers" even comes close
She’s an amazing live singer ❤🥰🥰  yayyyy Chloe👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾❤️❤️
Kelela next
DOPE!!!!
WHO DID HER MAKE-UP?! they need a raise!
What. A. Talent!!! ✨ Breathtaking, truly! Much love ❤
Her range is crazzzzzyyyyyy 🤯
So beautiful ❤️❤️❤️🫶🏻🫶🏻👑
... terrible choice to greet your NPR audience, {bad taste} not to mention there are kids in the audience
I really wanted have mercy and treat me 😢😭😭😭Chloe you did me dirty gal,but I love your beautiful voice.🔥🔥😊♥️
I really wanted have mercy and treat me 😢😭😭😭Chloe you did me dirty gal,but I love your beautiful voice.🔥🔥😊♥️
She snapped. 🔥
Man! She’s a good and healthy singer! A nice consistent top to bottom sound and the voice maintains it’s character in between registers.
If her next album has this kinda sound. 😮❤
My girl doing her thing❤❤❤I am so proud of her for constantly nailing each performance ❤
She sounds amazing! Can’t wait to see her live later this month! 😍
I feel unbelievably spoilt ive heard it as soon as i have. Better than beyonce and i dont wanna hear anything else
she didn’t have to ate this body do version like that man she’s ridiculously talented 😭
This woman can SAAAAAAAANG.....TRUE VOCAL ABILITY.....WONDERFUL RANGE & RICHNESS ....I LOVE IT! 🌺🌻🌼🌷
I LOVE LOVE LOVE CHLOE !!! I BELIEVE SHE WILL BE THE NEXT SASHA FIERCE !! WATCH AND SEE
CHLOE!!!! 🔥
WHERE IS MAKE IT LOOK EASY
And that’s on Ms Bailey if you nasty🎉🎉🎉
Surprise sound like diddy bop with the live instruments
idk about the surprise cover… i prefer the original one
Wow!
I bet she can eat up a Toni Braxton song
🤣🤣🤣🤣 I fell out when she asked this:   Chloe: do you ever wonder like who else is fuqqin yo man  Audience : 😬😅🫠🙃
The blonde looks good
Baby Bey...
Yesss Chloe girl👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 u did that
This was amazing... very wholesome ❤
My body started doing what it needed to do on Body Do!
Man, Quincy sure knows how to pick ‘em
KYLA WRIGHT HELD IT DOWN ON THAT BASS!!! @thatbassgirlkyla !!
Chloe has the comfort level of a seasoned artist- the way she commands attention and flawlessly delivers.  Her vocal ability, her BREATH CONTROL, is ridiculous!!! She's a true artist, not just a singer, and that's why she can flip a song and change an arrangement at the drop of a dime.  I'm still so impressed with her. I admit that Cheatback wasn't my favorite at first, but this version- LOVE IT!!
She trying do hard😂 to have a relevant music career.. Nah booo you ain't it... But you cute🤷🏽‍♂️
Basic singer and a very mediocre sound.
Chloe is so Talented ❤❤❤
Truly one of the best tiny desk shows!
I want her to go so far, her voice is so nice ❤
Chloe! Yes Darling, you're absolutely amazing ❤❤❤
That first song gave me chills. Love her.
Are these songs from her new album? I don’t understand what’s the issue. The music and her voice is fantastic 🤷🏾‍♀️
stunning performance
GENZ BEYONCE <3
J'ai adoré ! On point. Can't stop dancing ! Such a pleasure to hear her ! Great live !
AMAZING
My absolute favorite 🥰🥰♥️
Now, I see why Beyonce's music sounds like it does now...
Great singing and nice playing! Btw Keep asking Npr, npr music, npr editor, this;  The Big Three Labels control music, does any of these companies sponsor npr, Warner Unversal Sony? Please answer.
This was beautiful!!!!!!
Chloe você é perfeita! Come to Brazil! 🇧🇷 🎉❤
Okay let me go blast her album again
A beautiful voice singing some trash lyrics. Her career is felling because no one wants to be honest. What she is talking about is trash.
impeccable runs 😭
Amazing 👏👏
😍😍😍😍
I don't mind low-key slapped ❤❤❤
Watching the full Video is so  enjoyable! ❤ it's already in my playlist 🥰
🔥🔥🔥🔥😍
She has the cutest laugh
I am sad 😢she didn't do feel me cry. Body do had me shaking in the car 🚗
I didn’t expect it ! Good surprise 🎉
This needed to be 15 min longer, bandmate introductions by name and my missing fave song...😁 it was good though!
Now why does this have me crying? I’m so proud of her.
The fact that absolutely she killed it without the background singers shows how impeccably talented she is! A true artist. Love her!
Yeah, she snapppppped! Such a talented beauty!!!
What you did on Body do?! That was amazing! I love you Chloe! Keep it up! The way you sung every song, it’s so authentic!
This talent?! I’ve never really paid attention to Chloe but I’m one song in and this vocal control??? What?? I’m a convert
She’s a vibe😌🫶✨vocals on point!
She killed it like always
This was incredible. And the guitarists had the right energy okay!
Kyla is killin on bass!
COME ON CHOLEEEEEE!
Go Chloe!
this was fun i like it ❤‍🔥
Love her but some lyrics are questionable 😅😅😅😅
Alright Chloe love it
🗣️SIIIINNNNNNGGGGG🙌🏾🥵✨🤎‼️‼️‼️
With no background vocalists wow what an angel
So under rated. Not die hard but always surprise and locked every time I see her live. Such a unique talent
She serves them up!! Every time !!! 🔥 🔥 always amazing!!
Go Chloe you mf ATE 🍽️🦄💜
In Pieces.......Yessssssss
Chloe is soooo cute
Surprise is my sawng!
Chloe continues to prove how much she loves what she does.  Passion, dedication and pure talent in every note.
So inspiring
Shout out to my girl Brandi Singleton on the drums! Chloe sounds amazing...This was a great set!
Her giggles are so precious omg😂❤
She has such a beautiful voice! I love how connected she is with her music you can really hear the passion she has for it in each note she hits!!!
She sounds really good, musically, vocally good and a phenomenal performer. But i genuinely feel like she needs writers that is if she's the one writing her own music. There's sth missing in terms of the writing aspect. She can really go far, writing for yourself is overrated if you ask me
I pray she releases this as a live album or something because I would listen to this everyday! I love it so much more
Get it girl!
I love this ❤
I love Chloe. This performance was not my favorite set list selection. I wish she would have sung “Feel Me Cry.” I enjoyed the “Worry” performance. She also has great breath control. Perhaps incorporate bg singers. Keep going shorty! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Chloé "got these 45-year-old hips swaying slow 😂⚘️⚘️👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Ahhh! Love You Chloe! 🥹💛
Yeah, Chloe needed that warning 😅
🔥🔥💥💥🥰💋💋  When I get famous I hope they don’t find all my comments 😂
She can give tribute to beyonce. She got the voice and moves.
Miss needs to do an album release of this smooooooth sound her voice was perfectly created to melt that style completely
Cheat back 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Love the band!!! They grooving and the facial expressions and smiles...that's it for me.
Beyoncé must be so proud
🔥🔥🔥 I wanted to hear Feel me cry but I love me some chloe & her album is always on repeat in the tesla!
I'm shocked she didn't do Have Mercy,  Take Em Church or,  Treat me
omg is that, thatbassgirlkyla!!!! yesssssir
She needs a background singers.
She's so pretty and talented. It's hard for me to believe she deals with trifling dudes. I can't really see her singing this type of music. It just doesn't seem "her". If it really is and not just an act, young girls are in trouble 😅
I was like, why does this sound so weird? Because I had another tab open playing at the same time. Carry on, Chlöe
A star.
yes give us the vocals i loved the jazzy arrangements
God given talent and beauty!
Chlöe did that!! Yes boo!! SANG!
Beyonce effect vocals
You can tell she was nervous, shame. I'm looking forward to see her get more comfortable on stage in front of the cameras while flying solo!
Muito braba pqp
Please have Queen Naija next
Her concert was incredible. Top tier dancing and live vocals the entire time. Wonderful performance.
….they way she skipped right over Treat Me. Lol
So talented
I never listened to her music. I don't think I'll start now, but she is very talented. I was curious I guess.
Dear Chlöe, please do an unplugged version of "I Pieces" for your first solo project deserves a second chance. Why ? Because you're a Master in what you do and the rendition of your talent is beautiful to watch. Your Tiny Desk is absolute 🔥🔥
My girl is killing it . She’s just as good in concert. I’m happy she’s getting her shine with this album .  It was so good 😊
Shes lethal
Go head boo!!!! Love your energy ❤
I love this tiny desk so much! I wish she did her cover of Plastic Off the Sofa.
Beautiful voice; great performance ❤
She is awesome there are alot of people who wont do this cause they wont sound good...
So much long awaited spice on Tiny Desk! ❤
Omg I needed this!! This will be played often. Chőle is everything! Her voice is effortless. Her musical director and band did am amazing job.
Chlöe is so gorgeous and her voice is everything. My favorite song on the album is “Worried”. Her talent is undeniable. She seems like such a genuine person. I pray she’ll go on and do even greater things in her career. I’m sending all the love her way. ❤
I love her voice! She is giving me Toni Braxton vibes! But I love the contrast of her and her sis's voices-one light and airy and the other deep and resonant :)
Go head Cam!!!
This is like watching Whitney Houston sing “my neck, my back” Beautiful voice, wrong lyrics 🥴
Her hair, makeup, talent! 😍
She's so good!! Deserves so much more
She soooooo talented and of course beautiful. Really enjoyed this offering NPR, wish it was a bit longer because her vocals are so so goooodttt
i've been obssessed with the chloe x halle tiny desk home concert! it's so nice seeing one of the girls back! in addition to her amazing charisma as a performer, chloe's musicality shines through here and this just me more excited for her next work!
She is such a ray of R&B light. I love her and her sister.
It doesn’t matter the stage, Chloe is going to perform. She’s going to entertain and connect with her audience! Forever a fan here!
Chloe is the IT girl for Gen Z. I hope they'll come to appreciate her talent bc this Millennial sure does🤩
NPR Music, idk how, but imma need this on streaming platforms!😭😭😭
She killed this!! 🔥🔥🔥❤️
As a guitarist for many years, i can say that guitarist is absolutely killing it!
That's how you do it Chloe!!!!!!!!
Y’all can say what y’all want about the music. Idc. One thing you will never be able to deny about Chloe or Halle is the the TALENT. They put in their 10,000 hours to be where they are today. And they’ve only gained popularity as time has progressed. And that is why I will forever be in their corner supporting them.   Listen to the musicality of her voice. Like she’s not afraid to play with her voice and serve different sounds. She can riff and run, staccato, “rap sing”. Like all within one song sometimes. Like no one else besides her sister have that ability in this new generation.
I saw her live was great wasnt a big fan of this Tiny Desk performance unfortunately especially Body Do 😕
TALENT.
The vocals 🔥🔥🔥
THIS IS INCREDIBLEEE
I LOVE U SOOO MUCH CHLÖEEE❤️❤️🥹🥹🥹
Dear Chloe haters! We now know why you're hating. Chloe is the full package! I love her!!!
Keep going never stop Love
Big Chlo!!
I’m just glad it look like the baby got clothes on
LOVE!! ❤🔥
Did they put caravan in Body Do 🔥  !! All the Jazz fans know what it is Ayeeee 🔥
She definitely went to the School of Beyoncé. And I’m not mad at it.
She so fine ❤!! Love her 😍 💕
I love her 😍
Chlöe is so beautiful🥲I could cry
I absolutely love this. I've been watching the NPR with Chloe and Halle in a loop for a while. Now this wiil be my next obsession
Absolute perfection no notes!
Ohhh thanks for the discovery Tiny Desk ! Dope af and great singer. (And the lil' "excited to be here" chuckles inbetween titles are cute af, sweet soul :3)
Chloe is an ARTIST✨love this for her
Talent. Gifted. Undeniable 😍
YEAAAAAAAAAAA
she did her thing on this. undeniable skill and passion will always prevail ♥️
Chloe that was fiyah.  Great work. 💙
I love how the black women looks like proud big sister. ❤😂
TALENT PERSONIFIED ❤😍 so proud of her
❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🥳🥳🥳
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Man locs are so versatile! Such a beautiful voice rooting for my ♋️ sista 💞
Can we get a live version of the album as a re-release?  Please and thank you Ms. Bailey.
Excellent.
I was so hoping she would do Cheatback and she ended with it🔥👏!
Her little giggles❤
Th comment section is nauseating. There is no doubt that Chloe is talented as a singer, but the album as a whole didn't like some people expected. She will not be the first or last artist this happened to (i could name a few)  but the beauty is that she can continue to make music, & hopefully the next album will be received commercially better.  I enjoy this live performance.    I wish the ads didn't mess with the flow of the songs
Yeah Chloe!!! Get it bae!!
I Love her voice!
She sounds like Beyoncé
Her runs are out of this world. I haven't listened to her album but now I look forward to it. I mean when she goes up and down in "I don't mind"?? What a phenomenal vocalist
Ms.chloe your voice have personality
So good Chloe 👏
She's developing beautifully as a young artist. Us non haters love 2c it.
She’s like the new Janet. She had an innocence about her curiosity. That’s what I get from her. Keep going lil sis.
♡
Didn't want this to end😭
Chloe needs to do groovy soca with voice the artist and kes the band
Chloe Bailey... thus young woman can't do no wrong.
I think I found my new Janet Jackson 🥰😍
okie. Goosebumps. Just give her ALL the grammys. ALL of them.
I’m glad they hit her up to do one
The cutest angel ❤️❤️❤️ just like her sis 👭
She is everything!!! That band with all the black and brown faces and Women!!! 😍😍😍😍
Yasssssss ma’ammmmmmmm🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🥰🥰🥰
KILLED THISSSSSS! Wow ❤ Respect ✨🥰
She lives in a world where she acts,  and sings like it's someone elses life. And no content. Just two dimensional stories.
Dam girl!!! I love this sh*t right here! I’m going to be jamming this in my car. I’m a sucker for instrumental live music. Love it!!!! ❤🔥🔥🔥
I really like Chloe and support her but I don’t see the appeal of this sound. She’s truly talented which makes it hard for me. Her and her sister together, magic. Perfection. Gold.
Great job Chloe!!!
Flawless Perfomance.  Amazing!
Shooters every where
Tuis channel is fab lovely family necker island orbtahiti love the jazz vibe
first song sounds like GOT IT GOOD from KAYTRANADA
Yeeees show them gurl!
Pieces, cheat back, worried
This is what being INSANELY TALENTED looks like
Love this energy! Had to show big love in the Attack The Culture 'Videos' section. <3
Simply the best
omg Chloe on tiny desk??!!  Yeesssssss!!!!! <333
this was soo perfect
She is mad talented like veeeery talented and deserves more recognition. Btw I wish halle is next
And just like THAT, I need an entirely Jazz/Acoustic style In Pieces deluxe album, because I’ve never thought in my entire life so far that I’d be throwing it back to a muffed trumpet- yet here I am.
OK Miss Chlöe ATE this up  What a TALENT
Why didn't she perform Feel Me Cry😥. This was very good but I think she could've used background singers. On some songs, it sounds like she was battling the music
Beautiful woman with a stunning God given talent.. She shinessss
The beauty, the talent??? No wonder she makes people so MAD!! Are we hearing the vocals??? I actually prefer her more stripped back like this purely because I love her beautiful voice so much and when she is moving around less she can go all out with her voice!! Of course I love her no matter what she does, she can do no wrong in my eyes!!! So good 🥰❤️
😍
Chloe is a BEAST! 🗣🎤🎶🙌🏾❤️
My favorite song first! 😍
Chlöe was phenomenal but can we talk about the band for a second? Their groove is immaculate!
every word and note hit different with this live band ❤ because why I'm crying on the freaky songs and Fk dude song 😂😂😂  I'm like ok sis sing that sh!t you better cheat back 😂😂🤷🏾‍♀️ we so proud of her  🎉💐🌻
I just love this woman ❤🥲🤧💐🌻 been rocking since beginning 2 small black girls singing church music and there favorite artist music hitting ever note ❤️ 🎶 I hope she go record a live like this it's some about a live band that make the voice hit different ❤
One of my favourite tiny desks of all time❤️❤️
Chlöe, you will forever go down as one of the best vocalist of this generation. I am so proud of you.
I love her voice and her range but I be waiting to hear her and not Beyoncé.
As someone that isn’t her fan due to feeling as if she’s always being extra..THIS!!! THIS IS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING ON!!! Can someone contact her and let her know THIS IS WHAT the people like myself been waiting on…no extra stuff, no body showing…all raw talent like we know she has. I’m tired of the industry sexualizing women that has her kind of talent. She’s beyond beautiful and this whole tiny desk, I was able to enjoy beginning to the end twice!!! (No shade just my honest opinion)
AMAZING!
✨🖤✨
Keep kenya drew marlo kandi
She is so talented, love to see it 😍
a vocal beast!
So good.  Sounds so beautiful live in personal then studio. Her album is really good. Great choice to do tiny desk.  Can’t wait to hear more from her.
Not my particular taste at all but clearly an incredibly talented artist. Bravo
Chloe, we need this whole arrangement as extra numbers on a Deluxe version!!! This live instrumental version is soooo goodttt!!
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHh  SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT This was QUITE REQUIRED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
❤️❤️❤️
Go Chloe!!!!!!!!
She's fire
we need nelly furtado pleaseeeeee, and also invite me to witness
god dang what a beautiful soul shining through that musical talent and what a fantastic virtuous band. ♥️
Yessssssss Chloe pure talent!!! ❤❤❤
girl we need the deluxe w extended heart on my sleeve and physical copies this album is worth too MUCH to be paid dust like this 😭 this performance is incredible, especially i don’t mind. the energy! ❤
I love her so much. She's a feeler and you can hear it in every lyric delivery ❤
diosa!
Can't wait to see in you in London
The way I almost seized trying to click this video seeing it was CHLOE. I fell in LOVE with this album; I felt her lyrics and journey. AND THEN THIS VERSION! Vocals down and the arrangement! I just wish she did Looze U 😭
I don’t think I have seen so many smiles amongst the musicians ever, just saying🎉
Chloe is so talented.. What an amazing artist
this girlllllll, i love her!
Worried is my fav off the album
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Never have I been more captivated by the tiny desk❤❤❤
A TRUE Singer!!!!! so pretty too!!!!
Beyoncé is the best manager/coach you can see the influence 🔥🔥
Love me some Chloe
My lil Chloe is grown up!!! She needs to do an acoustic unplugged version of the entire album.
Alguien más piensa que la sonorización no cambio? Antes era mejor.
This was a great performance it's in my top 10 of Tiny Desk this is one I can watch over and over again. This was a whole moood❤
Yasssss
Plz get JoJo and Yebba on here
I HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S UP NOW, SHE IS NATURALLY TALENTED, A MUSICAL VIBE AND THREAT🥰
Her energy is so adorable and she’s so wildly talented just lovely to watch
❤❤❤❤ had to comment again!!! One of the best vocals on this platform!!! SINGING: I DONT MIIIIND!!! 🎉
Love this performance! ❤ her voice 😢❤❤❤
In awe of her!!! Making this energy work in the npr office of all places
She is real great. its me or she sounds like Beyonce on first sight?
Yes about just the artistry. Amazing! I am excited for this moment.
do you ever wonder like...?
shes really that b
she really have that beyonce energy
WE LOVE YOU CHLOE!!!!!!!!
Only Chloë Bailey will have me watching a npr tiny desk and not just the clips
The way she sang that last track was INSANITY!!!!!!!! ❤
Chloe being a producer, a songwriter, a musician, having such a great range, she doesn't deserve the hate she gets. So talented & I love her album. ❤
I'm glad she performed Surprise too, it's my favorite single she released so far and I'm still sad it wasn't included in In Pieces. For The Night and Have Mercy should have been in the album as well, I wonder why she scrapped them because they're so good 😭❤️
Like I always Say Wake them tf up Chloe they always sleeping on you but they don't know how deadly those vocals are
She has such a beautiful voice, those vocals give me chills! I love Chloe, to receive all that hate just for being yourself and keep going, releasing music and showing your talent isn't easy but she did THAT ❤️
In pieces Reminds me of Fiona Apple's Criminal. Excellent excellent the best tiny desk to performance is so far
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 yes girl
You're gonna be the biggest Chloe ! Let them sleep !! You haven't even evolved all the way !
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Chole let’s go!!!❤️❤️
*CHLÖE GIVES ME MEGAN THEE STALLION VIBES! 👩🏽‍🤝‍👩🏾 I LOVE THAT THEY'RE COOL!!*
I always felt that she has so much talent and for whatever reason, she hasn’t unlocked her full potential just yet. It’s actually quite bizarre. She’s sweet n kind at heart but has an edgy personality at times that seems to confuse her audience. I think her music is also reflective of this too. I think once she’s in a better place, she will do amazing things in her career.
What a performer!!! 🤩 can’t imagine how epic will be a concert with her and Beyonce!
I wish Tibet desk would feature Yahzarah!  She is phenomenal but overlook for no reason. I live Chloe but Yahzarah was doing this and still doing it and more!
Yeah this is dope, top tier setlist and execution. The transition between those tracks was so smooth, and the band is so tight!! (shoutout Derek Dixie) Chlöe's musicality just ties it all together, she's such a great voice in R&B
oh she ate that!!!
omg. that band?????? smooth.
Talented talented   She is such a great singer.
I love Chlöe sm😭. Her voice and performances are amazing ❤❤
The production was absolutely impeccable 👌🏾Chlo Chlo is just 😍🤩🎉
Que brillante espectaculo como si estuviera en esenario y los tiene enfocados en sus letras como seguir disfrutando cada palabra de sale de boca que gran momento los dedica ... grasias 😊💙😍
Loved it but girl how do you not sing feel me cry 😢😢😢😂😂😂
🔥🔥💯💯❤️ I love this artist
Every body knows she’s talented nd beautiful the problem is her connectivity with her fans that’s why her album sales are low
Chloe is an AMAZING talent!
Best tiny desk I've seen in years! ❤
Another Tiny Desk hit 🔥 🔥 🔥
I’ve been waiting for this!!!
She ate I love her and she and her sister are so talented ❤🎶🎵
Oh she killeddddd this omg
Now if her music had this sound!!!! I would listen! I enjoyed this tiny desk performance, all the musicians seemed to enjoy this as well! This was artistry!!
🎉✨𝐆𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭 🎶𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐭✨🎉
⭐️
the young lady on the keys is the same one from the tiny desk Chloe x Halle did right?     anyways!!! my girl makes me so proud 🥲💕
Wow❤
Absolutely delightful ❤
yesssssssssssssss
magkasama bilang isa
👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾❤️
I literally get chills. She’s mesmerizing. She leaves me in awe. My mouth drops…
People just love to hate her💗💗💗. In Pieces is a very good album. 💗💗💗. People hate on her for no reason at all. She can sing and dance. Her vocal range is crazy 💗💗💗. But people sleep on her and turn around and say there is no good music💗💗💗
Wooow 😍
Never heard any of her music before this, but she has a pretty voice. I have loved R&B since I was a little kid and she has a voice that makes me fall in love. I'll be listening to more of her work. It's not really traditional R&B but her voice is just so pretty. She seems like a genuine person with a beautiful soul.
Chloe killed this it's dope seeing singers who are actually vocally gifted Like this.
This was so good!!!
Babyyyy Chloe is that girl idcidcc 🫶🏾🫶🏾🤍
Can she do broadway!!!! Her song performed in broadway even would be killer
There is a reason that Queen B didn’t push her when she signed her…because she’s beautiful and talented and YOUNG! Let’s face it people… Queen B won’t be on top forever and she’s no spring chicken anymore. I like Chloe…people need to stop hating on her…and Halle. The girls are both talented!
FINALLY!!! 😊
My wife ❤
What a change ❤
She sounds incredible. These arrangements were outstanding. I wish she performed Feel Me Cry!! We need a part 2 and a live album!!
Chloe!! rooting for you always 🤞🏾🤞🏾
She was holding back and still ate.
❤️💖❤️💖❤️💖❤️
Not 1 backround singer.... 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👌🏾
The talent. Periodddddd
Yayyy! First ChloexHalle, now Chloe, so now we just need Halle!!!
💗💗🌸
Amazing absolutly amazing😢🎉
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎
Loved this chöle ❤
Hey all it is my hope on this day that you would believe and put your faith in Jesus Christ. How wonderful and marvelous it is to know and believe that you could be in relationship with the God who has created the heavens and the earth. When you think about all the hurtful sinful deeds you’ve done in your life you must know that sin requires blood payment for forgiveness before a Holy God. That same God saw that we could not maintain the consequences for our sin and sent his son Jesus Christ into the world as God in the flesh to be the living sacrifice and payment for the sins of the world. If you put your faith in Jesus you will be saved. IMMEDIATELY. YOU CAN KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO HEAVEN WHEN YOU DIE. Death on earth is non negotiable put your faith in something and someone greater than yourself today, because we can’t save ourselves from the judgment of our maker.
Oh my god I love In Pieces from the album, but this live version is just incredible!!!!!
Go awf Chloe!!
Speechless 🔥
I had a whole ball watching this!!  Yes Chloe!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I’m still not over the Chloe x Halle tiny desk, but 😭 Chloe!!! Ugh gorgeous girl with a gorgeous voice. Both of them are so insanely talented.
Chloe I actually actually wanna see you! YOU!!
Wow! This was excellent! Like it or not, the girl is talented period! 🎉❤🎉
Beautifully done!
GO MISS CHLOE! WE LUV UUU
I’m Confused on y she hasn’t put out Body do or I don’t mind because those are her hits with the right promo and video she can keep this album going and what happen to the deluxe ?
Omg she did it on here birthday
Chloe did a beautiful job.I love her voice and creativity
The second verse of body do is why it should have been a single
One thing my Chloe gonna do is SANG AND PERFORMn with her voice! The vocals are ALWAYS gonna be vocaling! I neededddd this! So proud of her since I started watching her and Halle back on the YT daysss
Chloe is so authentic and beautiful!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
So amazing
These men deserve to have someone treat them like they treat us lol
Te amo
one of my fav performance of her like WOW
Surprise should have been a HIT; this vibe is EVERYTHING‼️👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
It's the fact that this is LIVE.... that's exactly why they hate on this young woman. She is undeniable and they stay mad.
Eu amei 🇧🇷🇧🇷💓
Beautiful body of work Chloé  love the energy you've created in hmyour sound. Love you girly
Love Chloe bailey
🤎🤎🤎
Nice songs but they all sound like Beyoncé wrote them. You can tell she is heavily inspired by Beyonce and I guess there’s nothing wrong with that… 🥴🤷🏽‍♀️
In loveee omggg
Yesssss Chloe !!! She serves vocals every time !!!
I love the details, peep the books stacked under her mic 10:38
This is so so good!!!
The talent is undeniable and the personality is cringey but that’s our Chloe and we goin stick by her
Queen B vibes ✨️ 😌
My baby is on Tiny Desk, y’all. I’m in love 🥹🥹🥹🥹
She’s amazing at everything 🫡🥹
this is absolutely fantastic, she never disappoints. i wish she would've performed 'feel me cry' as well! such a standout from the record imo
KEEP SHINING QUEEN‼️‼️♋️
AMAZING
She sounds amazing! Whether you love her or hate her, you can't knock her talent! She commands the stage, has crazy vocal control and range, and writes her own songs.  She also is a good dancer and actress!  This set gave me Jill Scott energy.  Wonderful !
Not a note outta place!
Good job, Chloe!
superior periodt
Vocals & playing on point! 🔥
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍
In Pieces (the track) be pulling at my heart strings 🥹
She’s showing them she’s CHLÖE not nobody else
Chloe has so much pain in her voice. While Haille seems to have healing in hers. I absolutely adore them both by the way. ❤
Loved this!!!
Ahhh OMG Chole has the most ANGELIC voice!!!! I love her!!!🔥🔥🔥♥️
✊🏾❤️🎼🗣🎤
Worried is the song for you haters and you still don't get she not worried about what you think
I love every single song! It’s her vulnerability for me ❤
My fav song 5:48 ❤
Chloe range is amazing!❤
She is so talented and beautiful! The hate she receives is baffling because she is out here killing it. I’m not a fan of the album because the songs don’t speak to me but I’m a huge CxH so I still bought it. Keep shining Chloe… you’re a star!
My girl ❤
Seems like just about every video with a black woman or man, has advisory? Why is this?
Im loving this wardrobe 😊😊
Sounding more like Beyoncé
So angelic!! Chloe is top notch! They way she performed “Cheatback”! 👌🏾👌🏾👏🏾👏🏾🔥🔥🖤🖤👑👑
Idk what’s going on this was good it’s good to see her again but this was not her best vocally and I was so disappointed when she sang cheat back she went into her falsetto versus opening up and singing the high part and I heard it in her voice she was soooo close idk if she’s going through something vocally but it definitely seems like a disconnect on her higher end she’s either low chest or falsetto
She did amazing! I think this is my favorite performance from her. I like this version of the songs even more than the original.
Yessssssss Ms.Chloeeeeee 🌹🔥🔥💰
She is so sensational. Gorgeous and talented, wow.
So so proud of you Chlöe!! Keep shining sis 🦋👑💐
zzzzzzzz.....
she’s so amazing! you can tell she really puts her heart and soul into her art and that alone will take her very far in this industry 💓
Super nice.   Nice to see her band enjoy themselves.
VOICE IS SO PURE AND PERFECT ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I absolutely prefer this over the studio version. The album didn’t do her justice at all.. I’d much rather hear it this way. She’s amazing 🤍🤍🤍
Beyoncé runs👀👀👀
Chloe is such an amazing talent. I wish her nothing but the best for her career(s). 🎶🎥
yeah imma need these arrangements for streaminggg
Chole is very talented.  She is so versatile vocally and she has good range... these songs are beneath her.  Hello Babyface please write Chole some songs. Chole needs some iconic songs that will played 20 years from now. Thank you, Babyface.  😊
My ears were moisturized properly. This girl sang the house down. Yassssssss baby.
I really hate that I grew up on Destiney's Child and Beyonce because unfortunately that is all i hear in her style. It is like a Beyonce curse and its not fair because Chloe sounds so goooooood, her technique and her execution are effortless and smart. I  just want to appreciate her as an artist and it is so difficult for me, personally.
Astounding 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I'm 5 seconds in and I already know it's going to be 🔥 She's a beast.
Aww this was so good! Wish she did Feel Me Cry
Beats really matter because I did not like a lot of these songs before I heard it this way
come on! 😍 it's like she can do anything with her voice 👑❤️
I love her nervous giggles 🥰
Beautiful and talented!
I want the vibe of that bass player when I grow up! 👌
I love that we can see how happy she is singing what she wants to sing and not what everyone wants to hear from her. The joy she has is palpable and I hope she keeps doing what's making her happy 🩷
Listen, Chloe's "In Pieces" album is so good! I thoroughly enjoyed this TinyDesk performance too! Salute to the band- they sound incredible too!
you guys should get abby holliday on this
This the type of album Chloe should record. It wont get airplay though.
Chloe is such a performance-based artist. Amazing
Loving this❤
Omg I’ve been waiting for this!!! OBSESSED!
❤❤❤❤❤ yes Chloe, they would soon understand 🔥
I wanted her to perform Pray it away!
Sounds good. But I can’t help but wonder where are the back up singers at? I feel like there is harmony missing from the show. I feel like it would have elevated it
I need her to use her mixed belt more because this going to falsetto takes away from the song 😅
Chloe!!! 🎉🎉❤
Wow.... ❤
She’s ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS WITH THE FACES AND EVERYTHINGGGG. Now Mz. Bailey KNOWS SHE IS THIS & THAT‼️ Why y’all trying to play with her top 😂
YES CHLÖE!! I’m so proud of this girl
YOU BETTER GO GIRL!!!!!🫶🏾🩷🫶🏾🩷🫶🏾
Sang Chloe!!!!
I was feeling so sad today but this really made me smile
Wow. This is phenomenal ❤
Cheated back is another fav!
This was dope! Well done. 🔥
Idc what anyone says she felt every single ome of the lyrics she sung
Go girl……wow….beautiful
fabulous! I love how she constantly put us into her vibe. can't wait till seeing her and Hale singing 2gether again
Love
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I enjoyed every minute of this! ❤
Cheat back reminds me of “to the left”
Chloe is the nicest sweetest girl I might have to knock you all upside the head hating on her 😂 I got your back sis lets get to 1 million views tonight and trending
💕💕💕
I hope Chlöe always knows how talented and amazing she is and as she continues to grow she’s only going to get better 💜
Talent is undeniable!
Great to see Chlöe here. I would also looove to see Rigoberta Bandini. 🤗🤗🤗
Lets goooo Chlöe. The R&B future is in good hands
Chloe. Remember you are that girl❤💯
Chloe is meant to shine, hope she can tune out the negativity because I really want her to win. I don’t even know who needed a reminder that this woman has the chops, but you got it!
One of THEE Best performances from tiny desk EVER!!!!
She deserves more recognition. So much talent and charisma.

Please release on streaming
Yeah , she’s a cancerian.♋️♋️♋️♋️
Vocals!! Nuff said
Nobody here to read your negative thoughts why your life not doing well. Stay positive with your vibes and you will have better luck in life. For all the people that think we need to read there bad feelings. Watching a woman sing you don't like you got issues. 😂
She seems like a sweetheart!
Now I’m even more excited to see her live this Sunday 😭
She channeled her Jill Scott on this one 🙌🏾
What a TALENT! Put some respect on Chloë !!!
Sorry but this album is FULL OF BOPS ❤
Chlöe: "I wrote this because a neega was playing games." Lady in audience: "That's alright!"  LOL!!!!
I somehow listen better when she has clothes on. Period. We don't need to see all that to appreciate a good voice.
I've been waiting for this for so long
She basically had a dance and singing party for one ❤😂 in a crowded room. Vibes.
I wish she had back up singers
I’m mad! I wanted to here feel me cry and make it look easy. 😑
This was so good! I like the album even more now 🥰
chlöe 🥹
She’s so stunning, what an excellent performer
Yes 🙌🏽 sis! Let all watch u shine 🎉
Incrível 💕✨
My God. Kyla Wright on bass!
WOW

Ooooooooh sooooo excited to watch this
Chloe on Tiny Desk?! What a nice surprise. Loved it ❤.
Amazing Chloe!
Beauty meet talent equals amazing musician, I pray she do well and go far with her music career.
Omg she is so cute ❤!!
Two background vocalists were scheduled to be there but one of their flights was delayed so they decided to have no background singers.
This girl is exceptionally talented
Chloe did that!!!!! Wow what an amazing voice!!!
Finally 😌
Jesus died and rose again for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!
Cloe ate this down!!!! Love her
loved it 💃🏿💃🏿💃🏿🕴🕴🕴🕴
Sang ❤
beauty, brains, vocals...who wouldn't be envious?
Excellent!!!!
Marry me!
Turned up Cheat Back all passive aggressive
This is legit the BEST tiny desk concert I’ve seen since Anderson paak!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥 GO TF OFF CHLO!!
She makes it look so easy mic is always on
This is just what I needed after a long day at work ❤
Amazingggggg job Chloe!!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Amazingggggg job Chloe!!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰
body do was a vibe! that transition into i don’t mind 🔥
Chlöe you're the face of perfection.  How can someone want to bring a lady like this down? She has EVERYTHING to be one of the few names on people's mouths but they just don't let her come true. The best part of this is that your spirit lifts you higher than any stepback and I love how you always comeback stronger. You're an angel girl. 💚🔥🙌
The 2:24 note was garbage… it’s disappointing
Amazing!
W O W this is a AWESOME Tiny Desk segment. Have to say never heard of Chloe before, love the Tiny Desk concerts and took a chance when this came up on my YouTube feed.  Have to say this is one talented woman and she now has another fan for life. Give it up for the Sensational Chloe!!!!
Go Chloe….she is so cold, just raw talent! I’m so proud of her…❤❤❤
She's like....the best of the Best! Her and Halle
One of the best tiny desks ever
She wud be great if she was herself n not trying so hard especially trying to imitate beyonce
I love Chloe 🥰. Great job Queen 🙌🏽
That was So Good!
Decent set with smooth transitions. Great band. She is a force, cant wait until the person catches up with the potential to produce the content that will take her up a level. Right now she is super raw and can get an audience without question. Once some more life experience and resolution is experienced, that rawness will level out and the next level of doors will open for her to elevate not just commercially, but creatively as well. Keep going Chloe!
This was absolutely beautiful! Her band is 🔥
🎼🎼👌👌💎💎
Wow she sound gooooooodt
Body do 🔥🔥
Oh niece is finding herself musically. Its beautiful to see her growth.
Very professional ! I love when she goes into her head voice so smooth. Especially the intro ad lib high note in the first song
Not at all surprised that this was 🔥. The Chloe x Halle Tiny Desk is one of my absolute favorites!
I love Chloe so much ❤💕
I need this in album form on ITunes. I love how she just vibing out!
this BAAAAAAND!! Chlöe is a leggggend
SING CHLOE!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m super glad you included the musicians in the description  I’m often finding new talent  The bass player Kyla is special I need to see what else she has worked on
Wow she has so much fun and it brings a smile to my face ., when u have fun others do too and she is the perfect example of this
Faltou a melhor de todas. Cadê  Have Mercy?
I love her so talented. Congratulations you deserve everything that's coming your way.🎉
❤❤❤
I like this style better!!🙌🏾
We have to remember this is how her and sister stated in music.  Acoustic covers. This will always feel natural more than anything. I love this ❤❤❤
Yes Chloe!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The musicality was everything, it was so good. I wish she done. Feel my Cry and Loose You only because their town my favorites. It was incredible!!!! And we got more then three songs!!! 🔥❤️🥰
She’s so bright and bubbly and can sang!!!
Respect to miss bass player wow  smooth lines !!
Go Chlo!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nice one Chloe....can't wait to see her live in a couple of weeks time....
I just want her to singgggg!!!! She’s so talented! She doesn’t need the gimmicks or the extra just her and her voice. She’s going to go so far❤.
Watching her growth is amazing. I love watching her evolve as an artist.
I really wish that Chloe would be vulnerable and let us in. I still feel like she’s not truly being herself & the mask is still on. Idk how to explain it. She’s so talented and I just hope that one day she realizes that she is enough.
I just love her music she definitely makes music that in 5 years people will finally see the vision
Her songs live be better than the recorded versions. Its great....
Aye!
Saw this on my page and almost screamed. Always good to see Chloe doing ha thing!!
❤❤❤❤❤🕺🎶🕺🎶 loooooooooooove congratulations 🎉🍾
YAAAASSSS
Period, Chloe!
Chlöe did my two of my faves from her debut album,  "I Don't Mind" and "Worried" ❤
😍😍😍😍😍
🎉🎉🎉🎉
I don’t like this at all
❤
In Pieces is one of my favorite releases of the year, she bodied this live.
I applaud Chloe for ignoring the noise and moving forward.
Honest opinion. Her voice is amazinggg, but her songs do not do her voice justice.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What a voice, what a personality ; wow, what a cutie!😀
Yaaassssssss
Ok, Chloe!👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyaaaaaasssssssss sing chile
She's so cute! I love this ❤
That's so cool :D
Sis with the trumpet is having a ball I'm her sksksksksksksksksks
She's talented but the Beyonce influence is too much.
If Prince was still alive I’m sure he could help her reach epic hierarchy
She filled the room ❤❤❤❤ amazing
probably my least favorite tiny desk
I’m here for “Body Do” ✨
Beautiful vocals, delivery and storytelling 🤎
CHLOE TE AMO
The production with a live band totally adds something she’s missing. More of this!!
Fantastic band, musicians are terrific, she's great, her singing /voice range is impressive and she seems really sweet. Love and respect to all.💝
Proud of you Chloe🎉!!! Mad skills total control!!!!!
Yessssss Chloe sing 🎤😭❤️
This is legit surreal. Like……Do y’all HEAR her??? It. Is. Not. Easy ….nor common…. to deliver vocals like this. For almost 20 minutes straight…ACTUAL wow.
girl is queen bey's successor ong
love this! great musicians and she has a great voice and vocal style, very unique.I could listen to this all day.
the haters can hate all they want, cause at the end of the day, this woman is INSANELY talented & not that she needs her, but has BEYONCE in her corner. you can't stop her!!
❤❤❤❤ she amazingly talented
what a lovely time <3
I'm impressed. So much talent.  Vocals just like Beyonce but knows how to rap like a G. The girls is a star.
Loved this! I just wish she did Feel Me Cry 😭
I missed her Toronto show yesterday, I’m actually 😢
Love! ❤❤❤
Darn it accidentally bumped off the ongoing live feed . Wonderful concert, thank you, tiny desk and Chloe And all the beautiful artists Bless your Hearts Always❣️❣️❣️
Listen at .75 it’s chefs kiss. Full immersion
This is a 🌟 STAR. Her voice makes you feel! You can reel she works in her craft and she is meant for this! And so down to earth too! Go beautiful young woman GO!!!
I could hear the lyrics clearer and I like the songs better 👌🏾
Sensational
Ayyye Chloe did that!! ❤and she is very BEAUTIFUL!
WOOOOOOWZA!! NPR YOU KILLED IT WITH THIS. CHLÖE IS AMAZING 😍
So beautiful! Love you Chlöe! ❤❤❤
Killed it with Halle and came back and killed it again
Yes, Chlöe eat it up!
That was flawless
Just beautiful.  Love her voice!!!!
As people have said she sounds good, talented but the songs are not clicking.
OMGGGG IM SO PROUD OF CHLOE
She can easily make a rap song the way she was flowing on body do
always will support chloeee
Great job Chloe.
You are an amazing performer
I see her live in tour tomorrow I cannot wait YOU BETTER SANG CHLOE!!!
I'm waaaaaay too excited rn!!! I wanna watch but gotta wait till I get to my headphones. Love me some Chloe!!!
I so love that she's thriving!
❤
I forgot what she looked like with clothes on
já esta entre minhas apresentações favoritas do tiny desc, brasil te ama chloe <3
She has fallen so far and it's truly sad to see.
Chöle is so talented 🥹💕
She needs one hit song!! Something is just not clicking for me with her,but she is talented!
i love you forever
OH YEAH SHE DID EVERYTHING, SHE MADE GREAT CHOICES 🔥🔥🤣
She said fuq background singers! Most gangsta!
She ate this whole THANG up
Her voice is so powerful!!! Love this for her!!!! 🎉
YESS! I think what's so good about this NPR is that it has to me personally what her album lacks....we get to hear hear her solo beautiful vocal ability without the overproduction of techno and beats. It feels like an intimate and beautiful experience. While I do like the album, this arrangement just feels so personal and distinctly Chloe!
See, now THIS fits her. All the other extra things she doesn't even need. Hard to find anything wrong with this performance. The "rap/over sexualizing" persona doesn't fit because the music itself is so genuine. The performance of the music needs a different format. Hopefully, this format continues... I really love it. Great job, Chloe!
Chlöeeeeeeeeeeeeee ate TF down!!!!!! Now I need this as a playlist on Apple! I love the live Chlöe! No bgvs just pure talent!!!!!!
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I was waiting for Feel Me Cry. Best track. A hit if promoted as well as Worried. I think these two songs will make her bigger and reach more audience.
You are beautiful not despite being broken, but because you are broken.
That's my girllllllllllllllllllll
These live arrangements and ad libs elevate the songs so much. Plus she just has a natural stage presence. Bravo Chloe🌟🌟
This will be the standard she will forever be judged by. Great job!
I love your voice so much Chloe!❤
I want this live sound from Chloe on albums! Not just what is a trend, she has so much potential especially that sound in “body do” love this!
❤❤Love
MS BAILEY IF YOU NASTYYYYYYY
she's so mesmerizing and talented! Chlöe, so freaking proud of you. Your music is absolutley phenomenal!!
The people need an acoustic version of BODY DO!!
❤❤❤❤❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Despite all the hate she recieves, I absolutely adore Chloe. She's an insane talent! I didn't really enjoy her album, but she ate this tiny desk up! I will always support her.
True Talent, our American sweetheart in real time💯
It is just so insane to think that she is standing here, BEAMING raw talent, and meanwhile the earth-shattering vocals coming from the huge DISNEY blockbuster right now… oh yeah that’s her sister. HER SISTER. Unbelievable. Once in a lifetime.
Go ahead Chloe!!! You betta sing and just perform. So incredible and talented. 🔥❤️❤️❤️
Lets gooooooo! Chloe a beast! 🙌🏾⚡️🖤⚡️
❤️❤️❤️ LOVE this performance!! I agree with a lot of the comments about the songs being better than the the studio version. I hope her next EP or album is more like this🔥🔥🔥
her little giggles are so cute
❤❤❤ omg love her !! Great job mama !!
The talent
Beautiful voice.
Yassssssssssss been waiting for this 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Chloe is amazing!! So much talent!! She can sing and act!! Love her. Beautiful and talented!!!
Yessss Chloe does it everytime... I love her entire album😍🔥 she should def have more recognition😭❤️
If she ever want a normal man, “I DONT MINDDD” 😩🤣 both her and her sister got it going on
She is a FORCE!!! THE MIC IS ON and the girls have a hard time keeping up. Bey knows what she is doing by letting her grow organically.
Omg Chloe is such a sweetie and so genuine ❤❤❤
The live music is everything 🎉🎉🎉
You all do know she is musically inclined she probably arranged this whole set. But yall forget she plays instruments for some reason want to compare her to Bey but Bey don't play instruments though...
Beautiful ❤❤❤
Yasssss 😩😍
so brilliant 😢
She is it!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm not too fond of the new girls but Chloe is so talented! Full package! I wish people would leave her alone with the negativity.
OMG! LOVE IT!
Sis on the trumpet has been boppin to the songs and I’m here for it ❤❤🎉🎉
Just not a fan.
Yes Chloe!!! Keep showing your beautiful self, you are so talented!!!! Can’t wait to see what’s in store 🎉
The breath control! My god!
Chloe Chloe Chloe, your gift is an absolute blessing. You are light and love and have no limits. To watch you perform and evolve is a privilege. Well done!
Good Job! 😭
The mic is on FULL BLAST 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i love her and her sister's tiny desks.
Girl can sing
Wow.
Oh i am on the floor.
I feel like all these comments are bots. She is good but not like her sister. She's like a discount store beyonce. She's beautiful and talented but please stop 😆
She killed this 😭😭😭🖤🖤👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Love Chloe! She is so misunderstood, and is so talented!
Wow I didn’t know that she had this power voice wow 💯😍✨
Sheiiiittttt!!! ❤
I think I'm more hype to see Derrick. But she sounds good. I definitely hear the growth. ❤
How people dare to say these songs aren't good, that she's "trying too much". Are you even listening to the same thing as me?
Love Chloe always feel her music and represent it❤❤❤
I came here with a former Stan's attitude. I wonder if this will do anything for her career--sales in particular.   Nice things: I still like "Body Do". That'd be a good track for Halle. I like the shot of the brass section bouncing to the beat at 4:10. Yaaaas. 🎺 Eat at 4:10. Yaaaas. 🎺 That track sounds the least like "Empire" music to me.
I love her diction so much 😭😭
Can we take a moment to appreciate Kyla Wright on the bass. Those licks were TASTY
THE BAND UNDERSTOOD THE ASSIGNMENT >>>> 😘🤌🏾
flop
🔥🔥 love her!
bro this generation of singers really needed someone who is actually GOOD GOOD at singing live. The way she just not only sing but produce and is an amazing dancer is crazy
I like Rap/Hip-Hop/R&B so much more with real instrumentation.  This is the first time I'm hearing of this performer, but she made a great first impression!
chlöe ATEEEEE 😍😍😍
❤❤❤❤❤
Such a beautiful voice ❤😂❤
FLAWLESS!!
4+4=
I was not really a fan of her music until this!! I mean I knew she was talented but the rawness of this truly puts her musical gifts on its well deserved platform!
that voice is undeniable. and the arrangement!!? yea you ate this up!
the breath control its just INSANE like whaaatttttt
Only two favorite songs  from this set lists are in pieces and cheatback. She did outstanding. I wish she would did Have Mercy instead of Surprise.
Chloe great job baby
That chest voice is top tier 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Beyoncé hypersexualizes herself : 😍😋❤🥵  Nicki minaj hypersexualizes herself : 😍😋❤🥵  Cardi b hypersexualizes herself : 😍😋❤🥵  Rihanna hypersexualizes herself : 😍😋❤🥵  Chlöe hypersexualizes herself : 🤬😠😡💀
Whoever added the two ads in the middle of Chloe’ s performance count your days🤬🤬 I’m praying on your downfall
SING CHLOE
Thank you Chlöe, cause babyyyyyy this gonna be on repeat for months 🤭😌
omggg im screaaaminnnnng
<3
LETS GOOOO CHLOEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Chloe …. 🩵 my my my
Goosebumps!! 🎉you Better SANG!
That’s how you do it, Chlöe!!!  SHINE BABY! 👑✨
She is amazing and so underrated 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
yesss CHLÖE such a freaking star!
I feel like more intimate shows like this is her vibe...instead of dancers and all that jazz!
she deserves so much better
Yaaass Chloe! This was a masterful performance! ✨✨
I think Chloe’s debut album sets her up so well, she performs the songs so well too! I feel like her album will get more love as her career grows 😊
She deserves all the success in the world and so does her sister😭😭😭❤️
Every song fire!!
Live album pls I’m begging
The best tiny desk ever
Bass🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wepa, She is FUEGO!!!!
That girl is a POWERHOUSE, talent at its finest. She can sing and dance how she wants.
These musicians are FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
Sooo good! I wish I could’ve seen her live 🤦🏾‍♀️.
The sound of that bass drum together with the bass is just perfect ♡ × ∞
This was GREAT!
OMG I DID NOT SEE THIS COMING!! I LOVE CHLOE <3
WOW! I’m speechless! 😩💕 CHLOE IS THAT B**** 💅🏾……ok!!
Chloe got it! She aint have to go off like this! Wow!!! 😍😍😍
I used to be a fan now im a whole Air Conditioner she is cold 🥶
The voice is undeniable.
She ate down. I love her ❤
CHEATBACK HAS ME SCREAAAMING
Body Do produced by Me & 2300🔥, Live band went crazy!!
Why does she make sound effects with her voice live but not on recorded versions? It’s giving Jessie j
Oh this is 🔥
She did a great job! I wish she wore a different outfit. It was nice to hear her voice in its entirety. I love her range. Im not a fan of the oversexualization of her brand but she is extremely talented.
As usual with a Tiny Desk, I've never heard of this artist before but really enjoyed this. _Worried_ stands out for me and this version sounds way nicer than the heavily computerised studio version I went and found afterwards.
HERMOSA!!!
AUGGGHH. You know an artist is GOOD when you see they have a tiny desk concert posted and you get butterflies of excitement, even though you’re seeing them live in a few weeks 😍🎶 This rendition of Surprise 0:22 giving that neo soul vibe Chloe is a natural at, love! The transition into Body Do 2:53 😱🔥 5:12 I Don’t Mind. Look…Chloe is a problem!! 7:51 Worried 11:22 In Pieces ❤❤❤ 15:55 Cheatback What a beautiful set. Thank you for sharing your art with us, Chlo ✨
this is amazing
beautiful and talented. this was great!!
YES CHLÖE! I feel like a proud Tete! 🥲
Wow! Speechless...
Didn’t know a single song. But really enjoyed it
Love it love it love it looovvveeee iiitttttttt😍❤️😍🥵🤗
She sings with so much musical intelligence at just 25, and I love the different vibes brought into this.. so real, so home-feel yet stunningly beautiful. You better sing Chlöe 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭💃💃
I couldn't see Chlöe last night in Toronto😓 so this is a SHO'NUFF BLESSING!!! 😀🙌🏾🙏🏾
I'm so proud of you chloe. You are incredible! ❤
OMGGG MY WIFEEEE###
❤💫💫💫
Sounds like she mixed “there’s goes my baby” in surprise.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
5:44 that afrobeat!!!!!
Wow wow wow!!! Just wow 🎤
i wish she released music with this type of production/acoustic feel because this was amazing! and i hate cheat back lol but she ate this version up
Chloe you LOOK good, SOUND good, just all around GOOD at your craft. So proud of you beautiful ❤
INSANE omg
WE LOVE YOU CHLOE
Surprise is such an underrated song. It’s such a gem!
Love these tiny desk concerts ❤❤❤😊
Nah she ATE THAT! Proud of this literal Angel 😭💜
She sound so good and she can flip her own songs very well. Her runs was running. Her vocals are steller. Her face is banging. Her locs always banging. She Chloe Ms. Bailey if you nasty.  for the other gals.
Worried is just my favorite!!! 🥹🥹🔥🔥🔥 and this live arrangement 🔥🔥🔥
One thing Chloe's going to do is sing down and be stunning doing it! It makes sense why hatters continue to hate. If I didn't love myself, I'd be jealous of her too...
💛☠️
It's Arnetta on trumpet!  Yes ma'am!
The breath control????
No How does it feel ?
The guitarist from Ari Lennox’s Tiny Desk is back again
Absolutely amazing!! Love how she switched it up!!
Tiny Desk performances ✨️ Are soooo cool and honest!!! 🎉🎉🎉
“Ms Bailey if you nasty” ? Lol that’s so corny. Leave Janets line alone haha
❤❤❤❤❤❤
This made me so happy😭😭😭
Yesssss I love her 😍
I wouldn't mind an unplugged EP from Chloe. Edit: Can I get another hour or so...🤩
I love her!!! She has a beautiful and powerful voice 😍
Her vocal range is pretty amazing. It's like if Donna Summer, Toni Braxton, Beyonce, Kelis and angels had a baby.  ✨ ✨ ✨
love soo muchhh her  she have like 25 and its a beyonce already
Yayyy ❤❤❤
She did that 👏🏽🥹
One of the most talented. Great performance !!!
You Betta SANG 🎤 🎵👏
she killed this i will never understand the hate she gets. but us fans love her and thats all that matters
I PREFER HER IN THIS SETTING! NIT DOING TOO MUCH, JUST PURE VOCAL TALENT❤
i’m so proud of chloe. sue KILLED this and deserves so much more recognition for her art. cant wait to see her on tour in two weeks. queen.
Singing is so effortless for her, it’s like she is breathing song ❤
Talented, but Sis doesn’t or haven’t found IT. Nothing I felt absolutely nothing.
Beautiful ❤
a maioral
CHIEF’S KISS 😘😍😍😍
the best
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa amazing
She and her songs shine much brighter live than in the recordings. An acoustic record would suit her well.
I love you Chlöe ❤❤❤
In pieces was the best performance ❤❤
Chloeeeee mf baileyyyyyy !!! Super Uber talented and genuine ! She loves what she does and it shows❤❤❤ the arrangements ughhhh ! I wish this was an hour long ! PS her and halles tiny desk episode is my top 3 of all time 😍😮‍💨
Her mic is ON🎙🎙🎙Keep THAT music director..notice most of the songs are either produced or written by her.
This is not good
come on cheat back!
😢😢😢😢😢💚💚💚💚💚haters gonna say it's lip synced 😂😂😂Chloe can do no wrong in my book.  Absolutely adore her like I know her IRL😂🤷🏿‍♀️🤷🏿‍♀️🤷🏿‍♀️🤷🏿‍♀️
Very talented omg love her
When Chloe and Halle drop their next I feel like it’s going to be on a different level that we’ve scene in recent years. Ungodly hour was almost perfect
Chloe should keep her style but switch her sound to this. That jazzy-neo soul sound. She has the voice for it and I think her approach would be a breath of fresh air. This was fye!
The tile of her album sums up what the big machine call the music industry does to people.   Breaks people into spiritual pieces.  She is indeed a talent person.
Can she please record a live version of her album? This sounds wonderful
Love her! She is a great artist! Never change! You are you! That is enough❤
Why doesn't she make an album like thissssss.... she's soooo in her zone , it's so natural I LOVEEE THISSSS😢😢
She’s really good like…. Really excellent
Off top Get um Chole!!!
Chloeeee😍
Chloé is. EVERYTHING.  She has it ALL!  Vocals, Great Dancer, Beauty, Actress...intelligence.
❤❤❤❤❤
super talented!
14:46 the way her voice is literally completely blended with the trumpets. Perfect pitch and all. Effortless. I’m like emotional at the beauty her gift. Lol😅
:)
YES 🎉🎉🎉YES MS CHLOE DO YOUR THING YOU DESERVE THIS & SO MUCH MORE ❤
Wow- LOVE THIS!! So happy to have found you, girl. Beautiful voice and serious talent!
Effortless! Close is so talented.

I love this album live! Wow!!! Wish she had more tour dates!
🎶 🎵 🎤 🥰🥰🥰
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This was fireeee I could hear all the words!✨
I ❤ so much
👏♥️
Go Chloeeee💗
She didn’t do her best songs. 🤔
she's a very natural musician
Unreal x
🤍🤍🤍
This was such a fun performance! She should be so proud 🤩❤️
Love you but you didn’t sing my song ❤️
Well, wow. Thank you Chloe and friends. That was emotional!
I will be coming back for more for sure🔥
May God continue to keep you surrounded 🙏🏿 with  love, happiness, and strength. You're a phenomenal woman. Love you, sis❤
Ms Bailey if you're nasty I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE!!!!!! Chloë KILLED IT and the musical arrangement is AMAZING!! Will have this on repeat FOR SURE!!
she looks absolutely stunning
Chloe Bailey is the goat, I'm ready for whatever you drop!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Murdered it.
Haven't even watch this and I know it's gonna be amazing
💪💪💪💪💪💪🔥❤️❤️❤️
Janet gone forever have an influence on the girls… FOREVER
SHE ATE !!!!!!!!!
Wait… this is incredible
Sang Sis❤..Love it
Don’t know any of her songs but I’m bout to watch this whole thing 💯😂
She’s really talented! Honestly, I smiled the whole time watching her tiny desk concert 😍 Let me go rediscover her album!
it's clear why beyoncé chose them, the versatility is unmatched. this proves she could easily release an stripped down jazz influenced album and would eat it up. she can do any genre!
👍🏾
Idk why y’all be giving her a hard time. She ATEEEEE 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
literally smiling throughout the whole thing. what a performance!!! great band!!
Her voice even gets richer when she sing  vocal demanding songs... notice how her voice was so rich when she sand "In Pieces"
Now this is TALENT BABY!! So so proud of Chloe. The mic is ON! Can we get into that version of Body Do though??!! I cannot wait to see more from her. She is multitalented and so so humble & unashamedly herself and it will take her far. We love you Chloe!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I’m screaming yessss. Drop these versions now
I love how she is so cute and giggling but once she starts singing she feels it  and becomes a whole baddie 😍❤️so proud of you Chloe 👸🏽 insanely talented. U deserve all the success in the world❤️
Killed it! She’s absolutely amazing !❤
Pure talent
YASSS! I've been waiting for Chloe to do Tiny Desk for so long. So proud of her and Halle. Our girls are killing it!
The band was jamming with body do just vibes
The way she was hitting them vocals runs with so much ease is a testament to her talent
Chloe can carry any performance! explendid and exceptional! keep growing and acumulating wisdom
Where is make it look easy😭😭😭😭😭😭
Imma have to revisit the album after this because these songs are sounding good
Go CHLOEEEEEEEEEEEE, her amazing voice and charisma
I wish she would’ve done “pray it away”
Smiled the entire performance. Your voice is truly angelic. Love how happy her crew is too 🤎 love this and love YOU, girl!💫 Not big on concerts but would definitely go to to yours. This is my fav tiny desk concert lol 🧚 you've truly came a long way vocally and grew into a beautiful young powerful woman
2:47 she’s so unserious😭💀
Such a talent!!!
I really love Chloe and do think that this tinier format is very fitting for her in this career phase :) she has a ton of energy and can entertain on the biggest stages, but i really love this calming energy of the tiny format. Everything sounds so effortless, out of this world and very grounded here. :) keep going, girl!!! :)
Ugh I love her down
🩷🥂🍿
YES
chloe’s artistry and talent is undeniable and i hope this performance puts back in pieces on the charts cuz she deserves.
Love music 🎼🙏🍀🎵🎶👌🎸✌️🎤🥁🎹
She’s definitely one of the girls that have staying power!
YESSSSSSSSSS👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I loved the album but this performance made me love it even more!!! 😭 the vocals and pure energy. Literal star😭😭
a VOCALIST 😭😭 so beautiful
The way she uses her voice and sings is a whole production by itself. She’s channelling music and emotions through her body… She’s so talented AND ALIVE 🤯👏🏻
This was everythinggggg❤❤❤
Chloe is genuinely in her element right now. Love it❤
Ate that right on up!!!!!!!   I think acoustic songs is her lane. This made me love these songs even more, I need the stripped down version ASAP!!!  The hate she gets is ridiculous to me she is talent and beauty personified. She deserves it all.  Also, she is in concert y’all. Get those tickets.
YAAAAAS!!!
she crushedddd it
Love me some chloeee❤
I'm screamingggggggh (internally)haven't even started watching it and l can confirm that her voice has already blown me away❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm so glad she didn't change! Her style, sound.... 🔥🔥💯❤️❤️🎶🎶
Nah she went crazy 🔥 🔥
COMO É LINDA O MEU BEBÊ!
Whew! Come through Chlöe 🎶
this could be bland but it‘s exquisite
She absolutely smashed it!!
🔥🔥🔥
0:02 - Suprise ✨✨ 2:55 - Body Do 💜💜🏋️‍♀️ 5:16 - I Don’t Mind 🪄🍑 7:58 - Worried 🪬 11:29 - In Pieces 💔❤️‍🩹 15:52 - Cheatback 💣📿
Sheer excellence!
So good! Brava, Chloe ❤

She reminds me a bit of Alisha keys
I absolutely love these new arrangements! Chloe killed this!
Chloe is one of the faces of the new generation. She truly has the IT factor!!
❤❤mad love for Chloe 🎉
i want ur voice to marry me
I love how many incredible WOMEN are in this band!
The vocals omg 🥲she sounds amazing !!!
Chloe is so talented!! She's born to be a star!!
We love you Chloe
I am surprised that Chloe did this so early in her career.
🤎🤎🤎
They posted a sneak peak over two months ago. What took so long to share the full concert?
This wasn’t long enough!!!
I appreciate Chloe so much and her talent. Shout out to the bass player! Love when I see a woman playing my favorite instrument that I am learning myself! 💖✨
I'm digging dude in the bucket hat on the drum pad.
RANNNNGGGGEEEEEEEEE
A FORRRRCE 🫶🏾🫶🏾
Chlöe is such a remarkable talent ❤
I was looking forward to how does it feel but I’m grateful
This child is good, great voice ,amazing control and she's very beautiful. But I feel like it's mimics than genuine things..     There's a lot of great singers, a few that have soul or identity I guess that's what set them apart
The way I've been waiting for this one
A+ performance as usual 🔥🥰⭐️
I wish she did Feel Me Cry!!! A lot of people are missing out on a great album just because they don’t like how she expresses herself as a GROWN WOMAN.
Black Women are the True GODS!!! A GODDESS natural Beauty!!
Listen yall!! She's working the band!
Its the vocal acrobatics for meeeeeee 😍👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I can’t wait to watch this when I relax after a long work day. I already know the vibes will be exquisite. Update: and I was right.
the talent !!!!!!
This is a whole f*****g vibe!

Miss trumpet at 8:43!!!!!!
Ughhh her album so GOODDDDDD
Ate this up!
wearing a crucifix all while glorifying promiscuous behavior. Demonic and shameful. I plead the blood of jesus over these lost people.
phenomenal per usual Chloe.
People really slept on this album. It’s so good.
She ATE that body do

Cheat Back was thee MOMENT!!! Big Sister Ratchet did that!!!
Shout out to being fully covered!!!
She is phenomenal. She was born for this. Music just flows through her veins. Get ready for this wonderful talented woman to show the diversity that she is capable of.  It’s coming! ❤
Bday vibes !! Proud of you Chloe❤
She has a beautiful voice and I love her energy! She’s a great performer.
Absolutely loving the stripped back jazzy New Orleans, Afro, Latin vibe she going for with this  😍😍😍 it's so simple yet so textured
I see Chloe, I click, I like. No questions.
Chloe's growth into this incredible musician has been so beautiful to witness. She has come so far as an artist and I'm so proud of her. I really loved this live arrangements of the songs and her spectacular band pulled it off exceptionally well. I'll definitely be watching this tiny desk performance regularly.
I love the live version.  GO Chloe!
ooh. Chloe. Is it ring sting? Because....well anyway
You will be sicker than polio. -Chlöe Bailey.
The who’s bad TRINA interpolation in Body do!! 🔥🔥
This awsome and I love that jazz neo soul vibe
CHLOË!!! Get it girl! Gorgeous WITHOUT makeup & more talent in your pinky than most!!!
Chlöe is such a great artist she deserve so much more !
I’m so proud of her.
YESSS I've been waiting for this
Feel me cry would’ve gone crazyyyyyy
In pieces et Cheat back étaient particulièrement excellents. Chloe tu es très douée, continue de montrer au monde ton talent.
The transition from Surprise to Body Do 😍😍😍
She good and all but. She only got one album. I thought maybe this is for icons or ppl with more then 1 album
‘Body Do’ is a completely different record, in this setting. Chlöe’s selling point is her ability to emote and perform. This is something that I don’t feel her recorded material captures. She is a phenomenal artist - waiting on that one special project that captures her entire essence, not just the trends. She’s got it all. ❤️
Wow what A GREAT rendition of Body Do
I would have also loved to hear "Make it look easy". ❤
Her giggles 😊😊😊
SHE IS AMAZING
Her vocal agility and flexibility is so amazing to witness and the transitions were immaculate. ❤❤❤❤
Chloe said, I don't need background singers lol imma do it all
Amazing performance, such a force of nature! I really love you chloe, you're one of my biggest stars
MS. BAILEY!!!! i love this album so much and this live version is giving me life!!! i want to see her on tour so bad!!!
No background vocals needed!!!!
We love you Chlöe!
This girl is so talented!!!
Love Chloe!!! ❤️🔥❤️🔥
The end of Body Do 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
LETSGOO CHLOE MYQUEEN
💛💛💛💛💛
i feel like her voice and the music wasn't matching, sth waa off idk
Her breathing is INSANE!
Love "Cheatback". One of the best Tiny Desk!
She ATEE thisss 🤍🤍🤍🤍
I love this!!!! Chloe is that girl!
Nooo but that transition from body do to I don’t mind😭🔥
Is it weird that I like this version of her music BETTER than anything she's released. I wish THIS was the album ♥
I have to be honest. I only listened to the full album twice (besides the singles that i really like) but hearing this sets makes me want to listen the whole album over and over again! this is the type of promotion the album needed 🤍
GIVE US VOCALS CHLOE!!😍👏🏾 I simply love her voice and how she emotes.
Worried was my favorite song, I wish it got a video
The lil mermaid ain't lil no mo ooo wee
For her first written album she did great only up from here how many can do that in there mid twenties. Most dont even know what they going to do with there lives. She is not Beyonce because she plays instruments also. Another talent she got. And remember  Beyonce was not the first she copied others. And as the saying goes  copy the right  cats. Chloe will come into her own she only 25.❤❤❤❤❤Vocals are fantastic as always from the Baileys.
Come on “Ms Bailey if you nasty” 😍😍😍
I thought I was trippin when I saw Chloe tiny desk
I love when you can see and feel the musicians feeling the music in their soul. They be in a different galaxy. Chloe did great, sounds amazing & looking good! My fave was cheatback 💛
whew. . she need to do a live version of her album asap because this is amazing ❤
Incroyable ❤️
Thus was so fun 💃 We love you Chloe❤❤❤❤
*Miss Them 😢*
one of my fav artists ever!! so talented 🫀
Where is Shakti’s TD?
Worried 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love the smoothness and ease of this 😍
❤ The mic 🎤 is ON! 🎶 What a great performance! Chloe and NPR gave me thee best birthday 🎂 present 🎁.
The intro gave me chills Chloë!!!
i love me some Chloe !!
♥♥♥👏👏👏chole song are beautiful. keep doing what you're doing. I enjoy your little concert. Go Chole!
❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥🐐
Vocally, y’all need to keep Chloe’s name out y’all mouth, she always makes CHOICES and I love her for it 😍❤️
Beautiful band!
My ears are TINGLING 🥰
Not really my subject matter. But I love her voice and beauty and performance quality. These sisters are so well trained and her musicality is pristine. I would love a worldwide global anthem from this doll. She is very passionate. I know her album is a good album. I just have no relation to certain kinds of relationship song. Vocal skills are everything.
I love her energy!! She licked the plate with this one 🥵
Chlöe Bailey is so beautiful and talented! She’s so sweet! I met Chlöe twice, this year! She’s always been sweet! 🥰💞
The girls in her band are enjoying every second of it! Grooving and vibing! Same girl same 🙌🏼🫶🏼✨
Great job Chloe 💛🌻
OMG I was waiting for this
She sounds amazing!! She’s a legend in the making💙
This is how I like Chloe. Just behind a mic. I love her and respect her ability to create the art she wants to create. But as a fan, these moments where the focus is simply her incredible instrument ... she is at her best.
Love me some Chloe 🤎
Her voice is beautiful!
She should release an unplugged version of her debut album using this arrangement and similar order. This was excellent!
THE Derek Dixie 🔥
Breath control something serious
Her and sister's live performances always elevate my love for a song !!😭 ❤
The way I wouldn’t have been able to be quiet in the crowd😂😂😂
Her low tone!!!!!
Whew! ❤
ABSOLUTELY YES!!!!! A true artist! She's going to go so far. Her ability to change up her songs using old singing techniques is incredible
I couldn't understand the hate before, but now I do. This type of talent and beauty will naturally trigger insecure and negative haters, but you know what?! She's got the talent, personality and tenacity to convert them just by living her truth. Her inner strength is dazzling; and makes her all the more beautiful as she blossoms into her purpose. So proud of you Chloe.
🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅
She reminds me of beyoncé
The band is so groovy!
We see you young sista!! DOPENESS!! 💕❤️💕
Screaming aaaahhhhh❤❤❤❤
I loved it
Go CHLOE!!!!
I always love how she seems nervous but always crushes it!! I hope that passion never dies.
Chloe is so talented this was one of my favorite Tiny desks. Like never play about her vocals. Whew 🔥🤍
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
one of the best performance on this channel !!! amazing !!! we love u Chloë !!!

Yess boo🥰💞

❤🥹🔥🔥👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾

🎉🎉🎉
She has so much talent ❤❤ love listening to her and watching her perform 💖
This was sooooo good wow the vocal range, control, and just power 😭😭😭 my girl can sangggg ugh she killed it Frfr shut up the haters. Can’t wait for she and Halle to make music together again soon. It’s abt to go crazyyyy 🔥
Great job with your group playing with you Chloe!
❤❤❤ it's so good to see her soaring an having fun.
Who made these arrangements 🔥 Is that what the audio engineer does?
Voice is unmatched
yeah. that’s my SISTER.
Beautiful voice. But I don't feel the music
Wow wow wow Miss. Bailey! The handling of Body Do and I Don’t Mind are really refreshing! You don’t really have to EAT LIKE THIS! And if you don’t CHLÖE produced ALL THESE SONGS! The girl is hella talented! 🎉
So proud of you ❤
Beautiful Chloe! Great job 👏🏾
Yesss transitions🥰🥰🥰🥰
This that one!!!!!!!!!
Victoria Monet , next!!!!!
Interesting juxtaposition between what she’s singing about and that cross hanging around her neck. Not judgmental or prudish here. Just bringing attention to something that’s glaring…
She ate this down. One thing Chloe gone do is a RUNNNN
14:09 Her voice has so many facets... Simply wow. And the band... LOVE! ♥
Love this! ❤️❤️❤️ You did that, Chloe! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
anitta ?? brazilian funk
Yasss, come thru vocals.
THEEE RAAAAANGEEEEEEEEE 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Its the LADY MUSICIANS AND HER VOICE...BRAVISIMO CHLOE!! ❤🎉❤
Voice of an Angel.
Gooddddddd!
Sorry but we needed Tinashe
Please tell me this version will be available on Spotify?😫
Who else is obsessed with I Don't Mind in a way that makes no sense? That's MY song
So did chloe realy got invited before TINASHE??! What a shame..
Was not really interested in her music, but this intrigues me. Maybe mainstream music is too much about other stuff and maybe it prevents us from truly seeing the artistry that lies beneath.
This was so fun to watch. She is so talented. and the band ugh chefs kiss!!!!
This really makes me cry...after the last couple weeks of seeing what she had to endure this just bring me joy. Thank you Tiny Desk for honoring our girl!!! We love you Chloe!!!
Shorty playing the guitar is sexy
I love how she doesn't have background vocals, prerecorded or even background singers. It's just her and I love it
Who wouldn't love this girl!!?! The most angelic voice and adorable laugh! Chloe girl, this is your finest season, you are shining and I'm thankful I'm here for it! 🤎🤎🤎 God bless you! 🙏🏽
She didn’t sing pray it away..:. Ima go cry now .
Choë Bailey, you will always be FAMOUS !!
I love how her tiny desk concert is so contained and small but she still has such Chloe energy like she's on a big stage. You really can't contain her. And I love how engaged she is, with her audience
The strength this girl has to have! All the unneccesary hate she gets for everything...her talent speaks for itself. She is discovering herself just like any other artist and it's really wonderful to see her continue to soar. I am excited for what is in store for her and Halle.
Amazing.. they hate she is naturally beautiful n talented.. Legend in the making. She took ur fave blueprint n enhance it. Thats y u hoes mad. Sang, dance, write, produce, act, and some.
Beautiful voice, great band, and what an infectious laugh she has! 👏 👏 👏
Since I was a little girl I keep up with Chloe and Halle, I'm sooo proud 🤍
So proud of you, Chloe. We love you🥺🥺❤️❤️
😍🔥
This is EATING😭❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
she can sing!!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love me some Chloe and Haley their voices are so soothing ❤ I pray her sales went up on her album sales! Cause I loved that entire album 💕🙌🏽🫶🏾
WOO😭❤️ YAAAAAASSSSSSS MS BAILEY IF YOU’RE NASTY (shoutout Janet❤️)
I am really anxious about her song with Anitta ❤
I KNOW DATTTSSS RIGHTTT‼💁🏾‍♀💁🏾‍♀💁🏾‍♀🔥🔥🔥
What I love the most about Chlöe is how she feels so deeply. Some people just sing lyrics off a paper, but she is living her lyrics in the moment. She puts her vulnerability on display and her vocals always deliver. I love her authenticity and how she wears her heart on her sleeve. She's a gem ✨
i need a little belting, plsssssssssssssss
If I run into her while she's here, I'm going to fan girl tf out!
Chole!!!!!! WE ARE SO PROUD OF YOU! That was effortlessly & you owned every bit of your performance 💕🩷🥳
Chloe!!! You did that!! What a beautiful performance ❤❤❤❤
Here before it’s live for an hour. I absolutely love this!!
Straight 🔥🔥🔥
Looove this live concert from Chloe' 💜💜💜🎉🎉🎉
Fantastic! Chloe is truly everything 💞

I love this version of I don’t mind!!
She and her sister are very talented young women ❤
Love love love this❤
Yassss ma'am. You betta sang!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
She is so deserving of so much more stardom. Amazing voice.
I love the stripped down arrangements for these songs, especially I Don’t Mind and Worried. I think I might prefer these versions over the original!  Also the transitions from Surprise to Body Do to I Don’t Mind was too good🔥🔥
The band was giggin I loved cheat back she murdered that shiiii 🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿❤️❤️👌🏿
Chloe liked the vibe!
Beautiful
SHE IS SO DOPE!!!!!!! THE BEST FEMALE R&B ARTIST RIGHT NOW
Chloe done SHOT UP THE STANDARD on Tiny Desk! The seemless song transitions, only breaking a song down when necessary. This performance was everything! Kudos! 👏🏽
She can’t sing.
❤❤❤🗣🗣🗣🥳🎊🎉🎼🎵🎶🎤🎤🎤🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
I'm (AA) but I'm so curious about how Chloe X Halle manage to transform their locs into so many different styles???🤔 Is there a tutorial out?
Chloe breath control is amazing ❤ love her so proud of her! Been a fan for along time every since they covers on YouTube....... Her growth is incredible !
It’s the talent for me 😍😍
If Chlöe has zero fans, I am dead
She is the best out right now! I pray baby girl has a flourishing career and continues to do what she loves to do. Like do y’all hear these vocals?! This control?! THIS TALENT!
She is comfortable, having fun, and absolutely UNSTOPPABLE!!! People may have slept on this album but they WILL see how incredible our girl is!! So happy and proud of her!! 🩷
Chloe é incrível! Que potência, muito bom ver sua evolução. Entrou para minha lista de Tiny Desks favoritos.
We need it to be longer next time plz ❤ I'm happy my notifications finally worked!🙌🏿
Sing!!!
She sounds and looks amazing. Another perfect tiny desk, I wish this style of music would play on the radio.

Breath control, excellent. Vocal acrobatics, spectacular. Stage presence, fabulous. Crowd engagement, wonderful. Skill, undeniable! (Musicians, delightful!) Chlöe’s performance is special to watch as usual!
The caption was so short and generic. I have always enjoyed reading the caption. Surely there's more to say about this performance and performer @nprmusic

🎉🎉🎉🎉
The girl is talented, and hopefully, there's not a distraction involved, and we can simply hear her wonderful talents. 😅
years after watching the Tiny Desk episode of Chloe x Halle, seeing her here again, this time in a solo career, with even more maturity and strength is wonderful, I feel grateful to follow the evolution of this multifaceted young artist of only 25 years old, that is the only beginning of more to come! ❤
Big up from Moçambique
Ended Normani
🙌
Finally !!!!
I’ve been waiting for this since her birthday 😭😭😭
Chloe and Halle are going to soar when they release their 3rd album I can feel it. I feel like since they have done their individual albums they have grown more as individuals arguably then they did as a duo vocally, mentally, and, physically. When they come back they will be stronger than ever because before they had there foot in the door now its their time to shine
I just know this is going to SLAY 🔥. Love you Chloe ♥️
can anybody name 5 of her songs?
Oh snap okay girl
She has HALF a hit song known to man....PLEASE MAKE IT MAKE SENSE!
