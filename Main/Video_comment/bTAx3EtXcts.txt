@fusionZGamer I think the suit is from secret of mimic
Looking back now that secret of the mimic it all make sence
Ok
Mimic : Cassie may have a mask, but I have a MASCOT SUIT
Actually, the mimic hasn’t been the most overly focused on villain, Shadowtrap or Glitch Freddy as he was once known as I’m pretty sure is slightly responsible for the mimic’s scooping, because, while you can’t actually see it in the room with you, the control room Cassie is in has a small, purple glitch next to a currently locked and unusable green, glitching door, which apparently reads “IT’S ALL BENEATH THE MIND” with a cardboard cutout of Glitchtrap dead. And Vanny’s face is spray painted on the top of this weird glitch door thing.
You scooped billy bob😢😢😢😢😢😢 (only showbiz pizza ppl know...)
This man is working for so long just for us he needs a medal he said 13 hours!?
I wonder how funny and amazing it would be if you did a collab with matpat.Think about it fusion
I just realized that the suit that the mimic is wearing looks a lot like the twisted carnival robots
What if in the next game we see him as a tiger/lion animatronic that replaces Monty and has his own jungle/savannah like play area
Fusion, Rexter, and Dawko are literally the three musketeers of FNAF.
Those cameras are scary
Hi
Whatever you want
Off topic but pineapple
Why he say it's not a mod
If I win, can I have it on switch or Xbox one?
Up at midnight watching this whole series
I hope Matpat uses you for reference and shouts you out because you deserve even more subs than you have. Your channel is so good and has no profanity which is a plus in my book. Thank you FusionZgamer you're a legend
What suit was that from
Why the suit tho
Ur videos are amazing
Bro imagine
the dedication is insane
Ruin is better than security bleach
doggo
I tried it and it didn’t work all the doors were open except the last one
love ❤️ 😅😅😅
Im probably really late in informing u about this but the blue bunny isn't glitchtrap but rather m.x.e.s. a security system made by gregory (and probably vanessa)
Scoooppppeeeerrrrr yessss I got what I wanted
I really wanna get free copy😊
smeef
gimme da game
Bbbb
-
The scooper yea
I didn’t get the ending for some reason
I need security breach
"Whatever you want"
Cool video
The mimic is a lion
Here for sb copy
MatPat is in ALOTT of trouble.
The suit the mimic uses is actually on when you first see him when you start chapter 8 and get to him. That is how he has the suit on. He didn't put it on after fighting Roxy.
😂 8:20
6:20 secret ending
1:06 gameplay
0:00  intro
Rip FusionZGamer’s sleep
Hi hi hi hi
FNAF security breach ruins🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
😃
plz😀
I only have gotten the normal ending so far but at the end of the credits Roxy says 'cassie'.
There is no way the mimic is dead.
This ruin dlc looks fire ngl I need it on pc💀
The theory about the suit in the mimic so it was like a suit from a old Pizza Plex that they build in like 1985 or something and then it got burned down by a bunch of teenagers and that soup was the only thing you had left and he kept it as a memory but he got mad at anyone who is like a kid or teenager
literally WHAT IS GOING ON
Hi
Anyone else realize that each "new" door he opened it looked the same
Where did you get your username from?
Well going back in chapters to get this ending will not do that. Especially this monty thing because it was like a maze many times went a circle
Dude I love candy cadet I’m so happy he’s here
Reee
They have to make another game there is to much for there not to be a there one
I am your biggest fan 🎉
Hello
I want fnaf security breach for ps4 please
Hello
Hi
I thought Cassie was the one that was going to get scooped😅
For anyone unaware the mimic has the suit when you enter the room it’s in before it chases Cassie
Hi FusionZgamer, me and my friends wanted security breach for a long time now. We sadly could not afford it, although I love your videos keep it going.
I love the way that FusionZGamer always give us entertainment and it is cool watching all the ending you can find in Ruins..
My guess of what the suit is that the mimic was the first ever animatronic made and that was the suit that it had, but also, the sinkhole might be the old FNAF location, and the mimic was stuck down there trying to get out.
Hi fusion enjoyed the series i watched you play first when security breach first came out i liked and hopefully i could get security breach for ps4 ive been a fan for a while and i am subbed love your content and if anyone else reads this than have a good day thanks king
xmn723 deep
I still have a hard time believing that Gregory would just leave Cassie down there, no matter how dangerous the Mimic is.
What ever you want.
Me
Wow nice work fusion!
When the thing grabs the Mimic it is in the lower back the same area where the blob grabs William Afton
truly well done fusion and i hope i win a copy
Why do I see his videos so late?
I had to redo all the cameras because they didn’t save
Can't wait for matpat to do his 20 video's trying to decipher the lore behind this! Great video man, you should take a break soon.
ruin
I wonder if you know this ending if you do the fredbear ending is it different from the Fredbear ending with the mimic?
🐻🐰🐤🦊
Day 18 on asking fusion to play killer frequency
pls game
This is all so interesting cause it also implies that the fnaf 6 location had a scooping room of some kind
I want to not want to be depressed
Fire 🎉
OK BUUUT, am I the only one who thinks Cassie's dad is..... William afton
The Ruin DLC is amazing and these endings and new secrets have me hyped for what’s to come!
😊
Please get some rest
❤❤
love your vids bradley_what
Yay
For some reason to me it looks like the mimic is wearing overalls does it look like that too anyone else
👍
You’re the best
eekkkk
badaboom hand me my security breach pls
You and Matt from Game Theory NEED to collab
Fire video
Hi
I want security breach😾
Just a hunch, but what if the glitched rabbit is a good guy? I mean The Mimic says that it's bad (and who should believe what the mimic says). I think it is really possible
I love the lore in ruin
wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
why tho ? why is this ending a thing ?
I want security breach but I don't have a pc play it😢😢😢I only have my phone
Poor Roxy
Bro killed micheal afton by the scooper
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
GliTch!
ok  look I'm bord buuuut I'm a little rate to the party
I want sb
I love this, they include original game artifacts and its amazing
Cool ending
I was hoping there would be an ending for the "glitch trap" bunny. Like maybe cassie becomes the next vanni.or maybe he worked out to be trying to help her Or something.
😮😮😮😮
Lots of secrets
A young Sheldon said the behzinga
I tried to do the ending  but when the door are all open I try to go to the chase but the door never opens
I think thats a bear soot because candy cadet he said that a bear was trapped down in the basement for a vary long time in his story.
Mr Fusion may i have a copy of the game I love watching your videos they are so fun to watch
Fusion being a real one not only playing thru the entirety of this in one day, but also getting all endings. Reason why I’ve been subbed for years
i need this pls
That animatronic was most likely Chipper since it looked like a beaver.
6:20 if you want to skip to the ending
Hi
I’m happy I’m binge watching this
matpat we need you
Ruin
Considering The mimic used voice lines from the original game he may have been listening to us talk in security breach
Hi
This has been such a fun series to watch I've really enjoyed this
Didn't realize how iconic the Scooper was in my head until seeing its silhouette fold back up to the ceiling. I guess it's a staple of the franchise now.  Cool tech, Henry, why were you like this
scooper do be scooping
hellllllllllllllooooooooooo
12 hours dammm i’ve watched all of the video  I liked and subed
there’s a room in bonnie bowl with a bunch of baby plushies with them giggling. before they disappear , there’s tally’s on the wall. i think the mimic’s endo is baby’s. before elizabeth’s death baby’s eyes were blue, after they were green, & there was yellow eyes everybody was confused about long ago. now hear me out. the endo has hair on top of it & the secret “ scooping room “ is hinting at baby sister location. not to mention we’re getting a FNAF helped wanted 2. candy cadet basically hinted the monster in the “ basement “ sung the lullaby. literally sister location… baby or the mimic was scared of dark basements.
Like
I saw that markiplier saw that same camera with the door
“Whatever you want”
please give me a copie
Has anyone pitched that the mimics face looks like circus baby?
Hey if she’s is the game and my buddy hey I would really like a copy of this game and like always I commented six parts before so this is my sevenths times saying that I would really want a copy but one thing is this game on Xbox
is the mimics suit that chipmunk animatronic from scotts other game?
It’s the scooping room
hi
That's crazy
I barely realized my guy is buying around 12 copies of the game which means my guy is spending over 600 dollars I think since each copy costs like 60$
i wonder what’s the specific correlation to the stitched up suit… cause he could’ve just put on one of the suits normally
Hi
YOU'RE MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER!!!
i love watching fusiongamerz
It's crazy how many secrets are in this game alone, I can't wait to see what else comes from it
Sister location connected to the Pizzaplex? (Also the mimic really had to get comfortable before chasing)
May i please have security breach? Its my dream fnaf game.
This ending isn’t working for me    I unlock the doors and I guit out but it doesn’t save
the ruin is so cool
Wow candy cadets story really did match up perfectly to the actual sequences
I really, really, really, really,  really, really, really want to play this game
Run
Run
I want a copy
I want a copy so I can give it to my cousin
Bro is the best player ever
Entering to win to get every fnaf game!
I love your content
OK! NEW FEAR UNLOCKED! 6:27
Man bro u really doing the most I applaud u for it 👏👏
I need the copy so pls can i get it ❤❤❤❤
whatever you want
Chick’s voicebox is insane
I’m not sure if either of these endings are canon🤔
i love your videos big fan i love the mimic suit :D
I entered
I love watching these videos and just waiting for the next one
Me please I love fnaf
I'm still confused how Cassie isn't stopped of going in there
This is hella confusing like what is happening???
I wanna scoop Gregory
I feel like Mimic is very close to Ennard. When we know that Ennard stole Circus Baby's voice to trick Michael. I think Ennard was in the sewers still but waiting and hiding. Maybe the wires rusted and Ennard must of got sewer grates to.
This didn't work for me for some reason
can i get a security breach copy :D
These are such good good vids
Hey fusion! I noticed sm after watching a few  different people play the daycare chapter, it seems when you wear the mask around the attendant, sun speaks more- when its off, moon is the one who can be heard. I think this has somthing to do with moon being able to hear sun, even when its dark- in the V.A.N.N.I network, i think suns A.I is connected to it, letting you hear him as moon would when its dark- just a little theory! Id love for you to see this- and maybe talk on it! Love your vids! Remember to take breaks❤
This good
Really cool ending but indeed...which one is common...
THE SUIT LOOK INSIDE THE MOUTH AND ITS NOT A BEAR ITS A LION
It’s just insane how that thing looks, it almost more like one of the jr.’s animatronics. But this is awesome and I can’t wait for you to find everything!
The ending name doesn't make sense because that looks way different from the scooper in sister location and not just the "things change a bit in different games" but because this arm thing hangs on the ceiling and has claws while the sister location scooper sits on a wall with a large metal scoop on the end. My guess is it's an extractor of some sort we have yet to hear about because the mimic wasn't taken out of the suit like the scooper does to the ft's it looks like it extracts whatever powers it or it turned it off idk
Whatever I want
oh yeah
Burger👍
why is the mimic in dat suit!!!!
that's a good story
I hope I win
All the fanf fans left in 2023 are watching this video ❤
You should check chapter 8 now that you "unlocked" the suit? Does it have the suit now when it fights roxy?
Did he figure out if he got something from beating the golf game?
Watever you want
I did all of this and I didn't get the ending because IT DIDNT SAVE AHHHHH
awesome
Thanks for making the amazing content but still make sure to get some rest 😊
gregorys a naught boy
You are the best youtuber ❤❤❤
This DLC is literally blowing it out of the water! Ive been binging this series and it is awesome! Love scott for creating fnaf, love the new movie coming out, and love fusion for delivering content for our eyes.
Another door..has been opened 😂
The suit XD
In one of the earlier episodes i saw a Minecraft box in one of the stalls and I was screaming at my phone telling fusion to get it
i love this channer;
Ruin
I think its an old animatronic
Fusion is so dedicated to this channel. He plays a game for a day straight just to make videos. Love his dedication.
I was wondering the same thing about how the costum2got on the mimic but it was so cool!
Loving the game play
TEH SUIT IS SO SCARY
;)
Did we all agree that this is a reference to FNAF Sister Location?

DaWkO, that one screaming British dude…
love you videos
MatPat is going to droll from the lore
that scooper had bro sleep
The scooper returns!!!
"I gotta flex on her" XDDD imagine the mimic wanting to flex off his ✨ suit✨
whatever you want
soup soup
I really want to try to beat the game and dlc lol
Game theory where you at
let's gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Hello W

clickbate? (just kidding ik its real)

Could i get security breach on switch?📷=🚪
Please i did everything can i get a copy on ps4
Cool vid
i’ve always wanted sb i just don’t like to spend money
Matty boy is gonna have one with this one 😂
B)
Wait you shoukd have known before you figured out because of the voice of fake Gregory he uses really big words that like a young kid would not know
Do you have to beat the chapter to save it
Would love a copy of security breach (I'm a Pc player)
Dude ruin has mind fucked my who knowledge of security breach in general
See, I don’t think the Scooper Ending is the canon ending. If it was this easy to kill the Mimic, then why go through all the trouble of containing it? I believe the Elevator Ending is the canon ending. Sets up for a sequel game more than the other two.   I think Roxy will rescue an injured Cassie and fight her way through the Pizzaplex to get her to safety.
The mimic was already wearing the suit when find him after unlocking all of the doors.  You just skipped it.
Love you man❤❤
You always make the best videos on ruin, keep up the good work
I mean in the scoping ending i think you have killed him so cassie should survive and gregory shouldnt kill her right
Wow
Yooooo this is so cool!
on commmputttttttttttttttttteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
ruiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
Interesting
What if that suit is from William Afton before he went inside of the spring lock suit?
Ruin
After seeing that crazy ending, i can't wait to watch what matpat has to say about the secrets.
Better than markiplier and Ryan
THE QA TESTERS 6 OF THEM ARE ROMANIAN WHAAAAT

Apparently the lore for this game is in the FNAF books so if you haven't read them nothing will make sense too you.
Wee woo wee woo wee woo
The main question is what’s the canon endings for both the original game and the dlc? (Idk either please help😭🙏🏾)
hows your day been fusion
Fusion couldnt be a bigget beast for finishing the game and staying up for hours for the content
Plz give it to me, I'm on Xbox
Respect to fusion for staying up for his fans, he the goat

Van I have security breach xbox
Old Freddy suit from the Fredbears family diner? Hand sown suit... that isn't spring bonnie. Thats my guess Edit: or... my second guess.... its one of Henry's old suits...
Xbox security breach
securitybreach
fusion rexter and dawko are the best trio in fnaf
I love your videos
I love your vids
I would have never found this ending
I need security breach this dlc is so cool
Hi
I love fnaf
The mimic is terrifying
I'd like security breach alot
I can't believe the mimic just got scooped 😮
Hiiiii youre THE goat of sb
7 down
What if the suit he puts on is the suit you're in on night four of sis location and the comic pages are little.drawings of the difrent sb endings
how do you find all these secrets brodie
uhh so for some reason the ending didnt work i have activated all the doors and i have quit to title and it didnt work. did they like remove endings or something?
I think Freddy is Gregory’s animatronic and Roxy is Cassie’s animatronic
Ive been binging this series and it is awesome! Love scott for creating fnaf, love the new movie coming out, and love fusion for delivering content for our eyes. Thank you fusion!
We should name the new skin Mikey
\
hi
ooga booga
So, theory. The machine down there isn't the scooper, instead, I think its an upgraded version of it. After all, it looks incredibly different and seemingly has tracking abilities, but it works for the same purpose. Who built it? Im not sure.
Hello again btw cassie was the girls in those cutouts in roxy raceway
To die
Why would Gregory leave Cassidy behind
super creative comment x2
If you look closely into the mouth of the new suit the mimic is in, you can see a rotting corpse (I think that’s what it is) 6:29
Wish that was canon
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
MY COPY RUIN
Ooooooooo
Is it William afton's original golden bunny suit ? The vest looks like faded doe
Hi
BRO THE MIMIC IS THE Piñata U GET AT THE START OF THE GAME
Good video, hope to play this soon.
Bro that suit was so unexpected and then bro just dies after getting all fancy to kill you
I love this game
That costume is hilarious lolll
Fusionztheoiry
It must be so hard to find the secret cameras without help
This is cool
Bendy and the dark revival
I agree with you, why did he put on that costume, what is he doing
:)
i love how most of fusions videos are pretty mush live, since he posts them pretty much right after recording them! it makes me so happy to see unedited videos! :]
Chicken fingers
Pls me i dont have Any of the games but have Been a fan of fnaf Sins 2017
Hello!
If I win could I please have a Xbox one copy

Nice game
Plz

Monty arcade game

FNAF: Security Breach
I didn't even realize you could zoom in and out on the cameras
The Mimic’s suit is so weirddd, if someone showed me that I wouldn’t believe it was in the game.
Can i gte fnaf security breach on steam plz
Yo!
lol
I think about the chica voice box thing I don't know if you found it yet but I think maybe there can be like a goal to like repair all the animatronics Gregory destroyed like give Roxy her eyes and stuff like that I'm not sure but that's just my first thought
keep up the good work love your vids
Monkeman104
Commented
Please can i have security breach ruin for my youtube channel

Hi

Could I get it on nintendo
Nice
Didn’t even know is it supposed to be a lion or Hamster looking animatronic? It also looks like he’s looking out through the mouth…
i liked this ep so much one of of the best ones
gib me braech
The mimic is so toxic after defeating roxy he put on a goofy suit
The Mimic basically emoted on Roxy💀
I want more endings that show What Cassie is doing, i feel like We dont know enough about her
I want to Scot give you the best fnaf player award
What ever you want.
The bonnie mask and that mimic looked like fnaf jr charecters
I can't tell if mimic is wearing a lion or dog costume.
I love to see you get all the secrets
i wanna play security breach pops
not rlly a fnaf fan but ily
.
hi
nice video :)
This would feel like a good ending. The mimic dies, and Cassie survives.
I bet you can restore Chica Roxy and Monty by finding arcade games like the chica eater arcade
Fusion is the best YouTuber.
Yay
Hi  Who is your favorite fnaf game
P
Your amazing Fusion! I liked the video before it started and I subbed
Bro SteelWool Studios are like the BEST just like Scott Cawthon and FusionZGamer too😀😀😀
I’m here for copies😊 good job dude😊
Who also see helpie face change like he has veins on the back of his head and his eyes change color I think the mimic takes control of helpie
I just became a FNAF fan a few months ago and I love it!
MAN U FIND EVERYTHING, U SHOULD BECOME A SPEEDRUNNER
gimme ruin ptrettty pls
Hello
Sleep
Bro the suit from the final animatronic looks like sundrop Is that just me?
Scooping room
You have a brother
That might be a Mimic Animatronic that was not displayed in the pizzaplex and kept it as a secret.
whatever you want   XD
EEE
whatever you want (that what you wanted me to say)
Secret tunnel
I think its important to note... Its ALL of his suits.
Hi i have been watching your videos for a really long time and they are more entertaining than any others I have seen from other channels.
Hope you are having a good morning cause god knows I’m not.
Copy of chapter 24 now if I never got one because last time I really wanted it really bad so can I get a copy of 1:37
Can I get a copy of chapter 204 not because I never got one because last time I texted you said you were going to sell chapter one and I really wanted it but I didn't get it 😭
I need one of the games because I never played for now and I want to play chapter 2 because I never play chapter one so and I'm not lying I never play chapter 12 can you send me a copy of chapter 2
e
I love you and dawkos bromance
Monty’s kinda zesty ngl
cool
Is it just me or are the character designs very similar to Hello neighbor?
Security breach ruin
I would've liked it if they added a line from gregory as you use the elevator after this ending since last time he killed you for the sake of keeping that thing down there but now its dead
awesome video fs
Could I get a copy of security breach on Xbox?
I love that whatever content fusion makes he always keeps it entertaining, he started off doing fnaf, then onto fnaf fan games and now he's moved onto roblox and other horror games but he's doing it because he enjoys it he's not doing it for views
It was from the bizarre k8ng guy
Run
sassy
I need this I don't have enough money to buy security breach can I please have it
I have a theory that the mimic took all of the skins (yes I know it sounds weird) but like the covers of the animatronics and wore them. As you can see he has Monty's face and Freddy's hand. Also as you can see from the Monty animatronic that he is only endoskeleton.
Your mom
I tried this but it didn’t work for me
WHAAAAAAT
Hii
🦊🦊
Fnaf lore is mindblowing
I love all the LOREEEEEEEE. I can't wait to watch MatPat theorise about this game!! Also I love the dedication from you and other fnaf youtubers so thank you for everything!
hi
I love your videos
Hi
I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really  want to play ruin
I can always count on you to upload these gameplays so fast 💕 watched you’re entire security breach series when it came out so I was excited to watch again for this dlc 💕
I really want to win I want to play the game so bad! I play on switch
Because the glitchtrap was preventing the mimic from getting out,in the end when you deactivate security,don't press yes,press no and that might be a new ending where GLITCHtrap fights it off
I really like this and i am really excited to see all the endings
I need that copy
Huh
HE IS DIED!!!
hi
i want a copy of fnaf ruin cuz i love your vidios and my mom wont let me buy any games thad cust money

Hi
Hi
hello
Bro really put his birthday suit on
There's a dead body inside the mouth of the new mimic if you look in it.
THis is so cool
If u think about it that rabbit that look like shadowbonnie😮
The DLC seems very cool might buy the game?
Was it the clown animatronic that everyone has been gossiping  about from the kids drawings
Hi

Still trying to win the givaway

I'm going to love this dlc
FNAFF
How is this dlc free I get that you have to buy the game but like this is a game on its own
Hi
Ranced cheese
I'm enjoying these videos for the most part... but you don't have to fill every second with commentary.
should try letting the roxy scene play out instead of holding E and deactivating her - maybe it could be something different.
Yippee
This looks like the canon ending but we would have to wait until a book or some more secrets to find out
I went on YouTube to find out the dlc released and Fusion already had beaten it multiple times, lol.
I want that game please
I agree
I love how fusion would do all nighters and stay finding secrets and endings. Let's give this man some respect.
amazing video man
Does he know that rockstar Bonnie is in the game?
banana
This is getting EXCITING!
Bro could I please get security breach my username is mclogyn21
HHHHH.HHH.HHHH
Do you have to beat the game again while getting the cameras?
Wait is that the scooper from fnaf sister location?
nice
The secrets are getting very interesting!
Nah the title of the video is giving me bad vibes
i appreciate the grind keep up the good work
B
i want a shoutout
Fusion is literally serving the community with his content
Can Someone help me. My game glitched and the third door won’t open.
Now I'm curious if the Mimic would be using that suit when he's revealed to Cassie or just when the chase starts
can i win?????
bro posted the first like 6 or 7 then posted the rested today
Lest og
I wonder If you can find Roxy’s eyes, not Monty’s hands though, He’s aggressive and I don’t care about him anymore.
Can we get much higher oahhh
OOOOOOGA BOOOOOGA!
fancy suit unlocked
Hi
For me the cameras didnt save so im very confused
these videos deserve so much appreciation for how much content he uploaded in such little time
the new mascots are really scary
This is  getting good
I tried to get the sanding I thought all the steps, and when I tried to get it, it did not work
Wiw
I would love to win the game I been really wanting to play
I'm happy you're doing this, I don't own the game I don't even know if it's on xbox but as a fan of fnaf im thankful
Love your videos
These endings are so cool!!
im amazing - prt 7
that suit looked like a lion but i dont know of any fnaf character thats a lion tho
fnaf sb secrets are so interesting I love watching the secret endings and just being the most confused I have ever been lol
congrats fusion for going this fast on the vids and thank u
so gregory betrayed cassie cuz he knew the mimic was going to follow her and didnt want to let him out so he had to kill cassie and not let the mimic out so gregory is kind of the hero 🙃
Hi hi
Why does the mimic have another form now?
5:23 paper pals are on the right
Hello I love how u make ur vids:D
Its Crazy thinking how FNaF SB came out over a year ago, it feels like it was yesterday we were waiting in 2018-2019 for it to come out.
Hi
Fusion Z gamer has come along way from this to being in the Fnaf movie trailer we appreciate you fusion
Such a great video
epiccccc
I would love to have that copy of the game
This has been fun so far
Toy Story fans the claww yes it is the claw of 2023
mrow
If you play the game normally and find the secret cameras he just has the suite on when you get to him
Hi
i love pinapples
Bruh imagine the animatronics watching you phase through walls and doors
He done got scooped!
Hi and awesome video.
In the elevator ending Roxanne says Cassie now it might be the mimic or not but i hate cliffhangers but this one is rhe worst ever
Tbh the original mimic ending is kinda scary but then there's that secret ending and it just makes it less scary and more funny
i did this ending i was so happy
Fusion if you hack on this part there is two more mascot suits you can find
And also my name is Sebastian
Please do a video of you reading your comments and please read mine I love you vids especially sb ruin I stayed up all night and watched them
cheese balls are yummy
VR please
for some reason I have done everything and it still doesn't work. How would I fix that?
Can I get security breach
Scoooop!!!
I love this dlc❤
I could never finish the game “chicas feeding frenzy
i have not seen a single person do the zoom camera thing this is really surprising
Bro, you literally talking that fasr is so thrilling, just: suhsudoiaspoasochleubsldcbalsucablivudbosuvsibsidc NOW LET"S GET STARTED! and im like AAAAHHH YES
I love all your content can’t wait to see what the future holds
WUTEVER YOU WUNT
that end music hits hard
I really hope the canon ending isn't the one where gregory is portrayed as the villain now
Let’s take a moment to appreciate that this man played for 12h
The dedication of this man is through the freaking roof
Wel I typed ("whatever you want") 😏
Gfd
loooore
Hi
I love this series
a copy of security breach ruin
Please man you need some more sleep I love your videos but this is a huge lack of sleep
I have no idea what to say. This man is a legend
Bro i would've passed out by now 😂
Bro this will take me days to finish the game this guy finished it within 8h
It’s cool how you can keep going in this game.
It didn’t work
Oh yeah😮
That was an interesting costume he wore
hi i love your vidios
The suit looks like a lion to me
W video

Look at the bracelets on Cassie and the bracelet on the mimic suit.
Awesome:-DDDD cool video, really great work😃👍👍👍👍👍👍 And I like the name glitchtrap
Hello
I still can't believe how fast you got through this game, it's crazy
i LOVE THIS VIDEO ITS MY FAV!!
W for Fusions dedication to this game. I am thoroughly impressed.

Entering givaway
fake video
That was crazy
part 7
“Whatever you want”
i have been watching you for a long time and your one of my favorite youtuber and i just really enjoy when you post a new video.
I have a feeling that the next game theory is going to take a long time to come out because we don't even know how many endings there are and there could be more for security breach
Ok
whatever you want
best series
secret ending?!?!
Fnaf security breach
So darn dedicated love you and i want you to know your my go to to any Fnaf game gameplay
Beat
this game loks so fun. hope i win
Hey fusion loving these videos cant wait for you to play Help wanted 2
I think the idea of being able to zoom out to find secret cameras was a really cool idea, most people wouldnt think to check if you could zoom in and out because of the way its designed
I like your videos
Welp DLC3 we gotta deal with the Blob then
WwW
You are the greatest you tuber
This rules
Dooors or wheels? Hehe
Nice
I like how this game has a lot of different endings like the base game
Thank you Fusion!
This game is always good to watch especially with you And if I win the way of giving Id ask for it on switch
It's not working for me. Every time I find all four secret doors on the cameras and leave, it doesn't open the doors.
Helo😁
this man is a legend for posting all parts in a single day
"you are in the scooping room now" -circus baby
It didn’t work.
Bro tried to flex with his suit and got scooped. Hey that rhymed!
He deserves a lot more subs
gggggggggggggggggg
Glamrock chika
fnaf security breach
Hi
Is that a mod???
You want to see the scooping room?
Yo. Little Easter egg I found. You know by the giant scissors? Well, there is a cardboard cut out of Gregory and cassy.
Meep meep
Neat
What if the mimic was the first animatronic William Afton made
Hi
HI
2:18 Meet the Sniper
Hey man I really loved this dlc and your play trough, I kinda want to experience it on my own but I don’t have security breach, I would definitely love to play it if someone got it for me or if I bought it. Keep the good stuff Fuzion!
Every time I see a game releasing in a few weeks I already know fusion has it
"This is not a mod"!  Me: Probably is🤔
Crazy
pld sb
Keep up the great work dude
How is the pizzaplex on top of the location in sister location and the original location?
Hey id like a copy of security breach for xbox please!
Maybe Mimic left the costume in this ending and isn’t in the suit so maybe he isn’t actually dead
🦍
That looks like a mix of sun and a chucks cheese mascot
Hi fusion
Gregory you got to vent
This ending is definitely higher effort than the others besides the main one.
I can’t wait for all the gears to start turning in MatPat's head. Thank you for taking the time to unlock everything!
You are the best FusionZgamer
i love your videos
Can we all just appreciate how fusion, dwako  and his brother were worling so hard to get these endings.
FusionZGamer I love you your the best youtuber that has the best horror game content to me ever and I would really Apriciate it if I had a copy of security breach please i mean my computer probably wouldn't run it but still i really want a copy of security breach so i can get the dlc for it and i really apriciate your content keep up the good work your the best
Heeheee
Content is amazing 🤩
Nootnoot
I followed on on my old account and I watched all videos and never got bored it’s the fact you stay up to be the first to get videos out and I love that and many people do to you have my love and respect❤
I can't get over how he just pushed through all night to complete all of it
Just thought I'd point out the suit is likely the Lion suit from the end of the story "The Mimic," although it does look slightly differently than described, it could be the same one. It could also be just a new suit that didn't appear in either The Mimic or the Epilogues, as two others (bird and elephant, which aren't seen in the books) also appear in the room behind him. We know he didn't put on every suit in the location, only a select few he wears, whilst racks of costumes in dedicated rooms AND hidden rooms exist in the location. It's not a surprise if he's wearing some other suit that wasn't described.
What are the choices
Incredible, did the mimic appear elsewhere? Or is this his first appearance?
i love pancakes
I think it just didn’t load in for you your first play through
hey starting a youtube channel with my friends this game would help allot but 😶😶😅
The mimic went fredbear mode
Been watching Fusion for years and always loved his content. He works so hard to put out videos for us and I really admire that. Love all the FNAF content he’s put out. Currently watching this during a power outage in Puerto Rico. Love his videos for entertainment and comfort 🫶
Hey yall
This is EPIC
i wonder where the mimic came from… any theories?
Fnaf security breach dlc
The ending with the mimic be like: HELP ME Me: It’s a canon event
Nice video wonder what costume the mimic is wearing
that wes cool
😂
For when you were talking about the suits, where the mimic was sitting there were multiple suits by it an elephant and something else that a forgot but there was also a lion suit in the files, the mimic combined all the suits together to make the big suit you see in the scooping room
I really want Fnaf Secuity Breach because, i won't lie, i pirate a lot, but the fnaf series is the only game i couldn't bear to pirate because its so amazing, i practically own every game besides security breach, because well, money's tight so i can't spend money on games at the moment,
the fake gregory had to die cause you know it can k!ll anyone.
Yo Fusion If you Go to Chapter one there Will be a stratic Screen on a TV wich will Show Shadow Bonnie from fnaf 2 in it for a Second.
a round of applause to our good man Fusion. Eat some food and take a nap, bro. We love you, but take a break so you don't.... perish.
you remember where ruin chica deactivates in the bathroom can you put the voice box back in her?
Is it just me or does that suit look somewhat like the bite of 87?????
hi fusion ur one of my fav ytbers
I tried the ending but it didn’t work.
YOUR UPLOAD SCEDULE IS CRAZY KEEP IT UP
Pickle 🐛
how do people even finds these endings it must take a lot tho
Security breach
thank you fusion for playing the whole game just like security breach, it was fun staying awake to watch the whole game
How does fussion and dako figure these secrets out
This dlc looks amazing
Ok show me and I will believe it
“Faster then everyone else” fusion you bust these videos out like there’s no tomorrow
I love how there are so many secrets
Whatever you want
Poke
I Like ur Videos
What in the hell is that suit, brother had some interesting fashion choices 😂
:D
Vids are so cool😀
Fusion is the most determined human I have ever seen
Love your  videos  "whatever you want"
That is a really interesting looking suit!😂
ITS NOT JUST A THEORY ITS A GAME THEORY
nice
I watched the whole series on the TV not logged into any account with my sister, I am just liking every video and commenting on them in hopes to win this game cuz I really wanna play it
Love the DLC, I don't have security breach tho
Ruin
Hi
Imo that ending isn't canon, the mimic must be more important than showing up in one dlc.
I think this is the real ending
On the suit it looks like there’s an L I don’t know what it means but it could hint towards something
Fusion Is The Best Man Like It's So Amazing,Just Like This Game I Can't Get Enough Of!❤
RU
I’m late now because I was at a hotel but I love your videos so much you always make my day and I appreciate how you stay up to play ❤
Mimic has a lion suit... i wonder if the lion was ever a mask on one of the kids from the original fnaf mini games.. ya know how some of the pizzaria sims match up in animal to those..maybe he does? Also I remember a lion in certain children art work on the walls in the og fnaf games... i dont read the books..so.. if not what i said maybe its in the books
Oh shnit
CRazy
I love fusions videos
Final ruin
Theory: the glitch in V.A.N.N.I. might be the same thing that was keeping the mimic from the outside world, and the reason it’s attacking you is that it knows Gregory is actually the mimic, and it’s trying to stop you from freeing it.
I wonder if you can fix the animatronics?
Lol that mascot kinda confusing I thought it was a mod lol He thinks hes that big larry game mascot idk Is he a Woodchipper like from chipper and sons
Fusion can I get the game I'm a huge Fnaf fan and love your videos
This guy deserves an award.
Hi
so when finding chicas beak you can go back to when she's broken down in the bathroom and put the beak in her face.
Love your videos
I want itttttt
There’s 4 more suites not just that one
I love to Have Fnaf security breach i love your channel and Its the only game i dont have
GIMME GAME >:>
whatever you want😁😁
Thes is so cool i love it
W
Bro is more dedicated than i could be, but then makes me more dedicated
Hey I think I know you don’t die and you see Freddy I know Freddy not friendly but you see
this was a great video im exited to watch the next one!
Nᴇᴇᴅ sᴇᴄᴜʀɪᴛʏ ʙʀᴇᴀᴄʜ
i like your video
Love your videos btw😊
try not disabling roxy.
It didnt work for me, i tried
and i dont know how to enter if someone could tell me?
hey fusion i am such a big fan and i am subbed on every electronic i have and i just want you to know that you have change my childhood for years!
No way Roxy’s mom😮
I Hope Cassie is the main character or at least ends up being playable in Help wanted 2, because the elevator ending felt too vague. I want to believe that Gregory voice line in the elevator was the real Gregory. But also, if this is going off of the afton ending, would the real Gregory be in this at all?? Is Cassie alive, or dead?? Just oh my gosh, Wool really popped off on this DLC
I feel like this is the good ending the real ending and the very first thing was the fake one because this has to be it there's no way there's no way this is not the real ending
so much sister location vibes
The DLC definitely made the game a lot better… I regret not buying the game during the summer sale…
If you didn’t know Bonnie is actually on the map somewhere it’s a hidden area with a broken Bonnie in Bonnie bowl
Pls
I really wish I had security breach man
i need it pls i love your vids
Monkeys 🙈
Back to back videos! Does this man even sleep??!!
Can I get a copy please 🙏
You need an award for doing these videos 😃 You Chad 😂
CHEESE
Hiii
It didn't work I tried i did everything it didn't work
Fnaf sister location again
Dude, your legit amazing
The mimic is an off brand grimace
No tiredness
Me pla
Secret ending 🎉
I think that suit is Fred bear,idk it just seems too old looking and a little too wearable,like how spring Bonnie was wearable to lure children in,idk tho
❤
are you saying the real gregory is not evil
This game has been so cool!
dawg that suit looks crazy. btw i wonder what room was that and how did cassie managed to exit it
Well secret cameras, that is cool
what if you give the voise box to chica
The mascot that you scoop there are actually three secret mascots one of them. You can’t find what the other two you can it is in the dark room right before you run from the mimic. and it’s all them mixed together
I love this game
I love your content and ive been watching the series since the start of fnaf security breach release and have been binge watching this ruin series, it would be awsome if i win the copy of the game so i can play it myself 🙂
Omg
Het gusion i love ur videos i just want to suggest u to try and not talk alot or lower your microphone's volume i really cant hear much from the game
Give a Token Of Fnaf Uplaoding awards to this guy who stayed at the game continuesly
Yeeeee
i’m so excited to see more!!!
Wow, that was insane. I guess this is probably the best ending? There's nothing stopping Cassie from taking the elevator now. Maybe she can even go back for Roxy! Just bring her home to her dad like, "Hey, Dad, I found a new big sister!"
Ture
😁😁😁
Apple
i think the suit the mimic was wearing was meant to resemble fredbear
Me and my  brothers have wanted security breach  for so long  now
Me and my  brothers have wanted security breach  for so long  now
Me and my  brothers have wanted security breach  for so long
SO GOOD
Me and my  brothers have wanted security breach  for so long
whatever you want x4
whatever you want
Wooooooo
Hi Hi
Matpat really has his work cut out for him on this one 😅
Try go to the left side of the mimic chase
8 hours to do all of this is crazy
I love security breach now thanks to you I love your content
Thank you for all your efforts to put everything of Ruin out as soon as possible!!!!
Love the video's and commitment

RUIN

hi
Entering
Hi
Fusion I want security breach Plz
Chicken nuggets

You should try and shoot glitch trap at gator golf
Ok wait pause why is he wearing a suit why hasn't fusion slept and how did any know how to get this ending so confusing but so cool at the same time thank you fusion!!!! 😁😁
I don’t know if there’s gonna be another ending, but this one takes the cake

This is existing
W fuziom
If you already don't know what for FNAF day is it's August 8 spread the word I love your content fusion
thats weird. when you did the ending you SPAWNED in the boss fight, i tried this and i didnt spawn IN the fight, i spawned at the normal location, and when you go down to "save Gregory" he has it on while roxy and the mimic fight.
Hi
What if that glitch trap is good?
lets go
Hey guys🎉
You are so good
Hi
Hi
Bro called the evil Gregory on the first ep
Bada Bada Bada elelel

I need security breach bc ruin is too cool
I love this series of the new game
Wow, i was not expecting that
Hi
Eu acho que aquele ano o esqueleto foi desmonte lado
I’m wondering how long it takes the mimic to put that suit on
Great vid bro!
You are CRAZY uploading all this… I LOVE it😂
Dang so many new things
Fusion do you remember that when you had to put the thing in Roxy's eye you could have clicked Esc that's what I saw.
Now the need to make fnaf  security breach grand re opening and cassie was trapped and thirteen years later she is free but evil and Gregory is good
we very grateful for you doing this!! I hit the like and subscribe button to win the sb game xbox
I wish you the best sleep ever!
Hi

SB
I wonder what you need at the beginning when it says equipment needed
more lore
sup
I’m glad to be entering this contest
I want to play the Fanf dlc 🐻🐤🐊🐺☀️🌚
Just bought the game can’t wait to beat it lol
This game is so amazing
E
How did you get the scooper ending? 😅
Bro I’ve figured out that the mimic could be Afton
Hi, my name is Sun and I'm a fan of you and Five Nights at Freddy's
w vids on the ruin dlc
Raaaach
I am loving the serious, I've been waiting for it to release for so long.
Are you getting sleep!?!?🤨
I love how Dedicated FusionZgamer Is to ruin. He's pumping these videos out one after another
he does all nighters for this i think it deserves a like
woag
meep
I like candy cadets story is actually a warning about mimic
Hi
Tht mimic has an glitchtrap suit
Love this!
Can't wait for the game
Yo I want to get the game
Can you have security breach on Xbox?
Matpat already knows about you
I love this series so much! But seriously dude, you need to get some sleep lol.
Man, I love this guy. He always makes me laugh.
Ye he really must like his subscribers
This is my second fav ending tbh
i am bawd at making comments
I love it
It's a fredbear costume
Please me ps4
hi, ive always wanted security breach.
Apparently mimic has two other outfits that are in the game! Not sure how but there’s screens out of them
This DLC is literally blowing it out of the water! Thanks for always being so dedicated in investing a lot of time to get us the content out so quickly
Ambassing
maybe afton created the mimic to lure kids in to kill before the original animatronics.
Man i love you
Yo, every time that a fnaf game comes  out  you’re my go to guy
Hi
The costume looks like it's a moldy  yellow and has Bear ears   Or it is the one where the employee has died in fredbears family dinner?🤔
lemme enter that
Thank you for your dedication to this game, getting all endings and playing through it all for all the fnaf community
hey look funny credits
hi
Idea:  Try looking around the room where the button is to see if you can find anything
its got to be the mimic right? bc idk what books but when he was k*lling the kids who broke in he put the suit on with the person inside if im right? the suit its wearing looks like theres someone inside
Managed to get the scooper ending was insanely hard to get all cams without changing chapters 😢
Lion mascot: yo let me in I’m definitely not the animatronic that was chasing you yo YO OPEN THE NOOR!, JUST OPEN TEH NOOR NO DNAG FU*K YOUUUuuuuuuu-~~
Bro just imagine how long he’s been playing this for now.
freddy fazballs
how far is  he willing to go for our entertainment?
I have a theory, If you collect Roxy eyes, idk how but maybe like a arcade machine, but you can give her the eyes and she can like take you out of the pizza plex kind of like eclipse so Gregory dose not kill you, or maybe you don’t deactivate her
These endings are AWESOME and you are the most entertaining fnaf youtuber
Monke
woohoo!!
If you look closely the mascot suit doesn't look like it has the mimic in it at the end
Couldn't play security breach because i dont have money but watching you play is like playing it myself
....... 7 dots for 7th part and i keep liking the parts to enter also i have been subscribed so yeah
I have no idea why he had that suit on, thats so weird.....
you are so cool
Hehe
I’m hoping this was not the last episode
Ruined
AAAAAAAA
Hi
well that is a "scoop"
Can I get one
The ending where "Gregory" drops the Elevator is the Bad Ending. There's the Good ending where you find him, Vannesa, and something else. Then you have this ending that you just did.
Wasssssssß no oœghQÆ
cant belive its been almost 2 years since the last fnaf  game
I am a small YouTuber if I win I will play on my channel it has always been my dream to get a play button
Ca can I get it?
can I be inred
ruin
Hello
Hii
I’m here once again
bro this guy is a legend
CyborgRaduYT
Big bigger fan
FusionZGamer IS EPIC
Let’s take this hard worker to 10M subscribers
Mimic=afton
This would be cool if it was multiplayer 😁
That is crazy
What is a mimic
Fusion you are the best fnaf YouTuber ever hopefully I get the dlc
I want the FNAF security breach pls man😢
Bros eyes are probably melting out his head
Let’s appreciate the fact that he hasn’t slept in 12 hours just so he can upload content for us!
I already prefer this ending! Can't wait to see what Chica's beak and maybe other pieces of animatronic we can find will do. Never read the books, can someone tell me in which order I should read them?
Pls give ruin I really want it
That suit reminds me of freadbear, using the the thumbnail as an example, it kinda has a freddy ear design on the top right of the head
Candy Cadet easily added +9 atmosphere
Ngl that one secret animatronic that has a suit sorta like irl animatronics looks like he’s from Chipper and sons lumber co
And was strange
This ending is just so cool
Hey fusion! Im so glad you are able to make these awesome videos for us, thanks man!
you have summoned matpat!
Just notice me
The amount of endings that are in this game is insane. How does fusion upload these so fast?
may i please have security Breach copy? keep up the great work!!
CAN I HAVE A COPY PLEASE PLEASE NOTICING MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSLWOSKWWSKWKISOWISO2ISKSISKWISJADJ3
Ruin is sooo much cooler ps thanks for your hard work and effort you put into your videos ❤
Seeing as the room Cassie went to is a dead end, I’d imagine she went back to the elevator and left with Gregory and Freddy, with the mimic nuetralized gregory would have no reason for gregory to betray her.
Hi
My man is the goat.
Roses Are Red, Violets Are Blue. People Need That Game, And I Do Too.
WHY AREN'T YOU NOTICING ME ME ME ME MEEEEEEEE
Why aren't you noticing me Why aren't you noticing me Why aren't you noticing me
Woooooo
Am I the only one confused with the monster in the chase scene? I don’t understand if it’s robot or not
Whatever you want
My theory is that the mimic knows about Cassidy a lot like Roxy, and the costume was something related to Cassies younger self or smth with her father
Hey fusion
The ending reminds me of poppy playtime chapter 2 when poppy get grabs by mommy long legs
a
What ever you want heheheh3he
Hi
Maybe you can repair the animatronics?
Mat pats gonna have a blast pulling theory’s out his ass
I would like to think that if you kill the mimic you could then go onto the elevator and Gregory would let you live. I know we can’t do that yet but that’s what I would like to think!
You are amazing for showing us this
Bread👍
I liked
Ngl the new suit kinda looks like a triceratops
stan loona
E
I dud it for the giveaways
I'm a huge fan a fan
Cassie could be the next Vanny
was up
Hiiii
Love the videos I wish I could buy the game
Yes
The scoper 2.0
This vid was kinda short then your other vids
Plz
The mascot would be a really good villain for a future game
This dlc is awesome
Glamroc bonny is in the bowling ally behind a hole in the wall surrounded by sign bots
Love your vids and love fanf keep up the amazing work!
THE BIG SCOOP
Hello
Security Breach RUIN
Omg my favorite thing on sister location the scooper
Cant wait to see what other secrets get dug up, don't forget to rest soon too Fusion, even if you don't want to!
i wish there was a good ending with roxy
Oooooooooo
What if you don't listen to gregory what he says to you
I'll do anything for copy of security breach
Roxanne is my favorite character in the game too im really sad that she dead 😢
Love you mineo's bro
🎉
Thank you fusion for the all the effort you put in your videos.
Does the uhh security breach offer apply for nintendo switch?? I dont own a computer or any ps btw love you dude
pretty interesting endings so far
Blip bloop blip
love your vids keep up the good work
Hmm nice
how do people find these things ???
bru the mimic in the fumnail be like " oPeN thE nOoR !!!
😍😍
I'm a huge Five Nights at Freddy's fan and i would like to get the game just to play the DLC and good job FuzionZgamer for finishing a game that just came out not a day ago
I really thought that was a mod XD
this dudes reactions are just prfect.
michael now cassie!?!
me is bob
fnaf has come a long way, and the hope of security breach and the ruin dlc not being the last game is amazing can yall imagine a life without any of the fnaf games being made?
ur mom
hi
That mascot outfit is gonna have some huge lore implications, can't wait for the Game Theory videos
No he visto todavía a nadie intentar usar los faz coins en los arcade glicheados de la guarderia, eso no revelaria un nuevo final o easter egg?
Uuuuhhh, I just want the game...
It's crazy how both endings end with a cliffhanger 🤔.
I wonder if hes wearing the suit in the cut scene
Yes
2:47 that's not glitchtrap idk why everyone keeps saying that, it's a secret security system specifically for the mimic and not the whole pizzaplex, You see the rabbit(M.X.E.S) active as soon as you start taking down the security nodes as the mimic posing as Gregory tells you to, why else would the mimic tell you to stay away from it if it wasn't designed to keep anyone from letting him free?, even if that means killing the person trying to set the mimic free at all cost just so he doesn't get out, so of course the mimic would tell cassie to stay away from it if that means keeping her alive long enough to free him from the sinkhole, even at the end of the game once the mimic is free guess what he trys to do to cassie?....that's right he trys to kill her, because her role is already over and he doesn't need her anymore so he trys to get rid of her
Get some sleep okay?
❤
Btw I liked and subbed
This has been so cool
This man spent 13 hours playing this game he deserves 10m subs. Not just that,he deserves some type of award for the amount of videos he’s posted
I have an iPad pro
Isn’t the scooper from sister location so technically it is canon
Hopeful to win the security breach game since it was my very first fnaf game I watched on YouTube and have been loving theorizing and reading the fnaf books as well! I'd also love to play security breach and the dlc!
I really want one. Please send me one Willy please.
bro i love these videos
I need pls
nice
i think that gregory didnt crash the elevator but the mimic hacked into the walkie talkie again and crashed the elevator and i think that because gregory has acces to only the map he cant manipulate stuff. he can only watch the map and cassie
THIS IS CRAZY?

"Whatever you want"
Wat ever I want  Can I get it now
Bruh
Fusion the arcade machine that gave chicas voice box was chica themed and back in one of your other parts you found a Monty themed arcade machine maybe Monty’s claws are a reward for that one and maybe there is a Roxanne themed one as well possibly a whole other ending
bro looks like a squirrel lowkey
I love you man
I know where to put chicas voicebox when she was deactivated in the bath room
._.
props to fusion for playing through the whole dlc including secret endings in under 24 hours
I'm on the weird side of the internet again
commitment is real
Hi there everybody who wanna watch fnaf ruin secret ending.
You deserve an award for how you just grind away on games cause as soon as a highly awaited game comes out you just don’t stop
I like how fast you talk man. Nice videos
Hi fusion so i was playing the ruin dlc and i found where bonnie was so basically you go to the very top right side of the bowling alley and go to that Yellow board where you can see a secret room and a bunch of the cleaning bots i think their called but i hope you get this message and have a good day ba bye!
Ah
It's not working 👎
Props to fusionZgamer cause he stayed up hours to make these videos and if I’m gonna watch the ruin dlc on any Channel it would be on fusion
There is a secret glamrock Bonnie room I'm Bonnie bowl and it's all the way in the right and there's a wet floor bot to activate the room
That mimic skin is creepy as hell
Cool
I was excited to see where we could use chickas beak and now I have to forget about it.
4:12 hey the little mop bots thingys if you deactivate them you get a secret room
Good luck everyone
you forgot something foxy their secret Grandma Bonnie in Bowling
Your videos are so funny
I love you so much right now for all these videos! BUT I NEED MORE!!!!
Milker
Hey fusion you missed a secret in bonnie bowling
Can you even get out the pizza Plex at the start and not save Gregory
Maybe try going in the first chapter and get the first jumpscare while you have the beak I wanna see what happens
i wan the game!!
Fusion my fave YouTuber you should try exiting the pizza plex right at the star and once you cheat I will give you a hint Bonnie bowling alley
There is one more ending which is you escaping the pizza plex
You're my favorite Fnaf content creator youtuber, because you are so fast at posting videos and it has such a good quality!
Always great to watch. ❤
Nice
Is it more endings
Inside bunny bowling you can find bonny surrounded by the wet bots.
Im impressed with the dlc although its a bit confusing for me 😅
Hello
True ending is so much sad I am disappointed by that ending but this ending looks way better
me still waiting for him to try and do something with the beek
I'm really enjoying this DLC so much omg, I'm pleasantly surprised how good it is.
Well that was an amazing ending!
I have an idea of an ending maybe when chica junpsacres u but deactivate try to put her voice box and see if it will put it❤
I wonder how many secret things are there out of bounds
Waiting for video from MatPat to explain what's happening in this dlc
Hey
FIRST EVER YOUTUBER POSTING 1-9 VIDEOS IN ONE DAY FIRST TIME EVER YOUTUBER I FOUND I LOVE IT I LIKE GET BORDED AFTER A VIDEO GETS FINISH
Your not done with the game yet there is the best ending which you can get when you enter the pizza plex by just leaving
Fusion to find bonnie you need to deativate all floor signs then go to bonnie bowl where that purple glow is will open
But the scooping room is in circus babies pizza?
Is it over
If you got chicas voice box from playing  that game would you get monty Claus fom playing monty golf
Fusion you can put her voice box back in when she deactivates!!!!
Cheese
Fusion, if you go up to Chica when she deactivates in the bathroom, you can put the voice box back in.
THERE IS ANOTHER ARCADE GAME IN MONTYS GOLF ! YOU CAN PLAY IT ASWELL
Gregory stinky
Go to where chica breaks and lays on the floor and give her her voice box it does something I think
wow
I do wear secret could be. What if you get Monty's golf with the least amount of hits as possible
I'm glad he slept after this one
I was hoping that the animatronic cod be fix. but I still love all of the work you do 👍👍
Whatever i want
If you go to chapter 7 while using the mask you can find a secret room where you can find Glamrock Bonnie
Am i the only guy who thinks the first ending is canon? Ik its bad ending but i think its a canon
in bonnie bowling in the bowling lanes there is a hole in one of them were you  can find bonnie and more of the little cleaning bots. if you did read this can you make a video on glamrock bonnie in bonnie bowling.
Incase you dont know, there is another ending, you can access it from the start of the game, all you need to do is to get out of the pizzaplex
You should get all the wet floor bots and then go bonny bowl. As i am writing this, i got to 5:49 and realised you already know
Hey I have an  idea when ur hacking Roxy while it hacking her it says escape wat if u try it
Remember the Monty Gator Golf video arcade game in Monty Gator Golf? You still have to play that
maybe because gregory and cassie are friends gregory calls her that in stead of cassidy and fredbear is possesed by cassidy meaning the fredber cut out is canon?
Love the videos
Hey
Pt8?
Apple
Hey fusion, just wanted to point out in bonnie bowl, there is a secret place behind a billboard with Bonnie inside of it. To find the room you need to deactivate of the wet floor signs around the map then look around bonnie bowl for a hidden room with purple light in it
Banana
I think i figured it out, if  you get the voicebox from chica next to chica lying in the bathroom, you should try to give it to here. Of thats not the case i dont know anymore.
Bro are you aware that you can try to repair chica now? Also Roxy is mvp imo And what about the other arcade games you got one but remember the monty golf?? Is there a Roxy one to repair her eyes??? Can you get freddy his head back???????  Don’t give up on these games yet bro
Hi i love your videos on your YouTube
So wait...do you have to play the game straight through, or can you just skip through the chapters?
when are you gonna use the beak?
Fusion If you go behind the wall in Bonnie Bowl, you can find a secret the opening is beside the bowling ball on the right side (I think it's the right side) there is also a cleaning bot you should see the opening when you get the cleaning bot
Do you know when she cries lying down in the bathroom? Maybe you can put her back on her then?
Fun Fact: You can find bonnie's body in a bonnie bowl after you deactivate one of the robots In the corner. 😢
could i get a steam copy
Fuzion needs to go beat the monty golf. And how he got the chica's voice box maybe if he beats monty golf he will get motnty's claws.
For a moment i thought the mimic was gonna get shot by a lazer
I love your videos and everything that you play
Whatever I want
does anyone notice freddy was damaged and gregory not in the pizzaplex? that means ruin never happened if gregorys was in the good ending glamrock freddy is damn damaged that means its the bad ending where freddy gets torn apart and vanny aswell
It isn't working
Hey someone just found bonnie body
what is this ting
Bruh
Hi fusion
Idk and why roxanne wolf is friendly
Thank you so much man. I really appreciate you doing all of this.
@FusionZGamer Have you thought about returning the Voice Box to its rightful Owner?
I don't know why I try knowing that doors won't open for me, I always have bad luck in this life ☹️😢
Hi
Yo FusionZGamer, they found Glamrock Bonnie in Bonnie bowl
Yooo the scooping room from Sister location
Im probably mad late but i kinda wanna see how it looks when the mimic tries to get cassie inside the elevator with the suit on.  Also what happens if you press exit when dissabling roxy when shes stuck under the forklifr.  ALSO try inserting chicas voice box when shes dissabled in one of the restrooms.
i never expected seeing the mimic in a mascot costume.
ATTENTION!! FUZION U CAN USE CHICAS BEAK AND PUT IT BACK ON HER, WHEN SHE SITS DOWN/DIES IN ROXY PARY IN THE BATHROOM U CAN PUT IT ON HER, PLEASE NOTICE!!!
Best endings
There is a Easter egg with glamrock bonnie in bonnie bowl you need to find all the pat pats
Please
Fusion I think u might find Bonnie on the floor behind a bowling place,in a secret room.I am not sure tho
good
fusenzgamer is a man thad does ent give up an telle it is dane
I SAW SOMEONE FIND BONNIE BUT HE WAS DESTROYED 😢
Fusion!! Heads up (havent watched this video yet) Glamrock Bonnie IS in this DLC!! NO SPOILERS JUST LOCATION- Hes where that large globe is at Bonnies Bowling. Theres a BIG yellow sign and a Large hole at the bottom right,Go through it,Theres a Creeperblock there and G.Bonnie is in the area!
i want fnaf security breach
Tip for the best ending go out through the broken glass window that you went through in the opening ending
FUSION, I HAVE NOTICED SOMETHING, when you're in the scene in which you have to deactivate Roxy, you can press esc, can you let us see what happens if you do so?
i cant wait for you to find all the arcade machines that gives back all the parts gregory stole from the animatronics and see cassie give them back for the best ending
I just won’t fnaf sb because my mom won’t buy it for me olso I love your vids
If You Follow Chica Where She Sat Down You Might Be Able To Give Her Voice Box Back
Why are all these endings so.. ...abrupt?
I'd love to play this if I owned it on PlayStation five
there is a bonnies room btw get 27 wet floor souls and deactivate then once complete in the corner of bowling u will see another deactivate that and go in to the small hole
I love it but what about chika
In part 6 you found chica's beck your probably can have a new ending by recovering every part of the animatronic and give it back to them ?
🎉grate vid i realy enjoyed  it
cant wait for the next episode but get a lot of sleep before recording said video
Yeah I know Jack crap about the lore but it's cool they had a scooping room. Also thank you so much as other people have said for staying up and giving us all this cool as heck content your a real trooper
really good video
we need to find out what happens if you get the other animatronics things and use them!!!
Your videos are so good!
Michael?? Because we know that in whatever FNAF game (i forgot) micheal was scooped and had his inards took out bye, baby anamtronic the same oerson who killed Illisabith.
In the room with the giant bowling ball secret hole there I think you should check it out. This comment is important. Read it now.
Theory: The actual good ending is when you finish ALL the character arcades - Monty's Golf Arcade - Chica's Lets Eat Arcade - (I dont know roxy's, but Im aware she has one  Somethung is telling me special cutscenes happen with them.                         Sorry if this was already explained
Finaly we Can Play this awsome game😅
ATTENTION!! FUZION GLAMROCK BONNIE CAN BE FOUND IN THE BOWLING ALLEY, AT THE BIG BOWLING BALL THE BUNNY ONE, NEXT TO THE CLEANING ROBOT THERE IS A HOLE NEXT TO IT WHERE THE PINS ARE PUT!!! PLEASE NOTICE THIS!!!
00:00:01
@Fusion Gamer  in Bonnie bowl hack behind the area right next to the big ball with purple lighting going in it  but you can't have the mask. hack behind the purple glow under one of them and you will see something. . . .>:) (Edit. It's fine if you put my comment if you do see this butt pls burr my name out) Thats all i know for now if i know more i will comment more cya
In chapter 7 you can find glamrock bonnie.I don't know you need to find all wet floor bot but, it suppose be in the corner..
I feel so bad for roxy tbh
Delma
"@williammiller6330" I agree with you completely
you sound alot like purplerodri (if you are mix pkmn with fnaf when you dont have anything to film)
Idk who's the character hes playing on, but im gonna play on my own to figure it out.
Fusion you should also try the gator golf mini game.
You didn’t play Monty gater golf
Im always so excited when a new fnaf game comes out!!!
And Freddy is headless so that’s how you got Chickas     voice box so there is Monty’s claws and Roxy’s eyes
CAN YOU PLS MAKE A VIDEO WHERE YOU PRESS NO PLSSS
thank goodness for fusion and all his fnaf videos that he always rushes through to get it out for us.
Bonnie is in Bonnie bowling  deactivate all the robots and go to Bonnie bowling and he will be behind one or the bowling lanes
Monty golf mini game is there but you didn’t play it
What about deactivating all the map bots? Maybe thats also an ending
hello
Fusion is quite litterally the best fnaf YouTuber right now like the game came out Afew hours ago and bro has already played the entire thing
What if  glitch trap is trying to stop you because he knows it’s the mimic
Hint: you can found glamrock Bonnie
Matpat was kinda on point with his recent theory
The suit kinda looks like a wolf or something.
Love it soo wanna play favorit fnaf game
I love how you are doing all this
hello ,ruin is such a cool game.
fusion i have a theory that when the robot(gregory) gets chased by roxy when first enconterd cassidy says that roxy is going for him. the robot's response is "I found a place to hide" and in the hidden ending where you use the mask on the freddy cutout what does cassidy say "i found a place to hide" i think that in that ending the mimic caught cassidy and is trying to lure gregory to him.
Oml. A round of applause for Fusion and Dawko. These two deserve all of the support for all the content they’ve delievered.
Watched the entire parts and noticed on how gregory tells cassie that his friend had schematics of place is abit odd cos the afton ending is cannon and the cutscene of where both freddy n Gregory are running to the lift makes no sense if they did get out alive how is Gregory telling cassie in the lift that she was never ment to come to the pizzaplex at all in my own theory is that the mimic knows Gregory and freddy are out of the pizzaplex and when he says to cassie that hes not in the pizzaplex and hes been trying to get in touch with her all night must mean the mimic is blocking radio contact from greg to cassie and also the rockstar freddy model isnt the same freddy we know as the on in security breach doesnt have prototype on his right foot as in security breach you can see when hes running theres nothing their so something isnt right both the vanny & afton endings happend but freddy died in vanny ending but runs away in the afton ending hmm there is definitely more dlc coming to the game theres gotta be more to this than we think
It might be me but what if that bunny that was chasing you tried to stop you from letting the mimic free think about it he kept trying to stop us so what if
TO DAY POPPYPLAYTIME Teaser trailer is coming out
This game was a blast fr
i did this ending first and then realized i cant do the others now :(
It’s been 18 hours since this video I must know when the next is coming
i was really not expecting to be making so many videos on the dlc and so fast also that mimic suit is pretty cool
Wait what if that's the first model of fredbear but the suit is all torn up?
I relly whant to play fnaf security breach but hopefully I win five away don’t have fnaf !!! I NEED IT!!!! 😢😢😢😢
Maybe a ending is where u beat all the arcade games and maybe u will get all of their broken parts?
can i please have ruin i liked the video and i already have been subscribed for a long time
I liked all videos of ruin
Hey Fusion, you should DEFINETLY try to find Roxy's Eyes or Monty's legs (preferably roxy). You could probably fix all of them, and undo what gregory has done. Also, you should listen to the entirety of Roxy's 'speech', maybe you DONT have you deactivate her?
OK this might sound crazy but, what if there were more animatronic parts. Like how when you played the Chica mini game and got her voice box, what if there were more arcade games like monty gator golf and if you complete them you would get all the parts.
Hey did you know you know you missed Bonnie i think he is in bonnie bowl but im not sure
By the news paper where you enter from
Bro I think if you deactivated all of the robots you find bonnie ded on the floor and it's just so sad to see 😇🥲🥲
Hi
if you defeated it its probably dead and when cassie goes to the elevator after gregory doesnt drop the elevator down
Oh hey Fusion if you get the chance to go back to the chapter where Roxy has to be deactivated but don't deactivate her just listen to everything she says to Cassie it's pretty interesting & sad
I need more
More
At the start turn around and crouch then jump twice and you will get the leave the pizza plex trust me pls and comment back 😢
When the mimic appears for the first time saying "im gregory" can you check if the mimic still had that suit or does it only use it chases you??
hello
Hey fusion you know Chicas voice box you know the Spot she lies in the toilet you can fix’s her if you go to her trust me :)
Im so glad i can count on fusion for any fnaf stuff. Also the suit kinda looks like a loin to me. I see a mane
Hi
SUCH A GOOD YOUTUBER
10:50 gonna eat while watching
Well the mimic had the suit the whole time in chapter 8
In bonnie bowl, nearby the bowling area theres a hole if you enter that you can find glamrock bonnie laying on the ground circled with cleaning bots you can deactivate.
You have to Go back to bonnie Bowling and Explorer a Littel more there is something you missed
Hi you are one of my favorite YouTuber
Hi 🎉
This man is really trying to make his videos to look better and better just for us to enjoy watch,you are a legend man keep on good work,just like scoot you made a half ofy childhood❤❤
Can we have a moment of silence to appreciate the fact this man has lost sleep to record this for us. And now he is giving the game away I hope I get it but I do not really mind
Whoo hoo
e
e
e
e
e
what other games does fusion play cause i only mainly watch his fnaf videos on either real fnaf games or fan fnaf games
Sooo cool
Did you see the child head i think this is Cassidy
Don’t get me Wrong but have you tried putting chicks voice box inside her like in the scene when you find her knocked out in the bathroom 😮
You miss someting in Bonnie bowl we actually found him
This endding in fact this WHOLE GAME just blows my mind because there's so many questions than answers I can't wait to see that ee you found I'm dieing to know
Who else wants another ending 😂
ngl i wish the bonnie secrets were in this vid
FUSION!! did you know that in bonnie bowl next to the bowling alley there is a Glamrock Bonnie!  He will be next to the litlle robots you deactivated. the yellow cleaning thingies.
Hey uh. Fusionzgamer. U missed something in the bowling alley it in a secret room somewhere. So look all around it even at the stairs and at the end of the stairs and all around the bowling alley.
Hi
man the first ending was reallly sad gregory left cassie
YouTube must not like you because I thought I was subscribed but no
I got no time I got no time to live I got no time to live And I can't say goodbye And I'm regretting having memories Of my friends who they used to be Beside me before they left me to die And I know this is I know this is the truth 'Cause I've been staring at my death so many times These scary monsters roaming in the halls I wish I could just block the doors And stay in bed until the clock will chime So my flashlight's on, and stay up 'til dawn I got this headache and my life's on the line I felt like I won, but I wasn't done The nightmare repeats itself every time Got to keep my calm, and carry on Stay awake until the sun will shine But I'm not so strong, and they're not gone They're still out there to take what's left of mine I have this urge I have this urge to kill I have this urge to kill and show that I'm alive I'm getting sick from these apologies From people with priorities That their life matters so much more than mine But I'm stuttering I'm stuttering again No one will listen and no one will understand Because I'm crying as much as I speak 'Cause no one likes me when I shriek Want to go back to when it all began So my flashlight's on, and stay up 'til dawn I got this headache and my life's on the line I felt like I won, but I wasn't done The nightmare repeats itself every time Got to keep my calm, and carry on Stay awake until the sun will shine But I'm not so strong, and they're not gone They're still out there to take what's left of mine
Fusion at the end when you are at the computer select no that will probably be a another ending
WOOOW just wow ur da legend
In the first ending where cassia fall in the elevator u can hear roxy say cassie s name
Hi there 😊
Bro you have season 8 to
Plæ
So far the best fnaf youtuber.
Do you know that you can give back chica beak when she set down
I wanna know so badly where his suit is from and what it's name is. My curiosity is killing me. I wonder what Matt will say in his next theory.
Bro youre actually the reason i smile can i please have a copy of the game i would love to play it and make videos
I love watching your YouTube videos and watching you play fnaf security breach
u can repair all animatronics
Fusion there is a secret place where Bonnie is dead on the floor. The yt that found it was HorrorScoped!
This is why Fusion is a legend
You were right about the cleaning bots bro you can find bonnie in a secret room if you can deactivate them all there is a secret room and thats probably what you are talking about about the video with more secrets in it  i cant wait
SHE*
WHEN HE DEACTIVATES
FUSION U CAN PUT CHICAS VOICEBOX IN HER
xbox please
Man, uploading such good Quality videos un a short lapse of time is something we should  admire.Keep it up man
I think when china powers down, you can actually repair her
🎉🎉
secret
Good Job Fusion Also The Suit Has A Bowtie On The Head My Guess Its A Springlock Suit Or A Prototype Of Circus Baby
Gg
Hey I found out what chicas voice box does you remember when Chica deactivated well you can repair it also in Bonnie bowl glam rock Bonnie is there
I want fnaf security breach on Xbox but it is  Expensive
Bro when I die get sent to before the star of the reboot sun mission is my save glitched or corrupted?
When chica deactivates in the bathroom you can Repair her voice box
Props to this guy for being so good at this game
Sorry for rickrolled you 8 year ago 😢.
the suit is actually on when you break the concrete if you go back that far.
Sick
This man stays up doesn’t eat or sleep just for these beautiful videos 😊
fusion i know were bonnie is hes in bonnie bowl in side the glowing thing that you put a bowling ball in but you need to have  the hack thing or i think its one of the doors that you opened to get the mimic coustume🐰🐇
Was this the last one
please tell me if you can collect the parts for the animatronics you can repair Roxy that would suck if you cant
I love how fusion gives up his sleep and free time just to make us the best videos❤
I hate that an antagonist of ruin is q confirmed Book thing. Im not sure if Remnant was from books, but even if it is, Remnant felt natural and didnt change the entire story. Mimic just decided to go in and say "i slept with your mom" just to destroy everyone's outlook on this story. Come on.
a comment
THE SCOOPER!
I wont say much but a very very special rabbit is in this game. now how are you going to find him well those wet floor sign animatronics do have a use. Oh and by the way his fan design did get somethings right.
hi I liked and subscibed
I love how Fusion takes all nighters to a whole other level and how he goes BIG BRAIN in FNAF games, like Ruin, to find secrets and different endings. That ending really does remind me of the scooping room.
behind bonnie bowl bonnies body is actually surrounded by the little yellow bots
Will there be more ruin chapters
❤
Hi
part 8???????
The suit was so cool but also looked goofy, it was funny when it just stood there.
If you haven't already you should put chicas voice box in her. In the spot where she jumpscares you at the start
hoi i want fnaf sb
This man is a legend!!!
Bro is on a rambage
I left a short comment every part for no reason at all
Hi😊
I hope there is an another ending that we didnt discover
Of you see this glamrock bonnie can be found by hacking outside the bonnie boul in a room
I think glamrock bonnie is in a room out of bounds in the bonnie bowling room
Glamrock Bonnie is death from secret place in fnaf Security Beach Ruin
Did u know that u can find bonnie he is in the real game but I don’t know where but u can find him
if you finish the gosf minigame you get montys claws
I unlocked this ending accidentally and I didn't know what to think until i watched this video.
yo
Leaving a comment saying whatever i want😂
Go to bonnie bow bonnie is in a Secret room
NOTICE ME
Someone found bonnie in bonnie ball behind the senses 😮😮😮😮
You take the voice box chica’s body when she deactivates in the bathroom
You can fix Chickaa when she was deactivated in the toilet with her voice box
The mimic is AFTON
J
The tiger guy gotta be a human
The suit looks like tiger rock from the last book
Wow this was a perfection game DLC!!!
You can actually find Glamrock Bonnie in ruin, and there’s a theory that he’s using the cleaning bots to watch us because his eyes are glowing, but if you power all of the cleaning bots off and go to find Bonnie, his eyes will be normal
Hi
The costume the mimic is actual a stitched together costume of a lion, elephant and bird costume
Maybe you can try going to Bonnie's area then u will see a vent u can enter it and then u will find glamrock bonnie laying there destroyed
I don't think the wet floor bots like him any more😂
I like peanut butter
Gotta say this man's videos have been keeping me happy for years and he's gotta be the most dedicated youtuber I've ever seen
there is probably an ending where jou go play all the arcade machines and get all of the animatronic parts an then give them back to them
What ever you want
Dude has insane upload speed
deez bugs
Man, that guy is dead
We found. Glamrock bonnie, or what’s left of him
I think that the Candy Cadet story is obviously about the Mimic, but the details about the mother and son living in a log cabin (we start out in a log cabin in FNAF 6) AND the mother locks the monster in the basement (we find the mimic under the FNAF 6 location) i think the mother and son in the story might be Charlie's Brother Sammy, and Henry's wife
Fusion you definitely got to deactivate those wet floor sign bots in all chapters apparently the is a secret about a certain bunny you just got to see
You can repare chica
@fusionzgamer i just want to thank you for getting me through covid 2 years ago when security breach first came out. That's where i first found your channel and gave been subscribed ever since. I enjoy the videos you put out and can't wait to see what you do in the future!!!
PLEASE LISTEN U CAN FIND DESTROYED BONNIE IN BOWL IF U DEACTIVATE A CLEANER BOT NEAR A SIGN AND THE SIGN WILL OPEN GO THOUGH AND U WILL FIND DEAD BONNIE
Hey fuzion did you find Bonnie he is in ruin
You can give the voice box when she's in the bathroom laying down
security breach
FUZION GUESS WHAT, IN ONE OF CHICAS BATHROOMS  THERES A VENT THROUGH THIS MAZE TYPE THING AND YOU PLAY A GAME AND UNLOCK CHICAS VOICE BOX
I like your video 🎉🎉🎉
Lol man monk boy
Love your fnaf content fusion keep up the good work
hey for anyone who would like to know easter eggs ,at the start of the game in the little shop u go to after u get your flashlight ,on the white screened tv u can see for a milisecond shadow bonnie
Hi
I watch you first when new fnaf games come out because you play for hours and i love watching your videos and finding easter eggs
Hey fusion, I think I found a secret that I believe some of us may know. If you deactivate all the wet floor signs as your go thru the game. A secret pops out and show something sinister. U should totally see it!!!
Please can I get FNAF SB I am broke but I want to play it soooo much
Fusion I don't know if you found this But there is a cool secret in bonnie bowl
You have to bring the voice box to chica when she's inactive
We Find Bonnie destroyed in ruin
Honestly, its good to see fusion stil doing binges like these  It brings me back to when SB first dropped and he uploaded the game in a full playthrough before anyone else.  And watching these episodes to see his raw reactions it feels like your right there playing with em, hopefully in the future we will see this with some other games, keep up the good work fusion👍
Hey fusion, I love your videos sm they entertain me a lot. This is my first time writing a comment on one of your videos and the voice box you received from the arcade game you can repair it back to chica when she's laying down in the bathroom, I'm not sure what chapter that is but that's all I know from her. Also I don't know where exactly but you can actually find Bonnie the animatronic in this game I think! Just letting you know, thanks for entertaining me a lot fusion, love ya
hi! lub the vid :)
This has been the CRAZIEST ride from beginning to end oh my *GOD*
Take the voicebox where chica deactivated in the bathroom and you can connect the voice box back into her mouth
Fusion if you give chica her voice box when she’s laying down in the bathroom it dose something  And if you deactivate 27 wet floor bots and go to Bonnie bowl on the far left bowling lane there’s a wet floor bot if you deactivate that a secret door next to it open and you can see the broken glamrock Bonnie animatronic
There is still a lot of secrets(and possibly endings?)
If you look under Freddy's feet you find Freddy a pro.otye
hey little tip when you are in roxy's saloon where chica is in the toilet if you have the voice box you can interact with her
I love to watch your video
Hey fusion, you missed a back room at Bonnie bowl and had Bonnie’s body there, I think you missed that section of the game. 🦾
maybe that "glitchtrap" is actually a type of security to keep the Mimic inside of its "residence"
What would happen if you go left instead of right at the first part
That’s were Bonnie is
Bro go to Bonnie’s bowling and go behind the bowling pins
@FusionZGamer  what if you could use the chica voice box on her when she was deactivated?
If you didn’t know Bonnie actually appears in the DLC broken with a wet floor sign bot next to it
i liked and subscribed to you, can i have free copy?
@FusionZGamer there is secret room in bonnie bowl and bonnie is there
I just went through the game and I found glam rock Bonnie you have to find all the wet floor bots and then you go to Bonnie’s bowling ally then you put on the mask
what ever you want
just finished binging all 7 parts😅
I love and appreciate all the effort fusion puts into his videos staying up late to release some good content for us let’s appreciate that and I’ve enjoyed the ride this game was amazing!!
Can you get to sun stage
This was insane, been watching your videos forever so I am very grateful that you were able to upload these videos not just fast, but insanely well done as well
What about if you press no?
yoooo!
After I finished my playthrough after the credits rolled i got roxy saying "cassie". I deactivated the cleaning robots when wearing the mask
I did it
Bonnies in the game
DLC
Did you know that you can put chicas beak when shes deactivate in the bathroom if find all of the missing items for the animatronics it may unlock a new ending.
Respect for this dudes insane tenacity.
Fusion! You can find Glamrock Bonnie behind one of the alleys in Bonnie Bowl. He's surrounded by some wet floor sign bots and is completely destroyed
I'm excited for more!
2 possibilities to who William afton is in the game The mimic The shadow thingy
my guy, you are amazing
I just found out you can so please give it a try
Hi
all the dlc in one day wow this is something
THE MIMIC (i said whatever i want)
True
Matpats head is gonna be spinning with this one
As much as i know you can find bonnie in bonnie bowl
Dlc
Hey FuzionZGamer I was just watching MatPat and he mentioned a character or something called Tiger Rock. The mimics suit sort of looked like a tiger.
nice keep go
With the voicebox if u go back to roxys raceway and find chica deactivated you can actually reboot her and fix her with the voicebox
Bonnie is  in a hidden room in Bonnie bowl
Bro I really want this game 😂
6:29 this was in tales of the pizzaplex it’s the mimic’s suit omg
The Story that the robot Was telling was about the mimic it said the mother aka Roxy locked the monster aka the mimic in the basement
What you do with chicas voice box is that whenever chica is messed up in the bathroom you can put the voice box back in her.
Fusion I love you bro you make me happy and the fact you stayed up All night js for us means your very dedicated in your job
u can use chikas voice box ochika idk when but when she lays down some where
Glamrock bonnie is behind bonnie bowl
FUZION YOU MISSED SOMETHING IN THE GAME
E
Security
Please hack around after you discover all the endings🙏🙏🙏🙏
I’m liked and I’ve been subbed since 100k keep up the good work
I love your videos I dont what the game I dont have the right consol
Get this man some sleep bro 💀
Hey um fusion maybe try and giving chica her voice box back!
I bet you, there’s gonna be so many people entering the game at the same time it’s gonna crash every server
GUYS PART 8 IS COMIN OUTT
Fusion if you go to Bonnie’s bowling there is a hole I. The wall next to the big bowling ball where you see Bonnie.
Do you guys think that if we complete all games and give all the animatronics there stuff back they can team up with us and kill the mimic ?
HEAR ME OUT! M.X.E.S. Mimic (E)Xterior Entrapment Security, like making sure no one tries to turn off security around the mimic like the warden of it. Another one could be Mimic (E)Xtraction of Endoskeleton Security/System, like it stops someone from extracting the mimic from the pizzaplex (letting it loose).
hi
What about bonnie there was an easter egg on bonnie golf one of the door u go inside it and u find bonnies body surrounded by those clean bots
This game is really cool. Can't wait for matpat to cover all of the lore.
I want to act in fnaf 😢
In ur vids u look at everything and cover it, so we don't have to watch videos to explain it.
IF FOUND BONYE, HE IS HIDDING IN A VENT IN THE BOWLING ALLEY
Seriously need to give this man the world! Tysm Fusion you’re truly amazing for doing this !! Keep up the amazing work!  This DLC is soooo so cool I cannot wait to be able to play it myself one day 😊❤!!
Gamroc Bonnie is in the game bonnie’s bowling  area ruin
I hope my yippees work it’s almost my birthday 🥳 2 more days🎉
Bro I really thought the mimic was doing the Peter Griffin death pose ☠️
Fusion has got that dawg in him
yo fusion glamrock bonnies body is in the game im not joking so you want to go in bonnie bowl go to the big bowling balll go to the right side and there should be a sigh but if you look under there is a tunnle but i think you have to do somthing in the game to open the tunnle and you go thru the tunnle you should find glamrock bonnies body
WHAT is that costume...
A new Xbox
slay
FUSION, GLAM ROCK BONNIE IS IN THE GAME IN BONNIE BOUL, PLS GO VISIT HIM not clickbait, there might be a way to get to him without hacks but but he is in their
for another ending maybe try do the other ending with the mascot
If you go in bunny's bowling ally you can find bunny behind one of the side where the pins ar no joke
ur my fav youtuber
His videos always make me smile
Fusion if you want to find secrets its not a ending but you can find bonnie in the bowling area I think its at the right side and there is a wall and you can go inside also the Monty ride tells a story about  Monty not destroying bonnie
I've been waiting forever for him to start playing this
I'm confused about HELPI is he evil or not
Hi well I just wanted you to know you can find Bonnie in the bowling alley and two caution robots he’s in a room behind one of the allies
So if chicas game gave her voice box and I'll Monty's give you claws and is ther another for Roxanne to get her eyes   Can you potentially fix them
I've liked every single part until now and I have been subscribed since 2022, and I love your content. I would enjoy a.copy of the game or atleats a response from the man himself
I love how dedicated you are for this game
I know where Rockstar Bonnie body is at
This dlc is so cool
This has been amazing
You blasted through this, Bonnie’s animatronic is hidden somewhere I saw! You should look for it
you can give chica back the voice box you found, after chica gets knocked out in the restroom
If you go to Bonnie Bowl and put on the mask there is a wall you can go through and inside that wall there is a special someone. Go and take a look
Yo wassup
what is the whole lore of ruins
Fuzion did tou know that in bonnie bowling is glamrock bonnie
I would just like to say that and Monty gater golf there was an arcade game that he/you started playing so he/you could get a piece of monty just like he/you did chica. Also roxy said give me back my eyes possibly meaning that there's a way to get her eyes back maybe another hidden arcade game
I don't know if you're going to see this or not but what about chicas voice box if you remember in one of your videos she gets deactivated when she goes to the restroom why don't you try going up to her with that voice box and seeing if you can attach it to her
I see a video somebody found Glamrock Bonnie
waaaait!  Freddy in ruin (as fusion said) IS an prototype! I matched the legs of the freddy in Ruin and In Security Breach (from online pics) and the feet don't match!
So im thinking that's just a new ending
What is that thing
gime the gammeeee
“Chicken is love, Chicken, is life, without ranch, it has lost, with Captain Crunch, I lose my mind”   (Mr.clean, 2057)
Can I please get sucerity breach on PS4
bread
Philly cheesesteak
I'm bummed that it's not on Xbox one
The only way to access the room Bonnie is in his to deactivate all the wet floor signs and then behind a weird hologram in Bonnie bowl. There’s purple behind it and to unlock it like I said, deactivate the wet floor signs.
give this man an award for making this gameplay for all of us wow
Fusion there’s a room in the Bonnie bowl section and Bonnie is in there
Yoo fusion I’ve been watching you for I wanna say 5-6 years now I was just wondering if I could get a nice budget gaming pc so I can get started making my YouTube channel
You should put the voice box you found back into chica when she sits in the washroom.
I want the Game so I can make a series out of and I’m asking bc I have no money to Buy the game. And I Play on PS4
Security breach please
I watched all of these in the same day and it was awsome
iv been waiting for far to long
THE AMOUNT OF TIME U SPENT ON THESE THANK YOU 🙏
Good morning or night
This game is perfect ❤
this dlc is absolutely phenomenal!!!
in the next video can you try to find bonnie i think hes at bonnie bowling and also repair the animatronics and also roxy had stuff to say before you take the last note that was roxy
🔥🥐🥖🇫🇷
How many endings do you think there is?
Fusion Z gamer we have a letter for you
I think Roxy chica and Monty have games and you can fix them
Thanks Fusion for uploading the  whole DLC in one day take that well  deserve rest Man
i just saw that apparently glamrock bonnie is in the game
bro has inside sources
Crazy how much is in this dlc.
Hey fusion gamer I saw a video about galmrock Bonnie here’s the video https://youtu.be/XNnD9IiGTdQ
Btw my thing is when you got that chica voice box maybe go back to the broken chica laying on the floor in the bathroom and put chica’s voice box back in and maybe something will happen
Плетени дюфа наклон please
Fusion gamer at Bonnie bowl if you put the vanny mask on  a secret where the bowling pins are supposed to be
Yo keep making for plz
I think it’s the tiger guy from the 8:53 comics
Just finished watching the video, man was this game a ride. While I do find the endings confusing it overall was a great game, definitely worth the time.
❤❤
I really want a copy but good luck to all of you
you should try to complete the gater golf arcade game to see if you get monty's claws like how you got chica's beak when you beat the chica minigame
Please
This mimic be like “I gotta look nice before I bludgeon this girl”
Hey Bonnie is in the game but in a room in Bonnie ƁŒ)ÆƏ
Dang bro! (Also hoping to get the copy of the game!) I appreciate thatyou played it NON STOP since yesterday!
So all the cameras were on odd numbers so my guess is that all the even numbers have arcade games and led to a chapter ten maybe idk, or you get the parts for all three characters and something happens in chapter eight
Hi
I saw game theory first and when he said the dlc was out I watch gt than went straight to fusion and just finished all fusion videos
FusionZ you need to get some sleep
yo sb good when this man plays it
hey fusion can i get a shout out also i wanted to tell you the reason gregory said to shut down roxy was prob because as you said the mimic copied gregory voice and since also what you said roxy and the mimic fought eachother  the mimic probably said that because it wanted revenge on roxy pov:just now finding out about this
You are my favorite fanf YouTube 😊😊😊😊😊
Um i don’t wanna just bother but could i get a copy for PlayStation. Please 😊
Horoscope found  bonne
How do I download this on Xbox?

i want to know if there is bonney
Fuzion I know It's probably late there bur I know a secret you can fine. Go into Bonnie Bowl and in the far right in the back where the lanes end if you put on the Vanni mask, you can find a hole in the wall where the pin are restocked. And In the hole you will find more of those small yellow animatronics that sound like their crying. And you will find someone everyone been wanting to see in the game.
When in the secret daycare room after deactivating the pat pat look up with the V.A.N.N.I. mask
Glamrock Bonny is in the game you just need to look harder
I want to know how many more endings there are
I love the video
Hi
Nice
What happens if you give Chivas beak and what happens if you press esc when deactivating roxy
IT'S THE MONSTER IN THE WOODS I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA SAY A BACKSTORY OR PAST
hi
Hi
w
The whole crew
I love you videos
Hey take the voice box to chica when she power down in the bathroom and see if anything happens
Try going through the gator golf arcade machine, the chica one was an old unused game, and gator golf had unused levels, plus, if you got chica's beak from her game, maybe you get montie's claws from his?
I love watching your vids and I have been in love with the FNAF games for a long time now! I was gonna buy sb for my PlayStation but I didn’t bc I was stopid 😅…  I have so much fun watching you!
hi
Hey fusion if you use the mask at the chase when ur with Freddy and use the vanny mask go to where chica is and use her voice box I hope u find this fr
On my way to go binge read the books to try and figure out whats going on with these endings
Do dj
fusion you can find glamrock bonnie's body in bonnies bowling area !!  there should be a hole in the wall in bonnies bowling area it should be right next to one of the bowling allys  also to access the area you would have to find one of the little caution bots and deactivate it
When’s number 8 coming
I gotta say I’ve watched the whole dlc in a couple hours because of your dedication thank you
Fuzion, there is a secret in bonnie bowling in order to acess it you have to deactivate every wet sign robot. Then one will pop up infront of a glamrock freddy in bonnie bowling. Deactivate it to unlock the secret.
pls copy
Yo fusionzgamer you can actually find glamerock Bonnie in his bowl alley
What if you took Chica’s voicebox back to her?
thanks bro but will this ending work on console cause you say to click it on the bottem and idk if you can do that on console
W
Glam rock Bonnie is in the game
This dlc is amazing
We appreciate you
Try using Chica voice box on her
That robot you had seen go after you looks to be a robot i think i know it is a real robot from the ( rock-afire  explosion ) an old robot band from 1980 - 1987
Hey Fusion! I dont know if anything important changes but from the intro of AstralSpiff's newest vid, you can put the chica voice box that you got into the chica that you see decommissioned (In the bathroom). Idk if this changes anything, maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. I am really unsure, but just try it and see what happens
Actualy it would make sence that Mimic would put on a suit beafore he chases Cassy because he is replicating the behaviour of William Afton.
The determination to finish this all in one go is baffling
Legit, had my inner child self come back to me. Before watching fnaf playthroughs again, just brought me back to the good old days of the 2010's
POV. Wen i see bonnie, hou hou houhou hou hou houhouhouhou hou hou houhou hou hou hou hou😱
No way any of this were canon 🤨 what happened to Afton? And his did Greg even know Cassie was in the Plex if he wasn't in there? Why was the mimic calling her specifically to help him? How long has it been since the place shut down? Where's Vanessa? Why is Roxy of all people keeping the mimic away? Where is the blob?
I love your vids so much
that is not glitch trap its the security system trying to stop u from freeing mimic
Poyo the second
FUSION Z I NEED MORE CONTENT YOU ARE MY FAVORITE FNAF YT I NEED MORE I CANT WATCH ANYBODY ELSE OR ILL THROW UP
Man this ending is sick
theres a low chance  you will see this but when you hack the game go to bonnie bowling and in a hidden area u can find his body
I am a big fan and I your vid are amazing and cheer me up
try to give Chica's voice box back
W fusion Chain
Wait wait! I saw a video of the game and Bonnie is actually in it! I don’t know where but Bonnie is in the game
This looks so fun
I Love your videos
A truly amazing sequel
FusionZGamer I want to tell u that u can find Bonnie in the bowling alley and can I get a copy of the game but that’s up to u if u want
Another ending you can get is a ending where you escape, you have to jump on the boxes and try to jump while sprint is on and make it out and walk down some stairs and boom credits pop up, sadly no cutscene tho
You know how u got chica’s beck maybe the Monty golf mini game gives u Monty’s claws and ,what if there is a Roxy mini game to get her eyes
Plz gove me sb lol
moo
E
Fusion, there’s a glam rock Bonnie in the game which is a secret and you can actually fix glam rock chica’s voicebox
you should have did a live playing the game
Gregory has Freddy So now Cassie has Roxy
Maybe you can give the voice box back? But I don’t see how you could.
There is an ending if you just leave the pizza Plex at the beginning
And you can give chicas beak to chica
Hey I was scrolling on tiktok and someone found Bonnie and he was talking I don’t know how they did it but it was not a mod either
FusionZ if your gonna go back to find all the wet floor bots there are four in bonnie bowl watch horrorscoped latested video for details unless you already know about it nvm 😂
I want that copy😊
I think Cassie survived the elevator crash, and that Gregory isn't the one who broke the elevator
No-one's mom
So much detail into this dlc. Its actually amazing. Its likw a mini game inside the game
yo i really appreciate you for doing this honestly bro you so cool man
love your videos they are very exciting and when im mad i watch them and im happy now
In security breach ruin video part 3 3:59 it predicted headless freddy
I would love to play ruin and the main game but my luck is trash lol I never win but I hope all the people who win have fun with there game
Love these videos keep up the good work
Wait I found that first one by accident when I first started I haven’t even got the first ending ye
We need more rahhhhhhhh, but like SLEEP!
we spent over a yaer waiting for this and its over so soon, I loved the story and design though! Now we wait for Markiplier hehe..
Bonnie is in ruin he is out of bounds tho
the amazing scarier FNaF Security Breach, if i were to have this game, i wouldn't make it past Monty at the beginning of this game EDIT: When i first saw the mimics suit, i thought it was Eclipse
True he dose
You can see glamrock bonnie in the game, idk where tho
"Whatever you want"😁
Zamn
W
that mimic costume is definitely a lion.Maybe the prototype before fnaf was a thing.
Bro just speedran the entire dlc in ONE NIGHT. He pulled a FNaF 12 to 6!
You are my favorite YouTuber I LOVE YOU I've been watching you since I was keep up the videos👍
Pizza
Fusion go to the part in chicas area were shes in the bathroom powered off you can interact with chica with her voice box
This is really fun!
after the first cutsean you can jump through the window try it please
bro deserves a medal and a award
Anything you want
nice
There is a secret Bonnie place in the bowing place
Hey bro can you make other video where bonnie is in this game, he in bonnie bowl, behind the Balling pin area that has a pink light, you need to deactive all the clean bot,bye
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
GLAMROCK BONNIE IS IN BONNIE BOWL BEHIND THE ALLEYS OF THE BOWLING PIN AND BOWLING BALL AREA
Try too look in the scooper room
Hi fusion i was hoping to win the security breach copy i was wondering if your also doing copys for Nintendo switch
Bet
I have a idea with the voice box go to where we see Roxy and try to get the cart off or put on the mask and try
Ik what to do with chicas voice box
Can’t wait for the next video
I NEED MORE
On the freddy part in fazer blast before freddy activates you cab see prototype on the back of his foot
You can use chica’s voice box when she deactivate in the bathroom
Disable all of the wet floor signs, apparently it unlocks something in bonnie bowl.
More videos please
Fusion the glitch bonnie is not glamrock bonnie bonnie's body is at bonnie bowl behind one of the wall that shows freddy's face You may need to delete the wall or go through it
i know where bonie is
I've been binging all of fusion's ruin videos I am so excited to see more secrets. I wish I could win security breach to play it but I'm on console 😭
Fusion please hack the bonni bowl  there's something there
This guy deserves an Oscar for beating RUIN in 8 parts
Please get some good rest fusion, you earned it.
This man is  A GODDDDDDD❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I feel like this is a reference to Michael getting scooped
But my theory is that William Afton is the only big bad in Five Nights At Freddy's and perhaps there could be another evil person or being that we need to worry about aside from him.
Hi the short wars is just a prank
I needed to see this. I knew with how the other endings ended, there had to be more to this.
Bro fusion you need to deactivate all the wet floor signs then go to Bonnie bowl and then in the bowling area you then go under a sign and you can see Bonnie Douro fed by wet flood signs no joke I just found it out
hey fusion did you know that if you get jumpscared by glitchtrap, i think you get controlled into another animatronic and die, that may be because you spent so long in the mask he finally managed to merge with you and then killed you.
I really hope this isn’t the last video😢😢
I love how dedicated you are to the game I find it amazing and was curious if you found Bonnie yet?
🎠
Hi!
Fusion Z Gamer. WHAT ARE YOU ON MAN! At least TRY and stretch the games you play 😭
. . .     Hah! You thought i was going to say "for rock and stone," didn't you?!  Well I tricked you! Im nFOR ROCK AND STONE!
There is a Bonnie animatronic in the bowling alley you have go to the last one than put the mask on than go through it than go un the vent and he will be laying on the ground
Can you go find gramlock bonnie
hi
Also I can back can you pls give me a copy and there is a purge other ending where you pls rock paper sisers shoot against the Bunny and you win
You can find Bonnie in the game is real
With Chica’s beak if you go up to here while she’s laying down in the bathroom you can put her voice box back in
I’m thinking the mimic is a animatronic from JR’s or somethin. like a prototype or maybe a unused animatronic for Fredbears family diner.. well, you never know.
that ending was so cool omg
Hay please me I love your YouTube video I am 10 and I do not have enough money 😂❤🎉🎉🎉fnaf
Ruin I was ruin once they locked me in a room a ruined room ruined room with mimics Ruin I was ruin once they locked me in a room a ruined room ruined room with mimics Ruin I was ruin once they locked me in a room a ruined room ruined room with mimics Ruin I was ruin once they locked me in a room a ruined room ruined room with mimics Ruin I was ruin once they locked me in a room a ruined room ruined room with mimics Ruin I was ruin once they locked me in a room a ruined room ruined room with mimics Ruin I was ruin once they locked me in a room a ruined room ruined room with mimics
Funko foxy plush and also, this is a really good game in my opinion
With chica’s voice box you have to find her back at the bathroom where she powers down and put it back in her
the super golf at the beggining of the game
BROS ABOUT TO BE SCOOPED 😂
There's an Easter egg where you can find glam Bonnie's broken body in Bonnie bowl. Idk exactly how to get it, but behind a giant sign in bonnie bowl theres a  crawl space and bonnies broken boddy is actually in there which is honestly insane i think thats the deal with all of the wet floor bots. I think you have to deactivate all of them.
What ever you want
W fuzion fr i salute he really did all this quick to whens the next one
i saw another video related to chicas beak and people wer mentioning they found monty’s legs? maybe you can fix them somehow
Fusion if you read this THEY FOUND GLAMROCK BONNIES BODY it's hidden at Bonnie bowling but it's out of bounds just search it
Oh yeah by the way try hacking in Bonnie bowl there is a little secret behind the lane ;)
This is the best dlc yet
Freddy is somewhere

That not the real one
If you Hear this look at glamrock feet

I need fnaf security breach 😂😂
Look at glamrock ferddy fetet
Glamrock Freddy is is pro dtyape

Fusionzgamer glamrock bonnie is has been found well u have get hacks to face tho walls to see him his eyes is glowing white but if u shut off the wetfloor bot his eyes wont be glowing anymore
I think you missed a room in the bowling area. It has four wet floor sign bots
Idk if this is an actual thing but I saw someone give chica the voice box you get from the arcade game
I think there may be another secret ending if you beat all the arcade games
this man is the goat
Apparently there's 9 different ending I kinda believe as sb did have I don't remember 6 I think buts what I heard
Fusion, there is a hidden crawl space in one of the lanes in Bonnie bowling that i think you would love to check out!
Hey I know some thing you missed so when you are in Bonnie’s boll you put on the vanie mask you can see a mask and you get to see glam rock Bonnie dead pls do a video and tag me
Fusion if you're hearing this than I got to tell you that bonnie is in the game. He's in bonnie bowl. I don't know where the location is to find him but he's in the game
I love you vids
Fnaf Security breach on Xbox or steam
U put the voice box in chica when she collapsed on bathroom floor
You can find a bunny poster glamrock  Bonnie there hole  in bonnie bowls
calling this ending will somehow connect to help wanted 2
I queefed to this video
I binge watched them 🗿
That’s crazy
THAT LOOKS LIKE A MOD JEEZ THIS IS 100X BETTER THAN THE MAIN GAME CANT WAIT FOR YOU TO HACK IT
Fusion your so fast i love it
You should try competing Monty’s gator golf and maybe you would get something
YO FUZION remember that thing where it said something about the security stuff and you had to select yes or no? What happens of you clicked no pls make a bid about it
Damn bro really speedran in less than a day☠ that shi takes dedication
I hope I win! I love the new dlc but I don't have the money to buy Security Breach
Umm i got news you can find bonnie at bonnie bowl and if you see a big sign that has freddys face u should see a robot to the left and deactivate it and sign should move there is a Little room and u can see bonnie
bazinga give me game !
The mimics costume being a lion is a perfect parallel to the tiger costume in the books!
Hi, been watching for a while now, keep up the good work!
Did you ever put the voice box in Chica when she’s deactivated in the bathroom?
Thank you for all this amazing content!! Love what you do!❤
FUSION, GLAMROCK BONNIE HAS BEEN FOUND, HES LOCATED IN BONNIES BOWL BEHIND ONE OF BOWLING LANES, BUT NOBODY KNOWS HOW TO GET BACK THERE!!!    (HorrorScoped was the one to find it)
Fusion did you know you can find glam rock Bonnie near bonnie bowl or somewhere else
you can use chicas beak on chica when shes lying against the wall in the bathroom. maybeyou can get montys claws from the monty game?
Can’t u save Roxy 😢
Hey Fusion gamer go to the end of the cutscene of ending bad ending and Roxy is still alive check it out
Sb let's gooo
i agree he was making a lot of videos so lets give him a award
comment minecraft block if your seeing this
You can actually find rimrock Bonnie in
I'v just seen a video where you can give chica her voice box back. There was a scene where Fusion saw Chica on this ground in the bathroom, it you beat the secret mini game, you get Chica's voice box and you can give it to her and Her last words were "I smell pizza!"  Edit: You can watch the video from Faz Faz
Tha baby 👃
Im sad there’s no Bonnie but overall I love this dlc, thank so much for uploading everything omg
I went and found all the secret cameras and the fire at the end will still not open
You know when chica deactivates in the bathroom you can probably put her voice bix back in her
If you go back tobonny bowl with hacks the devs added a giant suprise behind the fazbears pizzaplex wall at the end of the bowling alley where the music men dont spawn
https://youtu.be/otGnTm0HJjc
Fusion behind one of the wall where the pins go if ur playin bowling, if u use the mask, u can walk though it and find Bonnie
i need the good ending
Fusion! you can put the chika voice box inside her mouth! I know it sounds wierd but you need to do that when she is sitting in the bathroom, then you can press "E" to put it inside!
❤❤❤
I think each animatronic has their own arcade cabinet hidden in their areas and you need to win all of them and repair the animatronics for a new ending
Fusion I'm Bonnie bull be hind one of the grates with the mask on you can find Bonnie
If Ruth try to roast you imma get on his ass
Fusion I know what chica voice box is for when your in the raceway when chica deactivates you can put her voice box in
Never wanted to play this until him the goat!!
You can give chica her voice box
Hi i love Your video  and You make me happy
I want a copy of SB
Hello
This is my boy
WyhXmh
Just binge watched all of these videos... let's just say... this DLC did not disappoint!
Fusion I love your videos I'm subbed on multiple different accounts
BRO BEATING ALL THE ARCADE GAMES WOULD GIVE YOU ALL THE EQUIPMENT TO BUILD BACK UP ROXY
bro got the ice cream treatment
In the daycare center
Hey fuzion I love you videos
Glitch trap ending
Fusion there another ending! Go back where the start of ruin begins and instead of going in the place you get out from where you entered
Hey if you get all the wet floor bots you can meet Bonnie
This man deserves a lonnnnggg nap
E
There’s a cliffhanger at the end where Roxy Says Cassie? So maybe Cassie is not dead and Roxy is still alive
whatever you want. Thanks for stayying up ate to get content for us!
So I noticed that you've never found glamrock bonnie in through inside the poster, I'm pretty sure it's real and it's possibly in a hidden room.     And ima point out, that right you took chicas voice box from the lil mini arcade game you played, but I don't think I seen you repairing her voice box. When chica drops to the ground and deactivates, in the bathroom, you could repair her voice. Idk what that will do but I'm hoping that you can maybe? Or possibly repair all the glamrock robots. Anyways I love your videos and you make me happy everyday, thank you for this early release
Bonne is in the game  he is somewhere
Does anyone else see that Roxane wolf has green parts to her when you put the mask on? Like the missing parts of her you can see but it doesn’t seem to do that for any other of the animatics (maybe it does and I missed it) but I think this could mean you could quite literally put Roxanne back together. Also another thing to kindve support my theory here is that when you get chicas voice box, the beak look like the green part of Roxanne’s mouth when you have the mask on. Just a theory I’m not sure but I thought maybe I’m on to something
we know its not a mod =D you cant mod it yet =D
Dang that was INSANE. I'm curious about what that thing was. I like that ending much better then the first one tbh.
whatever i want
your the best
Fusion your supposed to put chicas beak back in her mouth when you see her in the restroom (forgot which chapter also this is just if you didn't know)
Try fixing the others. Get the other parts from the arcade machines.
Who else binged this entire series (then forgot to comment)
May i plz have one porfavor
My guy seriously stayed up all night to upload content for us thank you
Sleep is important but ruin is more important to fusion
I want to enter so I can get the game and find lore.
Hear me out. Supposedly it might be possible to 'fix' the Glamrock animatronics. Glamrock Bonnie has been shown in a hidden place and, by disabling the four warning bots around him, his eyes go dark. Chica's voice box has been shown to be obtainable and then you can give it back to Chica when she's laying down in the bathroom, seemingly de-activated. I think I read a comment that Dawko found Monty's lower half too, so it might be possible to fix the animatronics- to an extent- and get another ending? Not sure how true that is, but it seems like an odd detail that a 'Ruined' Freddy is shown in the teaser images with his head on his body, and yet we don't see it in Ruin DLC. Just food for thought, I could be wrong, but it'd be nice...  Update: According to what I've heard, there is supposedly a fourth ending that isn't in the game yet (being assigned as 'none' in the game files.) This could mean that another ending is coming to Ruin at some point in an update, but it could also just be nothing. Food for thought.
Whatever you want
I did everything, came to the door, and the mimic wasnt in a costume, and the door wasnt open!
I’m so happy that there are multiple endings to the dlc if there weren’t any more I most likely would have cried lol
Tryna get that free fnaf security breach fr
I've finally finished all of your videos on Ruin. Man, this game is crazy! I sure wish I could play it. The suit kinda look like some sort of damaged Fredbear suit. I bet the next secret has something to do with Glamrock Bonnie.
Hi love your videos
I wonder where glamrock foxy or Bonnie is
This is so much better then the main game ngtl
Wow. WOW. The sheer speed and conviction you’ve got with this stuff!! I was so impressed that you got the mini game last time in one but seriously, this is wild.
Did not know what to say so monkey
Security breach pls
Best ending leave
Wait, couldn’t you exit out of the screen when before you de-activate roxy?
Wait what was Chica’s voice box for then??
What are you doing? Is this weave
Does ending when you start the game where you entrance you can leave the area you have to crouch and keep jumping and it will give you a secret and another ending. It didn’t tell you about.
i just finished all of the other ones can't wait!!
I need it
I'm herto get a chance at the givaway
Yo fusion. I recommend you to Go back to the bowling alley. There is somone there.
Behind one of the signs is a cool little secret
Best youtuber, and good work❤😂❤😂
Those mascots creep me out a bit
Yo fusion try putting chicas voice box on chica when she was on the floor, idk which chapter it was on but chica was on the floor in the bathroom and wasn't moving at all
Hey fusion gamer there is a path to a secret place in the bowling alley. To get to the secret room you will have to remove something that is blocking the path. Good luck finding the secret path
Commenting for another entry 😂 also thank you for getting these out so quick
Glam Bonnie is in here by here I mean the game find him or watch Brandens vid it's called all about ruin deaths and saves or something like that pls tell me if u see this replay or like my comment fusion pls
They're all mangled
fusion try turing off all wet floor robots in the next video
Try putting the voice box on roxy when she is trapped
This dlc is actually really dang good, far superior to the base game and i'd say its up there in terms of my favs
the second i get security breach imma go crazy
Rip to all the animatronics
This is a great game so far thanks scot also thank you for taking time out of your day for us fusion
I hope to get the copy of this on ps4
Hehe
Yoooo Bonnie has been found, he’s in a room around the bowling alley, he’s broken on the floor with a bunch of those clean bots around him.
What the fuck is this secret ending tho
I literally liked every episode and subscribe this was amazing to watch
How about when Roxanne was getting deacgivated, can you avoid deactivating her like cancel it?
Can’t wait for Cory to play this
fusion have you seen what happens once you've disabled all the wet floor bots
matpat not doing no more fnaf theory videos
@Fusionzgamer in Bonnie bowl Bonnie is behind the bowling alley in the far corner
Restart your game once you jump in the place there's a way how to glitch outside and get a new ending ❤
"this will only hurt for one moment"
Hi
I really wanna give my thoughts on the DLC so far. Ik nobody usually reads my comments and this one is definitely gonna get ignored as usual but I still want to say something but I have nobody to talk about this with. I need to share my thoughts out there, even if no one will listen.. anyways I have pretty mixed feelings about the DLC. There's definitely some good and some bad. It's basically just like the base game all over again. At first I really loved the DLC. It looked super good and felt scary too, I legit got spooked in the beginning even tho it was super obvious. I like the new mechanics of the game, I love the overall feel, and I like Cassie as a character. But then of course there's some disappointments. I really wanted to see more of the Daycare attendant but of course he only appears once and that's it. At least we saw a new side of him which is cool but I wanted to see more of him. Why they gotta do him so dirty? 😔 I was also kinda hoping we'd see Vanny more because she's such a disappointing antagonist and she really needed more screen time. But of course she wasn't in the DLC at all... can't say I'm surprised. Then we have the endings. Well I'm sure there's at least one more ending left after this but for now, I'm extremely disappointed. It has to be another cliffhanger again and we get more questions than answers. I wasn't really expecting for anything to get answered because let's face it, nothing ever will. FNAF's story will forever remain a mystery. I still hate that we got little to no answers. I wanted to learn more about Gregory and even Cassie. But we got nothing, just more mysteries. I hate how complicated the story has gotten, it's so hard to figure out. I've given up on trying to understand it tbh. I can't do this anymore. I've come to accept that I will never understand it. Ever. So while the DLC wasn't completely disappointing, I'm still upset over some things. Now I'm not sure what we're gonna get next. Will there be another part to the DLC or is that it for Security Breach? This can't be the end, there has to be more. Well I definitely wasted my time typing all of this because I doubt anyone will read this. No one ever seems to pay attention to my comments which always makes me sad... I hope that maybe it will get noticed this time but I doubt it. I guess I'm just talking to the void. Hello void :) Hope you enjoyed my rant. Sorry for the super long comment heheh. I'll stop talking now
honestly bro ive been watching you for years and i love your videos man,keep up the good work man
Fusionzgamer I know where glamerock Bonnie is he is in the bowling ways is that you have to fly
What ever you want
he forgot about the voice box for chica

How can you play security breach free DLC without security breach because I don’t wanna pay $39.99 dollars Please fusion I need your help
How can you play security breach free DLC without security breach because I don’t wanna pay $39.99 dollars Please fusion I need your help
So what happens with chica's voice box?
I been watching you for a long time I watch all of the Fanf breach I hope there making a other one soon but see you soon keep making more of Fanf 👍
I like how this man will stay up all night just to entertain his subscribers and we should all give him respect
In the books it mentioned that the Mimic would wear different costumes and suits so I suppose that’s why it was wearing a suit in that ending.
Whatever you want
Could I have the copy of security breach please
Okay after seeing all this i’m just….i’m just blown away!! i know MatPat is gonna have a hell of a time doing theories and seeing easter eggs and just finding and connecting tiny details like how Gregory’s line “The stupid door won’t open” is reused maybe but like yeah it’s all amazing and Fusion was my first go to to watch it and it’s so awesome to see friends (and siblings) alike come together for this game! truly amazing and a big, HUGE thank you to Fusion for doing this for us it’s truly exciting!💙💙
Ending do be crazy
13 hours?!? man you’re awesome for getting all this out so fast
Okay seriously, what is with these lack luster endings being so damn disappointing?
I love all of your videos, it is so epic to watch!
Yo yo-yo
I am on the edge of my seat

Cheers man
I can show you how is I'm just doing this I want you to find seeing this there's a chance when you go into bulletball the first time at the bowling balls are well guess what you can see broken Bonnie on the ground😢

Mimic was made in 1985?? so he stole the suits and the freadbear cutout
You’re the best
YALL GLAMROCK BONNIE IS IN THE GAME
The mimic looks like it’s wearing a ripped up Glitchtrap suit.
Roxy dies then comes back then dies again? False info

I was scrolling through tiktok and i found glamrock bonnies dead body behind his bowling alley
PS. Glamrock Bonnie can be found in Bonnie bowl
Hi
DUDE GLAM ROCK BONNIE IS FOUND IF YOU DEACTIVATE IN BONNIE BOWL IN THE BOWLING PART
Fuzion pls sleep
You can repair chicas voice box if you find her in the bathroom
🤯
did you know? you could actually see the broken Glamrock Bonnie. I don't know how but people on tiktok has already seen it
FusionZgamer in one of the chapters u can find glamrock Bonnie if u have the cheat to fly through walls. Glamrock Bonnie's location is where the giant ball with pieces of it coming off of it. The wall to fly through has the name Freddie's Pizzarea
Bonnie is in the game just hidden in bonnie bool. I say multiple vidoes showing it.
Chezborgor
Wow
Love your videos ❤
W
The board cutout when the vanny mask was on, it was Cassie & Gregory🐻
Let me get that game please let me get that game boy
I remember in security breach when this man got literally no sleep.
FNAF
U can actually see glamrock Bonnie all broken up in his bowling alley put on the mask and find a hole on the wall next to the giant ball in the middle go in it. And u can actually fix chica with her voice box that u collected from the arcade machine there is a time where she enters the bathroom and lies down there that's when u fix her
You might have to deactivate all the cleaning bots I think in Bonnie bowl I don’t know yet but just wanted to let you know so plz to a video about it if you can and also if you do I’m just saying the room is in the back of the bowling alley you know where the pins restart
Waiting for him to find Bonnie in Bonnie bowl 😔
I was assuming there would be another video today going over chicas beak or something but nothing.
In bonnie Bolling you can find glamrock bonnie with the vanny mask and its near the big Bolling ball and it's on the right
Is that supposed to be a lion?
FusionZGamer I found out there is a secret room around Bonnie bowl in ruin and if enter that secret room you can find Bonnie
I now I was telling you to slow down but you are falling behind
Bonnie in the game he's over in Bonnie bowl and he's over where you throw the ball at all the way over there on the right side you have to put your mask on it or the left I don't know Bonnie will be on the right in the room
Fusion Bonnie is in the game
Running on no sleep just to watch these, lol!
agreed
Return chica's beak. (like this so he can see it please)
Hopefully somebody gets Bonnie owlboy Bowl
I would like security Breach
Hi
Fusion, in the Bonnie bowl part when the big bowling ball is shown, there's a specific object that you can crawl under with the vanni mask. And if you go under there you can find glamrock bonnies broken body
I'm glad my theory was true thank you for making these videos you made my day I know for a fact I'm not getting the game but I'm grateful to see a amazing person play it for me
Walpole Grandma Connie sadly he sell Kahan Bonnie Bowl it's your balls so what for signs weird his eyes has grown too but when you get when you deactivate or what four Bots is ice go to normal weird
I have a theory, since you can get Chica's parts and maybe put on chica. What if you can do this with the others and get a secret ending
I was waiting for the letter episodes to said it, Fusion love the channel and can't wait for you to hit 10mil subs. Keep it up🦊🫡
What if you try to repair the animatronics I don't know how tho
For the chicas beak try going back to the bathroom where she was laying down and I think you can fix her (chapter 4 I think)
do the one were u dont kill/deactive roxy
this vid fire
whatever i want
Wouldn't the M.X.E.S system be the Bonnie looking thing because when the security is deactivated the Bonnie thing shows up and then it's sucked in there
I have to say Freddy was missing his head, right in one of the endings Gregory takes Freddy’s head that was the good Vanny ending this takes place after that ending
Hi
This dlc is pretty good
i want security breach
fusion your may not see this but if you start a new game then you can jump back out of the pizzaplex and get ending
Afton is not burntrap cause burntrap is a mimic.
Whatever you want don't want the game though just wanna watch these bangers
Your honestly amazing Bro keep up the work bro luv ya ❤
Love the vid! The
Bro this game is crazy
Could i get ruin? If not then just the original security breach. Do you think i could get it to be on ps4? Thank You so much and you are amazing.   Thanks for taking the time and dedication to make these videos for us, i really mean it.
When I looked at the thumbnail, I noticed something in the costume’s mouth which gave me a question: Was that a skull inside there?
What? I'm just gonna need someone to explain this to me
Always with the mascots always with the mascots man😩
e
He's low-key drippy wit it doe🫤🫤
This ending was so crazy, like where did the mascot costumes come from? Why are they random animals? And why can we kill the Mimic? It's insane
Congrats on trending
What would happen if you didn’t take the doors that opened and instead went to the elevator??
I just watched all the episodes of this series and I love your videos so much keep up the great work!
This was a well made dlc 😁
Do you think that since That glitchtrap virus thingy came out of the security thing that it was actually trying to stop you from unleashing that thing the whole time?
I bet that cassy in the cannon ending is alive and might get back a Gregory for trying to kill her but the mimic will be after her, while she trys to find Gregory and find out why did he do that  and i hope Roxy might be alive and I hope in the next game you repare her
Ty for the amazing updates
Wait I'm confused. Maybe I spaced out but did he get chicas voice box? Can chica get fixed with that? I'm soooo confused but I lived it
I can't believe the scooping room was apart of this game the dlc is amazing
I am very sad about what happened to freddy
Dang man, you already finished, some would say impossible, but not for you!
Try to do the Monte golf minigame and it might give you a secret thing
Maybe you can fix  Chica
INSANE DLC
Anyone having an issue where you open all the doors but the ending doesn't happen?
The commitment you have is amazing
FUZION I FOUND A SECRET (I think)  Horrorcoped found a room with Bonnie in it and a lot of wet floor bots. Try going back and disabling all of them
Your videos are awesome, I never miss a single second of them. Love the dedication
Bugæ 💀
Damn six videos and one day masterpiece
He really finished this game in a night. This is epic. 🔥
I have no hope of wining the game but I enjoy the vids
more
Pls pick me pls I love you so much
Amazing videos bro I  been Watching sense i was a 9 yr God dang got to love this keep up the good work Fusion gets better everyday.
Wait, if u got the beak from the arcade, what will u get if u do the one at Monty golf
Hi
Hehe
I'm over here looking for someone who started the dlc and HERE HE IS COMPETING MORE THEN ONE ENDING
There is ending where u can escape from the start
Yep take a nap for a while, I am sure there is a good 1-2 endings left in this game, or I hope there is
Hi
THEORY TIME!!!  “Glitchtrap” isn’t glitchtrap- it’s the system that contains the mimic! It’s specifically made to prevent you from deactivating the system and releasing the mimic, and that’s why you see it get vacuumed into the box at the end before you meet the mimic- also explains why it’s against us the entire game! This isn’t glitchtrap- so however this mask was made had to have been modified after glitchtrap was removed. Monty was always aggressive could be linked to protocol, chica was following security protocol, eclipse telling you to go home because it wasn’t safe, even sun trying to convince you to leave in pre dlc- just security. A supporting fact- Roxanne would not have been able to recognize and back down from hurting Cassie had she been infected with the afton virus! And, if mimic was down there the entire time and protocol was active (although less blocking somehow, gap) that would mean that none of the robots originally had glitchtrap’s virus (although Monty kinda sus) and were just trying to prevent Gregory from going down in the first place. This could even suggest that burntrap was the mimic or that Bonnie was down there in the quarantine zone as I’ll call it, and got caught by said mimic- creating what we call burntrap. That or ‘burntrap’ Bonnie had the protocol Bonnie  controlling it, trying to get to Freddy to prevent Gregory from releasing mimic, eventually throwing all it could at him, and as things collapsed blob was actually helping security bon to safety. I believe afton is nonexistent in SB, if what I’ve connected is true.    I’ve probably assumed a lot but I mean it lines up well, I feel like it’s a solid start for my first ever theory- lemme know what y’all think!
That ending shocked me wow
This dlc is super good
You missed a hidden spot in the back of Bonnie bowl. Glam Bonnie was in there destroyed
I think I know what that one thing might be
I love his vids
Me trying to play SB and SB: Ruin
So much lore
Put the voice box in Chica when she’s deactivated
You know I wonder.... He found Chicka's voice box.... What if.... And this is a stretch, but what if you can return the parts taken from the anamatraonics. The voice box to chicka. The claws to monty, but that is eh... And the eyes to Roxane.... The last one I would support as poor girl needs her eyes back.
Fun fact you can find bonnie in bonnie bawal area and he also speaks!
Theirs a ending when you just leave
Hey! When are you gonna use the voice box?!?!
There is also a secret room in Bonnie bowl where glam Bonnie is there but I don’t think it’s accessible
THE COSTUME IS FROM JRS IN THE FNAF 6 MINI GAME. THEY LOCKED IT IN JRS.
Maybe the arcade cabinets give you all of their pieces and you can give them to them?
i wonder if there is an option to not turn off Roxy (node) and if that gives a different ending
(: hi
Bonnie is is found in bonnie bowling area
Amazingly made game
Another thing for the voice box is that u need to find chica laying down and give her the voice box
I’ve been so excited to see someone play through the dlc since I found out it was coming out
Liked and subbed
You have to use the voice box on Chica's body in the bathroom of Roxannes race way. I did that, and it worked
this is so cool! thank you for playing this so early thank you! thank you! thank you!
Hey fusion! i dont want to spoil anything but in bonnies bowling alley theres a secret entrance where you can go find a certain robot 🤫
Fusion having a Reference on game theory not live
This ending is so cool
I love how he puts little/some big secrets in the game ❤️
Fusion is amazing at fnaf games he beat ruin DLC so fast its amazing
thank you fusionzgamer i whatced all of the videos they are awsome
It’s good
me i so all the video
I saw that camera instantly when you were first playing i was wondering why it was in the darkness
I love watching you play this
If you deactivate all the wet floor robots and head to bonnie bowl, you can find a decommissioned animatronic there (no spoilers lol)
How many games has he beat and uploaded on release day
I bet the monty golf minigame would give you monty's claws, and maybe something in fazer could have Roxy's eyes, then you could repair Roxy instead of deactivate her.
hi
fusion there's a secret room in bonnie bowl  and you have to use your mask to get there and the room is next to a glowly pink light under a glamrock freddy cover
When you start you just need to double jump to get out where you got in the pizzaplex to get a ending
we need to see afton
Deactivate all the wet floor signs and then one the ally’s will be open,Also keep up the great work😊
HYPE!
I would like FNAF Security Breach RUIN
Your actually crazy for completing the dlc this quick
This man hast to give him an award. He finished a whole game in one day.
Thank you for all your time fusion
FUSION IDK IF ITS A MOD OR NOT BUT I THINK YOU CAN ACUALLY REPAIR CHICA'S VOICE BOX
Thank you for your sleep sacrifice 😭❤❤❤ I am so appreciative of getting Ruin content on Ruin day. I don't play, just watch, so these videos are everything to me ❤
Fusion did you know? Glamrock Bonnie was in the game but he's hidden in the Bonnie bowling area
fuzion i have an idea on how to get an ending, when you have to deactivate roxy and the circuit panel pops up it gives you the option to esc and close it, now wether it does something or not idk.
Was that the bite of 87
lol nice
Can't wait for another video
There’s a way to find Bonnie
Fusion you HAVE to listen to the rest of what Roxy says when you power her down  Also!!! You can actually find Bonnie in Bonnie bowl he's at the back of the actual bowling area by the cleaning bot in the corner
hello
Security breach PS4
Weird that the other endings dint have her leaving
Can u play gator golf and also great job like u need to get a award
i cant belive this man missed glamrock bonnie
🎉
Hey, I just found this out. You can end the game at the beginning, if you jump back up where Cassie came from then the game will just end
i just found out something if u take the voice box you can put it in chica when she’s sitting in the bathroom on chapter 5 i think or where you chase roxy
That suit kinda looks like Happy Frog
Bro is speedrunning being a youtuber
#gametheory
Bro this dlc is hard asf
Fnaf sb, Steam
Fusion goin crazy on this DLC
I have a theory about the endings this dlc follows aftons ending vannys ending and any endings that show Gregory escape
Can I get a copy of security breach im a big fan I have been watching since dayshift at fredbears
Love ya t
Malk
WOAH!! The amazing content was very cool!!
thank you for uploading the entire playthrough and extra endings so quickly, i hate when games come out and i have to wait weeks for content creators to release the videos. I love being able to binge the whole thing in a few hours
I like how the have color themes for each character
What if you could get all of the parts that Gregory stole from the animatronics and you could give it back to them cause you did find chicas beak from a arcade so what if there are more arcades that you can get parts from
u work so hard on ur videos
To let anybody know you can find glamrock bonnie In the bowling alley
Did fusion find glamrock Bonnie because in Bonnie bowl there's are secret room actually
chica
I absolutely love your videos. Bro, I've been subscribed for a while now. I have notifications on for everything you post and I just want to say thank you so much for the grind that you do every single day giving us so many good videos to watch And I have loved fnaf for years so thank you for the  amazing vids
Just watched all 7 episodes and loved it
FUSION, GLAMROCK BONNIE ACTUALLY REVEALS IN THIS DLC PLS CHECK IT OUT!!
I wanna play but i use xbox
its so odd that the scooper ending is just- the guy being picked up like its a plushy by a claw machine and then he just- lay down
Please fusion can you try to figure out how to get there without nocliping
I think there’s another ending if you just start and go out the window you break in from
The sheer amount of time and effort fusion put into this JUST so we could see the entire game in a short amount of time is absolutely insane
I cant wait to play this dlc! Even if i dont get it gifted, ill find the spare to buy it for myself!
Glamrock bonnie is in bonnie bowl behind the purple light https://youtu.be/XNnD9IiGTd
i think its a lion
YO BONNIE WAS FOUND IN SECURITY BREACH
Did you guys knows you hack out the map you actually can meet Bonnie and side of Bonnie’s bowling
I liked,hopefully I win the copy
Hello I don’t want to spend money on security breach and you k ow what I am hinting at hehehe.
Swaws
Pls dont stop the vids of funaf😢
PART 8 best ending escape pizza, Plex🎉
Can we get a live stream of the game next while your working stuff out with dawko
Honestly I was pretty annoyed with the original ending but I’m excited to see this one
You might be able to get a different ending if you play all the arcades and fix the animatronics
E
fusion thank you.
In Bonnie’s bowling alley you can see a dead glamrock Bonnie as a secret
Hi Fusion I love your videos if I get security breach please give it to me on Xbox One
This is the best You are the best You are better than roxy
I’m on Xbox💀💀💀
what if you try and go back to the part right before Roxy starts fighting him maybe he has it already??
I was NOT expecting the scooping room!
thank you fusion
And you can repair chicas voice box in the bathroom
You can use Chica beak on chica when she on the bathroom sitting down
i have officially commented on every single video, im watching this one rn, and i love these
I did all of it plz
I want this to be a hint to a secret I won’t say it because it might spoil fuzion surprise so here we go. And no I don’t know the surprise   Deep down in the pizzeria a behind the walls of least expected lies a familiar face from 1993
i love how when you pause it shows the most recent item like an ad to buy it
For me personally when you open all the doors and you see the new mimic, that’s chasing you I think it looks like chipper from chipper and sons lumber Co. But it could just be me tell me what you think about it.
BONNIE IS IN BONNIE BOLL SEARCH IT UP HES TGERE I POMIS
Hey fusion in Bonnie’s bowling area there is a secret area behind the pins there’s a lot of wet floor bots and someone you really wanted to see when you went there
Fusion you can use chica voice box on chica when she was in the toilets on the ground
Maybe Monty claws can be found in his arcade game
I just realized, didn’t Freddy have chicas voice box in him as a upgrade? If so how is it out of him? Was it a back up voice box?
I straight up found this during my first playthrough, that’s funny
This is an amazing DLC 🎉
You can give chica her voice box
Hey its me again I would love to have the DLC of it
Hello fusion! Watching from all the way from morocco love the content ❤
Pls  I want  it really  need it pls
you sexy boy, love you bro. Im not gay
While these different endings are wild, which one is Canon?
I believe the mimic is Circus baby 🤔
Hey I’m for 2 years see your videos i love it❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊
I love your videos❤❤
well that's interesting
In Bonnie’s bowl, there’s a secret room where you can find Bonnie where the pins go in the little hole but you have to put the mask to see it
I think there gonna be another dlc
Taco Tuesday
Well, you said,  comment whatever you want
What if you activate then in the order of 1987
You can hellp all animatronics if you give them back there parts
bro under a DAY BROTHER DESERVES NOT ONE AWARD THIRTY FIVE I WOULD HAVE DIED 2000 TIMES
yoooooooooooooooooooooooo
There are also two other mascots besides just the lion mascot the mimic was
What I want to know is, what happens if you put chica’s beak back?
Bonnie is in the game
Did you know in Bonnie bowl you can find bonnie destroyed in a room
He was found the one you glamrock bonnie in the bonnie bowl i do not now how to get to him he is in the game it will be found soon
Please
i want more parts there have to be more endings to the ruin dlc maybe we get to see bonnie in one if so that would be awesome and fusion said there are a lot of hidden stuff in bonnies bowling maybe one is with the princess quest sword
It's A  sleep place mascot suit I have more to the Theory but I can't say the rest
Secret easter egg you can find Glam rock bonnie in the bowling area
What if you can fix the animatronics with the parts you find in the arcade machines
Fusion you need to deactivate all the wet floor signs and go to Bonnie bowl there’s a massive secret there
Hoho
I hope i win
Also, when Chica deactivates in roxys raceway, you can give chica her voice box it doesn't do anything but it's a cool easter egg
You can find a broken Bonnie animatronic in Bonnie’s bowl somewhere in a secret room by the giant circle white ball
I havent even watch it his grind is insane the entire dlc in under a day
If u don’t get any sleep today I will put you at gun point .2 scooping is my job >:(
Fuzion should have the world record for most amount of games beaten first
Liked and subbed!
Fusion, remember when you saw chica just sitting there in the bathroom deactivated? Well, you can put the voice box in her after walking up to her and interacting.
Maybe it's me but I believe the mimic is in the fnaf movie, I think so because of the animatronic with the blade mouth in the trailer, maybe I didn't see the mimics mouth correctly ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Cool video
Yo this is for Fuzion Z gamer himself you are able to find glam-rock Bonnie in Bonnie Bowl I'm not joking this is legit you have to deactivate all wet floor signs
Whatever I want
i hate to say this but you missed a ending at the start of the game... just leave the plex after you start it ngl i was so annoyed at this ending
The thing is in fourth bowling alley also can we be friends
I had a beat five nights at Freddy’s security breach, and I really want to ruin DLC so please
Bunnies also hidden at Bonnie bowling
hi
You can put chica's voice box back into Chica btw
So if you get the beak for chica from her arcade, maybe monty golf’s gets his arms?
need the game
Could this be the canon ruin ending? The Mimic is described to be able to literally fit in animatronic shells, mascot costumes and humans, which makes this ending feel much more believable to be the canon to this DLC. Feel free to prove me wrong.
Yo fusion at bonnie bowl bonnie is in the back of the ally ways
I love your videos
bro is this even Five night at freddys anymore?
There are three mop bots behind the bowling lane on the far right of bonnie bowl and there is a secret back there that you might wanna make a video about if you put the mask on you will see a hole in one of the lanes
Fusión, YOU CAN FIX CHICA IN THE BATHROOM WHEN SHE LAYS DOWN WITH THE VOICE BOX
Alrighty been subbed for years but just liked the video and comment 👍
I've never been able to play security breach and it looks AWESOME i would love to get it.
Watched all yhe parts and i have to say fnaf security breach new dlc is actually good and ghe endings i felt that emotionally
This is so cool
Fusion I wish you had seen the glamrock Bonnie secret :(
Love the new dlc and it’s crazy that I’ve watching your channel for so long keep up the great videos ❤
I cannot belive these endings the main one I hate the fredbear one confuses me and then this one
Hey fusion I've just found something out! When you get chicas voice box and after you see her sit down in the bathroom you can return her voice box! 👍
The dlc is way different then I thought I did not expect the mimic to be a part  of dlc
HI I hope I can get the copy of the game iv ben wanting it so long
Glamrock Bonnie has been found
FUSION!! IN THE BOWLING ALLEY PART, THERES A ROOM HIDDEN BEHIND ONE OF THE FREDDY POSTERS OR WHATEVER AND BONNIE IS BACK THERE.
Do a hacking video and start at Bonnie bowl and go to one of the bowling lanes and go out of bounds and you will find what remains of glamrock Bonnie
I’m so glad they didn’t release the date too early, too much pressure to be finished by a specific date, this dlc is amazing, makes me wanna rewatch security breach game plays 😌
fusion big w
Tbh I loved ruin sm but I felt like seeing the animatronics they didn’t seem like much of a threat anymore bs of the vanny mask and with Monty and chica they kinda just like filled in sections that weren’t very important I wish sometimes we could get rid of them fo good and make them worse than they look but I really love Roxy’s role in this
Bro glam rock Bonnie is hiding in a room in Bonnie bowl locked up behind the blocking pins or near inside Bonnie bowl
About 50 videos, a million hours, someone who hasn’t slept that whole time, and a lot of people who respect the man who is known as FusionZGamer who when the second a new fnaf game or ban ban or anything that comes out, he goes out of his way just to make a video for us respect for this man.
hi
Whatever you want
Whatever you want
im guessing you are trying to use chica's voice box somewhere
have you seen the bonnie bowl secret its not an ending but its still cool
EEEEEE
U can give a certain animatronic her voice back
I love your content man keep it up!
P
I love your video
???????????????
This is a good series
We can put chica's Voice box back in her. maybe that could help find another ending
Hey I heard that if you deactivate a secret pat pat/cleaning bot the it opens a secret room behind one of the bowling lanes in which is a destroyed Bonnie
So question, is the mimic just burntrap?
Put chicas voice box in mouth when she sits down in the bathroom
thanks for staying up all night to post these videos
I like the secret ending more than the original
Fusion you're a machine, I would not be suprised if you would  be the best fnaf player!
Is there an ending where you can repair the animatronics?
Dam I didn't realise how many endings there were!
This DLC was pretty cool
Did u know Glamrock Bonnie is on the game :V
In Bonnie bowling, there is a vent but it is too high to get in, but you can get in by glitching or trying to get under a sign, behind the sign there is a hole and if you walk back there you can find something that will prove what Matpat said about Monty and Bonnie, but the place was sadly wrong
:)
Not seeing OG glam Freddy or Gregory is kinda disappointing but it’s ok
Try to not deactivate Roxanne.
I thought the dlc would be longer he finished it within one day and found some Easter eggs he relly is a machine
hi
Got a bucket of chicken
Nice
Bonnie is in Bonnie bowl fusion he is out of bounds but there is a legit way to get to him it’s probably the floor signs
If you noclip behind where the pins are supposed to be in bonnie bowl, you will find bonnie
Fushion you can find Bonnie !!!!
hi
The ending was sick
okay okay I just watched this whole series WHAT ABOUT THE MONTY GOLF ARCADE MACHINE YOU SAID YOUD “SAVE FOR AFTER THE GAME” that probably gives Monty’s claws then you have the food frenzy or wtv i forget  then you just gotta find a Roxanne wolf arcade machine for her eyes  that is definitely an ending
pls give me sb
Done security breach for n switch please
You can meet Bonnie on the ground somewhere in his area but I'm not sure where, and with chicas voice box, you need to put it inside her when she is deactivated in the bathroom.
If you go to the end of the far right bowling alley in bonnie bowling you can find Bonnie’s body
You can find glam rock, Bonnie and Bonnie Ball behind one of the bowling alleys
Fusion you should try seeing Bonnie’s body In Bonnie’s bowling alley it’s the very last bowling alley with the purple glow you will see it but you have to find all the wet floor bots first before you can see his body
You are a legend fuzion but it’s so crazy because bro I see this and I appreciate you uploading fnaf videos I grew up with the game for 8 years and for you to upload fnaf vids for your fans is awesome thanks fuzion
can ppl talk about what happened in the video instead of talking about how he uploaded all the parts when yall knew he was gonna do this again like last time when SB first came out. its annoying im tryna see ppl having ideas and stuff talking about what happened in the endings and the game itself but all i see is WOAH  HE UPLOADED ALL PARTS (insert glazing fusion statement here)
in bonnie bowl you can go behind one of the shatters that comes down to pick up the pins theres a secret room you might have to crawl
This is the twist that everyone wanted the twist where Roxy is nice
Did anyone else do this i cant get the secret ending
Is cool
Les u dis
There's more I know it.  Lemme rephrase, I think there's one or two more secrets.
These is way this man is one of my favorite YouTubers
man I wish I had security breach
My reaction:      🤯🤯🤯
yo fusion I found out where you can put chicas voice box back, when you were getting chased by chica in roxys area she went into the bathroom and deactivated, that's when you should put her voice box back
A theory: is cassidys mask vannys mask because helpy said when u first ge tthe mask new like owner or somthin so is the mask cassidy wears vannys?
😎
hello king thanks for all you do❤
YOUR A LEGEND
You can put the voice box inside of Chica that’s sitting down in the bathroom
i LOVE YOU
I love this game
soup?
In Bonnie bowl when you hack the game, you can see Bonnie on the ground somewhere and I think it may be behind where the bowling pins go when you knock them down normally in a bowling alley
BONNIE IS IN THE GAME!!!
fred e fastbear
Ooh secret cams
👊💥🔥
Fnaf
I never expected that ending
Fusion, you are one of the most entertaining YouTubers, the videos you do are so good and so much work are put into them.
I wonder if you can fix chica
🍕🐻
As soon as I heard that it wasn’t really Gregory I was like plot twist in a plot twist in a plot twist like nahhhhhhhhhhhh jit  tripping
Love your vids I appreciate it so much.
There's a Easter egg we can see Bonnie
There is a secret room in Bonnie Bowl where you can find Glamrock Bonnie's dead body you have to use the Vanny mask to get in the room and when you deactivate those Yellow robots Bonnie's eyes stop glowing i forgot the Secret Glamrock Bonnie room location but i think it's some where behind a gate i think not a gate that you can open though you can only get through by using Vanny mask so just search for it 🪦 R.I.P Glamrock Bonnie
Yo fusion I know you might not read this comment, but you can give chica her voice box.
loved binge watching these at 5am
Did you try the monty gator golf arcade machine? Since you got chica's beak from feeding frenzy, maybe you get the claws from gator golf
Thanks for grinding out so many videos for us
Im betting the second ending, which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, is going to be the canon ending 💀💀💀
Did you know the thing in the hole you saw when you went down the stairs was the blob it went away quickly but it’s the blob
I love how Fusion just ends for the next chapters
I’M YOUR BIGGEST FAN
Glam rock Bonnie is in the dlc btw
If I’m correct, in one of the chapters where chica is sitting down in the bathroom , you can give her the voice box i think
You can find Bonnie in Bonnie bowling it’s next to the bowling ball you didn’t have your canny mask on to see it you could go through the wall
This is just amazed, literally binged fusions new gameplay for the dlc I’m so shocked and yet so confused in a way? this is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING SCOTT AND STEEL WHOOL
I want security breach
Hiii please me I'm subbed
Can i please have a copy of security breach and security breach ruin?
You have to put chica beak where chica powers down in the bathroom
Goddamm....the dedication to this
What if in ch 8 you say no and don’t turn off the security
thank you so much for playing through all this, cant wait to see more! I also hope i win a free copy so i can see some stuff myself :O
alr steel wool, you got us this time
The voice box is for when chica is in the bathroom on the floor
wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
That was the worst ending ever. Waited so long for the worst dlc ever it didn’t explain anything! Now it’s up to help wanted 2 😭💀
there is more
So Fusion the last ending is the good ending which is the 1st chapter where you start all you have to do is stay on that box and turn around towards the gate and sprint and jump at it and you will be able to mantle and walk forward. Also in the bowling alley where the bots are at you will see like a curtain and Bonnie is broken down behind the curtains. And you have to take the beak to chicks in that part where she broke down at.
Hey fuzion z gamer I would like security breach and I have like and already I am already subbed
communism
Yeah
this dlc shows that gregory was the real villain in security breach
Root beer
GIVE CHICA THE BROKEN VOICE BOX FROM THAT SHOOTER ARCADE GAME WHEN SHE IS IN THE BATHROOM BROKEN DOWN AND BONNIE IS LAYING DOWN ON A FLOOR SOMEWHERE
Among us
The mimic is actually burtrap because look at his body shape and the left or right cheek and you will see some skin
Blueberry cream pie
Can I have security breach I’m on PlayStation
If you hack behind a wall in Bonnie's bowling alley, you can find Bonnie. That's the secret...
This dlc is possibly better than the original
Security breach ruin Be scary
idk if he knows, but you can actually find glamrock bonnie when you go to bonnie bowl if you wear the mask and go into one of the bowling pin scooping things with a purple light. it’s all the way at the wall, and there’s a wet floor sign next to it.
Dude I’ve been subscribed for about 3-5 years now
Man, it's so interesting to see how different the ending is to the first one that you got.
I saw it in someone’s stream on Tictok when they were playing ruin
PURPLE
Bonnie is in Bonnie bowl it a room first you need to go to the place where you bowl irl then you will se a went then your see Bonnie
Yo i need security breach on ps4 my man help a brotha out 😂😂
There's another ending
i wanna hear the candy cadet story
Fusion remember to hack on this game to see secrets! I would love to see it
Fusion did you know that in Bonnie bowl, if you put on the vanny mask near one of the giant bowling balls, go into the right far most lane and there is a glitched wall that you can go inside and on the floor is Glamrock Bonnie
FUSIONNN U DIDNT SEE GLAMROCK BONNIE!!!! HES IN GAME
yo, quick question,  in part 7 you found chicka's mouth thingy and in there was a monty's gator golf machine back yonder. what would happen if you beat that? another thing is there a custom game for freddy and roxy??? perhaps another ending.....
Thanks Man for putting all this time and work to get us these videos. Edit:  And you sure you dont need any sleep?
Damn, you uploaded non stop bruh, we appreciate that and all but at least take a day before uploading again 😅 we don't want ya running out of content to upload and getting burned out now
For the next video, try to figure out what to do with the beak
Hi fusionzgamer, i love your vids and its interesting seeing the secrets and ending! Keep it up with the vids❤ (also theres a secret in bonnie bowling where you go behide a curtain  in one of the lanes and  you need all security little yellow bots don't know the name of it to open it and it leads you to somewhere that is surprising there also there is another way I think and it's vent next to the secret but on another side theres a vent that u can go in the room too (i think) which i will not spolier whats in the room until u see it!)
Thank you for streaming this dlc! It looks so fun and it was very fun to watch 😊
For anyone wondering about the candy cadet story. The monster learned the lullaby from the mom and the kid went down to the basement and opened the door. Hinting that Gregory is not down there and the mimic is
Bonnie is in the game go look in Bonnie bowl behind the plains check the vent
Fusion find bonnie and use chicks voice box when she broke down in that bathroom!
OK so I don’t know what exactly chapter it is but apparently you can see glam rock Bonnie, but I’m pretty sure it requires like no clip or whatever I just watched a video on it
pls i did all things i want to play dlc but i am not allowed to buy any of the games my user is bluegriffinman and i need to buy the original game first

Yippee

THIS IS AWESOME
Needs face reveal 👇
😂 MatPat is probably losing his **** rn! Good luck trying to solve this one!
if u get every cleaning bot things idk what they were called the caution for the wet floor if u deactivate them all u have to go to the bonnie bowling and if u go top right and deactivate one of them u might find something about bonnie
Odd to see the scooper again but still fun new ending.🌹
fun fact: horror scoped found dead glamrock bonnie and surrounded by wet floor bots
This dlc is fire
Really Ruin
Hi this looks really cool
Cheese
What if you try to move on without setting the glitch bonnie
This is only the DLC though. So its not the full game. The full game is still yet to come. The DLC already is so good as is but, again, its only the DLC, the full RUIN game is going to have a lot more than just this. And i cannot wait for the full RUIN to be released
Bro this game was amazing to watch and the dlc was even better this was a w dlc
I love your videos. I'm your biggest biggest fan since like, probably like, four
Fusion. You can also leave at the starting area. Just jump back up where cassie jumped down. Yes thats a ending.
Hi
24hrs??? I really hope you got some sleep
I do you find bonnie he's in bonnie bowler and the black hole
I love your game plays and your my fav fnaf youtuber
I love the amount of dedication you put to pleasing us thank you
Glamrock Bonnie was just found in the Bonnie bowl area (I don't know if there's an actual way to get it super horror bro Mike found it via hack)
Fusion, you can find glamrock Bonnie.  he’s in Bonnie bowl by the giant bowling balls that you see with the mask.
beat Monty’s gator golf arcade from the beginning = get Monty’s hands???
Ig we gave good old Mikey boy to much crap for not dodging that scooper. It’s confirmed bro could of not have dodged it
He is on the ground somewhere
I stayed up at night to watch your first to ruin DLC videos
Please, I want the game, please give her to me.
Fusion what if you didn't deactivat Roxy and you didn't press yes to turn of the security
Hi
More please
Bro I wish I have Security breach I downloaded Security breach from Steam Unlocked so I can’t play Ruin since I need to buy it from Steam!
Can I have a free copy
🍦
I just wanna say one thing this is not security breach this is a whole Nother game entirely
Play fnaf doom on Roblox
I love your videos and I would love to have that sb
This game is beautiful 🤩 Can't wait for the next video
I love all the content thank you so much! I would love to win a copy of the game!
You should try to find the glam rock Bonny in the game
This game looks so fun toplay hope to win it
I wounder if the chica arcade game gives you her voice box then maybe the gator golf game might give you something too
They found glamrock Bonny
La caca
I hope he's sleeping rn, it's awesome that he's able to do this without sleeping for so long.
If you deactivate all the cleaning bots it will open a door in Bonnie bowl and there is a broken glamrock Bonnie.
I excited to get this
Security breach
You should get pair in Monty golf to get his claws maybe?
hi
Bro use the voice box when chica deactivates
Go back in Bonnie’s bully Ball in the pins. There’s a hole inside there’s Bonnie.
I am in love with this dlc it’s amazing
Straight up scooping the Mimic is a whole new level of badassery 😭
Hi
its amazing how good you are at all these games you play and when I play them there hard love your videos and its so cool to be watching you
Fusion you need to go back to Bonnie bowl there is a bot to deactivate and it opens a secret room and someone is inside please look at it
If I had to guess on what you’re looking for Fusion, you’re probably looking for 2 other mini games that give Roxy her eyes and Monty with his claws? Or something with glamrock bonnie. I can’t wait to see what you find I’ll stay up and either help look or watch if you find more secrets!
Fnaf
i cant think of anyone else on YouTube who stay up all morning and night just playing the game to give us the content we want. thank you so much.
So this is the end? Oh wait no it’s time to hack I guess
There’s one more ending you didn’t get it at the beginning of the game when she walks into the building in attorney right now is behind you when you walk into the game
LORE
Letss go! :)
Have you found the fredbear arcade machine yet?
i am him
I wonder what the high school mascot looking suit is. Where did the Mimic get it?
Hey fuzion glamrock bonnie is in the bonnie bowl section to unlock it you have to deactivate all the wet floor bots and it will unlock on one of the bowling alleys
Honestly, This game is pretty fun! I like the jumpscares and the way Roxy felt sympathy for Cassie, rip Roxy tho-
This is so awesome
That suit is cool
Whatever I want
Do you know they a broken bonnie sum where
Mimic be like "finally got Roxanne off of me oh wait I have my suit with me today I'm gonna put it on and maybe that kid will come to hug me and I can kill her"
Hey fusion you can actually find glamrock bonnie idk where but he’s in the game
This man is staying up all night just for us to see all the endings and secrets, can we appreciate this man for a minute?
Fusion you can also give chica her voice box when she's deactivated in the bathroom.
In the sb book of the minic book that hide down might be the factory from the book where fnaf 6 was build over than the pizza plex was build over pizza sim and that factory might be where it all started where that dad made the minic for kid child and the minic killed the dad and that story might be real if you see it like the minic can minic anyone and that suit might be the first one he ever had on him and he can take any form of anyone needs a suit first?
the catwalks are beautiful with and without the mask
The dlc is actually so amazing!!! Steelwool did great on it, I can't wait to see all the endings and unpack the lore!
Glamrock Bonnie is in the game he's somewhere in Bonnie bowl!
i wonder what happens if you beat all the arcade machines
The dlc gameplay exciting but the endings from the dlc are disappointing. Overall 8.5/10 (love the runined design of the  animatronic,)
I love FNAF
Tho this game is way shorter then the actual game and it seems rushed- I still love the game
https://youtu.be/XNnD9IiGTdQ glamrock Bonnie found!!!?
I want to play this game😢
You can give candy cadet the coins you get.
This is all so awesome!
Bro I still can’t get over the face Gregory just went:   “Bye Cassie 🫡”
Anything you want
I hope I'm not to late
I have a theory, the reason why the pizza pled is built over Freddy’s pizza place is because since fazbear entertainment owns that land. Instead of buying new land to build the pizzaplex, there built it over it to save money.
I remember seeing all of these hidden cameras, but I never went to them because I thought they were just glitches
Fusion your videos are vindq random
Hey fusion just letting you know you can find bonnie in bonnie bowl, its behind the bowling area and there you will find his body along with another wet cleaning bot. I hope you find him!!!
If you can find chica’s voicebox, I’m betting by playing gator golf you find Monty’s claws
Man I Got so scared when Fusion was doing the chase sequence
I was so shocked when Gregory said he was sorry and then he just killed cassie cause she didn’t do anything to him she was trying to save him
We still need to get all the comic pieces
Fusion you got to go into Bible there's a secret where your if you maybe deactivate all the cleaning bots you might be able to unlock glam-rock Bonnie he's in Bonnie bowl I've seen him in it
the scooping room wow
been waiting for this one for hours, thank you.
Is it just me, or does it looks like there is a face under the mimic costume on the titles picture?
If you go back to the bowling alley and you go through the back of a lane you can find glamerock bonnie
I saw on twitter that you could find bonnie laying on the ground with cleaning bots surrounding him
I am super excited for the hacking series
Please can I have a copy😢😢😢
Fusion can I plz have a sb copy
Back in Bonnie bowl you can find Bonnie model
If I'm not too late I hope I get the game but otherwise I have loved your playthrough and I love your videos especially the ones you did for porkchops adventure
Hey! You need to deactivate all the bots to unlock a secret enterance at bonnie bowl. You will find something very cool in it which i did NOT exepect to see in the game 😁😁
Idk how tho but u can find glamrock bonnie in bonnie bowl
Respect to fusion for staying up that long
Tiger rock was in the storyteller. And when the mimic put on a lion suit, some stories in the books are linked to the games.
I can’t believe that this was the ending.
I know everything else enough please give me the copy😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Question, do you have to do it all in one run (either deathless or otherwise) or can you just go to the necessary chapters, nab them, and leave
all the endings are so interesting. I hope there are more
WHATEVER YOU WANT!
finished your videos
Great Dlc so far Steel Wool did a great job
This DLC is incredible, big big thank you!
Ive been watching this man for years he truly makes me day when he drops a new video
Go to roxy's deactivation scene but press escape instead of solving the puzzle
I think if you play and beat Monty's golf arcade you are gonna get his claws maybe to fix the animatronics which may mean that there are still two or more arcades that we have yet to see. Maybe has something to do with the fact that we can sometimes hear Freddy's and Roxanne's voices in the AR world?
i wonder if he knows you  can see rockstar bonnie
Hey could I check what's would happend if you don't deactivate Roxy,like press escaped while doing it or Just don't do it
I heard that if you disable all of them and go to Bonnie bowl you can find ruin Bonnie ruined and surrounded by wet floor signs so yeah hope that helped
Hope to see if we can find other secret endings
Here’s for your video hint go to bonnie bowl and go behind the bowling section and u will find something
You can find Bonnie.
Please
this looks fire and even better seeing my man literally playing the whole game for his viewers and his theiroes are good and also elclipse is sun and moon combined keep up the good work😀
Bonnie has been found I had watched someone elses video and they went behind the bowling alley and he is laying on the floor
I saw a video in tiktok showing some animatronics and they showed glam rock bonny
i would like to have the game for switch because it seems if the graphice are lower i could have better reaction time
Love the videos
your the best youtuber ever!!!
Thats not a suit it has some sort of fluid that makes  it able to change his appearance
You mist they energía
i did what you did but i still got the elevator
Find bonnie
i think the suit that the mimic wears is fredbears suit
i would like this game or terraria
Can I have a security breach copy please
Hey dude, I think this is the best ending yet and I'm happy you got it, my favorite FNaF character is Foxy like you, maybe, keep up the good work and keep up your FNaF career.
Hello I want my parents back together
Comment for the algorithm 😊
It looks fun can’t wait to play it someday
Is the arcade still in sun and moons room?
I liked the DLC, it is much better than the base game ( bigger focus on terror, graphics more beautiful and helped a little to clarify the story of the base game); However, it has some problems, such as: -The Endings, I think Security Breach is one of the games with the most confusing endings in the franchise and unfortunately the DLC is not an exception, I didn't enjoy many of the endings and found them nonsensical. -The Gameplay, I'm not saying that the gameplay is bad, there was only one aspect of the gameplay that was not explained which is Vanny's mask; HOW THE HECK DOES A GIRL GET THROUGH WALLS AND PHYSICAL THINGS USING A MASK!?  But despite that it, is a great DLC, I would give it a 8/10.
The dlc is so good
👍
Can we give the beak/voice box to chica!
Bonnie is in Bonnie bowling behind the lanes
I think my favorite ending so far has been this ending
Maybe if you play the Monty golf arcade game you could  get Monty's Claus
Fusion remember there's a Monte golf arcade machine in chapter one  just trying to help you out
Fuzion is great if you want to see someone play a horror game and not do over edits, and post the game, like in one day.
MY MAN IS ON 46 ON TRENDING LETS GOOOOOO
in bonnie bowl there is a secret room where u can find bonnie
Dude I’ve been checking every hour for the next video to be posted
More pls it so interesting
this dlc is better than the whole origina game 🤣
Just go sleep
I have a burning hatred for gregory
So if you didn’t know you can actually give chica her voice box back, when she’s laying in the bathroom you can give it back to her
Fusión you can return her beak when she’s on the ground in glam rock salon
Why do I get the feeling that the secret in Bonnie Bowling that Fusion is referring to is the room with Glamrock Bonnie in it?
Did you do the monty arcade? I know you saw it and played a level in one of your other videos, but it seemed like you forgot about it, bro.
Guys is that the lion from Madagascar thing
I love when new FNaF comes out and the secret hunting happens
@FusionZGamer what if when talking to Roxy at the end you don't deactivate her, I thought I saw a hold e button to disable her
You're a saint for doing all of this in a matter of a day, definitely got my Security Breach itch scratched.
Bruh I need to find out if it is EXTRA LAGY on switch ant to be honest it be funny if I actually got it😂
But if that doesn't work just start hacking around there
anything you want
Now he can rest
What if you don’t use the faz wrench on Roxy?
best ending
In the cutscene when you find "Gregory" you will see different costumes hanging I turned my brightness all the way up and noticed i think lion and a hanging hippo costume
"Whatever you want."
Thanks for just running through the whole DLC in a matter of hours, i'm not sure if you took breaks or not but it just takes serious dedication. Props to you man
I like it can i get ruin
dang the entire dlc and uploading vids overnight is some real dedication, i love these vids
Crazy
Hello
Put the voice box in the decomisioned chica in the bathroom near the end of the dlc. Also GLAMROCK BONNIE IS IN THE GAME DECOMISIONED SOMEWHERE ON A FLOOR, GUYS PLEASE I NEED HIM TO SEE THIS
what if you take Chika her voice box whenever she shuts herself down in the restroom
I love your vids man, I've been watching for a while and you never fail to not disappoint!
👋
Hello
If you deactivate all the wet floor bots And go back to Bonnie bowl. You can actually go through a little area, and you can find Bonnie. 😄
It has to do with the thing you have to shutdown
the best fnaf channel
Gotta say surprised to find out that Bonnie is actually in the DLC in a secret room in bonnie bowl
A very big GG for this man, i'm actually amazed.
Cheese👍🏾
Hey fusion  in the bathroom that chica go in and sits down u can put her voice box
Hey I am a big fan and I was on tik tok and you wanted to see glamrock Bonnie well someone found him
hi
Did you know that when you are deactivating Roxy you could cancel it or just skip deactivating her. I wonder what that would change ngl
new fnaf game comes out   FusionZGamer: sleep never heard of it  proceed to upload 20 videos in one day
Goofus
I love  your video fusionzgamer
You still got to find all the animatronic's parts, I didn't forget about them, even more endings??
Just think  the Fnaf movie is the last project Scott will make.😢 thank you for Fnaf Scott Cothan
This is great!
When you get Chica's voice box you can go back where she goes to sit down and power down in the bathrooms and give her the voice box back
Please I want the free copy I love you and I'm a big fan
😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻 WE ABSOLUTELY100+++%NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHO/WHAT THIS NEW WEIRD LOOKING ANIMATRONIC IS~!!!;"0 😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻
I have a question what happens if I’m on Xbox and if I win
Now you have the beak and go to the bathroom where she shuts off you can use the beak
Fusion i watched horrorscoped video and if you deactivate all wet floor bots then it shows you what bonnie looks like in bonnie bowling but he said he think that's what you do
Love Your Vids
fredrickfazballz
Guys do u remember when that security botshead fell off but no one played attention to it, well what if u can pick it up and somehow put it on fredxy. And if that doesn't work I saw a present in Freddy's chest when he killed him,and what if u can somehow get that present
You know I'm a little disappointed that we only got one fraction of the blob in episode one.
I found grandma Bonnie  in Bonnie ball 😮😮😮 how to get Bonnie no clip 👌🏽 and also I love your videos 😊 they make me 🤣🤣🤣
On God, this man is the flash on God, this man is the flash, he posted already 7 videos in one day, what is your secret? How do you do this because ain't no way you don't posting one video, and then you Are already posting another video. it make the next this men to fast 💀💀💀💀💀💀
This game is insane :D
Always impressed how fast he does these
:) hello
Love this series!
Meep
I like the fact i have the whole Ruin DLC videos in the palm of my hands so i have the whole day to watch it
Can some explain Who or What is the Mimic please?
So... Wish you played chapter 9 in full... It would maybe explain everything.
J
Mep
The only way we could probally understand is by the movie probally
Dude literally speedrunning uploading all endings
You can use fix chicka voice box
I did it
Hey fusion I found this video it's about bonnie and possibly the wet floor bots https://youtube.com/watch?v=XNnD9IiGTdQ&feature=share9  (edit: I just saw another vid on it so it seems that a wet floor bot will appear right next to the door to glamrock bonnie my guess is when you come back to go to the stairs behind the curtain.)
Yay another secret being not a secret anymore! Lol.
this man must have a good speedrun score.
There is a secret bonnie in the bowling place behind the yellow helpy looking board. You will see a hole in the wall and you can look in there in a camera mode
This Man is like the all knowing person of fnaf i swear
Theory: the reason why each of the animatronics acts differently is because of their neutral personality. Chica keeps trying to eat garbage and will only get you if you’re too close. That must mean Chica only gets aggressive when you get in her way.  Monty is aggressive because his anger is causing him to smash anything in his path and acts very differently which would explain the scene in the flooded area. That’s why he tries to attack Cassie and is trying to take his anger out on something.   Roxy is clearly nice because she recognizes Cassie’s voice despite being blind. This proves Roxy was always nice since before the DLC took place but was still full of herself and was only aggressive when under the virus. So if Roxy knows Cassie because she’s her biggest fan, then that explains why she tries to fight the Mimic and the reason why is because the Mimic must know that Roxy is the true threat, leading to Cassie having to shut her down while Chica and Monty were left alone.  Reply down what you think. 😊👇
Fusion u can get behind bonnie bowl with the mask and find glamrock bonnie
This is the best videos game dlc that was made
It was real confusing and I wonder what costume the mimic is wearing.
I tried for this ending but my game was bugged so I couldn’t get it but atleast I saw it from your video fusion❤
that is crazy like what even is the costume why would the mimic put it on can’t wait for your next vids fusion but PLEASE GET SOME REST thank you 😊
I AM HOOKED ON THIS
Crazy
He always keeps us updated. Thanks Fusion
Cant wait for more security breach ruin videos fusionzgamer keep up the good work
can i get fnaf sb ruin nintendo switch edishon from the give away? (i don't have a good pc)
Did you get the bathroom sign in the day care
Some days are just made for things like this
If you get the Lotta hope but in the corner what is the bowling things Yup it’s yellow. Will open up. There’s a little room in it. Do you find glam rock Bonnie.
Woooo!
Fusion got no rest just to see all the endings. He has all my appreciation in the world
Idk if it's canon to each one I think that could be fnaf 2 chica or something but yet I don't think it's canon tho if it is canon maybe something going on
Hey fusion poppy's playtime is said to be releasing tomorrow by the playtime Corp itself
Fusion please go to sleep
Nlg this DLC let me down
thanks for showing us the secret ending!!
You can find Bonnie in Bonnie ball in the back
Fnaf!!!!!!
This is a really great game
me
... Ummm did I miss #6?
The suit the mimic was in was Roxy idk you look close at it in the thumb nail or just pause the video you can see Roxy’s hair body and head
love ye vids!!!
What if..... The suit is fredbear???
Glamrock Bonnie he is in Bonnieville. There is a entrance somewhere in Bonnieville.
i have a theory where the run sequence for the endings is the vents in fnaf 6.
if you didn’t see when gregory kills you it’s not him who says i’m sorry and we can’t have any following us the mimic cut him off
Tip if you get chicas voice box go to chica when she lay down and give her the voice box
Just one and 2 questions WHAT IS THAT THING !?   2 if it something new going behind of this is part 2 I'm not sure what's going on but something tells me it's not over
I have a theory about the scooper room what if the fnaf 6 building took place above sister, location, and we know that fnaf 6 is under the the pizzeria for fnaf scaredy breach
Yo fusion with the chica voice box you can put it back when she ends up turning off in the bathroom.ALSO in Bonnie’s bowling alley you can find Bonnie in the back of the pin area where you score you need to put your mask on to see they broken wall you need to go into
I completely frogot about this beacuse i thought you didnt find anything
I love watching your videos I always love to try out in your giveaways
Give Gigi her voice box when she deactivated
Also I have a xbox so if I win can you put the game on disc
Free fanoof?
I want fnaf security breach❤
Fnaf
I love how he’s probably playing the game as we speak 😂
The suit honestly looked like Gregory to me, like it had the blue shirt and it seemed to have brown hair… idk it looked like Gregory
Cant wait for matpat to make a video
I loved this, thank you Fusion. Take a well deserved rest after you are done.
yo i liked
Ur amazing omg
Man ive been loving these videos I think they are great because I don't have the game and I can just watch you play and its really entertaining!
Fuzion do you think every minigame gives you parts if there is a minigame for roxy maybe we can give her back her eyes
was i the only one who say the mimic had uhm, organs? or it was just the suit but idk man
Xbox 😂😂 lol
Hey papi
Hai :D
The game theory episode that came after this😂😂
Glam rock BONNIE is in the game 😮
Bro is him
I realized that if Chicas voice box is collected and you go to chapter one. Despite all the other equipment being gone from your inventory. The voice box remains, which is very interesting to me.
Hamburger
I want security breach
Pls I want to win
Hi
I just want to say thank you fusion for uploading fnaf security breach
I love you
I feel like it's a steal that the game is free
I did it all and it didn’t open when I kept switching chapters unless I need to reset the
Fusion you can find Bonnie in Bonnie's Bowl
W YouTuber
Yooooo so much LOOOOOOORRRRREEEE
Yeah that seems to be like a high-school mascot like a type of lion possibly and the mimic used it as a covering for him to maybe seem more friendly? Or something else that idk.
I love you
I was thinking, the chica beak, it has to go when she deactivates in the bathroom. Hope i am true :/
This game is crazy
i subed and liked can i have a nintendo switch
No way gregory kills us after we trie and save his ass
have we not tried putting Chicas voice box back in her face?
Damn, I watched these all, and I regret not being up sooner to see this. This is cool, and thank you for the game play!
It's a secret in the cleaning but you know you activate them activate all of them to Bonnie bowling and it might be a secret find Bonnie austrade Goodluck Tommy's Reedus

We really do gotta sit back and appreciate Fusion just feeding us FNaF fans this amazing DLC, and making sure to get all secrets and extras ✨
You are so very dedicated. Thank you for your time commitment. You're amazing.
Fusion you absolute mad lad!

I'm excited to see how this game ends!
Guys fusion finally got sleep I think cause he hasn't posted part 8 so goodnight fusion! Lol
Great job!
Hey fushion there is a secret in bonnie boll  and you need to go where you Boll and go the the pink light also under a sign
Honestly when i saw the Ruin trailer i was so excited but also worried. I thought it would end up like Security Breach again where it was interesting but they cut a lot out of and would be disappointing. This actually went past my expectations! I really like it and i can't wait for theories to start coming out more!
Noice
what was the mimmic waring tho 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Idk if you can give it on x box but it’s worth a try!(also good job posting it so late-)
Saying Whatever you want 😂 I just really want this game so bad
sb for the ps4
you need a nap after making these videos you deserve it
I know where you can find Bonnie if you turn on the Cleaner bought by the by one of the bowling games and you turn it off deactivate it then the golf demo open and then you can go back there and then you can find Bonnie!!!!😓😥😰😨😱
Hey Fusion glam rock Bonnie is in the back of the bowling alley If you believe me I think
I need dat
Yo love the vids
I still want to know how charlie bot, baby and nightmare are all in the game here.
Having seen all your videos so far Matpat probaly has like hours worth of theories just from the Dlc. There might ve even more lore in this DLC then in the main game.
Thank you for uploading these vids! I found your channel from the Security Breach gameplay and am so happy to have done so! Great vids! Can't wait for the lore theory videos over this game!
what if you play all the minigames? then maybe get equipment for all the animatronics then maybe another secret ending?
You’re amazing 🎉
Gilbert.....
Pluh
Hi
security breach for the ps4
Been binge-watching your videos that you just posted today... I really want the DLC but I'm on Xbox
Pluh
Kinda cool how the suit is a lion🙂
cheader cheese
Can't wait until I play it
BONNIE IS BEHIND THE BONNIE BOWLING
What happened if you don’t deactivate Roxanne and press escape instead?
I don't need it I just love watching your videos
I love this new dlc it’s really cools and creative
Can I get a copy pt. 2?
anyone else's favorite animatronic now roxy?
Ruin is on a whole other level than Security Breach 😀
F
.
"Werever you want" the canon ending probably is the one were gregory try to kill you because roxy find cassidy
he put moor then 12 ours in thees video's thenks
So the villain is the mimic A AMINATROCNIC FROM THE BOOK
Hello
Why didn’t they include do music man
Conspiracy theory. This is a prequel to help wanted 2
What if Glitchtrap only tries to protect the access to the Mimic, so that nobody could free the Mimic? So that would mean, that freeing Vanessa in Prinzess quest also made Glitchtrap useful?
Ding
Fusion is always on top of things
these videos just keep getting better
hi
this man stayed up just to make a vid i appreciate that so much but get some sleep
fuzion is the best, i watched all of these in a row wheil playing. fuzion is a better guide at this game than the actual guides
I might have discovered the BIG secret he is talking about, but there is a secret about GlamRock Bonnie!
I feel like there has to be more endings
Im desperate
Please, I want to play the ruins version of five nights at Freddy’s security breach and security breach
You're almost at 4m!!!!!
I want both versions I have an Xbox
Hey fusion if u slow down the recording at the very beginning when u go down the stairs u can sort of see some sort of white hand connecte to a black tactical and we all now what that means
This is so cool!!!
Wow! 24 hours! That’s dedication, and your watchers surely thank you for playing AND posting this whole game so quickly!  I usually refuse playthroughs with commentary when I am really interested in a game; except yours. Your fnaf commentary is fun! I sincerely find you entertaining and not annoying or like you’re overselling anything. I enjoy your genuine excitement too.  This DLC was absolutely 100% not what I was expecting; I haven’t decided if I like it or not yet, but it _was_ fun! I can’t wait for MatPat’s theories either 😂 Thank you again; enjoy your well-deserved sleep! 🥰
OMG thanks for trying to beat the dlc as fast as possible. I have been watching this for like 7 hours.
Fuzion glamrock bonnie is in the game he is in bonnie bowl
HOW DID YOU UPLOAD ALL THESE VIDEOS IN 8 HOURS????
these ending are so crazy and sick. they really went all out with this dlc!
I WANT A CHICKEN
Man I can't want for matpat to make a theory
W dlc

There's a secret in Bonnie ball

Dlc good
Me yup
DLC is a lot more better then I thought it would be from the trailer
Barney's dead you can find him once you turn off the janitor bot a door will open right next to you janitor Bot in the corner of Bonnie's game

Is this the last part?
Dude, you totally deserve rest after this holy crap! You stayed up all night working on video thats just fucking cool!
This has been an awesome dlc!!
I.. am speechless
I hope bro is asleep.
The dlc is great with your videos
I want security breach because I want to try to play it on my YouTube channel
Fusion, i’m not sure if you found it yet, but if you go to bonnie bowl inside the area where you actually bowl by going backstage you can find a cool secret, i hope you see this comment, as the secret is very cool. Goodluck  Edit: You were right first make sure you deactivate every bot before chapter 7
no shot to think this all started with a dad getting way to upset over there sons condition cause of there other son
can i win a copy so i can play
RUIN DLC WOOOOOOOOOO
If anything the elevator ending is the canon ending so they can continue it in a future dlc
Is he going to make a part 8
I don’t know how you did all of this within less than a day but please get some sleep bud
!!FUSION I JUST FOUND THIS PLS CHECK!!
If you go to the bathroom we’re glamrock chica deactivates you can fix her voice box
hi i would love to play the game but i dont have it😊
I feel he tried dressing up as Gregory
you can give the voicebox to chica somehow, someone mentioned there could be something behind monty hologram, or maybe if you manage to do a perfect score in the monty golf minigame
Can I be entered in the give away, I’ve always loved your videos since I was never able to play any version of Five Nights at Freddys place never stop posting  Vid idea⤵️ Can you make a video where you review the FNaF movie  Please tell Scott how much we love what he created and please thank him one final time for all of us   Remember you are what inspired me too start making videos   If you agree to do any of this or even read this please include it in the beging of your next video   Thank you Fusion  nOw gEt bAcK tO pLaYiNg FNAF!!!!
Legoat
FUSION THERES GLAMROCK BONNIE AT THE BONNIE BOWL AREA BEHIND THE WALL!!!!
whatever you want🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓
strawberry
since u got chicas voice box from the chica mnigame, u should complete monty golf. it might give his claws, if so, there might be a roxy minigame for her eyes. meaning there would be a repair ending, possibly.
This was a fun sires🎉
Please I want security breach do you need like my steam name or something like that?
Very w scooping
Let's go
Hey fusion in the Bonnie bowling area if you go up to the back where the pins go on the right side there's a hole that you can walk through and find something very very interesting
Fusion in the salon you can give chicas voice box back to her
hi
If u go to bonnie golf ur gonna find bonnie in the back
Ok watch in the next video this man's voice is going to be deep
Hey Fusion! I don’t know if you already know this (you probably do), but if you disable all of the wet floor bots, one more will spawn in Bonnie bowl. When you disable that one, a wall on the very right bowling lane will open. Once you go through there you can find a destroyed glamrock Bonnie.
Fusion. I don't know if you will see this due to the numerous ammounts of comments here. But I've heard in Bonnie bowl in the back somewhere glamrock Bonnie is there.
Can I get security breach live the video
I expected this DLC to be really bad but it was actually amazing
Uhh globleglable
hi
Am I the only one who remembers there were two springlocks?
I love how dedicated Fusion is when making his videos. He finished the whole game overnight. Gotta love him
Fusion!!!! In the bonnie bowl theres a secret room in the bowling areas i dont want to spoiler but its a cool easter egg!!
Glamrock bonnie is in bonnie bowl
When chica lay down in the bathroom try putting in the voice box
theres a secret in bonnie bowl you have to get in through one of the bowling alleys Im pretty sure
I swear to GOD if this is way to promote some new book Tales of the pizza-plex
this dlc has been great
You can also find glamrock bunny
Can I pls have a copy 😊
I am in love with what SWG has done with this DLC ❤
Hi!
pls i need fnaf i beg
I think the “mimic” is a substitute for the other animatronics so like when they need to be repaired or reworked on they use him to “be” them while they are working on them maybe how he mimicked Gregory’s voice (this is all one big theory don’t believe it until proven or if you agree)
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Yo fusion found out you can find Bonnie in the bowling alley
Yo I need some Security Breach copy’s please
This is absolutely amazing Fusion! This is so hype!
If I win a copy can I have it for switch
Glamrock bonnie is in the game, he's broken in bonnie bowl
the dlc is pretty intresting so far, idk if this or the original game is better
Pp
bro I was not expecting there to be a dlc
⁉️👀
I'm quite intrigued in how this connects to HW2, considering the scooper.
I hope more content will be out soon, and I hope Fuzion has fun. Popcorn will always be welcomed.
I'm theorising now and u know the chica voice box maybe there is a arcade game for each animatronic maybe u can give the parts taken form them back?? Perhaps
anything you want
Steel Wool redeemed themselves so damn perfectly The story and design of everything is simply immaculate
the best place to go for fnaf content
Hi
The game
Apparently, Bonnie is in the game. He's behind a big metal door in Bonnie bowl.  Edit: I think it has something to do with the wet floor bots.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa i like and subscribed I HAVE BEEN SUBCRIBED
I can’t get it right
i want sb please
Sir I understand u need break..but I'm broke and don't have a computer I HAVE A FEELING AND I KNOW THERE MUST ME MORE IN THIS GAME PLLLS WE NEED MORE PART'S
Yyg
Fusion if u go back into the part where chica lays on the floor u can actually give her voice box back
Guys your forgetting in Bonnie bowl you can find Bonnie I’m telling the truth they did him dirty bro it’s his body😭😭😭💀
What about chicas voice box? Do the other games about the different animatronics give you the corresponding parts Gregory took from them? What do you do with the parts?
Supposedly if you deactivate every single wet floor sign you can find a secret room in Bonnie’s bowling that’s next to the giant bowling bowl
i bet ruin is getting a new set of chapters since we don't get a ending comic scene at the end like the og security breach
I hope this is the canon ending
I own the game but I play on Xbox so the ruin DLC didn't come out for me yet 😢
I would like a Bonnie plush
got to say the presentation of this dlc is great
I like and Sub great videos👍👍💪
Fusion not to be rude but I thought u planned the next vid when this one came out lol
Since there's another arcade at Monty golf um pretty sure when you first meet him what up  you have to suit up roxy with upgrades for another end
Among us
try and maybe get the code from the monty golf in normal securty breach as the amount of hits well playing
the dedication needed for completing/uploading ALL of this dlc in one day. top tier
hi i would like to win because it would be my first five nights at freddys game ive ever played hope you understand have a good day    Reply
I have a theory, so when you played the Chica game and got her voice box, so if you find a Roxy game then you might get Roxy's eyes then you might go around the map collecting other parts of her so then you could give her her eyes and fully build her back, because I noticed that with the mask on you can see her fully built
Bro got scooped... Wait wait wait that isnt the mimic its hand is too big to be the mimics and the torso is also larger its much more like fredbears
its always a banger when you upload
I liked been subed and I want a copy of fnaf sb please good luck everyone tho
Dlc is awesome and fusion you are the best for pulling this all night long u are da best
Never saw a dead body so and even though you're getting chased by the elevator by that by that that big giant whatever you want to call it and his arm was stuck so and it's out now so that means you're probably will go and have to have a boss with Gregory and with her against that big giant thing or whatever it's called but it's still alive
Pretty cool vid :)
FNAF SL VR
Man this DLC is insane!
That ending as crazy
Nice costume
What if you tried exiting out instead of deactivating Roxy?
Hi
You can find glamrock Bonnie in Bonnie bowl in the rightmost lane and can go in to find him broken
Yeahhh
.....
You can find bonnie in the ruins dlc he’s in his bowling alley
Theres a secret room in bonnie bowling where you find bonnies body.
Wow
These videos are so popular at this rate they might just be one of your most popular videos yet by days end
Yo bro I love this game could I cop the  first game ❤
You amaze me how fast you beat these Fnaf games. Keep it up Fusion. ❤
You missed glamrock Bonnie pls come back and find a video of how to find him e in chapter 7 😢😭
W video I wish to get the Fnaf sb game so I can play the DLC and the game for my YouTube channel
i have been trying to get this ending but i cant seem to do something correct. The doors do not open when i load up chapter 9 after viewing all cameras in order
Hey Fusion I Found A Secret Where Like You Said Deactivate All Wet Floor Signs (perhaps) You Can Open A Door And See Someone :)     video : https://youtu.be/XNnD9IiGTdQ
If you disable all wet floor signs you can go to the bowl place and see bonnie
Love your videos!!
nah hes to good at these games
This comment will not be edited, for now, I also liked the video!
Can you visit glowsticj
i absolutely love these fnaf series, i have never played but feels like i have thanks to him🙏🏽 i would love to play security breach
OMG THAT IS COOL
Theres definitely some more endings, theres a model for a dlc character that hasnt been discovered
wow thats crazy
what if you beat all of the arcade games like you did chica's and you get their parts then maybe you can put them back together again? just a thought.
Fusion your videos are awesome (=
This ruin has literally made me cry made me mad and wanna punch gregory across th face 😂
That suet is so so old
Yes. A much better ending than a certain one.
security breach security breach h
That proves that the mimic isn’t burn trap then where was burn trap
I’m subscribed and liked Ruin dlc
Btw in Bonnie bowl when u put on the van t mask and see the big bowling ball (the blue one) u will see a little hallway leading to glam rock Bonnie’s body
Didn't expect the arcade games to give the parts for Freddy in the base game
Why get the game when I can just watch this man fly through it
great job hope this ending is better then the last two
Who else watches fusion for years now. Im guilty
This is getting  interesting
Monty’s claws should be found after beating the arcade machine at the beginning of Monty’s gator golf (not catwalks)
Notice me Fuzion... I give you all kinds of advice and help with hidden things but you ignore me ☹️😠
Did you know when you get the voice box you can give it back to her and you can leave the pizza plex by going to the very start of the game and jump in the and leave
Love your videos your reaction to this always makes me laugh  hope you keep up the good work formany years to comeor whenever you're ready to stop you're the best Fuzion
It's a newer endos skeleton though. And I think it's a prototype It sounds like when Gregory saying. I am Gregory to Freddie Meaning they stole Freddie's memories.
Whatever I want 😜🤣
Glamrock Bonnie he did it bonnies bowling
And just now found the secret in Bonnie bowl wow it shocked me
I’ve been bing in your series all day and i seriously respect the grin man! Thanks for providing informative and entertaining content!
Idk if you’ve seen but in the bonnie bowl section, if you deactivate a bot a sign goes up and there is glam rock bonnie, horrorscope found it whike looking out of bounds ifk if people know this or not, I also apologise for any spelling errors
Whatever you want
I love your video🎥❤
In the dlc you can find glamrock bonnie in the bonnie bowling alley which is behind the big bowling ball
De activate all the wet sine bots and then you could see Glenrock Bonnie in Bonnie boll
Thank you for these videos Fusion!
I just had a late night thought i was thing that this might represent the fire ending in the base game (where the blob grabs afton) and how the mimic can fit into any suit as matpat said. Correct me if i missed something
Hey fusion what if you go until where you press no or yes after you press yes just too see look if the other mimic is a coustom😂😂😂 and also what if you do press no
For chicas voice box go to when chica deactivated in the bathroom
If you hack outside of Bonny bowl You Will Find GLAMROCK BONNY
Bro does he not take breaks? He has been making videos like every hour
i want security breach
he better find glamrock bonnie all fucked up
HOLY SHI- THIS IS AWESOME AND FUNNY I GOT SCARED yeah it’s me please security breach
Wow!!
Fusion if you disable all the wet floor bots one will spawn in Bonnie Bowl and if disable that one you can see glamrock bonnie
This DLC looks really fun!
The thing am questioning is something pretty major where’s the blob?
Fnaf security breach for ps4 please and thank you also can anyone tell me how to tell if I won lol I’m I doubt I will but it would be nice
any theory about that AI helpi?
Chica Second Secret Ending Soup
Nice commitment
cheese nugget
Anything you want
The dlc is so good👍
I liked and subscribed! Hope it’s not too late, and Fnaf 2 please :)
Fun fact: the ending when he scooped the monster the monsters death is similar to Michaels
When chica deactivates in the bathroom, you can use her voice box and fix her
Find glam rock, Bonnie somewhere
❤
Just a little hint but there is a littlr secret in bonnie bowl you missed and you will love it
I think this ending is the cannon one it make more sense then you dieing
Is it just me or does Gregory sounds more like a echo in the chase scene as if she’s still being tricked by the mimic
Hello, I have never played fanf security breach, so I’m really wondering if you could give me a because I want to do stuff on my channel but I don’t know what to do because I don’t have any games to play and I need ideas
Hello
BLITZ DID YOU SEE GLAMROCK BONNIE!!! HE WAS IN BONNIE BOWL SEARCH IT UP! also plz include me in video😢
What more could there be to find I wonder?
try find them all and playing them
I’ve been a fan of you since I was 2
apple frider
My partner would probably be happy if I played this
there are more arcade machines like th one that gave chicas voice box
10/10 gameplay by fusion
So crazy omg so much content
Fusion, there’s a way to see glamrock Bonnie, what you have to do is find all the wet floor signs in Bonnie bowl
Up fuzion awesome video I found some stuff for u at Bonnie bowling I can find Bonnie's body behind the giant ball without a endo maybe something for the next video also keep making vids it's awesome
Nice
In the bowling alley you can go in a hole and see glamrock Bonnie
go to beni bowling  to the purple light beni is there
Give glamrock speaker her voice box
Day 47 of asking fusion to say hi to me
If u don't know that mimic suits is tiger rock    Tiger rock was abadon when glamrock roxxane came      Tiger rock wanted revenge      Ch 9 the tiger       Mimic ain't fat btw
Man I love your videos, and I been commenting lol through your adventure I hope you make more of these videos this is my last LOL (hopefully not)
SAY NO ON THE MACHINE
Glamrock Bonnie Found! (Location)
I’m incredibly disappointed that Gregory killed Cassie.
I'm kind of sad that there are no staff bots here to attack you. I kind of liked those annoying robots.
Nice
I hope you have a nice day you deserve it!!!!
I cant get gifted it cuz im on xbox and i think he only does steam games
This is real and its insane
This game is insane
7:22  he got the Michael treatment
"Whatever you want"
Matpat is gonna have a field day with all of this
Ello mate
mimic sweep part 2
I wonder what happened to the blob after the afton ending like is it just roaming around in the world right now
I heard if you got to the back of the bowling alley glam rock Bonnie would be there
Did you now u can see glam rock Bonnie go to the bowling alley you see the freddy head in the sides no clip in the wall and go through the tunnel and u will see glam rock Bonnie.
Excited to see more from you fusionzgamer
double u's
Yez😂
Dlc
keep up the great content
We need more
Just binged the whole series
There might have used to be a lion animatronic or something?
hey fusion ik you probable wont read this but i have an idea i havent watch the video yet but what if since you have chicas beak from the arcade you can get montys claws from his arcade and in roxys area maybe she has a arcade with her eyes and maybe you can repair the animatronics for an ending just an idea i read another comment just like this and i think its a good idea
The suit is Fred bear. It’s like 2027 so the Fred bear suit would be broken down and dismembered
Good
The ending with the suit would make a better cannon ending
Boi that mimic suit is very uh...interesting
I know why he has no head and freddie regularly took his head
I have watched all the videos of you playing fnaf security brech and I is amazed 😊
I feel that there must be an arcade machine for each character and if you complete the games you get a part of the animatronic which you can then give back to the animatronic, you got Chica's beak so can you return it to Chica?
right
The dlc is so much better then the base game
THERES GLAMROCK BOMNIE IN BONNY BOWL YOU NEED TO FIND HIMMM ITS IN A SECRET ROOM 😄
Wow this was so co to watch
What if you end the game with the elevator with the costume mimic
Man what a ride! Can't wait to play myself
Hi
Its crazy fr
Hi
its not working!
The future of fnaf is bright :)
Hi fusion
hmm can i get a copy of security breach
I WANT FNAF SB
i wish the alternate endings were a bit more fleshed out instead of just a small cutscene
i will be ready for your next ending video if ther is more
Let's go!!!!!!!!!😮
im so confused, i need answers!!!!
have you see in bonnie bowl bonnies body is behinde the bowling alily you have to hack the map
Hi
There's a secret bonnie in bonnie bowl find a hole in one of the walls
You can find glam rock Bonnie behind one of the bowling alleys I’m pretty sure btw
I really want security breach because it looks cool but the price has changed on Xbox, it's 40 dollars😭 but you are a great YouTuber I give been subscribed for year's I pulled an all nighter to watch you and your brother play this game.
HOW TO FIND ROCKSTAR BONNIE IN BONNIE BOWL: beyond the purple room is a secret thing. You need to find ALL the cleaning bots and that gate/door will open. Beyond that is really shocking. (Idk if this is real, I just found it out)
Do is a secret place you can find Bonnie at
This is such a crazy ending
i dont know where in the game but my partner sent me screenshots of him finding bonnie
Is it go back to Gator golf to see what all nine holes have
will ps4 work?
.❤
whatever you want
HORRORSCOPED FOUND GLAMROCK BONNIE!😱😱😱😱 https://youtu.be/XNnD9IiGTdQ
Glamrock bonnie is in the game im bonnie bowl behind the far right bowling lane
ill edit this comment later this comment has in fact been edited
Do you know that Bonnie is in Bonnie bowl if you hacked into the bowling alley Bonnie will be there
Hey I remember watching you when I was younger and I just binged through the entire ruin dlc play through and it’s just as enjoyable as it used to be. Good job for being consistent
please i need this game i want to be scared
Congratulations on 3.91 million subscribers ❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Hey fusion I don’t how you move it but in bonnie bowl the sign with Freddy faze bear pizzaflex on the right side of the bowling ball next to the vent holds a special guest behind it looks like Monty did get to him
I been a huge fan for a long time and this is amazing seeing the dlc is this good I would like the security breach game to play but I’m still happy I got to see you play it and show the community all this amazing content please keep posting these amazing fnaf games fusion
I did everything but it didn't work Edit: Make sure you get a checkpoint after you unlock the door
DLC has been cool
Liked and subbed hope I win and I I’m not a bot :(
Theory a game theory but you can actually give chica her voice box back when she's shut off in the toiletand maybe there's something with the arcade machine in months golf the one you played in the first episode (i think)but gave up on maybe to give back his claws and maybe there's something for roxy like her eyes
sup
I got all endings  for this game because of him you gotta lovem
You can find  glam rock bonnie in bonnie bowl area I don’t know where but you need the vanny  mask to get in
Very cool
I also won't be able to stop watching this now that someone posted on it this so soon and you have every single part already so I won't be sleeping for a while lol
Hi love your vids!!!!❤❤❤❤
chil man, you dont need to release every second
give the beak to chica!!
OK NOW THERES ONE MORE ENDING
You missed a ending called leaving the complex at the start of the game
Fusionzgamer, go to the chapter that you see the D j's and go to the  big bowling ball  the one that has a pieces apart, when you use the mask and you should see sign in the right of the big bowling ball when you use the ,mask and its says Freddy fazbear's pizza plex should see it when you do a hacking video in the ruins then tried to delete the sign that says the Freddy fasbears pizza plex and you should see a tunnel when you do a hacking video in the ruins
Amazing work
7 parts
Fnaf
When you have the voice box, you are supposed to follow chica in the bathroom when she breaks down and when you walk up to her with the voice box it says repair chica, and that’s all I know
Oof
Dude you speed ran this dlc
And I'm going to school now 😢
I loved both security breach and ruin both amazing games,Good job on finishing it in a night same with security breach!
me me me me
pls
Hey you have to put chicas Voice box in
7 parts
Go back to the Monty arcade game and see if you can get Monty’s claws???
Hey one thing HOW TF DOES GREGERY KNOW WHERE WE ARE AT ALL TIMES
;)
This is the best franchise
Is that bonnie
this dlc is really a step up from the main game thanks to fusion i am able to watch this entire series but it would be cool if i have the chance to play it!
Helpy talks to you his eye color changes
Im here again hoping i win the game on ps4 so hey fusionzgamer guess whos back back again
Love your videos, Security Breach on the PS4
I love fusionz videos
Yo complete Monty golf arcade, so you can get his claws
auuughhh
I hope you make a video about it
Fusionzgamer if you shut down all wet floor signs you can find bonnie behind the glowing Crack in bonnie Boal and if you tirn off the one surrounding him his eyes go from white to normal also keep up the good work all your vidios are the best
this is the coolest fnaf dlc ever
Cheese
The DLC is way scarier than i though, for the first time i got scared with fnaf sb
ive always wanted to play security breach
The mimic went to High School????????????
Oh my gosh I love this 😂
My theory us freddy was evil amd vannesa was the good person and freddy was bad and ge tricked gregory from not going near any of the other good animatronics and gregory was with vannesa after freddy showed his true self this is about that photo of gregory,helpi and vannesa eating ice cream
The Mimic's dog suit is a reference to the books, in the books he goes inside a human that was hiding in that suit, a very bizarre fusion.
What if when you finish the Monty golf arcade you will get the claws like the Chica arcade game
I thought that wasn't the mimic and it was Eleanor
Dang I fell asleep
I cant believe its over
I like to think that the suit is way older than fredbears dinner maybe the first animatronics as supposedly if you do this ending but start it where roxy defends u theres other suits in the back who knows thats what ppl say tho but who knows
Come to think of it, why does the real Gregory even try to warn Cassie or guide her to the elevator if he was gonna kill her off anyways? Why not just let the mimic kill her?
my guy. take a break. you deserve it with you're upload frequency.
Crazy
Fnaf: homecoming!
Hi
In Bonnie bowl there is a bot you can deactivate and it opens a secret room with someone inside I won't spoil the secret so please look at it and tell dawko its in a bowling lane at the end of the area and you neeed to make a vid on this fast
hi
Good Dlc
Has anyone exited the mini game thing while putting the device in Roxy's eyes?
I actually want to know if Cassie could still be alive because endings like that elevator kinda made me upset.
bro you are crazy with these uploads man. but last night i fell asleep so i couldn't watch these until i woke up
Use the beak on chicka In the intro thing chicka was on the floor so maybe you can use the beak EDIT: Monty golf might give you Monty’s claws, but I don’t know about any Roxy or Freddy game (also, princess quest ending is cannon since Freddy has no head and Vanessa in the other ending).
Bouta watch this one noe 💀
If you get chikas voice box and go back to chica where she was laying down in the bathrooms u can put it in her
Please be me
He is Behind Billboard at Bonobowl
Okay I think I have a idea what candy cadet was talking about the monster lock the monster but I think the monster tricked the son on letting it free like the mimic did
HorrorScoped has found Glamrock bonnie
Let's gooooo
Hello
PART 7 BAYBEEEEEE
Are you going to post another video?? I’m so confused on the chicas beak thing.
Hey
Hey if you go to the Bonnie bowling the top right alley and put on the mask and go through the alley something special happens
I want a free ruin dlc
This dlc was crazy and I like the fact that fusion doesn’t  stop until he unlocks everything
You know you’re early when fusion hasn’t even commented yet
🎉 fusion its almost my birthday in 2 days hope you see this 🛝🌊🍰
I know what the last fast point is. When you start the seventh chapter, you look on the shelf and there should be a present there. And a whole bunch of crates on it.
I hope I get a chance to play this
Idk if it was just me but I accidentally binged all the videos
I know we’re is Bonnie
Fusion out here getting no sleep just bring us a bunch of endings to ruin give this man a round of applause .
I was waiting to see more fnaf sl content
That must be like an advanced version of the scoop, im judging maybe by the opening inside the claw it targets a specific section of the animatronic to shut them down completely
Les gooo
Sb Nintendo switch
Love the franchise, Remember myself young a couple years ago just going crazy with the series, Don't know if Ill enjoy playing the game myself since I get bored very easily. But Thanks for the content Fusion. Get some rest dude for christ sake lmfao.
screw it *un cheeses your grater*
Apparently, you can fix the animatronics (all of them (even monty lol))
If you haven’t found it yet if you remember chica shutting down in the bathroom you can bring the voice box there and put it back in
You can find Bonnie in Bonnie Bowling
There's aa secret destroyed glamrock Bonnie animatronic in Bonnie bowl. Yeah, he is there. When you put on the vanny mask, the giant ball thing, nearby it is aa gate. Go under that, and just go straight.
FUSION I FOUND OUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO WITH CHICAS VOICE BOX I FORGOT WHAT CHAPTER BUT ITS WHEN SHE IS DEACTIVATED IN THE BATHROOM
The mimic got bored waiting for those doors to open so he put on a furry suit
I don’t get it. It won’t work for me I did everything I went to chapter 1, 3, 5, 7 and did the cameras but it won’t work. someone please help
I think with the beak that you got you can maybe give it to glamrock chica when she is in the bathroom
Ok, listen, you are my hero for videos literally I thought I would never sleep this video, so thank you, I am in your debt
The DLC looks awesome
There's a spot in Bonnie bowl where you can actually go through the bowling alley end thingy and find Bonnie and one of those boys that you can deactivate. I saw it in a video and it's legit I think
give the voice box to chica in The bathroom and you find Bonnie but to find him you have to go to Bonnie bowling and put the mask in near the thing you play bowling and go in and there he is.
Both of those endings felt very abrupt to me but it was much better than any of the main game endings
Should have done the entire ending sequence
So few things what happen to Freddy and did Cassie survived the  elevator scene and what next for security breach
How the game plays out is like as if Gregory is doing multiple endings at the same time because Freddy got ripped apart and he is looking ripped apart in the DLC and the place was burnt like the DLC so that could mean there was not just one canon, ending in security breach There was more Cannon endings than we thought
forgot to say that at the beginning of the game there's a montagory golf arcade game. If you get chicas voicebox from her arcade game can Yiu get Monty's claws from his? If so it might mean there might be a Roxanne wolf one
So the Princess Quest ending is confirmed and I don't think the Mimic is Afton and this Glitchtrap version is Afton since Vanny never finished making Burntrap Afton is still trapped as Glitchtrap and since Candy Cadet said the Mimic has been locked in that basement it could never have been Afton and this Endo might also not be 100% the Mimic instead just a random Endo and I really think there's still gonna be something to Security Breach since all Endings leave Cassie at the Pizzaplex and we don't know if the Endo actually died
when do we get the fnaf sb game? or did i not get picked :(
I believe you can find glam bonnie body in his bowling alley place in a secret room.
Bonnie is in Bowling Alley
There was a present in Freddy and it might be openable
scooped
Hi❤
I cant believe you haven't found Bonnie yet! Im kinda interested on what theories you have when you find him
really hope I win the fnaf sb copy
The dlc looks VERY FUN✨️❤ also apreciate all the work fusion puts into his videos.
3:20 YoUr SuCh A mIlKeR
This man dizervers a song no cap
What ever you want I gotta win this
HOW DID I KNOW THAT U WHERE GOING TO POST THIS- BRO- I WAS JUST WATCHING DAKBLAKE AND THEN I THOUGHT " I wonder if fusion is going to post about this to 🤔 " AND THEN NEXT THING IK IS THAT YOU POSTED... 27475384748 VIDS ON IT!!! I'm to smart for this channel-
I literally can’t wait to play this when i get the game
it's incredible that he posted 7 videos in the same day, like who has the time for that? FusionZgamer clearly likes his fans, he uploads alot, he makes sure to get every ending in the game he is playing, etc. He is truly amazing at making people watch and enjoy his work.
Man this dlc keeps shocking me. This is awesome
Wasup
They may have done it this way instead of comic style like security breach so that they could make any of these the true ending if they wanted but Knowing these games and franchise the harder the ending is to achieve the more likely it is to be the actual ending, I’m interested to see what happens if you get all the parts though since Monty had his golf game and you played chicas earlier for the voice box there’s probably more out there maybe you can collect all those pieces and Roxy eyes and it will give you an ending where you give them all to Roxy and she’s able to beat the mimic and you two escape like Freddy and Gregory did, loved the video ❤🎉
Why Vanessa and Gregory havent fix Glamrock Freddy he just a head if he wasn't he would help Cassie.
How did so much people make a video and almost finished it in one day
Maybe u should try and do the Monty golf arcade machine? And so what u get
in the bonnie's bowling alley, behind a sign there is a secret room with glamrock bonnie in it, he is broken and he has the design that you see in the posters
I love this series when he stays up all for our entertainment.
i wish i had a chance to win the give away.
Something that i have noticed, where is Burntrap and where is the Blob? The mimic in the endings is decidedly NOT either of them, so where did they go?
when i was watching the vids i saw those cams but i didn't think twice about them
This ruin dlc is like all fanfs into one think about it
yo
man oh man do i (love saying this phrase)
He needs a break from this 😮‍💨
hi
That cool
Hello!👋
That thing is not from this pizzeria it's been there a lot longer so it's probably a nod to the Chuck-E-Cheese animatronics that are very old and broken-down but since it's been you know all dusty musty I decided to take off a true for a while cuz that was the only thing constricting it from moving around freely when we open the doors his suit was stuck and like one of them so he put it back on his suit cuz now he could move freely in it so he decided to chase us in that suit because he wanted to show that he is some sort of different animatronic than the ones we see because if you pay close attention and it's jump-scare it has one dull hand and one sharp and
this man is incredible he stayed up all night for us i honestly love this man
He needs a break from this
Funny thing is that GT Live video of this game is the next video under this one lol
I like your videos
This is the best thing I ever seen
okay for real, this man completed the entire dlc in less than 10 hours and he deserves to be a legend.
Video 7 of asking for the game
What if u try get every arcade machine done and giving the parts to the characters ((mostly chica first.))
I wonder if we get to see bonnie
In bonnie bowl you can find bonnie torn apart surrounded by wet floor sign robots.
There’s alot of stuff in the dlc IT’S almost like a sequel with how much stuff there is
Fusion deserves a nice nap after how hard he’s been grinding
o/
I want to play this on nintendo switch
Please choose me, I really wanna stream this game!!
this game is so hype
In chapter 7 is gramlock Bonnie
THERE IS NO WAY THAT'S THE END
Whatever you want
I love your videos so much this is my first comment on your videos I think but I love your vids!!
you can repair chickas voice by going to her in the bathroom in roxys segment when she deactivates in the bathroom with her voice box
Glam rock Bonnie is in Bonniebille, but something bad happened to him
Fusionzgamer
This dlc is pretty amazing. Thanks for the content fusion and you staying up to get these videos out for us
Hello
I JUST HAD AN IDEA  so headless Freddy chases you and my brother reminded me that in og sercurity breach one of the endings is Gregory vannessa and FREDDYS HEAD it kinda explains it right!?
That’s the tiger from the books
please i would love a copy :)
You are an absolute legend for staying up this late just to play Ruin
I had to watch an hour break down of who the mimic was
if you deactivate the wet floor sign on the right side of the bowling columns and keep the mask on, a secret entrance opens up slightly to the left (a big screen) in that entrance you can find decommissioned bonnie
Glamrock Bonnie is in this DLC, it’s somewhere in Bonnie bowl
"Boo"
You can find Grim rock's Bonnie's body. In the bowling alley. Somewhere in the wall.
All of the dlc in one night gg
YO ROCKSTAR BONNIE IS IN BONNIE BOWL
This DLC looks SOOOO good. It looks way better than the original game!
Other thing trying to unlock? I wonder if it includes the finding of chicas voice box
Pls give me
This game is so cool
Glamrock bonnie is in bonnie bowling in a room thats broken
Hey did you know you can find rockstar Bonnie’s body in the bowling place
scooptity woop.
I don't think that was the scooper, since the scooper looked like a machine with a shovel at the end. plus, it was attached to one wall. the other one on the other hand...it's like something out of a sci-fi movie.
What if you don't disable roxy?
I just woke up
I need the copy
that suit was so wierd
HIS THUMBNAILS ARE SPOILING ME😭 Stawphh
Fusion you can find glam rock Bonnie in the bowling area with the giant bowling ball behind the Freddy bored
You can repair chica with her voice box
Since the game came out I thought it was good i think the main game was just overhated i love how much work he puts in his videos
Ello, idk what to say but all i know is that in the fourth video I posted all the cleaner bot timestamps, if you could help me get noticed by Fusion, that would be wonderful! I worked really hard getting those timestamps. Thanks!
The dlc is waaaaay better then I thought
Hello
I was benjing all the ruins you posted
Fusion never ceases to amaze personally he’s my favorite YouTuber I love fnaf and I love the long playthroughs he does
I get it now. In the first ending gregory talks when she makes it to the elevator but this ending he did not. So mimic was talking in the elevator. Cuz gregory can not be there to cut the wires with bare hands. So the mimic broke the wires for the elevator. This ending he showed the mimic got scooped and gregory never respond because he was never there in the first place. He is most likely dead from vanessa or someone. Because gramlock freddy is still there but in the true ending they escaped. So that means. They never escaped. The mimic was mimicing them and killed them. If gramlock freddy was still there that means gregory was there. Dead by the mimic. The mimic took his voice most likely to use it and trick cassie to open the place so he can escape. That means cassie was used and gregory died.
this has been a rollercoaster but ive enjoyed all of it.  thank you fusion for all you do
Taco Bell 🗿🗿🗿 fnaf sb ruin is W 🗿🗿🗿 me want 🗿🗿🗿
Aye boss
This dlc was alot more then i expected it to be but i did'nt expect i whole ending with so much too it! Thanks fusion for doing all this hard work and i cant wait to see your little suprise for us!!
Respect for playing the game for 13 hours
The best why to find the sections
rahh
Imagine playing this on Switch. I love me some 10fps gameplay!
Blud really got scooped what a bozo
The ending be like. “You are in the scooping room now. Funtime Foxy has already been here today. Funtime Freddy has already been here today. Ballora has already been here today. Circus Baby has already been here today.”
What su8t is he in!?
You can find Bonnie in the game like the actual animatronic,he’s behind the bowling area
that was a crazy ending
Yo whats Up Fusion did you know that glamrock is actually is in the game? If you get into noclip mode and go to bonnies Bowling are and if you fly right through were the Bowling Pins are and right next to the big Bowling bowl when you are in vanni mode. Also if u have chicas voice box you can give it back to her when shes deactivated in the WC
It is incredible to see How much FNAF games have improved if you look back to The First one. We would never expect What this has become back when it First was released
Can't wait to see how this plays out!
This has been an excellent playthrough. This might be one of the best fnaf games well dlc
I love this game play! 😍❤
Hi
Hi I would really appreciate a copy of the game 😊
White Lion Ending nice
I love you
I think the suit is Sparky from you know
dude props to fusionzgamer he stays up for so long just for our entertainment
Word of the day Minecraft block
Fusion has always made my mood change from angry to happy
The dlc is cool I have seen all love your vids
Argh
lets gooo, part 7  is out!
The mimic is not a new character
I like to call it glitch2.0
could i please get the game i have been a big fan for a long time.
So are we going to ignore the fact that Fusion got Chica's voice box last episode and didn't use it? So then what was the point of that item if you can't use it???
You never fail to give us entertainment
It’s 2am, I got my cheeses Im ready to go
I want fanf security breach
How do you get the mimic to wear the lion suit?
Beat Monty golf
You need to put chicas beck back In her
You probably have to find all of the arcade games for each character and fix them all to get the good ending and the games are probably where you find the animatronic you should try❤
Your videos make my day. :)
This dlc needs a reward for being so exciting thrill, puzzles and collectables
Fnaf if my go to man
THERES A SURPRISE BEHIND THE BOWLING ALLEY WHERE THE BIG BOLLING BALLS ARE AT 🥲
bro needs a break also you can fix chica with her voice box by going to her in roxys raceway when shes sitting in the bath room not sure if its for a secret ending or not tho
I need this game
I took a nap, time to watch another video
Fusion playing this for bout 12+ hours to get all the endings is goated 🙌🏽💯
Fusion there is a secret room in Bonnie’s bowling alley and you might be able to find Glamrock Bonnie broken down in there
Its look a mod
FoxInaBox
Idk what to comment
fusion, your awesome, please give me a copy of fnaf security breach
Jeez this DLC surprised me….WHERE IS GLAMROCK BONNIE😭😭😭
I loved all the different endings, thanks for playing this for us.
05:27 it's Bonnie
bro go tuch sum gras
Crazy how fast you find these endings 😃
You can fix chicas voice when she's deactivated in the bathroom
Glam rock Bonnie is at the game in Bonnie Ball behind the door when you put on the bunny mask where it right next to the big bowling ball on the right
THIS DLC IS SO COOLLL
I adore this DLC! Roxy defending Cassie in ending one is honestly so cute and so sad 💔
I was up all night watching these videos and it was really fun and you are the best YouTuber for horror games
Gimme free game 🫴 pt7
Omg the lore this holds yes! But also I appreciate you so much you did this hold game in one night and I sadly fell asleep so I couldn't watch this immediately but thank you for all you fo just for us thank you so much fusion
I can't wait to play the new DLC
Hi I’m new and I all ready love you fusion
Nah but we're is my part 8
It got me wondering. Where was Markiplier's let's play? I figured that as the so-called "King of FNAF",  he'd be one of the very few YouTuber having privy to this DLC and would've been the first to bust out a FNAF let's play. 🤔
You can actually find barney in the new d l c
You can actually find secrets and and I’m gonna tell you it is in Bonney ball and when you turn off that robot yeah go to the big massive door by
Uhhhh idea. You know how you get the parts from the arcades? Maybe give them back to the animatronics.
I love your videos, but you’ve been relentless. I come home right or not come home, but I look through my YouTube notifications. You’ve posted so many videos. I’m happy I miss content creators doing this you’re the creator makes me happy. I’m going through a rough time but every time I get sad depressed I watch your videos. Thank you very much for helping.
Hello my friend really wants this game can I please have it so when I go to his house we can play?please
How did he manage to complete the game within 8 hours holy shit
yhar foxy got left out again
Hi
FUZION AM NOT SURE BUT THERES A SHATTERED GLAMROCK BONNIE WITH LOAD OF THE WET FLOOR SIGHNS IDK WERE IT IS
I love this game
What if he pressed esc key when Cassie was told to disable Roxy
If you delete the wall that says Freddy fazbear’s right next to the giant bowling ball in Bonnie bowl there will be a secret door and you will find Bonnie
I would enter pls I did every thing  this is my third comment 😂
sb steam
Fusion z gamer I found glam rock Bonnie in the pizzaplex all you need to do is go back to where you were at in Bonnie bowl and go to the right side with the mask on and there’s an entrance to where you can deactivate those clean bots and glam rock Bonnie is on the floor destroyed
Ruin has such a good story
If I'm being honest I love the dlc more then the original game
Fusionzgamer if you go Bonnie bowling you will find a cleaner bot do it please thanks also I want to enter in (love your vids) sleep this time
Sup
O
yes i would like a free security breach
If u remember the part were chica deactivated in the bathroom u can repair her with the voice box u got
Fusion I have a theory what if you choose not to power Roxy down I think you can upgrade Roxy like you could upgrade gramrock Freddy
There has to be a way to help all the animatronics
Get some sleep my dude drink some coffee your health is more important
I would really like to win atleast one of these giveaways because apparently there is a mod that you can play multiplayer and me and my brother would have a blast playing together :)
I'd like to belive this is the Canon because Cassidy lives
Im pretty sure it’s fredbear
I actually might have an idea how to get another ending. When Cassie needs to deactivate Roxy, there's the option to quit.
i have spent five hours watching all of these videos and im not sure if theres more but this is absaloutley (however its spelt)  amazing but besides from that my faveee character is DEFO roxy!
Where did the blod and dj music man go ;-;
Can I have a copy
Not only do I wanna try this, but the only console I got for it is the switch lite.
I Have a theory and read it In the reply’s because I don’t wanna spoil it for others when they look in the comments.
I tool one nap
Hamood❤
Gotta feel bad for Roxanne, damn, she tried.
What about where you can play all of the arcade games to get monty, roxy, and chicas parts back, heck maybe freddy has his own minigame and you can fix him too? Maybe it may unlock some sort of ending
Hi
I WAS NOT EXPECT THAT FAM
plz❤❤❤❤❤
FNAF toy
This man doesn't need an Oscar although he deserves it, he needs some sleep
Secret ending let’s go i’m excited
Hello
There has to be a way to help them
I honestly didn’t expect the dlc to be THIS big. Don’t know why, since security breach is pretty big
I have a ps4 so if I win can I get a  PS4 disc
i have no idea what to make of this ending its very confusing
Ello
A lions suit?!?!
I love the dlc
The DLC is amazing
Wait that means he needs to play Monty’s Golf arcade game!!!
is this the end?
Hmm what next
There's a way to see Bonnie by Bonnie Bowl
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
I believe the mimic with the Costume is Tiger Rock, which is from Tales of the Pizzaplex.
He posted 7 videos in one day 🎉😮 *im not a bot* that sounded like one
In Bonnie's bowling, you can actually find Bonnie's body lying on the ground in one of the bowling alleys
Good luck finding the next endings!
cats or dogs which one is better? you decide
its crazy how he beat the game in a day
I've watched the all the DLC videos and figured out that the bunny that shows up when you put Vannny's mask that bunny is trying to stop you from turning off the security system to release the Mimic😮😮😮
HOW DO YOU SAVE YOUR PROGRESS IN THE DLC!!
Hey funzegamer if u go back to the Bonnie bolling alley in the back u can find destroyed glamrock bonnie
Ruin is probably the best dlc
I have a Theory! Look at the mimic thing at 6:31 time stamp I think there a springlocked head or a head of some sort in there look through the mouth tell me if I’m wrong
Cheese🧀🧀🧀
In the last video i actually felt genuinely bad for Roxy she was the only animatronic who kept her personality  and didnt kill Cassie but saved her wish the ending coulda been different
Your dedication to posting these videos is just... amazing.. Thank you Fusion.
Do you think theres more endings fusion or not?
Definitely gotta give chica her voice box like maybe when she deactivates in the bath room
Fusion glamrock Bonnie is in Bonnie bowling!!
Best game ever❤. Ok this is a theory. what if the rabbit ghost thing is trying to keep you away from letting you open the door in the underground place so the mimic cannot get out.
Ruined is best
you should play the old black ops games there back
Afton ending is Canon bcs Gregory made thet M.X.E.S machine to keep lock the mimic in the snikhole, after gregoy destroy afton then came blob to kill afton, Gregory  knew that thing (mimic) has been there for a very long time then they made the M.X.E.S machine security to keep it there in the sinkhole so it couldnt escape, now that cassie destroy the nodes that held it in place it can escape and Gregory had to kill cassie or she isnt dead thats why Roxy said Cassie? bcs Roxy found her on the ground.  thats why Gregory explain to you why you cant leave he knew that thing was down there and he locked it away thats why gregoy said sorry i cant let you come to me bcs that thing will follew you and you will lead it to me.
Do the thing with Chica's beak.
Hiiiiiiii
https://youtu.be/zCuV8kS0A7s
Definitely try to hit no on deactivating Roxy and then see what happens😮😮
Hi
I like how the hole community  works together to find all the secrets
BONNIE IS IN BONNIE BOWL HE IS IN A ROOM CHECK A VID AND SEE THE LOCATION
You are so determined when it come to stuff like this and how you give us so much of your time and we thank you.
This DLC looked fun.
Hi
Please 😀
Secret ending
Can I please have the game I am 13 years old
Alright I subscribed liked and; now I commented 👍 I would only be able to get the switch version or Xbox thow..
Hey fusion bonnie is in the dlc he is hiding in bonnie bowl on the non tiny music man side of the bowling area there will be a hole in the wall go tgrow and you will find him and a bunch of wet floor bots
ba bleh ba bleh
Just trying to do sum thing like support this guy
i think i know what secret you’re talking about
At the bowling ally you can find Rockstar Bonnie. Look at the end of the ally at each bowling station. You should find a hole through.
This is like the best game ever
pls copy again 🥺
Wowsers
GO TO BONNY BOWL THERE IS A HOLE IN THE WALL NEXT TO THE FIRST BIG BOWLING BALL IN THE VANNY MODE AND TRUST ME YOU WILL LIKE WHAT YOU FIND!!!!! I REPEAT GO TO BONNY BOWL!!!!!!
Your suppose to use chica voice box when you see her sitting down in the restroom and also you missed Bonnie
@FusionZGamer if you go into Bonnie bowl you can see glamrock Bonnie’s body behind one of the lane but you have to have the vanni mask on
anything you want
Plz I need the give a way
FusionZGamer is so nice to be doing this for us to watch the whole game be played at like 3am lol
i love the arcade game from last video
there might be an ending with chica cos of her beak wich means we could give it back to her somehow and get a new ending a good one maybe? but still there could be other parts for the other animatronic like the head for freedy legs for monty and eye for roxy we could have a whole secret ending and he didn even realise it so we should do a test on it and look for other parts
S
Fusion, I found out that there is an easter egg in bonnie's bowling alley. I'm not exactly sure how they did it but someone removed one of the posters on the wall where the actual lanes for bowling are, and behind it showed bonnie.
What ever you want
The DLC looks cool
We all appreciate what you do for us. ❤
When is it going to be on Xbox?
FUSION, a rabbit creature has been discovered in the files, it might be in the game, try to find it!
Somehow i have more questions than answers now
Man I want to play the dlc so bad. They put so much work into this, Sadly I dont have enough to get security beach.
I think the DLC is better than the game
That surprising
Hi
This is CRAZY 😮😮😮😮😮
Hi hows it going on
for some reason, I'm hoping they make another chapter of security breach because I want to see that really badly, I hope it continues forever
Xbox version of security beach for rocky wave way
Honestly crazy on how we played the entire dlc within a day
fusion you probably won’t see this but in Bonnie bowl there is a hole in one of the tracks at the back of it then you can see glam rock Bonnie on the floor
MatPat time to shine!!
Your cool
“Before anyone else” someone already posted every ending
As a wise A.g.o.t.i said "markplier may be the king of fnaf but fusion is easily the king of speedrunning" manging to beat the whole dlc in 8 hours!!
Matpat mentioned you in the new GTlive video towards the end of that video
Purple
WAIT Henry had copy off of FNAF AND that's one of the amatronics suit
Do u have any copy for ps4?
Pls give me copy of game
fnaf big cool
I wonder why the mimic dressed up like that when you unlocked that ending
STEELWOOLS I TAKE EVERYTHING BACK KISS ME RN
I LOVEE FNAF LORE
The scooping room is back???? Rip the mimic
Please contact matpat and share information I want to see you to have a collab
Love the dlc, its been great to binge watch it today
he says hes been playing for 12 ish hours then hepie says to take a break lol. gotta love coincidences
Hi 👋
Great vid Fusion
This Looks Fun
When it said scooping room ending I thought Cassidy was gonna get scooped and we were gonna see baby or POSSIBLY Micheal  But the suit XD
im so glad i was able to play with you i watched your videos while playing the game you are my faverite youtuber and your like a friend to me
Its amazing how you completed the entire DLC in one sitting!
Xbox one
Hi
I subbed to your channel so can I plz get the game
Dear god.... fusion..... ALREADY!? YOU DID THIS MUCH ALREADY!????? AGHLAADSGFH;KJLHKJAGDH;;KLJH; HOWWWWWWWWWWWWW this mans is a wanna be dream of fnaf games ong
I found glam rock bonnie in bonnie bowl
Bonnie is in the game
I think in the full game by doing this ending Gregory won’t make you die in the elevator
Fusion you didn’t notice but there are save icons on the bottom right
Hi looks great
I’m just now starting the video, but I think you can return all the animatronic parts, like how fusion got chicks voice box, I think you can get Monty’s claws after beating that golf mini game, and by going by that logic there might be a Roxy game to get her eyes, so I think if you return all the parts you might get a new ending
What if you don't activate the security protocols
I hope this isn't the last ending, I genuinely hope that there are more endings which we're missing here. Each ending has been amazing but I just feel like each of them are missing SOMETHING
EPIC VIDEO!
Bro i been watching you since i was around 8 and I'm 14 now and i still love your videos
Pls just pls fusion i really want it pls
I'm going to take this Ending as Cinnamon cause I don't want it to be that Gregory betrayed cassie
Did everything
Thank you for losing sleep for us
Pete
If this was the only ending it would be better.                                                                I said this bc Cassie didn’t deserve what she got.
Hiii
The last one he is the canon one, I’m calling it, and if it’s not, than it’s definitely the good ending
This awsome
YOU CAN FIND GLAMROCK BONNIE IN THE BOWLING PLACE!(LIKE SO FUSION CAN SEE)
OUIC
Hey fusion! I absolutely love you content!
Put chica voice box in Chica when she   In Roxy restroom
We appreciate you Fusion for all the time and effort you put into the games and staying up all night for us to view this game and to see and to laugh with you, Thank You for the content that you have put out I’ve been always greatful
So the fake Gregory and the real Gregory is evil and what happened to Freddie
The suit the endo was in looked like some sort of lion
The gameplay is better than the endings
I thought that Gregory was gonna look like normal except he had parts of freddy and the others, I'm kinds dissapointed that it was just a mimic but I still think the ruin dlc is pretty cool
I like this
I really want to get Security Breach for a long time but can't afford it. I've been wanting it since it came out.
Brooooo The fact that you managed to get the DLC done and all these videos uploaded is insane! Love the videos and can't wait to see more!
The lion, wearing the same ish sweater as Cassie and bracelet her hair is pulled back and the lions appears to be pulled back also @fusionZGamer
I already got the Ending to security breach came out because somebody posted Gregory's voice lines and it was only 2
Fusion is a dedicated YouTuber uploading all of these so quickly
❤
Glamrock Bonnie was found by toxicJim
Oh boy
I loved these videos good job Fusion!! Super glad to be watching these 😁
This game is awesome!
bro is a sweat for fnaf
i really want security breach
R,K golf ?
I did all three
What if you need to find all the comic book pages and it will unlock a new ending and I remember when you had to reboot Roxy it said you can stop rebooting her maybe you can save all the animatronics because like you said they are good
There is a secret room where bonnie is in, He is deactivated it but its near the giant bowling ball, on one of the sides near the cleaning robot thingy, you need a mask to see the hole, I have seen a video but it might be a mod.
Lol
I can't stop admiring how dedicated Fusion is to this franchise. I finish one video, he's already posted 2 more!  Here's a theory for you: Fusions being paid by Scott to be FNAF's very own undercover Head of Marketing. Beat that MatPat!
Fnaf security breach DLC is so amazing. So much better than Fnaf security breach. Oh and also let’s Gooooooooo
w fusion
12 hours??? Everyone support this man 👏 😊
Dude this DLC looks so sick! Thanks for posting so fast! Pulling an all nighter for this!
i love fusions vids
SFB Ruin Is Really Good In My Opinion
I love his videos I wached him when I was 7 😂
I heard you can give chica her voice box back. When she goes to shut down in that one bathroom you can put her voice box back in. You should try this out @FusionZGamer
security breach plz
Goofball energy
How do I enter Again? if so Just saying I Subbed With Notifications on and I liked the video. And I love these videos Keep Up the good work Fusion!
I saw somewhere that you give chica her voice box when she’s sitting on the floor in the bathroom
Hey fusion when chica goes to the bathroom in roxy race way and powers down you can give her the voice box and in bonnie bowl there is a room with glam Bonnie destroyed on the floor
In last eppisode it said for the Bonnie lunch box is her dad's favorite and I just thought of Scott and maybe some connections?
Well.. that was fun :)
i love youuuu been watching for years
BREAD
There's a person that I watched that said glamrock bonnie has been found, it is in bonnie bowl, but they had to delete one of the doors that blocks you from bowling, but I noticed that there was another hallway so maybe there's a proper way to get in idk, but it's the one at the far side I think the opposite side of where you enter bonnie bowl. I hope there's a proper way to get in there also there was some of those floor robots that you can disable to so I don't know if it's fake.
it have the next ending with the freddy cutout u can access the mask
You spent so long just for us
This is so fun I can’t wait to play it
What’s with the costume?
In glamrock bowling a guy found glamrock bonnie I don’t know it’s real but it’s in where the bins are where they get knocked down and there is a hole behind it
aint no way this aint a mod bro ☠
Yo this looks crazy
Where’s afton, where’s the blob, where’s Vanessa, how and why is  there a second glam rock freddy, where’s Gregory and freddy, where’s dj music man, was foxy ever part of the pizzaplex, why did Gregory help Cassie escape the mimic if he could’ve just let her die to it, I have so many questions
yay!!!!
If we're able to win a copy on xbox I'll take it
Your telling me that he finished the game that fast  like my god holy speedrunner
This DLC is absolutly massive
can you play daisy's hell shift
It amazes me how you manage to play so much of the game while also being able to upload it. You're one of the best fnaf content creator
You think maybe you need to somehow fix Roxanne? She happens yo have green gloe on her face eyes and hands which are the same upgrades that freddy had
This is the scooping room
There is Bonnie Somewhere I think it was behind bonnie's bowling There was a bunch of stuff bots around it like it was a murder scene you need to check it out
What if you repair chica with her beak
Today is my birthday
I just realized we never saw Dj Muisc man or the blob I thought the Blob would be the biggest challenge in ruin GUSSE not
How do you get a copy because I really want one 😢
Fusion in Bonnie's bowling ale his body is there
you are working really hard to completed fusionzgamer, and it look really cool
God I love the suits!!!
Man I really Wana play fnaf c Security breach
I'm not gonna question why there's no Part Six to this.
The Mimic had to put on his fursuit 💀
I found boinne he's in Bonnie bowl in the back next to the cleanbots.
I wonder if you can get all the animatronic's parts and maybe fix them
I always wanted this game from your gameplay it looks so fun
Wow
I want one this game looks so 🔥
I just saw a video from ToxicJim he sees destroyed BONNIE
Who else knew that it wasn’t gregory.
In Bonnie bowl behind one of the boards the there is a hole behind it and ance you go through it you will find GlamRock Bonnie
I am amazed on how well they made this dlc i live the story the intense moments and shocking moments in this game and its shocking endings like bro we are being shocked as a cliffhanger happens but yeah keep up the good work dude you have amazing content that gets me excited to see what kinds of horror games you will play next keep up the amazing work man :D
my brother loves this game he's been waiting for the dlc and I told him that it was out he was happy
Nice
DUDE THIS CAME PUT TODAY!!!!
Hi my a big fan
Bruh this new dlc is actually really good
This dlc was amazing oml
Lion suit
ALSO I FORGOT TO MENTION. Fusion.. In bonnie Bowl, behind the big pit where you bowl, you can find bonnie all broken, you just gotta break through the game tho which sucks
It just hit me. Vanny is the princess. Glitchtrap is the dark virus in that game. You completing all of the arcade games set him free. Also I play on Xbox one, and I liked and have been subscribed for a while now.
I want fnaf sb for the Xbox series s. I love ur videos so it would be appreciated😊😊😊❤❤❤
This guy stays up and records all these videos like he did for when sb came out, must say he is one of the best
You missed one of the coins where your flashlight dies it’s on the right
a secret ending yes
Yo
Wow did we seriously just kill the mermaid let's f****** go
Cant wait for more secrets
This DLC Is probably The best thing I’ve ever seen
Let's go
You night be able to repair all of the animatronics it is a possibility
when the mimic popped up in the window it scared me so bad forgot about the suit
he needs some sleeeep
It  kind of fun to see
Love your videos fusion❤
that was a cool secret ending, I love your vids
I really appreciate Fusion uploading all these parts , and him trying to find out other endings, and easter eggs, with others, i appreciate it a lot and it's interesting content
Fusion really deserves a big thank you. The entire DLC in under a day is crazy impressive.
I need it
The mimic is dead cassie is alive Canon ending it's done
This game looks amazing and I loved to watch you play it thanks
Hey watched you so much when I was younger
Idk how this guy does it but hes amazing, hes willing to barely get any sleep just so he can show us everything in this DLC!
I found glamrock bonnie in look at the big bowling ball take the mask off and go under the Lan there's a wet bot there and he's right next to glamrock bonnie
There's a secret room in Bonnie bowling and you won't guess who you find and he is there dead and surrounded by those things you deactivated.
Is the DLC not on xbox
fusion needs a huge amount of respect, have a couple hours of sleep man.  ps: i binge watched this all till just now ( i havent watched this one yet )
Hoping that we see another ending as I feel like we're missing out on something else.
Love this videos❤
The DLC really got ne into FNaF way more now, I belive why they mistake you as a Gregory since he ruined the pizza plex, and Gregory did not want Cassie to escape, or its like he was infected with the glitch virus.
ITS JUST A THERORY, A GAME THERORY!! XD
I have loved this series! Good job  completing it!
So nice videos
I would like to ein
Wheres the door
Bonnie is hiding behind one of the bowling alleys
Me being surprised the ruin DLC is on my birthday🫣😶
Gotta love the dedication to even find all the secrets
Also, I think there's one more ending here. Fusion forgot to see what happens if we press no instead of yes  at the ending part before The Mimic. Please like this, so that he notices
😮
pretty rad how you do giveaways ngl
Yoo
Also what if the golf mini game give you Monty's claws, if it does can you give it to Roxy so she can maybe fight the mimic better, or is there a way to give it to Monty. If there's a mini game about Roxy can you get her eyes and put them back while she's stuck in that one part of the game? I have a bunch of questions but that's enough for now
These videos are very exciting!!
I want the game pls
U know the mimic cause Freddy to fail during the show
This ending  is LIT!!!
Hey fusion glamrock bonnie is apparently in this DLC he is in bonnie bowl there is a wet floor sight bot in the corner next to a lane which you can go through
but what happens if you do the normal ending while he has the suit on???
2:47 the entity or H.X.E.S: die to who?
maybe you can fix her
The dlc looks so cool, keep up the good work bro
you know how they are gonna release fnaf help wanted 2? there's a continuation. when you die in the elevator, the mimic is free and out now. if you check out the new game theory video, it clearly makes sense that the mimic can do anything. he was originally glitch trap. so I believe that help wanted 2 is gonna be something bigger.
My real question is did any cutscenes change before the scooped ending like how did he even get that costume
Fusion there is a room in bonnie bowling   Where  glam rock bonnie is need
Can I win
I am so, so very confused. Fazbear entertainment being ahead of technology is quite an understatement now. Edit: btw, you missed a cleaning bot at the area where you enter the daycare area, it’s at 2:40 of your part 2 video
i like a copy to play on my twitch
i got a theory that Afton is behind a like room or stage that has cameras buttons levers and fake screens that he is controlling all of these games and none of the nightguards or children in these games died instead they all are being led to one big final ending (when the fnaf games stop) and its all ganna lead back to one place Fred bears diner and then Afton will force them to relive there nightmares through the fnaf vr things and finally idk who but the new character or old probably henry idk will put the final end to all of it instead of like a fire in fnaf 6 (which clearly didn't work) bury the fazbear name destroy all the animatronics by idk taking each limb apart destroying them in a press I really don't know and finally cutseen with a big glowing sign that says fazbears closed for business and either one of three things a purple hand destroys it or it fades to black or construction workers take it down. idk just smt id like to see ig or maybe no imagine that's what happens and I predicted it from here that would be crazy
Is he going to make a video about the chica voice box thingy
In the mimic ending when it captures u the mask becomes available have u tried pressing it and does it work
Can I have the copy pls, I want the game really bad, I play on PlayStation
Idk if anyone will see this, but all throughout the game there are the wet floor bots that you can deactivate only while wearing the mask. Idk if it had any significance  but it’s something I noticed
Couldn’t quite make out the mascot suit, but was it supposed to be a lion and I’m surprised it was a scooper because that goes far back to sister location to figure out everything is connected or is there some canon event everyone’s trying to do a multi-verse thingy
Give this man an oscar!
Also you need to find bonnie
gimme security breach on steam
Wow these games are absolutely insane! :D
I really want to play the dlc
Sooo goood
That sure not a mod because the map and when Cassie touchy the button it was much cleaner
Maybe you can find Monty’s claws and Roxy’s eyes and do something with them, find all the collectibles and all the yellow bots and go down the slide again. Maybe a different ending?
I think a ending is going to be repairing all the anamatronics but completing all the video game consoles. He already has chicas, he knows where montys is, and we need to find Roxys and maybe freddy
You can help Roxy
There's gotta be something with Chica's voice box maybe even an ending where you repair the animatronics
The DLC is SOOOO good
I love your content and gameplay!!!😁
I figured out you can give chica back her voice box
Great vids you always make great fnaf vids
I think it’s a fredbear suit
Cant wait if there is another video
Bonnie’s in the game in bowling there’s a tunnel you can find Bonnie
YOU ON TRENDING OMG
The dlc thow was in sane bro 😎
Maybe you could try place the voice box inside chica while shes frozen in the kitchen and repair chica? But that’s just a theory, A GAME THEORY
brooooo that is sick btw I did every thing you said and I really want security breach
hello i hope everyone is haveing a great day
Yo this man posts like crazy
This is crazy I LOVE FNAF SB IS MY FAVORITE
Man I love these videos
I have a theory that Gregory is a robot I know that’s already a theory but you know that Cassie has to use the vanny mask to use the Monty shooter thing Gregory didn’t have to use any mask so does that  Kinda prove it?
Nice day to you
i like watching these videos with multiple parts
Me please !!!
Hello
Got two more hotdogs 🌭 🌭 😊
Can I get a copy of a dlc pls
Have you found glamrock bonnie
YEAH
Yo
I want the DLC
slay
grahhhhhhh
This DLC was way better than I have expected
Play more please
If i read the comics/books i would know more but this mimic seems pretty mysterious
Hey fusionZgamer  can you play purple in killer?
Fusion where you get chicas voice box you can give it to her where she’s deactivated
free stuff or else
Dlc looks great and really fun
Hey Fusion, there is a secret AR collectible. It's in the Daycare area, but it's before you enter the playground area and meet Sun. You go around the corner of the platform and have to put the V.A.N.N.I mask on. Hopes this helps. Also, sorry for being so long.
I found bonnie in bonny bowel, remember the giant bowling ball!? well thier is a secret entrence around that erea and thier youll find glamrock bonnie
Waiting for part 8
hi good videos loved it
what about the gator golf arcade
when i saw the chicka game in the room my head said theres probably one for the charcters but i know there probably isnt but if you could get all of the missing pieces from the animtronics oh my goodness!!!! keep up the amazing work!!!! one of my favorite youtube series!!
I would love to see more of this game! It looks really fun! Hope you're having fun Fusion! Also, 13 hours of play?! Are you okay!?
What if there’s a part from each animatronic that you get from each of there respective games (gator golf, Chica feeding frenzy, etc)
Springlock suits as merch is a perfect idea right?
Your videos are the best
Can I plz have security breach for PS4 bcz I have liked subscribed and commented
FUSIONZGAMER dipping a whole series in about 24 hours this guys crazy omg
pls pick me
We appreciate your dedication fusion
This is one of the best dlc's ive seen!
GIVE ME THAT MASSIVE BREACH OF SECURITY
tbh fusion your prob the first person to get all of the endings to ruin die hard fnaf fan 👍👍👍
You missed Glamrock bonnie
don't you think there's a reason you got chicas beak/voice box by playing her arcade game
OOOooo what if theres an arcade in the raceway that gives you roxy's eyes after completing it like the chica one and when she asks for her eyes when she grabs you, you can give them to her and then another ending is unlocked involving roxy. That'd be so cool
I can’t believe Gregory tbh I was NOT expecting that😂
I wonder If there is an ending if you do nothing in the beginning and don’t help the mimic/Gregory.
Love watching your videos it’s the best part of my day!
Milk
my fav youtuber
You can find Bonnie if you go past the bowling wall at the end of the right alley
FUSION Z GO BACK TO BONNIE BOWL BEFORE YOU GET THE LAST NODE AND GO TO THE RIGHT ALLEY THERES A SECRET ROOM AT THE BACK OF THE ALLEY
I think there is a special "true" ending for repairing all of the animatronics from their parts that you win from the scattered arcade machines.
Can't wait for it to come out on xbox
What about that one animatronic in the beginning when you go down the stairs
Pizza Plex is completely destroyed all the animatronics are malfunctioning even Freddy Freddy's evil now I miss him open the next  security breach game I hope this one is a good one
MIMIC!
FREDDY FAZBEAR!!!
Sister location ending
Im SOOOOO hyped!!!!
Damn seeing that suit on the mimic was surprising!
What if the suit that the mimic is wearing at the end could be the first fredbear suit (just a thought(
Saw a secret online so if you go to the Bonnie bowl section and go to the very last lane there is a secret room with glamrock bonnie laying there dead
I respect your getting all the endings and secrets your content is great w vid
I’m like on edge since he found the voice box, maybe that’s means you can find Roxann’s eyes too,  maybe there is another ending
Just found this channel and I love it, immediate sub
I love fusionzgamer
so i’m not gonna spoil anything but if you go back to bonnie bowl one of the lanes you can walk into and there is an easter egg(atleast that’s what i’ve been told i don’t actually have the actual game yet)
Fusion I just figured out that Bonnie actually is in the game but he dead and broken up
i am so late
Shadowed Roxy is my favorite shadowed.
on my first play through I found the camera, the secret camera and I didn't know what it was for, so I just ignored it
Candy cadet is my dad
Nice video
Hello🐻🐰🐥🦊
Hi
How u so energized?
Okay the minic ending is bad when you just die. But i think the reason that glitchtrap is trying to let you get killed is because he doesn't want you too free the mimic but when you press that button sealing glitchtrap and you go to the mimic. Wish we saw more of vanny to be honest she barley was in the entire story and should of been one of the people chasing you down in the ruin dlc plus you have her mask. But what if vanny died in the ruin falling rocks and stuff
Hi
it doesn't work for me do you have an idea why?
But wait since the vanny ending is the true one, headless Freddy is canon since Gregory took his head, but since it's the true ending Gregory doesn't know william afton, none of the burntrap ending happened then? And if the vanny ending is the true ending, how did the pizzaplex collapse ? We don't even know
Man RUIN is awesome
a security breach copy  is hopefully mine :)
you are so geneuros for giving fnaf sb to others for fre!
The thumbnail made me crack up lol!!!
12 hours is wild💀(respect the dedication)
In the book that the mimic was in. He was made by an inventor with a son. The son carried around a tiger plushie The sun ran into the road one day and he died in the mimic did what the sun did carry around. A tiger plushie. the father got so mad at this. He beated the mimic and then the mimic learned how to be mean and the mimic in the ending you got was in a tiger suit. Hope this helps.
W dlc
why does the suit look like some highschool football mascot suit lol
There will be a surprise if you get to top scorer the eyes
Potato
Find Roxy race game
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS I FIRST SAW YOU AT  slendytubbies AND BEEN A EVERY SENCE fan.
I don't see any of these ending being cannon
The Monty Golf arcade machine still exists. Maybe try finding and completing arcade games related to each of he characters like you did for Chica?
Find Roxy race game
I’m confused I did everything and it didn’t work 🙁
In the books the mimic likes to wear costumes so it makes sense why it was wearing one
Great vid, that old mascot costume is so cool.
Maybe you have to get a perfect score on Monte golf to get his hands
Fnaf security breach pls!
My game wont let me play it
I'm already subscribed
What if u could save the animatronics instead of leaving them
Thanks fusion truthfuly putting in the work for these games. that said the endings for this game dlc or not are lackluster at best
Tip: if you have chicas voice box when she falls asleep in the bathroom you can give it back to her.
mimic is furry comfirmed (extreamly bad joke)
its not over yet. you still have not used the beak from previous episode. i bet there is something to do with it
I've done it
Hey I love your videos and I hope I can play security breach because I don’t have a lot of money so thank you for the video
I like how no one is like "can i have security breach mr.fusionzgamer"
Yes u put the voice box in when she is asleep in the bathrooms
I love your videos I watch them all the time
I think the chica beak is for when she deactivated in the bathroom. You might be able to put her voice box and beak back on if you go back to that part(just a theory).
Bro Plot Twist For FNAF
Maby fnaf sb megashatter
Bro...take a 12 hour nap after these videos lol
I didn’t know fnaf security breach ruin DLC released on my birthday 😦
I have a small theory about the mask and that is that it takes you to the fourth dimension. If i went to the second dimension and there was a ball inside a circle the 2nd dimension people would think its impossible to get it out but we can't just pull it from the hole and that's kinds what happens with the mask as we think its impossible to just walk through walls but if the mask makes you fourth dimensional letting you just walk through stuff .Also a fourth dimensional object in the third dimension would disappear and reappear which seems to be what happens to us as robots see us doing impossible things walking over nothing and not being able to see us until we reappear because of glitch trap .What do you think about this theory
What fi it is the endo from glamm rock bonnie and siuts up as a Mascotte from pizzaplax or it is bonnie ho gaht replest from monnti and hie is seeking revenge. or it is the endo from afton and the endo survived it but i don't Know  🤔🤔🤨
i want to see the ending's myself
Just testing smth out. Elysia, did you find me? Hehehehe
Can you skip to the chapters, or do you have to go through the game again
Man deserves an Oscar
Whatever you want.
What will the next fnaf game be😮
Interesting
10:29 I wanna say that the suit might be and old mascot costume from Henry or Afton’s High school or it can be a scraped character from the franchise
The DLC looks fantastic dude im super excited
Bacon 7
Where will the new game three just came out a second ago
I know everyone wants this but. What if you didn't turn off Roxanne
Hey thanks for giving a good playthrough i like how you explain everything 😊
the dedication mate
When you shut down Roxy. you can press a button to stop
You have to give chica’s beak back after she shuts down in the bathroom
I love the dlc so far im so excited
That was fun
Holy moly this DLC is a lot bigger and better than i thought it would be
Ima small YouTuber fusion I need a new game to play on my channel I’ve been a fan for a while now and my gamer tag is big_billy131 Or Big_Billy thank you for making god tier content
My guess for whatever the mimic is where is that it's an old suit from fredbears. It has that look that original chuck e. Cheeses and showbiz pizza characters have, and steel wool said they want to make a fredbear game so maybe this is a hint of some kind
I have a theory on who the guy that chases you in the end is (without the weird suit) I looked a little bit and just as the thing passes you the walkie talkie he stands in a weird stance before standing up straight and tall, and I noticed with the dim blue light behind him he's actually standing like how Michael Afton stops to stand while walking past all of the people happy for him and what he's done in Fnaf Sister Location. Though it was hard to see him and I could be completely wrong, but I think we freed Michael from the ruins of the pizza plex. Another reason why I think this is because we know that before being burnt down, the pizzaplex is where Michael lived having his room from Sister Location somewhere hidden in the pizza plex, making it a more reasonable guess.
This dlc is insane
My mans uploaded 7 episodes in one day lets take a moment of silence ❤
For those who found the cameras and didn’t get the secret ending, you actually have to get a checkpoint after you find that secret cam.
What about the minigolf minigame?
New Ending? 🎉🎉🎉
I was thinking that if you play all the arcade games you might be able to return the animatronic parts to their owners, maybe even get Roxy her eyes back?
I Wonder what happens when you finish the Gator arcade too? Do you get something part of Monty like chica’s voice box from the last video??
😢I missed by 4h
I want fnaf security breach sooo bad
Try and find all the working arcade machines and bring the parts back to the animatromics
Gregory should burn in hell for being a traitor 😡
Hey fusion go to the big bowling ball and go behind the ball and you can find  glam rock Bonnie dead on the ground
Hi😃
This man is a legend
I stayed up all night
I really REALLY Wish Bonnie is in the next episode
Hey fusion i wont say much but bonnie is in the game in a room for you to find ik how much you beem wanting to see him but if you do want me to tell you where i will but i asume you want to find him on your own but yeah!!!!!
I love watching your videos. I always watch your videos whenever a new game comes out
everyone get to bed‼️
helo guys
I want to play  that game it's good
your the only fnaf content creator i love keep up the great work
Hey how are you
fusion there is a secret area to find bonnie's body around bonnie bowl but you need to hack through walls to find it easier or just look at a video to find out where to find it :D
Fusion plz pick me to win I've been trying to get security breach for so long I've also been subbed for years I asked rexter to say hi for me
Glam rock Bonnie was found https://youtu.be/IeUvSPe1X8c
Hi
''whatever you want''   but fr this man right here is a legend 7 parts within 8 hours its crazy been subbed for years now n i aint missed a single video
Nice
Alright nro get some rest haha!
Hey maybe let other people play before you go putting the endings in your preview. Jfc
Maybe if you go find some other games like that you can find Maltese claws Roxy's eyes and maybe even Bonnie's bowling sing who knows Bonnie could so be in😮
I like how fusion is so funny, and he always communicates with the viewers during serious times
This DLC has been a rollercoaster of emotions and I love it! Glad to see Fusion playing it entirely
I think this is the only “happy” ending for the dlc💀
We have to find a multiple secret things like Mondays Clause maybe even Bonnie something😮 maybe you can repair that Freddy
I love your videos I hope I get the game I've been wanting it for so long
Hi
Bro they are coming out so fast
Do you guys see the face inside the costumes mouth?-
I forgot which chapter but all ik is that when you go to Bonnies bowling alley there is a part in the room that leads to a secret room that has glam rock bonnie hidden in it
Chapter 7 is the best chapter
DLC is awesome but the endings are too dark for FNaF
Tomorrow is my birthday
Im excited for more of your content!!! This is amazing!!
7:27 lets be honest, we all saw the jumpscare coming
DLC so cool
Last video was crazy talking about Doritos shooting milk a meaningless secret ending that’s still confusing to me😂
Is that the all the endings because in the trailer there is a part in the ending where we face that rabbit thing that's following us the entire DLC.
lolol
what happened to cassie tho? in this ending she doesn’t die in the elevator so what happens to her?
The mimic turned into a furry😱
That animatronic is a lion
when he stays up all night
my goodness. that ending was somewhat unexpected, after all, who ever thought the scooper would return in a brand-new form? Anyways fusion, keep up the work. ya never let us down and you have fantastic commitment. (though you should take a break)
I LOVE THIS  serious
Haha I just legit spoiled myself, I dont even own sb
i feel bad for fusionZgamer
Bro this game is awesome
Always come to you first for game content, Always a lovely reaction!
gaming
That’s a crazy suit at the end
These ending are shocking.
Fusión
When you’re a Bonnie’s bowling alley, where the big bowling balls are and with you hack the walls and you could see Bonnie
Keep up the work
https://youtu.be/hfy6X1VYIZI
i fell that there's another ending were you fix all of the animatronics thy it bc roxy said give me back my eyes ???!!! try to find her eyes
I do like the dlc but the endings are not very good this one is the best the other two were so horrible
This dlc is so good but the ending was unexpected
cool
cant wait to see the other secret endings
Keep on makin the vids!
Can I get it
🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 ⬜⬛🟪⬜⬛🟪🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛🟪 🟪🟪⬛⬛⬛🟪🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪
I think theres an 4th secret ending
this dlc is awesome
Thank you fusion for trying so hard to finish and find all the secrets of ruin
7
I’m a sub and I really want a copy because I want to play with my friends.
It kinda reminds me of baby, it’s big.
What if you save roxy? I remember there being a cancel button when the puzzle pops up, so maybe try that
i don't really know much about the mimic but it looks so good , this DLC is top tier for me rn.
Im still feel kinda bad for roxy tbh like how she litteraly sacrifice herself to help her out from that place
Its so cool
Cool vid
Ngl the Glitchtrap in this game reminds me of Spiderman 2099 wait Spingtrap 2099😂😂
Five nights at security breach, Xbox disc
hey when you go to roxy/ the last security node  you can press esc to exit the connecters to power her off you should try that
To me I feel it is a lot more to the DLC then these couple endings cuz in the first game they had a little bit more endings then the DLCs endings so I feel like they have more but we have not found them
That could give montys claws like how chicks feeding frenzy shooter game give her voice box
I liked
Thank you for being so dedicated Fusion
I want security breach please
I realized it gives you a hint because in every odd numberd chapter with a camera has it
Anyone remember the arcade machine of Monty golf
BONNIE EXISTS IN THE MAP AT THE BIG BOWLING BALL THERE IS LIKE A DOOR THING THAT YOU CANT GET INTO BUT WITH HACKS (so far) YOU CAN OPEN IT AND SEE BONNIE (he is dead)
The possibilities this could bring?
Love your content keep up the great work
You are the best
feels like yesterday when you were doing a playthrough of Dark Deception
Im in love with ur gameplays when i had corona i watched ur sb gameplay everyday
What animal was the mimics suit?
Bro completed the DLC in a day, found most, if not all, endings AND , cherry on top, kept uploading almost hourly. Say what u will, this guy is a hero and legend. You won yourself a subscriber, bro 👍🏻
i have your dog hostage post the next video otherwise ill over flow him with treats
please let it be me pal! ill comment this on every video!
here's a few theories: Cassie is an Emily Gregory is an Afton Gregory and Cassie are reincarnations of CC and Cassidy (basically the two halves of Golden Freddy)
hello !
Hi
hi
Gregory is a real piece of work isn’t he?
Give chica her voice box in the glamrock beauty salon
You forgot a item it was in an restroom where chica is chasing u
You could repair freddy with chica beak from last episode
I really hope this works❤❤❤
Crazy endings crazy puzzles this dlc is crazy
What happens if you press no on the machine and don't let out the mimic and just continue
I love the vids
You should take chicas beak when you first meet her or take it to her when she sits in Roxy's salon.
Can I get a copy of breach I need to make up for the FNAF games that I did not play😅
give it to me
I don't know if anyone saw this, but I was watching Dawko's playthrough and I spotted an arcade cabinet that disappears once he put the Vanni mask on. It had Fredbear on the side, it could be really important I think!
The main ending should be the canon one
This has to be the best game I have ever seen in a long time and thank you fusion for making all these great videos but please remember to take care of yourself and get some shut eye!
PLS I NED IT
this is a great dlc
This DLC is amazing!! Was not expecting all of this from it!
you already know matpats gonna go crazy over this dlc
There’s a bunny location shows you the real Bonnie what is the activity cleaning bot
Hi
I totally didnt binge watch this all at 10 AM
Oh yeah
This is an amazing dlc
Nah this is just a mod 💀💀💀
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE GIVE ME THE COPY I'VE NEVERED PLAYED PLEASE
You missed somthing I think I was scrolling threw tiktok and I saw someone go in to one of the bowling pits or whatever you call them and saw Bonnie there all I know is that there’s a secret to see Bonnie
6:28. New skin unlocked: Paper Shredded Mascot Suit 😂!
Hamburger=free security breach?
I love this
I joked last night before Ruin release about Mimic mimicing the Scooper in the ending...  THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A JOKE, HOW COULD THEY ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT THE SCOOPER
Wow! Just wow that is amazing!
Hey fusion! Ive been watching you for a while now and you always manage to cheer me up

I think the mimic was actually trying to pretend that it was Gregory and trying to make Cassidy think that Gregory is evil which he probably is in the mimic just doesn’t know but we also kill it and I think that in the next Fnaf game that costume will be revealed
Please pick me I love your vids I even got my little brothers into watching you!!
Please pick me I love your vids I even got my little brothers into watching you!!

This thumbnail looks crazy
lets take a moment to appreciate this man. he literally blasted through this entire dlc and uploaded all parts within 8 hours. this guy deserves an award.
you got this man
These endings are cool. The betrayal from Gregory wasn’t expected to me. Edit: before anything happens, I meant when he left us for dead. Not the mimic part.
Now he can get some sleep
Tbh i respect the grind
THIS SERIES WAS INSAAAAAANE!!! MY BRAIN HRUTS FORM THE LORE AND THEORIES BUT THIS IS AWESOME. AND DUDE! FUZION IS A DARN LEGEND TO STAY  UP LIKE A OWL AND PLAY THIS GAME TO THE END! HE'S A LEGEND I'M SO HAPPY AND HYPED ABOUT THIS SERIES. IT WAS SO MUCH FUN! FUzion! Please get some well sleep you deserve it
Nicely done and still wondering on what else could there be left. (Man MatPat will love to see all of this... whenever he gets to it) 😆
FUSION BONNIE IS IN THAT GAME. go to bonnies bowling alley when you get there you have to delete a wall its where the bowling ball goes along with the pins it says freddy fazbears pizza place on it go inside and keep going then you should see glamrock bonnie (ps please metion me, me and my brother are huge fans
fusion i love how you spend all night makeing vids
Calm down
Hi I love you videos and they always make me smile keep up the good work
Isnt it weird that we haven’t seen Freddy with his head like it is shown on the Steam page? Like the real Glamrock Freddy?
Whaterer you want
This is so cool that Fusion continues to play endlessly to find the community the secret endings. It’s hard to tell what the suit is animal wise. Maybe a Lion since it has sharp teeth and hair kinda in the shape of a mane. It looks all battered so it must be old. It has a backwards J letter on the clothing so maybe that could mean something
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh                    give me my gameeeeeeeeeeeee
He means he is GONNA find every secret-
Idk bout anyone but Eclipse is probaboy my new favourite animatronic lol
if you want to find more secrets in the DLC this channel  exposes secrets like were to find glam rock Bonnie and how to fix Chica https://www.youtube.com/@FazFaz
Hi
If u go behind Bonnie bowl u can actually find Bonnie  decommissioned with four wet sign bots surrounding him
I really want security breach I’m a big fan btw I watch your friendly neighborhood vidoes  Also cant WAIT to see you in the fnaf movie
the devil works fast but fuzion works faster frfr
Fusioooooooooooooooooooon Can i please get Security breach??? My user is ArXb those capitals and no spaces
gregory is so wrong bro😭😭😭
I'm surprised he did all of this in one whole day
Hey fusion!
we all appreciate how you would stay up all night just to play Fnaf :D
Bread👍
Bro imagine after this you go to game theory
I think the suit was a Gregory suit
I was correct. He did do this all in one day.😂😂😂😂😂
Glitchtrap
Give me fnaf plssssssssssss  i have ps
You missed Bonnie he’s in the bowling area where you said were you seen that vent in Bonnie’s bowl you missed Bonnie there was a way to get in there you have to wear your mask
hi
What about chica beak?
i want sb and ruin
I’ve waited for so long
Which one is the Canon event🗿
Do we think we’re gonna see more costumes for the mimic?
guys guys listen how did the mimic get that suit like how where did he get it from also did Vanny survive the canon ending in SB like can some explain to me if they can lol
I don't know...maybe That is not the real ending...maybe
This shit was mind blowing
Chapter nine
Hey can you go back to that one part in the game and select no to see what it does
When he says he will find every secret he will
I want security breach
fnaf sb
I wonder what happens if you complete the Monty's golf game, do you get his part as well?     Are there other places to use those?
Those orange colored cleaning bots must be linked to the girl from princess quest
New mob games pic
The suit the mimic wears… almost looks like an old Highschool mascot costume… is it just me who thinks this?
......
That is why I love watching his videos
You got this fusion!
I found glenrock Bonnie don't all the way to the left when the big ball at the corner take the power of pat pat and go to the bowling thing right next to it.
Bro really did 7 vids in 7 hours
Man game theory is gonna have a blast with this lol
help
Yo I haven’t play the game yet but im a big fan
What if you don’t shut down Roxy
the endings kinda sucked they were just teases for something to come the experience was short just run and do nodes and overall it was decent its atleast better than normal security breach
The suit the mimic was wearing, is it Kelly's suit from the books?
Bro ya
Keep up the good work
Hey fusion, a quick thing for when you start hacking, at bonnie bowl, use free cam, and youll find something wich everyone wanted.
W fusion
I found glamrock Bonnie
Loved watching all of these!!!! So glad you started early!
The best game ever
I love u fusion z gamer I watched u ever since I was a kid
Were is the blob??????
Someone give this man a raise for all the effort he puts in
can you make more killer in purple 2 vids cuz like i really want to know if killer in purple 2 has more endings but all of your vids are nice
Hmm
I have an idea based by you finding Chica’s voice box. I seen on YouTube that you can give it back to her. You can also try to beat the Monty Golf Arcade score (which is 26 I think) and maybe you will get his claws??
I love how the DLC is being done so far, its amazing
Maybe the tales from the pizzaplex can tell us more about the mimic
Hi
Seeing the scooper is terrifying, it knew where the mimic was exactly.
Let me won a security breach for Xbox
Who is the mimic? A.aftonB.a virusC.michel
Absolutely love this series, I can't wait for the next part!
But is Gregory evil cuz he killed Cassie or is that a plot for a new game where Cassie escape’s 😅😂
I think this can be more scarier just take out going through walls and stuff
I tried to play it only to realize that I need the base game 🥲
I can't belive the Mimic just died like that!😮
Plz
Nice❤
This dude really bested in the others when this came out.
Wow this is great
👍
When u gonna do hacks
I might’ve missed it but did you give chica her voice box back?
Scott is the best
I can't wait to try this eventually
There's a secret we're you play rock paper scissor with the glitch bunny I think if you say no on the computer
Hi
W vid
Wait a second you can finish candy cadets story cant you. Since the coins can stack.
Fusion works so hard just for us to have all the secrets and all the endings to these fnaf games. We should be so grateful that he is staying up all night just for these videos. Love the vids❤
You can actually place chickas voice box back into her head when she is in the stalls deactivated.
In episode three in the bathroom you missed a chest
find bonnie he is in the game somewhere
i am in love with ruin already!! it looks so amazing!!!
I like FNAF ruin
Liked subscribed, entry no.7 am no going to heaven 😅
lets do this
fusionzgamer is one of the best horror you tubers in my opinion i hope he can bring more good content like this.
Boo!! Did I scare you….. I bet I did.
Pov: you love fusionzgamer but you never join giveaways but you do it now and you don't win so you do this to try to win but he says nah not for you bc you doing this but the reverse trick and then you win. Lol YAYAYAY
Iove fnaf 2
i enjoy watching these vids so much
cant what for part 8
The SPOOKIEST
Here's a thought. I remember that you got chica's voice box from an arcade game, what if you can get something for the other animatronics from other arcade games?
Whatever you want
I can't believe you found chica's voice box Fusion.
Bread 👍
Good game play
IMPORTANT FUSION!! THE WET FLOOR BOTS IS FOR A SECRET WALL IN BONNIE BOWL. ITS NEXT   TO THE BIG BOWLING BALL IT WILL REVEAL SOMTHING IMPORTANT ABOUT BONNIE
Someone should let him know that apparently bonnies body is actual hidden in the bowling area of the game
This was sooo cool!
Matt pat is having a field day with this dlc
THIS IS SO COOL
wait wheres glamrock freddy he was front and center in the promotional art with a destroyed design but we only saw a headless prototype so far
I have a theory about that, what if he was a prototype... What if he's the first animatronic ever created? A animatronic gone wrong... He has the same feature as William after/spring trap, there is a face in the mask, which means it's a whole new animatronic, or whatever it is. although this ending is likely to not be the true one, it's possible, but it's probably not the true ending, because that's a whole new animatronic, and because of that, it couldn't mimic Gregory's voice.
They have to make another DLC I mean I don't know how they would do it but they have to the saddest part is Roxy
Fuzion there have been a lot of videos where they find glamrock Bonnie body
Why do I feel like fusionzgamer would be the only horror content creator that would die (in game) just because of his curiosity 😂😂😂 I do love the content I appreciate the work keep going👍
I would like an xbox copy of security breach fusion im a big fan
The Loin or Tiger's design is creepy.
Ok, in the full mimic cutscene, you find it already wearing that suit and as cassie runs out you can see a blue bird costume with a heart apron, i think the mimic wears a diffferent suit in every ending. That bird suit is probably tied to anither ending, wether that is acheived by repairing all the animatronics like with chica and her voice box, disabling all wet floor signs or getting all collectables. I dont know. Havent seen anyone get that yet.
Bruh all these endings are mid.
GG!
When it asks you to proceed with the machine try pressing no
I tried to play fnaf sb dlc today and  I spawned in floating not being able to move the brightness was also really high and I tried everything but nothing worked 😔 I wanted to play this for so long and if anyone knows how to fix this PLEASE tell me bc I’m a big fan and really wanted to play this
Don’t do every single Tío Subaru one hour two hours ago
HOIIII GIVE ME SB
Bro, slow down on the DLC
LESS GOOO POOKIE BEAR
There is another secret in Bonnie’s bowling ball
Fusion I didn't get to see any of the videos because I was asleep well it was the dead of night but your videos are very funny keep making some good content and I missed out a couple of videos but I love your channel though
Exactly ckuma
I would love to play the game on my xbox but i may not win so whoever wins hope you have a good time
hi
That is a crazy suit! This all getting better and better!
I really want the fnaf security breach game fusion because fnaf is one of my favorite series and I want to start making video on the game
I really want the dlc i already liked the video and subscribe and turned on notifications plz it’s if you want to give me the dlc can you I would relly appreciate it
What if you find all the animatronics parts that Gregory took in arcade machines near the last time we see some of the animatronics then give them back
Hey
Fusion I've love your videos and I've always wanted to play fnaf security breach❤❤
Ooooo
The scooper ending seems to be the cannon one
Bro your so fast 😮!
The Poocsing Room
I think the mimic suit is actually fredbear
You mist a part in bonnie bowl  where you see  glam rock bonnie laying on the ground and around him are the mini robots you have to deactivate
I think Cassies Father is probably Micheal Afton >>
Done!
bro a scooping room??
I did all of this in order and it didnt work for me and im so confused
Is there an ending where you find glenbrook
Yo fusion Ik u sleep but WAKE UP IVE BEEN WAITING FOR A VID
Hello
The dlc ending is awesome looking, sad I can play It
This is shocking
Fuzion z gamer!
I've been watching send trap One To chapter seven I've been watching the series for about a 174   minutes.
nice video hope your doing well love your videos
the dlc looks so good
Heyy fusion lowkey hear me out you know helpi is "helping" cassie right will i starting to think thats not the case cause helpi was all a board abt deactivating the security nodes  for cassie to find "Gregory" so helpi knew that the mimic was down there and he was helping him or another thought that helpi who cassie was talking to the entire game wasnt helpi at all cause in the second ending you got you saw helpi and gregory together with vanessa how could that be possible if helpi was in cassie's mind the entire time "helping" her- no helping the mimic and what other people believe is that Vanessa is vanny (which is what i believe) and she was in on well everything but not actually in pizzaplex anymore (i think) cause like we saw in the ending in this part we saw the mimic in a costume in that ending (the second one) it could also be the mimic in a costume a freshely new costume, also another thing about helpi when cassie where in that "safe" room where vanny's mask got stuck on her, "gregory" and helpi agreed that glitchtrap couldnt get in the room but after a while he did and helpi gave the best exuse ever (i dont remember what he said but to gist it up) "oh he most've broken through" yea no thats not the case helpi you let him in cause you knew that glitchtrap would hurt cassie somehow if she had the mask on so you purposely stuck the mask to her face during hoping she would fet cought and if that failed they always had the mimic as a back up.  (Sorry if its alot and it doesnt make sence but its what i got)
Whatever you want
Ruins the ruin ruin ruins(can I have the DLC please)
These videos still hit different.
Fusion if you go in Bonnie bowl to the back corner where the broken bowling ball is with the glitch traveling through it and find a way into the hol in that wall Glamrock Bonnie is back there
Fusion you can find Bonnie in the game hidden I won’t say where but he’s in the bowling alley
sick ending
Yo! That is insane!
Betrayal ending I believe might be cannon
what if the mimic was a different type of freddy in the 1970's because gregory said he was in there for a long time
The mimic is it a Fred bear costume
Wath ever you want
Bye
The scooper?!?!?
hi i love your vids
Good luck everyone may the best comment win!
I'm more worried about Chicas nonexistent face then anything lol😂
Could be chipper from Scott’s old games?
This commitment to keeping us updated is amazing!
Old sport weed is legal in Canada
Beep boop if I get security breach I play on Xbox  one so if I get a pc version of the of the game I won't be able to play it
Quick thing to say you can find Bonnie’s body in Bonnie bowl
look its a Taco!🌮
White tiger?
DLC dlc dlc dlc
The game is awesome
this game was so addicting to watch! I can't wait for the future of steel wool
I cant believe the ending
Five Nights at Freddy’s Security Breach
Plz me it is my birthday and I play on ps4 i have always wanted to play
e
Is that the blob
this is crazy
lol
I think that when you beat all arcades and get all parts you could build the animatronics  idk if it's true but it's an idea you could try  Edit:if there are anymore arcades
I want a copy
This guy goes so quick like dang
Wow
so please
I love it how on the literal first day of release, we have the entire game completely covered. I love this channel.
and im a youtuber
I hope you had great fun in this gsme because i enjoyed watching you play it
this game is awesome
Did you find where Bonnie is in Bonnie bowl
hi can I have a copy please
fusion is crazy (in a good way)  but i do like how you can feel cassie's emotions through the voice acting. they did good with cassie's voice actor. they did good with all the voice actors. but i do wish that they could make merch from the game almost like BATIM. but its fnaf sb. but it doesnt even look like fredbear. it looks like a lion tbh. its hella ugly man. at least he dead
the next micheal lol
The suit looked like a weird freddy and  foxy mash up
Theirs one thing I want to know where is DJ music man?
Beep boop
3:22 Fusion: For 12, 13 hours Helpi: - If you are tired, why not take a break?
wait didn she deactive roxxane or bring her back to the good side
That mascot costume that the mimic is in has some type of coat that kinda looks like foxy’s coat but that does not look like a fox it looks kind of like a lion
Is that a lion suit???????
Bro this DLC is cool! And also nice work😄

Go to checa with the voice box.!!!!!!
TacocaT
Anoying
I love the energy that you have fusion it makes your channel an everyday watch for me ❤❤❤
I was waiting for this then forgot about it after doing a lot of stuff and just saw it
I got a PlayStation I don't think I could get one😂
I am dying to see part 8!
It sorta looks a liom suit, maybe a lion was in fredbears and that was his suit, it looks similar to glitchtraps mascot suit but just a lion, although it could be foxy
Wow 12-13 hours that's alot
click click for a cope of security breach my sister wants to play it.
Really loved this ending!
Pls give me security breach
i kinda wanna see what chica’s beak does lol
Man, this guy spends the whole night beating this DLC when he could've been sleeping. Such a true legend man, and plus recording for people who don't have SB their selves? Such a big applause for him man.
I wonder if the Mimic was the one to draw the pictures of the different endings then, since it was acting as if it was Gregory. And the drawings themselves have some... wild implications. That I remember, there's one for the Disassemble Vanny ending, the Afton ending, and I think one of Gregory driving the truck? They can't *all* have happened, so how are there drawings of them??   Maybe Scott's planning to introduce the Fazbear Extended Universe lmao
behind one of the Bonnie bowl Lanes you can find glam-rock Bonnie
Omega pog dlc
I HAVE A THEORY!! So, Cassie has been talking about her dad often. The Faz Wrench and the lunch boxes. WHAT IF, NOW HEAR ME OUT. What if Cassie is Charlie Emily? And her dad is Henry Emily? Since the Faz Wrench could remind her of Henry's wrench. Now I haven't really read the books, but did Henry make the mimic? Because why would the mimic want her? Not anybody else, just her. Just a small theory, I HOPE YOU READ THIS FUSION!! ❤
Love you staying up to play this, I love this secret ending!
If you go to Bonnie bowl and make it to the part where there is a HUGE bowling ball looking thing you can go into one of the bowling alley’s and there is a HUMONGOUS secret there
I wanna tell you again SLEEP
When you start hacking in the game you should hack behind the bowling lanes due to a secret area being back there
Hey I have a question so I subed and like and I’m wondering what if I’m a Nintendo player?
Dis epic
can I have sb I really want to play and I want to play the ruin dlc and im a huge fan go yours
W fusion
Hmmmmm
Nah cuz like- Fusion needs to go to sleep fr fr
WHAT IS HAPPENING
It seems way shorter than I thought it would be , a lot less exploring and free roam then I thought more of a straight line narrative
Fnaf be hitting different
Great game
Check Bonnie’s Bowling more throughly…👀
This dlc proves that steel wool can make good fnaf content. The future looks bright
I can tell the dedication is real with you, Brendan! That was a heck of an all-nighter! Keep up the amazing content :)
I want security breach for switch
AIT NO WAY HE PLAYED THE DLC IN ONE NIGHT hes a real fnaf fan
i dont think the scooping ending is the cannon one only because we never talked to gregory again, you would think the ending would go a little more in depth with it like the elevator ending did.
Hello
Can I get it when it comes out on switch if  I win please?
ruin might be better than the base game ngl
Whatever you want
This was a very good Dlc steel wool did not disappoint
Hope you get a good night’s rest fusion! o7
You can find Bonnie and bonny boul
Pls a copy of security breach
you might have saw me on you're other vids please ive never played fnaf :C
I entered
Hi
ABABABABABA I want FNAF sb!
Im so confused though. Is afton glitchtrap 2.0? Or is he the mimic? Because those eyes were something very different. Also, it looks like we have mutliple sb endsings as canon. Princessquest ending, and the afton ending.
My favorite thing is watching you play fnaf any game and playing fnaf
Well he is not sleeping
Ok soooo I tried to download it but it didn’t work and I know why its because I don’t have the first sb bc I deleted it so ima redownload it and get the ruin
There's got to be an ending where you give all the animatronics their parts back
Can I please have the game
Cool
whatever i want
It had to dress for the occasion- What if theres more than one mimic though?  Excited to see the other endings/easter eggs you find and imma try and get my sister to watch it.
Are you an og fan Of fnaf?
The best videos❤ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yeeeeessss!!
Please 🙏 don’t add more endings
What is the mimic and how does everyone knows about them
cant believe its free
This is so cool!
Heree
AHHHH OHMAYGOT
try to fix Roxy
Press no when it says shut down system on the computer at the end
I don't know how you haven't passed out yet. Nice videos
Man this dlc has me excited to play
Wooooooow
You can actually find a destroyed bonnie in a hole in the wall in bonnie bowl. Not a lie, it is true. It should be behind he bowling pin machines that push them. It should be at the farthest lane to the right. It will be blocked by something and to move it you must deactivate a wet floor but next to it
Hey Fusiongamer i love your Videos so much keep up this work❤
I can’t get the dlc because you can’t get it if you have the disc version
This dlc was good but empty I felt disappointed and I don’t know why
The Mimic at the one secret ending be like: *I’m bout to chase this child WITH STYLE*
Ho else hates that Glamrock Freddy is now mean
what do you meen one of the mimic suits at 6:35 ???
Das crazy
@thegametheorist
I think there might be one more ending. Notice that when you have to deactivate Roxy because she's the last node, you can exit the same way as with the other nodes, basically refusing to sacrifice her for Gregory.  And yes, I liked my own comment to get attention.
Make sure to get good sleep fuzion❤❤
why did you decide to stay up all night? rest can help if you rest then you can focus more I would know sort of
I honestly love this DLC it has more going and gives new possiblites for ideas
At the top of Bonnie bowling next to a cleaning bot there is a entry where you can find Bonnie
Heyo fusion!!
Banana
This is so cool but so hard
When u deactivate enough cleaning robots It opens a secret room in bonnie bowl
Why didn't u play Baby in Yellow black cat?
❤❤❤❤❤
I love the ruin so so much
I’m fairly certain during the chapter where Chica chases you you can find her sitting in the bathroom I wonder if you can put the voice box back in chica
I really hope that the secret ending is Canon but I doubt that and I think the “Mimic” Ending is the Canon One
Always wonder how people manage to find these kinds of secrets. There's no way if be smart enough to zoom out on cams-
Can i get the game
DLC harder than actual game  I poor
bruh why is fusion such a god
(●’◡’●)ﾉ
Matpat's gonna have the time of his life figuring this out
ROXY!!!!!!!!! WE NEED HER!;‼️‼️‼️🩷🩷🩷
Mooooo
Wowwwwww Ruin is really cool
This can't be the end😭😭
You can give chica her voice box when she goes in the bathroom
There’s got to be an ending where you save the other animatronics
Make part 8 of ruin
Xbox
This is fantastic
More😊❤
Please I’ve never played a fnaf game
The dlc is awesome ngl but geting chicas voice box is even better
I hope we gets another dlc for the game soon
I was so hyped last night because I knew you would be immediately pouring out content for us abt ruined!! I’m so happy I woke up at 8 and started watching all you had out
YOU PREDICTED EVERYTHING CORRECTLY AND SINCE KNOW WE KNOW MINI GAME = UPGRADES FO THE MONTY MINI GAME AND BEAT IT THEN LOOK FOR A 3RD MINIGAME THEN DURING THE ROXY CUTSCENE DONT CLICK ANYTHING JUST TRUST ME I HAVE A FEELING
Was good
Fnaf security breach!
PLEASE pin me I have watched this whole series without a break  and I subscribed
Man, if only the guys from the end of the Pizzaplex books had that. I have no hope for them honestly
You should stream whatever your trying to find.
I have a feeling you're playing this much of the game even more in the short time than just SB
In the first video you where zoomed out and there was the secret camera it’s just you didn’t notice
The one he found was the good ending. The one where Cassie dies is the cannon but bad ending
Ima be honest. I do not like this new DLC but I will say they did good. I just don’t like it
I didn't expect so much from a DLC
This game is soooo good tbh
I just Notice!, The Mimic It's using a Lion Custom just like in the Books It's a White Tiger Custom.
Try not killing Roxanne
I really appreciate this guy for playing this game for so long so we can see the hidden endings
need to play monty golf game and i think  a roxy game and golf give monty cloes i think and roxys eyes if a roxy game is here
Xbox one
What if you escape when disabling Roxy?
The fact Gregory killed cassie shocked me
fusion during when you disabled roxy and on the puzzel there was a back button it might be a secret
I legit stayed up all night last night watching you and it was worth it
Today is my birthday 🥳
That game is sick! matpat is gonna cry doing all those teories☠☠☠
This is crazy!
pls go back to chapter 8 and wait to the were roxy is talking i must know waht she says about the speacel day maybe can you fix chica when she is deactiwaidet [sorry for bad grammer]
Y'know i was excited to see the dlc  and let me say this was kinda mid at best.
Choose the 2nd option,"no"
Yay good job security breach is the best
Fusion really spoils us with how much effort he goes to getting us all of this in such a short time??
Im surprised that this dlc is less glitchy than the og game
Finally
The mimic's new costume seemed to resemble parts of what looks like a lion costume and also what looked like parts of glitchtrap suit for hw but what it really looks like to me is our possible first look at in game Fredbear I feel like they are gonna end the game off in Fredbear family diner fight Fredbear or some other amalgamation
Bro i just realised thaT there is another ending i got to see it!
You can find boine at the bowling near the big ball with the mask on
Hello
Me pls
Are you gonna do a video on glamrock bonnie?  because he was found
hii!!
this game is cool
I have a theory for the whole rabbit thingy, and this is it. I believe that thing you encounter throughout the entire game is the security system keeping the mimic trapped. Now hear me out, that thing is seen halting your progress to the mimic's location throughout the entire game, either in small or big ways, for example shutting down your V.A.N.N.I. systems and alerting the animatronics to your location. (Just note this is a theory and may be false, so take my interpretation with a lot of salt and some pepper to taste)
I wonder if you play monty golf you get the claws
I LOVE FNAF
Whaterver you want
Hi I’ve been subscribed for quite a bit and I was wondering if I could please get a copy of security breach for steam it would really help me for my channel
Hi
it it possible to not activate the mxes
Idk what to expect next of this game. This DLC has given me chills man. I can't wait for future DLC
The part where you get chica's beak and voicebox maybe has somthing to do with chica herself. I mean no way they will give you her beak and voicebox for nothing
I love your vids and want security breach
This series is awesome. I can't wait for other endings 🙏
Thank you fusion
Put a hand emoji if you watched episodes✋
Hi
Video game😊 (Part 6)
Weep woop
All of these videos in one day. Amazing
This dlc is so cool  who knows what else is hiding in the game
fnaf is really crazy now
I wonder what happens if you get all there parts and fix them i hope it lead to a cool ending where they kill the mimic and the animatronics live
Didn’t think the dlc would be that good
Thank you for all your hard work in uploading SB Ruin as fast as possible.
If I’m being honest I was not expecting this dlc to be so good. When I first heard of ruin I was thinking it was going to be bad. Well now I know what game I’m going to try and buy
cool
Candy’s leakkkk🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
This is a theory just a theory but . . . What if each working character specific arcade give you one of there pices weather to fix them, upgrade roxy, or use in a secret ending i fell as though there important
FUZIONZGAMER LISTEN TO ME YOU HAVE TO DO THIS:GO BACK WHERE CHICA WAS SITTING IN THE BATHROOMS AND PUT HER MUSIC BOX BACK OKAY PLS DONT IGNORE ITS REALLY İMPORTANT THANK YOU.
Random request for you fusion when you have to deactivate Roxy what happens if you exit?
This is incredible! I love how much time you spend on finding all these fnaf secrets for every game, you're amazing!!
I personally at least headcannon that Cassy would go fix the animatronics if she got all their parts
maybe there's an ending for using the Monty arcade golf game
Wait did he give Chica her beak when she is deactivated in the bakery
I know that the mimic used to wear different clothes I'm not spoilering for what just in case someone is reading the books
The suit is the tiger.    It's the mimic from the books.       All the other games are made to make fun and give a more light side to the events at Freddy's..   Security breach is different. It's story based. It's real. Not just some game. These are real people in the fnaf universe. Thats the tiger. The white tiger.
lol
hey fusion hope i win !!!
You know GLAMROCK Bonnie is hidden in that wall
This is amazing
and i think you get a different ending
I go to bed I wake up thes dude has already played the entire game
Fusion if i tricked you, you have to give me Security Breach  Read more...
Props to FusionZ for already finding 2 secret endings.
HI
i have an dare. when ur on chapter 7 with the music guys go to the secret cam and press intercom and see what happens
Always one of the most reliable channels for Fnaf content, your commitment is insane
I remember seeing the gator golf since Chica game gave you her beak if the monty arcade game gives u his claws
This DLC is honestly more interesting and entertaining than I thought
hey i just want to say this is my first comment and you can give chica her voice box back keep up the great work
This could be the forgot the name thin circus baby it has red hair right?
Thank you fusion for posting these parts like a machine!
hear me out: the animatronic is in an older style, they might be teasing a fredbear’s game
Yo, I would it be able for you to tell me your pc specs? It has been a while since you last did and idk whether you upgraded it. I am trying to be a content creator like you but I don't know what parts to buy to upgrade my pc. Thanks
For some reason I feel like cassie didn’t die or Roxy didn’t Die either
I subscribe to all your videos. Can I please pretty please get a shout out❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
damn
That’s crazy, I like how the mimic appears, AirPod maxes???
hi
I have a theory,there might be a dlc to the dlc and the main character  is Gregory again with glamrock freddy,but this time it might end all the questions and be where glamrock freddy dies and might wrap up the whole fnaf situation
👍
⚠️SPOILERS⚠️You can give chica back her voice box back by winning her arcade so I wonder if you can do the same for Roxy here?
This game is so amazing!!
Click "Escape" when you have to disable Roxanne
I've been binge-watching your videos for hours now, and I can't stop! Your energy and enthusiasm are contagious. Can't wait for the next upload!
The Monty golf there was a arcade game and you said you will play it a the end
this dlc is better than the base game
cool
That true, may be the next fnaf should go back in time to fredbears family dinner and have a night guard survive the night in that pizzeria tell more lore of how fredbear family dinner started and the evidence before its creation between Henry and William. What It Also does is talk about something that hasn't been talked about before the fate of William aft-on wife her side of the stor
Love you vids
I REALLY want your next video to be hacking but I like this ending ALOT
i love this game
Bro you can use the chika beak to repair her
What if there's a way to somehow plug the voice box back into chica, then you could have 2 friendly animatronics
Can i please get a copy of the FNaF security breach? I subbed i liked and uhhh…thats my fav game FNaF game to be exact…pls a ps4 SB copy?
Liar i did all of that and the doors are still closed
Do you get any sleep? You upload to fast?
oomg thank you for this
If you look around Bonnie bowling you can find a secret room with glam rock Bonnie
Yay
Wonder if their maybe another DLC next year that involves repairing in the future
Hi
Hi
You are the best
i think you can give chica the voicebox back. i saw it in a video. it doesnt seem to do anything
I found Glamrock Bonnie,He’s in a hole in bonnie bowl in one of the places to bowl in
Yo can I get a security breach copy for Nintendo please
Sleep like a normal person- Grind a game all night long
gg man
Best DLC ngl
Hi
lets go
everytime matpat has a new fnaf theory stell woll is like there s gona be a new game coming out
And Roxy ring wrestling when she sits down try to put her voice box in
you went and did all this so fast its actualy scary. do you need a doctor and a fireman? cause you are on fire bro!
Amazing like always also i hope u are having a good day
We do not give Z enough praise for completing this dlc in just one night and already finding 2 of the secret endings❤
Yo apparently you can give Chica her voice box when she is in the bathroom deactivated hope this helps
Hey I have a question what happens if you say no to the computer right before you free the mimic p.s can I get a shout out for telling you this
The ending from part 6 is crazy 😮😮
THEY FOUND ANEW SECRET IN THE GAME GLAMROCK BONNIE!!!!!!
FNAF is the most og game to me
Man DLC is amazing
I love this
U CAN GIVE CHICA HER VOICE BACK
Me want security breach
Was that the original fredbear suit from the very first diner?
This DLC has so much lore
DLC is worth it
With the chocas beak thing Does that mean we could theoretically fix the other animatronics?  And its sad we didnt see the real freddy in it
Nice
HELP YOUR FAST FUSION 7 VIDEOS ALREADY? THIS IS WHY YOUR MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER :D
Ok bro I agree with the fredbear family diner game but it my opinion I only want a copy for lore purposes I don't really like the game so don't get mad ate fusion I always been a fan of your videos and ur channel since day one but I only like this game bc ur playing it
I read in my room. Hi my name is Landon I know this is my dad’s photo but I’m actually a kid
Hey fusion I also saw this one thing that if u go into the bowling alley There should be a hole leading to Bonnie’s dead body
Midnight motorist, the footprints outside micheal's bedroom was the mimic. The monster in the woods. Atleast thats what i theorize
I need to play this dlc fr it looks amazing
PLS ME
Thank you bro
The thing you saw when you were walking down the stairs it was the blob
Try getting Monty’s claws,Roxy’s eyes and every thing else
whatever you want
E
Baba booey
I've felt so much excitement watching all these videos. I love it!
That was so cool
There is a secret room on the bowling area and there is Glamrock Bonnie with those clean bots.
i think this game has so much lore
Man this game is game changing
Love this dlc it’s so amazing
M
fusion can i get security breach
Bro, dlc looking crazy
Fusion glamrock bonnie is in this, ok in bonnie bowl idk witch chapter there is a passage at the end of one of the bowling allies and it will lead you into a storage room for the bowling balls and glamrock bonnie is laying on the floor its behind a poster
The new costume of the mimic looks like a mediocre melodies character. This game is insanely cool and the dlc even cooler, I agree with you that the real ending is the ending where Cassie dies in the elevator. But the ending in which the mimic gets scooped is probably the good ending? I’m looking forward to the next video so we can see some more… LORE!
I WANT SECURITY BREACH PLEASE FUSIONZGAMER JUST PLEASE
Can’t wait for game theory’s video on this lol
Dlc got me like 😲😲😲😲🥱🥱🥱😱😱😱🤓😎😎🤓🥶🥶🥶🥶😊
Thank you Fusion for always making us smile! Please drink some water and get some good rest, you’ve deserved it (as always)!
this man deserves more subs he the funniest YouTuber i seen keep up the work and i love the fnaf content
The dlc is scarier but the endings are a let down they dirint put the comic effects not only Gregory in this dlc pulled a six so I'm gonna say that I give the dlc a 3/10
I managed to do it and btw u have ti make sure the game saves before u quit the game
Yo
He must have a freaking closet in there so he can change into a lion costume
Noice
🔥🔥
The scooping room is back?!
This was a really good dlc
Bro relax on the uploads sheesh
the dlc do be goin wild tho
I have watch all you videos and i love how your channel has grown
I wonder if you say no in the security machine the mxap
I love your vids so much you make me smile everyday
Waaaaaa
Please give me security breach
It a lion animatronic
i had no idea the dlc would be this good
Your video's are so good and help people with the game to learn new thing
Yooooo
In the books, the boy the mimic was created after loved his white tiger toy, which we also see on one of the fnaf websites, and in the books, since it symbolizes the mimic. i wonder if in this "alternate time/storyline" instead of a white tiger, it's a lion, since the suit seemed to be a lion costume. Also his lil sweater had an E on it.
Whatever you want
This dlc is amazing
Hey can I do a reaction video to your fnaf sb ruin video pls
I was kinda shocked we didn’t see the blob, Burntrap, or DJ Music Man (missed opportunities) now I wonder how help wanted 2 fits in. What a weird costume that the mimic wore and I wonder where that claw came from.
This is Peak gaming
Cant wait for the next fnaf game to come out to see more about gregory
If you wait when you find Roxy you will hear sad things
Keep doing what you are doing you ahold not quit you should keep going  cus yoru videos make every one smile
This is amazing
this is good
Can’t believe it
this is cool i want to play to and i love your vidios
I figured I would enter in the contest but I will be happy even If someone else wins I just think it's kinda fun 😁👍
Omg more endings
MatPat bouta go raging
I was very surprised about that suit popping up out of nowhere and who knows maybe he did say "let me put on my fancy suit before I chase this girl"
FUZION GLAMROCK BONNY IS IN THE GAME HES BEHIND THE GLITCH BALL IN BONNIE BOELING BEHIND IT IS A CRACK IN THE WALL IF YOU GO THROUGH IT HES THERE
😊
I wasn't expecting you to play ruin today!
E
What about chic as voice box
i love your videos keep up the great work
I think the secret ending with the mimic in a suit was supposed to be a very old fredbear
Probably an ending for turning off all floor bots and/or all collectables
I love your videos
What happens if you don't reboot Roxy?
This just can't be the last game about the Pizzaplex because we got so many new questions and criminally little answers. What the hell happened with Burntrap and Blob? The Blob appeared once in the beginning, but that's it?
Yo bro it's me tradeGolden on FNaF ar I used to watch you a lot what's good
Nice dlc! To if I win can it be Xbox One?
that bunny ghost is willam
I Think i can win!! I REALLY want a copy of FNAF Security Breach! I don't Have 40 bucks i really think i can win!!
Dose the elevator ending change if u don't turn off security 🤔
Just to know glam rock boinne is here I am not telling you if he dead or alive         edit: no spoiling
I hope I win haven't gotten the win one of these before
Awesome video definitely recommend watching
My
I wanna play ruin so much. I’m so desperate
This game how could it get any better what an amazingly horrifying experience
I really hope that Cassie is able to fix the animatronics. There needs to be justice for the animatronics
mat pat going crazy rn
This might be a dumd question but can you check what happens when you say no when it says "are you sure you want to deactivate security protocols" i just curious
Hi
U can probally put chica voice box back in her
Now we have to wait for more LOREEEEE!!!!
That isn’t the mimic look at his mouth  you could see eyes and they’re not the same
Can't believe the game ends with Gregory killing Cassie they need to add something
They have new ending instead of going right gotta go left you get helpy, Gregory, and Vanessa ending. It’s the left with dark red texture in cave at the end when he us chasing you.
GAME PLSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Can I pis have it
The cabinets you got chicas voice box from the game cabinet maybe you could give back her voice and Monty is hands by winning Gator golf and Roxy her eyes if there is another game cabinet for her and maybe there's a final one for the Prototype Freddy cuz it was missing its head so maybe there's ahead you can win
The ending was… surprising
Hey!! Fusion gamer i found a video of the location of glamrock bonnie in ruin . U can search it up online and check if its true or not that would be lovely . Love ur videoss !!!
Oh Maaaaatpaaaat
The scooping room, a cross over between security breach and sister location
I know where Glamrock bonnie is
You’re doing great man
You can find Bonnie
This is just amazing
Bruh I woke up and you already finished the game with multiple finished endings
I found this video idk if it’s real can you find out if it is please as I don’t have security breach https://youtu.be/V2V6UrBW92M
Can you give security breach to an Xbox or only steam?
Fusion  you are probably not gonna see this, But maybe try giving the beak (not good at spelling if thats wrong) back to the chicken and maybe just maybe something will happen .
Yo this is sick
Nice the scooper is back. Btw everyone get him to 4m.
Guys I think I discovered a secret, if you see the part where the mime appears and Roxy helps us and Cassie runs in that same room in the corner in the dark has a costume that apparently is a bird (a little different from the same one used by mimic in the scooper ending) but it's clearly not Chica WOW. I don't think it's the same costume as the scooper ending, at least putting them side by side they are different maybe this place has more than one costume, funny because it doesn't seem to be metal but literally a costume that's crazy
This game frickin dope
brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
I’m subbed I liked an I commented
7 parts.. in less than a day..
This guy is litteraly speedrunning the game
Fnaf
I think it’s a good ending. If you go to Roxanne and you don’t hack her
Anyone notoce the 2 different hapis yet? The regular one and the one with gold-ish yellow eyes and purple black vains?
fortnite battle pass
If you beat Chica's minigame to get her voice box, does that mean you can get Monty's claws from Monty Golf?
So I was watching a video on ruin and saw glam lock bonnie it is at bonnie bowling and it is at the back wall we’re the bowling pins would have been
Can I pls have security beach for PS4 it will be my first FNAF game pls
Egg
I love this dlc
I’ve been watching your vids Since I was in grade school and I love how funny you are and thanks for introducing me to fnaf
There has to be a arcade cabinet that represents roxy because the chica one gave you the beak and I know there was a monty golf arcade cabinet you could play somewhere
I liked commented and I'm subscribed and I really want Security Breach Ruin DLC
ruin came in clutch
Who is that dinosaur ?
Fusion I think you can change ur mask
i wanna enter but i dont know how
Succurity breach or whatever i want
I have a theory what if we aren’t actually Cassie and this is an explanation of how Vanessa became Vanny. This could be why we have the original Vanny mask instead of the new one and why we are the “technician” as Helpi says when we put the mask on. Our mission to save Gregory while turning off the nodes could be how Vanny gets controlled by Afton.
There is a arcade where you play Monty’s golf
i think the suit it wore must be the first suit that William and Henry made before freadbear   just theory also the dlc is amazing and keep doing good work
Food
Imagine a part two were Roxy and Cassie take revenge on Gregory
This shows that stel wool can do right with the FNAF franchise. Cant wait for more videos. W DLC
still need to do that gator golf arcade machine at the beginning of the game
This is such a cool dlc
I thought vanny would be mimicking Gregory
He did this all at once
It’s cool how much he searched for these things, I could probably not be able to do this so I’m glad to see how things go
DANG FUSION IS MASS UPLOADING
Remember go to bonnie bowling and go to the destroyed bowling ball in the bowling alley to enter the secret entrance
idea: what if you went down to find like Roxy's eyes somewhere and gave it back to her and get a secret ending or something
The scooper??
Hey idk if it’s anything but I noticed when you went to put the wrench in Roxie’s eye it also said “esc” in the corner so maybe you don’t need to put the wrench in her eye?
I can’t believe this is out and it’s crazy how fnaf came a long way
You can fix chica with the voice box. If you go to where chica is laying  you can put her voice box in  https://youtu.be/O9g3Fn67EvQ
Bonnie has been found! He's in a secret room in Bonnie Bowl!!!
This DLC is so much better than I thought it would be! Fabulous gameplay and even more secrets!
Does anyone realize the mimic was wearing a tiger or lion costume that has a hoodie on that might be our tiger-rock parallel
Hi
Bonnie is in the game  next to a clean bot you deactivate in a bowling alley next to it
This is a crazy DLC.
Security breach pls I subbed
I rlly wish i could play the ruin dlc i rlly wish ;-;
Very cool
I think there its a othere ending. This feels just like its nog compleet yet
Hey i have a possibility for you fusion. when you get to the sad scene where Cassie shuts down Roxanne wolf. there was an option to exit with escape, perhaps that can save Roxanne?
Oh he dead
1973 is the year when Fredbears opened not Fredbears family diner
Can you do a video about the monty arcade game
You know how you got chicas voice box from her game maybe you can get Monty's Claus
GREAT JOB BROTHER
I realy want an copy of security breach, I have always wanted to play it and I love your vids man I would appreciate it because I have been verry bored this summer break and I realy want something to do
So you got.chicas voice box back. Are there other mini games to get roxys eyes and montys claws? Rebuild.the ruined animatronics?
Hi!
I am still gonna stay up until the next videos because they’re so good
It might be cannon
chica's voice box
You can find Glamrock Bonnie in the bowling alley in a hole in the wall next to the giant bowling ball
Props to you my man
There’s a secret glamrock Bonny in the bowling place. And more of those robots things
Might want to redo the cutscene when you meet the Mimic to see if that costume has its own event.
Aye Fuzion, just FYI, Bonnie is behind the bowling ally, You have to use the mask to reach it. But sadly I cant fully leak it. And when you have the voice box and Chica is deactivated in the bathroom, give her the voicebox.
That suit could be the mimic’s actual suit from a fnaf game that never got released. The mimic might’ve used to be an actual animatronic. He might not have always been evil.
Cool
I love the DLC❤
My guess the canon ending is when the elevator falls it has to be because the rest doesn’t lead much for a second game
all of this is suprising to me
I wish the places were optional liek in thee original fnaf security breach
Thats not the mimic no more thats fredbear💀
I love whenever he sees a new animatronic with the mask on he asks "can I take it off?" But then he does and he blames his death on  "you can't get close to them??"
You can find Bonnie's remains Bonnie bowl I watch the video and I might be clickbait or actually real you where the broken wrecking ball is the big one we have to wear the the vanny mask to see it then you go straight and then you find bowling alley Pat and then going there and that's where you see him it's probably wrong now that I checked but if you can make a video out of it will be good
Bro this dlc is so mysterious
The mimic in that suit looked horrific
Day 126 of trying to get fusion to notice me😢
Is it just me, or is the graphics way better?
Idk if you found this but I saw a vid of someone finding glamrock bonie in the bowling alley under one of those things where the pins are if you havent found it go look cuz Idk if that vid was real
I somehow found the cams for the 1st one by playing around and had no idea what it was lol
Earlier and wanted videos there's a picture of spring-trap and the blob so where is spring-trap at and if Bonnie's bowling has holes in the bowling alley they should add Bonnie in the bottom disabled
Even the game is like if your tired take a break😂
Fusion makes the absolutely best vids
Who else pulled an all nighter watching these?
theres a reason i choose to watch fusionzgamer's playthroughs instead of the other youtubers. hes an absolute chad and in my opinion the best fnaf youtuber.
How do you get that game  please  😢
Hello 7
I mean you will see cracks
I love this dlc
is the game even that scary?
Brl the DLC isnt even done how 💀
I want security breach I been subscribed for years
I'm literally so freaked out, this is making me excited
Let’s go to series gonna be awesome
I love all of the endings it gives you
y e s
I honestly think that when matpat tries to do a theory on this, he's either going to be very wrong or say something that's so crazy to the point where nobody believes him because how is anyone supposed to begin to process what these endings mean and their lore implications
Hey fusion, when watching your earlier vids, I saw that when hacking Roxy, there was the option to hit esc and exit, and before you release the mimic, you can hit no on the computer, just some things that might lead to different stuff
We love you fusion. We hope you had a blast in making these videos. Stay safe and keep up the good work
Whatever I want he he he
i have no words
Apparently you can find glam rock Bonnie idk where but you need the vanny mask
Dude you should probably get the animatronic body parts to get a new ending. You can get chica’s voice box and repair her in the bathrooms after all. There must be some secret if you somehow manage to fix them.
I wonder if you can’t collect the parts you took from the animatronics and return them to them. Like Chica goes down in a bathroom. What if you can give that back to her for an ending? Or maybe if you have Monty’s claws he stops chasing you. Roxy asks for her eyes too.
Fusion get some sleep its admirable how dedicated you are to this but its not healthy to stay up for 12 hours to find everything
the suit is from the Junior, s location from midnight  motorist
man i got to give this dlc a try but look like he mimic glitchtrap suit
Dang YouTube notifications broke for me so imma bit late to this one 😅
The Mimic's dialogues are from what Gregory says throughout the entire game, as The Mimic was unable to fully hack Freddy but he did access Freddy's sound receptor so he heard everything from there.  "This stupid door won't open"
What about the chica mouth
So far, the game is really smooth as always, and the storyline is quite interesting🤭 thanks for playing this game until thw very end
hi
Damn hopefully you get that rest fusion when your done
Security Breach would be nice to have
DDDAMNNNN SO FASSTTT
I could’ve never expected from Ruin, considering how many bugs were in the game and the amount of cut content, but the DLC has shocked me so far!
Kinda a spoiler but a helpful hint if you wanna look at it👀    Hey fusion there's something around the bowling area if you look hard enough 😉 👌
This is so exciting
There's probably an arcade for each animatronic in their respective areas, like Monty, Chica, and Roxy. And after completing each, you get the part that Gregory took from them. Not sure what you do after that, but you could possibly repair them (in some way) and get a new ending. Idk
Cool
Hi fusion me and my nephew are big fans
I've always loved you observation duty and alternate watch videos. Keep making great content!
Fusion!!! They found him, they found our bunny boi! https://youtu.be/V2V6UrBW92M
I woke up around 7:00 am just to see this swarm of videos being posted so quickly. The DLC is  Ike a whole other game. Wouldn’t be surprised I’d there was a new one after this.
Search up "rage quit" its a game from scott cawthon
You have to collect all the missing parts the parts you stole from all of them as Gregory
Bro you have been grinding. These videos out man good job!
Plz can i get the dlc on ps4😢😢😢😢
I got to get this on my switch
some get this man a huge pack of energy drinks cause he is one of the champions
Yo fusion I’ve been watching your channel since I was five and I’ve loved your videos and I subscribed a little while ago on a different device but it was like six years from then so you’re the best you tuber ever watched your own first CoryxKenshin is in second
Fnaf Security Breach olease I dint have money😢
I feel like this will be dumb, but you should try by not pressing the shut down security? Like just activate that thing to break concrete
The mimic wears the mascot costume from the start when the door is open, the reveal is so much scarier with the costume
I like how you not tat scard of the game
Hello
I am sad the ruined DLC isn't out on Xbox just yet 😭
THIS GUY IS A TOTTAL SPEEDRUNNER I NEVER SEEN A GUY SEND VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE THIS FAST HE CAN SPEED RUN MINECRAFT IN ONE MINUTE BRO
Fusion you can find bonnie in bonnie bowl!!
Fusion glamrock Bonnie is behind one of the lanes all jacked up
Whatever you want
Wo
this DLC is amazing
my favorite part of the dlc is when you are in the daycare
WAIT ITS A WHITE LION THAT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A PLUSHIE LIKE IN THE BOOKS ITS THE MIMIC FROM THE BOOKS
At the end of the DLC Credits I got W Roxy saying “Cassie” which means W Roxy lived
I did all of it but it did not work I looked at all cameras that you showed and did the same but it did not work
Scooper
I loved this DLC playthrough so much I watched it twice while waiting for this one I'm so excited!
a
Something is up with the mimic, why would it only now have a like mascot suit on
This game is crazy
Very good videos, Keep the Heat up!
fusion u can see glamrock bonnie in bonnie bowl in the main area one of the allys has an entrance to a room and broken glamrock bonnie is inthere
This is so good!!
Hi love your vid’s ❤
Yeah no he already had the suit on before I checked
I wonder if you can give chica her beak
Can I plz get a copy of security breach, please I never won that game before and I really wanna play the ruin
Hey Bonnie is in a Secret room
Hopefully you see the Dawko, you can find glamrock Bonnie's animatronic in a secret room in Bonnie bowl.
Hey so are the comic just telling us what the canon ending for the first part of security breach is cause thats what i think
hi
I won't win

Kinda late watching the videos, was catching up. This is just crazy so far. Love this so far!
YOU NEEED SLEEEEEEP!!!!!!
Fusion you can find glamrock bonnie he's in bonnie bowl at the far right of the lanes in a hole
Where is William Afton?
I need this game!
Oh
i love just putting his videos on in the background
Some one found bonnie in the bowling alley
And this is the last thing I had to say about Five Nights at Freddy's ruins. I was hoping I'd glitch robot thing will be the final boss like burn trap but he wasn't like he had so much hype from all the different teasers but we just get we just get a stupid ending like the first game
You go under für board in Bonnie bolling and there a Big  Lord there

I feel like the white bunny entity is not evil and is protecting the system from u so the mimic don’t get free
Keep up the great work man love your videos
You NEED to go behind the bowling alley in Bonnie bowl
Around the world Aldi und the world
This is awesome
HMMMMMMM
All that different endings of this game make no sense. Like the first game. and I'm guessing the bad endings when you die in a good ending slash the Canon ending is when you kill that robot the one thing I don't get is where is Gregory cuz I'm the poster the teaser the teaser poster for the DLC we see him on the poster but he's not in the game there's no new characters besides two and that's it and weird looking robot would kill in one of the endings and then that weird stupid glitch robot

*So the mimic is just a robotic skin walker?*
What happens if you got to the elevator with this mimic looking like that?
What tf was that thing
FusionZgamer you don’t have to rush if you wanna do a part 8
There are actually other robots to deacrivat in bonnie's bowling alley close to the big bowling pin and there's a secret animatronic you might like to see😉
Bro in the last 9 hours we got 7 parts
The candy story is a reffernce to the mimic luring Cassie with Gregorys voice to open the door There was a monster in the woods but the mother caught it and locked it up in the basement. The monster would always make scary sounds at night but the mom would tell the boy a lullaby to sleep one day the monster stopped growling and instead listened and learned the lullaby the next day when the mother went out for food the monster sang the lullaby from the basement the little boy heard the lullaby and opened the door to the basement.
Crazy determination this guy
whatever happened to the animatronic in the trailer for security breach? the like one with six arms or something
Ruin and security breach for xbox
Gotta love that he’s always early with the uploads
Fuzion I've been watching your videos ever since you began FANF videos!
They didn’t realease it on Xbox ☹️☹️
at bonnie borwl i think he meant glamrock bonnie is here when he said something is here (i cant show into days video but stay tooned)
Hi
I'm loving Ruin so far
Fusion  I know the secret you are hinting  I know what it is and I have seen everything but I will not spoil
i love this DLC it looks so good also i love that fusion takes time out of sleep just to make video for us to enjoy round of applause
I'm ready
You're really going crazy it's like every second i look at youtube you uploaded a new video of ruin dlc
Hi
Stcknick fusion and awesome videos
Can I have normal Roxy plush and ruin??
what if the mimic was bonnie but broken, and Bonnies upgrade was to mimic people
Monty's arcade is my favorite out of all of the mini-games
This DLC is really good.
Still have brain damage but wortn it. Also thats probably some character from the book series. I cant afford tje books or convice my mom to get me any so i wouldnt know honestly. Also you should rest, you have been up since, god knows how long 😭
I ant even eat lunch and two new videos appear 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love ruin dlc
😁
I can't wait for what you are gonna shot us for the next video👀
Egg
Whatever I want
Love this ending, this definitely has to be the canon one because we survive!
I really liked how this was setup, defently one of the best pieces of fnaf conetent we got in a long time, im starting to get help wanted vibes for when vanny was revealed. Loving it!
Can't wait to see the lore for this DLC
I love this dlc so much
4:41 I saw Gregory and Cassie sign
Just binged all of these and I am shook
Do you need sleep fuzion z gamer
Please i want fnaf sb im really big fan and i really want it
HEYO
Gimme security breach right now
Wow I really wasn't expecting that ending
The first beginning he says we can’t risk being followed in the elevator maybe he was with someone
Jesus loves you all✝️ God bless you all❤️ Always trust The Lord:)❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊
Hey there is a secret  Area   Right next to the big bowling ball and AI  vanny there’s a tunnel or a whole we’re you can find the body of Bonnie
Thank you fusion
This is my 7 Time to ask pls fusionzgamer
Hey fusion Z gamer I wonder if you don’t kill Roxy you get something try it out plz
Yoo!! Awesome work Fusion! Definitely get some rest though 💀  Also, what happens if you go back to  the moment where you have to deactivate Roxanne, and don't deactivate her?
Tons of other people have probably thought of this, but I think it’s possible to get Monty’s claws from the gator golf arcade, similar to Chica’s voice box. If that’s true, maybe you could get Roxy’s eyes somewhere, possibly in the raceway but idk.  And maybe, just maybe you could put all of these on Roxy? I’m not sure if that’s possible, I’m just guessing, but dang it would be pretty cool if that was possible.
By the way I think I saw a picture of the start of a video and someone was getting jumped scared by cheeky and the title I forgot but it said something about the Voicebox the one you got
To find bonnie go to the bowling alie area next to blue ball  whit vanny mask the under the yellow sign u will see the purple light then go under the sign and u will find creeper box and next to it u will find bonnie laying around i think try it out and also try to find chica in the bathroom somwhere and some chapther i dont know  and give her her beak
what ever you want
Me like and comment
Can I have copy
I just found our glam bonnie is in game in bonnie idk where but its in the place you bowl
So "Burntrap" is just the mimic? Also what happened to the Blob? Where was the prototype Freddy in base game? We got some answers and more questions.
I love Fnaf because I love you videos I'm really watch your videos almost everyday and favorite is security breach blumen and their normal one and I watch all of your videos almost and a huge fan of security breach.
You are my faverit youtube also I hope we see bonnie later
the mimic put on the suit when you broke the concrete wall but you didnt do the chapter again you jumped right into the chase
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Sheeesh
W
I'm watching the main game first EDIT: I finished watching it a few hours ago
Is he just going to forget that he has chicas voice box, that could lead to another secret ending.🤔
I think that thing is fredbear
Theory: The Security Breach Ruin Scooper Ending is making ways for future FNAF Fans Games
I was really hoping Bonnie would be in this dlc somehow
actually he ahs the costume at the cutscene before the chase too, so it makes more sense
I CANT WAIT to see what the beak does
13 HOURS THAT IS SO MUCH U NEED A BRAKE AFTER YOU FINISH ALL THE ENDINGS
Is there any other endings?
Fusion deserves ALL the support he gets. Like, 12 to 15 HOURS?! That takes dedication, effort, determination, and the heart. We love you fusion and really appreciate what you do just so we can see secrets and gameplays like this! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I doubt I would win the copy but I'm just gonna try anyway I've been watching fusion for a few years he is so entertaining
Can I get a free copy of fnaf security breach for my switch
Now see where if you can find other animatronic parts
would love the game
next vid put Chica's voice box in  when she's hunting you
There u will also find ar helpy plushie
The DLC looks amazing
In the books, the creator of the mimic program(and the endo) has a son that the mimic was originally created as a companion to, that child had a white lion plush that might be the reason the mimic is appearing with a lion like suit in this ending.
whatever you want
Under the sign will be a purple light go under the sign whit vamny mask ok
this dlc is amazing so far kinda depressing that gregory traitored cassie in the first ending you got tho
Cassie is Charlotte
Dang that was fast
Hi Fusion
Fusion at bonnie golf theres a secret room and youll find glamrock _____ hope this helps for another episode and you got the chica beak you can put it on chica it will just play a cutscene and theres more fazcoins in the files theres a skeleton bonnie no one has found it yet so idk where it is i hope youll find it
Under the the yellow sign next to that big blue ball when u put on the vanny  mask
i keep forgetting this is a dlc
whatever you want lol
Man's a realm trooper going all out of his way to get these endings as soon as possible
I wonder how much endings there are.
All I want is the DOC in
No way bros already done 💀💀💀
6:31 nah he's in a broken furry costume💀
I loved watching this and it was fun yo watch a lot
Also u can find bonnie in the bowling  place downstairs
In the books Gregory leads people to the pizza plex and kills them so the mimic ending might be the True Ending
Maybe if you finish the monty arcade game you will get his claws and maybe you could get roxy's eyes with a secret arcade game too.
Goofyboofy69
Hi
Cool
Fusion in the back of bonnie bowling in were the bowling pines glamrock bonnie is broken and it is a full model plz check this out
GLAM ROCK BONNIE IS IN THE BOWLING ALLY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2V6UrBW92M

Fusion pls send sb for xbox pls I did everything and I've been watching your channel  for a long time
They killed ratchet
Anyone else notice the flashlight never needed to b charged?
i would like security breach
😮
Swaws
Love how the AR mask explains vanny’s abilities with her teleportation and invisibility to animatronics
Fusion has some crazy dedication.
I found an Easter egg and glamrock Bonnie is in the game in Bonnie blowing
i would like this game
Ciao Bro!😅😂
Whatever you want👍 Okay so I just remembered that I really shouldn’t be watching this, I’m on vacation rn and today is my last day. I need to pack the rest of my stuff but I’m watching you rn, idk why but…
Mimic looks like a lion
Is there going to be another dlc after this one or is this the last one?
Bros finna 100% complete the game than anyone else
Wow omg so cool 😮😊😮
You can press escape on the roxxane node and i think it gets you another ending
WOW!!! I did not know about that secret ending. Keep up the good work!
It looks really fun to play
Glamrock Bonnie is in the game he is behind one of the bowling lanes
This game is dope
Very curious as to what people think about why the mimic wants to escape? Any theories?
This guy has amazing commitment to making these videos for us and deserves praise for his efforts
I wonder if there’s another ending if u don’t deactivate Roxy for the node
the mimic's new costume looks like a Lion to me
I can,t play the dlc
POV : Its been 2 hours and he hasnt posted the hourly gameplay..
Bro I wanna play this so BAD
Hey fusion there’s is a secret in Bonny bowl there is a rainbow screen that say mega pizzaplex and when you are there u can put on the canny mask and you can go throw a little hole but I won’t spoil the surprise but it will leave you in shock
there's bonnie body in the bonnie bowl if you don't know
Bros having to much fun
I did what you said
I watched all of them finally
Mimic wants to be a decent person before death or dying
Him : Scooping room!!  Me :  wait to meet you So join the animatronic family We open real soon Try your best to hold onto sanity Come get to know me And you won't wanna leave after tonight Down here, we're lonely And we would love you to join us for a bite
Reminds me of the fusion speed ran security breach bro he was so fast that i dident have to to keep up to speed on his vids
So if the mimic was down there wouldnt that mean HENRY knew of it and posspble tried to burn it in fnaf 6?
Everyone ready for that "special somthing"
hello your videos are always awesome, thank you for show all your awesome content.
Cassie is the princess in princess quest.
Bro I just finished watching the first video from last night and then I see he’s already got three endings up
kinda looks like a dinosaur
SOMEONE FOUND GLAMROCK BONNIE
I really admire these people. I hope I can someday find something I enjoy doing lol.
Fusion there might be another ending for refusing to deactivate Roxy, but we won’t know Untill you try!
Fusion you should really go back to bonnie bowl and go behind the pins (there's a "new" animatronic there)
i thought this dlc would have alot of gliches but no its great
Exotic Butters
Fusion go into the bonnie bowling area and search in one of the bowling machines
Whatever you want
This whole series made me go wtf every second of watching it
This has been the best dlc for security breach
Love your video Fusion and thanks for making a series our of this
with chicas beak you can repair her when she deactivates (i want the security breach my name is jernej.medved13 answear me pls🥺)
I can’t remember if he’s found this yet but Bonnie is behind Bonnie bowls
Cool
Mondongo
wonder what music man would look like withered. the giant music man :D
your dedication to this is amazing
Can you give it on my switch
Fusion is dedicated fr
Wow this ending was something but is it me or the suit looks like Freddy in the TV show
I dident expect that the ruin dlc is this huge
What a dlc
If you go to the part where Chica is de activated in the bathroom you can re install her voice box!
fusionyou can find glamrock bonnies dead lifeless body behind bonnies bowl
Dame that fast?!
ONLY BEEN LIKE 8 HRS AND ALR DONE!?
I always thought the lore in the books weren’t related to the games? Now they are involving them? This is confusing man
Dude whats inside the mimcs suit? Looks like anothet set of eyes. Like its a springtrap suit
I think it’s a lion. I remember the books mentioning a animatronic lion
Thank you for playing through this. I’ve been so hyped to see this DLC since SB came out. The ending to this was crazy. FNAF has always been a comfort for me, and watching you’re videos has become a comfort also. I’m ever so glad I found your channel.
Is that glamrock bonnie
Dang bro u are so goood
Oml I just realized. The animation is similar to the Blob and Burntrap.
fuzion i want security breach on pc i liked the video and i subcribed :)
This is so good
I do have sb on my Xbox
What if the mimic is the stichwraith???
I want security  breach
MatPat is gonna go bonkers when he sees this💀
Bro glamrock bonnie was found!!!!
Can you possibly upgrade roxy with all the parts if you find all of the glamarocks games 🤔 if so can you have an ending with Roxy fully upgraded and defeat the mimic 😮
I play on a Xbox
The mimic kills like 62 people both in SB and the Tales From The Pizzaplex series. A child. A CHILD. KILLS HIM. THE SAME THING HAPPENS IN SB. BURNTRAP IS BEATEN BY A CHILD. SAME WITH THE MIMIC. THE ANIMATRONICS IN SB TOO!
I watched all the parts and I loved it, I love your videos great job on the ruin videos! And they were hinting at Micheal Aft()n getting scooped by enerad!
It’s good
It look fun
The suit was from moon and sun I think
I love your heads Junior so special I love youI love your
You are my favorite fnaf youtuber and the first to end ruin
I really  want it
Don't forget their was also the playable Monty arcade machine
Lol
This will be so fun to play
YOOOO U CAN FIND THE GLAMROCK BONNIE JUST SEARCH UP TOXICJIM HE FOUND HIM!!!!!!!!!😁😁
Ik
I think thats a foxy mascot costume
I’ve been binge watching this since 8 in the morning ITS SO GOOD LIKE OMG😭🙏
in the previus video he said ''this is my favorite time of year'' or somkething like that, that goes to show how important this game franchise/community is to him
Hi
What if you try and save roxy when you have to deactivate her?
Hi I love your videos!! I liked your video and I was already subscribed!!!
7 parts in one day
Well this sucks... I'm in Iran soo I won't be able to win but meh
Fusion!! I hope you see this bc at least to me it's something really cool and important for the game.   (Spoilers ahead maybe? Idk)  The thing is that you can actually find Glamrock Bonnie in a hidden spot in the Bonnie Bowl! I'm sorry if this is kinda a spoiler but finding out about this seems important for the story, and even more now that we know where he is and come up with theories of what really happened to him (as the story in the Monty golf didn't seem quite legit to me). So yeah, hope this helps!!
Omag
I think the costume the mimic wears is a tiger.
I think i remember that in one episode, when we got to the plain path, with Cassie (?) being dropped to the elevator, I heard in the rolls that Roxy spoke for a moment before Fusion skipped  Maybe its... some sort of memory playing or Roxy finding the kid..? Is it just an audio glitch?
FusionZgamer is a Fusion🗿Gamer
Hello
Hi
You should go back to bonnie bawl and use the mask to go behind the giant ball in the ground and you should find a BIG secret.
Security breach pls I liked and sub
You ur bro and Doco are troopers for staying up and playing for hours and hours
If it helps I think you forgot one of em wash floor signs do deactivate. ;u;  I HOPE THIS HELPS YOUR A REAL TROOPER! YOU GOT THIS!
Best FNAF YouTuber, this man putting in the work I haven't even watched the video yet but I know it's already gonna be a banger like the others 👏
This dlc was indeed a insane rolecoaster Dammm!!
21f
LMFAOOOOOOO NOOB GOT SCOOPED
Very suspicious?
Awesome things❤
i love your videos bud, they are so high quality, clear and overall enjoyable!
A give away Jesus Christ haven't heard that from anyone in a minute all I hear from other YouTube is how get your balls to thank you with manscaped but hey I'm down for a FNAF security breach give away
fusion love the vids keep it up
I love being early to his fnaf videos there so good pls do more😆
No way he just speedran the entire DLC in less than a day
Story is interesting
I love hoe determined he is to playing the game. Anytime i see a new FNAF game the first i go to is fusionZ and he never disappoints
Im wondering if there's a ending if you collect all the comics
Beans
This whole DLC is great was not expecting the scooper to make a grand return
Now I need to see what is up with chica's voicebox.
If you go to bonnie bowl and go in one of the bowling Bits you can find glamrock bonnie
An hour in and already 44k views that is how great this guy is👏🔥💯👍
Hi
Hi I’m a big fan I watch all your vids
You're my favourite gamer man!
I have this idea, at some point of the game in Roxanne raceway chicka sits down in the bathroom and maybe then you have to give her her vojce bocks back? And then same for other animatronics, thete was a playable arcade in Monty's golf
E
https://youtu.be/V2V6UrBW92M bonnie ?
This dlc it's really good
What my link of the real animatronic granrock bonnie
Dude make another  part when will we find Gregory
Your the best youtuber
Me like Roxy she cool
Tomorrow my birthday
yo
Fusion, are you going to do a video collecting all the collectibles?
Ok😊
I wonder what happens if you find all the comic pieces🤔
I need ringet my freind this
Steel wool really outdid themselves on this one
Are there more endings?
dlc was so much better than i expected
I love how you still keep the same vide and tone after 10 years, many YouTubers would have been burnt out but not you, you are amazing and I love watching every single video of yours
I want the dlc pls
Was that the scooper? This was an interesting ending. And if this is the final ending, then I guess this is it. Ruin was short but very interesting game. Especially of the original ending where Greg somewhat "killed" his friend. Though I hope there are more endings.
Hey fusion, go back to gator golf and do the golfing arcade machine
Did you know Roxy can Here so well she nose cassi and gregeri Apart
ruin was underwelming, not as happy for it, but poppy playtimes geting a big thing tomro so thats cool!
Fusion someone actually found granrock bonnie in bonnie bowling here the video linkhttps://youtu.be/V2V6UrBW92M
Dang I really appreciate you uploading all these videos! Thank you for your time spent on this!
I'm so happy that you spend your time to entertain us.
This dlc was beyond my expectations
Man, I remember when you speed uploaded the entirety of the original game including its secrets, and you did the same for the DLC props to you Well done.
That was good
this game never fails to impress me
WHERE IS THE CHICA VOICE BOX THING???
ok so apparently you can fix the chicka in the bathroom if you have her voicebox
Ruin
Hey fusion keep up the good work also can I get security breach
can i have a copy please
There’s a hidden room in the back right side of the bowling alley in chapter 7 that is hiding something big and I think it’s only unlocked if you deactivate a majority of wet floor sign.
Dam
an oculas and security breach (computer)
Fusion you should try to give chica her voice back  when shes deactivated in the bathroom
can i get that game
The Garten of BanBn influence on the fnaf sires is amazing
This dlc is better then regular security breach
Could i get dat security breach?
You are The best
Hi fusion I hope you have a good day and when I saw you upload the first video of the playthrough I was so happy I forgot it was night time and yelled "YES! ITS HERE" and woke up my family
The mimics mascot suit that he was wearing was actually Gregory I scroll down a couple comments how come no one else is saying this why can I only notice things that no one else can't please tell me someone else saw this
Bros been playing the game since it’s been released
Nice Video 👍
Hello
Man, MatPat will have a field day with this one. Or a panic attack. Maybe both?
I love you crazy sonic
Theres a video online of being able to repair chica, there must be a way to repair them all.
I’m loving this dlc so much asahhh😊
Yay
amongus
this is a good sires
This DLC is awesome!
Bro there is an another ending but it’s good you have to go to chapter 9 and when the mimic follows you like a chasing thing g what ever you have to check the left side and if you see Fred bear then go there and put on the mask and you will see the good ending so please pin me!
No blob?
To find chica look in the bathrooms maybe dont which chapter
sister location core!!!! no but the suit was kinda random.... lmao
Me at the first minute:SCOOP THE MIMIC
Love the SB ruin D dlc
there might actualy be a burntrap ending because when you look at the picture of fnaf sec. breach on steam there is burntrap on the right wich his right hand in the light or it can be something about the mimic getting his right hand cut off i think it might be connected somehow
The fact that he completed the entire game in one sitting reminds me when god of war ragnarok came out and ( i think ) EazySepazy completed it also in one siting
Imagine if this happened before help wanted and because Gregory killed her she ends up wearing the mask forever fusing with glitch trap turning into what you are in help wanted when you switch it into the glitch side where you see vanny getting closer
whatever you want
That was an awsome ending and i cant wait to see more. Im all caught up but will be eagerly waiting for the next video. I know you are excited too Fusion and your having fun, thats great but make sure you are getting rest, eating and drinking well too. 😊
I love your videos
I love fnaf
Can someone help me out here, so I’ve basically mimicked exactly what Fusion has done in this video yet every time that door is still closed? Is there any other requirements?
You really made my day with these videos, and your always so dedicated, thank you for being you
Good video. Now, take some sleep. You need it.🦊
If you complete all mini games you do get a secret ending.
OH MY GOD. I just made a post about how the Ruin ending reminds me of Little nightmares 2 ending (yknow kids betraying each other and falling down), and now and animatronic that is kinda styled in the little nightmares vibe what's going on the heck is he
Hey fusion, if you go back to Bonnie’s bowl nearby the Freddy’s pizzaplex sign you will see a staff bot, and vent and if you climb inside the vent and go in this tiny room you can see glamrock Bonnie
Try to find chica and give her her voice box
My friend is upset on how glitchtrap looks and she is a FNAF fan a big one
it owuld be neat if i got security breach
Fusion when are you going to let me sleep  “stay tuned””another video” fusion please its 12am i need rest
Idk if i heard properly but if you could idk like to have sb
From 2-10 am this man somehow uploaded 7 videos and completed the entire game and is finding more secrets then people did in the first week of security breach (hard estimation could be wrong asf lol) What. The. Hell.
I was not expecting Steel Wool to actually be upfront about whether Tales is canon or not, including The Mimic, but this entire segment seems to be up-front about it
First DLC, Movie, and now FNAFVR2
That was a crazy ending
Mimic
this looks like a lion suit right? I thought it looks like a dinosaur, but when you look at it at like 6:27 it looks like a lion. But it looks more like an easteregg than a fnaf animatronic??? Cause what the heck is a lion animatronic?????///////
bonnie is in a secret room in bonnie bowl. next vid go there and look around the walls, there will be a hole, that is where he is
Hi
I can't wait for the other endings to be discovered.
The ruins of fnaf is here
My guys is juat doing dlc now lol
DLC is so nice just wish it was on Xbox 😂
What a shocker
I am playing this dlc when I get home from work.
I hate how, despite how awesome this DLC is, it still leaves us with some serious questions unanswered. Was Burntrap really the Mimic, or were they both just trapped under the Pizzaplex separately (in which case, what happened to the Blob and Burntrap?)?  At least we know this probably(?) takes place after the 3-star ending, what with the headless Glamrock Freddy encounter, and the "Fredbear ending" showing Grgeory "hiding" with Vanessa and Helpy (Was Freddy uploaded into a Helpy to give him a proper body again after being reduced to a head?).
Ill just ask for something small. Can i have a fifa 18 xbox 360 edition as always keep up the good work. ❤🎉   (Tell me if i have to ask for a dlc of this or i can actually choose what i want. If i actually have to choose for the DLC this will be embarresing 😅)
IM STILL WONDERING OF ROXY ALIVE CAUSE IF NOT IM A CRY MAN
thx a lot for what you are
10/10 like always
I did
This guy is the champ ngl
YEah the DLC is really good i re=lly hope i get it
So fusion turns out that there is repairing parts for all the animatronics so if you get them all maybe it leads to a canon ending? All the repair parts are at their zones for example roxys eyes are at a arcade at roxys racing, montys claws are at a arcade in montys golf. Theyre hidden like the chica one. But some people said you also gotta find montys legs im not sure but you should check. 😊and you can repair them when theyre knocked out
At this point this is probably one of my favorite horror games of all history 👁️👄👁️
Bro is poppin these vids out way too quick 💀
wow that is cool
These endings are so abrupt, especially given there's wildly different outcomes. Having no ending cutscene just feels really unfulfilling. It just kinda... ends.
Does another ending at the Freddy Fazbear cut out if you put on the masks at the chase scene just search for the cut out
I'm blown away  like wow I'm at lost of words the DLC is just something else! And thank you Fuzion for the grind staying a whole night just to complete the DLC your a chad 🦾🦾🦾
did you guys find whats up with the mop bots???? damn this dlc really compensates security breach!
I think what happens is that since the mimics ded, Cassie can head up through the elevator, and maybe take Roxy with her to find Gregory.  Also this game seems to heavily relate to the books. You can see the mimic inside the suit, like how it wears stuff to trick people
this makes me want to play this game. you can just tell how much effort was put in to every little cut scene.
Um there's a human mouth in that suit sooo basically the mimic is enard reborn like William
Can I have copy of the game
I'm sorry, what the hell, I opened up all the doors, but the mimic isn't wearing a suit, and the door isn't open. Someone help
mr birb 7
I saw the camera on the first vid
man this dlc is so good!
The DLC is a lot of fun.
PIZZAAAAAAAA
Can I have a wireless Oculus Quest 2
hi
butter
Heya fusion
Let’s go fusion. Where is my ruin?
Whatever you want aaa
I KNEW IT WAS REAL
I HAVENT SLEPT YET
FUZION FIND THE FAZ COINS THEY ARE NEAR THE WATERFALL AREA
The doors dont open chapeter 9
Guy in the mouth it’s a human so it’s not the micmit
I feel like if you made a game then you would make it insane
this looks so fun
Hi
hi we were right the mimic is burn trap he escaped the blob to do this and William died decades ago
It seems that in the games canon the mimic dressed up like a lion instead of a tiger?
Z gamer I've been watching you for a long time I've liked every video pls sned me security bread for xbox pleeeeease😢😊
There is a part when chica is sitting on the floor in the bathroom, mabye you can put the speaker box back in to her?
can you pls try to give chica his voice box? in toilted she will lay down and than try giving it to her i think she will tell you something important
Security breach pls
I respect your commitment to playing this all within such a short span of time
Fusion how long ya think this “certain something” will take? CUZ I CANT WAIITTT
You’re one of the first people I’ve seen get this ending
That Freddy's hand look at it
Since your doing a give away I didn't have security breach yet at all if you do give I have a Xbox and security breach on it  I like to get security breach I never played it yet sadlySince your doing a give away I didn't have security breach yet at all if you do give I have a Xbox and security breach on it  I like to get security breach I never played it yet sadly

Spoiler:     Glamrock Bonny is somewhere..
i have now commented and liked on every video i hope i win lmao
I think this is the best ending scott is truly the master at letting yourself be confused
This dlc is good but Monty’s destroyed 😢😢😢😢😢😢
WOAAAAH!!
Yeeeet
Can the person that wins the give away choose the platform on which they can have the game?
DLC baby
Mother of all ice scream
This dlc is massive
😂
Please give me
With all of the information I have gathered I have came up with half of what might have happened so first I'm pretty sure that the mimic was copying Gregory because well it wants to be someone it doesn't really know who it is so it copies people and well I'm pretty sure I was right and just know I watched all of your episodes on the finafta ruin and and one and I'm not talking about finapp ruin I'm talking about the security breach the the one before security breach ruin you will see Vinny just somehow teleporting around and so just magically teleport to you and something like that so it's clear that that mask gave her that abilities and she said that she heard voices in her head like you did when you put on the mask cuz you didn't notice that you only hurt those voices when you put on that mask but I did and there is some places that you couldn't go with that mask on so that shows me that there is some places after they don't want Danny to go or restricted to Vani and also tabled a lock on so that's probably how it managed to get stuck on her face for so long the moment she puts that on it probably just got stuck on and there it is and that's also how she manages to get into some places that were not able to get get into that mask letter go into there but you went into that fireplace and well I'm not sure if Annie could go there couldn't but it seems like a glitch world see see mentioned something of she had like two personalities but I guess those two personalities have two different worlds and that's haf of what I have to say. and can you pout me in the cpitichon for the game please
I wonder what happened to afton
Security breach pls I liked
You Are The Best, Can You Try To Not Destroy Roxy? When You Try To Reboot Her Press Escape So You Won't Destroy Her. You're My Favourite Youtuber :)
E
10/10! All best FNAF videos! 💯
That is a tiger costume that is suspicious also scoop
nice video
You can give Chica back her Voicebox after she walks into the bathroom of the salon. I recommend you Locate and play any other arcade games and beat them. Perhaps you can get the pieces to repair our favorite animatronics?   I wonder if finding Roxy's eyes (if they exist) and putting them on her when she's pinned under the fork lift would provide us a different ending?
Your the best youtuber I Know thanks for everything
Bro is speedruning at this point lol
Just a question how does Roxanne Wolf come back to us at the end of the game even though we turn her off my theory is when Roxanne Wolf hold Cassie's arm Roxanne wolf said  sorry and then she apologized and then near the end we turn her off I think we reset her program and now she's friendly
I really want to play ruin
hope i win bcs i didnt know u needed security breach to play ruin dlc  but gl everyone
Well you said to say whatever you want. So, whatever you want.
Bro matpat is going to be so busy that it will probably Take him weeks and maybe months because this theory will be very good
i actually love this game
I like the dlc but it’s not that good I miss old FNAF 😔
Dlc for this game is amazing
My theory is that Cassie is like a clone of Vanny from the past and Glitchtrap cloned her if you look at the poster she has blonde, not brown or she is Vanessa's daughter but this is just a theory it could be because of the lighting but I don't know tho. :)
Wooooooooooooo
bannana
That kinda looks like a Iion suit if you look at it closely
I wonder what the next fnaf game steel wool is going to make
The animatronic thing is probably Leroy or Leo the lion
Whatever you want
Which ending for the Yellow Washroom sign Deactivation? and if you find Bonnie?
In less than 9 hours you already got the secret ending.. HOWW
Give away
GImme fanaf
I’ll take a copy of the game, I really wanna play it
Hey Fusion maybe there is an ending unlocked after collecting everything in the inventory
fusion i had to sleep hor an hour i couldnt wait to see another vid xD
I really love the attention to detail for the whole game. From the fact you can understand little by little that Gregory is evil or the actual graphics.
That mimic costume reminds me of one of the animatronics in a FNaF fan-game, I guess it is called Teltale's or something like that, a dragon (or at least lizard based) themed task-based game where instead of nights there were hours. Somebody who recognises it please write it down to me because I forgor💀
Hi I’m back
Can I get fnaf plz
There’s a candy cadet ending
woo part 7 of the series!
Bro the are always plots twists to these games like little nightmare 2 when six betrayed mono now Gregory betraying Cassie hopefully there’s a part 2 to this dlc maybe eclipse will help her or Roxy still might be alive  to help her
It’s so crazy to me that no one is really talking about how when yu are on the Monty ride before the catwalk Freddy is dark then also decapitated after Monty is “rocking a storm” like that’s some lore if I don’t say so myself
Dam man take a break for a hour
Calm down my guy you are pure crazy
Please me want
Give away
I'm not very clued up on modern-day FNaF lore - what's the significance behind the Mimic's suit at 6:27?
cassie sweep
MY SOUL LEFT MY BODY WHEN THE MASCOT JUMPED AT THE CAMERA ;v;  ANYWAYS THANK YOU FOR TAKING YOUR DAY TO POST ALL THESE EPISODES :DDD
Hi fuzion
Fusion, I have an idea of you going back to roxy and when your doing the super easy puzzle deactivating her you can press escape and not do it instead, this is all just a theory though.
ruin!
I tried it but it didn't work
your videos are so enjoyable I watch them whenever I’m bored. They’re just so entertaining and fun😄
I love watching these videos so I can cope that i don’t have it.
hi🎉🎉🎉
Nice video!
William Afton looking headass ending
You're one of the best fnaf youtubers i didn't even knew you but now I know and I'm proud of me because I founded you
cool
I’m going to assume that the story will continue in help wanted 2? If not I will start a riot
This suit looks like freddy fazbear from the cartoons, could it be the first version ? Maybe steelwool's version of golden freddy ?
So Jen cool
13 hours?!? Holy moly, Fusion is a beast!
I love your videos they make my day❤
im waitin for part 8 lol
one of the worst secret endings in videogame history
Yeah
6:29 WOW! Well matpat will sure have a long day theorizing all this 😂
Dont forget about the gator golf game itself  when you first enter montys area
Love your content
Oh my Chica
I mean it's definitely a cool ending but like, what's the point?
Matpat is gonna have a field day with this.
Well I subscribed and now I will "say anything I want" meow
omg i commented😮
Thank you FusionZGamer for these videos on the new dlc
I did I’m at the final video
Glitchtrap is the security that is preventing you from freeing the animatronic in the ending
im so happy with what they did with roxy
Nice work
I think what will happen with the other secret is that as we saw when he completed the mini game       he got a voice box. Just like that after playing the other games he will eventually get the rest of the missing animatronic parts and restore each of them to so something. My guess is to defeat the mimic or something along those lines.
Last video for the day maybe
Yo you are killing it fusion keep going I’m loving this
This dlc is amazing
dude really has been playing all night
Heyhey
Yo
Every time I watch one of your play through videos as soon  I finish one I see another ones out. one of the best qualities of fusion Z gamer
i have been subscribed to you for years thank you for the content
You better make the most flashiest thumbnail if you find bonnie
Thank you for doing all of this for us❤
Can’t believe the chica voice box nice job
Hi
Lol
The DLC is amazing
Aaa i cant wait to see matpat disect this!
Big black monkeys
I KNOW THEIR IS A REAL ENDING BECAUSE THE HOLE OBJECTIVE IS TO FIND GREGORYYYYYYY
This spirit is definitely one of my fava
This dlc feels like a fever dream to me.
FIRST HOUR SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Love the Dlc so far
Rip cassie and i like goats 🐐
this has been a really fun ride thus far and I'm really enjoying it
God damn it fusion. The game only just came out.
bing chilling
Fuzion still surprised me to this day also I just figured out that burntrap could have possibly been the mimic all this time but hey that’s just a theory A Fnaf Sbr theory.🤓
Wait in base sb molten Freddy comes down and takes burntrap like this ending the scooper comes down takes the mimic and destroys it
I also think for Security Breach Main Game the ending of Freddy and Gregory escaping from Afton and the Blob mashed up with Gregory leaving with Vanny and Freddy’s Severed Head is the true ending (basically a combination of the two) it would explain why Glamrock Freddy has no Head when chasing us and it would explain who Gregory’s Friend he hesitantly mentioned to Cassie is Vanny but I think last minute Vanny had second thoughts and told Gregory it’s too Dangerous and he unfortunately agreed with her saying it’s too dangerous for Cassie to meet up with him revealing where they are staying so I Cassie falling down the elevator shaft I think is not her death but I believe she won’t be walking away unharmed from the incident
I love how as soon as I wake up he already has so many episodes for the dlc. Also could I get the game
I was watching through the game and I was thinking back to sister location and how ennard was able to trick us into thinking he was baby until the end where we got scooped. Then this mimic thing comes outta nowhere and does the same thing to Cassie and then gets scooped. I'm pretty sure that the mimic is just ennard. Keep in mind that we never saw what happened to ennard after that, So it's very possible.
I won’t be able to sleep tonight
There is also an ending when gregory betrays you
waiting to see if you can find some good ending. love your fnaf series! :)
Hellooooo
Okay, this ending doesn't involve Roxy calling out Cassie in the credits roll, which makes me sad to presume about the other ending where Cassie ended up in an elevator: it's more likely that the voice calling out to Cassie as the credits roll is actually Mimic copying Roxy's voice. Simply put, Roxy didn't make it as she sacrificed herself to protect Cassie from Mimic.  It's saddening to see Roxy gone just when she gets her redemption arc, unless if there's any way that we can save this MVP of an animatronic from undeserved fate.
Fnaf
Ya
Btw I'm pretty sure Gregory escaped the pizza plex
I wonder if they will have more DLC's
i wouldnt of completted the game so fast
Love the FNAF vids keep up the good work
I love your content! Thank you for spending so much time up late at night with your friends to find the endings for us!!
There a game that scout made it not FNaF with chipper I think that the suit  of the wood chipper !!!
I see something red in the mimics mouth could be afton or another person that got springlocked (or im just wrong)
i think the suit is a differant bonnie cause i feel like ive seen a bonnie like that somewhere i think its spring bonnie
I hate you not just you every YouTuber i see I log onto YouTube and I see like 50 fnaf ruin dlc spoilers (I don’t actually hate anyone I’m just annoyed lmfao I love you and your videos)
I can't wait for him to hack the game
this dlc is the best dlc ecsept from celeste farewell
Curious people first instinct when going in to a room be like 7:15
Dang
Tomorrow is my bday
Fuzion u shoud check the present inside the Glamrock freddy in the GlamShoter thing i forgor how its caled the *prototype* chaise cause it may be a secret , and i am sure theres a way for it
WAIT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS PART TO SEE WHAT TO DO WITH THE BEAK
What if this "Glitchtrap" is actually an AI Glamrock Bonnie and he's been trying to stop us and anyone else from letting the mimic go free no matter what he has to do. Since Glitchtrap is a color scheme of yellow and purple. And this one is more Blue.
This ending was really cool. It was a little weird though too.
I don't understand the praise....this DLC offers nothing. No story reveals, no mention who the main character is or why she is there, no explanation as to why Greggory would betray her, no metion or reveal of Afton (is he even in this series anymore) no information on the mimic as to why its there or what purpose it serves,  and no clue how glitchtrap connects to anything. Was virus bonnie glitchtrap, or something else. Where did it come from? Nothing makes any sense.
this dlc surprised me so much
Yo fusion I like the vids I watched you when I was a bite size you had cheered me up in the past keep up the good work😁
Cant wait for the next vid
I’ve happened to notice the mimics suit is wearing some sort of sweater and it has the letter B on it. This could lead to some crazy theory’s
i think the suit is the teaser of the monkey that steal wool showed us
You are the best men thanks for uploading  video you are really working hard we know
Bro you need to sleep man
Hi
Fusion is literally the best YouTuber I've seen his devotion is amazing icl he is amazing he makes watching anything that are usually uploaded days easy to watch since he makes them not even hours apart its amazing favourite person rn
Fusion I might be wrong but judging by the fact you got chicas voice box from her arcade and you were able to play monty golf. You might be able to get his claws-
Am I the only one that thank the mimics costume is a lion?
First!
aaaaaaaaaaaa
Bro said "Ruin dlc? I got you."
Fusion deserves a reward for completing this game in what, one sitting? Thanks so much
I did not imagine there being more than those 2 endings but this dlc has me shocked
W
What if you try playing gator golf and a secret Roxy game and you might get the claws and the eyes
Why did it end of the cliffhanger?😢
Interesting
Hi
I want fnaf SB
Mad respect for all the uploads of the DLC you've done Fusion!
Cant wait for the next ep, this DLC is INSANE
When you ask for a scoop of ice cream at the zoo (The zoo ran out of ice cream
The DLC is very good
try also play more secret arcades and maybe you can get parts of that prototype freddy and monty
When the next one coming out
Hi fusion
I was just binge watching the entire series and finished the final episode to discover this one😂
This must have taken a long time to find
Where’s part 6
I dont think I'll ever see Gregory the same way ever 😭
Also Try Give Chicas Beak To Chica and She might help you
Yes this is the best dlc
I think the new suit is a way to end the "old" fnaf tineline while still having fnaf
SCOOP THERE IT IS
This is very cool
i love your videos fusion!
We need to see the Chica beak ending
Fff
Hello This is the Best DLC
A question that I have is do you use steam on pc?
Love the dlc
Wow you really uploaded these vids quick! Thanks for covering the dlc right when it came our :D
i wonder what the next game is
Oh my dude this dlc has more and more content the more you look into it
I was watching the other video then i saw this video
A heads up is you can use that voicebox to fix Chica when she deactivates
If you also could get Monty’s claws you may be able to open that door where you first find Monty in bace game
Best DLC ever
There is still more fazcoins so you can still hear the story of the woman and the boy in the cabin from candy candet
🦕
great vids
this game looks so cool. wish i had it fr fr
GOD 13 hours
7:45 is that a letter "B" on the animatronics jacket?!?!?!  That's giving me aload of questions with answers that i'm sure you can solve...
I just watched the 6 parts and boom part 7 i wonder how many parts there will be in total
i feel like the suit is a monty suit. cause if you compare it to the cutouts the hair looks similar. not just that, it looks like a reptile like a gator. so this may have been a monty walk around suit before he was introduced to the pizza plex. like- its possible cause he could have been from another location
If you can find roxy eyes( you probley can like chika vocie box) what if you have roxy eyes and go to cutseen the roxy say GIVE ME AM EYES and you can give it?
Umm I can’t play the dlc, when I press play ruin, it just tells me what it is about and nothing else, please help
Noice govana.
we need this to be canon
What a blessing with the uploads
Ruin
If you can get the chica beak i wonder if you can get Roxy's eyes and monty's hands
im sorry to say this but uhh, this is one of the best boss fights ever, its so lit! : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnQAMBq4D_0
THIS IS AMAZING!!! Thanks for the dedication.... now go get some sleep.
Yea
So is this lion mimic thing like the canon parallel to the White Tiger animatronic from the books?
I loved this video! Cant wait for the next one.
Looks like its time for matpat
I’m cool
is it supposed to be some gregory skin suit
Good luck to everyone!
You really have to appreciate how Fusion was able to get a ton of endings within the first few hours of the DLC releasing. keep up the good work!
Really awesome video
So what I’m getting here is that all the Fazbear locations that ever existed (or most locations) are on top of each other?? Like they’re constantly built on top of each other???
Up what the heck is that thing!!!
E
"Forever and ever and ever!"
The dlc is the best in my opinion
I just realized what the rabbit is doing, it’s trying to stop you from releasing the mimic, because when you deactivated the security, it got sucked into it, the rabbit isn’t a bad guy, he is trying to stop you from releasing the mimic.
Steel Wool finally knows what they’re doing
Bro completed the whole dlc  Also that mimic with the suit on was hilarious
I think this is a sneak of the sister location in help wanted 2. Possibly a mimic prototype is found there?
If I’m honest, which I am, I’m glad that William Aftons story ends. This new glitch rabbit isn’t Glitchtrap. The BurnTrap ending isn’t canon, the end of his legacy in FNaF 6, I’m glad steel Wool studios and Scott did this
wow whacky DLC
Can I pls have copy? I don’t mind if not but it’s worth asking
i cried when roxy got deactivated
This dlc was so fire
I hear there's a bunch of plot here that can only be explained by reading the books, which sucks if we the player don't have access to them. A real wtf what now moment
Hey  I love your content  and your amazing
This man is a legend
I still don't know how you find out of you won
Hi
I clicied on this so fast😂
I LOVE when you play games like this game, its just a huge enjoyment♥♥♥
7:47 I swear am I going crazy or is mimic doing the family guy death pose
Hey we need game theory here😂
12 to 15 hours of constant careful gameplay of RUIN, damn the dedication fusion has to allow us fans to see all things about the game is really admireable
I used to own the game on my old ps4 but it got stuck in a rebooting mode and I used ti have security brews h rip
bussin
I want to get security breach so I can find a ending to save Roxanne. Also could it be that that costume is the original tiger costume. Because that’s the mimic.
Did someone call a DJ 😅
What just happened??
no fusion comment yet which means no new video yet ): (bro I’m kidding get some sleep)
It's interesting how from the trailer it seemed like there were things in Ruin that paralleled the Princess Quest games - Chica with conveyor belts, the green & purple colours, the inverted Steelwool logos being like the 2 versions of Cassidy, & the OG Vanny mask.  Now Ruin's released we can see even more parallels to Princess Quest (all of the above plus) imagery of the black glitchy creatures from Princess Quest, the golden sword from the game, the eyes seen through the Vanny mask that appear in cracks in the walls, and imagery of the purple glitchy form of Glitchtrap. However the one thing that hasn't been found yet is the Glitchtrap plushie, which was a key item in Princess Quest. It's interesting that it hasn't been found yet, if included in the game at all and if so I wonder why it would be excluded.
I honestly thought Glamrock Bonnie was gonna show up in that one video
"Get scooped, idiot." - Something I said when watching the Mimic get grabbed.
Aboute
whatever you like
SECURITY BREACH PLS
Waht abstellen you press exit bei roxy
DLC TIME WHOOOOO!!!!!
PLS I NEED SACURIATYU BLEACH ON MA PC AND NEED DDLC
I bet that thing he is talking about at the end is the stuff I found in the game files
Thank you Fusion for searching all the secret endings and giving us high quality content ❤
imma need this for ma pc
IT RELEASED LAST NIGHT HOW ARE YOU ALREADY ON PART 7
Hi
I’m exited
is it just me or is the dlc better than the real game
Choose me please I never win at this 😂
Hi fusion what if you get the claws from gator golf arcade since chica's arcade gave you her voice box
FNAF Security Breach
I ment yay
GET Speep💀
ОООООУУУ ЭССС
LOL
Fusion I think you should try to give chicas voice box wink wink 😉 when she is sitting down at the bathroom
Idk if I can enter inf times but I am getting him revenue
EIIO
Hi
Believe it or not, it’s another potato!
Ok then this is interesting the fact the mimic is wearing a lion costume could be a refence to the story in the books the mimic, where a boy carries around a tiger but in this version it a lion
Theres a point in the game where chica sits down. Is it possible to put the beak on her?
7:29 GOT EM.
im still shocked that Gregory killed cassie
Bread
Gay
You have pure dedication
Oh the dlc is better then i thaught nice
Can someone explain me what means that suit?What is?What animal even is it's like a triceratopo or something?
Imagine A DLC Being Miles Better Than The Actual Game Lol
I am at my grandparents house thanks fusion!
ngl thats sick
Nah jit made this hole series in 8 hours hes a legend
Funny costume haha
i haven’t watched the video yet but judging by the thumbnail its gonna be glamrock bonnie! cant wait!
I 100% thought that was a mod at first then I realized that wouldve been too fast
thanks for an epic video and even better series!
Roxy: "Cassie run!" Cassie: *stands there* Roxy beaten up: "Where are you!" (Talking to the Mimic) Mimic: "Nowhere just putting on my 9000 dollar fancy suit to flex and then kill your friend stupid ugly animatronic♥" Cassie: "WHAT DID YOU SAY?!" Cassie: "Ima end this Mimics whole career" Cassie: "Can you help me?" Scooper: "Dont mind if i do" Mimic: "Come here Cassie it wont hurt a bit!" Cassie: "Here cow" Mimic: "Dinners ready for me.." Scooper: "You mean my dinner" *scoops* Michael Afton: "History repeats itself"
Ok

UR MISSING AN ENDINGGGFG
great video
the DLC is better ngl
wow.
I like it
Ruin better than security breach?  👇
Am not doing the ruin dlc till I complete the first one so it makes sence
this is so much cooler than I thought lol!!
I love the DLC btw if you search up freddy un used voice lines in shorts it starts saying weird stuff or it would be mimic we don't know if you get all parts im wondering if you can make freddy's head or maybe find the head sorry if this isn't clear sorry its just my theory
this man upload faster than i can watch all the vids dang!
Try fixing chica with the beak
I hope this version is cannon cbecause fck Gregory. Justice for Cassie!
NeW VID LES GoOOOOOOOOOOOO
Matpat gonna be in the hospital when the next fnaf theory comes out
Thats a cool but very confuseing secret ending. Someone call metpat on this. This dlc looks great! Its like its just 2 games for the price of one.
DLC,DLC,DLC WOO HOO
The mimic is dead! FNAF lore has been saved!
Tbh i wish to know from where REALLY are Gregory & Cassidy and how they knew eachother and how all happend to get to this point.
i hpoe there are a lot of endings
My heart is doing 360’s rn.
Omg I need this game
1.4k
i love your chennal
Try giving checa her voice box back
I think now since each mini game gives you the parts of that animatronic so if you go back to Monty gold at like chapter two or three you can get his claws.
What’s with the prototype Freddy tho, and the mimic I need the lore for them
I have a theory that the rabbit that chases you is just a digital security bot type of thing and is stopping you from unleashing the mimic
I think you might be able to get Monty’s claws by getting all hole in ones in Monty golf
Ruin DLC!!!!!!!
roxy might of done some damage that resulted it

While the whole DLC is good, the endings seem rushed,  incomplete. I would even say that Security Breach has better shown and explained endings.
If u seee this i havea theory So u know when u play the game and u see a elevator falls right? My theory gregory killed a person and the 2nd one is cassie (if my grammar is bad pleae correct it)
You! You are a legend! How did you find this? You are an absolute king bro! Even if I don’t get the copy of security breach, I have already watched everything about it and I feel like I’ve already played it! Thanks bro! Your videos are awesome! Can’t wait for the next one! Bye!

Honestly, like most other people say in this comment section. This DLC is a lot better then I thought it would be. I love how... well ruined it is and how destroyed everything looks.   I still wonder if there is gonna be another game or another DLC thay is connected to this one cause the first ending left us on a cliffhanger that is for sure.
Yo
Matpat was right the amalgamation is real
please give me fnaf sb i rlly want to play but im poor ;-;
Pls sb
This DLC is getting more confusing
Nice video
I think I know in one of the latest tales from the pizzaplex novels in the epilogue a female character hides in a blue dog suit and the mimic forces himself into the suit with the female still in their an dthen she dies and mimic wears the corpse
U love this. Never was able to play it tho. Never was able to afford it. But still fun to watch keep up the good work!
This ending definitely feels so out of place to me. More so, just plain out confusing
I CANT KEEP UP WITH THESE VIDS   but thx for doing all parts with the vids
Ello
Switch
Is there a ending where we actually escape
ENDING ALREADY ???
With chicas beak when she goes to sit down in the restroom there will be an option that says give her back her voice box
No way that they made a scoped ending
I love  when he accomplishes his goals in games
how do i get the copy
I loved this so much I haven’t seen a whole play threw before
The normal ending is good. The other 2 ending literly makes 0 sense. Like what? What happend?
Huh?
Maybe the first encounter with the mimic also changes before the chase sequence in chapter 9
well, i guess this means that you can find it and it wasn’t only able to be activated with cheats
blin
The dlc have super secret endengs
I farted can I have the copy?
The suit kinda made the chase scene more funny. I love how Roxy is not really evil towards Cassie when she recognises her voice, the elevator ending is just... Gregory be savage, reminds me of the S2 ending for sonic prime.
I wonder if there’s an ending if you don’t deactivate any of the cleaning robots?
OK LETS WATCH.
i have a theory if you do all of the arcade cabinets you get animatroc parts ad you might be able to fix them for a ending
i swear in like 10 mins he will post part 8
I wonder what happens if you don’t reboot roxanne
My name is pablo
Thx you for staying up all night for this
Now this, is the good ending.
damn he still at it
Hear me out, if you get chicas voice box from and arcade game. And there is a Monty arcade game. Maybe you complete the games to get parts and fix the animatronics for a new ending?
I hope a part 8 drops
I’ll win
JEEZ PART 7
you really outdid yourself this is why i subscribed to you
Theory: so the mimics head got scooped off by the machine last vid we got a voice box and the monty gator minigame shud give the claws so we saw prototype glamrock freddy he was missing his head and the head  propaly can be put on glamrock freddy what if we  can somehow fix prototype glamrock freddy?
Maybe everytime you collect every secret he becomes complete... Just like glitch trap with the tapos
...
This dlc is amazing!
Maybe there is something special if you get all the collectibles?
Lol
SCOOPING ROOM?!
Whatever u want
I SAT AND WATCHED ALL THE DLC VIDEOS THAT HE MADE ITS SO ADDICTING BUT OMG, IT IS LITERALLT SO GOOD AND I CAN SMELL THE LORE AND THEORIES FROM A MILE AWAY LMAO
Bro the second my security breach updates im starting ruin and im speed running it. Also in one of the parts that thing is the wall that disappears try hacking there.
This DLC is FIRE
Amazing Videos As Always Fusion 👍👍👍👍 Very Cool
YEEEAAAHHHHHHH BUDDY
Does the scooping room in this ending as anything to do with the sister location one? Because they dont look simolar besides the windows
Something tells me this mimic might be the “Monster locked in the basement” that Candy Cadet was talking about..
I love your videos thats why i watch you keep up the good work
If you can get Chika's voice box, can you also find the other parts we stole from Roxy and Monty in the main game?
Eeeeeee
Hi
Wow this is so helpfull but i don,t have security breach
So mannyyy, theyre all so awesome i swearrr
There needs to be an ending where you escape the pizzaplex with Roxy
I will say that is freaky… was that really a scooper? Why was the mimic wearing it in that ending and not before?…. Im so confused
I feel like turning off every pat pat will give u something
What happens if you beat the monty gator golf game
To be honest I was tired when it was released, so I thought it was a contradiction to Security Breach, until I noticed the word “Prototype” on Freddy’s foot and realized that the one detail might actually show that the DLC takes place after burntrap.
You’re an absolute legend, dude! Thank you for your dedication!!
who else is here after staying up all night?
Wait what! ✋️ Thats crazy! Thanks for the ruin content btw it's been a treat watching you react and explore throughout your playthough!
For me it looks like the mimic is multipurpose kind of animatronic used by Fazbear. The Mimic is supposed to wear a costume and easily mimic the character of the  costume, no matter what it is. Maybe they were evem programmed to make it feel as if a real human was in those costumes? Maybe it was supposed to save Fazbear money in some way. A worker that doesn't need to rest and doesn't complain, while also creating an illusion of there being more human workers than there actually is
Also RIP to your sleep
Bro uploaded so fast then my dad leave me 💀
i need this pls
W for fusion he has been on this game for 15 hours and he is probably playing it right just for us to be entertained and see all the endings . I wonder where glam rock bonnie is ??
Its a nice ending😮
Can somebody say rip to the poor matpat after this dlc?
This video released as I was watching the last one
You can put chicas beak in chica if you wait until she sits down in the bathroom when she like powers down you can put the speaker box into her again, you can also find montys claws in the machine we saw ealier on in your series the golf one and notice freddy has a present in his chest i will bet you any money that is his head that you can reattach, i have yet to find roxys eyes  but i bet that will be another ending👍👍 if that helps
look in the mouth of the suit.
Already posted??? Thats early
Im glad it isnt as buggy as sb was on launch
Yay
So excited to see all the endings of security breach. Your so awesome fusion love your vids
It’s so crazy how Freddy is the bad guy and Gregory but the sad part is Cassie rebooting Roxy when she powers down but when you meet the mimic she saves your life
Freddy fat bear

Very nice dlc😊
I liked and security breach

DONT FORGET THE CHICA VOICEBOX!
Hello
Ruin time
The dlc is SUPERRR GOOD but HOW MANY VIDEOS IS THIS MAN GONNA MAKE IN A DAY
bro posted the whole game in the past few hours
"Anything you want"
Hi
This dlc is so amazing and I love this amazing gameplay from u
This is why I watch you!
Copy
Ple give me fnaf sb
You can repair chica with the voice box so I guess there is an ending if you repair all animatronics
Have you tried giving the chica voice box back to chica in the starting area?
WOAH THIS IS COOL , But i'm in the phone i cant play fnaf security beach ruin. :(
This DLC is so big. It's basically a whole new game.
And I would like SB
hope is burntrap ending
An idea for a different ending. When chica is deactivated in the bathroom give her the voice box. Also, if you play Monty golf you could the claws and give them too Monty. Maybe the same thing with Roxy.
fresh juice
😅❤❤❤❤
oh dang thats fast ;-;
Yes, sir
Hello this was a great video
im saying what ever i want
Bro been loving your content and tbh I don't think security breach deserves as much hate as it does
>:)))
I wonder if there are really 6 endings😮
W video
Take a brack bro
My brain has fried after watching this game
Hhj
Hello I’m back again
Dlc ruins 2 release
I really need security breach now after the dlc is out
😂
Oh
I think this ending is canon.
bro fnaf is getting more cool
Are you okay fuzion you have made like 7videos in least than a day
Yooo! Mimic with that suit really surprised me there, does he have more than this suit?
To me, the suit looks similar to how I'd assume the first version of Fredbear would look, and if we are to believe that matpat is correct about how the fazbear entertainment cooperation started (Afton making stiched together suits) then it could be a suit that the Mimic has been holding on to for awhile. not to mention all the Fredbears Family Diner collectibles(main game) and cutout (ending) it could be pointing to that. I'm gonna rewatch this to try and get a better look at the suit though
FUSION WHAT IF YOU GET MONTY CLAWS FROM GATOR GOLF
This DLC was definitely worth the wait its so good
Hi
I liked and sub
Hey when that computer asks if you continue to proceed maybe you should click no
Can I get a copy of sec breach pls
What costume this mimic wear
We appreciate all your hard work bro
I want FNAF security breach on PS4 please
I WANT SB
I respect Steel Wool for making the DLC free but even tho its free i still cant play it cause i dont have SB but i would prefer watching Fusion and Dawko playthrough it
There’s another ending if you don’t kill Roxy
fusion: youre not the real gregory, youre evil! im not talking to u. the real gregory: will not hesitate to kill anyone for him and glamrock freddy
But please can i get a copy i want this game so much
Can I get a dlc pls😢
You know when chica is deactivated. I was thinking you could use the voice box  on her and make her active again, and she might be friendly to you and get a secret ending of some sort
Ice cream time >:D
Thumbnail: that’s not them…
This was crazy bro
Fusion your always the first i watch on new games and dlcs you and cory are both my fav youtuber and you and cory also inspired me to make my own channel so thank you 😊
I love ur vids
Try to find the dj music man
Can you get me a pc bc I wait to play with you fusionZgamer
Meby get all comic pages and give chica the beak
I want to call the glitchtrap thing, “Errortrap”
Is he gonna find Roxy's eyes
I love you❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
hi fz
Dlc going crazy holy
Bread
Holy shit I was watching the past videos and this was just dropped!
I just realised where is the blob? Surely there’s going to be a blob ending
Who was that guy that got scooped
7 vids in one day the hell
He will become the first player to complete security breach ruins
Matpat bout to have an all you can eat buffet 😂
Now im watching them one more time on the phone and tv
I think the mimics suit is a handsewn suit like glitchtraps suit for help wanted. It may be a very early suit like the glitchtrap one, maybe before fredbears.
I have gotten no sleep waiting for these videos to come out
Watching all these videos makes me kinda regret refunding the game after being bored by the original
Hi! :)
Did you know if you have the voicebox there is a option to repair chica
Foot 2
secreat endings are cool
Honestly this is so good that I’m probably gonna rewatch this
I think for another ending you have to go back and beat arcade games. Aka the one at Monty’s raceway and it gives his claws, and maybe there’s one in Roxy’s raceway for her eyes…
cool
Hopefully I could get a copy
I think its a knock off Gregory costume that he's wearing
Never would have guessed that the scooping room would return
He has months Mohawk and chica a beak
Yooo
nice vid
another?!?!? bro.. its been like, a singular day
Bro made lots of videos of sb ruin in one day
Can you send me a copy please ruin dlc
bros uploading at the speed of light👍       hope i win
I respect the grind
WOW BRUH 7 EPOSIDES IN ONE NIGHT THIS RIDICULOUS ONLY FOR USSS AND YOUR SELF.
I adore when games have multiple endings, it makes the storyline 10x better purely because of replay value and it feels like your own story
Binge watching at 3am this is gonna be fun to decipher the lore
what abt the voicebox of chika that u got?
did you try to sneak up on chica and repair her beak...? that might work
bros grinding
I love the fnaf franchise but security breach is the only game i dont have it would make my world if you  manage to get me the game but if you dont i still love your content
Maybe the new animatronic is fredbear, but the ears are more like springbonnie, maybe It could be a new animatronic from fredbears family dinner
Can I have security breach for my kid?
Apparently there are minor variations to the normal ending. I remember watching a stream where before the credits started playing after the elevator fell, Roxie said "...Cassie...?".  There's also a way to repair at the very least Glamrock Chica's voicebox, so there may be other ways to fix the other main animatronics
I wonder if MatPat can explain the mimics costume.
Hi fusion
Will you b. Playing roblox arcived nights
For real fusion get some rest I’m so happy you’re making more videos of the DLC that I wait for please get a break
I love that it has all these secrets!!
I think he's gonna find glam rock bonnie in the next video
bruh fusion come on homie give me that copy bro. i love you ;) sleep dreams.
Where part 8
That scooper thing leaves so many questions.
I can't wait to see what the other secret is in the next one!!! Fusion really is a machine Lol
Jesus fuck, this was a crazy joy ride.
ANOTHER ENDING
7 video in day world record and good
@FusionZGamer when chica passes out in the bathroom give her, her voice box EDIT:he ain't gonna listen to me is he...
Man get some sleep
dude you need to get some sleep
I love you😊
I swear these endings are just bad
Fuzion! FUZION GLAMROCK BONNIE IS IN THE DLC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
these secrects are amazing, sooo much lore.
Hi fusion can you play FNAF world fan game it’s been ages played one of them can you please play one? 😁😁😁😇😇😇😇
I liked and subscribed
At the part of the game where Roxy recognises Cassy, have you tried to press escape? I saw that was an option but i'm not 100% certain if it would work
I hate the ending where gregory betrays cassidy
Skibdi toilet
such a new interpertation of the fnaf franchise
Whatever you want
I love your content I watched all your videos
This is MF Doom.
Ruin has so many twists and the new mask mechanic is so unique, I love it!!!
THE youtuber Faz Faz made a video of giving chica her beak when you find chica broken in the toilets!
I need fnaf pls.......... I dont have the fnaf money
There is another secret too, idk if it has an ending, but you can give Chica back her beak. (It's in Roxy raceway, where she goes into the bathroom and deactivates)
Am I the only one who is annoyed that he completely uses up his stamina bar instead of letting it recharge right before it hits 0?
When roxy jumps in to deffend cassidy, is it possible to rin the opposite derection?
HEHEHEHAW
I literally waited forever for ruin to come out, so as soon as I saw these videos, I watched it immediately. I am so surprised of how good it came out. Many thanks to Fusion for putting so much effort to allow us to see the game and even discover so many secrets!
i SAY it again another video that is 45 mins after the last one go and sleep man Wvid tho
Keep up the good work!
bro isnt going to sleep
Dang bro youve racked up about 2 million views within 8 hours of the dlc
lm early boi
Anyone else notice that during the "shut down Roxy scene" that there was an option (Press ESC) to back out of doing the shut down?
All of the chapters for the secret are odd numbers is that supposed to mean anything?
honestly dude, what is going on, it gets crazier and more confusing the deeper u get into the game
Whatever i want
Hmm i wonder if the next game will take place in the past or something, SUPER EXCITED for the next vid tho
literally jumped out of my chair when i saw you upload this
I already know its gonna be good befire hand
Banarama
Hey fusion can you include me in one of your videos ?😇😇😇😇😇
Is there gonna be more endings for fixing the animatronics and for disable the wet floor bots?
When is he going to sleep?
DANG HE FAST HE BEEN BUSY
When I was scrolling down on YouTube and saw part 7 I said he really is a machine
"Today's video"
Woah i went to sleep and it is part 7
What if you get a ending for disabling all the wet floor bots
I get so exited whenever you post a new video. Keep up the good work man!
Hi fusion you are the best YouTuber I ever watched you’re the one who make me interested in the FNAF series I love you so much thanks for making my best childhood of your videos keep making more😊😊😊😊
You ready for Poppy Playtime???
38min
This suit looks a bit like fredbear or somekind of lion maybe steppe lion or smth or maybe dragon??? Idk good video fusion 😎
i need the copy i did all of dat if i get it tysm
I'm here
I really need the game
Fuzion do be speedrunning the new DLC, thank you for this wonderful work of yours!
🎉
People are starting to go to sleep The comments are getting lesser and lesser
This is really fun to watch 😊😊
fusion i would really like a copy of fnaf security breach on xbox or switch please i’ve been trying to watch all your fnaf videos and i really enjoy your content
Where is glamrock freddy where is he
I’ve never watched a video that was posted 41 mins ago
What if there is another ending where you collect every animatronic item. Monty's claws, Roxanne's eyes and chicas voicebox. You collect them from each arcade game, there may be a Roxy game you have missed. Maybe it changes the chase with Freddy or every other animatronic helps protect from the mimic instead of just roxy
This video is good
I love your videos
please me choose me pls  pls bor pls gib dlc pls
Try see if you can give chica her part i might give you a ending ( i don't know if it will work)
Wait what is that thought since it didn’t even look remotely fnaf
Bruh this video just released how did it get so much comments and likes already
I bet the 8-th episode of ruin is coming still today
I'm sorry SCOOPING ROOM ENDING?!
2:24 Why is there radioactive material in the Pizzaplex?
I absolutely am so happy you are making these every few hours
The real Gregory"
Now we just have to wait for Matpat make a video about the lore
Ive been up since 4:50am watching this series, I want to find out what happens after the elevator.
I woke up to this man being on chapter 9 and part seven, guess I've got things to catch up on.
I CANT wait this is so cool
The 7th episode this day, im wondering how much will it go on
Its to see FNAF security breach content again!
This is so amazinh
Xz
The new character eclipse is when moon or sun over lap Echothere
I liked, and I want Five Nights at Freddy’s Security Breach
This is crazy also I have not gone to sleep since the one three hours ago I hope you have fun figuring this stuff out.
is it an apart game?
Dude you need sleep🤣
We need to appreciate fusion for everything he does for us. This man has been up all night and he's still posting now.
Icl the new glitchtrap design is surprisingly terrifying
DLC is so exciting! The atmosphere beats the base game and the theories are going to be WILD after this. Please get some good sleep afterwards, drink some water, maybe go on a walk. You deserved this for staying up all night to record these gameplays.
I thought the dlc would suck but its amazing😮
i love how you can see the mimic eyes inside the suit
Damn, the mimic got scooped
sup boi
Can I get a copy of security breach please
Wait... Now that you have Chica's Beak  What would happen if you give it back to her while shes Decommissioned in her Chapter? Or if you gave it back to her when you First get Jumpscared by her in the First Chapter?
boooooooooooooooooooooggggggggggggggiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssssss
I just want to say thank you for your content
security breach pls btw love your content ur the bdest
bro is speedrunning through this dlc 💀💀
:D
he got scooped like ice cream my boy he more then dead he is a whole ice cream
Did he give chicka her voice box seems like you could after she sits down in the end
Hi may get security breach
It the good ending that what's missing you found the bad ending, fredbear ending and the scooper ending
Bro, No way this is real 😡, If this is fake this youtuber wasted few minutes of my life 😡 😡
🇬🇱
🎉
YOOOO
I cannot get over this thing
I love fnaf can't wait
Scooping
Amazing!
Im not ganna lie I do think that ending was  a meh like really i am not hating on anything but until there is more to see so I can understand what is happening then maybe but.... Next episode lets get it!
Finally I found someone who shows this ending
poor matpat 😭
THE SCOOPER???
Don't forget about that glam chica voice box that u found
YESSSS 🎉
This honestly gives me memories of your first playthrough
This guy got no sleep
hi

Anybody got this isue that you dont have a checkpoint for the daycare level
YOOOOOOOO

It's white Tiger  siut??????
Man I am so happy there is a ending where cassie doesn't die Fuzion z gamer plz stay healthy
What a legend for staying up for hours to post all these videos for us to see and the videos are amazing.
You did some collectible grinding off camera? Why not on camera tho.
this is hype baby!!!!!
This dlc is so crazy and I love it
Finally we are catches up to fusion taking time to make and post these videos
happy ur doing so many giveaways, sadly don't have anything to play security breach on except i have it for my switch which won't have ruined for a while 😢 but i'm happy watching u, pretty new fan, first time i watched u was at like 12am when u were uploading security breach when it first came out which i couldn't play because it wasn't on switch then love the content ❤
Now to find....
I've been watching fuision for along time and tried to get security breach but it's to much 💀💀💀💀💀💀
I think that you know when you shut off the security what if u press no instead of yes?
I thought the weird Dino character was a result of someone goofing with mods, WTF is that??
This DLC experience is completely something else. Something i was not expecting.
The dlc actually is scarier surprisingly
Whatever I want hope is was a funny joke
I'm not a big fan of this whole mimik thing
is thet glamrock foxy
Foe the arcade machines you might get the parts that Gregory took from the othe animatronics and possibly repair them somehow
I love how fusion will stay up all night for us to watch his amazing gameplay
Very nice game
IS HE GONNA PUT THE VOICE BOX IS CHICA IN THE NEXT PART BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW IF SHES GOOD LIKE ROXY‼️‼️‼️
I tink Cassie Is not dead
i like pancakes v7
Glamrock bonnie is her
w video
I really like your videos ❤️
W Fuzion bro
Im sure you already know, but you can put chica's vouce box back into chica, and im willing to bet that the gater golf arcade cabinet will give you monty's claws
There are too many Sister Location links in Security Breach for it not to be important.
So that suit idk it’s just not right it’s not an animatronic suit it’s a straight up costume like the eyes come out of the mouth is it possible that’s like the mimics original intended suit like we know it’s programming is meant to copy so it’s possible that suit was like a beta design for a possible restaurant that just never came into fruition
Fusion the speaker can be put in Chica after you leave  and come back to that area she is gonna be on the ground  and you can put it in her
Bro this man is posting every hour.... BIG W FOR FUSION!
W
I would like five Nights at Freddy's security breach and the DLC
Whatever you want
/e pinv2
Ngl you know it’s a good time when fusion binges an entire dlc in one go
The costume looks like crocodile or alligator.
bro like 7 vids in one day?!?!?!?
the mimic in a suit was actually from the tales from a pizza plex book
Bing bong
Hi
GOOD JOB THOUGH 👍
I love your videos
Mimic's suit looks like a lion 🦁 🤔
Everyone gonna ignore Gregory  4:43
Are there any other endings?
If anyone can answer my next question then I Will be very happy: Where is DJ Music man?
Weren’t the circus and balloon animatronics supposed appear in this dlc?
I like your content
Did you play Monty's golf to try and get the claws?  Maybe theres one fore foxy too....
WOW MAN YOU SPED THROUGH THIS GAME 😂
“Whatever you want” Ez
I like how fleshed out the DLC is
PART 7 ALREADY
I did all the doors but the door wasn’t open
GO TO SLEEP FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
This is the 7th video today
random comment
You need to sleep, seriously man lol Great video as always :)
my only thoughts are.second dlc or part 2 ruin?
yassss
I love his video he is just amazing at entertaining us
“Whatever you want” 😂
Whatever you want
it kinda look to me like a lion mascot?? like is it a mane on his head??
GO TO SLEEP
fusionzgamer part 8 I can't wait fnaf ruin
I love your Fnaf Videos
Hey I would love to play this but I don’t have the game so if i could get the I would love that I play on ps4
Very weird mimic suit
Does this require going through everything as if it's a normal play through or just jumping to each chapter?
IF YOU GO BACK TO CHICA WHERE SHE DEACTIVATED YOU CAN PUT HER VOICE BOX BACK IN FUSION
5:28 glamrock bonnie? We have seen his plushie and cartoon version, it would be cool to See the animatronic
nice
So the scooper is the real bad guy here. The scooper was used to kill Micheal and now The mimic
This game was so much fun
Part 7 thank you fuision for pumping these videos
favorite part of my Day.
In my school, vr game in the junk guild base the suit the mimic wore is seriously important (confirmed via the price at £50.5 billion), and the scooper is in the game and it is used for the shasha boss fight with a insta kill head smash and Goalius took the thing down by using Hammer multinational own new weapon the hindinburg sturm faust and its revealed that Goalius knows who Caseie is and she's a surviver
i really want security breech please
I get his suit because the book the mimic used to mimic his creators sons tiger toy
This DLC is amazing, especially seeing Eclipse in the game ^^ ❤ 🌑
Can’t wait, no seriously I can’t wait My doctor said I’ll have a panic attic I wait longer than an hour 🤷‍♂️
920th!
Alright if the cameras unlock that ending then what is chica's voice box for? What theroies to you think?
I JUST READ THE TITLE AND WHAT WHAT WHAAAATTTTT?!
6:31 right hear me out the help wanted glitchtrap suit is stitched up and more human like and looks older than all the others maybe this is the original Fredbear suit the actual fredbear???
Much appreciation Fusion! Petition to name this lion mascot “Fonzo”
Yessssss I love this series! Also I would like a copy of fnaf sb 😊
Hey Fusion! there's a thing when you put the thing in roxy's eyes. There a thing esc or name exit when you connect the parts. I hope this an ending or its just only me. You can try it if you want!. Its hard to explain.
BRO ITS THE SCOOPER FROM SISTER LOCATION 😮😮😮😮😮😂😂😂
I feel like the first ending is the Canon ending because at the end of the elevator fall Roxy is calling out our name leading to a sequel the good ending is obviously not Canon it feels like a Death screen in the after life and the other ending looks like a prequel which could have something to do with help wanted 2 but can we just take a moment to realize how Roxy has become the new Glamrock Freddy and how Gregory keeps making enemies after what he did to cassie  And one thing do any of you guys think glitchtrap and the mimic are too different entities not the same person
Hi
HI
monty got hit hard not even a crocodile even more😔
*secret ending appears*
I hope I'm not the only one that noticed Helpi sometimes switches from BLUE eyes to ORANGE eyes and has a crack on his head. And eye color   is usually super important in FNaF lore!
BRO OUT HERE FINDING ALL THE ENDINGS
used to have five nights at Freddy security breach but I lost my copy of the game on my old PS4 because I switch to PC and now I I’m not able to play the DLC
This game is honestly one of the best games scott made so everyone ( who can buy it) can play it like the best youtubers for fnaf
30 MINUTES AGO
Matpat is in tears rn trying to figure this stuff out
PLEASE FUSION IVE NEVER WON ANY GIVEAWAYS I RELLLY WANT SECURITY BREACH
The suit the mimic was wearing looked like the freddy form the old posters from the collectables from the base game.
he uploaded right after i finished the last video (perfect timing)
hey fuzion you can give chica her music box when shes sitting in the bathroom go to her and give it to her and see if you unlock a secret i also found out a secret in bonnies place deactivate the clean bot and something happens or should i say meet an old freind
New scene:when chica is sitting in the bathroom or where ever is it you can give her voice box back to her
When Michael Afton got scooped in sister location
Still one more ending in the files to be found
Wow just wow, ruin is definitely better than the base game
this feels like freddys head has been disabeled  and  chickas voicebox has been pulled out and hidden in a machine
cool
I love this game and I love to watch you I watch you all day
Great content keep it up
Im not surprised you found this
We got a good ending yeyyy. Other than the ending where Gregory gets Cassie killed
This is way more amazing than I thought it would be
Can we still win the SB give away ?
Another one???
You can put Chica's beak back into her mouth when she is laying in the bathroom floor
Bro just don't stop 😂😂😂
OK here me out if there is a chica beak in the arcade machine in chica's area then could there be one in monty roxy freddy and Bonnie's area.
Hi😊
Hi Fuzion
Maybe you get Monty’s claws if you beat gator golf and if that’s the case maybe another arcade will give you Roxy’s eye s
I’m glad he showcases us the endings when we don’t have the game
Best DLC
You really speedran this game, you deserve a medal!
Fusion always finds a way to keep you entertained even at 3.00 am
theres also secrets!?
Fusion z gamer gamer can I please get the new copy early copy of ruin I'm such a big fan
I am so excited
You can put chica's Voicebox into chica.
If you know remenant you know the mimic and if you know the mimic you know the books and if you know the books you know the trauma of it
Dear Faz-Lord.... I wasn't Actually Excited for this DLC.  Then I get Wiped off my Feet with how Gosh Dang Amazing This Is!?!?!         I'm Impressed, I'm so Surprised I even Liked This.                Well Done Steel Wool... Well Done.
Please let be one more
This dlc is the best
Oh my God!!!🎉
Wait so what’s the chica beak for???
THE DAMN BEST OF THE BEST FNAF YOUTUBERS
😱😱😱😱😱
i love your videos so much it brings me so much joy especially fnaf videos. thanks for making videos man. love the effort you put into your video's
Remember when you found Chica's voice box,maybe you can give it to her and befriend her maybe?
I thought this ending was fake lmao
a scooper with straight up alien tech matpat now have to consider aliens and teleporting augmented reality mask. fnaf literally turned a paranormal horror into a dark futuristic scfi game
Let’s just appreciate him posting very quickly for all of us to enjoy. It makes me so happy that fusion is having so much fun
This man has so much dedication, it’s admirable.
Guys, if I have a fnaf CD, can I download the DLC?
W
I bet if you beat gator golf you would get Monty's claws. What if there is a Roxy game that gives you her eyes, would all three reveal a secret?
Fusion is a goat for pulling an all nighter for us
Omg I just finished the other vid but I HATE gregory!? He killed his own FrIeNd
nm
Roxy & Eclipse are my favourite 😊
I wonder if you give chica her voicebox back in roxy raceway
a
But who was that?!
I wish the dlc was available on ps4  :(
So you might be able to save Roxy, you can exit out of the deactivate menu. And with Chica's voicebox, can you fix all of the animatronics?
can i have the game pls mr fusion
All the ending are great and im super excited to play it!!
Epic
so i think that sute has roxys face and like a school maskot body
Rip Cassie and roxy😢😢
I love your vids, you are so dedicated to bringing us great content, I hope you eventually get sleep tho.
This man actually deserves an award for all the dedication and effort put into this series ❤
THE LORE IS EXPANDING JUST LIKE A TREE AGAIN
your are the best
mat pat can make more fnaf lore
I think the mimic is ether in a lion costume or a costume of the old time fredbear we see in the posters in the museum area of rockstar road
as I saw the title I was so excited
W H A T
7th time asking for the original security breach please! This is hopefully boosting my chances.😅❤
Say no to the security protocols on the computer before you get chased Also thank you fusionZ I'm really sick right now and seeing this almost completed for every thing found makes me super happy
Aye thanks for making these vids i'd love to play but i dont have a pc so i love these vids!
Ngl I was about to laugh when I was saw the mimics suit but I wish we could’ve see how the mimic got scooped
IT’S PIZZA TIME!
Whatever you want
There is no way your finding all these within this amount of time man
my brain still hurts from the mimic.
I really want fnaf security breach because at launch I never got the game and i really want it
I am so confused now, which do you guys think was the real ending? Like is it the elevator fall or the hiding spot ending????
By the way fusion, Idk if you know or not, but you give chicas beak to chica when she sits down in the bathroom.
CONGRATS ON 3.9 MILLION FUSION!
Do I really have to wait another hour😢
I hope we see more lore on the scooping room. I hope maybe theres some prototype glamrock baby or severly withered scrab baby that could be found in any potential sequels or updates to this game. Leave any thoughts in the replies to this comment :)
Honestly since this is an ending you can miss like the burn trap ending I think this is the real ending
can you do re do the game to make it fully with cinematics??
This dlc is scary then any game I have played
I have not and will not sleep till all of these videos are uploaded.
ive been watching your playthrough all day waiting for the next vid every hour lol
What would happen if you cancelled the faz-wrench when you talk to roxy?
Dude I just realized that that was all the animatronics parts on the mimic you can kinda see roxys lower jaw and Monty’s mowhak and I think sun? that’s all I can find though
What about the jumpscare
maybe you will discover other endings sadly i cant i dont have game and im a coward so i can only watch not play
I love your vids so much I want to get the game.
I like this ending the best the main one just felt so forced like there was no buildup it just happened
ITS AWSOME
The mans put on his birthday suit before chasing Cassie 💀💀💀
Bruh i was thinking that EXACT thing with the cameras on like part 2 I didn't know that was actually gonna be a thing
Jerma985 is not real
woah this one wasnt even shown in kreek's stream, i gotta say he missed it lol
OMG
I dont own a pc, Xbox, or Playstation... and I don't use steam. But I do have a Nintendo switch
And I really really like your YouTube videos and I like to comment and subscribe and notification on
I like the fact that they managed to incorporate the previous games and make it all make sense. I hope steel wool keep up the good work
Wow to say he’s done all this is one day is very impressive
What about the Glamrock parts?
matpat is crying right now
What if the next game is also a dlc for sb  but when you first open the game it gives you a menu with the words chose a ending to continue from. That would be crazy
There must be one more ending
This is so cool
If you put chicks voice box into chica in when in roxy raceway she just sits in the toilet you can repair her,looks like we need to repair everyone as I found montys legs in montys golf in order to unlock a secret ending
Matpat is going to work overhour
PL;S ME MNEED  GAEM
Me and my sister love watching your videos. Thank you!
Hi
Curious about what else there is to find.
Hey people🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Part 7 and its the first day and why didn't you do it in one video
3:08 that ghost chasing you when you put on the mask is probably william it's just my theory
the scooping room????????????
appreciate your dedication fusionz!
HI FUSION! If I win can I get a copy of it for nintendo switch?
Dont know why im still up maybe im just hyped for the new dlc plus i cant wait for matpat to make his classics claims
Now THAT is a scary costume
What happens if you deactivate all the robot slip sign things
Hello fuzion 25mins ago
FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING DOR THIS FOE 2 HOURSSS
Eeeeeeee new video!!
ligma balls
If I see a new video in the next hour, Im telling you to go to sleep
I like your videos

So many episodes at such a rapid time
I need this but my pc which does have sb I don’t have the power cord for it and I don’t have it one my ps4 but I’ll have to wait a long time but I’m excited
ples i  needd game
OMG
one day all the dlc.. wow.
O
what ever you want
give chika her beack and go to the last chap
hi
IM SO EXCITED
Hi
how much you wanna bet he found bonnie in this game XD  "blown away"  if you dont get all the comic pages i will be sad bc i wanna see the story and how it ties to the game edit: i wander if you beat all the arcades will you be able to fix and help the animatronics or will you use the parts to get to different ares
Did you know when chica is sitting under the freddy poster in the bathroom you can put her voice box in her
i love the dedication this man is putting into giving us a whole playthrough and showcasing the secrets of a DLC released the same day he uploads them, amazing work fusion!
How the fu-
FNAF SECURITY BREACH PS4
Did you forget it’s the M.X.E.S not glitchtrap not glamrock bonnie it’s the M.X.E.S
You are doing so many videos ! tysm
speed run lol
No way a other one fuzion at the time he was recording then editing I got to say after this take a break
AAAAAAA I THOUGHT THERE WAS TWO ENDINGS BUT I QAS WRONG
The community effort to find all of these secrets so fast is always astounding to me, let's uncover all of them!
Hi I just want to say hi fusion I hope you keep doing everything that you can to make these videos and I will keep giving love 💕💕 P.S. I really want a copy I never got anything
Awsom
Can we take a moment to appreciate these animations these are amazingly beautiful and smooth! 😁😁😁
MY GUY CALM DOWN I JUST WOKE UP
Cool
Wow just like sister location
👍
I love that they did multiple endings with the DLC to
The thing I've been wondering while watching fusion's videos is about Cassie's father, he seemed to be mention a lot as said in the game, makes me wonder if he's one of the workers of pizzaplex that had a connection with bonnie at some point, like the bonnie lunch box mentioned and the wrench that has been used by Cassie at the start of the game. Also, Cassie had spend time here(like Roxy said about her special day, which is most likely her birthday), especially if Roxy recognized her and go as far as protecting her.
W
looks like chipper and sons typa suit
I stayed up too
Im so happpyyyyy
Hi! my name is Lea. And I would REALLYYYYYYYYYYY love it if I can get a copy of Fnaf sb.
O
Looks a lot like lion tbh
Who else is ready to see Matpat go beserk trying to find out how to tie this into the lore lmao
Can you try all the arcade cabinets or find all of them
When will you upload about chickas voice box
They definitely redeemed themselves with the DLC! ❤
Thanks for making cool Videos
Who loves it when FuzionZGamer uploads?
dude im actually freaking out at the new lore drop secrets Fusion keeps providing us
I think you should replay the last part with all the cameras done already instead of skipping tot he last chase
Im sure this is not the end. What the animatronic parts are used for? I don't know. BUT im sure you can find Roxy's eyes and Montys Claws somewhere. Because when Roxy catches you she says "Give me back my eyes!". This must be hinting for something.
here here here
I have been waiting for this dlc I can't wait to try it myself for a future video
That looks like a lion more than a tiger :))
When Chica sits in the bathroom and deactivate you can repair her voice box
HOW ARE YOU UPLOADING THIS FAST
I’m so excited to see what’s coming in the next video I sounder if it’s going to be today I hope so
SCOOP
This man 100% completed the dlc in basically one sitting, give this man a trophy
it’s been like 6ish hours how is he already at this ending
this is cool 👍
The suit is looking like shattered fredbear to me like glitchtrap costume but fredbear you know
That new ending is so cool
Isn’t that one of the endings were Gregory takes Freddy’s head with him maybe that’s why he’s trying to kill us. He doesn’t have control of his body so that is Freddie but his body.
Nice
Hi thanks for all the Videos you put good work in them if you didn’t sleep at all
Hey in the day care you cane put the wrench in the day care attended as I saw two lights should be on so if you can try I'll be thankful 😊😊😊
Hey Fusion I've been a fan for years and I wanted to tell you that  Nicholas cage is in dead by daylight
You need sleep
Is that tiger rock?!
damn, soo many secrets :o
OMag
Very cool, fusion! I really wonder if anything changes in the actual storyline if you play through the whole game instead of loading from chapters. Would be interesting to see a complete run for this ending  😁😁😁😁
Hi
e
Ily Fusion, been watching you for years. Thanks for losing sleep for us to see the dlc😅
pie
Bro stayed up all night
That guy looks like Billy Bob!
I spent an entire 2 hr watching every single ruin vid u had posted so far and I'm super confused XD
OMG
Find Roxy’s eyes
I love SB fnaf ruin
He has still yet to find glam rock bonnie in bonnie bowl hehe
Pizza time
FUSION U ABSOLUTE LEGEND MATE, ITS BEEN LIKE 6 HRS DUDE Edit: nah...it's been 12 dude..
❤
I couldn't wait more for this I LOVE THESE TYPE OF VIDEOS❤❤
MatPat is going to have an absolute field day with this for sure
LETS GO ANOTHER EPIC VIDEO
FINALLY ANOTHER VIDEO!!!
I wish I could play it but I need the normal security breach and can't buy it
liked subbed and this is a comment
Good video
@FuzionZgamer what if you could give chica her voice box
gvwy
We should really apreciate how much work this man puts in all his videos and  how much he does for us.
i think
You are a madman running the whole dlc in a few hours
Can i get sb
I really want security breach I've been watching him for a long time I play on ps4
what about the chica voicebox can you do something with that in the next video?
Cool 😎 and you have to give this man props for his determination on this game
FINALLY
Im trying to pass an entance exam right now if i xould get thsi game it wiuld be a great reward
He never used chica's beak- another ending??
you can repair chica while she is powered down in the bathroom
i dont get this dlc at all LMAOO
Love how fast he's coming out with these lol
Can I have it
Its annoying its no on xbox yet if anyone knows the release date can you let me know but i think the release date for xbox is unknown
this dlc has been so cool, really love the glitch mechanics of the game
The mimic turned into a lion?
I'm a fnaf fan and for years and I've never had the money to buy a fnaf game please I want this🥺
I would want a vr headset with help wanted please
Damb dark
That’s so cool! Love your videos!
This game is really a massive improvement from the original game
LET HIM SLEEP
Is that a lion suit? Hmm "interesting loreeeee" - a line from Fusion (i think)
ALL I WANT IS THE GAME MATE 😡 also i want the breach plsssssssssssssssss i WANT it also i love how roxy remembers cassie
i can't wait to hear matpats "totally true" story line
matpat good lack
A
22K Views in 20 MINUTES?
Wait, if cassie deactivated roxy, how did she saved her?? Who activated her? Gregory couldn't bcuz at the end he killed her.. or maybe glitch trap activated roxy to save her  and he's cassie's father??? BUT HOW CASSIE AND GREGORY KNOW EACHOTHER?!
fusion you should try to play the monty golf minigame and see it drops the monty claws at the end
Bro not even 8 hours into the game and you've already beaten it
Bro go to bed
and he's already mastered this game
Maybe we can repair them.
I'm pretty sure that you can actually go back to candy cadet and the coins will respown and he actually finish his story
Crazy how you stay up to finish every ending so that your viewers are entertained. Keep it up!
Wait…remember when u have to deactivate Roxy what if u don’t I wonder what happeneds 🤔🤔
Love these and I stayed up all night watching them
I love fnaf
Hi
MAN SLEEP PLS
Your uploading like crazy today
Ir a real one for uploading these things non stop
It happened so fast that ending
This is an amazing game!
I hope in a future dlc we see Bonnie, hes my boy and I miss him :(
Hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi I love your vids idk why I said hi a lot
i say the normal ending when cassie dies is canon,because the left ending is too vage and its most likley just anouther comic book panel from gregory,and the suit/scooped ending is too much of a secret/to hard to find for it to be canon
Hey love the videos
Is there anyway to see that costume in that final cut scene when he is fighting Roxy?
love the amazing content
I’m a BIG fan of fanf and I’m trying to stream ruins
Bagel
amazing video
i think i know what you are searching for and i can not wait to findout where it is in the game
fnaf
That looks like a lion
Crazy
"whatever i want"
Bro keeps uploading every min😂😂😂😂
fusion popping off with ruin secrets lol
can I have a vr with fnaf help wanted
Your too fast let me finish other pepole playthroghs man  Jokes aside keep it up 💯
Another part. Let's goooooo.
Love your vids, they really help me through hard times, so thanks, and keep up the great work!
THERES MORE ARCADE MACHINES WITH UPGRADES. YOU CAN REPAIR CHICA WHEN SHE SITS DOWN IN ONE OF THE CHAPTERS.   FIND ALL OF THE YELLOW SIGN BOTS!!!
Fusion I salute you because you spend all night playing this game for you can give us content
Bros be like: What's Sleep?
Doing the lords works bud!! Mattpat is losing his mind right now 😂
6:29 That room has the light on.
Do gator golf to get Monty claws!
For some reason i like and I forget i done it and then i try to like but see I already done it
so many videos
Liked and subscribed. Fusion keep up the good work!
Well, that looks like a fanmade animatronic, but in any case, IF that is a scooper, then we may end up in the sister location bunker. And in that case.. maybe help wanted 2 will not be another in universe vr game
Give me security breach plss 😢😢😢
Gotta tell you something they little Freddy helper sometimes it’s eyes turned into the mimics so the mimics could have something to do with the aft on cult.
More lore yeaaaa love the vids to
Is there a good ending when she finds Gregory?
Are you gonna upload more or can I sleep
Go to sleep😢😢
I saw that some Russian people found the ending using hacks lmao
thats weird
HWO IS MIMIC PLEASE TELL ME WHO IS MIMICC
YES YES YES I BINGED WATCHED EVERYTHING LETS GO
Bro you are the GOAT when it comes to uploading videos and looking for secrets
Could a mimic be a illusion disc?
interesting
Guys maybe you can use the chicka voice system when she's deacitivated before living the room, it may show something
yoylecake
Nice Fnaf ending
I played the dlc and in some placed the mask would spawn me outside above the map
Love this series keep it up!!
what about Chica's Beak
I found two doors one in Monty golf and Bowling Bonnie where do I find the other doors
Love fnaf man boss videos keep it up
Is it just me or that the endo skeleton of the 'mimic' looks like circus baby? I mean the cheeks, the faint red. It just screams circus baby to me. I'm sure MatPat and Fuhnaff are going to go wild.
You are a real trooper, You finish the DLC in one night and already got a secret ending!  Everyone we need to give this guy time to breathe and give him applause 👏
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
yo you mean the chill out your speed running this
What a great discovery!!! Bless you for doing over 24 hours!!! Thank you!!!
i realy like the fact that Fuzion will not stop until hes 100 present sure he found everything in the dlc
Fusion=GOAT🐐
Foxy for life 🦊🏴‍☠️
Sounds like a stretch but maybe if you find and play all arcade machines themed around the characters you can get their upgrades back like you did with chica feeding frenzy and put them back together? If there are any more playable arcade machines, that is.
Yes
FINALLY.. YES..!
16 mins huh cool :) also I missed this channel
Am i the only one who think's this ending is the best one?
My issue is that there’s a serious “okay now what” quality to this ending. DOES Cassie meet up with Gregory afterwards? I wish more questions were answered. Thanks as always for kicking ass!! It’s impressive how quickly you finish these.
I like your videos
Love you vids keep up the good work
So where do the beak / spare items and deactivation of the robots come into play? It’s not a coincidence to be able to obtain or be able to do these…
Bro said screw it I’m a put my suit from 1219 on
Hi
Staying up for 24 hours?Now he's trying too hard :(
bro I said he gonna upload again at any second last video WHAT IS THIS GET SOME GOSH DARN SLEEP!
:0

This is so fun I'm so happy that the fnaf SB hype is back
Next game theory:ı think game was going that ending
Cool🎉
When there is a new Fnaf game just give him 10 hours and he is already done
lets goooo!!!
I hope there's a ending for the talk box and you should try to put the talk box in Roxy or any of the animatronics
Fusion, if you really read this, it's awsome that you're uploading several bids so we don't have to wait! What a legend. ❤️
Fusion do you know why I can't get dlc (I play on ps4)
THE ENDING IS SO COOL
7:18 timestamp for the scooping room (the costume is less scary.)
It hasnt been 24 hours and hes doing everything youre a legend
Suuiiiiiii
I'm needing an Xbox copy my guy
Eeek

I really like how enthusiastic you are!

fnaf
Love your videos it's just great keep it up
Still curious if you could repair them.
I'm waiting more for fnaf HW 2
Very cool, fusion! I really wonder if anything changes in the actual storyline if you play through the whole game instead of loading from chapters. Would be interesting to see a complete run for this ending
Respect for you fusion didn’t sleep at all

bro seriously went out his way to finish the game, find all the secrets and easter eggs in ONE DAY  you are truly amazing fusion🔥
THAT ENDING WAS CRAZY I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT HAPPENED
Bro, my dumb self thought that "the mimic" was afton 💀
Try to skip it when you fall In the elevator
14 MINUTES??? GOSH IM EARLY
Dude you ok you been posting non stop
Steel Wool really outdone themselfs
Thank you for doing this for us but even if you like staying up late and playing you still have to take care of yourself
You have to read the book to know that suit
I was watching the last episode when this came iut
Egg
you can give chica her beak
I still think there will be a roxy arcade machine and when u beat it u get her eyes and when she says give me back my eyes and then says I'm sorry at the point u giver her the eyes
Man i have been watching all of these starting from the 1st one im tired
Yessss more!!! THank you Fusion!!
The suit looks like Gregory

I lied don’t stop making these sleep is for the weak
Hi
Let’s go more Fnaf sb ruin
yo fuse nice cameo in the fnaf movie
Is there maybe an ending for where you don’t put the device into Roxy’s eye?
what would happen if you complete all the arcades? You did Chica's arcade but what about the other arcades, would you get a new ending?
Omg ur so freaking fast
i jsut wante to say im a huge fan and i love your fnaf videos
Hey fusion did you know that you can give chicas voice box back in roxys raceway  and btw you have to give the voice box when chicas deactiveded in the bathroom
This felt like a speedrun watching all the vids
You still gotta get the candy cadet full story!!
Hi fusion

My god you guys are so dedicated
Fazbear ent is wasting their time on attractions. when they just made teleportation and literally phasing through walls then again, we don't know how far in the future we are so?
he really do be pumping these videos out

You and someone should have a competition to see who can get all the endings first
freddy
BRO RLLY BEAT THIS IS ONE DAY
You are amazing for finishing this game so quickly, and I’ve enjoyed watching these videos! You’re the greatest Fusion ❤
BEST GAMER
I give my respect for Roxy for saving cassie R.I.P roxy
I wonder when we will see the good ending
Do you mean the right now video ?
So many secrets in this dlc, it will be fun to teorize what they mean to the main storyline.
Bro tbh i was wating for the new ep! :)
here we go agaiyn
It isn't already 24 hours from the ruin release and every minute there's new secrets found 😵‍💫
10:18 I don’t plan on the game, so can you just it under the name fnaf ruin spoiler
I watched all the video there all exciting i had fun
Another one! DAMN
7 6 hours
this game is incredible
So was the rabbit in the vanni system that “Gregory” said to stay away from actually trying to help us sorta of
Fusion you never competed fnaf the nightmare begins you know the Mario x fnaf game
Dude u need to stop posting ever hour
Cheeseburger 🍔
Hope he posts in 30 minutes again 😀
🧄
The suit kinda looks like glitchtrap imo I’m assuming the mimic’s suit is one of those sound distortion discs that twisted animatronics have
I am kinda sad because it is not night time where i live just because it would be more enjoyable for me watching this series in the dark.
Can I get a vr headset
Tiger
Honestly impressive how fast you've done this👍
OH! THATS what it was! I was so lost
How
When Fuzion says he is going to find every secret in the game so we all can be surprised to find out the lore. Then I am glad he truly wants us to feel entertained while also figuring out the lore.
=) Hi
Anyone still sad that Rocky sacrificed her self to save her from mimic
hello
e
i love the "glitchtrap" design he looks so dang cool
We need to see if we can use chicas voice box and beak
🫡🔥👍🏻

hi
Hey Fusion I always love your videos dude I've been watching since 2018 and you are still one of my favorite YouTubers you're who I always go to when I A new fnaf game comes out and I always loved watching you play them and I've been wanting to play security breach for a while the YouTuber I went to when it first came out
I was looking at your other fnaf sb ruin videos and this came up like 9 minutes later
bro already has 300+ comments in 9 minuts like dan
i would like to play sb ruin cuz it looks so cool i wish gl on everyone winning it
chicken sandwich
been a sub for years thank you mate
fusion i was looking at videos of the ending then i found yours i was waiting for u to make smth
Early squad. where you at !!??
One this is missing from ruin is glamrock freddy because a freddy game without the apperance of freddy that doesnt make sense unless its an ending
i love ruin pls just pls
Ay everyone can we get a (THANK YOU SCOTT)  message of the day: dont be sad it ended be happy it happened
This DLC is a lot better than I thought it would be, and the ending shocked me
The Mimic is scaring me more. XD
Is the mimic a new animatronic?
I love this game its amazing and also fuzion thank you for the commitment and the great content
scary
Hello, did you had a nap?
Bro, just posted this nine minutes ago
As i said before his channel is amazing when there is nothing on and you can waddle to his page and be blown away or reeled in by his amazing content. Sorry its so long with my bad grammar. 😅
there is still the parts like he got a chica voice box from the arcade so we will see another ending related to it
Thank you Fusion for uploading this fast
keep it up!
give me pls pls pls
my g has no break
How about the chicas voicebox?
Yay 9 videos
Bruh i thought u werent going to upload 😭😭 ty FUSION
1k in 8 minute DAMN🔥
Bro that costume as to be fredbear like theres stiches and like also glitchtrap as the same thing maybe that is the original design for fredbear like it looks kinda like a bear but brown
Can we all please give Fusion some love today for the (as of now) 7 videos in a row since 2am (for me at least) and continuing to pump them out
What is that ending this was so different i forgot that we were playing fnaf for a moment
Her beak beak!!!
Just as i thought it was done, you found the beak, you never catch a break, do you?
Can I get a copy?? I did everything I'm already subscribed
pls go to bed I don't wants you to be to tired
Your insane fusion we respect you so much
Great, maybe there could be more secret endings!
Ur awesome
The animatronics at the start of security breach are so shiny  and cool,Now they are more broken than the withered ones from fnaf 2!😢
Imagine a 1 minute Speedrun
Finally someone is showing how to do this ending.
Just finished all of the other parts, and this one popped up :D
It looks like a lion idk
Oh hi oh
Thought I say this, but I was watching backseat streams and he found Bonnie in the back of the arcade in a vent which leads to a room when he got out of bounds by accident thought it could lead to a new ending :) love your content fusion keep up the good work
I love the DLC, man     EDIT: MY GOD 13 HOURS?!
Bing watched this whole series! Thank you for all the contact Fusion! Just don't tire yourself out!
MORE
Seems like everyone forgot about the level 10 security pass in the regular game?
You can give chica her voice back!!!!
big boi and biggest boi
I'm glad there's so much to this game
I literally just finished commenting on every video now there’s a new one

Fr
Love your'e videos Big fans
I knew it he found it
I don’t think I’ve seen ruined glamrock Freddy yet :/
Bro more ending
I just binged this all day long. You are amazing.
early
For a while when I saw this pop up in a 30 second video I thought it was fake, because the costume looks like a “Little Nightmares” styled character. But now apparently it’s a real thing in the Ruin DLC? MatPat definitely gonna have a five-stadiums wide field day with this game, that’s for sure.
the best speed run ever, nice job mate. love you vids and i hope you feel ok in the morning!😂😊
OMG I'M ONE OF THE FIRST ONES IN MY FAVORITE YOUTUBE  CONTENT CREATOR

8:27 it might be hinting at the fredbear diner game that's gonna be the next fnaf game after help wanted 2 . Maybe is a new mascot suit from said game's location?

If I was Cassie I would goodbye to Gregory
This is a random comment
My theory is that animatronic is the the mimic from the tiger rock book that dressed up as a tiger
I can't believe I'm actually in love with this game I thought I would never like security breach
Already another ending youre the goat gotta respect the work W fusion!!!
Ok I am so confused about this ending

That "New Animatronic" is actually still the Mimic just in a Costume that seems to refer to one of the costumes he wears in the books since its stated Mimic loves to wears Costumes(not surprising noticing hid Jumpscare makes reference on how it kills people)
So many vids

"Ha, that Robot got Michael'd!"  ~ darklink8423 ~
