Great intro woa .... ! Great artist
Unfortunately my bloke is effected directly by lyrical content as he lives it so if I wrote sum with that in I get effected too imagine the generation of young men that are supposed to have morality and respect the one woman and a family it ain’t going to happen with this lifestyle .... just a thought 💭
Why perpetuate the playa mentality tho I feel partly to blame telling it like it is for them .....?

When you die the real you( the spirit inside your body) either goes to Heaven or hell. Going to either path depends on if you accepted or you rejected J-sus Christ as the savior.  Heaven is a very good place with no sins, sorrows, crying, lust, greed; in other words there is no sin there and it’s full of joy.  Hell is very terrible and it’s very very hot, you can’t survive placing your hand on a hot stove for 10 seconds, don’t even think you will withstand burning there without being consumed, The thing here is you will be burned without being consumed in hell the same same way you boil a hard rock in water you will be there for eternity, Again after judgement you will be thrown in lake of fire forever. Matthew 13:50 (UKJV) “And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”   So how to get salvation and be on your way to heaven?  First thing first; Believing at J-sus Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at J-sus Christ as the perfect sacrifice for your sins. It's your choice but know that rejecting Christ will send you the wrong direction.  No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what J-sus Christ did for you as simple as that.  Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Believe and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now, that way you will receive salvation and be on your way to heaven during rapture or after death.  After believing at J-sus Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.  Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag.
Nines if you’re reading the comments please do a second verse and cut some of the verses from NSG on the final album. Please boss.

Wag1 ladies and gentlemen
Wrong song credits. This was NSG and North, West, South, East London featuring Nines.
Nsg givin me a likkle belly squad vibe 👀🤷🏽‍♂️
woooo
Swear skrapz was in the video or am I seein shot
Everyone says Nines will be gone for another 4 years! But..... he dropped 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018 & 2020. When the raps are real you have to take time out and live it. Nines understands the essence of hip hop. Hes a rappers rapper. NW10 back at it and I'm proud. Good luck brother. I dont want to jump the gun but you have been the king of London for the last 5+ summers. Drop out the roads and do music. Read the comments the scene needs you. Large up Skrapz too.
Hit and run in broad daylight caught on camera!! Driver tries to hit victim twice https://youtu.be/MSaAGjsgzV4
343 people who disliked hate it when they ring people and their phones in airplane mode

You can’t hate on nines
https://youtu.be/mLP04dExCCM 🔥🔥lit
Corona is real in this one still
Nines should've had a verse afta every chorus,  Nsg chorus is hard but the verse is super deaddddddd like no wonder you didn't see nines mingle wid dem
Nines always setting levels so no doubt he is doing this on a plane ✈️ sky’s the limit  🌌
✨✨✨
Beats crazy
Lmao I dying at the intro still
Only nines could make a song about a feature ona phone and make it sound proper.
Watch the America’s adopt my guy Nines’ flow because they live off theft of originality

This tune is very weak. Chunkz deserves better after that intro. Don't forget he's way bigger than u on youtube.
Tune star keep up the blessed work peepz vibes dem 🎵🎵🎶🕺🏾🤾🏾‍♀️
Facts or facts?...It don't even matter if Nines disappears for 9 years after the release of his new album because he just produces quality and that includes the visuals.
