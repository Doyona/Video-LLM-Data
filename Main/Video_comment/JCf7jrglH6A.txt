POLO 🔥🔥
Life's getting a little bit too heavy. Life's only getting harder as I grow older. I realize that no one really cares about me that much to fix my life for me. I have no one to rely on except for myself and God. My responsibilities are piling up, and I'm too much of a p*ssy to face them head on. I've just been distracting myself from them. My struggles aren't even that bad when compared to other people's. Guess I'm just weak in the inside. I've been thinking about overdosing for so long now. Listening to this made me burst down in tears
THIS SONG ALWAYS GETS TO ME
A collabo with dax 😢

Everyone everyone needs to come closer to god. No matter who it is. And learn to love. You never know what someone is going through. Jesus said we are his salt, and what good is salt when it lost its flavor?

This is one of your best songs. Thank you for acknowledging that all white people aren’t racist. They’ve done such a good job at dividing us all, and that was the whole point to begin with. They know how powerful we are when we all work together, that’s why they want us to hate each other. That’s all it is. We all bleed the same color.   I grew up in a very poor part of Tennessee and my dad was always in and out of prison. The area is relatively small, and it was much smaller at the time. My dad is pretty infamous around here. The cops would terrorize me and my brothers for no reason at all. We would run because we were scared of them, which only makes it that much worse. They planted drugs on both of my brothers, separate times. And sadly enough, our own dad pressured pretty much every one of us to take the fall for him on different occasions. Looking back, it’s so fucked up. I say this all to say that if all of us would’ve been black,  we probably wouldn’t have made it out of that town alive. I’m sorry that things are that way. It’s not fair at all. They know exactly what they do by pumping drugs into hoods and gentrifying and all the other terrible things that they do to make sure that certain people never get ahead. But just know this. People never feel the need to stifle you unless they think you are a threat. That means you’re special.   I’ve seen lately where Trump is wanting to make it to where cops don’t have to wear body cams again. That is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard, and I don’t see how that can be coming from an honest place. It doesn’t even make sense. It doesn’t take a genius to know that cops are fucking crooked if they stay in the force long enough. I’ve met a few really decent cops, but most of them were not. They had no business putting on that badge every day. If this really happens, people need to stand up and fight again. This affects everybody. Just look at how many cases we’ve had in recent years where cops have knowingly falsified evidence. That affects everyone. And look at how many mothers have had to bury their children.  We can’t let this shit happen.
My first time crying because of a song, this song touches my heart

Just came across this song today and I’ve listened to it more times than I can count. At 29 years old, after 6 brain surgeries for brain tumors starting at 13, and having seizures, this song is relatable and makes me feel better.

I was looking for the “barely girl” you know the legally blind,  innocent bystander, who allegedly drove the getaway car.  Later denied it bc she cannot see, when questioned if she could see at all…”BARELY!”

To come from where he’s come from and to make it to where he has in the rap game and to be able to go out there and touch these kids lives the way he does is truly amazing man. It only takes one person to change your life.

Barely holdin' on This life get scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone Starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tell me, but I'm strong That's what you wanted to tell me all along Ain't hard to figure him out 'cause all his thoughts was tweeted We blew some shots and shot him up, that's why his top was leakin' 'Cause I ain't never seen a nigga from his coffin speakin' We picked that nigga off, he ain't think that we saw him creepin' Sometimes I miss them days when me and bro was off it, tweakin' I hate September 18th, that's when we lost a demon Why the real ones always leave? That's what I get exhausted thinkin' Can't be ungrateful 'bout this life, you know we fought to see it I'd rather you hate me while I'm here than love me when I'm dead They sent that text that Twinnem check, can't stomach what I read Like life been pushin' me too far and I'm stuck on their ass Don't wanna party, I stay in this lonely room instead And I'm just Barely holdin' on This life get scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone Starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tell me, but I'm strong That's what you wanted to tell me all along Death in the air, that shit'll leave you with a chilled spine Even though my spirits down, like, I'm okay, I feel fine Shots from that steel nine, ain't from that hillside I'm from the trenches where they murder just to kill time A heavy heart, eyes rollin', through dark times, soulless Sorry that they took your son, I'm sendin' my condolence Gotta face the facts when the truth unfoldin' I hope you know this That I'm just Barely holdin' on This life get scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone Starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tell me, but I'm strong That's what you wanted to tell me all along Ooh, there's a power in your soul Ooh, and I wanted you to know

I am in love with song.
Bro its only been a year and it already brings back memories to my old life😢
I’m Jacob. I’ve battled with fitting in and rejection my whole life. I only felt more isolated losing both parents in my twenties. I know some have it worse than me but I’m also barely holding on
man this world is in such a bad time. all the stuff these people come tell me would make u blow ur own head off. why do they have to take peoples ssi checks put women to sleep so their plug can get it for drugs. having babies no one knows about so patels can sell them. and I'm just about alone against this shit I've been shot 2 times they have poisoned my mom u name it

Apenas aguantar esta vida se vuelve aterradora a medida que avanza con cargas a medida que continuamos. No soy perfecto, perdóname si me equivoco. Espero que mis secretos estén aterrorizados cuando ya no mire los escritos en estas lápidas que siguen intentando. destrozame pero soy fuerte eso es lo que quisiste decirme todo el tiempo no es difícil de entender porque todos sus pensamientos fueron tuiteados disparamos algunos tiros para callarlo es por eso que su blusa estaba goteando porque Nunca he visto a un negro hablar desde su ataúd. Le disparamos a ese hombre negro. Él cree que no lo vemos gateando. A veces extraño los días en que mi hermano y yo nos divertíamos. Odio el 18 de septiembre porque fue entonces cuando perdimos a un demonio. ¿Por qué? ¿Los verdaderos siempre se van? Eso es lo que no se me ocurre, no puedes ser desagradecido con esta vida, ya sabes, luchamos por verla, prefiero que me odies mientras estoy aquí que me ames cuando esté muerto, ellos Envié este mensaje de texto a twingnem, lo verifiqué, no pude soportar lo que leí así. Si la vida me hubiera alejado ahora estoy atrapado en el límite No quiero ir a fiestas Me quedaré en esta habitación solitaria y solo...
6 hours before 2025, here's to 2025 being full of songs like this 😁🌀☯️🧬🎄 btw why is there a star on Christmas trees anyway?? Because of GRBs, a Christmas tree is the shape of a Gamma Ray Burst. Evidence: the first chapter of the Bible talks about wave mechanics and photons explicitly. "How it was used".
2024 X 2025 ✓
Ppl from 2025😅
For some its time to pay the piper  Why your soul  Well if the soul of every man is in the blood  And we ate manna what did you really sign  Think about it  The corn 🌽 of heaven  Read enoch  Enoch7:2 they ate man  Why before the flood  Just like the days of enoch  What will happen now  Leviticus 17:11 Where is blood produced in the bone marrow  Read  Hebrews 4:12 Read all translation
Hard bars🔥🔥🔥
This is underrated its fire
Awesome song and amazing video.

2024 September Anyone?
POLO G, you’re bumping through my speakers about 97 and 98% of the time! Keep it coming! People like me need to hear it! You can never judge a book by its cover, don’t forget it people. Nothing but love keep it coming, like I said! I can totally relate to you and it is insane! Jelly Roll, I have to say, Polo G is definitely consuming more of my time at the moment! Love y’all!💯🫶🏼
Love Polo
🔥🔥
STAY STRONG POLO  ..........

That's what I get exhausted thinkin' Can't be ungrateful 'bout this life, you know we fought to see it I'd rather you hate me while I'm here than love me when I'm dead They sent that text that Twinnem check, can't stomach what I read Like life been pushin' me too far and I'm stuck on their ass Don't wanna party, I stay in this lonely room instead And I'm just Barely holdin' on This life get scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone Starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tell me, but I'm strong That's what you wanted to tell me all along Death in the air, that shit'll leave you with a chilled spine Even though my spirits down, like, I'm okay, I feel fine Shots from that steel nine, ain't from that hillside I'm from the trenches where they murder just to kill time A heavy heart, eyes rollin', through dark times, soulless Sorry that they took your son, I'm sendin' my condolence Gotta face the facts when the truth unfoldin' I hope you know this That I'm just Barely holdin' on This life get scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone Starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tell me, but I'm strong That's what you wanted to tell me all along Ooh, there's a power in your soul Ooh, and I wanted you to know

THIS SONG EVEN BETTER NOW THAT HOOD POET IS OUT! 💜💎
Polo G was my cousins favorite artist, he passed not long ago and I haven't been able to get this song off of repeat since. It hits way too close to home not to tear up with each listen.
Speechless as I pick my jaw off the floor, but gonna need help finding eyeballs that bugged out, soneone need to warn an over sensitive excessively emotional, old-ass white boy, dammir gonna listen again while heart still in my chest, gonna check soon as ny eyes found and screwed back into their sockets, gahhht daayam, g...
I like Polo G with the melodies❤
That hit me deep
🐐

Bro can we get one worship song 😢😢because de voice is too much 🎉
❤♾️❤️
Dey keep tryna tell me bt I’m strong dhats waa she wanted to tell me all along🗣️💪🏾
Wow Ive never watched the video, the ending got me. 😭😭😭😭
I feel like polo could be the best in the game but when your #1 in the rap game you always die young so what I’m saying is he don’t go his best cause he know what it comes with
Fucking goat
❤for Kenya and the rest of the world
❤♾️❤️
this shit hit
I heard of this guy but never knew wen I heard his music exactly but I see a lot of people commenting saying he’s a Goat well he’s good idk about goat status buti can’t take away from him being pretty good and having heartfelt music that’s what caught my attention was the real in him when I seen the people at the end of the song sharing their struggles it made me understand a little more why people are saying goat and putting him up on a pedestal. Now like I said he’s good I have to hear more of his music to say anything close to goat. U people gotta remember us older people that grew up as hip hop grew up and developed and the many categories that we have now of hip hop that we need to make known of who is in what categories. So if it went from just a few genres of hip hop to a whole new spectrum of it. The greats or G.O.A.T.’s of this music that came before when looked at clearly you will see 🐐 STATUS IS HARD TO TOUCH. So I put him as of right now off of one song as he’s pretty good no wonder he got famous off of his music. But 🐐 status is still needed to be heard and seen so I’ll get hip or die trying
All those that suffered in this music video God bless you
Absolute banger
it goes hard
I knew there would be a time I would click on this video
🔥🔥🔥
This shiiii on repeat fr 💯💯

He needed to drop this masterpiece during the COVID 19 pandemic. Man, we were just holding on, we lost jobs, lost people who were so dear to us, we lost relationships but looks at us we're still out here hanging on🙏😭
(o cou dancin ,)
I hate to sound, I guess weak, but, real love, is a tough thing to deal with, it consumes, changes everyone, not always a good thing. For me, it's hard to let it go, even after all these years, the love, still hits hard

I was barely holding onnnnn they didn't tell me in life I had to be stronggggg never told me I would struggleeeee
Huh, uh, uh, uh (808 Mafia) Huh, huh, uh, uh Huh, huh, uh, uh Barely holdin' on This life get scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone Starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tell me, but I'm strong That's what you wanted to tell me all along Ain't hard to figure him out 'cause all his thoughts was tweeted We blew some shots and shot him up, that's why his top was leakin' 'Cause I ain't never seen a nigga from his coffin speakin' We picked that nigga off, he ain't think that we saw him creepin' Sometimes I miss them days when me and bro was off it, tweakin' I hate September 18th, that's when we lost a demon Why the real ones always leave? That's what I get exhausted thinkin' Can't be ungrateful 'bout this life, you know we fought to see it I'd rather you hate me while I'm here than love me when I'm dead They sent that text that Twinnem check, can't stomach what I read Like life been pushin' me too far and I'm stuck on their ass Don't wanna party, I stay in this lonely room instead And I'm just Barely holdin' on This life get scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone Starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tell me, but I'm strong That's what you wanted to tell me all along Death in the air, that shit'll leave you with a chilled spine Even though my spirits down, like, I'm okay, I feel fine Shots from that steel nine, ain't from that hillside I'm from the trenches where they murder just to kill time A heavy heart, eyes rollin', through dark times, soulless Sorry that they took your son, I'm sendin' my condolence Gotta face the facts when the truth unfoldin' I hope you know this That I'm just Barely holdin' on This life get scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone Starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tell me, but I'm strong That's what you wanted to tell me all along Ooh, there's a power in your soul Ooh, and I wanted you to know
After my sister died of a drug overdose, Polo G and YNW Melly and  Xxxtentacion and juice wrld and Sleepy Hallow have helped me from going down the same path as her.

WHEN FACING UNFATHOMABLE CHALLENGES, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT U HAVE A SUPPORT TEAM TO SURROUND URRSELF/// I KNOW THAT WITHOUT A VISION OF SUCCESS ON BEATING WHATEVER URR UP AGAINST  CHANCES RR U WONT MAKE IT. ONLY ALLOW POSITIVE PEOPLES AROUND U DURING THIS PROCESS/// AND SURROUND URR DWELLING WITH PICTURES OF TRUSTWORTHY INDIVIDUALS , EVEN IF U NEVER MET THEM, JUST ANY OTHERS THAT HAVE PERSEVERED OVER HUDGE OBSTACLES, ATHLETES, CELEBRITIES, ORR ANY ONES WHO CONCURED WHAT URR FACING, IT WILL BRING U COMFORT DAILY, POLO G  IS WISE BEYOND HIS YRS  GREAT SONG & AWESOME VIDEO 🏁🏁🏁

Not a huge fan of the genre but it’s refreshing to see a film clip that feels real. Come to think of it his lyrics are pretty levelheaded and from the heart too.  Props to that kid in the wheelchair. I’ve been in one for 15 years, he shoots hoops way better than me. To think he ended up that way because someone shit him when he was 6 is just disgusting.
I see you speaker knockerz
❤💞💞♥️🥰😍🤩💯💌💕💓💓💞💖❣️🌹🌷
2024 who's here
I respect Polo alot for this, he is different from other rappers with a real true heart
The only reason I’m here because of him
So many inspirational people at the end of the video! Willie instantly inspired me as soon as I heard his powerful voice and message ❤️
When I realized who the kid was I immediately started crying  🏀🥲sports save lives

That's what I get exhausted thinkin' Can't be ungrateful 'bout this life, you know we fought to see it I'd rather you hate me while I'm here than love me when I'm dead They sent that text that Twinnem check, can't stomach what I read Like life been pushin' me too far and I'm stuck on their ass Don't wanna party, I stay in this lonely room instead And I'm just Barely holdin' on This life get scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone Starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tell me, but I'm strong That's what you wanted to tell me all along Death in the air, that shit'll leave you with a chilled spine Even though my spirits down, like, I'm okay, I feel fine Shots from that steel nine, ain't from that hillside I'm from the trenches where they murder just to kill time A heavy heart, eyes rollin', through dark times, soulless Sorry that they took your son, I'm sendin' my condolence Gotta face the facts when the truth unfoldin' I hope you know this That I'm just Barely holdin' on This life get scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone Starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tell me, but I'm strong That's what you wanted to tell me all along Ooh, there's a power in your soul Ooh, and I wanted you to know  Hầu như không giữ được Cuộc sống này càng lúc càng đáng sợ Gánh nặng khi chúng ta tiếp tục Tôi không hoàn hảo, hãy tha cho tôi nếu tôi sai Hy vọng bí mật của tôi sẽ bị chôn vùi khi tôi ra đi Nhìn chằm chằm vào dòng chữ trên những bia mộ này Họ tiếp tục cố gắng nói với tôi, nhưng tôi mạnh mẽ Đó là điều anh muốn nói với em bấy lâu nay Không khó để nhận ra anh ấy vì tất cả những suy nghĩ của anh ấy đều được tweet Chúng tôi đã nổ súng và bắn anh ta, đó là lý do tại sao áo anh ta bị thủng Bởi vì tôi chưa bao giờ nhìn thấy một gã nigga nào đứng trong quan tài của hắn nói chuyện Chúng tôi đã bắt được tên nigga đó, anh ta không nghĩ rằng chúng tôi đã nhìn thấy anh ta leo lên Đôi khi tôi nhớ những ngày tôi và anh em xa nhau, tinh chỉnh Tôi ghét ngày 18 tháng 9, ngày chúng ta mất đi một con quỷ Tại sao những người thực sự luôn rời đi? Đó là điều khiến tôi kiệt sức khi nghĩ Không thể bạc ơn cuộc đời này, bạn biết đấy, chúng ta đã đấu tranh để có được nó Tôi thà bạn ghét tôi khi tôi còn ở đây còn hơn yêu tôi khi tôi chết Họ đã gửi tin nhắn đó mà Twinnem kiểm tra, tôi không thể hiểu được những gì tôi đọc Giống như cuộc sống đã đẩy tôi đi quá xa và tôi bị mắc kẹt trong mông họ Không muốn tiệc tùng, thay vào đó tôi ở trong căn phòng cô đơn này Và tôi chỉ Hầu như không giữ được Cuộc sống này càng lúc càng đáng sợ Gánh nặng khi chúng ta tiếp tục Tôi không hoàn hảo, hãy tha cho tôi nếu tôi sai Hy vọng bí mật của tôi sẽ bị chôn vùi khi tôi ra đi Nhìn chằm chằm vào dòng chữ trên những bia mộ này Họ tiếp tục cố gắng nói với tôi, nhưng tôi mạnh mẽ Đó là điều anh muốn nói với em bấy lâu nay Cái chết giữa không trung, thứ chết tiệt đó sẽ khiến bạn lạnh sống lưng Mặc dù tinh thần của tôi xuống dốc, như thể, tôi ổn, tôi cảm thấy ổn Những cú đánh từ chiếc thép chín đó, không phải từ sườn đồi đó Tôi đến từ chiến hào nơi người ta giết người chỉ để giết thời gian Lòng nặng trĩu, mắt trợn tròn, qua thời kỳ đen tối, vô hồn Xin lỗi vì họ đã bắt con trai của bạn, tôi gửi lời chia buồn của tôi Phải đối mặt với sự thật khi sự thật lộ ra Tôi hy vọng bạn biết điều này Rằng tôi chỉ Hầu như không giữ được Cuộc sống này càng lúc càng đáng sợ Gánh nặng khi chúng ta tiếp tục Tôi không hoàn hảo, hãy tha cho tôi nếu tôi sai Hy vọng bí mật của tôi sẽ bị chôn vùi khi tôi ra đi Nhìn chằm chằm vào dòng chữ trên những bia mộ này Họ tiếp tục cố gắng nói với tôi, nhưng tôi mạnh mẽ Đó là điều anh muốn nói với em bấy lâu nay Ôi, có một sức mạnh trong tâm hồn bạn Ồ, và tôi muốn bạn biết

The disciples of Jesus were granted a significant level of authority and responsibility when he informed them that their actions on Earth would have corresponding effects in heaven. This revelation serves as both a remarkable privilege and a cautionary reminder for the disciples.

Polo always drops fire, but every once in a while, bro drops one that hits different and almost gets those tears falling, #FeelTheReal
First time hearing this and I almost cried at the end
He never disappoint keep on polo g
from kenya big up polo u music speaks to me alot recently with what has been hapening in nairobi
Take her away from me and earth will shake
"I rather have you hate me while I'm here,then love me when I'm dead."  Takes more to hate someone then to love someone. That's some powerful stuff.
One of the hardest songs he ever made . This song helped me through when my mom was murdered godesst !
This is the best song that i ' ve ever listen
I felt Polo on this one 😢 🎶❤️🔥💯

Not hating, but I’m genuinely curious. Why is he at a piano when piano isn’t really a main focus in the instrumental production?  It’s just an odd choice.

Lyrically he is amazing, and i hope the best for polo
Long live Polo G🔥
PIANO G
Now a days people will rather die or go to jail for their homies in a gang that wont do nothing for you in the end. Rather than live a successful life for their parents/family who brought them into this world and gave them a home/feed/clothes.
Who came from ai sponge bob
he embraced the piano G
I'm leaving this comment here to come back to it anytime someone likes it❤❤
Il es trop fort❤

Bro used the juice wrld type beats
thats a fucking banger holy shit
From pop out to this . Hrs grown as a person and artist
Man i feel like  im dying on the in side and drowning  on the out soud . And i feel my self  will to give up even though  I  have  come   as for as i have i thank god for all my blessings and leasons ,i just cant let any one just treat me like i ant no one and that i dont give my all for any and everyone  no matter  what they have done to me . But i pushed up against  my self wanting  to get some get back and nowing that ,that ant going to solve nothing but at the same time doing the right thing has been the best thing i could do but im hurt and lost and got qutions that i need some  anwsers to cause iv been cut so deep that i no how im and i no how it is to see some one you love hurt cause of the thjngs you do . Been there done  that but me being real and maning up made so many people  hat me and even the people that I though had me changed up to be i forgive them all but i cant keep letting anyone us me and act like they cair but they wirds dont macth they action and i no my Attitude dont make it no better. But iv feel ive tried  useing everything  i learnd in canceling and Humbling humbling myself and be more cautious of things. I feel like people take that as a weakness.
great tune

Luckiest generation to live at the same time as Polo lets hope he does not get taken out like the others
I’m Artist From Chicago Named Lil Strict Check Me Out Tell Me What Y’all Think?
You can't tell me that Polo G ain't the GOAT🐐
🦧🦧🦧🦧best song in the year 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
Huh huh huh huh barely holding scary as it goes on
Good stuff man this is the stuff that should be looked at these days.  Considering we are getting spammed with satanic music videos all the time (like Dojo Cat or whatever her sell-out name is).  GREAT VIDEO don't sell your soul to the music industry bro.  This type of video shows you can do great things without going to the reaper.  This is the first song I heard from POLO G. I like it I hope your other videos and songs aren't covered with the meta of devil imagery we see all the time.  Caring for others which is GOD's creation is the way to go.
🙏🔥 🙏
Polo is the real deal
I just heard the best song of the year😢
Booorrriingggg
Song hits harder now sense I'm battling a unknown sickness. Just got through my needle for my IVS, for my first infusions. Thank you for giving me the strength to fight for my son.

Polo G is a generation star 🌟

I love you polo g
I can't explain it but, this song makes my health anxiety feel like everything will be ok in the end...I feel calm now.
Most relatable song ever 💪🏻
Mann, there is just something about Polo, Juice Wrld and these type of dudes that sing with a voice that feels like it's gonna shatter. So much emotion, makes you wanna breakdown in tears. And there is just something about those lyrics - singing about being gone from this world, while leaving an unprecedented mark...
This song had me in my feelings
If polo g make the beat longer and put lil durk / rod wave and g herbo. Man shit will be 🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤more blessings to polo 🛐

When I was in the hospital May into June.  7 weeks and one day.   Being told I could have cancer, I still would joke with the doctors everyday and laugh.  Hold my head up.  Had them put POLO G on during my MRI.  He helped me get through.  Edit: WOW I NEVER SAW THE VIDEO AND ONLY HEARD ON PANDORA.  I instantly almost started crying realizing it was like the situation I was in. #truestoryhavethedocuments. 🥹🥹🥹😭🫂💛 Thank God I survived

Hard 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
shit was beautiful
only noticing now that this song and the song of lil tjay clutchin my strap sampled the same song
🐐
❄
Cool to rap about weapons in the country, cities nobody cares about. When you in the thick, when your people dying, when you can't walk the block without keeping your head on a swivel. That paranoia. Ain't nothing to rap about no more.
real man
I'm barely believing that rappers from the hood can't create tunes without rapping and still sound epic😇
Where the album drop?
Song of the year ❤
Keep going 🎉💪
💯💯💯💯
he is the groat

That's what I get exhausted thinkin' Can't be ungrateful 'bout this life, you know we fought to see it I'd rather you hate me while I'm here than love me when I'm dead They sent that text that Twinnem checked, couldn't stomach what I read Like life been pushin' me too far and I'm stuck on the edge Don't wanna party, I'll stay in this lonely room instead And I'm just—  Barely holdin' on This life gets scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone Starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tear me, but I'm strong That's what you wanted to tell me all along  Death in the air, that shit'll leave you with a chilled spine Even though my spirits down, like, I'm okay, I feel fine Shots from that steel nine, ain't from that hillside I'm from the trenches where they murder just to kill time A heavy heart, eyes rollin', through dark times, soulless Sorry that they took your son, I'm sendin' my condolence Gotta face the facts when the truth unfoldin' I hope you know this That I'm just—  Barely holdin' on This life gets scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone Starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tear me, but I'm strong That's what you wanted to tell me all along  Ooh, there's a power in your soul Ooh, and I wanted you to know

Why can’t I stop crying, polo g please make more songs like this  The video and song is so beautiful and well presented about life struggles we go through but in the end, preserving and all we reach a place that was better than where we was at.   Like each person related to polo g struggles either with friends, family and himself.   Him and family coming from the hood struggling, him being addicted to drugs before, losing his friends through gun violence so young, idk if he lost someone cause of health problem but yea.   It’s real you know, shows how life is

I lost my first black friend in 9th grade I just only met him in gym class. Life is rough I do wonder where he would be. I am not gonna lie I got lucky a lot in life. Lots of hardships but I ended never going to jail. The only time I got stopped for weed I got lucky it was just a fine. So really inspiring music polo g. I am white but I understand the struggles. Not everyone is privelelged..rest in peace juice your music including flex from polo g is a banger..love more emo in this genre. A little bit of crying is good we are all suffering but life is also good don't give up brothers and sisters.
🐎G❤️‍🔥

Don’t replace Christ in your life with polo g or music in general. Put Christ first and keep Him there. Let Him change you and put yourself under everyone. Even Christ came to serve. Turn to Christ and God bless you all!❤️✝️🙏

pause at 15 seconds and ask yourself who the fuck grabs a gun with claw hands like that
Bro we need more people like you in this world. People be lovers of themselves and not of others. We all think our lives are so bad, are they really? Could you walk one mile in any of the AMAZING INDIVIDUALS shoes? I know I couldn’t. Every other rap song about drugs and getting pussy, escaping a reality that we have created. This kind of music inspires people, it tells a story. It talks about real life, real love. It’s a very HONEST song. We need more music like this and more people like Polo G in this world. He is a real one. This song is amazing imma share the shit outta it. Thank you 🙏
I’ve listened to 20 seconds and this is insane. The song is too good polo!
Keep going polo 🤙
Best song
Dude is the god of music
best song yet
About this song.  It's you who did this video.  It's you who lived to see , and make this video. A humble position is not easy.  Got no one.
Rip big bro
You Are amazing❤❤❤
If anybody the pac of this generation it’s for sure polo
God bless you all 🙏❤️
No smoking no naked women no swearing just 100% talent❤
Love the goat ❤ he's just one of my favorite artists. His voice can change and not many can do that
Another legend with a eternal legacy, a legacy that shows he wants to help other and he’s using his music to do it, polo g forever goatee, and this song is a forever banger💥💥🔥🔥
I have to keep listening to this, this the best song of the year, he’s a goat, a legend, this song and the voice behind the song sends shivers through my body, because for me i don’t feel like there ever been a truer song. This shows you the things people in the world got through, like he said “life gets scarier as it goes on,” and that’s the truth there to much pain to be able to deal with anymore.
I was here when the song was at it's peak If u just coming u re still feeling it aren't you😅😅???
Love this
This easily the best song out 2023
He should collaborate with morgan #1 $0ng belive it

My dad passed away August 1 super unexpectedly and my kids and i were super close to him so it was a hard hit. Since the moment i found out i had turned to music for coping.  The day this video dropped i had the worst day id had since finding out he died. I was beginning to have a mental breakdown when i had this song randomly start playing. I shared this with my bf so he could understand what i was feeling since i couldn't seem to communicate it myself thru words.
I love this song but mainly I love the message behind it this is beautiful 😢
This sh*t 🔥

Hello to those who read this, I take 1 minute of your time to tell you that Jesus loves you with all his heart and that he calls you to follow him, because he loves you so intensely that he is put on the cross to wash away your sins because he loves you more than anyone in this world and Jesus Christ has a plan for you and know that he is coming soon and this world of depravity is over the point of disappearing  Jean 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me  Act 4:12   Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.  jesus is the only way *not buddha *not Muslims * not spiritual *and even less your Sunday evening yoga that will save you  John 8:58 Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am   Exodus 3:14  And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you  ❤🎉

The fact that the kid was only six when he got hit is insane to me I was born with a condition that affects my mobility and sometimes gotta remind myself they didn’t ask for it either I’m not alone and if this kid can survive that then I can survive life in general bros a certified savage, like he was 6 years old his odds of survival woulda been very low and yet this boy still turn up.   ❤❤❤❤

Relatable 💗😭😭 I'm really touched Polo G you're the best
Here for the love of good music
ngl but thats kinda toxic, he was gone for a half year and then he releases another song just so he has enough songs to do a album so he gets another million. He did not even write a comment for this music video which is the last song we will hear from him (atleast for few years). Ngl but he atleast should write like a goodbye comment or something, kinda toxic ngl.
Damn he the 🐐 there’s no debating it
The best song❤❤
The goat is back

Polo G - Barely Holdin' On (lyrics)  [Vocals - Chorus] Barely holdin' on, this life gets scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on, I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone, starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tear me, but I'm strong, that's what you wanted to tell me all along Barely holdin' on, this life gets scary as it goes on  [Verse 1] Ain't hard to figure him out 'cause all his thoughts is tweeted We blew some shots and shot him up, that's why his top was leakin' Cause I ain't never seen a n***a from his coffin speakin' We pick that n***a off, he ain't think that we saw him creepin' Sometimes I miss them days when me and bro was off it, tweakin' I hate September 18th, that's when we lost a demon Why the real ones always leave? That's what I get exhausted thinkin' Can't be ungrateful 'bout this life, you know we fought to see it I'd rather you hate me while I'm here, than love me when I'm dead They sent that text that Twin'Nem check, cut stomach, what I read Like life been pushin' me too far, and I'm stuck on their ass Don't want to party, I'll stay in this lonely room instead And I'm just—  [Chorus] Barely holdin' on, this life gets scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on, I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone, starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tear me, but I'm strong, that's what you wanted to tell me all along  [Verse 2] Death in the air, that shit'll leave you with a chilled spine Even though my spirits down, like, I'm okay, I feel fine Shots from that steel nine, aim from that heel side I'm from the trenches where they murder just to kill time A heavy heart, eyes rollin', through dark times, soulless Sorry that they took your son, I'm sendin' my condolence Gotta face the facts when the truth unfoldin' I hope you know this, that I'm just—  [Chorus] Barely holdin' on, this life gets scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on, I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone, starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tear me, but I'm strong, that's what you wanted to tell me all along  [Outro] Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh there's a power in your soul Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh, and I wanted you to know

“Write my answer plainly on tablets, so that a runner can carry the correct  message to others.  This vision is for a future time. It describes the end, 📖📲 and it will be fulfilled.  If it seems slow in coming, wait patiently, for it will  surely take place. It will not be delayed.  “Look around at  the nations;  🇺🇸🌍🇺🇸 look and be amazed! For I am doing something  in your own day, something you wouldn’t believe even if someone  told you about it.  I am raising up the Babylonians, 🇺🇸🗽🇺🇸 a cruel and violent people. They will march across the world and conquer  other lands.  They are notorious  for their cruelty and do whatever they like. Their horses are swifter  than cheetahs and fiercer  than wolves at dusk. Their armies charge  from far away. Like eagles, they swoop  down to devour their prey.  “On they come, all  bent on violence. Their hordes advance  like a desert wind, sweeping captives ahead  of them like sand. They scoff at kings  and princes and scorn  all their fortresses. They simply pile ramps  of earth against their walls  and capture them! They sweep past like the  wind and are gone. But they are deeply guilty, for their own strength is  their god.” 💵💰💵  'Look at the proud! 🇺🇸 They trust in themselves,  and their lives are crooked. But the righteous will live  by their faithfulness to God.  Wealth is treacherous, and  the arrogant are never at rest. They open their mouths as wide as the grave, and like death, they are never satisfied. In their greed they have gathered up many nations and swallowed many peoples.  “But soon their captives  will taunt them. They will mock them, saying, 'What sorrow awaits you thieves! 🇺🇸😈👹👿🇺🇸 Now you will get what  you deserve! 🌋🔥🌋 You’ve become rich by extortion,  but how much longer can this go on?’ Because you have  plundered many nations, now all the survivors  will plunder you. You committed murder throughout the countryside and filled the towns with violence.🇺🇸💲🗽💲🇺🇸  “What sorrow awaits you  who build big houses with money gained dishonestly! You believe your  wealth will buy security, putting your family’s nest beyond the reach of danger. But by the murders you committed, you have  shamed your name  and forfeited your lives. The very stones in the walls cry out against you, and  the beams in the ceilings  echo the complaint.  “What sorrow awaits you  who build cities with  money gained through  murder and corruption! Has not the Lord of  Heaven’s Armies promised that the wealth of nations  will turn to ashes? They work so hard, but all in vain!  For as the waters  fill the sea, the earth  will be filled with  an awareness of  the glory of the Lord.  “What sorrow awaits you  who make your neighbors drunk! You force your  cup on them so you  can gloat over their  shameful nakedness. But soon it will be your  turn to be disgraced. Come, drink and  be exposed! Drink from the cup  of the Lord’s judgment, Yellowstone volcano, 🌋 and all your glory will  be turned to shame.
polo g forever .🤞🏾💕
The American Dream  is the national ethos  of the United States,  a set of ideals  including  representative democracy, rights, liberty, and equality,  in which freedom is interpreted as the opportunity f🤑r individual prosperity and success, as well as upward social mobility for oneself and their children, achieved through hard work  in a capitalist society with few barriers.  However I say; A hungry person dreams of eating but wakes up still hungry. A thirsty person  dreams of drinking but is still faint from thirst when morning comes. So it will be for you, 🇺🇸 enemies of God. 💥🌋
Spoke to a lot of us💯

I don’t like much of the new hip hop but songs like this are great fresh breath of air knowing that songs like this are made to motivate those in the struggle to keep going on through music thanks for the hope polo g
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
always funny seeing lazy rappers come up with a catchy hook that kind of sounds like its meaningful - but then they'll go off with verses that make no sense / and promoting violence/drug use xD  "Ain't hard to figure him out 'cause all his thoughts was tweeted We blew some shots to shut him up, that's why his top was leakin' 'Cause I ain't never seen a nigga from his coffin speakin' We picked that nigga off, he ain't think that we saw him creepin' Sometimes I miss them days when me and bro was off it, tweakin'"
Piano Polo is goated

This song really is beautiful reminds me of my grandmother who just passed away shed a tear while listening
this legit is me rn. I've been through so many ups and downs in the past year, but most recently has been the worst. the only thing I have to look forward to everyday is music, I don't have friends who check up on me, shit my family doesn't even check on me, but your music, lil tjay's, and some of NLE Choppa's is so relatable and heartfelt that I tend to lean on it whenever I truly need support from someone, so thank you.
AWSOMEEE

I LOVEEE YOUR MUSSSIC
Who like the music❤❤❤
Loveeee his music, My husband introduced me to his music from his MJ annie are ok rendition.  I was watching a series on Hulu and he was featured in it. Dude has had it fucking rough but he's not afraid to show emotions. that's a beautiful trait to have. I'm 35 but in my parents generation and even worse with their parents our grandparents.  it was that men HAD TO BE TOUGH AND NEVER SHOW THEIR REAL EMOTIONS,  LET ALONE CRY.  Which has passed a lifetime of trauma to some of us.  man, woman, I'm not listening all genders but we are all just humans, it's OK and healthy to cry sometimes!!!
Polo 🐐

You better take yall ass to college or a trade school because it's expensive now and working at Walmart won't cut it. You better be more concerned with your Fico score or you'll be a debt slave for the rest or your life and you will never own shit. Selling drugs is definitely not the way out of poverty. You will look like a loser selling drugs at 30 years old it's definitely not the way to a normal life.
Hell nah 2.4 Million views Inn 3 days🚩 ?In (Konye west voice) 🖼a lot of ppl in Hollywood comes up missing 🗺….Poor soul 📈
This shit is so fire i get chills every time I listen to it
The song contradicts itself. You complain about all the violence and all the people that you love dying, but then you're promoting the violence and further pursuing it. It contradicts itself, and no gangsters are innocent. You all have no heart and soul. You kill innocent people, and now you want to cry Baby and play the victim?
Kmon Polo 🏇🏿🔥🔥 runnis shi up rq

"I'm from the trenches where they murder just to kill time" 🩸🩸🩸
Lyrics  Huh, uh, uh, uh (808 Mafia) Huh, uh, uh, uh Huh, uh, uh, uh  Barely holdin' on, this life get scary as it goes on Burdens what we carry on I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone Starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tell me but I'm strong That's what you wanted to tell me all along  Ain't hard to figure him out 'cause all his thoughts is tweeted We blew some shots and shot him up, that's why his top was leakin' 'Cause I ain't never seen a nigga from his coffin speakin' We pick that nigga off, he ain't think that we saw him creepin' Sometimes I miss them days when me and bro was off it, tweakin' I hate September 18th, that's when we lost a demon Why the real ones always leave? That's what I get exhausted thinkin' Can't be ungrateful 'bout this life, you know we fault to see it I'd rather you hate me while I'm here than love me when I'm dead They sent that text that Twin'Nem check, can't stomach what I read Like life been pushin' me too far and I'm stuck on their ass Don't want to party, I stay in this lonely room instead And I'm just  Barely holdin' on, this life get scary as it goes on Burdens what we carry on I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone Starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tell me but I'm strong That's what you wanted to tell me all along  Death in the air, that shit'll leave you with a chilled spine Even though my spirits down, like, I'm okay, I feel fine Shots from that steel nine, aim from that heel side I'm from the trenches where they murder just to kill time A heavy heart, eyes rollin', through dark times, soulless Sorry that they took your son, I'm sendin' my condolence Gotta face the facts when the truth unfoldin' I hope you know this, that I'm just  Barely holdin' on, this life get scary as it goes on Burdens what we carry on I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone Starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tell me but I'm strong That's what you wanted to tell me all along  Ooh, there's a power in your soul Ooh, and I wanted you to know
He music is getting better

Ngl this hit me right in the feels. I was 16 when I got shot, loss the use of my legs for nearly 5 months. I was just growing up and didn't even get a chance to. Lost a dear friend of mine as well. All because some kids thought it would be cool to drive by my house and start shooting.  RIP tHrax.

So glad I found you from one of those YouTube shorts of someone doing a free vid for you. Found you through that and enjoyed the music that was used in it and this is my first actual song I listened of yours and damn, it's a deep one. Beautiful, sweet, with hints of the real life sadness. This, is, a real, song. It's what songs were born from, stories.
👍

This type of Hip-Hop enough being tough yeah you all got guns and money and you made it but what about the ones that didnt make it to see another day what about the old man struggling to feed his family and keep the lights on, all the rappers got their money now its time to talk about the problems and fix them, not continue them I mean why did you start rhyming in the first place?

1:14 Polo Is Rapping And Talking Bout His Late Childhood Friend Tim Tim Who Was Shot and Killed On September 18 2014
This song gives me wings
The goat did it again👌
🔥🔥🔥🔥
To see where Polo G started and how far he’s come is amazing. We don’t know how this man grew up but if we had to speculate a little bit and we did, to make it from where he comes from is an anomaly and to see what he’s been doing and does for our community. This MAN gets it! And always use that word man sparingly because there aren’t many. Polo G keep being great and you are the definition of age does not define wisdom!
Bro this is lowkey something Juice would have dropped. Polo is a true artist
Why am I finding this artist today and why is he already retiring?
He just dropped the best song of the year! Congratulations 🎉🐐
Polo Is Back

Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
barely holding on to his shity career
best artist of all

Listening to this and trying to relate to the news that you contemplating retirement, all I can say is the world needs Polo G... You one of greatest rappers of your generation and as a up and coming rapper myself all I can do is try and follow the paths that the greats pave and you've been doing that, paving the way for the next generation and for that thank you. Although you have your reasons I just hope you decide against retirement, at least for us, your fans, the youngbloods who look up to you.  @polog
Maybe he going to drop something harder than a gift n a curse

I’m glad to say this is my new favorite song by Polo G for sure. Polo G if you ever read this I wanna wish you the best man, I don’t just hear and feel you, but I also always understand what your saying and rapping about. It’s the best feeling to actually be able to understand you and be able to relate. Not everything you been through has been pleasant but I understand you and your pain and I just wanna let you know that fam. You’ll always have a special and unique place in my heart that nobody else can touch or take away from either of us period. I’m proud of you man. Congratulations for all your success, I’m sorry for all your pain.

Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The New World Order is about to come into power and the world is about to go into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they repent and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.        Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Repent of your sins and get saved now before it’s too late. John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Here are a couple links for further information.

Goosebumps 🥲
I dont get the hate in some comments, when an artist finds his style you call their songs generic, when they branch out you  say they should stick to what the know best. Polo G's style is great and he knows what works best for him instead of trying to experiment he stays true to his style and his fans love it! I personally love it.

Whoever said polo g casually dropped the best song of the year is 100% right. It's sad that this is relating to so many hurting souls out there that are barely holding on. But I feel a turn in this generation, I'm 22, just now starting to feel better about life and starting to have fun again... The sun shines more than it rains. At least down here in south Ga. y'all stay up
Song of the year easily

That's what I get exhausted thinkin' Can't be ungrateful 'bout this life, you know we fault to see it I'd rather you hate me while I'm here than love me when I'm dead They sent that text that Twin'Nem check, can't stomach what I read Like life been pushin' me too far and I'm stuck on their ass Don't want to party, I stay in this lonely room instead And I'm just  Barely holdin' on, this life get scary as it goes on Burdens what we carry on I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone Starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tell me but I'm strong That's what you wanted to tell me all along  Death in the air, that shit'll leave you with a chilled spine Even though my spirits down, like, I'm okay, I feel fine Shots from that steel nine, aim from that heel side I'm from the trenches where they murder just to kill time A heavy heart, eyes rollin', through dark times, soulless Sorry that they took your son, I'm sendin' my condolence Gotta face the facts when the truth unfoldin' I hope you know this, that I'm just  Barely holdin' on, this life get scary as it goes on Burdens what we carry on I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone Starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tell me but I'm strong That's what you wanted to tell me all along  Ooh, there's a power in your soul Ooh, and I wanted you to know

Matthew 11:28 "come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and i will give you rest"  Put your faith in the lord bro he will take all your burdens from you so that you may rest on him 🙏🏼🙏🏼
1 Timothy 3:16 KJV And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.   1 John 1:9 - If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.  Luke 13:3 - I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.  Acts 3:19 - Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;  2 Peter 3:9 - The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.  Acts 2:38 - Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.  Matthew 3:2 - And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.  1 Corinthians 10:21 King James Version 21 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.  Revelation 20 King James Version 20 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.  2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,  3 And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.  4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.  5 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.  6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.  7 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,  8 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.  9 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.  10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.  11 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.  12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.  13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.  14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.  15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.  James 4:7-10 KJV Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded. Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.  Luke 15:7-10 King James Version 7 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.  8 Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?  9 And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.  10 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.
beatiful.

My friend put me onto polo G when the song pop out came out. Sadly my friend took his life 4 years ago and to this day it hurts. Polo g has became my favorite rapper and seeing this masterpiece just help me lift something off my shoulder it felt like. Like I needed this. Seeing polo g expand his catalog and becoming not just a rapper but a motivation is pure.

There's nothing more realler than a conscious rapper that has made it from the struggle and has the ability to paint a vivid picture without glorifying the traumas of it. That's why polo G has a diverse fan base. Ultimately securing a bag no matter how he comes. Twitter is garbage and a waste of time😂😂. -Jaquez Barber

(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."

Chicago artists the best on planet Earth
hit.
I won't lie ever since this song came out it has been repeating on my phone till now
Man music really needs this man. He talks about topics that a lot of these other rappers are scared to touch because they know it wont pull the same views as talking about murdering people or whatever. The "piano g" trolls are just the vocal majority but they are in the minority at the end of the day becuase every time Polo drops its nothing but love in his comments. I really hope he doesnt actually quit music but if he does he has certainly left his mark on the industry.
BRO i dont know what it is but this song hits diffrent
Little do all of you know, he gave each person 10k after the shoot. Truly a great guy.
🇦🇴🇦🇴🇦🇴🇦🇴

(Lyrics): [Intro] Huh, huh, uh, uh (808 Mafia) Huh, huh, uh, uh Huh, huh, uh, uh  [Chorus] Barely holdin' on, this life gets scary as it goes on (phew) Burdens while we carry on, I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone, starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tear me, but I'm strong, that's what you wanted to tell me all along  [Verse 1] Ain't hard to figure him out, 'cause all his thoughts was tweeted We blew some shots to shut him up, that's why his top was leakin' 'Cause I ain't never seen a nigga from his coffin speakin' We pick that nigga off, he ain't think that we saw him creepin' Sometimes I miss them days when me and bro was off it, tweakin' I hate September 18th, 'cause that's when we lost a demon Why the real ones always leave? That's what I get exhausted thinking Can't be ungrateful 'bout this life, you know we fall to see it I'd rather you hate me while I'm here, than love me when I'm dead They sent that text that Twin'Nem check, couldn't stomach what I read Like life been pushin' me too far, now I'm stuck on the edge Don't want to party, I'll stay in this lonely room instead And I'm just—  [Chorus] Barely holdin' on, this life gets scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on, I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone, starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tear me, but I'm strong, that's what you wanted to tell me all along, oh  [Verse 2] Death in the air, that shit'll leave you with a chilled spine Even though my spirits down, like, I'm okay, I feel fine Shots from that steel nine, aim from their heel side I'm from the trenches where they murder, just to kill time A heavy heart, eyes rollin', through dark times, soulless Sorry that they took your son, I'm sendin' my condolence Gotta face the facts when the truth unfoldin' I hope you know this, that I'm just—  [Chorus] Barely holdin' on, this life gets scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on, I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone, starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tear me, but I'm strong, that's what you wanted to tell me all along  [Outro] Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh there's a power in your soul Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh, and I wanted you to know  Tags: Barely Holdin’ On Polo G Barely Holdin’ On Polo G Barely Holdin’ On Lyrics Barely holdin' on this life gets scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on I ain't perfect spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tear me but I'm strong that's what you wanted to tell me all along Barely Holdin On Barely Holdin’ On Lyrics

Nah, I can safely say that Polo is my favorite artist right now and maybe my all-time favorite. He has come to a point where he has so many bangers that I resonate with man. If I see a new song from him, I know it's gonna be hit every time. Thats rare these days.

After listening to this track, I am completely immersed in Polo G's world.

The way he expresses dark moments, losses, and internal struggles is both poignant and sincere. It feels like Polo G is opening up his heart and sharing his deepest thoughts with his listeners, creating an authentic connection. The catchy melody and harmonious vocals in the chorus add an extra layer of emotion to the song. It's a powerful piece that reminds us of the importance of staying strong and moving forward despite the obstacles. A true musical gem that resonates with our own journey through life.

Um dos melhores rappers da atualidade❤
This video is so heart warming. Stay Positive and don't let anyone tell you what you can and cannot do. It's your life. Your choice. Just make a right one. Never give up on your dreams. My parents always tried to stop me from making music and I keep trying to make it cause im not a quitter. Just because I might wont make it. Doesn't mean I can keep trying. LND! Much love to My Dwag Polo. Ever since juice wrld died his death inspired him to stop popping pills. I'm here to make a difference. If I can do it. Then you can to. Just never give up and keep trying.
Always dropping some that touch your soul 🖤🐐🔥
was that his balls...

[Intro] Huh, huh, uh, uh (808 Mafia) Huh, huh, uh, uh Huh, huh, uh, uh  [Chorus] Barely holdin' on This life gets scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone Starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tear me, but I'm strong That's what you wanted to tell me all along  Verse 1] Ain't hard to figure him out 'cause all his thoughts was tweeted We blew some shots to shut him up, that's why his top was leakin' 'Cause I ain't never seen a nigga from his coffin speakin' We picked that nigga off, he ain't think that we saw him creepin' Sometimes I miss them days when me and bro was off it, tweaking I hate September 18th, that's when we lost a demon Why the real ones always leave? That's what I get exhausted thinking Can't be ungrateful 'bout this life, you know we fought to see it I'd rather you hate me while I'm here than love me when I'm dead They sent that text that Twinnem checked, couldn't stomach what I read Like life been pushin' me too far and I'm stuck on the edge Don't wanna party, I'll stay in this lonely room instead And I'm just—  [Chorus] Barely holdin' on This life gets scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone Starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tear me, but I'm strong That's what you wanted to tell me all along  [Verse 2] Death in the air, that shit'll leave you with a chilled spine Even though my spirits down, like, I'm okay, I feel fine Shots from that steel nine, aim from that hillside I'm from the trenches where they murder just to kill time A heavy heart, eyes rollin', through dark times, soulless Sorry that they took your son, I'm sendin' my condolence Gotta face the facts when the truth unfoldin' I hope you know this That I'm just—  [Chorus] Barely holdin' on This life gets scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone Starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tear me, but I'm strong That's what you wanted to tell me all along  [Outro] Ooh, there's a power in your soul Ooh, and I wanted you to know

This life gets scary as it goes on
Polo never disappoints
Your legacy will never die, you’re the real goat 🐐 and you gon’ be remembered forever ♾️  Thank you Polo 👑🙏🏾
Aye dummy I don’t do comments but dis shit here is fire🔥 no cap hope all is well wit u mentally nd physically @polog
This made me genuinely cry😭, this is so heart felt I can’t imagine what others are going through during these lonely times😭I’m alone too and I just want to say to anyone who feels the way I do, stay strong, happy times will come and your time will be fulfilled with happiness. Be strong now an endure the pain, pain is only temporary, loneliness is temporary. Nothing last forever so enjoy it, don’t be down, keep ya head up
Very cool to dance  🔥💃🕺🎧🎉
I love how Polo always keeps the unfortunate in his heart. He always mentions his too early taken away friends. That has never changed throughout the years!  As real as it gets. A perfect track to start his farewell tour. I know he ain't retiring foreva tho, I would love to see him go a Kanye route, experiment a little and sing more. Has a beautiful singing voice. Very underrated!
This is deep 😢

My Tia just passed away last night while I was at work I was gonna see her today because I work 12 hour shifts I was exhausted, take this as a sign to reach out to those who u lost connection to, forget the ego all that is a horrible way to live, my cousins losing their mom hurt me more than I thought if ur suicidal or anything depression know that someone would love to be in ur spot live life to the fullest I know that’s cliche but I’d rather be cliche than live a life full of myself and not others

That's what I get exhausted thinking Can't be ungrateful 'bout this life, you know we fall to see it I'd rather you hate me while I'm here, than love me when I'm dead They sent that text that Twin'Nem check, couldn't stomach what I read Like life been pushin' me too far, now I'm stuck on the edge Don't want to party, I'll stay in this lonely room instead And I'm just—  [Chorus] Barely holdin' on, this life gets scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on, I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone, starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tear me, but I'm strong, that's what you wanted to tell me all along, oh  [Verse 2] Death in the air, that shit'll leave you with a chilled spine Even though my spirits down, like, I'm okay, I feel fine Shots from that steel nine, aim from their heel side I'm from the trenches where they murder, just to kill time A heavy heart, eyes rollin', through dark times, soulless Sorry that they took your son, I'm sendin' my condolence Gotta face the facts when the truth unfoldin' I hope you know this, that I'm just— [Chorus] Barely holdin' on, this life gets scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on, I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone, starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tear me, but I'm strong, that's what you wanted to tell me all along  [Outro] Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh there's a power in your soul Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh, and I wanted you to know

LYRICS:  [Intro] Huh, huh, uh, uh (808 Mafia) Huh, huh, uh, uh Huh, huh, uh, uh  [Chorus] Barely holdin' on, this life gets scary as it goes on (Phew) Burdens while we carry on, I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone, starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tear me, but I'm strong, that's what you wanted to tell me all along   [Verse 1] Ain't hard to figure him out, 'cause all his thoughts was tweeted We blew some shots to shut him up, that's why his top was leakin' 'Cause I ain't never seen a nigga from his coffin speakin' We pick that nigga off, he ain't think that we saw him creepin' Sometimes I miss them days when me and bro was off it, tweakin' I hate September 18th, 'cause that's when we lost a demon Why the real ones always leave? That's what I get exhausted thinking Can't be ungrateful 'bout this life, you know we fall to see it I'd rather you hate me while I'm here, than love me when I'm dead They sent that text that Twin'Nem check, couldn't stomach what I read Like life been pushin' me too far, now I'm stuck on the edge Don't want to party, I'll stay in this lonely room instead And I'm just—  [Chorus] Barely holdin' on, this life gets scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on, I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone, starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tear me, but I'm strong, that's what you wanted to tell me all along, oh  [Verse 2] Death in the air, that shit'll leave you with a chilled spine Even though my spirits down, like, I'm okay, I feel fine Shots from that steel nine, aim from their heel side I'm from the trenches where they murder, just to kill time A heavy heart, eyes rollin', through dark times, soulless Sorry that they took your son, I'm sendin' my condolence Gotta face the facts when the truth unfoldin' I hope you know this, that I'm just— [Chorus] Barely holdin' on, this life gets scary as it goes on Burdens while we carry on, I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone, starin' at the writin' on these headstones They keep on tryna tear me, but I'm strong, that's what you wanted to tell me all along  [Outro] Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh there's a power in your soul Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh, and I wanted you to know

Jesus loves you all ❤️ and He cares for you all . And let me tell you the good news that Jesus promises. Jesus promises eternal life in heaven but it’s your choice if you want it or not. The Bible says that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead you will be saved (Romans 10:9)

The reason Polo G is successful is cause his music is authentic. He built a loyal fanbase on consistency, and not being swayed into sounding like every artist. I pray one day my music can touch masses like Polo G. But for now I'm just happy being a fan.
Polo G has matured so much in his career, great to see him release this 🔥
Polo IS the Hood Poet.
Can't wait for this to release
