Just for next time.. get a garden hose.. put one side in and suck on the other side till water hits your mouth and it will keep flowing through the hose you can just water your garden straight from the pool through the hose
Always still watching until the end! Loved the video as well
I’m still watching :)
I’m still watching!
I love the way you film and edit your videos :)

Enjoyed this vlog...still watching can't wait for all the autumn content
Loved this cosy 'end of summer' video. Your family is the sweetest :)
Happy Birthday!! Watched all of it. Love your sweet family.
I suspect the podcast is with Steve Bartlett? Just guessing though🥰
Still watchin!
Hi Alfie! I feel the same, I want to slow down and just enjoy the life as it is. I’m a little bit older than you, I’ve got a daughter as well. And I think that I’ve achieved much more than I’ve ever desired.  And I’m still watching, still loving your vlogs. I’m so happy to see how Ottie is growing!😍
i feel so happy everytime i see that little trending under alfie's videos 💜
Love Ottie. She is just so darn adorable!
still watching, always!
Alfie!! On Saturday, September 17 it was my birthday too and I turned 30 with a 14 month old so we have lots in common 😂 Happy birthday!! 🎉
Still watching 😊♥️
My guess is happy mum happy baby
I’m still watching ❤
Still watching! As always, I loved the video. Furthermore, you being active in the gym made me more motivated to go do more exercise myself. Happy belated Birthday Alfie!  P.S. Ottie playing in her little kitchen is really cute 😊
I’m still watching
I’m still watching 💞
Still watching ❤Love videos like this, I’m so here for all the Ottilie content
I was worried that you guys would start making Ottilie the center of your videos which is what some YouTubers do to get more money for videos and and essentially exploit their children BUT I’ve just paused the video to when Zoe’s reading the book to Ottie and I feel like I’m watching an old home video, it’s so natural and not forced 😊
i'm still watching Alfie :)
Still watching 😊 so interesting to see your home sauna.
Happy birthday
I'm still watching 👀
Still watching
Do we know what podcast they are on yet.
I'm still watching x
What podcast did you and Zoe go on?
I’m still watching!! I love the cozy vlog!!
This was such an amazing video…love your thoughts on everything ☺️
im still watching haha
Still watching 😄
i am stilllll watching!! of courseee
I love that Ottie is already aware of the energy crisis, closing the fridge doors xD
Still watching, fam ✌
Autumn is my favourite time and I’m at my happiest ❤god I remember 29. (I’m  still watching. )😊
Every vlog warms my heart. You guys really keep me going xxx
Of course I'm still watching! Gosh Alfie, i absolutely adore your videos!  Keep them like this please
Im still watching ;)
Still watching 😊
Loved this video Alfie!! Happy birthday 🎉  that infrared sauna looks badass. Good size. Good luck with the ice bath prepping 🥶 have you ever done a proper one?
IM STILL WATCHINGGGGG :))))))
Ottilie is so adorable. She has the cutest smile of pure joy and she is already very smart. I think when Zoe read the book to her she might have closed it to quickly at the end so that Ottilie could have a good look at the dog. I think that's why she eagerly tried to flip through the pages again. Don't you think?
I’m still watching 😋
Love to see you trending Alfie ❤
happpy late birthday  alfie
I just realized Ottie is just walking around when last vlog she needed assistance. Obviously I would like to respect the privacy of your child but I just simple can’t get enough of her and need a Ottie channel lolololol
Hope you had a lovely birthday Alfie x
Been a viewer of both you and Zoe since before you were a couple and it's been a nice constant through all of the changes over the years.  I love that even in all of your success you've both stayed so grounded :) and also Ottie is so cute! She makes the vlogs even better <3
I am still watching xx
still watching🫶🏼
I’m still watching❤
Still watching! Still makes my day, for over 7 years now! More power always 🤍
You should go to Finland to test a bit better sauna and instead of a cold shower try a hole in the ice called avanto! It helps your immune system and relaxes muscles. Love to watch your family vlogs 🥰
Cute video, thanks for sharing. Happy birthday for September 17th xx
I've never heard a Shagged, Married, Annoyed episode with guests.. but if that were to happen my year would be MADE 😍😆
Still watching, and happy birthday! ❤
I have watched this all the way. Happy birthday x
Such a wholesome vlog Alfie ❤
I’m still watching! Alfie, you’re such a vibe. Your energy is balanced and it comes through in your vlogs. Enjoying the health and wellness content. Would also be keen on mindset and entrepreneurship content. You really seem to have cracked the code on bringing one’s goals to fruition. Would love to learn more. It’s super motivating.  Happy Birthday 🎉
Happy late birthday Alfie. Hope you had a great day. I can’t believe how time has flown. I was here since the nugget challenge era. I definitely feel my age. 😂😂 I really find your nature shots so relaxing.  Hope you all have a great Sunday ❤
Been with you for years! Not going anywhere soon.
Does anybody know where alfie got his Peace & Quiet T-Shirt from?? Has he ever said?! Every time he wears it I want it more haha!!!
now it's 18th, little too late, but.. Happy birthday, Alfie 🍰 Wish you a lot of inspiration and more perfect and shiny days ☺️💗
You are the cutest family of YouTube world and I watch a quite a few families but you are my favourite! Enjoy your little daughter to the fullest because that’s the best times!❤❤❤

Happy belated birthday! So happy for you guys and how far you both have come.
Still watching till the end.🙋🏼‍♀️
You should do something epic to commemorate the last year in your 20's.  Do something 20 times like a run or a hike or something that is more difficult but make it something that will take you some time to do and can be finished within the next year.  A friend of mine did 30 hikes to commemorate his last year in his 30's.
Happy Birthday Alfie! Today is also my granddaughters birthday, and she is 4. Ottie is growing so fast and is such a joy to watch.
Still watching!
I’m still watching
My ultimate comfort YouTubers, going through a really tough time at the moment in life and your videos take my mind off things and are so comforting

Happy Birthday Alfie! Loved this video x
I'm still watchin!
Oooo so exciting!! I’m hoping it’s the RomanAtwood Podcast!!!
Loved the balance of everything in this video like you said! ❤
I'm still watching. Happy birthday! 🍾
Still watching!!
I’m still watching ❤ it’s so crazy because I didn’t realize how much I’ve grown until Alfie said he’s turning 29.. I used to watch him when he was like 18/19 when I myself was 13/14. So crazy.. I really grew up watching him and Zoe
I started watching you and Zoe back in 2012 (around that time) and it has been incredible watching the growth of you two as a couple and individuals! I'm loving the family vlogs with Ottie! She's adorable
Grated babybel is LUSH THO🤌🏼
Happy birthday,  And I am still watching till the end!, Actually, I always do, and I put thumbs up also, so I know that I have watched it from beginning to end thank you. Have a lovely week!😊
I'm still watching!
The love I see among you all and, especially, to Ottie is just so hear-warming. Her walking is just too cute. What a lucky child to have parents who give her unlimited love.
Still watching to the end - your videos are always a highlight.
I remember that Dear Zoo book from when I was a kid. I LOVED it!
I'm still watching ❣Happy Birthday Alfie!
I have been watching Alfie and Zoe since 2013. I would never imagine sitting here watching little Ottie, as I went from an awkward teen to now studying away from home❤ I don’t even know where the time went. Alfie and Zoe’s videos has always been something that is and has been consistently good. Your driven from passion and inspire others. You give people motivation and the positive mindset to keep trying to be the best possible versions of themselves ✨ From a thankful 20 year old girl in Oslo, trying to figure out live🤞🏼
Happy Birthday! 🎉 last year of your 20s!
Alfie! Happy Birthday 💛🥳 Would you be able to do a little video on your favourite clothes and clothing brands? My boyfriend needs inspiration! haha
I found the perfect egg for small children in the toy shop and I thought I can fill up the cardboard egg case. ❤
You need to send little Ottie round to Auntie Dianne's house, to help her to remember to close all the cupboard/fridge doors in her kitchen!  She looked so at home in her own little kitchen.  Cute!
I’m still watching! Did you end up getting the pool down? Also..how’s the garden!
I am still watching :)
Happy birthday.. hope you have a amazing day
Happy birthday alfie. Loved the vlog. Thanks for it ❤️

I'm still watching haha ♥Happy birthday Alfie! Hope you've had a fantastic day with your adorable little family and all your loved ones (seems to be the case on your IG stories)! I never comment on YouTube videos but I just wanted to let you know that your vlogs have been bringing me joy, peace and comfort during these last few months (which have been particularly chaotic). Thank you for it and I'm looking forward to many more sweet life moments shared by you and Zoe. PS: Cute little Ottie is growing up so fast omg!!
Ottie has grown up SO much since the last vid, its actually crazy!
I appreciate the slowness of yours and Zoe’s last vlog, and the everyday authentic snippets like when Zoe was telling you to be quiet and not to wake ottie while she was making ottie’s cake and then in this vlog when you were setting up the podcast equipment and kind of sighed after Zoe mentioned all the wires ♥️♥️♥️ it feels like a new way you’re filming/editing and I really like it!
i’m still watching 🫶🏼🫶🏼
LOL ottie trying to kick the ball and then falls. So cute

Happy Birthday! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I’m still watching :)))
I'm still watching! 🎉
Ps I think of Zoe every time I order more balsamic glaze from W! 😂
Ottie adorable!
That’s interesting re the season change as I’ve felt it much more this year (and I’m twice your age) but maybe it’s because it went from being a v long/hot/dry summer into what we think of as a very typical early autumn right as Aug turned to Sep. Despite being determined to ignore any autumn home decorating/colours this year & only having 2 changes (spring/summer & autumn/winter), I am def doing ‘autumn’ for 2 whole months Sep & Oct ;)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY ALFIE 🎉 ❤️❤️ love from Chile 💖🙌
Watching from USA
Very relaxing vlog :)

Alfie I was just about to say Happy birthday. Alfie mines tomorrow so I always remember yours. I loved this video can’t believe how much your life has changed but how well you are handling all the changes. Also since when did Ottie start walking were does time go. So happy your so happy and also can’t believe your 29. Wow all grown up. I feel I’m getting mature now being 57 but so grateful for living. Just had my eye removed and so happy all that is sort of over. Now just have to get strong again and start living to the full again. Positivity helps heaps and that’s why I have always love your videos. Sending loads of love Leisa Western Australia xxx
