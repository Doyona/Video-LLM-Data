3:54 THE GLUE
Took me a year to realize boskus was chilling on haven
0:14 *making elephant noises*
And finally, the trailer is 1 year old.
Its Hard to Believe Fire Expansion Is 1 Years ago
Crazy how fire expansion was a year ago
We got common, rare, epic in every seasonal event in msm
I Don’t Get The Fact That Gobbleygourd Really Likes Turkey Although She’s A Turkey Her Self.      Werid. >:(
3:29 GUYS it's the new Acid Element!
Nearly a year later and still feels 🆕
NOM NOM NOM
Is kayna going insane? ( 2:03 )

Alphabet lore band full song
Hey look it’s a Cave island
No no nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

We want epic wublins
3:32  "DUAHH!!  HAZZA-" got me dying 😭😭😭😭
This will forever be a stamp in My singing monsters history
:)
Magickel islands
The title should've been named "monster expansion", because this expansion would've have bisonorus's elements on psychic island, krillby's elements on faerie island, flum ox's elements on bone island, and yelmut's elements on light island..and now the magical islands are already ruined, and I can't listen to them anymore!
Goblygorg is the king
Rare Candelavra: hello there Rare Sprurit: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA rare Candelavra: why is me and Candelavra underrated af
Elmers glue more like flum ox’s
please could you release the rare pixelote rare
no one can complete msm without a break
I AM A BIG FAN I LOVE UR GAME AND CHANNEL
bro when is this on spotify
they need to add a button for all currency , diamonds and food to be gathered in 1 click, children don't need to collect things for 30 min before they can actually play
Kung gobbellygroud😂
2:00  Kayna: 😐
You like mindnight horror school liddy hikky docky zombie onpoo and jono
Nah mf thinks he's the king
FLUM OX  HAS HIS OWN GLUE I DON'T THINK THAT'S GLUE 😅 3:58
Exist to give an hot marshmellow to common Floogull Also to help rare *huzzah* to glue every thing
Huh. Floogulls eat through their noses…. That’s interesting.

0:13 Floogul, More Like Floog-Pissed

Kayna looked traumatized at rare spurrit😂
This trailer came when My dad passed away in like.. Nov. 13 yeah 🥺

Kayna severely punished Rare Spurit 😈 3:51
The thing I'm curious is Why was Edamimi looking at theremind as if she was loved or in impressed by theremind
Now the fire expansion should also be on the main islands, Fire, cold, wind, water, earth
the og noggin is back serving a turkey…

Monclis

v o i d c o r n

MSM please listen carefully cause the reason why people don’t like tribal island is because the rewards are lame 30 = 2 diamonds 50 = 1 diamond and the final reward is 1500 = just 5 diamonds I want you to increase the amount of diamonds you get
I made a fan made island
No werdos!?

Fun Fact: In the CloverSpell update If you watched closely you can actually notice Tuskiski’s egg in between The seasonal’s toes. If you buy Tuski today it’s the same egg. Sure enough the Amber we love is on Faire Island.
Sorry wubox
Do wybić on magical sactunm
Fire monsters really be saying: “Imma break the rules”
I was playing a game right now.
Wean are we gonna get clubbox?
I feel so bad for bowgart, hes my favo and now hes on psycich?!
They should lowkey add a werdoes on fire haven because it would sound so good with werdoes also on the side of that they dhould have a wunox sale every friday where the price goes to thirty million and one last thing is to add more monsters on ethreal workshop and i just got to sy os keep up the good work on msm and msm dawn of fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Psychic Island X Fire Frontier part 1

He my singing Monsters and wubbox baby and my singing Monsters dawn of fire

When are there going to be new monsters on composer island?
gobbledeygourd should not be on the throne
I should've respect the king
Hey My Singing Monsters I have a question?Will the 5 element monsters stay on the magical islands forever?Or not?
A bit of a controversial take: I’m not a fan of this; it feels rather iffy to me
0:55 Isn't it kinda weird that a turkey wants to eat a turkey... It's called cannibalism if you didn't know🙂 It looks tastey🤤....
Please make rare gnarls, PLEEEASEE
First monster is… Raitree! (like rainbow tree)
I make it with my friend
Hi BigBlueBubble can we make the new island? Rainbow island and the new monsters!😊
wait does thant mean fire monsters on magical sanctum? if so here is my predictions: air quint , sneyser and tring
let's be honest, who ACTUALLY expected this to happen?
This now nice
I like how a homage to Tyler getting scared and his scream cutting off at the very end of some trailers, Rare Spurrit goes "Huzza-" and it cuts off. Nice detail My Singing Monsters!
WAS THAT AN IMPACT FRAME OVER A DRILL
NeverMind Next: Festival Of Yay 2023
Legend says Rare Spurrit is still being forced to piece together the cave to this day.      *how did nobody realize gobbleygourd is a cannibal*
I hate this update why because it just doesn’t fit with the monster lore and defeats the purpose of the game
Yelmut: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA- *nom*
This is rare riffraff is not in here
👍👍 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔
It seems to me that it is a harmful game for children, it induces them to buy with money and they are given almost nothing in return every time they buy.
This is the best update EVER! I love this ❤
Priz   novo  sazonal
Why no boskus on fire haven
So, what my DREAM is right now, is for the dream mythicals go to the magical islands as well. That would be really cool if that update would happen.
ive been watching all pf these updates and i still dont know how to get my account back because the facebook glitch is still on me 😭
Wow the amber island monsters are in magical islands
sorry you guys really need to make the monsters cheaper 250 relics is rediculous
my hopes aren't as high as everyone else's, like yeah of course this is mega hype right? but i think you'll get the quad and quint fire monsters on the magical islands by teleporting them from amber island, which is gonna be a pain, but the whole idea is so cool i don't mind this theory a whole lot.
Calling it now, Mimic is gonne be added to Fire Oasis sometime soon.
I swear if I don't see a babygobbleygourd and Feast-Ember Junior this year or the next-
love the game!my user is Methebestek lol and my sister also has an account its xXQueenoliviaXx and it was her b day yesterday!
These monsters are non-breedable and limited time only. Seriously big L from the devs part, not everybody has starshop or amber island currency in droves. Way to think of all the players guys. 👎🏻
0:29
2 more things what about a 6 elemental and a none fire quint
Why don't we have a air quit tho and it could even go to fire oasis and can the next rare wublin pls be pixelotl?
0:53 ok how did I notice that crunch sounds a little like when shrek ate some food in shrek 2
👏👏👍
i wish we could get the perplexplore song with clear audio
i have to imagine that they can only be purchased because I see no way to breed those monsters on those islands.
HEY? Collett news monsters in plant insland?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
HEY MSM THE UPDATED MAP YOUR WORKING ON IS LOOKING GREAT SO FAR I HAVE A IDEA WHERE WHEN YOU SELECT A ISLAND IT WILL SHOW YOU LIKE HOW YOU SHOWED HERE WHERE IT DRAWS ONTO THE MAP TO SHOW WHERE YOU ARE TO THE ISLAND YOU SELECTED
New Monsters will be magical Islands
We Were Spoiled Today. We Got New Fire Haven Skin, Rare Spurrit, Rare Candelavera, Rare Bona-Petite, And The Fire Expansion.
Guys. Who’s know how to breeding candelvra in fire island?
0:40 COFFIN DANCE TIME BABY!
Rare spurrit!!
Did anyone else see the wubbox next to the collosinuim?
This update will be huzzah and I know it!
This was so cool
IM LOVE THE YELMUT ON LIGHT ISLAND!INF PEOPLE LOVE MSM 👇🏼
FLOHAW: OBEY GOBBLYGORT REPPETILLO: OBEY GOBBLYGORT BOSCUS: OBEY GOBBLYGORT BARRB: OBEY GOBBLYGORT
pls update Epic wubbox fire haven
Wait... how will this even work? Like, the required elements aren't even present on these islands. If we are getting more elements on Magical islands, does that mean we'll be getting Magic quintelementals or is this just an outright porting of monsters from Amber Island to others? Edit: Turns out it's just a port.
3:49  kayna: fix that! Kayna: NOW! Spurrit: oh no
3:54 Elmer glue reffrence?
I’m Kinda Pissed Off That There’s More Monsters I Need To Collect On The Magical Islands That I Don’t Know How To Breed. But Like… Amber X Magical… Like Cmon Dude How Cool Is That
I cryed of joy from seing that.
These are the magical islands
3:37 Huzzza-
Fire monsters on magical islands!?.....  Then might add the fanmade monsters
Hrizzza
Can these fire monsters breed in those worlds?
🎉
Since it is a seasonal month on msm can yall make wubblins free to wake up or what
2:00 tadc reference
If I had a nickel for every time the monster handlers tricked us with something related to magicals and fires I would have two nickels Which isn't a lot But it's weird it happened twice.
QUINTS ON MAGICAL ISLANDS!!!!
I love that the MSM team never fails to come up with new creative updates in all the years it’s been around. Great stuff guys!
Well guys prepare for fire expansion
I never expected this in the feast-ember update. Can't wait to see the other fire monsters on magical islands
Yelmut, tiawa and drummidary on light island!
Is that…. RARE SPURRIT?!
Floogull lost his marshmallow to his rare counter part
yay other continents fire elelments
3:36HUZZZ-
It a shame the new map isn’t here
Fire is my favourite element. 🔥
Oh snap this is LIT.
Let’s not ignore the potential map update leak
IM SORRY DID RARE SPURRIT JUST DESTROY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WALLS IN HISTORY
The "HUZZA-" Really got me 😂
THE IMPACT FRAMES WITH THE DRILL
WE NEED A RELIC REWORK
Completely New Huzzah For Me
i LOVE the rare spurrit design
oh yeah, its time
..ouch... THIS IS REAL?
Hey MY singing monsters! The quads and quints cost a lot of relics, and not a lot of people can afford it! I was wondering if you can put the new 4 elementals at 85 relics, and the 5 elementals at 150 relics? Because it might be a bit unfair to people who can’t afford it, but just want the prices to be cheaper, because these prices feel a bit unfair! Thank you my singing monsters!
Looks like the rest of the Fire Monsters are finally going to have their chance to sing on the two Fire Islands and the Magical islands. And you know what? It's about time. I can't think of anyone else who deserves to be part of the songs with the other monsters. I can't wait until the Fire expansion comes out! I know it's gonna be great.
I wonder how this would fit into the...                        LORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Next feast ember put gnarls on plant island it would be more accurate
OH NOW AFTER ALLTHESE YEARS WE GET EDIMIMI ON PSYCHIC ISLAND.
I saw rare floogull
GOBBLEY GOBBLEY GAW GOBBLEY GOBBLEY GOO GOBBLEY GOBBLEY GAW GOBBLEY GOBBLEY GOOOOO
All we need is mimic on plant, Cold, air, water, and earth island.
GHU😃😃
Now im expecting mimic on fire oasis
Floogull:  Let's gather 'round the campfire and sing our campfire song, Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song. And if you don't think that we can sing it faster then you're wrong But it'll help if you just sing along!  Tring: Bum, bum, bum...
1:59 NO! NOT FRONT FACING KAYNA!💀
Something tells me that we’re gonna have to use the monsters on Amber Island and teleport them to the other islands
Great update my singing monsters
fix Facebook problem that I couldn't switch to Gmail
fix Facebook problem that I couldn't switch to Gmail
fix Facebook problem that I couldn't switch to Gmail
fix Facebook problem that I couldn't switch to Gmail
pog pog pog pog pog
Fire expansion :00
Bro that was funny  3:38
OH MY GOD THIS IS AWESOME 🤯🤯🤯
How about werdos at fire haven
Can the next update be a fire haven and oasis epic Wubbox?
Gobbley Gobbley Gahh is back and the fact that Kayna made Rare Spurrit fix the cave paintings with Monster World Elmers Glue is hilarous XDD
It is going g to be a Giant Amber island d crossover event
Fire expansion is getting popular  While ethereal workshop just in the basement
HUZAAAAAA
3:03 what's that in the corner?
and if yes can you tell me when it comes out
Can't believe this update happened right when I spent all my relics on the plant and cold werdos 😅
I lost 300
😭
And I am sad
And not on purpose
I lost my gems
I feel like if they add mimic it could go on fire oasis it fits theme of the island in my opinion
1:59 when you caught your cousin stealing your ps5
Omg
SOON MAP??? And this is the most exciting update yet OMG
monster handlers can you add a full body to the colossals
There's No Werdos in Here
WOW🎉❤
It sucks that there’s no fire oasis wubbox and no fire haven werdos
You bring monster and the             monsters are the only ones who have a few more people to get invisible
dude im freaking out this is so awesome!!
WHERES THE NEW MAP AT BBB!😂
This trailer music should be added to a soundtrack like a remix
Rare spurrit?!?!
Esse evento é espetaculissimo🎉❤🍂🥮🍁
This is great! Hopefully soon we'll get that new map that they promised us 2 months ago!
Gobblygord  Rare Spurrit Fire monsters on magical islands Rare Clandavera
There's only one more things we need.     MY PRECIOUS WERDOS
Wasn’t expecting this but excited nonetheless
My singing monsters you have outdone yourself
i love how at the end rare spurrit was like HZAAHHH
OH HELL MAW WE GOT GNARLS ON BONE ISLAND DAMN TAKE ME MONEY
OH MY GOD THIS IS REAL
SO MANY THINGS ITS SO AMAZING! MORE FIRE MONSTERS ON MAGICAL ISLANDS
I don't usually say this, but this may legitimately be the best update MSM is done. They dropped thirteen new tracks out of nowhere amongst five different Islands, and every single one of the sounds good. This is the update that nobody knew we wanted!
Nobody gonna talk about rare spurrit destroying everything? (1:38)
Wait how we gonna able to breed fire monster
One day i thought of an idea of msm adding all fire monsters into the magical islands and it came true
Sadly I don't have it please tell me how to get it 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Sadly I don't have it please tell me how to get it 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
YOU WHAT.
Kind of disappointed at the fact they reused the amber island breeding method for all of the fire monster additions. And also the fact that they’re limited time, like what???
Ikr
Its not showing the new things for me only gobbleygourd
HUZZAH, great trailer MSM!🎉
This is absolutely INSANE!!!
Is this real tho cause I don’t see in game
WOW JUST WOW
Hol up, you’re telling me they’re putting fire quads and quints on the magical islands?
Use your amber island amber farm for an actual reason the update
Bro, what WTF *Brain loading*
That was so unexpected. We love this. 3:46 Flum Ox’s Glue was quite funny.
3:07 missed opportunity Would definitely put him in plant island too  Even tho it wouldn't make sense.
The perfect cut huzzah part 2
I. Didn't. Expect. Quints.  In. Normal. Island.
Are we not going to talk about how Gobblygourd eyed the turkey
THEY SHOULD OF JUST MADE NEW FIRE ISLANDS AND ATLEAST MADE THE NEW FIRE MONSTERS BREEDABLE ON THE FIRE AND MAGICAL ISLANDS
I didn’t see this coming, can’t wait to see MPG’s reaction
After completing Amber Island for a while, I’m happy to finally have something to use some of my relics on! It’s definitely a surprise! I hope you guys keep adding more.
And that’s why MSM is my favorite game
I needed to deep breath because of hype I was
At first when I saw the point where we saw fire quads and quints on the magical islands I didn’t even believed it- I litteraly dreamed about something similar To this and I was like “Am I dreaming again-” I just thought Candelavra would Be on Fire Haven cuz she was in the background of it and a relic was broken in the nursery
so cool
2:41 guys some spoilers     NEW ISLAND OR CLUBBOX?
Unexpetid
Fine I'll play my singing monster again
Listened to the new Fire haven, *exhales* tsk. They did Buzzinga dirty. It already didn’t play enough
Wow, I didn't know there was a Flum Ox glue company
My dreams came true! I wanted ambers to go to different islands it and came true thanks my singing monsters!
There adding more monsters to the old island!!! Sick
Omg I love this so many monsters!
Sweet! Now, where's the skin for Haven??
OOAAAH MAH GAWD
Bro this gonna give mpg a. Stroke
THis broke my brain
Wow
I love the update and all but can you take into consideration that there are VERY poor people like me? Maybe make the quads breed able at least I have 3 relics and 14 diamonds! Just help me out a little😂😂😂
Ngl no one was expecting this.  Now time for me to waste my 250+ diamonds
Can someone please tell me what is the breeding formula to get the monsters?
LMAO RARE SPRUIT FIXING THE CAVE PAINTING WITH FLUM OX'S IS HILARIOUS- also the fact that floogull's mouth is its trumpet caught me off guard.
I was totally not expecting how PEAK bone island looked.
I thought they were gonna go to composer too
Flumox glue
L UPDATE
0:53 WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS OF BARRB EATING ANOTHER PLANT
NOOOOOOO 😢😢😢😢 I WAS EXPECTING IN THE ENDING THERE WAS GOING TO BE A COLOSSAL AWAKENING AGAIN😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 ending is kinda funny tho
Rare candelavra Noice
At this point, 2023 is a really big year for MSM. Punkleton in DOF, Ethereal Workshop, and now this?! Awesome! I feel like spillin’ out happy tears outta my eyes right now!!!
You did Amber Island exclusive monsters justice by bringing them to other Islands Edit:If I had a nickel for every time a MSM trailer cut right after a "HUZZAH!" I would have 2 nickels its not a lot but its weird it happened twice
THEY MADE GOBBLEYGOURD THE KING!??AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA *EXPLODES*
This is one of the worst updates so far, just because it was unexpected doesnt make it good, and even if the sounds are good that doesnt make up for completely breaking the rules of the world by saying "any monster can just travel to an island and be there" Its a real shame because this couldve been one of the best updates and add quint islands, maybe even werdos on fire haven but noooooooooooo we have to completely change the rules instead of something actually meaningful
Oh that’s dope
Someone help me out can you not breed these monsters on the other island because when you click on them it says buy them instead of buy or breed them if that’s the case I’m really not a fan of this update it’s so hard to get relics it makes it not fun
OMGOSH! WHY, HOW, THIS IS AWESOME!!
FIRE MONSTERS ON MAGICAL ISLANDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This fire expansion is a crazy event but so expensive 😢
Guess that means mythical really is over😢
Did anyone see the flum ox glue
BRO THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!! THE FACT THAT WE GET TO SEE FIRE ELEMENTALS ON MAGICAL ISLANDS REALLY GOT ME SHOCKED WITH HAPPINESS!!!!!!!😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
All hail king gobble
i started up the game checked fire oaisis cus i was like hmm is rare spurrit here  and he was then i went to fire haven checked the store then saw clavavera and my reaction was the markiplier "WHAT??? WHA-- HOW????" after he saw the bite of 87 then i watched the trailer and died
The fire revolution has begun
Bully:your face is ugly!  Me: 2:03
wow! i’m glad to see more islands coming out!
OMG I LOVE THE FIRE QUADS
No werdos🙁
NGL I almost had an aneurysm when it was announced that tiawa and the rest of the fire quads and quints were coming to the magical islands
2:00 Kayna wth
I DID NOT EXPECT THIS
composer?
would this mean...gobblyguard is cannibal?
It’s nice seeing this still going after the big blue blast happened to  continue the legacy of a lot of adults makes my heart feel so lucky enough to find the greatest game generation and the best team to work on it and seeing how we get a new 2X rare/epics is making this this like my dreamland
But when is the next ethereal workshop monster?
0:50 III 16:
Something better happen to ethereal workshop this feast-ember!
when does this come out?
I think it'd be pretty "fire" if Buzzinga got more playtime instead of less.
BOM BOM BOM BOM bom...
Quints on the magical islands!!!?
😮
I wonder if u can breed the quads and quints on the magic islands cuz they don’t have the right elements
This made me fail
Bisonourus on Psychic Island finally
You gotta be kidding me! Holly Molly ! 🤩 i am sooooo excited 😆
*KING GOURD*
Masmalllo tring is brunin 😂😂😂😂
Can’t wait to see gnarls on my favorite island! I love gnarls and am so glad you’re giving other fire quads a chance to shine!
😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
OMG!!!! This is so cool!!! I love this idea
im never gonna complete my magical islands now
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I LOVE BEING LEVEL 79 😭😭😭✨✨✨✨✨ AND GOT THEM 4500 RELICS TOO

And
I like that updaed is cool but how to i get it
live kanya reaction
im so amazed at this update, thank you monter handlers, for this amazing update, and king gobbleygourd is so cute :)
How are you supposed to breed the new fire monsters on the magical islands without buying them!
Epic
How do you breed clandavere in fire heaven
Naaa this is ganna be GOOD
E
Is that a new island skin? I couldn’t get it
I had school ☹️
WHY THEY R LIMITED WHAT HAPPEN WHEN THE TIMES OVER
I was hoping for an ethereal workshop update but what we go is much better
Por favor me dê uma conta nova perdi a minha
Me when this I found this: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Wow, I did not expect Quints on magical islands
SPURRIT HUZA MAN YESSSS
Aiiiaaaiiiaaaaaaaaaaa
Me with my 87 relics and no Amber Island:
I AM SO EXCITED TO GET THESE but I don’t really have that many relics so it may be a while before I get some
LONG LIVE THE GOBBLEYGOURD MAY THE GOBBLEYGORD LIVE FOREVER!!!!
Actually best update ever  I love fire monsters and seeing them finally be used on more islands is like a dream come true
A I know seee the 5 elements of amber island are added to others
YEDSSSSDSSDDDDSSSS OMG
2:41 why is there a wubbox or clubbox there?
I love how they broke the tradition of monsters having to match their island’s element.
Kanya just looks so funny 2:01
I don’t think ANYONE could’ve predicted that fire expansion thing
He my singing Monsters baby wubbox my singing Monsters dawn fire
Huzaa
Never before would i think that the magical islands would get new monsters. I can't wait to see how this works out! Edit: nvm they cost too much☠️
Bro OH MY GOSH THIS IS INSANE
YOOOOO
GOBBLYGOBBLY GAA YESSSSSSSSSSSS I LOVE YU
I just noticed all fire monster went to a magical island
NO WAY!!!!!! FLOOGULL IS BACK FOR SALE THX SO MUCH 😂😂🎉❤
Bro mpg is gonna have a heart attack
Dude that is so "FIRE," Legacy is gonna love rare spurit!
YO THAT'S FIRE
1:36 wait aren’t they on amber island which is on a different dimension? This reminds me with the discovery of 💡 light 💡 island
ЧТО!!!??? НА МАГИЧЕСКИЕ ОСТРОВА МОЖНО БУДЕТ СТАВИТЬ 5 ЭЛЕМЕНТНЫХ МОНСТРОВ только откуда брать 5 элемент или можно будет с острова янтаря на 15 уровне телепортировать?
I hope they can get to Gold Island, I really want everyone on Gold Island one day
the only thing keeping kayna from l killing spuritt was the family friendly boundary
This is changing the magical island forever
New map?
THERE ADDING THE FIRE HAVEN MONSTERS ON OTHER ISLANDS
Kayna thousand yard stare
This is the best update in history
Maybe the amber island monsters are going to magical islands where one of their elements didn't make the cut when the psychic element came in and started the magical class.
This update is very cool and confusing as why they added amber monsters to magical islands
I really like the fire expansion!!  The fire monsters on different islands really put a touch on em' Hear me out tho- The last part was funny
SINCE WHEN WAS MSM COOKING?
Well it looks like the rest of the Fire Monsters are now officially on world tour!
YES A LIGHT ISLAND UPDATE!!!!
Fire Expansion is too exciting 🎉
This is the best trailer!!!
Huzzah!! Now the magical sanctum expansión for the crescendo moon?
Bluds putting monsters that don’t even match the element of the island in those islands 💀💀💀
I'm genuinely flabbergasted... This is just perfect !!! The most unexpected thing ever and every single monster sounds absolutely perfect and enhance their respective island. Hats off BBB, you did all so great and outcome our expectation once again. thank you.
OH. MY. GOD!! THIS MEANS THE MAGICAL ISLANDS ARE NOW QUINT ISLANDS?? THAT’S INSANE? (Wait is that right or are they just the quads and quint)
Man, I thought this was a fan made video at first, but what an unexpected trailer!
Они выпустили обновление, но забыли про словунов (werdos) и сезонный скин
Ngl, I was expecting the new map to arrive as well
i hope that the music in the begining will be a remix of fire haven
FLUM OX HAS HIS OWN GLUE????
New monsters on fire haven and light island and idk what’s this island I think Amber island? And new Monters on bone island and on psychic island and also weirdos on fire haven
Oh no.
HELL YES
This is truly a huzzah moment
I have a question, are the fire expansion reruns gonna be frequently? because y really want all the quads and quints and not wait a lot
At the end of the trailer, it pans out from the continent mural. Soon after this, Rare Spurrit looked at the glue.   Continent 2 confirmed
They made Kayna kinning Pomni
I can totally see the Kayna clip at 1:59 being a reaction gif
3:36 funniest moment
Tuskski on faerie island makes sense
WAIT A SECOND FIRE MONSTERS ON OTHER ISLANDS?
HOLY MOLY. I can't believe the quints finally are outside Amber Island!! Talk about unexpected 😱
❤
no new map :(
TOO MUCH CONTENT IN ONE UPDATE!! I CANT TAKE IT!!
?!?!?!?!??!!
Rare bonapetite isn’t in trailer
2:21
This was amazing!!! So cool!! ❤
This is the best msm update to ever touch this earth.
We're sorry, King. 😭 Fire Haven's gloriously-rizzed up Feast-Ember Skin was accidentally missed! Poor Gobbleygourd. The Monster-Handler Event Planning committee is on the case with an imminent fix! Thanks!
Cool magical island are getting some love.
I’m glad the mural was repaired, that was quite rude of the rare Spurrit… but aside from that this is genuinely an INCREDIBLE update, I’ve been so hyper since this was revealed that this comment is literally me finally calming down from going past my normal limit of excitement!!!😅
That's new
Yooreeek island
I can’t believe this. The monsters on amber Island are coming to other islands. If this was released on my birthday, which was on Monday, this would’ve been one of the coolest birthday present ever.
When the new map and it showed a revamped feast ember skin
yagble
Ok now we know how mimic is gonna be in msm
i always get exited when I see empty speeces in the game
But how can we breed the candelavra and rare candelavra because candelavra has the water element and the fire heaven doesn't have the water element
PLEASE TELL ME THIS IS WHAT WE ALL THINK IS IS, AMBER MONSTERS ON OTHER ISLANDS PLEASE MONSTER-HANDLERS!!!!
Nice to see all the other Fire Monsters be on other (MSM) islands, even if the elements don't match, like Boskus on Fire Haven  Best part was Kayna about to snap after Rare Spurrit drilled through the cave painting
How much time Will the Facebook logo in take to fix
That ending, bahahaha. I'm with Kayna on that one. Watch where you drill! Still, ultimately worth it, because omg. SUPER excited about this, especially with regards to Light!
So when the quints bowhead tuskski and gnarls come to dof they told us the outer islands bowhead will go to space tuskski will go to cloud gnarls will go to cave and party is getting updated with drummidary which I would not excepect
2:00 sus
0:35 Blud turned into king of fire haven
Yessss no werdos! Yes
WE HAVE OFFICIALY HAD OUR THIRD BEST UPDATE EVER 😱😱😱
Kanya casually become pomni
Nope wrong guys
Omg
BRUH IT SAID FLUM OX ON THE GLUE
Hello msm
1:59 when someone takes the last chikin nuggy
Could this update be… A DREAM?!
I Went on twitter and first thing I saw was "We're sorry, King. 😭 Fire Haven's gloriously-rizzed up Feast-Ember Skin was accidentally missed! Poor Gobbleygourd. The Monster-Handler Event Planning committee is on the case with an imminent fix! Thanks!"
I hope these monsters are available frequently
A rare HUZZA MAN IS HERE
Это просто настоящая масштабное обновление🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
The Monstrous words on the map at 2:11 probably deciphers to, if reading from bottom to top and backwards: "Is Muv Aguster Gni there?" Can someone help me with that?😅
DUDE AMBER ISLAND MONSTERS ON MAGICAL ISLANDS!?!?
This is all I wanted to happen
🤯 My mind can only handle so much! It's nice to see a rare Spurrit and Candelavra, but seeing more fire monsters on different islands? I'm in a monster paradise! 🤩
My Predictions: Werdos on fire haven, rare spurrit, rare candalavra (I think I spelled it right), new monster on ethereal workshop and fire monsters on magical islands.
Wait, so are the amber island monsters going to other islands?! That’s amazing!!! 😃😃
THANK YOU MONSTER HANDLERS SO MUCH FOR RARE SPURRIT!!!!!
Eu sou br mas odiei tudo e cade o novo mapa???😡😡😡😡
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Wheres the freaking 6th triple ethereal monster 😭😭😭
I never expected this to happen AT ALL. This update is going to be CRAZY.
This is sooo cool
😥 was cutting off buzzinga's second verse in fire haven done on purpose or was it a coding error?
Front facing kayna haha
This expansion looks fireeeee quints and even more fire elementals on magical islands? And a rare quint? AND THE RARE HUZZAH HIMSELF and the possibility of werdos going on fire haven is nice
New island????
OMG TIAWA on Light Island! Might be single handedly responsible for Light Island's redemption arc. Drummidary and Yelmut are good additions too! Gnarls on Bone is so Epic, Bowhead fittin to bump up Pyschic island listenabillity by like 3x, and Tuskski and Krillby better duet, or else...
Mimic on the naturals?!  Also, Flum ox glue.  0:13 I didn't even notice 😹. Wait, let me guess, it's because it's a Floo"gull" and seagulls... steal food, and now we know how it eats.
Ethereal workshop wave 2 when
Adoreiiii essa atualização!!!!❤
bro no werdos but this is much much better then werdos ngl bc its expaned
I love the updates but where is the new map
O Mike como que vocês vão lançar o mapa de verdade
I wish you could breed them, they are so expensive :(
OMG I LOVE IT I CANR WAIT FOR THE NEW UPDATED
AAHHHHHH IT’S HAPPENING!!!!! AAUUGGHHHH!!!!!!!
FIRE MONSTERS ON OTHER ISLANDS??! WHAAAT
ALL OF THEM WHATTTT
The skin is not like what is in the Game and I am sorry to say this Very bad update, I'm sorry, but I didn't like it
WH- HUHHH????
3:33  This was the second Time that a spurrit got scared.
I am honestly at a loss for words
I wanna get Incisaur and Gnarls on Bone Island Rare Spurrit looks somewhat funny  I would have never expected Rare Candelavra to look like that
2 hour gang 👇
You can’t breed the new monster without water 😂
For fire monsters
This is the best update everrrrr
More space for more monsters on Trible island
OMG FLUM OX ON BONE YESSS
Add rear and epic monsters to dof
This is awesome!!! Gnarls on bone is actually terrifyingly good
OMFG WHERE ARE THE WERDOS ON HAVEN?!?!?! I THOUGHT THERE WERE GONNA BE HAVEN WERDOS 😭
I'm stimming so hard.
KING ME!
My mom said “I like that whale guy! He’s cool.” 💀
Thanksgiving was last month😤😤😤😤😤
Day 1 asking for composer update
OH MY GOSH YAAAAAY
2:00 kayna jumpscare (very scary)
Phangler on evergreen marsh moment
This not only breaks the complete universe of My Singing Monsters, but now songs won't be restricted anymore.
Amber Island monsters can now teleport to the Magical Islands! Absolute HUZZAH!!!
NO WAY!!!!
It amazing thanks my singing monsters
They gave spurrit the pass
The fire monsters are going to spread out across the other islands.
I’m sorry to interrupt you but does it happen now or few days cuz I don’t see the event
SO SURPRISING
Wait so it's canon that the tribal island chambers are now all cracked up from rare spurrit?
This trailer is like a holiday for us! 🎉🥳🤩
I really need 250 relics to buy it in Fire Haven? There is no way to breeding it? D:
Legend says to this day, Rare Spurrit is still using Flum Ox glue to repair the wall he broke through.
(Floogle after rate floogle stole his marshmallow): YOU [TRUMPET CENSOR] NITWIT) also i want to see mimic save amber island all the holes
I thought we were getting tawlkers on the islands BUT THIS IS AMAZING!
Lo suponía que supurrit estaria en la temporada de dia de gracias
I NEED AN EXPLANATION VID
This is easily the best trailer ever.
WHAT THE FRICK- SO MANY NEW THINGS 0-0
THEY ALWAYS KNOW HOW TO GET ME HYPE AGAIN
Should’ve put Incisaur on Psychic Island to reference the vote
Huh.  Was NOT expecting something like this.
Bro they accidently shortened buzzinga
This is one of the biggest if not bestest update of msm history. This is history in the making
Again??? Noooooo.......
I can't wait
The people who say that they are too expensive need to learn why amber island exists
OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME
I never thought this would be how the quads and quints would be added somewhere other than amber Island Well done, Monster-Handlers. We'll done indeed.
Bro Kayna at 2:00
LIVE kayna REACCION 2:01
I'm so excited but I have no relics and my amber island castle needs to be upgraded 😭
great! cant wait to never get them on my islands because of the obscene amount of relics they cost 👍
When rare shugabush
Why am i kinda dissaponted like atenwe guna breed thise? Teloport? and i miss buzzingas old track and it dusent make sens!? i was exited but now am kinda sad
Its honestly harder to get common candelevra than rare candelevra on fire haven lol, but I got them both!
My heart wants to stop
Rare Spurrit is Monster Handler Tyson?
HUUUUHHHHHHHHH. HUH?!!!!!!??????????????????????
Yelmut  goes so hard on light island
King Gobbeyground Died

O homem disse eu eu gostei eu eu gostei tem novos monstros😮😮😮🎉🎉
No werdos :(
Another priceless reaction coming from MPG coming right up 🔥🔥🔥
Official trailer magpi and stoowarb and rare candelavra and rare spurrit
I love how They always giving full trailers AT MIDNIGHT cool thought
Crazy they added all of this today
This is gonna be epic
HOLYYYY
My man rare spurrit really destroyed ancient murals because he felt like it
Omg this is one of the most insane updates I’ve seen in this game it updates 4 islands tons of monsters and no one expected it 😭😭
Yeeeeeees sui
Big Blue Bubble try not to make an amazing update challenge (impossible)
It’s so annoying that you have to spend 150+ relics on each monster
Wait What THE MAGICAL ISLANDS WILL GET NEW MONSTERS!!
Okay but hear me out The Quints on the magical islands might be a hint towards where they are going on the DOF counterparts (so basically Bowhead goes to space, Tuskski goes to cloud and Gnarls goes to cave)
Devastated that fire oasis didn’t get a single new monster but this is so cool
у меня на канале уже есть обзор
I’m literally exploding rn
But will this new map never arrive?
Oooooo my gah
This is actually the most ambitious and crazy thing msm has ever done, and I’m hyped
Yelmut biting the pie is so cute
MAH BOI'S ON PSYCHIC ISLAND, YEAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
EXCUSE ME!? Quads and quints om magical islands :00
I’m quite confused but happy
What ia that Monster in The stars of game dona-do-do-do-do make The Monster pls

no No NoO NO NO ÑŐ
AMAZING🤩🤩🤩🤩😍🤩😍
king gobble the 4th 0:44
People prepare to dai NOW!!!!!
ÆHHH--
I'm sorry WHAT!?!?!?!? THAT'S INSANE!!!!!!!
5 ELEMENTS ON FIRE ISLANDS?
That is so FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 this could be my favorite update and the sending is so funny  Happy Fire expansion AND..... HAPPY MONSTERING
This looks like it’s going to be one of the best MSM updates!
This makes no logical sense but it’s great. It just feels like a big fever dream 😂
I wish they added a new trumpet and a xylophone monster exclusive to composer island. I NEED more AND better composer songs.
YESSSSS
🥹increíble 😊
OH MY GOLLY GOODNE
Aww man I missed it :(
This was COMPLETELY unexpected!! Fire monsters on islands that don’t match all their elements is insane, and I’m excited to see how they all sound!
OMgGgGG fires on magical ISLANDS!!!!!THIS IS GONNA BE ONE OF THE bEST UPDATES YET!!😍😍😍😍
THAT IS FANTASTIC
MSM DOESNT MISS WITH THESE UPDATESSSSS
I was not expecting this, I was hyped until I saw how to obtain the monsters, they’re too expensive, it would be better if they were like in amber island or for breeding, 😢 but nice change.
WHEN
🤯
I thoiught punkleton in dof was gonna be the most unbeleivable thing this year...     I take that back now
man, lots of news, thank you bbb, what a wonderful game aaaaa
W update 👍
Best update
Wait What happened to Rare Bona-Petite And Maggpi And Stoowarb on Fire haven? :Edit My singing monsters the update is not working on Mobile :Edit 2 im not playing until this gets fixed Please fox this
Bruh there's no Stoowarb or magpi on fire Haven
Ok fire quints and other quads on magical islands is neat . But where are more etheral workshop monsters ? Also did not expect yelmut on light island. It doesnt seem fitting at first for the calming nature of the song . Flum ox would have been a better option . The rest still fits. Tuskski and kirliby are fitting for farie island. Also 250 and 150 relics for qints and quads ? Who is supposed to have 2 k relics
507th comment
AHHHH I KNEE THEY WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST FIRE HAVEN
buying all the amber monsters?? this is crazy guys how do i get so many relics
This is probably the best seasonal  event we’ve had since april
Sure we're getting new Fire Monsters on these islands but WHEN ARE WE GETTING MIMIC???
suprrit  rare
That thousand yard stare from kayna tho
WHAT
suprrit
I LOVE THIS ISLAND SO MUCH
2:00 this face...
What's Happening? 🧐😂
So there will be six element monsters along with the new elements!?
Huzzaman was like hey boys I bought doughnuts
how would i be able to breed them
What are the breeding combinations for the new fire monsters on the magical and fire islands?
AWWWW THERES NO WERDOS IM SO SAD
Each update becomes more and more unexpected
MORE FIRES ON MAGICAL ISLANDS????
ARE THEY GONNA ACTUALLY REUSE THE QUINTS AND NEW QUADS, OMG I AM SO HYPED,
After years of waiting for team Cold to win on Fire Frontier (Psychic Island), I can't believe team Air and Earth won😡😡😡
i just chocked on my water
Fire monsters look very out of place on the magic islands, and are also boring to obtain, a simple purchase. It’s also impossible to build symmetry now, there are too many monsters and not enough space. I'm disappointed :( Option to fix it: make lost ancient vessels for fiery ones, to fill them you need some monsters from the island on which the vessels are located (analogous to Wubbox, which apparently won’t be added to magic ones)
The music of the islands of magic are so good, I’m afraid that the new monsters will ruin everything, on the other hand, we can see completely new unique monsters that have never been seen before
Light: drumidary, yelmut, and tiawa. Fairie: krillby, tusksi, pongpingf. Bone:  incisaur, gnarls, flum ox Psychic: bisonorous, edamimi, bowhead   Which leaves candellavra all alone
Man, the monsters from the Amber Island on the magical islands, very good, especially the Spurit and the rare Candelavra. The songs on the magical islands were already beautiful, now with more fire monsters, it will become an orchestra 🤩
This is how they can add Mimic to the game They can add Mimic by making them buyable for Relics on the Natural Islands  I'm calling it right now, this is going to happen
Why do i hear mimic, when they were caring gobbleygoard to the feast?
NO WAY
Hi
38 min gang 👇
YEEEEEEEEE
Teske’s on fairy island
finnaly some more monsters on the magical. who ever came with this idea at big blue bubble will guarantee get a employee of the month poster. i cant wait for it.
not that's too much
So who else wanting to see MPGs reaction to this
This is ok, I’m just going to throw everything I knew about my singing monsters out the window…
This is litteraly my dream amber island characters on different islands 100/10
OMG
Flum-Ox’s 😂
0:59 loved this phrase because of the tone
Eyyyyyy
The Fire Monsters went from having the outer islands invaded to now re-invading the magical islands back over again. Funny how that works.
Question: why noggins leave gobby gourd? Where did they up too? A. Buzzinga? B. Stoobwarb& maggpie? C. Fire wubbox?
What?🥵💀💀
I think that i never got só happy by an my singing monsters update
That’s wild. That’s so wild.
So does that mean in the magical islands the fire monsters will be in there
Well then. You could say this is fire🔥
THE BEST EVENT EVER
Where is the werdos? Are they going to add them on fire haven?
I have no words
This update is peak fiction
That's pretty awesome, when I saw the map I was hoping they went to one of the element islands Plant, Cold, Air, earth as well that would've been interesting
Interesting 😮😮😮😮😮
Noooooo ahhhhhhhhhh werdos noooooooooooooo ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
Spurrit confirmed glue eater
So like, when
iom so exited
with the new map being part of the trailer I think its finally coming in this update.
finaly
HUZZBAH, I just finished the magical islands
Fire haven ethereal?  Edit: the chances of epic wubbox is very slim because some monsters do not have their epic counterparts
WAIT SO BEN TWEETING ABOUT  A LEGO DRILL WAS A TEASER?!?
so you're telling me, fire expansion, is expanding all the amber island monsters (fire elements) *TO OTHER ISLANDS???*
The werdos did not get added Rare candelavra Fire quints and quads in magical islands Rare spurrit New map in the middle of the event
rare spurrit don't put it in your mouth thats poisonous
HELP HELP IM HAVING A HEART ATTACK I SWEAR TO GOT WATCHING THIS MY HEART WAS IN PAIN I DONT KNOW IF I NEED MEDICAL HELP OR IM JUST REALLY EXCITED I LITERALLY DID NOT EXPECT THIS OH MY GOD OK PLEASE SEND A AMBULANCE ITS HURTS MORE NOW PLEASE OH MY GOD IM SO HAPPY
no the old art so sad
kayna generally started tweakin
I wonder if we'll get newer magicals like Physic-Earth or Faerie-Air
To be honest, i myself didn't believe a lot in Maggpie and Stoowarb on Fire Haven, mostly because the Fire Islands (while having some similarities with the Natural Islands) they are their own thing, and also, Fire Haven and Fire Oasis are meant to be both halves of the same coin, so this would mean that we would need to repeat Werdos on Fire Oasis or make new ones, which... Ima be honest... Just nah
i wish rare wubbox on wublin island
Early
This is definitely one of the best updates of the year, y'all did an amazing job
Kayna in this trailer be like: someone is going to die tonight
Wow I'm soo hyped 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Poor Rare Spurrit, forced to be a slave fixing with Flum-Ox's glue
ok
I like the music at the beginning. It's so calm
?????? THIS IS FIRE BOTH LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY
i wonder what we have do to get these fire monsters on th maigcal islands
I don’t understand
I CANNOT BELIEVE IT
Yo what
So does that mean the other monsters will be added to the other islands to complete the 5 elements to breed or will they be transferred from one island to another or mean more waiting time to fill up the eggs?
Hrrmph
AINTNOWAY
Kayna freaking out over Rare Spurrit braking the wall and making him fix it was something I never knew I needed in my life   But all jokes aside, I'm pretty sure we can all agree this has to be the most unexpected update in MSM history
I am so confused
Fire expansion looks so good. I can't wait to see more fire monsters on other islands. Also, I like it when after Rare Spruit drilled through the cave painting, Kanya made him fix it.
HOW DO I GET THE GODAMN QUINTS/QUADS ON THOSE ISLANDS, I DO NOT KNOW FOR MY TINY BRAIN DOES NOT PERCEIVE A WAY TO GET THEM OTHER THAN BUYING THEM
The most unexpected thing ever.
OMG MORE MONSTERS ON MORE ISLAND
Yes!!! I'm excited for the monsters from Amber Island to come to other islands.
DUDE THIS IS THE BEST UPDATE OF ALL TIME
Wow, rare spurrit and candlarva? 3:31   New 5 and 4 elements on magical islands? 2:20  Maybe werdos on fire haven? CLUBBOX ON PLANT ISLAND??? 2:38  COULD THIS UPDATE BE BETTER???
😮🤩 Wha?! The Monster-Handlers can't be serious about the fire expansion!
The most insane update MSM team has done yet. Who would expect Quints on regular islands?!
gobbleygourd on amber when
and the monster that costs 250 relic or five elements in the fire haven does not have water but needs water
Now this, is epic
GHOSTYMPA WAS RIGHT
Why Was gobblygaurd eyeing the turkey?💀
Awesome!!!
More fire elementals in magical island
Glu Glu king
In Spurrit's trailer in the Fire Oasis he got mad at the Gobbleygourd, in the rare Spurrit trailer Kayna got mad at Spurrit.
OH MY GALVANA I NEVER EXPECTED ANYTHING LIKE THIS
The ending tho😂
so how is this mechanic gonna work?
Looks exciting! The monster selection on Light Island looks especially good- those guys could really spice the island up.
CHAT IS THIS REAL
New update
Rare Candelavra?! Rare Spurrit?! and the Fire Expansion?! I was NOT expecting that! This is gonna be fire, literally
2:01 they have commited to letting kayna have meme faces and i love it 2:24 ALSO ARE WE FINALLY GETTING A MAP UPDATE? Oh uhmm, its a rich people update,  I don't have that type of money, and I don't have a proper tribe (is just me), its okay I guess, no I'm not sad about a game, I'm gone, I'll just watch
finally my boy Ping-Pong get's some respect :)
I knew the new map would make it here!
WOW.
yes.
I love the update, I really really love it. But I havr one major issue, Why is Gobbley Man so ppulat n haven 😮.
THIS UPDATE IS REALLY FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥
spoilers:     gobbleygourd is not king and no one should treat them like it.
SOOO HYPE DUDE I ONLY DREAMED OF THOS
YO FIRE EXPANSION
Go boy gobble gaaaa
WHAT THE AHHHHH THATS SSO GOOD I CANT ANYMKRE THIS IS SO GYPE
Thanks My Singing Monsters for making my Birthday feel complete
MORE BOWHEAD RAAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHHH
omg
I don't even know what to say
wow  3:49 😄
WHAT ID GOING ON
Fire elementals on magical islands is crazy
when?
Fire Quints & Quads have been added to the Magical Islands & Fire Haven, and we got Rare Spurrit and Rare Candelavra.  But, with new elements to these islands, could we be seeing new magicals too?  Edit: Nope, they are bought with relics from the shop
Wait what??? Are all those fire elementals actually coming to the magical islands??? That’s insane
Rare Spurrit: *finds a way to bring Kayna's friends to other islands* Kayna: THAT WALL COSTED ME MILLIONS OF COINS YOU GREMLIN!
did you put all fires quads and quints un magical islands
Itzlegacy gonna have a field day with rare spurrit lol
O snap
BIGGEST UPDATE YET HOLY (Not YouTube friendly word)
BRUH IM SO HAPPY! THANK YOU SO MUCH....but how will that work?   I hope theirs no teleporting...but knowing them it probably is
I love and hate this update love we’re getting expanded songs but hate I have to destroy my whole island set up just to fit new monsters 😓 and not only that I have to spend who knows how many hours just to get the rares of the new monsters on Amber island all over again 😪 I just hope they give us a bigger island or more platforms on the side of the island but i know that’s not gonna happen sigh 😞
When is the update happening?
Maggpi and Stoowarb on Fire Haven, Fire Haven Colloss-eye, Rare Candelavra, Rare Spurrit and Rare Bona Petite.
So glad they didn't add werdos to haven, also... FIRE EXPANSION LOOKS SICK AS HECK
I freaken called it, I knew the relic in the hatchery is for bringing fire monsters in the island but never thought it would be an expansion. 🤯
This gotta be one of the most unexpected updates in the game's history. I'd never thought I'd see Gnarls on Bone Island
OH MY GOD THIS UPDATE IS JAM PACKED I HAVEN'T EVEN CHECKED THE GAME  Edit: guys tysm for 3 likes trust me nobody likes my comments
wait WHAT, this is so ffing cool! 🤯🔥
This was the most unexpected update I’ve ever seen in months. I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE UPDATE!!!
I love how MSM updates are either like "This update adds 27 new rares, 15 new epics, 8 islands, and a whole rework to basically every graphic in the game! And lets not forget the 17 NEW MYTHICALS!" or "Oh yeah the seasonal's here lol." Edit: Not complaining either way, I appreciate the work for either outcome
Huzzah!
THE MAGICAL ISLAND ARE QUINT ISLANDS NOW?? WHO NEEDS WERDOS OR FEASTEMBER JR WHEN YOU HAVE THIS! On a side note, this animation is so damn funny and good, ya'll animators need a raise
wow fire monsters on magical islands is something new
I wasn't expecting fire monsters exclusive to amber Island to be on added to other islands but I am excited!
Oh my god it ties back from years ago
what on earth was this trailer.
I was expecting the werdos on Fire haven, BUT QUINTS ON MAGICAL ISLAND WAS THE LAST THING I WAS EXPECTING 🤯🤯🤯
Wait what's going on im very confused are the other islands getting the monsters or something???
Who would've expected Quints on the Magical Islands?!
Gobbly king 🔥🔥🔥
More fire monsters coming to magical islands???
Thanks For Firehaven But I want you to get epic Colour
This entire video was bonkers!
The best
FIRE EXPANSION?!! AMAZING FIRE EXPANSION!!
Stoowarb and maggpi rare spurrit yay
OH MY GOD, I AM FREAKING OUT!!!
Oh. My. GOODNESS!! I was NOT expecting this “Fire Expansion” thing at ALL! This is perhaps the most hype thing this game has ever done! Y’all Monster Handlers really outdid yourselves this time!
Hi 👋 👇
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?
THE REMAINING MAGICAL ISLANDS WILL BE HUNTED DOWN AND COMPLETED
Amazing
I did not expect this
I LOVE WEDNESDAYS
I don’t even know what I just saw all I know is that it was awesome
Wow i can't believe all those fire monsters are going to the magical islands!
Must be something with Amber island and the Magical islands? IDK
UNEXPECTED THING.....
YO THIS TRAILER IS SICK
Holy cow!
Im curious how this will work!
For sure one of the best updates of all time, the Monster Handlers really smashed it with this one! Happy Monstering ❤
THIS IS AN AMAZING UPDATE
NO WAY MAN I DID NOT EXPECT THIS😭😭
There’s no way anyone predicted this omg
KAYNA DOING THE POMNI STARE
Caboo
That's a cool way to reuse those tracks from when the magic islands were fire islands lol
QUINTS ON FIRE/MAGICAL ISLANDS NO WAYYYYY
Literally no one could have seen this coming
Made an expansion and then rare spurrit had to fix the mural. Good.  Edit:2,450 relics to get all the fire monsters on their islands, 47,500 starpower to get all the rare fires on their islands, plus rare spurrit and rare bona petite. Rare spurrit limited time with rare bona petite obviously just available always. But for the common and rare fire monsters alone, 2,750 relics total and 47,500 starpower total. And only during feast-ember, not anytime other than that
Man I don’t think ANY OF US could’ve guessed this!!
OMG WE WERE ALL WRONG BUT THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER THEN WE THOUGHT
FIRE EXPANSION!
YOU CANNOT COMPREHEND MY ABSOLUTE SHOCK OF WHAT JUST HAPPENED OMGGGG
THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY OH MY GOD
