different honeys diff flavor profiles and reactions tho, 299 more experiments required .
That's the honey Winnie the pooh be eating
Remember when Yukihira Soma braised the meat he cooked?
Why are you guys so afraid of mold? Raw milk cheeses use mold and taste fantastic. And won’t make anyone sick.
damnn the music at 6:09 is dope!
Angel sound so much like a dumb kid, will he ever have a change of voice to become a man ?????
How come you always put salt and black pepper on every one of your steaks no matter what?
Skibidi
Please remake this video and remove the terrible screeching "music" . This is a MUTE required video.!
Loving your vids. Very clever cooking
Hi from New Zealand! Manuka honey is very potent from our native bush. It has incredible natural oils. Makes fantastic essential oils etc. very potent oils that are highly beneficial.  It’s so valuable supermarkets sometimes lock it up.  Farmers often bulldoze this tree as they think it’s “scrub”. Very sad clearing land
WHY WOULD YOU ADD ANY HEAT to this.  It’s a waste to lose is fresh flavor.  Cooking removes the natural sugars.
Guga that honey robbed you of the rest of your steak, like honey robbed, youtubers of the affiliate link commissions 😂
Are you from 🇧🇷 Brasil meu amigo?
try pomegranate molasses
The way this kid uses his fork really frustrates me 😂
Manuka is really common here in Ireland. I love it.
ive noticed it's almr become a pattern for the steaks to look weird on the bottom where it's in contact with the sheet tray, might be because it's not as ventilated and had moisture build up that messes with the way it dry age, i wonder if there's a solution to that like hang try the protein or skewer the meat and elevate it from the tray?
Maybe try a cream cheese dry aged steak? Feel like it might be very different from regular cheese
I like how Guga basically has an apology at the beginning explaining why, for once, his idea isn't bereft of culinary reasoning rather than Just being "interesting" or high-risk, high-reward sends for the culture.
Guga: I don't like to waste food  Also Guga: cuts 3/4 of the meat away after dry aging 😂😂😂
Grill marks, bud.
I'm disappointed you haven't done brown sugar
Try dry aged in curing salt mix
Meat and hot honey is delicious as a sauce
i love this channel
You say no waste with hello fresh but look at what you wasted with the meat don't get me wrong I love steak but I don't waste anything we eat all the blessings of food
Ello DO YOU GUYS DRY AGE STEAK IN HONE-
I love the relationship of Guga with Angel. It reminds me of my own nephew relentionship.
Try sodium bicarbonate
"I dry-aged steak in mush made from dry-aging steak in honey"
Dry age Leo
Dry age a Steak in Coke?
let's see how that works and the Honey will be cheaper cuz I know you pay money for that honey cuz I use it and they use that honey that you did use on babies and Nick use could help some heal quicker
a tub of Loca honey submerge your meat in that honey for 31 days in the refrigerator be different be less messy and just see how that comes out I'm betting that you won't have a lot of waste
next time get a tub of regular honey local honey
Dry age steak in steak
Ugh I’m so sad being allergic to honey is bogus. 😢
DO YOU GUYS, DRY AGE STEAK, IN HONE-
"For todays experiment, i dry aged a steak in honey...do you guys dry age steak in honey?  I SAID: DO YOU GUYS DRY AGE STEAK-"
Good Job Guga ! , I cannot belive how old this video is thou . Just to add Manuka honey is extermely expensive ... It is used in naturual healing products ect ..... Here in south africa Manuka honey will set you back like 1`000 zar or 60 USD for a tiny little jar .
2:55 The way it looks I would never try to eat that thing.
Manuka honey is liquid gold every one should try it when you have a sore throat 😘
Honey is best for preservation
dryage angel in brusselsprouts when?
the enzyme found in many tenderizers, Protease, is also found in your small intestine to help break down proteins.  more specifically, in the duodernum.
The idea of eating rotten, decayed flesh….yuck! Mother Nature makes it stink to keep you away from it
Never heard of Manuka honey? It is the BEST honey
Next, I would like to see you draw age steak in squid ink
Is it just me or when Guga does commentary /describes the video, it’s very satisfying to listen to. 😂 Low and slow and asmr like
You may be rich; but you're not dry-ageing a Wagyu steak in Manuka honey and then trimming off 75% of it rich.
1:47 🇹🇼 🇬🇷 🇹🇼🇬🇷🇮🇱
Guga can you dry aged skittles with steak
That looks good
Should’ve seared the second control steak with honey butter 😢
I really enjoy your videos, but unfortunately I have to "Don't recommend this channel" you because YouTubes algorithms are so horrible I get like 20 of your videos popping up in my feed every time I log on... They really need to fix that so you and other channels like you don't suffer from it.
Why not try putting the honey-dry-aged beef in a dry-age bag too? Maybe it’ll cure the meat better. And also like put way less honey on it. Natural enzymes as tenderizer doesn’t need to be a lot to make it work. A little amount goes a long way.
Manuka honey is expensive 💰💰💰💰💷💷💷💷
How LITTLE do you end up with after dry aging meat?!
I think honey makes a better condiment for meat.
Best Honey is Buckwheat honey.
check out the medicinal uses for manuka!
Careful with Manuka honey. It's tasty, but it's a huge scam in a lot of ways. It has a ton of pretty much unsubstantiated health benefits, and as a result a huge industry has sprung up around it. The thing is, it's just the byproduct of bees in New Zealand getting their polled from Manuka trees, which are actually not that great for the bees, like given other sources of pollen, they'll choose Manuka last. So they produce less manuka honey than they would given the same amount of other pollens. As a result, the bees are less healthy and those who make manuka honey kill a lot of the alternative pollen producing plants around their hives. Anyway, this has really become an exploited industry, a pretty large chunk, easily half, of the manuka honey you buy is fake or watered down with syrups or other honey. It's become a huge hassle for smuggling in New Zealand, and it's heavily counterfeited in Asia as part of their alternative medicine market. Basically, be careful to make sure you get the real thing, and also know that you might be contributing to ecosystem damage of plants in New Zealand.
Guga $1 steak dry age in honey
Hey guys you should dry age a steak in sugar see how that works lol
So if I do the honey with the seal bag I can increase the salvageable amount, this will be fun to figure out lol
It can be used as preservative
Dry aged in Wagyu butter
Hah. Mix honey with Gugas rub and do it again? 🤷🏻‍♂️
do a mango dry age
Good day Uncle Guga... I know this honey experiment was a sticky nightmare.... but, have you ever thought of experimenting with molasses? Dark, smoky and perhaps you will help us find out..
Dry age is unforgivably wasteful to meat.
Maybe you should have tried black truffle honey.
Hi to Guga and followers here in South Africa we get marmite o boveril but if you get this marmite in the us try my favorite thing when you guys do a BBQ maple syrup and marmite mix together in a steel bowl and use it as a mopping sauce for any kind of meat you will be amazed of the taste or use as a marinade Brilliant you wont be dissapointed
I am a little confused by "dry aging" in a liquid.
Mellified Steak
I grew up in a village in Poland, we had a farm and alot of steaks but nobody liked it when they have red on the meat and nobody would eat it this way.. then I watched how proffesionals make steaks and they are always medium rare and always look raw and if I would show it to my grandparents and people in the village they would literally call it raw and wouldnt eat it just wanted to point it out maybe its interesting for you haha, have a nice day <3
Who immediately thought of Food-Wars?🙋
Now I want to see Dry Aged In Maple Syrup vs Dry Aged In Maple Butter vs Dry Aged in Brown Butter.
try kiwi fruit also :)
I dry aged steaks in my own semen and this happened.
Honey is usually used to tender the meat of wild animals or hunted animals and in the process it helps to eliminate strong odors in the meat due to the bones
Not surprised it doesn't have the dry aged flavor. Honey is supposed to preserve stuff right? Like along with drying, smoking, and curing, honey was an old method for preserving food before we had fridges and freezers. so it probably way slowed down a lot of the, well, aging.
Dont Starve recipe
I was Absolutely wondering about what Honey would do can’t believe I just now found this video ❤vnit🎉
GUGA, YOU SHOULD DRY AGE SOME STEAKS IN CHOCOLATE, 2 OR 3 TIPES, LIKE WHITE, DARK & MILK CHOCOLATE, WOULD BE AWESOME TO SEE!
Next experiment: I dry aged steak in 💩.
Honey is an incredible preservative. It was used by ancient Egyptians to mummify bodies that are still relatively well preserved to this day, thousands of years later.
The fact that I don’t eat meat but watch this experiment videos 😅 please dry age some veggies too 😂
Try this with pork or boar and instead of grilling, use a pan and deglaze it with applemead or cider!
Did you guys dry age steak in honey?
After watching a few of your videos, and then some, it's obvious that the honey marinade was left in there too long.  Keep up the great content!
You 100% shouldve put on garlic powder. Garlic honey is amazing, and the only sweet thing I can tolerate with a steak
Who else came from that one issacwhy prank call video where Yumi did the amazing Guga impression
my thoughts; you cant get younger and fresher cattle than bull semen, he should try to dry age it in bull cum to catch the very essence of the steak. sounds like i'm joking.. i am not, goat testicles are good eating.
If he was my friend i would be obeser than niko avocado
Let’s get one thing straight. “Regular” honey isn’t runny. Unless you’re taking about the processed honey you find everywhere. Unprocessed honey is only runny at rather high temperatures. If you can get unprocessed honey, it’s effectively a disinfectant and anti bacterial agent. It can even be used to treat wounds. Edit. I use honey a lot on all kinds of meat, but for a steak I take a dry aged one and put it in a bag with honey and some herbs for a day or two.
Waiting for the "I DRY AGED Steaks in Yellow Cake and this happened."
The bees actually remove moisture/water from honey, they would love too use a dry ager
Real honey never go bad, archaeologists have tasted 2000 year old jars of honey found in Egyptian tombs said, it tastes just like regular honey. Honey is preservative.
Wait, how do you split a 3-rib roast in half.
dryeage it before you put it in the honey and then it might ripen.
He can't say mold he says mode
i usually picked out GREEN steaks but I guess they wont let you show that on your channel?
Oh yeah Soma from Food Wars used honey to soften beef for beef bourguignon.
I love how seriously the grilling footage is taken
To prevent the hpmey from dripping, melt the honey, then thonghlu the strak in the hiney, then dry age it.
sorry but real honey does not look like that. I harvest my own wild honey.
honey+vac bag
Ok, man, I haven't finished the video, but Manuka is known for medicinal properties, not cooking or flavor.
I just started working for a factory that makes and bottles honey, including manukas. It's super interesting to work with all these different honey's.
i wish we had hello fresh in my country...
Should've used more honey to cover everything better.
you think of honey very narrowly. in many if not most places of world, a natural honey is smth like this, instead of transoerent sugary syrup.
I learned that Honey does that to meat trough the anime Food Wars.
Guga has the best happy food face.
Why the honey looks like this bro...wtf happened
Bit os it "dry-aging" if you put moost stuff in it? The honey contains water and itnis hygroscopic. I am no expert, but I guess the whole point in *dry* aging is, that you add no moisture whatsoever. So I guess this was more of a honey marinade.
Bro guga's eyes were watering when he smelled the steak 😂10:30
Guga that honey you got from New Zealand actually also has natural antibiotics in it. We got it for my daughter before and it works great.
Who here came from IssacWhy?
In the words of some famous guy "oh, this is pretty ni- HOONNEEYYY"
I dry aged steaks and THIS happened!  *Everyone enjoyed eating it.
you, the meat guy, ungle rogers and other youtube chefs simply arent legit. people tasting your food are friends or family lmao no actual test nothing. silly mistakes that even home chefs don't make, jaushua wisseman is a chef, not you and the others mentioned here
expensive maduka honey dry age
That's not honey...
why not dip it in wax after you cover it in butter?
Dry age steak coated in steak juice
Atleast its not peanut oil xD
i live in new Zealand and manuka honey is amazing
Does anybody know the music that starts at 5:48 ?  Cuz i really love it!
10:30
that honey on the spoon looks like a phat dab!!
I'm a beekeeper, I sympathize with the everything being sticky problem, lol
"honey, where's the steaks?"
So i got a prank call a few months back...
Need to try this with that reaction.
Bro shoulda got the honey which was made from bee’s who make their honey from rotting flesh, and dry age the meat in meat honey
When your honey looks like marmelade...you know you have a problem.
Can you please dry age a fish and a chicken
can you do corn syrup?
manuka honey is staple here in nz and it is so so good
i just now realized they havent been just eating steak outside everyday
Almost looks like carmel.
Have you never eaten something that was cured in honey  Honey roasted, honey dry aged, honey, honey, honey is just good for a lot of things;
Manuka Honey, one of the best world honeys deserves one of the best world meats - Wagyu A5. So...?
I want to see him dry age steak in the chew version of beef Jerky
You're just ruining food bu burying it in random chemicals.  Some of us work for a living.
I have never seen a man so emotional over meat other than his own...
I bet those pellicles and bones could make some great bone broth
Ayooo Guga 10:30 💀
I wonder if using another honey with pasteurization would stop that extra funk from settling in the bones
Going back into the Guga’s older vids and seeing him with hair shows you how well he pulls off being bald. He’s the new Mr. Clean, he owns that shaved head now!!
FYI YOU HAVE TO INJECT THE HONEY IN THE STEAK FOR MORE TENDER meat 😊
You should get the sesame steak sauce that's available in Canada and do an experiment with that
SOOOO much good meat was wasted with these dry ages. I’d rather just cut and perfectly cook the meat
Guga. You can get a sold. Sold marinade, in just 2 hours just by adding in some honey. Six is over doing it. Honey on stake is a win. You want a summer bayou feel. Add some squeeze orange juice with lime and just pepper and salt. After you dry age. Top with caramelized onions. There is the real winner.
I recommend doing the steak in honey as an overnight set. Fresh minced garlic and onions are a good addition. Salt and pepper as well. It turns a cheap steak into an amazing steak. It'll make a round steak as tender as a sirloin.
That would be great honey most things from new Zealand and Australia is very high quality
im never using honey on my meat again... tried it once  and my sex lifes ruined forever and my wife left me..
The honey is antibacterial which means it didn't get to allow the meat to aquire the correct microfauna for againg.
I was fully expecting this video to be sponsored by honey
This video shoulda been sponsored by honey just for the memes lol
doesnt count. u missed a spot
Guga curated Hello Fresh meals, when? 👀
Guga why does the bottle look the same as the one you sell.......
some are soft some are hard but all of them are sticky
Imma do it for sure
Seems every time you dry age something with a bone in it the bone turn bad and green
from new zealand, find it so strange how you had never heard of manuka honey loll
Excellent choice of honey, it is one of our national treasures and I loved seeing you enjoy the spreading process even if the experiment did not work out! It makes an excellent sauce or short term marinade too
You can tell the difference in the steaks straight away the honey one is redder then the other dry aged .
I thought everyone put a bit of honey in their steaks.
Manuka honey is actually used medically for wounds
I wonder if the preservative and antibacterial properties of honey was at play here.......hindered the dry aging.
Guga + Honey = Winnie the Pooh
I wonder if you used the physhodelic honey from Tibet what it would do...... It might put you on a new plane of thought!
Honey is a natural preservative, this is the reason it did not dry.😊
😘 Honeyy Steak yummiest 😘😘😘 I do honeyy salmon dry age (just 15 minutes) hype yummiest and Creamy
searing looks like the Talhami's approach, only difference is that the Talhami flips the steak in such way that it makes a checker charcoal marks, I prefer Talhami's technique.
with how much guga enjoys spreading foods on steaks, he should try frosting a cake sometime
Guy on the left is a complete NPC Ive seen people on shrooms with more coherent and eloquent thoughts
During medieval time, they used to age meat in other animal's stomach
Dry-Aged Wagyu?
Honey is basically saliva of Bees, of course it breaks it down
Man this younger dude is so stupid, where's the description guy?
Yo you should dry age your dry age machine and then dry age a steak in that.
Guga try dry-aging a stake with mad honey! The results are going to be very interesting
Guga has too much knowledge in food not to have his own restaurant. I would love to try his foood.
I  dry aged steaks in  Curry powder and it tasted really good u should try it too
Only thing that sucks about dry ageing is the loss of meat, we cut off so much xD i cry every time
Do you guys dry age steak in honey?
10:28 has me laughing so much another amazing video
Well, a show about people eating steaks. 😵‍💫 thanks for the honey trick
70 days
I used to use manuka honey in my teas as a kid
why not put the honey in a big container then put the meat inside of that? hmmmmmmmmmm...
Try molasses
Dry age im balsamic vinegar (thick)
Su v a steak in a balloon
so much for anti food wastage, then proceed to throw 2/3 of a steak away
Experiment idea!! Dry age dab steak
You can also coat meat with just regular honey with less enzymes, and let it dry in sunlight, or smoke it. Honey never goes bad, and is a natural antibiotic. Before salt became popular, our ancient ancestors used honey to preserve meat. It's especially good for preserving salmon, but not if there are bears around. They will be drawn to your salmon.
This guys gonna poison his self are someone else with rotten meat
When u dry age it in amber?
You said the word “meat” 106 times
Next video: "I Dry-aged steaks in uranium shards."
..................try it with pure, 100% Vermont Maple Syrup please..........!
Do a tommahawk no sticky fingers lol
I learned about honey tenderizing meat through shokugeki 😤
Runny honey = fake honey in most cases. I am glad you bought the real deal. This is how honey should look like
Fantastic Maori pronunciation Guga!
Can we vote for new taste testers
Let me question something do you know where you will go after you die? If not let me say you can have a choice to either go to hell or heaven see 2000 years ago there was this man named Jesus who died on the cross for our sins and rose alive 3 days later all because he truly loved us he died for us so I question you now do you truly believe in Jesus or do you live for the world turn to Jesus Christ trust in him Christ has way much more to give than the world he loves us turn to Christ!
I think you are missing some tools
try it with the bees wax that could be interesting
wtf with the music are you cooking or finding the ancient library of atlantis
How lucky for him to eat better then the rest of us......
Need to mix honey and yogurt and try that
Cannibals were the first to use fruits and meat 🥩 🍍, humans were far easier to eat 😉
Manuka honey is the best honey u can get I can't believe you dont know about manuka honey
I dry aged a dry ager
Wow, this channel is extremely addictive :)
Learned this in food wars.
The cooking scenes are always so cool and cinematic
Hello Fresh is a massive trash producer. you shouldn't order from Hello Fresh, just buy things yourself really fresh
Reverse sear in honey
135 degrees? You monster!
Re run the experiment but add some pepper to the honey 🤤
Why bot put it in the vacuum seal bag with the honey?
Try coating in penicillin rockefeller
Rare steak? Yuk
Ha guga I wanted to meet you but I can't afford a ticket to Mimi .I wish to meet you. The best YouTuber in the world.
So nice to see someone actually salt the meat! I know those steaks are good!
As a beekeeper I gotta tell you that stickiness is on everything once you actually make honey. You get used to it.  This whole experiment was expensive wasn’t it?
Angle looks like 69 lol
This is so unique because honey is a natural antiseptic!
My honey is runny when it's sunny.
Raw honey or pasteurized? Living honey or dead in other words.
Of course this guy has never heard of Manuka honey. The constant meat has fucked his brain up.
why not dry age in dark chocolate, not the sweet one, just mostly cocoa and cocoa butter. and perhaps just cocoa butter.
You should cook your meal after the flame is gone wait less chances to get cancer, plus u will have more btu
listening to this absolutely hurts my ears🤣
You haven’t done dry-age with caramel
Seems like a complete waste of meat tbh
Dry age a steak and then after cutting out the steaks, coat them in honey for 24 hours. so then you get the best of both.???
You should try PNW Buckwheat honey!  Very unique (U love it or hate it!!!) and it crystallizes easily which would keep the oxygen out! Thanks for the vids!
Either way. I wish he would age BOTH under a vacuum seal. But then again, I never knew about dry aging be for i saw your vids. Thanks.
Cover in honey and then vacuum seal in a dry age bag?
Manuka honey is also used for medicinal purposes. Thank you sir, for helping me find a way to eat steak for medicinal purposes.
vegans watching in horror
could incorporate honey into marinades to tenderize meat
You are talking - steake is getting cold....
thats not honey
the fact that i knew the fact about pineapple and honey tenderizing meat after watching food wars is insane
24h honey marinade sounds delicious 😋🤤🤤🤤
I remember Yukimura used Honey to tenderize the meat faster.
I want a uncle like this guy he a fool lmaooo. Let's doo it
Try Manuka UMF 20+. :)
nice steak lil bro
the music and narration makes it sound like a documentary
13:33 im DEAD 💀
That steaks looks like rtx minecraft
Remember they found chicken in honey in tuts tomb
Hey Guga, you should dry age a steak in some ranch dressing!
I would use rubber gloves and spread the honey over the steak with my hands.  I'm going to try this!
Guga sounds like a Brazilian Tom Hanks
Yukihira Soma wants to learn your location
I wonder if it would be easier/work better if you put the steak in the dry age bag with the honey
Without offence, this is the worst honey I have ever seen.
Dont get me wrong, I'm all fine with the dry-aging experiments, foodcraft at its finest! :) But this one was disgusting. Honey is a no-go in terms of proper human nutrition and you certainly dont wanna dry-age your meat by coating it with another animals vomit. Or would you use some freshly ruminated grass for the same purpose? Dont think so. The day I learned how honey production works was the same day my addiction for honey mustard flavors  came to a sudden end.
knk çok boş yapıyon yapma
these videos relax me
Dry age in chocolate
My prediction: the problem was that he didn’t vacuum seal it in a dry age bag. He basically covered it in honey and left it in the fridge, so I’m guessing that there was a little bit of rot
Should dry age with canna butter
How many of you frickin weebs came here because of zero two
Why in the hell  u wanna f@ck up an expansive meat with honey🤮
How much gain do you want on your mic? Guga : yes
Winnie the poo is being jelous rn
food wars fans where u at?
How about dry aging a steak in pickle juice
I wish I could try everything he makes it looks so good
"Some are soft, others are hard, but all of them are sticky" idk man that kinda sounds like something else
Dry age in coffee
Cheers every bady
My husband's a beekeeper 🤦🏻🥴  everything's always sticky ☠️
Masya Allah..dedicated video..awesome..
A bit scary with the green on the bone. I wonder if it was the honey.
DO YOU GUYS DRY AGED STEAK IN HONEY
Have you ever tried dry aging in peanut butter?
4 million subscribers can afford that much Manuka honey for one steak. For others, that's a week's rent!
why does it sound like a horror movie
plot twist: carbonated pee
Sorry bro but green papaya works even faster than pineapple and doesn't leave a taste like pineapple.
Why did the honey took out the nutty taste of dry age tho? And also the neutralizing thing they said? Any scientists here?
You should do one with chamoy hot sauce!
Thank you
i actually learned that you could do this with steak from an anime called food wars and trust me if you love food guga you gotta check this out
Native Sri Lankans do this using natural honey
I know I can’t be the only stoner chef that saw that honey and thought it looked like beautiful concentrate
Kinda disappointed that this video wasn’t sponsored by honey
My family in New Zealand makes Manuka Honey on our sheep and beef farm, it used to be cheap. As children we used to eat it all the time. It's got quite a medicinal flavour. About 10-15 years ago it all changed when it came to everyone's knowledge that it has amazing antibacterial characteristics and is well suited to wound healing. So naturally the price went through the roof.
You should try dry aging with condensed grape juice aka Pekmez. Its amazing.
Want fresh  honey  straight from the hive?
Having binged Guga for two days, I've learnt one thing: Guga does not know what 'half' means.
I’d combine the two methods and see what happens
Well done 🤮👎
Can you do a honey and lime zest dry age?
What about making dry aged Jerky, grinding it to a powder, and marinating the steaks in steak?
Such a waste of beef.
look like 6ix9ine
Why is honey, ginger, and marijuana the answer to all life’s problems? I swear they are miracle cures to everything. …even steak!
Why don't you dryage coated meats in the bag as well, I suspect that might preserve the meat better so you don't have to waste so much.
i always love seeing how serious guga gets when he starts grilling
food from a box is a scam
honey full of sugaar
7:04 - Thats good Iced Tea. Raspberry is my fav. I love that stuff over Ice
Next episode: I dry aged steak in FRUIT.
Dude how do you not have common knowledge on so much stuff? Love the channel bc it’s entertaining… but damn hopefully you are trying to dumb it down.
Try submerging the steaks completely, next time, so that none of the honey can drip off and leave it exposed to the air
Boa Gustavão, parabens pelo trabalho!
Ever try Frosting?? What about Cream Cheese? I wonder how a buttercream dry aged or fondant would be?  Thanks so much for the vids!!
These dry-aging experiments are very informative. Thanks!
What if you freeze dried the honey first?
Next episode: I dry aged steak in 💩
Dry Age Steak in Freeze dried Dry aged powered steak
DO YOU GUYS DRY AGE STEAK IN HONEY
Manuka honey is definitely one of the most unique-tasting honeys out there.
Costliest honey manuka honey
I learned that honey can tenderize meat from this anime: Food Wars (Shokugeki no Shouma). In one episode, the main characters didn't have good quality meat so they used honey as marinate to soften it. Haven't personally tried it yet, but I believe it lol
Maybe you should have only done one day one week and two weeks because maybe the amount of enzymes and the maluka honey were too strong for the meat so since it was so strong you should have done it for less time
Conclusion ... "K.I.S.S."   ...Keep It Simple Stupid
Let the steak rest at least 15 minutes in tin foil, before cutting! And turn it halfway!
The thing about honey too, it has antibacterial qualities, so much so that if stored properly can last 10,000+ years.
Gugu, to make it a quicker way of coating the meat in honey you should put the honey in a bowl and microwave it to make it a more liquid base then you can actually put the steak in the bag and pour then honey in then basically just rub it down to cover all areas of the steak. Less messy and less work
be aware of manuka honey, if you eat just a few tablespoons of this special honey alone, it could cause hallucinations, similar to what you get after consuming LSD
What is the knife he uses in all these videos?
*Day 69 (😩) of me asking you to dry-age human flesh.*
@Gugafoods I was your 100,000th like!!!
Is this a don't starve reference???
god dayum
Its from new Zealand
This was a very, very expensive experiment...
I'm actually more used to creamy honey instead of the syrupy kind since it's more often the one I find in stores here.
Waste of meat
If you inject the meat with liquid honey and dry age it. Will it be better?
Food wars reference
I feel like in today's age, dry aging is food waste
Why don’t you put the honey steak in the dry aged bag ?
Honey in meatloaf
Wow. So much plastic waste from that hello fresh
funny thing, I learned this from an anime
So next time submerge the roast good old farm honey.
Chef can you please dry age the same cut in honey and your guga b.o.g
You should have used the psychedelic mountain honey.
hui
Shokugeki no souma taught me about the honey trick
I would enjoy it if you would tell us how much do you think a steak like that would have sold for in a steakhouse
What do you do with all this offcut? Can you use it for anything or does it have to go to waste?
Guga is giving me extreme Winnie the Pooh vibes
One thing to be careful of, DO NOT USE RAW HONEY FOR DRY AGING, raw honey contains botulism spores, this is the primary reason raw honey is never recomended to give to infants or small children.   An adult can get poisoned and get to the hospital with hopes of recovery, an infant will not survive.
Are you going to cook it or let it moo
Try being a beekeeper...you get sticky EVERYWHERE!
anyone knows the background music please 😥
I got the best honey on earth brother, from ga, u can freeze it, and it comes out the bottle like toothpaste,  brand new frames, 2 weeks in the swamp, in the air above the river in tupelo trees, light green gold, it only grows in enough capacity in certain areas on the river to make pure tupelo honey, 99% of other folks dont know how to do all the procedures correctly,  but i know 1 , 60$ a pint!.
Is it still dry ageing if you're using liquid to do so?
The stoners know we see something else than honey... There's some... Wax.... That looks exactly like that... And tbh.... Wax dry aged steak...? THC steak???
Cooked honey creates carcinogenic molecules as they heat up as much as this had to be to be cooked…. Kinda dangerous
Guga try to Dry Age with honey in the dry age bag . less honey cuz will take too much flavor in 35 days.... tks i really wanna know what is coming out . cheers
That green pepper
Manuka honey has heavy use in burn centers and wound repair, it is highly anti bacterial.  All honey does to various extents, so this is foolish to use Manuka. You wasted all that honey meat, it was fine, and could all have been cooked except the smallest trims. Likely coating the beef in lard would have been better and easier as long as placed in the proper aging fridge.
DO YOU GUYYSSSSSS DRY AGE STEAK IN HONEY
Guga’s face when he smelt the second steak was just hilarious
*DO YOU GUUUUYS* *DRY AGE STEAK* *IN HONE-*
I would’ve melted the honey and repeatedly dipped it Like a candle
Please dry age your steak and then do the honey over top of that…see if it gives a little something extra?
Thank you for the great content, you should dry age a steak in rosemary and garlic with a butter binder.

Dry age a steak in semen

Dry age in sriracha Plzz 🔥🏜️
Honey is actually a natural antibiotic of sort. So it will prevent the meat from spoiling for sure. And it goes along very well with chilli on meat. So this is actually a great idea.
I happen to have a lot of manuka honey on me and I'm already getting ready to dry age the steak inside of this honey. I'm excited to see how I'll find it tasting.
Not expensive at all !!!
Honey on meat is great
👀
Im going to tell you i love your videos and I am soooo jealous of your job eat the best meat you ever tried everyday yall are awsome!
That honey has antibiotics properties wich stopped allot of the bacteria from creating that funky smell even after dry aging it .

HAhaaa..  his voice is so funny! That large piece of meat wasted down to a bite size slider,,,lol
I've never learned to listen to my nose 🤥
"but it is ☝️🌚 " should've been a meme
Any person who watched Shokugeki no Soma knows about honey as tenderizer.  Fellow weebs! What is our profession!?
Thanks for not chatting about shaving fkn disgusting balls and using ball spray this time (that degenerate manscaping gross shi*)
Turks marinade meat in yogurt and milk.
Manuka honey is a scam. It is exactly the same as regular honey - all the claims about it are marketing bullsh*t. He could easily have found a standard honey with a similar consistency and had the same result.
12:24 When I talk about choking my chicken with people who didn't ask and now I'm not allowed at family reunions. 😒  Get over it aunt jeneene with that phat Azz of urs.
“Some are soft and some are hard but all of them are sticky”- that’s what she said 😜😜😜😂😂😂🤣🤣😂
Is it bad that I drooled while he added the honey
dry aging seems like there is a bit of wastage?
Where’s “dry aging steaks with liquid oxygen
Anyone know the specific song name for when he is cooking the steak?
Do you guys dry age steak in honey?
Fun fact the enzymes in pineapple are similar to the ones in your stomach that break down protein, so the pineapple eats you while you eat it
How big is a difference between normal meat and dry-aged meat?
What a waste
the problem is the added moisture in the honey does not allow it to dry. If you ever come back to this I suggest you try to cover the stake then put it in a dehydrator long enough to dry the honey on the outside but not the meat, then dry age it the way you usually do or perhaps try drying the honey itself until it's more like a very thick paste and try that. again the issue is you added moister which is INSIDE of the honey itself.
has to Be a better way it seems like you’re losing too much meat in the more you cut off the rest taste you have of that honey I would think
Calling Korean BBQ
Angel, that neck beard... its rough man!
Manuka and Tupelo are amazing! The flavor profiles are intense, but so are the prices and there is a difference between a brand that is manuka at $10 vs $25
I knew it would taste good cause food wars taught me well.
“DO YOU GUYS DRY AGE STEAK IN HONEY?!”
yep, pineapple has a digestive enzyme in it, that's why your mouth goes like sore if you eat the heart or too much of it... it actually eats you while you are doing the same.
Yumi knew what he was on about
Dude just casually talks about Manuka honey as if it’s not some of the most overpriced nonsense
is this sponsored by google or something
Lots of knives, very little grammar.
I have heard that the enzymes in papaya, mango, and pineapple are great meat tenderizers...
wasteful. feel bad for the cow. next time might aswell age it in poo
Goddamn you waste a lot of food. Just to have another steak out of half a cow. I mean, honestly dude.
Dry age a steak in mayonnaise
Remember that episode in the anime “Food wars”?
Who would have thought he would use the most ridiculously expensive honey.  Reminds me of those tik tok idiots using a whole wagyu beef tenderloin to make fried rice.
My mouth up here watering like a busted fire hydrant as he's cutting those steaks.
The amount of meat you waste is kind of f*cked up bro
The way you say you don’t like wasting food?!?! You literally waste 2 thirds of all the meat you have on your channel so don’t bullshit about not liking wasting food, if you didn’t like wasting food you wouldn’t be doing it in every video
"Emzynes"
You’re a genius. Your videos are awesome.
I know that honey can make the meat tender from anime. Thank you Food Wars (Shokugeki no Soma)
Beeswax would be good.
All the meat u got rid of would be really useful to give to a poor person that can't find something to eat for a while,  Aging food while some people can't find something to eat is just a waste in my opinion. Best regards
Do this again but with low enzyme honey.......... why did you want to speed up the breakdown process over a month and a half long drying.............................................................
Dry aged in Whey.. im curious.
i remember i took biology for the first 3 years of high school purely because i wanted to undrestand bio chemisty better so that i could cook better and protease just <333
Honey is also a natural preservative.
You need to be arrested for disrespecting cows after death
“There are over 300 types of honey!” Wait till you see apples guga…
Is this not something medieval people do?  Honey is a preserving agent. Medieval people has to sit through long sieges from enemy armies.
4:32 its the protease it breaks the protein so its tender as fu-

I was very surprised you didn’t vac pack the honey one as well. You started saying how good it smelt and I did wonder😂
Honey specialist will tell you that you should never use metal spoons to scoop your honey out of the bottle. It neutralizes a lot of the beneficial enzymes in your honey. wooden spoons work best.
Could you do this with a regular store bought Ribeye steak? Or would that be too small with potential meat waste from the process?
New Zealand honey is Goat
Have you ever tried cooking on a Himalayan salt block made for grilling. The video I saw , the block was heated in grilled for about70 minutes and the salt will come from the block. The block was slathered in butter. 8 to 7 min per side.
why not dry age honey in airproof bag like you do with standard steak?
Use regular honey next time
please stop.

Shame he did not reveal that manuka is the most expensive honey on the planet
Daging sapi pilihan yg lezat..disukai oleh byk org diberbagai negara
sooooo soma from food wars ( the anime) did this and its reason was specifically to make the cut tender enough to be make into stewed beef at a much faster time, i don't know the exact science myself but after watching this video it seems to me that its a pretty good idea.

Manuka honey is just dirty honey the bees have to much pollen in the honey stores and it gets muddy you can make manuka at home by buying bee pollen and mixing a few tablespoons in a jar of honey and whala manuka

I be surprise if you read this - I’m watching your fry age experiments. First you are like me, I love your experiments. I would like to ask, if you do your “fry age”, have you thought about doing a 3rd where you combine the bag and the ingredient using? I really be curious
Wow, looks yummy
very good and useful content for everyone
I think it became even more fun over time.
WTF 300 different type as in original different types or do the others just have added ingredients
Btw,  for a good tenderizer, try tomato sauce. I mainly use it on my briskets, but It works great on steaks as well.
I tried the honey thing. But two days later, and I still want to lick flowers...

When I lived in China, the area we lived in didn't really have beef. The 'beef' was actually water buffalo or ox

Lezatnya bikin saya ketagian
Niceee
Honey is a natural anti-microbial so it was probably suppressing all of the material that would normally give the dry aged meat that funky flavor. It does seem the Home he wasn’t able to keep its coating around the steak so there was some parts that went bad but if you were able to create a tight seal that retained it it would probably have come out perfectly preserved
why not eat the fat? :D
Waste too much meat
Steak yang sangat lezat!!!

Dry age in cashew nut butter.   Nutella and peanut butter dry age failed as it contains too much sugar. Try homemade or store bought cashew nut butter as cashew nut according to Google contains the most sodium naturally.
hi
Honey have the power to tenderize meat
I'm sorry mate but manuka honey isn't that colour the manuka tree the bees make it from produces a very dark coloured honey. Some countries have laws on the% of manuka honey in manuka honey others will let anything be called it lol
Just so you know, Manuka is antibacterial! (Thanks for saying it correctly!)
You get weird looking honey in America
I am allergic to bees but love honey. !!! Lol
In my country historians have discovered that our ancestors used honey to preserve meat! I bet other countries did too
Hey guga n angel ..🤙🏽 Guga u should try n dry age a steak with spice ...or like mixed spice UK it's been done with salt ......idk if it's possible to do it in oil 🤔🔥🙈🤯
you make good steaks
Manuka honey has healing properties so I see why this would work
hey Guga, this is a long shot. But supposing this message ever reaches you...  My husband is a huge fan of yours. like, hardcore, probably number 1 fan. And i was wondering if you could film a video saying "happy birthday, ____". I will pay you whatever you'd like. I don't know if you ever do stuff like that... and please forgive me for asking in the youtube comments section, i tried finding other ways of contacting you but alas this is the only one that i think could work.I just imagine the smile that would cross his face, and the laugh he would have if he ever saw that, and it makes me so happy. i think it would mean the world to him :D  Thank you, if you ever see this :)  God bless, i love your content!
Has anybody tried dry aging with dark chocolate? How does it turn out?
Holly molly you actually used the most expensive honey to dry age the beef
Hi Guga please use Georgian sparkling water “Borjomi” to marinade the steak 🍀🥩
Try and dry age a steak in a dry age cabinet
Could try Dry age half with the honey 15days et dry age with the regular method
Dry age with coconut oil!! Guga!
Honey is used to preserve,  not tenderize anything.  also choosing the cheapest jar of the most expensive honey in the world probably didnt help you that much either. a 19 dollar jar of Manuka honey when the norm is 50 and can even reach up to 450 usd.
How did it compare to ketchup?
Does it piss anyone else off how the second guy holds his fork??
sticky everywhere
Mellified meat!
whats with the intense music when cooking lol
i personally dont really see the overall benefit of dry ageing. the time it takes, the waste of food versus a good cut of meat and quality cook with zero waste. Maybe i'm a tree hugging tight arse, but i just couldnt bring myself to throw 50 bucks worth of honey on a steak and then cut half of the meat away.
Love the way he talks about not wasting food while trimming huge chunks of beef from aged steak
I don't know how I came across this channel but I absolutely love it. The production, the subject matter and the host is so wholesome.
The problem i have with store-bought yogurt is that its not the same as homemade natural yogurt, so which one would tenderize better?
That’s like $100 of Manuka honey. And about $100 worth of meat the way prices are.
Dry age in ranch dressing. Do ranch dressing next.
So no one gonna talk about the way homie holds his knife and fork?!😂
That's such a waste of good honey..
I’ve noticed with the dry aging, that things with the bones in often times have adverse reactions. Interesting…
Why his honey looks like butter?
Honey is an interesting food
The way he described the honey is unnecessary horny
Torce pra que time guga?
This process seems like it wastes a lot. I don't really understand how it doesn't all go bad and make you sick. I assume there's a science behind it.
What a waste.
He really be using gta mission music
If you warm the honey a little bit, it will become runny and you could have just poured it over without the mess. Then vacuum as you did the other one. 🤷‍♂️
If you could have kept some of the honey on it, they would have had a nice caramelised sweet surface surface.
Why didn't you vacuum seal the honey one too? I think it would have worked better.
did you put both into a bag?
I bet they taste amazing but it seems like a huge waste of meat.
RAW BEEF.
2:15 that's no real honey... wtf is that?¿?¿?¿? so gross
Obviously it’s not dry aging. Why bother watching?
Is Guga Samoan? Just curious.
what if you put the honey on the dry aged steaks for 24 hr. before serving. And ofcourse remove before grilling :D
Definitely don’t want my meat disintegrating or turning to mush
this dry aging method is approved by Winnie the pu
Put the meat with honey in a vacuum bag for a couple of days, much more effective.
never use metal spoon in Manuka honey
the honey from new zealand
It’s organic honey
Manuka Honey is really good for your health and also has a good taste 👌
How can it be "DRY" aged in a liquid?
So much waste....
i could kill an entire city do prove one slice of that final meat
As much as i like to watch those videos and i understand why they do that cuz i love food too on the other hand i have a hard time to conceive how much lost of food you need to do to get dry age meat almost half of the meat need to go to the garbage.
For someone like me who eat around 2$/meal everyday, I don't know why I watch this hard feeling video for.
how to waste food 101
Honey never goes bad and is a natural anti-biotic. It probably acted as a preservative for the meat which stopped it from developing the dry aged taste.
Kiwi, soy, garlic is my favorite tenderizer and flavor.
Honey is considered the perfect food it is antibacterial anti-fungal anti-microbial antiviral honey has more enzymes than any other food on the planet and honey it's now being used by every major burn center in the world to treat burns because it has reduced infections by nearly 100%, sped up the healing process as well as reducing scars.
Lol, first dry aged honey experiment  Said, hundreds of years into human history of dry aging foods of all kind in honey.  Next time, try keeping it entirely immersed in non pasteurized, loose filtered honey and leave in for a few months.   Guarantee you ain't ever gonna get meat like that from anyone not in the know.
I love emzynes
You SHOULD do a regular dry-age with honey all over it.
I think you dry aged the honey steak too long? I think if just marinate the honey steak for a couple of hours, it might’ve been better?
What are we doing to animals..
any way to not waste HALF the meat ? because I don't know if you know, but meat is expensive...
Need more honey buy a bucket., and not Manuka...
I’ve put raw honey on a steak 20 minutes before grilling  It turns out pretty good
awesome, free shipping on that hallofresh, shipping?? fresh food?
Manuka honey has so many amazing qualities it is literally a medicine
U forgot to finish cooking it
HOOOOOLEY F I have seen 1min40sec of the video and you bought 3JARS OF MANUKA? Holy crap dude that is going to be a expensive steak.
seems like a massive waste. dry aging in general. not just the honey version. but the honey version, especially. all the honey, wasted. half the meat, wasted. the bones, wasted.
then its NOT dry aged its wet aged
what kind of honey is that???? looks liek caramel
i cant, the voice over is creepy
makes me wonder why some of these experiments are setup to fail.  I feel he should have shortened the dry age with the honey.  The process doesn't always have to take 35 days...  Could have gotten the same result with a lot less waste and effort.
lets go bro from new zealand the honey got some in my kitchen i from nz
Bro I enjoy your videos. Very well done.

When u said in the beginning when you were spreading the honey u said it was "so soothing” now in the end u said it was a bad idea. Make up ur mind brother.
Oh i rly want to buy a piece of expensive meat, to wasting a big percent of it.
For God's sake, stop dry-age beef with honey, brown sugar, MM's, or blue-lollipops! The real BBQ is salt and nothing more!
2:45  am i the one who seeing a spot not covered with honey 😂😂😂
maybe try a white honey.  i use it for toast and tea and..,, well, just everything i want honey for 😅.  it’s just soooooo good.  good white honey almost looks like marshmallow paste  also considerably cheaper than the manuka honey,  something us peasants might be able to try
I'm pretty sure honey is wet
that was at least $100 in honey
not fully cooked disgusting
You could have trimmed that so much more efficiently. Also I'm pretty sure this would work better with an already cut steak for a shorter time period.
imaginate 35 dias de añejado para dejarlo crudo... que pena
Honey never spoils
At the end of the day was the dry age worth it
What if you could pressure dry age meat in honey steam
What's the point of covering it in honey and then just using the meat in the middle?

why not vacuum bag a steak in honey so you dont lose so much
I just started watching your videos yesterday and I’m eating honey bunches of oats right now and thought “I wonder if he’s done honey yet,” so I looked it up and here we are
heat the honey up a little bit to get it more runny, should help out a ton with applying it on the steak.
"strictly confectional"
Dry aging in honey is a logical decision, since honey (ESPECIALLY manuka) has anti-bacterial properties, so it will preserve the meat and add an amazing taste.
The thumbnail looks like a Holy Grease that you apply to your weapon from Elden Ring xD
I watched some And i have to say your steaks look tasty but arent you wasting a bunch of good meat by doin that? I mean all  parts you cut off
Honey is a preservative, the dry-aged process is retarded.
dry-age in bees wax!
''some are soft others are hard but all of them all sticky''  ah yes the best way to dry age a steak.
What brand are your knives?
Could not be the worlds first dry age with honey ... or there would not have been information on what would happen when he looked it up.
Dry age in sawdust of grill flavor woods: hickory, mesquite, and applewood!
It doesn't taste like dry age cuz it has natural anti bacterial anti fungal agents in it. It's more like an anti-dry age experiment.
10:30 my family when I ask them to try my first steak that’s both raw and overcooked somehow.
What if you dry age a steak regularly for like 3 weeks, then put the honey on and give it 3 more weeks?
I mean, it does make sense. Honey is made partly of bee saliva and it is the first stage of digestion. When you eat and you taste that slight sweet flavor that is the proteins and glucoses breaking down.
How have you never had Manuka honey
Its heart breaking to see so much of food waste .
Bruh the honey looks like thermal paste
I had a honey dry aged steak once at a restaurant in my city that does these experiments. It was delicious, one of those weird deliciousness's though where I loved it but also don't really want it ever again. Its a 'glad ive tried it' type thing for me
Why scrape the honey off if you are just going to cut off the sides and bones anyway?
What if you try the dry process with honey butter 🧈 🍯 using 2 to 1 measurements 2 parts butter 1 part honey . But us an aged honey. Honey that’s about 12 months old .
It has beefy flavor...... I mean it is beef....
Regular honey that is actually made by bees should never be runny at room temp... Manuka honey is absolutely fantastic though
I like that you do these experiments with blind participants, a lot of channels doing similar things neglect the blind, leaving a ton more room for bias
Dudes voice creeps  me out

Can you dry-age dry-age?
I'm pretty sure that honey is used in some medical practices.
why do you sound like this
Honey is also anti-microbial so it probably inhibited the dry ageing.
can you try something like honey and bear meat
Seems like a waste of good meat and good honey (one of the most expensive in the world). And too much salt.   There are recipes of meat/honey marinades in europe. I suspect all are far better than what was shown here.
you bought a manuka blend honey  which if your lucky will have about 20% manuka. Manuka honey comes from a certain type of bee found is a certain place in new Zealand.
seems like an awful lot of waste.  also, stop turning your steaks so much

I had a weird one for you to try. I'm very curious about ( and don't have the means to do it. ) What about dry aging a steak on a jam or jelly? Your choice of flavor!
you have no idea what you are doing. dry aged meat taste like crap when put in the fridge and also dry aged meat is not really 'dry' aged when you vacuum seal it. if you have that much loss from dry aging your meat you are doing something wrong.
You should dry age something in peanut butter
Honestly thought this man covered a steak in dabs

That was a really low quality manuka honey, try a 30+ quality next time, they don’t taste as good as lower levels, but they’re what you really wanted
Zero Two would love this
Honey is used as a meat preservative in my community.
Do the meat with regular dry ageing, but glaze it with honey when roasting, thats what u shouldve do it

Can you dip the whole thing inside honey? Is that a different process.
if you broil the steak a nice marinade is equal parts honey, soy sauce and Dijon mustard and just marinate the steak before you broil it
they keep saying "just do the regular dry age!" as if I can afford the steak to age at all.
Make a sauce made from pelicose scraps hot sauce and butter to fry age in
Is possible that this could work with $1 steaks?
I dry aged steaks up my own ass
U should dry age a steak in cinnamon pls  read this I'm rly curious
So the same effects the human body ?
That was intresting, I was looking up stuff for preserving food in honey since awhile back I had tried putting garlic cloves covered in honey in a mason jar. The longer it sat the more garlic flavor went into the honey, I'm curious what would happen with garlic infused honey. This video was cool I didn't even know u could do this with meat I might try eating more beef, Im picky about it for some reason lol.
Try peanut butter or do one with peanut butter whiskey
I have a request if that's okay! Could you dry age steak with  Whataburger's limited edition spicy ketchup sauce, please? ^^ I would  definitely love to observe if the steak becomes enhanced or not! Thank  you for reading! :D
interesting piece to this, honey is very antibacterial.  Things cant grow in honey, probably contributed to the meat being cleaner in the end
Dry-age a steak in brown sugar next
The fact that he said "this stuff is actually delicious" makes me worry about regular american honey I am from europe and I would say most honey is delicious, even the one from the supermarket but Ive been spoiled a bit because my granddad gets a ton of honey from a beekeeper and gifts it too us Is it actually bad or did I just missunderstand what he meant?
I would suggest trying wet aging (marinating) it in honey, then dry aging it.
mmmmmm
I got you add on this video lol
Angel-hit me up if you’re single!  Haha but seriously I do love the videos
The cook music made me think I was watching Doom videos all of a sudden
These experiments are such a waste of meat
all the goooooood manuka honey went to waste (sad). that kind of honey is very expensive, even a little 300g bottle cost 2 or 3 times of 1 kg of good quality regular honey
Why not try to dry age it in some🍃 honey?
That’s the ugliest honey I’ve ever seen
What up Manuka
For me in NZ Manuka honey is everyday honey lol
You tried dry aging in maple syrup yet Cho? (Nes Manga)
"you wanna do a lotta work and get sticky everywhere?" ..... maybe
For people like me that can’t eat too much sodium, what could I flavour a dry aged steak with?
5+ is definitely not the best you can find. I have a few 800+ and it goes even higher.
Guga: Brings two steaks to the table  Angel: *SUS*
"IM NOT DYING TODAY!" "I Dry aged this steak in RAT POISON!"
That honey looks like liquid gold 😍
Need to dry age in blended bugs.
honey cote it and then bag it, then age it, I wanna see that
The article said the honey contained something like hydrogen peroxide, which is an extremely powerful oxidizer, so it's no surprise that the meat was oxidized. Awesome videos man.
Next episode I dry aged a steak in THC wax
I bet dry aged in mustard would be good.
One of the farms in my town has a stand out front where you can shop from like 20 or 30 different types of honey. I don't know how the hell they manage to make that many different kinds but it's incredible, very interesting to taste the differences
I literally just ate until I was full but these videos get my mouth watering
What a waste of meat 😂
Shout out to New Zealand for the honey
Have you done it with mustard
He needs to stop telling the other guy which one is the experimental steak to remove bias.
Manuka honey?! Thats freaking expensive bro and you bought 3? Dang    That looks like the healthiest piece of steak lol   Kinda wasteful tho ya probably should have cut the meat up and marinated it just for a night
Honey is naturally antibiotic. So you won’t get that same dry age effect,
Guga is 69s cousin?
Thanks for using a new Zealand product. Can confirm manuka honey is awesome
try dry aged with indonesian sambals!
wow you get really much waste by dry aging. you start with a huge meat-block and only get some stakes out of it
Bro u should dry age in caramel
That dude kinda looks like 69 with all his tattoos & that crazy hair lmao
I'm starting to see a trend that the stuff that work most on dry aging steaks seems to have properties of being both a preservative, and a fermenter (or product of fermentation).
Next episode: i dry age steaks with my grandmas ashes
he looks like tekashi 69 with no flair.
If I'm not mistaken honey has antimicrobial properties. That's probably why it doesn't have that funk.
DRY AGE WITH SIRACHA!!!
"Some are soft, some are hard but all of them are sticky" 👀
Guga may try experiment of dry age 35 days with raspberry jam, peach jam, pineapple jam,
Youre awesome man.  Thank you for sharing all these amazing experimenta
35 days is too long. Two weeks is best
How about trying a beef bouillon paste?
Use gloves next time something is that sticky. Very easy way to avoid all the afterward stickyness?
Have you ever tried one of these experiments covering it in lets say honey and then putting it in a dry age bag and removing the air, would that change the process
No need to enclose the honey covered even in a Tupperware ? Just open air in the fridge?
Listen to your nose... processed to cook them even when it smelled bad lol
1 steak 😂
Shout out to New Zealand and our epic Makuka honey <3
Imagine if he cut the steak in half and a bunch of bees start to emerge
Manuka honey does NOT “have more enzymes” than other 100% raw honey. What RIDICULOUS NONSENSE. The enzymes in honey come from the digestive system of the European honey bee and no bee processes honey differently than any other bee. The only difference is the price. Don’t spread such dumbassery, Guga.
I don't know anything about cooking or grilling or steaks so please excuse me. A friend was watching this with me and said "If you salt your meat that much before you cook it, the salt will strip the moisture out of the meat and make it very dry. You should lightly salt and cook immediately, then season the meat to taste while eating." Is this true? Guga seems like he knows what he's doing and he really enjoys the steaks he cooks.
How are you so unable to use a fork 😂 nice vid though
Put the honey in an icing bag and pipe it on.
watch in 1.5x , like watching horror story/
The hardest part of doing this is waiting 35 days lmao

sabiiiiia que voces eram brasileiros!!!!! peguei pelo sotaque e pelo "guga" rsrsrsrs mas confirmei nas infos do canal.. muito foda por sinal, trabalho incrível, parabéns!!! 🟩🟨
Can I be in one of your videos please?
Try Jack Daniels Tennessee Honey next...
"Get sticky wid it"
Any natural honey will cristalize if it's a bit cold.  All that honey in america that is runny if full of other stuff, and the worst of them is not even honey at all.
Imagine being at a barbeque with these guys just eating hella steak and having a good time.
k its kinda an old video, but damn your mic is too warm i cant understand what you are saying unless i set my bass to 0 e: in the first part of video.
Another factor is honey, ESPECIALLY manuka honey is a very strong antibiotic. Destroys almost all bacteria by dehydrating them to death. Helps protect the meat and I suspect that's why the dry age funk was missing.
Looks like an oz of shatter on that parchment paper lol
I bet dry aged steak tastes amazing but it’s also super wasteful. No thanks
"You know I don't like wasting any food." Proceeds to throw away several chilograms of meat in order to obtain a couple of stakes. GG.
How do you cut a three rib roast in half?
You have zero clue what dry aged means. What fat are you encasing the meat in? So dumb
Guga : I hate wasting food.  Also Guga : From the whole Rib Roast we got a single steak. (honey dry age experiment)
Why did you not place the honey steak in a bag and vacuum seal it?
Sounds delightfull..
i think 35 days for aging it past due for safe eating
Dry age with Old Bay!!
Man, do a brisket like this maybe.
I feel a little dirty watching this one.
What temperature do you serve the steak?
Fun fact: honey is an enzyme, so it will naturally tenderize the meat faster, and by dry aging your preventing the air from oxidizing the exterior.
“A man dry aged stake in honey, this is what happened to his brain”
Guga and Marco should do a colab. Steak dry aged in stock cubes.
When I watch this channel I feel like I've never had a real steak
The knife links aren't working. Can you add the make/models?
You bought the most disgusting honey there was
This could be the way to do a dry aged steak for people who don't typically like the aftertaste of dry aged, but love everything else about it, like the tenderness and juiciness of it.
This is the meat from Zero Two’s dreams
Huh.... so Soma was right
When you say honey is runny, you mean American "honey".
Fun fact, in certain cases, medical staff will use manuka honey as part of wound dressings!   I didn't know it was an actual edible honey before this, so I heard him say that he was using it and just went 👁👄👁
This gives me Food Wars vibes
Doesn't like to waste food... 3:53 I wanted to see that cooked but okay..
Looks like dabs… there’s an experiment for you!!!!! Dry aged in dabs!
honey is a liquid tho
No diss to homie but he looks like 69 😩
Guga's face when he said "it smells wonderful" describes the meaning of true love
I love the dry age experiments. What if you coated it in the honey, then dry aged it in the UMAi bag? Do you think it would save more of the meat?
Says he hates to waste food in his ad plug but wastes more steak than anyone on the internet
Love your videos!
dry age in garlic paste
I DRY AGED A STEAK IN MY OWN SEMEN THE RESULTS WERE INCREDIBLE!
Manuka honey has a very distinctive taste, it is instantly recognisable from other honeys
Does that just remind me of Darling in the FranXX? :D
*H O N E Y*
Lol 35 days in the fridge is disgusting for anything.
Watches food wars once
RIP to the meat that was thrown Everytime he did dry aged experiment
Hypothetically speaking, if pineapple and honey can disintegrate steak it can also dissolve human bodies.....  Hypothetically speaking....  Asking for a friend...  My friend who is alive completely..
My mom used fresh pineapple on the ham she cooked, the first piece was good but second piece melted in my mouth like oatmeal. I will n never forget the taste or the texture lol. After that my mom realized she better stick with canned pineapples.
wouldnt it be wet aged?
The video quality is so nice 🤌🏼✨
He is fat because he eats Stake for BLD
Anyone else think of Food Wars?
How about Chicken Dry aged. Can you try for chicken to process dry aged?? 😂
Well THAT looked like a great big expensive waste of money and time!!!  Manuka my manuka!
Try walnuts cooked in butter, cool it down and dry age with it
Please show Angel even more 🧍🏻‍♀️❤️
Dry-aged leaves so much waste. I don't understand why people are willing to waste so much expensive meat.
Technically I think the world first honey dry aged experiment was king Herod’s wife.
Cant you rinse the honey off?
I've been using honey for a tenderizer for a few years after I saw it on food wars
Hello! I’m from New Zealand just like that Manuka Honey! Manuka is a native plant here that makes great honey
Dry Age Steak in MUSTARD!!!!
I'd like to see a more standard mainstream supermarket honey dry age, not the fancy manuka
Hell ya
why dont u try dry adge with hony and yogat mixx plus with sum spices
I tried the offer from hello they only discounted 7$ and free ship nothing was free
Is your wallet okay after that much Manuka
Mamalkhs would be happy
Should have taken the honey that makes you hallucinate
how about toothpaste 😂
you lost me at one steak.
That honey comes from the best land in the world people ( NEW ZEALAND )
why is gugas voice so satisfing
what a about dry aged steaks with charcoal?
YAY FOOD WARS RELATED HONEY WITH STEAK :D
Missed at spot at 2:45 bottom left
Dude should narrate bed time stories
Why didn't you seal up the honey steak? Like how you did with the normal dry age steak.
"The worlds first dry aged honey experiment" Obviously not, Google knew.
"The worlds first dry aged honey experiment" Obviously not, Google's done it before.

Next Episode: "I Wet-aged Steaks in Aged Steak Dryers"
Anyone knows pinapple/honey tenderizes meat cuz of food wars? 👦
Dude manuka honey is too expensive. He likely spent around 60 dollars in total for that honey.
Bruhh dont use metal when spreading or scooping honey, ur gonna lose all its nutrients
It looks like caramel
U don't like wasting food, yet you just sent 3/4th of a chunk of meat in the dumpster... 3 slices of steak for the amount of 3lb. Well don, kiddo!
Who else has seen shokugeki: food wars, and thought of this
How long was the Honey aged steak dry for?
Dude go blow your nose
Do you know I would be curious to see if you can turn pineapple into a powder and if you could still tenderize meat with it
i wonder if he ever mixed up the stakes between them, like do you think he ever mixed up the normal dry age and the honey dry age for example ...
The issue you had was the Honey sealed the least, it locked in the moisture which then went rancid. We did the same dry-age experiments in Chef College, in 1987, back in the UK.
It's almost sad to see Manuka honey being used like this xD
UkuGuga means getting old on Zulu
Dry age in caramel
Why do I feel like he was creaming his pants spreading the honey
Try dry age in garlic and onion paste
S’good 🔥🔥🔥😋
Man’s sounds like nacho libre I love it 😂
Damn, the slicing on that steak was perfect.
USE CORN
Now I’m hungry
waiting for shiracha dry age
I was today years old when I learned the word "emzynes".
2:44 Looks like the bee put the *nut* in honey nut cheerios
It’s not the first but the first to be recorded like the saying what ever you think someone has already done it
Soma does this in food wars yessir
He says he doesn't like wasting food, but he dry ages huge pieces of meat that he ends up trimming into 2-3 steaks lol.   I do love the channel and the food though, just saying lol.
How about just cooking the steak
*getting some flashbacks of Zero Two pouring honey on meat in episode two of Darling in the Franxx*
“One thing I’ve learned from dry aging experiments is to follow your nose” Me with a nearly non functional sense of smell: well damn it
Using Reddit as a source is the nightmare of my teachers
Over cooked af
Looks nice
Thank you for making me think of zero two
Man I'm a vegetarian, why do I keep watching these?
Hey Guga, you guys should smoke a steak using wild roses, trust me, it’s a must try!!! You’ll love it.
If anyone knew abt it because of shokugeki no souma raise ur hand
My man dropped more money on honey than he did buying steaks
Guga. Try it with Himalayan Mad Honey
“I dry aged steak in cu-“
We used ro warm the honey slightley and submerged the steaks before letting it sit for 20 or 40 days. To get rid of the coating just use warm water.... u cut the rind of anyways. Nice vids man.
He moans when he smells it😂😭
Disappointed that this video isn't sponsored by honey
It must be a delicious leap of faith to be your friend!
dry age steak in bong water
I try to make my streaks like guga but always come up short 😑
Guga please do a dry age video with beewax ❤👀
What I thinking is how long can you dry age them
would a bone scraper be good to remove the dried honey
I know I'm not the one who runs a channel who does a TONNE of dry aging but I think you could have kept more of the honey roast
isnt that just rotan meat
I get twice as much food from the grocery store for the same price as hello fresh
If only this was sponsored by honey too lol
Using the most expensive honey in the world for dry aging streak, weird flex you got there
10/10 Guga wrote that reddit comment that he googled.
Listen to you nose, this is kind of cool as he makes it seem logical
Also not to rain on the parade but this is certainly not the first honey dry aged steak Haha otherwise there wouldn't be Google results
Manuka honey comes from the manuka tree which is a native of my country, New Zealand
Dry age the next one in ground beef
Try a honey dry aged eye of round steak 🤷‍♂️
07:28-07:30, as you throw away over half of a roast.

Honey from my home
I bet they'd be better if they were cooked
Most intense steak cooking I’ve ever seen my word it’s lovely
I literally put Manuka Honey on wounds. that stuff is magic
Angel's reactions are always priceless.  I watch to learn, and because Guga cooks steaks to such perfection that it's pretty much food porn (let's be honest). But the finish, with Guga's exuberance, and Angel's trepidation are the money shot:  you guys paint a picture that I can truly taste for myself.  Thank you.  So happy to be a subscriber.
i sometimes put honey in my stakes while cooking them, its a nice and different flavor
yeah honey naturally has antiseptic and anti fungal properties so it's not gonna get that funk
What a waste of food!!!
Manuka honey can be used medicinally for wounds such as cuts and burns. Though if you wanted to flavor your steak as well with the honey, I would say try to taste different honeys, I particular don’t like buckwheat because the smell is a bit weird and it has a bit of an earthy taste but turns sweet later, I just don’t like that kind of taste in my honey.
“Some are soft others are hard but all of them are sticky”-guga 2021
Just as a little information for future reference, I am a Bee Keeper and produce raw unfiltered as close to Organic as is possible, considering the Bees fly up to 5 kilometres from the Hive. One thing many people don't understand about Commercial Honey products is that well over 30% of shop bought Honey, if not more is diluted with a cheap sugar syrup of some kind, like Corn syrup or Rice syrup, cane syrup and who knows what else. Honey is bought by the Bottlers in 44 gallon drums, these Honeys are blended to make the products found in the stores, the Honey comes from all over the world. Most people don't even know what real fresh Honey actually tastes like, they think what they bought from a local Supermarket is fresh lol. What people need to do is go visit your local Bee Keeper, you will find every area has at least one Honey producer that sells to the public. These local people sell real fresh Honey. Before I started keeping Bees, I thought the stuff I bought from the shop was Honey, I had forgotten what fresh Honey tasted like as I hadn't been on the farm for over 40 years, my Parents had Bees on the farm. I started with one Hive and grew from there, I am by no means a large producer, I am a hobby Bee Keeper more for the environment that to make money. Manuka honey is a great Honey, if you can get true pure Manuka Honey, trouble is that 1000% more Manuka Honey gets sold per year than is produced, this means the majority of honey being sold as Manuka is not or barely has any in it at all. I have two Diabetics in my family, neither could have shop bought Honey as the ones they bought were mixed with a cheap syrup, this syrup is not good for Diabetics, real pure Honey doesn't cause a sugar spike as they found out when I started supplying them with pure fresh raw Honey. Next time if you want to try a proper Honey aged beef, try Honey from your local Bee Keeper as you will be 100% sure it's real Honey and not diluted with anything else ;) There is a great Documentary about the bad habits some of the larger honey Bottlers continue to practice, I won't mention any brands, all you need do is get some real local Honey and then taste the Honey you still have in the Fridge or Cupbord that was bought from the shop to see a huge flavour difference as well as the lack of a funny after taste.
Guga i love the content and i love your personality. I wanna fly to the states just to shake your hand thanks for helping me kill time I appreciate you bro much love all the way from Australia
Fun fact for you Guga, you can also use Manuka honey to heal wounds. Equestrians and cowboys have been doing it for YEARS ☺️
Do you want ants? Because that's how you get ants.
Next episode please try dry aged meat with tempoyak(' fermented durian')
People in the comments talking about how Manuka hiney is expensive🤣look up "Sugarbag Honey" from native Australian bees runs about $1000 per kilo 😊
There is also Honeydew which is made from the sap of trees after it has been digested by aphids.
the only thing I learned watching this is that this man has money
The amount of waste we create from eating cows is sad. I really hope you threw that waste in a good place instead of a waste lot
i love honey ribs
The reason he called it not dry age is because honey in history is also used to preserve. So it preserves the meat so you wont get the dry age taste. But as guga said it will be real tender.
As a butcher I’ve gotten to try a dry aged top sirloin and it was better than a regular rib-eye.
The honey isn't creamy because of enzymes/manuka, it's because it's been creamed. It's like when you whip cream, but with honey instead.  Obviously it's not fluffy like cream, but it goes thicker and some can even be solid at room temp. It's how we prefer to buy our honey in NZ because it's easier to spread on toast, more convenient than a squeezy bottle and also has less crystals.
Bro why dose it look like chickfalay sauc
10:30 dude ejaculating from a steak lol
This reminds me of that episode in Foodwars
You haven't told us how much does Manuka Honey cost! Lol
on jah, learned about the honey tenderizing by watching food wars lol
MANUKA HONEY? my man spent his life savings to make this video, RIP
hang on..."if you're like me you don't like to waste any food."...you just threw away 90% of your cut
one steak...4000 dollars cheers bro
This is such a waste of food.
Dry-aging steaks in hot dog water
Have you done dry aged beef jerky? Maybe both ways you did on this video or the butter dry age as well
I learned the Honey trick on the Anime Food Wars :D
Can it work on my meat though?
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!
5:51 I thought an ad came on there, impressive video work
Next week on guga, Helmet cheese dry aged steaks.
I think the reason why it didn't taste dry-aged was probably because honey kills the mould which gives it the dry age flavour. I don't know anything about steak, this is just intuition.
do honey butter
"not runny like regular honey" .... why are you americans like that 😫
Guys if you want to try this dont use same hones as he did this honey can be 100 times more expensive then normal one
Makes my mouth water. I'm so hungry right now.
I'm so keen to know how your bellies held up to that honey steak?  Cutting away the green bits wouldn't be enough for my digestive system 🤢
well honey destroy bacteria
Did you really think you invented this ?
What did you use the rest of the meat for?
Thats the best honey in new zealand 🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿
I love that honey when i was sick i would make green tea with it and i felt better
Those flames are way too high
Something tells me you should just Sous Vide Everything
Should have used buckwheat honey...
i thought of manuka honey as soon as he brought up which type of honey to use... it is Very Popular here in New Zealand
I love these experiments! Great video guys!

oh man i buy that honey all time , love it .. now i got a new idea what to do with it XD
lol bro people have dry aged steaks in honey millions of times before you. How do you claim its the worlds first!? lol what a clown statement
Oh my god that look on his face at 10:31, it's probably the expression for the love of steak I've ever seen.
Is it HALAL?
im crying cause of the desire i have of eating thaaath

Never tried honey with steak...really? my father swears by it out of his butchery career great for Christmas or hogmany
B E E F Y F L A V O R
So what if you covered the meat in honey and then vacuum sealed it? Think that would work better?
💙Pure cancer i love it,❤️
Man spent 100$ on honey for his experiment!
Loving this... everyone's favorite gay uncle cooking delicious meat
Try this with chicken  1 onion  1 stick of butter 1 teaspoon of garlic powder  Chop up the onion place in a cake pan size pan the 10 x 16 I think or 10 x 20 place the chicken on top of the onion and then you won't you stick a butter put a half teaspoon on each piece of chicken sprinkle the garlic powder over the butter and bake in the oven for dilaudid time to cook chicken there you go restaurant style chicken that was baked in the oven
if you coated it in honey thats not dry ageing, to dry age it you need to let certain bacteria in the air get at the meat, honey is bacteriocidal (it kills microbs) no this was probly more like being marinated
After seeing the discoloration, I would mix some salt and maybe some preferred herbs, I might dry some manuka leaves and use those.
Also, I have easy access to free NZ local bush honey with a very high Manuka content.  Once again, Amazing! Thank you so much for this video.
This actually is so obvious, but first I've heard of it.  Amazing, I will try it asap.
You should go with local honey that will benefit you because of the pollen and stuff allergies and whatnot
Next experiment you should do this again but let the meat turn into mice and then use that mushy dry aged steak to make awesome beef-based sausage
lets dew it!!
my heart =(
Manuka honey is the worlds most fraudulant food. Every year there's something like 100x the amount of Manuka produced vs the amount sold. Even most 'legitimate' shop bought Manuka is either a miniscule% of actual product or just downright fake.
DRY AGE IN WAGYU FAT
But I think it's real weird done dry aging a steak in gummy bears
"some are hard, some are soft, but they're all sticky -Guga 2021
I keep all my cows in pools of mustard their entire lives and then I had a steak ,it was wonderful
I feel like food wars inspired this episode
i wish i could taste this man
why not try a shorter time when dry aging anything sugar based?
Reminds me of zerotwo lmao
>the most enzymes kek
You lost me at charcoal..... Taste the meat, not the heat.
9:06 Oh, I noticed... you can see it wrinkling it's so soft.
Wouldn't that be wet aging......considering that the honey would prevent moisture loss?
guga:just listen to your nose   me:what huh
it is almost sad that it is not sponsert by honny
This is probably my favorite guga video! I'm too scared to try it myself lol
UM, don't dry age meat bone in.  EVER
lmao!  the honey bought wasn't "special". Simply unprocessed.  You can get that from USA sources for a FRACTION of what you paid.
You cooked that perfectly
A little wasteful
I think it's a shame he grills everything. There are so many better options.
Yoghurt is great for marinade!
You cannot just cook steak that looks that good and not expect to be hunted down and kidnapped and held hostage forever. only to cook steaks for the hostage takers, until the end of time😜
35 days inside of your fridge? Dude refrigerators are gross and stink...yuk dude
On a sad not so much wasted meat.
It’s actually delicious…. Like any honey isn’t delicious lol it’s basically sugar of course it’s delicious!
this guy going to have cardiac arrest dead ass
The fact that northern Indian cuisine usually add yogurt into chicken marinade to soften up and tenderize the texture. You can find this commonly in tandoori style.
How is it dry aged when you used a liquid ? It’s called cured   Learn the basic culinary terms at least
Can't wait for the vegan teacher to make a song outta this
1.1k disliked this video.....why????
I didn't eat dinner yet and I am watching this... youtube you bastard- I am not mad tho
Cook it with Manuka wood for an even better hit of flavour.
Us kiwis make the best honey
Florida accent im thinking south broward or dade for sure!!
What a waste of good meat!
How can surface applied honey affect the meat that is underneath all the stuff you trimmed off the dry aged piece?   It's not going to migrate into the meat.
I hate this video! I'm starving now xD
Thank you for putting this all together to show us! Just ran up on your video in my feed.  I love this kind of info thanks again.
Manuka honey is expensive stuff. More expensive than the meat itself. So apart from the messy nightmare, you are at least doubling the cost. If on top of that you got 1 steak instead of 2 out of it, that is 4 times more expensive. I mean, I'm sure it was nice, but 4 times nicer? Nah.
Dude, I am subbed. You are fantastic and the ASMR that is your voice is incredible haha.
chef is embarassing as hell
His nephew is lucky to have such a cool uncle
Nice waste meat for YouTube then advertise about not wasting food
Yeah.. Nah.. NOPE!.. I ain't no Savage Neanderthal, So I only eat meat that's well done, as in perfectly done, None of this BLOOD dripping out of what is essentially heated raw meat..🤮
LOl i am a beekeeper , everything i own is sticky
As a mazer I think I found my next experiment.  I've tried buckwheat honey, clover honey and an ancient recipe with home grown barm.  this sounds fascinating.  Thanks dude!  Will be interesting.
might be interesting to see how much meat you'd keep from honey aging in the bag.
ill get sticky looks worth it
I think you might be able to age it for less time . I think you should try only about 2 weeks or less  we used to do the same honey we did it about 3 to 4 days in a bag in the fridge on the cut steak hmm memories and smells
0:12 i learned that from shokugeki no souma/ food wars xD🤣🤣
its look better than sex
"if you know me you know I don't like to waste food.." After turning 2 steaks in one steak by just trimming steak
Everybadyy Cheers
What a complete waste of good meat.
so much exaggerated laughter and non sense chit chat.. ridiculous
Marvellous
flame on the meet i really don't like it as there is a study that can cause cancer!!! sorry Guga even tho i really like your channel
Man just coated the meat in hundreds of dollars of gods own liquid gold.
Man, that manuka is 25$ for that same size jar where I am, and you bought 3 for this. hot damn.
*laughs in Food Wars*
The pellicle is wasteful, is there any use for it?
Yep, honey, yogurt, kiwi, pineapple are all great at tenderizing meat. You know what's even better? Marinating them with a mixture of all of the above (and other seasonings) - and the results are AMAZING (have tried on both chicken and steak). Any of those ingredients works well on they're own, but in combination they're fantastic - you get great results with even a 30 minute marinade, but an overnight marinade on a steak brings results that are UNREAL.  No need to use expensive Manouka honey or let it sit for weeks... and the results are always impressive.  Hell, I didn't believe it when I was told to just mash up a kiwi and spread it on a steak for 20 minutes a side, and was amazed at the delicious results [not a hint of kiwi flavor].    Likewise, one of the best, most flavorful and tender steaks I've ever had was made by a South African friend who marinated it overnight in yogurt and before grilling, coated it in his favorite South African "braai" (bbq) spice blend.  Still trying to replicate those results - the meat was so tender and falling apart it was almost.... shaggy? But not mushy, it was perfection. Can't find the same spice blend online, need to bribe him to bribe his parents to send some extra for me next time they send him a care package, the flavor was indescribable.
You guys are awesome and I really value your opinion. I enjoyed your video very much and I learned something too, AWESOME!!! and Thank you kindly.
1700 tons of manuka honey get produced every year, 10000 tons are sold every year at shops and supermarkets... have fun getting unadultered manuka on amazon.
$50 worth of honey to tenderize a steak
didnt food wars already did this such a late video
boah geil...ich hab heute noch nix gegessen...mein magen schlägt mir grad ein blaues auge!!
Dry-age in vacuum. How about a collaboration with NileRed channel? He must have some suitable substances.
Wasted all that meat
why is the honey so thick?
u missed a spot.. lol
First thing I thought of was darling in the franxxx
14 minutes to learn that honey or pineapple breaks down meat protein....AND IM STILL HUNGRY!!! T<T
I dont know how I got here, but im watching a dude seductively honey some bomb ass meat.
Hey Guys Manuka honey 🍯 comes from New Zealand 🇳🇿
Is pepperoni pizza still safe to eat
Me after watching food wars:
But, isn't this wet aging?  I thought the whole "dry" part of dry aging implying that there would be moisture leaving the meat. To do that doesn't it need to not be touching stuff?
you da man!
hmmm wonder how long it usually takes for the honey to penetrate the meat
I YELLED on YOUTUBE and this happend!
Great video, though the edit at least insinuates your over controlling and cutting off your assistant, thereby it makes you out as a bit arrogant which obviously isn't true. Respond if you even take note....
It got super fking intense at the 6:00 minute mark lmao
Try raw milk fat. Like some raw butter.
ELE TIROU A GORDURA? AAAAA não, para hahahahaha
Jesus Guga, fantástico!
fun fact morticians cant stand the smell of aged steak because thats what death smells like haha
Not sure how you did it but reckon  I could smell the steaks by the 7 minute mark, delicious!
lets dry age a steak in something that isnt dry
Did you try adding some steak to your salt?
Wtf are pellicos/tellicos?
We use Manuka honey for wound care. I've seen it do some awesome things for bad foot wounds.
For that amount of wasted meat and super expensive honey it's better be good 😲
OMG a small bottle of manuka honey is over $100 - probably a lot more than this steak!
The marinade will only go into the meat a couple of millimetres. Waste of time marinading for more than a couple of hours. Don't put salt on the meat and immediately cook it. Salt "brining" - salt draws moisture out of the meat. Leave it for a couple of hours, the moisture will once again go into the meat. Leaving a beautiful crust. BBQ - no flames. Put the meat on the hot griddle over red-hot charcoal. The flames do nothing but make for "impressive" (?) visual effect.Take the meat from the BBQ, wrap in foil, and leave to rest, relax those meat fibres. "Hello Fresh" looks beige, thoroughly uninteresting.
I need to stop watching these whilst hungry....
ok so you used dry aged steak to start with ...used a weird cut to dry age with and also you didnt even cut off all the dark spot that dry age experts remove at its considered fouled meat... kewl video i guess if you want a introductory in what not to show people what not to do.. enjoy your indigestion sir
ty
because of the accent, I think you are Brazilian, am I right?
it does not seem to be worth, literally, the effort....
Honey in America looks like that? lol
over cooked.
when you're slicing the meat you make my mouth watering.
Now do it again with a Kobe or (If you're feeling cheap) Wagyu.
"Manuka honey is expensive" Me spreading it in my toast every morning.
ive only gotten to the after grilling part and while you are doing the advertisement thingy i just want to say this... I hate you cause now I'm hungry.
it's a complete waste of money to do that with manuka honey. any regular honey would have done the job. and also, he could have chosen a completely crystalized honey, which would have stick hard on the meat and avoid the mold. finally, honey reduces time to soften meat in half. so he should have ended the experiment sooner with the honey. that's an experiment he should do over again.
you should try and combine traditional and honey, put the honey on it, IN a bag with vacuum
Steak porn voice forever seared into my head
mexicans talk like they're singing
Wait. Does Hello Fresh drink your tea..? Ew.
sry I'm totally new to this dry aged stuff...shouldn't the meat smell horribly after a month? :I
i dry aged a wonderful cut of beef in bee spit, lets see how it went lol
O
Is'nt this wet aging?
sugar is water soluble ma dude.... try h20 for stickie surfaces...
Next episode "I dry aged A5 Waygu in whale fat and goose tears and here's what happened 😱"
Dude, can we hang out?  Lol
This looked unreal. I just finished eating dinner and now i'm hungry again
Those steaks look awesome
imagine spending that much money on a meal that will sustain you for a day.
good old technique 4th century BCE Mellified man
5+? lmao u need to have 300+ to actually have the benifits, this is comparable to syrup the one you got
Perhaps a good idea may have been to coat the beef in honey and THEN vacuum sealed it for the rest of the aging process.
"went ahead and bought the best one" proceeds to pick up the cheap 5+ manuka instead lmfao.
Honey has great antibacterial properties!!!
You couldn't put the honey into the bag?
This *honey* is not *runny,* but if you've got *money* to feed a *bunny* and the weather is *sunny* you could do something *funny* and try something else than Manuka *honey* :)
Here's the deal. Put honey in the dry age bag!111111111111111111
you can manuka honey pretty cheap in NZ
@Guga....this is gonna be pricey, but SUBMERGE THE STEAK IN MANUKA HONEY...lol, I'm sure you won't lose as much meat....honey also acts as an antibacterial, so...submerging would guarantee best result.
Do you know how much Manuka honey costs?
yall vampires?!?!?!  why is yall eating bloody meat!?  its not juicy its BLOOD!
why didn't you bag it like "normal" dry age?
So during his minute and a half in-bedded commercial he says he hates to waste food......meanwhile in his video he is wasting COPIOUS amounts of beef......makes sense
EVVVVVVVV
Just cook that thing as it was.  What a waste!  Nut job.
Nice to know.  Now I have a choice to tenderize.  Car hop trays from amazon.
Food is a passion of mine, and you sir have just earned a subscription. Keep up the good work! Loved the video!
honey is one of the world's oldest and most reliable preservatives. But I think you might have had better luck if it was wrapped somehow, considering your issues came up when the honey slid off
I would have put the meat in a huge container really filled with honey, like honey filling the container up to several cm over the meat, just to be sure it does the work properly because maybe the bad part were because the layer was too thin?
Hmmmmm, sounds like honey would be better suited for an overnight marinade on a leaner cut of meat.
Should just lightly glaze it in the honey then put it  in the dry age bag...
They wont age in honey...
Bro out of ideas
In fact Alexander The Greats dead body was transported from Babylon to Macedonia in a casket full of honney 😎
actually ppl were preserving meat in honey since forever
If the honey can't do the thing then I think some Canada stuff gonna fix it: MAPLE SIRRUP !!!! (nah it's quite liquid so maybe it won't work on spreading)
Next episode, I dry aged steaks in guga foods merch
10:30 🤨🤨🤨
"Do you not feel a little bit of difference in flavor? Pay attention!" 😂😂
I actually use manuka wood for smoking occasionally. It's pretty hard so it burns hot but it's good in charcoal cooks with chunks of it.
honey? that's bee poop
It makes me sick to see expensive food waisted just for a video when there's people starving
OMG, souvis with manuka honey....I just made my self hungry all over again.
2:17 dabs
And in this episode i will dry-age a steake with goldleafs and diamonds!
The best way to make corned beef, is to stick your roast in a bucket of pineapple juice
Honey will preserve it lol
nice..... but not... cause the waste of meat.. glad it tastes good but damn, all the meat you had to waste to get that flavor. =( makes me sad, but such a cool experiment! =D
What
Thanks for doing honey
Somebody was watching food wars
He is like the guy in Perfume movie lmao 😂
honey goes very well for marinading meat, and especially for people who lost their smell due to COVID-19. eating regular mean is almost impossible, but my bro can eat marinaded in honey almost as easy as before. recomend that.
He looks like 69 without tattoos
I love to see my countries food and culture used in your videos. Go guga!!
You should try dry aging the honey steaks in a wooden bin. Submerge the meat!
that honey doesn't look very natural...
you should try put the honey one in the vacuum bag
I’m waiting on a meat canyon vid on this
NZ honey = best honey
6:00 i was confused like why is this stupid grill add playing through my video, where the steaks at?
XXX Food porn. I've learned a lot from your videos. Great job
Mr Guga, please try the honey thing again but instead of spreading fancy honey on it, leave it soaking in a tub full of honey. Wet-aged in honey
Taylor’s Steakhouse in Dumas Arkansas. THE BEST steak you’ll every have.
Hey Guga, why not a regular bucket of honey and dry age inside it? Not like a spread but as a marinade?
omg the music made the grilling part so intense!!!! ty for that
"A good amount of salt"? That's an awful lot! You probably should take better care of your kidneys.  Also, you should put pepper on the meat only *after* cooking. The heat makes it burn and develop a bitter taste.
You have the best looking meat
I think what you need to do for this one is completely submerge it in the honey, use a container that is just slightly bigger than the original piece of meat so its completely submerged but not too much extra space.
Interesting!
Bruh 1st of all you used Manuka honey! Not just regular ole honey. I literally spent like $50 on a small ass jar. You failed to mention that
Use the bag and honey.
We use honey to dryeadg whole goat and keep it for 35 days and we grill it in Stone name it Madby in South Saudi Arabia and Yamen
1000 vegans downvoted this video :-D!
It looks like my earwax lol
What a waste of meat?
I am drooling watching this. And I just had dinner.
Dry age a steak in the urine of a diabetic. That’d be something!
Awesome chanel,also here to check on " keeps "
Guga. You should start experimenting with gelatin.  Add a packet and an egg yolk to burger meat. It gives the that flavor you get from braising meat all day.
I'd go with Himalayan Red Honey personally.
Honey, epecially manuka honey, is antibacterial, which will not allow the bacteria to develop the complex flavors in the dry-aging process.  Also honey produces hydrogen peroxide, so even if you had vacuum sealed the honey one, you would still have oxidation.  Conclusion: honey should only be used for a marinade, one hour max--not for dry aging.
You can get something better if you cook a roast coated with honey. Less waste than this and tastes better. You also get more.
I've never been so turned on by a video about ageing beef...
Manuka honey is used to treat burn victims
I wonder if it's how long he's dry aging that makes the taste not as good? Like, he's either going too long or too short because of what he uses to marinate. The time length you dry age depends on the marinate you use?
Am I the only person on earth who doesn't like honey?  I can't imagine ruining a good steak in this manner.
Angel - I hope I don't die Guga - he.he. you won't... *looks away from the camera*
Never mind M Honey is crazy expensive, specially that much of it.
It looks like,tinned Dog food waste of good steak
Damn the honey goes from £15 a jar all the way to £1300 for a jar. *mans used 3 jars.*
Throw a bunch of Jalapeño juice in one of those vacuum bags and dry age the steak in it.
You said, “If you know me, you know I don’t like to waste food!” right after you wasted several pounds of meat doing your experiment. Brother, I’d slap the fire out of my mother’s monkey just to try one of your steaks, but I nearly cried watching you murder that beautiful roast.
dry age in whipped cream
Repent and trust in Yahuah always.Joshua 24:15👏🏽🤍
you should've done this with your honey sponser!
thats not honey
Curious if submerging it in honey would be different or to much
It took you this long to try honey? I wonder if you've tried pureed onions?
You should dry age a steak in the mushroom paste that goes in beef wellingtons
Y’all just end up making me hungry.
try a combination of using the honey and the bag that might make it tender while also properly aging it
Should have used mad honey instead
12:41 pause
You ate 35 day old meat? Is that ok to do? I would never do that unless it was jerky. I just have problems with the idea of eating old meat.
These videos are done so damn well
Do honey for 15 days, in a dry bag, minus the bone. Then just cook! Do the job right and you will enjoy the food more.
dry aged steak and then marinate in honey
Superb
Nice
That's looks like fake honey
Can I get the link of the charcoal grill that you use?
Music dumb i turned it
10:01 LOL
Try dry age it normally then put honey on it for 2 days then stuff it in your belly
I was expecting to see a bunch of gordon ramsay memes in the comments of this video
I like your videos but damn your voice pisses me off lol
Cool Experiment but Absolutely not worth wasting that amount of honey, The Honey Is Too Valuable & Bee's are dying everywhere etc etc etc...
Dry age a steak in cow poop
Dry age a steak in caviar
Guga, I've been a long time fan, but I gotta admit, these titles have become kinda clickbaity now.  Still love your channel. But just would be great to have better titles.
What a waste of good meat.
I need guga to open a restaurant
I didn't know honey disintegrates meat, but I did know it's a great antibacterial substance so there shouldn't be a lot of concern of unwanted stuff getting into the meat from the outside.
SLAP THE MEAT GUGA GIVE THE VIEWERS THE SLAP-
Que manera de tirar y desperdiciar la comida, viejo ridículo. No volveré a ver este canal.
Do it in peanut brittle
His voice makes me uncomfortable...
I have never seen honey that looks like that.
I liked this approach so much I  tried it myself. Then grilled over pecan shell and hard wood  charcoal.  LUVED it !!
Shouldnt use metal fo the Manuka Honey :(
Those steaks look amazing, it has made me so hungry. It doesn’t help that I am just about to cook dinner either! Thanks for sharing!
Enjoy your flavor portfolio breakdown
Manuka is not delicious, I strongly disagree
But he didn't rest the steaks before slicing? Look at all that bleeding. )-:
Looks like caramel
Dry age a steak in salt crust its traditional islandic way 😁 but u have to bury it in the ground too! Maybe i gotta explain a little more detailed:  First you have to have a big fat chunk of steak, maybe one of your picanias or so would work. 2nd the salt crust so this is a little tricky basically u want at least (!) a 2-3cm thick salt crust around the meat. So there is hard to explain for me and since this is really ultra traditional from old old time u prob wont find nothing on google (even many islanders dont know it anymore, it is from way back like the before bc time this recipe).  Basically u mix the salt with VERY LITTLE (!!!) fresh source water and apply it onto meat. Then use oven to harden out the crust but dont overdo it, its easy to f this step up and crack the crush etc (in the old times they used the sun to harden the salt crust). Then u take a natural fibre cloth (traditionally linen, jute also works good or cotton but it should be porous enough) and cover it again with a little loose salt, in this you wrap your salt crust meat.  Then most important step! Bury in ground! You should bury at least 50-60cm on the ground also a little bit depending on your meat size. You want at least 40cm of soil over your steak. And the location listen its ok if its rainy sometimes but under no circumstances the water should reach the steak! So choose location wisely too and bury deep enough this will protect from normal rain. And make sure no heavy rain in your location. The soil of course should be free of pesticides and such. Theoretically you could do it in a big container too and buy soil, but make absolutely sure it is 100% organic soil with no fertilizer etc.  So there you leave it for 1-2 months. Best time in year to do is winter, beginning of spring or dry phases of summer. Dont do it in autumn because of the rain and the cold combined its bad conditions (mould etc). Thumb rule is: cold is ok, wet&cold not ok. Hot is ok but not too hot and a little wet is ok but the colder it gets the less wet it can handle. Ok have fun my friend!!! I hope u have success if yes you will be rewarded with one of the most UNIQUE and DELISH dining experience ever i promise!!🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸
Anyone that knows how honey is made is a little sickened watching this...rofl
Strictly confectional!
You sold out.. so sad 😞
If you've never had natural honey fresh from a hive before, well, try to seek it out as soon as you can. It gets infused with all kinds of floral and aromatic flavors from the different plants the bees got nectar from.
can't stop imagine earwax :')
Shokugeki  Time! xD
Did anyone else get chills when he sliced the meat up
Why do i always end up watching food vids at 3am…
I love when this channel uploads.
So hungry
Dry age steaks with a dab of ranch
You sound like a Skyrim character. In a good way I promise.
What if you mixed that honey with butter and dry aged in that?
My grandpa had a bee farm, he used honey to tenderize meat!
Mmm tasty bee vomit
5+ ... best one I could find 🙄 mmm, k
I've done a honey marinade on sirloin before, it does the trick of making the meat tender. Also used a little bit of the left over marinade to make a gravy for mashed potatoes. Was a very interesting Sunday dinner.
what a waste of resources...
you get paid all this promotional money and waste all that food, but yet you can't cook a properly cross hatched pattern? smh.
leaf it too long geuss ima girl now i tell yee waht
Manuka Honey??? Jesus how much money/Manuka Honey are you wasting?
alexander the great turned out delicious!
I like how Guga removed all of the pellicles.
Not me knowing that this works from watching Food Wars
so you're saying i just dry aged the road rash on my two arms.....awesome
Any Shokugeki no soma vibes from the 2nd episode?
"I wanted to perfectly cover it" [Several parts of the meat would like a word with you]
Casually smears the steak with the most expensive honey in the world.
I learned this by watching an anime called food wars
You should have Dry aged it in a bowl
You sound like the worm from corpse bride and I love it.
have you dry aged meat in white chocolate?
Wait!! What??? Honey? Are you kidding me? Okay, let's watch the video and find out if it's actually crazy or not.  SO LET'S DO IT...
Anyone watch Food Wars? lmfao
Bet a single bite-sized cut from that steak costs around $50
What about beeswax?
I don't know why but Andrew's table manners annoyed me so much in this video!
can you do grilled squid tentacles with peanut butter?
I saw the title and immediately willing to save money to try buy a steak. Then I see the honey is Manuka...😢😢😢
See steak dousing by honey and think of food wars
the honey stops the meat drying surely
try it again but scrape the honey off and leave it another week or 3
honey tender the meat. Learn from shokugeki no soma
I would like to see you finish the steak
Shokigeki no souma
Honey from my country New Zealand 🇳🇿
How long was it dry aged?
Is it odd to anybody else that somebody that cooks for a living but use a service like hellofresh? I understand he's got to make his money it makes nothing but sense to me but it does feel slightly disingenuous with all that said my friend kudos to you I find your videos fascinating
I think for the honey, you'd have to put it in some sort of vessel (a vat or something full of honey probably wouldn't be able to dry age properly, but maybe a vacuum bag like the regular one?).  I suspect some of the meat turned rancid because the honey didn't keep it covered.
another definition of sticky honey roast
The arguments between Australia and NZ overManuka honey are quite fierce.  The word is Maori, but it was definitely first cultivated in Australia.
I don’t even know if it’s real or not what he’s reading but he is reading Reddit😂
You should have used "Comvita Certified UMF 10+ (MGO 263+) Raw Manuka Honey"
In My country Sri Lanka, the indigenous peoples we call them as Vadda (වැද්දා) peoples using honey to preserve meat since thousands of years back.
I'm still waiting for you guys open a restaurent :(
I haven't eaten beef and pork in 14 years but I still enjoy watching these videos
Hey Guga, ultimate fan here bro…thought for something different you might share about some of your knives and more importantly your favorite ways to keep them sharp?  Everything you do is the best bro.  PEACE 👊🏻
Good God $15-$200 per 8 ounces of honey depending on the UMF+ & MGO+ count
The clip of the meat in pineapple in the beginning is what would happen to your tongue if you didn’t feel the pineapple breaking it apart as you ate
Is that safe to eat
This was in Food Wars
I used to be a cow 🐄😂
If I lock a human in a container full of honey does that mean they'll melt over time-
just a tip for getting honey off but you might not have this but leave a bee hive open around honey and they will grab the honey and put it in the nest.
Why can’t you be my dad
Fun fact: Manila honey is actually very good for you and if you take a few spoon fulls a day while sick it will not only coat and soothe your throat but relieve and fight a bit of whatever your sick with. Great stuff
This dude beats his meat with salt and pepper
I knew he was using the most expensive honey
WoooW  Manuka honey What the hell man
guga, how about dry aged with a curry paste, sound interesting right?
When you realize that honey probably costs more than the steak.
You should try Honey butter .... we used to do this at a steakhouse I worked at.
Who else knew that honey tenders meat because of food wars
so why did you put only one in the bag, Would the honey one have had any difference if it was sealed?
Guga eyes watering...😅
Why does his voice remind me of Brain from Pinky and the brain?
Food wars??
Yukihira soma taught me this
Tabasco dryage
i would have eaten those offcuts
can i soften my wife's personality if i dry age her in honey?
12:01 looks like some fire shatter 🔥
He sounds like the Dr from My 600lb Life
How about a steak fully wrapped in bacon and then dry aged?
Try dry aging a steak with wasabi
It looks good and my moms sister has a honey farm and she says it produces really good honey
Why did I think the thumbnail was cake...
Well obviously they need to dry age in nacho cheese next.
00:10 me who watch food war...
next episode: dry age it with covid positive patient's cough sealed in vaccum bag
the guy: honey is a great-   me: *oh no not again* 12:06 like the honey website that saves money-
I looked at the honey and was like "That's damn manuka honey." I got some in my cupboard and use it for my skin.
Dry aged steaks / rotten cow carcass. Words can make us feel so much better about our behavior.
Why am I watching this in the middle of the night hungry?
dry aged with dandruff
He forgot to tell us how expensive is manuka honey. All I can say is "the taste does not justify the cost"
Hi you probably don’t wanna listen to the sponser either well here’s where the vid resumes 8:19
Reminding me Zero Two
Manuka Honey from NZ🇳🇿
how tf am i here at 2am
Food wars episode 3 :3
Mad I learnt this from an anime
Glad to see the heir back
How anyone can watch this video and still be vegan boggles my mind.
mellified -man- cow..?
Cook meat with honey not dry with honey
I find it interesting that food channels are promoting something as bad as Hello Fresh. I have used them before and have given them multiple chances, but their food is far from fresh and it is over priced for what you get. I highly doubt any of these cooking shows would actually use that service, I just find it a bit odd that you would promote something like that when you are known for making some really delicious and high quality dishes.
This should’ve had a trailer...
During the add: I don't like to waste food  Also guga: let's cut off two thirds of this steak and throw it away cause I wanted to dry age it.
Doesn't taste like I'm gonna die haha
For coating the steak for honey dry age to prevent the oxidization and spoilage, try  freezing the meat for an hour then dip the meat into it, then place into the dry age bag, the honey will stiffen and stick to the meat more.
HONEY I dry aged the steaks
i learnt this from food wars
Any shokugeki fans here?
Yt: you wanna see meat aged in vomit Me a pescatarian: 🧐yes
Try with coconut milk
Why did I think of sweet bod
I suppose honey would be good for a marinade tho
I live for him saying "everybody"
I knew about honey tenderizer from food wars🤣
You should try dry age in syrup
“This is the world’s first dry-age honey experiment.”  All of Ancient Egypt: *Laughs in sarcophagus*
Why do i keep watching these vids??? Damn... -.-  Ok i am hungry you happy now? xD
1:25 "This is not your regular honney bear honey. ... It has a woderful smell and it's actually delicious."  What! as if regular honey bear honey isn't delicious!?! It is HONEY it is delicious by definition!! ;-)
Food wars!
Reads about how honny turnes meat to mosh, if left too long, and leaves it for 36 days.
7:28 "If you know me, you know I don't like to waste any food" ... except for haf of the prime beef you let rot and cut off !! Mr. only one stake left, from this whole two bones rib roast.
I knew this a long ago because of tje anime food wars.  And i dont even cook, just a basic i guess.
I already know he will use manuka honey.
Food war fans already knew this
I think If you pre chilled the honey and Meat It would have stuck better Idk just a guess. Also to be in a really cool room to.
Hard to believe this guy lost weight? haha Looking great Guga!!
I was intrigued by the titles before, but now I only come for the grilling montages. I wish Guga would grill me a steak :D
All I was thinking was how good this would be with rice lol
Dear Guga, We use Manuka honey for treating wounds.  So effective antibiotic.
I think just sticking to kiwi and pineapple for tenderising meat. I used to work at a kbbq restuarant and their marinated beef rib strips were absolutely soft. It was soft enough that the weight of the rib was enough force to rip the meat where my chopstick was meant to pick it up. My team (I guess I was team leader) were suprised when we found out it was just kiwi and pineapple that was used as a tenderiser AND marinate.
You need to do it again but remove the bone or maybe even a different cut and leave it a bit longer.
guga: wow this is so satifying  wallet: stopppp buyying this is not cool!!!!
Guga, bro, I can't watch your channel no more, you always make me freaking hungry man. Nah, who am I kidding.
What if you mixed the honey with something like butter so it isn't as sticky but can still cover the steak?
Cool idea, but it's not "dry aged" Dry aging meat involves letting a beneficial set of micro organisms grow. The organisms break down the meat fibers and hence make it tender. Honey is a natural antibiotic and does not allow the formation of the useful micro organisms.  So, you were totally relying on the enzymes from the honey. And the smell issues worries me.
so basically candied beef
Expecting a honey sponser the whole vid
Resultado.. Mini carne.
mix the honey with butter. structural integrity so the steak stays covered
Try in a bowl of lesser quality honey! Also do the pineapple dry age at the same time to compare this side by side
135F? You mean 135C. 135F is basically a really hot bath. Might as well just bite the live cow.
It's expensive to import manuka honey, I dont know why Americans dont just buy some manuka plants for their bees, they like it they will use it, and they will produce manuka honey.
I thought porn aren't allowed on YouTube?
NEXT EPISODE: I DRY-AGED STEAK IN MOLDS
Me watching this: why am I watching this I’m pesketarian? Also me: 👁👄👁
Next try more honey. You didn’t coat it enough.
YouTube: steak slathered in honey? Brain: let’s see where this goes
alternate title: I DRY AGED steaks in BEE THROW UP and this happened
Just FYI, pineapple is not the best meat tenderizer. It's Kiwi. Stick it in some Kiwi mixed with yogurt and you're good to go.
Are you brazilian? Your accent sounds brazilian.
On this episode of Guga foods buys crazy expensive things that they’ve never heard of: Honey.
Dude looks like 69
i love how you say, "everybody."
Fun fact: you can’t buy imported honey in NZ, it’s all local.
35 days?👺
jokes on u i watched enough food wars to know what honey does to steak but i never put it to use cos i am physically capable of burning the house down making instant noodles
The past dedication admittedly interest because scissors concurringly present minus a industrious yellow. nifty, gaping nickel
I get heavy Hawaii vibes from these guys-
Should have fully submerged it in honey.
dry age in tuna. :D
that's a big ass dab lol
I knew that was Manuka honey by the look xD it's great for skincare and sore throats. The thought of putting that much money in honey on steak makes my wallet cry though
Leave it too long and you have mellified cow. Not as cool as mellified man but still cool.
I wonder if he dry-aged on salt yet.
Anybody else kinda gag when you see the way they look dry aged before being cut up
Idk why I'm watching it. I don't even eat meat ;-;
This guy low-key creepy
Does it taste different?! That's the fly larvae, I dry aged it on the porch!
Dude used the most expensive honey in the world
I don’t know about anyone else but the part where he started to cook steaks i swear I thought was an ad
Anyone know where this dude is from? Im guessing Brazil? but i keep thinking hes Hawaiian? am i tripping?  I need to know. please and thank you.
If you've watched food wars and know this already that honey is used to tenderize drop a like 😋😏😌
What about soy sauce?
Manuka Honey is expensive as F. I wish i could even get a little sample just to see if its really that good. I have tried cristalized very creamy honeys that are awesome.
Can I just say how soothing your voice is? Anyway, this was very interesting. Thank you for the vid.
Wait. THAT'S what honey looks like? Then, what have i been experiencing this whole time?
The part were he cooks them tricked me into thinking I got an add.
Manuka honey
So uh.. wonder what Chef you know who would have to say about this haha
Guga buying manuka honey without even realizing that he bought the best honey in the entire world.
Get that peppa off that
Why does so many people just talk and not even start the video like it’s not what we want
Yeah but what he didn't say, was, that is the most expensive honey in the world.
Dry age in hard candy
You probably got a good knife..
FAT LITTLE HANDS! You did again! SO DELICIUS!
Honey isn’t runny, cheap one is diluted with water, making it runny
Bro when he ask google which honey had the most enzymes I was like it gotta be Manuka and Lookie here it’s Manuka, this honey it good for many things and it’s always high on the market meaning it’s expensive and it originates from the native lands of New Zealand :DD
Next video: “The steak dry aged me”
the meat wrinkles
I wonder if combination of the honey and a good thick Greek yogurt would be better?
Video: “Honey tenderizes meat like pineapple because of the enzymes in both foods.” Me: *watches Food Wars* Me: 🥴
What if you tenderize it in honey then dry age it after? Would that give it the flavor of dry age while keeping it tender?
why the honeys so thick dMNNN
Not trending anymore.  But still a great video anyway nonetheless.
Made this steak for my moms third family, they said it was amazing and i got kicked out!
7:30 yo that’s one helluva knife collection :0
This honey looks damn sexy
Thought I was watching some ad at one point. Amazing video
Dude sounds like the worm off of the corpse bride
You can't just not put "and this happened" in the title, huh? Need that clickbait?
Caramel is next
Always pepper after the sear. Pepper scorches in high heat leaving an acrid burnt taste
theres as many types of honey as there are flowers bees will go to lol i always put some honey in my stir fry marinades to make pretty tough meat into a far more tender meat. i also use it in stews if i was gonna put sugar in instead.
Not cheap. The best Manuka honey here in London probably costs the equivalent of US$400 for a jar.
5:50 thatveganteacher when the cameras off
Try pomegranate Sauce called "Narsharab". It has Tenderising properties of Lemon and Pineapple.
They do this on food wars lol
I believe honey is best for marinating. Mielase in honey is very good for tenderising meat, i think you should just try marinating a dry aged steak in honey for the ultimate tender steak.
I wanna try these stakes
Manuka honey is produced by the manuka flowers which are native to Australia and New Zealand. The name "manuka" comes from the Maori language.
Your voice is so smooth and satisfying to listen to
that's not the most expensive brand either. I have a jar of Arataki brand Manuka honey that ran me $87
The kid with the beard doesn’t know how to hold a knife and fork. That’s why he had trouble cutting the steak.

I love steak… looks so delicious
you could make the honey stay on better by wrapping it in parchment paper.

I am late and this might have already been said. However honey has a lot of antimicrobial properties which might be the reason you didn't get the "Dry Age" flavor because it technically stopped the meat from fermenting during the dry age process to some degree. You can see that the one with honey didn't get as dark as the original dry age streak.
on manuka honey- " It's actually delicious" as if other honey's are not delicious lol
I hope he has a well fed dog
I have marinated with honey but never thought to dry age with honey. I'm not surprised with how tender it turned out
next 35 days in honey then 35 days regular dry aged....

You did not put the Manuka honey steak in a sealed bag - your experiment lacks the same condition....
Man i feel like im in a museum with that music, 100% sets the mood perfectly
I do love a tender steak, but Manuka honey is ridiculous amount of money £25 a small jar is the cheapest in the UK, $34!! I love ribeye steak as love it au natural bit of seasoning room temperature, fantastic melt in the mouth.
I don't know why but I really thought when it becomes a decade spiderman would be possible in this time of year but I got to see honey does to meat and I gotta say thats better than nothing
What happens if you dry age and sou vie a steak?!
Manuka honey? Damn he's going all out
Dryaged steak in Big Mac sauce...
Honey is a natural preservative because the sugar is so concentrated that it block s moisture from getting in or out of the meat. So it stopped the dry aging process
Lol what a soothing voice
I'm from New Zealand and theres bee hives around my house that make manuka honey and we get it for free
Wouldn’t you consider that wet aged instead?

Well honey and pineapple both have enzymes that tenderize meat and people use it in brines or marinades, so dry aging would just increase the time those enzymes have to penetrate the meat.
It makes my heart cry watching all that meat turn into waste.
New Zealand has the best honey.

Honey is antibacterial and antimicrobial therefore you had no living bacteria growing as you generally would in a dry age that's why the taste was "missing something"

Why didn't you try  Crystalized Honey. I would have more like a dry rub ???
Are the dry age bags porous plastic?  I thought the point of dry aging was to reduce moisture.  In a sealed bag it will just swim in its own lysosomes.
No! Manuka Honey is Expensive as Hell! Nope, Thank you! LOL, LVL, LOL!
try dry age with dried mushroom powder
Its not runny because it's crystallised  warm it up and it will be normal
Guga this is off the topic regarding what youre showing.  But still in the meat dry aging department. I bought an 18lbs NY strip with a small bone in each section.. Can I still use the Umai dry age bag for the Ribeye/striploin? It says 12-16lbs.  Would you recommend cutting the entire piece in half and dry aging 2 halfs?  Or would you recommend the sausage maker dry age bag?
That... doesnt look like honey... looks like caramel
Wow 😍😍  I love meat. Your channel makes me happy 💕💕
One of these days Guga will have 2 of the same steak just to mess with Angel
What went wrong? Isn't honey antimicrobial?

Watching you guys is so much fun... actually, I think it became even more fun over time.
sooo, don't take this the wrong way, but dry aging appears like a big waste of good meat.
That was the most expensive waste of honey ever. Also… in order to “store” the meat. You submerge it in honey. Dont lather it on. That honey is rich yes but you need it to run so it can have things stuffed into it. That is expensive thick honey. That isnt good for storing.
That's why you can cook meat with honey and not have it turn out bad in Breath of the Wild.
What grill do you use I had a big green egg but got blown away in last storm we had
Too much salt. Why does everyone use so much salt to season? You don't need that much..
Next video be like I dry aged steak with air
this would be neat if you didn't waste so much of the meat..
I'm a fan and learned a lot about sous vide cooking from you. I notice that you are no longer using sous vide and have seemed to have returned to conventional cooking over a fire! Why?  I have developed my own technique for cooking filet mignon steaks that is very consistent. I do the reverse sear in a hot cast iron frying pan with grape seed oil, followed by a little bit of blow torch on the edges.
is anyone else salivating at this? this is full-on carnivore/meat lovers porn haha
might be easier to dry age the meat in honey if you had a large container you could just submerge the meat into.
Dry aged in melted dark chocolate.  Could even experiment with the cocoa content
Was Salt and pepper added or was it just the experiments?

In my country, people put meat in big honey jars filled with fresh honey and keep it there few weeks (they don’t use fridges). I don’t know it’s call dry ageing or not but meat taste like heaven.

The thing about honey is that it's also a natural anti-biotic and you can actually treat wounds with it after cleaning them out.  The honey will prevent infection.    In this same regard, this is why people use honey in places where it's not possible to dry age a steak due to no refrigeration, etc.  The honey is a natural preservative and keeps bugs, germs, etc. from penetrating the meat (you can't leave it by ant mounds,  com'on...)  So, it makes perfect sense that this works, even with the hassle (and that honey had to be expensive).   Thanks for the ideas. Now, if you could do those things justice and actually cut them straight...  Sacrilege!  😉   U can't bring myself to go beyond 129°f, then let 'em come up to 132° in the rest.  Perfection!  😉

Dry aging is extremely wastefull huh
Could try the honey dry age again so that you put the honey covered steak in a dry ageing bag. It might help with keeping the honey in place and allow for proper drying.
Just quick tip guga..please use different spoon etc when spread honey..the nutrient in honey are not metal friendly
The honey contains peroxides Wich caused the oxidation and rancidity, manuka also has higher levels of theses peroxides contributing to it's more medical use for healing protecting and cleaning wounds. It's also extremely expensive Wich is a definite to mention
next time use Ayahuasca

Guga! PLEASE dry age a steak with COOKIE DOUGH. Please do it if you read this comment!!!!
Where are my food wars fans at?
After putting the honey on the meat put it into a vacuum chamber and remove all the air inside the beef and release the valve for the air to enter slowly. The honey should enter into the core of the beef faster and you should not get green mould outside. Should be able to do it in less time (days). Maybe experiment a bit to find the perfect time combination. Strange idea but sometimes crazy things leads to new discovery.
Hello not so fresh.

Honey actually tends to absorb and attract water, it's a viscous sugary substance that will crystallise if stored incorrectly, though it doesn't go off... Usually. Honey also has antibacterial properties due to certain emzines... Its actually a pretty good on small wounds you just need to cover them well after the fact so nothing else can get in, insects are not your friend in your wound. If you want to dry age with honey, it should be in an environment where not water, not even vapour from another dry age can get to it. It's like salt, it attracts and absorbs water. If you hang a bag of salt in a dry room during the rainy season with the window barley cracked, within a few days water will start to appear in the bag or dripping from it. Just some information...
Shokugeki no Soma. This video reminds me of that show.
I marinated a piece of beef in straight honey in the fridge, sealed and its turning almost black...should I still try cooking it?
Ok, this is so far out there that I would be almost impossibly convinced it would even be real. Can you find some way to dry age a steak in concrete? It would be impossible for any moisture, liquid, oxygen, any element to get inside and touch the steak. I can only imagine the effects. Would it rot the steak? Would the steak still be the exact same like the second it was covered? Would the juices somehow leak out of the concrete? Would the bag dissolve? Who's to know. Guga, I challenge you to try this. It might be the next big thing in America. Who knows?

You need to drop it into a jar of honey.
Because honey tenderizes meat, you should have really tried it on brisket, chunk or another tough part - no?
@ 7:27 ...."if you know me, you know i don't like to waste any food".....what a joke!  Uses the Dry Aged method and cuts more than half of the meat away.

Where can I find dry aging bags
I’ve never had dry aged yet. I’ve got to try it
No we could see the meat wrinkle as it was pressed with the knife cut. Ultimately tender

I hate manuka honey. First off, it tastes pretty bad for being honey, its basically medicinal nonsense with a bunch of live bacteria literally blended into it. This makes the honey granulated and makes it a paste rather than a liquid. Second, the fake 'natural remedy' bullshit where it is treated as a miracle cure and people dying of cancer and organ failure are encouraged to eat tons of it believing it will cure them.

Interesting because honey is the only food that lasts forever.
Manuka isn't special in consistency, you just never had regular crystalized honey. it looks the same as Manuka, and is tasty. Commercial honey is preserved to not crystalize, but it's better when crystalized imo
Yeah... You probably shouldn't be surprised that covering it in sugar and leaving it to waste for 34 days would result in it going at least a little bad.
Best job ever.

Ur not gonna dry aged it with a toothpaste?
Given how many times Guga has mentioned that the dry age flavor is overpowering in the bones and also that sous vide intensifies and infuses flavors -- my thought is that he should just try putting the bones in the bag from a separate dry aged rib roast when he sous vide cooks an *unaged* steak to see if that flavor makes its way in.  If that actually works, it could be a worthwhile way to combat the losses that seemed especially bad with this experiment.  * The irony is that I'm a vegetarian, and I'm still curious to see how this would unfold.
Someone's been watching food wars lol
You should really compete with Jordan Ramsey You will be so good at cooking😁👍
guga really dry aged a steak with the world's most expensive honey... what a chad

Dry age with Honey and Pineapple.
What you did wrong on the honey roast was let it sit honey is like tar its a perpetual liquid that moves slowly you should have bagged it
Why don't put the meat with honey inside the dry age bag?
Drop the honey, still-in-jar, into a double boiler to heat it up just slightly. Make it even just a little easier to spread.
didn't yo mama tell you not to play with liberals brains
IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD RIGHT NOW, BUT WATCH THIS!
Not surprised it worked that well. They've even found relatively well-preserved jars of honey in Egyptian pyramids, and the honey was still edible (after scraping off the gross top layer).
Guga! You the man!
This is a very interesting experiment Guga, but I had an idea that would make the best of both worlds here. What if you dry aged the meat like normal for 30-34 days, then take it out remove the pellicle and cover it in honey (or any other kind of enzymes) for 1-5 days. I’m interested to see how tender that would become, if it would retain the dry aged flavor and if it would incorporate the flavor of your tenderizer on top of the dry aged.
too much salt.....

Why don't you sous vide them?😋
What happend is that you fu..ed up steaks
Keep the steak -- I need that knife.  Anyone know what it is?
Gonna be short & sweet:  - This inspires me to cook more. - Now I want steak. - Dope experiment. - You've gained a subscriber.
the honey is best used as an overnight tenderizer. and as something to pan fry the steak in along side a little butter.   salt,  pepper, butter, and honey? can't go wrong.

Dry age a steak in bacon grease
When human blood dry aging?
No mold on the meat. Thats crazy what honey can do
A video i love to see: 1. Buy a one dollar steak. 2. put it in pineapple. 3. Inject fat. 4. drygage.
damn... is it weird that i come here for the grill montages? 😅
Burnt and overcooked. Whyyyy?!
Bro that honey looked like amber And amber is one of my favorite gems
Next episode: "I dry aged a steak in my pocket."
Try Dry-aged steak in beef bullion
you should dry age it with dogsh*t and see what happens
Finally honeyyy
Honey isn't dry, so its more of a wet aging process.
So forgive me if this is a dumb question, but why do you cut off all of the meat that the coating penetrated? Wouldn't that be the most tenderized and flavorized part? Just seems like a waste to not even try it.
Please! I would love to see you do an experiment for Thanksgiving: Dry age 4 Turkeys - 1 in butter, 1 in bacon grease, 1 in alcohol (not sure what type would go best with Turkey. If it were pork Tenderloin I would say Kraken Rum, but turkey 🤷‍♀️) 1 plain dry age.  Also- can you dry age steaks in whipped bone marrow?
Do you know Joe? Joe mama.
Some ppl like getting sticky.
I wonder what they’d turn out like if you basted the steaks with honeybutter
Dry aged in cannabis rosin
Fun fact the anime known as food wars actually showed how fast and the effects of honey is to meat. Though main character Soma he was doing a pot roast in the anime I never thought you could get these results with the steak These are always fun videos to watch.
I learned this trick from "Food Wars" cooking manga. 😂 It's awesome. If you are on a budget, you can use the honey method to upscale the cheapest cuts of meat. I bet those honey dry-aged steaks tasted wonderful!
The strange confirmation internally shock because domain cytochemically risk failing a quaint knee. lamentable, impossible link

After watching this, I'll say don't watch this while eating something else, as I now wonder what a Marmite dry aged steak might taste like.
It's nothing sexual.
wow finally my idea, i write about  this months ago,comment under another dry age video ,it looks delicious
Is there a reason for the 35 days period?
Dry age in mustard.
Next episode, i google a basic question, take the top answer from any website (reddit in this case LOL) and then try to make bank on my overall lack of culinary knowledge.
Meat simp
souma already did this
heat the honey lighylu dip it with tongs
I feel like experiments that produce so much food waste should be invalid
Manuka is a New Zealand honey and is BEYOND BEAUTIFUL
I've been to New Zealand and tried the Manuka Honey and it's like a mix of butter, nutella and honey. It's not really liquid-y  So you can even chew it(i am probably the only that does that) So all in all Very good(expensive tho)
You can’t dry age in honey, that’s an oxymoron.
What happens if you get a huge slab of meat, dry age it, remove the pellicles, dry age it again, and repeat? I wonder how it'll react
The lemmino of food
NEXT TIME: DRY AGED DRY AGED, COVER IT IN DRY AGED STEAK STRIPES
There is a honey in brazil called bracatinga. It has very little sugar and many enzymes.
what a waste of really worthy resources
stop making me hungry broh
seeing manuka honey used like this a little bit of my soul died
please dry-age an IBERICO SECRETO!!!
I dry age my steaks with a seasoned cutting board.
"If you know me, I don't like to waste ANY food" after watching him throw away half the meat from the dry age..... Hypocrite much?
12 free with a purchase
Seems like a lot of waste, regardless of the dry-aging method used. Now I´m not denying that its probably delicious, just saying that I´m not a fan of wasting that much meat.
The Manuka Honey probably cost more than the beef!
You should've tried a regular honey...you know, because most, if not all, viewers are regular peasants. Do another one with regular and compare.
As long as it’s “to the max”!
He dry aged steak in Manuka honey???? What a waste!
"Regular honey" may very well be some corn syrup concoction.  Honey is the third most adulterated food in the world.  If you don't know where your honey came from, it might not be honey, or may only be partially honey.  A lot of commercial honey is heating during processing, which can destroy enzymes.  They also filter out the pollen.  When you say, "This honey is delicious", it makes me think that maybe you've never had real honey.
Manuka honey is like natures neosporin, great treatment for burns and cuts.  It tastes sweet and savory, kind of like a tobacco flavor, but is expensive because it is imported from New Zealand.
Angel needs to lose that man bun, bro what you doing?
hello brother guga i am poor man from norway and would like you to make me some food one day, you very good cook and your food look like food <3
Why don't you try dry aging in the dry age bag next time you do a liquid based dry age
honey is a great tenderiser in other country, it the exact some in every country my guy, the honey dont magicly switch from place to place.
Thank you for the experience
Try  honny and butter mix
Whoa... whoa... "Unlike regular honey it's not runny" ?! If it's runny, it's not real honey at all. It's a mixture of honeys and water based sugar syrups, because real honeys crystalize to some degree over time.
Even google says emzymes. Now you are just trolling, Guga.
I first learnt about honey back in 2015 in Shokugeki no Soma.
Where are the girls? Why  does he never invite girls to taste the meat :D ?
You guys are great. I bought your vacuum sealer dry age starter kit last year for Fathers day and he absolutely LOVES IT. I love watching these weird experiments you do and appreciate that you do these experiments so I don't waste my fathers time or his guga dry age membranes xD
Guga: Manuka honey? Never heard of it. Me: _Laughs in New Zealand_
I don't think this is the first experiment in the world where u marinate meat in honey. However, it might be for dry age?
I only knew Honey could tenderize like pineapple cuz of Food Wars💀
You did you the thickest one though if you used the more watery one it be  a thinner spread
Every home in New Zealand, just about, has a jar of manuka honey. Great on toast. Lovely in hot chocolate or ™Milo. If you like honey, I suggest you try both thyme and borage honeys.  Thyme is a phenomenal honey. Like velvet but in a good way.
Instructions unclear covered self in honey
sorry but CONNIE THIS YOU?
As a Kiwi (New Zealander), it hurt me watching Guga ruin all that beautiful (AND EXPENSIVE) Manuka Honey, OMG!
dry age it with onions
u should do pineapple vs honey
Americans invented fast food so they dont have to use knives and forks...You would think with all their technology they could at least learn how to use a knife & fork.
Next episode: "I dry aged steak in concrete and this happened"
It is well known that covering food with honey will preserve it even for years, as the ancestors did. Honey never expires, it is eternal, because it is a bactericide, a natural fungicide; and a virus killer.
make actual content
when I watched this, I suddenly had some Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma flashbacks
Dude I love manuka honey. My mom has given it to us since we were kids for everything from scrapes to a sore throat. It works wonders at healing wounds and curing small ailments
Make a video on how you grill steaks please
Dude I work from home..... Stop making me hungry while I work!! lol
New Zealand Manuka honey is great, but you should try Australian native bee honey. Mmmm delicious
Tenderize the meat first. Leave it marinating for 1-3 days. Wash it off. Dry it off with towels. Then dry age it. ;)

he looks lile adin ross😂
I hate guga. He makes the best food and he baits us into watching him eat it 😂
Next episode: "I dry-aged myself in dry-aged steak"
Next time you should play a practical joke on Angel. Make your "control group" a lesser steak dry age it half the time then for your "experiment" dry age some Wagu. Then once he declared the experiment better than the control tell him you dry aged it in seaman. lol I grantee 50 million views.
Dry aging is controlled rotting. Bone marrow rots much faster than muscle.  Limit the thickness to under  2" and cut the time in half. Vacuum seal the meat with honey and the "oxidation" will be self limiting.
Guga : You can use honey to tenderize meat Fans of the anime Food Wars : we know it was in episode 3
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)~
Manuka honey? Never heard of it 🤣🤣
I hope u will use honey to tenderize 1 dolar steak next time
I’m a vegan and still love watching these 😂
That feeling when your meat turns to mush
this guy wasted the manuka
Thats fake honey real honey is hard
I dry aged steak in honey and this happened         DOCTOR BEEEEEEES
Why you're honey so thicc
Bro you are a meat god damn now I want some meat for real
For some just reading lately, manuka honey is super super super expensive and it is very anti-bacterial, you can use it on leg ulcers and dry skin spots on your body and it will help medically too.
I love manuka honey
I like the way the young guy just digs into the steak when Guga is talking. haha
i was hoping for some sticky jokes but i see everyone heres pretty mature
Maybe try a honey and peanut butter mix?
This episode was intense...
Seeing Guga use NZ Manuka Honey makes me wonder how he'd do with a Hangi.
Eyy angel is back!
That's an expensive experiment between the lost meat and the manuka honey.
Does grill marks enough to make a vegan go mad
Why didn't you dry age the honey in a bag?  I feel that could have been better for the honey to penetrate the meat.
Thanks, I was just enjoying the video and suddenly had a desire to consume large amounts of steak. Good stuff!
Manuka honey is the best of the best and very expensive

Hey Guga I was wondering if you have seen Biscoff cookie butter? It’s super good and would love to see a dry age experiment with it
Does it still count as dry aged when its aging in something that does not dry it out? Or is it just " aged" ?
I wonder what kind of honey it is. Raw or processed.
Have you tried brahman hump steak? seriously it does look like waygu but i'm curious about the taste. Next make an brahman hump steak vs wagyu
I would give anything to have dinner at this man's house. His steaks look absolutely amazing
hey guga, I have a recommendation if you decide to try doing the honey dry age experiment again. warm the honey up in the microwave or in a water bath for a short bit, while stirring occasionally. this will make the honey more runny, and easier to spread over the meat. As it cools, it will conform to the steak and will provide better coverage.
I really need someone to make a gif of 13:25  It seems like this is his reaction every time haha
@gugafood could you please try a dry age or marinade with Narsharab sauce?
Meat sweats!
Suggestion!: Dry age steak in honey, pineapple, and chili

Hi'
Regular honey" you mean corn syrup
But how come you dont pour honey in a container and submerge the meat?
brazilians, enough said
do you dry brine the steak after you dry age it?
Honey has some water in it, so idk if it counts as "Dry aged"
i have been using manuka honey for wound care for our cat who has a one inch strip of skin missing all the  way around her foot  (its nature neosporin) it is antibacterial and antifungal

High production value. I thought i was looking at an ad when he started grillin
Man I wish I had a relative that cooked steak this much. I love medium rare steak, I used to eat it well done until I tried it medium rare after that I would never order it over medium
Can you make a well done steak please
I would like to see a video, in which you using mango coal.
funny the beginning i learned from food wars :D didint eve need to look it up
Dry age Angel
Come on, when can i get a dry-aged in cheese?
"Doesn't run like honey" or you've just got a real honey instead of the orange sugar syrup Americans think is honey.  Real honey should crystallise when cold, and be runny when hot.
Oh my God.. thats not honey.. what the hell..
Fun fact: Manuka honey has medicinal properties. And it’s freaking expensive.
Aged sure, but not dry-aged.
I noticed at 7:04, you are drinking the same tea I drink a lot. That's one more thing we both like.
10:30 when corrina farts in my air vents
NEXT EPISODE WAGU BEEF JURKY
That was lower grade Manuka, but still expensive for an experiment.
Lol picked the bigger one to regular dry age. Smart man. If it turns bad got the one you know is good.
Legit the most expensive way to dry age... manuka honey is approximately $80/kg...
i kicked guga in his teeth and this is what i got 🤕
my dude spent like 300 dollars on honey
To all the people saying yeah right to guga not wanting to waste food, he doesn't, anyone who knows anything about cooking knows it is sometimes unavoidable depending on what your cooking or how your cooking it, it's then not a matter of want but the circumstance, and your watching a dry aging video so no shiz this isn't going to be the most conservative experiment, but experiments and requests are what feeds this channel, and they do a lot more than dry aging where no food goes to waste  Edit: not to mention after all of it they even say it's not worth it. These experiments aren't always a win, nor a total loss in some cases, they point out what's cool about it but also address the amount of work and waste involved, they're honest.
wooaauauahauhuahuh it smells wonderful 10:30
This man prob has steaks all over his fridge
What about honey butter?
it's enzymes not emzymes
Marniate cheap steak with Michelada mango
I learned this from Food Wars
0:58 Does this not look like the fattest glob of dab wax? Like damn lemme rip that
It's impressive he did not brag about the price of the honey, Manuka is one of the most expensive honeys on the market if not the most expensive out there.
Now I'm curious. Tenderizing methods after dry aged.  Is it worth it to marinate in pineapple after a dry age?
Omg, meat pr0n.  I fricking love meat pr0n!  Anybody else?
What a waste!
BWAAAAHH Charcoal ... taste The Meat Not The HEAT
I think a better way to do the experiment would be to put a lot of honey in a container and then sink the beef in there. Air does not penetrate through honey if it's completely sealed.
Listen man COCO BUDDER
That honey is far from cheap by the way
What if you put the honey covered steak INSIDE the bag?
Amazing video again Guga. But we gotta chill out on the zoom ins next time
what if you slathered it in honey and then put it in a dry age bag
Honey is also antibacterial.
I always turn off the volume, that makes me feel slightly less stupid
Honestly... do you know how many times I've watched these episodes and IMMEDIATELY afterwards gone to the store and bought steaks??? My grill thanks you.
Dry age steaks in chocolate powder?  What about marinating steaks in a soup mix or a nacho cheese?
SUGGESTION!!!  try dryaging a ribeye steak in a combo of infused bearfat and butter crust on the outsider. ❤️🤘💸
For the next time try just letting the Manuka Honey sit for 5 days, that should be enough for the Honey to penetrate the meat and the enzymes to work.
0:34 LOL Guga, did you purpously find a site that spelled enzyme eMzyme just so you wouldnt be wrong in your previous videos? ^^
this reminds me of food wars
presentation is simply amazing.
Can you please try to make A5 wagyu beef belly burnt ends and roast wagyu beef belly with beef crackling (like roast pork belly with crackling) please?
pineapples actually break down meat the quickest that's why when we eat pineapple they hurt our tongue a bit but when we swallow it the stomach acid kills the enzyems
Bruhhhh he is using Manuka honey what the hell omg bruh that stuff is so rare I want it duhbduhduhbdygdbhu
Episode idea: dry age is oil/ fat
Any moment now as they taste the honey one.  Their clothes explode and they both become bees frolicking in the sun
Warm the honey. Pout it like syrup or dip in a bowl. you had very poor coverage with your spreading cold technique, let a lot of air in.
Ponytail sounds like he had a stroke.
5:21 Beef.
Next do it with Cow dung
you basically threw out half of the meat, what a waste.
Do you use any specific kind of salt? That amount of salt with the salt i use would make this so salty. All my meats needs less than half. Of that even less if is thinner
I Must Say These Experiments Of Yours Waste Quite A Lot Of Meat😅
But it's not dry aged... Anything you age in a liquid is wet aged...
Next episode: “I dry-aged steaks in wagyu beef fat”

It seems a shame to waste so much meat. I get the idea is to improve the steak etc. But you wasted over a whole steak worth of meat that could have fed someone.
Cool video guga, when we cook a roast chicken we cook it breast up, would you be able to cook it breast down because all the juices will run to the breast and compare with a breast up roast
Can you please do the brazilian parmesan steak??
Guga, dry age a steak in regular honey in a dry age bag.
You should dry age with actual soil
Now try to undryage a stake
Dry aged is just another way of saying decomposed.
Black people need to be more like dry aged steak…Less resistance
Nobody: Guga: But it is!
You should dry age a wagu a7 with honey lol bet you won’t but instead of covering it one time cover it periodically like 3 times
im taking my tastebuds on a vacation this summer, and trying more of these experiments for myself. lots of love Guga!

Hey guys can you just make a cheap video. Go to s upermarket and pick out some cheaper prime steaks with good marbling and go back to the basics. Sear and then indirect vs indirect then sear. I'd enjoy it and i think your viewers would too.
Why am I watching this before lunch? This is torture.
So even in cooking I can’t escape stupid clickbait videos
Can you try doing the pineapple method with wagyu fat Injection
He looked like he was about to cry when he smelt the steak
welp. I already had all the knowledge thanks to food wars
I've always been told to not flip a steak more than once. Is that just a fable?
Should've done a regular round of tenderising instead. Honey is great for sauces and marinades, but I don't think it will ever work for dry ageing on its own.
The honey dripped off, which is likely why some spoiled. Maybe if u vaccuum sealed the honey steak?
Can we all just notice that Angel cut off the fat.  He's getting spoiled over here.
First "expert" that I have seen that cooks meat over flare-ups.
Manuka honey is sooo expensive  omg 😲 😂you're  so rich🙂💫
YES, A HONEY A GOOD EXPERIMENT
Although dry aging is nice to have sometimes. I feel like you waste so much of the meat when you have to cut off the bad parts.
not sure why you're simping for hello fresh when we all know you cook all your meals
Guga food is down 1 if they keep this new person for taste test , no it doesn't work would rather you by yourself
We're is taste tester mama he's the best , you need a man to get a positive idea on mean the new young guy is like yeah nah
Get rid of your taste tester he's a youth Wana be, keep him in l def not watch your vids but hey I'm just one guy you don't care
Hello fresh hahahahah it's silly not worth paying for it.. I have not got it for myself but I have had a friend who recved it , the company understood the number of family member but they sent out enough for for about a family of 3 after they were told father , mother , 4 children.. when I told them they said sorry you have to contact customer service . No one thinks what are the below poverty line people are doing , most people just wish we die off , I wish I've tried such good meat and I wish I wasn't out down for being low poverty
In ancient days they covered there food near, farmed veges they covered in honey to preserve to keep it for longer
Honey is a preservative ...
I don’t think you can call it dry aged. More like marinated 35 days in honey.
Manuka honey is really expensive because humans rely on buzzing bees to harvest and they do not get given the harvest lands they need
MANUKA HONEY IS  NOT YOUR EVERY DAY HONEY, No it is not, it is only found front New Zealand and Australia, manuka is a common hardwood tree grown in the areas of those countries
I'm not a specialist, but maybe you could avoid the oxidation problem by immersing the meat completely in honey.
Try garlic cloves fermented in raw honey.  Those were found in Egyptian Tombs and were still edible.  The finished cloves are more pungent than black garlic, but the honey can be used in salad dressing.  Just don't heat because that will destroy probably most of the health benefits.  Black garlic is just regular garlic fermented at about 140d f for a month.
You should run an experiment of Manuka vs regular honey?
U  should use wagyu to do a Greek gyros wrap with pita bread
Hey Guga can you buy the same cut of steak from different supermarkets and see which one tastes the best?
What if you covered the inside of a bag thing with honey and then stick the steak in and age it to maybe help with the oxidation?
get a discount coupon from honey
This is the perfect chanel for vegans xD
Please work on your grill marks. Would look better.
Wow, seems like more of a WASTE of expensive honey.
Smoke a watermelon to taste like a ham!
Why no vacuum bag for the honey steak? Have to do it again to see if there is a difference. Also might lose less meat.
Lets try dry aging with honey in a dry age bag, then sous vide it for 35 days.  Yeah?
Old meat
“MMMMMMM DARLING AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH”
Good old NZ manuka honey, has so many health benefits and its anti-microbial so probably why tastes different and you could probably eat the left overs of honey that is
Could you warm the honey slightly to make it easier to spread?
I have something tht i really wanna know for a long time what salt is the best for steak
This angel guy is freaking boring
What the heck this guy's fake laughter...he can change from smiling happily to a serious face in less than half an second, what a hypocrite
Anyone here because of food wars
You've com a great long way and I think i'ts awesome you're working with Hello Fresh, they absolutely provide a great service and product for people. But you sir, have some brilliant videos and they've only got better and better. Thanks for your videos :)
Dip it in your own turd and see what happens.
Cook a dry aged sous vide a5 wagyu well done
Too many waste but for an experiment it's ok
Nothing quite like watching a Hellofresh ad while eating a hellofresh meal
I pressume this would taste way better if you used a soup type of meat instead of bbq
From a New Zealander: Manukau honey has health benefits as well, it has natural antibiotic that only Manukau flower has. The higher the + number the more effective it is.
That guy reminds me of Sid from Ice Age.
I watch Food Wars before so i know the effects of honey:)
Not sure if anyone commented this before but Guga, you should try a impossible meat experiment. Like purchase the best impossible patty/sausage, try to make your own impossible patty/sausage and then make ur own real one. And see which one is best! (I mean we know which one would be best but the reaction will be priceless)
Pretty sure at this point guga is a master at cooking steaks because he’s for sure passed his 5000 hours mark after all these yt videos
There is no other channel that makes me want a steak more than yours.
I almost ate my cell phone 🤣🤣
You might think this is crazy  Everyone who watched food wars: Wait till you get to covering squid with peanut butter
What about dry aged steaks in wagyu fat
I wish the honey steak was also put in a vacuum pocket to avoid the oxidization
02:48 - Also going to be the most expensive dry age you've ever done, you just dropped $20 worth of honey on that steak!
Do a dry age in caviar!
Chinese apothecaries travelling the Silk Road would rarely have an item known as "mellified man," human tissues preserved in honey. Eastern medicine would probably call it an aphrodisiac to make you harder than Chinese algebra. I can neither confirm nor deny this claim.
Your Honey Dry Aged Steak made me wonder; what would a Beeswax Dry Aged Steak be like?
Every single edge huh? what about that patch on the bottom left at 2:43
So basically, you did this so we would never have to, and we should not try it at home 😂
Pep is always added after the cook!
Guga lives by Kendall?!?!
I wanna see a video called "Guga's last meal" and while he's not on death row, I would love to know what Guga would do for his #1 most epic meal... Dry aged Wagyu A5 Picanha + MSG + Butter of the Gods + ???? Or something completely different? What would it be!? What cooking method? Sous vide? Smoked? Charcoal grill? Cast iron?  What would be your "last meal" Guga?
"I dry-aged steaks in mud and this what happened"
Angel look like Tekashi Snitch9
Next : dry aged with wasabi
Looks like cheese
“But IT IS” 😂🤣
"Dry aging" beef with things that are wet.   Sounds a lot like "marinating".
'I dry aged these steaks by blasting them with synthwave'
Why does this recommend me at 2 am?
Why does this recommend me at 2 am?
When I lived in China, the area we lived in didn't really have beef. The 'beef' was actually water buffalo or ox. Usually they were also working animals that died so the meat was _extremely_ tough. We would marinate the meat in papaya juice for  4 hours. For real, good beef I would probably suggest trying 1 hour then seeing how it turns out. It worked wonderfully and gave the meat a surprisingly pleasant fruity aftertaste.
its not dry aged .. but it is.. but its not ... but it is ...
That honey looks like some quality THC wax
Dry age in cement please Guga. You are a man of science and doing impressive work!
lemon demon sweet bod
Next time GUGA.  dry age SPAM
I don’t care what it tastes like I’m not wasting that much perfectly good meat
Rumor is, he went to Walmart and bought this...
It Looks ugly on the outside, But believe me it is Juicy and tender on the inside
Guga "If you know me, you know I don't like to waste any food"  Yea right 😒  Goes ahead to dry age every beef and ends up cutting off and throwing away a huge amount of it...that's a good way to not waste any food😏
10:13 is where it lost any credibility as an experiment by making him think something was off about it
That's a good Medium Rare   I see you out here man, but one thing more touching your meat less using the theometer   At the same time good Medium Rare My Friend
Try dry aging pork
Guga, please do a dry-age experiment with Durian fruit!
Wouldn't this technically be considered wet aging?
age with onions.
normally u dip inside a tub of honey and not let any air in.  so honey would be more appropriate for wet aging.  I think it was used alot in damascus
Oh My God So great to find you in my feed!
Yes angels back
Uhh...Guga:  Please notice that the honey you selected is advertised as being 'anti-bacterial.'  How can you develop a dry-aged tang with that?  I believe you also discarded MORE of the honey-aged meat than was necessary.
Meat so tender you can see the surface wrinkle when he cuts it, damn!
This is called wet aged... Because honey is not dry...
Honey dry age an eye of round. Since the enzyme soften the meat, I am curious how that works out.
How about taking a cheap steak and coating it with cheap real supermarket honey and let it set for an hour or overnight (much like you would do with salt) and see what happens. This would be more like an average person would have at home. We don’t buy a whole roast coat it with an expensive, special order over the internet honey, only to let it set in the refrigerator and rot(age). We go to Walmart, ALDI, Supersavers, or any local supermarket franchise in the area and purchase a $15.00 steak (more or less) not a $50.00 roast which after aging, trimming we get a $10.00 steak.(a  delicious steak but still a $10 steak) love your videos keep smiling and try using cheaper ingredients but I’m betting it’ against your nature.
Ah, but what about as a simple tenderizer.
Make a food with smoke cheese
Dry age steaks on chili powder. Come on lets make some experiment.
cook aged meat with tamarind paste!
You cover it in a paper thin layer then cut off 80% of the steak lmao of course it doesn't do anything.
But that much manuka honey is going to cost more than the whole steak, thats like a $10-$30 jar of honey, FOR ONE STEAK
Reminds me of Yukihira Souma's beef bourguignon made in 30 minutes using honey marinate that made the never smiling Sensei smiled..
I love this man's voice.
Honey is good for marinating beef.  1 cup honey, spices, salt, 1/2 lemon some water if your honey is to hard. Put in a plastic bag with your stakes and leave it over night. Then grill.
1:28 Non-heated honey is like that. Not just Manuka honey. If the nectar is high in glucose it will always produce crystals which gives the honey this property. Your "regular honey" from walmart is just crappy colored rice/corn syrup. I have tried lots of different honey and Manuka is prolly the most branded honey out there. It's like Apple™ of honeys. My locally produced clover honey is equal in properties and nutrition value. Even the taste is pretty much the same. Only difference is the color and size of the crystals  :D Don't buy into this BS. Buy honey straight from the local beekeeper and I promise you get the same benefits.   Disclaimer: I am not saying people shouldn't buy Manuka honey because of it's price. If you can afford it then you can of course buy it. I'm just saying people shouldn't spend their money on a well branded product just because they believe it has some miracle properties over others when it actually does not.
You should get a big container and completely submerge the 2 bone roast in a gallon or more of honey so its definitely sealed.
If I ever go to the restaurant, I'd go to your house instead
Oh its from shokugeki no soma but u like mimasaka subaru joke only :)
Dry age in Coconut cream??
I love how he sounds like General Burkhalter from Hogan’s Hero’s when he gets going about how sticky the honey is.  My next experiment, honey and pineapple 24 hour marinade.
I just want to marry Angel and cook steaks for him every day.
Try to make Dry Aged A5 Wagyu jerky.
That's not even real honey
Some say's weed make the meat delicious, you should try it Guga
I request more ground beef experiments. maybe one with honey anoter without
This really is pointless.  You take top quality prime meat and " make it better".  What a skill.  So people with no teeth can eat it.  Oh, that's right...people with no teeth cannot afford the meat you show.   Consider that you took about $60 in meat and put $30 to $50 in honey on it to get one steak...great.  I'd pay less at a restaurant for the entire meal and have none of the hassle.    How about you try doing something helpful like show people methods to prepare low end cuts...you know, cuts they can afford...so that they eat better.
New Zealand
who else thought honey was sponsoring this vid
If Honey is runny or not has absolutely nothing to do with the kind of honey, but with post-harvesting techniques by the beekeeper.
Try human milk see if that's any good
not even just the steak looks dry, they honey as well, is that real honey?

Hey, Guga.. I'm just saying bro, I can do a lot of your chores if you'd like if you only let me come over for a little bit of food bro..
You used the most expensive honey out there 😂😂😂
You literally missed a spot no jokes
I am no expert by any means Guga but I can tell you that you waste too much meat when trimming. Every time. Sorry man. Love your videos.
One word: mellification.
New Zealand honey💯
Food Wars thaught me about honey being a good tenderizer
I learned that honey can tender the  meat in anime
most honey on store shelves in the usa is fake. Just sugar and water. Read the label & see whats in it before buying so you know you are getting real honey.
I love all of your vids, but it feels you either need to back up from the mic or get a pop filter for the first up close description and breakdown. For the rest, it's is perfect.
It's crazy to know that by the time we see a video, due to the fact that almost all of your videos are aging things, you're already busy aging some other batshit experiment.
Pick a local honey?
try Onions Water.. 4 onions and one tomato get the water of them dip the steak on it for 1 hour 😋 and tell us how did it taste ..
I hate seeing meat wasted but these results are amazing.
Try dashi powder on steaks in an experiment style like this. The smoke flavor & umami from the dashi might work well, who knows!

Not really dry aged if you put honey around it. I think that's basically equivalent to it being wet. So maybe marinating instead

Imagine what it can do to your eyes
I’d love to see some more experiments with the honey since you and Angel enjoyed the steak way more than most other experiments
Try the honey on a 1$ steak
wasteful
should try this again but with crystalized honey
This is like from the anime food wars
You should take a regular cut of meat and do it not a prime rib which is already delicious. Try it on a sirloin to see how it affects the meat.
Hi Guga! I hope you are well! Sure hope the price of all meat goes down soon. Pretty crazy prices around our area. Take care.
“The honey really PENETRATED the MEAT” Ahahahahahahahaha
I didn't think this sounded crazy at all... crazy delicious, maybe 🤷🏼‍♂️
use honey syrup
I get it now! Guga has a fetish for spreading stuff on meat.
You know when you're driving down a long highway and you smell that roadkill in the wind?

Try aging steaks in saki
This is very wasteful. Great steak from pasture raised cows is expensive and it should be. Doing this wastes a lot of it.
People eat mold all the time. Bleu cheese is moldy cheese.
You can use manuka honey as a first aid ointment on minor cuts and scrapes to prevent bacterial infection.
"if you know me you know I dont like to waste any food " = takes a $$  two bone rib eye and has to cut away so much spoiled meat after a dry age experiment gone bad, hahaha .
I do not mind the work to get sticky all over.
Waiting on his final video to consume himself whole 😭
Maybe it is good for a roast
You need to dry age beef in your own cholesterol
Top steaks as usual. Nice bass synths in the grilling section too
You should used regular honey.   However since the conclusion was don't do it, the point is moot.   Still comparing pineapple @ 2.00 and a jar of that honey @ 35.00, seems silly.
That is called "creamed Honey".
You got to do this with A5 wagyu but this time really soak it in honey! Like a inch!
Lol food wars taught me about honey instead of pineapple
Hello fresh me that steak ffs
Without having watched, I reckon this one might actually work quite well. Honey is pretty decent at preserving things because it kills mold and bacteria and all of the sugar in it might help draw out the water from the steak.   Then again, how it's gonna affect taste is of course a different story.
Why not try covering with honey, then dry age it in the bag???
NEXT: Dry-aged A5 Wagyu Steak in Manuka Honey

Dry age meat in salsa
Guga challenge: dry age in hottest chilli in the world, i kinda wanna dare you 🙂🤏
i learned this because of shokugeki lol
Can you do a video to see if you can add tenderizer  to meat,  then freeze it. I usually buy in bulk and wonder if there is a way to tenderize while its frozen.
For me it's yogurt. I often use goat-yogurt, onions, salt and pepper and it's just the best marinade ie for shashlik cubes. Pineapple has 2 disadvantages: It leaves a too fruity taste on the meat and you can't grill very close to the fire since the sugar coat on the meat will get black.
This was I dry aged a steak in DABS
man oh man!
I think moving forward the experiment steaks should be tasted first
Guga, can you make a show about “Blonde D’Aquitaine steak “ paired with “La Bonnotte potatoes”. Supposed to be the most rare and Expensive  meat and potatoes.
My favorite content creator on youtube.
It is physically impossible to dry age anything in a water based solution.  Honey is sticky, but still wet.  Learn actual terms like curing before making up stupid contradictory ones like "dry brining".
I wonder what would happen if you tenderize with pineapple, then dryage it?
i remember an episode like this in foodwars
Australian Blue or Red Gum honey, is the best honey to taste IMO,  try it!  Manuka is ok.. but.. its kina weird tasting... its more of a medical honey
What the hell is even that?
Overflipper
I just wanna try one of guga steak
That steak looked amazing raw
They did this in Food Wars
What would happen if you put on de honey and then put it in a dry age bag?

Me a vegetarian, having no idea what dry age is, no idea what even a steak is.. : Interesting..
Honey soy and garlic actually makes a good steak marinade. Don't use it on very thick steaks that you have to sear a long time because it will burn.
I like the new video format! much more enjoyable!
1. Not a dry age. 2. Enjoy the botchelism.

I feel like doing honey inside the bags would be the answer, if that's even possible.
Guga do wagyu beef jerky
I think the new music is an upgrade. I prefer the dark techno over the "texas rock" of yore.
am i the only one who hates manuka, regular honey is way better
Manuka honey is typically used by the medical community to treat burns and other wounds, post-surgery, etc.
I love Manuka honey. It's like super honey. In New Zealand they use it for lots of medicinal reasons
honey forming a seal, much less moisture can evaporate, right? so its like a wet aged steak. thats why the dry age taste might be missing
GUGA- i have a crazy idea... WAGYU MEATLOAF
You should have kept dry aged honey steak into airtight plastic or any thing airtight

Why not not put the honeyed steak in the bag as well ? May be better.... only one way to find out 😀
Hey guga! Can you and angel do a wagyu steak enema?
I agree. I'll just have a spoonful of honey on the side.
Listen to your nose guys.
2.75 million views.  Sad. All you do is a bunch of bullshit tests.  U can't dry age meat with honey.
Please stop this pornograph, beautiful voice and beaut steak, please stop. xD
It’s hard to DRY age a steak in honey since honey is a humectant. That means it honey holds moisture in or even draws moisture into things. That may be why there was bone degradation.
i saw this in anime. honey can make any meat tender. KappaPride
Me who learned this from food wars: I’m 5 parallel universe ahead of you
Not guga calling a butter knife a spatula
That is also supposed to be psychedelic honey. Look it up. The people that gather that honey get high off of it and retrieve it risking life and limb for that reason mainly...also don't forget how much of the honey in the world is fake honey, if the pollen count is too low its just sugar, water, flavoring and coloring...
my first guga video and i'm sub'd bros. ordering my dry aging gear now. entertaining vid my friends.
“It’s not runny like regular honey” Me as a Kiwi with Manuka and Clover honey everywhere: 🤨
Better off using Jack Daniels Honey to dry age 🍯
What about honey on the steak in a dry age bag?

why not put on the honey and then put it in the vacuum pack to age it
Alright guga, you’ve earned my subscription
Hello fresh is a terrible company and the food they send to people is NOT kept to safety standards im a former employee
Real , i mean real not fake honey is expensive and will get even more. Don't get me wrong but the amount of that honey cost more than the meat (i am talking about real honey) in lot of country's.
Dry age steak in wagyu fat 🤷‍♂️

Why not apply the Honey and still put it in a dry age bag?
bro whenever i see people do videos with massive slabs of steak, no matter what happens stuff makes my mouth water so hard
Hey Guga, when you do dry age experiments, why don't you also put the experiment in dry age bag as well? It seems that should guarantee a better result!
Yuhgert 😅😂😊
WOW!!! Just look at those knives behind him! WOW WOW WOW.
I live in New Zealand, we have a lot of Manuka, the bees love the pollen, it makes the best honey..
can somebody explain why took the honey with the most enzymes ?
Honey vs pineapple??
Guga should put the meat and honey in the dry age bag
i think more steaks done with different honeys would have been a nice addition to the experiment
Perhaps wrapping the sides in parchment would make you work more consistently
From what I know, apparently honey doesn't break down muscle fibers what it does do is protect the meat from the immediate heat that would cause them to contract and get tough. It's really just protecting the remaining moisture in the meat.  But, I could be wrong. I saw multiple things say that honey doesn't break down it's used in a specific type of cooking that stops moisture from being lost in meat so it stays juicy
wouldn't this really be wet-aged? can you please explain why not?
Some of these experiments are so pointless & expensive 😂😂 but curiosity always wins in Gugas case. 🤣 🤣 id have loved to eat that steak with a simple marinade made from that probably unbelievable honey 🤣
“Some are soft some are hard all are sticky” the potiental dick jokes in this video are amazing
Why don’t you get a huge bowl of honey and dunk the steak in it? Instead of spreading it yourself. Is that a stretch?
Chin beard and man-bun, the clichés never end.
You kinda sound like Samuel Taylor from life is strange 1. i can’t help but have that image in my mind of him talking about dry aging a steak with honey.
Thanks for the effort but not worth the loss. Great video though.
i put weird stuff on meats and then I talk like thiiiiis.
What if you dry aged but added the honey for the last day or 2? probably after removing the pellicles. You'd get that little plus and tenderness, but with the dry aged flavor.
Hey, is there a new editor at home? Nice.
Anyone else slightly annoyed that gigabyte always calls any aging dry aging? I love the channel, buy this one, yogurt, or any aging in a coating is not dry aging. The surface is literally not dry. The dry aging flavor comes from enzymes in the meat and the process requires oxygen. When it's coated the air is blocked off
Did hello fresh. More then half my meals were delivered and left in a room temperature area for 5 hours when theres a refrigerator in that room for the delivery guy to put food into. But never seemed to matter. So not wasting my money on them again

Anyone catch the Google suggestion about diabetes?
i really liked the video...your presentation is great and the info and background was interesting
So you aged it in honey and then removed all the parts that were affected by honey because it was faul 😅
I wonder how long it is before guga dry ages ángel….
Manuka honey is extremely expensive. Not really practical
Hello. I am only making this a comment for all to see since a few people asked for me to. When it comes to onions, garlic and leeks, absolutely do NOT store these at room temperature in cooking oil. And be very careful while adding garlic, onions and/or leeks to cooking oil even refrigerated.     Raw Garlic, leeks and onions left in cooking oil at room temperature will cause a blood-born illness called Botulism.   Botulism comes across slowly as fly like symptoms while your blood is becoming poisoned.  I almost killed my wife and three children years back because I made seasoned olive oil with fresh rosemary sprigs, raw garlic bulbs and peppercorns. I had no idea that this large bottle of olive oil was becoming toxic. By the time I found out, my family and I was almost dead.   Enjoy recipes using onions, garlic and/or leeks but be very cautious as you cannot tell if botulism has occurred.
Where do you come up with these ideas?
Winnie the Pooh wants to know your location
To me, Manuka honey, while the texture is perfect for this, has a bitter underwater I would worry about.  Maybe use whipped honey and 0lay with the different flavors.
Guga...try dry aging in JELLO!
well put in the bag so the honey stays on.
I think you need to protect the honey age steaks from air. The places where the honey coating failed lead to the meat going rancid. Either the steak should be completely submerged in honey throughout the process, or a combination of honey coating and vacuum sealing needs to happen to prevent the oxidation. I would use a the second method for a more direct comparison
My crush farts Me: 10:30

Next up: I DRY AGED STEAK IN BLUEBERRY JAM
I found manuka honey 🍯 couple years back and its to die for.
Hey Guga  - I just made fantastic burgers with some good premium steaks (Holstein), with some extra bone marrow mixed into the pattys! Gotta try it too, I paired it with some red onions jam, matured cheddar, and roasted garlic mayo... They were a bomb!
The little zoom ins definitely have added another element to the videos 😂
when i saw the thumbnail I had hopes that it finally was the salted caramel I requested last year. Which had thousands of likes too. But it's not, big mood :/
what if you warmed the honey and/or reapplied honey every few days?
That other dude looks like sixnine
Of course he went with Manuka honey. 80 bucks a jar. Dude spent 250 bucks on honey.
Yo Guga, for the next video can make pastrami from a Wagyu tomahawk ?
Seeing this honey like that made me think of peanut butter, have you done one using that yet?
how much money do you spend on meats each month because this is beyond me how much meat is wasted to do these videos
Minooka honey is medicinal, not necessarily intended for eating on things. And there’s way more than 300 types of honey period times that by 1 billion and you might come closer
What would happen if you mixed regular honey with mineral water?
🤤🤤🤤🤤
I feel like the honey would give it a floral earthy taste towards the end of the bite.
🗣ANGEL ALWAYS STEALING AS MUCH OF THE NORMAL DRY AGED STEAK AS POSSIBLE, BEFORE THE VIDEO ENDS JUST SO HE DOESN'T GET CALLED OUT BY GUGA IN FRONT OF VIEWERS, GETS ME EVERY TIME!!😂💀

How is it possible to feel hungry on a full stomach while watching this.
Hey Guga, have you ever tried to grill a 3D printed steak? We would be interested in the results.
Haven’t even watched the video and I know the steak is either going to be tender or broken down to hell               Thanks food wars
things that make you say no
Yum
Vegans: Wait you weren't supposed to do that.
Next episode they’ll use 40 more zoom ins ENJOY!
You should tallow age one but you have to make sure the tallow doesn’t crack and you will be very shocked by the results
Guga said he don't like to waste any food, but keep trolling all meat to the bin.
Dry age one in a few kinds of ice cream!
I dry aged steaks in Dr. Teals Lavender Bubble Bath with Epsom salt.   It really relaxes the muscles.
Try bone marrow dry ageing
The music and camera angles on this channel makes one feel like BBQing meat is an epic world saving level experience.
who grills in the middle of the night lol
cant stand listening to this guy
Neat experiment.  But looking at a guess on the costs: 3-bone rib roast = $75 (estimated, average quality cut) 3 8-oz jars of premium Manuka honey = $198 That's about $275 and you end up with three 1 lb steaks.
Maybe the honey is too sticky
Always happy to see Angel.
Honey is sort of a natural antibiotic... I would imagine that property would keep the bacteria usually seen in dry aging from forming.
Idk, man.  Seems like a pretty wasteful method
this is a very expensive way of dry aging. Manuka Honey is the most expensive type of honey i know so far
You can also cook tough stakes of tough beef in a crock pot or can it.  It come out juicy tender and wonderful.  You can add vegetables,  make it a stew or soup.  There is so much you can do,  rather then put it in a plastic bag for 30 days
just found your channel, i call this day a win
2:38 hehe yeah boai
it would be runny if it was warm. "not kronwing how warm it is where u is", nz vs au honey.. the umf 5+ is mgo (83mgo) . try to find some high grade like 800+ mgo, 20 umf, i worked with a producer that got 1237 mgo {25 umf), i could tell you where but... tube wont i wish i had the money to send you some 800mgo manuka honey for this but at $65 for 500g then shipping and prob 1.5k import fee( or just lots) i am low on funds
vegans have been awfully quiet since this video dropped
Why does his voice sound so different when doing the narration?
Me watching guga using metal on honey instead of wood, plastic or porcelain  *internally screaming*
What if instead of dry aging with honey you used it as a major component of a marinade? What would that do to the meat. As as a marinade it would be easier to simply wash it off the meat before you cooked it.
I really love your channel, but there's something I'd like to see occasionally - an episode about side dishes for all the juicy meat we eat.
“I’m not dying today. I’m not dy- ah well I don’t know, maybe” Cmon Angel 🤣
But is it the sugar content ?
Fun fact: Manuka honey is a good additive in your tea/hot drink if you're feeling a bit under the weather or suffer from hayfever. :)
Can you try sugar🤗
How many steak you have wasted
Bring back angel.
When I'll win £ 1 000 000, I can afford to make this recipe ;-)
What a way to waste a 🥩🥩🥩
🤦🏻‍♂️ No. Just no. You’ve lost the plot.
Man what a waste of New Zealand Manuka honey... I understand why you had to use it for the experiment... but the health benefits of just having it on toast or in your tea are amazing + the taste of it by itself is incredible :)
Shout out to our New Zealand Manuka honey!!
IDK man, gross
Manuka is literally the wagyu of honey.
He is getting to be a Good honest commentator. Your going to have a hard time convincing him what's good.

I just realized the aspect ratio of the video is perfect for watching on my galaxy note 9
do a marmite butter experiment
Please make a vacuum chamber for some weird liquid saturation experiments. You could pump various liquids deep into the meat fibres the same way woodworkers stabilize wood in resin. Those experiments would be a giant leap for carnivore kind.
Guga 3 years from now in the hospital dying for eating to mutch meat

You should do smoked brisket expriments with different types of smokes, such as Marijuana, Cigars, Cigarettes, etc.
Do you use your pellicle for anything? Ive heard it can be used in burgers or as soup stock
I love you so much and so does Jesus its not to late to turn to God and be forgiven but soon it will be, please repent and seek God he's coming back soon may GodBlessyou and your loved ones be safe 💙🙏🏽✝️
I love how even Guga's google-searches return websites spelling it "emzymes" like he pronounces it.

Pineapple a brisket and smoke it
I see many of your steaks dry-aged with different ingredients around the world. So, here's one experiment idea, dry-age in a Thai chilli jam (prik pao). It's put in many Thai dishes. It's be a nice shout out to Thai fans here XD
Manuka honey 🍯 is not cheap it cost more then the steak 🥩 itself
Gordon Ramsay would like to talk to you
That’s creamed honey FYI. Depending how the Manuka honey is processed, it can be runny like regular honey or creamed. But it is generally thicker than regular honey.

Just $150 of honey. Lemme go try this...
How much did all the honey cost?
Can you dry age with avocado?
12:30-12:55 *pingas*
10:30 that was kinda awkward LOL
See I thought Guga was going to dry age the steak in Honey, a free browser add-on available on Google, Oprah, Firefox, Safari.
Nice.  Silly me.  I was waiting for the sous vide.
Send a link to those wireless therms and what knives are those?
0:39 miwk and even yeogerrt
The meat was sexy but this voice made it sexier.
Up next; ‘nduja dry-aged steak. Lets do it!
The reason why it's so tender is it acts the same way as pineapple does. It has protease which breaks down proteins in the meat. Compared to a pineappleif you want to soften a chunk of meat this honey is both efficient and easy to store
A man served molded honey dry aged steak to his nephew, this is what happened to his stomach
Due to high sucrose content, Honey acts a dessicant and absorbs moisture. Also, enzymes would need higher temps to be most active.
Dry age it in Mayo lol
Anyone else’s clothes just disappear into thin air right about now?
Does it look like his beard borders his entire face?  asking for a friend...
You kinda sound like a serial killer
Dry aging steaks in THC.
Your honey looks like peanut butter 😕
Using Fogo too! That's some superior stuff!
..mm... ponder about what would honey do with human flesh ?  ha ha ha
"penetrate the meat" "sticky everywhere"😃
It's the year 2030 and you get a notification that says  "I dry aged steak with SW-40 oil" and the results were shocking!
You should wet age a beef chuck in white vinegar and chillies through a blender
Try aging your steak submerged on a pan, bowl or tupper filled with regular honey. It won't develop any mold.
honey is just one of a few insanely misunderstood natural substances, it' s almost magical in it's properties, we probably won't figure it out until all the bee's die :\
Something to consider... That IS NOT Dry aging.  Didn't even watch.
Should just do it for a few hours and see if it tenderizes.
I really want to go to a barbecue at your place.  I have some recipies i can't do right at my house.  Edit: also i want that slicing knife  Also with hello fresh the amount of gel pack waste is difficult to deal with and questionably environmental given the mass of plastic
Actually you can also use lemon juice
By just looking at the thumbnail i already feel dizzy
I missed ur nephiew
Why not compare honey vs pineapple??
Maybe age for less time? 🤔
People put a Manuka honey into cuts even stab wounds
that is some expensive honey 40$ a jar
I got an ad made with help of guga in a video of guga, no joke.
I got an ad for meater before the video. How appropriate.
I want to see this redone, but completely submerged in the honey. Good video btw
next video: "I dry-aged japanese wagyu a5 in msg and japanese fungus and tenderized in with pineapple and made 5 different seasoning salts and sous vided it in a special marinade"
It’s so weird that ‘enzyme’ is misspelled on that google result as ‘emzyme’ just like Guga says it 🤨
The problem is in the honey, because you bought a Manuka honey blend not pure manuka honey! It was written in the honey bottles, I don't know how can you missed it!
Brian David Gilbert did a second cooking video. I also suggest a collab with Guga on his channel.
this guy is talking in lowercase
How about trying to dry age it for less time and also put it in a vacuum-sealed bag like the regular one and see if that changes anything. At the very least it will not oxidize.
Your going to man heaven. Thanks for the video, this made my day.
You should try they dry aged in mud  primitive style
Did you fire your editor. Stop with the fking zoom jumps!
Dry age with some thc wax
My friends and i always tenderized meat with honey before grilling as it also acts as a sweet glaze. We usually just use regular cheap pure honey. Must be pure honey tho since a lot of honey contains added sugar and other things
"Is this it" thats what she said 😂
you spent like $100 on honey, not worth it lmao
Damm Manuka honey is not cheap lmao
Hmm, have you ever tried dry aging something in Hot Sauce? I would recommend Scorpion Hot Sauce, not because I want anybody to be torturing themselves by any means, but I feel like Scorpion Hot Sauce has enough heat to get through to the entire steak. Any other lesser hot sauce will end up making no difference. 🤔
Guga, damnit, dont use manuka honey like that. damn.
Naice to see something from nz on tha channel
Idea: Dry Ageing in Pepper. Don't know a lot about meat, but it could work.
@guga Why not do a regular dryage and then marinate in honey for like an hour or two
You should try doing some of these experiments but instead of just covering the steak in honey, you cover it and then put the entire thing inside of a dry aging bag as well and see if it does anything different
Honey has been known to be a potent preservative since ancient Egypt (they used it in the embalming process). But I suppose it's better to submerge the meat in it, since it drips. My guess is that the parts of the meat that went bad were the parts that got exposed once the honey slid off.
Next episode I dry aged angel in my dry aged wife and children
Dry age with bone marrow
So much wasted meat.  Dry aging is one of the worst things I've seen done to meat.
why don’t you just pick and eat it, instead of puttin on the plate just waste some juice on the plate..
I feel like if he just used a wire rack and raised the steak up off the parchment  it would have saved more steak and had mor dry age flavor
My God, so much honey wasted.. 😭
I absolutely cannot stand how long you drag on  the process, and run your mouth. Just eat the darn food for crying out loud. Blah blah blah. It takes y’all 5 minutes to take 1 bite, after you run your mouth. Just eat the food already.
Try Live Resin THC concentrate
Why didn't you just wash off the honey? I mean it had parts you needed to remove anyways.
I just looked for Manuka Honey at Amazon and wtf? Honey in general isn´t the cheapest spread, but up to 500€/KG?
Day 1 of asking guga to dry age a steak in dry aged pelicals.
I have a theory this is just my theory and I'm high when I thought of this theory cuz I was hungry and I wanted to eat but I watched your show instead. 🤣 Honey is also a good bit antibacterial even though there might be one or two or couple or a few bacteria that might be able to survive in it. The dry aged flavor comes from a specific type of bacteria that is only airborne or mostly airborne or maybe in a little tiny bit airborne but grows great on steak that's in the refrigerator. So this is long-winded sorry. Maybe the dry aged flavor come from a different type of microbe that's help helping create a slightly different enzyme and breaking down the protein.? Yeah I kind of over thought that a little bit but like I said in the beginning 4:20 is funny
Yo it’s me shiwon master Sang’s son I love your videos
Honey can tenderize the meat
Yukihira soma
Low grade Manuka, dont be cheap bro!
Have you ever tried dry aging in Marmite or Beef Bovril?.
Wasabi dry age please 🙂
i didnt know honey was a tenderizer that explains why my ribs are so good lol, i use it as a binding agent for my rub as im not a huge fan of mustard
Dry aged a steak wrapped in roast beef
Manuka honey is also great on wounds.
Guga is going to die from one of these experiments.
Dry age in Lea and Perrin's Worcestershire sauce, try it!
That looks so good
Honey is actually a desiccant too, meaning it pulls out water, like salt does, so it'll help dry out the exterior for a nice crust.
Is it possible to double dry age a steak after you cut off everything to clean it up?
Dry aging steak in dry
mmm mellified flesh
Guga, we wouldn't be shocked if you marinated the meat in anything at this point...
Winnie the Pooh has entered the chat
Do a dry aged covered in onions
Rubs a tablespoon of Manuka on a plate... 40 bucks right there
Manuka honey is soooooo expensive!

*..Sticky up your nose.* No comment.
Mr nephew is the most relatable of Guga's guests.
If angel dies, after the mold incident, he should be dry aged, as tradition demands...
Your meat will run into mush.                           ~wikipedia~
So..... what about a honey butter dry age?
Hey Guga, I have a request:  Can we see more closeups of the meat being served? Not just while cooking, but almost like a POV, or from another angle of when you guys eat it and talk about it.
Such a waste of beef
Should’ve but it in that bag with hiney
Hello Fresh .... nah ty
Amazing! I would have used the sealed bag also on the honey meat, since u need to avoid contact with Oxygen in order to prevent it from going bad
I would like to see this done with ordinary liquid honey, with the meat totally submerged with no access to air at any place. It can be washed off in running water, and it should prevent the stinky rotting.  It is hard to equal, let alone beat,  traditional and effective dry age methods..  This is a very interesting series.
Dry age a steak with cheese
Love watching these because they are so interesting and he's clearly so passionate about it, but I honestly prefer wet aged steaks myself. I wonder if any of these could be used to better effect in a wet aged scenario? Hint hint.
All your NZ fans must be really happy and proud to see you with Manuka honey.
Next episodes: “I dry-aged my steak with my own piss, with special guest Bear Grylls”
Great video guga
You an tell the days when Angel is in a good mood. Makes a difference in the video : )
They then died of botulism.  Seriously though, no point in dryaging with a flavor quality when you cut it all out anyway. Overall, a waste of meat and honey.
Accidentally got some guacamole in my eyes...  ... and now I think I have guacoma.
Is it just me or are the Amazon links for the knives are working???
Am i the only one who likes to chew meat like i mean the meat they are eating is like jelly it dissappears in your mouth
**cries in mc donalds**
Try pineapple yogurt
"if you wanna do a lot of work and get sticky all over" Pause
congrats you made sweet meat
Surprised this wasn't inspired by Shokugeki no Soma. I think as early as episode 2, this technique was mentioned
Bro if you talking about Tenderizer, Then Have you tried RAW PAPAYA? I bet it will be easy and more tender than anything you have experienced.
Use honey granules....!
Its a natural preservative
I want to see this tried but with a vacuum sealed dry aging bag
Yo guga, next time u dry age it in honey, u should grab a torch and harden the honey a little bit before hand so its not completely moist and drippy. I feel like the results would come out much better
The patience, I'd probably eat it by the end of the day
Why not put the honey on it then put it in the bag?
Like little kids with knife and fork🤣
okay now use thc honey.
wow seems like the one from food wars
Make a video on different types of meat sausage
Hey Guga, how do you get the steaks that pink without overcooking the outer edge?
Guga, if you don't mind, try to make a video using a real wagyu flank steak (whatever grade or quality of wagyu flank steak) vs the 1$ cut. HAHA
Please calm down on the editing effects...getting dizzy from all the camera bouncing
Now try dry age with all the 300 types of honey. surely one of them will be great.
Why don't you rinse it with warm water? The honey will just get flushed away
Try traditional country bbq smoker to cook those steaks include msg ones
Next one is marshmallow fluff!
Try taking your dry aged steaks, after the trimming, and put them in a vat of honey for a few days. The tenderising and the honey flavour should get in there.
When you get a guga ad while trying to watch guga - losing successfully
all that beautiful manuka honey went to waste
10:36 "I'm not dying today!" - 🙋🏻‍♂️Angel 😂
He looks like lucas from nct
Next Video: "I Dry-Aged Steak in Water.And This Happened"
I put steak for 1-2 h in honey and make a sauce out it. You dont need it to dry age it with honey.
0:00 i eat that everyday
Guga sticky all over 😂
what if you just barely made a light coating with the honey but then used the bag as you normally would. almost like a wash, or perhaps dry brine first then use the bag.
I wish i could be Guga's nephew.
I like when there is less music and you can hear it cooking
Food wars 🔪🔪
GUGA: "if you know me you know i dont like to waste any food"  also GUGA dry ages tons of meat every weak with honey,butter,nutella etc. and cuts like 2/3 of it to throw it away.   I like Guga and his videos but it makes no sense
Im glad I saw this Soma doing this real dope
guga can you dryage a walnut peach?
Manuka honey is not meant to be eaten as a food 😂
Me: “Cool! I could make these cheap garbage Walmart steaks worth eating!” Manuka honey: $20.99 for 8oz please
You’re running out of ideas GUGA………
Dry age in vinegar pls
Vegans are punching the air right now with their Bean Steakes.
The audacity of saying: "If you know me i don't like to waste food" after throwing away 70% of the cut.
oh lord Manuka honey $$$$$
You should try using raw Papaya for tendarizing , we use it and its very effective
I'm tryna get sticky up to my 👃
Man, a honey sponsorship would have been perfect
I knew that was Manuka as soon as I saw it. Impeccable.
Guga I'm still waiting for an invite to dinner, I'm in Miami as well, I could be there for dinner this weekend lol! Come on Guga and Angel, let's dew-iiiit🥩🥰🥂🍾😁🥩
stop wasting food plz
Should've used 1000+ manuka
Has anyone dry aged with Ranch seasoning and salad dressing mix?  I think it might be investing since it has MSG and Buttermilk powder.     I had a link before but I think it was removed for spam, so if you're aren't sure, please look up on amazon so I don't get deleted for spam links again lol.
Guga, If Sprite/softdrinks and sparkling water tenderize steak, pineapple also does the same thing, How about Tenderizing steak using Pineapple Soda
What is the music at the beginning? (Chor Soundtrack)
Manuka is great for a sore throat, far better than just soothing it helps heal and kill bacteria
What happened to Mamuh?
My question. Why not dry age the honey covered steak in the umai bag?
For those who aren't familiar, mānuka honey is basically the wagyu beef of honey. So who else wants a video with cheap brisket that compares a mānuka marinade with wagyu fat injections? 😲
Nice
Honey is also a great meat tenderizer candidate!
Why did you remove the honey if you would trim the whole meat??
Guga should dry age A5 beef wagyu with this honey 🤯
Well is it really "Dry aged" if it is aged in honey? No, so his friend is kinda right.
Wagyu rendang
Just an FYI, your ribeye umaidry link doesn’t work anymore. Was looking to give my dad one for Father’s Day.
Is this processed honey? Natural honey doesn't look so... Thicc
You have offended me, my country and my culture.... Shame on you Guga 😭
Wierd. The finally steaks he cut looked like NY Strips not ribeyes.
That Manuka honey comes from New Zealand, just like this fan right here! Love your vids Guga!! Take a trip over these ways someday. Our land is beautiful
285 vegans watched this video
Bring back the 1$ steaks experiment. Please use the pinenaple method  and then inject wagyu fat into the steak.
do a bone marrow dry age Guga
10:30 will become a meme, marks my words everyb0dy.
If its not from new zealand its not real manuka honey. Australia likes to label their tea tree honey as manuka but only new zealand grows the manuka tree.
Dry age in caramel
0:34 am I the only one that his Google assistant got activated?
12:26 That's what she said?
Every time Angel eats dry-aged, he knows he's peering into his future. 🤣
minched beef with wagyu fat what it could taste like
Try dry aging a steak in bone marrow
Inject the meat with honey and then cook it
Guga you are amaizing 👍
love the editting
I didn't realize Manuka honey wasn't well know everywhere. I live in New Zealand it's just kinda everywhere, I've always seen it as the fancy and expensive honey, it also tends to taste more pure
I really like your experiments but I think you are using the term "dry aged" wrongly. "Dry aged" is exactly what it says - the meat should stay dry during the aging process. You are imho not dry aging but simply marinating the meat in all possible substances. But the results are still interesting.
I was this in an anime
What if you put the honey steak in the bag?
dry age an entire cow please!
As soon as I saw the honey I knew it was Manuka. And the best one you could find? How. Much. Did. That. Cost!??!  Seriously like I only take a little spoonful every once in a while for the health benefits, you had like a years worth how I use it xD
Next episode: *I dry aged steak using my saliva* (saliva also have enzymes in breaking down foods)
Cannot stand the advertisement peddling it's nauseating. Don't people have any shame
Hello fresh is expensive and not even that good...
Man someday this guy gonna dry age steaks in Sh*t, and you get to see that
Fun fact: Manuka Honey costs up to $250 per glass.
guga i cant afford wagyu ship some lol
"I Dry Aged Steak With Ice Cream"
I learned that honey tenderizes meat from the anime Food Wars!! So as soon as honey was mentioned I knew what it was going to be used for. Food wars really does teach you a lot, more than you'd expect.
This has just become a waste of meat
but manuka honey   is Not Raw mean its not natural form
Never had dry aged steak, man guga really makes your mouth and brain salivate
Guga can you try dry aging with tomato paste?
Next episode: COOK STEAK WITH A CLAY POT
Seems like it wasted a lot of meat in the process as well.
Of course honey can tenderize it's just bee vomit
We need a sous vide and dry aged steak
Why the salt & pepper after the honey?? I would do 1/2 seasoned 1/2 not
Try dry age steak in honey for half the time then regular dry age for the other half
Actually you can tell it's super tender the knife went through it with no effort at all pretty damn astonished.
Guga, what about a hotsauce dry aged steak ? I think like yukateka sunshine habenero sauce would work so well with a steak
Next time: “I dry-aged steaks in Angel’s tears and this happened! Results absolutely angelic!”
Get 12 free meals with free shipping after you 2-3 meals a week  BS = $50+ lol
"yugurt"
10:30 pause
Interesting, I almost want to see what would happen in a more fluid type of honey if you were able to submerse the meat in it, that should cut off pretty much all oxidization, it seemed like the problem areas on this were areas where the honey had pulled back. Honey is a very interesting compound it has so many different types of enzymes and does things other compounds just don’t do, it never goes bad you can take a jar of raw honey and leave it for 10 years and it will crystallize and you can just drop it in a pot of water and bring the temperature up and it will turn right back to liquid and taste the same as it did 10 years ago. It has almost medicinal values to it, if you move to a new area and are having allergy problems eating local honey will get your body used to the local farmer that that honey is made out of and help your body adapt and prevent allergy issues it has antibacterial issues as well.  I would love to try this experiment. I’m not really aFan of dry aging all that muchBut some of these experiments you do a pretty interesting.    I kind of agree in a way that it may not be dry aged, it seems where the honey sealed the meat in it didn’t really oxidize at all, dry aged even though you cut the highly oxidize rotted parts off it’s still a process of oxidization.  This one was very interesting. I kind of want to see what would happen if you just took a local raw honey and submerged the meat inside of it not just a dry age but to see how long it would last in there, try it for 60 or 80 days and see what happens.  It would also be less of a pain and much easier to do, I’m sure the honey would cost a lot but filling it up with honey and submerging the steak would be much easier than trying to smear it all over. I think taking it off would be much easier to do with water as well. Lol
Guga looks like he's about to cry from it being so good
You should dry age a steak in chopped up black truffles
what if you tenderize in honey for a day than remove the honey and dry age.
Its not AMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZING ?
soy sauce goes great with honey especially if the soy sauce is a little burnt
GUGA Do a “Dry aging experiment” using garlic salt ! @ Jalapeño salt !!!!
Gotta love those Emzymes.
Dry age with whip cream?
How about soy sauce
honey kills most bacteria so it wouldn't dry age it well. i would dry age in msg then for the last week of dry age add the honey to see what happens.
10:30 LMAO Guga totally just splooged his pants
Im completely clueless about enzymes etc but have you tried apple sauce? Dry aging it in thick apple sauce?  Also if you try the honey again get a large tub and dunk the meat that way you get full coverage, was alot of missed spots on the steak you put in there
Awesome video! I love honey, I have a cabinet full of it at all times. This was a really cool experiment. I always end up hungry after watching your videos no matter if I just eaten an entire meal or not. Keep up the good work!
Come on Guga, you really need to try kangaroo
Bag it with honey?
You only need to put the beef in the honey for an hour and the beef will be tender
Dry age honey in the umai bag
I wonder if dry aging a roast in Wagyu Tallow would do anything??
Only apply honey to the cut faces only, then vacuum bag to dry age.
Why can’t you dry age with honey in bags though?
Just fascinating!!
The honey steak should have been vacuum sealed...
the average female seeing me in heelys: 10:30
I mean I’m not surprised that honey worked it can last for thousands of years without spoiling
Yooo
Next: I dry aged brisket in play-doh and this is how it turned out
Why is guga crying?
sadly in New Zealand (the home of manuka honey) Manuka honey is stupidly expensive when compared to other types of honey :(
....y.....a......u......you.......are.....awesome....my man.
Deepfry a dry aged wagyu brisket in beef tallow
Glad to see Angel, we missed him🙂
honey allway good on meat
Muscadine
Ants
12:26 Bro either just got done on the hub, is dirty minded, or takes normal explanations very seriously
Reason I just now realized these are staged:  Angel started to make a suggestion, "if you have a big chunk."   He was telling us if we had a big chunk  of meat, "you could cover it in honey and make this small steak"  That is why Guga interrupted him. Angel shouldn't have known about the yields from dry aging a large chunk of meat with honey.
Why let him out on bond or to record? Is the state's case weak?
Guga, if you age something in anything but air, it IS NOT Dry Aged. Its aged but not Dry Aged.
Could you put the honey one in the umai bag as well?
Such a waste of meat.
Dry age in bear fat
I'm glad the steak taste great in the end because those honey cost more than $40-$100 for one small box in my country. XD
yeah it's been a while since I last ate a dry-aged steak too, like 17 years or so
How are they eating such small bites? I wouldnt even need utensils
Ironically, before manuka honey became so in demand in the 2000's it was worth next to nothing, now the honey probably cost 3 times as much as that beef
dry age in wasabi next!
Try the same with pollen, is a natural preserver, perhaps his antibacterial properties make the dry aged skin thinner ...
My mother was given wound treatment with medical grade Manuka Honey. It cleaned out the wound and acted like a disinfectant. So I wasn't surprised that the steak didn't spoil. You can also use it for internal ulcers. The good stuff has become very expensive with recent demand.
Guga for your next video could you make tamales with wagyu fat please. I am interested if it is possible.
Mix everything up...then dry age it
Guga I gotta see how you would do homemade beef jerky!
Manuka is also called tea tree. I’ve seen it growing in Hawaiian gardens.
at this point i want to be guga’s son
Guga!!! Freeze dry a dry aged steak after trimming it and see how the flavor is when you hydrate! That sounds like an interesting test!
Age some in jalapeño peppers
Marshmallow fluff dry age
3:13 "Listen to your nose" Yes, just like I smell my music (Great experiment BTW)
teach your son how to hold cutlery
I’m not sure if i feel more for the meat or the honey 😂😅
Not worth the amount wasted on the age.
Love your videos!!
I’d have used the dry-ageing membrane bag with the honey coating on a third steak.
Could you dry age with honey?  Or is that just long term marinade
Shokugeki No Soma Tactics XD
Angel needs to stfu 🙂
manuka honey is just waaaay too expensive! Just mix normal honey with a bit of pineapple juice and be happy =D
Yay you did my recommendation!!!!!!’
Manuka honey is great. I pretty much only eat/use manuka honey but I live in NZ so it isn't hard to get
Let's do et!!! ...I love the music in this episode!
just like caramel
The amount of meat that gets wasted in some of these videos hurts me personally.
Next video idea. A5 beef jerky vs other types of steaks
what kind of HONEY IS THAT???
Nice
Dry age in Guano.
Hey guga, How about dry aging in Soy Sauce?
This dude Guga just cried smelling the steak. You can tell he takes pride with his work. Keep going Guga, your awesome
Trolls: "What's the secret to cooking dwarfs?" Guga: "Dry age."
What about honey marinated steak? How long can you marinate in honey for?
You should do a social experiment. Just cook 2 normal steaks but say one of them is not normal
That's some proper honey. Natural honey is waxy like that, it's what I grew up eating. The cheap supermarket stuff that's runny all the time are more like super/corn syrup than honey, real honey crystalizes and is waxy, only becoming syruppy if when you heat it up.
Can you dry-age in clarified butter?
Hey guga can you do some wagyu a5 ribs?
Honestly, i love when i come across your videos but i wont subscribe because i hate the way you say "lets do it".
Turn to Jesus people he died for your sins, Repent of what the New Testament describes as sin. Believe the gospel obey the teachings of Jesus documented in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Jesus is the only way to be saved, be baptized if you have faith in Jesus then you will live life with him as your example. If you need prayer i'll pray for you. If you want to keep contact with a brother in Christ i’ll keep contact with you. The love of God is beyond our understanding. God bless..//.
Wich song dud yu use this time ?
Great experiment. How about submerging the same kinda roast in regular or a little more well known honey?
You need to try dry age in jam
Guga can you dry age with beer and  If you can shold you use dark beer or ipa?
100% bull the guy even wrote the Wikipedia page before doing the video, everyone knows if you're going to do that the taste of honey combined with meat ends in a putrid flavour, if you want to copy this process then use golden syrup, don't fall for ruining your meat
Could you cover it in honey and then vacuum seal it in a dry age bag?
Aye that stuff kinda look like caramel 👀 you should try that dry aging in caramel
That’s not dry aged though! To be more precise you wet aged the first half( vacuum sealing meat prevents AIR FROM TOUCHING THE MEAT) “dry aging is done with just the AIR! “Honey dry aged” ? Uhhh NO!
I doubt Guga eats hello fresh when he cokks like a bosssss
when you think that guga has had all the possible experiences this happens .. next step, dry age a steak and put it 3 hours in mixed pineapple. thank me later for the suggestion!
Tell me why I got a guga meater ad on this video!!! Guga is everywhere
Said it before, I'll say it again...dry aging wastes so much meat...I'm sure it's good, but it's just not worth the waste...
Angel: "When I see two steaks I know it's an experiment." I am forced to conclude that they routinely invite Angel over to record him eating non-experimental food in high definition. But for what reason... hm...
Any shogugeki fans here
Gotta love it!
best honey in the world  i love this country and im so happy you got to experience our honey :D  you should definitely try our fish
why wouldnt you just marinate a regular dry age steak in honey before cooking instead of trying to use honey as the dry aging process
What type  of thermometer you  are  using?
You can try with higher MGO level, you a UMF 5+ that contains 83 mg/kg but there are 20+ that contains 830 mg/kg
this music you used is very dramatic. Kind of like it. I think you should have just dunked it.  if it was covered I dont think would have the wastage and you have the other aspect of the honey flavor. clearly wont need 30 days.
It would be expansive as hell but I bet the steak would have WAY more of a honey flavor if you dry aged by filling a huge bowl with honey and submerging the steak into it.
That honey looks like the best honey available. it looks like caramel! Yummy
What if you submerge in honey?
Wont lie, Ive been waiting for this. Using honey in a lot of my meat recipes has become fairly commonplace for me, although I don't always have extra honey so maybe a lot is overexaggerated. Haven't watched it yet, just wanted to share my hype as a person who loves using honey in my cooking and has a long ways to go learning to use it even better.
I was thinking wrapping in cheesecloth after probably would helped the honey much better
"I dry aged this steak in bleach, and this is what happened"
Bruh it's been years and you haven't tried dry aging angel
So honey dry aged = wasted meat
And edible to get you stoned  🤣🤏
People thought it was steak with dabs
Why did you waste manuka honey for this? Do you know how expensive is it? It cost 10x what regular honey costs
Guga, how about dry brining the steak for a day and then dru aging it?
In my mind Guga is Uncle Iroh and Angel is Zuko
8:43 is where it really starts
NOT A GOOD IDEA! Honey contains Boutulinum spores that are inactive due to honey only containing 15% water. It's not a problem for adults 1yo or older because our immune systems kill it before it can activate.
Your voice reminds me of karalis lmaoo
Couldn't you just smear a little honey in the dry bag? Would it speed your aging up?
I am liking this content...BUT ---i cant handle the number of flips on the grill.
3:55 interesting that you said that the meat was smelling bad. Honey has anti bacterial properties so it should preserve the meat.
What is this? His entire Guga life is just drying aging steaks over and over again while forgetting that the SUPREME KING is always going to be pineapple, there is simply no reason, in fact, he is now committing TREASON for no reason by doing this repetitive content!
That Moment when you knew the honey thing cuz Shokugeki no soma 😂😂
no sticky in nose if you keep fingers out.
I'd love to use the honey that was featured on vice where it had the psychoactive effects like lsd.
I never would have thought of this in a million years.   Your channel always has great stuff.
Can I be your quality control?
Dry aged in the butter of the gods, steak dry aged in bone marrow next 👀 👀
Bear Grylls:  "I dry-aged steaks using my PISS."
Who else learned this from food wars?
Could you not put honey in a container and simply submerge the meat in the honey placing the container in the refrigerator for 35 days?
*Reads Title*  Ive seen Food Wars I know where this is going.
Looks so good! By the way, what are those tiny thermometers? Does anyone know the brand?
Black pepper burns and turns bitter. Best to pepper a steak after it cooks
Mmmm.... If you want fried rice, you go to Uncle Roger. If you want Beef Wellington, you go to Gordon Ramsey. But if you want steak or beef, you go to Guga Foods.
7:57 I had that one, absolutely amazing.
do dry aged msg steak with injected wagyu fat
I’m hungry now
Why did I click on this video? I don't regret it...
Hey Guga would you ever do a salt replacement comparison episode?
Should make a purée with different things to do the dry age. An example: onion, garlic, and black pepper corn. If it’s too dry maybe butter. So I guess you’d basically be dry aging in compound butter.
Dry aged in bone marrow?
FYI your * Dry Aging Equipment *  links are all broken
This honey experiment reminds me of food wars. When Sona did this.
Do one with regular honey too too compare
Manuka honey isn't cheap. That to be at least a hundred bucks worth of honey in those three jars!
I legit saw a jar of Manuka honey for like £40 once. For context that’s $56.68
Damn that meat cutting made me drool
10:30 thats love right there.
Just dry age steak in ice cream 😋
Next episode i dry aged steak in maple syrup.. or pork
Why the honey look like thet
Next Episode: “I dry-aged steak in bleach”
That was some REAL honey!😋❤️
Type in - Real honey, there are so many chemical fake honey in the world, in USA most…
*Hey Guga, on your Sous Vide Everything channel, vac seal and cook a steak in honey!*
Question: After the sear, how hot is the indirect heat. Is it low to do the meat slowly? Thanks for helping!
If u tried honey, couldn't you test with maple syrup? Btw love your channel man!
Remember the I think it was the 3rd episode of food wars  And they explains that honey works the same as pineapple  And when I saw the thumbnail I knew It was gonna be a good video
Pee on it, and bury it in your backyard for 2 months. Full Viking Shark meat style.
Next time you should tell angel that the other experiment is human meat and the they legalized it and see what his reaction is LOL
Do guacamole dry age. Or banana pudding lol. Apple sauce.
Lololol, as soon as he held that spoon up, I was like "that's Manuka honey". Yep, and he bought the exact same brand I have sitting on my counter right now. I didn't buy it though, a friend got it for me. It has a very distinct flavor (almost like a bit of pollen & wax are still inside it). I think that's why it's not runny. It tastes almost like a Burt's bees chap stick, but sweeter.
Trust your nose..... it went from smelling amazing to terrible..... let’s eat it tho....
Guga make the meat luffy eats
I got duped into watching the full meater probe ad because Gugu did the voice over lol.
-3:46
The reason it doesn't taste of dry aging is, if I had to guess, because the honey kept the moisture. I reckon it kind of wet-aged instead.
Yup
this guy eat a cow by day lmao
I'm guessing the honey dry age idea is cool in theory - but too much waste to justify it.
In food wars this was used and honey is good
The passion is amazing!!
you should try vacumseal the steak with the honey....
He did it! He finally did it!
Ok so you gotta dry age it first normally then after you get it trimmed down you want to let it marinate in that honey. The cool thing is you can make garlic honey with that and use it as the marinade or hell even throw onions in the marinade as well!!!
guga why didnt u put the honey steak in the umami bag ?
- .....🤔 deep fry butter milk chicken with Honey 🍯instead of oil 🤯 .... That's an experiment we would LOVE to see 100%😁😉   Crazy like a Fox 🤪😁🍻
Another tasty looking steak!! Great work!!!!
Dry age some beef in candle wax
Such a massive waste.
Guga, you so crazy lol.
try marmite dry age :)
Yo this reminds me of Shokugeki no Souma, with the episode, when Soma teamed up with Tadoroko the first time!
I think you should have done this experiment with using just a normal day shopping bought honey, not with the specific type of honey
Next episode: “I Dry-aged a Eye-round then put it in Pineapple juice”
Try mustard and honey mustard!
35 days wtf
Could you try a wagu broth ramen next? And compare it to a normal one to see if theirs a change in flavor?
Looks like a dank dab to me
Agikuyu tribe of Kenya used to preserve meat using honey centuries ago. The results was meat fit for angels.
Guga vs saltbae?
Just eat fresh meat guys, I mean honestly.
I have one question for you... Are you vegetarian?
After seeing the results I think it may be interesting to take it in a different direction: if the enzymatic activity of honey does exist, why not make a thinned honey bath (like you do with pineapple) soak the meat for a duration to get the enzymes to penetrate the meat, then proceed with the dry-aging process. You will hydrate the meat initially, which may slow the dry age, but if the enzymes remain active during the aging process they should be able to work on the meat and not have the same degree of loss due to spoilage.
GUGA YOU JUST USED THE MOST EXPENSIVE HONEY IN THE WORLD.. MANUKA HONEY FROM NEW ZEALAND ❤
Next idea: Can dry aging in honey save the $1 steak? (Eye of round)
What would hapen if you marinade your stake then dry age it
Do a mustard or ketchup dry age
Age something in vinegar
Guga should go into bodybuilding, steak for every meal, from Guga to Goku real quick
Next episode “Dry-aged steaks in Beans”
now this finally proved that the first lesson on the Food Wars S1 Is real when yukihira was cooking meat with it
Dry age in ketchup or mustard next
Is it me or is Angel's hairline going higher?
Angel is so funny 😂 he’s the best sidekick
Me watching food wars Me watching Guga food Me realising there is no difference
"Listen to your nose" - Guga, 2021
Australian Red Gum honey will give you the best ever!
lol the most expensive Hunny in the world lol
My favourite part is when he says “let’s do it “
you should try it with a cheese cloth, so it doesn't drip or fall. or maybe with honycomb or bee's wax.
Do a cheap eye round stew and use honey with it
Ango's laugh killed me🤣
do kewpie mayo next!
Yay my comment on one of the gugas videos came true!!!
It's like that episode of shokugeki no soma
Manuka honey seems to have a lot of wax in it.
No regular honey is runny only honey which has been specifically heated to become runny.
Guga's freezer must be full of dry aging meat
honey on 1$ steak
Let Angel speak!!!  Multiple times he wanted to say something but you didn't let him get a word out!!!
You should try the dry aged in killer bee honey 🍯
Video of moldy steak put up on the 9th. I'm watching on the 10th. Is Angel still alive?
Dry age the steak regularly and then after cleaning it up, marinate one dry aged steak with honey for 3-5 hours and the other one overnight 🤷‍♂️
I must say i don't think you developed much of the dry aged taste in the controll piece. There was no sign at all of any fermentation or fungal growth. Just looked like maybe some preservatives were added and let to dry. Sure more concentrated taste but a dry age is meant to add flavor. That's not dry age. That's just dehydration.
You dry age or you get dry aged
Leave the steak in a large tub of honey!
Guga, please take immediately a plane to Germany Frankford and open up a restaurant
pineapple vs honey next!!!
One thing that wasn't said about honey: honey is a natural mechanical anti-bacterial which is why you can preserve stuff with it.
*Me who watched shokugeki no soma*
“I dry aged steaks in the crushing vacuum of deep space”
New editor is a bit too much, tell the dude to chill <3
Can you do an experiment on a Dry aged steak, then dry brine it? (Can you also give a shoutout to me too haha)
the worlds 1st honey dry age??? pretty sure i commented for you to try this many videos ago lol....... deffs not a worlds 1st
Next is comparing all your successesful dry aged steaks to know which is the best.
Honey is supersaturated liquid. That means, that there is more sugar disolved in the water, that it is possible in standard means. Becouse of that honey naturally tries to ,,pull" out water from his surrondings. It work pretty similiar to these bags you are using :)
The problem with your dry aging process is your refrigerator has too much moisture and your not really getting a true dry age result
Hey Guga, thanks for your great videos. After watching your videos, I have three requests for future videos: - Please try some other cattle breeds than wagyu and American beef. - How do you clean all your pans and other cooking ustensils so they continue to be so shiny ? - Please cook a foie gras in a terrine using sous vide. And yes I'll repeat those requests often. ;)
I wonder if it'll be different if the meat was covered in honey completly. If for instance we put it in a container filled with honey.
Hey do a whiskey with honey experiment
I use granulated honey when I cure bacon, and the flavor it imparts is excellent, both on pork belly bacon and beef bacon as well.
Honey is good tenderizer, but it is NOT for dry aging. It's better for stews though.
Could you try a eye round with honey?
where is the 3rd steak guga?
angel is a true connoisseur look as guga tells him to pay attention to the flavor! good job my bro and congrats on not being dry aged yet 💯
"I dry aged a steak in toothpaste and this is what happened."    It sucked.
Фу!!! И это смотрит постоянно непостник Путин!!! Я вообще после него, не могу на мясо смотреть!!!!
Can we just admire that he spent well over a month making this video.
How about honey dry aged in meat? :D
Hey guga why wont u dry age the dried age steak...since the honey experiment didnt contain the aging flavor...so what the heck...hahhahaha...just a thought tho...
Came here looking for food wars comment...  Came out disappointed...  Anyways... Nice video man😁
What about pork meat? 👀
I watched sokugeki no soma, there I first known that honey tenderizes meat, maybe you are the greatest chef beside his father haha
10:20 amogus
A nice one :-) But ;-) What if you submerge it in honey, so it don't oxidize
Dry aged and dry brined next?
This is essentially honey cured steak OMG
No matter who you are, people hate commericals. Think about it before you will lose too many viewers
how about dry-aged for 35 days first, then honey-tenderized for 24 hours. This will be a great combo
Guga you're bullshitting us with that Google search lmao! It's literally only you that call "enzymes" "emzymes". But i do believe you tho. I just KNOW you added that in there and it didn't come from Google like that
Anyone else here kinda getting sad because he is using 3 jars of manuka honey for an experiment
I think you should dry age in ketchup, since it has vinegar in it. Vinegar is tenderizer
I like how he edit the google search
“Don’t worry about everything; instead pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. Then you will experience God’s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.”
Dry aging in something most people would consider a liquid...
Manuka is used for medicine as well... my father in law was going to lose his big toe due to a severe infection, the manuka honey actually killed the infection
i love guga
here is an idea take a good piece of meet tenderise 24h with honey coat than clean the steak use the jaccard method put it in a vaccum sealed bag with a lot of whiskey after 24h take it out put it in a umami bag and dry-age it for 19 more days in the fridge than cook it
"your meat will turn into mush? O God Ive got to do this experiment" *Cuts to footage of mush* RIP Angel
Manuka is used for medicine as well... my father in law was going to lose his big toe due to a severe infection, the manuka honey actually killed the infection
Glad you like the honey from new zealand chur bro
Never heard of “Manuka honey” yet knows what Wagyu is. What a mong
Seeing New Zealand made me smile lol
How about you do the honey experiment with a big steak, after the steak has been reduced then dry age it... that way you can get the dry age flavor with the honey "dry age"
1:25 “it is not your everyday honey bear honey”.  me laughing in New Zealand, where manuka is my everyday honey 😂
Erm…. Why dint you vacuum it ?…
guga is so oa
Dry aged meat in avocado
THANK YOU HONEY FOR SPONSORING THIS VIDEO
Hellooo from New Zealand!! Thanks to your channel i have been able to teach a few of my close friends all about marbling and choosing the right steak! So thank you!
Did you remind Angel that to wear an Amish/Mennonite beard, you have to be married?  Oh, honey is also a preservative, and personally, should be saved for mead brewing :)
Guga, try dry aging with mayonnaise?
Try Velveeta Dry-Age or Wasabi Dry-Age
Dry age a steak in baby food
2:46 uncovered spot... what a shame, it probably went bad because of it.
Dry age them in francesinha sauce
"Dry Aged" in something wet.    Is it me?
Try this one it's the best honey steak...  Honey on steak marinade in shoyu olive oil vinegar garlic and ginger
Before we start Honey shouldn't expose any fermentation agents it'll block it and kill it!  However it will never let air get in!   @Guga you had to pasteurize the honey first...you should have used sous vide machine and drop the honey jars first   I believe that would have you more control spreading and much safer syrup!   One last thing... You should've after spreading manuka and get child if you had honey of cheaper liquid type you could fill Container and submerged the steak covered with manuka inside it and let process go on  If all honey was pasteurized you shouldn't have any rotten parts at all!  Here in Middle East Honey is literally sacred like holy sacred so we study that natural gold and it's properties for years and that's my take of what we learned of it!
Day 1 to say go in Japan to eat an a5 wagyu steak .
Honey is excellent at stopping bacterial growth that’s why you can eat 2000 year old honey
3:37 "This is the world's first dry aged honey experiment." Not really, Since you looked it up on Google and Google already knew the results I'm pretty sure someone has done an experiment like this before.
Why don’t you combine all your successful dry age experiments into 0ne for instance msg with Manuka etc
Its aged, but not dry aged. Honey  has about 20% moisture content. it does have has hygroscopic properties, so it might have pulled some moisture from the meat, but since it wasn’t put in a sealed container, it could have as easily retained water from the atmosphere inside the fridge.
In New Zealand Manuka Honey is quite common
Try dry aging a steak in umai bag with honey, maybe you'll have both of the flavors: honey and dry aging
The algorithm has fermented
As soon as I saw the title my Mind yelled out MANUKA !
Try dry aging with cockroach powder
Ernest P. Worrell : "Is this where them horror movie folk be ? Some of these experiments look like fake meat cloned/grown/plants from out of a lab, like in the SyFy movies called, "Soillent Green" &"Snow Piercer" food chains ! ! ! 😜😝🤪☣️🐵meat ! ! ! DDH 6-10-2021.
Can the honey be removed by placing the meat in running water?
Looks like someone is trying out some new video editing techniques
To age meat in honey, it is best to submerge the entire piece of meat in a vat of honey, this prevents the oxidation.

next episode " i dry age steaks in tempoyak"
Legit, I would try the honey dry age, but make sure the outside is as dry as it can be. When you scraped it, it looked like some juice seepage. When honey gets wet, like with water or other juice, it can affect the enzymes and the way the sugar works. Or maybe put it in an dedicated fridge you don’t open for and over, causing condensation. Lots of variables here to account for but this was great to watch!
If you want a good life ask these words,dear lord please come into my heart in jesus name amen

Next episode: i dry-aged my nephew and it taste delicious 😂😆😂

You do some crazy marinades on some very expensive meat. An atrocity in itself if you ask me....you marinade crap meat ..not the good stuff.
That 50% loss is a major deal breaker.
Dry age in bacon or bacon fat. But home made bacon or bacon fat... thank me later. Lol
Hello Guga, thanks for all you do! 2 questions: What is your favorite way to dry age? What is your favorite way to "grill" a steak?
Manuka Honey is only found in My beautiful country New Zealand 🇳🇿 It is the best Honey found. May Allah bless you
Hey guga, I'd love to see you try steaks from a retired dairy cow. They have been naturally dry aged for 10 to 20 years
New Zealand has the best honey in the world!!!!!
Hey guga.. buy some steak from the bearded butchers in Ohio..
Guga make a video for popeyes Fried chicken plzzz
Guga try dry aging it inside candied sugar , it should be covered by a hard sugar shell and sealed inside

Have you ever made burnt ends with meat you've dry aged?
Is it me or doesn’t angel look tony loya
Sri Lankan Tribes also dry aging meat in honey, Love from Sri lanka😘
hey Guga, you gotta try raw papaya. best tenderizer on earth. better than pineapple.
Put the honey Steak in a clay pot and cover with honey. then leave for few days.
Your meat will turn into a mush?  Time for a cialis I guess
So when it comes to the best manuka honey, that is nowhere close to the best,   I’m there’s Manuka honey with a much higher UMF (the amount of Manuka essentially) which I could probably get a hold of pretty easily
What if you just cut the meat then dry aged it in the honey  And sealed it from oxygen.
Could you do this again but like the pineapple? Not as long? I want to see how tender and different tasting the steak would taste without having to cut so much of it off.
The song used while cooking the steaks was a terrible choice. Stick to the original, if it's not broken don't try to fix it.
Should try the honey again in the bag maybe it’ll keep better
Watching Americans talk about Manuka Honey, I feel like I took it for granted living in New Zealand
Dry aging is over rated..Nothing better then fresh..
You should try to make freeze dry aged steak
Maybe if you inject the meat with honey and then dry age you'll get that extra level of complexity
I got gugas ad on here lol
sweet meat
Guga now Pooh Bear 🤣
Hello fresh should do a guga inspired meal
New Idea: Dry age steaks in mango
Coconut oil dry-aged
I thought maybe using more "liquidy" honey and putting the meat in a bag with it or in a "honey bath" would be also nice? I think the parts that went a bit bad were not covered completely, but i can be wrong
Maybe in a short time with honey it will work like pineapple
maybe if you mix 2 ways of proceeding for example go choo gang and honey or why not a crust of spices and honey it will maybe be easier to proceed in this way because the honey will be less aderant or  stick due to the mixture of the various ingredients to use.
anyone remember the 1st few episodes of FoodWars?
I tried to smoke my dry aged steak.  Big mistake.  Was so dry.
rather than using honey, what about you use bee's wax for dry aging?
Season the steak before dry age
I wonder if you had a tub of hunny
Crushin sandos with hellofresh. Ferda.

I love eating honey marinated bacon, it doesn't taste like honey at all, just makes the bacon more sweet and salty and crispy.
Dry age in easy cheese 👀😂
You should try these dry age style experiments but put them in the umai bag to see how deep the flavours will penetrate
Guga can u make wagyu fat compound butter?
Enzymes, not emzynes.  It's endearing, the way you say it, but.
Freze dry a steak then in sted of trying to rehydrate it deep fry it in wagyu fat/grease
Use honey  pineapple and MSG. Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?
Honey+msg  And Pineapple+msg  Please
what if you combined the honey and the vacuum bag?

Guga low key got underrated sound design
Would have been cool to see high enzyme and low enzyme
Now, instead of dry-aging, just do a couple hrs of tenderizing a steak. See if the honey comes through more on the final product.
I think you should try to do this but with honey butter
Condensed milk dry age
what if you season a cut before you dry age it?
Do the carnivore diet for health benefit and lose weight.( only meat and diary. No sugar, no green, no carb )

9:56 is the best moment
Manuka honey is also really good for your health!! I get rid of my chronic ear infections with Manuka honey alone. Has antibiotic properties and you body won’t build up resistance like standard antibiotics
Since you take steak making so seriously, you should learn about making proper restaurant quality grill marks. They should be a net of diamond shapes on each side, which means you only move the steak three times after you put it on the grill.
I wonder if you used a runny honey and didn't let it sit as long so the enzymes wouldn't get as deep if that would have been better?
Child Guga: I'll know I made it when I can eat unlimited steaks
Manuka honey is far the best honey in the world but it’s worth a fortune
Hi Guga, try dry-age it with wasabi next! Or sambal belachan

What would happen if you mix the fungi dry age method with the honey? Maybe get the funkiness in there.
Try dry aging with a layer of ground beef.
Once again,This is why I love your channel. !!
Also Manuka honey is like liquid gold for resellers here in Australia. Chinese people buy it in bulk at retail price and send it back to China for a massive profit. It’s actually quite hard to come across a 5+ on the shelves
Next episode: I dry aged a steak in angel and you’ll be shocked by the results
Also, can’t forget about Mamao, I envy him too.
I envy Angel. Well done Guga!
would be better to just dry age a steak and then make a honey glaze of some sort for it
You can try dry age in dry aged fat
Food wars intensifies
Why not cover it in honey, then put it in the dry age bag?
Nephew looking Florida as hell lol
Dry age in garlic paste

You've done butter, now you've done honey, but what about honey butter?
owh honey...
3:00 in the middle of the steak you can literally see the mold growing. all that white fuzz is nooooooooo
Guga, can you do an experiment where you cook 3 exactly same steak then say that it was an experiment to MauMau(not sure how to spell it, sorry if I write it wrong) I think this experiment can be an interesting idea and I'm sure some people is agree with me, I'm sorry if someone commented this before and I didn't saw it. We're looking forward to it Guga!
That looks like the honey Winnie the Pooh eats

what a waste of good honey and meat. you should be ashamed of yourself, honestly.
You describing how you spread the honey on the steak was so soothing
2:43 Missed a spot.
Kinda waste of good honey
I think people use honey and yoghurt to marinate instead of dry-age meat.
What about dry aging in mustard?
This new zooming every 3 seconds edit is very distracting
That was my comment 😎😎
How is it DRY aged if the moisture is sealed in with the honey? Appreciate the hard work providing the experiments but afraid you’re gonna end up with food poisoning.
Everybody gangsta until Guga serve you two steaks with a smile
Follow up experiment: Dry age a steak first, then tenderize that same steak in honey

Can you dry age it with Japanese Natto?
Nice one.
You can't really call honey something to dry age in. but you can do some amazing things with honey preserving meats... if you want to do some fun experiments with honey we should talk.
Does anyone appreciate the research and homework it goes into each video?
Yes, manuka honey is delicious but you said "actually delicious" like other types of honey aren't.     I go through about a pint of manuka a month.
Could you try dry aging steak in a vacuum?
Food wars reference here.

Next Episode: "I Dry-aged Angel in his own juices"
you need to do an All TIME FAVOURITE  episode!!
Not only sticky but waste alot of the meat and money to get just one steak.
Why did you listen to that guy?
Have you dry aged an Eye of Round yet?
Ya your American bear honey is just corn syrup cut with honey
I wish this guy was my neighbor
Apple butter
You're gonna get Sticky everywhere - Guga LOL ;)
Please Mr.Guga, I know you have probably answered this question a million times, but if you will, please tell me where to get the dry aging bags you use. I am not an exotic experimenter as you are. I am very satisfied with the traditional dry age process but the bags interest me. thank you . Take care.
Coat the meat in the honey and THEN put it in the dryage bag? 🤔
3 ribs down to 1 steak, i just dont understand, thats alot of waste
Now that I’m thinking about it, Guga kinda looks like Winnie The Pooh.
10:30
But have you tried dry aging steak in CHEESE?!?!
Nope that’s a thirst trap for the neighbor that’s messed up😋😔
I did a Guga style experiment myself this last weekend. I made 4 chicken breasts using 2 different marinades and cooked 2 different ways, grilled and griddled. The results were interesting, and thankfully all came out good!
ok so for the people that are subscribed to "sous vide everything" is it just me or did angel grow out his hair in less then 24 hours lmao
Show what you can do with pellicle
The new soundtrack on the grill sounds great
Do a honey dry age eye round
Guy try’s way too hard with that voice
It had alot of waste  because the honey dripped off in the first hour so it was just meat sitting in the fridge with honey on top and bottom
Maybe alittle too much zooooooooom
Things are about to get --Messi-- , in other words Awesome
Dry age beef cheeks please guga
Dry aged steak in black garlic👀👀👀👀👀
Dry age some exotic meat. Maybe ostrich or bison? Or at least a bunny 😋
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17-For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9-That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
Honey also never goes bad, at least raw honey which I think you had.  So I think what happened is the honey basically preserved the steak at the point it couldn't penitrate anymore.  Hence no dry age taste, it didn't breathe.
Google: "You can't marinate the meat too long"  Guga: "The only thing left to do now is to let it rest in the refrigerator for 35 days."
I love this editing
Hi honey~
I thought this was a sous vide channel. I’m seeing it less and less
I'm not sure which one I want more in these videos... the steak, or the knives.  Gosh heccin' dangit those are some sharp knives! :O  Oh, right, yes, the steaks look fantastic also.  ....  them's some real nice knives.
Lol this is so weird
Guga, wet age at home vs dry age at home please.
Dry age a steak in edible gold leaf
The camera zooms are distracting
You should also not dry age meat for more than a month 3 weeks max 2 is med and 1 week is the least🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Just call this show "meat science"
Guga, why not try putting the honey covered meat in the dry aging bag, and see how that works🤙🤙
Good vid - FYI Manuka +5 is the lowest grade version.  Also, for everyone to know, depending on the grade, this honey can get extremely expensive.
OMG watching that steak flex like a dragster tire after Guga took it off the grill 🥰
Dry age in wagyu tallow!!!
If you want the real liquid gold, buy manuka honey from Manuka Doctor with a minimum MGO of 200+ instead of 5+. The texture, taste and healthy goodies are 10 fold. Great video again!
Surprised he didn’t mention how expensive Manuka honey is
Guga telling us not to get our meat sticky.  Don't mind if I do.
Laughs in food wars
I love Hellofresh!
Guga's transformation into Winnie the Pooh is almost complete!
Manuka is a normal regular honey in NZ. Then I saw the package and, of course. From NZ lol
i saw the honey on meat on food wars
As a kiwi I approve this use of manuka honey :)
ANGEL!!!!!
cara eu n fazia nem ideia que esse cara era brasileiro, até eu ver o video dele com o canal do só vide, kkkkk
I would love to see this experiment again with some MSG to see if you can get the umami flavor back
Do wasabi dry age
Some are soft, others are hard, but all of them are sticky 😂😂😂 yo, I'm dead 😂😂😂

It is said that some wealthy people in cannibal communities searching for A5 humans which feed mainly with best steaks... Be careful Guga, just saying.
Guga! dry age with Beeswax with a twist!!
I think you should put the meat in honey in the special bag, so that it wont get contaminated
I would love to see this on a 2” think for an hour then SV!
dry ages steaks are  gross  in my opinion nothing like letting your meet rot for a month  before you eat it no thanks
10:30 I wish my gf sounded like that when she sees me 😐
Next episode: "I dried-aged a steak in lotion"
How about dry age the steak first and then do the honey thing - or vice versa.
You guys are great
Dry aged beef in beeswax
Guga put less honey and dryage on a rack, i think it would keep the meat much dryer! for sure the results would have been different.
Why not dry age the honey covered one in the umi bag?
I still wonder if there will ever be a video where you add the tenderizer/dry-age-agent to a Umai bag so it spreads evenly once you vacuum seal it.
Do you still have more of this honey? Wondering what it would do if you used it in Sous vide?
DRY AGE in JAM/JELLY
The honey costs more than the steak.
People who watched Shokugeki No Souma knows about te honey thingy xd
This video feels over edited...
I recommend oil to clean of the stickyness ;)
Remind me of food wars anime
GUGA please leave the camera zooms.. i dont like them, bit great video!!!
When he said he used honey I instantly thought of food wars
the quality and editing of his videos just keep getting better and better
Still waiting for different cheese. Dry age 1 in melted and 1 in cream cheese/ spreadable
I see some chefs use the "pellacles" in a very big coarse Minced beef to add flavor to burgers. Can you do that some time guga?
lol regular honey isnt runny (most of the fake honey is)
46th trending
Let's dry age a steak in dry aged ground beef
Why is the music so intense when he is cooking the steaks 🤣
Shoulden"t guga get a sponsorship with honey
Trending!!!
Dry Age the A5 brisket
dry age a filet mignon then do the pineapple thing then cook it
John 3:16-18  Jesus loves you  Jesus is coming back very soon to judge this world and set up his kingdom that will reign forever and ever. Hell is real, hell wasn't made for humans but for the fallen angels but if you reject Jesus and his sacrifice you will end up in hell. Whoever you worship on earth is who you will worship in the afterlife. Repent before it is too late Please i plead with you for the sake of God.
Agree with the verdict.  I'm sure it's good, but I doubt it's "spend an insane amount of money on special honey and waste half a rib roast to make one steak" good.
imagine a vegan watching this video
Can you coat the steak in honey and put it in the the dry age bag to keep more of the meat.
i missed angel
I hope Angel doesn't feel like a guinea pig.😂
Try dry aging with honey but put it in a bag
Guga why don’t you use the reverse sear method, anymore?
So next episode is with kiwi?!??!
I tried the sprite marinade the other day. it works like a charm!
For your Filipino fans, guga would you cook something filipino? I recommend "pork adobo" or "bulalo"... Happy beinge watching all of guga videos!!!
This channel is slowly dying
I dry aged steak in pelicose
I mean honey is pretty much bee saliva and saliva ist just the first step in digesting
I love that the first reference is from Food Wars lol
Maybe try again with a more common honey and see if you get a result in between the 2.
Put the meat in a jar of honey for a month!
Umai isn't traditional dry aging
I saw a anime called food wars that some on use honey to tenderize the meat
This to me is one of your LEAST weird experiments.  I'd   put honey on meat just because.  Sweet and savory is my favorite flavor combination and i LOVE honey.
Try the honey tenderize experiment to see how it compares to pineapple on an eye round steak
Yukihira knew all along
his viewers:DAYMM THIS IS BUSIN ME:I LOVE HIS MIC LOL
Put into (1) worcestershire sauce, (2) A1 sauce marinade, or (3) teriyaki soy-pineapple sauce ...  and see some fantastic MSG flavors come into play.
Guga: It's sticky everywhere Angel: *Tries so hard to not demonetize the video*
Lol did anybody else see a Guga commercial within this Guga video ?
Do they make those wireless thermometers any thinner? I feel like they ruin the look of the slices
I really wanna see a Wagyu dry aged in.......Adobo Paste. Oh man. That would be epic
Dry age in ghee next time
Guga, skip the dry age and go straight to the Chamorro BBQ and red rice!
Next experiment should try dry aging in vegimite!
Please use beeswax
Waste of fine manuka honey which is a incredible anti viral health food.
guga is the only 1 i know who has a orgasm over a steak xD
Song name please 5:48 o:
All my 710 heads loving this video too?? 😂🍯 Guga for dabs
I think he should vacuum it in honey. No oxidation, more penetration 😬
Try to do the honey covering overnight and see if that is a better than a regular steak.
I should have known someone rich enough to buy giant chunks of Wagyu often would buy several jars of the most expensive honey 😂
Maybe try dry aging with beer next time, but how to do that since the liquid will no doubt evaporate. I got it, you can try a beer batter.
Hey Guga, you could compare pineapple tenderize with honey as a tenderizer.
"but it is"           -Guga
Honey eye round
10:31 had me rolling lol
Remember the more powerful the ingredient the less you need with dry aging, Guga used WAY!!! to much honey... also honey like manuka is even more antibacterial than regular honey. So it's natural it didn't develop dry aged flavor when he used so much~  I recommend a tiny amount of honey, just the thinnest layer and using the umi dry bag aswell.
*The eye round is next for sure!*
“Some are soft, some are hard, but all of them are sticky.” -Guga Foods, 2021
HE FINALLY DID IT
Food wars thought me this
i wnna put the pelliculs in like a ground meat blend and see if it give the burger a dry age flavor. but i dont know how much is too much
Do a hazelnut experiment
Angel always looks good but he should definitely keep the long hair, it's working for him.  Oh yeah, the steaks look pretty good too.
"If you want a lot of work and you want to get sticky all over, duet!" - Guga 2021
Manuka honey can be used for cuts and grazes it's a very good antiseptic .
Do a dry age experiment with different Chick-fil-A sauces
Should this be called wet aging instead?
I can see it now.  He's gonna experiment on the $1 steak.
You probably didn't get any of the dry aging flavors because honey is a natural antibiotic that prevented the natural fungus' from forming and giving it that distinct taste.
Do dry aged with whipped cream.👍👍👍
more like wet aged steak
I‘m gonna miss that one guy who always commented that he wants a honey dry aged steak. Rip.
pause at 11:50.. That's the look I would make if a stranger steals a slice of that wonderful beef
I feel like just using the Manuka honey as a marinade would turn out a lot better. Would probably be great for a BBQ brisket or something like that.
DRY AGE IN VEGEMITE!!!
We need this tested as a tenderizer
Wait, Honey?  …I feel like I’ve seen this method used in Shokugeki no Soma (Food Wars) or at least something similar…
Food wars anyone?
Guga “I do not like to waste any food.”  Also Guga experiment with dry age and marinated long it into mush.
Well honey was used as a preservative at times so I'm not suprised that it doesn't taste dry aged at all. Because that's exactly the point of honey. To insulate and protect something. Also a good reason why it helps healing wounds better too.
Every video on YouTube for the last 5 years: "<insert words here> and THIS happened"
That dude in the comments who has been asking for dry-aging in honey for the past several months must be so happy now lol
Guga, you gotta try dry aging beef with coffee grounds as an experiment.  See if any of the coffee oils will permeate into the meat and flavor it.
Up next, honey dry aged eye of round. $1 filet mignon.
Missed a spot
manuka honey and eye round experiment hype
you should do maple syrup
14 day dry age maybe?
Can you dry age steaks in concrete?
Fun fact: Manuka honey is actually used/experimented on in hospital use as an anti-inflammatory inlayed in wound patches. I myself actually used it for inflammations in the mouth.
Try wet honey brine.
Would be cool to see honey butter dry aged steak
I kind of tuned out and thought "oh shoot is this a honey ad" for a moment lol
Do you think if you put it in honey for just a day or something like this? Like in a pinaple?
Do a Dry Age in Bees Wax!
Honey then vacuum seal might work...
To some people this might sound crazy but i add honey and diced onions to meat. Its tasty especially with right crazy
Absolute waste
Honey + aromat powder just a little...make it for 1 day  ..... Won't regret it a bit
Dip one in beeswax
PLEASE MIX HONEY AND PEANUT BUTTER AND USE IT TO DRY AGE PLEASE
0:40 you can see that Guga wrote the text, as "enzymes" is misspelled as "emzymes" the same way as (only) he always pronounces it :D
ou guys are getting really good at being on camera. this is already a great cooking show, but you guys are becoming great actors as well... i love to rewatch the old videos, but the acting was so bad... now its on point!!! thank you guga and friends!!!
Guga saying honey is as sweet and smooth as....honey
dry age on blue cheese
Dry-age in the god butter!!
You should dry age normally first, and just glaze honey before the grill
Well. This honey for sure would make an amazing glaze for Porkchops or a roast.
Good to see Angel back this week here and Sous Vide Everything. I'd love to see them and Mau Mau on a few vids together.  Keep it up Guga!!
Really not worth wasting so good honey and in some countires expensive, i have this luxury than my father is bee keeper and we got honey cheply as u can get becouse when u take honey u need still invest in ur bees and keep them safe for winter.   Also runny honey = Fresh honey, and honey overtime crystalize, rape honey have yellow color, and crystalizes in few month giving nice white/yellow color, other types of honey can be still liquid after a year.
Have you tried using marmite?
I haven't watched the whole thing yet but I sure hope it worked out OK or over $100 of honey plus all that good meat just went in the trash.    Fingers crossed...
Guga: "this is the first honey dry aged piece of meat."  Me, who has read the Wikipedia entry for Mellified Man: "You *say* that, buuut..."
Next episode: "I seasoned my dry age steak with a dry age steak"
This is crazy
2 months from now: “Hello since Angel passed away from eating mold we have a new dried aged experiment”
Anyone getting Food Wars flashbacks?
8:19 end of promotion.
Hey Guga, I kow that you are Brazilian or at least past some time on Brazil, but what about your nephews Angel and MauMau, where are they from?  Greetings from Brazil, I learned a lot about meat and sauces with you!
Dry age in brown sugar?
highly carbonated mineral water, nothing to thank for)
I have a feeling Guga watches food wars (The Anime)
Guga: it's not ... Bud Id isss Angel: No it's not  Guga: Bud it isss
1 steak + 1 steak = experiment
I like the new cooking montage music. It's nice to see a change up every now and then. We all love you Guga! Keep up the fantastic work!!!!
What if you did an overnight marinade instead of a 35 day dry age?
Dry age in bacon fat.
That was awsome Guga thanks man! And tell Angel he's hilarious lol
"Some are soft, some are hard, but all of them are sticky". What meat we talking about here?
Another experiment to try is soaking steak in mead [honey wine] wonder how that will turn out if it'll be any good.
go easy with the honey game it can be dangerous
Nice
I was waiting for that ^^ Too bad the process didn't go as expected, I'm sure there's something to do with honey and meat 🍖🍯
Where is the honey-dryage guy, you've made it man
Why dont you use the hony and put it in the dry age bag ? I think it will make a difference
You didnt cover it good next time deep it and u will Get a better taste
Guga went for 35 days, its too much  11-19 days max
try Dry aging a steak in a mix of the 5 most impressive results when you dry aged. Just the 5 you liked the most :D
not your regular seri kaya
Check out how they make pitina, they cover sausages with corn meal and dry them.

I'm actually planning to sous-vide with a bit of honey! :)
Manuka honey is so disgusting. I have a jar and I only use it for wound treatment.
dry age steak in mango paste
I love Guga, this guy is so awesome
i thought of food wars when i saw the title of the vid
Shokugeki no souma season 1 :3
Why not using prague salt to dry age steaks just like salami or other cured meats?
but but, cant he put the honeyed meat in the plastic bag too ? it would be so good and the honey wouldnt drip from the sides :(
Small tip, you should have refrigerated the honey prior to make it more stable and easier to spread without it dripping! Chilling the meat to just above freezing would also help keep its temperature lower as you worked to cover it evenly.
Dry age steaks in cheese!!!!!!
why not try dry ageing in the bag with some honey? or sous vide in honey?
10:30 close your eyes
It makes sense if you think of it, honey is basically Bumble Bee saliva (if you didn't know saliva also contains enzymes which 'digest/break down' food)  So this honey contains even more Bee spit than the average.
I see you edit man.  Great job.  Usually I skip Angel's reactions, but this time I watched without skipping at all.
Drop it in more liquid honey next time.
I wish I could get as excited about anything in my life as Guga does about a delicious steak.
Lmfao what a waste of meat, just stop this nonsense.
Marinade in worcestershire sauce or a bottle of wine for a week and then dry age it for a month. Then cook it 3 different ways. GO!
"You are going to get sticky up your nose." -Guga
Is this not technically wet aging?
Is it better to buy expensive steak and cook it yourself or just go to a restaurant and order expensive steak?
Guga, can we see a Porco Na mostarda recipe, Guga style hermano! Had it at a Brazilian steakhouse years ago and loved it. Please!
still no dry-age Angel? Wow man we're anticipating
You’re so satisfying I love your voice so MUCH!!!
That manuka honey looks a lot like 'kaya', a Southeast Asian coconut jam. I don't wanna recommend dry aging with it, it's perfect for toast.
Angel looks like Peter from 'The Chosen'
my mum refused to eat regular honey when she started eating manuka honey
Dry age in blood sauce next
Avocado or a kimchi dry age steak? 🤔
Next Episode : i dry aged steak in mashed potatoes
I learned on Salt, Fat, Acid, & Heat honey is quite acidic. I remember this before watching your video. As always, I very much enjoyed it ☺
Dry brine picanha!
Honey on a wagyu A5
you should try coffee grinds
Poor Angel has dry age PTSD lol🤣🤣
Does anyone else feel like they just saw Guga's vinegar strokes?   When he smelled the steak and right after he tasted it. Taco would approve.
Petition to change channel name to Dry-Age Everything lmao
Anything sugary I’ve got a bad feeling about
Honey dry-age VS Pineapple steak?

Very interesting, in some gulf countries we lightly pour honey on meat as well, it goes so well with it.
very great video I really liked the new little edits in there, very good very good keep it up!!!!
Forever waiting for an A5 Cap steak vs A5 Picanha video
No real honey is runny, that's because in America you are allowed to call it honey even after diluting honey with syrups and sugars

Honey miss on sponsoring a honey video.
Next episode: I marinated my steaks in coyote urine!
GUGA12 does not work on Hello Fresh :-(
For meat if that much is green.... it really should go in the bin
how about coat it with honey and dry aged in the bag
I feel like this could have been such a funny video for a Honey sponsorship.
Now do a honey eye of round experiment
Boys you have to grill a steak with honey
I wonder what would happen if you did Carmel
I read this recommendation on his last video. Haha. Cool.
Using considerably thinner layer of honey for 5-7 days for improved flavor without the waste. Seems more useful plus gently warning the honey makes it much easier.
THis wasn't dry aging, it was a wet aging since honey is fluid (and mostly water).... And he seriously needs to rotate the meat daily and ensure it stays fully covered and not just stick them in a fridge for X days that is why he has to always cut off so much.
Ah I will eat that meat with my mead. Skål 😄👏🏻🍻
Do you let your steaks rest? 135 is med rare, if it rests it'll get up to 145 or so. I did this with a tri tip last weekend and overcooked it. I have a 2lb Wagyu A5 ribeye I want to cook, but I'm not sure to what temperature. I'm thinking 115-120 so it'll come up to 125-130, but I don't know. Please help!!
What happens if you boil a steak in open water, bad... But what happens if you boil a wagyu steak?
Try a honey tenderizing experiment compared to pineapple and soda maybe?  Why did you decide to dry age with it? You wouldn't dry age with pineapple, you've seen how mushy it would be, and the text said the honey would do the same thing.
sound design for the coal pour / grill was wack
Hi! So my family tenderizes pork steak with mustard. Is it possible to dry age with mustard?
Why when he was spreading the honey it felt sexual ?
food wars 😝

Angel is annoying
Honey butter MSG dry age next time?
You are the king of cringe
I take Manuka everyday.
that honey is sooooo expensive lol figure it would be the one guga picks.   also i am making a mead from manuka honey currently :)
You should do the honey again but put it in a dry aging bag and vacuum seal it.
step 1: buy a pricey cut of meat step 2: sell your liver to pay for the manuka honey
Why dont you try ice cream dry age
Manuka honey is some of the most potent honey on earth. I just did a research paper on Manuka honey, so this was a really interesting watch for me hahaha
Menos mal que vivimos en un mundo de fantasía y no hay gente con hambre. Me gustaron tus videos pero desperdicias mucho y no respetas a las personas hambrientas ni al producto desperdiciando tanto, fue un animal que dio su vida, lo menos que puedes hacer es comerlo todo. Hay realidades muy diferentes a la tuya, niños que mueren sin un pedazo de pan en la boca, gente que gana 100 dólares al mes y tú tiras medio kilo de carne por unos cuantos likes y hacerte famoso, replanteémonos si lo que haces está bien. Disculpen si les arruino la diversión a algunos, pero me dolió ver el despilfarro, porque hago ayuda social a personas en extrema pobreza.  Good thing we live in a fantasy world and there are no hungry people. I liked your videos but you waste a lot and you don't respect the hungry people or the product by wasting so much, it was an animal that gave its life, the least you can do is eat it all. There are realities very different from yours, children who die without a piece of bread in their mouths, people who earn 100 dollars a month and you throw away half a kilo of meat for a few likes and make you famous, let's rethink if what you do is right. Sorry if I ruin the fun for some people, but it hurt me to see the waste, because I do social aid to people in extreme poverty.
Experiment idea: rum dry aged steak. Let’s do it.
Guga: always listen to your nose.
The honey cost. More than the steak
Next video: "I Dry-Aged Dry-Age"
Pasteurized or un pasteurized?  Honey has known anti bacterial properties UNLESS it gets pasteurized...kills the good stuff in it... Would be interesting to see what Unpasteurized honey would do
Dry age with different sugars?
Guga uye such s great uncle. I hope Angel knows the love being shownm to him by his uncle. When he  sets up shop I'll be first in line
you should do this to a cheap steak
Now this should be interesting
I hope you realize how awesome your channel is bro you are the best out there your voice your vibe your content !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Next Episode: Dry-aged in kangaroo fat…
this guy removes pelicles as if hes cutting the steak in half, DONT WASTE THE MEAT.
Guga, cooking experiment here. Im in the military, can you save a pot roast or chicken mre? I'd love to know if cooking in the field with hydrogen bags is the only way to do it. Thanks!
Next episode: today I’m gonna to dry age myself in pineapple
I already learned this from food wars
do a sous vide honey stake
"your meat will turn into mush" Guga: oh boy i gotta run this experiment
10:29 Guga gets emotional by the smell. 😥
Hmm. A good suggestion. Dry age with knorr soy sauce. Or dip
what if you dry aged steak in liquified steak
I MARINATED Wagyu steaks in coyote piss for 4 months and THIS HAPPENED!!!!!!!!!
9:56 this should be a shirt
Dry age wrapping the meat with wagyuu fat
Guga i have an idea...how about dry aging in caramel ? 😆 cmon guys suport ne 😆
Finally
You should do this again. But do the honey in the bag. :) I bet it would be much much better! Also love your videos keep it going
When at 9:05 you say that "one of the things you cannot see is how tender it is..." you actually, you can!! You can actually see how the meet "shrinkles" or "shrinks" when you start slicing (It happens where the pink part in the middle of the meat is mostly) and that is literally happening because of JUST HOW TENDER that meats IS and LOOKS. Which looks AMAZING!! 🤤🤤
Such a flex, goga is living the life
i think he ate one of the honey steaks
Mmaaaa 10:30
Tekashi 69 has been located
Makes sense it didn't taste dry aged.  Honey  is anti-microbial, so while it might have enzymes that break down the proteins, the controlled "rotting" of dry age would actually be hindered with honey.  It's also hydroscopic, so it'll pull water out.  I'd be curious to see a 15 day regular dry aged then 15 day honey "dry aged".
Here's my thought for where to take this next: You get a honey that's not very viscous and has few or dead enzymes, and you dry age it in a tub of it for various amounts of time.  Let me explain.  Honey is well-known for being antimicrobial which is why it can sit unrefrigerated basically indefinitely.  The reason for this is that honey is a supersaturated solution of sugar and water with very little water.  Thus, any microbes (that aren't spores) die in honey because all their internal water gets sucked right out into the honey via osmotic pressure.  See where I'm going?  So, you take some plastic containers about the size of your test pieces of meat (maybe 0.5-1" buffer on each side), you put a spacer on the bottom so the meat isn't sitting on the bottom, put in the meat, and then pour honey into container until it fills all the empty space and with a 1/2" decent layer on top as well.  Then dry age for varying amounts of time.  This accomplishes many things for the experiment.  1) It keeps the honey in contact with the meat at all times; nothing can slide off like in many dry aging experiments. 2) It's an antimicrobial environment surrounding the meat; no mold or bacterial can grow on the meat at all.  3) It lets you use cheap, liquid honey but not an unreasonable amount since you're only filling a relatively small amount of void space. 4) It should _actually_ dry age the meat.  The effect should be similar to the Umai bags: a one-way direction of liquid flow out of the meat.  In this case it's into the honey via osmosis vs. into the refrigerator air via evaporation.  As long as there's enough honey to absorb all the liquid removed (which shouldn't take much but you could calculate it from previous experiments based on how much lighter meat is after dry aging), there should always be an osmotic pressure of water into the honey.  It will continue to literally dry age your meat.  And it's a very controlled environment.  I think taking the enzymes out of the equation helps that.  You could even dry age in corn syrup as a comparison.  Hell, I bet you could leave a steak _OUT_ of the refrigerator for 30 days, completely submerged in honey, and it wouldn't go bad.  Has to be tried, right?
I taste no difference in dry aged vs regular.  I think people act like it is different because they want it to be different.
Is it pork or beef 🐮?
Mix honey and pineapple
I feel like the meat should be submerged in the honey, because the honey was dripping from the meat and that's why the sides was moldy. But then again that is not called a dry age anymore but oh well.... :b
A video with sprite, honey, pineapple, and  whatever other tenderizer I missed and crown the king.
I'm curious what would happen if the roast was submerged instead of coated. Would the amount of loss be lessened?
10:30
"Meat disintegration"
I got a Meater+ after watching roughly 10,000 of your videos and it's a MUST HAVE! I love that thing!
This reminds me of the first time Megumi and Soma first teamed up in Food Wars.
Dry aged meat in a peach cream and after idk day's. Make a mango sauce to it.
Does this mean you found your eye round solution? Honey tenderizes no?
Você usa umas expressões em inglês de uma forma muito curiosa.
Guga : its sticky everywhere Angel : laughs hard as he thinks about trees (sticky icky)
I dryaged steaks in live bull sharks and this happened ...
Here before 100k
You should do an experiment with different kinds of honey !
Guy who kept on asking for honey dry-age, you finally got it.
Correction: regular honey is not runny, honey with added sugar or corn syrup is runny.
I just wanna know how those steaks go from dry to so so juicy.
Dry age in cream cheese
use it like a pineapple tenderizer instead of dry aging it. we already know that if you cover the steak with something then dry aging it, it won't taste like dry aged steak
Pour your regular honey into a bowl, take a brush, paint it onto your pork tenderloin, coat it in garlic powder with salt & pepper, put that in a freezer bag into your fridge for overnight, take it out to then seal it in a parchment paper & tin foil wrap so that steam stays locked inside, cook in your oven at 300F for 90 minutes. Juicy AF!
Although Manuka aint cheap.
At some point those dry age bags will end up costing more than buying a dry age machine...
Umm did you try grill lamp with honey ? use only salt and black pepper nothing else  After you cook the lamp dip it in honey and try it it’s very testy
I’m so sad he didn’t see all my comments I asked for honey a hundred times
“keistering my steak and dry aging it in my ass for 30 days”
How about incorporating honey into a rub or marinade rather than dry aging? I think we can assume that it’ll seeeten the meat so I’d go with a rub that’ll compliment that sweetness without hiding the taste of the beef. Bet it would go great with Garlic, Sriracha and a little Extra Pepper. Maybe something salt and umami in there like Oyster Sauce.
I would cover it with honey and then vacuum seal it, then less meat would be lost.
It's Soo good seeing angel back
what if you do this then dry age the steak you get from it?
Missed a spot on the rib roast at 2:46
1:31 the regular honey is in that way and It has that consistency. The honey that you call "regular" is not the real one.
I wonder if he took a regular dry aged steak and then marinated it in manuka honey for a few hours if it would be more tender and/or better flavored than a regular dry aged steak.
Says he doesn’t like to waste food….. proceeds to use like 4 jars of honey just to wipe it off
I wonder how it would taste if you would dry age in honey, then remove the honey after 30+ days and then dry age the remainder the normal way again?
Dry age steaks in Bush's Baked Beans
Can I hire you to come cook steaks for me on Father’s Day 🙏🏽😊 I live in Texas haha …
"I dry aged steaks in honey and this happened." Me: Did Angel leave the cast iron outside again, and become the experiment?
Maybe I should put honey in my marinades....
“The cologne is intoxicating “ If you know the reference…
soy & honey marinate over night tho 🤔
Who tf is disliking???
I love my family and all, but if i woke up one day to find them all replaced by Guga i don't think i would complain all that much.
SO LET'S DO WED... best slogan hahaha
"your meat will turn into mush? I have to do this experiment"
Fridge reveal at 3m?!?
Can you double dry age a brisket?
soooo much waste...not good
He actually did it the mad lad
I have a request Mestre. Can you please try a Ssamjang Dry-Age Experiment?
marinade with chicken soup!
Learned that Honey tenderizes Steak on Food Wars 💀
Why not rinse off with cold water and you're going to cut so much off anyways
Dry age in molasses next?
Dude I use to love your videos. But ur getting negative with the do not try at home vibe. Chill out my dude this isn’t cnn
Can you sous vide in honey as well ??
🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️🕊🕊🕊💪💪💪
You know I hope one day we get to see a comparison video of all of Guga’s best experiment results and have them pit against each other to find the best flavored steak
Guga regular honey is not runny too, if its natural there is nothing runny about it, it will form sugar crystals and get that dense structure in no time
8:02 Guga just told me to goto hell,  I'm not even mad.
the websites this guy goes to for research pretty much tells us the educational worth of these videos
Dry age steak in wagyu fat
I've noticed the editing changes when the taste test starts recently. I absolutely love it! Adds more humor and fun to it. Keep it up!
Next time, for dollar steaks. Try the honey, but vacuum seal it like you do normal dry age. Might cut down on some of the exposure that happens because of the honey dripping that causes oxidation.  Also recommend like others did below about complete submergence, like the Pineapple experiment did. Maybe a 3 way comparison of complete submergence between onions, honey, and pineapple?
shoutout the guy who commented this idea on the last video
Your voice is so calming at the start of your videos. Almost game me chills lol
STICKY UP YOUR NOSE
what is up with the zoom ins?
I'm from an South Asian islandic country named Sri Lanka and our ancestors and our grand parents used to preserve red meat dipped in baskets made with pumpkin and filled with bee honey. They didn't know dry aging back then and they didn't have refrigerators to preserve meat. The only way was to keep the meat dipped in honey. They used to dip beef, pork, stag, boar and deer and those preserved meats taste incredibly good.  Cheers from Sri Lanka.
Hi guha
Next video "I dry aged my meat 😏"
maybe try to marinate with Met
Can you make video with dry age scraps? I heard not to toss but is that true?
Thanks for sharing.  One day I will dry the dry age bags you mention.... And the pineapple treatment-- I have used just juice before but will try with a whole fresh pineapple.  Given the amount of expensive honey and waste, for not much more than regular dry-aging, I agree that the honey treatment is not worth it.
Maybe marinate a steak with a honey-pineapple marinade for a few hours?  This seems so wasteful, sorry to say!
you shouldnt let honey touch metal btw
Maybe just marinade in honey for 2 hours?🤔
Angel: Uh Oh, another experiment? I've still got the Koji steak trauma. Guga: I've still got the cast iron pan in the rain trauma so you sit your ass down.
guga i love you but you had no right to make these videos 4K, i was hungry enough in 1080p
Dry age with wasabi paste 😂
Too much plastic in hello fresh stuff
what a waste off meat
Why should we take your word it tastes good
Googa please try beef cube seasoning vs your regular seasoning
I drooled
Faaaala Guga! I saw some guys using the Sous Vide machine, but dipping the meat in PURE WAGUY FAT (without the bag)! Any chance to do that one day?
That's low grade Manuka, the stuff I get is 100+ but it's quite expensive. You can also get medical grade manuka which has healing properties.
Guga make Syrian food ( yabrak) or stuffed vine leaves
Really big waste of meat. Every video the same thing. A lot of meat in the trashcan
now i understand why i have erectile dysfunction.
Try raw green papaya next time
How about dry age in the Umai bag first and then in honey?
I use honey in a lot of my marinades and sauces mainly for its tenderizing effects. Which is weird because I hate honey by itself. Probably one of the best experiments I've had myself is I put a roast in honey for about a day, through that in the Crock-Pot the next day. Best roast I've probably had.
Yo why that honey look so GOOD
You should try to dry age meat in bees wax. That would be awesome!
This experiment was insane 🤯
Dry age a steak in mayonnaise
Has guga ever tried tenderizing a steak with pineapple, and then dry aging it, or vice versa?
Guga’s reaction to the smell at 10:30 has me dying 🤣
Dry age in beef fat/pork fat
What about instead of covering it, simply dropping the steak in a huge bucket of honey?
I love manuka honey. Before you mentioned it i was like i hope it’s manuka expensive but super rich in flavor 😋😋😋
Smoke a dry aged steak
What about sous vide in honey??
Bees liked that
Another Successful Experiment! Thanks Guga!
guga put some stakes in a bowl full of honey and do a time expiriment
35 DAYS!!!!! and u lost all the meat...i think 14 days is enuff
"How many types of diabetes" on 1st place in google search, and you know you are in America - the Land of Obesity.
did you just invent SteakWave music?
How much steak foes this guy have
When it's a dry aging experiment 🤩🤩🤩🤩 but it's not dry aged Angel 😨😨😨😨
You should dry age a steak for 15 days and then trim it up and then dry age it again for another 15 days to see what happens and whether the flavors intensify.
People who watched Shokugeki no Soma already know how this is gonna turn out.
Honey is a known anti-bacterial. It would have been better slice the meat to thin pieces and coat each one with honey
Angel looks like a freaking taliban
Coock a steak in the oven for an hour :O
Video Prevew. I Dry Aged Steaks in a cow carcass.
Guga, when you turn a big chunk of meat into a small steak by dry aging, what do you do with the stuff you cut off?
Dry age a steak in salted carmel 🤷‍♂️?????
"I hope I don't die"  "Remember my skillet?"
am i the only one who remembers food wars?
"Honey-cured ham"
I am sure it tastes amazing but a super small glass of manuka honey costs 39.- Swiss Francs here in Switzerland. I think i wouldnt "waste" 3 glasses of that honey on just one steak 🤷‍♂️ but it may works with other type of honey too... cheers
We asked and he delivered
You didn't use engouh honey, or honey that was set enough (it was waaay too runny). It shouldn't be dry age attempt but more like dunking meat into a bowl of honey, with a false bottom allowing the meat to be in contact with honey from underneath as well. You didn't make a perfect coating, in the video you can easily see spots that weren't covered properly. Those are the spots where your meat later on turned rotten...
do dry age in miso next plz
caramel dry age
Mayonnaise dry age,mustard,lemongrass,scallion,garlic paste
I appreciate that when Guga says, "Now that is something you do not see every day" it's always something I've NEVER seen before.
what about marinating the meat in honey overnight or something instead of 35 days? honey experiment part 2?????
Tell Angel to cut off that ponytail!
Honey doesn’t go bad!
12:16 I feel like Angel was going to recommend something but he never got to explain it
Dry age a steak in Blood please :D
Why is there a loooot of camera effects that distracts us?
Leave it to Guga to find the one reference that misspells “Emzymes” (enzymes), making it seem like he hasn’t been saying it wrong all along.
While honey might work but not be an enjoyable means of dry aging, it might make for a decent marinade ingredient for short term use in a fridge.  Sure it will still be sticky, but with the marinade you can rinse it off before seasoning & cooking.  Just my thoughts on the subject.
Guga. There's an episode on Chef's Table on Netflix of this guy who owns this restaurant where he cooks EVERYTHING over a wood fire. His dry age steaks are dry aged for 200 days! He covers them in fat during the 200 days, but what kind of fat I have no idea.
i knew this one from shokugeki no soma
Dry age in wine!
Goes to Google how many types of honey are there. Google: How many types of diabeetus are there.....
hey Guga, some people compare you to world-renouned chefs like Gordon Ramsey and Salt Bae, so what do you say about making some collaborations with famous chefs?
That looks zero like honey but ok
Angel is back!!!!!
i thought that later in this video guga would say "thank you honey for sponsoring this video"
Can you try Dry aging in any of the better than bouillons
You've been really enjoying using different angles when filming your reactions huh Guga? Lol I've been noticing it a lot more
Idea palico jerky marinade it in a jerky sauce  before you dry aged, and see what happens to the steak and the palico.
Wow you literally just wasted some of the best honey 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 WHY MAN WHY.
Just realized that Guga keeps saying and typing "emzymes" instead of "enzymes", and I can't stop hearing it😂😂
“Some are soft, others are hard, but all are sticky” 3:25 Bruh you gotta know what you’re saying😂😭
Is there a video where only guga is tasting the food? maaan all i need is his pure comments and on how it really tastes like unlike angel and maumau like... their words are scripted i mean no harm but yeah.
That is not how u preserve meat in honey. You can preserve meat in honey even at room temp, but u put a bit of honey in a jar, u put the meat, u fill the jar with honey. Its gonna keep the meat fresh for months at room temp. Also when its done, while you can reuse the honey (would not recommend eating it has a bit of a strange taste).
I would love to see Guga tenderise a Wagyu A5!
I love how guga bought one of the most expensive honeys on it.
nobody: not even a soul: manuka honey: i am peanut butter
Dry age steak in miso paste!
Guga if you have any honey left, I would love to see how it actually works and tastes as a tenderizer and marinade. Probably not good taste profile for steak , but pork since pork marinades are often sweet and sometimes contain honey. I'm wondering if it works better then pineapple since I've tried that and results were that meat was too mushy.
Could you half dry age it the proper way  for like 20 days and then 15 days to finish it off with the honey so you still have the dry aged taste but get the extra tenderness from the honey?
this gives me Shokugeki no Soma vibes
Enzymes!
The editing was extra on point in this episode! Great content 👌 Ty
Coming up next, I dry aged a Wagyu A5 with black pepper.
How about try dry aging with curry paste/powder ?
Hello fresh is actually nice
Guga activating my Google assistant 👁️👄👁️
what about pineapple marmalade or pineapple jam ?
Do pineapple jam dry aged 🥺
You should try dry aging in miso paste!
Of course Guga buys the wagyu of honey lol.
Too much digital zoom on this video Guga
You should dry-age a steak for 35 days, take off the pellicles, than dry age again
been so long since i saw angel he looks like 6ix 9ine
Now Dry age the steaks with Sugar.
Do a kombucha marinade.
When are you gonna dry age  angle?
Finally angel is back!
Mad honey
fun fact : Honey can't expire and become dangerous for consumption (it may loose some taste tho), because it's basically bee's vomit
Next challenge: *dry age meat in meat*
That's really expensive honey
Dry age in bacon fat!!!!!
try meat and caramel
what next? dry aging a cooked steak?
He was left with ONE STEAK from a TWO-BONE RIB ROAST and the one thing thing that bugged him the most was that the experiment was STICKY. I don't know how to feel about this :D
Maybe dry age in honey in a dry age bag?
Guga, how about doing it with bee wax!!?
But guga, you put honey and it melt over the 35 days...  maybe thats why it didnt get the dry-age umami, why dont you try to cover in honey and then vacum seal in order pack the honey in its place?    im 100% sure it will change de results.
I swear this is what the honey looked like in Winnie the Pooh when I was a kid
I worry one day we will see a report that guga has died of botulism.
Your honey looks like honey mustard
Guga you got to do a beef bacon video
I believe we (asians) use honey to tenderise it for a few minutes or an hour before cooking it or cook with it.
Love these guys.
Congrats Guga, you're going to attract Food Wars weebs with this video lmao.
Next time try Dry Age Iberian Pork
Alright I know the commenter is here somewhere. You been begging for this for awhile. I see you bro.
Sorry Guga, its not world's first honey dry-aged :)
i miss the old angel/guga dynamic. Nowadays I cringe when angel talks
Something about the guga foods logo makes me think this wasn’t always the name of the channel lol
I wonder if he’s ever mixed up the dry aged steaks because on this one I couldn’t tell which one was which lol.
finaly
Every arab watching this video manouka
Guga where’s the cheese wiz dry age experiment
did guga just fossilized a steak?
Guga if you are looking to switch it up a little, from wagyu, I just bought some Iberico pork for fathers day, for myself.  Do you think you can do some more Iberico soon?
EXPERIMENT IDEA: Have you tried to turn wagyu into Beef Jerky?  I'm actually curious what the effect would be.  Would it still taste better then traditional jerky?  They usually use crappy beef for jerky.  I can understand if you don't want to waste that type of meat though..
Next should dry age Angel hahaha just kidding
Anyone who watched Food Wars knows……
Guga, can you do a dry aged with garlic? Cause I'm kinda curious🤔
Just use it with pineapple as a quick marinade. Lol.
The hints that Angel kept dropping kindof make me think he hasn’t been in a vid for a while cos Guga’s last ‘experiment’ left him bowing to the porcelain god…
Real honey isn't runny.
Try the shokugeki no Soma recipe for Beef Bourginon. The recipe requires using honey massaged into the meat as a tenderizer.
when you suddenly realize yukihira souma is not trolling when he used honey in the meat
Thanks to  Bees Insect Legends for sponsoring this video.        Guga please make Kangaroo meat. 🦘 🥩 🔥
See what is better cooking a steak in butter vs duck fat vs pork fat vs beef fat.
Guga now time for Kangaroo meat I’ve been asking over a year.
Manuka honey "never heard of it"?!!! Guga, my guy! As an Aussie, and a kiwi, that breaks my heart
I love Gugas videos but they're starting to feel like a commercial for Google. Maybe blur out the google logo?
I hope that the person that recommended this every day is happy.
Before this starts....jeez this just sounds nasty!!!
The editing went up hella in this video
Angel's haircut needs some tenderizing
why
"I Dry-Aged my nephew in honey"
Manuka honey is used in medical field to heal wounds. Im a veterinary and we use it all the times
Food wars 🥵
What would happen if you honeyed then use a dry age bag also?
Why does angel look and sound exactly like 69?
Thank you for doing this experiment! Have been waiting for it for a long time. Can you do a tree bark dry age next?
so now it's time to dry age steak in Angel's beard and hair
Dude still says emzynes after all these years haha
Do eyeround with honey please and see if it tenderised
Time to test tenderizing eye round steaks in honey?
10:30
Noooooo the classic guga song is no more
Get some of that honey that gets you high.
Next Upload: dry age a steak in miso
next video : *I dry aged maumau*
Yo Guga, you should change the channel name to Dry Age everything!
do a video taste test on the dry age pelicose
Wiat but didn't you find out that soda water workes better?
Watch out for that botulism!!
Try putting honey on steaks
Guga can you try cooking a vegan steak and a regular steak the exact same way and get Angel to try them
Next experiment. Inject wagyu fat in every meat
Me who watched Food Wars : i already know the results
Do a salt dry aged steak
Indian marinate meat in yogurt. You didnt discover anything mate
Dude Manuka wood (where this honey comes from) is the best in the world for smoking fish. Its completely unknown outside of New Zealand. TRY IT!!
Wait, what if you dry age and then use a tenderizer 🤔🤔🤔
candied steak?
Why not use umami powder + beef tallow / butter combination for dry aging then my dude?
Man this looks like caramel that honey
is this the first time Guga mentioned black pepper without "freshly ground"
Cheers to that one guy who has been requesting this for like 6 months lol
Day 5 of Asking guga for dry age spam with msg
Honey dry aged vs honey marinated?
Should try ash
Hablas español no lo voy a escribir en inglés. Hay un tipo de miel, la verdad no se a que se deba pero es menos liquida y estoy seguro que se adiere mejor que la que usaste. Supongo que quedaría mejor por que tiene menos "humedad" esa miel.
How about just don't do ANY Dry Ageing, it is such a HUGE waste of meat. I don't care how " Good " it taste, there is so many other things you can do for a great taste without wasting all the meat. I mean it's your money. do what you want with it but I still say it's Idiotic !
I have an experiment suggestions so I learned in my nutrition class that Papaya also has digestive enzymes knows as papain which a proteolytic enzyme that breaks down protein which would make it a good meat tenderizer.
Sorry for my bad english
Could you dubel dry age so you take a big peace off meat and dry age it then cutt it upp and dry age it agien
Next : KIWI PLEASE!!
i love ur experiment same as i hate ur video.. especially when u made me want to eat a steak at 3am
Manuka is actually used in the medical industry!
I thought it was Biscoff when I saw the thumbnail. You should try that next 😂
Get yourself a callous shaver to shave the dried meat. It saves more meat by not having to cut off bigger chunks than what you need.
Who edited this? Made me dizzy.
When this video appear in my feed I was like: "Ok guga, ok";
I think the reason there's no dry age flavor is because the honey killed all the bacteria that gives the meat the flavor.
7
I thought that was caramel
I think the mistake done here is that the meat marination should have been made with less time than the dry-aged meat.
Let's just agree that guga living the dream.
What about covering it in honey and then sticking it in the dry aging bag?
Not only would the stickiness prevent me from ever doing that, but dry aging meat is a waste of meat. Look at the huge piece of meat Guga had and only got 3 steaks from it. You can feed a family of 5 for a week with all that meat, but he got 3 steaks.....
He finally did it, I’ve been waiting for this
Dry age a cheap steak in cheese. Melt cheddar cheese slices on the steak. Make sure it seals or sticks to the meat.  Then stick it in the fridge for however many days you want.
Dude stop naming your videos "I did this with this and this happened"
Yes NZ made it on your video 🇳🇿🇳🇿🤍
I keep thinking one day Guga will accidentally show us him seasoning the other side of a steak. I'm not quite sure how I would feel about it though.
can you use the bits you cut off for stew or something?
Will never understand why you use pepper. I only use salt to ensure max meat flavour. For me pepper masks the flavour of any meat.
BTW: the correct mold is absolutely no problem. Check out some of the great, amazing Hungarian or Italian salamis. Some of them are covered end to end in a special white mold, but that gives it an absolutely delicious flavor and is completely harmless.
Yukihira soma taught me that honey can be used to tenderize meats.
looks like “ear wax”
I remember this on foodwars  soma used this for his stew if i remember correctly
I remember learning about the honey tenderness thing from the anime Food Wars when Soma added it to a roast
Sees Guga video, instant click.😁
So you gonna try Eye-Round dry-aged in honey?
ok now we all know it is time for : pineapple VS carbonated water VS honey tenderizing experiment
It's not exactly dry aging when honey is... well, wet.
I like the new editing Guga
Wait , if he dry aged for 35 days each video , but every video is next other 1 day , how
I just wanna see how u get the honey off.
I heard "when i guga ", then turn on cc " when i google" now that's  right
Its like u saw an episode of "So Expensive" and then cooked what they showed.
"It breaks down meat like there is no tomorrow". what does that even mean
Hey Gugua, any reason you don’t use the reverse sear method anymore?
Guga don’t use metal on the honey I think the metal kills the enzymes 😬
Angel looks suprisingly good after being dry aged for nearly 2 months.
Guga please try regular honey to tenderize in Walmart steaks.
could you dry age steaks in different types of minced meat- pork chicken fish- in the dry age bag!
Guga you should definitely do something like a top 10 best expirments you’ve done so far. So we have a better idea on which ones where the most worth doing so.
Guga is Gold. Dude thanks for these videos.
There is probably like 5 steaks dry aging right now in his fridge at this very moment
Dry age burger?
Dry age steak with garlic paste.
Yooooo that was such a waste of Manuka honey, you know those jars are like 15 dollars each and all honey has enzymes- Manuka is just worshipped by weird essential oil hippy people.
My saliva is dripping. 🤤🤤🤤🤤
mmmm steak covered in bee vomit. *drools*
Dry age just seems like such a waste of meat. You have to cut away so much. Meat is getting too expensive to do this
Dry aged in brown sugar!
Could you possibly age tougher cuts, like a flank steak, in honey?
It would be better to do regular dry age,process the meat and then use the honey.
Ok that was expensive…
What type of knife is he using to slice the steaks? The long one with rounded tip?
Honey, I'll have a steak please.
Guga, dry age some wagyu and make jerky out of it
So my suggestion if you do use honey is to marinade with it instead. Just make sure it's a cut without a lot of fat or it will taste like candy in the end. I learned this with it getting on the fat of a picanha.
In the experiment where you cooked a stake sous vide put it in the refrigerator again and are it again you didn't put a crust on it
Guga do braised honey beef!!!
Next video: different time for steaks coated with honey (1h, 6h 24h, 48h)
I dry aged steak in my tummy
"That is not something you see everyday"  Im waiting til the time Guga uses one of these tests on a daily basis lol
Honestly its really cool that you share this hobby with angel
i was waiting for this
Man hearing the grilling music reminded me of Spider-Man: The New Animated Series from way back in 2003 for some reason.  Nostalgia mood.
10:30 food ogasm
For "next level" honey, you need Tasmanian Leatherwood Honey. Really strong flavor
Try dry age steak with ice cream
Manuka honey tastes nasty.
What about rinsing the honey off with some warm water and your hands? And then refrigerating it for some 10 minutes to harden it back, so you can cut it easily
I learned this in an anime called food wars
well maybe use the honey for just 24 hours or 48 max just to tenderize it like with pineapple.
Guga , why dont you use plastic dry age bag on top of ur experiments? That would probably be a much safer way to cook meat.
Guga: Includes in video title "... and this happened"  Me:  * *click* *
Make nepali momo
Only 3 steaks from that beautiful piece of meat, this is a crime against beef.
10:30 yo Guga you good??
Sadly the GUGA12 code doesn't work in the Netherlands...
14:17  Guga: "Don't do it".
EMZYMES!!!!?????
Can you please try to make a dry aged beef jerky
I'm pretty sure this would be wet aging
I really want to hear Angelo speaking spanish
I haven't even watched the entire video and I know his steak is gonna be mush  Edit: I and probably many other people have been proven wrong
The final taste testing could be a Manolo & Tony Montana cooking show, if there was one
I remember seeing the comment asking for this and I replied “maybe he’s making the video now”
What can you do with left trim dry aged meat ?
Use Caramel next time.
He could reuse the honey in a sauce.
your next experiment should be getting the toughest part of the caw but in wagu to see if wagu is truly tender all around of course in stakes
Salt + pepper + lime + garlic + chili = steak source 🤝 trust me
Now do this with wagyu
Honey is some of the most fascinating substances on earth
Do you think you could do a bison vs beef experiment? I’d love to see your take on a bison ribeye
Why isnt Angel in the description? i want to dry age him
Dry age in beef fat or tallow.
You should try to dry age a steak in Greek Tahini.
Someone should watch Shokugeki no soma :v
that was probably the most expensive dry-aged experiment in history.
I honestly think this would work better for pork. Forget honey cures, dump a whole ass ham in and see what happens
That Manuka honey is money
Someone stated marshmellow fluff in another video
You have to take the pellicles, form them into a paste and dry age something in dry aged pellicles
Next dry age it in beeswax
I laughed so hard at 10:30 The editing hahaa
Now time to dry age your meat
Angel should be the one to turn to mush.
Tenderise eye of round with honey.
me having food wars flashback  hmmmm hungry
Viewers: can you dry age a steak in..... GUGA: YES
Ok so like no lie I work for a packaging company I swear to god hello fresh boxes are the worst to deal with
I get the feeling that Guga and Yukihira Soma would be besties.
Ketchup?
"It will destroy the meat" ight let's try it
"Listen to your nose" 🤔🤔🤔
Yet another step in the process to determine the best method to dry age Angel...
What a waste of meat  and honey
Dry aged in caramel
EXPERIMENT IDEA!   Why don't you try dry aging meat in sugar?
Can you dry age fish ? 🤔 💭
So we've now gotten the Shokugeki no Soma honey-dry-aged-beef answer. Does honey make beef tender?  Yes.
i spy a new editor was hired
Now do dry aging steaks with grounded steaks
This has nothing to do with dry aging. It doesn't matter if you block the air with a ziplock bag or honey. It's still wet aging. No wonder there's no dry age taste when you wet age.
if you had smellovision your show would be pure torture
@10:30 Did Guga just have an orgasm?
Manuka honey is very expensive, 3 bottles?
3:28 Me and the boys at the sleepover
"Let'z Doooo IT" ! :-)
In my culture we preserve meat in Honey. Surely other cultures do that too. It removes moisture from the meat and reduce microbial activity I think.
Dry age using Chinese Salted Fish
Guga that said "Emzymes" 🤣🤣🤣
Its not dry ageing
just look for real honey, real honey from my parents friend bees farmer in a room temperature gets hard and white like a wax would do and one from shop that made not by bees is like a liquid even in a fridge.   also bees that only collect single type of flowers is unhealthy bees, lack of nutrition, real natural honey that made by nature without humans interference is made from many diferent flowers that grow wild in fields with no pesticides
How much was that honey? Bet you cried
probably the next video: i Dry-aged steaks in kerosene😂
maybe you should try honey with less enzyme than the one you used. also, we all know 35 days is perfect for a regular dry-age (and for some based on your past experiments) but maybe too long for one with more enzymes
That friends, is not something you see every day. If you think I’m throwing the trimmings away, you’re absolutely out of your mind. Extremely tender. Exactly the way the way I like them. Complete amounts and ingredients in the description down below. This is what I was left with. So let’s do it!
fun fact: manuka honey costs a fortune guga didnt even mention it - and he bought like 1.5 kgs of it 😳...probably worth 100 dollar or so
Needed to put the dry-aged honey steak into a dry-aged bag. Boom.
Guga... Try dry aging the steak first then put the honey and see if it's good or nah
missed opportunity to sousvide the honey to make it spread easier.
Finaly :O
Damn so that’s why it’s called sweetmeat
Next : Beef Bouillon cubes 😅
i'm really enjoying the editing on this one! keep it up, guga!
3:13 "listen to your nose" deaf guy: *visable confusion*
Angels eating mold? damn bruh he gonna be the next Ethan Winters
You can also apply the honey as a natural mask👌
Try durian dry aged
Strong tenderizing properties? Break out the eye round

mustard
This video shows us how rich Guga is now XD edit: Manuka Honey is like the Wagyu of Honey
The cool thing about my home country is, that we have had dryaged steak since forever and used it as regular steak its calles "abgehangen" and has always been done by the butchers here XD
Manuka honey means the bees don't shag about. They pollinate just one plant instead of whoring about
so we preserve meat by honey then?
This is what you call food porn👌
Guga12 hello fresh
I dried aged steak in seamon
A crazy you
There are so many of your "dry aged" videos that I think equate more to a wet age because the water has no way to escape.
Dry age and then grill vs sous vide
take a tank of honey and just dunk the meat :)
I remeber they did this in Food Wars :D
You should try pure ceylon( srilankan ) bee honey...our native tribes been using honey to preserve meat for ages.they used to soak meat in honey wrap it up in leaves and keep them in hallow tree trunks for later use....i guess thats kind of a dry aging 🤔. But also thats mostly game meat like..Deer or Wild Boar.
a tip to make ur life easier: if u cut away the outsides anyways: might as well rinse the dry aged steak under running water instead of painstEakingly scraping <whatever u put on it this time> off little by little
Dry age the steak in dabs....that'd be siiiiiick
Uh he isn't a Shokugeki no Soma fan Is he?
Next : I Dry aged with anti aging cream
oh I bet that honey would be SO GOOD with some pork chops, getting it all tender in a marinade of some kind and flavoring to get that sweet pork goodness.
NEXT episode: dry aged steak in sour cream Guga if you can get Estonian sour cream bbecause they are the inventors of sour cream And get 20% onr because less then 20% it will be watery
You should do half of the dry age process with honey to break down the fibers and then clean it off and finish the dry age process the normal way for the dry age flavor
Is Googa Loosing weight?! he looks much slimmer.
I had to order some UMF 20+/MGO 850+ Manuka honey.  $70 for 8oz.  YOLO.

OMG I JUST DID MY OWN EXPERIMENT! I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU WHEN I DID IT TOO!. pineapples. dryage. liquid smoke. freeze dry..... take crushed PineA. freeze dry it leaving some juice excess to the side. REHYDRATE WITH JUICE LIQUID SMOKE MIXTURE. DRY/WET-AGE IT. when i say tender..... the bone fell off and man.... the pinapple isnt TOO strong. ITS SO GOOD. PLEASE TRY THIS.
Maybe sprinkle it with MSG before applying the Honey to get the Umami.
Hi Guga.... Have you ever tried wet aging with coconut milk...    That should be an experiment
Oh finally angel is back

Tenderize cheaper cuts with honey
You should try dry aging using fruit roll ups
Single steak tenderizing experiment with honey is what people are probably waiting for now
Guga did you taste the manuka honey before putting it on the steak? Its different to regular honey. What on earth did three tubs cost? At least you will be super healthy. Thanks for doing this because I could never afford or have the heart to use manuka like this. Guga rocks and so does manuka honey.
Yeah chur bro up the Manuka
Can you dry age steaks with beacon????
Do a marshmellow fluff dry-qge experiment next
Honey is awesome
This was epic and love this, I need to buy that honey now! Thanks Uncle Guga! 💯💯💯
Video idea - Cook steaks exactly the same, but cut them differently when serving (Against the grain, with the grain etc) and see if you can tell the difference.
Winnie The Pooh fav dish, probably.

It’s the Return of the “Man” Bun part 2.
I think these taste tests are better without all the camera transitions, anyone else agree?  Great video nonetheless!!
You must use malaysia honey... It call tualang honey.. (madu tualang)
Guga undersells how expensive that honey really is.
The only mad scientist America needs or wants
EXPERIMENT IDEA : Make a dry-aged steak covered in melted cheese
Omg u not suppose to use metal spoon on honey omg. Guga i tht u the expert. U just distroy the honey
What if you do it but inside the bag same as the regular
Could you use that honey on the steak, after you dry aged it so the enzymes can penetrate and make it more tender ?
“That is something you do not see every day” Unless you watch the video every day lol
Dry age a steak in super hot hot sauce
Honey vs pineapple
What the background music in the beginning?

White mold is usually a penicillin type mold.
Guga please make a wagyu bms 7-8 (SIRLOIN vs RIBEYE) 🙏🙏🙏 Much love from Sweden  And btw make the video wit Angel, he is too funny to miss in that video
I think you probably just wet aged it...
What kind of honey was that?  It's not liquid at all.
Next episode :- " I dry-aged steaks with angel"
need an experiment where you use the pellicle, like leaving it on the steak or using it in burger meat
Guga, mate, we're here and we like your vids. You don't need clickbait titles.
I learned this from good wars xD
From What i know is that honey is the ideal ingredient that i use to tenderize my meats... so lol i was not surprised at all
Let’s do it!
Try to put honey and THEN in a dry aging bag.
“*I dry aged steaks in water*”
What happens if you put honey (or any of your other experimental coverings which didn't seem to stay on) on it and dry age it in a dry ageing bag? Will that help keep the honey on evenly?
Now for the Honey Waygu... mind explosion, venturing forth down the cosmic lane of meat and sweet
Dude casually buys hella expensive manuka😂
Next time on Guga: Dry aging steaks in Jell-O

Try to dry age in honey for like 2 months or smth. Mb honey didn't done anything cause of its viscosity(But you need to use twice amount of honey)
I'm not dying today 😂
dry age a cut of meat in orange/lime with the skin and juice
give angel the same steak and tell him to try it
11:10 - 11:13  Sounds like Guga's gonna have a meme template on this one. 😂
Maybe you will get a better result with a wet age rather than dry age technique with honey (that's technically what you have been doing anyway, and may be you won't lose 2/3 of the usable beef because of it)
Jeez, the honey worked out beautifully despite the massive amount of loss.
Guga you need to cook a steak in boiling sugar. Please candy steak. Slice it up before cooking, cook the pieces like hotpot. And let us know
Teach me master how to listen from my nose
Ooohhh wow 🤤 I’d love to see this redone with the honey coated roast getting sealed in an umai bag first. I feel this would keep the honey from dripping off and add another layer of protection from oxidation 😸👍 :edit: could you do that with whipped maple? In the bag? 🙏🙏🙏
dry age with paste made out of dried and crushed pellicle
no matter how good it is that just wasted 30 bucks minimum thats 2 weeks food if your smart with it.
Hi Guga, I was in Costco and noticed they had grain fed Japanese Wagyu A5 beef and were selling it for $80/lb. The marbling looked legit. I'd love to hear your opinion on it if you can get your hands on it!
I think you should try to dry age with cow's poo. Up?
How about tenderizing steak with honey marinate?
I would like to see how it works as a tenderizer as well, comparing it to things like the pineapple juice and seeing which is better.
say hi to daddy
I, was here, and damn that steak is tender.
This is getting out of hand.
Guga, I wonder: seeing how much wagyu you eat, do you think your own body is absorbing that fat and turning into a5 human?
Please try dry aging with avocado 🥑🙏
do combo dry age
the lighting up the grill and grilling it always looks so satisfying
What a waste of that precious manuka honey
We use manuka honey as medcine, its like 50 quid a jar and this donnies putting it on steak lmao
Goooogaaaa gang
You seldom see people who just seem happy in life. In a world full of negativity, its refreshing to see.
Well you should make a hello fresh meal vs your meal comparison video
lol dry aging with manuka honey is like using a diamond crusted/edged butter knife to cut bread.
Honestly, it sounds delicious but all that meat wasted for one steak doesn't sound as great lol
Dry age in BBQ sauce!
Can you inject regular fats like bacon  fat, butter and STANDARD beef fat(no wagyu fat) in a standard, cheap steak and compare it with wagyu?

Dry age within a liquid? I know its not a runny honey but is it dryage or wetage? Anyways, it looks mouthwatering!!!!
Of course Guga will never let Angel eat white mold. He's a good uncle. Green mold however...
Cook two of the exact same steaks and trick your nephew into thinking there is a difference
Dry age in horse semen.
Try making foods your family doesn't like taste good
Instead of using the title "I DRY AGED Steaks in xxx and yyy happened" you can use "How to make a steak so terrible for people to eat to a point where they will vomit it on your face when tasted"

My man you missed the opotunity for a honey sponsorship.
I remember an episode from Food Wars where Soma did something similar to this.
sweet dreams are made of bees   who am I to diss a bee
Tenderize a stake in horseradish sauce
This one surprised me as I had read of using honey to preserve meat.  And even to preserve bodies for burial in which they basically mummified.  Maybe it has to do with temperature though, as the cases I heard of this usually involved hot climates if I remember right.  I also thing they were more submerged that covered in honey.  Now I'm tempted to do more research.
Honey vs pineapple!
Dry age steaks in the vacuum of space!
Hi guga I absolutely love and enjoy your videos and I'd like if you can make wagyu biltong it a south African favorite meat snack...

Hello, Will you watch food wars anime and maybe make one of the dishes from it ?
I don’t like the new background music
Shokugeki no Soma HAHAHA. I learned that honey can be used as tenderizing agent
Guga, why not use honey powder. I think the brand of honey you used make honey powder as well.
Guga, you should try dry aging in duxelles!!! Just think of the extra flavor it could provide!
I have a question, can you dry age with sugar?
Try using bee wax
The Angel/Guggenheim dynamics in this one were through the roof, and the editing took the cake. I don’t usually laugh that much at steak experiments.  Good video!
Dry age steaks in instant ramen powder, DO IT GUGA DO IT (Maggie curry) <— legend
EXPERIMENT IDEA: Tenderising meat in blended onions! We do this all the time in the Middle East and the enzymes in the onion break down even the toughest fibers, but it tastes amazing unlike pineapple!
YES HE DID IT THIS CALLS FOR A CELEBRATION
Do dry aging in a mound of salt to see if it speeds up the process since salt pulls moisture out and the Umai bags don’t let stuff in.
Honey Tenderize some Eye Round $1 steaks...

Awesome as always
“Listen to your nose.” -Guga 2021
Imagine he said at the beginning: thanks Honey for sponsoring this video.
Google: don't let the meat in honey for too long or it will turn into mush Guga: 35 days doesn't seem like too long
you should buy enzymes that make the meat tender and dry age it with it
Been long since mystery meat
But we love your videos really we do
Please can you try make a chicken covered with grinded corn flakes?
Hey Guga really great episode ! but you should check the show Food Wars, the chef there always as a trick to tenderize beef fast with honey, maybe it would work better/faster on smaller cuts.
what about dry aging a steak in pecan powder
Now this is cooking!!!😋😋😋
Ok we need a honey vs pineapple 🍍 experiment  and also combine pineapple and honey together? Just to see what happens
Cheers everybody!
YUKIHIRA SOMA!!!!!!
Dry age steak in Wagyu fat
How about a steak dry aged with bees ?
Dry age using beeswax
Guga, i think doing it in your hot ambient temperatures / room temp is what made it also so difficult to get the honey on and for it to stay on the steak, maybe if the honey jar was also in an ice bath and churn it cold or put it in the fridge first and get it slowly up to the temp that its still not so runny it would then cover the steak evenly and stay covered in the fridge. At least I think it would
Oooo how I would love to try one of Guga's steaks!
He did it!! He finally did it! Good job everyone for keep pushing him to do it!

Guga, all your videos are great, but this new editing style is ruining it for me, I really prefer the other format without all those cuts and close ups, it is not doing anything for your content which is great on it's own.
