Pease fix antialiasing, is dated and distturbing
elite dangerous is dead and frontier killed it with their never-ending bad decision and total inability to listen to anything. Thanks dave! Way to effectively communicate.
how do I buy a ship in odyssey? I bought the game and expansion two days ago and I'm lost. Please help Elite Dangerous team.
What a joke
Forging your framerate to 30.
TAKE MY MONEY. <3
Now finally Elite Dangerous will be a complete competitor to the Star Citizen experience. hopefully with WAY more FPS and way less bugs.
I've had my eyes on this title since it came out but for some reason I postponed it. Now Odyssey is coming out and I'd like to know whether there will be a possibility to switch between 1st and 3rd person perspective. Does anyone have an answer? I'd like to plan my finances accordingly.
I took elite years ago on ps4 and xbox but I abandoned it because it was not in my language.  Serious mistake .. this year for Christmas I bought it back.  I took a notebook a pen and started writing notes to study and translate it and I can say that I have arrived at king in the empire.  For me it is the best game of my life.  Never give up games that you don't understand immediately study them love them.  Thanks Elite for your emotions for all of us
RIP SC
I always hated the game but I also loved it. Came back every year and tried to continue my journey. But since you can join squadrons there is this huge mmo part that keeps me playing! Well done Frontier! Looking forward to the new expansion
In Elite Dangerous Odyssey, will it be possible to build bases on land?
Pink teeth
Ah yes, lots of people comparing this to Star Citizen even though they're two completely different games. Just remember that this expansion for ED is basically just vehicles but a little more robust in the way that it's programmed. There are no ship interiors. Star Citizen's code is exceedingly different and far outside of the scope of design that ED is. There isn't enough time in comments to go over the overwhelming difference in methodology being used and extensibility of the two games.   They're just different games. It's okay. Zero reason to try and compare them.
guys dont screw this up... small steps  !  step by step ... we are grateful for a little.. every scifi adult scifi fan like me can appreciate your humble effort... make it functional, and later you can add things... but i cheer for you.. your new player ! :)
The fact that this is causing Star Citizen to die before it has even released is beautiful
Community: happy about the big update Me: lazer rifle will go peew
Well if you can get drunk in a game, it will be a good game.
Finally, inter-station taxis!
Wtf...this is what im waiting for.Looks awesome.
I dont care for how he keeps saying they will "allow" us to do these things.
Wonderful! Next update after this,for game to be perfectly,is aliens,diferent species,techs,equipments,ships and animals. I hope to future update,to chose my race from aliens,humans,cyborgs,etc. And to start from a diferent part of galaxy.
I wish I could walk inside my ship, for example in cargo and exploration ships having quarters for your crew and you could costumize it, you could make your ship feel like a small home
I just wish it wouldnt cost 30 fucking dollars
damn son you makin me cry
1:56 The Bartender  Lmao, casting shade
If there is no Mos Isley, I will revolt...
Супер!!!👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
All y'all have to do is add player owned corps with sovereignty mechanics like eve, along with a basic player owned market/crafting system and you would basically have the best game of all time.  Currently it's just a space sim with really no end game, thousand mile wide pond that's 1 inch deep. Player owned sov focused pvp should be that end game, fueled by a player driven economy.  Essentially copy some of the player driven stuff from EVE and you would have the best MMO that has ever been created.
"Collect samples of organic life", hell yeah. If they accomplish this, the game will be an unique full experience. I mean the scale 1:1 of the galaxy is already awesome enough, but to get to walk on them... that's only but a dream for our generation, one that'll be accomplished through digital means. Makes me wonder if we're part of a digital simulation, but of course those kinds of questions, will never have an answer.
Nice job!
I really hope you don't just stand in front of your ship and "Press 'F' to enter". I want to press 'F' to open the hatch and walk in and explore my ship's interior before I sit down in the commander's chair to take control of my baby. I'd also love for my mate to come aboard and go and sit in the gunner's chair, and maybe another one to sit in the navigator/engineer chair to launch and fly fighters and set jump points etc. This is really all I ever wanted for Elite, but all the extra stuff seems really cool and hopefully we get ship interiors to go along with it.
3:58  Flashbacks of all the grind and all the nerfs to anything allowing us to escape it through lucrative goldrushes...
Awesome stuff! Cant wait...
I'll just do ship watching at a busy port. Therapeutic.
I'll be mad if I can't have a couple of drinks on my fleet carrier's bar.
Mass effect Andromeda 2 ?
Frontier: We want to give players complete freedom of choice! Players: How can you make money? Frontier: Go dig ore! Players: But what about freedom of choice, mining is not fun, and quests are not profitable ?! Frontier: GO DIGGING ORE !!!  ---  Many thanks for cutting the awards "in some cases 10-100 times", for the transportation of goods ...
Elite is so underrated
I don't want to look at the side of a person's head while they are talking to me, it looks stupid.
Sem legenda em PT-BR...
Is VR going to work with this?
Just imagine after this and after they add walkable interiors, if they add the ability to buy a planetary outpost where you can dock your ships. What if ED collaborated with Space Engineers?
Honestly cant wait for this!
Thanks for this greatest game!) I love u devs!)))
This game got SOOOOO much potential,and hell,devs using it,im excited too see final result. Even with my hate toward being all alone surounded by emptyness and npc,this is gotta be awesome anyway
Your audio designer is a GENIUS, like Hans Zimmer kind of genius. Give that man a raise.  Otherwise, you guys have no clue how to design a game that's fun to play. ED is just a high quality, well polished grind for your next ship. I could give you a billion ideas in which to avoid that.
i wont get my hopes up until i see it.
You know i think it's just more than a big step, i think this will transform Elite Dangerous. And even it is not for tomorrow, but i think this extension might be set the first stone for many features wanted by the community since the launch of Elite. See you in the black 07
Chris Gregory must get a lot of comments that he looks like Ricky Gervais
Traveller RPG is my jam. NoMan's Sky is already moving in that direction.
"It's not the game we're telling you how to play-"  Well I mean considering over the past, what, 3 years(?) Passanger, drone kill, and mining activities were nerfed or "balanced," it really seems like you want us to play it a certain way which looks like a long and really annoying grind, especially when farming engineer mats is still mad balls.
Here’s hoping the next step is ability to move about my ship, maybe even embark/disembark. Unlike the other “space sim” out there, this title is fully functional and fun already with a amazing community. Adding spacelegs is making it better.
what does count as early 2021 ? :o :)
I wonder if you can actually move around the ships themselves... It would be a pain in the ass to make but jesus christ it would be super cool. My dream is to walk up to my lovely ship, to step onto the ramp, watching other people departing and arriving, to go to my cockpit and to appreciate the complexity of this masterpiece
Please let me live out my sci-fi bounty hunting fantasies
So basically this is Star Citizen, but without the 25 year wait.
Yo guys, take your time. It's looking stunning, outrageous, really really deep. Amazing. I'm actually anxious for the release but no problem at all with any delay. I want it working and looking good rather than right now in my hands.
Imagine if this becomes a Destiny-like open galaxy game
iam new to the elite dangerous. the basic gameplay is already amazing for and now they add this you can go out on foot... Man i think this is WILL be number 1 iam going to waiting for after cyberpunk 2077... long wait it's kill me but keep up the good work
Why i hear imps screams and Hellknight roars at this moment 1:05? The year 2004 is so long gone.
God please don't have brick wall NPCs
what i want: - exploring inside huge wreck ships, which are infested, abadoned colonies, move freely in my ship, get out ship in space and do some repairs(for example oxygen leak, jammed weapon etc.)
i hear you cant move freely in your ship, is it true?
Крис напрягся. Фронтиры бессовестно пиздят идеи и контент :)
sorry to say this but i think ships interiors should be more priority than a station,more inmersive and etc ,good work btw
You know ED is doing something right when all of the SC cult members raid the comment section in packs. You people have issues and are simply in denial. ED has ALWAYS been amazing, but this new expansion is going to take it to a different level and the wackos over on SC are starting to notice this. ED is doing something in a few years, that SC is still unable to do. That game is a wreck and the only people still holding on to that 'dream' are those, that can not accept reality. How many people have left SC recently? How many are going to leave once this is released? We should be thanking you all for the player base you will be providing! I am sorry for the rant, but I am sick and tired of these fan boys shitting on a finished and expanding game and having the gull to compare ED with a unfinished, buggy, LAGGY, CTD plagued, hardware whore of a game, that SC is. There is no comparison. ED is evolving and is already better and will continue to be better than SC on every level. You people go ahead and wait for your interactive hot dog stands. We will explore space and do what was promised to you 6 or more years ago, lmfao! Not to mention, we do not need to spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars in a game to get what we want. OUR game does not try to take our money at every turn. You would think, that would be a red flag, but not to these wackos. They think it goes to developing the game, lmfao. Can not fix stupid, but we can sure in the hell wave at them, while we are enjoying our game at its fullest on MULTIPLE platforms, with little to NO DISRUPTION in our game play! Rant over.
Not seeing any kids in that footage (or Cat People, but that's my own particular wish-list item). There need to be kids, think of the RPers, we want families, we want interpersonal drama... I want to be the guy sitting at the end of tha bar telling stories of what it was like 'back in the day'... or the gang leader with a soft spot for orphans... or an orphan! Give me something to work with here!
Более упоротого управления чем тут я еще нигде не встречал.
Now I'll get to leave the ship? Get in shoot outs? F yeah!!!
I just started playing i bought squadrons and ED( i got on a whim) because i had money left over and I have not set this game down since! Haven't even played squadrons yet and I've had it for 2 weeks now 😂
Odyssey is gonna be a free update?
Is this going to be a paid update?
is odyssey an update or a whole different game that would need to be purchased i believe that's something most of us don't know
”Fine, I'll do it myself”  - Elite Dangerous speaking to Chris Roberts
Chris Roberts: "Oh it will be awesome, so many features, look! Toilets! Nobody can make such an Game!"  Braben: " Hold my beer...."
This is so amazing! But pleaase give us crossplatform playing. I beg you :)
question is will we be able to land on earth ?
i cannot wait any longer.....
Would be cool if there was a shootout in a star port and you had to escape to your ship before the internal defenses take you out.
ALLOW PLAYERS TO HIRE PEOPLE AND GIVE MISSIONS. PEOPLE CAN HIRE PROTECTION, OR POLICE FORCES, OR MAYBE PIRATES FOR A CAMPAIGN, OR FUND A WAR. MAKE IT SO PEOPLE CAN MAKE MONEY OFF EACH OTHER. THAT WOULD ADVANCE THE GAME DRAMATICALLY.
Can't Play. Downloaded 15 GB then it says: make a Verify on Epic store, upgrade needed. After as upgrade has been done, then it says again... Is it a Crap?  or even EPIC store is a crap in itself?  i don' know but now it is unplayble
YESSSS ALMOSTTT A GAME BEST THAN STAR CITIZEN.. porfin un juego que cumple y hace lo que star citicen no es capaz en 10000000000 años.. los felicito
Ммм... Завтраки. Ельцин тоже обещал.
Will this be a paid dlc or free update dlc
You propose new jobs, a new kind of exploration, enhanced graphics, new types of quests, interactions with characters. New optimisation possibilities with suits but some people just go :  "wHy cAn't wE jUSt sEE inSidE oUr shIP" LMAO what is wrong with these people.
It is so existed!
L O O K S  G R E A T !
Yup they never speak about walking inside your ship. I think it will be just some animation of you getting out and that is it. All the gameplay will be just outside but no new gameplay with interiours or connection with multicrew. Also the atmosphere seems like just a new effect over the old empty wasteland planets. No new biomes, vegetation or even wildlife, probably nothing.
ommmggggggg -I've wanted this since day one! over 8 damn years of checking back every other month to see if it was there and now it's here.... I feel, at peace :)
OMG soon free in epic games  :3
Full VR support pleaaaassseee,  been here since 2014, I funded the whole new frontier building with buying all the shipkits etc. and deserve, as all do,  something better than a flat screen in VR..... Hope they keep working on it so I can come back after already 6 months not playing.......
That's awesome news. Its got me playing again after a number of years.  I really do hope this brings the scope for narrative and more story driven content within ED. Although I really appreciate what they have and imminently intend to do, It has also lacked the aforementioned. I'm not talking about tens of thousands of hours of CGI and impressive cut scenes etc. Even the simple use of text in a novel like narrative. I'm thinking long term missions way out beyond the bubble, along the lines of Star Trek Voyager, lost way out in the Delta Quadrant. That is what would encourage me to move into the unknown as currently, its just unfortunately too repetitive and disengaging to venture forth.
keep going!
Elite dangerous about to be the new Star Wars
I have great hope and little expectations. I really hope this is as cool as it could be!
Shut up and take all the money I have already
so, when i will be walking around my ship ??
Star citizen 2.  Wait, what do you mean? Star citizen isn't out yet?
i want the bartenders to wear bartender clothes instead of space suits tho.
i dont think i'll be ever able to pick up this game unless im strapped to a seat with VR goggles. a joystick on one hand and a throttle on the other..  are there enough buttons on the HOTA A-10 stick and throttle to map all of the functions of a craft??
Good thing elite has VR...    NMS and star citizen:. Screams in confusion
You guys better add mandalorian armor
A bunch of white heterosexual men promise a whole new gaming experience. I love it!
Guys, how u can be better? Impossible. You are the best!
FORGET IT WITHOUT VR .. !!!
endgame trailer
Why is there no VR?
1:29 The Mandalorian S02E01
Odyssey | The Road to Odyssey Part 3???????????????????????????????????????????????????????
I hope the settlements on the edge can be sieged like the camps in far cry. that would be pretty sick. They would have to work on some generation to make it not too repetitive tho... Probably a bit too optimistic
I hope it doesn't turn out to be another X:Rebirth.
The first thing I'm going to try to do when Odyssey comes out is to find a Spaceport with a polished smooth floor. Then I want to run down the hallway and slide across the floor in my socks.
LoL Just found this game. This is Star Citizin but finished xDD
The settlements sound cool and hopefully in the future players will be able to found their own settlements.
This game is incredible ..thanks for all
Thank goodness. IMO Flying and combat in Elite is far more fun then in Star Citizen. It was just missing the on foot experience. I know star citizen has a punch of planned features, but at the pace SC are going its gonna be another 10 years.
I just want to be able to go have a coffee with my mates before going on a moon base raid that is followed by a astroid field battle in the same play session.
"core part of Elite, which is freedom of choice" - If they really want to give us freedom of choice then make player vs. player trading(all materials, commodities) possible too. Make player given missions possible, etc. That would breathe some life into the never-ending procedurally generated grind.  But don't run that fast forward. There is still a lot to do with the current game as well, RIGHT?! :) Too many disappointed players dreamed about freedom of choice. Then we had to learn what balancing really means at FDev. The nerf hammer. Rendering mechanics, weapons, mods to mere unusable gimmicks. So all the Odyssey stuff sounds amazing, but how about first: - fixing the gazillion broken mechanics, - clean up, balance and make less grindy engineering (lacking depth FDev have to extend every acquisition to hundreds of hrs), - balance out weapons, ships (oh yeah, how about a proper counterpart for the op FDL for example?), - make all professions equally profitable and interesting, - etc, etc, etc... and build something on top of that? :)  I'm sure most of the seasoned players know and agree with this. Seasoned means at least a couple of hundreds of hours in the game. ;) I just bought another copy of the game and started it from scratch. I know, how exciting everything at the beginning. So much to learn. But after you get all the ships, also grind too many weeks for engineering them and all the buzz fades away because there is nothing else really there. Player to player interaction is very limited. We need at least the player to player trading as a basis, but giving mission would be the real excitement. Bounties, material acquisitions, delivering engineered modules... Well, one can dream, right? :)
too bad you cant make a living being a pirate when mining make you millions of credits a day
Man the animations look so bad
Just let me walk around my ship. That is all.
Elite Dangerous will be the new choice in Space Games. Bye Star Citizen.
you should expect to have another currency to buy your weapons your jetpacks and the extraction device because the veterans of the games with their billions the games will be too simple
It's kinda sad that after all this development time and effort, it will still be an unprogressive grindfest. Do the same thing you hate for ten thousandth time to buy the thing you want.
Stupid excited to steal from settlements.
Now my thing with Star Citizen is is expensive to fully enjoy, not only do you need a decent p.c. but you've got to either pay a lot or play a lot, or mine. Player can give you credits as well so thats a plus and you can play with up to 50 player im pretty sure per lobby.  Don't get me wrong Star Citizen is super deep. I just feel that the game itself and the way its being built is very. Impractical... Its trying to be a legit simulator which takes a long while...     No Mans Sky is cool but super grindy and I get tired of grinding.   What Elite Dangerous seems like a more accessible version of Star Citizen I dont know if it will have multiplayer.  It probably will and I feel like it could honestly be really fun as like a 3rd person shooter game with space stuff involved with your friends.   The thing that I and a lot of people want is a game that lets you build and make entire military bases and cities and let's you wage war in an FPS game playing with millions of other player at the same time.  I feel that a goal. How cool would that be, ideally the game would be like Battlfield but have a high level of customization and whatnot.
Just please introduce a lot of pistols not only rifles
we can walk into our ships?
we arent an holo?
Yeah you can take first step if pay 40€ for expansion :D
I have a lot more hope for this than Star Citizen, always have. This looks amazing! :D
auto pilot during supercruise and flight would be sick, so you could explore your ship and talk to your crew.
it's so cool!!!!
As much as i would like this, as a veteran and knowing FD this is not going to add much. Its going to be te same boring repeated gameloops you do as with an SRV.
Next you need to give us access to M class planets
Space Legs are coming!
I like the idea "We are not telling you how to play." I just get tired of immense RPGs nowadays that require too many procedures to undertake (they do have unique values, it's just not my thing). Open space games like elite, Minecraft, space engineers and even Mount and blade have long been more attractive to me, perhaps due to their similar concepts.
My ZX-Spectrum dreams comes true..... thank you guys, God bless you and our $ 🧐
This is simply jawdropping! Take my money!
Well space legs now great.....It's not going to take away the fact the primary game has the depth and the excitement of a space trucking simulator.  But who cares!  Now I can walk around a spaceport or barren empty planet using some janky FPS mechanics so all is well!
Where's the Eve-like player market?
Dear Frontier,  Please give us part III already.  Cordially
TXAA NOWWWWWWWWW!
So what mass effect andromeda wanted to do?
Shut up and take my money ! I want it now ^^
Star Citizen is getting sweaty palms!  Please I pray we start out with nothing (if we choose) working on the ground till we earn enough money till we get off the ground!!!!!!
These devs doesn't understand what players want. They just adding mechanics to the game, which are soulless. This game is just not fun.
I mean, no man sky and star citizen already done it, but this game is way better in terms of quality of handling.  So what do we see ahead here is a possibility that in the future there will be a bigger feedback from the players.  If the game gets bigger budget, it might became best space sim ever
ED for me is the ultimate VR game. I mean, I specifically bought an Oculus Rift a few years back because of ED, and I did it deliberately not caring if there were any other VR games worth a damn - and I never regretted it. Now what I am a little worried about though is what the effects of Odyssey will be on that.  More specifically: What about motion sickness? For example, I can't drive around the surface of planets in VR. It makes me sick as a dog in minutes - and I doubt I'm the only one having the issue. "Luckily" I also find the driving around on planets gameplay pretty boring, so it has been easy to ignore. But the on foot element sounds really appealing, would be hard to pass up. I wonder how Frontiers is planning to address this. I don't see them adding a teleporting system (who knows, but it would be kinda weird) but maybe being able to switch to 3rd person view might be a start? Least elegant but potentially life-saving option might be a "button" that allows to instantly move back and forth from VR to a regular fullscreen monitor experience? I mean, instead of just taking off the VR goggles and continue playing in some crappy minimized window. Also maybe the option to shut off any type of head-bobbing, even if it's not super-realistic it certainly beats the whole thing turning into a puke-fest.  I can't say I have a solution, but I really do think that it's in Frontiers own best interest to pay extra attention to this issue, as ED really is the killer-app for many, many VR players.
IS THIS UPDATE FOR XBOX TOO!? OMFG THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR GUYS!!!! *hyperventilation*
"people who you can relate to" Please don't give them any political views  Please      Please don't
Meh, all this and more is already in NMS.
This game is so badass, even though I don't get on as much as I want these days
will the interiors replace the menu cause thats awesome imagine actually talking to someone who gives you a job instead of just reading it so excited!!!
ill go buy ship kits for my viper right now to help fund this youre welcome
Hope they're able to expand Odyssey a lot post-launch with walking in ships and just more overall content to do on-foot.
So for us who play Elite in VR how will the transition from ship to ground work with VR? Elite was built from the ground up for VR but I've not heard anything about Odyssey and VR?
These devs are so soy!
Пока star citizen мнется на месте, вы делаете настоящий контент! Спасибо за старания, ждем обновление!
Star Citizen players be like "Hey, I've seen this before"  ED players: "What do you mean? It's new!"
PLEASE ADD SHIP INTERIORS!! YOUR SHIP IS YOUR HOME!!
One simple question, if the fking gankers fk my ship on a planet surface and I am on foot, how can I kill my self for leave the planet ????? as SRV i can do that, on foot how ???? will need call someone out of the game for kill my avatar ??? XD
So faster I will be able to explore a station than explore my ship that I use for years ?? sounds good lol
Can't Wait!
118 people are stuck with broken inventories and no copy of Elite Dangerous.
This is like if war thunder also had an FPS on ground mode
I’m telling my kids this is Star Citizen
God save the Queen... take a lesson Cloud Imperium!
How mutch GIG will it have?
welcome to the real star citizen.  in silence with precision and without fanfare this game is becoming total, and now we see the real frontier plans. I have been a backer stat citizen since 2014, and I certainly think ELITE will be much more star citizen than it will be in the next 2 years. Today they reiterated that sq42 (which was supposed to come out this year as I said months ago) will come out no earlier than the end of 2022. 2022 absurd. Unfortunately, they don't understand that when they come out everyone will be playing elite. welcome star citizen RIP star citizen.
I just want you guys to make co-op a viable play style. That's all I want from this game. I want to be able to play in a wing and divide ALL profit evenly, or decide how much of a cut each commander gets. I want to be able to have mining ships, haulers, and fighter ships work together in a wing and actually benefit from it without having to jump through hoops to give someone what they earned for their time. The current profit sharing mechanics actively discourage playing together with others and it's the main reason why me and all of squad mates all stopped playing. It's easier to make credits on your own than working together, and that's a huge disappointment. I really want to be able to pool resources and work together to make credits. Buying a Fleet Carrier as a squadron makes WAY more sense than an individual commander being responsible for it entirely, for example. Please let us just give each other credits when we want, or at least have some way of one pilot being able to pay another for their services rather than just an NPCs. It's not going to break the economy if my noob friends get some financial help along the way, or if a rich bounty hunter decides to employ other commanders and buy them a ship (or maybe even rent it to them). Think about how player made large scale mining operations or security force squadrons for hire could massively improve the entire game. If you're too worried about players getting carried or real world money trading to let us just give someone else credits, let us be able to choose how to divide ALL credits earned while in a wing. Please please please make it happen Frontier! I want to play this game again but doing it alone is no longer compelling no matter what features you add.
omg ive been waiting for this !!
Great! Another $60 DLC to do what literally every other space game ever has for free.
Please just end the grind. I am cool with the suits having upgrades, but I dont want sit on a planet for 6 hours farming materials to get those upgrades.
I still remember playing Earth and Beyond, and hearing the Tado-O commercials while walking around in the stations. Background noise that just adds to the atmosphere.
I only wish my anaconda can land anywhere I want....
add in cooperative stuff + producing buildings
So Elite got from Starships down to smaller Space Cars and now goes down to the people controling it, what will be the next expansion? Being the gun? If so, count me in!
This is lookign great. What I'd love in game is the ability to board and capture ships. They could then be sold at a black market shipyard. It wouldn't be easy, there would be NPCs to fight and turrets etc. to be disabled along with the need to hack the ship systems to be able to fly it. You could go out roaming in a small ship and potentially capture something big to sell on.
les mecs ont zero imagination. C'est 140% copié SC quoi c'est abusé
I like this game  so much !
Yeah this is cute and all but unless you get that Bartender A.I. behavior working properly I just don't see how any of this can be possible.  So maybe next time you update us you can stop hiding the Bartender and show us what you really have.  Stop hiding!  👍👌So Sad!!!👌👍
You know I REALLY like this concept of walking around on foot but can I just make one request? Can I get a tank SRV? XD  Real talk I do love the fact we are getting what we are getting in Odyssey but we only have a single SRV in Elite Dangerous I would love to see other ones added in that are more specialized for particular activities like the mentioned "tank" with higher armor and shields with better armaments, a large transport that has increased cargo capacity, or even giving us the ability to outfit SRVs like ships surely these ideas are not outside the realm of possibility?
Who is Star Citizen??? Elite Dangerous is going to make them obsolete lol.
Check and mate... Chris Roberts!
Too bad we can't explore the inside of our own ships on launch day :/
Please don't postpone the release date. I am beyond excited for this.
Even if I water this down to reasonable expectations (you know what I mean), it's still something I'm looking forward to.
Watching this video while cruising in-system for 1 hour, waiting to get to the station
It even looks better than Star Citizen
Shut up and take my money!
is it coming in january 2021?
oh..my..goodness
Neat.
FIX YOUR ECONOMY!!!!!!!!!!!! AND GIVE US SHIP INTERIORS AT LAUNCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Your comments about player agency are also hilarious. If you cared so much you wouldn't have nerfed mining into the ground, or other activities in the game would actually be profitable like Combat and Exploration.....
Thankyou Devs, when others are selling vaporware, you are programming the future.
Elite Dangerous is currently on sale on Steam!!!!
I don't mean to be disrespectful here, but all of this and you can't walk inside your ships? The thing that people ACTUALLY wanted from space legs?  Come on now...
Im kinda new to Elite Dangerous but it is by far the best space game i have played and im glad that something beautiful like this exist . thanks to the dev for the AMAZING job and sorry for my poor English i am from italy so it is not my first language.
As much as I am excited for this, are there any plans for pvp incentive? territory control? fleet battles? maybe have mining actually contribute to crafting instead of just selling
This is a weird thought, but wouldn't it be nice to wander around your own ship in first person? I kind of want to explore my interior design. I know it would be almost impossible to implement, but I'd like it nonetheless.
A lot of great ideas, but the problem is they still haven't polished the ideas the game already tried to implement with ship play.  And so many things they are saying are basically trying to get you away from using a ship.  The strength of Elite was being the best ship sim out there.  All this focus on foot missions makes it seem like they're trying to make it like every other space game on the market.  Or to scoop Star Citizen.  That is a dangerous strategy because if Star Citizen ever comes out in a decent form, people will just give up on Elite and go play that.  But if Elite Dangerous still has more freedom and options in ship based gameplay than Star Citizen does, it could survive.  If they put all their time into developing better exploration, mining, coop and PvP options before Star Citizen comes out, it could remain the pinnacle starship sim, while Star Citizen takes over the planet exploration and FPS sim.  But hey, the devs aren't going to listen to some random guy on youtube.
So can you have sex with a space hooker?
is it still VR. ?
Talks about freedom of choice......then makes a community goal where they KNOW players will only take the choice where they get a reward, essentially forcing the lore/story to go where they want it to.  I foresee this to be more of the same.
As a casual ED player, though I've had a lot of hours invested in, I'm really excited!
Я играл в стратегию SPACE HEVAN Вот там настоящий геймплей !!! Построил я значит свой корабль раставил обогреватели подсоеденил проводку  температура в отсеках синхронизировалось . На станках производил  пластик и метал ,а копоть собирала специальная машина которая из угарного газа и углерода в воздухе добывала углерод.Потом когда я обустроил корабль я вылетел в соседнюю систему ,а там  меня растрелял вражеский корабль.Это были пираты.Затем пираты сели в маленький челнок и в скафандрах высадились на мой корабль что бы ограбить меня и вывезти мое барахло к себе на корабль!!! НО и это еще не все я их опередил и улетел к ним на корабль десантировался к ним через стыковочный шлюз убил тех кто там был  часть захватил в плен.Когда остальная команда пиратов вернулась я растрелял и их !!! Они пираты хотели мне заплатить выкуп что бы я их отпустил ,но мой корабль был раздолбан  и я засел на их корабле.Я взял и отрегенерировал здоровье в их госпитале переодически меняя охрану и пациента  чтоб пираты не сбежали.Вот это я понимаю геймплей у меня челюсть висела как в такой маленькой игре столько всего придумали.А еще там можно было распилить и растащить любой корабль на металолом и полезные материалы например запчасти компьютеров еда и прочее.
"Not the game we are telling you how to play" Oh yeah? Then why do missions pay so piss poorly, and are even worse for wings?
Amazing. Cannot wait.
this game is going to nail star citizen into the dirt honestly
I'm gonna bum a ganker outside a bar
What about personal ships, can we walk about them?
SCAVENGING THROUGH WRECKS YESSSS
chris, watch and learn dude
I will beleive it when it actually releases . (Four YEARS FROM NOW)
Seriously Elite dangerous is just slowly becoming no man's sky with realism
So I see Elite dangerous it's just aggressively trying to and Sean Murray's and no man's Sky career  Chill out Elite, save some space for the rest of the space games
So much hypeeee
RIP Star citizen!!..lmaooo
OMG YES!!!
My biggest thing is that I want to walk around my ship. That’s huge for me. If it isn’t a part of odyssey, I probably won’t be coming back. I have well over 1,000 hours in btw
So in theory... I could (possibly) fly my python through the atmosphere of a planet from space, land, push a button on my keyboard, exit my pilots chair, walk through my pythons interior, take a zip from my coffee machine, grab my custom assault rifle from a shelf, put my cigarette out, put on my helmet, open the hatch, get out from my ship, walk/run BF or COD style into a cave, settlement, base or whatever, find my target, terminate him by experiencing solid FPS mechanics, duck,  jump, sprint and zoom/scope down my rifle - that sort of thing? Getting credits transferred to my account for collecting my bounty or participating in a skirmish as a hired gun? Then casually walking back to my ship, blast off into space and shoot the brstrds friends to pieces in space? And then be at home in time for tea and biscuits? My scenario sounds too good to be true... Wouldn't be anything exciting and cool as that now would it? But what if someone out there could do a game like that? SC is probably trying in some way I guess but I cant wait 500 million years until it passes alpha, and no mans sky looks interesting but its too cartoony for me and I don't think their FPS gun play seems that solid.  I think what Frontier means is that you can press a button on your keyboard, exit your ship.. walk,.. because that's probably all you can do,.. quite slowly... bring out some kind of mining tool... find a rock,..mine,... put the minerals in your bag... run out of bag space,... walk back to your ship.... empty bag,.... walk back to the rocks.... mine the rock.... admire the empty vastness of space and procedurally generated barren landscapes, filled with exciting minerals waiting to be plucked, then fly to another planet where spacelegs are supported and walk trough a lifeless station which looks as if its brand new with no sign of being lived in. Like fresh out from the factory or in this case 3DSMAX or Maya or whatever. Spotless, Not a scratch. But at least it would have excellent sound, which I really do expect from Frontier at this point. We can hope for something decent or even special, at least Frontiers NPCs seem to resist the temptation of standing on tables and chairs. At least that's a start which puts them ahead of the competition in some regards.
How will this work with flight sticks
I thought space legs was an unattainable dream. They're really following through with it.
now you get to be bored on foot
I hope they let on foot activities be worthwhile credit wise and not purely redundant otherwise it will be abandoned as soon as the novelty wears off.  I really want this to be a new aspect of gameplay I’ll want to use all the time.
Frontier has a bad habit of just missing the Mark on giving things purpose and narratives, so even though this looks really exciting I’m trying not to get my hopes up too much.
Oooh use focused suits is a cool idea!
“We’re going to allow players to set foot on planets and spaceports” Wait, does that mean we won’t be able to explore our own ships?  Don’t get me wrong, to me spaceports are the most interesting, but next would be ships over barren planets.
Space legs look amazing, BUT two things I really hope they don’t forget this time around.  1. We NEED a reason to go places.  It’s exciting to just explore and be the first to find some unique feature, but at the same time, so much work by frontier is seen by so few people because unless you’re really deep into the community, there’s no story/missions that nudge you towards interesting places that casual players will see.   2. They’ve shown us in this sort of content and with cosmetics time and again that clearly getting a 3rd person view looks good and is desirable, yet it’s so limited.  Yes elite strives for realism, but there’s always a balance with the fact it’s a game. I’m REALLY hoping we can finally get 3rd person views with at least basic fighting/flying abilities so you can see what you’re targeting, basic dash data, etc even if the menu stuff is left out.
Please, make it third person! Please!
Star Citizen, he's screwed .... :)
Just take a look.  Elite Dangerous has already disappointed me.  But I'll have a look at this when the time comes.
Hm. Glad to hear we can book flights between systems, that actually makes me a bit more excited than a lot of other things in the video. A bunch of it was pretty well the expected PR spin you always hear, but there were some small nuggets of new info in there. Quest boards are expected, it's likely just like what we get for contracts on ships, but you walk up to the boards themselves. The character added to settlements will be a nice touch, though. Looking forward to that.
Everything before this has been a let down. This will be too. Just more over hyped bs.
ODYSSEY has achieved what START CITIZEN could not after raking in 31+ Million from public.
+rep
But when the same thing was planned to be done in eve online in the incarna module. The game promised players who are not associated with space flight at all and can migrate between major stations. What could be the atmosphere in eve, if they realized the incarnation as promised, but not fate. The fate of eve is a grind and battle in the bubbles and no dip... I am very glad that the elite did not follow this path!
Yes but what does the bathroom in my Anaconda look like!?
What music track is playing in the background on these videos?
Woohooo!!!  This will be awesome!! Thanks FDev I will be playing this game for years hopefully!   I’ve always loved space sims since wing commander I’m hoping between this and star citizen I can finally have a space mmo that’s worth playing.   Just let us walk in our ships too please :)
Meaningful and engaging gameplay, not shitty minimum-effort missions... but that's how it's gonna be, isn't it? Plus another grindfest for suit upgrades?
Playing SC at the moment, yet Elite Dangerous Odyssey looks sumptuously immersive.
Star Citizen R.I.P
On behalf of everyone Matthew Florianz, thank you. EDs sounds are bar none.
So what will this 3rd person aspect do different to no man sky I wonder 🤔
Great now to buy the odyssey you will need to pay extra with a kidney
I'm starting from scratch. When this launches.  RIP all the hardcore explorers that  proclaimed they are never coming back and are years into deep space. Any of you here?
Wow! This looks great. I play NMS but I will definitely be checking out Odyssey.
I think that this should be a side expansion that is played separately from the main game . I played the original way back in 1984 and also the other iterations and I think that to go away from the original Space Trading / Combat concept and turn the game into a glorified FPS shooter is a bad idea . If this expansion spoils the Space Trading / Combat side of the game then I'm afraid I'll have to stop playing .
Will there be third person??
I wonder how this is gonna work in VR
How about putting minor alien races allover the galaxy to find and explore   , and for example  for multicrew  player to do something else then drive fighter or shut from low dmg turrets .
so when this game will released
I'll believe all the great things when I actually play them. I know it _sounds_ "really really exciting", but ... we'll see FDEV =)
I have to say, Elite Dangerous seems to be exceeding my expectations of them repeatedly.  Not only is it one of the most immersive space games, it sure looks like it's going to exceed them in other categories too.  I'm sure it won't be perfect immediately, but Frontier seem to have some in common with other great companies like Egosoft.  Nothing is ever perfect, but not all devs follow up on their games for years and years after release.  We have 2 space game devs who do - lucky break.  I hope this ends up being as good as it sounds / looks.
We still want ship interiors...
gonna quit studying at the university to play this game  :3
Finally the game gets interesting for me.  I always thought the pilot is paraplegic... Looks like we dont need wheelchairs anymore \o/
The important question aside from being able to walk on ship interiors is can we get drunk at the bar?
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't scramble my game data during the transfer over to Odyssey! 🙏  I will be very disappointed if you take away my ships, engineering, faction status, visited locations data or my credit balance, not to mention all the rare commodities I been collecting for my trading runs.  It would hurt me greatly to have to start from scratch, after all these years of grinding for everything I have. I might have to put Elite down permanently after a loss like that, I just couldn't justify all the lost time behind an incident like that.   Although I'm sure the only people who'd miss me are the members of my squadron, as it seems Frontier Dev always errors in favor of the game than the players who are in it as a hobby.  I'm waiting for Odyssey to get here, but I have severe apprehensions about how the change will affect my accumulated data.   To be honest...so far Frontier have been extremely careful with this, from my point of view, maybe I'm just worrying without any warrant here, although you can't say it's a worry totally without merit....hasn't Frontier ever nerfed stuff in ship engineering?  That's data we grinded for and where disappointed by it being changed without being asked if it was ok with us.   I can't imagine any of the things I've mentioned here being changed without a very good reason, but it's a worry nonetheless.  What do you think about getting your data corrupted during the transfer to Odyssey game play?
Looks very inspiring. Thank you, dev team!
I'm scared, hope this won't take a year or up to 3 to be fully fledged out.
I want them to add also Custom Hud and colors . I want also video calls like star trek. Also free roaming inside ship whever we want no just at ports. and custom interiors at ships.
My first thought was : Shepard alive!!  are they doing elite combined with Mass Effect. ??? I MEGA  LOVE IT ! I am Commander Shepard! and this is my favorite game now in the galaxy!! take my credits!!
After ED Odyssey is released, let frontier help CIG developing SC.
That's what I used to imagine while playing Elite on my Amiga in the days of yore. And now it's going to happen!!
Please, please, please: Tell us what the interaction between the vehicles and the people will be. Will there be ground battles supported by a Vulture acting as a bomber? Will there be type-7s ferrying troops to and from the battlefield? Will there be escort missions in space to land troop transports (respawns? Tickets?) To ongoing ground warfare?  There's a million ways that fps and vehicles can interact. Please tell us what Elite can give us.
That's sad... If they pull this off,ED will out SC SC. I just might resurrect my old account and check it out once it's out.
Can I hop out of supercruise without the game disconnecting
is this a free update or will you have to pay for it i bought Horizons a long time ago an i like this game but i really dont wanna sink any mor emoney into it Star Citizen i made a mistake lets just say
Sounds amazing.  Looking forward to it!
Finally, Elite is maturing.  I thought that the project is slowly dying out because they don't get everything possible for money.  However, you can feel a certain passion here, not a money machine.  Fingers crossed.  Take my money;)
All that sounds soooo Amazing. But i really want to know if i can see the inside of my ship. I want to walk around inside and even decorate if possible. Make my ship my own
I'm gonna run so many people over in my SRV! Still I worry the games gonna still be boring. NMS some how manges to NOT be boring and Empyrion Galactic Survival is also quite entertaining. Elite is one of those games where its a pain in teh arse to do anything. Hell despite the grind of NMS its actually never feels like a grind. Its knda magic. Same with Emps. I would rather hoep wit this update they manage to Elite feel less like a chore to play and more fun. HELL i have more fun in teh SPACE COMBAT in NMS than I ever did in Elite and Elite space combat is so detailed and so full of depth but manages to feel boring as hell to play. While NMS combat is a bit shallow and not detailed and teh flight model is atrosious YET somehow it manages to be more FUN haha.
1:53 They didn't mo-cap the beard! Unsubscribed!!!
OMG........I can hardly wait........I live and breath this game......I'm one of those people who love the grind of the game.......I sleep and dream of spaceships.......Then wake up and play again.......I absolutely LOVE cargo missions and doing battles in NON - engineered ships......I just know that someday.......someday........I'm gonna get a fleet carrier and jump 500 light years away, towards Sagittarius......That will be the day!........But I wonder how do the devs get paid.......since it's kind of like a free-to-play simulation?
WOW! please fully crossplay und cross-gen 🥰😍
They talk about these things like they are so groundbreaking.
Goodbye cash money
Another grind style gameplay? Sure.
too bad i still dont know how to land without blowing up or flying
Please add the spacex starship to the game🙏
VR Support?
So where can I buy ship jpegs that can't be used in the game???  Looking amazabaws btw. Good job. Keep up the schedule though. Would be slightly sad if it's not released in 2021. Need something to recoup from 2020...
Space legs...i...i...IM COOOMINGGGG
Amazing
Frontier has made up for all the bullshit they've made us go through. I can't wait. It'll be like Star Citizen, except actually good.
Hello there, will Elite Dangerous be compatible on ps5 having the game on ps4?
I'm interested in how well it will run and whether I'll have to upgrade my system. I think I'll have to.
Plz, balance primes for fighting quests and increase income a bit from mining
This is going to be so bad with the peer-2-peer connection.
Please add Polish language in the game
if i buy the deluxe edition, i will have access to that ?
Hold E to flip scarab
if i dont get ship interiors im not buying this. its that simple, i have put alot of work into my ship to just brush it aside as a *pop in and out* .... and no ship interiors together with the LTD Nerf (which pushed me away from the game initially) is the finale nail in the coffin. My advice to FDev would be to listen to your player base and understand that no plan stands the test of time you need to be more flexible towards what the game was planned to be and what the players ask you to fix. all the best FDev.
Shocking that Elite Dangerous is doing this sooner than EvE Online & is more stable than Star Citizen while still looking exactly like it.  Yikes.  Surprised to see ED on top for once.
It looks promising but what won't change is the way Frontier operates such as playing favourites for those who play the game in the 'right way'.  I find this continuing spiel about freedom of play disingenuous at best.  The game play is surrounded by invisible walls, floors, and ceilings and its far from the game it could be if Frontier weren't such control freaks.
Как тебе такое Крис ?))) Боже это просто шикарно, великолепно, обожаю вас, из России с любовью.
0:54 Does this guy look like a mix of Simon Pegg and Pedro Pascal or am I dreaming? He even sounds a bit like Pascal!
работают под копирку Star Citizen
tbh im so dissapointed that we wont be able to walk inside the ship. Was the biggest turn off for me when i played the game. VR helps alot with that but still :( sad face
I hope you can walk inside the ship
Please VR support please <33
Looks really nice! I‘m already hyped.
If no ship interiors, not interested.
Will there be fully modeled ship interiors now?
yesss daddy braben
i play my pilot mostly as a space taxi service with occasional scavenging on the side, the income reward value of space taxi services has maintains the life-support of my joy in the game, if they force me to make ends meet with a tedious missions having a higher difficulty dynamic, my joy for the game would die and have no desire to play anymore, i love the ideal of space legs, what i am concerned about is how much currency one is rewarded for things they did and still do in space [ hourly earnings of missions + cost of ships and upgrades ] make the hour long and the rewards low and you have a dead game, make the hours vary short and the reward high and it feels unbalanced even to noobs, i love space taxi because its not too hard nor too easy, nearly hits that just right zone, i would not mind a sector of the station to be reserved to npcs waiting for a taxi service and able to by your service by interacting with them, again keep it as an optional  choice so you can still gather customers without needing to leave your ship if thats more your style or just what mood your in or just because you don't have time to waste trying to id the best customer for your service. that's my thoughts currently on this matter, thanks for reading. :)
As long as there isn't any fake 🚪 doors, I'll be happy.
Hyped, Super Hyped.
I can't fucking wait. But I have to :( For me it's the final piece to the "Space life" puzzle. Travel to a new station, dock, sit in the cab for a bit sorting out what I want to do while listening to the radio, pop down to the bar and check out which missions are available, maybe watch some ships dock whilst stood on the balcony, wander around the station... Ugh I need it! EDIT: Just realised there was absolutely no gameplay footage. I'm a bit gutted but still looking forward to it :)
So...this look like Star Citizen but in complete game -)
I love you😘This is my Instagram👸🏻: miss1duabi
I would have been happy with some basic surface gameplay - this is fantastic, and can't wait to feel a bunch more life in the world :D thanks FDev, this is why I play Elite, because you continue developing and supporting your game long after most developers would move on. Looking forward to seeing how far this deep space scifi game saga will go :D
italiano niente?allora soldi niente!!!
Where are the mess hall animations?
I like that Chris Gregory is wearing a Blue Sun T-Shirt :-D Please tell me we will be able to watch the Fruity Oaty Bar commercial on a big screen in some shady bar somewhere...
Why they keep creating demo plays instead of putting some story for single player or coop plays ?
Sorry FDEV, I don't trust you. I already know it will look eyecandy with super audio. But that's where the story will end. You are notorious "overpromise underdeliver" company, with so many wasted resources that were never really fleshed out or were scrapped altogether.
But how many variations of space stations, outposts, etc will we see? I don't want this to be like NMS where you see the same one over and over and over again (Yes I know Space Stations are already like this in Elite....repetitive)
This something I always wanted in this game while I start playing this game, wish you luck and with full heart appreciation for your hard work, thank you!!!
I wanna get hyped so fucking bad
I`m in but it looks like a rip off from Mass Effect Andromeda.
Looks amazing, cant wait. you are doing this the right way, instead of Star citizen.
Forget Star Citizen, this looks waaaaaay more complete!
ELITE citizen
Does E:D have a tutorial yet?  That's what put me off last time...the game just kicked me out and sent me to some youtube videos last time I tried to play, haha.
great but can we walk inside the ship ?
As my hype level for Star Citizen has bottomed this video has my interest in Elite going up!
This looks amazing. You guys are awesome!
i think it's cool they added Port Ollisar's interior to this game. nice friendly nod.
Reckon HUD colouring changing INGAME will happen with this update...please? :D
I can honestly say that this is the first time I'm truly impressed in a very long time. It looks amazing. I'm now worried a bit about how much delayed it will be...
At last people walking around my ship in hangar, amazing work FD, please create outposts manually for specific rare item, used weapon and armour, lost person so we can have gameplay for 2 years.And Panther Clipper only dockable on planet surface. Atmosphere and enviroment are amazing, exceptional work and lighting. Put some dogs in poor outposts to chase us.
if the game also is going to have that you can walk around in your ship then i will be jerking off for a week at release of odyssey
*increasing hype*
Hat's off F'dev! Great Work
What about the Vr support?
2:10 sound design was already phenomenal in Elite, really looking forward for Odyssey.
All good. As long as it is not a loading screen when we are stepping in and out a base or ship like it is now with the ship to scarab. Talk about an immersion slayer.
After an uncertain start, I'm soooooo looking forward to this now.
Star Citizen, where are you now (Hint: Wasn't a real question, that's why no question mark so.)
gimme
Thank you Fdev for doing this! Can't wait!
Looking forward to get Odyssey Elite,  After Jurassic park they returned to Elite finally.
This is gonna be DOPE on the Series S/X
I hooe they add ship walking and EVA. That would be so great.
looks amazing!
No ship interiors? Boycott
Oh ,I thought this was Star Citizen.  My bad :)
Frontier showing yet again how it's done....One side we have Frontier and on the other side you have CIG...one is a professional team and the other a bunch of lying amateurs.... I let you decide which is which
Cool now i can see the stupid nps in the stations in bodyform ... for real guys FIX engineering and balance it
but how will VR be?
Sounds and looks totally awesome! That's the one thing I love about Elite Dangerous it's the little touches that make the game that a lot of game designers seem to be forgetting. Different voice actors are essential in such a vast game and even though I hear the same voices it is so varied that it is not noticeable. Where as say in a game like Mafia 2 and every person in the a gun shop looks the same and sounds the same. Really take you out of immersion. Looks like odyssey is down on my Christmas list! (ok next year then, lol)
I hope the social hub area will be accessible when a station is burning too and on fire ofcourse with emergency personel working on the injured, and also look different when station is repairing and all that.
That is the last chance I give frontier of realizing the potential of Elite. I will probably pay full price at launch for the update (if I'm not occupied playing other things), I will not even be pissed if there isn't much content at launch as was with the base game and Horizon. But please, for God's sakes have a good and solid development road map, don't do Horizon all over again, learn from No Man's Sky. Little updates throughout the year (new ships, vehicles, etc more tools to play at the sandbox) and a big update once a year or two years (new environment to explore, new dimension of gameplay or professions, overhaul of gameplay mechanics that are up to the original vision, etc). You have a great foundation, we understand that you don't have the money of a big publisher or a fanatical fanbase as Cloud Imperium Games. Just keep at baby steps, always adding to the game, in time even at baby steps you will have traveled a great distance. No Man's Sky and Warframe show that games can be great from humble or even disastrous beginnings. Just don't pull a Horizon again, it's is laughable that we have only one suffarce vehicle, while indie games like No Man's Sky have more. And you had plans to add more, the concept art looked awesome. You just didn't follow through with your plans.
I am trying so hard to keep my expectations in check.
Sounds like fun :)
star citizen is gonna be way better imo, and it's gonna be complete before odessey obviously, since it's already out there for the public
Never thought I would ask for this, but can we get more screens around stations interiors with advertisements? And maybe if the system is in a state of war, maybe propaganda posters and more military personnel. Also, in lockdown states, it would be cool to see fewer NPCs, and outbreak systems should have people wearing masks and hazmat suits. This will all add so much value to the world building of Elite Dangerous.
Chris Roberts: I bet you'll have lots of bugs on your launch day. FDev: we already have bugs in the game. they are called Thargoids.
You are making the best game ever
Превосходно!
I wonder if NPC's will give you a greeting if you're a high ranking player with that faction: earl, count, prince etc.
poor Star Citizen....all the jokes....almost feel sorry for that project........nah not really.
Now for us to be able to open our own settlements
soooo... what about walking around my ship?!?
one word: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HYPED!!! three words: GIVE ME NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Yeah, but it´s dissapointing you don´t bring it with VR :(
The art direction feels heavy inspired by star citizen. Would have preferred a different look
ah, so this was that "walking in stations" CCP promised
great, it will be possible build up own base ?
Star Citizen нервно курит в сторонке
this is going to be YUUUUUGE!!
except you limit that freedom with ability to make decent money doing only certain things. It's more like freedom but here's your only progressions.
How many delays are to be expected?
Suit modules/upgrades would be awesome!
I was disappointed when I couldn't get out of my ship and explore,on planets and in space stations
euh at least post a message saying sorry for the leak hihihi watched this same video like a day before the upload
Oh wow perfect timing, I'm actually thinking of getting the game this week, can't wait to explore the universe. I hope there'd be more in game world changing things in the future hidden deep in space that can only be found by exploring
I wonder how Bounty Hunting will work on foot in the game.
It's about time! You guys are so dam slow in making this game the way it should have been a long time AGO!   S.C. is taking a lot of your players away! I should know, because I am playing both games and I am hearing other players talking!   I still like and play E.D. but it get boring doing the same. You guys needs to up the game play!
1:32 kid, "We don't like your kind here."
Please, let us use our Holo-Me in space Stations
So if this is all about choice how about giving us the choice to play Odyssey in VR?
Just full VR support and it will be the best game on the market...at least to me it will
As a VR player ill probably give this a miss until its fully implimented.
Is this Starfield?
) On October 4, 2019, the Dutch national newspaper Trouw published a report with the headline “Tribunal names China a criminal country.”   The opening paragraph read:  “The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has seized power for seventy years. Let us review it together.”  The subsequent text described the CCP’s harvesting of organs from living Falun Gong practitioners and the final judgment of the independent China Tribunal in London earlier this year.   Dutch national newspaper Trouw carries a report entitled “Tribunal names China a criminal country” on October 4.  The article stated that the China Tribunal's investigations were based on solid evidence and firsthand testimony.  “In order to get live organs and kill people, CCP doctors select organs when the victims are still alive,” the author wrote.  “As early as 2006, there have been reports that the Falun Gong practice group is the main target. The CCP’s live organ harvesting crimes from Falun Gong practitioners was confirmed by the Tribunal. In addition, the China Tribunal also suspects that an ever-increasing body of evidence indicates that the killing for organs also occurs on Uighurs.”  The report continued, “The actual number of organ transplants is much higher than the figures given by the CCP itself. Volunteer donors in China are far from enough, but they have advanced organ transplant facilities and started without a voluntary donation system.  “Foreign patients can get organs on a prearranged and accurate date, which the China Tribunal considers to be very suspicious. Organs in other countries are available at an uncertain time.  “Countries such as Israel, Belgium, Spain, Italy and Taiwan prohibit their citizens from going to China for organ transplants. In Belgium, violations of this law can result in up to 20 years in prison. The China Tribunal repeatedly called China a criminal state at the UN human rights conference,” the article stated.
Will it work in VR? If not, I'm not interested.
RIP Star Citizen
Yay Lifetime Pass is gonna get back me in (hopefully my rig can run it lol)
Can't wait to run over scores of pedestrians in my SRV, and gain a wanted level large enough to warrant having suicidal AI ships trying to ram into me.   Grand Theft Auto - The Next Generation.
I look forward to hearing how the transition of power will work when one faction invades another faction's system. Space battles, land battles, battles on stations... Perhaps during a station battle, you gradually see different parts of the station taken over by one faction or the other.
I am really kicking myself for not buying when this was on sale in June...it was like $12. 😣🤦‍♂️ I am pleading for as good of a sale in bundle form when Odyssey is released. 🙏🙏 I am a meager man, and with PS5, my wallet will be hurtin'.
i want this like now now
Stunning
Do you have legs in this game or is it still a flying cockpit simulator?
Well, RIP Star Citizen
So, you can walk around on planets, and space ports, but not your own ship ? Could comb-over man just tell us that this will be available in the next 10 years ?
SC backers: Hey, that's illegal!
its pre alpha so that means it will release in 20 years, thats normal right?
Elite  is the best !
m a k e  s h i p  i n t e r i o r s  a  t h i n g
I spy a Blue Sun t-shirt.
Im going to be honest, I think you should have focused on the space gameplay more.  Its beautiful and immense but ultimately hollow experience what you did with mining(and to an extent exploration) is what I wanted to see done with all career paths and to see proper salvaging implemented along side other types of activities to do. When you guys overhauled the mining my mind was blown then you just stopped.  What goes through my mind is great so i will have to use my hotas and a mouse and keyboard just to play now and it will be just as shallow a pool as it was before just with walking involved. Dont get me wrong I dont think what your doing is wrong, i think the timing is off is all I am saying you started with space and vessels finish that first then move on to the second course of the meal...
I am yet so afraid they will focus 99% on  "walking"  I have nothing against, it's great - but by far not the only thing i would except from an addon  Beside walking 5 minutes and the wow effet  if there is nothing both interesting And valuable to do, it will be kinda useless some news about  "the global game" ?  - new ships ? - new missions ? - new challenges ? - new flying entities ? - the politic faction game ? - new "galnet" ? - some piracy / bounties update to make it more interesting ? - mining major  improvements ? - Trading major improvements  ? - Exploration major improvements ? - new equipements ? - new earth vehicules ?  I guess "no no no no no no no no no nothing not much"  but look, you can now " go outside in a desert planet" I hope i am wrong.
Please let me walk around inside my ship.
I can't tell whether to be excited or scared... It seems too good to be true.
Elite looks more and  more like Star Citizen = Sterile and lifeless. It would  be nice if they created patch that would weather things a bit... turn it a bit towards Star Wars worn-out-of-usage aesthetics ...
I'm waiting for something like this since the very moment I've pre ordered the game, thank you.
Ok. This gets me pretty excited. I do hope we'll see the interior of our ships someday, but yeah, this is a good start.
I hope I can sit and watch people land badly from the window. Maybe could do a land-olympics.
Yes or no answer if possible: say there are 10 commanders docked at a station. Can we all meet in the bar?
I remember when EVE online tried this.... Well can't be worse than the other title.
So we cant walk around our own ships.  Can we walk around our fleet carriers?
Could maybe add the ability for us to walk around some of our ships?
Looking forward to seeing a Thargon and killing it on foot.
It's been a couple years since I played Elite but this will definitely bring me back. RIP Star Citizen
Please please please don't mess this up Frontier, i'm so hyped
RSI star citizen ridiculous  BYEEEEEEEEE next rime RUN! and not sell starship for 10000$
I’m confused. Is this game loved by the majority of people? Thinking of buying it
Deliver something more than a new mission type to endlessly grind on foot and I'll come back. So far looks uninteresting and outdated. Acting as if being able to get out of the spaceship is such a big deal while games done that years ago is silly to say the least.
Walking on planets and stations is far more important in a game where transferring from ship to ground and FTL to stations is seamless. The only loading you're doing is the instance your loading into or when you turn on the game. Creating a ship interior that is always in motion, has to transfer from zero g, to micro g, and then planetary g, is likely to have more mechanics then just, 'oh, looks purdy', has to seamlessly transfer from interior to station/planet/space. FDev is trying to make the experience as seamless as possible, and doing it this way is much more efficient.
Sees combat helmet, Sabaton kicks down my brain door and starts singing;  *"They are the panzer elite, born to compete, never retreat"*
Make a character survival system.  Pilot Skill System. Add buyable apartments and hangars for collecting ships and artifacts found on planets. Make tons of customization options for our homes and characters (For example cybernetic devices and body parts, because why not? It's future! And it will help you survive on your space legs).
The problem is the money. I have to pay 90 dollars total for the full experience and the extra 60 bucks I have to keep paying every year.
I’m thinking Odyssey is gonna be a separate game. Your not gonna just plot a course from Colonia to some outpost. You will however *transfer* from ED to Odyssey. Nevertheless, I’m in!
I fucking love this!
You know, I don't see a single NPC standing on a chair. Unplayable. right
Ich freue mich schon so da drauf...
Интересно Виртуальная реальность будет поддерживаться? Взаимодействие с предметами? Wondering Virtual reality will be supported?  Interacting with objects?
Hurry up, Chris
*This is so gonna rock the Space Simulation Games Genre, that it will set future devs scrambling to match it.  **_Let alone surpass it._*  That said, the only thing that'd make it truly Epic, would be to have a player created, and character used musical instrument system similar to LOTRO.
wooow this looks good !
hahahahahahahahahahahaha, so i hope you guys will do it than is worth to come back to this thingi we name Space "SIM"
Come one, open the pre-order already!
I suspect you dont get in out of ship   i bet you this is only on some planets ...i bet you that how you go on foot is landing on a designated planet with ground base that lets you roam ....so you land at the HUB and Exit the HUB by foot or wheels
drooooool
Elite is going to be StarCitizen *love it*
TWO letters *VR* (real VR not a screen in the HMD.) TWO words *Ship interiors.*  Its not like you dont have the staff over there at frontier. Or the years to have included these two options.
I haven't ben able to play this game since I bought it back in APRIL so sad..
Can I  use the $10,000 coffee machine in my Krait (which you can't see without getting up with VR on and walking back there) ?
Стилистика похожа на масс эффект андромеда. И в андромеде есть APEX
Thb .... It seams like walking in the ship as a first step would have been much easier and more wanted .... If we can't explore or own ship I would be disappointed to say the least
Maybe with apex, the traditional passenger missions would be done away with, like doing missions for a faction, with instead the tab being entirely apex stuff, and you could transport players and npcs around the nearby star systems.
Well the first thing I want is long hair
Hopefully we can make coffee in the Krait
Really curious if it'll also be possible to walk around inside ships! And go out of ships at any stage, even in space.
PLEASE!!!! VR!!!!!
awesome!  can't wait to be disappointed with shallow grinding and endless game breaking bugs found and reported in the beta, as usual!
Fantastic but i really wanna just explore my fucking Anaconda. Looks cool tho.
The fact that you have to pay for it is ridiculous, this should be part of the base game, everything should be part of the base game actually.
This is starting to look very good. It's just a MASSIVE shame that Frontier chose to give us things like the Thargoids and Engineers before the far more important walking about planet surfaces/spaceports and planets with atmospheres. There have been some truly AWFUL decisions made on this game, and whilst Odyssey is looking good, i fear it is too little too late and won't bring that many people back to the game. This should have been paramount importance and implemented ASAP, not 6 years later!
Until this gets VR support, I am out! I bought the game because I read it was a must have for VR...and it is, but I am not taking my headset off, to put on another headset, then go into a 2D world.  Hopefully, the VR supports comes sooner than later.
*Rip* Star Citizen , but it sad .
Take this and give me walking on my ship where I spend most of the time
@1:54  here's you hot fresh cup of life support, shall I hook it to your leg?
It looks awesome. You guys did a good job! But I expect something more in terms of the environment. Weather wind and clouds)
NPC side kick?
Lol this is more like it, but now I know I have seen though advertisements somewhere else.  Please Elite fix it so fleet carriers can dock at certain stations.  Also it be cool if you can walk around fleet carriers, good way to use apex
chris roberts fails again
Lmao. I made my account in like...early 2014? Pre-alpha. The pricey pre-alpha. I snagged the name "u". I haven't played in years because it's a fucking snooze-fest ruined by nerds attacking everyone and nothing meaningful to do. This changes things. I might actually play again.
As long as every NPC from a non-controlling faction says something other than "We don't run this place, but we have an... understanding with the people that do," I think I'll be OK. ;)
Weapons...too many weapons... I still miss atmospheric landings and a Linux version, as was promised once upon a time ago...
Oh Boy... Combat and Piracy... Elite turns to a FPS??? Please don't. And how do you explain players death now? Am I just a holome?
Please, just please, don't let us down. Been waiting for this forever now, please don't screw it up.
Ahh so this is what a finished star citizen looks like.  Good job guys.  Now imagine if you had 300 million to do this.
Heres a suggestion:  Players can also exit pilot seats and walk around in their ships, be able to sleep, eat and then after they land at a dock/station/settlement , theyll be able to walk out of the ship and walk around on the landing deck, also walk into the space dock and explore around, like visiting walmart and parking your car and remembering what parking number you parked at?
And for 2025 or so you're going back to working on the thing people actually signed up for? You know, that whole "flying spaceships" thing that's the basis of the series? Like delete all progress, fix the economy, make anything that's not really boring carry worthwhile ingame rewards, and start fresh? Punish cheaters instead of giving them a light slap on the wrist while your "community" glorifies them? Maybe have robust multiplayer game loops that aren't the slapdash bodges of multicrew or fragile instancing that breaks the second one actually tries to use it, and enable proper ship specialisation through cooperation instead of immediately invalidating 90% of the available car park? All those little things you've been missing out on since Horizons became a thing. I'll be getting Odyssey for "free" (you're welcome to that premium beta money...), but still can't see myself wasting time on playing it.
I don’t think this’ll be ready by 2021
I'm not crying! You're crying!
Looks awesome. Thanks frontier!!  Ignore naysayers and perpetual whiner consumers who have never produced anything- we appreciate what you do!!
Will you be able to walk inside your own ship? Still the most important feature for me. I want to feel the size of my ship. Let me walk under it, on it, through it.
Oh wow, so Odyssey really *IS* _No Man's Elite: Dangerous Sky_ after all...  ... I jest of course! I'm excited to see how this shapes up.
I wonder if while in a port I can see other players in their ships flying around? Will ports be restricted to the number of players? Will they be server or instance-based? Can someone bombard open air ports from their ship?
This actually looks better than what I expected, but of course it’s just a trailer...
I've always wanted to walk around those stations. This is going to be cool I don't care what people say.
Looks great I hope it's optimised so the frame rate will still be ok to run on most PC's. That is still a problem in SC for my system. 1080 ti, i5 CPU &16 gig ram.
4:03 there are stairs up into the ship ...
Frontier, I love you.
As much as the ED People dislike 'Star citizen', you guys sure do quite alot of talking about that game - hmmm, maybe i should take a look at this *'Star citizen game', since it makes so many ED and X-reb people so incredibly emotional!
Will the bartender AI surpass that of Star Citizens cutting edge bartender AI technology though? This is a deal breaker for me.
Star Citi...what was that alpha project called again? I forgot in the midst of all this practical, fucking awesomeness I just witnessed here. I bet it cost a hell of a lot less than a 1/3 of a billion dollars too.
Star Citizen without the incompetence and mismanagement.
take my money (/ARXs?)!
BOTH!! ✝👍
Bring this game to GoG you fruit loops 🤬
Ok but will it actually have content tho.
Imagine spending 120 on a game.....oh wait....
being one of the original Elite Dangerous KickStarter Backers, I have always come back to this game for pure relaxing enjoyment. While the game has no real narrative because it was always designed around how you play. My play model has always been questionable and I really need to return to this game this add a whole new perspective to it. I think No Mans Sky did give inspiration to this game as the concept was shown as a bit of a disaster to start with but improved and matured over time. This game has aged quite well on a fraction of Star citizens budget.
о7
oh! wow! frontier *have* been busy!! :O
If you die on foot, you should lose all your rank and reputation except credits and ships, top of that you should still need rebuy for the destroyed ship.. So that would be real hardcore..  If you die in your ship, there must be a second chance with "escape pod" and your faction should give the rescue mission of you for decent reward, after rescuing and returning the "escape pod" your consciousness could transfer your new clone body, so, whoala, you survived.
This is great! So great that I can't believe it... But, on one condition, if the optimization is as it is now. If FPS requires a technical revolution, then alas... What are The technical requirements for your computer???
That's what I'm talking about, Developers not complaining about home office or blaming home office like Funcom, just delivering good looking content on their own time. I'm looking forward to coming back to Elite when this is out. I hope you make it new user friendly, I didn't feel that Elite was explaining itself well and the possibilities of the game the last time I was around. I enjoyed flying around but it was a bit aimless. I was like "Oh, you can land on planets now, cool". And I see people on twitter enjoying this tremendously so this is a good addition. Of course it cannot shake the enormous shadow of Star Citizen, but it's all right, I'm sure this will be more accessible. Make sire that exploring remains organic, and I have goals to go out for. And guns. Lots if guns :D
Spaceports, finally some good news! As long as we don't have to interact with the universe via the stupid commodities/missions screens anymore!
cant do both there are no ship interiors....
Are we starting from 0 in odyssey or do we keep something from horizons?
Возьмите мои деньги!!!
"Elite = freedom of choice" eh?  Is that why all ED's ships have space speed limits?  Because of how free we are to fly them, right?  I mean so long as we don't choose to literally _apply thrust_ in any plane, or rotate at more than 1 rad / day in any axis - apart from _that_ minor, academic, detail - you got us covered, right?    Great, i can hardly wait, to explore all five different types of hand-placed non-procedurally-generated resource-hogging environments, because that, surely, is the ultimate expression of freeform spaceflight, right?    Running around a limited number of set-piece FPS levels, with fake physics and canned FX - presumably cordoned off with glass walls, because of the whole freedom of choice to have your freedom of motion curtailed, thing - just because it's all so uncompromisingly-faithful to Elite's core concept and play style, _not?_  More like "er, mebe we can't actually _do_ free-form spaceflight but no matter, here, look - half a _Half Life_ level!  Wahey!  Geddin, right?"      So, anyways...  i'm guessing this prolly ain't the best time to ask for an updated set of ship models for FFE?  Yeah no i'll get me coat..  <Skulks back to FFE>.. _"there is no god.  No justice.  The Breadbins was always a figment of our imagination.  Lies, all lies.."_
Looks great, looking forward to buying it.  I wonder if, in addition to being able to walk around on planets, stations and stuff, we'll also be able to walk around the inside of our ships too? Like climb that tantalising boarding ladder on the ship's nose landing gear, to the airlock at the top...
It's Cool
Some of those interiors look a bit... Familiar.
this looks incredible, i dont think people realize how big of a deal this is.
Nothing about walking around the own ship ....😥
thank you.  i want to walk around my ships, get out and build a base on a planet far far away from anyone and call it my own, my own planet, and make a planetary outpost that has automated mining and manufacturing so I can build my own ships and parts, if poss?
Honestly gonna play it either way but I've gotta ask: So we are getting out of our ships to talk to mission givers.... just sounds like missions with extra steps... literally.   On the other hand if they can do zero G with proper animations and the ability to use hand holds around your ship to propel and stop your momentum than I would be impressed, alas that doesn't seem to be on this update. Oh and on that note I don't think Elite has artificial gravity so don't expect to walk around you're ship in flight, and until they add zero G navigation it aint gonna be.
There is only one real crux of the matter which will make or break the game: *Speed.* 1) If the rewards for running around on planets or scavenging in your spacesuit and so on are NOT as fast as missions you can complete with your ships, people will abandon it for a gimmick and thus it will become a failed development. The only people that will remain using it will be those making machinimas. Machinimas don't pay your bills and don't uphold your reputation as a developer nor is it a compelling selling argument for new players. 2) If grabbing missions from station npcs while walking in stations is far slower than selecting your ship jobs from the UI, then a lot less people will care. 3) If you split the black market between what you salvaged on foot and on ship, then the "immersive" black market in station will be left abandoned. 4) Give us incentive to stay longer on a planet than just land, doing a single mission and then wanting to go off-planet again.  5) Do not punish us for wanting to use the new forks of interaction and gameplay that you bring to us. Make them worth the additional time spent. 6) DO NOT FORGET WING MISSIONS.  Dear FDev, you have to make sure that you give us the "skip-this-crap" button and use convenience-quicktravel options so we will be compelled to play it for longer than just to sate our curiosity for the new stuff. Odyssey is also your chance to fix the discrepancy between playing together as a squadron / multicrew / wing. The 4 ship limit or single crewed ship limit to play together is a real downer. There is no point flying multicrew
I'm curious to see how it will work with VR
This is Commander Wyveres ... and this is my Favorid Part on the Cita ... äh Jamsons Memorial ...
Hmm... Not quite sure how this ended up in my feed as I don't play the game anymore. I see this and think Scam Citizen... Different suits and so on. Yeah this will be a microtransaction shitshow. I am glad I stopped playing this game... pity really as I was dumb enough to buy a lifetime pass... Well, live and learn.
this is changing more than i thought it would.. either way i think it  will be worth a buy. this is your chance Fdev to make things Right with the player base.
Finally, I can go grind at Dav's Hope without doing the insane rally circuit LOL Now if some day FDev implements this on VR with touch controllers .... But good stuff this time, well done I've the feeling by the time I can play SC ... well, NVM haha!!
Rip star citizen, this is gonna be so awsome, cant wait!
I Remember Playing in the 80s on the  zx spectrum. Going to Lave and buying Food
I really hope they develop the VR, its why I play. Its easily the best VR game out there....please dont let it drift away.
Guys, what you are doing here is very ambitious and equally impressive, but please please please, do not drop the VR support. This is what makes No Mans Sky great and the reason why I got into Elite Dangerous. Both are amazing in VR!
Chris Roberts is sweating right now! LOL
Amazing work. This guys are completly commited with players desires. They never stop to inovate. One of the best games of the decade.
I'd love to hear more about the on-foot progression. Like are there weapon upgrades and side-grades, similar to ships and ship components? Do suits have components that can be upgraded or changed? I want to hear about this stuff.
This feels so unreal. Looks so amazing. Somewhere I just don't believe it will be this extremely good guys. Amazing work 🙏
Please don't just turn this into, drop on a planet and walk around with nothing to do (Like SRVs). I have high expectations for this. I want to be able to explore alien ruins. Do questlines and bosses. I have envisioned this essentially become Mass Effect meets Elite. And please for the love of god make it so all methods are equally as prosperous financially, I'm tired of the restrictive methods of making creds (currently either taking passengers from Robigo, or Mining Painite endlessly). Since you guys decided to kill off LTD and Void Opals, obtaining a Fleet Carrier is a pipe dream to most of us without doing 50 - 100 hours of passenger missions.
I can only imagine the amount of work thats gone into making this....wow wow wow
I think it's save to say, that people really shouldn't get overexited. I, for myself, am still quite looking forward to it, while maintaining sort of a realistic (or how ever you want to call it) expectations.
no word about VR
Can't wait to walk around under the effect of Lavian Brandy and become the drunken CMDR I've always wanted to be ;) thanks DEVs!
Mass exodus and migration from the star citizen ponzi to ED's new era predicted.
Sadly it'll be just like every other update. Cool new stuff and nothing to do
Ahaha, what the hell are you talking about. You practically destroyed piracy. There's no point to do it, there's no profit from that. And pp is a joke by itself with solo/ private. Try to balance all professions please for god sakes....
This Is Really Huge ! I Hope You Can Also Walk In Ship ♥ ♥
I might have to apologize for my prior lack of faith.  This is probably what I needed after watching the absolute tragedy that was the 2020 presidential debate.
SOLD! When Pre-Order?!!!
You have under-hyped this content. Congratulations. Outstanding. You have outdone yourselves since Beyond Chapter 4. Keep up the good work :)
Can we get swords as weapons please?
...can we please have "october 2020" count as "really early in 2021"???? /me wants.
Looks good to me
cool, but still not clear on whether we can walk around our ships
I loved this game. But it got lonely. If I found a group to play with I'd probably get back in it
This will be great, only if there is restrictions to stop it turning into an unwanted PVP griefing nightmare, to allow interaction with NPC and exploration without constant harassment from other players in public lobbies.
This will probably be one of the best game updates of the year
Full Beard!
This is awesome
Oh no... Is that the sound of Star Citizens lunch being eaten?
Remember kids... when this launches:    Diet Steakette is bad..   Don't buy it if they start selling foods...
Let people play how they want its just saying "we sell you an 40$ DLC for basic mechanics, in a game you allready bought with an DLC, but you dont need it"  just go ahead and do nothing
Just wondering if this is going to have a significant performance impact?
I think the thing that is most important for the elite devs to realise is that the journey to explore outside of your ship starts with you getting up out of your pilot's seat, walking around your ship to the exit hatch, opening that hatch and seamlessly taking that first step onto these new planets. It's mind boggling how little this simple step has registered with the devs. The most. Let me say this again. The MOST important thing to a player of elite is their ship. Your journey starts and ends with the pilot's seat. Being able to walk about a planet sounds great but, I guarantee I'll do that for a few planets and then find myself landing as close to where ever I'm going so as to minimise having to walk! In contrast to that I know I would be spending ages walking about my ship. Reconfiguring the modules and then walking around my handy work. What exactly does a mk 3 reactor look like. How vast is the anaconda's internal bays etc etc. Barren rocky planet....yea...
So when I land my ship, will i be able to get out of my chair / navigate through the ship to it's exit, then walk on froot from my ship to the station ?  Or is it just going to be like every other game where your screen fades out for a few moments and your suddenly in the station ?  Same question also regarding ground vehicles :D
I see guns ! And shops with guns !!
...Chris Gregory's Blue Sun T-Shirt... nice touch!!
Finally
I'm thoroughly loving the fact that the team are huge space sci-fi nerds, you can feel it. I can't begin to tell how much I appreciate it from the bottom of my heart. I've waited for a game like this in a long while.  And I'm thankful for the community that it attracts. Definitely my best discovery in 2020.
Base suit? I've got 5 billion credits cash. I'll take all the suits with all the extras. Thanks.
Куда кидать деньги?
i came
While this video keeps talking about how those vivid and varied NPCs will bring this universe to life, I just can't get over the fact that that lady at 2:04 looks exactly like my character, who used a default face...
i hope walking around is more enjoyable than driving the srv
Will there be a gauss pistol to hunt thargoids?
If we die whilst on foot, what happens??
Отличные новости!
so Elite Dangerous: odyssey  will be delivered before SC: Beta launch ryt ?!
The Mandalorian comes to Elite. Excellent.
I'm really liking the new direction. Here's hoping it doesn't get stuck in developer hell like SC.
Уважаемые фронтиры!  Я надеялся, что вы сделаете возможность прогулки по своему кораблю, но вы делаете гораздо больше. Буду рад увидеть данные нововведения.
This looks a lot like Mass Effect
I NEED THIS IN VR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Give me a Rover Akira looking Motorbike to drive around far distances on planets and still call my ship where ever i go.  And im good to go!!!!!
In the shot of the Cobra in the hangar there are a couple of flights of stairs in the background. Looks like we may be getting out of our ships into new hangars, walking up the stairs to some lifts / elevators that will act as a loading screen for the social hubs.  At least that is what I hope.
First place I'm going is Davs Hope to find out just what did happen to those poor souls
Looks fantastic! Will we be having casual wear + emotes as well, for just socializing and lounging around the stations?
If you really want us to have freedom and agency, how about you make it so trade, exploration and combat pay as much as mining?  I will never understand why the most exciting and ridky playstyles have the least rewards.
Please let us start new characters on PC and still get to keep our old saves! I want to play from the start with Odyssey but not lose my progress!
I look forward to this and hope it lives up to it.. Starcitizen makes great devlogs and previews as well but until i see this released im not taking much seriously, SC taught me that.
Fascinated, but no "wow" factor like the first had, for me
I wonder if it will be possible to buy an apartment in a home station, maybe even design it as we like. While playing Fallout I really liked that feeling of security and relaxation when you got home...
Очень и очень и очень хорошо 👍
This isn't a complaint, i absolutely adore elite and cant wait for odyssey but after all that talk about "telling you own story" you really need to buff credit earnings from combat, its  one of the most fun things to do in this game and sadly it has been just completely non-viable credit wise for the longest time
i hope we can land on earth
Most important is for the environments not to feel barren, and the NPCs not to feel like manequins.
seeing how it worked until now I have to assume that odyssey will at least cost 50$. The DLC will bring something overpowered for players who are payers, but it will be super hard and tedious to grind. SO the vanilla players are sad that they are underpowered once more and the DLC buyers have no fun either as most of the grinds that FD puts in the game are horrible. My soul is still drained after grinding engineers a year ago. Devs are so lucky this is the only functioning online space game, as they don't know what good gameplay loops are
Really looking forward to this! Im hoping this will boost the popularity of Elite.
Cool! I was not expecting to much after the 1st one... But you get an A+ for that Dev diary! The first one was... Actually let's look forward to the next  one... I am now very much! Cheers
Looks good
But are there speeders and can I use the force or wield lightsabers???
3:01 "players will be able to book journeys to and from ports within jump range". But your not in your ship, there is no "jump range", so you could in theory book a ticket from the bubble to Colonia... Hence the comment makes no sense!  It took them weeks to edit this together? Really? 😳
Guns look too big and cartoon-ish, so they by scale may become an IMMERSION BREAKER. Also placing them on the back is a mainstream decision a`la Ghost Recon/Division and it looks bad. Guns on a back looked good only in Mass Effect because there they were foldable and didnt take so much space. In reality guns like assault rifles are usually being carried on the chest, or on a side for easy access during combat.
Looks like SC. However, unlike SC, I am relatively confident FDev will release this next year.
Oh my! This is AWESOME!!! Can't wait for the release to make the greatest game even better!
"Beam me up, Braiben"
Where is Raxxla
ED is finally giving us more of what star citizen has promised for years, except ED is a solid game built on a proven engine and it's not just some cash grab string of promises riddled with overhype, disapointment and high RL cost. This fps step is a much needed and much wanted one, as well as a big step in the right direction. Got pretty bored with ED fairly fast due to staring out my ships windows or buggy windows while feeling like a cripple in a hamster ball.
Awesome and that’s the Xsens mocap suit at 1:55, cool!
Okay! but how about on board the new Fleet Carriers? It would be awesome if the players who own them had the capacity to command them from the bridge.
If you get lost on a desert world, just remember: fear is the mind-killer.
Will there be live action events in the game? Or things like occupying a star system ( as an orga for excample )? Sadly, after a month or so, I feel lost/lonely/bored in ED ( and im a Kickstarter backer )
I don't need anymore my 9-5 with the help of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Can we get a confident confirmation on ship interiors? Without any of the "not at launch" BS.
SUPER NEWS
I don't want to buy this on steam will there be a pre order option for PC gamers?
Que ganas le tengo a esta expansión
I was already looking forward to Odyssey... now I'm just grinning ear to ear.  o7
years ago  when horizons came out, i made a choise and it was elite dangerous, today i just want to say thank you frontier be cause this game was not just a promise, this was an adventure, and im glad to be an elite dangerous commander, now you hear our voise and we will raise this game agan this is a completely new life to the game, i wish to have some doom style, and mysterious sites to explore, find black boxes with mysteries and all that stuff to get more in to exploration, not just make credits, missions to rescue people, save slaves and fight for freedom as  humanity we have to elevate our instincts in that what if adventure of elite dangerous, and we need a real powerful multipurpose ship, not limited in jump range as actually we are, just a few more punch so we can use our medium and small, combat ships to explore too  and open a new kind of opportunities, not just limited to one kind of use our ships.
I have been playing elite for 4 years and still wish they had a campaign mode specifically for the new players. CAMPAIGN would make this game so op. It has everything in place for it.
now this is actually what i was waiting for and oh boy you nailed it
New SRV's models, space bikes, skate boards... And we wanna NPC's on the bridge with us too.
Please give us hoverbikes F-Dev!
I don’t understand how to play this game I bought it like 2 years ago and still have starter ship lol
Checks notes, looks at features:  "Oh, so they're trying to outdo star citizen at star citizen itself."
I cant wait. I wanted this released yesterday. But, i can wait....I know, im contradicting myself :P...Im hyped. Looks great FD!
NPC's expanding the narrative?  There is a narrative in Elite?
will there be thargoid costumes to run around in?
I literally just bought Star Citizen today.. Mistakes have been made..
This is what I've wanted from Elite for years.
If only we could walk inside our own ships... it would be perfect!
Boarding action would be super cool.  Board and hijack a ship, bring it to a shipbreaking yard for some cash, but do it quickly otherwise the faction you just stole that ship from will keep trying to get it back. THATS some quality pirate action
ED FANS: SC is just a walking simulator ED: Releasing a walking simulador ED FANS: OMG THE BEST GAME EVER
Finally to be able to see this day, even as a preview its possibilities are mind boggling. I play both ED and SC and I say let the golden age of space sims descend on us all!!!
So basically just another empty shell like the main game. No real content only a poor and subtle framework in which you can "create your own story". Frontier, you STILL need to take ownership of Elite. Create content. A proper loot system with different levels of gear and create a skill tree. Make it proper!
I'm in when VR will work with that expansion - can't wait for that!
Wait.......why aren't all the people in the space station standing ontop of the chairs?
Okay...im not gonna lie....this is awesome...but...if we ahve to use a loading screen to get from our chair to outside our ship....that totally breaks immersion. A simple interior we can walk to the srv or out of the ship would make such a difference to immersion. We don't need a lot to do in the ship, but finally getting rid of that "fade to black" would completely change how it feels.
Will Odyssey work in VR? So can I walk around in VR at these starports?
Опа, появился повод для возвращения в игру
Make walking in our ships next and you'll have the real winner game. It's what the community wants!!
I really hope that new models of wheeled transport will be made. Or, at least, fix the Scarab. Now it moves on the reverse much more stable than straight
Dear FDev,  I enjoy Elite Dangerous since its release. I've had my hiatus, then I came back. Meanwhile, I keep my eyes on Star Citizen, which so far, despite its drawbacks and "development hell", appears to be scratching an itch your game does not reach yet.  With Odyssey, you're officially surpassing the limitations that had me peek at Star Citizen at times. I know it will not entail the full spectrum of mechanics of SC at launch, maybe it never will. But I know that you put more emphasis on quality and that each element you implement will work near perfectly from the start.  From what I've seen so far, you're getting very close to Star Citizen in terms of gameplay options. Which I think is great. I'm sure CIG is currently biting their nails, as this update might be another push to draw active players from Star Citizen towards Elite, giving them a run for their money ($300 Mil, lol)  I'm looking forward to what Odyssey will offer on release and your plans to develop this system further in future (ship interiors anyone? Make the coffee maker on my Krait Mk2 usable - I'd get to Hutton Orbital for a mug right away!)  Thanks for being you, FDev.  CMDR Okinawa-Gaijin signing off o7
CROSSPLAY!
I think you are biting off more than you can chew and you are still not addressing the existing game play and balance issues. Game is to much of a grind. Combat is broken. Engineering is broken. Most of all there is no engaging game play beyond the novelty of new mechanics.
Station!!
Hmmm... Ok ok
😱 I’m still trying to engineer!!
Wow. Looks amazing. Keep up the amazing work!
Boarding action modules someday?  pretty pretty please?  I want to put my multi-crew friends in boarding torpedoes and fire them at the enemy.
RIP Star Citizen. Press F to donate another 25 Million Dollars for Star Citizen
Замечательно! Amazing!
This looks awesome but I have 1 question will we be able to walk around the interiors of our ships to do other things, if so I cannot wait to multi-crew a ship with some friends
looooool, "we want freedom of choice"  well, then allow player factions you assholes
Really excited to do the same missions I've been doing the last 1k hours of my playtime.. but get this... now i have to leave my ship and walk to the terminal to accept it
I'M SCREAMING   LETS GOOOOOOOO
tome su like buen hombre
Took you guys long enough
Will leave star Citizen if you have a 3rd person camera with HUD
Please just make a 3rd person camera option with HUD
Have you noticed how they never said you can disembark EVERYWHERE?
Please allow the Player factions to offer some form of "personalisation" to our factions for interaction with players.  My faction have embraced our pregen NPC front people and have built personalities for them, would love to be able to have at least a bunch of personality templates we could assign to our NPCs.
Please allow us to customize SRV's and give us multiple tpyes of SRV's!!! I want to go to a planet with a post-apocalyptic type culture that has SRV demolition derby's!!!!
This makes me genuinely happy 🧡
I'm a heavy backer of SC, but the bartender NPC mocap was killing it lmao. Well done! I'll definitely buy the Odyssey. Haven't seen my Anaconda for a while.
Can we have more than 1 suit?
Okay, now I'm excited!  I want to board the remains of a Zeno, shoot a Thargoid and collect its heart!
Exploration and passenger services are back baby! I’m so hyped!
At first, you had my attention. Now, you have m- Maybe quoting TFS Perfect Cell here isn't appropriate... so let me say this got me hyped.
I’m getting a weird vibe from this dev log. For starters, pilots have always been “holograms”, meaning our body is always safely sitting on a planet somewhere. Now they’re talking about Odyssey players needing a way to move between planets as though they don’t, or can’t, own their own ship.   Also, why would a hologram ever need to purchase a weapon? Or how would it be able to gather samples on a planet? And if we’re not holograms anymore, what happens when our character is killed in game now? I don’t see “cloning services” on the station directory in this dev log.  I’m worried that we won’t get the chance to join our bodies with our ships at all. Given the distance most of our ships would be from  any habitable world, that would be a marathon run in itself, and then what happens if we go back into space, finally sitting in our cockpit for real, and then someone blows up our ship? Do we eject? Do we die permanently?  I hope all of this gets addressed!
Rip star citizen, obsolete before its even finished lol
No npcs standing on chairs? They are not excited enough lol
Unless the NPCs salute me and my rear admiral status I grinded the hell out of, I'm disappointed.
'deep breath' ААААААААААААА
No ship interior? You got it backwards
I hope i can personally take part in a war on the ground/in a station.
I just hope the navigation in space stations is a lot better than Star Citizen. I played a little bit of that and navigating those stations was absolutely horrible. From what i see in the video it looks pretty straightforward with that main corridor looking area.
I'm now gonna buy this game, always wanted to play before and this is just the push i need.
If squadrons can form a colony outpost it would be perfect.
The almost infinite ankle-deep puddle just got a little deeper.
But no walking about in your own ship's cockpit.
Mierrrda necesito un ordenador y un htc vive
My first thought Star Citizen went into beta! but no.
Woah... Okay, maybe this update isn't gonna be as bland as I thought.
Going to get flamed for this I'm sure, but the clips showing inside shops looks almost EXACTLY like the shop in Star Citizen.  Just sayin!  Still looking forward to all of this though.
Hmm... Does this mean we get to walk around inside Thargoid Surface Sites? Also, thank you very much for making Horizons part of the base game. It's something I've believed should have been done from the get-go, and I think it's really a more complete experience rather than something that should be sold as expansion, so kudos for that.
just... wow
Now we're talking! Love the visuals. Some dev gameplay footage would have been icing but I realise we are still several months out. Still this instills some hope for the future of ED. Fdev, please remember this is set in 3306 so imagine just how many humans there would be in stations and colonies. LOTS. HEAPS. A sprinkling of NPCs will not imbue the galaxy with the sense of life and activity. So more please.
... hang on, this isn't VR?? WTF IS THE POINT
Everyone the same height and shape is going to look a bit weird, once you're out and about tbh
hahahahahahhahahaha trying to be star citizen hahahahhahahahaha this looks like ass. cute attempt tho
I love Elite Dangerous.  I haven't opened it in like three years but I love it.
As someone who just started a few days ago, this looks incredible. Travelling around space was already awe inspiring, but now we're going to be able to explore planets on top of that? Definitely going on my hype list.
I am not interested in the space legs, I would like to see the atmospheric planets.  How will they appear?  What about water and earth like world?  These are my questions.
Please don’t do a no mans sky
I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW UNBELIEVABLY ERECT I AM RIGHT NOW
And u want more money for that?
Nice. When are you going to issue patch #6 and fix the Pulse Wave Scanner?
Looking good! Huge potential. If you add ship interios slowly too, it will. Be perfect.
Really loving these frequent update videos. It's cool to see what's going on behind the scenes
I hope they add more variants of the SRV or just more land vehicles.
David Braben is coming for Chris Roberts' throne...
Ok hear me out, you make player taxi. What I mean by this is, let's say you are on a station and want to go to another station without taking your ship. Players can pick in the apex place that they want to go to a place for x amount of credit. Players close to the stations will then be able to accept the offer from their ships and "collect" the passenger with npc's if there are any or if you want. This would make the passengers delivery experience feel so much better and real since you are cruising through the galaxy with real players. If no one accepts the offer the player requesting the offer can change it or be picked up by npc's for a higher price. Please take this into consideration. It's a great opportunity to actually show players that you still care about this fantastic and marvelous pearl we call Elite Dangerous. o7 CMDR'S. Stay Elite and Fly Dangerously.
Definitely looking forward to being able to explore generation ships, derelicts, and the various abandoned surface settlements. And thargoid bases.
Ship interiors. You know we want to unlock that hidden room in the Anaconda...
Hope they can pull it off, I  might try it, best of luck
Who was asking for this?
I see people saying, "It's FDev; expect disappointment." But then I look at and play Star Citizen and think to myself, "...yeah I'm pretty sure I'll handle whatever they put out just fine."
I'd love to walk around inside my ship
Just...Wow!
Is this a new dlc?
bartender @ 1:53 is alpha-level trolling
I like the ambition.  Looking forward to it even more now.  I hope Powerplay is somehow tied into all of this (or even better, overhauled completely).
Ship Interiors Ship Interiors Ship Interiors Ship Interiors Ship Interiors Ship Interiors Ship Interiors Ship Interiors Ship Interiors This. Please. And. Thank. You.
Watch out Star Citizen....
Design wise, they obviously took a lot of stuff and art cues from Star Citizen. They should be thanking CIG paving the way.
Make sure you allow us to walk around on our ship
this stuff is really cool....i just want to be able to walk around inside of my little cobra.....we have bin asking for this for years now......
Can we walk on our Ships? Did they planned that?  When they will implement VR with odyssey?
Interesting, but going to flat during VR play is ridiculous. And kills it.
Absolutely fantastic job! Definitely keen to see the squadrons owned spaceports and settlements! If anyone is looking for a PC or xbox squadron that owns a few systems, does a bit of everything and is well established, check out Argus Defence Fleet!
Doesn’t look like there will be any combat on foot.
I wonder if they will ever make combat worth my time or I'll forever mine my way through the game.
Ship interiors or null.
As long as you add ship interiors sometime during the update, doesn't even have to be at release at this point, I'll be happy.
I guarantee this is still going to come out in a full release before Star Citizen.
things i would love to see in elite: squadron-based establishment of outposts in space and on planets and maybe stations and outposts sometimes getting bigger or abandoned like they get developed from a small outpost into a big station or the developing fails and the outpost maybe even gets abandoned... -> more living squadrons and their minor factions
holy mother of god this looks even better! im so happy and i cant wait!...i wonder if we can craft our own weapons and armors btw? :D sry if this is answered in video im just starting to watch :D
Frontier small development team: we have collected the most interesting gameplay features in this update! Chris Roberts: We collected 300 million for kick starter!
Will we be able to shoot everyone if we want?
Awesome!
I feel the FORCE------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------moving from SC too ED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!LOL
I hope this is amazing as it sounds.
oh and yeah - walking can be really tedious - it was ever the main concern - sry formy drunken rumble !! but jeez
Amazing!
I'm missing the void opal streets and palaces or whatever they were made of since clearly those 'rimworld' colonys with no food were always eager to trade for some 'pick of the month' resource.. Strap on as much of a - and I have to admit, well made simulation, immersive and all - on top of a casual-browser-tablet-i-phone-background-sim - I'm out.. gonna watch some 'The Pilot' - videos and that cool pirate guy who's always harrasing people, in a good way, and my thirst for Elite's gonna be quenched.
Haven't seen such a perfectly animated barkeeper in a space sim yet.
Day one buy.
If that is what we will have in the game, I do believe someone has to move the back lower body of his teams :D (late edit : tip : I'm not talking about Frontier ;)  )
Never mind bars, I want Thargoids to exterminate!
But can I have a space waifu and have interactive sex with her?      Just kidding, but I like this episode a lot more than the first one. I hope we can properly watch the landing zones too, similar to how you can look out of a GTA Online apartment and see the potential havoc other people are causing there (or watch Elite Racers going in and out).
You’re slowly restoring my faith fdev.
Oooooh, I can imagine all the bugs that WILL make in prod, and make it unplayable.  Exiting! /s
I read a comment in part 1 that said that the biggest flaw of the game was that a supposedly populated galaxy felt empy. Well mate, not anymore.
Bruh now ill I need are some faction uniforms and have a 20 man ai crew on the fed corvette
This + VR
I went from being completely uninterested in this expansion to 100% invested in 4:19 mins.
Anyone else getting a Firefly vibe?
This is great and all but.. What about new consoles???
People siiting on seats, chris roberts "How are you doing that!"
Oooh an Xsens Awinda mocap system :D
Elite Dangerous still doesn’t let you land on earth like you could in Elite Frontier back in 1993, right? So why on earth (pun intended) would they waste dev hours on a walking sim before completing their space sim?
You should not give me so much hype.
wonder how long it will take Star Citizen to get on this level.
This is actually pretty interesting.  The only concern I have is that it has been proven again and again that, from a player perspective, there is no way for any game to generate a infinite variation of station/settlement layouts...so just how many layout templates Frontier consciously designed in the game before the RNG god start spitting out the same repetitive locations over and over again?
To say that I'm crushed by hype would be an understatement, well done lads!
For all the ppl that bought horizons...all we get is a ship skin to compensate..
I don't know if my expectations were just being held down or not, but I was _not_ expecting the space stations to be walkable. Awesome 👍
Thankyou Frontier.
RIP Star Citizen
All very glitzy and clever but I wonder what it actually adds to Elite after the half hour novelty has worn off.  I'd rather see expansion of the Thargoid theme and any other interesting gameplay that FDev can come up with, especially if it doesn't allow Elite to metamorphose into something that it has never been.   I'm apprehensive about the direction the game is going in here.  I hope its much more than what I've seen so far and that my worries are groundless.
is joe blobbers crying ? dont see him here
Star Citizen всосал!
APEX!
The complete experience!!!
Короче, свобода выбора выходит на новый уровень: задротить или донатить. Сhoose your shmotki. ))
Spaceleg on planet + spaceleg on spatioport, last spaceleg on ship = perfect.  And if you could add flora and fauna and 2/3 news alien units, that would be great.
Well... there goes my life  My real one.
I cannot wait to walk around my Federal Corvette and look at the sheer size of it
once we r able to exit the ships and walk around on planets and etc, we’ll get tht real sense of scale on how small we r compared to our ships
After Citizen planets and cities, Elite can no longer catch up this locomotive. They are so far behind in the realization of life on the planets and it will not be possible to catch up, this will take years. I wil buy Odyssey if I get dozen of the ground vehicles like in Citizen, caves with labyrinths, planet mining, salvage, bunkers with NPCs, pvp battles and racing competitions etc. So far, I only see a copy of the Citizen with low resolution, good for 2014 but it's already 2021. Then it will take at least 2 years to clean up bugs, each update will crash everything.
uhm. Has the Cobra mk3 always had those steps on the front landing gear? I pretty sure it hasnt, i maybe wrong.
I actually like what I see and hear
3000 likes and 37 dislikes, looks like 37 people still haven't made it off the landing pad yet...
I fucking hate CIG all they do now is lie to backers. And if you respectfully voice that opinion they ban you from Spectrum. This game is so much better and the devs actually care.
I'm so stoked
Will it support VR?
Hope comes to life. Since year one i wanted to see this.  Looking forward to strolling and have a drink with all of you cmdrs.
So... it sounds like it's separate but also not?  I want to know more about how it connects and interacts with Elite Dangerous!
But can the NPCs creepily stand on chairs?
i hope, the cobra mk IV is then for free for all.
This is starting to look pretty good. I only wonder why we aren't getting to walk around INSIDE our ships, the place we spend the most time in.
can we disembark in space near a wreck? Also, would gravity be the same on all space stations? would an orbis station only have gravity in the rings?
Круто
This looks great very excited would be an understatement
It will be interesting to fast forward 5 years and see where we are with these games. Seems to me we have NMS, Star Citizen and Elite Dangerous all with ťheir own strengths and starting to converge and reach their finished states.
Please, PLEASE integrate fully roomscale VR gameplay.
god dammit, now i want this to come out right now
oh i'm never going back to star citizen lmao take my money, this can't even disappoint me at this point
Nobody will ever be walking that slow. People will be running and jumping all over the place :D
Odyssey may not be what everyone is or was hoping for but it does look like it's going to enhance the universe and the Elite experience. I'll remain optimistic and excited for the future of E.D; even if some of the more jaded Commanders out there remain pessimistic.
Never been this excited for a game ever!
Hell yeah, I can't wait.
Two things I would love to see added: 1. Have multiple passengers with some kind of quick animation showing people boarding on/off and give us feeling of being real 'space tour guide' with more varied locations than just geysers all the time.  2.Unique locations for faction HQ planets where we can get powerplay missions and meet the leaders.   3.Proper campaign. 4.Completely redesign engineering and how we go about upgrading ships.  The grindy gatcha system is disheartening and boring.   5.A separate combat mode where I can pick any ship to fight in and ships I want to fight.   Really love what I am seeing so far.  Feels good to be positive/optimistic about E:D again.  *crosses fingers*
TAKE MY MOMEY FRONTER!!!!!!
All I want is a fully modeled Anaconda interiors where I can explore every single rooms and feel like inside my own ship!
Ok but what about lightsabers. (Jk jk)
I really hope they don’t start a separate currency for suits and weapons, but price the ground equipment using credits as well.
Maybe as a new player, you start without a ship, doing only ground missions until you earn one?
please allow us to walk inside our ships
Look promising... hope they succeed
Elite is the 2nd most boring space sim I've ever played. From what I can tell, this just expands the boredom to lifeless, bland, unpopulated and uninteresting worlds... on foot.
Already looks more interesting than SC...
Name a price on this bad boy, you'll get it that instant.
I would like to be able to see more of the different compartments of my ship. Willing to pay for it also. The inclusion of  walkable interiors on the Space Stations is a move in the right direction. Keeping my fingers crossed we’re not having to jump thru hoops to buy any of the new equipment. Have my stomach full of engineering as it is.
I would rather had a new Elite by now, with all mechanics, user interface and gameplay redesigned from scratch. I left the game when they introduced the new system scan mechanics and turned my general purpose Anaconda useless, because i had to equip and manage so many subsystems though this awkward interface, designed for a whole different game, at the time the base game launched. The two separate scan modes killed the last interest in this game for me, and i don't belive just walking around a bit will spark my joy for it again. What FDEV calls gameplay is mostly a dry, technical, artificial set of gamey grind mechanics. The whole world and the interaction with it feels not real, but like a bord game or something. Everything is it's own mechanic, that need a separate grind. No, you have a great Battle Ship but you can't scratch a Alien Ship at all, you need to grind for a weapon for it.  But when you have it, you can't shoot pirates with it, because umm... just because! And of course you can't damage Asteroids either with any of those weapons, you actually need a third set of weapons for that, more so, you need different ones if you want to scratch or burst them! This is just arbitrary game design, every game style locked in it's own compartment, strictly separated artificially form each other.  Instead of Space Legs i would rather had a relaunch with a new game. Including a real economy. Not everything limited.
Building a game from a flight sim into this is going to be amazing.
This looks like it must've been a monumental lift, and I'm hopeful that everything works and it integrates well.  Thank you for all the hard work so far, and please keep it up! o7
Cool, now we will wait for ship interiors for 6 more years.
1:57 Ah, the true gem employee of Frontier.
PEGI 16! - Why remove this from the first release of this video????????????????????????
Elite Dangerous is going to have NPCs that actually function without T posing on top of chairs before Star Citizen does lmao. Let that sink in for a second.
Star Citizen Killer.
Settlements and social interactions definitely make no ship interiors on launch worth it for me. Still looking forward to interiors though.
Sounds great, I hope they can pull it off. The most important is that there be something to actually do.
Yeah this kid going to be a disappointment. I will never believe anything when it comes to elite until I see it on my screen right in front of my face.
Wow.  Looks great FDev.  Well done!
Omg, this looks amazing!! Keep it up devs, if it is indeed gonna look and feel like the videos you are showing Odyssey is gonna be amazing! Super excited,  thx for sharing a bit!!
it's finally here, a hope for the best space simulator to enjoy in this world full of unfinished games this mfkers took on a big thing, and they are actually doing it, i love it
Looks like they've been watching Star Citizen and NMS and thought... Yeah, we can do that. Bloody good effort FDev, it looks very promising, can't wait to have a look around, been on hiatus for too long. As for ship interiors, I'll wait but don't keep me waiting too long next time, I'm not getting any younger ya'know
You guys are the best! We all believe in you ! )Like saying:the darkest night before dawn,we hope that dawn is near ..)
The reborn of Elite and the dead of SC?
So elite is giving us great content and people won't stfu with ship interiors
COOOLLL!!!
You know, I don't see a single NPC standing on a chair. Unplayable.
I rather grind for 150 hours for the ship of my dreams than spending 150 bucks on it, period!
Wuaaahhhh it shivers me... when i see me walking around my ships and explore planets and stations in the elite universe.... I hope they wont fail with this great thing :-) MAN! i can answer the question how long i am walking through my carrier from edge to edge *gg
can bounty hunting not be so bad on getting money. thanks
Damn it! I promised myself to keep my expectations low
Now we are talking...Good work...show us more!! Some gameplay doing something mundane, using jetpacks...whatever.
set foot?  just 1 foot no feet. ...... "odyssey will provide players with a clear choice , take missions or explore."  sounds like a whole new game  ;p
Elite Dangerous is doing the exact opposite of what Star Citizen is doing. They first released the base game and started building from it, in Star Citizen they adding many many many additional things without even finishing the base game...
But you ruined exploration (for me anyway).
Wonderful direction
I am super excited for this.  I wish there was full VR support for it at launch, but maybe I'll invest in an eye tracker instead ;)
Sure looks like Elite Dangerous is going to beat Star Citizen to market.
I wonder what Star Citizen devs think of this? :)
Very nice!
Squeaky bum time for Star Citizen
hype  hype hype  ;) :)
Thanks for the german subtitles!
Absolutely amazing.  Looking so forward to this.  One caveat:  why are space stations always dull concrete grey, and not for example, pink?  It's male player agency.  Not little girl player agency.   :)   Hopefully more Commanders will persuade their sisters, daughters and wives to try Odyssey.  Then, and only then, will Elite be truly living.  I understand though. It will take time.  Congratulations to you FDev.   :heart:
When you say that the suits will have "strengths and weaknesses", is that going to be as disproportionate as the current engineered FDL vs an explorer Asp? Please don't make the suits "engineerable" and have that same disparity we currently have with ships.
Wow ... walking in station without simple ability to walk inside the bridge of your ship.... get to elevator  leading to your SRV or walking off the ramp of your ship is simply won’t be complete. Don’t know why devs don’t understand this. All this time and effort in such huge space where to walk... and that simple thing what most have been asking about simply skipped.
Fucking finally! Now if you expand this to ships interiors and add decorations for ships - like your own IKEA for ships interiors - I'll sink so much cash into my Anaconda! Exploration 5* hotel yacht here we go!
in the background at 2:52, that's my girlfriend's player faction logo on the shirts, whitetip operations.
Wow. When I bought this game 6 years ago at the age of 14 I never thought I'd still be getting hyped over it. Even with the ups and downs this game has had I still love it and FDev.
Now it's really worthy of epithets - "Awesome" & "Amazing"
People are assholes. Previous videos were full of hate. I told them to wait and see, they shut me down. Now everyone is suddenly happy. Losers!
I have a nice mission idea... let give us "taxi" missions. I mean if i want go somwhere i give mission online and some other player take that mission and take me there :)
I don't see any t-posing NPCs, so i'm sticking to Star Citizen tyvm
I like so much this type of community engagement called Dev Diary, so much that i will pre-order as soon it become available. But i am really coriuos about the technical and boring aspect of the implementation, what challenges you had to surpass in order to accomplish such milestone. Good job, o7 CMDR Krator
so the tl;dr from what we can gather from this video:  We'll have 'free movement' on foot everywhere . . . except inside our own ships...
Wow, Star Citizen features heavily in this design I see.
Spaceport walking around, confirmed?! :D
@4:05 So can we walk up that ramp into the ship? because if we can't this is all for naught.
WE. WANT. SHIP. INTERIORS.
dear developers, will we ever see the possibility of playing from a third person?
Right on, FDev!
Looks like not laggy\bugy\boring Star citizen.
Interior design lock like in Star citizen.
Give us ship interiors that's all i ask, and if the DLC is actually polished on launch ill buy it from steam and not 50% off on a 3rd party site.
You are copying Star Citizen  :-(
Очень хорошо поработали ребята спасибо за вашу работу по odyssey
OooOoOOoo cant wait
This looks brilliant! Nice work FDev!
How to kill GPU and CPU :) Get odyssey DLC and yea that's all when you run that game you get killed by your computer I don't have a lot money for new PC rig, to run this new part of the game anyway :D  I can run only Horizons :D
Please tell me I'm not the only one who saw the storefront areas and thought, "My name is Commander Shepard, and this is my favorite store on the Citadel."
I think if there was a third-person view of the ship, then more players would come into the game (even if using only auto-guided guns) ...
So a question I have:  For all of us that have customized the HUD colors and have to deal with tinted pictures of people, will we have to deal with a tinted color palette on a lot of on-foot assets?  Or will there finally be customizable colors built into the game so we don't have to edit .ini files anymore?
will console players be able to choice the name for there commanders
Даже не верится, мечты сбываются)
ok i'm in
Well, was nice to meet you, Robert. You just got outplayed by Frontier, and they didn't need hundreds of millions to do it.
Totally badass.
Hopefully this inspires CIG to get their Star Citizen act together a little sooner
So can we walk around in the our ships now??
now add some VR Support and the game will be perfect
FINALLY, I CAN REINSTALL THE GAME...
Can I be a bounty hunter
This looks great, but the sentence that really caught my attention was:  "Also a suit you might want to wear if you go scavenging, hunting through wrecks to find bits of equipment that might be useful to you........"  Wrecked ship interiors? Hmmmmm.......
very exciting.    please don't all the bases and stations look the same please don't all the bases and stations look the same please don't all the bases and stations look the same please don't all the bases and stations look the same please don't all the bases and stations look the same  ....
please, don't let me down  * crying *
The dev diaries are amazing! Love the interview style and sound!
Alright, I'm so ready to go on VTO on the next station I land on xD  The footage reminds me a lot of the Mass Effect games, really looking forward to that. (But please let me walk through my ship too? :3)
This is what I've been waiting for. Thank you, Frontier.
One of my favorite games ever. I hope this turns out well I've always wanted it to be like this in one of those people your doing this for. Thank you frontier. ❤😉
You guys are out of touch. People play elite to fly why go this far ? We can't even get up and walk around in the ship yet. That my friends is what should come first
This looks awesome!   I can't wait for it to drop.  Great work guys.  Time to show Star Citizen how it's done.  :)
The ED community is so divided but I'm just really happy that we're finally getting spacelegs!
These updates are very important to me. This one in particular shows that there is going to be more than just wandering barren planets, which is very good to hear.
Star Citizen, without the bugs?
The most interesting thing is whether we will steal someone else's spaceship or not :DDDDDD
Honestly that's more than what I expected
super hyped for this one
Am I reading too much into this or do those Military outfits look very um Star warsy and yes that is a word now I made it so it exists
From the way it was phrased, can you only disembark at specific locations or can I land anywhere and just get out?
I didn't notice any HUD changes. Not that anyone said they were planning on any changes, but I feel like it needed a refresh and was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. Luckily, everything else I've been seeing on these Dev Diaries is making me squeal with delight.
Please, please, please get rid of the wall of text communication in the ships. We should have full audio/video comms with NPC ships.
Kudos FDev team!! I had been tempering my expectations so hard to avoid getting over hyped and ultimately disappointed... but you've gone and done it, I'm so back on the hype train. Totally onboard. Let us know too that there have been some improvements to existing mechanics, e.g. a galmap filtering and bookmarking overhaul, and the backlog of existing issues.
I Hope This Time with VR Sli support ... i dont like 45 fps from reprojection
Well, that's looks an awful lot like star citizen.. can we get more of that?
Yes! This looks like progress. And an even bigger progress is, that you are showing white men. Just a representation of reality. Thumbs up!
OMG
Hope we can see some weather effects and VFX! Looking great so far Already wishlisted.
Do we have to wear a spacesuit? My T9 is called Malcolm Reynolds and now with settlements...I want to have a brown trenchcoat too!!!
It all looks so damn good, i just pray to all the Gods that you dont ruin it again in some weird way. We know you like to do that.
Variety and not making it too generic is the biggest hurdle.
PLEEEEEEEEASE Keep on the VR development. This looks so good!
I just started playing NMS and can honestly say it's just a watered-down arcadey version of Elite, but with some cool sandbox mechanics and awful ship combat/controls. Elite feels like the premium sim experience. NMS is still a fun game though, but doesn't hold a candle to Elite
❤
Where is mr. Braben? When we can walk in our ships?
HO HO HOOOOOOOO AAHHHH AHHHHHHA HA HA HA HAAAAAAAAAAA  AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
OMG Finally. I've been spamming DEV.DIARY.WHEN on every FB post they make for the last 2 weeks LMAO
Yeah, its all looking fantastic. But lets be real, we are all just waiting those new sound designs they talked about ;)
This looks absolutely INCREDIBLE
Star citizen on suicide watch after witnessing the bartender ai
you have created something truly wonderful.  please add the translations of the parts written in the various languages, including Italian.  thanks for everything.
We need a 3d model of Aisling Duval!
starcitizen is dead to me
Space legs on space ships please.
Outstanding!!!  This is starting to look like it was worth the wait, well played FDev
Simply jawdropping
Well it's been 6 plus years since I have you guys your last 👍. Let's keep the good news coming. Thank you.
This is interesting looking forward to it
The influence from Star Citizen looks pretty strong. Its good to see that all these space games are growing and becoming more ambitious. We are entering a new age of awesome space games and I am very excited to see where this ends up going. More freedom, more detail, bigger worlds, better games.
I can't wait. Please, say me where can i sleep for 2021?
In my humble, honest, puny opinion, of someone who barely has 20 hours in the game, i think that the only reason to get down from the ship and use some puny hand weapons would be to enter buildings or, most likely, underground facilities, where our big ass ship weapons cant shoot. Im really looking forward to this.
e STAR CITIZEN muto 🤫
GODDAMN!!
_"We want players to have the choice about how they play Elite. If players want to continue in their ship gameplay: Absolutely. If they want to engage in on-foot gameplay: Perfect. If they want to do both: Even better."_ - And if they want to play in VR for the full immersion: *Screw them.*  - _"It's not the game we're telling you how to play."_ - Except if you want to play in VR, that's not what we want you to do, so it's no longer supported.
When this comes out and works, I'll buy Arx equal to the base game cost
Yes! Yes! Yes yes yes yes yes yes! YESSSSSSS!
Oh this looks so good, I'm glad I've carried on playing and saved up some credits..... there's going to be alot of new stuff to buy and try ,  I'll have one of each suit please...
Nice
I’m a little bit confused on how pricing will work. With the amount of money we obtain how would we get player weapons and suits? Would they be considered cheap to buy?
This is gonna be awesome! :D
Mass Effect 4 is this you?...
I’ve always wanted to walk around Davs Hope to try a figure out what happened there. Can we go down the srv elevator? Will there be mining underground?
Yeah, they should have led with this one first.
Needs VR added to the update
Вот это реальная круть!)
Not being able to walk inside ships is still questionable. I would've put that first, and then moonwalking.
One thing a lot of people are missing.  A new past time in the making.    Load the game and go to a star port.  Walk to a good view of the landing pads.  Leave the computer and go get a nice drink.  Then just sit back and watch the ships takeoff and land.    Imagine a busy port in open play.  Trying to figure out what ones are npcs and what ones are commanders. The new commanders may be fairly obvious.  They are the ones bouncing off the walls on a sidewinder.

Look I am getting it not matter what but if one day I can have a bar on my FC I will be happy.....
Yesyesyesyes
Wow wow wow wow wow take my money!
Goosebumps!.
Why do I have bad vibes from this
F-Dev: *Bartender/AI that actually work.* CIG: *Nervously sweating.*
Yes. YES! It has been a long time coming, but it is all coming together.
Lovely. Really looking forward to it.
Can't wait.
But what about walking around inside our ships
I'm also wondering can you change your base suit at any time.
I will certainly buy thing and later come with my conclusion once i have paid for this very DLC, I'm truly praying for Frontier success on this one. This is getting VERY intersting :D.
Am I the only one who’s excited for the space taxi? :D
I'm so excited, you guys are doing an awesome job!
Cool, I didn’t know stations were included! I just hope we get ship interiors soon after
Wow !
A Big Yes Please... Because  that looks for me like dream come through.
Thanks a billion...Fdevs..u are the greatest.
Star Citizen fans on suicide watch.
Yoo. Actually hyped
I'm more interested in what the engine update/change will do for the game in comparison to what we have currently.  I already know it will be like Star Citisen.
Exactly what the community has been waiting and asking for in regards to Elite Feet, walking around stations and planetary locations. AMAZING Frontier and Elite Dangerous Odyssey team - can't wait to see and learn more!
"hell, it's about time"
Thank God. The added hope of TALKING NPCs !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes!!!   But Please, at least have them walking on the floor, Not 1ft off the ground.
Теперь с пыльными поселениями отыгрывать Мэла из Светлячка станет очень просто :>
Очень здорово выглядит!
Where is raxxla?
I hit the thumbs up. Then I removed it so that I could do it again.
Wow!!! This is much more than I expected. Absolutely fabulous Frontier well played. See you at the Bar!!!
YOU WANT MONEY? YOU NEED MONEY? LET ME PREORDER THIS FOR GODS SAKE ACCEPT MY MONEY I REALLY WANT TO GIVE  IT TO YOU JESUS CHRIST
This looks absolutely amazing! I can't belive spacelegs is actually happening!
Looking good, looking promising. From the age of vector graphics, to filled polygons, right up to the present. Elite over the years has come on leaps and bounds even though it's taken time. This new content in this release looks 5*. Well done Fdev and keep up the good work. Looking forward to release date 😁
Anyone noticed the subtle jab at other space games with that showing of the bar tender :) I see you Elite and I like it.
they should of opened the dev dairy with this i am feeling much better about the new DLC pack
I was just hyped to look at my Vulture in all of its glory. Y’all adding a new game to your game might be too much for me to handle. Thank you.
That was actually better than i expected.
O.0
Думаю если бы не Гражданин не скоро бы мы увидели Одиссею в Элитке. Ну а так Гражданин со своим дешевым космосом закончится не успев начаться.
Where the haters now
😍😍😍
Very nice!  Really looking forward to it!  😁
Not gonna lie, not walking in ship sucks. But what you're showing makes me feel tingly inside. Well done.
I just hope ship interiors, boarding enemy ships and space bar fights are a thing, oh and a thargoid stripclub.
Wow time to spend money on good game creators (learn from this small group developers *Star citizen* ) for real time to spend money on this game and on this guys (KEEP THE GREAT JOB) keep your life and soul in this great game just with a update like that everybody coming back to this game 💖💖💖💖💖😍😍😍😍😍
Looks awesome, cant wait. Just what this game needs and thank god for reducing that travel time sink !!!
Commanders, can i get a "Hell yeah!"
Ground vehicles should be next. We're going to need them for large items, and cargo.
ХАХАХАХАХАХАХАХАХАХАХАХА
fdev, my only wish, PLEASE make these missions worth while
Why no preorder?
Ship interiors please :(
Can’t even walk around my own ship smh
im gonna get so high and get lost walking around the planet and end up in the desert trying to call my ship back 🤷‍♂️
Very well done guys, now since everyone is asking, gives us the change to experience the "Neil Armstrong" moment from the cockpit all the way to the airlock. I think that without it, we'll miss the key part of that moment.
We’ve got guns.   Does that mean we can shoot pirates when in pirate bases or something? There’s no aliens, at least not on a massive scale, so what exactly is the function of the gun in this DLC?
wow! :)
this is amazing !!!!!  yes it's true, take my money!
I bet Obsidian Ant just did a little sex-wee.
OMG this is just awesome!! Thank you Fdev for making the dream reality!
Elite Dangerous and Star citizen, 2 Great game dont regret to have both !! :)
If you guys happen to need people to audition for npc voice i'll give it a go, no pay needed <3 just would love to add to the creation of this great universe that is Elite.
I just can't get rid of that voice whispering "Thargoids in the flesh" in the back of my head.
This is already looking better than Star Citizen to be honest.
Please implement multi-monitor support like in autosims
Much more interesting than the initial video.
It's is now clear to me as with little experience as  dev, that this mechanichs have been worked on for some time,  all of it, they probably didn't want the attention to it, in case they were unable to solve it in a short period of time, but it sure paid off, this looks FANTASTIC
I   want   to   land   on    Earth
I'm afraid Odyssey being full paid DLC kinda compromises the integrity of the experience as a whole. Not everyone will buy it, meaning it won't be an essential, fully integrated part of the game, just as Horizons is now. I never played without Horizons, but I can clearly tell where it begins and ends, just by playing. See what I mean? I fear that when you lift off on your ship and into space, all this "space legs" stuff will have absolutely no impact on the rest of the game.  Of course, I don't think you should develop it for free. Neither do I have any other solution to the problem, frankly. Still, it's pretty sad if it's gonna turn out like that.
Hey FDev, good job, this looks awesome, you should perhaps of led with this, you'd a got alot less flack...
Cool. I’m excited. “Story” though? For it to really be a player-made story there would need to be more player control of the environment, rather than “pick interaction A , B or C”  In terms of SIMULATION of story...the sounds and sights that make a place feel real and like something could happen.... I think that’s more likely going to be what we see. Which is cool ...really really cool... but not exactly a “story”.   Prove me wrong. Show us the depth. Will we be able to start fights at bars? Or maybe ...when we get a bad reputation it changes how a faction acts towards us? Can we steal stuff and try to elude security? Break into places? Plan smuggling meetings in a back rooms?   Or is this an elaborate interface for the same thing we have now: mission boards, commodity trading, etc.   Which don’t get me wrong would feel like an amazing extension to than what we have now...and the more you build out options the closer it really gets. Face to face meetings, clinking glasses, back rooms for black markets, secret hangers...etc.  I just don’t think “story” is the right word for it until we get enough options for what to choose to do. Maybe just “experience”.
Great, make Elite: Dangerous great again!
@1:10 they say we can disembark at outposts and spaceports, nothing about being able to land anywhere and just get out for a walk?
good work Frontier!!
Please, detailed interior ships!, I LOVE to walk around my type-6 :)
this is all of course superb, but we want to walk around our ships, go into outer space in a spacesuit.
Play Odyssey after you buy a proper Space Suit for 2billion Credits
gamechanger for Elite!
Can't wait to go harvest me some Thargoid Rinds in some close encounters!
Hype++ Excitement++
I know a lot of people are mad about no ship interiors, but I'm not that broken up about it mainly cause we're getting stations still. I'd rather that the hold off on ships until the have something that will make it unique and worth doing, and not something added just to appease the masses. Either way, Odyssey look phenomenal so far. o7
The game where you get to pick, said the guys who refuse to do ship balance passes, ignores piracy, lies about a crime and punishment update and never expands anything but punishment and tosses a throwaway line about stealing something before going onto the focus of the game now, pointless exploration of rocks and scanning things because they look pretty.  But yeah you're going to totally be able to walk around with other players in places from a game that can't even instance 4 people together half the time.  I can't wait for them to push out a half baked idea with no actual use and abandon it like every other feature they put in.
I am completely fine with this having been delayed, and certain aspects not being available at first. Get the mechanics right, and then add the extras.
Where scarab with rocket????
DOPE
Looks great 👍🏻.   Can’t wait to see more.
My hype for Odyssey went from meh to oh wow
Looks brilliant, I was concerned but this is exactly what I want, yes, walking on my ship would be nice but I can wait for that, walking in Space Ports was always a priority for me. I have one question though, will the content be as detailed for the Xbox1 as it is for the PC?  I obviously understand that graphically it won't be as good as a PC but as long as any actual content isn't missing then I'll be happy.  I am still waiting for my HUD colour to be customisable as it is on PC....
Looks great! Please let us walk in ships too, and add vr support for fps.
Can i assassinate someone by landing on 'em?
Can't comment until we see how involved, engaging and balanced the first person gameplay is.  But the risk is more new half baked simplistic bolt ons simply opening a whole new Eastern Front for FD to battle creating joined up mechanics for.
You just killed Star citizen
Neat.
Now thats what i want
TAKE MY MONEY!!
I think it looks great, I want you to continue. I am ready to buy updates of this kind every two or three years).
Cool!Чудово!Стар сітізен нервово гризе нігті)))
As someone who lived through the X Series' transition to in-person play, I really hope they don't make the off-ship experience too tedious. Seems it's going to be optional (the whole player choice part) which is good. I look forward to out of balance missions that everyone will soak up until they nerf them and half the population is pissed off. :)
Elite Dangerous is going to be Star Citizen before Star Citizen is Star Citizen
This is what I waited for too long, keep the good work!
I HAVE A BONER. After all those years of hope!!! It looks like a game of our dreams!!!!
Love it! So hyped!
All dislikes from SC players.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA[...]AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
I love how this is just a fat middle finger to star citizen
So much choice!  I choose to visit all the passengers I'm transporting...... oh wait..... Snark aside... This does actually make me feel slightly better about no ship interiors.... slightly.... If anything, being able to hear all the new sound design could be worth the price alone.
Good job FDevs. Very exited to see this in action. Walk safe o7
oh god  this is perfect
Right.. Forget interdictions.. Suddenly.. An alert pops up.. Your being boarded! Gameplay shifts to inside your ship! Their objective is to either steal Cargo.. Data.. Assassinate you.. A Passenger.. Install a virus .. The possibilities!
Question for piers, can we add :PiersChamp: to the Galactic academy?
AAAAMMMMAAAAZZZZIIIIIINNNNGGGG. BIG o7.
This sim does everything Star Citizen has been lying about doing for 8 years now. Elite Dangerous is an actual finished and playable game too, with an actual real size galaxy, where Star Citizen is just a tiny solar system with a single planet that has nothing on it.
I wonder what the player gunfights would be like
Well at least the npcs aren't standing on chairs and benches unlike that other game.
Hopefully, this will force Star Citizen devs to step up their game, and solve countless quality of life problems that existed in SC for years.
ED has a large game map, but 75% of it is empty barren planets and systems you can't even land on. Not to mention the graphics can't compare to SC and its gameplay already ingame.
It would be really cool to land on a burning station, run around gathering a crowd of people, and escort them to your ship as everything falls apart around you. The current rescue missions are just: land, gather people with a button press, then leave.
This looks so freaking amazing!! Rly looking forward to this.
RIP Star Citizen?
*о7 I'm happy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
Grind on foot. Sweet can’t wait
Oh look they even have a working bartender... :DDDD  1:54
I really hope they give me the opportunity to start squashing bugs in fps mode from the get go....starting to get tired of just popping the murder flowers...
Please let us at least walk around in the hangers on foot to get a sense of scale of the ships, and use the elevator/stairs on our ships
No VR support, no thanks. I will not be buying it.
ya this makes me happy
come on Frontier....this is the 2nd time! the 2nd freaking time you had to eat the duck up and release it early! are you kidding us??
Cross plateform ! Come on
Hyped hyped hyped hyped hyped hyped hyped hyped hyped hyped
Will we be able to interact with other commanders in these social places or only NPC's?
Great but still no ship insides
This is awesome!
I'm actually hyped for this
this made a bit tears in my eyes lol :)) i'm happy for ED
Good news. 😊 thnx.
So Can we walk around our Fleet Carriers?? cause ... i mean ... it is like 5b Cr lol
Star citizen Cya
what will we be able to do at abandoned stations? just visit them and take off? I mean, is there a purpose of visiting them? are we fighting against NPCs? are we collecting data from abandoned stations for some missions? are all stations different or do they have the same "pattern"?  I would like to know this in detail
TAKE MY MONEY AND LET ME PRE ORDER IT ALREADY IVE WASTED SIX YEARS ON THIS GAME I MIGHT AS WELL WASTE MY WHOLE LIFE ON IT NOW XD
The content described is really huge. I do understand that ship interiors offer less gameplay to the wider audience, but I hope that they'll make it into the game eventually. Exploring would be my prime target then. Right now I stick to the bubble and try to turn the wheel.
OMFG !!!!!! Hype !!!!
Finally catching upto star citizen  Now improve textures and graphics wth are those at 0:17
WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO WALK INSIDE SPACE STATIONS!
The Winterfox and Me are ready to go to Beagel point and take some samples. LETS DO THIS!
First thumbs up you guys have gotten off me in a very long time.
Good luck!
Oh so it's elite dangerous: the Star citizen update.
Shut up and take my money!!!
Star Citizen did this better.
If they make it all well done. I gonna build them a church!
pls - take my money FD/
i cant believe i beat fdev to the video release lmao
That's looking very good!  It feels lightly convergent with NMS in an odd way.  I love the idea and sound of the settlements.  Great job.
Iam more hype for this then Cyberpunk 2077 :D
Take my money now Frontier! :-)
I cannot wait for this :)
We've tried to maintain what we felt was a core part of Elite, which is freedom of choice. (As long as you don't chose to walk around your ship.) Too bad everybody's first choice is to walk around the ships they love. Knowing that everybody wants to walk around the ships, they decided to leave it out? WHY?     I am super hyped for this though!
Literally my first thought:  F***, I misclicked on the latest star citizen devlog
Hold on.... how am I gonna take a ship taxi with no interiors? I just pay the credits and appear at the destination outside of the ship?
Well, this really is something. Lokking better and better :)
Thank god!
Exploring/scavenging old wrecks? This sounds awesome
Song really good  i live it
First of all this looks dope af...that combat suit🔥
I haven't been torn by fear of dissapointment and joy of expectation as much...
I just peed myself. Sitting in the station and seeing player ships going in and out!  The Wild West outposts 🤠 !   Role specific suits 😱  The travel agency, fantastic idea.   I need to upgrade my hardware. .
Whould be nice not to forget deep space explorers as in what we find out in the black, hopefully some things you cant find in the bubble?
Looking good FDev.
Walking inside ship?
This looks great!
Delayed for 2022 new information soon!!!!
im literally vibrating violently rn I can't wait
All of this, and no VR support.  Very disappointing.
Please put the blue haired waifu in the game
This looks really good! Hopefully it will be engaging, although for plenty just getting out on foot and exploring will fulfill a wish. If this succeeds they can build on this :).
Woahhh wait a minute... SETTLEMENTS?! :D Walking around in STATIONS?! :D HAPPY EMOJI?!?! :D :D
Wow...
This is how many people want ship interiors  vvvvvvvvvv
Ok the real question is it is going to be another grinding update like horizon because intel now I'm just grinding or mining and it's take forever and I don't have all the time to do so. or some real playable update when we can explore the galaxy and have fun with some events
You guys made this one even HARDER to make a meme parody of. Good lord, you're mocking me at this point.
Fantastic work! Frontier!
Ehhhh gonna keep on being skeptical about this for the time being. But do carry on, I hope it ends up as good as you say it is. Having no ship interiors, not even a cockpit to walk around in, is still a bit of a disappointment
Goddamn. We were all afraid you'd only be able to walk on uninhabited desert planets. But man if we can actually walk around spaceports then I'm set.
Finally, now add manually boarding our ships and the experience, for me, will be complete.
I hope there is colour blind settings on console accessibility. Been waiting for years.
amazing
Epic!! Very much looking forward to it!
My Dream come true!! Next step walking on my Ship!!!
Star Citizen, pucker up because Elite is about to leave you in the dust. Well done Frontier. I can't wait to play this new content! :D
This is so 😎.  I can't wait and I hope full vr support don't take to long.
I would like to see Player to Player quests like i you give some money to a bank and give requirements and the other person has to do them to get the money
This is *INCREDIBLE*  - so hyped already. Fantastic job FDev.
Cant wait  :D
Can't wait!
Already seen it! :D And it wasn't here!
Might be time to dust off the cobwebs.. and start playing again
I kinda feel bad for Star Citizen players ;)
Wow... just wow...
Really Really Cool 🥰
Nice 👍🏽
Star Citizien dead after this update.
I love what I can see here! I just want to exist in these spaces as a person and experience this new perspective
So it's not going to be a star citizen experience (yet), but more of a no men sky experience.
Great! But what about if we merge ED to SC? It looks so similar to SC now! Which for me, is a BIG GOOD THING! :)
SPACE LEGS
00:52 Darth Vader inspired suits lmao
Cool. Looking forward to walk around and have a drink with the mates.
We've tried to maintain the core aspects of Elite, which is fade to black cutscenes and no walking around in ships, so you shouldn't bother with this expansion, it's just as half assed as Muticrew and Power Play.
Will we be able to explore the inside of our ships or is it just the outside of our ship?
Actually second lol great vid tho
SPACE APRONS
YOOO this actually looks awesome, hype af
Finally!
Looks so good guys
My hope for oddysey is keeping from getting bored and deleting it.
personal narative
OOHJOOHHOHOOHOHHOHOHOHO
woah, i thought this was coming tomorrow
Powwwww!
5000th
OMGGG im so hypeeeed
Odyssey is my last hope for this game
Actually first
First lol
Boom
Ooh
