That rotisserie seems to come in handy during initial assembly 👍👍👍👍👍
Thanks for the ❤😊
Is it 4 link front or 3 link with panhard bar?
👋🏾 ED!
goat
Claw hammer. AAAAaaaaaaaHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!
To me those rear shocks don't seem to be robust enough for the application.  Shows how much I know.  :D
The rotisserie send off tho… perfect.
If I was going to Mars I would want to take the Morvair.
You guys do incredible work! Great fabrication by all of you
Nice.
13:13 When I worked Fast Food in HS we would watch for buses pulling up.  So you probably gave the restaurant a heart attack when you drove up and then a let down when only 15 or so of you got off.
Thanks for sharing 👍😀
What steering wheel did you use on the Morrvair?
the bed liner material/paint changed the gap on the mounting bracket......i think :~)
I absolutely love your show. Matt, I missed the name of the Fab channel of the guy you were apologizing to for your fab techniques
I think it’s appropriate that Matt is wearing the old Winders shirts during the fabrication plus the MOOR ball caps!
The Rotisserie bit was very funny!
I really don’t like the steering wheel, and it speaks volumes about the project, that it is the only point I the build I dislike, so 99.3 perfect is more then pretty good!
Hey Matt @2:50 you talk about the Toyota steering box...  Did I see a latter video where you decided to use a different one out of a Nissan?  If so... what did you in up going with?
Never trusted undercoating but then again I live in the salt belt so seeing that peel off and not be completely stuck down does not help 😂
Whoever did the editing on these old videos was way better than whoever does it now.
Nice job
That's some really chunky serious suspension in there . Looking good.
It looks really really good I can't wait till it's on the road on the trail that is
It looks really really good I can't wait till it's on the road on the trail that is
Build a car for himself, how great is this. In Germany is thins not thinkable. Thanks for this video
just watched this, ... you didn't JUNK the BBQ thingy right ???   :-/
A giant banana!!! John has a jem
Go Trevor! Without you this rig will not go anywhere. Once he starts a job there is no stopping him. Looks like spaghetti to me. Now that looked like some real fun spinning around. This is looking better and better all the time as Morrvair comes together. Things are getting exciting now. Can hardly wait for the test run.
Matt!!!! You should have Robbie paint the door handles black on the Banana
Thats an awesome ride and I love the recovery videos.
Matt, you are a roofer right?  I am so impressed
This is America.
This is just fascinating!  Thank you.
Oh my gosh!  I finally figured out the  “Morrvair” Name for the vehicle. Cool!
Moorvair coming along good here! Hope you didn't have food coma after big lunch, courtesy Jamie. Still have work to do! Much ❤️, 👍😎💪🇺🇸🙏⚓
Trevor, I would love to have you as my neighbor!  But this applies to everyone of you folks! Good stuff!
I never get tired of watching you guys!!!
The assembly manual is in your head. Years of knuckle bustin.
I thought of a use of the rotiseree, when you build the next corvair, use it as a jig for your wish bone brackets, weld them in place. Jim las vegas nv
15:25 In Livonia Michigan we got sent machines from Mexico to repair for GM that had 50,000 psi tanks. Before we could disassemble them a bomb squad raided our shop. Cleared 5 blocks before dismantling them. Our government considers anything above 35,000 psi, a bomb. Think about that next time you're passing an 18-wheeler on the interstate. Mexico to Michigan. I unloaded all 9 of them with a forklift........
Very interesting,  the videography was excellent.
what relationship is tnhere between liz and matt
Your four link bars look about the same size as the stock driveline from my V8 Maverick!
If Matt needs to take this to the car dealership for repairs, where does he go?
😆The tribute to the rotisserie got me right in the feels😢😆
nice to see everyone got to be part of the build
“I AM THE ASSEMBLY MANUAL “ 😂😂😂😂
😁Dirt Lifestyle is my other favorite channel!
Your shop is too clean, you disgust me.
Ahh I love the pumpkin
Awesome 👌
I remember when Rudy asked if we could build a truck without a measuring tape. I guess the answer is no.
👍
Never mentioned engine size.5.3?
I love this thing!!
Watching you completely take it apart and then put it back together reminds me of when I assisted a friend taking apart a Willy's Jeep as far as you took your vehicle down.
Awesome build! Nicely done to all involved.
Love watching the build. I wonder though - does Matt own a Ball Peen hammer? All I ever see is a claw hammer.
😎👍
name of the music please anyone ?????
I Must Have Missed Something, From No Engine To Engine Installed. WHAT Engine Did He Use?
Lmao!  The sad farewell music made me laugh so hard. I needed this after all the bad stuff that’s been happening lately. Thanks, this right here has pulled me out of a dark place. Matt, Rudy and Trevor you guys are awesome.
Trevor is a good man.
I'm watching ALL episodes one by one! This project is just woow
This is really cool. Thanks for sharing.
This was a really great episode, as the Corvair was on her own feet.
What happens to all the people getting stuck while this is being built?
Chicken burrito 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
True story! When Matt started speaking I was looking at Rudy, and the more he  said, I quickly realized that Rudy was lip-syncing and doing one hell of a job at it. Turns out it WAS NOT MATT! There is a true apples/apples story here! Looking real good, guys, I'm proud for you.
pretty sure we havn't seen the last of that rotisserie
So much fun watching you guys all work together! Amazing skills all the way around! Thanks for sharing! Next time I’m in Hurricane, I’m going to come say hello.
The "Farewell to Rotisserie" had me actually" laughing out loud" and yet I still felt sad at the same time... Emmy Award material right there‼️
I love your Channel. I really wish my brother was still alive...he would love you guys! He was a car guy. Built things from scratch.  Rebuilt classics...like my 1970 Plymouth sport fury. A 1977 Chrysler new Yorker 2 door...took two and made one.  He was the guy who rescued (what you call recovered) everyone who did stupid stuff and stuck in the mud and woods. Only difference...no cuss words and flying tools in your shop! Lol Thanks for these videos. Love y'all!
Name it the Yellow Iguana
you team looks like its so much fun to be a part of! i wish there were more people like you in the world
badass rig
MATT  the man who is very much egocentric,  he never return a comment or exchange any idea  because he is the "chef" sad because without that the serial would be so much more enjoyable ------ but it is sadly not the case !
Love the Bus John !!! I converted a very similar bus. ( schutzengel skoolie )
How many Vehicles does Matt have
Check out the view at 3:15 who's leanin' against the lift.  Woo wee!!!
Great job , nice truck !!!!
The Canary Corvair!💛 (Per Trevor)
"Darn Skippy...." indeed!  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That's a sweet build👀👏BOOM!
The nice sugar correlatively whistle because maraca structurally plug as a young lute. wonderful, decisive quill
More of these videossss
How did you do the fender flares? They look similar to the ones on the Yellow Banana..
I really appreciate your bills and your conversations you guys are not cussing like some people do thanks
Can you post info on axles (front & rear), transfer case, gear-ratio? Were the link tabs (1/4" thick?) bought from suppliers? What suppliers did you use for the links (tubes & ends)? Did you use link calculator to set things up front & rear? It's a 4-link rear, 3-link front? What rear coils did you use?  What do you expect the overall weight to be?
I like those hats yall got.
Probably could have built a kick ass Cherokee faster, but that is looking pretty awesome
You already got a banana,  is this one the  " punkin "
That tribute segment was so moving.
5 minute drive to the Costa Vida :)
I think Trevor just named it... The Yellow Canary! You know, beacuse its tiny and yellow like a canary ...
In the video when you were installing the front suspension. You kept calling them "Ories." They are O.R.I.'s like the individual letters, not a word. They are really bad add. BTW, the make a reservoir O.R.I. as well and it adds 3 stages of damping. It makes them perform like a 5 way By-pass with internal bump stop. They also make an upgrade kit to add the reservoir to the regular model. If I were you, I would do the O.R.I. struts in the rear as well, and when you do the upper mounts do them up higher so you can run a longer version. You want to run them at 50% of the stroke when it's just sitting there. So it can go up or down the same amount of travel. You don't need the reservoir version unless you plan to go hitting the whoops and really going out and rallying it. If you are then I would definitely do the reservoir front and rear cause not only do they keep the oil separated from the nitrogen,  but the reservoir adds 2 more stages to the dampening for a total of 5 stages! They act like a coilover, reservoir shock, 5way bypass shock, sway bar, limit straps and bump stop all in one unit!  Anyway, awesome build man! Can't wait to see the videos of you out wheeling it!
Sweet.
Cool.
Great video.
You should spray in some LizardSkin sound deadening coating on the passenger compartment walls.
MATT OR RUDY!!! Was wondering if either of you had ever pondered having a roof rack on your corvair build that you could place camera mounts.. having so much success with U-Tube videos,,,permanently having quick release mounts might expedite capturing video... Just a thought!!! Your fan Tc from Nevada
Woah... They let you all go into that restaurant without masks?
nice masks
Matt struggles to remember the ferrule nut before flaring the tubing, I feel for ya, don't know how many times I've soldered a wire connection only to realize I've forgotten the shrink tubing,  Doh!
I love the new wagon build. I get so excited everytime u upload a new video bout it. Can't wait to see its first recovery
Man, I love your video's, but quit trying to pay for all of your projects with ad's, you have increased them to amount where myself, and others will find a different channel to watch instead
With all your video and really enjoy, but it's hard to see the no masks in a public fast food restaurant.
@ 7:22  does your ‘eyechrometer’ need calibrating at the opticians? 😊
🙏🙏👍👍
had I know this was an ls when youtube recommended it
Did this Yank Tank get named officially yet?  Love the build.
I have Never been impressed by a Corvair, I have seen some decent ones, but you guys have the coolest one By Far. In a car show, I would stop and give extra attention to the on y'all built, but to see one doing recovery, and being used.... stop the bus, I just soiled my Jean's! Great Job, you nailed this build in every way, and deserve more then what's coming! And to add, you are using demo derby stuff, as proof of toughness, Y'all just had a grade school kid dunk on Shaq, kinda moment....LMAO
Mattracks:  they would be good for snow and that brown powder you call sand (holy crap that stuff is bad where you are) have you given them any thought? probably can't use them on the road legally and they cost way too much money. I bet Fab Rats can make their own Matt - Tracks :)
So, where was I when Jamie bought lunch??
Great job guys!!! Love the channel!!
Wow guys, that is amazing!  It’s crazy how it looks like a Cherokee at this point.  The sad rotisserie death had me laughing!  Can’t wait to see this thing finished and on the trails!
Matt, at the end you said "I just have to do the steering really quick" , is it going to have "Quick Steering"?  Seems like Quick steering might be desirable on a recovery rig when you get into tight spaces.
Opps Driving the school bus w/o a seat belt. shame. like the trailer w/o safety chains  or being crossed for safety sake.. guys are slipping..
Will this be licensed for street use or will it be trailered to recovery jobs? Anything special need to be done to get it certified for road use?
I'm not in the recovery business, but it seems to me, if you can't afford to give away more than 1 shirt, then you probably aren't charging enough.
Man this thing has came a long way... it’s gonna be so sweet 😍
I hope you didn't pay for that "rattle trap" stuff.  It's so incredibly over priced!  Just get the exact same thing at Home Depot for 1/10th the price.
This was on a plaque mounted on the dash of a 1941 willys jeep I grew up on. (Das machine is nicht fur gefingerpoken und mittengrabben.  Ist easy schnappen der springenwerk, blowenfusen und corkenpoppen mit spitzensparken.  Ist nicht fur gewerken by das dummkopfen.  Das rubbernecken sightseeren keepen hands in das pockets.  Relaxen und vatch das blinkenlights!!! )
I find even more ads on the newer vids compared to the older ones. Two maybe three would be okay, but 4 + in a 18 minute video is pushing it. You have good content but whiling to un-subscribe to avoid ads.
Looking good 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🏁🏁🏁🤠
Are you putting a lot of bucks onto something that  won’t  be big enough or high enough or strong enough for tough recovery work.?  Like why nor rebuild g an old Ford 350.  Something already big, and bad.    JoeB
What I wanna know is who are the 233 negative yahoo's! :)
That rotisserie has been a brilliant aid in the birth of this awesome truck 😎
Very beatiful
Can't wait to see what kind of flex you get our of it great progress 👏
Is the sticky heat shield water proof?
So rudy is dual citizenship but mat isnt but he said matts his dad a few times?  Im confused, i have seen most of the vids for about 6 months now but im lost? Somome clarify please
wen hop?
its amazing, you designed and built a vehicle from parts and knowledge. i can't wait to see this thing doing recoveries.
You don’t know your in the good times till it’s over
looking good bros
Have you guys ate at the Pigs Ear in Hurricane.. love there food.
That sound deadening material goes on the inside.
I may have someone build just the body and wiring of a classic c10 or I'm in between that or like an 02' model camera and then throw the motor, trans, axels and all that jazz in myself. If it's built correctly there should be no issue getting my LS3 in there and my $2,000 focal system with a little customizing I think it'll all fit.
No masks yikes
Are y'all building a "Corvair  Tank"?
mekanik
How exciting!  This has been great fun watching this winter. To bad I wasn't out in the shop working on my own stuff...LOL
Guess you guys don’t think you have to follow Utah’s mask mandate.
Is it a Corvair station wagon that's lifted to be a truck with truck suspension? Corvair trucks don't exist, right?
Why not portal axels?
Lookin good
Had to watch this one again. I'm a Ford guy and not an off road guy, but I am loving this build. Can't wait to see her put to work and/or play.
Ooh man this truck is so nice! Love watch the videos!!
Omg Matt head of the Bolt goes out and the nut goes on the inside on the four link bars !,,,,,
Blood, sweat, tears and time, lost sleep and a pretty good pile of money.  Anyone could do this.
Well at least the bus is the right color.
Ha...  I just flared the same brake line TWICE without putting the fitting on first the other day.
wow that is looking great sitting on the wheels  keep up the great work
You need Edd out in the shop with a weather forecast.
Matt its coming togather yal stay ssfe ! Daniel from central Mississippi
Looking Good !
Going to be a beast !!!!!!!!!
I really enjoying watching this build, it is somewhat of a lost art in this day and age
5:31 WTH?!?!?! *FULL SCREEN*
The Corvair build looks great. I really enjoy watching you guys build stuff.  it is pretty fun
Nice pumpkin.  Anybody on project cost?
Hoping you are putting beadlocks on to begin with. Also accessory cooling system.
Like the jack-o-lantern pumpkin.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👍
Watching this from scratch was amazing how far you guys have came 🔥
Looking good!   Love the bus ride too 😂
Can't wait to see it finished and running ..great job ya all godbless and stay safe
WOW, She is looking beautiful!
I absolutely love the Corvair build and have been following since the beginning. Congrats on getting it to this point.
So much fun watching this build!
Really nice build.
In the early 70's, I rode to school in mom's '62 Lakewood wagon (when it would start). When she could finally afford a new car she gave the old 'Vair to the neighbor that had kept it together with duct tape and bailing wire. He cut the body off, welded a crude cage in place and turned the kids loose in it.  This thing is beautiful.
hey, nice to see you guys playing Pétanque , didn't know you were so French :P
Would be cool If you did the first recovery with this for free. That would start it off with good karma.
Looking good guys, I can't wait to see it on the trails
Man the corvair looks SO GOOOOOD!
"I am the manual" made me laugh.  Great content guys.  I'm hooked!
m not sure , if we all totally grasp the gravity of the situation. They built a car!!!  a car!!!!!!
The sound and heat deadener belongs on the interior side of the floor. It’s not going to last on the exterior and defeats the purpose of your liner coating. Loving this build though!
Hey guys, great build. I love it :)
500,000 dead. It's apparently too much sacrifice to ask for Matt and his buddies to wear masks, though.
The world is proud to flared that first try matt good job. I always go for 2 trys 😄
i can see mat getting mad when his tire keeps popping off the bead already
That convair rocks...i like it's looks
Damn dude that thing is looking like a beast
Lol I get bronco ads before ur vids start now
That pumpkin XD
Now you gotta build rudy one
Looking fantastic, see y'all soon!;)
I've never seen sound deadening and insulation installed on the OUTSIDE of the body
That thing is SICK! Maybe I'll see it on the dunes when I head down there in a few weeks?
sweeet...  fun to see things hit major milestones.... keep it up
Matt: I should have listened to Rudy. Rudy: I AM the assembly manual.
Looking better every time yall work on it..
Fantastic Engineering  - Wish my Corvair had that engine and lift kit in 1960
Lookin good.
sick asf
**TY JAMIE!!!!**
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but sound deadening goes under the rug. You’re doing a real nice job though. Always liked the looks of the old Corvairs but not the mechanical
PLEASE NOTE: WHEN I DO MY CARS =  **I INSULATE ON THE INSIDE OF THE CARS = not the outside!!!**
read all first   Hi Paul my name is Dale Polmanter I'm from Canada Edmonton Alberta to be exact I watch a lot of your fabrication shows and I'm very interested in what you do so I have a question but in order for the question to be answered I would like you and Matt both to be present an both to give an answer on this question seems usable fabricators and here's my question I have a 2002 Dodge Durango 5.9 r/t  and it has a normal typical Dodge Durango's front end underneath it I'm not very happy with it I'm not very happy with the way that it works so I would like you both to give me an idea of what front end to put underneath the Dodge Durango with a set of 391 gear ratios front and rear and yes I have already considered having the lockers put into the outer hubs and yes I'm very much considering the heim joints and link suspensions that I have seen use put together quite a few times as of now within your fabrications so im very comfortable in putting that together myself and just so that you have the full perspective of where I'm heading with this I would like to eventually at some point take the 5.9 out of at and put in a hemi
Got a name for it yet? How about Yankenstein?
Why do mechanics need hi vis shirts? I'm guessing the uniform rep is cashing in with these guys.
Hey Matt, I was at your shop in December.   Today I stripped down a penal hitch and rebuilt it. I put on a two inch ball rated at 10,000 pounds.  I’m sending it hopefully this week. I’m painting it smoke gray and yellow. Hopefully it matches the Corvair or the banana. I took a pic of the Jeep but it’s hard to match off of a picture.  Hope it works for you. My name on YouTube is Kenneth but I use my middle name, Wayne. I’m from LakeArrowhead, CA Love your channel. Months ago I suggested you switch your trailer to a penal hitch. Keep up the good work.
holy shit! you made a Corvair badass!  i never thought....
And Matt says “ I should have listened to Rudy” 😂 Well he seems like a smart young man, mom and dad obviously did their part.
All that work for a cheap set of bilstiens??
where's does the mount for the flag go ?
All of you are a great team. It’s fun to watch you get it all done.
Are you about ready for SEMA in Vegas.
Matt your not driving nails in  a house anymore get a ball peen for driving bolts hehe. Thx for taking us along.
that penny cost her like $70
Looking good
Damn Matt, this is really turning out to be a slick and unique build!
did you put spring isolators in
That MJ video on Instagram 😂😂😂
I think the Corvair would look great if the rocker panels were yellow too!
Why doesn’t your crew wear masks?
Jaime should have just dropped that coin on the floor in front of her feet. LOL!!!! Small Salad...
Fun to watch. Thanks!
Is that  a Vortech V6?
I hate to say it but you should have had that bedliner stripped out and started over. The Company that did it should have stopped and started over. Now it’s going to be a nightmare. I’ve done body work all my life and i would never had let that thing leave my shop like that .
Looking good 👍
Looks real good, curious how much it will weigh, maybe a " guess the Corvairs weight"  for a Matts Recovery Rope contest is in order?!!??
Love the shout out to Nate! LOL
is that unibody?
Ill be in town this week can I come get a weather report from Ed?
I call it the        (TOWVAIR)
How come the sound detonation material put underneath instead of inside the cab ?
Who's responsible for the scratches in the grey paint above Matt's forearm  @ 3:05 ?
Y'all are kicking some butt!!! Great job!
This thing is awesome! Great job. Much love to you all, and your channel.
Hurry up I want to see it flex
You just have to keep playing that annoying music don't you?
The build is looking fantastic
Can't get enough of this build
Jamie's buying, so does that mean Matts buying too? lol
Sweet YAAAAAAAAAA nice.
It's refreshing to see someone use a hammer for hammering...
@10:57 God I've forgotten to put the fitting on the brake line, too lol. I've also REMEMBERED, but then bent the line and trapped the fitting in the middle of the line.... it's so frustrating!
the corvair is now TOOTED
Yeah, gotta work on those whoohoos.
Very enjoyable watch! Love to watch a build come together. Did you truckbed/line-x the undercarriage? I'm assuming that's some time of bedliner/waterproof for the undercarriage? Raptorline? I wonder how long it will last if it's constantly getting soaked.
I can’t wait to see this on the trails.
Wow even Matt is using sound deadening..!! I never thought that's a big deal. Wonder how much would it cost if a shop does the job. Or even better if I could know how much would it cost for a 4Runner.. :-) :-)
Such big insulation pieces, this project is getting heavy real quick. It looks awesome
Awesome looks great!!
Amazing Matt and team! Can't wait to see the final product! And I love the canary color!
Rudy it’s time for a extreme build for you, whence you finish dads ride!
I would use the gold heat tape under that heat shield.
U Darn Skippy!  🤠
You're gonna need another side project when this is done. It's been awesome seeing this happen. There's A lot of knowledge in that shop. Inspiring
Awesome build mat it's a  banana  on steroids
Love your work Matt but please stop using a claw hammer in the garage working on the corvair . Claw hammers are for framing not drifting bolts  Annoys the hell out of me
Can't wait to see this in action. Will the Super duty retire and have the corvair tow the banana for difficult recoveries? You guys are doing an awesome job  insta; @discovery_badger
aye, let me get that rotisserie haha
Measure once, cuss twice.
Does covid just not exist 4 u guys
At 11:00 when you describe the common mistake of flaring before sliding on the flare nut, well... I am so talented that I can't count how many times I made that mistake twice in a row.  LOL
Anyone know what motor they put in there? I haven’t been following too long. An 8.1 vortec would be stellar.
Disappointed you guys didn't wear your masks at least when ordering your food...have some respect for the workers at  that restaurant who have to be there to serve you.
Great running into you at Zion!
Run a bead of black adhesive silicone around the edge of all that heat shielding fabric and between the pieces.  Smooth it like you do household caulking and then water cannot get between the fabric and the metal so it will stay attached.   Otherwise the channels in the undercoating will just get filled with water and separate everything.
Jamie keepin' the troops fed :-)
B n. N b. B n n.
So why stainless steel heat shields? As far as I am aware, stainless steel traps and keeps heat, where as aluminum disperses heat and much better material as a heat shield.
All 0f that work, prepping and painting, picking great colors and whatnot........and you put a green transmission in it.
Please paint the "🎃" black or yellow
Nice ride👌🏻, almost to nice to take off-roading
I want to see the bus/rv build
Hey Matt, it starts too look like a yellow car. Nice work! Greatings from Norway. I'm waiting to see this car running the sand dunes.
Mile stones have been passed!
Number 40 on Trending! Congrats to the MORR crew.
I do not get it.   so you built this thing all beautiful and showcar      Are you going to take it fourwheeling? Do you think if you make it perfect and beautiful enough it will be impossible to wind up upsidedown at the bottom of a  ravine??
So, who wants to tell Matt sound deadening goes on the inside..?
I enjoy watching
He mentions name's channel but im not seeing a link in the description, can anyone help me out on the name of the channel
Great video, but sure could do without that yuppie music...that is nerve wracking and doesn't go with a manly built automobile!
Great Job!!
Rotisserie RIP: Laughed so hard at that edit! This build is getting more and more amazing at every episode. Can't wait to see it in action.
Oh yeah...🤤gittin there....😎.....and lunch to...😳😉😂...!!
One amazing build, great job all.
You will use the rotisserie again for a next project. Matt has thought carefully about how he wants the RECO, soundproofing, heat shields, etc .....
think my dad would of love this this build he like the corvair car some not no this the automatic corvair if you drop it in low you can push start the car with another car that one good thing about there transmission
Kinda like watching paint dry but I can't take my eyes off the build.  GREAT job to the team.  The Yellow Canary is a giant step closer to being done! !! !!!
Would've thought you'd use a spud wrench to align some of those holes.
Its looking mean!!
Too COOL!!
Whoa made it to trending
I think i was as stoked as Matt & Co. when it was sitting on it's axles at the end. Way to go guys!
Matt's intro, well watch us work... Isn't that why you started these vids? I can't wait to see that thing do it's first recovery, perform in sand/snow.   Should be a beast!
My favorite show!
TRENDING! you've made it!
That is a seriously impressive build
Is this vechile going to become the new rescue vechile when complete?
(Matt) put a bead of sealant around your rattle trap to make sure anything leaking can't get under it and cause it to lift.
Hey I could use a rotisserie... what you think shipping to Kentucky would be? Should be reasonable right?
I m in awe.
It is, was brand new. hahahaha
Guys that sound deadener definitely need to be on the inside, Have you seen what happens to the  butyl black stuff when it comes in to contact with petroleum products? it turns super soft almost like peanut butter. Do a test for yourself! BTW been enjoying this series!
looking awesome!!!
so happy for you man! it's back on its wheels. I know the feeling it's the best. now all the little things! cool video keep up the great work!!!
Trending page! Congrats guys !!!
I love it. U should bring it to sema  .im very impressed w the design👍🏻🇺🇸
Send us to Mars..  lol rudy ... good one
Who would have thought a corvair wagon could look so cool.
Love your videos!! Hate the 40 commercials per episode.
Wow...this is the coolest build on youtube.  Form AND functionality.
Looking good!
Can't wait to see it on the road. Great job guys. 😁😎
Looking mighty fine there Fellars
Ralph Nader eat your heart out. Hehe
This machine is going to be wicked
Are you keeping track of the $ you put into the build as well as the man hours? I’d like to see how much it cost to custom build a vehicle like this, both in materials and man hours to converted to salary.
Did you put recovery points on the Corvair? Or are you assuming the vehicle will never need to be recovered?
Some awesome stuff right there. Weird how I’m excited for you guys. Great build guys.
Did someone say PENNY CAN?
Love it but don't let xj go
I love the laughter at the end like you were doubting yourself the whole way through the build lol
👍👍👍
Hey this is 39 on trending 😍
Dude! this is such a cool build.
Ok im already starting to book my Californian rental to get stuck for this :D
Sound deadening is god mode go to town you'll never regret it
" The canary " i like the sound of that.  The banana and the canary!!!!!
I watch a few different car channels (Samcrac, Rich Rebuilds, Vtuned), this is by far my favorite build. You guys have built this out of almost nothing. Of course I watch all your other videos too. Keep doing what you're doing! Very entertaining and educational.
Hopefully I get to see it in action in May when I go back to to sand hollow . One more thing what was the name of the restaurant you guys ate at . So I can try it out.
It's looking SO EPIC!!!
1:15 Elon musk, cavemen
Wow is the word, it's looking great.
You guys going to stick a bit of a roll cage ( if there is space) inside because I think it will fold flat as a pancake if it went over nice build thanks
That Awesome !! Can't wait for the first recovery !!!
Awesome project. !!!
Can't wait to see its first  recovery  ,
Yall not wearing masks inside of the restaurant? Really? Yikes. Shows how little you care about minimum wage workers.
So are ya taking it on ultimate adventure?
Yall don't have covid in Utah? Why no masks in the restaurant
Awesome 👏!
Looks like you guys are having a lot of fun, good for you. Can't wait to see the Corvair run. Will have a front and rear winch?
Hi Matt please don’t put your mobile phones in your breast pockets - we had a farmer here in Australia that did while he rode around the farm every day and got breast cancer - we love you and want to keep you safe xxx
Such a cool Car!!! You do a graet Job !!! But you never use a bit of Grease if you turn a Bolt in a Hole .....Wy ????????
I can’t wait to see it in use 😭
🎉
"Go home Trevor" should have been the name of this video.
Beast
Great enthusiasm :) LOL
Love it can't wait to see it run, super exciting.
Matt don’t forget the paint the front like you did the rear DIf pumpkin
you know what would have been cool? building a Jeep Wrangler JL.
It’s to the moon... Doge
Forgot to ask....Are you putting ''lockers'' on it?  or an LSD?   as when in the snow, the banana, went no where. 1 wheel lifted, and you're stuck son!! lol
Are you not also struggling with overheated motor? What about installing a system to create a water mist in front of the radiator to help in cooling down the engine on hot days?
I hope you guys wire up some good Leds on it.  That'll help with those dark recoveries.
John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
OMG, I can't wait to see this rig completed and in action! It looks sweet and mean at the same time!
Farewell rotisserie,  until we build another awesome car, truck, spacecraft, Tonka truck for ??????...........SO!!  Break it down?? Or KEEP it!?.....................
Come on Matt, use that YouTube money!  💰
I don't know if you have a plan for the front gas filler hole... but your should make it a custom filler for the windshield cleaner fluid or a custom filler for a massive coolant reservoir??? That would be so cool. Love the build and your goofy crew <3
MATT, HI, I CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS ON A TEST RUN, Then the real thing , looking good  cheers 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Can't wait for this to be doing some rescue's or dare I say it, "Get Stuck!"
Nate is great!
I find it quite odd how they aren't using washers under the majority of the chassis/suspension bolts shown in this video.
Dave Sward Very nice !!! But I still think you should have used a 1958 Hudson wagon...
So is a coe flatbed next on the build list?
Nice milling Machine. I see that in the back
Matt calculating looks like Matt is buffering....
I seriously only open youtube to check for updates on the corvair
That’s gonna look awesome.... it looks good now as it is.
The build has been fascinating to watch, and those beards have been growing throughout the whole build. Love watching you all with your teamwork.
So that's what happened to the 62!?  I like it!    Still regret not buying that Rampy from you haha.  I have an FJ62 I have been putting a lot of work into these days, still have my 61 sedan 4.3 conversion though.
I loved, goodbye to rotisserie!
Sweet !!! Looks Crazy Nice
That rotisserie montage  🤣🤣🤣🤣
looking good.. cant wait to see it on the trails
Looks bad ass, greetings from Mexico.
Nice work!!
Coming along just fine! Gonna be a weapon for sure! Look out sand hollow! 🇦🇺🍺🍺🍺
It’s coming right along. Looks great so far.
We shall always treasure the time we had with the rotisserie in our hearts. RIP, rotisserie, and may you forever frolick in metal heaven.
Would if u brought it to a show. Sema? Am I stupid for saying this. But that would be pretty cool
Honestly so happy this made it to trending you guys makes awesome videos that always make me smile so congrats guys
build is coming along great guys! amazing work
looks frickin awesome
That reflectix is not durable at all and not heat rated.  We use them inside our carpet cleaning trucks
_2:40__ "You had all night to think of something to say."_
Well done waiting for first drive
those ORI shocks...amazing!
I can't believe the thumbs down. How can anyone that's seen how much work you guys have put into this do that? I can't wait to see it hit the scale, and hit the road! I haven't heard Matt take a guess at the finished weight in a while.
Sick !!!
I know commercials mean monetization, but the videos have too many now.
The Mattmobile is looking really good!  And should soon be setting new trends for off road style and durability!
About time to stop calling this thing a Corvair.
Looking real good! I like that ride height. Can't wait to see you flex it all the way out!!!
Do not underestimate the power of a raging bull, and the strength of a bear in stock market. Both have the power to trample you to death if you fight against them.
Should take it to SEMA!
I think you should contact motor trend t.v. About this build. This is the most honest build by real everyday people who made a few mistakes along the way but stuck to it and got it done.
You all have brought it so far. From a concept in your head to a realization...it's an awesome family & friends build... It won't be long now and it'll be out on the trails... Can't wait to see you, Paul, Pappa Darr & the whole family out on the trails this summer in your all's builds...😁👍  And I'm sure Nate understands that your going to be working the tar out of it so it doesn't have to have flawless fabing, it's not a sema build after all. That being said...I think you all have fabed everything awesomely & my hat's off to you all 😁👍  And to all my wheel'n brothers and sisters out there... Keep the tires aimed towards the ground and all eyes upon the Lord....👍
pumpkin graphic on the diff .. pumpkin.  nice  17:33
Dang. She’s a sexy beast now.
Congratulations on getting her on her wheels! Great looking ride and one hell of a build crew!
This video really made my day, thank you guys for such an amazing video
What background piano music was the one played for the  “rotisserie” farewell? That was epic guys!!! 😂
The good thing about that undercoating is that nothing sticks to it. The bad thing about that undercoating is that nothing sticks to it.     You'll see.  PS, love the claw hammer!
DMC has entered the chat. Those stick ons are going to fail. If they don't, you're going to have rust behind.  Sweet random  4x4 as it is. May I suggest a 4x4 Eagle or a Audi quattro?
Can't wait to see how it drives
Can't wait until it's done, i'm going to get stuck just so you can pull me out with it >D
The only rescue/towing business in the world that uses a Corvair for recovery. It's going to be fun to watch the customer's reaction when you show up with it. When your bank account heals don't forget the beadlocks, air tank and gloves.
I can't wait to see this thing on a recovery
I can only give one thumbs up on the video so here is the rest! 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 Great job! Love seeing this project come together!
So awesome man
Glad your on trending! yall deserve it, it looks gorgeous! I'm hoping the left side of your channel banner is waiting for this vehicle to get out and dirty
"trending".  Congrats matt!
👍💯
what is this strange custom they are undertaking? Eating inside of a building with other people you don't know?  guess where I am from...Looks like a fun group!
Absolutely amazing.  Can't wait to hear it fire up and drive
corvair is turning out nice
#30 on trending 🥳🥳
This is when the boss walks in and asks? Working hard or hardly working.
So excited to see this moving under its own power I can nearly taste it!  lol
What were those front gas springs? I missed the name, very cool looking.
Usually don't see the sheet sound/heat deadener applied to the bottom of the floor pans, especially in an off road application. IMO the Lizard Skin spray on coatings would have worked better for your application.
#31 on trending, nice work!
I'm really getting excited with the Corvair!
Woah #31 on trending.
COSTA VIDA!!!  I've driven 12hrs out of my way to get Costa!!!
I miss you rotisserie...
Small Azz guac! fer cry eye!
Ok i have to do it...SO..If someone wanted to buy the "custOver" what would you sell it for or barter for?
Dang, that's looking VERY nice!
It is looking great!  Hope it gives you many good recoveries!
OK, you guys need a lesson in hammers.   My dad, the first in his family to go to college, had a degree in "Industrial Arts" - how to use tools and make things.  Nothing would get his attention faster than catching me beating on metal with a claw hammer.   Claw hammers are made with a flat face, square with the handle so they will drive nails true.    When you use them on metal they become useless for nails.   You use a ball peen hammer on metal --- that's the one with a hammer head on one end that funny-looking round knob on the other end.      Don't make me come out there.
I've used plenty of things for a hammer, but never a floor jack.
Every time I'm about to click subscribe after a cool recovery video, theres more of this butt fugly corvair build 🤢
I think you'll make you goal of having it finished by new years.. I had my doubts in october though
Ready for king of the hammers!
Matt, will you be able to license the Corvair for on-road use in order to get to the sand without putting it on a trailer?
I would totally edit the title to “Custom Corvair crawler build”. Definitely big milestones to draw in some clicks :). Or maybe corvair sand rail, or custom corvair rock bouncer, or ultra4 corvair!
Congratulations
Towvengers Assemble!!!
It's begining to look like a off road rig finally. Hopefully your progress will be quick now that the big stuffs out of the way

Hey matt I got a question I’ve worked for a restoration shop and they’ve put the insulation/ sound deff on the inside floor boards why didn’t you (I don’t know much about all it)
I agree a Corvair is a rattle trap. Maybe that should be it`s name.
I can tell you what the sound deadning is going to do, Fall off. sorry.
Impressive
What year and model of toyota steering boxes do you guys use?
Right now this is #31 on trending. Nice!
Hay mat, when you finish the  corvair wagon, everyone should throw  yellow  water balloons at it and have a big  party.
Nicely Done!
Is there a "go fund me" site for this project?
Can you don’t show what you eat it’s not interesting
Omg I cant wait to see this beast first drive
This Corvair is now a brand new car !!!
Matt, what may be the most interesting aspect of your Corvair project is how honest the story is portrayed. You are leading a team of friends and family who pitch in effort to their particular talent. No pretense, and without a "million dollar" budget - this project is inspirational to those who dream of creating and building something of their own. Awesome documentary. Cannot wait to see the Corvair in motion, conquering a dune!
That's sure gonna be a beast when she's done.. Cant wait for 1st recovery mission. Great job Matt and crew.
What a cool bus John - will you do a YouTube channel for the RV build? That’d be so cool to follow 😎
It's looking so good guys!!!
I was like taking the bus huh, a friggin school bus!
LOVE IT!
562 thousand subscribers outstanding Matt and crew and Lizzy. And your wife and kids as well
Love watching the progress and glad to see the whole crew get along and work to get it done! You got awesome team members/employees and it shows they love to help.
Amazing. Poor Jamie
Are you going to keep the Hummer rims or go back to bead locks?
Sure am glad to see the Corvair coming along so well. In the mid 1960's a friend and I put a Corvair body onto a shortened Chevy fram, but we didn't go as far as you are going. Will be going up I-15 north sometime within the next month or so and would  like to stop in to see that beautiful hunk of metal.  Big fan! Jim R
Its about time to see it on its wheels......
Covair looks great, but so does the shop!!
Still no checker doors :)
Jamie buys lunch using Matt’s credit card 😂
👌🤘👌🤘👌🤘👌🤘👌🤘👌🤘👌🤘👌🤘👌🤘👌🤘👌🤘
Jamie, the next time you do a coin toss, the person who goes first has the option of keeping the results or trying again
Looks great congratulations
0:30 -- Not sure if anyone else has had the same experience, but everywhere I've used that rattle trap stuff that was next to a heat source (even relatively mild ones) resulted in that black tar/butyl/whatever backing oozing out and making a mess. In my case, it did it in the trunk and on the sides of the driveline tunnel in my Charger.
RIP rotisserie.
Man this thing is sexy
It beautiful....
Must be charging a lot for tows to afford to do all of that youre doing including the shop and staff ! Some big bucks there!
Good rotisseries never die, they just wait for another project! :)
Lmao "not the rotisserie"  😭, haha great video as always guys 🤙
your good people thanks for the vids cant wait for the next one!
i remember when this was supposed to be done by the first of the year. lol
WOW!
Im sure nate does the same stuff, he just doesnt add it into the video and acts like he didnt do it! You are just more honest! 😄
hell yea
Liked before watching!
RIP rotisserie
Once all the ropes, straps, etc. are put in the Corvair, where do Lady and Mac ride?
Loving it 👍 New t shirt idea for the future !  Matt  : do you guys happen to have anymore  hoodies with yellow banana on it 🤷‍♂️
👍
I'm sure the ' bolders' are going to appreciate the rags you used for the lift supports. Looking nice
It is way to pretty.  I doubt you will ever take off the pavement.
no egos, no drama.
what motor and trans are you running in it
Absolutely love watching this come together!!!
Really looking forward to seeing this new banana at work
I've not been a corvair fan UNTILNOW. That thing is going to be off the charts COOL & AWESOME!
the Corvair  is looking good
Want to sell the rotisserie?
Well some of the places you go ....look like MARS.      TEE HEE.
should of done full hydro for the steering
Can’t wait too see this Corvair in action
So rad! Keep up the solid content y'all 👌🏾👏🏽💯
Link to that Toyota box? I'm not finding it.
Y'all are Amazing! Having so much fun, and making it look like you're making it all up as you go! (...you Did have a plan, right?..). My son lives right around the block from you - I should have had him walk over and do a "Daily Video".
Sound deadener goes inside the vehicle not underneath unless that's something new they're doing
I didn't get a weather report....you guys are slipping ...
It's such a breath of fresh air to see people order food without a face mask
Right on Matt now we wait for the 1st fire in Corvair n test run
It's hard to tell without a close up, but the steering shaft is collapsible right? If it's not, you get a steering column through your chest in a front end collision.   Just making sure y'all are safe is all. From what I can see, it is.
Damn you guys just keep getting better with your vids. So much fun to watch! I hope y’all find another build/project after this one. This has been a very enjoyable side series!
This kind of fabricating practises going on? Apologize?  You guys need to watch HALFASS KUSTOMS and see what real fabbin is about. The General
Had some emotions when the rotisserie was disassemble 😛🤘
How many lbs in front
Did you upgrade the cam and valve springs in the LS engine you're using? That's is good for at least 50+ horsepower.
Farewell to the rotisserie.... The rotisserie, "I'll be back."
more more more!!! nice work!!
Lol the actual pumpkin 🎃 8:44
It’s looking great can’t wait to see the next one. Keep up the great work and thanks for the awesome content stay safe and take care
That looks so bitchin!  I want one!
This has been fun watching this build come together.
You guys have too dang much fun!!! Enjoy your vids....
Awesome machine
bbb
aaa
jjij
Man Corsair is locking bad ass !!
Dam its to nice for recoverys.   Cant wait to see it in action.
Hey Matt, I noticed in other videos you run the Patagonias, I have them currenctly but was thinking of switching to Kenda Klever RTs for hopefully better street manners, any experience with them and do you think they will still be good in mud?
The Corvair sitting on its own wheels looks so awesome!
Love your project.
ya Nate is pretty awesome guy
Trevor is more a working guy than a talking guy. Good to have when wiring up a project. Can't understand why these videos get any thumbs down!
She's mint!! I cant wait till its done and see it in action💪🏼👌🤙
You went to Costa Vida and not Cafe Rio?
Not gonna flex much i think
WHa? I thought you were gonna run double Kings all round!?
I want to see the big yellow bus with a Monster lift and Super-Single tires atop a 4x4 conversion.   I don't know if that's ever been done...
Looking forward to seeing the corvair on a recovery
Nice. Happy Motoring.
lmfao the sound deadening I remember putting Dynamat on every panel I could in my 2000 Nissan Maxima back in 2008. The subwoofer wars were peaking and I had a 1kW RMS Kenwood amplifier feeding two long-throw Orion 12" subwoofers in a ported box that took up the entire trunk. I pulled up to someone's house one day and they said I was rattling the dishes in their cabinets. 💀💀💀  Build is looking great!
awsome
Awesome job guys....
I heard large, large, large....small chicken salad......large, large. You guys are awesome. Wish I could work with people I liked.
Thanks for sharing! Looking awesome, take your time and get it right!
Looking good, The Tribute was a nice touch
There is nothing more relatable than a man who forgets the flare nut and touches things after being welded.
Corvair Extraordinaire... Hurry up and get this thing done I want to see it rolling lol (upright that is) and love the 'punkin'
No antifreeze on anything ?? LOL !!
Great build. Cannot wait to see you guys on your first rescue 😊
Alright, i'm all down for shop games, but if my boss yelled out "game to see who pays for lunch", I would silently slip out the back door and find something to do. No way I could willy nilly throw 200$ for lunch.
Maybe this question has been asked - WHY did you not have Big  Mike & Co fill in the Corvair fuel filler neck door hole? The tank   is in the back now !
Best recovery vehicle on the planet and giving that sweet old Corsair a new life
It's a roller.
Nice work
Love it!!😁
To be thirty years younger and able I for one would be hanging out with that crew of yours for sure Matt  love what youre doing and like everyone else on this channel we are dying to see this beast in action , great entertainment fellas and  ladies , cheers from down under !!
Can't wait to see this thing flexed out on some rocks.
With the XXX all over, should of painted it nude in color!
but all jokes aside, that one is fucking cool.
It looks much higher n heavier than Jeep Cherokee.  How’s that gonna work for off-road recovery ?🤔
Looks really good, well done guys 👍👍👍.
The lunch was more interesting than bolting up that cross member.  How was that large steak burrito.
Why is the motor in the trunk?
Restaurants are fully open in Utah !!!!!   New Mexico's witch Gov won't do that here yet.  Great job on the Wagvair.
OH ARE EYE!!!!!!!!!!!!!   NOT OREO.   (I hope anyways, but im probably the one whos wrong.)
Your gonna love the ORI's if you dont like them they need to be setup differently, they'll do anything you want.
Does the rear only have 3" of travel when it's loaded, or?
The first time this car rolls over or gets a scratch, there will be mourning in Utah.  It is quite a beautiful machine.
Did you ever do a compression test on that motor? Sounded to me like one cylinder was down when it turned over several episodes ago.
Wicked build!!
Why bed spray it if your just going to cover with insulation?
This will be awesome
Dah, what is a toyota box?  Thank you, the great Ali Khan.
Its so awesome to watch it growing up
I am unreasonably excited to see this build pull a Prius out of the sand.
Right back at you, mate; thanks fer wrenchin'.
I love the tire alignment device hahahaaa
hey matt a hammer is a #1 tool because it  fixes every thing LOL
Yellow submarine would be a cool name? You could make some sort of intro with the song!!  ( We all work for matt's recovery, For matt's recovery, For matt's recovery)!!
It's looking good, it's looking good!
Wow, what a beast that thing is becoming!  Can't wait to see it running through shakedown!
you keep saying corvair but chevy didnt make a corvair suv, i am really confused on what that is, a Jeep?
backintheday we used work benches, off the to edge played to the death . You could get good at a flat lob. the old timers could place a hanger 3 days a week.
Naaaaais!
Whoever does the editing does a great job!
God do I love how the corvair is looking.
Big girl, yellow big girl!!
Love the build great work:  but I can't see 4 adults in that thing plus 2 dogs. Back seat people there knees are going to be up near there ears!!!!!
Why no portal axles? The ground clearance end at he center hub.
that Corvair is SEMA worthy
This is cool as hell.  Can't wait to see it driving.
VERR NIICE!!!
You look like Grumpy from the seven dwarfs on your vid photo. Lol
Really can't wait to see the final product!!  Matt you should be very proud of yourself and everyone that has helped you!! One of my favorite channels!!
yeah, what's up with that jackin' the front up so far ?
I’m excited to see this around town Matt! Looks awesome!
It's the Simpsons bus!
got it for next project
That bus rocks I would love to see that build.
Loving watching the transition of the build. Also, the shop games for lunch!! I  used to have games like that by doing lockouts on the impounded vehicles we had to sell!! 😆
The anticipation is killing me.....
You guys are so much fun to watch.  Can't wait to see this beast out of the garage.
Trevor is a good hand. Matt better keep him around. Kinda like Randy. Guys like that you do everything you can to keep them happy. Guys like that make you money. When the employees tell the boss just go home I got this you have a good employee.
The Corvair looks badass. Can’t wait to see it in action. You guys have done an amazing job!
Im so excited for this project like it was mine! It's looking so good
Nice video! Looks great! The banana will be jealous. Ron
Super excited for you guys. Thanks for sharing the build process.
Awesome team you have in that shop.. keep it up boys and girls!
Front diff needs a smiley face yellow
Matt you really need a hi-capacity portable tire inflator for your vehicles. You're always changing pressure. And hard wire it instead of battery cables lol
So, when am I going to be able to pick up my new Corsair?
"" I am the assembly manual "" Priceless!!
"You had all night for something to say." LMAO!
Is it actually sounds deadening or sound damping ?
Just good people getting along together, the secret to your success. Who knew! This stuff beats anything the networks could ever put on the air. Hope to see you soon!
I want one... Lol awesome build!
And on the next episode, "Did anyone remember to paint the doors?"  Looking good, folks. Look at writing this thing off the taxes as advertisement, because it's definitely a rolling business card.
That's a lot of hard work.  Looks like it is paying off! Well done👍
Antimaskers "You can't smuggle my freedom"?
Corvair  needs a supercharger
So what engine is this thing getting?
"It's yellow, a canary" You should call this one "Tweety Bird"
might as well paint the whole dash yellow with all that overspray
wear a fucking mask please. I love your channel but not your attitude towards a global pandemic.
Love what you all do recovery and a bit of' off road fun to. Got do it. Life gets very boring other wise. I've done lite and heavy recovery in New Zealand. Cant wait for the new off road machine try out. Corvair. I like the idea of building things out of my head. I've built 3 saloon cars for my 3 sons for oval dirt track.
Not going to lie that montage made me sad hahahh
Congratulations please make sure to not and bolt check lol it looks amazing cant wait to see some recoverys with this beautiful machine
I am loving the lines on this thing. It’s like a sexier version of an old wagoneer.
Cool giving Nate a shout out🤙
Looking good! 🎯 Maybe I shouldn't be so lazy and go put my new shocks in the Jeep 🤷‍♂️ 😄
The longer I watch your videos the more I have noticed that you are getting very ad heavy. 6 2 ad commercial breaks in 18 min is a bit much.
Looks great,
Great Progress.  Great Engineering.  That gives a new meaning to 'Boxed Rear End'
I foresee once the Corvair is an action a banana on the rotisserie. Great stuff guys love what y’all do.
Amen to that great step in the right direction.  Kudos to you all, and for Jamie buying lunch.
Matt, I don't comment often on any YouTube channel, but I'm a fan for more than one reason.  What you do is interesting and has possibly given me ideas if I get hung up. I really appreciate you and your crew for keeping the language family friendly.  Thanks Much.  Lewis from Okemah, Oklahoma.
R.I.P rotisserie
I think everyone is waiting for the Corvair to move on its own and go for it's first journey............
Must be a great feeling Matt, seeing the dream come together piece by piece. Working with clean, fresh parts makes it even more enjoyable I bet! Can hardly wait to see first start and first drive. All the best!
I think Trevor just named it the cannery!
Hey, Matt what year corvair is this because I’m in love with it
If it dosent first that just means u need a bigger hammer
Yankum Ropes should get first dibs on the use of the rotisserie as they are about to undertake a resto-mod on their rolled Lexus rock-crawler.
This has been awesome cant wait to see it work ....also maybe consider do more fab work and stuff for content u do great work
It's looking great, Matt!  I can't wait to see it in person and meet the team when I come out that way this summer! 😎
Ok. I am LDS are you guys also?
Matt: "I've been told I fumble when it comes to fabrication. Only to get lucky." Fans: "Paul is a better fabricator." Matt: "Hold my Yankum rope!"
Man I love your channel! So clean , no drama, just pure fun. Keep it up.
Dang.. it's not finished yet
Lookin' good! Rudy looks like a tall leprechaun.
If the sound/heat trapping stuff starts to peal off I'd get some really good spray adhesive under each panel and more stainless steel pieces (and paint them all black).
wow the people who did the bed liner undercarriage really did a crappy job,yikes.
All the Democrats are screaming  "Where are their MASKS!"
Looking good!
best jeep build ever.. with . 0 jeep parts!
Watching the corvair come together almost makes me want to go to Utah and get stuck just to get recovered by the corvair.
Unpopular opinion;  WEAR A FARKING MASK WHILE OUT IN PUBLIC YOU JACKWAGONS!!!
It won't be finished until you paint the front Pumpkin.
That's a rig that should be at SEMA
I can't wait to see it in action
That Corvair is looking badass! That rotisserie sure was useful during the build. I love watching these videos and any time you guys do something I do it makes me feel legit. I loved how you "fixed" the mount that was too tight by wedging a nice long piece of schedule 40 pipe in there and prying it. I always try to throw a length of pipe in the box truck just in case. It can come in handy when things don't want to roll on or off the lift gate and when you have to hop a road case over a curb. It can also serve as a nice attitude adjuster in the right hands. At least a good deterrent. Can't wait to see the finished product. Better to have done it right than slap it together to try and make a deadline.
What was the original deadline on this?
The success of this channel is a win for normal people and good wholesome culture -- reality tv at its best.  Here's to a long lasting run with this channel and hopefully everyone who is a part sees success!
I don't know how Matt and Jamie's marriage works, but I know in mine anytime one of us "pays for everyone" we're both actually paying. Just saying, in your little penny game, Matt and Jamie had twice the probability of buying lunch for the whole crew than anyone else singularly.
No washers?
that was one of the coolest goodnight goodmorning edits ive seen in a LONG time. well done!
You better save that rotisserie for the corvair truck build
That's pretty cool that one of your employees got a bus
Gettin close  :)
Don't worry. Johnny joints are infinitely rebuildable so you can always use that joint with that bracket
It’s exciting - from our standpoint - watching it come together!
Seriously though, does nobody shave in south-west Utah? It's like watching an episode of ZZ-Top 😂
No masks needed in Hurricane?? Just curious!
Loving the build!! Do you have the part number of the rear shocks? been looking for some like that.
Looks awesome
Never before seen anyone put a car together with a hammer.   LoL!     Awesome work, guys!  Love your vids and can't wait to see the corvair "out in the wild".  Never been stuck in a couple of decades so I'm thinkin' of coming out there and Making the Call.  I will have a great surprise BBQ meal waitin' for ya when ya find me.
Beat to fit, paint to match! 😎
You guys have to take this to LS fest west!!
How u going to license it all u going to get is a lawn ornament
I think you should build a fire pit for the rotisserie and put a couple pigs on there and roast them up... Yum 😋
That thing is really starting to look great, using a claw hammer to knock in the bolts...hmmm, need to put that back in the tool belt and use the ball peen, you guys have serious skill though to build that up like you are, very purpose oriented. Keep up the great work and keep recording your rescues because we love watching them.
When you first started this project I was totally unimpressed and unenthusiastic with the idea. Now though I'm really excited to see this finished and see what it can do.
The new off road recovery is looking real good!👍🏻
are those dana 65 dodge or dana 60s
Congrats to all the crew it's looking great !
You so should have opened the back door (if it has one) of the bus, and people loop around behind the camera and come out again and again.
that does look awesome
A claw hammer lol
Beefy! That suspension looks serious!
A real nice looking wagon although I am not a fan of big 4x4s. Being a wagon and the car darth vader (Ralph Nader) killed out of spite. Claimed the swing axel was death!! Yet all those VWs and 911s used swing axels for many models/years without the "claimed" issues darth vader made.
So smart to add all that insulation for the harsh desert conditions you'll work in!
Hats off to everyone involved for a job well done..She is comin up a treat guys..just what i need to tackle our aussie outback.
I loved this video and seeing it all come together! That's a big milestone today. Exciting stuff and congratulations to all involved  👏 I can't wait to see the finished product and hear it start!
That thing is looking sick, can't wait to see it finished & out on it's first recovery
The rosterrie montage 👍😂
We love Winder towing!
"Corvpear" the other "Banana"!
I think that should’ve been a short bus
Congrats!!! Cheers from Argentina !
Corvair is looking good 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
So we got a call from NASA and the new Perseverance Rover got stuck in a sand dune.  " Well get em out"
Nice job everybody!  Been fun watching this one come together.
That Corvair is a pineapple upside down cake on that rotisserie.
It looks like a hooligan!
That thing is looking badass!
I love the Corvair videos!!!
Great video thank you!
Loved the love and effort that goes into this... cannot wait to see it pulling out some trucks down by the dunes...
THAT IS AN EPIC BUILD!! Great job, looking fwd to see more!
Steering shaft will be the death. To small I live in Florida mudding all my life. Roots kill them here. Rocks will definitely kill it there. Love your vids just trying to help.
I am so freakin jealous right now!
I must know the name of those cool shocks!!!!
I still remember when they barely got the 100k youtube play button! WOW they have come a longggg way! Keep it up guys
Love watching someone else make mistakes keeping a build project real I'm not alone making mistakes it's reality, I recently finnished my full body restoration 70' SS Chevelle barn find, it's not stock butt all numbers matching L98 396, turbo 400 transmission, on the dyno 631hp at the rear wheels, your reward is near Matt 😎👍
Didn't realize you could use a floor jack as a battering ram!
that thing is going to be badass, cant wait to see the first video pulling some knucklehead out of the dunes with it!  great job!
Sound deadener is typically placed inside the vehicle. They even make it with added insulation.
Out of all the car shows I watch, this has got to be one of the coolest builds I've seen. Awesome!
Bilstein's ??? Hope u have better luck with them than I Did
Where I live you can't walk in a store without a mask on. I mean, you can, but you'll get harassed. And eventually the cops get called.
Hey Matt when is your Corvair going to hit the sand?  Earl from Ontario Canada
Yes, really wow!!!
Weight is not a object? Or maybe it is the object.
I hate when business "slows down" your hobby. Bummer. . . LOl.
Yes you deserve that like 👍
Another great video.  And on my 40th Birthday too thank you.
Like the shout out to Nate. 🤘 @dirtlifestyle
You skipped the part in the manual that says nails Are smooth, bolts have threads..:😳😄
They have lizard skin, which they make a heat resistant and sound resistant version. It looks like bed liner and is spray on
🎃 looks wicked 👍
Excited for you guys!!
I'm impressed at Trevor sorting out that wiring harness.  Electrical is what I'm worst at.  The car's looking great - can't wait to see it do its first recovery.
Trevor looks like Adam Calhoun 😂
So freakin cool
Hell of a build! Thanks for sharing!
Lookin' good, that yella machine...
Now the only thing missing is the big nitro tank hahaha great project Matt!
Looks great.
Rotisserie will always be in my heart.
I love the pumpkin rear diff is classic
hopefully next video its all wired up and able to move on its own
Such a satisfying build to watch. Starting to get sad knowing it will end.
Please please go live if you can during your first rescue
Wooo Hooo that looks good.
Can hardly wait to see your first recovery in this!
I thought this was going on the snowcat.
Looking good!!!! That thing is going to be a beast! Can't wait to see it finished!
Corvair's lookin good.
Diesel would be amazing in this!
I know you got the axles all painted and nice looking. Why did you decide to not put a trust on the front axle?
Matt got all of us to feel sad about a fabricated chunk of steel. 🤣   😭😭😭
Hey in about to put killmat a similar product in my Jeep tmrw 😂😂
Please put a full fat exhaust on this beast. Looks tough, gotta sound tough!
I wish there was a video game where I could work on the Corvair and then take it out for a recovery at Sand Hollow!
With a hitch that high, it’s going to be an extreme angle for the rope to the towed vehicle. Going to be a challenge for low slung SUV’s with plastic chin spoilers.
Matt always has the most awkward outros
3:12   Oh My God.  Whoever scores that girl, you lucky bastard.
This is really happening!
Real excited to see the Corvair project getting back together! One of the most awesome build I have the pleasure of following! Can't wait till it gets its first recovery under its belt! Thanks
Looking great
Here's a (probably) highly stupid question: Since the Corvair will travel over public roads and carry passengers, will it need to have a state inspection?
Great video Matt and crew!
You need Rudy fan club T-shirts 😆
Need more Lizzy working in these videos!
F in the chat for that magnificent piece of rotisserie engineering.
Shout out to Nate Pickle from Dirt Lifestyle...woot woot!!
OMG....that looks SOOOOO sick!!!!  AMAZING job to your whole team!
It sat better then i tought great job
IF I COULD GIVE YOU GUYS AND THE CORVER 1000 LIKES I WOULD ITS LOOKING BAD ASS ALREADY CAN'T WAIT FOR THE END RESULT A BIG THUMBS UP FROM SOUTH AFRICA PRETORIA 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
That was fun. I only know enuf to watch the build and generally know what's going on.  I really enjoy watching hiw something is built. More!
Building a few off road race cars, I've gotta tip my hat to you guys!
Never thought that I would see a cool Chevy Corvair in my lifetime.
Have enjoyed this build. An idea . Would love to hear what and why you chose the differentials and suspension you choose and maybe why what others should for different applications or how they should choose to best cover their off road g styles and what they usually drive in .
Great video! Loving the added humour recently. Once the Corvair is done, you should a make a "Corvair Build in 5 Minutes" video, tons of views!
Matt: *hits axle to the right with the jack* Also Matt: Little trick I learned
Hey Matt, it's been great watching this build but your very specific about how its built which indicates you've built things on this level before, any chance you can show us, it would be great to see !
I hear destruction Derby all the time... What does it mean? Do they build it to destroy it?
Looks like it will be a BEAST!
What diff lockers did you put in?
YESSSS!!! It's almost time to test drive it!!! Can't wait for the video to see all your hard work pay off. Great job guys! It looks kick ass!
"Elon Musk send us to Mars" he does that and the first video is titled "So this rover made a call and the Banana got stuck"
I’m going to miss the rotisserie....
The rotisserie can now be used in teaching centres "what happens when our car flip"
lookin' good ya'll!
I helped build Race Cars for 50 years, have loved watching this project progress, can wait to see it on the Sand, we never cared about what time is was, sometimes 2 AM, always enjoyed the fun of the build, and i will say i have enjoyed the fun you all had with this build so far, great job Matt and crew, thanks for the share.
👏👏👏👍👍👍
You’re lucky to have a great team! This is almost better than the recoveries. Have you build vehicles in the past?
BEEN  WATCHING  AWESOME  BUILD  SO  COOL I  WATCH  YOU  AND  FAB  RATS    YOU  GUYS  ARE  AWESOME  LOVE  TO  WATCH
Excellent Video!
Awesome team you have there.  Amazing skills.
love your guys channel but put on a mask in public for fucks sake!
If crearance through dune tunnel isn't an issue, what about a roof rack for spare tire and shovel ?
soooo very good. flower from Saudi Arabia. but will it be better than the Cherokee.
I love watching your videos ,Can you please tell me who is who in your crew are you all one  family or all friends .
So you call the jeep banana,  is this one gonna be called the banana split (yellow on top black on the bottom )
So ready to see this finished can’t wait!
That doesn't look like a fuel injected small block Chevy crate engine
Whats the name of those shocks?
It's going to fun to watch you work out all the bugs
Flipping rotisserie memorial had me in tears 😂😂😂.
Awesome, I'm loving this build
Where is Lizzy ...... not complete if no Lizzy 🥰
Can't wait to see the first recovery!!!
Good progress! Won't be long now. Gonna need at least a couple shakedown runs......
I wonder what Ralph Nader would say about your Corvair   , Well piss on him !  I like it and would be proud to own it ! ! ! !
If I can't get my Ed fix, I'll take Trevor...
coolest corvair ever built
The rotisserie segment alone was worth a like!
I can't wait to se u rock climmen in it.
Wow the Corvanna looks awesome!  Can't wait for it to fire up and move on its own.  Great job.  Thanks for taking us along with your adventure.
So some time in the future when you are doing a deep snow rescue. And for one reason or another you shut the corvair off and it won't restart.  Then you'll remember someone suggested you put that dust cover on the transmission that encloses the torque converter.  Not just for dust. Keeps snow off the starter bendixen also. Been there.
Are you gonna mount a skidplate under the trans?? Awesome job so far!
Outstanding can't wait to see it in action
Looking good! Red (have viewed) lines under every MORR video, again :)
What the heck?  The sound deadening in supposed to be inside the vehicle not outside.
No masks in a restaurant? 🤦‍♂️
Matt realize that Jamie didn't buy lunch you did via your wife, ha ha ha. It looks really good about 90%. Can't wait to see it recover something.
You gonna call it The Pineapple?
This build is so unique.  Freaking awesome and you have a lot to be proud of!
Yeeyee
That means. Winder towing bought Matt's off road recovery lunch. 😋
Love your channel.  Makes me wanna get back in garage and build something..   or go save people.  Lol
Looking awsome. I love the style of this rig. There is a local guy around here that has a late 50s early 60s Dodge wagon on a 60 1 to 1 1/2 ton power wagon chassis
If some things dont work we will all learn from it.
The abilities that you guys have just blow me away!
sound deadening always went inside , well thats what I did when I did audio installs, I would be afraid the heat would loosen the glue up and fall off and hit exhaust and or moving parts
That's going to look sweat when it's done !!
Coming out so awesome! 🤙🏽
Matt that corvair better be better than the banana or there's no point
This is just me but I think Trevor is pretty excited about this build
_WINDERS ASSEMBLE!!!_
Looking forward to seeing the first recovery with the Corvair!
Would love to see "Ol' Brutis" driving around😁😎👍
10 ads in one video
piece of art job
Pretty sweet!
Seriously, paint behind the headlights, just behind the headlights, yellow
..... I've been thinking about getting a old school bus.. 🤔
I read the title and thought, "oh - can they fix that?"
So freaking cool!
Y’all seem like really solid people. Nice, polite and kind.
This has been awesome to watch can't wait to see it inaction
I loved watching this build until today... after all that work to paint it nice and get everything looking perfect you guys couldn’t spend 10 buck on some spray paint for the power train?  Green and greasy what the heck are you thinking????
Looks good😎
For the algorithm
I didn't expect that serious of a bus. I hope we get to see more of that build or, get a link to follow it. I am loving the Corvair. My parents had a '64 Corvair convertable when I was a very wee lad.
Gentlemen do NOT let Ladies buy Lunch.....
Man, I'm really going to miss that rotisserie...
Standing on it's own 4 feet with the driveline in very exciting milestone
Watching this episode while everyone went to lunch only staff was wearing mask 😷
Can't wait to see this beast in action.. curious to see how the weight of this is GNA match up against the sand dunes out there in hurricane
My condolences to the entire team for the passing of The Rotisserie.
not putting the nut on the brake line before flaring the tube? Nope I have never done that.....
followed this entire build ...great stuff
This is the fun part of the fab. Cant wait to see it done. Take time on wiring and get it right.
Wil you be using this truck for all your recovery’s ones finished?
The Winder logo needs to be hand painted by a Sign writer/pinstriper
If I had A lift, a welder, a rotisserie, 12 people, etc. I could have finished my 3 year 57 Chevy project by now. I'm 1 and 1/2 years into it. Hope to have it done by Thanksgiving. Btw my son and granddaughters are my crew for the heavy lifting. 😎🤗 LOVE your Corvair Matt. YOU have A AWESOME crew. 🤗
It cracks me up that they’re using a claw hammer instead of a ball peen hammer. Keep doing you!
Does everyone in Utah have an Amish beard? Like it is that a thing there?
I love how you use a carpenters hammer to hammer in the bolts. There are mechanics. ball pein  hammers in different sizes
Good job
A major rock climbing event with the new wheels and get the SUBS. Too a Million,, 🙏  Blue collar pass time 👍
The pumpkin-banana is lookin great so far!
Wow! There were WAY too many commercials... youtube must be making a fortune off of these videos!
I love this channel but are they all completely oblivious to the global pandemic happening right now? When they went out to eat they didn't take any precautions at all.
Looking good!!
Great build. Looking forward to its completion. The paint job is very Bob Ross. Looks amazing.
Well it just depends from an old school standpoint if you're going to off-road it it doesn't have to be streamline like a race car unless you're racing it I'm sure you'll have time to come up with the right joint or to just smoke one n say owell....
That thing will be awesome!
Almost done but the last 10% always takes the longest
If you ever end upside down you’ll be able to be seen from outer space possibly even from Pluto. I’m still wondering where Max & Lady and all the ropes and chains are gonna ride? What are you putting under the gas filler?
OK, I missed some vids somewhere.  Starting from the condition it came back from Vegas and the going to be sent to Mikes to get redone....Can someone post links so I can catch up please and thank you. All we need now is an electric motor.
exciting stuff! can't wait to see it out doing recoveries!
Lookin good.
This thing is going to be bad ass when it's done
The rotisserie tribute was perfect.
This build is bad ass! Great job from the team.
Looking tough!! Nice progress 🤙
I can feel the excitement! Great progress.  God bless and stay safe.
About a year ago I stood in the yard and Matt and I talked about this "one day" project and how cool it will be when it's done. I'm really excited for the next time I'm down to stop in and talk with Matt again and see the Corvair in person! Besides I need a new hat.
the anticipation is intense    like a young kid waiting for christmas morning  can hardly wait to see it in action
Sorry but when the title said corvair I was like NOOOOOOO...But now that I see this looks real cool.
Have You Found A Name For Corvair Wagon Yet???
The rotisserie served its purpose well. Sure it will be used again! Awesome progress!! Keep up the great work MORR!
Lookin' good, guys!
You guys are awesome...love your channel ...
What kind of tires you have on the Corvair or the jeep cause they kinda look like the tires that came wiyh my truck that I bought 4 weeks ago
I will be really interested in the total cost.
To Trevor the man of few words...you have to watch the quiet ones, they are the ones getting things done, and done right the first time..the build is looking amazing, can’t wait till it’s finished..❤️❤️❤️
Great build, your need to build a chuck wagon and get a cook to feed that crew !  God bless you and your family aloha
It's looking good
Looks awesome! I cannot wait to see this thing out on the trails!
Matt, please advise the air shocks and where you acquired.  Also the rattle trap heat and sound.
I don’t like the rims atm, their looks don’t meet the quality of the rest of the build yet..
Hope you run 40's and not 37's.  40's are awesome. There's some good radial choices too.
Can’t wait to see it on the dunes 👍
I lost it @ 05:00😢
Really like the covare wud love one myself but not for offroading but there's not many in UK lol
Bead Locks????
WIND AIR WAGON, gonna be something people  get stuck to see up close, sema shot before usage, you guys and gals put a lot of time, you $ she's a beaut for the butte's
It's looking very good 👍
Looks great hopefully Jamie spent the afternoon practicing coin tosses so that doesn’t happen again.👍🏽
Y'all make building a car look easy lol
Did you and Casey have a falling out. I notice you call Paul from fab rats now instead of Casey to assist on some recoverys
Paint looks great.  It is coming along great.  Nice to see it on the ground with tires on.  Can’t wait to see it rippin the dunes.
Is this going to be another recovery vehicle?
Good to see her sitting on her own wheels and suspension. Anxiously waiting for the final reveal.  Which will be done first. The Corvair or Dars jeep
I always learn something watching your videos and today I learned a lot, thank you!
Awesome stuff.  Whoever dislikes these videos...  has issues
thats looking great
Hell Yeah Brother keep on chuggin
Best “Thanks for Watching” at the end
The memorial to your rotisserie brought me to tears
oh, man. I can't wait for this to go bananas on the dunes.
The commercial ads are making it very hard to watch the videos now. Please stop playing adds every minute or two of the video.
Congratulations to the entire team. Huge milestone.
Looking good! Getting there, can’t wait to see her done!
These videos are the assembly manual for the vehicle.
My first 4x4 was/is a 93 nissan pathfinder. Thing is a tank, designed to go anywhere stock. I just bought a Comanche because the jeep community is way bigger and more chill
"Elon Musk; send us to Mars." My fave!!
I've been itching to do a build like this but with a crown vic on solid axles
There's a saying that I'm sure you know but it goes something like this, "The last 10% of work takes 90% of the time."
Ot needs super swampers
*sniffle* It was a good rotisserie. It spun it round round, baby. Right, round. R.I.P.
Trevor's beard deserves more airtime.
Woop woop!
I’m surprised to hear you have time to watch YouTube Matt! Please check out my Neoru build (AWD Neon), you won’t be disappointed(2,300hr custom build)! The rotisserie removal scene had me in stitches LOL, nice edit!👌👍
Gentlemen, I have 1 word! "Outstanding"  👍DARN SKIPPY!
Contentious comment of the week. Dang this build is taking longer than papa dars jeep is .just saying.....
Between the ground clearance and the suspension travel your going to need a skyhook to change a tire out on the road 😂
love my patagonias, I have two trucks with them on
More of the bus build please!
is it wrong I'm talking about the shop tools and said nothing about that sweet ride now rolling on er own again ?
Cant wait to see it drive
Wow, that’s coming on nicely. Great job guys
This week: rags on jack stands to protect the frame.    Next week:  lets drive this thing off that small cliff
Goodbye rotisserie my old friend, I love to spin you 'til the end.   🤣 Though they say your work is done, I think you'll be back for some fun. 🤗
You should make it so the doors can come off easy?
Nothing worse than making a perfect flare the  realizing you forgot the flare nut
Looking good!
This video has more commercials than actual footage. Lol.
I agree Toyota is easy and strong
Butter cup
Matt-- You should get a pic of Paul and decoupage it to the bottom of that lime green trans pan!! And let him discover it for himself. (I'm sure he doesn't watch your channel because it's just all his ideas that you steal) lol
You know the wheeling videos of Matt testing the Thunder Wagon are going to be epic.
That beards becoming a work of art! Great work, it looks a complete off road machine 💪 🇮🇪
I thought the song for the rotisserie was going to be "turn around...." for a second there 😂
VERRRRY Cool! Congrats Guize on the milestone.  Looks Great!
Put a air compressor in it
When this project was launched I thought what the hell, no way but watching it has been a blast. I've even returned to a project that was sitting idle for 6 years because of the building of this. For that, thank you for the entertainment and the motivation to get up and do something!
✌️☮️
She's looking good!
Nice work can't wait to see it Wheeling
Looks like the mars rover w heat shields. I was gonna say something else but Ruddy always beats me to it. It’s like from my mind to Rjuddy’s mouth instantly.  Uncanny... Looks great can hardly wait to see it show us it’s stuff
All aboard the blue bird express
Reminds me of an H3 Hummer! (Maybe because of the wheels)
That is awesome
Awesome build...love to see how it's coming on
yo, that spin video transition from night to day looked so professional!
Thats a nice mill in the back ground there Matt .  Looks like it's turned into a close rack and a catch all .... what's it's story ?   lol    I'm always eyeballin tools ;)
If you need a tuner once things are together, check out Skaats Precision. He'll get you taken care of
Thanks for not stretching this out to 3 episodes
Wow. Corvair looks fuckin goooood.
You guys are not going to want to even get the Corvair dirty much less scratched or dented. ....Hey what about a rear facing camera .
Aren't shocks upside down?
I seem to remember that corvair’s were accused of being a roll over hazard, that was proven untrue but this one has a much higher center of gravity and may just make those accusations a reallity.
Needs a set of beadlocks!
So long rotisserie, we hardly new ye.  RIP
Great job 👍🏻👍🏻
Well Matt is cool as a cucumber.  I would have flipped out on the undercoat people for the crappy job they did..
I laughed, I cryed, I got hungry, then I got excited, now I'm tired goodbye!  Good shout out to Nate my second favorite channel..shh don't tell him that! ✌😆
That is such a cool build! I can’t wait to see what it looks like when complete!
I see you out there with that "goodnight - good morning" transition
Anxious to see Ed’s weather report in the new ride
Man! Where's Trevor from so I can get a hundred like him. Hard worker!
I see you're using copper/nickel alloy lines (at least for some of it).  I suggested them to Fab Rats Paul a couple weeks ago for future reference.
so nice going to be one bad banana
The glamorous taxicab proximately add because adjustment developmentally puncture round a wakeful sparrow. two, red adult
Looks great! Now I want one! 😁
What's up with the 🎃 on the rear diff? I kinda like it.
I love waking up Sunday morning, enjoying my coffee with the Corvair build... Thank you guys it’s sure looking badass and I can’t wait to see it in the dunes!!
if you need a heavy tow vehicle why not just use a Ford F250 ?  why build from scratch ?
GREAT JOB GUYS  I can't wait to see you first RECOVRY    with this BEAST. Your big fan from ALGERIA
I watch Trevor with his wiring and keep thinking.. If that was me, there would be Zero chance that anything would be powered correctly... He is a master (I hope) LOL
I see you put it in the tunnel only that should work ok I guess I wasn't thinking when I did mine pretty exited about seeing this thing in action its going to be a hard hitter.
Am I the only person left in America that doesn’t like Mexican food? 🤔😂  Great job guys, man it’s been fun watching this build...OH and love the jack o’lantern!!
You can definitely tell that YouTube likes your videos 18 minute video and I've watched 6 minutes of commercials
I will someday make it out to Hurricane, Utah and see this beast in person 🤘
It looks soooooo gooooood
you guys are kookie as heck
Working on my jeep in a hurry one night. Flared the end but forgot the fitting. So frustrated, I cut it off and did it again....exactly the same as the first!
Lizzy deserves more camera time 😃. She was bored, busy on her phone 😂. She can assist the guys
Really fun build to watch!
I have covered every square inch of my car in that rattle trap about 5 years ago and it's still holding and seems to work great
With the rear shocks at those angles, how do they work properly ?  My brain can comprehend how it would work articulating, but not with them moving up and down in unison.
Looking good. Can't wait to see the final product! How much do you think it will way completely full of fluids, gas and all the recovery gear? Something else that would have pretty cool would be where you could hit a button to air down when you get to where going then when you get back on pavement you could hit another button to air up from inside. I think that would be an awesome add on in the future.
Funfunfun Looking great
Mmmm, Space buggy 🤤  Even though it's a Corvair it still looks like a slightly rounded XJ lol
I said “cafe rio” out loud when y’all got off the bus but I was off a little haha!
Looking great!!  I’ll be watching all the way to the finish.
ORI's in the front is how I started.   Now I cannot wait to have them in the back also!!   I love them
Looking real good !
Nice progress.
NO NO NO NO NO NO I put that stuff under my truck it went to shit rattle trap the mud destroyed it car was every weekguaranty
So cool!
Rudy could have a very lucrative future career, building high quality one off cars.
And yes EVERYONE  but matts crew had on mask in the restaurant.  Kinda sad that everyone else cares about others health.  But they are Trumpers so i guess i can just think IT WILL ALL JUST GO AWAY .
I loved watching you fabricate and assemble the Corsair.
Funny she was paying for lunch and she ordered a small while others ordered a large.  Lol
Rudy's  project  part 2 The rotisserie  ROLLS again It warms my heart???   Its coming  along nicely just in time for summer 👍🤠🤠
I was gonna get 3" Bilstein for my 4runner....but they have issues of breaking apart...so im going with 3" Old Man Emu.
Matt will the rear shocks shafts get sand blasted over time or will you  put a shield around them
i think this is the only youtube channel i don’t skip through any of the vids.
"I am the assembly manual." yeah been there. lol
“I’m making a rat’s nest into a bird’s nest!”  Love it.  Only one complaint boys, you made her look like a Chevy, square hole with round wheels!
KUDOS...great build (so far)  I've been watching since the beginning.   Keep on keepin on.
I love that the pumpkin is painted like a pumpkin 🎃
The shop should have bought lunch.
rest in peace, rotisserie ! HI from France
Poly and synergy are great companies 👏🏽 glad to see you support them!!
That looks awesome very fine work brother. Great build ...👍👍👍
Whoever edited this video is awesome! The farewell to the rotisserie had in me laughing out loud. 🤣
SWEET!
Sell the rotisserie to a or the paint shop.
That looked like the Partridge family filing out the bus.
Its looking awesome great job.
Looks like the questionable undercoating job isnt' keeping you boys down at all!  Glad to see all the progress in such short time since you got it back
These folks are so considerate. They go eat where everyone has a mask on for their protection.....but do they return the favor?
Microchannel coil, god I wish they didn't put those in cars of all things.
Love you guys! When I'm chilling with nothing to do I can always count on you guys to me some quality entertainment. I also feel like I'm learning a lot. I Wanted to say thank you, I don't ever buy anything but I try and watch all the ads for support.
Is he saying oaries?
Looking good!
Just wondering why not have ori’s in the rear also. Will they not support the weight of a loaded down rig? Because fabrats also has them in the front only
Can't wait to see it in action
I know the build is a passion of love not financial but the man hours on it must be astronomical, that is a one off, one off. It's going to be a beautiful machine.
How is the second undercoating holding up? Get the paint lines cleaned up?
Freaking awesome....I love this build
Over 500,000 people have died from COVID. Why in the hell are you not following COVID protocol?  Are you totally morons?
Great progress guys. 👏 can't wait to see it on the trails
Aren't you worried that the rocks and gravel hitting that heat shield will penetrate it and eventually knock it off
We had a corvair greenbriar van with an olds toronado 455 in the rear end. Totally useless project. Before YouTube.
REALLY enjoyed seeing the Corvair come together . This video was intriguing to watch . Well done Jamie for lunch ..
Looks like r front break-in is hitting when wheel turned.
Daily driver/show truck
The sweet pork at Costa Vida is so good 👊🏻
I have used the adhesive heat shielding a lot on my race cars. Over time, you will be happy that you added those aluminum pieces to the edges of the heat shield because the adhesive WILL fail over time and be a problem. That should help a lot
I think you need a curb if you are going to pitch a penny. I loved comment "going from a rat's nest to a bird's nest, oh it's yellow, it's canary nest."  It has a very good stands to it and glad to see it back on it's wheels. The paint really added to it and I enjoy what you've done and look forward to seeing it in action.
Rudy: Hmm, I wonder if I can turn the rotisserie into a giant go cart for me. Rudy shouts out to Matt "Can I borrow the rotisserie?" Matt: Why? Rudy says with a sly grin "I am working on a surprise"  Stay Happy, Safe and Healthy Everyone 💕
Long time fan here. You’re on the road to a million Matt, you deserve it.
Did you guys use thread locker at all?
So awesome!  Congrats to the crew and thanks for sharing these experiences.
You could probably sell that rotisserie for a couple of bucks no problem
Assembly line. The Ford way.  Can’t wait to see the BODY FLEX.
Oof 666 comments 😳🤣
Oh dont forget to pat razor on rotisserie to train people what feel like in roll over when rock crawling.
I need to move to Utah. Go to lunch without a mask like that here and you'd get screamed at.
Im gonna have to figure how to get there from Kansas to get stuck to see this in person and be on your channel 😁
I need to make a trip from Flagstaff and come check this beast out!!! Cant wait to see her out in the wild!
Loving the build!
I always thought the heat shield/sound deadner went on the interior before flooring and door panel ect.
to the moon
OMG all those wires looks like a telephone exchange, trucks coming on lovely its going to be the bees knees when it done, hey theres a name for her The Bees Knees
about the brake lines - we put in every line a stopcock , so when a line is leaking, you can switch it off
Next to Andrew Camarata, this is the very best program on You Tube.  Bar none.  Always enjoy.  Thanks for a lot of good entertainment.  (Why Andrew - man, that kid does everything and does it well.)  Buy lunch -  Hope it came out of the 'petty cash box".  OK.
Congrats everyone! Been a long time coming and it looks great.
I think that once the Corvair is officially making some reliable $$$. The Yellow Banana should get a newly built 4.8 liter Stroker inline 6 cylinder engine with up to 395 HP. Which will bring new life to the Cherokee. Custom engine colors? It is not my intention to sell or advertise. Only for research in what is being done and can be done to the Jeep Inline 6. This is for knowledge gathering. Research Titan Engines and their kits. Out of Ocala, Florida.  Research Keith Newcomer at Newcomer racing. YouTube. "The Horsepower Monster". 800plus HP.
Can't wait for the maiden voyage! Good work guys💪 🍌
Fantastic.  Good for you guys!
Looking good...
10:35 buffering!
My motorhome had similar heat shield in the engine compartment. The shield separated with the foil pealed free from its backing and flopping loose/falling off. The fix was put galvanized metal over it. Hope yours works better.
I Love Following This Build ! It is coming along!
Love the pumpkin on the pumpkin
I can't believe your going to use that too tow. But being familiar with IRS deductions, once a month makes it a complete write off as a specialized vehicle.
So excited to see this thing on the trails!
Looks great.  The bumble bee is looking great.
Comeing along, looking good so far, I don't even want to imagine how much money you have spent on it sofar.. thousands!!! Iam sure. Keep it up can't wait for the first start up and first test drive.. it's right around the corner....... staying tuned..........
Jesus, u guys or going to be able to tug the space shuttle out of a ditch with that.
Thank you for making these awesome videos. I know it's a lot of work and it's slowing the building process down a bit but I really enjoy watching it go together.
Looks good!
Looks good you have all good ideas it should be a good pulling Machine U have a real machine when you’re done
These videos always make my Sunday mornings more enjoyable.
I thought that stuff went on the inside ?
You can know say it took a jack hammer  to put it togather
Nice Job!
We need some fan art of the Corvair recovering the Mars rover
Being from Canada I can see how your Covid cases are thru the roof. Fearless!
Lol I make mistakes like that all the time buddy! Thanks for the shout out and I look forward to checking this thing out in person 🤘 Great work
I’ve just decided Rudy is the fab wizard
That is the baddest looking Corvair I've ever seen!
You guys realize that rotisserie is the envy of every shop in America?
Never seen Trevor with his hat off!!!
"A" for AWESOME! Matt, you have an amazing team. Thank You to each and every one if them for such great content. Regards from S Africa Clive
I love the fact that you're going all out with sound deadening and such on this! 👍
You guys are making my knees hurt crawling on the cement without knee pads. Can somebody please paint that pumpkin! Lol
Can’t wait to see this do it’s first recovery
Does or will this build have locking front or rear diffs. And I’m gonna already just assume this is 4x4 cause of the recoveries I’ve seen y’all do are mostly in loose terrain and what kind tires y’all run?
Sound deadener is supposed to go on the inside of the cab
looks like its about time for me to fly down, rent a tiny car and drive down the Toquerville falls road...
Did You fix that crappy bed liner ?, if not the insulation isn't going to stay.
That rig is gonna be too damn nice to go out beatin on...
Speaking from experience, fab work isn’t as easy as you make it seem. Nice job!
So the jeep is the banana, and this is the canary? 👍
just wondering, no COVID precautions down there in ?
Love it guys can’t wait!
Looks like a Hot Rod. Nice.
Tappy, tappy, tappy.
Looks like a Hot Rod. Nice.
Cant wait!!!!!
I see more editing this video it seems like every video is more and more put together. Great work keep it up!
on the gusset plate around the rear diff... is that undercut along the top edge of the weld...or just shadow from the video or something? paint makes weld discontinuities look worse, and that LOOKS like undercut from the video.. obv cant say for sure without picking it to see if it is... but IF it is, i would stack two passes over that to get rid of the undercut. cuz IF it is undercut, it WILL break... everything looks amazing though. great job guys.  living the dream
Any idea on curb weight?
Out of interest why didn't you fit portal axles?
Winder Towing looks to have a pretty cool little crew.
Now thats beginning to look sexy as hell definately cant wait to see this fire up and drive. Defi ately looks the goods
Looks great
I'm getting excited just watching this.
1:20.  If that adhesive does not hold up on the heat shield (and mine didn't), red RTV is your friend.  A thin coat on the entire mating surface and apply pressure until it vulcanizes.  If this works, you can put it on video.  If not, I said nothing.  Thanks for all of your videos, they are endlessly entertaining.
This is going to be 👌 👋 nice
Rattletrap XXX  and insulation, do you not usually put that in the inside of the vehicle, i just see that as trapping water, mud and debris under it which with vibration will eventually wear at the under coating.
Great video once again team. Can't wait to see it in action.  On another note, What the heck Youtube with all these ads all of a sudden, not very enjoyable.
13:00 I used to have a bus, converted to a circus tourbus, used to love driving all over the UK and Europe all painted up, gettting offered places to stay, food and even free fuel on a few occasuions
MaybeThe heat shield should go on the inside of the car.
It looks so good
It's getting monstrous.  Greetings from Brazil.
SUCH a beautiful build for the old gear head living vicariously thru this channel... ashamed i have not subbed tillnow... BUT... WHY NO FRAME MOUNTED ROCK SLIDERS TO PROTECT ALL THAT HARD WORK  FROM THAT ONE MOMENT OF TOO MUCH TESTERONE????
Got weirdly emotional for the rotisserie. It's like a part of the crew is going away. 😩
Thanks a lot Matt now you got me wanting a Corvair....lol
Next up, a whole fleet of them!
Milestar better be giving you those Patagonia m/t tires by now lol. Most I’ve ever seen them on YouTube consecutively. They are even catching on here in Texas
Nice guys :)
Ol trever looks real excited lol
.....pretty darn good stuff here...Matt and guys!
He needs to do a roof raise on that skoolie
This is so bad ass it's going to need a name, I think "Ralph" or "Nader" would be appropriate!
good job team! this thing LOOKS AMAZING!  congrats cant wait to see it ona  recovery!!!
Love the stance of the Corvair, ready to run tall and proud into the wilderness when it's all done with the exhaust note rumbling 👍🇺🇸.. The Off-Road Road Warrior..
man this front shocks are amazing;)
A great feeling!
RIP the rotisserie. Haha
MY EARS, listening in headphones while you roll the jack accross the floor!!! ouch...lol
Y'ALL should raffle off some merch for a correct guess at final weigh-in numbers! Is it 3 ton of fun or 5 ton of tank?
How long until Velocity gets a hold of MORR and butchers it?
Matts Fab
Trevor: "Moo"
good luck guys ; Moroccan's fan
Matt, the dedication that you and the shop has made to build this Corvair is more than a recovery vehicle, it's a piece of rolling art. Who would have thought that a 1960 era Nadermobile would ever grace the streets again, much less be built as a recovery vehicle.   Well done Guys and Girls.
This is my favorite YouTube channel.
“Tappy, tap, tap” Does Matt watch aVe?
Awesome video awesome group
The Corvair looks amazing! Nice job Matt and team. I bet some will put their car in the ditch just to get pulled out by that beauty.  Lizzy jumping out of the bus made me laugh so hard. She is such a sweetheart :)
It'll come along fast now!!
Pretty dang cool..... BUT! Those wheels gotta go man.
Matt and his crew recovering mars rovers..🤔🥳
Did Paul from fab rats teach you to bump that front end over with the floor jack. Cant wait to see this on the trail doing recoveries .
What are those long bars that go from the front to the rear?
Goodbye rotisserie. You did a fantastic job!!
Thats a pretty cool suspension set up ive never heard of it. Usually people put the kings on
That is a Baad looking machine!🔥
pumpkin axle pumpkin cover   could also have picked a ....axlelotl xD
" I don't read the assembly manual, I AM the assembly manual"
Jamie buying lunch means Matt bought lunch for everyone LOL.
Was that a 10mm socket that fell?  Never gonna see that again.
I don’t have words for how impressed and amazed I am by what you have done !! You should be PROUD !
Looks great
It'll be a historic first for someone to get rescued by a 4x4 Corvair Wagon. A first
Do they make ORIs that can handle more than 1500lbs per corner?
MATT  this build is coming along  nicely  .  Jamie put a smile on all the  peeps faces  . That  puts a new twist  on   working for  food   :-))
One of the best builds on YouTube now.
Awesome fabrication ...but the claw hammer has to go ....don't make me send you a mechanics hammer
looks great !! is the LSA supercharger still being considered?
Get it done
My son bought a bus and he is turning it into an RV (a schooly ??).
I would put my faith in Matt’s Off Road Recovery to save the world from destruction. Matt’s and Fab Rats can build it. Elon Musk you heard them. Make it happen!   If the Perseverance Rover gets stuck up in Mars, NASA will make the call.
Ummmm, why use rattle trap... that rhino coating did the same thing. Its a recovery rig not a tesla lol.
No mask mandate in your neck of the woods?
Its a rolling banana!
Looking good, car does too.
Had some ideas while watching this, it would not take much to fit and plumb a hydraulic jack system, also the hole above the bumper line you could fit pull out drawers for the recovery equipment. looking good I can not wait to see it used in anger, but first, it needs a good shakedown in hostile places. How come the fuel filler hatch is still there shouldn't it have been deleted as the gas tank is going to be in the rear.
A set of gunmetal Method wheels would set it off! Those are killing the look imo. Loving this rig! Im guessing  onboard air?
Trevor is a good add to the "show" Darn skippy! Oooo, really funny episode! LIFT that bus!
Wow ... I thought this was going to be awesome but it’s even better than I thought. Pump up the ride height !!!
Am happy so u all must be happy to see d plant turn into a banana ripe 1
Bracket Fix - -Warp it! Aya Captain...Bracket Warped! Good work. Corvair build goes as [?] planned.  That is gonna be one piece of work when done. . . waiting on it.
Sometimes as I go about my day I find myself whistling the slide guitar riff from these videos. The music is really nice.
Can’t wait to see it done now. Looking good Matt! And crew!
I know of at least one undercoat shop that should invest in a rotisserie!
Okay everything was going fine until the school bus. as a retired school bus driver of 38 years as soon as I saw it I started to feel hot flashes then smoke started coming off of my skin I had to immediately run into the shower to keep from bursting in the flames
Awesome 👏🏻 👏🏻👏🏻
The first 10 rescues should get a free rotisserie chicken with their T-shirt, In loving memory.
You have your little drone it can attach to the underbelly, of the Corvair and off you go. Utah looks like a mars landscape sometimes most of the time.
Man, I can't even remember how to change the oil in my car and here these guys a pretty much building a new car from scratch!   Amazing.    Does Jamie have his own YT channel for that bus conversion?  That would be fun to watch.
What did you do to fix the undercoating problems?
You adding bead lockers?
Some truly poignant moments for sure but life goes on. Farwell rotisserie
This is what a sema build should be, completely functional and looks awesome!
Corvair getting sweet., I can’t wait to see it crawling 😍 .. good job guys.!
Hope you used heat resistant wire loom.  Or you will be replacing it in a year.  Keep the amazing videos coming
i'm having dinner while watching.. K.S.A time
Jamie. Buy Matt a better belt. His pants are all over the place and his crack collects to much dust!! ;)
Now we need episodes on the bus build, that looks awesome!
John's "bus to RV" could be a cattle truck!  There's no where to 'recreate' in that RV?  The 'vair is looking good, it does look like it might be cramped.
Store that rotisserie somewhere, cos you know the minute you get rid of it you'll (or someone will) need it again!
Notice that the one that ends up buying lunch buys the smallest meal.
Congrats!!! Huge progress. I may need to come by and sneak a peek in person. Save the rotisserie for the Rampy Wrecker.
Sunday morning Corvair build vids are absolutely the best! Goes well with my breakfast and coffee
It's coming together can't wait for it first recovery looks good
It’s looking really good guys
10:32 Calculating!
awesome !. just one suggestion  loom covering for interior and undercarriage  extra layer of protection .
must say..the music for the outro of the rotisserie brought tears toy eyes..
Fare thee well big chicken machine
So cool !
Real good friends of mine are the owners of ORI, glad to see you install them.
Every right to be happy.  This needs to be included with the Epics of  YouTube. Congratulations
Awesome, I can’t wait to see that baby in action.
The Corvair is a thing of beauty !
Your salute to the "rotisserie" was hilarious. Well done!
Nearly there and it looks 👍great
Those are its wheels??? Figured you’d do bead locks.
Excited to see it off-road
man, I can't wait to see the Corvair first rescue.
I could not stop crying 😭 for a week now. I will miss the Rotisserie dearly. Like a family member gone. Never knowing if it will return or has departed this 🌍 earth.
Great job guys! Looking good! Was wondering if you could give an update on the milestar patagonias. I'm looking for a MT tire that does well in sand and snow. Still recommend it?
Great job on this build and glad to see it coming together finally.  The whole team has put in a lot of hard work and hours getting it to this point and I’m sure you all must be feeling a sense of pride in your accomplishment.  What are you gonna name it?
Are you doing a triangulated 4 link front with mechanical steering (you will get tons of bump/compression steer) ? Or are you going full hydro steer (not real safe for on road) ?
Dirt lifestyle is an awesome channel. Nate is doing some very cool builds.
this is going to be an awesome truck when its done!
R.I.P. In Peace Rotisserie
That is going to be the most expensive Corvair in history!
And remember go get stuck for more content
Come on Matt, Get rid of the claw hammers, it's a car not a house. Very Tacky!!
Where is Ms. Lizzy?
What are your favorite tires I'm looking for some 32's for my yj.
I really need to get a hoodie before it gets warm!
This build needs to go to Sema. Cheers from Tokyo! Stu
Wish i could drop my project off for a week. Then it would actually get done. Lol
As Matt's talking about Nate I get a notification for his newest video. Perfect.
Love the build....💯👍
Well I'll be..... Y'all might just get'er done this year! Haha.  In all seriousness,  it'll be worth it. This thing looks really cool. We'll see how it does and how it holds up as time goes on.
I would so be over helping to assemble!! Payment NOT necessary! Edit: I need to move to Utah there's good people there. Plain and simple...
Lookin good!
no rotisserie hope the corvair never rolls again lol
You guys want a laugh watch VGG charith delivery run in a buss for Christmas
1:00 I see that undercoating is holding up well.
great..very satisfying the  marriage went that smooth...it`s getting there,can`t wait to see it running...allthough i need to say: we put the insulation on the inside of a car...lol..
Corvair is coming right along...gonna be bittersweet when it’s done! Bright side of course will be watching it work along side the Banana during recoveries! Great job guys... really shows off your your skills.
You guys really are just the best.
Looking forward to seeing first fire up and first drive!
Looking darn good Matt an team
Come on little doggy...Old Yeller is about it live it's best life!    Every time I see the pumpkin, I get a Halloween flashback of a viral .gif shaking if you know what I mean. ROFLMAO
Oh the Nate shout out ❤
So excited to see this drive it's first trail. 😎👍
make sure you write off that lunch as a business expense since it was part of making this video.
Dang it.. got me all teared up at that Rotisserie tribute. Can't wait to watch this thing move!!
Matt, not sure if you have already , but you should remove the undercoating at the steering box mounting points. It will loosen and squirm around otherwise. Any time you need a solid connection, you should go to bare metal.
Looking great. going to be bad ass!
I'm not crying, you are
Holy Crap it’s looking great Matt and Team..
How exciting! It looks amazing
Like a Space Ship?? New name, the Desert Rovair...
Aluminium corrodes when in contact with stainless steel, they have a galvanic reaction with each other & moisture.
Did Jamie really buy lunch?? Looks like a company credit card. So that really means Matt paid for lunch... LOL
Nothing more beautiful than men and their projects coming together.  Now the anticipation of hearing that LS waking up.   It's a nail biter!!!!    Very well played gentlemen
Whoa what restaurant isn’t ask for mask? Where is this slice of pre2020?
Toyota strong 💪! Looks awesome Matt!
As a person hello from turkey relish watching the end of this offroad vehicle and I am looking forward to meeting with the wild mountains.
Everybody that didn't have to pay: Large portion. Jamie who had to pay everybodys food: Small salad. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's coming up good
I'm really curious how will it perform or is it will be any good and durable :D
So is this car going to be a new rescue/tow car
Hell ya can't wait to see it done! Some Nitto Trail Grapplers would be icing on the cake 👍
This Corvair Wagon is going to become FAMOUS and achieve CELEBRITY STATUS very quickly.
Seeing the rotisserie go out that door naked made me snuk.  😢😢😢😢
Thanks for sharing the mix, some really good editing going on. Congrats on the progress!
I might be more excited than Matt to see this finished. Don't think we didn't notice you almost tear up there at the end.
That stuff is permanent I had the dynomatt version it’s insane it will take off your undercoating I promise
I love it ! Cant wait to see it at the dunes !
I could watch someone else do fab work all day long lol. Looks great guys.
How long will it last before it rolls? Trever is one dedicated SOB.
Not one Ball-peen hammer the whole fab shop 😂 That’s OK! Because it’s your shop! 😎 Good Job on the Corvair!
Does anybody else really want to get their car stuck, so that Matt can pull us out with that awesome truck?
I promise you that stuff stronger than undercoating. The undercoating will peel off when you’re ready to take it off lol
Sound deadening on the outside and under the car Long term my guess it hold's sand dirt and rust
Pins and needles!!!
That is one cool project!!! Can’t wait to see it finished and pulling people out of 💩situations 👍🏼👍🏼
Cant wait to see this puppy finished!!😊
Your channel is just too cool. It’s always an exciting day to watch a new episode of your family.
Don't forget to carry a bundle of baling wire with you when that bracket breaks off.
Ported Toyota box... ported XJ or JKU box from PSC is waaaay stronger than any foreign garbage... FUCK TOYOTA🖕🏻
Wondering whats going to happen to the cherokee, the great yellow banana.
Paul gets out a tape measure to make sure the vehicles level.   Matt: nah. Looks good.
this is rotten Rodney I see you haven't painted the front pumpkin yet get er done
The rotisserie vignette was delightfully sappy and silly. Great job!!!
Its looking Great..Cant wait tosee the maiden voyage  with her. See how that LS motor does..Lots and lots of power for sure...Great Video...Tell your wife she needs a little practice at pictchin pennies....LMAO....LOL...Just pickin..LOL.Great Video thankyou for sharing...
Love the shout out to Nate, that was quite funny!
Holy buckets, you got a lot done. Well begun, half done.
Does the oil pan get a skid plate, with air holes (cooling), for protection??
Absolutely glorious!  Love this build!
What's wrong with the 400ex.?? Mint bike.!!.
I'm getting excited to see it in action! 💪🏼🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Y’all going to SEMA with that thang?
Nice job Matt i hope you install front and rear deff-lock on it.
The "bananas revenge"  is looking awesome chip foose eat your heart out .and who ever left the 20 dislikes  that's totally unacceptable
I have a similar problem Matt, my fixes and fabrications work most of the time but they are not pretty. My problem is i am not patient
Based on the soft cotton towels on the lift, are you really going to use the corvair for recoveries? Can't wait to see the lone teardrop tattooed on your face for the first scratch. Love the channel, still on the bucket list of things to do....SO, I MADE A CALL
So disrespectful going around everywhere especially into the sandwich shop and none of you were wearing masks..
The rotisserie is one of the best parts about this build!
Getting close but as for everyone who has ever built something from the ground up like this now its time for the "little stuff" lol. And we all know the "little stuff" takes painfully forever!!!
Wow very nice..👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🤗
Fantastic. Loving every minute!
I think you should paint the wheels or linex them to match
You guys are great I needed a laugh today
Matt says "this has been a long time coming"  I say "its been a enjoyable time watching". Tip for Jamie. You pick the game for the next "who buys lunch".  A math or spelling quiz would make for some good laughs. Congratulations to all of you getting it to the "roller" stage.
Love the dirt lifestyle shout out haha
That thing looks awesome!!
salut bon boulot c est le quatres roues motrices que j ai vu
This is EXCITING!  I know you are happy. Thanks for sharing.
lol trevor
After all the money, and all the the time invested in this wonderful  build, there is no way I would have continued forward after that  undercoating disaster. If it was my project it would have stayed on the  rotisserie and gone back to sandblast to start all over, then paint,  then a different finish underneath. I sympathize with the excitement of  wanting to get a project done however it is often the case that great  builds take a lot of time for reasons.
This is coming along so awesome
Its coming together beautifully. Let me know when to send my 63' Club Coupe to you. I'll take my LS supercharged with a 6 speed. Dana's front and rear. You can even pick the paint and interior!  ATB
Man you cannot believe how happy I am when I see the progress on your build ! it's as if I also am going to drive it !! even though I live in middle east and I may never even see you in person EVER !! you are such a positive and fun person ! keep it up !
Hi matt.  Hey are you using a synthetic wax in all your nooks and crannies??  awesome build you guys, and man that rotisserie sure came in handy.  cheers
Rotisserie, ya done good ! Lol  You know you are gonna have to build one for each of your boys now Matt so I’d keep the ol rotisserie around ...  fabulous job so far btw!
Congratulations!  Nice vehicle.
Looking good.
I will be interested to see how you like to ORIs on the road and in the sand. I have specifically heard they are not great in the desert due to over heating, but it is very possible you might be fine with them as you are not racing with them so they should be under a lot less stress.  Congrats on the progress.
Congrats again on the build Matt. Now, get a Johnny Lightning of the Corvair.
Awesome group of people 😊...
You nailed the assembly with that claw hammer, can’t wait to see it on the road. Thanks for the great videos
Gonna be uncomfortable in the back
These are the ultimate "cliffhanger" videos.  We're all sooooo excited to see this thing completed and being driven.  BTW let us know how those ORIs work out.  I was looking at those online and they're like $800 each so not sure my WJ will be getting those anytime soon.
That's gonna be one incredible ride mat. Very nice.  👍🙏
I am following you from Saudi Arabia, because your videos are beautiful, you are my family 🇸🇦 ❤️ 🇺🇸
Engine in the front, that corvair won't be suitable for an ocesn going ship anchor at the port ;(
Apologize to Nate 😂😂😂✅
Congratulations MORR Team, looking forward to seeing video of this rig on the dunes !
I hope you are planning a reveal of the cost when it is finished...
This company has way too much fun.
The cool kids always sit at the back of the bus
Trevor was in the  Zone when you wanted him to leave.
Sweet video everybody.......Thanks for the Corvair update.
You could’ve bumped it over with the loose wheel and tire learned that along time ago
Nice job fellas looks well thought out
Time to move.  So nice seeing people in a restaurant without masks on.
Rudy: look at me I am the assembly manual now
This thing is going to be a beast
Looks like Lizzy's played quite a few games of cornhole in her days! that was an impressive throw.
What's an orie? Some kind of compressed air spring?
Man it's look sweet so far.
KEY WORD IN THE FUTURE IN MARS THE ROVER GETS STUCK,MATT AND CREW ARE SENT TO RESCUE IT HOW KOOL WOULD THAT BE,LOVE THE VIDEOS,MUCH LOVE FROM LOS ANGELES,C.A.
Great low-key Sunday morning watching this build. I can’t wait to see the Wagon in action!  It’s pretty bad ass. Pardon my French.
Just a little trick I learned. LoL.  Classic. I bet there's a lot more where that one came from!  🤣
thanks for sharing .
You guys get to dine in.. a restaurant....  😪 I wanna live in Utah- Oregon is a prison! Save us!
Should have used gorilla glue spray adhesive to help stick the sound deadening. I hear it's real good
Its all brand ne- "Thud" was all brand new. The story of every time I buy something that's easily scraped or dinted.
Fantastic!
Great video with my coffee. It’s getting so close!!!!
There's a saying that goes "20% of your effort gets you 80% of your results".  The problem with that is, it means the other 80% of your effort is needed to get you the final 20% of your results. I suspect that's where the Corvair is right now. :-/  +EDIT+  Should say, it looks like a work of art (I'm sure Dirt Lifestyle WOULD approve) but I bet there's still a loooong way to go.
So, with the pandemic in full swing, it’s jumps out that no one in the group wears a mask. Even when ordering your lunch (which I thought would be mandatory). Do you all live together, or have you all been tested and otherwise quarantine?  I haven’t seen any mention of anyone getting sick, so one assumes that all is fine. Just curious.
why didnt yall go coil overs? costs?
About dang time can’t wait to see it finished lol
Trevor getting it done!! Matt is just happy as can be putting together his toy!!
Love DirtlifestyleNate
why triangulated instead of parallel?
My toes are rolled up under the blanket Sunday morning with anticipation for the day we all get to see it rolled out the door. It looks 👌. And save the rotisserie for the new toe truck next year. Thanks for letting us watch!
Rotisserie...sniff...I love you man!
make sure your grease fittings are accessible...
Matt, oil the jack wheel brother!
Apparently you don´t like washers much, or thread lube for that matter (?)
Can’t wait to see it in action!!!!
Wow, that’s the beastiest corvair I’ve ever seen! Nice job, cant wait to see it out and about
YEA!
Props for the shout out to Nate from Dirt Lifestyle. He has a great channel! Almost as good as this one! 😉
Looking good 👌
Great job guy's it's looking great and some days you guy's make it look easy can't wait until she's on the road
Congrats on the  forming of a new addition to the fleet coming along nicely. be safe .
I may be as excited to see this done as you are!
Are you sure you shouldnt put more pressure into the suspension? I mean the car is not done yet, theres about 1000lbs missing from its final weight, doors, hood, front bumper, interior. Maybe its gonna be more than 1000lbs.
I just though of a name if yiu guys still looking. The color reminds me of a banana going bad when it starts to change colors and its a sister " car how about ( ROTTEN BANANA )??????? Or ( BAD BANANA) im from regina,sask  canada. I love watching you guy. Eds the coolest. My mom loved her pepsi and M&Ms. I have sister that live in Colorado. Jeep the good videos. A coming. And remember take a sledge hammer and 6 ' steel spike. When you dont have hook points for a winch.  Drive that into the ground and walk your way out. I go no were without mine on a recovery. Im only 2 w/d and i do 4x4 recoverys.  Nothing serious. Just when other services wont get them out. Have great day guys and girls
Sure looking good! Why didn't you paint the axles before installing them?
The Corvair is looking great.  It may not be difficult for you and your team to build but I am very impressed.  It's amazing how 120 minutes (roughly over time) you made a car out of various parts.  When you're done with the build I would love to see and extended video of the build starting with concept then time lapse all of the build and fabrication and concluding with the Corvair"s first recovery.
damn now I want a rock crawler RC with Matt corvair shell
Beginning to look like a vehicle again! looking good!  Is the bus one of your starting projects too?
Bead locks???
Thanks for showing us! This is pretty dope.
Not finish, and already looks awesome.
“I should have listened to Rudy”..... somehow I expect to see that clip cut into videos in the future 🤣; along with Randy regretting saying that.
One cool build 👍
Thanks for showing the progress. Greetings from the Netherlands
The only vehicle Matt has rolled many times and never scratched.
Looks bitchin!
nice
Fantastic build!
Keep the rotisserie the car has had a hard beginning. It may need the rotisserie if it’s next life is anything like it’s start.
Love the build what's next l
Where's Ed at
Not only did you get the fitting on before flaring, you didn't leave it on the wrong side of a bend unable to get to the flare. That's a double success to me!
Yeah Matt, it's looking like a "Wep" now!
What a journey and totally awesome build Matt!!👊👊
Your adventure is coming to a close and my K5 is showing up in a few... Resto/LS swap to nv4500. Now I'm just debating to build a custom dana 80 set or 14 bolt. Why Chevy people cry over Dana vs. corporate 14 bolts I'll never know.
0:40  And Matt has a sticker that says "XX" and "XXX" !
Nate seems to get more work done when Matt's sleeping.
Love it! getting close to victims and gas.
That vehicle is so BEAUTIFUL!!! Just basically FIT as F****KKK, Think I am in love x
Looking at that spaghetti mess of wires made my head hurt.   And made me glad it wasn’t me figuring it all out 😎
Nice!! Entertaining...:-)
Everybody: "I'll have a large..." Jaymie: "I'll have a small..."
That undercoating stuff you used is horrible stuff.  It will fail regularly.  Bumps and niks will cut holes into it and those holes fill up with water.  Especially since they didn't install all of it correctly.  I had to replace 90% of fuel line on a chevy with the same under coating.  The whole frame was rusting through because even though it was mid summer under the coating it was soaking wet. He said last time he hit water was almost 2 months ago. Several spots were rusted all the way through.  I'm not critisizng your choices I'm just saying for the job you do that stuff is a water collection system and it destroys metal. In other parts of the country it's probably good stuff when installed properly.
Sweetest Corvair on the planet!
It's cool how the team painted a pumpkin on the diff cover as a joke and Matt went along with the joke and didn't have them paint it over. Matt should win a Best Boss Ever award.
Great work So looking forward when you have the Beast finished. It seems like only last year that this all started.         Andy Australia
Thanks guys.  Been awesome watching the truck come together.
Nice :o) - will it be rolley into corners? Meh, probably, but great on rocks :D
Excellent job! Brilliant attitude! I love watching you guys!
I like the channel a lot but wear a fucking mask people...
The Coolvair 😁
jamie is good in throwing dollars - for big lunches - not pennies...
Matt has got to be the most unpretentious guy on Youtube.
It’s coming along nicely 👍🏼
I love the process of everything but the wiring, if I would be doing that, I'd get sidetracked 5 times for every wire there
Awesome
You guys are doing awesome!!!!!    One day I'm going to build a vehicle like this. This is literally the coolest best project I've ever seen. I suffer from project envy every time I watch another update. I am WAY too invested in this corvair....
Awesome! Greetings from Bulgaria.
Congrats on the build progress! Looking better every episode!
One of the coolest builds that I have watched! Can't wait to see it in action!.
I would l I've to put my moms 69 monza convertible next to this
The stuff usually goes on the inside
from the side trevor looks like trevor form gta 5
MATT..YANKUM ROPE ARRIVED!  WORTH THE WAIT!!  WE GOT SNOW FROM TEXAS KILLER ICE FREEZE STORM MID ATLANTIC!
Looks great!
Getting so close 😁can't wait loved the last recovery
SWEET
That bud was a little to long for that group
Buddy, please mark bolts when the torqed correctly
LOOKN GREAT 👍
Is that the corvair that was gonna be done by new year’s? That’s awesome
Can't believe how uncomfortably excited I am about this build. Thanks for bringing us along.
Probably should of done sound film inside and heat outside
It sure looks good sitting on tires at ride height.
Matt...I Love the Recovery Videos...But these Build Vids...Are GREAT.!!!
The rotisserie brought a tear to my eye.
Looking great I can not wait to see it in action soon .after you show it around
655: likely, in the future, you can grind on the centre sleeve of a wider replacement bush...   Such a cute truck, it looks fantastic 🇷🇴🇬🇧👍🏻
This truly makes me want to come to hurricaine and see this in person...i may have to visit sand hollow  from montana
I’m not a big Corvair fan.but I would really like to own that corvair .   You guys built one hell of a good looking off road machine.  I can’t wait to see what it looks like completely put together.
Rotissire
Nice shout out to Nate  Dirtlifestyle is a great channel and he's really stepped up his content.
Nice to see her sitting and rolling on all 4
Starts looking fantastic Matt and team, a real yello badboy, hard to find a New name for the monster?
Brother is this tank for recovery or just normal use pleas use this tank for recovery very interesting ❤️❤️❤️
You guys did a lot of work in this video!  I don’t think people watching will get just how much was done.  Nice job!
Take it easy on the captions.
Heck yeah I been waiting for this
Four minutes of watching your video & two minutes watching commercials I’m out......
How come y'all don't wear masks?
brilliant job , its so nice to see this coming along , great job guys
Can't help but wonder if Ralph Nader is following this build.
That looks like one sweet ride!
Couple questions, how old is Rudy? Is he related to the family?
I would love to see that machine at the end 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Awesome job guys can’t wait to see it in action
Awesome progress starting to look like an actual vehicle again! Still waiting to see who finishes first The Corsair or Paul with Dar's Jeep lol.
About time we get to see some more work on the Corvair
Ohh. I know it's already said and done, but the FatMax Rattle Trap sound deadening mat is not rated for exterior use, it's generally only for interior of the vehicle. I have been doing custom car audio for About 15 years now and have used probably about 2 football fields of the stuff, I guess we will see if it holds up, I doubt it though
You think it's going to fair better driving off the side of a trailer.... Then the banana did.. I'm going to need a reenactment..
Such an awesome build.
Really great video! Jamie should practice up for next time.
I am still watching your videos every day more interesting amd more fun and many thing for learn ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Matt if you want to know if its level, maybe run a long piece of straight metal between the front and back fender flares, like sitting on them, them set a level on top of it
Strong car for off road Matt.
You do realize we're gonna need a second collaboration with Johnny Lightning!!!
I miss the rotisserie already
Masks? What the fuck are masks?
That is one very solid sexy looking tow rig I can't wait to see it in action.
Waiting On the "First Fire".!!!
What A Unit💯💯
Every top shelf mechanic needs a good claw hammer
If lazy wasn't there, your videos wouldn't follow you
Paul Bunyan wants that rotisserie to cook his pork roast on.;)
My favorite subscribed channel right now.  Blue collar guys and gals getting cool stuff done with no yelling. Watch them all. This Covair build is awesome....
I almost shed a tear for the rotisserie...it was the music....
That rotating device made a lot the work so much easier. You should keep it.
I got a corvair chubby going on
It would be awesome if you could somehow get your hands on Fiat 126p and make an off-road version of it. Some folks done it. They're smaller than the OG Mini. If I were you I'd put the body of it on the snowcat. There were prototypes of it with tracks. (Tom Hanks got one - regular one)
Crew shot spinning on the rotisserie...priceless.
Getting close guys. Were just as excited as y'all are. Ready to see it run.
That looks good guys and girls
Love this build....are you planning on putting limiting straps on the rear suspension?
I am so excited to see this project done!!! Can't wait to see the first bit of shenanigans!!! And the first rescue!!!
Great milestone
Cool hot rod.....😎👍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I am in Canada so I'm not sure how bad things got and what kind of help the Texans are getting after the little adventure of a deep freeze up does anyone know? is there a fundraiser to help them out going on? or is it even needed?
It's looking good!
Can't wait to see the Corvair go .
i want a RC version of this 4x4 so i can do Matt stuff in my back yard with the grandkids
Can’t wait to see that out in the dunes!
It's looking GOOD matt 👌 👍
Love this channel however kind of socially irresponsible right now for an entire team to go out for lunch without masks when someone couldve delivered it.
You should patent the rotisserie stand that is great for a build
Ya got a roller..Nice job!!!!!!!!!
Looking super good guys!! Can’t wait to see it in action
looking good!
So cool! Those shocks are awesome 👏
You're getting very close to a new tow vehicle!
36 min on the web and 18k views. Not bad for a bearded towtruck driver.
Truck is absolutely sick matt.   Eat your heart out Paul (fabrats).  Watch he's gonna be building a new rig.  Neighborly competition.
You guys gave Jamie a huge break on lunch I expected steaks or BBQ. Always fun. Cheers!
Looking forward to seeing this working in the sand. 👍👍❤️
how do you work on a 4x4 and not have to bleep ever other word ?
Just a few more steps guys....))))
sound deadening lol f that. turbo that bitch
Love this build can’t wait to see how it goes on its first recovery.! 😎👍🇦🇺 pity you guys don’t have GQ Nissan patrols up there you would love em their half tank half billy goat 🐐
Awesome can't wait for it to be finished and seeing it doing some recoveries
Shouldn't the shielding be inside? It's a beast!!
Unsubscribing due to you and your families disregard to wear a mask during this global pandemic. It's not about you or what you think it's about the minimum wage fast food workers elderly family they care for.
If it can be broken I’m sure Matt will do it.
I love seeing it all come together. This is my favorite Corvair video, yet.
hmmmm, it looks like paul has more trophies...lol
I saw in one video you said you don't run a winch on you xj due to weight concerns, so in building this vehicle can't help but wonder why not implement weight saving strategies like running aluminum links, and steering rods. And I'm assuming the engine is out of a truck so it's a cast block, why not find an aluminum block and etc. Also bullet hubs for the axles I'm just seeing a lot of weight that could be shaved off..
You guys have built a tank.
So awesome can't wait to see it out on  Recovery
Ohhhh snap.... Matt that's freaking AWESOME. I've been following for a long time and watching the Corvair come together makes me miss building customs rigs. GREAT JOB sir.
Wish I had buddies around that would wrench on stuff still. Everyone stopped working on their own stuff and got out of playing with trucks. :-(
That was a big step.   Can't wait to see it in action.
Looks great, but I can't believe how big the axle link arms are, unyet how small the bolts attaching them are......
Now that looks mean and very purposeful. Looking forward to seeing it getting 'em out!
Awesome that's badass can't wait to see it driving... Keep up the good work
RIP Rotisserie
Awesome, Awesome,  Awesome!  Sema?😀
Really disappointed that you went to costa vida during a pandemic and didn't care enough about other people to wear a mask
You still have pennies down there?
great job >!!!! beatiful
It’s botchie ball with coins!! Awesome
With that music and b&w slomo video you got me all emotional over a damned rotisserie
excellent job
Trevor is becoming my favorite hahaha.
First time I have ever seen anyone use the damping foil properly by putting UNDER the car. Most people carpet the interior with the stuff not realizing that the foil does nothing on the inside.
This brightens up my rainy Sunday afternoon in  the shires of England.  One question though  -  why a Corvair
I have my 1965 442 on a homemade rotisserie made from engine stands. I long for the day I finally get the Olds off of it. Winter in Indiana has put work on it to a snail's pace.
Looking Awesome
love how they are wiping down every part and when done it's going straight to the sand, mud, and snow.!
Why not use hydro boost brake booster, instead of vacuum? The work much better.
So, I'm guessing the January 1, 2021 deadline is a no go??
Jamie is a rock star and a pretty 1 to boot.
Awesome! 👍💗
Masks? Be a good example.
I love the build videos!  You have a good team Matt.
Hey Matt's Towing!!, yes!, you are correct it's sitting on its Wheels!! But can it be powered under its own weight!! ???😮😮😮   Or including you in IT!!!😂😂😂
Nate would be ashamed 😂
That's a mad looking build
How much is this build gonna set you back. Its looking bad ass though. Can't wait for it to be done.
Are you putting different rims an tires on? Looking sweet so far ! Thought it was gonna be a little bigger
Hell yeah! Looks like the plan is coming together well. Besides the undercoating 😅
Somewhere in the year 2023: "does anybody know what happened to the pieces of the rotisserie?"
Yes, for those who love the fab Work: dirt lifestyle!!!
I guss since you are working on the building & the car a claw hammer would be standard issue.  Great job on the car, can't wait to see it finished.
@matt - should be a diesel engine in there....
Putting the sound deadening underneath on the outside bottom of the rig seems like a place where corrosion will appear. That is my only "thing" about it. But, hey it is your rig, your story, your build. Anyways it is fun to watch.
So good to see these folks having fun living life
Looks awesome.  Cant wait till done
looks good cant wait to see it run. coming to see you guys this early summer
Wow!  Best looking Corvair ever built!  What is it’s name?  It can’t just be named a Corvair!
I thought I liked the Gladiator, but then the new Bronco came out. I thought I liked the Bronco, but now there is this Corvair.
Matt and ed still never went for a roll on the rotisserie so RIP never went back and liked the vid. Also proper mechanics you never tighten a rubber bushing steering components while the suspension is dropped you will put them in a bind. I bolted a entire leaf spring axle in a 92 chevy PU and then put it on the ground. Then I loosen all the bolts on ground and the truck settled 2" lower. Loosen your upper rear shock bolts when its basically complete.
Excellent work. Love it when a plan comes together. I get the same feeling when I am almost finished with one of my trailers.
Amazing big like, i can't wait to see that in action
The Frankenvair is looking great!
maybe auction off this beast for 6 figures...start a new build again
Motorize the rotisserie and charge for rides!
Great project!  The next Corvair build will go faster because of all the lessons learned on this one.  :)
Looking good! Thanks for sharing 😎
Ooh whoa whoa, Ja-mie's buying
Getting there can't wait to see it in action
Looking good  !
We use rattle trap all the time at work, it was fun doing a 56 suburban lol lots of real estate
You know, That bus is not a bad idea to convert it into a double trailer and portable garage for the Banana and Corvair to drag them on recoveries. It would make one sweet Mobile operation base lol
At 3:15 would you just look at that....😁😁👍👍
I believe that those rear shock rods are going to bend, big time. They are too long and too thin. They should have been twice the diameter. Can you give any information on what transmission you chose and if any upgrades were done to it?
She's a roller
Enjoying the show. Thanks for not wearing mask unless you have to!!👍
Great! Good job. Background music is at a low enough volume people with hearing difficulties can make out what everyone is saying.
Niiiiice!!!
Cheers to the video editor(s), it's getting better every time. That transition from "good night" to "good morning" 👌
Great video!  Glad to see the build coming together! You guys are alot of fun!  I have to chuckle when i see the claw hammer. Have a good week MORR crew! Cheers!
Haha glad to see the progress. With those new air ride front shocks  will they not catch sand and such, causing them to wear out faster than traditional shocks?
That is one bad mamma jamma
Those quads for sale 👀
I am so excited it is like watching your Christmas gift being built.  Can't wait to see her done!!  Great job guys!
thats a bad ass ride guys great job
This was great to see. Jamie's reaction to her penny throw was funny. I think she knew she lost. And... why did Trevor buy a bus?
Looking good. I love it when a plan comes together.
I love the build so far. I apologize if you have already done it and I missed it, but is it possible for you to make lesson type of videos, like a how to for driving in different terrains or other aspects of offroading for the newbies that are trying to get into it?
Well it is nice to see it back on wheels, it's getting closer!! You will need to watch all your build videos and make an owners manual.
good  going looks great
This is beyond exciting. Can’t wait to see it in action. 👍👍👍👍. Thanks for the update.
9k views and 1k likes in 23 minutes from the time posted it's so crazy watching this channel grow so much and you guy's definitely deserve it, keep up the great content!
Lookin good
Nice .. good job  boys & girls ... don't you guys have a ball peen hammer...
👍👍
Waaaaah I didn't get no nachos.
I wanna see the bus build
Congratulations! Can’t wait for the next milestone!!!
Looks pretty amazing one the best looking lifted cars I have seen
Great job Crew!!! That Recovery Rig is looking Fantastic!
Woo Hoo! This Recovery Vehicle is going to be Awesome!
If i could have clicked a heart instead of a like i would have!
Are you going to do a public big reveal at Sand Hollow or another awesome location?  My boys and I would love to drive down to check it out...  Awesome build!
An absolute thing of beauty !!  Congratulations on the rapid approach to completion...and the first ride.
There’s so many camera angles in each video and it’s well edited. Props to the camera team!
Hey!  Isn't that the same bus Westen Champlin drove into a tree a few weeks ago??  Good progress on the build.  With Rudy as the manual, y'all should be able to finish sometime in 2022.  ;-)
So so cool.....I'm tryin to help from Wisconsin....but it's not going any faster for ya !!.....lol....I'm getting excited with you guy's  !!!......BTW....does everyone notice that Lizzy is there to eat BUT seldom twists wrenches??.....lol.....jk Lizzy
There are way way to many commercials on this blog bro
In loving memory of the rotisserie you will be missed
I think Nate will over look it.
Who knows?. Maybe it will work.
Whoever dislikes these videos needs help.
Looks great
Great B&W sequence, amazing what emotion can be created with some excellent editing and music choices.
Paul's FIL Grandpa Dar's YJ has Ories too
Darn Skippy I haven't heard that in a while.
Anyone that’s done this type of work, have you been nervous about how the doors are going to fit.?
So we built a Corvair...
Anyone else accidentally read the title as major roadblocks?
Congratulations 🎉👏👏👏🎉
Travis to Trevor: Be sure to use Tesa tape on all the wiring ; )
Looks awesome I can't wait to see it done.
I have used Rattletrap on a couple of cars but we always put it on the inside on the floor.  will this not delaminate over time if it is exposed to the element's?
Great job guys that’s a hard project waiting so long from building to disassembly and back to reassembling all those parts in the correct order
Cool to see it getting Thier. Also cool one of your guys is building a skoolie. (School bus rv) building one myself right now. Road2_river insta if you wan to see it grt built.
Matt: "oh, crap Jamie and I have joint bank accounts; so I'M buying everyone lunch!"
LuV FrM inDiA 🇮🇳🇮🇳
Damn it`s starting to look awesome! Doing a great job on this build fellas!
Man that is looking great.
When you are bogging along at slow speed/high engine power you are going to wish you put insulation under those stainless steel heat shields , air gap needs air flow to work .. what an amazing and wonderful job you have done, great fun to watch your ingenuity and fabrication  skills <3
RIP, rotisserie. Hahahahaha that was awesome. 😅😅
Boy it's looking good! 👍
I love the memorial for the rotisserie lol.  Personally id put the rear shocks in the other way around, with the body at the bottom.  If backing into a rock or something, id rather it hit the body of the shock than the shaft.  Id rather a dented body than a bent shaft.
It’ll be interesting to see if it actually outperforms the XJ after it’s all done.
I'm going to be so upset if this thing doesn't come out right lol. Like if it's gutless or sinks immediately
ThTs badass. Can’t wait to see this thing do some recoveries.
Very good progress keep up the good work
"I'm proud of it, and I want the world to know that I did it the first try!" 😂
Nice to see Matt with his Tappy Tappy hammer again.
Trevor has a trademark now!
Lol, I loved the rotisserie farewell. The Corvair is looking sweet!
Just like the A team when they modified a vehicle...where's the machine guns going to be mounted?
It is beautiful. Good work. But I still think it is gona weight a thousand tons.
Oh my God I can't wait to see it fully fully done... Good job bro 👏
Oh pumpkin?!?
you get to pick your VIN?
whomever the first person is who gets rescued by the new vehicle should get a new "Launch Edition version" of the  I made a call t-shirt!
Trevor is one that gets more done if left alone.  The talking shows Things down down.
Lol, Ladd Brindley bought a bus and calls it the Brindley Bus. He took us around Cedar to look at Christmas lights.
How about once the Corvair is up and running the XJ gets rebuilt?
Nice
Looking better and meaner by the day thanks great build
My Boss always calls me the milk man. When I take to long on a job😂😂😂
I mean technically you both paid for lunch lol
Time to get wrenching
Awesome Sunday surprise!
That's looking sick!
Best tank ever
3:15 your welcome y’all
"Nominal"???? (6:51). Somebody's been watching a lot of rocket launches LOL.
Need to build a couple of these and offer Matt’s off-road safaris! 😈
U gooding to under coat this unit so doesnt rust.
You need to christen it with champagne when it first drives away!!!
I got that same steering wheel. Luckily your air is not humid as all get out like Georgia cause the chrome flakes some
would have helped to have rear wheels steer as well!!
Gotta go to work.  :-(  Can't watch now.  I'm sure it's gonna be good.
Thanks for the update Team MORR! It just occurs to a guy that it seems a rockin beard is required to work on the Corvair. 😂
Awesome
That rotisserie can still make some good bbq!
5 mins ago upload gettn closer lol
3:15 I’m sorry I didn’t hear ya.
Why didn’t you build a tricked out grand wagoner? Like all you and your gear are gonna fit in a corvair wagon 🤣
Hi Matt from west Alabama hugssss
i like nates plug
Looks awesome
NASA should contact you to build their next mars rover. Lol
The memorial for the rotisserie was hilarious. 😂
Matt, love your videos... particularly these build videos.   Your are a lucky man  to have a son like Rudy... and he is a lucky son to have a Dad like you!
Every time I see that thing I have one thought, cramped seat, sore back.
I cant wait for this to be finished
I thought dyno mat needs to be inside the vehicle.. well thats where ive installed it
Is that a Supra?
You had me very sad with the “Farewell” to the rotisserie.
'Looking Good "  😄👍.
Great Job Matt and the Crew
i want to be a favorite viewer... i mean 2 minutes after posting has to be a record
Good crew
The Corvair is looking awesome!  That rotisserie is proving to be very handy.  How can you plan to take such a masterpiece into the desert and get it banged up?  Should be a show car!  LOL!
:o
Send trevor to watch Vice Grip Garage for some lingo upgrade. Derrick is a great inspiration!
.LOOKIN' GOOD...STAY SAFE...
I would love to have the skills and tools to build my ultimate off-road vehicle.   So cool when you know every square inch of what is transporting you off-road.  I'm very technical, but not in the automotive area and so I admire this stuff.
How long have you guys been working on that
Just a quick note, aluminium is a better reflector for radiant heat than stainless steel - regardless of surface finish. Just saying
Great videos
This is the best proyect ever seen on YouTube 🤯..
Good luck cool build!
That transition @ 2:26 was great. Cut is visible on re-watch, but p entertaining on first impression
Congrats!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Are you guys freaking kidding me? The sound Mat goes on the INSIDE of the car.... you really don’t know what you’re doing. This proves it. Sound mat will NEVER stay stuck in the elements.
Good morning!
Genuinely curious, why the heat shields? We’re these vehicles known for absorbing a ton of heat into the cabin? Personally, I’ll be surprised if those whether time...
This is gonna be one seriously good looking/good working truck man. Keep it up!
wow i’m early
Woo!!
Yahoo. Im giddy
Straight to the comments to 👁👁 what the experts have to say.
The best part of my day is when i see a notification that you have put a new video out! Keep up the great work!
Love the progress!  I can hardly wait to see this ripper in action!
Awesome 👍😎
Notification squad
Good morning all.
First
2nd
First ;)
