This video was chaos! What's your favourite moment? Leave your time stamps below 👇
i am stupid ￼ 1:14
Ria sounds like those British auction sellers lol 😂
Is good
@F1andfootballfan144
This is so relaxing BRAKE!  -charles leclerc
rias voice is so annoying wth
max sounds like a disappointed driving instructor
Drive then... WHERE? Forward... 🙄
“You’re doing charles leclerc” 😭😭😭😭
6:13 uhmmmm ...... BREAK ! 😂
You weady
Ngakak gede
This is my favorite video on the internet. I lose it every time max says. FORWARD. 😂
“Drive then” “Where” “FORWARD” 🤦‍♂️😂😂😂
7:54 😂💀
Lando using his hands to show where to go as if he can see😂😂😂
It’s sad that they actually have a blindfold on and they drive the car horribly, but I just do that on a day-to-day basis, playing F1 22 without a blindfold on
8:26
max shouts in small case. cute.
i feel like Max is just band at giving instructions, whenever really anything happens, Lando's voice just goes extremely high as well as doing hand gestures as if Max can see them and realise he needs to turn a bit more to straighten up, and it takes Ria a second to realise what's happening (she's saying right as in "yeah nice" but Aarava's hearing "turn right!") - that's Quadrant summed up to me I think.
you guys need real jobs
8:27
Ria is my fav driver
Lando and Ria would make such a cute couple♥
Why is the in game not moving
Lando giving hand signals to blindfolded Max might be my favorite part of this madness =)
El nano no se hubiera equivocado
'' You've done a Charles Leclerc'' 🤣🤣🤣
Rrrrrrrrright Llllllllllleft
nobody: gasly's pre-race warm up routine:
Yous should do this in monaco
Norris is the best pilot of the world🥰🏎
It's amazing even blindfolded or can barely see through the hood. People still think based on where they think they are on track, they can ignore or delay instructions from a sighted person lol
navigator is shit
I wonder how good a rally co driver would be at directing the blindfolded person
Lando Norris is by far the funniest guy in F1 of the last decades👍
why is the girl saying everything in eminem mode
Anyone not gonna talk about how they have turning off the wheel isn’t turning
I like how he wears that silly RM watch for sponsor reasons but at home he whips out his pespi rolex :)
8:47 LANDOOOOO
These 2 are the perfect duo
hahahhahahah it's charles leclerc
gasley whould be so gooood here
Lando and Max are like the two rally drivers in the rally react video
I think max messed him up at the start. Saying he was on the kerb made Lando think he was on the left.
All new respect for rally teams lol
is lando deaf?
Was this practice for the 5 point turn in Baku?
Its like he is driving a Williams
8:26 😂😂😂😂
Maybe Lando should be given directions like rally co-driver. Kimi might have done it 🤣
when Ria said left to aarava he shit him self
Should do blindfold at Singapore or Monaco
"Drive then." "Where?"  "FORWARD!"   absolutely hilarious 1:21
Almost and painful to watch as Lando's pit in Canada this week
Max: Drive then.  Lando: WHERE??!!?!?!? Max: forward.
Lando's sporting a very nice Rolex GMT Master II Pepsi here!
Lando 'you done a Charles leclerc' 😄
5:00  i am stupid
I love lando
8:27 i just wheezed omg not the grandstands
But a bad day
Max's " wtf was that " had me rolling
That was a heck of an impact Let me know you are OK  Are you alright?,Engine off,Engine off  Are you OK?,That was a nasty hit,turn the engine off and wait for the marshals  What happened?,Let me know you are OK
Lando trying to sabotage max’s lap 😂😂
Why is the wheel in game not moving?
8.29 what the f was that have I just gone in to a grandstand hilarious max 🤗
Give dynamo the magician ago, p1 🤣 I'm sure he lapped a track blinded folded irl
I think lando has forgotten how to wear a cap he always wears it backwards, next he will be wearing his shoes the wrong way around.
i dont think ive ever laughed so hard in my life hahaha
🟥✋CALM DOWN🟥✋😠
jogo f1 2022 esta muito ruim. esta diferente vida real
lando lando pls u have to listen to what im saying.........tripple concussion......TRIPPPPLE CONCUSIONN!!!!!.........lando ur breaking the car
Mans combover has me feeling uncomfortable 😳
Lando should do this with his race engineer Will. 😁
"44 Still I Rise" lmaoooo😭
Do this at Monaco in full wet
I couldn't stop laughing when lando lost his shit. Great content.
8:26 hahahahaha
Shouts in Lando voice: “Left, left, LEFT!”
3:58 Women
I love how Lando A FULL TIME F1 RACER Came last
Damn Lando breathe
6:04 "Are you weady?"
"Drive then..." "WHERE" *"FORWARD."*
01:19 *first gear*  *..... **_silence_*  "Drive then..." "wHeRe?!" "FORWARD"  I died
@8:27 watching again and again it's hilarious 😂😂
Wake up   Jesus is coming back a lot of people have been ignoring the warnings since 2020 and the only person you’re hurting by doing that is yourself and you’re family   God is doing so much and has done so much for you to wake up and understand the times and season you’re living in so you can repent and be saved   it’s like the days of noah. God sending his servants in love because God loves you to warn you before judgment comes and yes of course human nature   Human beings ignoring God just like the days Noah mockers and scoffers laughing at the preaching of the word  scoffing at the preachers and persecuting those that come in love and share in love   scoffing at the word of God and all this scoffing and mocking even after all that you’ve seen since 2020 and have experienced  Yet everyday life continuing people oblivious to the coming judgement upon this world like the days of noah and ignoring everything that they’ve seen and are seeing   ignoring the fact that there’s a war happening in Ukraine which could potentially lead to nuclear war also ignoring the fact that Israel is about to go to war with Iran and China is about to go to war with Twain   Ignoring the fact that food prices are rising aswell as fuel prices there’s talks of worldwide famines by 2023 new diseases monkeypox after we just had a virus cause havoc on this world for two years and now we have a new one   yet people are choosing to ignore all this signs when the bible told you that this would happen in the last days  A time prophesied by Jesus - a time worser then anything that’s happened  in this world yet you can still be saved out of that time and out of the tribulation and it’s only through Jesus that you can be saved from the wrath to come and from hell and from eternal Separation from God because of you’re sins for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus   you’re in the middle of a spiritual warfare light - against -darkness and you have no idea how great or wicked that darkness is nor what that darkness is doing or planning for you   the Lord Jesus Christ is coming back to judge this world and to put everything right  God’s will is for all to be saved and for none to perish but time is running out this is not the time to be running away from God but rather to God and for my brothers and sisters in Christ   my fellow Christians don’t play church you’re either with Christ or you’re not beloved. Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.  you’re either in the light or in the darkness you’re either on Gods side or Satan’s side beloved Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.  Beloved You have to pick up you’re cross and follow Jesus and deny yourself daily and crucify your flesh daily and be holy because God is holy offer you’re body as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing unto God beloved strive i repeat strive ! to enter through the narrow gate for many will try but will not be able too   This message is shared out of love to everyone so you can be saved   So Repent and give you’re life to Jesus accept him as you’re Lord and saviour and receive forgiveness and salvation through Christ Jesus    Acts 4.12  And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved   John 14:6 6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me  God bless
I don't know what shocks me more. The fact that you think playing F1 blindfolded is good content or the fact that nearly 300k people have watched this. Social media is slowly making everyone a retard.
it started so promising after that first corner! 😂
"kee goi'n kee goi'n" that girl is speaking english in french
F1 youtube media should try this content with the drivers, it will be hilarious.
Ria is hot jus sayin
7:54  Dacha44 is going to have a field day with this one, lmao
Ria doing turn 15 perfectly while blindfolded...sad Lance stroll noises😂
“It’s got nothing to do with the driver, it’s all to do with the instructor”
Why isnt lando his strearing wheel streating
Liked by pierregasly
Just direct he usage of the steering wheel using the time on a clock. 12pm is straight, 3pm = 90 degree right turn, 9pm to the left. 1pm slight right, 11pm slight left. 'Hard left followed by soft right' is much harder than '9pm, 1pm' . Everybody knows the exact angles of a clock.
latifi: whats wrong with this video?
Now we know how it feels to drive like Nicolas Latifi
Damn Lando really chose that Latifi line there
Not lando showing himself the direction while laughing
Ria did Sector 1 better blindfolded than she would with eyes.
🪳🪳🪳 - “Drive then” - “WHEEEERE” - “forward”🫥 💀💀💀💀This fucking had me
Let's all take a minute to appreciate what Jeremy did on the old Top Gear with a blind man :D
It’s like they’ve been kidnapped and force to play f1 lmaoooo
should be using rally pace notes. maybe for the next video? ;)
8:06 ReVEEERSE😂
He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.   (John 14:21) - Repent. Jesus is coming soon.
Hahaha funny...!
I will see you in Canada lando
haha "still i rise"
Guys... You know that now we need more of this right? 😂 That content >>>
Oh no, you've done a Charles Lechair.
You know it's getting serious when landos voice goes up by like 3 octaves 😂😂
8:29 LOL
Max and Lando in one Video is just always Chaos 😂😂
If this was filmed before the Azerbaijan GP week, I think we know why Lando did that 5 point turn 🤣
Hysterical. Crying
EA\Codemasters: "We want to make this game as realistic as possible." This video:
12:25  Lando insists that Mclaren is the 4th fastest car on the grid.
Bbbbbbbrrrbbrra brak brake brake, leeft elft left left left
This is how I take the Castle section when I'm not blindfolded.
Now drive.. where?! FORWARD 😂😂😂
This is the funniest video yet.
Lando's laugh is so infectious  🤣
He crashes like nico hulkenberg
Imagin doing that at monaco
Online lobbies be like
“You’ve done a Charles Leclerc” LANDO😂
Max is so salty lol
7:54 “You’ve done a Charles LeClerc”  Brutal, mate
“Well the real F1 car you don’t have to turn the much”  One of the few people in the world who can say that.
you did a Charles Leclerc 7:55 lmao
Tia’s lead foot is both a blessing and a curse here lol
I love how Ria points at the screen for Aarav like he can see the screen🤣
I think you might be better off using right, left, and center for driver call outs. Otherwise you just overload the blindfolded driver making them mess up more. 👍
this was so chaotic but so funny. awesome vid team Q !
This must be how F1 race engineers feel when they talk to their drivers.
Is that a rolex not a richard mille
I love that within the first 30 seconds we already get chaotic bickering between Max and Lando lmao
Wow Lando is really obsessed with F1! He trained so hard really make me feel like he could be the future champion of F1
30 seconds in and Lando has alr done a Hamilton 😂
max telling lando to calm down is just so funny 😂😂
Imagine saying "It's nothing to do with the driver" to Sebastian loeb.
Is Lando ok?
“You have done a Charles Leclerc” Savage lando
07:52 You‘ve done a Charles Leclerc lmaoooo
Bro using a Rolex instead of RM😂
7:54 "you're gonna Charles Leclerc" LOL
I love how Lando is always shouting and Max is trying to be very calm hahaha
4:57 that ''i am stupid'' flashbacks
Ria looks fast, I don't get where she lost so much time. Probably went for a coffee while going off track
Now we know why Lando showcased a 5-point turn lesson in Baku...filming this was giving him freaking flashbacks mate!💀
Ria seemed much faster!
from Patagonia Argentina hug landó  one of the pilots I admire
7:53 You're doing a Charles Leclerc lmaoooo iM aM sTuPiD...
Love all you guys!!! You have such a fab vibe together 💚
“We’re not in a real car are we” 💀💀💀
I love the dedication that go into thes vids love y’all ❤️❤️
"You didn't turn enough for T1" "Well that's how much you turn in the real car!"  The ultimate flex
Ok I didn't expect Lando to post the slowest time.
Oh this is too good 😂😂 “you’ve done a Charles leclerc” lmaooo we all thought it
7:52 "you've done a Charles Leclerc" lmao, the infamous "I am stupid"
Bro the guider for Landon sucks god danm
Must of been a lot of editing because Ria's run looked way quicker than anyone else. lol
Lando got in the stuck in the same place during Qualifying lol, maybe the game was giving him a sign.
Charles Leclerc perplexed as Lando gets through the castle section blindfolded
lando getting away at the end
LEFT!...accelerate. - Max Fewtrell 2022
does lando not remeber the track???? this is almost embarasing
"44 still i rise mate" LOL
7:53 "you've done a Charles Leclerc!" fantastic 😂😂
Ria's corners were actually best executed
How Max even managed to decipher what Lando was saying is beyond me
Im so suprised they didnt punch each other at one point haha :D
#SuperLando
Can we have 100% force feedback challenge on Baku in a Mercedes W13? The miami helmet design might be useful too to wear I reckon 😜
Title should have been pro truck driver teachers a f1 driver
They should get daniel ric on one of these videos as a special guess
Costing zach brown alot of money
4:59 7:53 he did a Leclerc
Oh boy, I laughed so bad on this with my wife 😂 At the beginning I wanted a race with Max as Lando’s engineer…but when they switched places it was even more fun. Loved it, absolutely loved it 🤣🤣🤣 P.S: Lando, can you get a podium for my wife this weekend? Counting on you 😏
Yeah can’t see the point of that.
When is Lando gong to come out?
I like how Aarav has the racing line on blindfolded
Why does it look like when they hit the wall the wheel does not respond? No force feedback?
this is how i do baku but not blindfold
be better of telling them the 200, 100, 50 metre boards and then turn right or left
This is the stupidest video ever
1:32 I don't know if he literally meant he hit the apex!
8:26 "have i just gone into a grand stand!?" 😂🤣
Lando was still quicker than Mazapin last year
Would the dirt rally directions help? 200, break into 1 right, into 6 left
Explains the 5 step reverse 😂😂😂
8:26 for a repeated stomachache 😂
Lando master of walls
Seeing the pepsi there Lando, great taste brother 🤩
Screaming contest lol
"Drive." "WHERE?!" "Forward."
This needs to be on grill the grid with teams having both drivers times combined.
‘You did a Charles Leclerc’ 🤣🤣
The you’re doing charles leclerc just got me 🥹😂
Guys, do the blindfold Monaco, or Jeddah 😂😂😂
Dude omggg lmao..i never laughed this much on watching some random f1 video..i need some break.
Do this with a rally driver and their reader... pretty sure they would nail this.
Mate Lando Norris what are you doing your a formula 1 driver not a go kart racer how have you gone slower than ria who doesn't even play f1 on a daily basis anyways nice job team
Bro get a life
"Is all to do with instructor" said the instructor that achieve fastest time.
He found rev pretty easily there, huh?
'F1 22'   Thanks EA 😐
Lando at the end " It's not the driver mate it's the instructor."😅
This is by far the best Quadrant video so far.
Baku looks beautiful. Cant wait to play the game
imagine Hunt plating this blindfold game :))
rate the trim
Love how Max turns to Lando and shows him where to drive and what to do even the other is blindfolded :-D
Swear aarav has a bad hair day everyday of the week now
“Drive then.” “Where?!!!” “Forward.” Lmao
This dude is toxic to landos development as a driver, what rubbish
Must be annoying to be the one blindfolded
Lol, awesome video! So much fun)) Max is the best instructor ❤️‍🔥
This video is hilarious especially Lando and Max I couldn’t stop laughing 😂🤣 definitely made my day 💚
this was hilarious, i laughed non stop, thanks guys🤣🤣
Yk, I would love to see the whole F1 field actually do this, like Lando and Daniel doing this and see the comedy that'd come out of it. Like each team does this and then we see how well the team mates are able to communicate and how well some drivers know the track
F1: Breaks its own rules to ensure Lewis Hamilton is defeated  Norris since he's bezzies with Verstappen: * this video *
“you did a charles leclerc” 😭😭😭😭
lando your a different breed
Lando you need to leave McLaren and join red bull
“You’ve done a Charles Leclerc” 💀
"You have just done a Charles Leclerc"
I have not seen Lando Laugh like this since the Famous Press Conference 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is the man I cheer on every fucking Sunday oh dear
Why lando is a driver and not a race engineer😂
9:59 “44, still I rise mate” fucking killed me 😂
Good now go blindfold Riccardo, so he can let you pass him
Drink every time Max saying “Yea, now we are on the wall”
@7:53 "You're doing charles leclerc" mateeee 😂
This was hilarious
It is kinda rally but only co-driver can see.
Should do this in real life
New favourite Quadrant video- just screams chaos 😂
Lando is the best driver
arava wearing wig
90 flasbacks
4:35 the energy of Ria is immaculate with her “ foward foward foward,brake brake brake,right right right,nice nice nice”
Lando should do this again in Belgium
Every video contains laughter and fun. Another crazy video
I approve of this video        Now give me likes
great memories haha
6:16 - for reference YOUTUBE!! Lando saying "BREAK!" does NOT mean "launch an advert"!!!
Quadrant you are the best I love you lando
this is stupped why baku he can choose another track baku is hard
0:50 "Samir, listen to my calls!"
I love how Max showed Lando the track first LMAO
I love how Max always always turns and looks at lando, even though he has his hood up😂😂
WHAT THE NIGGA
Nikita Mazepin : Look what they need to mimic a fraction of my power
okay this is probably my new favourite quadrant video hahah
2:14 “Never mind…let’s do that again”🧘‍♀️
lol max has terrible directions.
Brilliant job love you guys
“Drive!!!” “Where?!?” “FORWARD!”
lando be drippy af
this video made my day better hahaha, this was pure chaos

This video was chaos! What's your favourite moment? Leave your time stamps below 👇
hell yeah i’m one of the early ones 😎😎
Hi guys 💚
Lando and Max, our favourite married 80years old couple
WOW this is amazing
Nice
Max is that sarcastic older sibling that thinks they’re in charge of their siblings when their parents are away 😂
As soon as lando puts his blindfold on:  shouts as if he has lost his mouth and not his vision
good vid guys
😈😈
1:22 forward ! 😂😂😂😂
e
Return or a classic
Quadrant the goats
Love your videos Quadrant and good luck in Canada Lando
When you are so good at driving you do it blindfolded.
Incredible
Cool, now in real life 😃
Mahaveer In baku-u-u
