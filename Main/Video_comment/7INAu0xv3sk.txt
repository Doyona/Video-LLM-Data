50 is a different level to this guy he shouldn’t be on the track he spoils it. 50 sounds dope on this track we want more 🥳💯👌
Got that old Big Daddy Kane Beat i see you Fif
What is that series
Can’t go wrong with Mary Jane Girls “All Night Long” beat, but those generation needs to learn how to ride a beat.  Choppa’s flow was tight but lost its fire bc it didn’t pop right.
I’m a Hustler 💅🏾
50.. UNTOUCHABLE❗️👌🔥🔥🔥

Okay, this right here is 🔥 I see you 50

Clean e30s
Nobody can tell me I can’t see, and express how blk ppl are moving to date going into 2023. Racism is alive and well 50 cent or not. And blk folk only still focused on jewelry, $$$ and white excepted stats with how we are calculated in a racist government for themselves. Get it.
I could listen to her voice over and over like I do my best voice singers: Aretha Franklin, Sam Cooke, Donny Hathaway/and Layla, Gladyis Knight, David Ruffin, Marvin Gaye, Roberta Flack, Twinkie Clark, Shirley Caesar, Cisco, KC-Jodeci, Al Green, Jasmine Sullivan.   Other levels: Rance Allen, Fantasia, Patty LaBelle, Chaka Khan , Eddie Le Vert, gospel preacher’s. They like to yell and scream. I like ppl singers who just, sing without all the yelling.

E31,E30 & E36 just went up in value to you regular people they’re all bimmers 🤷🏽‍♂️

Let me tell you my story guys. We all know what Illuminati is. These people are into what you call total Mind control. They are a victim who are part of it, or they are victimizing other. They play that so called play with their Mind rule. That why most or some of the people you hear saying things like that are part of what you called this stuff. These people 90 or more of the time exist in the spirit world as a spirit. I am talking about being here in your physical form and also having more than oneself which the rest of them not the physical exists in the spirit world. That’s what 50 cent have, and I have witnessed that and have been victimized by these spirits because they want me to join the so-called Illuminati Group which is nothing other than that of who worship the devil and the anti-Christ. That’s what they claim they are but really their truth is further beyond that. To the point the believe they are gods themselves too. And I will tell you nothing of what they are isn't any good at all. They got the mass and majority people believing this is all they all about but the believe the Do what that You want to believe and can tell you anything they like at any point because they consider that is the right way of being and they would Manipulate you to believing what they say is actually Looks and sounds good. I mean the can even use good words to say bad things because they believe any word can mean anything it just depends on how and what you're saying. I can say to some extent that this can be true that maybe the word word can mean something somewhere in some language, but you know what I mean. So, my point is these people do all there is ever to do that they have done is this world is so they can get total mind control of your brain. I mean by that their goal is they want to control everything you think. And even to make you to the point of not thinking anything and just living your life off of what you know. So, you don’t solve your problems. You think and one chance is that you could find solution or other chances you might do worse. But who want to risk someone thinking good if you’re a person who is evil and don’t what someone think positive things and achieve positive outcomes. So don’t want to go on but be careful of so-called famous people and some of the things they do such as entertainments. Not saying all but there are a lot of them out here there.
If sunrise made a sound it'd be like Rileyy Lanez artist ☀️🌅🌄🌇🎶

🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 Rei 💥
this song grows on you, nostalgic af
I never get a chance to watch power, but I'm loving this song
Ouvindo essa música me lembra quando era mas jovem 15 anos de idade só ouvia 50 center  Hoje ainda sou fã dele
They put a spell on this song😭
Don’t get caught without the pipe all night lurkin on sight. ? That shit not even a complete train of thought
Why did he just have Keyshia Cole sing this! It's all love still a great song! 👌🏽❤
Brazil here's!!! Sound top forever 🙅🏿‍♂️
How the hell he make a song sound like it was made back when he was poppin
50 is the SH-T when it comes to re-mix!!!!  I personally can appreciate when y'all yungins sample our old school music 🎶.  Most of you probably didn't know that this original song back in the 80's was called "All Night Long" by the Mary Jane Girls.  They were a girl group that sang backup & were produced by none other than.....#RickJames!!!  Well done 50😁😁😁
That Bass Line...  Wow...  Cant tell if that was from Rick James or Patrice Rushen..  Great Job, all connected to this hit...  Really gets you in the mood to watch the show...
cars fire tho
🔥🔥🔥
This is to good
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

SOUTHSIDE!!!!! That’s my favorite part of the whole song!!!

00:10 can someone explain this musically ?
If the Young Generation is not Learning from 50cent, Dr Dre, Jay Z, Beyonce, Eminem, Jimmy Iovine, and their teams or people who worked hard on these brands then just know you F*%ked
50 cent songs are a bangers
The man who once ruled the charts.
I thought this was Keyshia Cole in the feat.  guess I was wrong. Still a dope song though
I thought Joey badass would’ve been in this
Dats Dat Heat🔥🔥
Ngl I initially thought NLE fucked the song up but it grew on me and it’s 🔥
The Man still has it ... recognized !!! #Leavenodoubt ★
Brazilya 2021
THIS SHIT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  50 was always hard when he came in  that’s facts
Thanks to this shit. I am who I am ..
did fifty mention preme in this?
Че за фильм ?
Love The Hook! I'm almost 63 years old  I'm old but I Ain't Cold! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Keyshia cole putting some spices 🔥
I CAN’T BELIEVE HE POST THIS SONG AS THE INTRO SONG OF POWER BOOK 3 RAISING KANAN
need an album like this. Cant stand the nonsense wishy washy rap of today
What’s the year and models of them beamers I’m tryna price them
Show 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🔥🎶🎵🕺🏾
pops back in the house
YOOOO THIS JUST PROVES 50 STILL GOT IT AN HES A LEGENDARY KING! THAT BEAT? 🔥 🔥 🔥 He could of left the new school off tho! Yes I said it!
So addicted, in ❤️ wit 50 and all them Power series.
Nle comes with new rap vybe.... And ruins the fucking song...  50 u goated g🔥✌🏾
This song is the 💣💣💣 raise your hand 🙋‍♀️ if 'raising kanan' got you here!
Straight Slapper 😎👌
This that fire..if 50 drops an album in 2021-22 I gaurantee its sells atleast 5x platinum...maybe he waiting on that 20 year anniversary of G.R.O.D.T.. cha ching!
Only 50 for ever💪
50 is back
Maravillosas canciones 🎶🎶😎
My husbands boyfriend said that 50 Cent was shot 17 times. Is this true?
This shit hard!!💪🏽🔥🔥🔥
A whole vibe❤️
Absolute Fire 🔥
this song so hard
Keni Burke shit
50 true legend of RAP N HIP HOP 🙏🏾👊🏾💯
Whether if it’s 50 or Kanan I’m glad he knows how to put on some of these kids from this new generation I see y’all haters talking crazy about NLE Choppa but he brought a different flow for this then usual! 50 made him do that!  Also shoutout to lil Tariq, young Kanan , and most definitely JOEY Effin BADASS I know he couldn’t wait to be broadcasted on some 90’s ish like this and he is killing it so far!!!
Épico
Is very very nice song for year
This tune is top so underrated it’s a crime that can never be forgotten, it should be standing at NO1 it’s gold love the classic cars in the vid 💥
I like this! I rewinded the show at least five times just to here the intro. The R&B vibe and the beat throughout the song is money, it takes you back to the 90's when hip hop was pure. However, when this young cat gets on the track I just fast forward it a bit. 50, if this is a OG song about Kanan in the 90's, get another OG on the track. Other than that, this track is HOT. Mane rap used to sound like this...
Fatty Cent
I think the concept of the this song is in comparison to how Kanan's story started on power just from the lyrics of the very first verse he reflects how he is after but NLE choppas part is the young Wild Kanan who is just getting in the game anyway he can.
Ite 50! I see you
Nothing against the other guys in the song but can you do a remake solo please <3
thats som nice bmws
Love you My 50 CENT ❤️❤️
Just seen NEW power that brough me here!! Jheez what a feel good song!
I gotta take it 🔥🔥🔥🔥
🤯🤯💯💯🔥🔥🔥
Love the Mary Jane Girls sample !!
I get LL Cool J vibe
This must become a hit!
That 7 series bmw hard asf
So "FRESH" old school vibes🙌🏾...press play and let's the music play😏
This sound is very cool portraying the reality of the favela, broken! the sound is too heavy, too much show, I listen directly to the American rappers I like the most is 50 cent, 2PAc, Eminen, Notorios Big, Ice Cube, Eazy-E !
choppas verse reminds me of gta actually this whole song reminds me of gta
Boy ian heard this 50 in a long time my boy been having fun on this track he need to keep dropping shit like this 🔥🔥
This shit 🔥
If “In My Hood” was more Pop, this is what it would sound like.
That's why 50 is NO1 in my top 10 rappers and he will.allways be no 1 for me
Foda pai
We need another ALBUM 🤦🏼‍♂️🙌🏼😎50 ASAP
Nice !!!👍🏽❤️
All Night Long Jeeezz 2021 okay 50!
Jayz would've been perfect for this song wish he was featured instead of NL whatever his name is. 😏

50 cent depois de anos continua afiado dmais
this man is one of legends of rap
When I heard this on the radio I was like he sound like the 50 cent from the g unit dj whoo kid mixtapes
exactly like 2000s
Just realized that Kevin from Snowfall is in the video, He's more than likely going to be a important character in power raising kanan, Might even be breeze?. I find it pre dope they got Malcom Mays for the show, He will definitely fill whatever role they give him well.
No doubt NLE Choppa  definitely did his thug thizzle on this and one  thing sure 50 knew exactly what he  was doing o.g good nigha shit nle Choppa blew up after this
Gangsta shit
50 Cent , THE TOP VERSATILE AND MOST TALENTED HIP HOP/RAPPER  OF THIS CENTURY. LAID THE FOUNDATION OF GANGSTA RAP, PAVED THE WAY FOR COUNTLESS MALE AND FEMALE ARTISTS, MOST OF ALL CROSSED OVER TO HOLLYWOOD.
which movie
Shits fire as fuck more of this pls

Ol skool beat 50 cent flavor sprinkled I remember he said in hate it or love it should he sell dope for a 4 finger ring one of them gold ropes and he has 3 gold ropes in this video. Said all that to say he perserved, he organized his way and with every talent he giving his original..his verses his voice. Many hits for at least two decades. Hate it or love it

50 got back in his musical bag with this one. Lovin the old school vibe💜
Too bad under Joe Biden's tax blind he's going to be worth $0.50
Hello everyone, I'm China, I would like to ask for help from you, I want to become a famous musician.  people music. Now I'm moving into the soundcloud, in VK for the time under the nickname Whose TEA
I think NLE merc’d it. I mean I’m not a fan of pop smoke’s not sure how he woulda did here. I think his verse was fire. Didn’t notice him off beat, then again I’m from the school where Silk the Shocker was banging and that fool was just never on it. It worked for him though. My only problem is he reminds me so much of Yaz a.k.a Hakeem from Empire.
so good to hear my main man 50 back on his bs again!
I Love old soul Beats
That choppa guy ruins the flow of this song, it would have been much better without him on it
<3 Like !

How's it feel to be 25 cent now?
Hate when folks complain good music aint been made anymore. Good music IS out there, folks (expecially young ones) just don't show love/support .THEY are killing it.... These kids only support mainstream tiktok ,pill poppin, rainbow coloured bs while good classic material like this one goes unnoticed. And old folks just don't show love to ANYthign new, they just live back in the dayz...SMDH wish they made more stuff like ths
*No Rolls, no Bentley, JUST CLASSIC !*
Who else saw NLE record this on live?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥fuck ya

50 Nice bro ❤❤❤❤❤👑👑💪💪
90s cars so gangster
Galera aqui pira quando toco 50 cent
This just makes me want to listen to  Ty$  Jermiha and Mihty LOL
NLE can't ride the beat, he is totally off ... this new generation is horrible
I was always wondering why exactly I’m not a fan of today’s rap and this song finally gave me my answer. I mean aside from the fact that the beats are trash have y’all ever noticed how many rappers now have very high voices? They all sound like Lil Wayne on auto tune. Like how whatever his name does it on this song or Roddy Ricch does it on Ballin’. That sh*t is mad annoying. I like how deep 50’s voice is. That’s probably why I like Pop Smoke more than any new rapper out there
I love that 900 Turbo Sabb
Classic!
Hi 50
Im super fan of 50
finally something for my old ass ...
I love this Man
Brasil
50cent should do a new song with eminem

(42) And [mention] when the angels said, "O Mary, indeed Allāh has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the worlds (43) O Mary, be devoutly obedient to your Lord and prostrate and bow with those who bow [in prayer] (44) That is from the news of the unseen which We reveal to you, [O Muḥammad]. And you were not with them when they cast their pens[124] as to which of them should be responsible for Mary. Nor were you with them when they disputed (45) [And mention] when the angels said, "O Mary, indeed Allāh gives you good tidings of a word[125] from Him, whose name will be the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary - distinguished in this world and the Hereafter and among those brought near [to Allāh] (46) He will speak to the people in the cradle and in maturity and will be of the righteous. (47) She said, "My Lord, how will I have a child when no man has touched me?" [The angel] said, "Such is Allāh; He creates what He wills. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, 'Be,' and it is. (48) And He will teach him writing and wisdom[126] and the Torah and the Gospel (49) And [make him] a messenger to the Children of Israel, [who will say], 'Indeed I have come to you with a sign from your Lord in that I design for you from clay [that which is] like the form of a bird, then I breathe into it and it becomes a bird by permission of Allāh. And I cure the blind [from birth] and the leper, and I give life to the dead - by permission of Allāh. And I inform you of what you eat and what you store in your houses. Indeed in that is a sign for you, if you are believers  (50) And [I have come] confirming what was before me of the Torah and to make lawful for you some of what was forbidden to you. And I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear Allāh and obey me.   (51) Indeed, Allāh is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is the straight path

Véi esse cara é monstro será q sou o único brasileiro a assistir os rap dele mano

50 always picks the best simplistic beasts. He should have put Nishoba P. on this track. Check out how he killed the Ski Mask Way Beat: https://youtu.be/eeaEuR9Ahbo
Fire...

The bass in the background slaps
Make money, 50 cent you do all.will see you one day one day.you're king 👑.
You mean to tell me after of all the years of successful business ventures and  living an upscale lifestyle, you can only inspire the youth to sell drugs and kill people?🤔🤷🏾‍♂️
Just realized that Kevin from Snowfall is in the video, He's more than likely going to be a important character in power raising kanan, Might even be breeze?. I find it pre dope they got Malcom Mays for the show, He will definitely fill whatever role they give him well.
50 cent one of the greatest .. South side . NY .
🇵🇪😎👌
90's vibe 👍🏾
He had a scope on it but he hit him close range 💯💯🤙🔥
🔥🔥🔥

Love this ❤️🔥🔥🔥
That Keni Burke sample goes with rap verses like peanut butter goes with jelly. Vintage hip-hop, and I'm not even into fiddy like that. Sounds like it came right out of mid 90's New York.
50 Cent is definitely the best and most gangster rapper mogul of all time. Nuff said. P.S. Hopefully this gets to 1billion views like "In Da Club".
Algum 🇧🇷 de olho nessa música ja
50 Cent uma lenda do Hip Hop, sou seu fã dês da minha infância, Salve São Paulo SP- Brasil...

All these New Yorkers say they’re the king of New York when 50 still alive? He a GOAT💯💯

Get Rich or Die Tryin
This looks like a trailer of a Netflix show. It’s hard ngl 💯 NLE choppa should drop more music like this
He brought back the 90s with this beat.
Make this the new POWER2 song 🤷🏾‍♂️
კარგი ხარ Fifty

50 still killing it
Папка в игру вернулся) эх жалко что я не в школе . (( В ней были ик порты и блютузы (((

Damn NLE actually went crazy I was waiting for him to kill the vibe but he went perfectly with this one 🔥🔥🔥
Love it, great to see you making hit songs again. Keep it up.
This is hitmaking Fif.
Thanks to 50 Cent, I raised on his music!
Come on 50 be more active, we want more music from u
Damn that brings back early 2000 vibes
Not sure where all the 50 praise has come from. He sang all through this for me, let's see if you can rap still. A track with busta or Joyner Lucas would go down a treat
Rick Ross who Damm 50 what took u so look
It's all apart of the game.. facts
South Africa looooooooooooves 50 Cent. ❤️
50 dope other kid ain't nice

🔥🔥🎶🎶
0:42 BeatBox?
The beat is good
fiddy a heat maker
its a hit
Dave East would've been 🔥🔥🔥🔥 on this
Say what you want about 50! Every one is entitled to their opinion, that doesn't make you a bad person... As far as I'm concerned to maintain the status of an Icon, one (has to) maintain relevant for years. One of the best still doing this shit... #theunit #GGGGGGunit! #Iconliving💯
Classic 50 Cent
Type of rap songs that I luv
fifty should have just did all did three verses himself
🔥🔥🔥🔥 get back to this
Guys ! check out my content !

Oooooooowiiiiiiiiii that’s a mf vibeeeeeee 🔥
It has been a while since 50 made a hit song but glad that he did
We need all the old school hip hop artists to jump on this vibe like 50 and make hip hop great again
I get what fif was trying to do and I fw some of NLE music (especially that walk em down joint 🔥) but Idk just don't feel like he was the right fit for this type of beat, just sounded a lil out of place, still a dope song tho
Wow 50 with da #OldSchoolEscense
🔥
Play this joint side by side to LL’s “around the way girl” and you with see where the inspiration came from! 50 in the Kango subliminally paying homage to Cool James🙌🤘
1:11 is him Joey Bada$$?
Book of Kanan is gonna be fuckin gold
50 tá gordinho ..
Sooo dope! Just woke up at the end of the song and realised it's 2021! So I hit play again and travel back to the good old day's ⏪
I know Pop Smoke would have loved this song
Old 50 love it
50 still gotta it
Banger!! Classic old school beat!!
I'm going to wipe off the dust from my speakers, turn them on and vibe to this one for a few hours.

Genial 🔥 🇪🇨
The Best rap song out right now 🔥🔥🔥
Never been a big fifty fan, at least his particular style. But, this is one smoooooth tune, kicking it old school. And I didn't know he had excellent taste in cars, rocking classic Bimmers. Saw a few other sweet modern classics. This gets a thumbs up from me.
fire af hi future me
Soooooo New Skool Rappers can rap over real production and sound good??? 🔥🔥🔥🔥 They don’t need those WEAK TRAP BEATS!!! Good Sh!t NLE 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fitty... still a G since 98 Respect. But man they pushing this BS 80s theme way to much man. Slow it down...
Dang I thought that he couldn't make another hit hey halla back officer ricky
50cent, you will always be number one in my book. I'm 65 years old. Loved from the beginning ❤ always will
50 is the power. Another Classic
Wow! 50 still got it!! Just as good as his classics of the 2000s
He shoulda put nba youngboynoy on here i aint a fan of youngboy but he woulda killed on this instead of nle
There's a major lane for this sound again....the demo is 40 plus though...small demo but 40 plus got way more money than the 20 year olds....and as we should.
Sharks in the water
Luv his voice❤️
when KrsOne said - 50cent is HipHop- this is all about that, so thankful for these vibes
50 cent and Rick Ross should just do a versus

50 never went no whr 2021
We put a big bag on your head😈😈for that wonder bread your dead😬😬😆when he said that i felt that👑
Anybody can rap everyone can't make a song that's what separates 50 from most artist he know's how to make music and he doesn't get enough credit for his ability to make hooks no stop 50 is top 5 lowkey💯
The original record is "Risin' To The Top" by Keni Burke. 50 always had a great ear for the classics and making them his own
This shit bangs summeners!
A Classic Massacre😈😈👑🙌👍😳
Ha! Right after Rick Ross claims 50 can't make anymore hits, we get hit with this.🤣😂 He's laughing straight to the bank with this. Ha-ha!
Fire 🔥🔥
Mostro o melhor gangster rapper  de todos ✌🙏💪

🤩❤💯💣
Much love G brining the old school shit.
I wonder if this will be the intro song to Raising Kanan. It'll be a breath of fresh air from Big Rich Town.
nle was spinning on this beat...
this is 50 how we love him!!!!
This song is fire and cold. I love it. This song is a massive hit and banger. The flow, beat, sound, delivery and rhythm is hard. Already a classic 🔥🔥🌪🌪🎶🎶✊🏾✊🏾🧨🧨💿📀💽🖤👍🏾🚀💨

If 50 were to stick to the fundamentals, his classic flow still has a buzz. Smh
It’s a good song and it’s definitely is a vibe but not a hit hit like every one is saying
Pop smoke woulda mocked this beat with 50  The son he never had
50 Man U gotta hit me up so I can give u beats like this again
This is fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This would have been a brilliant track if it was just 50 on it. These others dudes sound lame as fuck. They just shat all over 50’s vibe on this.
Lmao he making the girl in the background sing like its 2004
I'm actually mad that Joey Bada$$ is acting in this and not rapping ‼️
Like by bernadetteskygoddess

DOPE, i've missed 50 on his rap-singy thingy!
50 YOU STILL YOUNG, MUCH LOVE 🔥🔥🔥
In all honesty fifty is one of the most important artist of the past 2 decades with classics like this it’s hard to debate.

NLE choppa fucked up the vibe🤔 it should have just been 50 cent
This could have been so much better without nle choppa and I was actually hoping he killed this as well 🤦🏽‍♂️ other than that it’s 🔥🔥🔥 I just wished he didn’t sound like he was almost tryna keep up with the tune, I wish he just vibed with it like 50 👌🏽

50 CENT MY FAVORITE RAPPA 2004 UPTO NOW
@debra watley its a japanese skin lightening lotion. It says in the article the african american celebrities in hollywood use it  because its strong & actually changes their skin color from dark skin to light skin mixed race,however they deny it https://matsuiskinlightening.com/products/bleaching-skin-lightening-orange-peeling-lotion-100-ml-top-selling-product  i guess they deny using this  lotion because they just want people to think they are naturally light skinned and not bleaching their skin lighter, people should  really just be honest.
50 cent ain’t loss his  talent he’s getting better with age
Mumble rappers have left the chat

Love it
Can someone give me the original sample of the beat??🔥
Hey 50. Where you at? You amending your karma I hope. Stand in you beliefs. Many close to us will try and steer us off our path. You feel truth of it inside. Anyway, something for your audience if I may. Cube got it as well. Before we get started I'd like to talk about the current energetic terrain because it has been very challenging. Given the absolute chaos and energetic intensity during the last weeks that have been accumulating pressure in the planet's fields, this has been a very challenging time for many people. For some of us on the Spiritual Awakening path especially for those of us that do Grid Work or Energy Session Work this time has been filled with a tremendous amount of dark aggression, psychic warfare, consciousness wiping, 3D entrapment scenarios - everything and the kitchen sink that the regressive entities and dark forces use as a weapon to target and harm Star Seeded or Indigo people. Please know that you're not alone in this and that this is a global agenda towards those of us on the awakening path.  Since the magnetic peak my guidance has informed me to stay very low, going inward. When this guidance comes in to stay very low on the radar it's the same as when an animal is being hunted for food by predators. In many cases the animal being hunted gets very still and conserves energy. When you are being attacked aggressively you must learn to conserve energy and not extend yourself or put yourself in high-risk places or with high-risk people.  During this time I have been viewing portals of black hole systems that lead into a phantom matrix system called the Wesedrak looking for vulnerabilities where these black hole systems and reversal portals are connected into the damaged areas of the Earth body. As a result this can be tracked to Satanic Agendas playing out on the Earth surface seeing how these extremely dark creatures from the black hole systems are conjuring black magic, Satanic Ritual Abuse to become more active in the Earth people that are weakened or asleep. These forces have told the Satanists and the Satanic Church to go and open black portals in certain areas of the Earth in order to get black hole systems opened directly in certain demographic areas.  It is important for you to realize that practicing Satanists exist everywhere at the highest echelons of political and governmental control. These power elite are those who pull the strings in many cases and are enmeshed with these Satanic Agendas at different degrees. Some are totally into the rituals or are ritual-ists while others agree to carry out satanic strategies and are complicit with the spreading of Satanism into the mainstream world to desensitize people to accept Satanism otherwise known as anti-human values in order to make Satanism mainstream and accepted by the masses. As an example there are mainstream publications that print articles to sympathize with pedophiles attempting to label sex with children as just another sexual preference.  Currently in the USA there is a Satanic Agenda to take complete and total control over the Office of the Presidency. These many groups of Satanists believe that they are building black houses, that they are building the Satanic structures that will hold some of the most ancient, old spiritual aspects of prominent Satanists in previous timelines and they are attempting to open the black holes, open the portals which allow these satanic creatures, some human and some non-human and reptilian to take over human bodies for their intended rule over the planet. I think it is worthwhile to note that this is an aggressive agenda now to take over male bodies that they feel that have a genetic preference in order to vacate the sole occupant and use that body for full possession. It seems that they hold value or status for the genetics of the family of Michael so they have been attacking this lineage more aggressively trying to gain access over the body in assorted ways.  The Satanists believe they are waiting for their Satanic god or more appropriate, the Beast, the pinnacle of hedonistic pleasures of the flesh to come to the Earth to rule it completely and take possession over the physical human bodies - very similar to the prophecies of the anti-Christ taking over the Earth. They are trying to fulfil that prophecy now to change the future timelines of the Earth. Hence, Satanists are trying to open the gates of hell for Satan, which actually is ripping open holes in the phantom matrix areas and it seems that some are aware this is for giving more access to the negative aliens or they believe they're opening the black holes for the collective consciousness of Satanism itself.  These black forces leading back to the parallel black hole system are spinning misinformation to Light Workers or vulnerable people generally getting them to attack others to play out victimizer dramas to breed extreme confusion, chaos and paranoia at every level. For some people it's very hard to place their trust anywhere at this time because these distortions and deceptions are very heavy with an agenda to create chaos so people cannot tell what is real or what is false. This is a gas lighting manipulation technique to destroy the inner spiritual compass or the heart guidance of the people. Please pay attention and see this working in the mainstream. If you can see it when it’s playing out you can clear it, you can move around it so it does not impact you.  This time has been taken advantage of by these black hole creatures to direct as much black force, parasites, fears to the Light Bearers especially targeting Star People to attempt to slow them down, discourage them, stimulate persecution, victimization and despair and even attacks against our loved ones. When we remember that the agenda to suck the Earth down into the black hole system has been a long standing threat of intimidation from these satanic creatures and negative alien invaders its obvious they're still pounding on that agenda to trick us and subvert our real selves from activating our highest potentials.  Stay strong and do not let these creatures get you down.  They are desperate and clawing for any way to make inroads. We are slowly separating from these black hole systems. Guardian teams have been working on installing over-ride pillar gates to handle transits at the death exit cycle and to help stabilize the Earth grids. We are progressing but we are in a deeply disturbing evolution phase because the mass unconsciousness of human pain surfaces and this can feel like massive tidal waves of blackness. It can feel overwhelming by the emotional body of an empathic or sensitive person. Many of us can feel the satanic forces working their angles to get a stronger foothold in this reality. We cannot succumb to these forces. We have to see them as they are. Whether they exist inside people or not do not judge the human being. See the force behind them. See the force controlling them and call it what it is. These forces are parasites, psychopaths, sociopaths, emotional illiterates, tyrants, unable to feel empathy for any living creature and are driven by the most primitive levels of profanity and base desires with no impulse control. In this phase of bifurcation as we travel the span of realms opened into these black hole systems it is a rough time. Put on the armor of God, Universal Creator, Allah, Higher Self, or Source (name does not matter, only divides) and stand together as one. Keep believing 50. Mend those resentments The Collective
Please confirm if this is TUPAC!!!!!😩https://youtu.be/axK-1vF01Wg

#PutNLEChoppaOnOldSchoolBeats2021
Because of the increasing rate that prophecy is being fulfilled, this world is quickly coming to a close. The great tribulation is about to begin, the worst time this world will ever know. God the Father wants to have a relationship with His creation. But everyone is born into sin and we need a way for us to be able to live eternally with the Father in heaven. Jesus made that way. Even though He is God, He left heaven and came to earth to be a sacrifice for a lost world. He never sinned. He was abandoned by His friends, was betrayed by Judas and handed over to be crucified. He was beaten so badly that He could not be recognized as a man. Then He willingly suffered an agonizing drawn out death on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised Him from the dead. And now He sits at the right hand of the Father and He is coming back any day now to Take home those who belong to Him. Just believe that He died for your sins.  You don't have to repent of sins. People who teach that, are wrong and they are not saved.  You don't have to give up drinking or drugs, etc. Just have faith that Jesus fully paid the price. After you are saved rest in Jesus' sacrifice. God will guide you and help you get rid of bad habits and to do good works according to His will. If you think you should do works, you're saying Jesus' sacrifice was not enough. Faith plus works will NOT save you. Once you believe that Jesus died for your sins, you will receive the Holy Spirit and you are sealed for eternity. Nothing you do or don't do can cause you to lose your salvation. Those who say that you can lose it are not saved. There is nothing we can do! It's all about what Jesus did! God gave us free will but He is a just God.  Rejecting salvation means an agonizing eternity in hell! In the great tribulation, the age of grace will be over and to be saved you must believe on Jesus plus resist taking the mark of the beast. Believe on Jesus now and you will escape having to go through the great tribulation!         I will try to answer if you have any questions.        For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16
oh those killer bmw's got me in love! these days looks really rare

hi I hope you are doing fine. I make music but it's really tough to have visibility when you're little, but I do my best to make my art known. I invite you to discover my beats and if you are not disappointed, do not hesitate to subscribe and share with your friends ;)
Fuck yeah !
Does this mean we might get a follow up to the Kanan tape?

This song go hard. That 80s early 90s dope boy vibe. Damn 50 smh you killed it with this.
Nah, worth one listen and just throw it in the “never again” pile. Sad 50 can’t get back to what made him a hip hop giant and just keep dropping these average tracks. They aren’t bad, they just don’t hit you hard enough.
hey Nas...

My God, this is Perfect man ❤️
REAL HIP HOP
50 cents back baby!!!
50Cent and the 90s ❤️ ❤️ #2021
Wow the real gangsta is back❤
🔥
Feels like we’re back in 2002
Who would have thought fifty would still bless us with new music
Wish lloyd banks was wit 50. NLE not bad but not for this type of old skhool beat. Mixtapevibes
Next time wear Bitcoin chains..😆
من تونس احلی فيفتي سانت 💥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 this gives me old fiddy get rich or die tryin vibe!!!!
Is this his best song of all time?
50 is back
I agree 💎 🔸️ 💎
I was shol waitin' on *Curtis* to drop this iaint even see *Bryson* 😂😂🔥
Should have been 50 and Nas!
50 killed his part..
50 cent in addition to being recognized as the best in the world you are a living legend when it comes to good rap in 2021 cool
50 going on his Old school  vibe i love it
Stick to Battle Rappin Fifth
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 50 did his thing on this shout out to  this young bro on this track and sister is killin the hook
This a summer time vibe 🔥🔥
damn all my samples getting used tho
Nle Choppa Hot 🔥
NLE sounds just like NBA YoungBoy smh all these young rappers sound the same!
🎶❤️

real king new york!!!!!! og!!!!
yeah  my man cant do this shit again
This NLE guys verse shouldn't have been on this track.. yeah he spits good but it doesn't fit the mood of the song AT ALL. It's not a "hype" song, it's one of those chill laid back smooth ass songs that you play in the whip when you're cruising and it makes you FEEL like you driving one of those Bimmers in the video.  Also, all you youngins that can't understand that without a doubt don't even realize the bassline is a sample from the Mary Jane Girls - All Night Long. Old school beat, old school vibes fit with old school rapping, not this auto tune yelling shit.  Like I said, he spits good it just kinda kills the song for me.
BMW  ///M Power
Somebody put J Hus and Pop Smoke on this pleeeeaaaassssseee!

50 Cent the first mumble rapper 😂😂😂
This song made me drive with good mood to work 🔥👑
Am I the only one who sees this is the theme song to Raisin Kanan? The actors are all there in the video, especially the guy who is playing Kanan. That wasn't a movie clip, 50 been posting pictures of that guy who is supposed to play him and he's right there in front of all of y'all eyes. Not to mention that 50 said that the theme song was going reminisce late 80's/mid 90's and this did.
He looks like a $1 now
50 is back
I thought 50 cent WA stead but ok
Fifty still got it!!
Finnaly,50cent remembered his YouTube  pasword after years
Look at 50 face in this,he know people gone love it,good to see an og still getting love,one of the greatest
The word “NLE CHOPPA” should be nowhere near this groove 😂
Old school driving in that old school bmw e30 fireee 🔥🔥

i literally cannot wait until Raising Kanan comes out. I know it's going to be so good.
This dude got shot 9 time s but still alive, his a legend.
Now choppa was rapping this on live a couple months ago
If you believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God and he died on the cross for your sins, ye shall be saved. Romans 10:9
I prayerfully believe that one day 50 Cent, will eventually recognize that his strong comeback was predestined by God. And he’ll boldly use his platform for the Lord’s purpose, to help change the things he can.
50 use to be good but his new shit ain't as good as his song many men
Beat so smooth I can taste velour in my mouth.
finally the classic beats are back
This is your time. I know the plan I have for you. Jeremiah 19:11  To those whom are Lost: give your heart and soul, to the one who created Life and Love. Rom 10:9

Literally 99% won’t see this but I lost my job due to covid. They shut down all the restaurants in Cook county which then led me to loosing my apartment. I'm currently living out of my car which I try and make the best of. I've applied to a bunch of places I'm hoping to get a call back. if anyone could help me with whatever you could bc I'm needing stuff like hand warmers which I stuff my clothes at night when it's cold. Also cheap burgers/fastfood. I know times are tough for everyone these days but if you're able to help me I have paypal user name pay2winlife  If you're unable to help I totally understand  God bless you stay safe 🙏

THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION: Will you go to Heaven when you die? Have you lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain, or lusted (which Jesus said was adultery, Mt. 5:28)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins, you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there's good news. Though we broke God's Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life" (Jn. 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (Eph. 2:8,9). Then, to show your gratitude, read the Bible daily and obey it, join a Christian church, and be baptized. Visit NeedGod.com and LivingWaters.com
Rides wise its 80's..  Chains.. 80's..  Kangol.. 80's..  Sample.. 70's..  Chorus.. 90's Vibe.. early 90's The man... 50 Hotel.. 🤐

Is 50 Cent releasing a new movie or is this a movie song ?
50 cent only on this would be mint
These Beemas from the 90´s are the best!
How to stop listening 🎧 ????
As a 50 fan it sucks. Dude said he had an album ready to go even before jay dropped 4:44. But instead of giving fans what they want he releases a lukewarm song every now and then. We want redemption for that trash ass streetking album. All i want is proof that one of my favourite rappers hasnt gotten washed up and fell of but it sure starting to look like it. Smfh dont make me say rick ross was right cuz id fking hate to give officer ross credit.
Take a shot everytime the bucket hat changes
Where is the old 50?
Can we please bring flame ass beats like this BACK !!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
jheez 50 Cent wiv the 90s vibe 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love the classic rides
I hope y’all give 50 his flowers while he’s still here to smell them!!! This man is a music genius, his whole catalog is skip proof
This my new favorite song would of been all time beat if it had STYLES P!!!!!

Funny how People be looking for an old 50th when everyone else changed and they not the same as they came.
50 Cent is my OG ....He´s been with me since I was 13and today I am 27. Always making bangers seasoned with soul and spice. ♥♥
NLE kinda ruined it for me ngl
Hip Hop is still alive thanks fif.
50 cent chante et charme 🔥💯
Cool track to the series with an episode about fifty.We are waiting for the release of the series. As always on top.
I thought he made this song cause of what ross said recently lol
Not nle choppa on this beat, didn’t mix well eventhough hes hard right now
50's back! Just need more now! Come on 50, keep producing!
varygood
I like NLE's part. It sound so southern and I'm from the south so I was really feeling his part.
wohhhthis song is a lit OGDM
NLE fucked up the song like wtf
50 did that real easy
This song is wack AF and trying to stay relevant by putting NLE on it just proves he's reachin all 50 cent makes now are trash ass songs sorry but sit down Fif
Anyone else came to look at all the classic BMWS while jamming to 50 or is it just me
it's so good to hear new things from him. thank you 50 cent
🔥
Nice😌
I thought choppa would be ass on here but he really used his sound well.  Shit turned out dope
Why does this take me back to the 90's with the likes of Peter Rock and CL Smooth, DJ Premier and diggin in the crates? 😍
U know the show finna be a banger when the rap cold ash
Ain’t heard Put on that new 50 in years 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
50 cent is back
I think that 50 cent is too old for a new school, after 20 years he does in the same style as before, now it is not relevant, besides, he is trying to attract the former glory to himself as young performers like NLE Choppa. I'm sorry to admit, but the 50 cent era is over, and he needs to understand that.
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL HIP POP ...... 💯🎶🥵 50 cent 💰
NLE choppa fire man😭
I Like this
He Back

He is the best in detecting lies and knowing the truth about infidelity, plus he can get you any type of information you need on any device. Ethical cyber helped me get a direct link to monitor all the activities on my husband’s phone any time of the day which makes it a very good evidence to show my man of his long time infidelities activities that i wasn't able to uncover all these years, but his lying days are over now and im glad i met this guy who was able to help me sort this out with ease, it was like magic guys, Under 45 minutes I submitted my request, he was already done as soon as I provided the required details. i have promised him to share this great privilege with people out here that needs the same approach on any device hacking service, you can contact him via (ethicalcyber90 a t g m a i l c o m  or whatsapp No +1 731 325 7573/Text +1 707 278 6129)

Only thing this song missing in Mary J
Repent and believe in the Gospel of Jesus Christ before it's too late, God loves you!   For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;   Romans 3:23 KJV   But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.   Romans 5:8 KJV   For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.   Romans 6:23 KJV   that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.   Romans 10:9 NKJV   For God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.   John 3:16 KJV     God loves you, Jesus loves you! Repent and believe in Jesus Christ today with a sincere heart in faith, and by the grace of God you will inherit the gift of eternal life! If you believe in Jesus you will NEVER die! (John 11:25) God bless you!
Wow, what another intriguing and memorable collaboration. I really admire this dynamic, they both shine with the lyrics.
NLE came on right, 50 is goat

NLE CHOPPA I GOT DA BONZE LIKE 👍🏼 A CARTER
50 out of lyrics or should I say limited vocabulary.
the look in 50 eye like he dnt really want to make music anymore? am i rght or wrong?..
Honest opinion, love 50 but not feeling this I mean the visuals are good but it just sounds dated.
I’m tellin ya🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why are y’all hating on Nle he’s accomplished a lot at age 18. The haters just don’t want to see someone young succeed.
50 wearing them SKIMS🙃
Can always bump a 50 track queens

A fucking goat among men
Yo use esa instrumental el 2019 en mi álbum en el track (2 Corazón) WTF!? 😂😂😂 buen gusto fifty 😎
1:52- 2:15 flowing, do more like that nle
50cent
Sounds like a Ja-Rule and JLO cut😂
imagine if pop smoke was on this track instead of nle...   no disrespect to nle though
Still love 50
I’m tearing up because this is so damn hard and classic 50 cent 🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think NLE did a decent job but third verse should have been Banks. The "He had a scope on him, but he hit him close range" line was fire tho.
50 so sexy 😍
It's okay, nothing spectacular
Here cause of Nle
Chopper verse was trash to me... he didn’t fit wit the song or beat 🤷🏾‍♂️
......classic 🥂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That sounds like Keisha Kole.. Straight up
Huge NY flow here!!  This remind me of the Massacre era 50. NLE verse definitely hits better than expected.
yo givethanks fif keep them coming please, shouts to nle chop & riley lanez respect pull up again
It’s 50 🩸❤️❤️❤️
Nice bucket hats.
50 sit down these new kids don't understand you.
Why 50 wearing that old wack played out jesus piece??😭😂😂😂😂 The whole jewelry set look like it came from the middle of the mall.😂😂😂

50 coulda got his own spitting image son to play young Kanan. But w.e.
50 cent got that old money he getting big on. He ain’t even touch the new money

NO MATTER WHAT ABOUT 50 CURTIS EARNED IT & DESERVED IT DON'T HESITATE TO PARTICIPATE VIEWING HIS ABC SHOW ALSO.YALL STUCC ON STARZ
That bass line tho real 90s stuff..👍🏾👍🏾💪🏿
This is so 90s and fits perfectly with the era the show is set in.  Makes you want to put it on repeat   A gritty street story over a smooth 50 flow and that legendary bass in the Keni Burke, Dougie Fresh, and Mary Jane Girls sample. How about getting Mary J, who is now part of the Power Universe, on a remix of this song!
Like it!
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Showing respect for the BMW E31I have the same car in black.

50 is the best Hook man ever
50 CENT IN THE RAP HALL OF FAME💎
Real 50 vibes!!!
Nle choppas part was from his live
NLE Choppa’s sound in this song was the best I’ve ever heard.
Comeback
50 just leveled up NLE ... that NLE flow was sick 🤒
Raising Kanan is gonna be so sad....
This is revenge for Rick Ross' comment LOL
Wish 50 really focused on making music. He could deliver something amazing if he just sat and focused.
Nle did not belong in this song. I like nle but he ruined this.
Living that vintage BMWs
Need more up lifting grinding music like this 2021 salute 50 for this type of vibe again
50 cent has an unusual flow that is melodic and smooth 👌 😎... #legend

Fitty now a thicc boi
Where is the substance in rap nowadays? That's right nowhere. A bunch of mumbo jumbo words that mean nothing. Rap is making the new generations dumb and illiterate.
50 a genius cause now Power can compete with the Wu tang saga series for a classic style NY series show
is that a actual film in the music video ???
Mary Jane Girls- All night long...
Slap
Instant classic
• How name this film ?
This is what rap needs
Fuck da new school :))

I wish pop smoke would of been on this and biggie

50 cent for me is very good in the rhyme, the guy does well. Until today I listen to his old songs, I miss complete songs, lyrics, melodic choruses and a nostalgic beat.
I can't wait to see "get rich or die trying" the tv show.

It’s 50!!!!
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
I just want Riley lanez Adlibs on the instrumental for 3 min

I wish that "NLE" or whoever it is, wouldn't be in this song.. pure garbage

NLE Choppa really ruins this song. The auto tune becomes overwhelming listening to his verse. Dude needs to work on his real voice.
Those are some clean BMW's. Wonder if the E30 'vert is his or the E31.

2.1k dislikes ain"t the part the game!
Hey 💜I hope you’re having a great day.  Hopefully this comment gives you hope. The state of the world is alarming. Many people feel uneasy about everything that’s going on. The root of every single problem is evil aka sin. Any of us could die any second but where would we go after? Well, because of our sin and evil ways, we deserve to go to hell. The Bible states in Romans 6:23 “For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” BUT WAIT! I have some good news for you. God has offered us a chance to go to heaven and have everlasting life by sending his only Son Jesus Christ into the world to die on the cross for our sins. John 3:16 says “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” That was a true display of love. Repent and Surrender your life to Christ today before it’s too late.
NLE always come through on a feature

Old School 50 cent is back
Ok 50 dabs, nice sound, BRING THIS SOUND BACK, FORSAKE THE MUMMBLERS, WHO AGREES?
I hope everyone is having a good day and happy new year! S.T.S
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Starting off the year just right.
Hope this is book 3 intro
Shouldnt of had NLE choppa on this. It woulda been better

Off topic but those BMWs on BBS wheels looked fucking dope

I like this choppa verse can’t lie 👌🏾
Personally i think the song should have been a bit darker instrumentally given that its a show about kanan. This beat and the melodies are way too up beat and positive
Negl this guy is just too goated right now
Loving this
OMG EIF RIVEIRA THIS SHITTY PRODUCER AGAIN. WHEN IS 50 GONNA DROP HIM.   HIS CUTSCENES ARE SO FAST AND SHIT. I HATE 50'S MUSIC VIDEOS BECAUSE OF HIM.

2021 started off with such great misery and sufferings. I thought 2020 was bad enough. I don't know if I can survive. I cannot deal with my own heartbreaks and setbacks.. I just don't have it in me. That's why I look up to you, 50 Cent. Your music somehow lift my spirits. Thank you for this
Love that yellow BMW!  Video is awesome! 🥜
Fire!!!!
Old bimmers i love it !!!
🎧🎶

Ole skool feature New skool 🔥 🔥 🔥
50 and Nle 🔥🔥

I love old 50! <3
2021 just got better
Μεγαλε 50! Thumbs up From Greece! Ολοι απο Ελλαδα εδω!
50!
Don’t know if I could consider this 21 or 20 but this definitely the catchiest hook I heard all year
50 is king. If he releases an album he can overtake industry easily. We see it on Eminem's example. People are tired of fake hip hip, it's obvious. I mean people over 25 years old. Some classis features , some respectable new faces and that's it. Animal ambition was good
J hus wearing a bucket hat is a b tec 50cent
The BMW's 😍
🔥🔥🔥
First Part is part of the game second part is kinda lame. Would be a 10/10 without the kid screaming
this right here lookin like a movie

Happy he is back.. I m tired of mumble Rappers
Anyone know what movie this is?
Yoooo back in the 90s 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This that hungry 50 and NLE is fire #love it

50 need to stop make music with trash rappers. They always holding him back. Just leach of artist like Eminem lol. 50 so nice its crazy but he always give people a chance to eat. Love him for that but its holding him back.
From music to water to games to films to tv shows. To more music 🔥 this guy ain’t ever gonna go broke

Literally to the 1% who's reading this, God bless you , stay safe and have a wonderful month
Хорош
50 cent is so genius, that he make well in TV, doing STARZ up each time more. And in parts of musics i no need say, each song is a hit!! He's a KING
50 fat !!
El chamaco rrapea 👌💪🔥🔥🙌👍 #fabianelcasanova
Bmw 850 style eazy e 🎶🎵
Dear 50 cent this type of old school rap died long time ago and im so sad and happy in the same time to hear it again
Weak Stuff , still I see kids who think its hard , it's nowhere near "In my hood" / "What up Gangsta" . 50 can go very hard , but sometimes he does what mainstream PC crowd wants.....much respect for 50 though he's still got it , but it's not old school [ if you think it is then u r probably born after 2000's]
50 cent is a KING!!! Each song, is a one hit!!!!
Good Music 🎶
(d[-_-]b) XXXTENTACION (d[-_-]b)
I understand him trying to put a young rapper on the track to get that  young generation to appeal and listen to his music. Classic beats and don't really go well with the off beat the flow of the new generation. He should have went with a new generation lyrical rapper with old flow , Young M.A , A boogie , Dave East , Nino man.......
Top 10 king 50cent
Not gonna lie 50 cent is low key deep and relatable also most importantly he sticks to the theme of the song while keeping it grounded New guy has a cool new flow and I like it but he doesn’t stay with the theme of the song also kind of shallow and dreamy like he on cloud nine lying his ass off to don’t bitches lol but You know a rapper made it when he doesn’t need a chain for us to respect him (21 savage you sold your shot pre maturely lol) and 50 on that level now and forever Still like the new flow but theme of your rap was all over the place instead of in tune with the songs theme
https://youtu.be/OHxDsM-VZRc
this is fire 🎯

The Real 50 CENT <3<3
50, in Australia most us think your a snitch! Because of the beef with “The Game” and half the rap game! You went quiet like a boneyard dog which led us to believe you write statements?! Wtf are you a “G” or just a wanna be named after Real G?! We all know who the “Real Fifty Cent” is and here is Oz it sounds like couldn’t even stand near his shadow or you’d get robbed like you’ve been done against and agin even in you “McMansion” with all you fbi and security guards bro wtf
Grrr

50 has had bangers recently besides this but all stayed underground. Glad to see this trending 🔥 🔥
Gone are the days...
For real tho NLE didn't adapt like he knows on this beat, he's too loud and has bad flow for this kinda vibe 🤷🏻‍♂️

This song is FIRE minus NLE Choppa's offbeat, generic verse. 50 doesn't need to collab with anyone. Please just put out a new album with this vibe 50!
Definitely a vibe

Producer: Do y'all remember the old school days of hip hop  50Cent: Hold my vitamin water nigga                 🔥️🔥️🔥
Okayyy 50, I see you playboy back on yo BS 😂 let em’ know then 💯
I didn't know about this track
Isaiah 43:11 I, I am the Lord, and besides me there is no savior. John 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. Matthew 28:19 Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Galatians 1:8-9 But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed. Revelation 22:18-19 I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are written in this book. #antichrist #falseprophets #bibleprophecy #john1010 Matthew 24:24 For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect.
Wow

No hate but I think this could have been just as fine without NLE........and would’ve been more fire if 50 would have did a another verse
Love this! What do US people think about German underground rap? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kpi3lr9SXPU
It’s sad to think that 50 cent sounds better than the other kid. What will happen to hip hop in 20 years? Will it still be a thing

https://youtu.be/fXgUYI-uqVI
Ill Beat, Classic 50 hook, Terrible choice featuring the NBA Young boy clone. I get he wanted someone that was relevant in this generation so it will help push the song but he literally could have gotten Rowdy Rebel or something. Anyone else. Or even just do the whole song solo. Hoping for a remix with someone else other than Choppa..
That joint got summer vibes! 50 and NLE?! 🔥🔥
🔥🔥😍😍
50 killed this shit need more of these hits 50 2021 I want 10 tracks 🤣
https://youtu.be/7gcnclGWFVg

If I ever want to become a gangster. I want 50 cent to teach me the game lol.
Would be great song for the Book 3
I will start this list by stating that NO ONE is entitled to the fruits of YOUR labor. If you’re considering marriage, please read this first.  1. She will pressure you into marriage, when ironically, she is also more likely to divorce you. 2. If you leave her, you are viewed as a scumbag. If she leaves you, you are viewed as “not good enough.” 3. There is a 50% chance that you will get divorced. If you get divorced, there is a 70% chance that she will initiate the divorce. That means there is a total 35% chance of her leaving you. 4. American courts are biased against men. You will not get to see your kids and will have to pay child support/alimony. 5. During a divorce, she will take half or more of your total assets. 6. You are expected to spend 20% of your total income on an engagement ring. 7. During a divorce, she is not required to return the engagement ring 8. She can accuse you of rape and you will suffer, regardless of whether or not you actually did it. 9. If she rapes you, then no one will take it seriously. If it is vice versa, then all hell breaks loose. 10. She can hit you, and if you hit her back, you will get arrested for domestic violence. 11. She has total monopoly on sex. She chooses when to give you sex. 12. She can use sex as a tool to manipulate you. She will only give you sex if you do things for her. 13. You are expected to satisfy her sexual needs. She is not expected to satisfy your sexual needs. 14. After your first child, your sex life will die. 15. After you split up, the children will be conditioned to almost always blame you. 16. She can badmouth you to your children, causing them to resent you. 17. You are not allowed to tell her what to do because of feminism. But she is still allowed to tell you what to do. 18. If you upset her, she will punish you by emotional manipulation. 19. If you even mess up slightly, you are labeled as a “deadbeat dad/husband.”  20. But if she messes up, you are expected to “accept her flaws.” 21. She will try to change you and get angry if you don’t comply. 22. Women are more likely to get bored of the relationship. 23. Women are more likely to fall out of love. 24. Women marry up. That means you marry down. 25. Woman are taught that marriage is stability. Men are taught that marriage is responsibility. 26. If you get fired and end up unemployed, she will leave you so fast. 27. If you are going through a rough financial period, you will also go through a rough relationship period. 28. Money = sex. No money = no sex. Marriage is legalized prostitution. (Just buy a hooker). 29. If she divorces you and you are worse off financially than her, she still won’t have to pay alimony. 30. You will lose quite a bit of money through marriage: the wedding ceremony, buying her gifts, raising kids, divorce, etc. 31. During marriage, you will have no time for your hobbies. You will be expected to work and “support” your wife all the time. 32. If she doesn’t want to work, you are expected to support her in her decision. 33. If you don’t want to work, you are labeled as lazy and a leech. 34. Chances are, she won’t like your close high-school/college friends. 35. She will expect you to put her above your friends, even close friends that are more like brothers. 36. She will expect you to put her above your parents. She is your highest priority now. 37. If your parents end in poverty/homeless/terminally ill, then she will expect you to put them in a nursing home. 38. If you bring your parents home to live with you, she will leave so fast. 39. If you ever get mildly angry, then you are instantly labeled as “abusive.” 40. If she ever gets angry, then she is just “releasing her emotions.” 41. She will not let you go out with the boys. 42. If you do go out with your friends without her “permission,” expect constant phone calls and resentment when you get home. 43. So. Much. Drama. Expect to hear about how Jimmy broke up with Jenny for hours after work. 44. If you have a flaw, then she can divorce you and make a profit from it. 45. If she has a flaw, then she will still make a profit if you divorce her. It’s basically passive blackmail. 46. If you’re an athletic man, expect to lose all your muscle after getting married. Also expect to gain a lot of fat. 47. If you’re an athletic man, she will secretly resent you for your toned body, which she doesn’t have. 48. If you ever end up terminally ill, she can leave you as you’re considered a burden that will “weigh her down.” 49. If she ever ends up terminally ill, if you leave her, then you are considered a scumbag and selfish. 50. She has a whole posse of girl friends that will support her no matter what shitty actions she takes. They will enable her bad behaviors and vilify you.  There ya go.  There are so many innocent men that are blindly led into marriage like a sheep to slaughter. They do not realize that the whole system is against them.   It is better to die on your feet than live on your knees. It is even better to live on your feet than die on your knees.   You’re a man with free will and independence. Defend that fiercely and let no one command you.  https://youtu.be/uD773RYUH7U

anyone remember when 50 said his mum used to play this..... there was something about this song and the importance of it to him. he's only human so he may have subtly released this with some sort of homage to his mum. i cant remember when he mentioned the sample "kenny burke - rising to the top". but, he definitely did
Nice nostalgic vibe.

God bless Jesus loves you.

QUEENS REPRESENTATIVE!!!!
Who else was watching Nle recording his verse live?
JOEY in the back

50's verse is GENIUS in so MANY ways...He switched his flow up 5 times. He flowed within the beat not on top of it or below it. He did this while making it sound completely seamless. People have ZERO idea how difficult that is...#GiveMeJESUS
50 cent gordo jaja🖤👌🏻
Ele voltou brabo

Bout time 50 came wit a song half way decent
NLE held his own and got off on this one too

Huh, Fifty still rap? Not the same Fifty when he first start!!
50 I wish you would do it a little different and rap the songs in Suits and drive in fancy cars and shoot the videos in high quality rich areas and neihborhoods. That would be different and pretty relevant to what you're doing now. It will look like a new look you would bring to the media.
This sounds like a song 50 would have released back in is early 2000 dayz
ok
High key liked it until Choppa hopped in. Wish Pop was here. Needed a slower verse to vibe 50’s style.
NLE should of slowed down his flow cause it wasn’t on beat
Dope 🔥
DOPE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Interesting how he uses an 850s/850ci/850csi/850i rather than the usual ferraris, cool for him!
The openning sounds like IFHY ofertas Tyler the Creator
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 BRASIL COM VC IRMAOZAO

50 cent still unbeaten when it comes to hooks
That 8 series 50 knows jheez
Not really feeling NLE. I think Durk, Boogie or Lil Baby would’ve done better.
How to rap:
here is the old nle i liked listening to glad to hear him doing his old music flow not his new stuff
50 choppa
Who was liking Rileyy lanez since  the every kiss begins with k challenge. She made it up big time
💪🏾
sweeet pop
What is that movie?
sounds like NLEC is just rappin on a 50's verse with his flow, not that bad, but didnt fit it up, if you imagine 50 rapping, sounds pretty with his flow.
Nobody does hook/chorus like this dude
Im dying for 50 to come out with another album cuz somebody getting clapped 👊💪
Mann hope 50 comes out with a whole new album this year
This nigga NLE sound like lil Snupe 😳
Straight up 🔥🔥🔥
This was in nle live his verse

I'm impressed by the young boy this video n song fire
This give me gta vibes and  old school vibes too
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming
Damn the classic bmws they used look hella clean

Thank God some new 50 Cent! He looks huge asf!
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i

Thought he wasn't gonna rap bout guns.  IDC bout gun ref in raps but I thought this dude just recently said he wasn't gonna rap bout violence and guns, maybe I'm mistaken.  Love this song for the record.
Happy 2021
Ok this song is gonna be BIG

Man this is great, the guy in the blue trackies killed the flow though
50 cent use the  time machine to go back in time to make a hit banger.
My guess is he did this one for his upcoming Power book, well its a hit I love it.
We have to thank Rick Ross for the interview he made. I guess 50 just saw it then said : let's show this Guy that I'm still the same 50 he used to copy.
Dope!
Love old school
That's what I wanted to hear Boi
the 2nd voice young kid, bluejacket, my ears bled, bad choice for such a smooth song. I thought YT glitched out and another video was playing on the background.

Eric Foreman?

Them Bimmers on BBS wheels made click! I love this sound reminds me of the G unit Era
Rip pop Sorry Can’t Forget The Smoke
This would've been a hit because of the dope hook and chorus but man the two verses don't mesh well together and aren't very memorable
I remember choppas video of him recording this
Living truth is the proof!!! 50 moves the way REAL G's move...Keep it going Fif'!!!
If Pop was still alive he would be killin this with a feature. And 50 would be way more relevant than 99 % of the rap game -
Fif looking beefed up! 💪🏽
This 50 cent is a really good newcomer, he gonna go far    Jokes aside this kinda reminds me of window shopper

Yo I ain't listening to 50 cent in a long time but whoever dislike this video is straight hoe
The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!  Good News- The Gospel  John 3:16 16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.   Mark 1:14-15 14 After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. 15 “The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!”   Acts 4:12 12 Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved."   Acts 2:38-42 38 Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.”  40 With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, “Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.”   1 Corinthians 15:2-4 2 By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.  3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,   Acts 13:39 39 Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin, a justification you were not able to obtain under the law of Moses.   Romans 10:9 9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.   1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 16 	For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. 17 Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord   Hebrews 9:27 27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:   1Timothy 3-4 3 This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, 4 who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.   Ezekiel 18:23 23“Do I have any pleasure in the death of the wicked,” declares the Lord GOD, “rather than that he should turn from his ways and live?     2 Corinthians 5:17-21 17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here! 18 All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: 19 that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. 20 We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God. 21 God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God

This one is it🔥🔥🔥
This is dope.. poetry
This has nothing to do with the video...But I want to WARN you all in 💝. Please everyone choose Jesus as your Lord and Savior. All these natural disasters are lining up with Bible prophecy in Rev. We are getting closer to Jesus's return and judgement coming on the entire world. Please all repent with your mouth to God and admit we need a Savior Jesus Christ who died for all our sins. Believe and have faith in Jesus Christ and how he died on the cross for our sins and rose again. Invite the Holy Spirit ( being baptized ) into your life and turn from your sins. For those who don't repent and choose Jesus's gift of dying on the cross so we can have eternal life.. Things won't go well for them. I don't want to see anyone perish. I love you all, why I'm warning everyone daily and praying for the entire 🌎 daily. God bless you all!! I'm a sinner and I'm so grateful Jesus saved me from perishing. I keep seeking him daily and his commandments and they aren't burdensome, instead I have peace even when the world seems to be falling apart. God is on the throne, amen!!🙏💐😀💝
That old school feeling the song's givin is just sick plus that scene in the end with the sunset got me feeling like good old days...

FIFTY GOT BAD HISELF
50 back
nle wouldve sounded better without the autotune, also i think he was trying to hard to spit fast with a flow that difficult to keep with the beat, just didnt sound right, but overall good shit
It would be so dope to see NLE Choppa appear on Raising Kanan, even just for one episode 💯💯💯

How nice of NLE Choppa jumping on the feature for this new upcoming artist.

Just because they keep him out the circle and don’t invite him to ROC nation parties they hate to admit that 50 without the music machine keeps himself relevant. Time and time again and keeps winning ! They big mad!
Curtis is back !!

Istg 50 bet not die bc nle always killing ppl
Just finished watching the last episode of Power Book II. 50 is in his bag forealllllll !! Salute

I haven't seen a 50 cent video since he hot shot 40 times.

This shit is fire ! Love 50 execution on the hook and the verse ... if I’m being honest tho NLE detracts from the song , his flow is just very choppy & not sharp ... without him the song is 10/10 ... with em it’s still a dope song tho
NLE choppa👌🔥
To be honest I think Game and Fif would've killed this track.
Rick Ross where you at?
Ah, this the 50cent vibes right here 🔥🔥
50 Cent is really a legend

Back in 2015 after my semi pro football season winning a championship🏆   I became homeless sleeping on people floors and sleeping at greyhound stations I use to get kick out by Secturiy, carrying my clothes in a black plastic bag. wearing the same clothes for days going to sleep hungry in tears in my face.   I had no money  I had no car  I had noting   Now I’m doing better now, I started my own book company My 2nd book was Rank #9 in the Top 100 Best Seller List genre African American Literature against Thousands of other books I have proof of that on my IG page and my Facebook book page I have pictures of people buying my book from me.   I also have a video of me speaking about how I got into writing in being homeless, I also explain what my books are about on my Facebook book page.  I’m not on here to rest your time or scam this is my life and I’m a real person, My 2nd book name is              Queens Do What They Want      The main character of this book is a black woman name Dallas Star she grew up in Chicago IL. The area Englewood she grew up is filled with poverty and violence.  She had no father in her household just a hardworking mom. Her family abandons her mom because she had a daughter out of wedlock.   Instead of going to college like her friends in classmates her mom had to move to a homeless shelter. Her parents tossed her mom in the streets to survive on her own.  Dallas wanted something different in life she was born with a gift to be business-minded in this book you will see if she can build an Empire with the right people around her.  She will learn about the weed industry to learn about distribution she will learn other businesses to reach her goal of achieving wealth.

This song is not bad but it got the wrong beat for fifthy. Most of his song got a way more agressive beat, I think this one doesnt fits his style.
Lets go baby
If 50 would give us SKI it would be the first album of 2021 to go Gold.

STAY RIGHT THERE 50 DON'T MOVE NIGGA....THIS WHERE ITS AT G💯💯💯💯💯
Nle and 50 ???
Everyone talking about 50 which is fair but are we just gonna overlook the fact that this is like the opposite of nle’s style and he still killed it
who watched chop record this on his stream?
https://youtu.be/h6Erk7zyF70
This is 50
Yo chopp screwed up the whole song he definatly wasent needed his whole verse was trash wtf only bar he said was that was ok was two chains like titi boi. Wow he was definatly there just to get the young crowd. Nice try though
Nice 50 cent
OG 50 slidin on this 1!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This shit hard reminds me of the early 2000s
50 never misses. Damn. He really came up from the dirt.
I don’t understand but I like it

What about nle dudes grown so much
My guy finally threw a track out for us with that old school sample! Reminds me of "When I Come Up"! Hope more coming Fif! ❤  From Omaha Nebraska
NLO CHOPA
50 cent needs to make another album
Not the best collab for me, but I love hiphop, mumble rap and all dat.  I really do enjoy old and new generation collaborations.  It's just beautiful in it's self.  I believe that Lil Baby and 50 collab would be epic in my mind.  With all due respect, 50 and Lil Baby get into dat mumble-rap-singin'- bag but you still know what they are talking about and they're raw.  Both of them would feel that energy and go silly in the booth.  They gon' try to kill each other on that mic.  That's dat HipHop....  I would love to here NLE Choppa with DMX.  That would be digustingly, with the ugly face and all, dope.  But hey, just my thoughts hearing this.  Still like it though.
Getem fifth

50 Cent come to Paraguay ❌🚀
Who else clicked for the classic BMW
Choppa should be spitting on beats like this more often.
This gives me the early 2000 feel YES!!! Good job 50
50 is Ross hip hop grandfather. Ross must submit.
This lowkey better than the original Power theme
what's the original song?
50 still got it. That flow from almost 40 years ago still sound relevant to me. Ross talkin that bozo shit bout he ain’t relevant and only reason he blew was because of Em and Dre. Clearly he didn’t know mixtape 50. Everybody knew 50 was coming. That’s what they was all scared. Jay told all of his roster to flood the streets because he was coming. Get rich dropped and everybody had to sit on the sidelines for more than 10 years and watch! Ross said himself on a recent verse “Hov gave me a verse so that kept it exciting” QUOTE from his own mouth. So who really needed people around??? 50 still got it and aside from Jay, I don’t know another rapper that has been able to pivot on the level that he this dude has. Ross better grow the fuck up and stop worrying about the wrong things. Last time I checked covid smackin shit and ain’t nobody checkin for that whack ass chicken and belaire water. That’s the shit that got his fat ass in the hospital begging god for his life in the first place. Keep winnin five.
Damn 50. This shits a bop 🔥🔥
Choppa went hard on this beat.
50 does his thing like always
Which movie is this the sound track to?

Much respect

Liked the tune before it even started. No doubt another banger
Tight 👍🏽 i like it....
This kinda similar to to the My Era album Jim Jones dropped last year especially the cars sitting on BBSs. A collab would be nice but that'll never happen. 👍👍
Me being a older head love to see when a old schooler can make that connection w/a new schooler. Some tried but failed. This right here? A winner

NLE went off.
50 we need album of the year gone drop that
This is the 50 we need, not the internet trolling, Cheeto Hitler supporting bullshit. I'm so glad you saw how stupid it was to do that before it was too late... 🔥🔥🔥🔥
50 still has it, when it comes to Music. I'm feeling this one, and somehow, I expected him to go with this Old School Sample, as it's a VERY beloved Song where he comes from. Those Queens cats love that Song.
I see his trying something different 😏
wow top music boy 50 nle 100k

Stayed for 50 cent... left because of nle choppa 👎🏾
The King is back
I wish 50 was on this by himself tbh. This joint so classic and NLE Choppa doesn't sound right on it. 50 is riding this beat, Choppa all over it not doing it justice.
Power Book 2 was good can't wait for Raising Kanan going to be lit asf!!
This gives you those old G-Unit mixtape vibes
Let's get em buck
4 hundred dislikes u gotta be kidding me this track is hot
😉👍🎶✨💎
Master of the slow flow
Smooth 👈🏾🔥🔥🔥🤩🤞🏽snapped
Sounds like 50's style rehashed on a classic from Doug E.. I don't hear a whole lot of effort in this track. I'll have to hear the finished product.
MESTRE É MESTRE, 50 CENT VERDADEIRO GANGSTA RAP, E NÃO ESSES COMÉDIAS DO BRASIL.
50cent 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Power Book 3 Raising Kanan going to be 🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
NLE DID A GREAT JOB ON IT MAN........
50 needs to put out a Full Album already! I love 50 but the singles are killing me. I love the singles but we Need a Full Album Fifty!! Come on Ya'll let hit the Thumbs Up on this one. Get his attention
The older the more buff, 50 Cent.
50 cent songs always make u feel like ur living in New York City i love that feeling
somebody feeling this big daddy kane - smooth operator vibes?
This got this is a big rich town vibe all over it opening for raising kanan
The best thing about 50's songs are the beats.  50 is an "A,B,C" rapper with no complexity or deep metaphors, no wonder why   he is never on anybody's Top 5.  40 something y/o man still rapping about simple-minded street shit.
Not mad at this song at all! Its 🔥🔥🔥 Nice intro song for Power Book:3
I can’t wait to watch raising kanan book 2 was good
This track is 🔥.
🇹🇳🇹🇳🇹🇳🇹🇳✈✈🔥🔥🔥

Niceeeee
K!!....50 " Where's my Mary J Blige, DMX or Loyd Bank's on this joint?" Should've kept it old school with rappers and singers. This was definitely an opportunity for you to hit us with old school artists on this... Still nice though🥰
Getting that old 50 style on this one 🔥
Am not NLE Choppa fan but dude did some justice to this song.. 50 with the old school sauce 🔥🔥🔥
Очень круто

Shit was dodo
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
So glad to see him drop some new music.
50 a GOAT in several decades now , no cap giving me flashes of Get Rich or Die Trying movie 'dying' to see how it 'plays' out
💪new york style.
Sorry Rick Ross. (I am a fan of both),it’s nothing to the homie to put a hit together. This joint fire!!!!
Your a fool if you think 50 still writes his own lyrics
What movie is this
This is fire 🔥
Cadê os brasileiros aqui ?
50 cent is obviously the best rapper of all time
Should have had Mary J Blige singing the hook!
This look like his new series The Story of Cane

I was 8 when get rich or die trying came out, my brother bought the album. 50 is the reason I love hip hop.
O cara é foda pra caralhoo
50 should’ve did the whole song. 🔥
This shyt captures south side so well. “Rising to the top” was the house party anthem back in the 80s and early 90s. Local hood rappers and DJs would go so hard over that beat. Like the south side anthem “dedication rhyme” by Corey D. If you from south side you know the vibes...
The song is 🔥 but I’m hype that we got to see clips from power book 3
É disso que eu tô falando porra!!
Что за фильм
Dope af until young dude started rapping lol.
Love this style of music from 50 grow up with his music, big love fifty ❤️🎼❤️
God bless this raper

💥Σ(°д°ﾉ)ﾉ50 killed it☆
50 was great before he ever started singing, funny haw he always said he'd never do like ja rule🤣🤣🤣. 50 stick 2 ur businesses and stop doing music cos ur washed up on that side of things. I'd love u 2 accept ja rules offer 4fighting for charity tho👌.even though he smashed u b4. We'd still love 2c that because ud have no chance at Verses as every1 knows ja rules music is timeless and has 2many great ones compared 2ur  shit.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fif still got it
🇺🇲🇹🇯❤️❤️❤️👊👊👊
50  make big money moves. U seen Power tonight? Omar Epps in raising Kanan. Tommy was crazy tonight. Power Book 4 is Tommy's story.

Getting big 07 vibes wit this one
Cut the dead weight 50, the singing bitch drowned u out, and the kid got no type of flow over this beat, he rapping too fast and all over the place.
This is Artistry! Michelangelo status, its brilliancy at best!  50 is called many things, which are about 75-80% truth. But what  he doesn't get enough of is credit, Emmy status of his Genius gift of Repping NYC to its fullness. He took us back to the boroughs of Queens in Raising Kane of early 80's era. Brought us City Life Midtown Manhattan, night life, skyscrapers, Penhouse living in Power (Ghost, Truth, etc).  Continues to heavily employ black actresses and actors of all age (that are believable to each character) as well as white characters Tommy, Turtle (the guy that played his lawyer), and the wealthy rich man that worked with Ghost in Power and has as made appearance on Ghost Book. I am really bad with names. Any whoot,  the marketing, branding, the storyline, the illustration of it All is award nomination Status. Its Next Level Shit!! 50 well done! King status, I'll even take to G.O.A.T. (don't come for me in the comments below) status.
We are in the game for real!
😬
wow 50 sounds like old times,hands up !
Nice
Im remember when nle is in studio and he singing this song live youtube

Nobody is ever gonna take your place in my heart as a rapper and as a role model. ROZAY can say what the fuck he wanna, he will never be like you. You're so special and unique. You came and changed the rap game and made every rapper both in New York and outside New York, and all around the world to up their games, you raised the bar so high, so these new Niggas ain't got nothing on you. You're my living legend.
50 still got it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
За фифтика сразу лайк!!!!

Lastly 50 cent remembers his YouTube password 🔑

Who else is ready for Power Book 3 Raising Kanan
Man.    Zarrrrr
50 is the definition of hustle...GRIND AMBITIOUN , AND MOST OF ALL..POWER.. HE IS WAS AND ALWAYS BE THE EPITOME OF HIP HOP
Vo vo vo booooooommmmm
The real 50cent classics . I really feels this song was just left out from the get rich or die trying album. Come on man you are like this. You ended real hip hop and need to resurrect it.
Top
Yeahhhhhh this is fifty mf cent
Here when it was 2 hours out🤝
Damn 5th and NLE
⚡️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This shit is too cold 🥶 no cap 🧢
Fire!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥 this track is a whole vibe...... Summer 2021 will bring the blazing heat & Raising Kanan!!!!!!
Exit Fofty  Enter 50 Cent 🔥🔥🔥
Aight.. ima say it! Song 🔥.... but you need to Choppa off. The vibe was MEAN... and then he fucked it up! Swap his ass out before the show starts. Call it a remix, I don’t care. Just do another version without him. You got a BANGER FIF! 🔥🔥🔥
Fuck yeah. Fiddy be back 💣
@nolifeshaq
who was on da live when nle was recording his verse fo diz ??
0:15  When you go to a house party , Pass out , the next morning you wake up , go to your car , YOO MANNN WHERES MY MAWF****** RIMMMMSSS!!!!!! ( everything else stripped from the car )  Ive seen that happen out in Halifax Nova Scotia Canada
Him driving in that BMW here reminded me of the "window shopper" music video
The costume designer for the Power franchise be working yo 🔥🔥👌🏽
“Ghost never dies”     -Tariq St. Patrick
It feel so good seeing NLE Choppa rapping with old school
I see a bunch of mixing of different eras in this one video. 70’s 80’s 90’s 00’s 10’s n now 20’s
Good Song But I Gotta Admit Nle Choppas Flow Don't Work With This Beat It Sounds Off, 50 Cent Flows Perfectly With This Beat Cos He A Solid Old School Hit Maker But These New Young Artists Need Those New Style Beats That Are Tailored To Their Flow. Just My Opinion 🤷‍♂️
Are some of those scenes from a movie
Dope track and dope old school Bimmers.
Classic 50 cent...timeless..the rapper who was the no1 for a couple of years back in the best times 2000s
That 850 CSI
This show gonna be wire specially the season with the kids but in the 80s
Bringing that real hip hop back thank God 🙏 for Curtis 50 cent Jackson.. I read both books and listen to the audio books.. so I wanna say... U made it u did it ...

The canary yellow 850i is looking hella nice!
Nle choppa is very lyrical for his age, he's going far 🔥
1:28 NLE Killed it🔥
Refreshing to hear some nice lyrics on a dope beat. Uh oh! Power book lll let's go!
cool man
Dope
Me & all the  Ol'skool player's love the whips in this great Video.. Dum question is this a movie about to come out..🤷🏿
What a Surprise 🔥
https://youtu.be/Ay7nQDT74KA
NLE Choppa missing the beat like he was paid to do that. How can 50 not pick up on the kids terrible delivery. He was too excited to do this, decided to go so hard that he missed the beat. I hate when people spoil a good song like that. His part was not necessary. 50 should have carried the whole record
Drop Another Kanan Tape! 💯💪🖤
Here before the millies 😎
Happy New Year Boss🤙🤙💪💪
So nice 🕺❤️
Happy new year 💖
NLE voice don't fit this song and does not resonate with the 80s vibe or the timeless feel 🤷🏼‍♂️ 50 need his own version to avoid hurting his feeling with maybe and east coast feat like Nas 😲
50

Who believe 50 cent is who left from original squad
50 CENT THE REAL KING 👑 OF N.Y. PERIOD
The last rap don
50 is top 5. Idc if that offends someone's list but... Did you hear GRODT? Massacre , Power of the Dollar, Beg for Mercy?  Curtis and Before I self destruct were solid as well.  When I was growing up it was G-Unit everything and the video he bulletproof on PS2.  50 was always a inspiration. Still is . I enjoy the tv ventures he's doing as well.
Man this was a dope track. He should of had an older artist on the second verse tho
Promoting Power Kanan I see 🔥🔥

🙏❤ hello to whomever is reading this, I want to remind you that God loves you and he has a wonderful plan for your life! 😁  God forbid If you died suddenly today, where do you think you would spend eternity??... If you are not sure, God wants to let you know that he loves you very much and that this is REAL LOVE — not that you loved God, but that he loved you FIRST by sending his Son Jesus to die for you to take away all of your sins that you would not perish but have everlasting LIFE!   Gods love for you cannot be measured, it has no boundaries and will look past all your faults. God saved me and set me free from a lifestyle of sin and addiction back a few years ago and my life has never been the same since. God can do the same for you if you allow him. "Behold, I’m standing at the door, knocking. If your heart is open to hear my voice and you open the door within, I will come in to you and feast with you, and you will feast with me." (Rev. 3:20) God wants a RELATIONSHIP with you! Its not too late! He loves you!  The bible says in Romans 6:23 that the  wages of Sin is DEATH! But the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour!! Romans 10:9 & 13 says that WHO EVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF JESUS AND BELIEVES IN THEIR HEART AND CONFESSES WITH THEIR MOUTH THAT HE IS LORD SHALL BE SAVED!!  Im going to say a prayer for you! Lord bless my friend and their family with a long and healthy life. Lord I pray you make yourself real to them like you did for me in Jesus name. Friend, If you would like to receive Jesus in your heart or rededicate your life to him, then right where you are say this with me with your heart and lips outloud...  Dear Lord Jesus, come into my heart, forgive me of all my sins, wash me and cleanse me, set me free. I believe that Jesus died for me and that he is coming back again for me. Fill me with your Holy Spirit. Jesus make yourself real to me. I accept you today as my Lord and Saviour. I'm born again, all my sins are forgiven, I'm on my way to heaven because Jesus is in my heart!  Friend if you've said that prayer, I pray that from this day forward your life will never be the same. I tell you today that all your sins are forgiven, and always remeber dont run from God but run to him because God Loves You and has a plan for your life!  If you prayed with me, plz type amen! https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=900241527115892&id=100013901589755  God bless!😁     Don't believe in God??  Proof in the links!...👇  From crackhouse/drug dealer in Wash DC to Pastor! Depressed to the point of having a 40 cal to the head, TO  COMPLETELY SET FREE AND DELIVERED BY THE POWER OF GOD! Listen to this POWERFUL salvation testimony! https://youtu.be/XjTvi_wjZ9U People being filled with the Power of the Holy Spirit At Outreach Event: https://youtu.be/MKWzHeDNpqI In the streets: https://youtu.be/GWqbf7Qv7Kg  Life After Death https://youtu.be/JYuY7Cm4KuQ https://youtu.be/GMAKSByShGU
