Thank you to Kamikoto for sponsoring today's video! Go to https://kamikoto.com/WD50 to save $50 on your order!   How much do you think this RX-7 will be worth once it's fixed up again?!
that car is worth a fortune, seeing the under trey bolts being shiny is next level lol 8k miles on it two thats an ttoal gem!
very nice guys love jdm cars one question after this beautiful work is this old guy gona leave it again to go to waist its sad how people cant appreciate cars
Am surprised the tyres still in good shape considering it hasnt moved for 23 years. Usually tyres will deform because its sitting on the same side of the tyres for ao long.
Great job on the exterior paint.  Would have been nice to see the owner's reaction at the end.  ☺
Wish they'd make cars like this again... Absolute gems.
How about that 1st gen
It's a great video, but I genuinely call cap that this car only has 8800 miles. I refuse to believe that any person could gather that much rubbish under their seats in just 8800 miles.
This one is beautiful wow
I can not stand when dealerships put their sticker/emblem on the back of the car.
He ever sells it let me know lol
I just want to know how people find these neglected, but extremely well preserved cars. I’d absolutely love to find something like this, holy smokes.
Didn’t you guys notice the 1st gen next to it in the garage? Should have grabbed both. PS. I hope you guys are wearing proper masks when working around dead mice.
Man you guys take pride on these utterly disgusting  vehicles. They look gorgeous when you get through with your cleaning and waxing. It hurts my back just watching you.Good job!
Trust me, dealership badges now on cars like this set the car, especially if that dealership has closed down. In uk some dealerships were as famous as the cars. Colin hendry imports.
This channel is hilarious! It’s like those dumb BS survival channels. Do these people literally just knock on everyone’s door asking to look in their garage for cars that haven’t moved in 20 years 😂
Some commenters are so gullible. Do you really think they found this car after sitting in the garage for 23 years, then literally DROVE it down the driveway? Seriously?
Go Cavs!
Did you start that thing after 25 years of sitting or did you change the oil first? You need to talk about these things
mice😱😱
Day 1 Of Asking How Much Money Have You Found In Cars In Total?
When I Grow Up I Want Too Be A Detailer
It turned out fantastic, incredible!!!!! Great job,, what chemical  or what type of che.ical do u use on steering wheel?
Excellent job
I live in Charleston, SC but I would jump at the chance to let these guys work their magic on my ‘09 Fairlady Z 😭
Didn’t necessarily want to see the Mazda clean in the ad while I was still watching it while it was dirty lol
All staged, I see. Why doing this?
Replace the tires!!!!
Incredible detailing and what a find!
I know of an 87 FC with 51k miles on it sitting in a barn behind sheets of drywall and plywood... she wont sell...
My dream car, but i refuse to pay 100k euros for one of those xD
,😍😍😍😍😍
Beautiful car, mediocre brisket :)
he bought it new, got scared and let it rot. fucking sell it.
My dad owns a Rx7 FC
Fun fact about my uncle he owns a RX7 FD and FB
Crazy thing is that there was a Rx7 fb too I wish they would’ve got it too😢
There's two RX-7s, a FB and FD
I would kill for a rx-7 fd. Such a beautiful car
If you don't want to drive fast, why would you buy an RX7??😅

You guys are awesome!! Very professional
Who abandoned an R-X7??? 🤔🤬
Got scared, I did 140 in my 94 Lebaron, pussy.
Amaze work! Congrats! 🏎️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💨
Una pregunta ❔ cuanto tiempo les tomo ese coche
Buenas tardes, que producto o componentes usas para los plásticos del interior? Gracias
Found a diamond in the middle of nowhere 8k miles is beyond crazy for a late 90’s model
Gorgeous work  and car. i wonder what the price tag on this would be at auction.
Its a real black pearl. You very lucky find this car
The owner's explanation that he drove it at 140 mph, got scared and never drove it again, defies logic. Was he drink/stoned? And is the freshly detailed car being returned to that hideous fire-trap of a garage? I sure hope not.
I'm going to call this a bluff... like  how do you just find a highly sought-after car in near perfect condition ( I'm guessing for minimal price)? So do we just go around asking people for this car,  or just go searching around people's property?  Almost as if you bought the car and trashed it a little, by throwing dead mice and junk inside.  And then cleaning it up for the content.    Makes me wonder if your do that for all your vids?
Rats nest under dash and in ac , mold etc
Kamikoto sucks
I owned one that looked identical to this one in 94. It was a special moment in time with my dad that I will always cherish. Thanks for this one.🥲
it's beautiful ❤dis car 1 of my favorite
Awesome job!
rx-7
Did it drive? Did you replace the engine? lol. So many unanswered questions
$. 🎉
nice video
初代のSA22Cまで有るのは驚き‼️
Got scared of the car?
why did you remove the rear badge for the spitzer? was it a shortfall in thinking or did you swap out the car with a different one. you are detailers without attention to detail.
The condition and mileage is unbelievable. Hope it goes to someone who can appreciate such rarity. Was that a gen 1 sitting with it in the beginning?
I have a 2007 Ford Fusion that i did a bang-up job on painting the outside and inside on. i am a huge batman fan and tried to paint it black and make my own batmobile, whereas the original color was beige or tan. I haven't used it in almost a year now since it got taken out by a deer i hit on the highway on July 4th 2024. All of the wheels are flat but just need air. if you want a video on what NOT TO DO in painting or trying to modify your car please let me know your interested.
Well, pristine RX-7s are pretty expensive in the states. But one that is as new and clean as that one. It's gonna be worth a ton! And it would have been awesome to see that the new owner kept it like it is and not ruining it with bodykits and whatnot
2 rx7s in one shed
❤ You guys are so true and authentic. You have a great future ahead of you. I want to thank you for the many hours of enjoyment you have given.❤
주작이다
Wow, an rx7 that made it to 8800!  🤣😂
Blue ‘81 next to it!?!?!?!
I like your videos ❤ from pakistan
Bru why do yall wear such tight skinny jeans
I like it after you got done with it.
Worth 8.5 billion easily
dude i would cut myself open and sell my organs to have this car. this is one of my dream cars.
God bless 👍 there's no such thing as luck
Nice job, incredible car ❤
Fucking immaculate!! ❤
Owner got scared of the car... People, really
Dry ice clean this bad boy
I have a Honda EG SR3 that has been sitting in the garage for 4 years but I'm from the Philippines. Lol. Nice content man!

Very good job. I flew into Columbus Ohio on a sales trip, rented a car just like that one, and drove it for a week. I darn near fell in love with it. Very fun to drive. Nice and tight like a go kart, it took corners well, and had excellent brakes. It was not as fast as some American muscle cars, but it could scoot pretty good. It looked a whole lot like that car. Black on black on black.
Best result I've seen yet!
I know you guys are busy with your new product line but you should start a second channel doing tutorials. I want to polish my black Jeep like you did this car but don't want to mess up the paint. I'm sure there's tons of info others could use as well. Obviously we can Google/YouTube search but I trust you guys
140mph , gets scared of car and parks it for 23 years? Maybe don't drive 140😂 Nice job on the detailing.... it's fun going back to older videos and watching you guys evolve! 👍🏼
Beautiful car and you guys makes miracles with theses! But the owner was scared of a 260hp car? 🤷‍♂️
I didn't know you were born in 03
I owned a 1993 Touring package which came without the rear spoiler but Bose acoustic wave system. I still have an original 3D cut out poster of the RX7. Each was given to a dealer principal from Mazda Japan.
Love it it’s my dream car
This is like buting BTC and stored it in cold wallet not knowing it will be so valuable in the future man i wish i was this lucky.
Dour vacuum cleaner sounds like the rotary engine 😂
give me an rx7
Around 2,000 to 2500
Lindo carro ❤
What is the last product that you spray on and wipe off?
what's the infatuation with washing cars on video doesn't come across like in real life
My brother let me borrow his black 87'  RX7 and some lady pulled out in front of me and totaled it!🥹
50k+
Allways an extremely good job. Congratulations!!!
Not a restoration but full-fledged production. He's got the tools, and he's got the talent.
кто с тиктока?
Dumb question, is this a Mazda?
Adding to the value? Does that include the change in the trunk?😅😊
cleaning is not enough, need to dismantle the whole thing and disinfect it
Oh I was hoping to see reaction of owner at the end…. amazing job either way gentlemen!!!!
Cleaning, detailing on special stand much better than wheel on car 🚘
Wait a minute dudes got a whole RX7 FB there too what the heck. This is actually a double rare find. Those cars are sick. You should restore that too.
is that an rx7 Savanna next to it??
I like the rims they look clean
Yes it is ,I had a cougar RX-7 back in the days way back😅love the videos came by accident,my man he's a Pro mechanic yea❤❤❤
Use a soft tip tooth brush👍
That Gran Turismo music doe🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽
The color of the car is so beautiful
It can definitely go up to 100k at aan auction
Original owner, under 10k, R1 model...  70 to $100k is what this could fetch..  55k for a quick sale
$7.000 for car
How did you find this, and how much did it cost? Thank you.
I'll take the blue rx-7 next to it.
How much him wan sell
Thank you for saving the community. Im sure this one will be for sale owner definitely will not drive this anymore
Definitely got it wet and drove through mud and then park it in the garage and then “Found it”
BBS RIMS WOULD GO NICE ON THAT RX-7
Really love your videos! Would be even better if you could add a follow-up auction link or website link where these cars are eventually sold and at what price level. On Bring-A-Trailer or some other website. I feel this would be just as interesting as your detailing videos while telling the "rest of the story".
Really he got scared of he’s car what a b😂
Cuando los vehículos están enteros,si me gustan estos vídeos,aunque me parece un error dejar los discos oxidados pero muy buen trabajo
Из-за ваших постановок страдает машина. Хватит над ней издеваться 🥴
I'm watching this video instead of my two years unwashed car.
Rotors look terrible man
So ypur finger is to big to polish? I am saying the grinding stone is no different than your finger in the micro cloth no?
What kind of polish did you use? What is recommended for black paint?
I owned a 1994 Montego blue Mazda Rx7 same car as in the video but with tan interior.  I miss it .  I paid 32k back then for it .
Did y'all try and the blue one on the right

I use tire shine on the plastic wheel wells. It makes a great touch.
I was wondering, what did you clean the engine bay with? Thanks in advance
Man that thing is showroom beautiful. Well done.

I had a 1991 dark blue RX-7, loved that car.  Rotary engine didn’t offer much torque off the line but it would get up there and man it handled like it was on rails.
Now off to the mechanic for $12k in repairs if your lucky 😮
🥰🥰
I’m astounded by how the nothing oxidised😱 splendid🤘🏻
I really enjoyed the video.
Where are you guys at I'm in streetsboro
What'd this sell for?
Hard to imagine so many swirl marks after only 8,800 miles
Original owner Couldn’t even take the wheels off and put a car cover on it. Wth😢.  I find these garage barn finds disgusting in regards to negligent owners.
Does he want to sell it?
Should change the wheels ! So old looks design!
over all nice, but you seem to skip parts of the interior cleaning
Maybe worth $80k ... A 2003 I forget the edition went for $125 AUD (~$100k USD) ... with I think 48k miles? Doesn't change the fact that he's a ridiculous vagina. It's like being scared of firearms. Just be responsible!.  How do you get scared of it..? It's not a 1L bike you have to actually ride. Just take your foot off the gas FFS.
please stop sdhowing the dead mice and animals no one wants to see that
the owners reaction to that clean would be nice to witness
That is a gorgeous RX7
$80k
You guys do an awesome job detailing, and I didn't see any shortcuts taken. You and your crew should be so proud of the work you guys do. How much does a detailing like this cost?
I would love to know if the other RX7 is for sale 🙏🏽🙏🏽
I’ll give y’all 30,000 cash right now for that RX7
Omg be blessed guys wao great Job the RX7 my favorite car
Prime example of hoarding, why not sell something you don't have any intention of using. This is despicably sad...! 😢
Fuuuuuuuck I want that RX-7
You guys should start a coin or change jar for petty case maybe for eats sometimes when working late.
I know this is an older video but I bet you could get between 20 and 30 thousand for this car.
You got up to 140 and got scared and parked the car ??... im sorry but you do not deserve to drive a car.
I wonder if this guy still has this car or if he sold it.  If you guys know if he's selling it, please let me know lol
Looks like Johnny Tran narc’d out Toretto this time and got the rx7 back in shape.
DO NOT RUIN IT WITH MODS! LEAVE IT HOW IT IS STOCK! STOCK IS WORTH WAY MORE AND AUTHENTIC! I HATE when perfectly good cars like this are basically at factory state and ruined by mods.
Meanwhile goes on bring a trailer for 200k
Make it red
The 1993 RX-7 was my dream car in those days. Crazy how it is rather slow compared to even my Model Y performance. But it did have amazing track handling and huge tuner potential with the turbo.
How a person buys a sweet car and then puts it in a garage for 25 years to become a home for mice and rust is BEYOND me - why???? They are horrible stewards of what they own.
Scared of the speed ??? I mean it was pretty quick,  but it has to be another reason the owner parked it.
Dom Toretto would be proud.
Wow!This Mazda RX7 is one of my favourite car!Looks amazing now!Great job!
I saw old coins in the car that look like they’re from back in the 1940s you better of kept them they would be worth a lot of money
How do you find cars like this?
that's a steal
$35 to $50
Absolutely in awe with the originality of the car!
おいおいおい！😮 MAZDA🤨😧ＲＸ７ とＲＸ３じゃないか！ １２Ａ１３Ｂそれも 右側グリーンメタリック のは日本国内でも珍しい！😮😮😮👍🥳
That is an R1 model, more rare it has dual oil coolers anti roll bar across the front and upgraded suspension. A few other things, and as an owner this car will sell for whatever buyer wants to spend, truly priceless. I have seen cars like this go for upwards of $125,000, again it depends on the buyer.   The car I own I have had since 2012 I’m 40 and couldn’t afford one as a teen, I saved for about 9 years and found my car at a dealership and spent 29k. It had 32k miles and it now has 45k with upgrades to just about everything possible. These cars are a lot more then just that, they are a lifetime of fulfillment and to own one you must truly appreciate the artwork that they are.   You will never experience anything like a drive in this car i can totally understand what the owner had done by parking this car. It’s honestly pretty beautiful to hear a story like that, for someone to just park a car after a drive and not let it go. Respect and good look with that cars future, if they need any input on what to work on for reliability you can always message me!
Really wasn't in that bad of shape
My favorite car in need for speed 😢😢😢
The thing i hate about it that it has the old logo
Rotary the best engine check the records in a 1/4 mile i think the lowest was 5.99 call El Loquito Killer from Puerto Rico we have the most 4 cylinders and rotaries fastest on the world.
8800 miles is almost brand new isn’t it,
Great  job
"Respect my house." - the first mouse
I have a real life mazda 1993 rx7 fd
Probably about 100,000 thousand dollars.
Car still start ?
Love did car
Where do you find these cars in the barn? How do you even find these barn?
Do you guys apply any sort of liquid like Armor All to the vinyl/.leather of the interior ?  Treat blog👍
did you sell this car?
Parked because it scared him with 8800 miles. If you remove what the mice did, looking under the seats and under the spare tire, this dude was a slob. it just blows my mind that people leave such beautiful cars to rot. I find this to be true with all your videos. You guys do a fantastic job bringing these cars back to life. A lot of hard work and a lot of attention to detail.
Love the attention to detail. Beautiful car.
Just curious why you didn't clean the rust off the rotors?
Maybe around US$80K, depending on the condition of the engine and other mechanicals.
Its such a shame, people buy these beautiful cars and just leave them to rot. 😢
Great 🚙
"Scared of the car"? Did the owner not realize he didn't HAVE to go 140 MPH?
My favorite thing about this car was seeing the Spitzer logo on the back. Haven’t lived in Cleveland for about 20 years, but it will always be my city and that brought back memories as far back as the 70’s, seeing Spitzer commercials on tv. But yes, I would have removed it also.
Bad Rod Ride on
Great work. I have the exact same FD in silver in my backyard on jack stands. Sooner or later I'll be doing the same thing once I have enough money for the repaint.
A note to everyone: if a rotary has low milage - doesn't mean it will run better than 100k+, engine needs to be cleaned after rotting in one place.
Why did mouses die in the car?
That's gotta be the best barn find ever
Don't go by opinion on how much it cost now look at blue book value
Stunning. Absolutely stunning 😍 ❤
Now that looks brand new. What is it worth?.
unicorn car. glad it has been saved.
I have this same car in a game.drive zone
💎 🛞
Got her shining like a wet elephant as my pal would say lol
No one even looked at the first gen
A rx7 with that low mileage if it’s cleaned well and nothing left behind and looks new again be up to 120k since it’s technically still new with them miles
I’ve watched several of your videos and this is my favorite…the end result is remarkable.😊
I want this car so bad
Hey, whats the deep house music between 8:00 and 10:10? Anyone knows?
You ought to team up with Dereck  from vice grip garage he could fix them and you could detail them I think it would make a hell of a video he even travels to get them
Where at in northeast Ohio are you guys??
Mazda's most beautiful sexiest cars they ever made. To bad they were so unreliable. You were lucky if you got 50,000 miles before a full rotary rebuild
That's totally one of the cars I'd love to have. Still has the rotary engine, is it turbo charged?
Do you guys have another channel where you fix up these cars?  That would be awesome if your cleaning videos were the first part and the repairs were the 2nd part 😀
Those rats look like they got poisoned
Charles Johnston jr.
in 2005 I was overseas serving in Iraq. I kept looking up videos of Mazda RX-8 and that new Rotary Engine that was going to come out with it. I wanted one so bad. I returned to the states and test drove it and fell in love with it. Unfortunately, Mazda wouldn't give me a good deal on it so I didn't end up buying it 😞... Seeing this RX-7 made me smile so much. Especially, when i saw the Floor Mats, don't know why those brought me such joy. Well done Boyz!
Wow wow wow that paint looks so dam. Good!!!!! I wish I could get ya guys to do my paint on my Chevy Cruze it’s black metallic or at least tell me the step to polish it to get it back to that perfect clean look
what kind of steam washer do you use?
Bom Car. Bom of a Job. Jaw-Dropping Stuff. Superb 👌
King of yapping made it 15 seconds bye
That buff job made it look AMAZING!
17:25 the way he knocks over the bottle but doesn't care😂
It is funny to me that the customer cares very little for the car until it gets detailed. Lol the thing sat abused in a barn but your're supposed to be careful with the seats.
You guys do great work
Your add ruined it for me, the car was super clean like 2min into the video 😭
Awesome! I wish you took care of the other RX7 in that garage too, the one from the early 80's.
This and the supra, Camaro and the Vette 🥵🥵🥵
Good Job 👍 I like the color black it's look beautiful 🙂
the mazda rx7 is my favorite car
Now to fix the performance parts.
150 grand
I'm sorry, but that sounds like a bit of dumb reason to bench the car... I mean, you're not obligated to drive it that fast. It's like stopping to use the oven because it burned your food once.
There is a 1998 Mitsubishi 3000GT • SL Coupe 2D for $500 near me it’s one of my dream cars and has over 200,000 miles on it however the bottom of it is extremely rusted out and I honestly don’t think it would be worth it but I want it but I don’t know
Doesn’t washing the car’s engine with pressure and water destroy the electrical, and electronic components?? 😳
Great car
What! You do it for free?
8 million views of washing cars wow.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Duuuuude -- I almost had you (correct me if I'm Here wrong...but isn't this the Paul Walker car [FF1] that made the car's go up in value so much) 🤔
If it scared him to do 140 , then don't do 140 . Drive like a normal person. Sounds like a easy fix to me.
so you are cleaning the engine bay with a pressure washer? I know thats typically a huge no no, is it different because of the rx7 rotary engine?  just an honest question
My name is Ray Robinson Sumter South Carolina my favorite car RX7 favorite race car ever Gran Turismo baton rouge Louisiana call Howard Hughes I love RX7 in the RX-8 billboard that watch colonial keep up a good work I like to go do the same thing I do too Petco
❤  GORGEOUS CAR ❤  WHAT  YR. IS IT ?  YOU  ALL  DID  A  MIRACLE TO  RX7   WOW 👌
So now that he cleaned it up, I assume the owner now wants to keep it or sell
Did the owner keep this beauty, or did he sell it? Fantastic car and great job bringing it back to better than new.
Чистят только самые видные места которые бросаются в глаза
Сразу видно перекупы со стажем
Rotory engine seals are probably history...
To be able to see and hear it start up again after so long would be a nice addition to the video.
JUnk POS 23 years old
このFD、日本に逆輸入したら高値で売れる
And the mitsubishi?
Why didnt you paint the drums tho😅
Me lo regalas?
Great job.
27:23 suggestion: would be nice to see if you guys can take the tyres off, and clean the break-Discs%Roter and nuts as well...
The owner isn’t lying. This car is bat out of hell scary fast. In 1992 I was looking at the 300zx, the Stealth, the 3000gt VR-4 and the Supra. The Supra had a high dealer mark up, so I never drove it. The Stealth R/T and the 3000gt all the electronics and repair costs worried me but I loved the rides. Now the RX-7 scared me. It was like a tight fitting (snug seats but I’m 6’3) go cart with a racing engine and it was only a Mazda Wankel turbo. With its light weight it felt so dangerously fast that I saw myself getting in trouble. It actually made me rethink everything and I got a Galant VR-4. I eventually in 1996 got the last 300zx but I never forgot how the RX-7 felt.
Looks staged. 😊
Ready for a engine rebuild
I am a big fan of those cars
10:59 Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Rotary engine pleaseeee brab brab brab
You guys did a super job on the Mazda.
Absolutely beautiful classy and just a fantastic job 💞🤩❤
That's one car I would choose over my girlfriend
Question: isn't the rubber on the tire very old and therefore likely to tear? Wouldn't you rather replace them?
amazing work.     beauty of a car.
You know a car is legendary when the owner gets scared of it for being too fast on a freeway
25k imo. As cool as they are, the JDM legends costing anything over 30k even in this good of a condition is absurd. At the end of the day they’re 20+ y/o cars.
Spray nine on a dry tire and rim zero scrubbing needed
Just wonderful bro love it
That was kept inside a garage for sure
Lazy detail
Keep up the nice work love to see more videos
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Great job I wise you could do my 1973 cadillac 414 745-1989 😊😊 keep up the great work!!!
All that mouse piss and shit
Yo this is fire. Jesus loves everyone reading this God bless
Such a time capsule! She turned out beautiful.
FC 3s The next of the FD is more exotic i think
What a beautiful car, one of the true driver’s cars of the 90s/early 2000s. That engine won Le Mans before they banned it. Wish it was mine.
Nothing is ever abandoned
You find a Supra mk5
That's  not a  mazda logo
This to my day is still my dream car. The RX-7 is (in my opinion) the most iconic 90s import vehicle!!!! I always loved this car and after i saw fast and the furious utilize this car twice...... the red rx7 vin diesel had in the first one, and the orange one from tokyo drift with the veilside body kit. Someday ill hopefully find one. Mazda knows that was their gem!!!!
진짜 꼼꼼하게하네요. 퀄리티도 너무 좋고 굿굿
Im lox
How about coming to Florida
U need toget the undercarriage attachment for urgent pressure washer makes life even easier
Holy Crap. I'd love to get a perfect stock RX7 like this with low mileage.  Keep it as is, just rebuild the engine.
So very glad you scrapped the stupid dealer logo
Not the best video to start watching while eating but still a good video
Bro I saw a fb in the garage
It amazes me that these cars can sit for so long, and the engine bay can look brand new. My 240sx bay cant get this clean 😂
i love rx7 tho
I had one . Trashed it drunkdriving. Write off.
Imagine the value of "just" the car plus the detailing/restoration that's been done to it. That's going to be a huge sum!
I want to go back in time and own this brand new for a couple years. Then I can die happy
This is a really good job. C'est  magnifique.
This is my dream car and I enjoyed so much seeing this
40k easily
when I watch your video on my TV I can't like it. Is there a way to like  on TV
You could probably get 25-30k for it because it is stock, low mileage, all moving parts seem to work perfectly, and its very low rust levels
brisket looks dry
Don‘t even think about it to start it !!!
you guys do a awesome job
Rx7 is my dream car but idk if there are for sales in Philippines
神琴包丁KAMIKOTO 😂😂 Made in China
Really beutiful work on the rx7 fd i am waching your all your videos  all the way from baja mexico   Do you guys have your own products
one key advice more lights on top then people really get to see the detail
Awesome work guys
Cat has to be worth some $$$ not even 10 thousand miles on her. I'm guessing $50-60k
This is just pure art! Awesome skills! ❤❤❤
ダッシュボードの中にネズミの巣ないのかな？
What do you reckon the value in this roughly? 50k
Maybe just don't drive the car at 140 mph... no reason to be scared unless the car is driving itself lol.  Why park it and still pay for it?
The sponsor could have not been at a more perfect time
Magnificent. Both the car and the job done on it.
Any update? Did they sell it? If so, how much? Great work!!
I was waiting for them to start it up
Just stumbled across your videos last night. Wife and I watched them and were hooked now. Love this one and the Nsx one. This is a true time capsule for sure! Good work guys!
Amazing... A good detail just brings these cars back to life!!
With the miles, documentation and condition of this FD. If it runs it could be close to $100k car. The lhd ones go for more than the rhd japanese imports.
I'm from the area and have a 2016 accord; the car really is not that bad but the paint could be polished out. I would like to come in and talk more about it. Where are you located
Don't get me wrong this is far from clean... second thing, probably car would have bigger value if you don't show this video. If is me, that one would be last choice.. but nice car..
Very good 👍 👏
This is a car i still lust over ever since i first saw one at a mazda dealer in queens new york in 1993. This is a diamond in the rough, and will fetch if not easily 100k with the milege alone. Best barn find so far.
Someday I will fulfill the dream of having one :)
he got sceard oh boy  people are so brain dead
Tires that have been on for that long need to be replaced. They are past their safe life. Potentially dangerous to drive around on.
restoration or car wash?
I'm curious did the owner get it running? And did he keep it or sell
Nice car! Great job!
Good Lord, everything is not a barn find! This car is literally in somebody's garage. Y'all did a fantastic job on the detail, but stop calling everything a damn barn find!
Now THATS a Diamond in the Rough !!!!
Those were some skinny mice. Obviously they didnt eat the wiring😂   Must say.... Cleanest Miata ive seen in a minute.😮😊
Love the transformation. I need to get my FD looking this good!
Finally a video where I see you take out the whole rim n tire and do a thorough cleaning
Do you use Max Auto spares?
Hi my name is gary I love watching me guys I live in Minnesota. I don't have a nice car, but just to watch You guys work. It's amazing from start to finish. Keep it up. Thank you for all the time and effort to put it into your craft.
This level of detail and pride is admirable.
Mazda should have bought this one for display!
I’m here after seeing this from tik tok
It's beautiful. Very fragile but beautiful.
これ？元々綺麗な車です。手が込んでる
The way he uses that one yellow brush for everything is so funny
“These ones” 🫣🫣🤯🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
日本は30年に渡るデフレ不況で新型のロータリーエンジン搭載車も開発しても国内では中々売れないだろうなGDPも下落してドイツにも抜かされたし😢
sir, i got 500 dollar can i buy it please?
Wow great job guys!! Sick!!!
This kid killed this detail...that cars a beast
Cmon i don’t believe in ghosts and cougars and abundant rx7s
That was really thorough detail that really made the car pop! Fantastic end result.
If I lived or there I'd like to buy this car it's so clean 😢
Bro that's not a car ... IT'S A TREASURE !! 😮
60k eaaaaaasy!!!
👍👍
Ah yes the RX-7 one of the most popular cars in the 90’s Edit :no fu*king way I was at my granddads garage today and he has  A RX-7 and he sold it to me 🤯🥳
If everything original on the car, the value is between $50-100k! And yes I looked it up. ❤ In production for only 3 years and not many made. Very rare to find one in this great of condition.  Owner is very lucky to still have this gem
Sit back and relax you said……with 300 ads 🙄
I hate boomers bro, could you imagine having so much disposable income you can buy a current or close to current model year sports car, drive it less than 10k miles, and then just park it in the back of a barn and forget about it?
I like the fact that you take the wheels off on this detail wish you would do that every time you detail a car or truck
That is incredible... amazing!
1
Mice definitely knew they were in an RX-7 that's why none of them messed with it.
On your finale you should do a before and after shots. 👌🏻
Why did you power wash the entire engine? It's an old car, I hope that didn't rust connectors or water got through seals!
How old were the tires?  Supposed to take them out of service after ten years regardless of tread depth, right?
Stunning work gentlemen!
Gotta be worth 100k +. 8000 miles on it and everything is basically factory. Museum quality for sure
I had one just like this. Mine was a '93 black R-1. This was a beautiful barn find and beautiful restoration.
Personally one of my favorite car. Thanks for thecleaning and detailings
After that long the tires need to be replaced. Very dangerous to drive on those tires
its fake
Drove one of those once, and wow what a tight gear box and engine.  The wheel base runs in line with the HP so good handling.  ------- Probably one of your best finds and results Ive seen  WD D  !
Music name at 4:30?
The mice liked the car so much that they didn't want to destroy the car and the wiring
Wow.. this explain how rich americans. Bought a new, well not cheap car than abandoned it for milire than 20 yrs.. 😂
Awesome I'm hooked on this
Wow  대박   휠만 갈아주면 자세나오겠네
I think its worth as is $30,000 dallars
As a 63 year old Homeless US ARMY (Cold War Veteran) who doesn't own a vehicle 😭I really enjoy watching your video's on how you restore (gems) back from the dead .. Every Saturday I look forward to watching your channel with new finds you guys get.
After all these years, wouldn't it be better if you changed the tires?
Y'all do it for free? Wtf.. How do you grow the channel and work then  Deserve more than that guys!
if they decide to sell this car, they should reach out to keanu reeves the actor, ne might like to buy this car, i don,t know keanu,
75 to  a hundred thousand
its left hand drive...... holy moly this thing is rare
$220k on BaT  lol
where's it gonna be sold?!
This is fake . No way in hell people keep finding rare super cars in garages
Amazing work
On the barrel side of the wheel, how bout a Mr. clean scrub pad? I want to try that on my Icon wheels on my 4Runner
Just ignoring the even less common series1 rx7 beside it?!
Nissan 300ZX Turbo Mitsubishi 3000 GT Turbo Toyota Supra Turbo Mazda RX7 Turbo The best cars of the 90’s
WHO THE FUCK BUYS A CAR AND JUST PARKS IT????????
Wow that was a hanta virus hotel! Even the mice couldn't survive!
ive seen that dealership badge before, are u guys in ohio?
I need you guys to do this to my R33 Skyline
how can you leave the brake rotors like that??
Amazing job!  Car turned out so fresh. Very therapeutic 😅
How much did the restoration cost you?
Such a nice car WOW!
youre living my dream bro
ceiling lights are a must for paint correction I suppose. Where?
What’s the song that plays at 14.21
$80,000 for it I think
$28,000 as is. Will need lots of work that people dont know about.
Yeah that thing belongs in a showroom now. Amazing results because of amazing people. 😊
Rip mousies 😢 such a sad sight.

For a fact y'all did a fantastic job making it look great again , other fact , if it sat for 25 years , that Rotary engine is shot .. the engine has a lot of rubber gaskets , and just letting that car sit for that long of a time .. I have no doubt it will need a rebuilt engine in it .. But it would be worth every penny to have one installed ..
The RX-7 has to be one of the most beautiful japanese cars ever, along with the Nissan Skyline R34, Toyota Supra and Honda/Acura NSX. Awesome work!!
Your grandpa garage
Who does this to a car though
Im loving that they pressure wash anywhere in that garage.  it must be a gradual drain floor underneath.
So many beautiful Japanese coupes from the 90's..  Awesome job with this one.
To find a RX7 unmolested with idiotic add ons is literally impossible! I'd pay a lot for this car!
That car is a once in a lifetime find. Not just because it’s an RX-7, but  everything looks brand new after they were done detailing and it’s been 30 years. That’s a Brilliant, Brilliant video.
No damage? you should look under the carpet, that material in glove box and other places deff came from somewhere within the car.
How much yall pay the old man? Hope yall ain't screw him over
I had a red 1994 RX-7.  Awesome car to drive with the rotary engine, but very light on the street.  I spun it out twice, the second time on an ice parch that almost killed me.
What about its 1st Gen. Rx7 brother to the right?? What about that one?? No love?
Do you use a regular brush when adding soap or is it a special brush?
Veo ese rx7 y me pongo a llorar sabiendo q yo moriria x uno de esos y ellos lo dejan abandonado
The important thing is the engine and if it works otherwise should start with that
I’m going crazy here for this answer.What’s the reason even the low mileage ones are always missing the battery cover??Mine had 52,000 but still had its cover compared to ever other one I have seen
waaaaaawwww
immaculate job!!!
Fantastic detail work transforming this awesome barn find Mazda to a prestine gem 💎 Got yourself a new sub and taking notes to assist transforming my garage find Mazda 😀
This owner is about to get a nice chunk of change. If you were 10-18 around the year 2000 chances are you still want one of these.  Omg just opening up the trunk gave me nerd chills lmao. This is unreal. Even the mice knew what he has.
Did you really leave the 23 years old tyres on the car?!
Did the original owner keep the car or sell it after this amazing clean-up ?
whats the name of the stand you used to individually clean each tire and wheel?
The series 3 beside it is of more value what happened with that
The car needs nicer rims
an Rx7 looking that good and that unused has got to be around 35k with a running engine. this is quite the find and my absolute dream car hope shes treated well
looks like a brandnew car that wasnt sold.
Love the video guys but I do have a question. Why did you not restore the early 80s RX7 sitting right next to this much newer car? I went back-and-forth to swim practice in high school, in 1986, with a girl who drove that exact model old school RX-7. It was a great little car.
looks  better then factory, good jobs boys!
man i just fixed my self a sandwich and all i see is dead rats :)
Brand new RX7
This looks like an R1 version. Great job! The fact that you did this level of work for free…😮
It stood for 23 years while the water touched and immediately sparkled😂😂
great job detailing but does the car run?
gran trabajo. los felicito. saludos desde Chile.
You know washing engines is bad for all of the electrical things
The interior is so fresh
I was going to say this is going on bring a trailer. As of right now it’s at 75k with so much room to go up. 6 days left on BaT. So cool
Sigh, Kamikoto is a scam, they are Chinese. The blades are not good.
Goals are the fuel in the furnace of achievement.
The amount of respect that went into this detail is appreciated as a viewer
Man I would have never sold it beautiful car!
Charles ate the french fries knowing they would be his last meal.
Snowflakes are one of natures most fragile things, but just look what they can do when they stick together.
80k
6:43  Чувак, убери себя из кадра! Дай на машину посмотреть !!!
YoYocool
For me This car is more worth then 10 Bitcoin
I like the Mazda RX fd formula red
Anyone else feel like once a dead animal rotted somewhere, you could clean it 100 times and it still would give off that rotten death feeling? lol.
Yea they pretty cheap and common here in japan 😂
If the mouse made the house under the tunnel, I'm afraid he made the village under the dashboard...
Damn, homey. Your ad was a spoiler alert.
You fellas have to take the in cab filter out from behind the glove box when you clean the interior.i haven't seen you do it at all. But love your show! Just a tip.
Bro got scared after going 140
Not sure why they wouldn't do before and after video footage?!?! 🤷🏼🤷🏼🤷🏼 Either way, at any rate, job well done!
That probably took at least 1 hour to detail that!!!!!
A short saying oft contains much wisdom.
It’s worth 40k at least
I would never give you my car for detailing, your skills and knowledge sucks bro, you must improve it
intresting story.. i guess this machine can be scary for those who are non the wiser about its true power
This is titanic on land
I wish you would of started that one up
Curious what chemical you used when cleaning the wheel well area and the suspension? Was it just car wash soap? Also what about the areas where their were mice, particularly the interior? Do you do anything to disinfect and sanitize the interior since there germs from the mice?
nice car
Why clean all the wheels and tyres, stick them back on for all the dirt of the car to cover them again.....? Great video..👍👍👍👍
one of the best car in underground II😍
Parked for 23 years and it started🤣
Here in the UK that would be a £40K to £60K car in RH drive form. Personally I can't stand cleaning cars, even my beloved Evo,  but you guys perfomed magic here!
For free!! How you guys make a living? Enjoy watching you all work, smiles.
That RX7 is worth easily $100k. At auction $150k and up.
Someone is eventually gonna mod the shit out of this car and ruin it
Awesome video and car!   I noticed y’all never cover the alternator when washing the engine bay. I’ve always been told to cover it but it seems like there’s no need as long as you’re not pouring a bucket of water directly on it..?
A mesma luva que ele pegou o rato ta cortando a carne kkkkkkkk
Wow so nice car ❤❤
Eu nunca quis tanto um carro
Bet the apex seals are blown
rat piss mobile
Fully restored...$12,599
I live in New Zealand and love your programme. I love to keep my car clean and can you please tell me what cleaning equipment you use for the interior. Do you use some type of wet vacuum cleaner and steamer. Also what is the Brand name of the cleaning foam you sprayed on the exterior of the car. The FD RX-7 fetch big money in New Zealand and any Mazda Rotary models hold their values here. Keep up the very interesting content. Cheers John Wilson
Simple wow, what a great turn out❤
Please just do not calibrate the wheels👎
Roughly, how much would a detailing like this cost? Great job!
he got scared of his car? maybe just don’t drive 140mph?😂
8000 miles, left to be rusting, mice ... rubber hardened...what a waste. it need to be totally taken apart to re-build.
I'm no expert, but I find the detailing hand brush so inefficient it is so small- surely a larger brush would be more ergonomic and also more effective and a bit quicker? Genuine question!
holy fkn sht, best vid on youtube
This is what a 6 figure fd looks like.
how can ppl just leave a car like that ? this is not the first time i see this on internet, i mean even if u are rich, just sell it, dont have time ? ask someone to sell it or give it away, i don't know, just feels so wrong to leave it like that.
Vou ondicar vonixx pra esses senhores
Sou do Brasil e satisfatório ver você fazendo isso no RX7 parabéns
Awesome!! Ficou perfeito demais 🇧🇷
Closest you can get to going in a time machine and seeing one of these new roll out of the factory. Satisfying.
Greate!!! God, how I want Mazda RX-7 in such condition and with a little mileage)
O fazem as pessoas abandonaram veículo de qquer....sem ao menos cuidar.....é mto relaxo.....tenho um chevrolet de 20 de uso....cuido mto bem carro...encero aspiro....está em ótimo estado de conversação...ninguém paga aqui mtas vezes o valor q vc quer....então vai ficar até fim....parabéns pelo capricho de vcs
The work you guys did there is absolutely amazing! Wow! That car looks like brand new. If I had the money I'd pay A LOT for it. Lucky owner right there, he should be proud!
That car is worth $25-40k
I will sub bc i really like mazda rx7 its my dream car tysm to do this
what the fuck....30 min movie have 15 min washing tire and wheel...
Is it fd or nah?
Nossa. Excelente trabalho!  Uma verdadeira relíquia 😍
Great job guys, glad to find your channel, I think this is the best yet. Anytime you can bring a barn find black car back to new condition you definitely have your technique down. Keep up the great videos.
Vcs deveriam conhecer a lavagem da Veneto...
You should definitely take notes from the detail geek on how to wash a car body because you did a terrible job on that part 😖
Que carro, que trabalho brilhante!  Parabéns!!! Vocês são artistas com  pincéis nas mãos.
Great job
Sooooooo satisfying, esp the sound of scrubbing the tires. My favorite🤤😍
You guys did a great job 👍🥇🎉🎉👏👏
For the price of the Kamikoto knives do they come with a chef?🔪🗡 Just kidding love my Chicago cutlery which I have been using for over 50 years I'm happy with them But it wont stop me from you WD boys!
Rims don't look nice 🥺
Brilliant Black R2, 1 out of ~ 140ish. Sold on 94~95. Wow, I only wish my BB R2 is as cherry. This car will definitely need a new fuel pump and tank if the tank wasn't drained prior to storage. Hope they wouldn't find any rats underneath the upper intake manifold, aka "rats nest"
23 anos parados deveriam trocar os pneus para assim poder rodar com o carro.. esses pneus não tem mais nenhuma segurança
And that motor
Beautiful
Sweet!  Please tell me they ain't driving 24 yo rubber?
Beautiful car. Rare to see one of these on the road nowadays.
You don't mention how the car smelled with all those dead mice? But a ton of work before it's drivable; engine belts, hoses, filters, fluids, suspension dried out, a/c dried out, brake rotors, etc. What's it worth as shown, maybe 12k. Black isn't a winning paint finish these days. Weirdly low mileage also a red flag, maybe the clutch is burned out/ gearbox damaged.
Speechless
Dude got scared and just said to hell with it? Why not sell? People are so weird.
Cuanto cuesta un trabajo así
They are expensive today.. one of my favorites.. I had a 1979 Rx7.. but this model is one of my favorites. ❤
Nice work!! That’s my dream car!! Hello from Puerto Rico 🇵🇷!!
Absolutely stunning vehicle iv always loved these rx7 FD's and still do.. Great job on the detailing im really impressed❤
That is one fresh rx7😮
The owner parked it because it scared him at 140 mph? Makes no sense. Drive slower or sell it.
If only the detailers where I lived paid as much attention to detail.
Good old-fashioned detailing.  Great job.  Hope you made good money on the car.  RX-7 was never on my radar, but this one looks lovely.  I always wanted an early 90's NSX or Honda S2000.
Are you supposed to wash the engine bay? I thought that would break the car?
Wow awesome job very detailed 👍🏽
Awesome job
26:39 what if I drive up and hang out with family in Galion for a couple weeks? Would that count? 😂 love your channel and what you do!
3:27 I felt the sensation of “care” coming over me as soon as that water hit the fender liner. Amazing transformation!
Yep. This is, for me, the best detailing channel I’ve ever watched to.
I think 20,000
عمل متقن أنا استمتع بمشاهدتكم يوميا اتابع 🎉❤
A barn find doesn't get any better than this!  Looks like it just rolled off the factory floor!
is this europe fd?
17:41 is that USB port???
I'll trade my 2001 S2000 for it! Gorgeous!
Great job but the old rusty Disc Rotors really let it down. It's all in the detail boys!
No way those are the same tires.. the sidewalls would've cracked just from sitting that long.
Are those googly eyes on the carpet extractor?  This car came out amazing good work! Y’all have came a long way! I’ve been subscribed since the beginning
This channel is so fake.
Truly a fine specimen
$25 to $35k very nice find
Wow. Beautiful car and with only 8800 miles??? Insane. For only that amount of miles, that paint job was pretty bad. But, looks brand new now. 🖖
I feel like asking 200k USD for that car is probably reasonable
i really need a lift like this. its hell on my knees to get down on the ground anymore
Amazing work! Love the final outcome! What product do you use to clean the engine? Thanks
the way a lame video, is was a well looked after car that had dirt on. i could of detailed that car myself in a afternoon....and the story that the owner was too scared to drive it so threw it in a garage with other crap instead of selling it is not true...where is the owner to prove it?
Absolutely wonderful guys. The video was delightful to watch and well presented.
Why is this so relaxing to watch? 🤔
Scared of the car lmao. People have gotten so soft
I wish I can find a detailer that loves up on a vehicle the way y’all did this Mazda!  Anyone in the DMV?  Holla!
Awesome job on this mint condition RX-7.  My dream car 30 years ago!  😊
Dang, that's so shiny I could see MY reflection in it
Der anderre RX-7 wäre bestimmt interessanter gewesen
Danm!!.. talking about jealousy.... Beautiful time machine right there..
Im surprised you didnt remove the dash!? If mice was found in glove box, surely, maybe, it ventured over to the dash. That should’ve been checked.
I don’t understand people buy these car and neglected. Maybe it’s just at first buy because wantto do crazy shit then time and situation dosent allowed and these car kept and forgotten.
lol, what kind of pussy is scared of a 255hp car??? A 2023 Toyota Camry would smoke that RX-7
Damn imagine finding 80-100k in a barn...
That is nice. My car is only slightly dirty and I want you guys to wash it. Great job
For free wtf 😂 why... just why
Why didn’t you guys start it or drive it? I love when you guys do that.
What kind of cleaner do yall use that foams up so much like the one on the doors and center console ? I like to have my vehicles cleaned but i cant ever get it this cleaned.
アンフィニ7か、結構状態いいじゃん
Need to get that ‘85 rx7 too. I would love to see that one
Or more
With low milage it would be at lest 20k
sorry, is this legit? because from what I see thats not look like a car that parked and abandoned for many many years, let alone 23 years. especially from the tyres, which they still use the original tyres and not chaged it with the new ones.
Amazing job guys…just like that you got yourself a new subscriber lol🎉
It is irresponsible to leave 24+ year old tires on a vehicle.
2 RX7 in 1 barn
Those brake disc's look rusty as!
Is it for sale?
WOW....I bought a 1993 Mazda RX-7 twin turbo rotory...in 1993  rite off the showroom floor.... i had it 3 yrs...was my favorite car i have ever had
Thank you for the excellent care you gave that beautiful RX7. It was a pleasure watching the clean and polish you gave her!
Personally i would have dropped the gas tank and replaced it along with the fuel pump gas turns to water and kerosene like substance after a few years rust forms inside the fuel tank also i would have gone through the wiring to make shur the mice didn't damage anything next would be flushing every fluid on the car transmission break lines after that do full diagnostic on all systems i know this sounds excessive but the car is worth alot of money and is practically new a tuners dream
""
Crazy a base model rx7 with 160k miles is a 40k car that's the best condition car with such low miles I don't see why they couldn't get at least 65k if knot 90k for the car
Reminds me of Larry with Ammo nyc he finds all barn finds too
Tag the owners
Do you guys sell the cars you find after this one is awesome
Okay so my grandad has his own car business. We've been in the business for over 50 years and this is car upholstery. We've done literally 100s of cars and  have never seen that many dead mice in one car but anywho the car is awesome. i was lucky to have a grandfather into cars he was awesome my first car was a 92 Mitsubishi 3000gt VR4. This was in like 03. He didnt know how much of a monster the car was so in front of our shop I revved to about 3000 grand dropped the clutch after seeing how fast it was he threatened me with taking the car away from me if i got to many tickets. lol
Imagine buying a car, taking it on the highway, then parking it forever.
there’s absolutely no way the owner bought a brand new car an rx7 at that and went fast then got scared and never touched it again instead of selling it or going back to dealer just wow, just letting it sit there especially for that long is so shocking to me, owner must be a very very wealthy person
B*******, that's a lie. I'm so sick of these scam videos on YouTube that gets millions of hits and they're all lies.
海外でこうやって、レストア？されて大事されてるのが嬉しいです！
Badass
Wow - great job.
Bro playing Forza irl with these barn finds
Is guess $35,000
You guys doing a great job, always love your works
What a brilliant job. Well done. Nice to see that the condition
I'm sure this has been stated before, but please do a bit of work to those rotors before you do your final video, the rust on them just kills the look.  It takes moments to hit those with a scotchbrite pad and the presentation will be so much better.  Otherwise fantastic work, and it was the car that brought me here, FD FTW!!
Long live the Wenkel rotary engine!
I hate these video, they look so fake...
The RX-7 has gotta be one of the top cars from the 90's that has aged perfectly with time; it still looks so sleek and modern. Simply timeless.  Stellar job on the clean up 😎
I have seen a bunch of nothing that you are doing I've been painting and restoring cars detailing for 25 years and you just trying to make it look like you really doing something but you're not doing nothing You're not doing anything you wasting a bunch of time trying to get the people to attend that you doing a lot to make more money on their behalf you so call safe
Videos like this make me wanna get an old car for keeps. 😊
Did this end up selling? How much?
To a car collector it might go for more. However just raw data and what it is worth is 15 to 18k.
cant you just use a dremel in those really tight areas to polish? they offer tiny polishing pads for them. also variable RPM.
Well north of $60k if everything is original. How much exactly depends on who is buying it and what they are willing to pay. But id say confidently its well north of $60k.
Couldnt help but notice the other car next to it in the barn might wanna go back for thst one
احسنتم ياشباب انه عمل جيد👌👌
Great job, seems black finish is a very difficult color to polish
Good job 💪💪💪💪
I want that car.
With cars that are caked in dust/dirt, can power washing act as sand-blasting in a way?  Might it be better for the paint to use a blower to get the majority of that off first?  I've wondered about that.
Those rotors
God bless you guys seriously and it must be because you are good people 😎👍🏼
diamond in the rough
Man that turned out cherry!!! ❤
SWEEEEEEEEETTTTTT❤
Just beautiful, always wanted one of these!  Hopefully the owner got a few bucks for this beauty with only 8800mi and being so rare.  anything after 95 stayed in Japan or went to Europe due to right hand steering.
$17,000
That rotary engines seals will be dead and dried out. You'll have to soak the internals in marvel mystery oil, for weeks, and hope for the best..... otherwise you'll have to replace or rebuild that motor. Rotaries do not like to sit....
wow
Does this Mazda have the Wankle engine? Were you able to get rid of mouse smell completely? How much will you sell it for?
Leave it Ass Stock....
Dang 88 hundred miles….I think it’s a six figure car….in my opinion….nice find!!!
I have a 1992 Mazda 626 in Algeria..it's amazing. and comfortable..
So my 22 ford bronco still had the new car smell until 14000 miles. Even though this car sat for 20 some years did it still have a new car smell to it? I've smelled other really old cars with low miles that still had the new car smell.
Excellent transformation.
Can't believe you didn't start it.
150k-200k
Yes! This car is total perfection! I love to watch videos like this! It makes me feel really good! I wish I could find a car in this condition! It  would be awesome!
This Mazda is priceless  Good job 👍
Excellent job guys definitely keep up the great work, the Rx7 is one of my all time favorite cars and I'm glad to see that you were able to bring it back to life.
Wow amazing job guys. What a beautiful car. I need to get this done to my black Honda S2000
8months later, still reading every comment we leave?
How much?! Mazda might even take that off your hands.
I want that rx7
Prob a good $60,000
I dont know why your even clean the tires. They are for sure out of date and need replacing.
It's rare to find that car with such low mileage and in that shape... when ever I have seen these they're usually in junk yards with well over 100,000miles and when I've seen them on the road they're usually in horrible condition,
I want to buy that car like right now
What’s up with the spitzer badge. Somewhere in Ohio
This was a beautiful car restoration! The owner is really a lucky person!!
Hi don't sell the blue RX-7 bot that black it's in perfect condition like brand new
This is thing is very clean
I got a 93 RX 7 R 1 myself.  Have been offered upwards of $70k
Love the car lift. Where did you get it?
I cant imagine the sort of person that buys a car, barely drives it and gets scared of the sports car doing sports car things and then forgets it in the garage.
Car needs a viper alarm, kill switch, club, Lo jack, boot and an armed guard sitting outside the garage of where this car is
"The owner of this car got scared and parked it"   "We've found a lot of ammunition"  Am I the only one that is thinking what I'm thinking?  It looks like someone killed another and the car was used to something creepy, that's why the owner hid it in a garage lol    ALLEGEDLY
Параша.
Jackpot
This has to be one of the rarest finds ever
Crazy who can believe that
All tires must go
I’m absolutely speechless, this is perfection, well done gentlemen.
Beautiful Job!....! Where is the car now?,
just content dont believe 23 year old
i find it really sad that people would let amazing piece of machinery and engineering to just sit there, and rot away in that disgusting garage....it's just absurd how people have absolutely zero respect to things they own
That brisket looks a bit dry mind
Awesome work!!
Is this car end up going up for sale? If so, I would like to know how much if someone hasn’t got it yet
We talk about finding a unicorn in the car culture and this is the definition of the term. This car is absolutely incredible. It is a unmolested factory stock example. If offered up for sale this car would bring a pretty penny to the owner.Probably a $70k car at auction. Mazda may want to buy this RX7 1080p 10:00!
DAMN that meat was dry af 7:20
Отличная находка и приведение в порядок 👍
The mice jus knew how nice their home was and chose to respect it🤷🏽‍♂️
This car is here in Lorain County Ohio. I’m pretty sure in the city of Elyria. I remember this car when I worked at Spitzer Mazda in Elyria when it was on E. Bridge street. It’s a shame that it was not driven more, but great to see it come back to life.  Is this car for sale as far as you know?
Am I the only one who is wondering why the 80's model RX7 that was in the garage isn't getting any attention? That is automotive history.
That car is 65000 just as it is but not more cleaned
200k car right there
Years later, you find the car and leave the original tires? Do you even know the rule of four in the US? I doubt it.
It's not a "barn find".  A guy had it in a garage.  Like any other car.  LOL@ folks that make up the dumbest headlines to get clicks. That being said, super job detailing!
¡¡¡ Nunca lo vimos ni siquiera con el motor encendido !!! 😵😵😲😲😒😒
Pls stop the write up only audio we are not been able to see the video.
Awesome car and timeless design
This car is worth about 35k
Watching these detailing transformation is therapeutic.
Sounds to me like somebody got away from the cops and locked the car away.
Surely the tires would have been perished in all that time !!
Obviously you greased & lubed brake pistons, cables.  Fluids , ? Tires ., brake hoses perishables, batterie ,. Gaitors ,. Air oil filters / air filters ,? Etc etc wiring looms,.
£30.000
Wouldnt the dealership badge increase price
rx7 still probably one of the best looking cars to come out of japan
Amazing car Amazing job!🔥🖤
Great transformation but that brisket looked like 💩
I don’t really care if it was planted or not, the process is very satisfying to watch and i learn a bunch of tricks to apply to my car
$60-$70K
HOW MUCH SOUP DOES THIS GUY USE!!!
Surely the tyres will have deteriourated
You gotta put some rims on that bad boy
did he end up keeping the car or selling it ?
For free??? Myy god.. please do mine… but from md 😞..
Bro you clean everyting un the car but you forgot one stuff the air filter. Im nkw that exist rats in the air filter
You are a litle  crazy after 23 years of use and you don't change the tires
Faaaaaaaaake
Missed a spot! Lol Awesome find, amazing job!
Nobody uses Kamikoto knives, they're a scam .   "junk in a trunk" they're brittle and break easily, plus they rust in the dishwasher very quickly.
Don’t really know cars so don’t judge. What’s the difference between the Mazda RX-7 and this? Different badges? What makes this so special? Genuinely curious.
My dream car -
oh my god give that thing to me thats a legendary car
Outstanding! The attention to detail (excuse the pun) is top-notch.👍
Being picky unless I missed it…… did you raise the headlights an clean them 🤔.  …..great job as always though😎👌🏼
chido wow
How Did bro got scared
I like the older 7. Wish y'all would've done that one instead.
Question.  How do you guys find these awesome cars? Do you just advertise you bring bavk to life old vehicles? Killer job
£29.995 to £37.500
current prices for a 1999 RX-7 in that excellent condition would be around £29.995 to £37.500
Kamikoto is a scam, do any due diligence and you'll realize this.
Cool car!  Definitely don't see them on the road anymore.  Now, if it were an R1.. that would have been a barn find.  As for finding stickers in the car, those aren't going to increase the value of the vehicle other than the value of the sticker itself.  Car turned out great! Keep up the good work!!!
Why was bro scared
Owner said he got it up to 140 and it scared him.... Really it's a murder suspect car and statute of limitations are finally up 😅
The Japanese really like their cigarettes.. a lighter right were a modern day push start would be 😅
How did the engine, gas, and other operating mechanisms respond to sitting idle for that many years?
Amazing work! Wow! Cool car too!
I like this kind of cars
God loves us so much he sent his one and only begotten son to die on the cross for our sin so pls just give him his time of day  Romans 8:18 “For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.”
What foam do you use inside the car? Also what steam cleaner ? I want a plug in one
$60k easily
I love it except engine bay should have been cleaned with diesel but nevertheless the car looks brand new
Parabéns, excelente trabalho!!!!
KORREEE KHAARRRR
Is it okay to wash the engine compartment? Will it break?
My black b5 s4 needs that love
Here in Australia RX7’s go for anywhere between $60k to $80k
Dang this car turned out super clean, btw I would take either one of the rx7s I had one like the silver one man I miss it
Idk what you can get for it but dang that is my dream car
Грамотно и профессионально , молодцы , привет из Сочи !!!!
Awesome job guys. top notch.after seeing the care and quality that you put in to your Detail and your videos im now a new subscriber. keep up the great work.😎
Japanese made car🚙🇯🇵 理解してる？
I see RX - 7 I click🗿
I owned an RX8...oh what a car!!!What a car...and of course the Rx7 even better...Easy in Europe you can find 50.000€ for that car... Great Job guys... Greetings from Greece...
I use to own one! It had a rotary engine and was a gas guzzler but it was so fun to drive!
Not me watching the beginning while eating 🤮
With those miles and in the barn find, before condition, I wouldn’t take less than $60k. After the detailing, I’d list it for $80k but negotiable! That’s a decent deal but for the right buyer I bet they’d be willing to pay more. It’s a beautiful car!
😮😢
Great video, liked and subbed.   Sorry to bother you with a question, my brother recently bought a eurovan camper, it came with a strong dirty dog smell every time we turn the ac on. We cant get rid of the smell, no matter what we try. What advice you can give us to get rid of the smell?
I mean that’s gotta worth over 100k in Aussie dollars at least
Mükemmel kalite mükemmel araba mükemmel işçilik
It's amazing to see a Northeast Ohio car this old who's entire under side isn't completely covered in rust
Dream car, I used to sit in these at the dealer back when my Dad worked at Mazda. Beautiful job.
I'd give my left nut to drive that car! Such a great job restoring her gents! Amazing work and an amazing piece of machinery!
i think that you should put soap and let for a bit before pressure washing so it doesn't scratch the paint, otherwise it was a great video
You people need to come up with a new word this car was not abandoned  it is really irritating to see you people over use words the owner put the car away for a little bit
Woah, didn't know LHD FDs existed
I wonder what happened to this car? Where is it now?
How do you market to get these type of details? I’ve been wanting to deep clean a vehicle like this so bad but I don’t know how to get the clients
this was my dream car back in the late 90's. Mazda at its pinnacle.
When dealing with mouse nests, corpses or general mess, it is wise to wear a N95 mask. Deer mice in particular carry hantovirus, which can trigger severe and even fatal respiratory distress. Take care guys and keep paying attention to the details.
Mazda RX-7 is the king of JDM
I would rather see the initial wash done the opposite way. Topside of the car first, then the wheels/underside. I'm just being picky, but if you are looking at detail, then the dirt from the top is just going to run down into those areas.
Beautiful transformation. Great job.
How do you find stuff like this?
I've owned 2 Mazda's in my lifetime.   1978 RX-7  and  1992 Protege.   By far the two best vehicles I've ever owned.  Awesome video.
That car has to be worth a small fortune now.
Amazing transformation. I guess the owner wanted his identity kept secret, but I would love to see his face when you returned the car. It’s basically new, even though it’s 25 years old. Keep up the good work.
Phenomenal!!! 🎉 27:33
Stunning work!
Hope that new owner changed the wheels no need to clean them if that car was from 99 in that garage u can smoke em 😂
When I was 17 and in high school I dated a girl whose dad owned an RX-7. He let me drive it several times and it was one of the best driving experiences of my life. Its a beautiful car.
Damn dude, your work's immaculate and percise. Great work!
The only thing I don’t like is the brake discs
Damn that car turned out sooooooooo good. It is immaculate
lucky, this has been my dream car since i laid eyes on one as a kid....easily 70k these days
Poor car glad you took it back to its original form, hopefully the engine turns over, the seals on those rotary engines are terrible and hopefully it gota full service.
You said Jason Kilmer… u had me at hello
B E A U TI FUL
The end result!  My god!  gorgeous
Yo tenia un rx7 y esta muy gaston de gasolina y aparte solo pueden andar dos personas y asii son muy latoso pero corre muy bien al final crecio la familia y lo vendi
Mükemmel.
Warms my heart to see this. The wheel wells alone were game changing. Please always clean the wheel wells. Makes a huge difference.
Went 140, then got scared of it? Weren't YOU DRIVING? CarS guy. Probably one of those sold it for $1,000 B to the S stories too.
i feel mad for the owner for neglecting for such a PRIZED CAR
Something about detailing and lawn care ♥️
The Black Beauty...8800 measly miles...those apex seals SHOULD still be intact! As it NOW sits...$75-$80K
Hang on, ammo in the car, was on the highway and driver got scared then parked it for 23 years? I know a crime vehicle when I see one. Seems like a roadrage car and they hid it after the incident.
Wenn this car is fron 1999 Themen the Tires are waste
It’s insane how rare of a gem this car is. It’s absolutely insane. As well as your detailing job. This completely made the car look like it just rolled off the lot again. Amazing job!
You left the brake rotors rusty. I can't believe it. This isn't a mechanical job, so there's no excuse for not cleaning them.
I woulda kept that car no cap
Detrás de los carros ajenos esperan hasta lo último jajaja
Pristine!
Old car restoration peak, classic craftsman
Incredible 😮 Great work guys!!
As a former detailer I Iove your show - keep the videos coming!  Just a question - I noticed that the dirt from your work seems to disappear into the workshop floor covering - very convenient!  I'm interested to know what kind of cover you have, and whether I could get some for my own floor in Australia.
うんこかよきたねぇな
stunning LHD rx7 XD
good job,rob
The owner unknowingly made a genius decision to lock that bad baby up. I believe its probably worth almost twice as much as it did MSRP
This is the greatest sports car ever
I would love this car in my driveway 😩😩
Now back to the garage for 15 more years.  I can't wait to see that one 😂😂😂
Sweet!
i enjoy watching this video great job ..
Spitzer dealer is here in Pittsburgh I see that name on cars all the time
Fantastic guys perfect performance beautiful...
I love the restoration of the car and the music is awesome.
LOVE!!!! THIS CAR!!! Cool Video bro!
Dumb ass music
Great Job!
It looks like someone just bought this car and put in the garage for 23 years
I would hope he didn't just put it back in that garage with clean for a new wave of rats to invade??? Nice work btw
There will never be a better generation of sports cars than the 90’s Japanese sports cars
So you found a unicorn…cool. #jealous
Priceless!
О боже-испугался и оставил на 23 года...А продать нельзя было🤦‍♀️
No like, 28 minutes y no se vio el carro encender ni correr
how fake do you want it?   Yes all of it.
wow, man! I'll NEVER see another video like this while eating!
U got 5 million views for washing and detailing an old car? 😮😅
The tires didn't dry rot ? Wow
🔥🔥
I doubt there's anything that could be done about the rusty rotors other than replacing them. Maybe driving the car will clean them up some? 🤔
This is the true Forza Horizon 5 in the real life 😎
Beautiful.!  Just one little bit of constructive criticism......a little sanding on the break rotors to remove the surface rust would've made it look 100% brand new.
So satisfying.
Um sonho para muitos 🔝👏
No work on engine, oil, filters. Just cleanup. Why you didn't do everything?
…I’ll take it wtf?!🤯😡 I need a fast car to scare the shit outta me bcuz then I’ll only wanna drive it more😈
8000 miles? wow, it's probably only had three or four oil changes.
60k
how much do you charge ?
How much does this service cost?
if that 2 cars was in my country all die with huge  rust cause of the humidity , wow all that years and you see them in good condition I'm surprized
How much  RX-7 ?
Everything cleaned and refreshed, hope owner would also immediately change the 20++ years old tyres too ...
From Start to finish how long does this take ?
no dry rot after 23 years in a barn???????this seems suspicious...I've seen a lot of so called "barn finds" but something is off about this whole video...
So satisfying to watch.
What about the older rx7??????
That’s a really good and clean job from you guys I love it
드라이아이스건 청소기있던데 그거써보는것도 좋을거같어😮
I have 2 of those sitting untouch for 18 years at my garage... But only 1 that still in good condition... The other 1 doesnt have the transmition🥴🥴
I want the car !!! My dream
PLEASE PLEASE TELL ME THE NAME OF THAT HOUSE SONG WHILE YOU WERE CLEANING THE GLOVE BOX
Why is that logo  different from the regular Mazda logo?
amazing
Good lord, never go to these clowns for a detailing, they have zero clue what they are doing.
so eff'in jealous.. I'd jizz myself if I found a RX-7, lol
half the video is "a word" from their sponsor
pasowałyby tam czerwone zaciski jak hoi
Got scared after 140mph dude
L e g e n d  of a car. Great job guys.
Those rotors need work, you need to disassemble the brakes and pull those out and get the rust off or buy new ones cos that makes the side look ugly
You can tell by the dumbness of the thumbnail that this is fake af
Aren't these worth a small fortune now???
OOOOHHH MY.   😮.    I never buy the whole "the owner got it up to 1000mph and it terrified him, so he parked it". 😐
spoiler: the old man crashed it righr after the restoration.
I haaaaaaate the carpeted wheel wells in 90s Japanese cars.
Dude I could only imagine how good y’all could make my truck look! The orange on it already looks great after I wash it but I’ve never polished it so I haven’t seen the it could be shining
Why does every loser with a random job think people care and want to watch you work. Just go do your job and leave the camera bnehind
I see that no one knows if it runs or not... Lol... It's a rotary and everyone knows they can't sit for too long or they're a PITA to start 😭
My mechanic told me that car tires must be replaced after seven years from the date of manufacture. So I was surprised to see people here cleaning old tires ready to use again.
Wenkel 💪💪💪
o m f god, rx-7!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Amazing Car!  All 90's Japanese Cars are incredibles in design.
23 years and the tires didnt dry out? i call BS
Fake. Dislike.
If someone tried to convince me that the original warranty card added value I'd tell them to take a hike.
Too much for me lol I just 🚶‍♂️ everywhere! Lol its free
Car is worth about $10,000
I don’t understand how a car sits around for that amount of time car isn’t really that old! Seals in those years were garbage not like the first generation
By the way just a tip, dremmel multi tool has a brilliant polisher on it and an extension shaft, the polishing pads on low speed are brilliant, just don't press hard
Looks like a Spitzer badge on the back. Was this found in Ohio? I’m in Mansfield and thought I recognized that dealer’s badge
Its a shame rotary engines died, remember these babies burn 1 litre of oil per 1500 miles, I had an RX8 they are terrifyingly fast
Somewhere in the 60-80k region if that wankel engine is ok
How much did you pay for the car?
Went 10x up in price with that cleaning
só eu q tive a impressão q o vídeo é armado? De tipo os caras lascam o carro pra dps "arrumar"
Those cars are trash 😂 I'd throw it away too 😭
My first car was a '91 RX-7. I still miss it. I would do terrible things for this car, so beautiful.
The mice knew the value of the car and preserve it for 30 years and it was their highest honor to pass on to the big cheese in the sky inside this vehicle 😂
Why? They were pieces of shit when they were brand new and they they're still pieces of shit. What a waste of energy and time.
cool but there's not enough wide shots of the car in this video.
tanto tiempo parado y los neumáticos aun estaban con aire? no lo se rick parece falso, muy bonito auto.
But that FB parked next to it tho...
Great detail.  How hard would it be to remove the rust on the disk brakes?
Cool vid but the music clip is awful. Nice find btw
Shame the engines were made of cheese.
Curious about the tires, were they still good to use? It looks like you cleaned it.
😂😂😂 20 yrs and the tires still in good conditions
Poor Mouse died from the Awesomeness of RX-7
where are y'all located and can hire yall lol 😢
Beautiful
Kamikoto is a scam company and reflects poorly onto creators that are still allowing them to be their sponsors.
this vid had been complete if you did,nt skipped the brake discs.
I dont believe there are no rust
wait. please tell me youre not using 24 year old tires........
Can’t believe you guy showed us the refurbishment but didn’t even let us hear it run or take us along for a test drive.
The price dropping at least 70% even if restored because of age. It doesnt matter if it passed 8k miles: it sat there for 30+ years. So you wont get even close to half price.
Idk I guess I’d give you 5k. It’s pretty old
I want to but it lol
No way those are the tires the car stood on for so long.
I would have definitely replaced those rusty brake rotors.
и за 23 года ни одна сраная резинка не засохла, а мыши грызли только то, что с собой приносили, игнорируя весь пластик и провода.
Haven’t the tires gotten bad over the years?
I have the same one in my garage when my dad bought it before he passed away
Tyres from 1999? Not even if you put 10 million cash on the line
Wow, utter perfection.
What scares me is any time I see someone using any water based products around the seats/carpet it will always end in rusty seat brackets unless the brackets themselves are treated with a rust inhibitor.
Curious to know the year of manufacture on the tyres.
what about the fucking disk break
A car doesn't need to be reliable to become collectable.
Head lights so cool... Обычные блять, штатные
24:50 I use a dull knife with a microfiber cloth to get into those hard to reach areas without scratching.
This is mesmerizing.  I wish I had the patience to do a full resto like this but I'm not OCD enough lol
😁👍👏👏👏
Fake “barn find” but cool video
I didn't crap myself in a car until 145 mph...then I parked it in the garage for a quarter century so no one else would find out about it. Someone's gonna have fun detailing that out. Luckily I wasn't wearing any underwears...they would have been destroyed.
Wow! I’m a car guy in the Youngstown area and your work and attention yo detail is impressive. Where are you located plus phone number so I may possibly send you some customers.
This is top 5 lowest mileage FD’s in North America. A black 1993 with 4400 miles went for $137k on BAT last month and a black 15k mile one went for $75k so based on a particular buyer/market this would probably go anywhere between $75-100k. And I love that this is an actual “find” in an actual “barn”….not some rich guy who knows a rich who got in touch with another rich guy who wants to buy a car that’s safe and secure but hasn’t been touched in a while.
What a find. Those tires definitely need to be replaced though...
You are a talented artist! Well done that was really enjoyable to watch. Unreal the job you did.👍
My all-time favorite car!
I was blown away at the end when you said you guys did it for FREE!
are u
Thats high milage for a Rotary
I don't know why this video popped up in my feed, but oh my gosh was it satisfying to watch you guys restore this car.  The Mazda RX7 was my dream car in the late 70s!  You guys did an excellent job restoring this beauty.  Thank you for sharing.
Such a beautiful car 😢
Oloco
Rx7 é sonho viu 🤤
Brilliant my ass he is a KID 😂🤣🤦🤷🤡
У американцев поразительная способность засрать свою автомашину максимально за короткий период! Машина прошла 14 000 км, обычно в России это 6 месяцев эксплуатации (для Америки, с их расстояниями и поездками - наверное еще меньше), а выглядит так, будто в ней бездомные 5 лет жили! Ужас! Просто свиньи... P.S. не надо рассказывать, что это все сделали мыши! Мыши монеты и бумажки накидали под запасное колесо и сиденья?))))
エグい汚さやな😢
WHERE BRAP BRAP BRAP?
This one earned you guys a sub... The work put in here is phenomenal but just seeing the restoration of a rare gem of Japanese motor sports like this is absolutely nuts... Imagine owning this car and it's just sitting in a garage for a couple decades untouched by humans and housing a mouse colony...lmao... What a beautiful ride...
Mazda RX-7 was my first car. First model. The most for a young dunce. Very good memories. Bought in the summer of 1994. A year later, I sold and bought a Mercedes.
Someone came to their senses after only 8800 miles. lol
where in Ohio was this found?
lmfao taught me everything i know... you wash cars
OMG to find one in such perfect condition WOW
Watching this beauty to get it cleaned is so relaxing
This the car that C5 corvette copied. It’s amazing that now it looks so much better. Proves the originality of the design
$75k + easily
Why not steaming the glove box?
staged bullshit
What happened to the other RX7
Looks better than new. I saw  a R1 or R2 in the San Francisco Auto Trader a few years ago with around 15k miles, upgraded wheels and the owner was asking  $70k for it. It was blk/blk as well. With only 8800miles, and bone stock this could bring in more than $70k to a collector.
any1 know the title of the song at 2min 49s?? 🙏🏽🙏🏽
You can probably get between 45k-50k for that
thumbs down for the 5 minute figgen infomercial.
U won't get more than 15 grand I promise
Good video, but had to stop watching, music sooo off putting.
Trabalho incrível, mas esse carro não ficou guardado 23 anos mesmo!
How much would a work like this cost?
Well it doesn't appear with anything about the car at all it was about how to clean the car kind of stupid I mean who doesn't know how to wash your car
what paint protection did you use
After watching this video, it makes me feel like I've been doing it wrong all this time. Like when I go to the car wash and washed it myself, I did nothing to it. Just rinse n that's it lol
and how do you expect us to comment this?  absolutely great job was done.. nothing more to say, just wow..
I would have still purchased a Honda over this trash….😂
So did I miss where they said how much it was worth? Lol
Got to 140 and retired the car because he was scared.... how about don't drive 140... hope he sells
“Took it 140mph and got scared and never drove it again” …bruh.
lol
Keep it stock if possible...this is absolute jewel. It's sold around or more than RM200k (USD44,480) in Malaysia.
Was that a gun holster in the dash and a noose in the trunk?
I'm frustrated because ppl are overbidding for these cars so that they can flip them.
You had me until Kamikoto, i lost all respect for this channel.
Eso tal y como estaba de ratones hay que quitar todos los tapizados, asientos, consola delantera y central, moqueta, incluso revisar el techo. Por no hablar de quitar el motor fuera y revisar cableado...
Looks great. I would get rid of the tires and get new ones. They are old and not worth saving.
Is it working
150k +/- 20k not for less the mileage are insane low and with all the dealership papers it is a perfect collectors gift ;)
bro thats a garage not a barn
What’s the price of this car and what’s your price for the detailing  stay relevant?
На мій погляд.багато речей зроблено абсурдно.маю на увазі підлогу....непроклеєні на картах місця вразливі перед нанесенням хімії.непоказано детейлінг пройомів.в цілому молодці але на superStar no no no.
This is witchcraft at its finest 🫣 !!! Love these JMDs cars , not my favorite year but a classic never the less !
Do you know anyone that does what you do in NYC?
Did you guys use any covers before washing the engine? I thought you should remove the battery and cover fuse boxes etc
hm, if i ever see a vintage car in mint condition, i'll assume there were dead mice everywhere and sloppily shampoo cleaned
He got scared of the car- just don't go 140 mph again!!
Siiiiiick
id say 25-30k
I hope it got new rubber before it hit the road. What a beauty.
Were the tires not dry rotted after all that time? Great job. What did he do with the car since he was afraid to drive it? Great job!
The sad truth is that this will go back into someone garage (collection) and sit and collect just as much dust for the next 30 years.
Wait what happened to the car??? Lol you guys did a great job. Keep up the great work!
I always wonder what happens to the mechanical side of the cars? Brakes, bushings, suspension and all that?
cool stuff
priceless that what is worth!
What a great job! Kiddos to you guys!
Странный подход, чувак сначала моет снаружи, потом двигатель, потом опять снаружи. Пылесосит коврики и пол, потом вытряхивает мусор из под полки, и опять пылесосит пол. Почему сразу не разобрать и вычистить? Или я тупой не понимаю американский подход?
anyone knows what is the name of the spray used in 4:08?
80,000 is my guess
Cuando veo este tipo de videoprograma de IA siempre llego a la misma conclusión y es que hay que darle tiempo y tendrá tanto sentimiento que te llegará a romper el corazón. Muy buen programa, Saludos
thats insane. I had a 1994 in pearl white. Crazy how much they still go for
Bro stop sponsoring scam knives......Nobody who has michelin star uses kamikoto.
What about the older blue rx7!!!!
Hey man. Son of a carpet cleaner here.   Easy on the sudsy stuff.   Imagine brushing your teeth without rinsing.
Beautiful job 👍
That's before they started to use some type of soy-based products to insulate wires so now if it's mice or rat get in they eat all the wires
$25715
With the number of years those tires have been off the road they probably should be replaced
I went 140+ on the highway and got scared. "No" the guns and boonze I had on me had nothing to do with that outcome.
I see fb next to fd 😮 I love both cars
Serious motor!
The rusty rotors look like crap, car looks amazing.
If a new car is parked for decades, the price can double or triple the cost of the latest model.
Fun fact from an FD owner. In stock form around 140mph the car gets very light feeling and steering becomes less responsive as the car feels like it's floating
Is that true that the car was not able to turn on?  I mean, been abandoned for so many years I don’t see how the engine could survive
Car value?
Please don't advertise scam knifes, do a bit of research and you'll find out pretty quickly that they are really low quality knifes and almost none made in Japan. with 500k subs you don't need to take that bag so badly... cmon
Thank you for sharing.  I love seeing cars coming back to life like this.
How did you clean the rust of the brake discs? I just got mine replaced and they're already rusty..
This is NOT a fucking barn find. People don't just pay the kind of money that car used to cost then after 8800 miles decide to just park it and never drive it again. This car was purposely parked to be able to sell at a later date for a large amount of money.
From Lorain Ohio.
This is a great video and all, but i will act like i didn't see you clean barn find tires instead of ordering new ones 😞
Missed a spot.
IT SHOULDVE BEEN MEEEE
Man, if that detail doesn't make the owner feel like driving it, I don't know what will. Crazy good transformation!
Эти идиоты не отключили акумулятор, когда мыли двигатель.
the car's a beast, competitive line against Toyota supra in Fast n Furious 1, about $30,000 msrp back then, now would be much more than that after the inflation and the collection value, could be worth more than $100,000 if condition is mint I would say.
23 years just sitting around, and that's how it looked ? come...on....was there 0% humidity and never a change in temperature ? Why did the mouse/rat just die and dry out on top of the engine block ? Makes no sense at all.
Здравствуйте! Машина продаётся?
Calling it bull 💩 there's no way in hell that those tires 🛞 would be any good after 23yrs
this can be a $100k car easily
who does that?? he got scared of driving it, so he just let it sit??
Why not pull the carpet, God knows what's under that.
What a beautiful car and a loving and extensive clean. Well done
No one ever shows doing anything to the headliner.
ive never seen anyone jet wash an engine bay. thats a new one for me.
Looks great but if it doesn't run it's going to want doing again after it's fixed
That rotary engine 😉didn't leak any oil
Based on previous sales at BringATrailer, this car is probably worth somewhere in the range of $60k - $90k.
would of loved to hear the engine sound too😂
SAを生き返らせて欲しかった💦
why is that when i see someone using a brush for washing the interior it feels like they are trying to be extra? I understand why its being used, just my reaction everytime lol
I’m always hesitant to wet down my motor, fearing I’ll damage electronic components
Pop the glovebox out and clean it.  Love those washing tools, need to get a set.
MY FAVOURITE RIDE OH MY GODD
its killin me that sum people are soo lucky😢
please let me know if the owner is selling it! i would like to purchase it over
Another pathetic fake "barn find" lmao
Move over E-Type… Perhaps the prettiest car ever.
Lucky fuckers od love to detail this
Fake.  Look at when he pulled the boxes off the car.  The boxes were staged.  No different in dust patterns.
Damn he also has a 1st gen too
tem que mandar a policia da casa desse sujeito que deixou esse carro abandonado ! esse cara cometeu um crime
もう一台は、サバンナRX-7？
SCAMS SCAMS
I need to know what vacuum you’re using please
hey guys! outstanding job! I'm no expert but just an advice, for the engine bay, I'll recommend first blow any dirt, don't use pressure washer you can damage any electrical wire or band, specially on a car sitting this many years, then blow it again with a help of a microfiber towel to dry it and an extra add some plastic protector.
Imagine cleaning tyres which are >24 years old 😂
So your just cleaning it? So the title of a found car is completely false then, isn't it?? Owner asked/hired you to clear car? Video of cleaning car??
23 years and you do not change the tyres?
Every coment? Ok so have a good weekend ;3 You did the great jab ^^
Freakin gold mine
I don't think the Pirelli PZERO was made in 1999
Are u crazy ? Powerwash the engine ?  really ? Oh come on guys ! Dont do that !
which kind of liquid do u have to clean in side the car interior can u plz teel me the name
Они думают помыли, натерли и все. Это малая часть работы с этой машиной, перебрать все узлы, сменить все жидкости, резинки. Мыши погрызли скорее всего проводку и жидкостные магистрали. Толку от этого блеска если машина не готова технически?
I had trouble getting spilt redbull out of my cup holder & yall are out here removing 20 year old dead mice making it look easy😂
Did justice to a nice car
Only in America stickers would increase the value of a car lmao 🤣
I just wanted to hear that rotary fire up!
100000 +
That was an oddly satisfying and relaxing video, thank you!!
Bro the brake kalipers are rusty so change that
Slow the cuts down and remove the music and this would make great ASMR (:
You know what is demonstrating that you are incompetent? Keeping the 23 (!) year old tires and not replacing them with new ones. It's absolutely inconsiderate and a safety hazard. But all the rest is well done.
Out of all the different cars I've owned over the years, the fd is still the one car I regret selling.
the mice stayed there for 20+ years without rotting? omg that car is a pyramid
can i have that car? thanks
Why did you not cover the alternator???
The story was weird... drove it at 140 MPH and got scared so he just left it in the garage?
Is there another video where you go through the mechanicals and maybe start the motor?
so you're telling me the owner bought the car, used it as intended and just abandoned it? LOL  (I have close to no driving experience and I know little to nothing about cars and their capabilities)
You did justice to what I think is one of the most beautiful cars built.
How can the car be running after 24 years in a garage without even swapping the battery for a new one. An old battery that sat for 24 years will be dead and unable to hold any kind of charge. I call bs.
i can't stand these cars still exist somewhere to rot
might wanna check into Kamikoto lol.
ART❤️👌🔥
Beautiful car shitty brisket😅
Could you do a video series where you clean my car every month for free so I don't need to bother doing anything
Horrible...
"New car too fast, got scared, stash it in the garage for 23 years" Talking about rich 'Muricans
It amazes me how many abandoned cars are being left behind in barns.
Someone's gonna love driving that around!
fake
Treated this girl like the queen she is, from every little detail! Made me smile all the way through. This one of my dream cars fr.
I don't get it. What's with the rusty brakes?
I bought same model without the rear spoiler about 1994. I paid 15,000 used. Gotta be 100k plus today. Great car.
I'm from morocco love that chanal
The amount of attention to detail you guys do cleaning the FD is just spectacular!
I miss cars having lines like this. Current trend is mostly angular and square lines.
What about the headlights😮
Do things smelling like mouse piss and shit really up the value tho? Fuck having something that nasty
You're in need of a dry ice blaster. For detailing w/o damaging metal or plastic.
You need clothes for this job 😅and good job
Should of did undercoating and rust proof underneath
This is a fake, fake and fake video. You're so sloppy you couldn't even stage the dead mice properly
I love car restoration/detailing videos.  Ive been watching since before the pandemic.  Ive heard thousands of reasons why a car is parked and forgotton.  (Best one yet, guy disappears nearly two decades ago in a company car.  Never seen again.) But this one is a first. Loves car.  Drives it 88k miles.  Drives it criminally fast and gets scared of it.  Presumably the car operated well withing normal specification parameters when being driven under legal speeds. Im sure it was something of a handful at race speeds.  Still within spec, but at the cars limit.  And well beyond his limits.  Still, this seems really out there.  Like the millionair who lives the life of a homeless person because he thinks his money is evil. (True story.  1980s millionaire lives a destitute life, San Jose California) But to park a perfectly good, just broken in car because you use it illegally and it scares you....(assuming it was illegal speeds, not at a track day in a sanctioned event)  Thats a new one.
Very lucky owner indeed, thoses mice could have made a mess of this car...
"He drove it 140mph and got scared of it, and parked it ever since." H-He knows you can just.... NOT do that? Really?
Why do all the cars on this channel have exactly the same amount of dirt/dust on them?
How much you want for it
A super duper transformation! You guys are great.😃
I forgot cars actually came with ashtrays back in the day. Lol
I had a ford probe of the same year, I feel like I'm looking at the same car... same components... what a trip. I love this car. To let the mice have it at such low miles is unbelievable. I hate mices to pieces.
S0 beautiful if I could I estimate that cr with its milage at 35000
The RX7,is my dream car, when it was introduced. I'm retired now at 73 yrs old but still that car is an extrem find and I had a rotory engin RX2 belive it or not I could beat a Corvet in a quater mille take off.
That paintwork doesn't look like the paintwork of an 8000 mile car. I'd be very suspicious of the milage, although it is a good clean example.
Those Kamikoto knives are cheap junk, and an absolute rip off. It will do you guys a world of bad promoting them. They are ridiculously overpriced and very poor quality.  DON'T BELIEVE A WORD OF IT, PEOPLE!
Fabulous transformation, too bad you guys couldn't drive it much( if it starts at all) cause those brake discs are an eyesore. Anyway great video thanks guys!
What year is the car?
How many hours did this take
Check all hoses and gaskets for leaks after driving a few hundred miles.
80thousand  all day original with provenance  possibly 100k
Hope you had a mask on that rat feces can be a killer to breath in.
worth at least $50k😊
I will literally do anything to have this car. It's my most favourite car ever.
зачем ты на своей ебучей рекламе уже показал сзади её помытую, я нахуя видос смотрел?
Those tires must need to be changed
Wow the condition of this Rx-7 is insane. Literally looks like it came out the dealership! That owner is extremely lucky to have this, im super jealous hahaha, good job with cleaning her up!
в моих глазах это самая красивая машина в мире! Обожаю её!
damn that car is still hot 🔥
Awsome job guys.
that dealership he bought it from is local to me... my uncle probably sold him it back in the day. looks amazing now
25 year old tires?
What's up guys you'll do great work that's what's up nice xr-7
the floor carpet on the driver's side is not well cleaned, you can see that there are a lot of crumbs left
Excelent video!! Saludos desde Argentina!
Trash 🗑️
At least 10,000-100,000 dollars
idk if you are ready my comment or not you should have scrubbed the disc brakes with sandpaper and should have heated the Exhaust these 2 things disappointed me although everything was perfect.
Your videos are fun to watch, really but that background music AAAGGGHH!! it's just awful I have to turn it down. Please choose something less irritating.
You guys did a great job. Especially on the paintwork. Black is always a difficult colour to keep and look clean, but looks sublime when it's deep clean.
make a sleeper car😂tune it
those coins will rare
What town are you in? I need to know, I'm going to have a car delivery too you guys. Give me your address or phone number and we'll be talking. I will pay you guys and have it pick up and taken to Youngs Town Ohio for repair to get running. Please help me out for a surprise to my wife 80th birthday.
I would like to own this car. Is it for sale?
I don't understand  if the  car scared  him why didn't he just sell the car   instead of just letting   it sit now who  ever buys it is probably  gonna   replace the seals to the engine    if he  decides to sell it
Why in America do they not use snow foam as a pre wash ? Whole point in snow foam is to take off most of the dirt as a contactless wash, in European detailing scene anyway
That is a sexy FD RX7
That car is mint.
A million dollars!!!!!
rare gem FD RX7
That's a beautiful car for its age....I would buy it
Beautiful vehicle.  Is the vehicle still available?
Damn, It's a 'New' car..........
That came out flawless now y’all need to do the other Mazda in his garage!!
I'm sure there are hours of detailing not in the video. Door jambs, hinges, trim, etc. that are cleaned and polished.  Awesome video.
@04:06 Super Clean makes this job easy as pie; it makes tires look brand new too.
Absolutely stunning please come to Melbourne Australia
Rock and Roll.👍👍👍👍🥳🥳🥳🥳🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
Where did you get your brushes?
As an old school detailer for almost 30 years in Texas. It is super cool to see a younger generation take as much pride in their work. You all give me hope that bad ass detailer’s will continue to exist.
Whst about brake rotors...
Are you doing this for the current owner or did you buy this?
Wow such low mileage, probably worth $25K or more, but I’m more of a Honda guy but if this is RWD, that’s even better
Parabéns meu amigo, excelente trabalho.
An RX7 would sell for < eur 25k in The Netherlands. probably with some more distance on the clock but no reason to match up to usd 100+k... This one has low UV damage because has been standing in a garage, thats good
@Tonywestdiy maybe you should also watch out for such a great barn find 😉
Great Job Guys looks to be about a 30,000 car now!
I would go into debt to buy this car, thats so beautiful it makes me want to cry. I was dreaming about it last night while watching this video.
:O  drool
Those mice look staged 😂
Это Мазда малышка
😁👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Muito bom,sucesso...
RX7 looks amzing guys
Ready for the car show!
смотрел с рускими  субтитрамы то ты часто под музыку говорил спасибо и иностранец)
7000 pounds.
just checking if you read every comment so if you do heart this reply
Wow~~! It is a real jackpot. In my country(S. Korea), classic JDM cars are really hard to find.
Besides, I couldn't tell you how much I would absolutely love to own a FD RX7 with the original 13B-REW, and especially with only 8800 miles on it. It is my dream car. I wouldn't care if it had 188,000 miles on it, it'd still be on my bucket list. It is absolutely gorgeous as well as timeless.
Bruh, I had my new BMW up to 135 MPH the other day, but I've also owned many turbo high horsepower imports, so that didn't scare me at all. It just made me smile.
Something not right about this one.. car was too clean for sitting that long..
Imagine just opening up a garage and randomly finding a Mazda rx-7. 😅 lol
外気導入口からエアコンフィルターまでの清掃までやっていたら完ぺきだったのになぁと思うところです。 もしかしたら、そこにネズミのし甲斐があるかもしれません。
if i were gonna go through all that trouble to detail that car, i would have bought new rotors. the rust is out of place.
How do we get ahold of the owner I want to buy this car
Brand new RX-7
Sexy as hell I need to get my interior done so bad :(
You guys are blessed to have this opportunity forsure
Eating a lot of steak will eventually lead to clogged arteries and heart attacks. Just look at how many 50 and 60 yo s end up dead.
You should put a bigger engine
There are many beautiful cars in the world….but none of those cars has the lasting appeal of these RX7.
Just amazing!
Woooooo toda una joya😍😍😍
is the owner selling this car? please send me a message. thank you.
just started watching the channel and yall are the best
👍👍👍👍👍
Beautiful
Them cars right now worth ten Grand
That's valued between 30k to 70k in great condition as it's untouched/unmodified, I hope this gem is protected going forward
Would definitely get new rubbers
Hi, would you or anyone be able to provide the names of the songs used in this video. Particularly the first one. Thank you!
Стрёмный ролик. Выложил  как пол фильма колеса моешь и полфильма машину.
Wow I'd like to take this beauty for a spin.......
That's a $50,000 car, 8,800 mikes! Forget about it,
I know you will probably sell it for more than a 1000 dollars but one car enthusiast to other, I will give you 80000 rs(approx 980$) right now to sell it to me, if you still have this or any car like this, DEAL?
the sad 1st gen rx7 next to it
ネズミが固まって死んてでたの怖いです
What type of pads are you useing on your buffer , for black finishes
You wash the battery !?!??!?
Devi cambiare i pneumatici, perché hanno una scadenza. La gomma diventa dura e perde le sue caratteristiche di aderenza all'asfalto. Non le puoi semplicemente pulire!!
How did this guy get scared😂
what i want to know is how or what the owner used that the mice ended up all dead and decomposed.
No concerns about moisture getting into the trunk lid with the spoiler removed?
I cant believe how people can leave these nice Cars during long time
I'd love to purchase this car if it is for sale. Let me know
THIS was up in NE Ohio?! Holy smokes, what a find! Where's your shop located? That's up near my neck of the woods.
How much did you pay for the car?
Polishing a car's paint by hand?  Wow, I didn't know that could be done, I thought it could only ever be done using a machine.  Said by the kid in the video that never heard of anyone polishing a car by hand before.   LOL somehow I'd bet he has never used a toothbrush that wasn't battery powered.  The word "manual" refers more than just transmissions.  I still remember the day when my friend bought a 1966 Ford Falcon, all black, the paint was as hard as glass.  When he first showed it to us it could have past for gray, but after polishing it by hand for hours it ended up looking like the day it rolled off the line.  We had no paint decontamination products back in the late 80s other than soap, and all we used were rags, an old bath towel ripped into chunks.  We did have the same chrome rust remover that is still used today, that completely restored the chrome.  It did have one dent that his father knocked out with a few blocks of wood and a tire jack to do the pushing from the inside.  To completely finish everything the paint, engine, wheels, chrome, replace the anttinia, and deage the rubber molding around windows took 80% of a weekend with 3 people working on it by hand, nothing but elbow grease, manually.  btw that RX7 came out amazing, other when a few harmless mice & some paint swirls it looked like an easy job for you guys, if it was sold, how much did it go for?
I would say not more then 65k worrh
Unbelievable that you didn't bother to cover the alternator and various other solenoids etc, BEFORE drenching the engine bay!!! WTF???
Hey guys, I emailed you about two cars of mine, an 88 Chrysler Conquest and 96 Mystic Cobra that I rescued that could use your expertise. Great videos.
from 25-40,000
Wow just absolutely amazing I love these cars and this is the most beautiful one I have seen amazing job truly amazing 😮😮
Great Job, Guys :) - this car looks perfect!
I drove one of these right off the show room floor as a test drive. It handled soooo good. Switching lanes was incredibly quick and fully under control like a go-kart. Awesome power too.
too many ads bruh
Yahoo! 🎉🎉🎉 what a beauty!😮
I am ready to pay whatever amount you want for that
I love how well y’all clean all these cars up as good as you do. Especially buffing and polish. I just buffed and polished my white Tiburon it turned out good. But it needs work in the paint still. Good job guys 😎
i thought it was bad to wash your engine
I’d get some new tires asap and replace all rubber bushings, all rubber hoses etc, 23 years of sitting is def no good
How much does a master detail like this cost
$35.000
5:13 is the kid in the back of class with my shiny folder
I have never seen such a nice mouse family....🥹
r we just gonna pass the fact u just pass fb and didnt say a word bout it
What brand of polish paste you used?😊
My guy got scared after going 140 and parked the car😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nice
You didn't change the tires?  Changing all of the fluids,rubber and the battery should have been the first things done - even before the wash.
Worth 3k
Damn
Great job 👏👏👏
imho showing off your hard work indoors does not do your effort justice.
wow
Always with the mice. 😮
Шутки шутками, а нашим козлам в России ещё поучиться у вас детейлинг делать! Молодцы, респект вам из Москвы!
Да вы че! Самое главное забыли! Камеры сгорания надо в первую очередь парогенератором итпулесосом чистить!
Обезараживать глиняный брусок...
Субтитры угар!
If you want I'll help yall out and give you $1000 bucks for it , LOL
1:06 i was eating...
looks amazing u guys killll itttt
Nice video. Question: is it good to use the current tires from 23 years ago? Or is it necessary to replace them?
Those tyres are expired
Beautiful. Amazing transformation. Hopefully you replaced the tires that are 23 years old lol
As someone in Ohio I would love to see it in person because it is my dream Japanese car
Wonder what the owner has done with the car?
how s the tire still in a v good condition
???got scared just dont drive it as fast😂😂😂😂😂😂
Incredible detailing. The nook and cranny cleaning was especially satisfying to watch get done
Ah I miss the cars from the 90's. Those were the days. 😪
i'm not sure of the year; you mentioned 99; so i figure thats what it is. With it only having 8800+ miles and shape it's in I would say it could bring $65,000 to $85,000.
You guys do an amazing job. I just can’t imagine what that poor car would have looked like if it didn’t get garbaged. The amount of dirt and garbage that was under the seats and in the trunk was horrible. I’ve seen less in cars with thousands of miles more on it. I sure hope the owner cleans it a little better the second time around.
This should be a crime! Leave a beast like that in a garage for 20 somthing years. . . No!
Absolutely amazing, it would be nice to like drive it again after so many years. Absolutely amazing ❤
What a sweet little ride! Great weekend getaway car!🖤🩶🚘
Who made the brisket? Lincoln Riley??
falto pintar las campanas de freno trasero, detalle inaceptable
What is the name of the music playing in the background after minute 7:00
Awesome job! That is one beautiful car!
$12,000. maybe more.
That was awesome.. but what about the condition.of the tires after so many years ?
Диски внутри забыли покрасить,  ржавые видно.
Awesome video!! You all did an excellent job!!! Keep up the great work
My dream car I'll never afford
he drove 140mph got scared and he just parked it for so many years? LOL that's the funniest weirdest thing I've heard
Someone through window, remove door panel enough to access locking mechanism, work free lock, force open door. Don't give up!! 😎✌️
1st time watching your guys vid's, and I do have a question if I can explain it right and if you have the time I would like a answer, (You may have been asked this before) Do you guys ever use a car buffer on the carpets as you vac the cars or a orbiting sander? ( no disc of coarse) It does shake the holy crap out of the carpet and pulls ALL the dirt and mouse crap up so the vacuuming up a lot easier. Just make sure your doing the vac and the sanders at the same time Just a thought. you guys did a great job on the car.
WOW!!!! great job
Tommy f yeah has entered the chat lol
yormom  tech  it
Man this is a super great find. I wish I'd come across a RX7. To sell it in mint condition, upgrade brake system, suspension and coilovers. I would say 45 to 50K.
this is just a wild guess i dont know how much rx7's are worth but id say in my eyes being pretty much brand new with only 8k miles on it id sell it for like 30k?
Wow “Barnfind” 😂 it’s a stolen Car.
You take detailing to a whole new level !!!!  #mindblown
The car came out looking great. I was hoping to see you do the other Mazda that was in the garage next to this one. I like the older ones more than this model.
Saludos desde Argentina. Muy buen video. Yo no tengo vehiculo, me quede pobre. Bendiciones para todos.
Es el mismo que modelo que uso Han en retó Tokio
Is the car for sale?
Eu não acredito, p mim é tudo montagem
It is actually pretty rare to find a factory new original non-modified RX-7
you will drive this car with 23 years old tires? Very dangerously!!!!!
this has always been my dream car and always will be
WOW...One of the best details I have ever seen!
Am I a joke to you ?   Awesome find, had a red one myself back in the early 00’s 🤙🏻
after 23 years with pirreli p zero tyres , nice joke!
May i ask how can you afford to do this for free?
It’s insane how rare of a gem this car is. It’s absolutely insane. As well as your detailing job. This completely made the car look like it just rolled off the lot again. Amazing job!
I think you did a very Good Job in This Carr but  I have a Question  ... What kind of Protection did you used for the Paint  ??? 🤔🤔🤔
at auction many of these low miles FD RX-7 have gone for $80k... i dont see any reason that this one wouldnt be worth $50k+.. now that is a great barn find
Showroom new fellas
My car could use a clean like that. I’d love to clean her engine and everything else under the hood.
Y’all’s shop is really nice. That’s cool. Things to aspire to.
It's a piece of art!!!
Surely the tyres and rubber seals will be useless after so long in disuse. Most bearing would be suspect as well. I did a car that had stood for 5 years and I had to change all the seals, rubbers,shocks etc the engine had to have all the gaskets,seals bearings and rings, bearing an rx8 I’m sure the compression seals would be shot
Where did you find that flooring? , first time watching one of your videos.
Shame you didn't de-rust the brake rotor as well
12:07 he was having gta maps
What about the other car bro ? 🙂
Would love to work with you guys doing this sort of thing only problem I live in England you guys do a Wicked job 💪
How does it run? Everything work? Oil leaks? How about boot belts and bushings?
Very good job.. 👍
You guys do this _for free_ ??
Nice
does anyone know what's the other car in the garage ?
I would start at 100k if I were to sell it. I would suggest an alternator bag. Spraying water into them can be bad news. I'm pretty sure they make a specific product to protect them. Elastic banded and everything.  Thanks for the great video!! I love the old school RX7s. I would love to see that 1st gen that was sitting there next to this one, get some love!!!
999999999999miljon€
What a beauty
Looks good
字幕に出てくる外国人ラッシュでクソ笑ったw
One of my all time favorite cars, I'd probably have a heart attack if I was able to get one of these let alone find one like this!
Why are they Always in Ohio? Never have I ever found any?
Are those tires really 23 years old and not dry cracked?????
BEAUTIFUL MACHINE still after 23 years 💯🔥
Looks amazing! Watching from Australia 🇦🇺
The last time i saw this car was in 1997..someone parked  at nearby restaurants where im having my breakfasts.one of my dream car n thank you guys for uploading this video for which bring back my memories  of 20s now lm 60..fan kuala lumpur msia
With the attention to detail you guys show , I'm surprised you don't pull the carpet out to deep clean and dry. It's not that hard depending on the model, and allows further cleaning of otherwise non reachable areas
i like this car, mazda rx 7 is my fav car
Why the other RX7 was not detailed? Or is this it kept for another video? I feel sad for all cars that get dumped in garages or barns…
that  moment when the original owner noticed that this car had no difficulty to be faster than any muscle car of that times, he was scared in a level that it lasted 23 years, the power of truth is too long and strong
Now that's one of the best barn finds  I've seen... Heck.. 😍
Great job and a beautiful car. I hope whoever owns it replaces those tires before driving it.
I owned the exact same car but in red.  This car has the R1 package on it.  There were very few of them in this country.  Happy to discuss. I sold mine for more than I paid for it after almost 15 years of driving it.
What part of Ohio are you located
Hello!!    What happened to the rx 7 Blue??  That is one of my favorite styles, I would like to see a video of the restored Blue rx7, which is next to the black one, when they open the Garage!    That black rx7 was beautiful!  Good job!  💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
It astounds me that people let these cars get into such a bad state.
Beautiful video
Awesome job!!
The JDM Car Series Mazda Rx-7 FD
Amazing work bros
One of best JDM sport cars built design time less like Supra 100k car
That’s amazing work making it look better than it did. Great job!
Stop pushing useless junk knives!
Hello I just want to know how to get that other blue Mazda Rx7 that was in that garage 🙏🏽 please I’m from New Jersey …
Is rubber that old safe to drive on?
Excellent job.
...mmm and no need to look under the ole hood for mouse and rats nests ???
I am literally speechless at the results - what a beautiful vehicle once done...👏👏👏👏
What is y'all's favorite color to work with and is the most satisfying at the end.. I see y'all put the same effort in on everything but was just wondering
Best find ever!! great car
Did a good job cleaning, didn’t start the motor. Make a good first prise in a raffle. No idea what it is worth, depends on who wants it, I would love it but could never afford it.
Why do they always find dead mice in cars that are left for years?
Never saw you clean the heater/AC ducks or the cabin air filter.  Main source of mouse pee and nests 😢
For a car that only was drivin for 8800 miles then sat for 23 years there's a lot of crap all over the carpet everywhere
45000 usd
It looks outstanding, you guys did a great job!   It's been sitting for so long... Does it run? I know that isn't your area, but I was hoping to see that part of the revival as well!
Looking fwd to much more on your channel. Been a long time fan Robby Layton  now one of yours 😊
That’s a gold mine
At 8:53 the driver's side rear quarter panel appears to have been repainted, and it was poorly done at that.
I’m always angered when I see videos like this? How come I can’t find cool shit in a barn 😤
My Dream Car !!! 💛
can I have it, thanks
Great job!
Lucky MFers
I bet you guys couldn't do this to my truck!
bro you just made that like from hell to heaven😍
Sweet.
Rotary 🤑
The older RX-7 in the same garage...damn, that's such a cool car collection
What's the other car parked in the garage? You're not cleaning just one car only for the old man right?
is this car for sale
Ainda bem que não abriram o motor, quem já viu um motor do rx7 aberto? É coisa de outro mundo.
I had one of these.  Yes I got it up to 140mph once.. only once.  Scary but I didn't garage it after.. lol.  Mine was black also.. brings back memories
What a find , wow , this has to be one of the best original rx7 on the road today , incredible find.
Aku suka bagaimana caramu untuk membersihkan sela-sela maupun sudut-sudut tak terlihat di bagian dalam mobil😍😍
How did that much stuff (the receipts and paperwork) get under the seats in only 8k miles.  wild.  If I bought a brand new vehicle and it only had 8k miles there would be a single piece of trash in the vehicle at all and all paper work would be in the glove box
Where can I get that cradle for cleaning the wheels and tires? I need one
タイヤ新しいのにしろよ😂
Amazing 🤩 Looks immense, great job
How do you do this for free?!? It’s so many hours of work!
Its funny, most “japanese steel” is just recycled scrap
How do you get barn finds. Like do people just give them to you or do you just go to abandoned garages and find cars there? Because I’m tryna find something cool like this. 🤔
What would you charge for this level of detailing?
Lovely job, added service thought would be to underseal the floor and wheel arches … the wheels were off and car on a lift so easy to do and protect that almost 25 year old metal ❤️
Why didn't he just sell it and let someone else get the pleasure of driving  it. Some people are just so stupid
A 5k mile RX7 similar to this one sold for over $100k on bring a trailer.  This one should get similar money.
Are you going to sell it? I would love to buy the RX7
It’s a beautiful MDFKR. What can i say.
Don't let Rob Dham see this ...
I’m more interested in the first gen RX-7 sitting next to it.
It's basically the most beautiful car.
how tf do you abandon an RX-7??????????????
What product do you spray on to clean cars?
Take the glove box out there is stuff behind it 42,000 my price o thinks it is worth
Wow ❤
I can rate this 5 out of 10
I was looking up initial d cars and thought this was Keisuke's but I still like the end look 👍
For sale?
My favorit car😎😎😎😎🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro, is it OK to wash engine parts with water? Does it make any damage?
A stock RX-7 with 8 thousand miles? Priceless
Those mice had rigor mortis for decades 😂
You guys do an awesome job. do you know of anybody as dedicated as you guys in the dallas area? one of my dream cars by the way! great job
O.G !!!💥💥💥
Az öreg alig bir mar menni. Fasz amerikaiak ..nem valo nektek semmi. Semmit nem becsültök!
U gotta change those tires… they are ovalized
All that work, and its still just a Mazda.
Worth more than I’ll ever have. I’d sell my soul for that beautiful car.. honestly.
I'm jealous! Thats from my area, I recognized the dealer, amazing find!
Elle est en plutôt bonne état pour une voiture qui a été abandonnée pendant 23 ans l’intérieur est presque nickel alors qu’il y avais une 10aines de souris morte dedans qui d’ailleurs avais l’air d’être morte depuis très peux de temps à mon avais ce gars a acheté une rx7 en très bonne état et là salis exprès pour faire croire qu’il rénove une voiture abandonnée
とても綺麗になったけど、エアコンを作動させたら臭そう…lol
So sick!!!
Wowwwwwwwww 😳👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Are there DOT numbers o. The tires? If so, what are they?
Its just not a car...its an emotion
His reason for not driving it is baffling to me. Just don’t drive like an idiot. I have a corvette and I ain’t been pass 100 😆
i wish i could get one for myself.. but the prices are to stupid high....
Is it ok to pressurize the engine and other electronic parts of the car? after you wash its components, is there any short circuit that happened after you try to start the car?
120k right there
You should review your sponsors. Kamikoto knives are a complete scam.
I have been subscribed for 2 days by now and every car you have found you made perfection keep up the good work and btw that RX7 is worth about 31K to 35K!
Finding this car and making a video is like going live playing poker with bigfoot. Its insane
You guys do this for free
Bonjour elle est en vente ? merci
I need a car like that
One other question you cleaned in the bay and didn't cover anything I was always told that it would mess up alternator is that a myth?
Fb reels brought me here and i am not disappointed you guys did a badass job and that brisket looked like it was on point as well lol cars and meat the great American combo good job guys from dahlonega ga! 💯🔥
When a fine specimen of a vehicle is parked and preserved, remember to buy a car cover and some rodent traps....
Did you just used steam to remove the baged?
need new wheels to look better but its a very good car recommend not getting rid of it :D
Luar biasa👍🏻
It's that alternator still working? 🤔
I dislike that is not mine
Bro, after cleaning n fixing, easly, 20,000
No one gunna talk about the car on the right 😢
Barn finds lol next is carport finds, tent finds and omg look....driveway finds. More frikin barn found cars than there is barns in world. It might be an off grid barn find next whoa that's trendy to say! Idiots
Amazing work!!!!  What does this level of detail cost ?  I didn’t know that much work could or would be possible. Thanks for the excellent video 👊🏻
Well, well, wasn't expecting to see another RX-7 that has been sitting just as long as my FC barn find was.  You did a fantastic job, it'll be a long time until mine looks that good. She's in a bit rougher shape then this one.
Вы что блять его в музей собрались ставить, долбоебы??
Man I'm so jealous you stumbled upon this. My all time dream car thats just impossible to afford now a days 😞
Great video,  amazing recovery.👍
How was this car tagged in 1999 when the car wasn't produced yet ?
11:04 is this seriously ok???????????i always wanted to try but i'm scared to do it lolol🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's kind of wild that he parked it but I'm sure someone will buy it and have it for many more years👍
I had a 1987 RX-7. It was my favorite car I’ve ever owned
The RX-7 has been my favorite import next to the late 90's Supra since I was a kid... I'm 35. I would do damn near ANYTHING to have this finely preserved example. I'm in awe of it's beauty.
I was surprised with the amount of chemical you guys use, why you don't have any eye protection?
Incrível, surreal! Só poderia mudar a cor das luvas 🧤 na hora de fazer a propaganda das facas... 😅
beautiful
Those were the best behaved mice ever. True embassadors of their species.
Like new again!
Wow, love the vintage motors but this one's a beauty 🥰💥💥💥
55,000
Whats up with first gen
You all do an awesome job, but, you should never ever spray water directly onto the engine... and especially not the alternator, you're asking for electrical shorts and with the pressurized water you're asking for it to get into connectors which will rust them out, it looks good, but that kind of thing is going to be horrible for the car down the road.
how do you find these garage finds??
Top-of-the-line. Your knowledge, skills, and work ethic are unmatched.  Car looks absolutely beautiful.  Those rusty brake rotors though??? 😭
The vehicle probably would go for at least $60, maybe $65 Grand
I want that car so bad, that has been my dream car since it came out. I was born in 1990 so I remember seeing these as a kid at car shows and dreaming of having a black one but life has got in the way and never would have the money for one
Probably shouldn't pressure wash the engine bay of an old car. Water will get in the relays and computer box and potentially the throttle body or Mass air flow sensor
Beautiful result !!! I’ve always loved the RX-7….. Awesome job of giving this one a new life (:
this car is too clean for 23 yrs old.. this video only good for Content.. nthg else
impossible thr Tyre still can be used after 23 yrs
Get under glow
Absolutely beautiful 🎉
You guys definitely wash your ass before your face.
amazing ! i love the black colour on the fd !!
Awesome blew my mind!?
Give me a price
there is a storage just a few minutes from where I live which is a rural farm area with dozens of 90's Japanese vehicles including RX-7's.
$60k as is
why did u take the spirit r badge
The Spitzer badge shows that it was from N.E. Ohio
yas yemen sana,a ok ok ok
It’s worth like 40-50k
Get the FB too 😮
Great job, looks fantastic. Just hope those aren't the original tyres from 1995 especially at 140mph.
Are those 20yr old tires safe to drive on?
What a truly amazing find and an exceptional, museum-quality restoration. Job well done! That car looks like it just rolled off of the assembly line. For the paint protection did you guys put on a ceramic coating? Again, well done and thank you for bringing this beauty back to life!
How come nothing happens to the electronic components in the engine after that power pressure wash ?
Not only did they get the rare car but they also got what looks like a rare pistol holster from ww2
I’m so jealous
It just needs a touch of Rob Dahm
Hope you guys didn't ripped off the poor old man, looks like he could use the money!
What happened to the 80s rx7  on the right..
Sieht besser aus wie beim Händler
Dawg how TF y'all let a working rx7 get that dirty
Shout out to the Mazda engineers and design team for making one of the best looking cars to ever come out of Japan.
Why would someone get scared of a car at a 140 they knew what to be expected when they was doing it, scared him so bad he never drove it again 😆😆😆yea right.
easy 50k
You probably must replace the engine oil and all fluids before turning on the car.
one of my dream car....huhuhu
Noooooooo MONICAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!
Amazing find guys !! Mazda would buy that back from you for sure .
So many bad processes ESPECIALLY NOT COVERING VULNERABLE AREAS FROM WATER SPRAY. If I was looking to buy this car I would use this video and how it was cleaned to negotiate the price down.
Lol, you're being sponsored by the scam company that owns kamikoto junk knives (proven) and established titles. Cant take this channel seriously anymore, unsubbed.
Did you really just pressure wash over 4 open screw holes into the trunk lid the probably has no drainage
こんなに綺麗になると気持ちいいよね😊
very nice job did you guys use any undercoating
Looks like the car on the right is an earlier RX-7.  You should detail it too.
I hope the oil, fuel, coolant, transmission, diff, power steering and brake fluids were all changed right away, especially the oil before starting it.
Of course in OHIO 😂
Judging by current FD pricing this thing will be somewhere in the neighborhood of 75k
how much would a detailing job like this cost?
What the heck. He went 140 mph and got scared? Very interesting story.   Beautiful find!!! Nice restoration!!!
How much did you get it for
Wow, HAZMAT city! But, great! 🤩🤩
Hey guys, I was wondering, do you guys ever come to Minnesota? My uncle has a crazy old school, badass Mustang that’s been sitting on his farm for over 30 years now and I guarantee you that you’ll absolutely LOVE it!!!!!! I just wonder how it would look all restored like you did this one!!???? 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🤟🏼 I’m not sure what kind or year, but it has the racing seatbelts, it’s a coupe & it just screams FAST & BADASS!!!!! Let me know.
I’d say around 50K??
🤯🤯 That’s just absolutely gorgeous!! You guys did some of thee best detailing I’ve ever seen someone done on a vehicle!!!!! 🤟🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Do you guys have a ballpark number for how many hours this took you to detail? I’m not even joking here, I think that I’m more impressed by the detailing more than I am of how rare of a car/find this is!!!! I have crazy OCD & would love to learn how to do it like you guys!! Anyways, WONDERFUL job on making it look like a brand new, showroom floor car!! 💯💯💯
Nice 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
Inspired how a little elbow can make a big change.
How much does a deep clean like that cost roughly
I don’t understand how you can afford to do these details for free? That’s a lot of time and production for $0.
bro took it over 140 and set lemme let it rot
Is it for sale 🤔 👀?
M.uygd
whatttttttt??? 23 years???? its a fd😒
Tyre also 23 years old still can used?🤣🤣🤣🤣
wtfffff your getting water in the alternator … so stupid. are you flops for real?
This is a high 5 or low 6 figure car I think
Heiii...let we see you drive it..
2:04 am amazing
What's the cost on a detail like that? Curious. Thanks
What is a barn find? And also, how legal is to pick a car out of it 🤔
How it started for the first time in years and did not blow an apex seal instantly is the most mind blowing thing!
Worth 2milion $
Cannot believe you removed the dealer badge.  Any reputable restorer will tell you that provenance is crucial.
I pulled a 1991 325I convertible out of my aunts garage with 27K miles on it. sat since at least 2004. Found mouse nest in the same 3 places. Unfortunately they ate the front light harness and the original shifter boot. The glove box and hood liner were absolutely nasty.
Beautiful car 👌🏻and never realised how therapeutic watching a car valet video could actually be 😂😂👍🏻
Great work, but please, disable battery when wash motor
It so satisfying watching it getting clean up like brand new. I can’t believe people don’t look after a beautiful Mazda RX7 . It’s so rare to see those car now. The owner is right the car is very fast
Great work brothers, take love from India ❤️
Such a thorough job! I had a 1993R1 probably sold it 97 for like 10,000
Can you get me a price on the 1st gen rx7
For free? Wtf I’m in California 🙁
what do you guys used for the decontamination spray?
How do I contact regarding a car that would be great to restore? My wife’s dad past away a few years ago and one of the few things they have left of him is his 1994 single cab Tacoma. It’s been sitting for nearly a decade and I know it would be such a gift to give my mother in law to see it shined back to hits former glory! Help me out WD Detailing!
If you’re still reading comments after two months, you might want to pin this one.
Wonderful job guys! I wish you were in Northeast Calgary 😂
very satisfying watching the clean up.
Still has a weird American badge on it. no complaint on vid. Just seems odd imo coming from out of America.
250k
400k
Did u check the dates on the coins  also could have been also valuable
Look new
Ended up selling it for $2200 on ebay
So satisfying 🔝
O wow 🤩
You should check out those coins you found in the car. There is a chance they could be worth something! There are all kinds of little things that make coins worth more!
Bro said he does for freee , i love you man ❤
Ever since the original fast and furious movie, the cars showcased have skyrocketed in value. I haven't seen an eclipse, supra, or RX-7 go for less than 15k in almost any condition.
Trzeba być kretynem z Ameryki żeby kupić se szybki samochód zobaczyć że jest szybki i zostawić go w garażu. Taki talmudyczny kity można sprzedawać tylko w Murica 🤡🍟🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔
Everytime you power wash an engine bay I want to choke you guys.
You Boys did a trick or two on that car. Brilliant engine.
I've been detailing since I was 9 years old, and I'm 64 now, and let me tell you that you guys are incredible ! I thought I took things to the nth degree, but I have learned a lot watching this video.  Time for me to 'raise the bar' and do things better.  Thanks - GREAT video !
Large yellow onions work best on windows we truckers used this trick to get the road grime and dirt off of them cut it in half rub it on and let it dry then use spray away  glass cleaner and news papers to clean after drying
Where is the car sound?
kamikoto＝Made in China　　Japan doesn't make such half-baked knives.
You make it look too easy…🤣👍🤙
This car is worth around $110,000. Would be $150k+ if it was a Turbo. But, definitely a beautiful find!
I'd love to see a will it run from these types of videos
Nice surface clean . Next time pull the dashboard and the fender liners .
i bet there are dead mice in the cabin air filter ! more interested in that 1978 RX-7 , i wish there was a detail shop like yours where i live , you do nice work !
Some modern wheels and this car will turn every head
こんにちわ。 本当に見事なまでに綺麗になりましたね！(oﾟДﾟﾉ)ﾉ
Amazing job! How mutch time to do this? How mutch cost?
Those tires look brand new.
My only hope is that they don't take it out on the road with those tires
Awesome job looks great
Man you guys did a good job. •• @officialstaticvsbags
Amazing work you guys.  Wow!  I also just picked up a 94' FD RX-7 that had been sitting for almost 15 year, albeit with 85k miles and a bit more scratches and dings.  Bringing it back to life, but it doesn't look anywhere near as good as that one.  Great job.
Insanely done man kudos the amount of hard work is unimaginable 👍💯
Har ni tagit isär motorn och rengjort den,har ni bytt alla bussningar på hela bilen?
80k easy for this car
Google it
dude i wish I had luck like this
All that and you left the RUST on the ROTORS?!?! 🤷‍♂
This car with this condition,  miles and sheer perfect paint would easily fetch over 125k right now. Depending on the motor it has but incredible job guys. #masterful
$40,000 grand
What the best way to clean the seats of a 2006 f150 king ranch?
Such a  wonderful work you  guys did  car is brand new again .
Kinda sad that the FB sitting next to it didnt get the same love and care as the FD😢
Outstanding detailing. 👏🏼
I woulda left the dealership emblem on there. Its 100% ugly but its a part of the history of this particular car and its owner, and that type of stuff generally means $$$ when/if he goes to sell
Personally, I would have kept the dealership badge. I love seeing an old 1960s or 1970s survivor car driving around with every single detail still intact. That dealership number plate surround, or window sticker or badge on the trunk lid is all part of the "untouched" history.
This shit is 18 minutes too long
Super😨😜🚘
What a Beauty 🔥🔥🔥🔥
What non mechanic people do Not realise with cars that are not driven for even a few years require a major resto & $$$, waste of time washing tires - need instant replacement with new. Rubber seals/hoses - brakes, A/C compressor and inside  fuel tank / fuel system must be a shocker. Yes it is all fixable depending on how deep  your wallet is.
Hey bro r u in vegas i wanna get my car detailed
Wow, that was an amazing transformation!  Great video and great job.
$60k car
OEM everything !!! So beautiful ❤
Nice job bro!! Always looks awesome..!!
Did this have the winkle rotary engine in it?
why didn't he sell the car to someone who's not afraid to drive it? how much would this exact restoration cost?
HOW MUCH
Black is beautiful!!!
How did y’all polish? Like what did y’all use and the steps?
The legend car cleaning.
Coming up brand new after that long is a real testament to the qaulity materials used in Japanese built cars. Such a work of art from Mazda! This was a very satisfying video to watch, good job guys!
You guys could've done something about the rusty break discs they look poor (rusty)
what kind of jack is that?
he got scared of a car that stock will lose to a new nissan maxima lol. story seems sketch
look my old barn find! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRmfarqgaTw&t=23s
....no brum brruuummm?
What do you use to get the mouse urine smell out?
What a luck to find something like this....I am jealous
I will take rx 7 from the 80 better
Amazing to find the car. But just one question why not take the tires of the rims? Wouldn’t Detailing just the rim be easier? The rubber is dead after that long
the only thing i see on the car that is a problem is that disturbingly large muffler needs a sports exhaust
This is incredible. I am speechless.  FD RX-7 was a dream car of mine when it came out (it still is).  I still remember going to the Mazda dealer to test drive it as a high school senior and my mom followed me and beat the crap out of me thinking I was out of my mind. 😂😂😂
Never thought I would see the day that two generations of rx-7 would be in the same garage.
Only thing that kills me is having to see those rusty rotor’s taking away from such a glorious detail job.
Wow dudes! phenomenal! She's a low-mileage example but that freaking black turned out beautiful
RJ bro, those pants got to be tighter. 😂🤣😂🤣
I am super jealous
Dope find but honestly I’ve came across cars like this before may be lucky but if 🐁 behind dash high probability or electrical chewed
So they they just find it and steal the vehicle
Why did you show end of Rx7 at the knife advert? I didn't want to watch anymore. All of the suprise has been gone
no way
My first duty station when I was in the Army was Okinawa Japan in 2007. The first car I bought was a Nissan Skyline GTS-T (no not the GT-R lol). The heater core died in that and was going to cost way more to repair than what I paid for it. I was dating a local Okinawan woman at the time and she ended buying me a 93 FD Rx-7. I married this woman.
The car was parked because the owner was afraid of it?...WTHeck?
I love rotary engines
I would buy k series and put it in this, I respect the engine and I love how the rx7 looks but I can't deal with the engine
It’s like the murder z but the driver had since 😂
Keisuke Takahashi and Kyoko Iwase would like to thank you.
Столько челиков пишет про то, какая классная тачка, но никого не смутило, что этот ебанутый залил пеной и водой под давлением подкапотку? Он же просто взял и запорол генератор, датчики, мозги. Хорошо хоть клему с аккумулятора скинул, хотя он мыл его прямо в машине (ахахахха). Повезло, если после такого "детейлинга" не вылезет фулл хаус из ошибок на приборке, заработает электроника и не накроется движок в целом, от попадания воды в воздуховод. Хотя черт его знает, накроется ли ротор от такого, по идее тоже должен. В общем мыши в обивке - далеко не самое худшее, что произошло с этой машиной. UPD: Посмотрел бы я на ебало лоха, который купит это убитое бездарем на видео корыто АХАХАХАХАХ
I'll take the rx-7
Hi there, you should inform viewers that they shouldn't eat meals while watching this material.
I found my last fd rx7 in 2017 and it had been sitting since 2001.  It had 68k miles.  It had a mouse nest in the cooling fan.  And an ant colony under the passenger floor board.  Other than that it was crazy nice.  I paid 10.5k cuz the guy just wanted it gone.
If owner want to sell this car I’m interested
That was my dream car when I was in highschool... In cherry red. It came out when I was a freshman in 1993... In highschool I had a 1989 RX7 that was bad ass
That meat being cooked was tragically overcooked
That car is worth a shit ton
that engine pressure washing... though...
Quick question for You.  Were these cars offered with an automatic transmission???
The mice was a car enthusiasts that's why they decided to live inside of it and decided not to fck up any wirings, they also probably know that their house ( Rx-7 ) would go up in value in the future  and decided to die inside of it.
Fake videos 😮
Man, the mice in my neck of the woods are real assholes.
After you clean up the FD and change out all of the seals and gaskets and put new tires on it, it could be worth $50,000 to $60,000 depending on the car market
Show room finish... Beautiful example of an iconic legend...
Fantastic job and an incredible transformation. New to your videos so I have to ask: is it your standard process to leave the original tires on the car when cleaning it? 24 year old tires would be dangerous as hell even if they only had 8000 miles on them. Hate to think of someone driving it on those.  Then again, you're not a mechanic shop, you're detailers. Maybe that's an unfair question. In any case, the car looks utterly amazing when you got done with it. Marvelous work!
istimewa bro👍👍👍
Wow...abandoned legend...this car is sooo sexy
The market for the supras,r34s n 35plus the nissan is high here in East Africa,guys doing an awesome job here,wonderful,open up shop here thats the vibe,positive energy crrates elevation
My favorite mazda
wow, my dream
I am surprised the owner didn't sell the car after being scared of driving it
perfect work, you are god
Profitable Flip I bet!  Looks nice, I preferred the previous body design, but in the black & the 5 spokes that looks great.   Taking another stab at this.   Looking at the mileage, this poor gentleman by not driving the car often enough, may have had not been able to Pass his Ohio E-Check emissions, & just decided to park the vehicle due to not being able to register it.  I  myself having a relatively low mileage car at that point.  Pulling mine out in spring with relatively little driving time (& perhaps lack of good weather) to register, had this issue myself (the tests were yearly & we were charged for them).  I always ended up needlessly taking the car out on I-90 & having to "open it up", not sane, safe or good for the environment to ensure it would pass.  Always made sure I was away from traffic when cleaning it out.  Remember test driving the new design '88 over at Bedford Mazda, a stripped down manual was relatively affordable at the time (< 13K if I remember correctly, about the same as a equipped MX6 which I actually went to look at).
Knives did wonders cutting that dry overcooked brisket
One suggest for the begging of the video píxeled the dead mouses
Omg.    O lucky
This car is so sexy what a dream!!!!
Good 👍 job Man.
its a treasure!
I wanna do this with my ford escape but I'm scared too, i feel like if I were to pressure wash my engine and such I'll damage the fuses or something
The brakerotors?
27:25 I'm surprised you guys didn't do anything with the Rotors. that rust sticks out like a turd in the punch bowl.  other than that the car looks pretty sweet
I guess the beast has been re awakened.
Remix of "What About Trust" by Mindme
Amazing work guys wish u guys were here in Wisconsin but love the work and the effort u guys doo 😎❤️💯💪🏻💙🤙🏻
Was this in ohio I feel like I'm close to spitger auto
Wow! All I can say love seeing finds like this brought back.  Look up DJ Krush from Japan.  You might like using some of his tracks in a future video outro-Period and origin correct- Great work.
I’d say $35,000
Top
How much do you want for the car?
Nice video.  But all you did was take a dirty mint car and clean it up  completely.  Top and bottom  . But good job 👏 👌 👍
So it looks like it's almost perfect shape  .
The fact that they do it for free is insane.
I would have taken that 1st gen sitting next to it!
Hey I live in Cincinnati Ohio wonder how much would you guys charge to deep clean my front and back seats
So how much is it worth?
Muito bom  sou  Londrina Paraná Brasil
Is it a 1994 R2 twin turbo?
FOR FREE?!
Any recommendations on a good interior steamer/cleaner machine? Looking to clean up my car but not sure what to get that won’t ruin the material. Awesome video!
hello how are you. its a beautiful car I was a kid when this beast rolling around . in front of eyes I saw a viper and Rx7 race and viper took off but the second gear this Rx7 killed the viper what a beautiful scene to see and this is not track race it was on a road light race. and I am sure this thing cost with this many miles 80 to 90 grand. low miles.
Check the filter of the car inside the engine bay because mice nest there 😐
Would like to see you guys detail a 69 dodge charger or winged mopar car some day.
This dude is playing forza horizon irl
I like RX-7’s and Mazdas in general. I have a Miata and absolutely love it.
I would like to purchase one of your car's at a reasonable price, please let me know how.Thanks.
SPECTACULAR!
U guys are a true professionals with amazing attention to details.  My OCD wife will definitely find this therapeutic.  Finally someone who can clean better than her 🙂
wow
Love this car so much....but....the story and the find..ummm....i'm calling fake!  That guy obviously collects Mazda's.  He had that first gen Rx7 right next to it.  It's like you pay top dollar for the vehicle and then act like it was a rare find.....it's almost like the people that happen to find abandoned vehicles in the jungle with rusted plastics!  Would of just been happy with the cleaning and fixing up a Rx7 part only.
nice but it's the wrong year fro me.  It's a pretty car...  unlike most of the cars made today.
The car is worth alot but please don't sell it with original tires. Someone's gonna wreck and killed
Can't believe the owner got scared of a 250hp car lol. He just don't need to be driving at all.
If I remember correctly, this had a Vankil Rotary Engine
Why  bother. It has a gas engine. Are you going to do an electric  conversion?
Added $2000 value after your hard work . Great job .
Привет из России
good job man 👍💪
Whom do these barns belong too? How do these peoples go and open them? Are they confiscated?
Love the work you did on the RX7.  I almost purchased one of those RX7's Touring Models in Montego Blue many years ago.  Looks like you took that one back to like new condition.  Love the work. 😄👍
Really hidden gems
Did you spray the insides with Lysol or some strong disinfectant? Gross on the dead mice. Yuck.
Feeling 🤢 with that 🐀
id have killed to see his reaction! beautiful car
I am surprised you didn't get new tires being how that car has been in the garage since 1999.
Looking factory new. Beautiful job.
Awesome car, definitely a helluva find. BUT sidenote...imagine being scared of a car that puts out just barely more torque than the 4 dead mice in the glovebox did. (Only kidding, and probably just jealous!)
Went 140 and got scared of it lmao maybe dont go 140 then.
I wish you could do my s2000 😭 great job guys!
This is an amazing car and transformation. But the back story… how about the previous owner not drive 140 mph and be scared of the car!
Wash the engine with the battery?
Where the hell would the mice get in? Wheres the entry point?
Did you buy it ?
not bad, but many things you lost, or dont shoot this action on this video
Is it possible to get a list of tools and cleaners you used?  That mf really clean!!!!
You kids didn’t spend enough time extracting from the carpets and seats. Looks like ass
Beautiful wish I own on e
50k
The miles and the information that was in the car. I’d say it’s easily 120k and over. This is immaculate condition. It’s so desirable by any jdm enthusiasts.
How do you find people that have cars like this???
nice
I'm so jealous of whoever owns this.
Ohh man! Absolutly like original brand new again.
Spitzer?  That dealership is close to my house....
That shit has gotta be like 200k right now
Too bad you guys couldn’t have bought that car!!! Looks freaking awesome
Stunning result! Nice work.
Only had to watch 100 ads during this video  you tube is really starting to suck
Great job and the result is impressive 👍🏽
Now THAT'S a detailed wash. Satisfying to the max
thats an rx7 r1, those are REALLY rare
I'm guessing that one has to be pretty well off to just decide that a brand new car is too much and just park it. I bet he/she was in a very scary situation where they lost control of it and narrowly avoided a bad accident, or something to that effect. Nonetheless they were just able to park it, pay it off, and purchase something else to drive. If only..... 😒
Great car and a great video! Would be awesome to see the final result with a before-and-after-shot of specific areas and the same with the whole car! Good job, guys!
HOT   Little RX-7
burn the sh1t
🙏🌹🙏🌹🙏🌹
Y’all really chose the worst song imaginable for the fresh detail reveal of this beautiful RX-7. Absolutely wild.
Nice job !,  love Rx7  powerful car!
worst part you left those brakes rusty 😔
And the alternator say good bay after this. Happens on my mazda...
What about the order RX7 🤔
I had a 93 RX7 Touring for about a hot-minute in the early 2000's. I remember my Mazda mechanic, who I trusted emphatically, asking me why I bought that POS. Fast forward twenty years and they seem to be held in a totally different regard with the values rising dramatically. All I'll add is that without a doubt it was the best handling rear wheel drive car I have ever had and I have had a lot of performance cars in my lifetime.
Can show the tyre year
You guys work for free??!! How come????
It's crazy that 23 years and the engine is still running
The value of this car just went through the roof. Basically someone buying a rx7 as close to new as possible. Beautiful.
После такого количества мышей надо  ковёр подымать.
So fake but good for the view
WoW 😍😍😍
I’m baffled by the explanation lol. “I went really fast and it scared me so I left it to rot in the garage.” Okay, well like you could just _not_ go that fast. Or at least sell the thing to someone who would have driven it. But whatever I guess it’s better for you. Lol
Its worth like 300k
That car is easily 50k+ privately sold. What I don't understand is how THIS car would remain hidden for so long.  I would know if even my most distant relatives had an FD in their possession. Don't forget to retreat the undercarriage and interior since you used soap. The anti-corrosion 25 years ago isn't as good as today! Immaculate car. Good on you mate.
Just a normal garage in Ohio💀
Can we get a owner reaction ?
These cars are worth a lot of money. In Australia where I'm from your looking at $50k to $150k but in that condition and low miles the owner could ask for more.
Uau great job congrats fron Brazil
Nicely done.  My advice though is if you wash the engine bay, take out the battery and cover that alternator.
Unbelievable. Great job 👌👍
神事、初めて知った😙少し包丁の使い方が違うような…
You find a gold!
Excellent detail cleaning job guy's
I test drove one when they first come out didn't like it
I’d take this thing over any super car literally the sexiest car ever made
It looks brand new again holy shit 😂 and the dude had an FB parked right next to it god damn I miss my 83 😭😭
Todo bien menos lonque no debían hacer ; lavar el motor y accesorios con agua y a presión.
make sure dont steam close to exposed dash steam can get in behind but great vid
The Dude cleaning ain't  messing around. Nice Rx7.
You guys are the best of the best you killed it
When you’re done. All original RX7 FD 8800 miles 65k+ with maximum ease 100k+ to the right buyer
One of my favorite car since I drove it on the first Gran Turismo release! Love it ❤
Sometimes a dealership badge does in fact add value, especially with classic chevy’s
It is insane how good that car cleaned up. Nice job!
dont give away the final result of the car during your sponsored add. Total Buzzkill!
The backstory doesn't seem believable at all. Who buys a Mazda Rx7 drive it fast once then dump it for decades?
One of the most beautiful cars ever designed in my opinion. I'm from Columbus Ohio and remember seeing one exactly like that at Ricart Mazda in the showroom when I was buying a 1993 Mazda Protégé. I was just out of college and it was my first new car purchase. I desperately wanted the RX-7 but there was no way I could afford it. The Protégé was a great car though. I drove it for 5 years, put 200k on it and sold it for $2500 in 1999 and bought an Electron Blue Honda Civic Si. Great memories.
Jackport!!!
looks like the owner didnt care about how dirty the inside of a brand new car looks.geeeeesh
really surprised the tires were still that nice after sitting for that long.hard to believe.
Do not let that ride go to some loser who wants to strip and modify it,  that car is worth a lot more in original condition.
This is so fake
Wrong information given by this video...after 23 years air in the Tyres are ok battery is ok means already this car is running daily
That cars sooooo clean, and I’m not talking cleanliness
Excellent job guys!  If I had the money I would buy it.  I’ve always liked RX-7’s.  I had an ‘81 and ‘83 RX-7.  What did owner do with the Blue older generation RX-7?  I love that body style.  Love your videos.
Aewsome job.
Amazing car and an amazing job done. Talent
RX7 Tubo fast car I had a white one in my boy racing days,
Most car guys that know would've had this on their list of dream cars to own. Thank you for treating it so respectfully!
The link for your Obeck polishing and cutting products is down
I’d say it be worth 150k to 200k
It's very good working, beautiful car
Nice job guy,
Ok, so now washing a car is a restoration😅
Nice. Hello from Russia.
Сукаааа такие пиздаболыыыыы!!!!! первая мойка за 23 года Божеееееее!!!! машина выпуска до 2002 года,ролик выпущен в 22.выглядит довольно ухоженной,просто грязная.. просто пиздаболыыыы
I don't agree with taking the badge out...its one less of straight out of the factory
So you're born in 2003? 😂
Awesome
Outstanding!! I’m sure the customer was more than satisfied! It is great to see someone take so much pride in their work! Cheers
Es recomendable que se cambien las llantas pues en 23 años ya están caducadas y es un riesgo muy grande el usar el vehículo con ellas.
Não mostra o carro andando nem funcionando...
Чуваки,мой вам совет, снимайте аккумулятор при мойке..а то попадете на кеш ✊😎
As the English say SPOT On.👍👍👍
My girlfriend showed me the tiktok of this car, and I had to watch the YouTube video to learn more! I am a major JDM fan!
Нормально чё, чистый автомобиль помыли
After watching the video I would expect a proper look around the finished vehicle   -  - very disappointing
Hola, what's about the other Rx-7 beside that one you gets, light blue , let's me know , Gbls men
Buy a race car, get scared then park it forever 😂. When I bought my F80 M3 it scared the shit out of me and I wanted to drive it even more!
How you can use a 23 old tyre and clean it up???
That's at least a $30k car in that shape after the detail and the extremely low miles.
Awesome!!👍👍
as someone who wants an RX-7, i'm happy it got a bath after 2 decades :)
An excellent work on the clean up and restoration
Beautiful car.
30K easy. Maybe more.
🇮🇷🇮🇷
I dont know much about washing the engine on cars especially with the wires and everything but isnt it possible to cause water damage to the engine? Again I have no clue just want some clarifaction on this so I know the facts , am interested in washing the engine of my car but scared to
Sooooo… you go 140 in it and get scared so you park it and let it ROT!?   Ummm… ya know… you CAN drive it below 140 right?  What I’m the flying F is wrong with people? Seriously!?
Washing engine area with water ?? Goodl luck to next owner....
How long did it take to get detailed?
Thank you guys for preserving this absolute beauty of a car❤️
Um....what about the other RX-7 that was in the garage? That one would be great to see done.
So you have another 30000 milles till engine failure.
I came from Snapchat to see this 😮
Used worth 40-90 k
Livery
Would dry ice cleaning be an option for efficient cleaning of  tech areas (engine, wheelhouse….).? Anyway: great car - perfect result!
Kamikoto is a freaking scam company produced in China not Japan, please be smart and dun buy fake knives
Quien chucha guarda un rx7  23 años en una bodega??  Pero gracias al que lo hizo podemos disfrutar de este limpieza profunda y restauracion de pintura en el auto !!
大変状態の良いRX-7ですね👏 綺麗になってよかったです👍
reminds me of the tv series breaking bad, the family had a lot of money but they couldn't launder it so easily so they didn't know what to do with it, this car could have belonged to walter white's family, it's as if it came out of the store and was never used.
How many man hours did this take?? Amazing!!
This car worth 30 grand
The price once hit 10kusd in my country Now the price skyrocket
The worst part is that is going back to the same dirty garage😭
Who else is here from the Tiktok
7:15 what the fuck did they do to that poor meat
أنا لاارى شيء هذه الترجمى حجبت كل شيء
أنا لاارى شيء هذه الترجمى حجبت كل شيء
Awesome work! As a detailer/technician i always worry about directly spraying the alternator. What are others thoughts?
in all honesty as a barn find. i wanted to hear it start up and  pulse like rotorys do. thats what any rota head wants not just watch it be cleaned i have the same car in my carport and could wash it myself
The craziest part about this is the end..can’t believe all the hard work you guys put into this for FREE.
One thing I dislike, is that I don't own it lol
Need new discs and brakes
Who buys an RX-7 and gets afraid of it?
Тормозные диски можно было обработать анти ржавчиной,сейчас фракции ржавчины будут взо содействовать с колодками и пойдут волны.... Так всё клёва! Конфетка....
you need an a video editor, who make your videos more attractive and engaging, if you like i can.
How do yall find these cars and the people who have them. I do detailing in Texas and I'd love detail cars like this.
🤤 me after seeing this beautiful car...such a legends car like this should be on the showroom! and i bet if this car modified , it will be an F1 car like i seen others YT guy modify this car till it hit more than 1000+hp is surely insane!
How is it that all 4 tires weren’t flat? There’s no way they would hold air if they did air them up. They would be cracked and weathered. Oh well.
What that blower u use for interior?
That car is worth it's weight in gold! An FD3S! Damn! That is just an icon! Pure Automotive Porn!
How is the rubber on the tires still hood though
Insanev
Cleaned up 100k
Good job but that definately needs new tyres, not only because of the age but also the massive flat spot visible at 04:00.
Thats A Jackpot <3
That car now is even more rare because it was the last year it was Rx7 till they came out with the RX8. A true masterpiece that should be enjoyed , not in a museum.
Awesome car and great work cleaning up! Just one thing I thought you didn't have to do - cleaning the tires. Even if they were brand new in 1999 today they are absolutely not fit or safe for driving and must be replaced
I think it’s worth keeping it. Or find somebody who really loves JDM!  Even in Japan it’s hard to find people willing to part with these for less than 15k when in good shape.
こんなにも綺麗になるのか！
How did you find out about the RX-7  and how much did you guys buy it for it
It's fun to watch the process of cleaning various objects. There's something satisfying about that.
Unbelievably beatiful car that is my nr1 dream car u guys are lucky!
It would be cool if it was black on red and it had red brake callipers
Fail. Why didn't you sho2 us the owners reaction?  FAIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
aint no way yall jus sprayed the engine like that got water in the alternator 😮
In such a pristine condition. I love it
i didn't know i can cry this much.just wow
R2 Package with 8800 Miles?! Those Average at $46k when there is no Damage from Standing around for that long, this one can easily go 50-70k+
only in ohio
Idk but this looks staged. First wash after 23 years? Do you see how clean and pristine the car looks? Those mice nest looks sketchy as hell lmao
This is probably what I plan to do with my 2016 Scion TC after it's paid off, I'm going to park it at an in door car storage and just leave it sitting until it becomes a rare Vintage car. I'm actually going to fix my Camry and get it back on the road, I'll be driving it possibly in mid Winter To all season. My next car will most likely be a Scion FR-S or a Scion XB second Generation.
Great find and beautiful car. What was the foam spray tool you had? Looks pretty handy, I want one!
原廠的狀態，好完整，好完美。
To get it 100%, we needed to apply the ferrous decontaminant to the brake discs to remove the rust, but it was a show!
never wash motor  with water....
Hi great work ! Do you sell the car? Contact me. Thanks.

About a $55k car
Wow I'm so jealous right now. How can someone not lose this beast?? Holy hell.. awesome job guys, also crazy amount of adds in the video dude.. seriously
Why can't I find something like this?  But seriously..  Are you sure it's not hot?  Are you sure you can get a title?
So if going 140 scares you, um, maybe don't go 140??  Also, taking off the dealer advertising made my day.  I HATE those, especially if they're on the paint!
Why no leather conditioner for the shifter  skirt and no dressing for the rubber mouldings? Overall a nice detail.
What happened with the Rx7 FB that was sitting in the garage next to it?
Details for free, wow!!  That’s a tedious task.
Nice work done.congrats.
Pov you're here from snapchat
Can't wait for someone to take this really clean example and put some coilovers, wheels n tires, and an exhaust and just honestly enjoy the stock clean example of this car for what it truly is and was!
Is that car for sale?
How in the hell does a car with under 10k miles, 1 owner, have all that trash under the seats and under the spare? Anyway,  generator work, awesome video,  thanks for making it, and congratulations on all your successes.
I literally have wet dreams about owning an Rx7 but I have an RSX so it sounds close enough for me 💀
Easy a $40k car especially if it’s the turbo model. Those Miller Cycle engines rev’d fast and high rpm’s!!
What about the topside of the glove box, or did I miss it? ,If so I apologise
Nice
Trying to find my 77 280z I sold miss it
I wish someone would this corvette been abandoned here t tops anniversary model I forget year have to look on plate again
Do u clean Gas Tank out because of water and old gas
Mazda
Is that a Toyota or Pontiac
Just like a sword
What are I using to clean it again
Like my girlfriend car got a Mustang only 67 thousand miles on it
I love cars that's amazing
Such a beautiful FD   Speechless.
Spending way too much time showing you cleaning the wheels and tires
COMPLETLY AMAZING & STUNING    !
WOW!!
Это-Чудо просто!!!!
This knife is not made in Japan.　  Kamikoto?  It's not Japanese Kanji.  This is made in China.　If you want Japanese knives, please come to Osaka or Tokyo.
70k+
I remember seeing this Gen RX7 Brand new in a showroom for the first time , next to a New Miata. It was awesome. These cars look so good still today. Amazing car! I can't imagine what the fuel system looks like sitting for that long if the tank is even any good. But that's minor stuff for a preserved survivor like this. Amazing find , rescue and revival!! Looks amazing , you guys did an awesome job!!!!
It's nice to see one of my fy cars it's so beautiful good job
Kondisi mobil sangat terawat
Excellent job. You have all the tools
Mazda's are pretty beautiful, been enjoying them for almost ten years now and not looking back 👌
Красавчики!!!
😮😮😮😮😮🐨🇦🇺🦘🎅🏼🎅🏼
Looks awesome 👌 👏 👍
底盤不用洗的嗎
fixed up running itd be 27000 to 90000 good luck
Nice. It's amazing how much of a difference a good hoover and water can make before you even start the decontaminating, washing, polishing and detailing. pro job guys
サバンナと７ですか今なら高くうれるよ
At the side I think there is a mk3 supra parked?
Y'all cats are detail artist that car was filthy you guys turned it into a showroom piece wish I had a car in that condition I bring it to you all the way from Detroit peace
Fantastic car, it was just way to expensive in my country, you could buy a BMW 7 series V8 for it. For the Dutchmen in 1992 : 155000 Gulden = ~90000 US$ 😲
Five hundred dollars
I noticed the Gen1 RX-7 in that garage too. What's up with that? This FD is beautiful! Awesome detail guys!
Awesome work guys! RIP mice. They stayed warm but starved to death.  I didn't know you can spray water and soap over the engine bay like that.
You should LS swap it
My car is one TOYOTA COROLLA LE 2004 WITH 40.000 miles, new driver.
Bro didn’t even disconnect the battery or take it out when he was cleaning out the engine with pressurized water.
Wow, amazing💪💪💪
🔥🔥🔥🔥
We just going act like that brisket wasn't dry as hell... 7:14
i wonder if the rx7 is 23 yrs old and not use in 23 yrs... so why keeping the tire? it must be replace just for the road safety...
I’m really into the JDM style cars and I love that this car is kind of a long those lines
I can’t believe how someone can have this car for two decades and not know what they have 😮🤯👀
Nice job!
Superb work gentleman 👌🏻
You might have done something with the rusty brake discs.
in only 8k km looking like shit !! negletec humans..pigs..hogs..shame !!! the cats is more clean like human species !! truly savage to lose that car in so condition !! no way!!
I like everything about this car like I'm in love I will like to have one of my own one day
55k?? Some one with too much money will probably pay 100k
you missed to put back the rear left emblem
Well done.   Man I miss detailing.    What a great job
I needed that car, it is the car of my dreams and you have left it incredible
gab es vor 23 jahren USB Anschlüsse in Autos ?🤔Egal, gute Arbeit..
The original owner failed so hard by not having it detailed and selling it for thousands more, this is a real deal gem with under 9k miles
Found my 94 FD R1 with 58k original in better condition then this but still in the back corner of a rich guys garage covered in dust. Did a full overhaul and it became an icon in my car community
My favorate car in 1980....ideal car for traffic... small size
amazing work guys <3
I knew those were ohio plates , and then saw the Spitzer dodge logo.. pretty cool old flibber still had this.!!
I’m worried 😧 if there are more mice 🐁 inside the dashboard.
are we just ignoring the other car next to it
You guys selling the car
For free?! Legends.
The work you did was worth more than the cars worth.
Is nobody going to talk about the blue RX7 next to it??
Awesome video. I like that you don’t spend too long recording each job. I didn’t fast forward this video at all, which is what I do I most of these detail videos. I came here from your collab with MAD 👍
Great Resurrection
Qué bonita quedó la casita de micky mouse
Parabéns pelo excelente trabalho.
I JUST WANT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!🧼🧼🙀👍👍👍
隣のギャランラムダの方が気になり過ぎる
Yes it’s an r1 that’s a 40k plus car all day
The first gen on the right side is worth some money too I’m am a rotary guy that’s a 30k plus 3rd gen the first gen if it’s clean and low mileage it’s in the upper teens just so you understand the black rx7 is known as a 93 3rd gen or an FD the turquoise colored one is a first gen known as an FB it’s an 84 or an 85 and one last thing that car is an r1 if I’m not mistaken
When he put the first coat of soap underneath the car. My dumbass thought he would then proceed with a small brush to wash it.
Nice work u guys do great detailing carry on
Beautiful car!  How much does a detailing job like this one go for?  $1000?  And, I wish I could find some close to me that could do as good of a job.
🤌
Nicely done!👍
Dude how did you get the mouse smell out? Was it all in the extractor? I know we don’t have smell-a-vision but that many dead mice it had to smell bad.
What is the floor for your studio??
You guys did an amazing job
Gotta be worth 15-22k
すげーぇ！
16:48 12/17/22 Several wasted hours on the detailing procedures. Would love to offer advice.
What about the  z car next to it in the garage?
Why did companies stop making the spares look better then the actual wheel😂
I’ve watched this video like 40 times now. That is such a perfect example literally refresh the motor, apex seals, apex seals, apex seals, and leave it bone stock. That’s something we’ll be seeing dominate Barrett-Jackson one day.
謝謝您，用心拍影片，與我們分享你的生活👍👍👍
we want to see how car start not seeing cleaning car. It do not worth much as its new and not Mustang 1967.
What y’all use to clean interior (seats) ?
Saw there channel on tiktok
I'm Irma,  beautiful car!! Love it..😁👍
I can't believe it
Drooling.  I’d say about 60-70k.
Quedo super veyo
Great job
Top video. It's nice to see tradesmen getting in there and doing the job top to bottom. Anyone can get the job done.
I could not get why you washed the old tyres which are not OK to use after many years.
I have a 1995 Chevrolet Blazer LT 22K miles. I wish you were closer. I’d love to see you perform your miracles on it.
Being in a garage saved this car. Sunlight and weather would have killed this car. But leaving a car sit because you’re scared is a disservice to the true nature of this car.
tyre not flat  ??????????????    that old tyre can still use ????????????
speaking of dealership badge, took in one of my cars to dealer for oil change - picked up the car and the next day as I was putting something in the trunk I noticed they stuck a dealership badge on the back which wasn't there before - CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT, WHO THE HELL gave them the right to do that I was so pissed.  Of course the service manager and sales manager didn't think it was such I big deal
problem is going to come when you start putting some miles on it, the seals are all shot and when you start heating them up and cooling them - everytrhing is going to leak, and will have issues with the fuel system, all kinds of stuff.  Sure if will likley run just fine for few miles, but anybody who buys it will be into it for thousands of dollars in repairs.  TO me its not worth much, higher mileage car driven and maintaned will always be worth more than car sitting for 15 years never started in my opinion.  Cool car, just not worth very much
Work of art!
BROTHER WHY CANT I FIND ONE LIKE THIS …. 😢
BRAVO MONSIUER BONNE TRAVAILS  BRAVO MON FRERE. ..ALGERIA
40k minimum and I may be low too!  Always wanted one when I was younger!
Would have liked to see the owners reaction. Nice job though.
Good job the car look perfect again
amazing work guys i really love the way you guys clean cars
状態がよすぎる
You guys are insanely modest
That's a dream car right there  Wish I had enough budget to buy one 😩 If I could find an abandoned one it may work out for me too I am sooo fkin obsessed with rx7
可惜了这么好的车库了…！
OMG...
Que carro lindo mano 👌❤
Cheers to double-bubble roofs 🍻
That car if you sell it you can get $60,000 bucks for it
My ws6 needs a throughout detail. Otr trucker from IL
Stutututu missing
Is that a yellow spare tire
Wow 😱 what a jackpot
in 11:00 I think it's better to close the generator with a package
I like the machines You use
Gawd damn that car looks bad ass. Timeless piece of speed racer!
I need this treatment done to my car 🥲
Hope they did a full service on it, oil change etc
bitches be cravin' dat wankle rotary engine
Way to many ads!
Cigarette lighter replaced by USB port.
I live near a Spitzer dealership. So now.... dang I wish I had found that car. Great work. Enjoyed video
23 anos abandonado e esta mais limpo que meu carro a 1 semana sem lavar
its a basically a new car nice find.. what did you guys pay for it?
bruh imagine finding this. what a luck
Superb job.  When I saw the Spitzer name, I knew where this was going to be from.   I had a '94 in white with black leather interior.  This is definitely an unusual one:  it's an R-1 with suede seats, and black exterior.  There were a lot FDs in SoCal where I live, and I've only seen a couple in black, and that was at SevenStock at Mazda's Hq in Irvine, CA.  The car looks fantastic, due to your hard work and expertise.  The hard part would bring the car back mechanically.  The don't like to be left sitting, but I'm sure hoping that it wasn't too badly deteriorated inside the motor.
Considering low mileage, original condition plus paperwork from dealership since day of purchase and the immaculate job you guys done, I’d say worth Atleast 70k plus
Semoga kita akan menjadi pemenang
Mint
I don't know if I'll buy the "owner drove it so fast he parked it and there it sat for 25 year" story
excellent work.
You have to run full synthetic 2 stroke motor oil with the gas at 100 to 1 or you will have a very short engine life.
Música de fundo sensacional! Amo smoothjazz! E aliada a beleza desse carro, tem tudo a ver!
Not sell it............. Love it :)
Who came to watch this video after watching it on TikTok. 🙋🏽‍♂️I know I Did
uma hora dessa esse carro deve ta empoeirado e encostado de novo
Love that RX7 nice work😮😮
BEAUTIFUL.great attention to detail, only 1 complaint... the brake rotors.  Either replace or have them turned, I dont know if that falls in the wheelhouse of detail but other than that, amazing great job
Should gotten ahold of Rob Dahm.
Worth Good Money! Amazing Great  Cars!!
Pittsburgh?
Man I wish the rx7 was still being made the way the Miata is… where stylistically it remains almost the same year after year but still receives tech updates and new drivetrains
2 dollas and a bag of chips
what about the classic rx7 beside that what happened to it?
100k$
Igual estuvo guardado, peor sería si hubiera estado 23 años al aire libre
Gente muy cochina el dueño original , se me hace que nunca lo habían lavado
you need to chance the tires! they are after so many years😅😂
No way those tires dont have flat spots...Also how do they still have air?
Replace those tires
Hola buenos dias amigos,de verdad hicieron una maravilla con este vehiculo,esa limpieza fue exepcional realmente a fondo sin dejar nada con polvo,ese RX7 quedo realmente hermoso,tal y como debe lucir un vehiculo muchas felicidades amigos,reciban un afectuoso saludo desde el puerto de veracruz 🦐🦈🦀🌴✌️🏖️
What about the tires. Not to old ? I would have list new tires on it.
Dude probably used it in a crime and got worried someone would recognize it lol
the tires held up after 23 years?
Türkiye''den selamlar çok güzel !!
A real JDM legend, the owner is extremely lucky to find this showroom condition car!
100k car right there!
Great job!
When you love what you do & you are not a watch watcher, what you can achieve is immense plus money is just a biproduct or your hard work.
How much you guy wanna sale the car for cause I wanna buy for my son.. I live in California
PS empty out your gas tank refresh it with new gas in my stink
Make sure you change All of braking system after 3 turns into water
Rx7 jdm beauty 😍.
Wow this is pretty amazing car.💓
A 27 year old can’t possibly fathom what this car is.
The car goes 140mph, OH MY GOD, I'm gonna park it in my garage for the rest of my life ;-;
Amazing transformation ❤❤
Pekerjan yang melelehkan dengan hasil yang memuaskan kawan ,bagus sekali 👍👍👍🇮🇩🇮🇩
👀👏👏👏👏👏👍👍
That detailing bay is nice.
MY DREAMMM CARRRR
After AE86 beat this car they just put it in garage
Love the attention to the tiniest detail on this, the removal of seats, console and rear wing are extremely important to get it done right!  If you were closer I'd have you do my daily driver
15:57 Made you look.
там резину менять надо ) 23 год прошло ) а они её намывают)!
Replace the tires! It s dangerous to drive a car with 20 years+ old tires!
Awesome car! Awesome video!!!!!!
@AMMO-NYC Show Him How It's Done!
Why u dont open All chair Its to risk dirty bottom floor of car
Fake
what's the story on finding this car?
Mice in the dash
Yep had a 93 fd3 RX7 black with two-tone red and black interior and 26,000 original miles drove it around for a year and then resold it. That rotary engine pulled hard the higher the RPM the harder it pulled.
I kinda,want this car. Wish I could afford to buy it.
The car only had 8,800 miles. The car ‘was’ completely original. You guys touched everything. Just awful! It’s Not original anymore. Just brutal!
Imagine how good it would look doing a burnout... or... just moving?
Great car u must have good drainage for all the water on floor.does it ever get moldy in there with that nice flooring?? Just curious 😉
Bu kadar guzel ve efsane araclari neden atil ve bakimsiz durumda tutarlar. Yaptiginiz buyuk ve mukemmel  bir iş.
I live in Powell Ohio and have a   1987 Porsche 924S with 13,000  actual miles. After viewing this video I was amazed at the outcome! How do I contact you?
Wow... Just......... Wow
why the emblem is not mazda? what type of FD this is? someone pls explain
круто
People believing this shit is hilarious to me.
Lol how do you go out and drive it hard on the freeway and then get scared of it so much that you park it and never touch it again for over 2 decades
Wondering if you kept the 23 + years old tires? Are they still road worthy?
这字幕对于中国人来说也太友好了
Que trabalho FANTASTICO!!! Parabéns por isso e lamento ver uma lenda japonesa como essa, abandonada e literalmente entregue aos ratos, mas a dedicação e o amor ao que fazem, salvaram esse mito da MAZDA.
Thing is a gem
What is the white spray you are using on everything?
Amazing
Japanese steel comes from Australia And we have the best steel in the world
I will gladly take care of the other Rx7 inside the garage..!!!
At least 45k value
Great job boys. Hard to believe this is a 30 year old car!
I hope that the future new owner of this car is not a tuner or a racer, because it would cause a "sacrilege" with the modifications to the few factory copies that remain in the world.
Most calming and downright entertaining videos on YouTube

"Barn find" .. Mazda. Turned off at 0:34
One minute silence for mice
Best iteration of the RX7, if it's a turbo.
So sick 🔥
These detailing videos are so satisfying but all I’m thinking about while watching is - where does all that water go?  Does the sheet rock on the walls mildew?  If I broke out my power washer INSIDE MY GARAGE it would cause uncountable problems.  Sure there’s probably a floor drain - but still…. Soap would be flying 20 feet in all directions
Wow what a find!
kill  the auto tune..robotic voice sounds dreadful..imo
You're detailing a car that never really got  dirty. I didn't see any vehicles with 200000 miles of lived in built up dirt
has 99's tags with tires that launched in 07.
Used to own a 95 RX-7, in red. It was a rocket. Had to get rid of it just short of 100k miles- blown engine and radiator. The rotary engine is very finicky, I'd be concerned with the apex seals and corrosion from the fluids sitting there for years. And as others have said, replace the tires! Old tires are allegedly what caused the deaths of Paul Walker and Roger Rodas.
I often see signs indicate "DO NOT SPRAY" in the engine chamber ,so it is okey to wash it with gentler water?
Uh, maybe someone has mentioned this - the tyres are 23 years old. Don't you think it needs new tyres?
Belissimo trabalho...parabéns
I would say it’s worth 30,000 upwards
My oh my! 😊😊
Saludos desde LA LIMA CORTÉS HONDURAS C.A
Nice job, the only thing id say is that I don't think its a good idea to wash seats like that which have electrical occupancy sensors, as moisture or water can damage them.  It might clean up and be okay initially, but if water or condensation gets down it between the sensor its fkd.  I've had to replace some and they ain't cheap and its a pain in the ass to replace them in some vehicles.
After 23y you change the tires not wash them
I’ll buy it how much put a price
Bjr. J'ai une BMW 525d année2004 .pouvez me la Rénover. Merci d'avance.
The owner got scared of it and parked it in his garage for 30 years? C'mon. That's not believable. What's the real story?
Ese carro es. Un unicornio
$100K car... w 8800 miles.
Complimenti così si lavora,peccato per la macchina
Doskonała robota
Wow! Amazing work!!
Mouse feces and urine can be toxic and contain many pathogens and viruses. Use steam. Also why are you using such a tiny detailing brush for large surface areas?
If I could find someone to detail my life with this much effort and care, my life would be ideal. This car looks so good after that work omg!!!!
いいなぁ欲しい😃
This is the one car that truly deserves this kind of bath and detailed treatment, I love this!!!
Almost can’t even put a number on that thing
85k at auction.  Wait a couple of years and you can get a classic car premium and push 110k
The crap I find out there never looks nice, and some do not resemble an auto at all....
That my dream car I would love to have that car
「経年劣化」が全く感じられない(;^ω^) 車庫に入れてたからって、ここまで綺麗な状態ってあり得るの？？？
Personally id buy the car for 15k
Insane job..
The worst thing that happened to that care was getting bought by that guy. He meant to say HE scared himself.
To bad the car had mice in it, for years and years. No matter how much you clean it, you will never get all the bacteria out of it. The mice have peed and pooped everywhere in that car most likely. Mice carry pestilence and disease, like the literal plague. This is a total loss vehicle as far as most would be concerned. Good for mechanical drivetrain parts only. Nothing on the inside.  You are doing a deep clean for sure, but you would have to replace all the fibrous surfaces (carpet, felt, foam padding etc) with new, and sterilize all the hard surfaces (metal and plastic) including inside all ventilation system ducts (Impossible). That means all new carpet, ceiling, all seats and armrests, and soft touch foam items like door panels, arm rests etc. in the entire car, plus hood fire retardant padding.  Just not worth it, but yall did it anyway lol.  I hope whoever gets this car does not get sick, and I hope yall don't sick from cleaning it. Mice inside the cabin of a vehicle = totalled. Biohazard level 4.
I was 22 when that tag ran out.
This is an amazing job. Golf clap! Just wish we had the owners reaction in here too🙌🏽
It was broken wasn't it?
Scared of it? LMAOOOO
didn't see but did you drain and replace all the fluids? check tank for rust? seems like all fluids would need changed after 23 yrs of sitting.
Black bomb
Seeing as how those tires are over 20 years old, I think I'd get new ones.
how does the metal parts of the car not rust when you clean it?
Bunuda okuyomusun
Thumbs up for the mice, They treated their home with respect. In that regard they seem better behaved then some humans.
I have a 2008 Shelby GT500 I’ve daily driven if anyone wants to give it some love haha
kamikoto is not made in Japan. Don't be fooled.
You guys do good work! I wouldn’t change a thing about your guys technique!
Why has no one mentioned the apex seals in the rotors going bad from siting for so long, I would def be careful with starting that motor. Beautiful detail though.
Per me è una falsa. Passata la lancia sulla carrozzeria la macchina era lucida. Le sporcano loro e poi le lavano. Possibile che una macchina non lavata per 20 anni alla prima passata di lancia e come nuova. Guardate i cerchi è tutto un dire sulla falsità del video.
Onlg in ohio
Being all original 100 to 200 thousand
Ummmmmmmmmmm, you put new tires on it, right??????? Wouldn't want to do 140 on tires that old..
Bravoooo!!! :-)
Yo recomiendo cambiar los cauchos son tantos años en un solo punto de deforman y producen vibración.
Those cars are fast really fast,I believe the first fast and furious had a red one that Dom was driving in the movie
So how old were those tires ?
Desde España gracias por mostrar tu arte y un saludo y muy buen trabajo
$175000
I don't know much about cars, but WOW!
I've got some questions detailer to detailer
my car looks not cleaner
I'm from Chile and i just found this channel and it's amazing what you do👏🏽 i'm studying about detailing and this channel help me to see in the reality how you do the things, Good video and i want to learn more about restoration and detailing, Thanks you so much💪🏽❤️
Japanese steel is the best? lmfao They are best fabricating paper works, that's all! People forget so easily about the Japanese lies!
Dude!! That engine bay is clean af
Is he looking to sale it
FFS...can you cram anymore ads into this? Probably not. Bye.
Any word on what his plans are for the car now?
凄いなぁ～✨
great job on a fantastic car!
What did you guys do with the fb next to it??
Do you know if it's for sale?
nice car
oh！😲 mazda RX- 7  FD and  SA 22 ！
Listen i don’t know shit about cars, I’m literally only here for the cleaning (I put this on in the background while I clean my apartment every weekend), but this car is cool as fuck

Break disk so red
This beauty is well over $100k right now. I'd love to have her sitting in my garage and cruising with her on a nice sunny southern california day
Driven ?
Turns out nothing bad is happening in ohio
Question with you spraying in the engine does that damage anything?
Was going to watch but saw a dead mouse so I’m out 😂
Goofy ahh mice
My low estimate would be $58,000, but I’m thinking more like $80,000 when it goes to auction
Ptuce between 23 and 36k
It would easily go for $50,000 and maybe $70,000 if you find the right buyer
Hola WD, como siempre de excelente tu trabajo, por eso no me sorprende el estado en que dejas los vehículos 😄😄 TRABAJO PERFECTO 👌
So is it for sale ???
Amazing only yhay engine is going to need to be disassembled and resealed, rotaries are grate engines but they do not like being left alone for 2 decades.   Fuel system and engine refresh are going to be a must, probably cost you 8k all up but the car would be worth 50-60k
a lost treasure 😱
A little bit of history; The most popular car with a Mazda rotary engine that sent the rest of the models to the history dump. In the period from 1978 to 2002, 3 generations were released. There were variations of the layout: front mid-engine and rear-wheel drive. The year 1991 became an epoch-making one of its kind, as a version of the car with the 13B-REW engine was released, which was the first serial twin-turbo unit supplied from Japan to other countries.
me personally I'd check my brake and fuel lines, do literally every single fluid flush in that vehicle, replaces all 4 rotors or just cut them, caliper & pads inspection just to be sure, replace the tires, everything that needs lube in order to move freely inspect them. that's just me tho
A new car frozen in time, awesome job detailing!
Want to sell that holster that was in the glove box?
I would love to see owners reaction to this transformation!
Do u still have it if u do how much u whant for it
Hey guys you look like you did a great job cleaning that car but you got to make sure you clean the venting systems because those rat droppings turn to dust and that's how the hantavirus is created
Be nice to see if the writing on the screen wasn't covering the video
I hope your not keeping those 22 year old tires.  They have to be dry rotted.  Unsafe.
Should of ceramic coated it. Still great job👏
8.000 miles and he left it parked cause " he was afraid of the car.."  what the actual fck? 👶
So cool love it
Such a beautiful car, that's my all time dream car right there, that's a whole dream to find one in a garage like that and I'm so jealous, good job though, looks absolutely amazing. Eventually I'll have enough money to buy one but that will take some time haha, nice video tho. Definitely nice to watch after a rough day yesterday.
One thing that sucks about this car is were the air filter is
Amazing car that you guys found and brought it back to life. The final result was amazing, brand new looking.   This video deserves more views. 💥💥
First time i see fake video on your chanel
23 years setting on those tyres they should be changed before it’s ready to go
Hope the owner did not drive around with 23 year old tires! Not safe!
I'll hit you with the Bruce Almighty's, b-e-a-utiful.  It looks like a dream.  I'm no longer in New York, but down here in Charlotte, NC without a vehicle.  Good Lord would I love to make that my everyday vehicle.
it is a rare barn find..  most RX 7s you find are in salvage yards...
You didn't find it in a barn doood,,,, worst car ever!!!,,,known for the rear end to slide out all the time 👎🏾
Got scared after driving 140, and never drove it again? Just drive normal then, 🤷
What's the instrumental song at the end ?
太假了
Nice job with the car.  Henrik from Sweden
hussain
Depends on the dealership name and style. I liked mine. A 24k 1987 Ply.outh Gran Fury with AC and cruise control. That's top of the line for Plymouth. Torrado Plymouth San Antonio Texas. It fell off though
Ini mah motor baru. Masak bawahnya g ad yg kropos. Kan lucu😁
That' RX7 lit🔥
What a load of utter bullshit lol
Fuck yall
what about the other light blue RX7?
The Mazda you cleaned first what’s the real name of the car?
Has this car been sold  yet
Y'all earn every one of those over 400,000 subscribers.
Great job
Fucking LOVE that this ol’ homie has both of those absolute dimes of machines. Stinks to have seen it so dusty, but the retribution was real on this one.  He’ll fetch a pretty penny if he sells it, but I hope he doesn’t. (To him, metaphorically) take your friends or family to car shows in it. Cruise in that bitch going WAY under what it should, just for the fun of it. He bought it new, and doesn’t need to hand it to some kid who’s going to destroy it. Probably an unpopular opinion, but the stories and memories this car can create are worth far more than any material value it’s going to catch.
Dreams, man.
25K+, great job on the 100 point detail and beyond 👏🏾
Is this a pretty current video? This is very similar to the FD Tommy Farrell, or TommyFYeah had, similar low mileage, pristine condition etc.. But he did mod his and sale it and his was around a year ago if I'm not mistaken. Either way, awesome example of the car.
always wanted a fd rx7 but settled with a nissan 240sx coupe and hatch hahah the old school jdm cars are the BEST
Daaaaamn. That’s clean  🔥🔥🔥
What year was this car?
Hey Guys AMAZING!!!!!!! Please tell me thats not your garage at your house......your setup is amazing and so so beautiful, and the amount of room you have to work makes me drool, I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU SAID THAT YOU DO THIS WORK FOR FREE?!??!!!!FREE???FREE!!!!!! OMMMMGGGG!!!!! YOU GUYS ARE GREAT EXAMPLES OF GREAT HUMAN BEINGS!!!!!!! im not too far from you but am in canada just south of toronto, i think like 6 hour drive from you guys, amazing stuff guys, love watching and learning from yall, TOTAL RESPECT 🙏 !!!
1,000 thumbs up you guys do amazing work but I'm sure you already knew that I'm also in Northeast Ohio Akron to be exact I'll see if I can find one
Thanks for the great watch while I’m on the toilet👍🏼
No more than $25,000
great work guys
You need to focus more on the paint… love your attention to detail but I’d love to see your process on the paint especially something like this one.
When you find a 23 old car in the garage washing is the last thing I would do.  First Check the technical parts, changing motor oil, start Engine etc
Good job
🤝Пушка тачка👍
Could of been cool to see the owners reaction at the end of the video ! None the less very satisfying video to watch 😀
Easy 6 figures I think at auction
Beat NFS: Underground using this car.
Just enjoyed watching your hard work. It encouraging me to clean my Ford Fusion 2011.  However, I’m not very good with a screwdriver to take a part and put back! Haha!  Maybe if I was younger, I’m 79 years old.  The thought was there.  Continue with what you do. Your kindness is great.
First rule of keeping a black car clean? Don't buy a black car.  I know, a Dad joke.  Nice detail.  Fun to watch.
Wait until you turn the AC on and get blasted with a mouse poop scatter shot
with the miles and condition this car stock would be worth just north of 30 grand
You guys really do an awesome job.
amaziiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing Job bro !!
was für Anfänger !!  so reinigt man kein Auto...  Kennzeichen verdeckt ! Gesichter verdeckt....🤔 und was ist mit Unterboden-Wäsche ?
Ya do all this for FREE?? Wow that’s amazing im sure the owner tipped you really good i hope. You brung that bad boy back to life so awesome and satisfying to watch…♥️🙏🏽
Holy 50 shades of friggn Blue Balls. Take it to MECA
Unreal detail, one of your best so far
Hope you are going to do the mk1 RX7 that was sitting next to it in the garage as well.
wow GREAT job cleaning up this NICe car!
Awesome job
11:00 ROTARY ENGINE LEGEND! OF MAZDA!
Oh man such a great find and a beautiful car and yall did an amazing job on getting it all cleaned up and restored once this car is back in full working order it is probably worth a pretty penny and I want it I would love to have this beauty and thanks for sharing I really enjoyed the video alot again great job guys
Great Detailing Video!!
24:00 its obvious you guys you are really figuring this shit out as you go. some parts were really hard to watch. who funded your little youtube/detail shop dream?
jesus man replace the damn tires, theyre no good
wow great job btw
What’s the whole story on this car how did you find it and did you just help the original owner clean and sell it???
what about the FB on the other side of it?
Actually it might be too fast for me
Zoom Zoom my automotive technology teacher Davis, and my father who works with taxicabs, both love Mazda car’s.
❤picture perfect rx7 is it forced induction? Great job detailing. I would pay 3 million dollars just my guess?
Sell it to Tommyfyeah
❤️🇧🇷
Didn't Stuart Little drive a red mg
Lad 3 million other people said “😮” when they seen the short

Keep it stock
I like this model RX7.
Did you sell it yet?
AWESOME!!
You found my dream car 😢
Outstanding. Mid 90s japanese sporty cars are my favorite. Eclipse GSX, RX7 and Supra.
story don't add up scared? like sell the car give it to family like who just says I got scared so I parked my car..
the only think tha i dont like tha the car is not mine the car value  around 30,000 mabe more
how tf can u buy a car that goes fast and then actually go fast then get scared and not ever drive it. what a pansy
Tires should be changed, 23 years is too old for safety driving.
I see han fast furious on back car.😅 aghh sorry..maybe on tokyo drift movie.
Hi, i’m from Belgium. İf the owner want sell this car, i’m intrested in this juwlery car . Pm me if is ok 👍🏻 ok
Super job! Totally jealous of that shop/garage.
The blonde girls that were driving these things around 2000...   oh yea.
I had to laugh when he said it scared him  ,so he parked it .       Why did he drive it 140 MPH ?     Does he think it will run that fast again,   ( on its own .)          Sorry but the way some people think  is crazy .                      😄
Love rx7 but this is a gem!!  Thuis car can fetch 50k for the right buyer
Maaan! I remember those cars on the lot back in the 90's. You guys did an awesome job!! Beautful! Did the owner ever sell the car or keep it? Probably worth about $37000 in todays market
this guy just got 1 in a million luck to find this fd which is still new in millage.
Tried to KBB it, and KBB broke 😂 said value was unavailable
How much wood you charge for a clean like this ? Great job
Had two RX-7's in my life,  Most fun to drive cars by a wide margin.  Watching this video brought me back decades.  Thank you!
Hi, I was wondering about cleaning engine bays, I thought you had to cover some stuff like the alternator, is that not something I need to worry about ?
And the most important thing is you said in the end that's free wow
Restauración o limpieza 🤔🤔🤔
BARN FIND??? Hahaha
I need you to wash my car like that.
beautiful
Porque no desarmaron el carro totalmente quitando alfombra y tapizados puertas Debajo de la alfombra puede haber más excrementos de ratón
Spoiler alert! Finished product sitting behind you in sponsor shoutout.
kamikoto is a scam company, guarantee you their 'steel' does not come from a forge in japan. They are owned by a chinese company that runs many scam companies such as the '1 square foot piece of land in scotland for sale' scam where you don't actually own any land in scotland at all after purchasing it. Other than a fake piece of paper they print for you saying you do, but you really don't, as confirmed by scotlands government on this scam.
$50
To get stains out the outside of the car
What spray do u use to get the dirt of the car
I love the video, the car and your work. The chemical and labour cost spent on the 20+year old tyres was unnecessary; if I was the owner I'd get a new set whilst everything was off! Lucky person to own this car and the FC RX7!
If the 140 story holds true..
Y’all should make it sound nicer I suggest put in the front green rims with green on the outside and make it fade into black
So its been garaged and neglected... its not a barn find is it.
From my side I almost cannot believe this RX7 was untouched for so many years. The fact that most of the dirt came of that easily after the first use of the highpressure waterspray looks almost too easy. When I am washing my car after a few weeks with a professional waterspray I have to work harder than in this case…
Dude amazing job but pls next time clean the disc brakes as well!
I would kept this car definitely
My neck would be crack seeing this beautiful and clean  RX-7 all stock.. sheess
Those tires are too old. Probably not safe to drive on.
You need to unscrew that glove compartment box and clean behind there too man. Guarantee it’s disgusting back there
there's a another car in beside it is there any video coming on it
Bro the old school rx7 ❤. Awsome work ☝️
My friend has one just like this one. 1993 RX7 TWIN TURBO... He only had it on the road for. About 1 year. He had told me that the check engine light came on for a O2 sensor and he put it in the garage and never drove it again. I said what a shame to let such an awesome car go to waste. I asked why don't you fix it man this car is awesome he said oh I'll get around to it like it was no big deal. That made me disappointed because we are both mechanics. He brought this car when he was about 18 years old. And that was back in 1995 you brought it used from a dealership. We have been friends since childhood and I can't understand how he can just let a car sit for so long because I would have been the one out there taking it to the track and  running balls out of it. Lol I do commend them for having that  much discipline and not dogging the car out but you buy a car like that when you're that young to I have as much fun with it and it's possible. He still has it and is still sitting in his fathers garage I hope to live long enough to see you and put it back on the road. But as a  few years ago he went out and brought a 2010 Dodge viper it's funny he took the viper out to the track and get one pass with it and he broke the axle and that axle cost him 1500.00 dollar's. I don't know why he does some of the things he does but it wouldn't be nice to see the RX7 back on the road again.
No 2
This could be worth like $150,000.
Amazing  work your whole team is amazing
awesome....
Hoaaaxxxx
Wow this is awesome !  I’m in Michigan and just found and purchased a lower Mile 97 s14 that was all covered in green algae and has been sitting for some time ! I would’ve loved to hit you up about detailing it. Would’ve been a perfect candidate for this channel 💙 Wish i knew if you earlier just found you today hahah. Anyway I’m subscribed now forsure !  Check my channel out for videos on it !
How much?
Junk
I get heated honestly when big time people find cars like this because you know they’re going to gouge it and everyday people then cant afford it or get the opportunity for a barn find like this
All I will say is "WOW!!" :)) What a beauty!
FYI your sponsor Kamikoto Knifes are a Scam, as are their other partner companies like Established Titles. Glad you guys are getting paid but don't let your viewers get scammed pls do your due diligence.  Kamikoto Knives use 420J2 steel, that's one of the cheapest on the market and used in those supermarket $10 knives that look slightly better than the generic bottom ones.
You guys get a super great job
And I hope you guys drain the gas before you started the vehicle to put fresh gas in the car
Tires should not be any good reason sitting in one area for so long the tires dry rot
I hope you replacing tires
راحه نفسيه المقطع شكراا❤
I have a 2010 Chevy HHR that is screaming for help.  I am in Northeast Ohio and could certainly use some expert help in getting this poor girl cleaned up.  Please shoot me a message back on here or I don't know if I'd get in trouble for handing out my email address....
100k in this hyperinflation economy
😞
You need to look up details on kamikoto knives.  They are owned by the same company that owns established titles.  It is a Chinese company and they are scamming people.  Those knives are not what they claim
Do you guys do crime scene cleanup side jobs?? I've got some work coming up for you? I've gotta get rid of an annoyance.
I know what the man means about being scared of the car. I drove a friends ex back in the day, he needed my truck for a day so we swapped cars. His car was so freaking fast. I was something of a speed girl. My dad always called me Marietta And retro and also said that I had my foot in the carburetor.   Beautiful little car, though.
40k easy 😢😢
Was so confused at first, seeing the Spitzer on the back of the car, then found out that’s why you’re in Ohio
I really love this car I am are love of cars how much does it cost am in cameroon
Well done great job
A damn cherry... bet it would go for over 85k on BaT
Question: how come the tire aren’t punctured after 23 years? Air pressure looks perfect in all tires. 🤣
Was this car found somewhere in the western Pennsylvania region? There is an Acura dealer in my town Spitzer Acura that used to put the same exact dealer logo on the back  of the cars they sold. It looks identical to the logos they used in the 90’s and they have been around for a long long time. Not sure if they ever had a Mazda store though.
I am surprised you guys didn't take the tyres off the wheels when cleaning them. tyres would have to be replaced as the rubber compound would have degenerated substantiallyafter 23 years. It would have been dangerous to drive on those tyres.
I hope you put new tires on it. Those are dangerous after 22 years.
a beautiful job guys but this not restoration, a clean and polish
Perfect 😊
you CLEARLY see this fake, horrible job at making look like it was dirty in the interrior
🔥🔥🔥
So satisfying, great job
Habréis cambiado los neumáticos ( tyres)
Great job guys. The car looks beautiful !!! 👍🏻😍
man that is my dream car... wish i could have met that old man, itd be mine! muahhahahahaha! 8800 miles. unreal. i was 14yrs old when this model came out. i called it the baby viper. 300z, 3000gt, rx7 and the legendary supra... man those were good times
Great job but After 23y, you must, at least, change all filters, brake fluid, cooling fluid, engine & gearbox oil, tyres...👍
In india it'll be ₹ 20 lakh...so I'm guessing it'll be 30000$
Is anyone else beginning to doubt all these BARN FINDS videos?   This one may not be fake, but 'I'll beef hooked' if more than 50% of them are real. They all look perfectly petina'd.  How hard can it be to make a car look like it's been sitting for years? Just empty a vacuum cleaner canister all over it, spray it with water, drive it through a dry dusty path, then park it and throw some dry leaves on it and pretend it smells inside.
Sigh... I want this car
As JDM lover it was so satisfy to watch this video!
Vin Diesel on his way to get this Rx7 😀
Edun pisan mobilnya mamang😀
Kamikoto belong to a scammer company, and is very fishy product

I have a #ChevyCruz2011 #manualtransmission with #225Kmilesplus  and runs excellent dude. Riding on the left lane on #NewJersey Interstate roads. It boils down to excellent #mechanic.
Can't believe this guy parked it for that long.  Its like having a racehorse and keeping it in the trailer for 20 some years.  Gotta let it out at least once in a while there guy.
Absolutely unreal! You give me hope that one day my 2014 Scion FR-S can still look good as new 🙏
That is the stockest, friendliest, purest and most family-car-y 2 seater non family car
Wow
por favor traducilo al español
took my dinner while watching, I was not ready for those dead mice. 🤢
Man these are legal thiefs
Probably 45k or 55k Tell them I will give them 10k cash
No way that’s my dream car I’ve always wanted an rx7! Ever since I was a little kid I loved that car it’s honestly suck an outstanding car I love it so much and I love that you have it🎉
Weird seeing Japanese barnyard finds. Not that these are revered to a certain degree but I just assumed that these cars are modified and driven to death on the road instead. Not stored away like some classic car.
Change out the rotors then 💯 but it is still clean and beautiful ride🤙🏾💯
Nice
Tires definitely need to be changed because of aging and sitting flat spot
Brilliant wprk
yall should check if theres any rust or spiders
I have a 1991 red RX-7 (2nd gen) and it’s in excellent condition. 130k original miles. Lives in the garage. Headlights pop up. Sunroof opens and closes. I had to have the electrical redone because a former neighbor connected a new battery the wrong way. Planning on rebuilding the engine soon. I owned 2 Rx-7s at one point: this ‘91 red one and a 1990 white one. So much fun to drive. So many people have no clue what these cars are so they always grab attention. I think my brother has a 3rd gen and a 1st gen. We have a 2nd gen turbo also.   The resale value of RX-7s has shot through the roof over the last couple of years. I get offers up to 20k on my 2nd gen. Not sure what a 3rd gen is at now. My brother does performance engineering on Mazdas so we own several RX-7s. Our cars don’t get sold outside of the family.
What is the spray you guys us EVERYWHERE
27:00 Finished product.  Sometimes I just can't wait.
Zerado!!!!❤
Wow I looks like from a dealer😱😱😱
Awesome car, thank you for restoration, good job!
Beautiful car
既然停放那麼久的時間，輪胎應該也早就過了使用年限了，為什麼還要洗？怎不直接換掉？
Is it for sale?
It is so weird to see me that you do everything upside down! I mean the car and the final "product" looks stunning!!! But, you clean off the wheel, then put back onto a dirty car! :D After that, when you finished with the outside, you started to clean out the interior? Shouldn't be on the other way? :D You hoovering out the carpet, then you take off the middle console, so you have to clean the hoovered carpet once again! You are your own enemy based on time! :D   On the other hand well done! Absolutely beautiful job!!!
The tyre can't be use, after so few decades
Absolutely good nice job
You said to point out things that bother us if we spot em and one small thing does bother me. And that's keeping the original 20+yr old tyres. Tyres aren't meant to last this long and they may be unnecessarily slippery from weathering.   It is theorised that Paul Walker died because the Carrera GT he was driving was on its original 2005 tyres.   Other than that, I love everything about this video, and look forward to watching more content from your channel!
Like new 😆👍
Remove the dash I guarantee there’s more mices and in vents
That car needs to be in a museum. The RX7 was the pinnacle of what rotary engines could deliver on street performance.
Why wash the tyres, they definitely need to be replaced...
How many labor hours?
欲しいですね
幾らぐらいでしょうか🪙🪙🪙🪙🪙🪙🪙🪙
NASTY VW CADDY DEEP CLEANING.: 👉 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghAdNUurYPQ 🔥
Easy $200K+ and in another 20 years it will be priceless
Man's really bought a sports car and said "this power is too dangerous for anyone to have"
Such a satisfying video to watch lol damn bro I wish I could find a person who goes above and beyond for the customer nice detailing my man
he didn't scare of the car...thats a rotary engine...it's worth  a trip to the crusher ( junk)
Honestly as a car technitian, I would have loved to take the engine bay apart to inspect and deep clean some parts as well as oil/grease it up and replace any hardened gaskets. I would also take the exhaust and chasis apart to inspect and clean it. Then work my way into the electricals inside the compartments. Good job cleaning the car tho but yes, an unused car needs to be cleaned engine and system first before carpets, seats, and body.
What about the other one
100 k + in today's market easy!
Man that brisket looks so dry 🤥
Looks brand new
Indonesia sendiri
you guys dint think is abit funny about how come the tyres can stayed there nicely in 23 years
@WD, year? R1 or R2? Touring  or PEP,as an owner of a 95 FD R2 in Silverstone Metallic, I know a few things about these
Best looking car that’s not an NSX or Ferrari. I was a fan of the 300ZX Twin Turbo, but the lines of the FD don’t age. Why wash the tires when they’re probably rotten?
Cant believe someone hid this beauty of a car for years. The beginning condition hurts my soul.
Value truly depends upon the model and maintenance records
What about brakes?!
Were the chrome letters you removed not stock?
Ебланы не додумались бардачок снять😂
Сук владелец мышей в бардачке хоронил!
Price between 50K-70K more if under bonnet panel is replaced with new original
I dislike the wheel and the brake. It needs bigger wheel and bigger brake hahaha Brembo brake will be the best.
It will still need Apex seals😛
I just want to say....Amazing Car...really original....the body in good condition
Cool
Cool 😎
Did you really just power wash diseased rat shit all on to your shop floor?!? lol yikes! Hopefully nobody dies
You left tires on it from the early 90's???? Holy fuck you all are RETARDED!!!
Why the fuck didn't you just remove the glovebox? I guarantee the air filter behind there is trashed and needs cleaned out.
Love the look great job keep doing it
Having owned a FDs, I would estimate this to sell for $108,000-$117,000 if listed in a spring 2023 auction
Yall wanna detail my 1991 Nissan Fairlady Z?
Did the owner flush all of the old gas out?
Most complete detailing I’ve ever watched.  Probably the best I’ve watched.  I am extremely curious what a top to bottom job like this costs?
70k
How did that guy lose so much change in 8800 miles?
So,, what is an FD exactly? Never heard of it. What year is it?   Thanks.
That shmik looking like brand new amazing
AWESOME JOB!! North East Ohio? I'm South West. Subscribed.
I saw 1 water spot in the middle of the hood.   Jk, beautiful job. NAILED IT
I have a 1994 RX7 Montego Blue with tan leather bought it in 2001 from the original owner with 9,928 miles.  It’s all original down to the original tires.  It now has 12,200 miles and I think it’s time to let her go.  If anyone is interested let me know.  You might see it on eBay and bring a trailer soon.
Change the rims
10:30 That obe is more stylized tham most. Personally I would have left it, as I didn't know it was a dealership tag. I thought it was some variant of the car.
A mid RX7 is around $40,000 with 100k miles. This one you're probably doubling it at least.
This is awesome this is one of my dream cars haven’t seen anyone do a full make over of one or even find one
At the end you should do before and after comparisons
Just about the right mileage for the engine to blow........as usual.
Get rid of the cat that resides up against the engine and replace it with a down pipe.  The FD has two. It gets red hot and is detrimental to the engines health.  It's known by the FD owners as the "nuclear reactor"   I've owned 2 FDs in my lifetime, '93 and '95 R2.   Big collector of all things FD.  I have an extra original 1993 Showroom brochure book in mint condition.  Leave a message if you're interested.
Beautiful 😍.  I miss my RX7. I had to trade it in for a minivan when our son was born.
What about the 1st gen Rx? The blue
How much will you sell it for? Luv it!
Yes, I am from Jefferson County, just 52 mi.south of Youngstown, that was a beautiful job you did on the Rx
last time I found bugatti veyron in the barn...before I left it there to be dirty, now I make millions on youtube cleaning the car.....
Want to see it run
Man that car has to still stink like mouse piss and crap with mold after that surface level cleaning. They lived in the dash area and you didn't even put it
Might as well put a better transmission in it you know that’s gonna fail anyway
I’ll take the 1st gen next to it.
He got scared of it and parked in the garage ever since. Dumbest shit anyone can make up
What an absolute gem these days. I love this car. I bet the owner loves to see it back in amazing condition. You guys went above and beyond. The RX-7 is one of the best cars ever made.
I don't believe,how fake was suppose to be ,if this is real I suck my own cock
But the Tires are still good after 22 years ⁉️ I don't think so.
My neighbor has had a s car sitting in his driveway since 2018, I want o see if he wants to part with it but I am scared about all the hidden things. What would you recommend as first steps in starting that conversation and of course pricing? Technically would it be a salvage since its been off the road for over 4 years?
an rx7 with that low mileage would be worth 100k €
Somethings not adding up, at 7:43 ish. the car has no spoiler at 8 minutes it magically back.. HMMMMMMM
Why am I watching a video of someone washing a car.. lmao. I should go wash my truck now
You definitely don’t want to start it. make sure you replace the oil and gas and filters.
Is it just me or power washing the dirt off the car seems completely wrong???
would have liked to see the owners reaction seeing it all cleaned up
Beside the RX7 was that. supra?
It’s worth a story and a museum slot
Whoever owns that a clown bro got scared of the car and never drove it again 💀
Great job indeed, I wonder if the owner planned to change the tires as even though they seem in good shape but they must have expired by now, and the last thing I wish is an unfortunate accident to the owner and to this beauty
easily 80k
that meat looked dry asf
is it for sale ?
Fake
Subperb job. Since the owner was scared of the car, did you guys offer to buy it?
I guess you already know but it's best to replace all the rubber bushings in the car
Besides the fact that the rx-7 is Japanese classic, awesome work and awesome music selection 🪩🙌🏼👏🏽
Nice job, well done 😉👍 Now, Can you guys come and wash my car? 🤣😂🤣
Not sure why you cleaned the wheels with the tyres on. I do hope you put new tyres on, that would be dangerous as well as stupid. By the way those knifes are terrible quality, bit of a sell out guys. 👎🏼
I’m not a car guy so maybe this is a stupid question but why didn’t you clean the brake discs?
Amazing job! Would be great to see what happens with the rx7 like is some one going to go through the drive train and get running or going to sell it how it is!
Qué buena , chido brother
I personally would like to see the car out in the sun light as leds hide smearing/marring in the paint, but that thing would easily fetch 60-80k usd it’s literally a brand new un abused rx7 someone would buy that and make it a show car or buy it and relive their childhood dream
With the mileage 90000 dollars in Canada.
Wow, what a transformation. That literally looks like it just left the showroom. Put a new set of tyres on it and do a full service its ready to go
Probably wouldn’t have worried about washing the tires.  If they’re 23 years old,  they’ll need to be replaced for safety.
I can buy this old mazda for 5-7000 💵
I’ve never watched one of these videos… That was one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen when it comes to cars and a transformation and you didn’t do a thing to it but clean it! Just immaculate job, it opens your mind up to all the possibilities every time you see a beautiful car in disarray
All that car is missing is a HKS Super Drager Exhaust or Greddy Exhaust remember friends back in the 90s had big single pipe exhausts systems. HKS and Greddy made awesome stuff.  Japanese sports cars in the 90s were phenomenal
So, you're 1995 born?
Brilliant restore! Super.
Absolutely gorgeous!  Sexiest car Mazda ever created!
The mice died doing a ritual 😢
not worth much?.........but that rotory engine is amazing!!
I have this car 😎 in GTA V 😢
How much did he sell it for?
My uncle has one with 20k miles and that thing would go from 40mph-120mph like nothing
You lucky SOB
Beautiful car !  I didn't know you could spray the engine down like that .
woow mantap good
Change the tires! Just don't spend time cleaning them... That rubber has at least 23 years, so its dangerous. Should feel like stone.
I want to know how much y'all paid for this hidden treasure.
what about that fb tho:)
That's a beautiful car thank you for sharing with us and I do love the RX7 the original one the small ones with the B12 engine those are beautiful Puerto Ricans we take care of those cars if you make them look beautiful in Puerto Rico I must say Japanese did a great job making that car but thank you for sharing the video keep up the good work
Those tires must be hard as a rock since they are so old.
Original Miles
What about the other RX-7 in that garage?  That's the one I'd love to see restored!
I wonder how can't they damage the engine bay after washing it with water??
And here I was wondering if there was anything they would do to the discs to make them look new and perfect. 27:26
Song?
Is this Car still for sale?
Wow the battery has its charge in 23 years
Nice job!! Congrat :)   I think this carnCan worth maybe 13-15.000usd?  The only.big problem on these cars, the rotary engines which need to be redone in Max 30- 40.000 Miles... Except that, beautifull general reliability , it is Mazda ; underestimate iconic car  Nice power but low torq,and very low MPG bad points of rotary engine architecture conclusion ...
I want it that’s all I’m saying
SCRIPTED
why did you sit in front of the clean car for the sponsored segment? that's like the worst spoiler ever -_-
how mcsh  for the car
Coś pięknego kawał dobrej roboty
Dremel makes micro polisher bits.
20000?  more if they didnt see the before video.
I would love to have my E500 done but I'm in California LoL
The car looks brand new!
Car looks amazing but the rusty rotors.....gah.......at least hit them with some wd40 and steel wool while the wheels are off being cleaned.  Yuck.
I had a question: what products are best for removing light mold or mildew off a cloth/leather backseats. Guess I left the window cracked one night and some moisture got on my back seats.
next time dont spoil the car being clean in the sponsor ad please
Top  dehhh👍👍👍
YABAI!!!!
IS it me or are they washing the car on carpet 🤔
i think it would worth around 50-70k, denepding on may many parts stay original
บ่งาม
Put your extra cars away. What a wealthy-individual move.
then someone is gonna buy it, strip the whole car, mod it then crash it on a track.
Crazy there are spitzer dealerships all around me… wonder if this is near me ?
I’d cut my balls off for this car
Que increible resultado. Pregunta que le aplican a los vidrios ej: parabrisas interior? Saludos desde chile
I don’t know if I believe this at the time they open the glove compartment everything looks so clean around that I think is all made up
still garbage
I have always wanted one of these cars. Great find, and great job in its restoration. This is very exciting to watch, great video!
Wow, absolutely incredible detailing. Great Job!
As it turns out, Kamikoto is a part of a big scammy company. Same guys that run the tittle selling business on the web. Do be careful with these folks, they scammed a lot of money out of people by selling fake stuff with a high price.
Super Awesome.
Don't you think tyres should be replaced as well as all consumables ?
Those knives are garbage
All I know is.. you touch those mice with those green gloves, cut the brisket with those green gloves and then went back to cleaning the car with those same green gloves. 😂  Just kidding! You guys did an awesome job on that car.
Lol the car protected itself from the mice remember that
HARDBODY.. that RX7 is a classic where im from.. you’ll did her justice.. great job..
100k
21:30 What's that tool called? It shoots air and vibrates right?
WAOOO AMAZING JOB!!
I think it is same war around $500,000
So far other than finding it all you've talked about is cosmetic. What really matters is what's under the hood. All you opened it for was to clean it out. How many Rotors are there? What are the specs on the drive train. Have you even checked to see if the engine turns or did you just shampoo it? I came to see an iconic possibly rare car and got more info on a box of freakin knives than the car. Your shop is like a womans beauty shop. Outta here. Hope it runs. It will make funny strange sounds because it's a rotary Wankle engine. Don't be shocked it's supposed to sound like that. Haha. Millineals
From Ontario Canada, do You always need a one off crazy find?
Ayoo 😮
Just one question: How much?  Great work...but, what did it cost?
Undevlieve find, a few extra dead mice, but some like house music.  One question, how does your floor draining system work, I'm extremely curious and slightly confused.
What is that compound you're shampooing it with?? Thanks. Dandahermit
Is that the Toretto's red car in Fast furious 1?
Maybe replacing 20 plus Year old tires is better than cleaning them I would hate to see a blowout ruin that beautiful car
incredible!  I had high hopes but was blown away by the perfection of the paint and interior plastic bits. I watch this with a little sadness though.  I owned a '93 - black touring.  It was my dream car and was amazing.
When can you do my rX7 next 92 24k km
so statisfying
So nice to see a classic like this being reborn again!!!!👍🏻
Pretty much my ultimate dream car right there. Love the beautiful, timeless design and the sound of the rotary engine
Very nice find! Too bad you're too far from me I would bring you my fd.
crazy that a 90's RX-7 can now be a "barn find".  I drove a 1994 RX-7 Twin Turbo, silver with red leather interior, around for a couple days before my parents recovered their senses and bought me a Chevrolet Beretta instead.  The RX-7 was the dealer's demo and he let me take it home for two days as we considered the purchase.  So close, yet so far.  Still my dream car, along with the NSX.  Unfortunately these are becoming so rare because of the F&F movies, so many people have ruined them.
Excellent work!  But those tires must be replaced ASAP!
New rotors would have done her proud.
Hideaway headlights!! My 1988 Acura Integra had those!!!!
I wish i would have seen the owner face once he saw it all cleaned up
Is it for sell I wanna buy this car ?????? Please let me know
i want to see this car driving on the road after all the effort cleaning until it looks like new..next video pls.
My first job out of high school was detailing (recon) used cards for a Chevy dealer.
Yeah lets waste some time washing some 25 yr old tyres 🤦‍♂️
The Apex seals will need to be replaced most likely. Rotary are a engineering dead end. Also you can’t be taller than 5’9”
So Mazda made three versions of the RX7 in this model and years.  I was selling them when they first came out.  There was the base model, a race version and a touring version. This one is the racing version because it has the red stabilizer under the hood, mounted between the shock towers. The roof design was unique for aerodynamics. Unlike other RX7s there were no convertibles, only hard tops.  It was a Rotary engine with turbo charge. Zero to Sixty in 4.5 seconds. The touring version had a Bose stereo system and automatic transmission, all others were manual five speed.  Estimated value with those miles, 40K. Awesome find, these are very rare !
Rare?  🫢🫢  but its a Mazda ??
I just hope you didnt start the engine right away....rolling down the garage exit made me afraid :D
i would sell my soul for this car. in black too. dream car.
Lovely work. The only extra step I would've taken is running an ozone generator in it for a couple hours for that extra biological protection...dang mice.
you can't use 23 old tires
Bro admitted to loving meat🙀
hard to believe
OMG! I'd Love to make a find like that! Gorgeous!
Next can you please find. The 1998 Toyota supra
$127,500.00 its estimated value.  It is only for someone like J. Leno who may want to add it to his collection of fine automobiles.  When this car, (every nut and bolt and everything else),  is  in showroom specs, you will be inundated with offers.    Whoever is lucky enough to buy this fine automobile, she will not be driving a car, she will be driving a piece of history.    That is if you agree to my undervalued estimate.
Pon la fecha de las gomas
Si tuviera esos años esas gomas no sirvieran estarían vencidas
What steam vac do you guys recommend?  around $200  thanks!
Too bad those rotary engines are trash ..!!!
Still a gorgeous car
That looks like an R1, if so nice find. Real rare I had one.

Pro Tipp: Mute
Drove 140 mph and got scared of it? Doesnt want face to be seen, blurs face out?  Man was definitely in a police chase back then and didnt want the heat🤣
Please for the love of it keep these cars bone stock.not many left to show these millenials what the golden Era of Japan imports was like.
DOT on the old rotten tires. See so much bs here
Those tyres absolutely need replacing , so why clean them ?
Nice job
Dang keep making fake videos bros…..
the game of 23  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  hahahahaha....so ridiculous
Engine details..?
What did the owner do with the first GEN Rx7. The one you guys didn’t clean. an awesome job on the clean up the car really looks amazing.
RX7, I have 2  cars, very fast cars, I give one to my son, and  destroy  the car, I ending,  selling  for 300.00 dollars
Might have been asked already, but what about the FB rx7 also in the garage?
🤤🤤🤤 very good clean btw. If that was done half assed the rest would be pointless.
Looks good, but there is no way that engine's seals survived sitting for that long.
sure why not
Insane!!!!!!
That’s like 40k
You guys, in fact, did an irreproachable job, the likes of which I've never seen in my 70 years. I am passionate about cars and a rarity like this is the dream of anyone who appreciates used vehicles and in such rare condition.     But you have deeply disappointed me, and certainly thousands of other enthusiasts of quality, recovered cars, by not showing, even for a few seconds, the passionate noise of this jewel!          Why did you decide to withhold this pleasure from us?         Watching this video was like reading a good novel without the last few pages!      What a dumb way to try and get more followers for your channel.
Having owned a RX7 & RX8, I can only say , Just stunning!.. 😊
You're so lucky what a steal.
I’ll definitely buy this off you
Thank you for removing dealer garb !!!
You guys did a really nice job on that car. AMMO NYC would be proud.
140? Rookie numbers 😂
Very satisfying transformation! I have a question (around 11:20) : I always heard that we needed to cover the alternator so that the water doesn't directly hit it with pressure and potentially damage it. What are your thoughts about that? Thanks you!
I remember when these things were new. You guys did an excellent job of cleaning this car to make it showroom fresh again. I hope Mazda is watching.
I think it's worth around Tree Fiddy.
my dream car...ahh I am so jealous :(
Leavin brake discs with rust... really!? It doesn't work.
Only in Ohio
👎👎👎🤮🤮🤮
The one shown here is the R1 model, no options but power windows, stickey simulated suede seats shown only available on the r1 model. Also has a bright read strut tower brace says RX7 on it. Only r1 has this stock brace.This is the rarest of the Rx7s they have here. Worth over 150k today. Check out Barrett Jackson auctions.
16:19  what is the song name sir?
wow what a gem could’ve atleast cleaned the rotors 🤷🏼‍♂️
That was very satisfying to watch
Парни - вы красавцы!
At least 40k+ a Supra from those years cost about ads much in worse condition.
The car will easily sell for $50-60k to a collector.
Easy
Dream Car
Rusty discs... would've done something about those. Other than that 👌🏼
I live in Ashland. I have a 1974 Chevy c30 dually with 36 thousand original miles that’s been sitting in a barn for 16 years if you guys want to make a video on cleaning it up. It’s got brown paint that’s full of gold flakes
There's no way those tires are any good after 23 years ... I'd swap those out!
As someone who appreciates the hard work y’all do, it gives chills watching you guys get it done. Love to see it 💪🏼
Excellent job🙂 Next level is the rusty brake disc😉
What about that older RX7 on the right side of the garage?!  That one looks even cooler!
HE GOT SCARED OF THE CAR, BRUH💀💀🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
So sick. I wish I bought a 2002 civic and kept it in a barn until today haha
Just washing a car is not what I consider "RESTAURATION" ... just saying!
Ficou incrível  maravilhoso
I would cry my ass off if I found one of this beautiful time machine left abandoned like that
Mis webos también
I costumize my Mazda rx7 on a drift car😍
Amazing job - looks superb.  Just one question - I noticed you start washing with a mitt straight from the snow foam.  I thought the snow foam was to lift the contaminants and leftover bits of dirt - aren't you risking pushing them over the paint by doing this and hence adding to the work you have to restore the paint finish?
Poderiam ligar o carro
Does it run helloo
Damn bro I’m not no expert but I’m pretty sure that pressure wash wasn’t supposed to be that close to the car. 😢
Great detail job! I would personally not pressure wash the engine bay and opt for a rinse instead - avoiding the electronics especially!
But u dont clean rust on the disk brake....
This car with all the dirt and dead mice was actually in an outstanding condition for sitting 23 years. A d after it's cleaned up still looking banging.
How hard was it to get rid of the Mouse smell?
$35,000
Do you know if he wants to sell it? Anyway to get his email or something for offer?
I saw a porsche next to it.
You get that thing cherry and running, $55-60k might be possible. That's one of the desirable years. NOBODY has one with that low mileage, period!
I read that the only thing you should use on rubber, past cleaning, is castor oil.
50 60 K$?
I vote $50k
Awesome......the rusty rotors tho.
washing a car is not restoring it, you retarded youtuber
I need such type of detailing for my Civic 96 D17A Vtec prosmetic
Mazda Comes to Life after 23 years ...waaaw
awesome
How do you find things like this? Thats absolutely crazy
Of all cars ever made, I've never been more impressed, than I have been with the RX-7.  It's lines have not been equalled, EVER.  Good job with this one.
I never really liked it from NFS But it turned out to be a really good looking little car
Beautiful car, but I’m not buying that 140mph tale. 😂
Who buys a new car, gets scared of it then never drives it again LOL. People made of money.
Those mice were highly educated and well-mannered that they didn't do any damages to the rented property. Shame they lost their lives.
He took it 140 and got scared…. What? Lmao why buy a sports car in the first place
Can you tal my name of the car
Outstanding job
Decontaminate the paint aka wash… aka soap and water…  aka “buy my bottle of paint decontamination liquid”
This superb rx7 really could do with a dry ice cleaning .. especially underneath..
These cars were ahead of their time.  I worked at a Mazda Pontiac GMC Buick dealership in parts and service throughout the 90s.  When the '93 twin turbos arrived we drove them down the highway to put gas in them.  I was amazed by how fast and agile they were.  I let off the accelerator at 150 MPH while the speedo was still climbing at a pretty good clip.  They were so incredibly lightweight.  Fastest I've ever taken any vehicle on the road.  They were impressive and we had also just taken delivery of the Ponctiac Friehawk LT1s which were no match for the new RX-7s.
Holy cow that looks in mint condition
Whoa! 2jz engine! I retract my previous statement!
Hit the brake and the tires looks dirtier as before the clean up!
At first I thought it would be worth around 40K. But after seeing how well she cleaned up and everything else including the engine work and the fact of only 8800 miles might hit 100K @ Mecum!
kamikoto is a scam, please do your research before taking sponsors.
is the tyre new ? how can any tyre stay that long
Speechless.
Jadi inget film Korea "Stellar: A Magical Ride" xD
Nice and satisfying.... 😊
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
This is one of the legends
this is treasure
Please don’t ruin it…
what a nice job guys !
You have done great job bringing this machine back to life. It is one of my favorite car beside Datsun 260 and 280 Z
Wasted time cleaning and spraying and washing. Dry ice clean would have cut your time by 3/4. My first job at 16 was working at a BMW/Mazda/VW dealer. I got to drive these cars new at 16. Pretty awesome job.
That's a weird way to advertise a knife. Japanese steel is terrible, which is why they had to go through such extremes over the centuries to make it into something useful. Terrible steel combined with insane skill gave great swords. But it's not because they were bored and thought it's a fun way to spend a month (folding and refolding the steel).
What an amazing experience and treasure 😎👍
If i there😌
Staged ??
That’s funny my dad has the same exact car and his can’t have more miles. It’s been sitting in the garage since I was a kid, he won it at local dealership drawing but said insurance was way too much so he never drove it haha
LMFAO I knew this was going to be Ohio when I saw the spitzer dealer tag on the back.
I would have looked right over that Rx7 for the blue one!!!!😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Hey WD Where I can get a Steam Claeaner like that one you used  Where and wich Brand
I thought RX7 produced after 1995 were not allowed in the US market.
The under carriage looks good, pay attention to the bushings.
You guys do it for free??? That's amazing!
why does your brisket look like that bro? where’s the red juicy goodness @WD Detailing
If ur gonna copy Ammo NYC, dude get better content....this car was clean as fuk before u even started....I hate when ppl copy someone else's channel then do trash ass content....
Its a Wankel engine?
Where you guys located in Ohio and do you detail other cars?
Well Done! What a Beautiful car!! ❤
Всем привет, сколько стоит в америке декорация подобного рода? Застарить, и запылить машину?
What a hot car. Mazda killed it when they designed this thing.
I like RX-7 because it was beautiful and sporty without being overly expensive.
What exactly are you using to clean the glovebox and the wheel wells? I'm a new fan of your channel and love how meticulous you are!
I wish we could hear it crank, but great job on the detail! Clean 🧼
Ci sarà un pt2 ?
So jealous of this car!!! This was my dream car growing up! Still one of my top most wanted cars! You guys did a amazing job!!!!
I’d say if it’s not rotted you could prolly get like 30gs for it
Wow, I saw the small click of the finding. Search for ya and Lord this care is beautiful 😍. Great job 👏
Great job guys, really first class detailing work, but isn't that a bit like putting lipstick on a pig.  The real work is yet to be done. No one could actually drive the car, as there is a ton of work to be done to the engine, filters, lubricants, suspension etc etc etc. Anything that has sat and not been driven for 23 years is so far from roadworthy. And its going to get all dirty again doing all of that work
At the beginning: that car is a total goner  At the end: Damn boy!!! that looks fresh off the Dealership
Never soak carpet or upholstery kids. Clean the top layer only and you can with a light mist or just a damp cloth.  You'll just invite stains to come back or create a mold village if not properly dried out. Sad this car got soaked.
I'd love to buy that blue one in that same barn! Any information would be great!
How did they find this car untouched for so many years????
I like that you still poured a lot of heart in to tires you knew were out of DOT age specifications and would have to be replaced. Unless it got new tires before the cleaning.
23 years years?   My car gets all that dust in 1 week where I live.
20k min running
It still baffles me today how men can wear tight pants like a girl
You should of sanded the rotors and took that rust off
My dream car,❤️
bring back memories, i bought RX7 in the year of 2000. using it for  4 year, and sold it to myfriend and he smashed the car to the tree
Talk about some flat spots on those tires. It was noticeable when he was cleaning the rims and rotating them.
Very meticulously done up. Wondering if the owner change to new tyres.
Great job. What a beautiful car. Hopefully they saved the the other Mazda in that garage.
I found a problem with the car.. It needs a 2JZ in it!
Wow good job 👍 👍
That’s a dumb reason to no drive it. 8800 miles. Then he does 140 and says he’s scared. Then don’t do 140
This is a great video and the car looks amazing. Could you please tell me where you found the music that you used throughout the video?
Tyres definitely have to be changed
Kamikoto china product scams
I tnk no fresh :)
Sorry but screw that FD I’d take the FB❤❤
yall did an outstanding job, that car is absolutely gorgeous!
Ugh, I want it so bad, but I know whatever minimum wage job I'm gonna get will never muster up enough cash to get a JDM car, or any other type of car I want. I'm probably going to be stuck with some crappy little cheap honda I find locally, and with the way that inflation has been hitting I would assume it would get worse and worse. Im from Michigan, and any in-state or neighboring states  car deals, even early 2000s beaters in decent condition are running in the 8+ grand range. That's more than I'll ever be able to afford.
I know a guy who bought a vette and put 8000 miles on it. Every now and again he would wash dust off. Kept for Years and decided to go buy another new one this year. His old vette paid for it.
Ooof what a beauty
Wow
Those tires are WAY too old to be on the road. It needs new tires.
Ain’t nobody leaving these in barns. #fake
As a detailer and parts fitter of 30 years I found your channel very entertaining. The problem with being a detailer in the uk it’s rare to find a good boss that treats you the right way. Your only name is the valeter. You get paid crap wages you have harsh Woking conditions and get treated like shit. You are seen as the lowest. The dealerships are all pretty much the same here. It’s 2:00 am now I’m up with another herniated L4 L5  lower lumbar disc caused by being overworked by greedy demons. If you are going threw the same my heart goes out to you. I do like your attention to detail tho you did an awesome job.. 👍👍
Omg! The lagendary RX7.
So GOOOOD! Love the storytelling and the editing! Great work!
Can you please help me with 2 questions? The detailing brush you use & where to buy? I bought a Jeep Wrangler JL and discovered it has paint over spray. Can I treat this myself & how? If you can help me?  I'll give you my contact info.
Great channel lifetime subscriber here what kind of steamer do you use an solution for deep  cleaning thank you soooo much.
Always have loved the RX-7 it’s my dream car and I WILL one day own one.
Wow just wow
Call BS , great blades but the handels are to small..
It's worth who is willing to pay the most..!.!...
欲しい！！
not sure if im correct but on the wheels was a line of rust maybe had a flood with it in the barn, again just right after you said something and i thought about it.
There are people that dream of Ferraris and Lamborghinis. That there is one of my 3 unicorns!
What a gorgeous car. Wish it was mine! ❤️
Espectacular
25:35 leave that AWFUL wing off of the car !!
Can’t believe that you didn’t start it
The mouse nest might be in the ductwork, they find ways to build through the blower fan intake. Also could see the flat spots on the tire while you rotated them for cleaning.  Awesome car. Getting out of high-school when this was in production. Dream then and still a dream now👍😆
incredible car.  I get its original, but I still wanna see it lowered with tinted windows and nice wheels. The car deserves that, and you can always keep the original stuff to build it in at any time. But it really looks terrible like that, compared to how it can look haha
'Behind this Garage door is one of the craziest staged videos we've ever......'   I call complete BS and there's plenty of evidence in the video. Neat Car though.
Idc how much you sell it for I’ll take it off your hands this is mine and my friends dream to own a rotary and drive one!
What’s the name of the song used for the disassembly part?
You missed the headlights,  never saw you clean them
This is my dream car.nice find
This video looked like the owner didn't payed you well 🙄🤷🏻
Wow that's an ohio car, and dealer name spitzer...I estimate the value is 85k.
I would love to have you guys come do my dad's 73 firebird when he and I get it running its been parked since 03
Are those tires still any good after all these 23 years, tho, to clean them?
Did they not clean the engine bay? Also still needs new brakes. Still a lot of work to be done clearly....
My price guess:   Somewhere between $100-$100,000
These cars steal my heart.
Good job!
Tires need to be replaced since they have expired
Hey bro have you ever found a z before messed up and with non detail
Lindíssimo serviço
I'm saying 75 to100k I'm 45 and that car was an is bad!!!
This reminds me of my 96 eagle talon tsi,  loved that car but man did it fall apart fast.  Gas tank leaked and second gear kinda stopped working, all in it was a POS.   Wish I had the rx7 instead
sorry mate. Your exhaust manifold is completely shot. Might wanna get that checked out will spread to head gaskets and will be thousands to repair.
My only regret in life is not purchasing an RX7 when I had the chance. Instead my wife talked me into her Subaru Impreza sti 2007 Hawkeye on all obsidian black with tints and black alloys. Only just over 70000 miles on the clock. Lost out on my dream car for the wifes car, typical 😁.  Settled for my hayabusa.   Not sure about america but in Europe one of these models of RX7 costs over 27000 with high miles and decent bodywork. Those miles and condition of the car you could triple that price.  Saying that many cars in america are seriously over priced.  You guys are ripped off terribly on a daily basis. If someone could do this work on the Impreza I'd have it there on a monthly basis
What a treasure to find
Friend, it would not be wise to have disassembled the entire panel for more efficient cleaning, there may still be debris from the rats there.
Im wondering what tools u used for deep cleaning like this one. Can u tell me more about car detergent?
Una joya!
Great Restoration Job. Enjoyed watching this Channel! One of My favorite 3rd Generation RX7 Body Styles. In Philadelphia area, My Performance Shop (Wright Foreign and Exotic Repair). Turbo Charged about 80 1st Generstion Carburetor RX7's with Suspension and Shock Updates also. I Loved the 13B Engime. I Installed 12 Rotory Engineering Engines and They were the Hot Ticket at That Time, in the Early 80's. Now that in Semi Retired in Florida, I Miss Thise Days!!!
Its always interesting how different a car can look after so many years. Says a lot about climate and ventilation in this garage. Is it a wet, warm country, and no fresh air comes to the car, there is almost nothing left. Is it dry and the ventilation is good, the car can stay 30+years and it will look great after a good wash. But i hope you change at least the oil before the first startup. The Wankel motor needs probably the most attention of all engines. But you did a great job to this car. I really like the rx7
The guy is going to make us believe that he found a car that had been abandoned for 23 years but that he drives it straight after getting it out of the barn and its tires are not marked .... Stop lying guy !!
Fake fake fake. How did the mice get in? Where are the mouse droppings? Tyres are all ok and rubbers on the car are not cracked.  Fake as it can be.
The fact that you found a bone stock RX7 in that good of condition is just insane to me. I’m curious just how many of those are left in the states
I love this car the Mazda RX-7 is actually my dream car can be hard to find tho
How is nobody talking about the classic RX7 sitting right next to it? It’s more vintage than the FD.
So sad you accepted an ad from a scam companu
all I see is that it needs new brakes
if i had to guess id say this could easily sell at an auction for between 75-100k
Новое поколение молодых долбаебов называло мойку грязной Машины детейлингом
take the blue car to it well be amazing
yeah ok who the f leave a car like that at this state
How much did you guys get the car for? Hope you guys gave that old man a deal he clearly needs it telling by his garage door.
Barn find rx7? FOH!!
I'm guessing 100k
That's my dream car right there.
I'm sure you guys know this; but, those 23 year old tires are dangerous to drive on and need to be replaced.  Over time, rubber hardens to the point of them being a major safety risk on the road.  You could be on an on-ramp one second, and wrapped around a pole the next.  There's been a lot of nice low-mileage cars totaled because of this.
I'd have you guys do the same for my '93 Lexus SC400 if it weren't in need of much more than just a day at the spa.
All the stickers increase the value of the car. Okay what about all the 🐭 chewing up shit? Does that devalue the car?
Honestly .. you have the smartest garage floor !! I am impressed by it 😂👍🏻 hats up for the guy who had the idea to create such floor!
You can almost smell the before and after. Great job!!!
The transformation was amazing. It does kind of scare me how much water goes into the electronics, engine, carpet and seats though
You should have painted the rotors black
I got a message on Telegram that I've won the car is it true or not? I don't know if it's a scam
Sell it to Tommy f yeah
Heck I'm just looking for a good glass cleaner
First think that came to my mind : get rid of those 30 years old tyres. But no, you give them a good wash 🤣

I liked the video but I have to give it a dislike for The Advertiser you're promoting. *That Chinnes knife company also owns Established Titles.* THEY'RE BOTH A SCAM. Please do your homework before setting us up to being ripped off.  I know they offer huge money to YouTubers but you're really ripping off your viewers. Established Titles does NOT own any property in Scotland and that comes from the Scottish land and property managment Department in Scotland. These "amazing" knives. You could literally get a better set of knives going to Walmart. They do not stay sharp and the metal is the lowest quality of metal. Look it up. Their website is full of lies. They can only afford to give you a bunch of money because they have very low to no overhead.  *It's called Integrity guys.*
Do your self a favour rip that shitty unreliable rotary out of it. Turbo system is shit , vacuum controls for the turbos don’t work , good luck with your apex seals. Just throw an ls in it and call it a day.
Only one tire is flat. The mice don't look authentic as there is no decomposition. Prove me wrong but this is staged for the views. Too many details don't line up.
So satisfying! Awesome job boys!
that meat was delicious, it look like a rock xd (good video just joking about the rock)

Research your sponsor for kamikoto. It’s been reported that they are a scam organization. Connected to purchase land and have lord as a title
@23:40 car looks relaxed and happy.
Hey man, amazing video and restoration! Unfortunately, Kamikoto is notorious for its scam connections to "Failventures". Either A) you've been fooled and convinced into believing you're actually promoting something of quality, or B) you know how shady these companies are, yet don't care and continue to advertise it? Ik they're paying you like 20k to say that, but they're a total scam where they rebrand cheap products under the guise of quality, all while being the very own suppliers of the product itself. They act like they're selling "quality" products but in reality it's just a bunch of scam brands they've created to advertise their own products, like these crap knives. Really disappointing to see that so many people are either ignorant to this and don't do any research into what they're advertising, or are just shamelessly promoting low-quality Chinese products. I hope you're not the latter. All things aside though, amazing barn find and restoration.
Y’all did a good job
Amazing job!!! Well done!!
From the Spitzer dealership in my old hometown....
Awesome!!!!!
Ive never uderstood how people can take a sports car drive it fast and get to scared to use it so they just store it for two decades  that being said its amazing you made this thing look new, Im just scared of how much it will sell for driving the price of my dream car further in the sky
Meu carro fica mais sujo em 6 meses do que esse carro em 23 anos. O couro nem ressecou isso aí maior migue
Hope tyres were changes. Otherwise driving this is a deathwish. Not to mention a detailed mechanical checkup.
Hey if you get sick of it I’ll take it
You did not wash the car seats

The engines on these cars are a pain in the ass. Good luck.
Good job guys, I really enjoyed it. Best of luck.
FD3S.......
I had to stop watching because you filmed the car being pulled out of the garage with the phone vertical! This is not TikTok or YouTube shorts!
Baby I don't understand this grill cheese Obama  sandwich
You guys are professionals keep up the good work 😉
I just saw this on Facebook like 3 days ago and here I am watching the whole video on yt
"we read every comment you leave" No you dont. read all 4359 Comments? not a chance in hell bruh. Though ill say buying a car thats marketed as "hi i go FAST" but being scared when it does and then never touching it again is like buying a grenade but being shocked when it blows up.
You really like your little brush don't you?
Great job guys...next to the NSX, this is easily the most beautiful car to ever come out of Japan!
OMG , o want live not in Russia
Nice
whats the vacuum that you use at 19:00 ??
FAKE, you can see in the video that the creation date of this tire is 2017, it can not be unwashed for 23 years🤣🤣🤣
Damn
2 rx-7 in a same garage
i think 1996 was the last  year theeese has the twin turbo rotary motors ✨⭐️
Wow, that's sick workmanship guys!  Such nice work on that car.  Super impressed.
You should have cleaned the break rotors.
Probably worth between $30-$45k, maybe even $50,000. Great job! Would be a great show car too!
hopefully no us kid will ruin the car in a few months with his „tuning skilz“
Wonderfull🇧🇷
Какой же вы хернёй занимаетесь..... Колёсную арку помыли, а диски не поменяли.....
What a find, what a car, been driven in one, my opinion on it worth today with 8800 + mies, 40k or better. Great find
120.000 USD is my offer
Bologna
Great -- what about the other RX-7 that was also in the garage?
Расстрелять вас за такую мойку двигателя!...
£50k....easy. Stunning example. I want it!!
Just a few dead mice which we won’t even mention lol 😂
I'd still want a Buick grand national
Now do the first gen NA next to it.
Neat, but "I drove 140mph on an RX7 and so scared I never wanna drive the car again"? part makes no sense... I would have orgasm for doing 140mph in an RX7...
That brisket looks hella dry 😅😂
Dream car. Thats not fair!!
I worked for a guy that has done high end detailing for 30 years and they make chemicals that do the wheel wells and calipers and wherls and tires that work without using a brush and all that finger work
普通上から洗って下にいくでしょ？洗う順番逆じゃんw 養生とかもしてないし…
Beautiful ❤❤New ~100%
Why do you do it for free? Looks amazing.
Change the tires because these got a flat tire
POP UP UP AND DOWN HEADLIGHTS
Wow....old mazda emblem
Next time disconnnect the battery when washing engine 👍
What cleaner r u using?
Spot on👌
I don't see you put new brakes and put a  loud exhaust on it.
Even sitting in that garage for so many years, the tires would be rotted at the very least. I smell a fish!
We are watching all the way from Zimbabwe wishing you could come over and detail or Mazda Familiar, its been parked for 4 years now
So he voluntarily drove the car 140mph and then got scared? Lol i call bullshit. No one is scared of a stock rx7
my baby😔😢
Legendary car. You are lucky that mazda was not rusted from staying so long time. Mazda realy love rust a lot.
10:30 absolutely, I hate seeing dealership stickers on the damn paint....F*** You! Carmax!
When I buy a car I make sure I let the dealer know that I want none of their badges on the vehicle. I spend enough money on the car I don't need to advertise them also
End result looks great but those rusty discs... can't believe they didn't get the rust off, really brings down the result.. :/
wow... dont touch it... dont tune it... drain the oil... and keep it try... and in 10 or more years this car is 50000 maybe more...
The tyres are old, i would change them because they are likely perrished. Change all the fluids too. the car has been sitting for a long time its gonna need new oil pumped around the engine. Be careful starting this up for the first time. You don't want to get old oil hot that might block some oil runs. Also bushings are all old and probably should be replaced. I'm sure you know all this but just in case. edit: Also don't spray the altinator with water.
I don’t know why you bothered to wash the tires, they are not safe and expired.   Very nice car but it needs at least a few grand in tires, breaks, rotted lines, hoses, seals, bearings, bad injectors, weather stripping, and windshield wipers to name a few.
I want to buy it, contact me :D
I’m guessing the owner took a shit.
For the value, are you including the dead mice?
Owner got scared in RX7 at 140? What a pussy!!!
Looks insane credit to you guys well done!!
Looks like budget family car lul
Thought it looked AMAZING.... EXCEPT... Those brake rotors. I know not your job to change those out but man they really ruined the look. A wire brush to at least knock off that surface rust would have changed it 10 fold.
replace those nasty rotors
Asking for a like and sub within the first 10 seconds is grounds for a dislike and no sub, wait til the end like viewers should before asking for an opinion
Did you guys give it back to the owner or did the owner sold it to you guys?  That car in that condition is worth a lot of money.  It's a special car.   I know someone who would pay a high price for it.
Это у нас называется мойка, а у них это работа носит название "реставрация".
Please make sure this car gets drove and not in someone’s collection just sitting there it’s a beautiful car it needs to be enjoyed
that was ace looks like it rolled out the factory well done to you chaps cracking job
Someone buys it, cuts arches, rivets on RB kit. Loads of camber and paints it pink. 😂
I wonder how much would Mazda offer to buy it back
First, the mice have not passed one week since their death because they did not decompose. Secondly, why do you put the remains of the laundry dryer in the drawers and the motor chest?
Really like the rx7
такое чувство что она стояла всего месяц или 3 месяца, как она там простояла 20 лет ничего не заржавело
are tyres still in good condition after 23 years?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EF2nOyfew0
Beautefull!!! Movie crazyyyyyy
77,000
Original Miles
Value of the car is  $105,000 in  mint condition 8800 and  something miles. Great job you have done to restore it ! Do not sell for less than 100000 dollars
Loved my 1980 RX-7. I sold it to buy a Renault Encore because I had a first child on the way.
Great job.  If it was me would of put new tyres on it.. Been sitting for all that time
😀😀😁😁😍😍👍👍International Online Shop
RX7  the mouse killer :D
$$$$$$$$$$$
I like this car
Why put a video up of you valeting the car, then chuck in a sponsor add with the car cleaned in the background should of used a different car or a different background, just completely ruined the final result.
Some day, some one, some where will chuck an LS in this thing.
SCHMICKO!  Brill Job!     & Kamikoto - Mmmmm Japanese Steel!   Wellness from Australia.
Saludos . Excelente videi de recuperación de RX7 . Como puedo saber que productos usaste para las diferentes limpieza y a,que diluciones.  Desde los productos que usaste para los aros , las gomas y para lavar por debajo del vehículo.  Me interesa mucho saber que marca y productos usas y sus diluciones e incluso lo que usas para limpiar el interior del auto . Gracias desde ya si puedes contestar mis preguntas .   Disculpa que escriba en español . 🙄
engine after 23 years stoped?? good look for at first start
80k-100 all day
Fucking awesome
Back in the day smoking was sooooooo hot and trendy the cig lighter used to be where the car push to start button now is….
Im not big into foreign cars myself, but i do very much respect a rare find regardless of the make
I'd like to know what this detail cost
This car is a mess. The amount of dirt it accumulated on its 8k miles is insane.
Fantastic work but the calipers still rusty :(
Wow, I wouldn't mind buying this car. Is the guy selling it?
You guys do it for free??!! 😮
Another set of beautiful rims will be perfect.
The quality of the visual restoration is pretty impressive. So hard work to bring back this legendary car to its former glory.  Though I'm  note sure if a full washing of the engine area, battery and electric cables is a good idea.   And do we know if the car is  or will be fully restored?  All the parts should have been removed; steering, suspensions unfolded, double-checked; oils, fluids removed, engine disassembled to pieces, checked through from A to Z; petrol tanks removed (changed if rusty inside, which is most probably the case), brakes & calipers fully restored, and the original tire to be replaced to a new one.  Until it is only a museum/exhibition piece.
only in ohio
Love to hate those cars. Had one and never again. At least no unless its engine swapped to something better like in inline 4.
Lets hope this doesn't end up stanced, chopped and eventually wrapped around a lamp post
How about the blue fb next to it......?
This is perfect then I understand
BRO WTF. que broxa viu
can i have it?
What was the second car? Next to the rx-7 in the garage
Pressure washing a car that close and covered in dirt is messing up the paint job bad. You're just pushing the dirt into the paint inbedding it in. You should likely spray from a distance or lower pressure until mostly clean, give wash than use high pressure if needed.
Is the car for sale?
Very nice job guys personally I would keep it as it is with no mods
Great barn faind. Beautiful Mazda RX7. Great detail bether then factori. Bat whi no Mazda logo ?
I'm hoping they'll do all the mechanical stuff that it needs? New hoses, rubber fuel lines, oil/fluids and rubbers
It's like putting it in a time capsule. Although it's dirty, it is basically brand new.
かっけ
Thanks to those mice for not damaging , RIP
65.000$ ?
i would say that you could turn this into a project car but you only do detailing so maybe someone could do the build for you and you pay for what he put in the car
Fantastic job guys well done.
What a treasure, fully original
its CLEAN! love it
11:25 make sure to cover the alternator with some plastic before spraying water into the engine bay.
Ohhh it really bothers me when detailers wash down the carpets but then don't take out the carpets to clean up all that dirty smelly water that's flowed under the carpet through the holes! Guys, come on! That's gonna stink over time and have tons of vile bacteria growing in it! If you're gonna detail a car, do it right!
Übertrieben krass
What a beauty
i mean if i bring my mom there and have her work for ya'll she will make you work overtime LOL
Can I buy it from you?
The car next to it is also incredibly rare, its a second generation rx7 too, if that has low miles that would be worth a fortune. Detail that one too.
My dream 😔
I own 2 fds.  I need you guys to clean & detail mine lol...they have been stored for a few years.  You guys did a great job on this car
RX-7 is such a beautiful car. I would love to be an owner of a RX-7.
👌
Wow! I absolutely love FD RX-7 and this one gorgeous! These is a prime example of JDM Legend ❤️
Total subscribe, mindblowing content!🙋🙋🙋
What about the older late 80's, early 90's RX-7 that was right next to it?
I wouldn't be surprised if this sold for over 100k
88k
I want to see these guys clean out a Lamborghini truck the very old one from some year in the 90s I guess
You should do the series 2 as well!
u really stuck the fuckin finished car in the background of the ad and ruined it...yikes
WOW Nice job! Those were some lazy Misues, they got very lucky more of them didn't move in and chomp down on those wires.
Kamikoto is a scam.. Drop them soon so don’t fuck over your viewers by getting them to buy dodgy products.
@robdham
such a beauty
nice job fellas 👍🏻 i assume people have already asked if its for sale 😁
I’ll never understand all these people that bought these cars when they came out and just like preserved them and only run it for 8,800 miles??? Today people buy a new car it’s either totaled in a year or 30,000 miles in 3 months….
the real treasure
Wow amazing job🎉
Wow 😮 amazing find
You can do a new exhaust maybe??
It just needs new rotors, ceramic tint, PPF and me as its owner.
Very nice detail job. 👍 The FD3S was only on the US market for 3 years, 1993-1995 They were $40k cars new, which kept sales numbers low.  I have a 1995 FD, the rarest year, in which they only built 500 total.   Mine is one of 7, but the rotary is long gone. Currently has a 7 litre LS motor, 540hp to the wheels. It's pretty clean and totally rust free, but I can only wish it was as nice as this one. 😎
Muy bonito vehículo. Me agrada su línea.  Lo dejaron nuevecito. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Did you inspect up under the dashboard? If mice got into the glove box I bet they spent time behind the dash. Also don't we get to see it run and drive?
My dream car
Talented, we’ll trained, professional, and passionate.   Nicely done!
just so you know, kamikoto is a scam with low quality Chinese steel knives...
Fake
this is legitimately $100k+/- car to a collector
You know a Puerto Rican was the owner of those..,
Amazon job
please get a new set of tires for it before you take it to the road...
Don’t drive too much on those tires, the rubber degrades over time, those tires aren’t safe anymore. Old “original” tires are why Paul Walker is dead.
These comments and likes are why these guys can buy this car and you can't.  Nice find fellas.
My dream car since I was 13, I'm 35 now. I'm glad to see one that's not molested.
Now double the value by doing a LS swap
60k easily
UHH ARE YOU SELLING THIS CAR
I hope all fluids and filters were changed before she ran after 23 years.
Nice 👍
Very good job lads!!! 😊
I'm sorry but that brisket was trash lol
This will fetch a good amount of money. For a car collector this is better than a giant Diamond
that's worth about 150k minimum. get the right crowd at an auction, i wouldn't be too surprised if it went upwards of a quarter mil. that's likely the rarest rx-7 on the planet.
*its should've been me, not him*
Sheeshhhh
The Z is more special.
I definitely would not trust those tires. Beautiful find tho!!!!!
Then the owner of the car puts it back in his garage for another 10 more years.
Awesome video, definitely love the RX7! Ever since I first saw it on the first Fast and the Furious I have been in love with Mazda Rx7s. You guys need to go back and detail the 1st gen blue Mazda Rx7 that was sitting there, too! I would love to see the finish for that one. Keep up the great content, guys! Subscribing now!
I just ran across this video today and....not bad atoll. Dang good job fellas... kinda makes me wanna see what ya really have going on
I would definitely resurface the rotors before trying to drive 👍🏼
I just don't understand how a 23 years old car seating in one place without moving, can have Tires in great condition 🤔 💭 🤔
not a single person has any clue .. how much it costs now.  NO ONE.. can post $$$$  people these days.
You had a great mentor. I 🎉
blows my mind that boomers back in the day could buy a brand new car and just practically abandon it, they truly lived in the best of times
Coming from a detailer of 18 years, great work 👍👍
Modify the fuck out of it
Wow amazing
That car was sold not to far from me… pretty crazy… u guys must be based in the western pa area? Sorry first time watching
Like the Spitzer dealer's logo, it is very close to me. Been in my area for Years!
90k +/- 10K
I like the FB 80s rx7 next to it better my self had a 91 FC and a 85 gsl
Seriously you guys are awesome....nice work.
Id love to drive my 2008 Civic all the way from Canada - to get it restored & perhaps modified by you guys (or your partner businesses?) in Ohio! Where in Ohio?
is it good to spray the entire engine bay like that? even the alternator and battery, fuses etc?
Looks like a new car!
you should have dropped the front splash gaurd to see if theres more mice or dirt etc. behind that. but thats just my OCD kicking in. great video.
Nice find! I love rx7s this is probally one of the lowest mileage ones in existence. Just a little ad advice. Dont saw at the meat makes the knife look dull.  One smooth motion in with a little pressure should do it if it's sharp.not trying to be a stuckler,  just Ive managed a steakhouse for years probally why it caught my attention. If your trying to advertise how nice and sharp they are dont use it like a hacksaw.
Good stuff boys...really enjoyed your video.
Big up to the cameraman Team they did a good job 🔥
Please inbox me tell seller I will pay asking price for this vehicle!! Asap
Does it matter if the engine gets wet ? I thought you had to cover all electrical
Why would you clean tires that are over twenty years old? It’s gonna need new ones regardless.
After the restoration the owner drove it down the highway at 140MPH again and then parked it in the garage for another long nap.
Normal people would have sold the car already if they are not driving anymore, but the owner definitely made a great decision to keep it after so many years. 🎉
I had a 94 RX-7. I THINK it went to a good home. Easily my favorite car of all time
First of all congratulations on this awesome find.  Make sure you go over all the seals, the tires are most likely dry rotted and need replacement.  What about the seals in the calipers.  The Wankel motor was notorious in those days, make sure the engine is flushed twice to get the sediment out.  Fuel system clean.   This paint must be in great factory condition.  So to the value of this car, there are not many with this history and paperwork so it is pretty rare.  In this condition, and with all the mechanical issues sorted, it is most likely going to be anywhere from 68,000 - 75,000 depending if you find a collector.  I wouldn't be surprised if you pulled it over the Barrett Jackson auction it might fetch a little more.  The car is completely original and stock, no scrapes, dents or any damage I assume, I did not see any when you were detailing.  Please keep this vehicle off winter roads with salt, the Mazdas from these era can be rust buckets.
Definetly didn't think it was funny that you also cleaned the 23 year old tires xD
This can't be real right? This has to be fake... A 9k FD in this condition; bro, that's a fucking unicorn!
You said too say something that i like and dislike and the only thing i dislike is the fact it isn’t in my garage right now.
Wow, an unmolested, almost brand new FD RX-7! This should go straight to a museum, there can't be many more in this amazing condition! Great job!  Are you gonna detail the older RX-7 from that garage as well? I actually have more of a soft-spot for those 1st gen ones... the FD is just too round for my taste.
Honestly I would take the alternator out and wash everything just becuase of the mouse situation. Also its prolly worth around 50-70K for sure
Crazy find. Any chance the car was used in a crime, thus hidden away and forgotten?
WHAT A FIND...MY DREAM CAR....SUX ILL NEVER OWN ONE ENLESS I SWIPE
I want the blue car that was also in the garage.
what kind of cars they make for USA and European countries, top of the line
this is my favorite car
Did you leave the 85 rd-7 behind? (The blue one)
*Owner gets scared of the car again*
Mazda RX-7 TT, Nissan 300ZX TT, Toyota Supra TT, Mitsubishi 3000GT/ Dodge Stealth TT, Subaru SVX TT. This was a great time to drive some amazing vehicles! This car looks absolutely BAD*** well done guys!!!
nice but no use kerher for engine wash
what is he doing at the minute 21:30? what kind of machine is that?
I stumbled across this channel today.   I believe you are now one of my favorite detail channels.  There are many channels out there and some look fake or staged.  Yours appears to be the real deal.   Amazing job.
Stellar work gentleman. New to the channel here and I must say holy cow the attention to detail and the end product is so amazing. Not to mention this is one of the most satisfactory videos I’ve ever watched. The fact that it was a RX-7 was just a bonus. This is incredible!
What handheld snow foam you using ?
How do u truly remove all mold, mildew etc from inside ? I dont think it will ever be all gone, its microscopic and behind dash, inside door panels etc, ac system
I would guess those tires would be flat spotted after not moving for 20 years so probably need replacing.
I call bullshit on the back story of that car.  You don’t drive 140+ without being comfortable with it.  MF wasn’t scared of the car.
Super awesome car! It’s definitely rare to see especially ones with low miles and ones that aren’t ragged out. Looks all great to me that’s a beauty for sure! I’d say it could potentially go for a smooth $30k-$50k easily to the right buyer. Great job!!!
わざと大袈裟(人為的)に汚してるよね。 本当にここまで経年劣化してたらこんなもんじゃキレイに甦らないでしょ。
Rx7s are trash 🗑
Amazing find!!I would guess you could sell it for at least 55k as is no problem and at auction quite a bit more.I had a 93 and loved it, I wish I could afford this one!
10:20 here we go 😍
This is amazing , great work
Tip from another detailer: Cover the alternator with a plastic bag!
Outstanding attention to detail, I actually found this video to be very therapeutic (OCD).
Did you try buying the car before the restoration!?! The attention to detain was on point! You definitely knew the assignment.
so utterly satisfying. more so than the red pf rx7. i wonder what both go for on the market.
Whenever i see Rx-7 i see rob dahmn 😌
staged
You're awesome 👍.
You men did FANTASTIC detail work!   Loved the vid, it brought back good memories how I took care of my vehicles.  Thanks!
this is insane. nice find. a great car!
How much u charge for a full detail clean like this?
100k car easy!!
Guys, wonderful cleaning. Congratulations on your effort and dedication. Until the next opportunity.
Nice job man!!!! But,  how bout that mint green 7 Rite next to the black one  ROTARY POWER!!!
Spitzer tag and an Ohio plate... that's definitely from around the Cleveland area lol I'm only 40 miles away, I need to see this car! 😃
Such a beautiful car. Too bad they used a rotary engine that was so prone to failure. Fantastic job cleaning it though!
What I absolutely dislike about this car is that it's not mine.
good job guys 👍
This Garage setup reminds me of Obsessed Garage's garage. Where does the water channel and drain to on here?
37 thou
Just fast forward to the 27 minute mark.
Amazing result congrats 👏
That moment you realize your spare tire rim looks better than factory
Change the rotors! They look horrible on that otherwise immaculate machine!
So basically I just need to start a detailing company so I can find barn finds like this?
Ugly car, put it back in the garage!
I want this one because I want to mod it to the Fast and Furious. Like the one in Tokyo Drift!!!
how can u get such a mess in a car with only 8800 miles?
That interior was stunning. Looked immaculate, made me want to buy it :)
The fact that this is a non sunroof model makes it even more desirable, is it an r1?  Edit: after seeing the whole video... Suede seats= r1. That's a serious gem of a car.
Did yall wash and then keep those 20 year old tires on there?? Lol. Hope noone planned on driving it more than a mile.
Someone is going to pay big bucks for this car, I’m wondering how much it’s going to cost to repair all of the seals in the motor that are 1000% bad at this point
A lo mucho tiene tres años jajaja
definitely gave a sub! You guys are beautiful when taking care of this car! love it! continue the amazing work! People are bless to have hard workers like you doing this for free!
You could easy get 80 to 100k for that car it's near mint condition and only 8800 miles and the original Pirelli tires with the nibs still on the tires is mind blowing that guy won the car kotto
You brought the car back to life but that car isn't road ready..I wouldn't trust those tires. That oil is probably nasty
Desde argentina excelente trabajo 👍
Love the video but there are way too many ads for a channel that is likely not demonetized. Weren’t the two non skip-able ads in the begging enough?
$49k wholesale sit n wait $77k
My mom does this shit and it annoys the hell out of me. In her head nothing devalues or degrades with time so it will never be worth more or less than what she paid for it and absolutely will not sell ANYTHING. She kept a 40’s Indian and a one owner 1919 model T with wooden wheels her dad who died in 1955 bought when it was new. Hundreds of people tries to buy them. They stayed there till the barn literally collapsed around them and rotted and rusted away where nothing could be used rather than let someone else get any use out of them. Fucking stupid!
If you wanna speak to the part at end of  cleaning click here            👉 27:00
Why is there papers under the spare tyre. Seems weird for car whose done only 8800 miles and wouldn't have touched the spare wheel
Barn Find my ass you got it from a friend for a video he is to clean to be sitting in a Barn
Music name at 27:00?
Por ter sido a primeira lavagem em 23 anos, esse carro está bem limpo. Não entendo muito Inglês, mas pelo o que entendi o dono não mexeu nele desde 1999, certo? Se sim, esse carro está muito conservado por estar parado por tanto tempo. Aqui no Brasil se seu carro fica parado por 1/2 anos os fios eletricos são devorados pelos Ratos, sem contar do pneu que já estaria murcho e ressecado. De qualquer forme foi um ótimo achado, um ɛ̃fini RX-7 com 8K Milhas.
Cool vid and thanks for using some decent House music in the background and no cheesy nonsense!
i’m sorry but aren’t you supposed to cover the alternator before you rinse w out pressure you can damage the engine no?
Wait yall do this for FREE???
I don't know how many of those I had apart over the years. The vacuum system was so complicated underneath that intake manifold that most of the time hoses were rearranged and causing drivability issues. It didn't help that there was a recall on the turbocharger because most technicians were inexperienced and created more problems than they solved. The biggest complaint on that model was people didn't like how uncomfortable they were on the road and were always coming in and asking if there was a way to give it a softer ride. Of course we always told them no. They come in regularly in need of a new engine but typically upon disassembly they would need a turbo and an exhaust manifold due to cracks. Even in '90s dollars it was generally close to $20,000 out the door.
After such a long time, Tires, brakes, all liquids, all rubber hoses like fuel and break hoses, all filters, windscreen wipers etc are dead and must be replaced. otherwise this car is a rolling coffin. And for god sake, you never ever clean the engine with a high pressure cleaner 🤦🏼‍♂️
First wash in 23 years is that you or the car chump
I gotta ask why did you bother cleaning the 23 year old tyres? They are long gone by this point. Also love the story of the owner cause it's kind of ridiculous
Why didn’t you take out the carpets 😢 🤦🏽‍♂️
I would not recommend driving on such old tires, needs a replacement asap
but what is thaht  blue  one
Hope he didnt get ripped off. Enough of these shows the people rip the person off then flip the car for some insane amount
dont get a shit on the black one
Exquisite.
Japanese cars would work even after an apocalypse i swear!🥲
This is crazy, I’m 51. When I was younger you could pick one of these up for very little money. Today, this is considered a holy grail find!!. I would love to find one of these.
can i haz rx7 pls :D
never even knew there was an rx7 this close to me. well done boys
“ I got scared”- random loser
From the undercarriage it looks a lot older then 9000 miles. The swirl marks are also an indiof the car being older then the owner said. Who details a new car? Not till maybe 40k - 50k miles. Also your knife commercial showed the car clean and complete before your video was even half over.
BROSKI PLS I'M BEGGIN TO YOU DON'T PUT THE BACKGROUND SOUND! WE JUST WANT TO HEAR CLEANING SOUND NOT NON COPYRIGHT MUSİC
Yeah right.......
Was the interior solution just diluted APC?
Why aren't the tires full of dry rot, after 23 years, i do not believe it
the way the interior plastic came out after you cleaned it was so satisfying to see. the way the plastic has a smooth matte finish looks great. I'm so nostalgic for 90s JDM interiors.
Saludos de Venezuela Edo Trujillo bendiciones exelente trabajo exitos cada día que te valla bien hermano dios te bendiga que bien ese trabajo espectacular me llamo José Parra hermano yo también trabajo asiendo mantenimiento de aires acondicionados
so is the owner selling it?? if yes im really interested im a big fan of rotary
the owner drove it got scared and stored it? why not trade it in or sell it?
I think y’all are going to need to be a little more diligent about the interior detail. Ammo NYC deals with mice and barn finds and it’s never as simple as just washing out the area that the nest was in. This car might still be a biohazard
I would buy that car for 100k, what a find
The car ia New!!!!!!!  incredble!!!! Congratulations for  clean 👏👏👏👌
How much did YOU pay for the car from the the owner? It was in amazing shape, I guess you flushed the engine and replaced all fluids.
Turned out nice, except for the rotors!
Dude, what happens to all that dirt under your swisstrax?
KAMIKOTO knives are made in China and perform worse than dollar store shit.
Fake
Does it run?
I’d replace the tires after that much time, and I’m not sure it’s wise to spray down the engine bay. Too many electrical components to damage
id say it would sell upwards of $70k or more
You want to hear about the car  no knives
Should you really be spraying water all over the electrics in the engine?
This is fucking beautiful, just a few months ago I was looking into buying an rx7. I will get one, I just won’t get one right now. Mainly because of my financial situation, it wouldn’t be a smart investment buttt I will get one they’re just such beautiful cars. And this one only having 8800 miles on it.
I drove it 100 mph I was okay. Then went 120 mph and that's was cool... But let me tell ya I pushed it to 140 mph and it scares the hell out of me. So I just put it away in a deadend garage for 23 years. It only cost me $35k to buy but what's money 💰 right??!!?!  I'll buy it for $35k LMAO 🤣😂
How much would this kind of detailing cost? I'd love to have my 93 MR2 cleaned up like this. It isn't nearly this bad as this RX7 was.
How much does a professional wash like this typically cost on any other vehicle?
a car can't be left 23 years and not have atleast flat tires or smtg.... barely even has rust must be 2 years.
I'd be worried about seals, gaskets, and oil/fluids.
the things i would do for that car...
1200-2300
Above and beyond thoroughly clean.
But does it run
Overcooked the hell out of that brisket!
Wow...looks super clean!
A fellow detailer here and was wondering about your under hood technique. I've always allowed the engine to come up to operating temps before hitting it with water as the heat helps evaporate any sitting water. Do you do the same, and if not can you explain your method otherwise? Thanks for any info you can give! AWESOME JOB ON THIS BEAUTY!!
You act like morons
Красотка!!!
I was remodeling a house Houston and right next to the house their was an abandoned house, so we went in and went to the garage and their was a Monte Carlo just sitting their but we was scared so we left and till this day is still their
This is awesome to see how the dirt goes off when you use good methods and hard labor. BUT why didn’t you clean the BRAKE DISKS?  😮 They are deeply rusted and you must probably remove a thin layer of steel to get them in to good condition.
This is Forza horizon in real Life?
How much cash you want for that car let me know if you want to sale to me please
I have no doubt that this thing is worth around 100K in that condition...
I remember when Mazda made cool cars ….
Kamikoto is a scam company. Maybe think twice about mindlessly greeding for sponsorships.
satisfying af
How much is this particular vehicle worth roughly?
This is my dream car! So upset I can never probably get one 😢  Awesome Video!
Hard to watch with ads every 2 min… highly recommend to use an ad blocker to watch.
Nice Video! Also with this faubolous car ! Why do you clean the tire that intense? They are already 20 years old.
Haws that car naw
$100,000
I bought a mostly stock 93’ red Rx7 with the Rx7 Mazda badges on it. Was so sick. Absolutely loved it. If I was a bit older at the time and didn’t need the cash I’d probably still have it. I had a lot of fun driving it in Southern California mountains and it just felt like you’re in a very fast go cart and just eats corners. I was gonna keep it and go piston in it but at that point I was getting married and decided to keep motorcycles as the hobby. Still I would own one again.
Good work 👍
Car manufacturers need to go back to these 90s body styles they are so beautiful
are you sure you read every comment?
200k restored to mint.
Who buys a car and then just parks it??
Be careful with Kamikoto, they're a Chinese brand based in Hong Kong and part of the DealDash/established titles group of companies. Dodgy stuff going on...
Fake, " I was so scared I put it away" mice always munch on wire and anything that has some type of adhesive.
In this shape, has to be a $100k car..
clean car... OEM looks way better then any kid ricer dropped toed in wheeled shit car
That car was a funeral home for some mice, hilarious. I can imagine a mother mouse saying to her son, "son go pay respect to your late great grandma (mice breed fast so that's 2 years ago) in that RX-7", 😆. Great find🤙
Goes 148, gets scared. Lol
how does the insulation not mold underneath the carpet after you soaked it??
wat date on this tires..??
You really make it new sir. 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
You did a really good job sir ..do you think the owner is selling it🇭🇹🇭🇹🙏🏾🙏🏾
But where did the mice get the insulation from?  Somewhere under the carpet or behind the dash, there are numerous mice tunnels and droppings...
Can’t wait for a sad boy to cut it’s fenders, put broken heart stickers on it and replace the steering wheel with an aftermarket one
I like the knives, and that’s about it.
What’s the name of the song playing at 23:47
Amazing.. thanks for bringing this gem back to life. 🙏🏻
What was the car next to it in the barn?
What about the brakes tho 😕
Cool
Awesome job
owner disrespected this car 😭
That leftover fuel and oil must be so gelled up in there that it would need a good cleaning service.
100,000
God Bless too You Guys The Shop And All You’re Friends Stay Safe Stay Strong 💪🏻 Keep Pushing
How much you get the car For I Would Buy It Off You Guys That’s A Nice Car I wish I was that Lucky Too Find it
really want to see the eyes of this car to open up. like a waken-up beauty after such a long sleep
You earned my Subscription. Anyone know or have a guess how much this FD, in this condition would now go for at Barrett Jackson? Any theyve Auctioned off this year or last, are probably not in as good condition, with low miles, as this one is.
Great video! You completely changed the appearance of the car. This was always my favorite car growing up playing Need For Speed. Please message me or send me some sort of contact info. I’m interested in purchasing the car if it’s available for sale!
Love these cars
I wouldn’t trust driving on those 23 yr old tires lol . Pirelli or not😅.   What a gem of a find . Where do you look to find these hidden treasures ? I’m jealous
The thing i dislike is the exhuast and twin turbos, PUT A BIG AHH TURBO AND STRAIGHT PIPE THE THING
thanks for the end results
Kamikoto is a Scam Company, a quick google search shows that they are made in china with very bad steel
I enjoyed this video so much. It overpassed my expectations
Wow. Incredible work.
Los discos de frenos oxidados😏
Lucky owner I envy 😮
Had a service call to fix an electrical issue in a detached garage, found a 98 Supra in there, been sitting for 19 yrs, elderly lady sold it to me for $1k ... It was her husbands car but he passed away 19 yrs ago and she parked the car and just left it there, no kids ....  30k miles, 6 speed manual, targe top, quicksilver ...
looks great!  until the apex seals blow in the engine
A diamond in the ruff
Amazing job. I wish you lived in the southeast UK!
Lindo trabalho de restauração e limpeza, vocês estão de parabéns...
😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵
20k
Nice video🎥🎥🎥 👍👍👍👍
This is a very beautiful & rare Mazda RX-7 with the R1 package. A well-sorted sample with very low miles such as this is rare & absolutely valuable.   Great job of the detailing work!
Got scared of the car and parked it. Bro wtf
if I had that car I would call it the black beauty
23 years ago,um yeah I believe only rich people could buy RX7 in those days.
this is great.  thanks for posting this.  dang, love asian cars to this day
Who the hell abandons a gem like this in a garage for 20 years
Awesome work👍👍👍
Perfect job,amaizing💪🔥
No Shot
What happen,to the mazda,rx7 that Was next to it,the baby blue one,?
will go for 50k on BAT.
There's a reason that piece of shit was left. The owner probably realized he was tired of being gay and left the crap behind. When your balls drop and you're no longer a beta male bit*h then you'll be ready for a V8. But until then have fun with your transgender car.
Any videos on this car on the road or it's mechanical condition?
The dash needs to be dismantled and cleaned the rats ran all threw it half fast work
Thank you for doing this. It really warms my heart because this could have been sold off or auctioned for a decent amount of money instead of getting this kind of love. And maybe because you do this for free, legends like this receive this kind of transformation.
Men I was eating and the first two minutes grossed me out 🤢
you should have bought both
brake discs??????????????????????????/
It needs new shocks and wheel bearings and the rubber bushings need to be fixed or restored or replaced. Also i would really check the head gasket. All of the rubber is probably destroyed if he did not strart the car a few times a year and let it get hot
This is worth 100k plus you need to hold on to it and also yoh need to do a carpet out detailing job.
Certainly a Time Capsule!!!
на мойке самообслуживания за 2$ так же мою))
I would pay more then 80.000 USD. 81 with a dead mouse chained to a nice trinket so I could place than in the rearview mirror! 🤣
70gs?
Nice, hydrolocked the engine.
Dat brakes, let them work for 1 mile, self-clean from rust before last shots )
The other car in the garage watt is it ?
amazing!!!
Was there any dry rot in the tires? They look pretty good while being cleaned, but they have sat for a really long time.
Es falso , ningún auto después de 23 años de abandono se verá así . Usan químicos para corrocion y óxido y que se vean así y llenan de basuras el interior para que parezca que han sido abandonados. Nadie en su sano juicio se traga tremenda porquería
I want this car so bad
What sort of brush did you use to scrub the rims with when you were cleaning them?
That would be a find. The only Mazda I ever really dreamed of owning as a kid.
Clean FD's are going for about £25,000 in the uk
This tires need to be replaced, not washed. They're junk! They may look new but like anything else, they have an expiration date. 10 years or older need to be replaced. (Retired tire tech of 30+ years)
RX7 nice
Anyone gunna talk about a stock rx7 going 140mph? In the 90’s?
it's worth from 85k to 100k not less then that with such  low mileage + it's jdm car + was featured in the fast and the furious
He took it to 140 miles and got scared and put it away. How about you keep it at speed limit and drive the thing. People are genuinely dumb sometimes.
I didn't know this was in north east Ohio I'll try to get my moms VW bus running and take it to you
It needs to be in a museum
I can remember in the 80s a lot of people had rx7s they were like the cheapest car you could buy ..about $6,000 new
Father Above what a HOLY GRAIL of a find!!! 9000 miles??? STOCK TOO?!?!? $80K MINIMUM
Русскому народу большой привет ✊✊✊из Германии,  Дальше можешь не листать вниз, там все равно нет на русском комментарии
need for speed car ! thanks for your videos
Only thing that would be concerning is dry rot on tires
Wonderful job...
YOU DO IT FOR FREE!!! WHAAAAAAT
oh hell nah
not the twin turbo version  😞
3:20 song author and title anybody? :(
O dam, "FAKE", its not possible to detail that good. Good job.
waTCHING WHILE EATING
Probably one of the most expensive RK7 on planet...
Esse carro tinha q ir pra um museu tá muito novo 👏🏁
Why didnt he sell the car ? or drive it more to get used to it ? how can someone abandon a car because they got scared for pushing the gas...
Only things missing ;  some 24”s and hydraulics . Oh, and a golden  chain steering wheel.😂
Looked like the plates said Lorain Ohio. If so that’s right down the street from me 😬
Why is their faces blured?
Funny thinking a modern Japanese sports car as a “Barn Find”
Spitzer Auto dealership is located in Monroeville outside of Pittsburgh PA
Is that rx7 for sale
Wow amazing barn find man I wish I could find a Mazda rx7 I had 3 of them when I was young and then found one sitting up in the back roads sitting for 4 years bought the car for a great price with only one owner and 50 thousand miles car was perfect but had to sell it do to everything that is going on in this world this is my dream car I did fing another one I left a note to the owners but no response but anyways great find
what a beautiful find …. true honor to the car
I’d say this car would be worth 50k after restoration with that 8829 miles
The all black 90s rx7 is my favorite car. I can't get close to affording one, but it's a lot of fun to look. I do have a c3 corvette stingray that runs great. It could use a detail, but I'm in NC. A long trek from Ohio. Yall do some very good work.
How can someone leave a legendary car rooting like this? I can't understand North Americans JDM needs love 🥲
Easily can sell it for 20k
Schönes Video, auch mit der Musik. Total befriedigend und entspannend :)  Super wieviel Zeit und Liebe da reingesteckt wird…. Super Ergebnis :)
this is like 55k or so
Where did you find this rx7? That dealership label "Spitzer" is from where I live in Brookville, PA. Think the dealership is in Dubois, PA.
You guys did a great job with every single touch. Car looks beautiful after the Detainling.
It’s not worth anything, pay to take it to a big auction like Barrett Jackson or something of similar statue.  If advertised correctly, I would assume on a bad day the car would bring 40 / 50k+
Great vid! But half an hour of that music is way too much 😂
I believe an rx7 in that condition is probably worth 80'000 to 100'000 dollars by today market for rx7 supra or skylines rx7 are quite rare now
I love this job 👌 make me feel well ,i hobe in the future find a job like yours 🌹
80'000 dollars
In Australia these cars are really rare now. In good condition this will get $100,000-$150,000.
Please say your keeping it
FB! THERE IS AN FB!
Is this thing for sale anywhere?
😮shit better then new 👏🏽
Could You Detail My Aw11 X^) Sadly I am no where near you guys
🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷💪💪💪💪💪
Anazing job! Gongrats!
RX-7 FD is the most beautiful car in my opinion. For the first time I saw this car in the movie The Fast and the Furious (2001). But fell in love during the passage of the game NFS : Carbon (2006) Love this car. My dream
This is crazy good OMG!!! 💛💛💛💛
You lucky duck 🦆 great find
Somewhere in northeast Ohio I would think. With that spitzer dealership emblem
Just a heads-up, Kamikoto (the sponsor of this video) has been exposed for being related to a company that does some real shady stuff, you can watch Scott Shafer video for more information... Loved the video btw :)
I would've taken out the whole interior to clean and disinfect. I would have also taken out the heater box, taking it apart to see if mice went in there and disinfect it also, I wouldn't want to breath in any of that
in the last 2 years the cheapest went for $21,250 and the most expensive one went for $105,000 with 5k on the clock on bring a trailer so with 8k on it i would say $90-100k
Dom Torreto would be proud😊
Don't take Japanese cars abroad, Japanese people are troubled.  Don't steal Japan's history.  Thanks for fixing it though.
$5 after you guys went and pressure washed the engine bay 😂
Parece que saiu da fábrica agora.Parabens pelo trabalho.
What a stupid reason to not drive your brand new car ever and let it sit for 23 years. If you are scared then sell it or maybe drive slower next time.
This is like the holy grail for every 90s car guy
poor car, all these years abandoned. We can consider an charity act what you have done!
the knife ad is a scam. interestingly. i just saw a video exposing them. then i got your video in recomended. and surprise. you actually talk about the exact knives. interesting how the algorithm works. cool video tho about the rx7
Is it safe to wash under the hood area where all the battery etc is? Won't it spoil anything? As there are wires
And then ? What happened to the car 🚗?
Where all the dirty water is going?
You guys are awesome, beautiful job
Esse é o comentário em português que vc estava procurando 🇧🇷 🇧🇷
Wash = restoration?
STICKERSSSS😢❤
That car almost got the owner killed doing that speed. Why the car got retired.
This isn't a barn find it's a garage find.
Where are the rolling shorts ?? 🥲
The coins 😭 12:25
Change rims paint white plsss😅 also paint rims black c:
Is anyone going to talk about the clean 1st Gen FB RX-7 next to it? I bought my FD RX-7 with only 48000 miles right before the Covid price hikes. Thank goodness but this RX-7 is potentially worth $150,000 plus with those miles depending on the rest of the condition of the car, including interior, engine, electrical. These cars are meant to be driven and can actually wear faster if they just sit for years like this. Trust me I've owned 3 FDs.
fake!
but its rotary
Wow nice job bro😍😍👏👏👏
40k
omg one of my dream cars
worth about 40-50k.
the way you washed that engine bay ....i had a heart attack ,please go over it with detailing brush and clothes  never high pressure water
🖤🖤🖤
Shes an absolute beauty and you guys did an excellent job making her shine like she deserves :) Just those rusty breaks lol. Leave that to the mechanics of course.
Mais elle démarre du coup ?
Absolute dream car!
Those mouse under hood got scared by 13b sign on the engine block . Love rotary❤
How on earth do you get this barn find to begin with😅
10/10
Amazing video it was a great experience! <3 greets from germany
Master !!!! Nice Job !!!!
i just cant watch this. seeing other people just stumble upon their dreams is pretty depressing tbh
90s Japanese cars are going up in value since the then kids growing up drooling over them want their dream cars of then. I really think this car can sell over 100k since the the paper work is still there plus the low mileage.
I always detail cars I buy before I ever get them running…😒
it’s like a perfectly preserved fossil! such a beautiful car😍
I love the car and awesome transformation the only thing is to watch out for the alternator do not get it wet.
23 years in complete neglect, I was surprised at how well it remained in good condition. 8800mile.....14162kilo I wanted the next owner to enjoy this car even more.
pressure washing the engine bay, yeah. what could possibly go wrong .
How are you not going to show the owners reaction???
You see there’s no one who GIVE A FUCK
If I found this car in a garage, I would take good care of it. I’d clean every inch of it and do small mods like an exhaust, intake, rims, coilovers, and ofc the classic rx7 little wing. When I think of an RX7, I think of the wing it comes with factory.
Knife guys watching the Kamikoto sponsorship must be cringing their asses off.
Omg look how good the paint is
What a pussy....the car scared him 😤😤😤 I hate people
Boys.i really need help with my car...i want my 2008 lexus rx350 to look and be as aggressive as possible . But ive been a few places and the garages act like im talking foreign or they are just to scared and dont.know what to do ????
The 1990s were awesome👌
ここまで動かしてなかったらそれはそれでヤバそう
I don't really consider two passes polishing a long time, but it looks nice.
I want this car you lucky .....
I'm moist now
it would not hurt to iron the brake discs
Why do you waste so much water in a stupid car?
Vin diesel needs this car
BEAUTIFUL
Did you guys also take the FB? Would love to see a detailing on one of those too
Fake. Not a chance a twenty something finds this in a barn and can afford buying it. Hate to be a hater but I call BS.
for the miles it has id have to say between 50,00-65,000
Hi is this for sale.thanks
В Мазде даже крысы дохнут
I'm trying to figure out how a grown man drives a car 140 and gets scared enough to park it for decades....
You lost me when you sprayed on the alternator/battery  🤦🏻‍♂️
"First wash in 23 years" 😒
Hello mate im new here and can you give me about your garage floor please
Please don’t ever show the final product, like you did in the ad, before the car is actually finished. It’s very annoying and unnecessary.
Should get the owners reaction too
How were the tires not dry rotted after 20 years.?
You can easily resell it for $30K+ after proper repair, cleanup and detailing
Kamikoto is shit, google it yourself, you better focus on what you are doing other than giving a wrong idea of what people getting
Always a barn find  😴😴😴
You would have to full gut that interior, ozone works but is very destructive to interiors... There will ALWAYS be a slight smell of mouse pee on a warm day... Mouse pee is also very corrosive. A little sad, but Great car though.
How much did you pay
That low mileage, USDM FD RX7, I fully believe with only 8,800 mi fully tuned up and back and working order, there's no reason that car wouldn't get $60,000 easy
I am thinking a car sitting in garage around 30 years how it can fire up again?🤔
Wouldn't  you need to get new rubber if it has been actually sitting for that long.  Don't now how long i'd trust those tires.
Buys a new car, gets scared of it. Never uses it again. Idiot
How long would it take to dry if you steam clean your drivers seat?
amaizingggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg !!!! tomorrow I will wash my car you inspire me!!!
Start the bidding at 100k lol s2k cr with low miles went for 100k to 200k
I don’t normally watch these videos all the way, but, I watch this one all the way. Beautifully restored!
Wow ❤❤❤
Nice car bro 😊👍
Minimum 50 grand for that car and the sky is the limit in an auction setting.
First shampoo the car and only after that wash it with water 🚿. Why do you call yourself detailers if you even don’t know such things? Why do you scratch the car by washing with a sponge after first shampooing?   1. Shampoo > wash 2. Shampoo > 🧽 sponge > wash 🚿   Only that way can save your car from scratches after wash.  (Of course, you polish the car in the end, but you should wash car in the right order.)  Sorry for my English
I don't understand why they only show the aesthetic improvements they make to the car without showing anything necessary to guarantee that the mechanics are in good condition: filters, oil, the fuel in the tank should be in poor condition... gearbox oil. .. etc...
how much for this beast?..im interested 🤘😎
What was really cool was the Gen 1 RX-7 sitting right next to it when they opened the garage. Detail that one too!
Spitzer that must be Ohio
This is awesome
Free detailing you say?
Priceless, find another one like this i dare you.
So elephant in the room, does it run?  Coolant seals are likely shot and who knows what else...take it to IR Performance, the only rotary engine builder I trust.  I owned an FD for 18 years and know every part on the car
Great job with the detail work!!! I would suggest to the owner to do a ice blasting to clean the undercarriage of the car to make it more valuable and also with the beautiful detail work the brake rotors should be replaced would make the car look way better
Is it ok to let some water under the hood like that? I’m just curious.
Dude couldn’t have taken 10 mins to toss a tarp or something over it 😂😂😂😂
Easily get 80k out of it to the right buyer....
Does anyone know what kind of steam cleaner they're using?  I'm trying to find a good/reliable one, but always get mixed reviews on any of them.
Amazing!  Mechanically, we’re there many issues with it sitting for years?  Fuel issues etc?
That car is worth a lot of money to a stock car collector that’s extremely rare to find a car that old in complete stock condition with almost no damage
I got a S197 in Ohio that could use a bit of love🤷🏼🤣
Dream car (after the wash!)
Nice clean up/ detail! Not restoration! I think someone is very confused!!🤔
Nfs prostreet intro Black RX7! 😍🚗🔥
Wow, what a unicorn.
I won nfsmw driving that car
$45,000
This is not my cup of tea, in fact I could not give a shit about an RX7, but the car guy in me can appreciate the rarity and desirability of these cars. The way this car, this time capsule is so well preserved and watching you guys wash away years of dust and grime is super satisfying! What a fun job, I would seriously enjoy doing jobs like this
Ah Yes, my underground days.
No one seeing the 1gen sitting on the right? 79-85 I believe.
Owners reaction is missing!!!
Even without makeup, she looks good
Hello guys.  I have a MR2-93 please help me out. I want  my car to look stunning for my son's high-school
So do you just clean it and give it back then? Because two things are gonna happen, 1. They sell it instantly or 2. They immediately start neglecting it again. The kind of people that leave nice cars to die in garages are they same people that let someone clean it for free to then continue to let it rot away.
Original owner was clearly a slob
Best Rx7 I have uploaded many videos on YouTube
Love to see the transformation! especially nice cuz I'm in NE ohio myself. Spitzer Chevy is right down the road. Hope to see some more local diamonds in the rough on this channel!
i wish my neighbour down the street had a stock rx7 for me to detail
I hate rats they ruin beautiful cars
That’s my dream car
Rob Dahm would cream his pants over this car.
Ain't even see in the back https://youtu.be/TtbHe3GCD5Q
Damn how long did all that take ?
70k for that car EZ
This video just hits different . Very very stimulating
Your vacuum really does suck
How much would this type of detailing even cost
To detail a car on the lift would be so nice.  Having something cool to wash, that's pretty fresh... even better!  That commercial jacked up the reveal.  Just saying
Do y’all want to detail my R33 GTR?
What the fxx https://youtu.be/e8RCwnjqgwc
Man i wish I could find a detailer like that.
$30k max
those are pack rats dude, pack rats....I'm dealing with them right now. They got into one of my cars...just parked it for a few days and they made it their home! Great job on the car!
Wow, that car looks like it was in the showroom YESTERDAY!  I just can’t imagine why someone would buy a car like that then leave it in a barn???
I'll give you 5K for that beast right now. COLD HARD CASH.
OMG!! Love this!!! 99% perfect! I would’ve brake it a little bit to get rid of the rotors rust 🤓
So beautiful 😍
I love watching your video but i cant afford
I need my 2017audis3 done
Man that crazy story  about how rx7 came to be in that shape.  Wonderful transformation. This is my dream car and color I would want. They indeed are very rare now. I wish I found  it I'd love to own a fd rx7.u guys did great job  and wondered if it going for sale
What do clean you clean the inside windshield with? i always get streaks.
nice clean my car
Never seen a tire can last 23 years
I hope the tires were replaced after that long.
You guys have done an outstanding job. Your attention to the details was amazing and the final polishing is beautiful.
What a find. very nice car.
A bit dissapointing that you guys don't pop up the headlights in this entire video.
Man take that glove box out
😭😭😭😭😭
😭😭😭😭😭
Makes me miss my '94 FD :'( I remember buying it at California and driving it to South Florida with a buddy of mine with his Rx-8. To me it was worth driving the car and appreciate the attention and detail you all did with this beautiful car. Sadly, I had an accident with mine and just couldn't afford to repair it which I then had to make the decision to sell it. So this definitely touches me in the heart differently so thanks guys 😎
F A K E
Why does this fell like a fake 'barn find'?
Hard to think same tires rides fine no flat spots..😮😅 still nice car
12,500 because you aren't greedy . . . . . . . . . . . . ..................
I’m sorry.  I had to.   I’m sure you have said it yourself during editing.   Great work on that thing.
I'd pay 100k for that. I don't have it. But if I did, I would.
lol the rotors ruin the look
So do you know why this was neglected? Was the owner still alive or were the house and cars just forgotten?
Nothing more satisfying that a good knob polishing!  😂
I found a 1987 Nissan Sentra in a barn with 1000 miles on it.  No one cared there either.
work of art🫡
You left the battery connected and the alternator uncovered while doing the engine? Do you have electronics or something?
FD prices are crazy rn, I'm betting this will pitch at least 70k
Probably a good thing he parked it.....didnt look he takes very good care of his vehicles.
65.676$
All I can say is wow….fantastic job
Wondering if you could share your process on how you successfully locate a barn find of this caliber? Appreciate the amazing content!
All this is fake. To get views
Man... I'm so jealous 🥺😭
I am so jealous he found a rx-7 😂 that’s my dream car
If I found this I would literally die on the spot
Good stuff other than the chrome socket on an impact gun. Sorry pet peeve.
Soooo random to see a high end knife company doing ads on a car detailing channel…
i would say worth arround 20k in that condition. I mean it was sitting 20 years, so everything has to come new anyway.
my absolute favorite car. you guys did an amazing job!!
It's not just the attention to detail that makes me happy, it's the dedication to do so. When you said you do it for free I was blown away. That's passion.
Made it look like it came out of the factory.
Hmmm...I'd love to be able to buy brand-new cars and then just shove them in a corner for decades and forget about them.
For Sale: FD RX7 with 8800 original miles. Not driven in 23 yrs. Needs motor. 😆
If someone realy know about rats and cars clearly understand what is fake.
Thats always been one of my dream cars. In Forza, Grand Turismo and Need for Speed games this is always one of the first i build. Awesome work.
A 1 detailing top notch
This will bring 90k to 110k! A intergalactic type r went for 180k and a Evo 9 went for the same amount so!
@WDDetailing How long did it take you to do the whole car from start to finish?
how bout that first gen, what's the story on it? did these go to sale?
Nice job. I like the rx7 better than the rx8. One thing I can't stand though is rusty rotors behind clean wheels. Next time you should use iron remover and a brown scouring pad to remove that rust. It'll make a huge difference. As you know it's all about the little details.
A legend,a Japanese beast back to life.
Contact Rob Dahm now. He might need another 4 rotor RX7 build car 😂
How can I buy this car.   Now
That is worth a few bucks sweet !
I never knew spitzer sold rx7s😭
Thank god you took that dealer sticker off....that shit drives me NUTS. I am so glad the one I work at doesn't do that.
Hello guys it’s my car sorry it’s not for sale going to Japan we have a  museum
Cut that "thank you" bullshit ffs
Great video…just subscribed…
Why are you cleaning 23 year old tyres?
how rich do you have to be to buy a brand new car, drive it as fast as you can, get scared of it and store it on your garage for the rest of your life and forget about it?
Wow beautiful restoration!
Only in Ohio bro💀💀💀
GREAT work!!
Wow !!!
What a original beut
Cool.. I'd sell it as fast as I can..
8000 miles and that dirty on the inside hmmmm
Very Cool Car
it is not good to keep those old hard tires very unsafe
$120k easy.
Only thing I can say is incredible job 😍 what a gem! Keep it up guys
7/23/22 5k-Mile 1993 Mazda RX-7 5-Speed sold on BAT for $105k
Tommyfyeah will buy this car hit him up 👍
What a satisfying video. I'm glad someone rescued that car, it's a shame for it to sit and be a mouse nest.
Probably have to pay someone to take it so I’ll take it off ur hands for free no need to thank me
What is the owner of the car gonna do with it?  Why did he after so many years decided to get it showroom ready?  How much would this car go for?  A really really beautiful car!
What is the actual year model? This car deserves a ceramic coating.
шикарная получилась тачка!!!
I hope it goes to someone good
Does anyone know what spray he using to clean with the detail brush?
Damm . nice work my dream car <3
Excelente trabajo!!!!
Wait I live in  Fairmount Indiana. Would u be willing to do a 2016 ATSV Coupe Vector Blue 1of 106  or a 2012 Buick Regal GS both are on my Ig or YT page videos. Let me know. Links are in the About section of the YT. 100% interested when I heard you guys were in Ohio I don't care that you're probably on the other side that's fine.
Old tires can be deadly.
there is rat shit below the carpets
Are y’all going to clean the blue fb as well?
Wonder how bad the mice infestation was in the Savanna next to it
RX-7 is a piece of shit. Sorry but it is a fact.
made that shine like a star wow awesome car and awesome job
I love watching all your videos ❤
my mouth dropped when you said you guys do this for FREE. mad respect
“He drove 140mph on the freeway and got scared of the car.”…..so don’t go that fast?
Coming back to watch it again, a thing of beauty 🙏🏻
Wow this was amazing!
Oh, an Ohio car.
I like the first gen in the garage as much or more.
Absolutely incredible. Hopefully he picks it up at the shop. So he can see it incredibly clean.
He got scared of the car, what a little beta bitch
WOW! are you serious!
I really enjoyed watching this cartoon video😍👏
the tyres and brake discs should be replaced
I cant imagine how many more rare cars are out there just sitting in garages and barns....forgotten, waiting to be driven again :(
What kind of lift do you use
Congratulations on your gem find guys!!! Like wow!
The opportunity to breathe new life into a car is incredible. My grandparents have a 1980's Toyota Supra in their backyard ive been wanting to restore all my life. I just haven't got the utility's or money to do it. Seems like a great experience, love the videos! Subbed.
I bet you won’t read this comment
Отличная работа!
They are the best cars ever 1970s  even better
What about the older one that was beside it ?
Oef...
I think it will be around 300k
mn
23 years and tires are no problem 👌
Bad engines
Did I hear phonk music?
What a treasure, why would you leave this beauty neglected in a barn for over 20 years!?!?!? Glad you were able to restore her original glory, great job!!!!
You dodged a HUUUUGE bullet with all that mice infestation and the wires left intact.
great find out of the Cleveland area
Easily about 100k
Are we just ignoring the fact there's an awesome rx7 FB in garage too 😲
I am not a jealous person BUT IM JEALOUS AF
First thing I would do is pull the dash/seats/carpet off and start checking the wiring.
gonna hit u up to do my miata
Power washing the battery, fuse box, and other electrical kinda ruined it for me, did it turn out okay?
Really Nice! Where are you guys?  Ca I hope!
❤
Please tell me that first gen rx7 sitting next too the car in the garage will have its own restoration video !!
Imagine if its 2040 and you found a RX-7
i want to buy it..
Wow that a gem what a beautiful car Rx7 history 🙌 you guys nail the work just incredible work what a lucky owner keep up the great works guys thanks for the video
i’ll give you $3000 it’s not worth anything trust me
the mice only went in to admire the car
What about the other rx7 that was in the garage??
I'd say, $50-60k easy
The original MSRP was $34,000. The current high retail is $43,200
Absolutely stunning work
I think a mazda rx7 that age and miles would be worth around 60 thousand dollars
kind of odd the tires werent dry rotted / flat?
This is a gem of an FD3S. Would fetch a pretty penny on BAT.
dude is sitting on a gold mine with this car.  I'd never sell it though if I were him
I bet that RX-7 could beat any car on Mount Akina downhill. Well except a panda Trueno.
Super duper rare to find a stock rx7 especially in this condition
Why do people always wash the outside first
adam Lz might buy 😂
Great work & video guys!  Was there a final reveal to owner, and did you find our final value?  Also would be cool to know what products you are using on each step.  Thanks for posting!
The price on the vehicle was $33,000.00 in 1993
Was this found in Pittsburgh?
Such bullshit.  These barn finds are so ridiculous
I'm not a mazda fanboy, but shiad i can appreciate a rare car like that as a daily .. that car is history.. feels good driving a car that made history..
This car is surreal cool. Dream car
What a gorgeous car. Best lines ever
I really hope you paid that man the worth that that vehicle costs now. Man I really hope….
70k easy even on a bad it's incredibly rare to find one that's not modded out or low miles anymore
This is a minimum $70k car! Absolute perfection
You've gotta ditch Kamikoto as a sponsor. Same for Established Titles if you guys use them as well. Same company. Do a little research, they're shady AF.
Fancy a farmer leaving a valuable item unloved and not used or sold if it was too much for him. The farms around here use everything til it collapses then still have it mended.. There are farmers aplenty here with 1949 tractors still working....as well as modern ones of course.  Happy days love from Wales UK.  Loved the finish and your hard work...
looks great..do you ever try to remove rust and polish on brake disk?
Perfection 🥲
Nice!!
it worth alpt please donot modify it just keep it as it is All original 🔥
Cars like this have no value to me, I like off road vehicles
What did he do with the car after?
just perfect! 👌
That is one sexeh somomabeesh!
These cars were fast and great handlers in there day. They were a favorite for Autocrossing
I wanted to hear the rotary run
Very nice! I would like to know if there were mice and nesting in the air filter box!
But what about that blue RX-7 right next to it?? Isn’t that an ‘84?
no engine start no like, great video to
This is super neat. I initially saw the opening clip on IG, and recognized the dealer badge as soon as the garage door opened. I live like 30 minutes from a few of their dealers.
Would love to see a 1 minute clip at the end of these of revealing the car to the owner.
So funny seeing 50-60k estimates this is 100k + easily
Bullshit…
I can see drift gangs crying for this RX-7 with only 8800 original miles
All original, unmolested, under 10k miles, and a hero car... In todays market I 'd guess around $100,000 give or take 20 grand. To the right buyer maybe more, the car market is the wild west currently.
Boomers are weird.   “Yeah I went 140mph one time and I just decided to keep the payments and leave it in my garage.”   MIND BLOWING.
I have to truly ask how in the world did you find this car?!?!??
Man... That car came out amazing! Nothing more amazing to a car guy is the tape line corrections!
Every RX7 has been completely violated and molested. Keep this one as original as possible
this is worth 130k and park it
That's awesome, beautiful job guys. I'd love to have that garage floor in my shop.
This was sold somewhere in my area. The spritzer Chevrolet tag and the Ohio plate proves it. I'd give you $20k as it sits right now, no questions asked. How you guys came upon this in my area is baffling to me. I've got my finger on the pulse of the car sales in this area and never once came across this ad.
Good job! This car is my dream! Hi from Russia :)
I'll give you £500 for it
Is it APC used to clean car interior ?
Nice work! Thanks for sharing
But the one that you found would sell for 67 grand
I meant to say it will be worth a lot
My dad has won an RX seven turbo he is selling it for 100 grand we got it for 87So if you clean it it won’t be worth a lot
Crazy how mice can get into a car, but can’t find their way out lol
How much does a service like this usually cost? Incredible attention to detail.
didn't used 2 bucket method ?
I just saw one of these RX7's (blue one) in my town in England very rare site and then I see this video in my feed, its a beautiful car was thinking its worth 150k $$
Man that’s an awesome find that is my dream car maybe one day I can find another one in the same condition
tanto brillo y lo más importante los discos de freno? todo oxidado 😵‍💫😅🤦🏻‍♂️
Wanted to see it start up and driven:(
Does it run? Mechanically ok?
When you said northeast Ohio I bout blew a gasket, I thought you were like across America from me, not my flippin neighbors. If I find any carls like that I’ll send you an e-mail
Bro u are so lucky 🥺 we can't have these in india 😢
Wow
Whoever buys this please PLEASE keep it as is! 😍
Found a drug runner eh? Sweet ride.  You changed the tires out right? Even new tires are no good after 15 years.
Nice video. But if you add the owner reacion on the end... hope next time... wish all goods. bye
Put it on the Auction Block Sale in California and you’ll get more than your moneys worth. The car is fully original, nothing but wiring and glove box , the rest is in tack and untouched.. your looking at a one of a kind from the late 90’s..❤😮
Priceless.
Какой же красивый автомобиль, прям нраица
Monumental work!
Komikoto is a scam just like Established Titles, they are owned by the same people.
can you guys give it to me as a gift 😅 that's my dream car sense i was 13 years old
50-75 grand easy
What a cool car to buy!
за 23 года даже ржавчины нет, странно......
こんな極上車見つけたら掃除も楽しいだろうなあ
This car sholud be in a museum or something...
Now give it a quad turbo
How much is this car worth? I’m curious🙆🏽‍♂️
It hurts my ocd that you guys didnt have the rotors machined or just drive it for a bit to clear up that disk corrosion 😭  Other than that absolute phenomenal job on a worthy car! Rotaty engines are dismissed so often and they shouldnt be. They may sound like a lawnmower at 10,000 rpm but they are putting in the work 😁
Hey man, awesome detailing....just had one question...does pressure washing (with just water) remove all the dirt, or do we have to use soap even at home? Am just asking on daily use basis.
Was waiting for brap-brap-brap whole video and there were none, sad. Nice job though.
🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
keisuke takahashi would be proud.....curious what is that floor made out of to my eye it looks like a regular carpet but i cant imagine you'd be doing that on a carpet lol
Only in Ohio
its really like a brand new rx7. i wonder how mice built a nest inside glove box. maybe from AC system, you guys doesn't check inside the dash?
Only thing I don't like is that your didn't polish up or clean the rotors
i shudder to think about a rotary motor that’s been sitting for a decade 😨
改造もせずに純正で乗って欲しいな
シャッターが上がった瞬間2台のお宝！
Like to see the mechanical resto of it too ie brakes, lubes etc then see it get driven, those rusty rotors grate me 😂
Those can’t be the original tires. If it sat there for years and years those tires would be cracked, rotted, flat and not usable
Absolutely amazing video didn’t slip a second keep up the good work
Wow, after so many years the engine hasn't seized up.
How do you get scared of a car!? Just don't go fast.
The biggest issue I'm seeing regarding the front part of the undercarriage is ... just kidding I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
Spoiler alert: it’s on it’s third engine.
imagine driving a car, taking it to its limits, then being so scared of it you don't drive it for 22 years lol. i dont buy it.
Lol but why is everyone ignoring the fact that he drove it 140 and left it in the garage since 99??? And they found ammunition in the car??? 😂 Ok.
I’d say it’ll hit between $100k and $125k, a 17k mile one sold just shy of $90k recently  I don’t have that much money but I’ll cut you a deal: $442.57 and whatever is in my savings account and I’ll work for you for minimum wage :D
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thank you,Thank you foreign, foreign.
I would love to buy this car. You guys are amazing retailers. On a pro level.
All time favorite car since I was a kid I’m glad y’all brought it back to life👍
No offense towards the person that the car scared. But what did he expect from a Mazda rx7 spider. Those cars are extremely well made. The rotary engine is a beast no matter what year it was built. I owned a 85 with a three rotar. And a 85 zr1 Corvette. I wouldn't dream of putting the Vette against the rx7. It's supposed to scare you. This way you respect it's ridiculous power. But great job on the detail.
20лет назад не было коврик
People need to stop accepting sponsors from Kamikoto, their a scam reseller selling fake blades from china. Do 5 minutes actually researching your sponsor before accepting it and shilling out their fake shit.
Looks great all cleaned up and the engine and undercarriage didn't look bad at all.  Only thing I'd be worried about is the engine with it sitting for so long.  Especially with it being a rotary.
It’s worth a lot I mean I think 50k but at least 30-40k
confused on why y'all cleaned the wheels and then went to hose off the car, and can't say i didn't cringe when you took off the wing and then blasted water through the trunk holes.
AMAZING... You guys did such an excellent job. It looked brand new when it was finished.
Awesome job! Looks amazing
What type of story is that bro 🤣 you purposefully go 140 then get scared and let the car sit wtf man 🤣
Crazy how much these are worth now we used to beat the shit out of these in highschool. Even turned one into a off-road junk car
Dream of every jdm lover ❤❤
1999 RX-7, 8800ish miles. Cleaned up it would be in mint condition and it's a hot tuner car. Must be around $30k
100,000
Before that awful movie fast and furious came out they were reasonably priced. Same with the Supra. That garbage movie ruined everything. I had a 92 rx7 and it drove like a go cart. My favorite car of all time.
Your company is a typical detailing company in that you take great care to make-up and polish only those areas real well that the customer first looks, like the center console, dashboard, hood, gearshifter surroundings and drivers seat. You claimed that electrical damage was nonexistent yet you did not take apart the door panels or actual dashboard. You didn't check the fuseboxes or multimeter the wiring harness.   Perhaps it'd be best if you'd stick to polishing rims and steering wheels and left these kind of difficult jobs to actual professionals who will inspect the whole car in addition to detailing it.
need to fix the audio. way too low in volume.
$80-$100k for that FD That’s a modern day classic I’d love to have. But I’m a sucker for a nice black jdm beauty
stop saying all the papers add value, thats just some BS you heard someone else say and its absolutely 100% false. The value of a vehicle is based on age, miles and condition NOTHING else period plain and simple.
My dream car❤️❤️❤️❤️
easy 80/95grand if not more. that car is such a piece of history and its so so sexy with its curves. one of my favs for sure. you guys did an amazing job.
That real love and passion thank you boys for bring her back to her glory now eavry one bow or take a knee
El carro de mis sueños
No hay forma con los japoneses los mejores carros y motoras
My goodness, what a f'n beauty of a time capsule. Needs some window tint & wheels & she's perfect.
Nice car
I really like how you used the same tyre brush on the barrels of the wheels. 🤪🥴😵‍💫
i would pay $25k-30k if i had the money to spend thats in great shape
That car needs to go to auction.    Btw if mice are in the glove box they’re in the dash ,
Only in Ohio bruh
So your able to wet up the engine of your car like that wiutj water and soap ??
As you said you are reading every comment i would suggest that you should chand the alloy wheels and putt new one latest typ that would in-hence the look of the car
Quick question, how old are you? 😮
Are they selling this car? What made them bring it out of mothballs?
I have one of these…. Mine is red.
I want to see that fb rx7 get restored
So wait, those tires look really good to be 23 years old. 23 years and no wore spots. Hmmmmmm, So what’s the date on the tires?
ngl this prob worth like $1,200. but ill give yall a deal and give $1,700 for the detail and care yall gave it
If the dude wasn't a puss he would have actually enjoyed his car. Now he's probably dead and never got the chance to actually rip on a badass car.
I would like to buy it... what do you guys want for it?   Thank you!
I don't consider cleaning a car a "restoration"
45k to 55k
Hermoso trabajo felicitaciones 👏🤩
Am I the only one who thinks that those 20 year old tires are no longer roadworthy? Of course, if the car is put into a museum, it is perfectly reasonable to keep the original tires. Beautiful car and great job.
Are the tires still suitable for driving after all these years?
Clean car but those original wheels need to go they are awful
So I like cars.. absolutely love them. Especially jdm, I actually happen to be watching initial d right now and keisuke’s yellow fd just got messed up so he’s driving kyokos blacked out fd. But anyway, I never realized just how much I truly love cars until I saw this video.. I can’t even describe the feeling I got when that garage door opened and I saw the amazing rear end of that black fd. Just amazing, truly art work.
Something about the rats in the glove box without any damage or way in or out makes me think this might be cap
The interior work on this car was amazing. But why not de-rust the brake discs? That's the only thing showing its age.
Thank you for saving this precious lady
Great detailing to make this beautiful again. I think you could easily get 50K for it. May I ask what product you use for the engine bay?
I'll take the car sitting next to it if nobody wants it
Sell it to me
Man... did that car just rolled off the production line?
Wow i dont care who tells you that spraying water on the engine is one of the worst things u can do to any vechicle specially a high performace. The longterm damage can not be quantified. Always clean with wlectr9nics cleaner or chema based in evap
I don't understand how you can find a beautiful example of an RX-7 like this after 23 years, and make it look better than showroom. This is beyond factory. This is perfection.
A 24 year old Northern Ohio car that isn't a rusted up pile of crap. That thing truly never left that barn.
Where is the blue one
Easily 100k.... show me another one under 10k miles....don't exist
Was stylish when pagers and Motorola flip phones were around . Never the less you could be the coolest cat in a town of 10 people
Fd goes for 60 plus k rn
Do you guys do this for regular people that want there car detail and how much would a job like this cost?
I had one in the late 90s 😢
🔥🔥
The mouse: that's my fucking house
Does it run?
9:50 he missed the bumper on the front right
i would check the framrails, especcially in the engine bay
ولا غلطه
Paint correction 180k 2002 996 cabrio in Cleveland for a Cleveland firefighter?
Looks so good I want to eat it
Awesome video, just finished watching whole thing and just wondering why you guys kept these 20+ year old tires on?    Original everything is what you want sure, but NOT with tires, that's a huge safety risk
i love toyotas :)
Unreal!
They better come back, and show that FB some love!
It’s worth more than what you guys paid the poor old man 😂
my favorite car
brand new!
Tell the owner I'll give him 50k for it.
What motor came in these stock and they were really that fast?
100k plus $
Before he drives it, he needs to do some work. New tires, fluid flushes, check bushings, etc
Great content! Quick question: Is it safe to wash the engine as shown or should we cover the electrical components like alternator and battery with plastic before spraying with water?
Bruh stop the cap that tread pattern ain’t original this ain’t no barn find
I don’t know, I’d just take a wet dry vac and vacuum the inside and then drive it through $10 car wash. Done…
Where did the mice get in from?
Well done, thank you.
What do u use to scrub is that paint brush?
What kind of psychopath purchases a legendary car and parks it away forever
amazing but im sad that is gona get not driven agian but still amazing
The late 80s Rx-7s were the ultimate high school first car for “bros” in the early to mid 90s. So much bang for her buck. You could swoop up a used one for like $3500. Throw an Alpine deck in her, an amp and a couple 10” subs and you were big pimping.
looks brand new again wow
Easily 6 figures
Il y en a qui trouve des pépites
Great video. I just started watching. It's catch-up time.
I would say this car is worth between $95,000-$110,000.
and if the owner can get it registered at Barret Jackson auction it could go for up 100k with the right crowd.
These engines are going for between 10k and 20k depending on condition/miles. I would guess the car is worth somewhere between 85k and 110k. These cars simply put, are really worth what a person is willing to pay on any given day. The exact number is difficult to say.
whenever you do beauties like this you should partner up with a good and honest mechanic shop to resurface the rotors so that there is no corrosion on those rotors after you are done detailing them. the end result will improve 10 times overall just for that small sacrifice
I love it. It just takes rocket science to detail.🤣🤣🤣🤣 What would you call this position? 🤔 Auto detail engineer? 🤣🤣🤣
Nice job guys!
my guess it would sell for 80 - 90Thousend
How many dead mice?  Deadmau5
👍👍
Is the car turbo if it is it worth lot money
I think it be like 1000 so if ur not keeping it i can take it off ur hands
I remember this car it had really similar lines to the Porsche 924 that was sold at the same time. It was called the poor man’s Porsche even though it was better in ever way over the 924. Very cool to see.
Im not really that up to date with the american market for japanese classics, but in norway i belive it would go for everything between 200-300k$, of course depending on the buyer
That thing looks like it just came off the showroom floor after you got finished. Great job guys
What solution do you use to clean the interior. Seems to foam up nicely
Well done gentlemen.
How much would this cost to get a FULL detail, like 800$?
Please listing brand for detailing?
BRO THE ALTERNATOR WHY YOU GET IT WET
I don’t think I have ever thrown my fist in the air out of frustration in my life but when I seen this I did exactly that lmao. What a beautiful FD.
Absolutly awesome. Any 90's kid dream ! Would be great to see a reaction of the owner after the cleaning process
My brother was the mazda master tech and rotory master at spitzer auto world at that time, saw the spitzer tag. He may have prepped it when newcand put never seize on the spark plugs.
I’ve owned over 30 cars including a 93 RX7, there’s nothing quite like them. A true masterpiece of engineering when sorted right
Incredible restoration amazing results guys
8000 miles? Theres some with low miles 20-30k miles that go for like $80,000. ID say one that low in miles, everything works, and its been in doors the whole time, probably like $90,000-$100,000.
Imagine buying a factory fast ass car, then being too scared of the speed of it. 🤦🏼‍♂️ Either way great find and great job!
Wow !
Friend of mine had a red one with 20" classic red rims. We called it the baby viper. It was a very good looking car.
Y’all gotta do the first gen RX7 he had in that barn next too 😅
I don't imagine there's many examples like this left out there. What an immaculate example. I'd think it would bring top dollar for an FD RX-7 at auction.
Suggestion, you should show the owner's reaction after! But nice restoration ♥️
DON’T SELL THIS CAR !!!
8800miles and it still has low compression. Do t worry they all do.
Such a shame when people like you that don’t have a clue find amazing cars like this
The love and care she deserves. Absolutely stunning work!
Tint the windows, powder coat those rims, and that car will be beautiful.
The old guy was clueless not to cover it with a dust sheet. Why didn't he just sell it off, if it scared him? A few loose screws?
i’d guess it’d go for around 100k being all original, you just never find them like this. if someone desperately wants this one i’d fully expect them to pay more all the way to some absurdly high price like 200k. fd’s are 25-30k cars when they’re p clapped out asf & i’ve never heard of one with under 50k miles for sale lol. someone with FU money will pick this up forsure
For a car that old, replace the tires, they are probably one season away from desintegrating.
Not a big fan of cleaning the engine like that which can cause electrical issues, not to mention sensors and modules.
So how many man hours was put into this clean up..
A one owner, 8,800 mile, unmolested Mazda RX-7! It was mesmerizing and a reminder about how timeless some cars are.
Was that the old guys car that opened the garage
👍🏻
Amazing transformation
Wait to sell for 5years.  100k u will get.
Gen 1 rx7 parked right next to the gen 3
Damn… you guys are really lucky
scared of it lol
i remember these cars on the first models the rear taillight had screws on the outside if you removed the screws you could remove the lens reach in and activate the trunk release...just saying...
Amazing find, loved the way it came up! End of the video you asked for feedback: - Would like to know how this car was treated mechanically? Was it then handed to engineer to assess any long term damage / restoration to the operation of the car?; - Get rid of that background music. That's brain-melt for half an hour; I ended up going on mute.
60k easily
Satisfying
It will be worth 100k easily because of the low mileage
What about the first generation Rx7 I am interested in buying if for sale..
Nice job, covering up the alternate might not be a bad idea…
this was mind blowing GREAT WORK
I just wanna know what the bitch looked like who got scared of a car… which speed you can… you know…. Control??
Love your videos. Only advice is to add chapters when you have a video this long. It benefits you in a lot of ways
😴
The car of my dreams 😍😍😍😍
My dream car from high school. But so far out of reach at the time and they've only skyrocketed in value. I probably would have wrapped it around a tree at 18.
so hope someone read the Japanese rx 7 manual and not the English sorter version.
The brake rotors were killing my ocd. I’d have to change them after that 😭😭😭😭
The only comparable cars 1 with 33k mikes and the other with 50k both sold right around $50k so that should be a good start to figure out this car’s value
Oof TommyFYeah would be harder than a diamond in an ice storm for this.
For non turbo i'd give it 60k-85k.  Turbo 100k plus.
Would love to see the owners reaction
Nice rusty clapper's
She's so beautiful 🥺❤️
whats that spray bottle youre using when you were cleaning the wheels. The one with a foamy soap
88K it is old
From Spitzer Mazda, found in Ohio by chance?
is this going for sale
This will bring 80k to 100k easily
All said and done 25 Grand
He took it to 140mph and it scared him? Couldn't he just not press the gas pedal as hard lol
Wow.. that car is in better condition than my 2018 civic si😂😂.. probably because my civic is a Minnesota car and it's prone to rust. But great work guys loving it
🤔🤔🤔.  23 years?  Not buying it. 🛑. Tires would be a dead give away. No dry rot?  Impossible. Tires not flat?  After 23 years?  Nope.  🚫🚫🚫
Every gasket and hose is probably shot. Sitting that long, they should all be replaced.
Great restoration, amazing car even though I'm a gtr guy but never less, only other thing I'd do which yall probably did but just didn't make the video would've been clean the pedals and bring the chrome shine back
Dominic's red one from the first fast and furious is just awesome. This reminds me of it.
A word from your sponsor and you have the car cleaned in the background!!!
Are you cleaning it for the owner or did you buy it?
Ooh, I want the 1st Gen model on the right!!! 😍
Owners reaction or it doesn’t count. 😂😂
You found this in Ohio?? Shoot I’m up near Cleveland myself. Got a ton of car buddies who’d think that 7 was nasssty
what is the material on the garage floor? You are spraying water and i would like to know where it all drains to please.
Será que alguém compraria um carro, que foi ninho de ratos?
This is the best way to relax.
For a low mileage rx7 and original you be looking at about $50k as the price of rx7 have gone up ten fold.
Imagine this level of work and professionalism from everyone you dealt with. The world would be perfect.
One of the rare appreciating cars, can get 50K with no problem
Great job! Sweet car! I bet someone would pay 50 for it.
It depends on serial number… lower number the better for JDM COLLECTOR…  maybe my estimate and $300,000 will be the lowest price for bidding…
Wow! What a transformation!
that RX7 at 8800 miles un modified .. 60-70k
The FB✨
what was the reaction of old dude?
From a lot of experience working with these cars and older jdm cars there’s a lot of things I would’ve done differently but to each their own we all have our different techniques looks good
Would’ve offered my house for this now very clean example of an RX7
Awesome find I got my 5 th fd was in a garage for 11years when I bought it but had 56k miles.Your car is worth at least $60k!
Probably one of the best looking cars even in 2022! They look amazing!
Don't sell it. What ever you do someone is gonna ruin it with an ls swap  I hate when. They do that
Amazing how nice things can stay if you just leave them alone for 20+ years!
For free... yeah idk man, if that's actually true, I can't imagine the YouTube money is great enough to make up for the time.  I'd charge what I'm worth.   Awesome job though.
That’s one pain in the a$$ car. In Hokkaido this mf car caused me so much trouble. Wankel don’t like cold and Hokkaido doesn’t have the ideal weather for it.
All the oil and water seals will need to be replaced unfortunately but what an awesome find!
Now thats how you REALLY detail a car! Tearing part of it down to clean it ALL.  The fact you guys do it for the Import Scene for FREE is AMAZING!
The left falangee is missing..😁
Would be sketched out by the engine sitting that long without firing up. Most RX7s that dont start for years, the irons corrode and you get coolant seal failure. Why most RX7 owners drain the coolant prior to long term storage nowadays.
Super excited I got to see this video. Hands down my favorite car in the world and to see it in such great condition and alive is cool!
the pure gold stands righthandside 😮
This Car in its Current condition is worth around 25-35K!!
the money you need to have to buy a car, drive it around a little, get scared of it and never take it out of the garage again.. im flabbergasted
beautiful
¿ PIRELLI ZERO also from 2005 ?
Never use a drill disk on loop carpet!!  YIKES!!!  Only pile carpet is it safe.  Look up the difference between pile and loop.
Nice restoration! We got "these ones" these is already plural brah!. Like the video though. And it's not that I'm a Grammer nazi or anything, but my mom told me a long time ago that "these ones" is just not write at all.
that is an RX7 R2 . I had the same in silver. Its easily 60k+
That's not the American version.  It has the Japanese badge in front and extra bumper lights in back 🤙🤙 fun fact of the day Mazda is the Croatian god of light and the Mazda badge is a burning candle
Sshheeessshh
Rx7 , 300z, supra, Acura legends Lexus coupes.90s were the best.
Amazing save the series 2 as well
Holster in the glove box, parked after a high speed run....... or a crime?? Probably ran from police in it and was too scared to drive it around again. Speaking from experience
Does it start!
Kamikoto doesnt even use "Japanese" steel. They just use basic stainless steel.
I wanted to hear a start up … 😢
Imagine what that's worth. Damn what a gem.
It all depends on the actual engines condition. The condition of the paint and interior are part of the price, but the major part of it is the state of the engine. With such low mileage, if it runs and drives, and theres nothing wrong with it, this car would be worth a LOT of money all cleaned up and maintained. If it has problems, you could have anywhere from a minor dent in its value to catastrophic problems with its value.
Amazing car. Better than anything sold by the major manufacturers today. Truly a visceral and iconic ride.
Amazing!!
Да нахуй она нужна
What a dope garage btw
Rotary 8000 miles is like 80k beaten piston engine
Beautiful car and congrats on such a rare barn find, did you guys ask about that  fb rx7? I love the first gen
Wow what a find
Wow, that's an incredible amount of work to do for free. I get that you make content with it, but still, big respect for helping people out! You've earned a new sub!
Fantastic, love the attention to detail. Great work 👍🏻
problem with rotary motors that have been sitting that long is that they will require a complete rebuild because of the, ya know, seals and what not so hopefully they wont try to start it let alone run it for too long if it even does. other than that if they actually wanted to sell it in a decent time probably 60k ish sounds ok.
Wow!! You guys truly did an amazing job. And I really honor your attention to detail. Great job.
Easy 60-70k
Need some mods
This is probably the most satisfying detailing video I’ve ever watched. Great job!
Should have tried to buy it before u cleaned it
maose
23 years with no rust, no mechanical problems yeah of course totally true, not staged at all...
How much do you guys charge for a details of magnitude? My 1976 benz needs one. Great work
Going to say what's already been said countless times.  They don't make em like they used to.
100,000
Your detailing is awesome no doubt about it. But please don't fool the audience. We love detailing
the car doesn't look to be sitting for that long, If there were 7 dead rats found, then were did their poop go? where did their piss go? the underneath carpet should bleed brown with all the poop and piss, that too of 7 mice. I always felt your channel fakes age of car. Get real buddy.
why he get a yellow spare whith a black car when i get a black spare whith my yellow rx-7 xD no joke ? really funny
100k
having one be sure the back wheel axel are ok before to run and change thats tire for sure and stiff the shock for real thats why the first driver was scared the original coil on the car are knowlegable to be loose as hell ;) mine yellow and eom same 8200 mile for nevada now in canada and stay on garage i run 1 time month and park it back my kid gonna have it later ;)
this car should go to auction-barrette Jackson! its immaculate and very rare find!
Just like new! Amazing job 🔥🙌🏼 it’s like going back in time and seeing the car in all of its glory 😊
Super amazed to see the Spitzer logo on there, was this in Ohio?
This FD RX-7 will likely go for upwards of $70k-$85k on the open market. Bone stock with under 9,000 miles. Great find.  Kind of funny that it seems like even the mice knew to respect it, not to mess it up or ruin it. Just sleep in it, don't break anything 😂
Wait... Got it up to 140 mph, got scared and parked and never drove it again!? Complete opposite of what I would have done!
Rare car in a perfect condition you guys did a great job 👍
30 years ago, I worked in a detail shop. It still brings me great inner peace and joy to see a car brought back to showroom condition. This was a spectacular job!
Mice tragedy right there....
What did you mess up on the sound on this one? That brush sound is grating as fuck, made my skin crawl
That car needs a dry ice cleaning on the undercar!
For free 😳 theres still good people out there how cool!!!
First time viewer. Why were the rotors ignored?
Tires should have been replaced. 23 year old tires can’t be good to drive on
First ever comment for me and it was therapeutic watching this i enjoy washing my vehicles but your on a whole different level i wonder how much you charged cause you put in some work and chemicals into it it has to be at least $2500 my respects bud awesome job 👍🏼
i come from Instagram
easily 40k
Why spray directly on the alternator...
Still looks better as a barn find than all the newer cars.
You did do a lot of work
No ones talking about the other car in there no? ok...
Nice work!… you gonna run those tires though?
Wow what a beauty
❤
Top 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Looks amazing but I hope nobody drives it with those tires. They are way to old to be safe. I would hate to see one fail and destroy one of the most beautiful cars ever made.
Sorry for the ignorance, but can you pressure wash an alternator like that? Shouldn't you cover it with something at least?
And black too, This color could make a 85 dodge Omni look menacing! Love it!
ohio plate..owner is an idiot .
Is that a barn find or a detail job for someone?
A diamond in the ruff ✨️
Great job. Surprising how bad it was for only 8,000 miles. That car needs some serious mods now! I’d say to custom red dip the interior is a must and get rid of those stock rims.
My ocd love that you took the tires off lol this was a great detail
You gotta appreciate the level of dedication and skill involved with this type of work. Fantastic job!!!
даже акум не снял, вот еблан
Great job 👍👍👍
Alot of bug splatter on a 8 thousand mile car, lol. I'm not saying this wasn't cool to watch. But 'detailing' a car with such low miles isn't impressive. Now a cool vid would be detailing your city's older cop car or a city bus.
Getting rid of the dead mouse smell is the hardest part. Those fuxkers die in the vents too and makes finding the source impossible. I had a 95 Stealth and they had a field day with the insulation 😭
Awesome!!!
Bro if a 92 stock Miata with 20,000 miles can go for $25,000 this thing should go for like 40 50 grand
60k+ car for sure! what a beauty
What about the older RX7 in the same garage? Did you leave that one there? And do you have picture of it? These cars are amazing.
Im glad you made sure you washed the battery and left it it when you soaked the engine bay. Lmao wtf is this amateur stuff
Sadly i life in Germany because i want to give you my VW Golf mk2 from 1989.
Definitely wouldn’t trust a tire that old… low miles or not. Dry rot!
BUYS FAST CAR. "ITS TOO FAST IM SCARED"
Cleaned the wheels then spray the dirty car off all over them
Dont know US prices but if you sell it overseas it might sell for 200k+ $
Right off the bat youre adding scratches by dragging a hard plastic vaccum head across the plastic glove box 🤦‍♂️
WHOA! that transformation is just insane! Hats off to you!
This is one of the most satisfying videos I’ve watched in a long time! Great work guys!
Just curious, How many PSI your jet wash cleaner to clean the car? It looks well cleaned
If i turn 18 please sell this car to me 😭
Probably 25k price tag not much more than that
My grandfather has one of this in Puerto Rico , we plan on bringing it back to life . Definitely more work than this but I think it will come out great 👍. Awesome video guys
Still one of my favorite cars of all time.
Awesome job guys!!!
9:40 pinicle of satisfaction
Spitzer! That’s an Ohio car, dealership is right down the road from me!
Subscribed. That car needs to go to a museum, it’s perfect!
in the Philippines, we call these fine time capsules as "SARIWA". Or roughly translated as "fresh af"
INSANE!
0:40 The most fake ass story i’ve heard. Got scared? really? ok just drive slowly
TREASURE!!
Last generation
damn OHIO got them barn finds adn free detailing!@! guesss I gotta move
watching you guys for the first time and it couldn't have  been a more perfect video. the perfect and perfect condition, in the best paint colour to really make aa before and after. ughh so good
does the use of liquids and a pressure washer in the engine compartment harm the electrical connections?
Those mice knew this was a car they shouldn’t mass with
Amazing job
what about the other mazda in the barn
Lmao imagine getting scared of this car. Lexus made faster in the same year 😂
Garth Brooks has hundreds of dead bodies on his properties he cant stop killing his fans. 👖👖
My favorite car of all time magnificent ❤
Awesome car... Awesome cleaning job.. One of the most beautiful car I everseen..
When I saw that Spitzer dealer logo I instantly knew where you guys were from 👍 fantastic job on this one!
It was parked there because it was time to rebuild the rotary engine @ 8800 miles :) I like the content but the narration is so alarming and anxiety infused ! Chill my man :)
5:10 most skipped part 💀
that brisket looks delicious but I cant unsee the picking up the dead mice with same type of gloves as the ones wearing to cut the brisket lol
Fantastic work.. is it for sill??.. if it is for sill.. how much will cost to arrive to Saudi Arabia??. Your reply in this regard is highly appreciated.  Thanks
I feel like doing the wheels would be last....as the top side dirt is now going to get the wheels dirty again..
23years? that's my car in seven days
Yup have to wash all the interior.. Mouse piss and poo littered that car...
Great job and what a find.  Would have liked to see the engine bay vacuumed out before spraying all that soap onto mice nests.  Yuck.
thats my fav car
It’s always a pleasure to see people who are passionate about what they do and who are also great at their profession go to work. 👌
Absolutely stunning final piece.. Just one thought.. You should have either bought brand new brake discs or, restored those original ones ( I think there's a dry ice sandblast product now ) otherwise. Gorgeous.. I have a 1976 Holden ( Isuzu ) Gemini in the garage ( In Australia ) .. One day, I hope I can get it to look like this. It's 46 years old now and needs some attention and work. Haven't driven it for close to 5 years now sadly..
Not bad on the detailing and restoration. But still need to head back to the Madza for checking the internal wiring, components, suspension and other stuff to grade its integrity
i would buy it when it was in EU.. i would pay till 50k for it.. its my dreamcar.. got an rx8  but my dream is a fd x7
99% - wonderful detailing. the rotor could have had some skimming. otherwise, amazing job.
Awesome 🔥🔥🔥
top amigo
Kamikoto is not made in Japan  There is no such Japanese manufacturer😢
120 000k
Would never high pressure wash any engine bay....
Its 30 yo garndpa I got 4 grand👹
We gonna ignore the fb rx7
This is the best time to sell this car ..  the market is crashing and it’s highest it will ever be now .. well few months ago actually .. but now it’s not too bad still
I'm curious about that other RX-7.
It mazda x-7 because left steering wheels lol😂
Awesome detailing and restoration. If I was the owner I would install some new zinc coated rotors on it . The rusty rotors are hurting my eyes in contrast of how beautiful that car currently looks .
legend from 90 rx7
Cool video but the wheels are way too old to use them.
i know people who would buy this for around 100k
How many barns are there…😅😅😅
You could have just done the drums on the pucks, he rustled, in any case you did it professionally
I’m extremely impressed with how thorough you guys were in detailing every single part of the vehicle. My mom owns a RX-7 I believe the R1, I’m not positive. But it is the most beautiful thing ever. Unfortunately she wants to sell it and I just got a new car (22 Forte GT) which I can’t complain about, I love it but that RX-7 is something.
Such a gem!
thank you for making this legend clean and alive again. Thank you very much.
Make sure that the car doesn’t shut off when you turn the key ignition to the left as it is known to be an issue in all Mazdas and rx7s specially
Rob Dahm needs to see this :D
You might wanna replace the johnson rod as it goes out sometimes when sitting.
What an absolute beauty! Thanks for sharing
Hi if the owners are willing to sell the car, please get in touch with me regarding it
Ahh so satisfying.
Fake 😂 barn find my ass
The holy grail of Ohio barn finds. Literally my dream car.
Did noone notice the series 2 parked next to the FC?
Price is almost name your own for a 8k mi Dorito boi.
More cars are found in barns than there are barns.
Car looks amazing
immaculate
Hands down my favorite car. I have the MX6 and my next will be one of these sleepers. What will the owner be doing with this one?
Stellar work well done.
Man them tyres are old needed replacing not cleaning.
What a wonderful video. Thank you
needs only brake disc's and new tires Bro its so pure that FD
One of my dream car, hopefully i have this one.
Hi guys I'm from India liked ur work and I'm a hard worker so if there is any work opportunity kindly help me out
This can push $100k given its condition and mileage especially in the current market.
Prolly get almost 80k
That’s fucken bananas!! Finding a unicorn!! Jdm legend in that condition!! Great job on restoring it!! At the end you said you added paint protection.. would you ceramic coat car like this ?? PPF?? If not why?? Just curious on your thoughts.
This video is very satisfying lol
Let’s be real is he really reading every comment ???
Pls started this car
owners reaction?
What foam cannon are you using in the video?
WHY WOULD U SOAK A ENGINE BAY AND LEAVE THE BATTERY IN CONNECTED OF ALL THING WHAT DE F
that rx7 would easily sell for 70-90k
Под панелью мышиное кладбище оставили, вонять будет бодро когда печка начнет работать.
@samcrac
Easily 70k
What happened to the blue first generation RX7 that was also parked in the garage? Very rare. I have a 1980 RX7, original owner.
Nice work! That car is beautiful! I dunno if these have gotten quite as high as mark 4 supras but I wouldn't be surprised if it could pull 6 figures if the right person sees it!
cmon you dont wash 23 year old tires you take them off and throw away....
What about that first gen next to it ?
I subscribed when I saw the sadistic dealership branding surgically removed from the sleeping unicorn. A sleeping unicorn with a poorly-designed engine that will need replaced before anyone can drive it again.
blows for just leaving the car abandoned in his garage
Good as new!!
MICE need to watch for Haunta Virus
Is he selling this car?
Nice u can add some wraps on black and paint the car red?
Very nice detail.  Restoration?   Hardly.   The engine will need fully pulled down and proper inspection...and then rebuild.  If everything is done properly,  it could easily be 60-70k in value.  Likely more.
The mice 🐁 enjoyed this car more then the owner 🤣. Good job guys cleaning the car 👍
Now that was satisfying 😭💯💯💯💯
My all time dream car
How much approximately that type of car restoration cost! That was a great job.👍👏
Can you restore my all black 05 g35 coupe
For 99' FD3S RX-7   Consider recent JDM trend rise, I would say this one is excellent condition, you could even call it mint condition and really low milages, I would say this would worth 50K easy!
all that water you use to clean inside, is going to create mould...it needs to be completely dry inside...
soundtrack?
Shame to see such a find soaped and power nozzled, shouldve been dry iced
I think you may have missed another find in that garage ... Looked like a Toyota Supra to the right of the RX-7.
Oooo yea and how much is the 94 worth I can’t believe it’s been sitting that long it’s crazy he parked it cuz he was scared of driving it y the hell did he even buy it must be nice to buy a car and let it sit and not think twice about it
Man... Having the right tools and setup sure makes everything look so easy to do!
Wow it looks beautiful like it just came off the lot at the dealership I have to ask tho what’s up with the blue RX7 right next to it the late 70s early 80s love those and does the 94 still have the rotary engine ?
So how can I get in touch with the owner about negotiations on pricing?????
How much did this service cost?
How come in all these videos it's always 23 years since the last wash.
That is not a barn.
Did you sell it? If so how much did it sell for?
"Got scared of it an parked it'; I have a 1994 fd3 and it is near showroom condition. Value? Rexy is mechanically perfect and has a rebuilt rotary, twin turbo; he goes like a cut snake. I will not part with it for less than 100k.  Want the best price, put it on BAT with a 80K USD reserve; few were made and even fewer of this calibre areleft today.  Great work btw,
I would say $40k after cleaned up, would have been a lot more 2 years ago.
Wow. Amazing job
Beautiful work i love it Mick
👏👍👏
So sad this work of art was kept in the dark and not treated very well for so long. I appreciate that you gave her the love she deserved.
WOW I have a BMW that needs you  Nice Job 👍👍👍👍👍🍺🍺🍺🍺
a
Amazing
Tell the owner I'll buy it from him.  Name a price!!!!
Cool 😎 Happy Thanksgiving 🦃
Nice video but way too many ads = no subscription.
I feel like the car market is kind of crashing now but i still wouldnt be surprised if this goes for over 100k. But if it was like a couple months ago this would sell for some absurd number like 300K+ lol xD
Love this page but I thought it’s bad for you’re paint hand washing you’re car all kinds of ways I thought start from the top too the bottom u was going bottom top bottom top.
If you show me tyres marking, then I know its 99 or early date. Rest is just pure guessing
Those tires aren't road safe anymore, hope you or the owner changes them asap.
if the car is worth 70k its worth what he paid for it brand new in 1995, and that owuld be 70k but i bet some crazy person would maybe pay 6 figures for this car.
What polisher and pad size did you use the the rear spoiler?
The guy washing the car is sexy 😋😍😍😍😘😘😘😘🔥🔥🔥🔥cute as.f. I wonder if he has a boyfriend?
Judging by other prices i seen I'd say 100k to 150k you should make him a offer it's a good investment
I wanna know how much ya’ll are selling it for
for sure needs new tires and breaks. and all fluids changed
So did you guy just clean it or you guys was able to purchase it for resell
So satisfying
Perfection
I love the idea behind this channel. inspirational! subscribed
Dude I want that series 3 rx7 next to it. What’s he doing with it?
Great job
One owner 8800 miles I would say 70-100k
Sick. It has like a smoked tail light or it looks like it. I like it.
1,000 bucks if it doesn't run. Running correctly,  easy 8-10K with title.
250-300k no bs
O cara achou um RX7 com 13mil KM, wtf
FABULOUS Job......Cant believe you do this for free.....
seen a lot of mice living in cars...23 years....those were the most considerate and centralized mice i've ever seen.
I just thought I could clean a car,that was awesome and so detailed nothing missed,awesome job!!!
Where’s this car going up for sale
Oh come on its in ohio too does anyone have the contact info of the owner?
I'm a dude who can appreciate all brands of cars. While muscle cars are more my flavor, the rx-7 holds a special place in my heart. Always picked it in need for speed games and other racing game. Imo, mazda's best car design.
I can’t wrap my head around parking an 8800 mile car bc you drove it fast and got scared. Just don’t fking drive that fast again, dummy. Nor can I fathom having enough money to put something like that in the garage and just forget about it. Tf?
If it ain’t a veilside I don’t want it 🧐
I just fell in love with that car!!!
Such an amazing find! Badass 😎👍🏻
In todays market, that is easily $60k if not more.  A 93 w/44k miles was sold in BAT for $64k recently
don't wash engine bayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Put the green Rotary attachment on the Rupes iBrid nano, thats the solution if it feels underpowered. and with a slight learning curve you can control the pressure you're putting on the pad to avoid any holograms.
Absolutely perfect
Beautiful. Makes me miss my 93 FD!
Great Video. Can I ask what is the brand of foam cannon that was used in the video?
It came out absolutely perfect
Absolutely amazing!!
$60-90k but I'm not in the the business
You get 2 or 3 people in an auction who want this car, really bad, I’m thinking $60k-$90k, I’d take this to Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale.
Wow, great work... and what a find!!!
Ya know. You probably shouldn’t get a battery that’s connected wet…..
Lets not forget about the older FB Rx7 casually sitting next to it
You suck so jealous.  Nice work thumbs up amazing find.
Seen this on fb thats why im here.....
Funny how you ignored the first gen to the right! Smh
Thats a Stock RX 7!!! Pleace keep her on origin part. Protec her from narsistic owner.
Is it a 93? The 93's had painted plastic interiors that scratch easy.  It appears to be an R1 trim. I have a 93 Touring in my garage and nearly all of my original stock parts, including the rats nest solenoids. Lube the door locks a bit. The plastic keyhole doors break easily. Seriously, you'll detail my FD for free? I'm just north of Detroit. Maybe in the Spring.
Wow! That’s show room fresh, actually better than Showroom Fresh! 🎉🎉
I'd give 1500.00 for it 😁🤙
They real question I want to know is how much did you pay for it 🤔
I'll buy it who owns it
Wtf!? What about the Supra parked right next door to it!!! Omg 😮😮
JDM DREAM ❤
What a find!
the car looks good nothing is wrong about it
Those knife are scam
scared of the car? LOL 🤣
Beautiful design
Don’t keep up on value or trends or inflation I’m guessing right buyer you could easily get 50-100k
I showed my grandpa this video and he wants to get in contact wit you guys to detail his RX7 with 29k miles in it
Looks like a brand new car!!!
My dream car found in a barn almost brand new...
Ótimo trabalho. Greatings from 🇧🇷
Thats a super clean fd considering how long it sat.
I have a new car that I want to protect. What is the best ceramic coating I can get & what are some other tips for keeping it clean?
@tommyfyeah
Nice, the one last detail i would have done was to clean up the brake rotors.
I am interested in buying it please tell me the price
Please clean my car XTS Cadillac 05
Great find
I don't know why you guys are drooling all over this detail. The paint on this car is in fantastic shape to begin with and especially not weather beaten being garage kept. It's no different than detailing any other car.
Wao we need this video. Thanks👏🏼👏🏼👍🏼👍🏼
How is that rotary running 😮
Is it for sale?
So wait….he went too fast in the car and then got scared so he stopped driving it all together and let it just crumble away? Wth is wrong with people.
Don’t get how these people let these cars just rot. No common sense.
bruh that FB is WAYYY cooler than the FD
If you really wanna increase the cars price, replace the battery, brake pads and rotors and tires, all the rubber seals and bushings, and change out all the fluids
There used to be a Spitzer dealership in Columbus, is that where this is from?
whata jewel
Awesome job on detailing the RX7 you guys should get the other RX7 and do the same thing
$50,000 to $75,000 easy maybe, even more, Depending on where he sells it and how
That car is definitely worth $35k
Wtf got scared at 140? Wierd guy😄
😮😮😮😮😮😮
Mazda has ALWAYS HAD STYLE, and they are my favorite of the Japanese car makers.  Owning an original Miata was my favorite car to date ...so simple, so much fun......still kicking myself for not buying one of these RX-7s back in the day.  Just perfect!
Um verdadeiro carrão muito chic
Market value is around $240000
this would be a dream come true, id swap my 2012 picanto for this beautiful rx-7 any day xD  Im in the uk btw just a thought xD
Je n'ose même pas imaginer l'état du faisceau électrique de cette voiture au vu de tout les rats qui ce sont pas balader dedans
Lol. Scared of it lol
Can’t believe it’s that clean, being an Ohio car. Wonder if he’d sell it.
How are the tires not dry rotted
How is this even possible that car was sitting that long?
I have a 99 eclipse with 57k miles.
50k easy. They sell for 20k with no engine or trans
I’m just curious about the whole power washing the engine bay because that could very easily damage electrical parts of the engine. I don’t know much about this so I was just curious if you knew it was safe to do that
Omg I want that car.. thanks forbthe video
Will the electrics be fine even if you use your water like that in the engine bay?
I thought I kept my LN Nav. clean both outside/inside AND  engine comp.  I am going to use those products this spring and give the LN a Real scrub job....Like watching ya.....
Car looks immaculate.  Rotors look like garbage and should have either been changed out or re-milled.  The rusty rotors really detract form the beauty of the car.
Just subscribed. Great job! If I may ask, what is the make of the lift you have?
Excellent work and presentation, guys.   For a final reveal, I would suggest you really show your best results by filming the car outside.  ✌️
Diamond in the ruff .. so lucky man
Neden çalıştırmadınız
Nice Job, this car is legend, stay wonderfull, I´m Brazilian folow you guys!
Did you ever get a value report?
Well done keep up the good work boys
What was the years on the coins found in the trunk?
How’s your alternator!!!
Love this video! What are the cleaners used on the inside and outside? I am doing a restoration and would love some of the cleaning products used in this.
Finding money from 23 yrs ago is a gold mine. I would get it checked even if it’s a 23 yr old penny! I wish I had this car. It’s one of my favorites. It’s up there with the R32
This is the fastest car I've been in. My buddy had one back in 01 down in san diego. We pinned a 178 mph going down  the 5 south , felt like I was going 80 in my own car.  Stable , smooth , this car is a true beast.
Did you do anything to the electrical so no damage from washing engine?
At least 20 thousand
35-50K I would assume. But who knows, Nostalgia is a powerful motovator.
Don't know the fair price but I would gladly take out a second mortgage on my home if he would be willing to sell it to me. Been my dream car for life. I won't be able to pass on till I have owned one.
If I win the lottery in the next few weeks I'll be in touch with the owner! Dream car in dream condition for me
He said he was scared to drive it? SMH 🤦🏽‍♂️
This was my dream car.  Driving back from my junior year in college in 1978, I stopped by the Santa Barbara, CA Mazda dealership with a friend who drove the the RX-4.  There in the showroom was the first model year of the RX-7.  I fell and love and worked a deal with a friend in the car leasing business for a red, 4 speed.  I purchased eventually for $5500 and later sold it for $8,000.   Always hoped I be able to purchase another.  The model that was last tagged in 1999 was probably the last model year (1995).  It was a gorgeous design with a great power train complimented I think by twin turbos easily capable of reaching 140 mph.  The 1978 version had a power plant that overmatched the suspension.  I reached 120 and felt like I was floating.  What a beauty.
Are you selling it?
4 fucking days ago man, what a find.
What cleaning supplies do you use and get them at
Nice !
How does people find those cars in a barn. I meant even if I try I am sure I won’t find one.
🔥
Nice craftsmanship
Id say 40k with with that mileage...
Does anyone know what the song is called?
God 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻❤❤🇸🇦
Damn! Rare vehicle, amazing wash it needed
Krásná práce, krásné auto. Co dodat 😍👍
Lhd manual so 75k-90k
I was eating. But nice car tho
is it a rx7
I can’t even imagine the price for this would go for.
the rubber on the tires sound like a new
Thats amazing. I havent seen one since the fast and the furious
My son has two RX-7s he is rebuilding/refurbishing.
I personally find these so unappealing. All RX7 are in that PT Cruiser category for me.
How do you find these barn finds
Get a real job. Nobody cares for that junk.
That beautiful car is my dream car my Instagram is literally my bad backwards and then Rx7 😂 you guys are so lucky
damn, letting the motor sit is worse than beating on it
this is bonkers
After detailing I think you should atleast drive it and let the viewers see it in action just for some fun 😊
you're telling me someone who bought a 95' r2 is afraid of high speed therefore it's been sitting in the garage for so many years......
W😳W he just wash away $3000 worth of added Value to cars Blue Book Value. All Original numbers matching  Someone would have gave him big money. But he Washed it all away good luck
After 8 minutes you get to the sponsor of the video and you show the finished car in the back…
Where can I get those brushes used, for wheels and interior
It's actually worth more money with the dealership tagging on it. But, oh well. It's off now haha
Saludos..... magnífico trabajo hace años trabaje por el área de Burton y Middlefield Ohio y pude ver varios autos en malas condiciones abandonados por los dueños... gracias
Bro was scared of the rx-7 😅
Молодцы
Drove it at 140mph and got scared then just parked it for over 25 years 😅
Did you guys hit it with an ozone generator at least?
Mazdas are so interesting. Just the design and the motor it uses
Makes me miss my FD even more now....I hope Karma came for those who stole my baby...they never even found the frame.
What happens to it after it's all clean? Is it for sale?
The story makes no sense what so ever. I'm scared of something, wouldn't you just sell it?
Guessing he's selling it now, I'd imagine he's gonna get a massive return on his investment with a mint condition RX7 in today's market. Gorgeous car
If I could convince my grandparents to open the garage we got a 1992 chrysler LeBaron and a 1969 dodge dart swinger and they have both been just sitting for so long and we would love to see life out of them again, especially my grandmother since the dart was hers back in the day
In today’s market a little over 100k all day!! At auction probably a bit more to the right buyer
How long do you guys keep these cars to get them cleaned up? Is it a team effort done in a day or is this a multi day project?
Owner was a Rotary guy  What about the light blue one? 1st Gen
in south-africa this car would sold for atleast 1.5million Rand in USA dollar its 83K
It's a miracle that this piece of automotive history has survived despite the filth and conditions it had to go through those 23 years.
That vacuum sucks 🤣🤣
thas a museum piece
just wow
I COULD HAVE BUGHT ONE OF THESE IN RED WITH TAN LEATHER , FULLY LOADED TURBO  ETC....BACK IN 2002 FOR ONLY 13K.....MAN IM KICKING MYSELF NOW....
You might wanna change the breaks and tune it and a new exhaust because it’s rusty
I have always loved those kind of headlights.
Dream car!
I spy a Spitzer Ford logo lol   Tachophobia definitely no joke I remember pushing past 140 in my.... well I don't want to say cuz people will laugh.. but needless to say I had a freaking  bubble in my tire and my hood latch was never fully able to latch because the car was wrecked at one point in time..  It was a very dumb move that's for sure, going up 76 East out of Akron with my brother. Felt like we were floating, I looked down at my speedometer and the needle was past the 140 mark where it stopped.. I'm guessing somewhere around 145/150 mph.. had mad respect for that Sebring Coupe ever since..  Quick little car, jump time on me one day and I never pulled the motor to fix it.. wound up giving it away.   The fastest car I have now is my Equus Signature with that 5.0.. Now it's so freaking big and heavy anything past 100 mph feels like I'm a rowing tank getting ready to blast through whatever I hit.. Definitely not a speed demon.. I rarely ever climb past 100 anyways anymore..
The fat muffler. Put an aftermarket exhaust on that thing.
WHY!!!! Why are you putting tires back on from 98-99? Any tire over 10yrs need to be dispose of
35,000
Superb job. Awesome barn find!
I’ll pay you what you paid for the car no need to be stingy lol let me know I’ll make the flight I’ll drive it home and take good care of the car
I don't get why you are taking the time to clean a 23 year tire, you need to replace those anyways
magnifique restauration et de nettoyage!! vous êtes des magiciens . Bravo à vous . Le résultat est excellent.
What product did you use to polish the paint ? It seemed to not dry out and was easily removed.
Ouu that shiny black 👌🏻 perrfect, Mazda wouldn’t do it better
Must have been an early production car based on the Mazda emblem on the hood.  They stopped using that when Renault said in looked theirs.  I worked for Mazda as a QA engineer from 1990 to 1999.  Those RX-7 turbos were bad ass cars.  The flip flop blue they used was the best color IMO.  Car was also painted on a rotisserie to get even paint.  It was a cool process that was copied from Porsche.
Still one of the best looking cars from the 90’s in my opinion. You guys did an amazing job! I was say this could fetch anywhere from $60-75k on Sotheby’s, Bring a Trailer or Cars and Bids given the low mileage.
Is this guy going to sell it? If he is, that may actually break the market 😂
$45,000
Wow, that's  just awesome. I love 90s  cars, 80s too. Love XR3i XR2i Ford's rock
Absolute gem. My dream car when I was a kid.
Awesome job how much did y’all pay for the car 🚗
Unbelievable. Looks brand new
Pre resto. Probably somewhere between 25-30k since it was neglected filled with mouse nests and only for that reason. As of now, I have not seen the resto, but im going to say easily 50-75k.
An all original R1/R2, truly a unicorn..  So many of these were modified..  very few original examples made it..  AWESOME piece of automotive history.
Perfect
23 years sitting a rotary car & it cranks up Lmao this is so scripted it’s not even funny! I had owned 2 FDs! & this is not believable by any means! Mind u all… the FD chassis is ONE frame cuz except the front bumper & lower side panels! My point is, when these car rust it rusted simultaneously do to the one off frame! Sooo NOOO lol this is phony man I can’t!
I’m curious if you pulled any of the other interior plastics to check for mice?  Also, did you run any kind of chemical disinfectant through the dash vents?   We’re there any mice in the air box?   Great video - would like to have seen the finished product.
80k-100k
I live in SW Iowa and I really wish there was someone around here that took time and had the passion that you guys have for detailing. Awesome work!
Suggestion, people have the attention span of a nat you could speed the edits along much quicker, one tire cleaning would've been enough.  Excellent work restoring that beauty.😃
100k car
Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great car , great work.... but I call BS on the reason this was parked up in the garage for all them years.
Need to invest in a dry ice blaster to get the rust and put the under plastic to like new condition.
Geneva ohio. Would love to see you guys take on my modified 2017 Jeep Wrangler. I'm a combat wounded disabled veteran so detailing isn't possible for me.
Ok so at the commercial break you have the car behind you.. why do I need to watch the video now 🤔
Umm only 8800 miles? That is a trophy!
betta checc them old ass coins lmfao might be worth sum
there is a lot more to getting a car on the road that's been sitting in a shed for that long then cleaning it you put that on the road just doing what you are going to do a $10 seal and blow the engine it would need a month in the shop being looked over and if you didn't do that you would be kidding yourself.
Its worth 100k easy....
For 8800 miles what a slob that drove it...
The owner bought a sports car and then got scared of it? Uhm what
Poor car is never going to see the road again. Bet it’s going to collection.    😢 it’s just to mint.
Honestly you can just alone have an asking price of 80k or more based off mileage and condition of the engine… RHD in japan are going from 30k(rough around the edges) to 60K(really good condition)
ありがとう
Knowing the rarity of these cars and want for them. The condition, mileage, and unmodified engine/trans, along with the current used car prices. I could see this going for at least $30K-$35K.
беру за 300!
Was the car able to start? Fuck the wash or the detailing if it doesn't run.   You did I a good job btw, was just wondering if it started.
oh god.. hope the car is running after that bath..
I just don't know about washing the engine bay and not disconnecting any of the harness. Even tho u dryed it out.
When was this car built?
Tyres and wipers has to be changed. Rubber has been aged for too long. If you look closely tires have a flatspot for sitting too long at same position. Otherwice very nice detail job gyus.
Brilliant job cleaning,and what a piece of history that car is. Though I was wondering about the mechanical end of it. The engine,oil tank,gear box,fuel tank,gaskets,discs (they looked a bit rusted)....etc.. Plus the electrical etc... I presume that got taken care of. A car sitting for that long would need care for the engine and all mentioned. And that's another big job. Was great to watch. Love these restoration vids. 👍👍👍
NOOOOO! YOU MISSED A SPOT ON THE DRIVERS DOOR AND IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY!
Shit video
Is this for sale
Really nice job. Would be also nice to think about removing rust from brakes disc as it looks really ugly on so nice car
Outstanding transformation!! Great job!! I'm really curious about how your flooring works and how it drains, do you have any issues with mold or mildew?
New tyres straight away
The old tires must be immediately off the rim and new ones on it
Brap brap brap brap🔥
ありがとう
Missed the seat back pocket
All panels should be removed to check for more mice. These creatures can get into places where you don't expect them to be.  Since the mice is able to reach the glove box, there should be more under the dashboard which you didn't remove.  This RX7 has a great condition, keep finding those dead mice.
Scared of the car ?!
listing price, actual value and sale price are 3 different things, yes the value may be worth more than the listing price but in the end its only worth what someone is willing enough to pay for it which would be the end sale price
That’s a gold mine buddy!
Paint just doesn’t look as good as it should
Brilliant video guys. I always like even before I start watching :-) And, glad to hear that you haven't gone down the 'loud music drowning everything out' route, much nicer than a lot of other channels I have now stopped watching due to that.
I miss my rx7 😭
how would the tires be in that condition after 23 years?
Looks like that's ohio. Spitzer Chevrolet
🔥🔥🔥
Nice video editing and restoration of this beauty.  Just one question.  Can I please have it?
this car so goooood
Couple things....or more... That was a great video! What's the purpose of that rounded brush? Why not a flat one, on other, maybe larger, surfaces?  How long was the whole process from start to finish? What did the customer say when you returned it? And lastly, I bet when you're done and you turn to look at the job youve done, the immense satisfaction you guys have, has got to be incredible!! Anywho...GREAT JOB, Guys!!!
Free? Wow. I watched another channel that what you did would have cost the owner 3-4 grand. Very nice work.
If it was sitting that long wouldn't the tires been dry rotted?
Original air in tires?
Very nice car but 140mph in this non turbo car I am pretty skeptical of... sorry
Cool video! Hi from Belarus!
Why cars not looking like this anymore? such a great looking car even till this day.
Old man had a mint FD *AND* an FB RX-7 just sitting I the garage! Talk about keeping his priorities straight!
Given the absurd low mileage along with all original paperwork, I say this could bid very very high on Bring a Trailer.  $75k or more.  Only thing that will work against its top dollar is sitting for so long and the mice. But definitely a high dollar gem, wonderful resto job.
since there is a lots of dead mice in the car. sure its smells bad. any tips how to get rid of the bad smells?
What about the older blue one in the other bay of the garage?
Define change the break rotor and pads out, those thing are rustyyyyy.
Love the Gran Turismo 1-3 style music lol
8800 miles that must be 70-100k worth maybe more
I want one so bad😭
I mean, I've got 20k cash in hand for it right now 💁
Mice doesn't eat wiring of abandoned things but it chews all wiring of things you are currently using
60-80k
Did great job👍
Worth allot of money that one is..
How much did the guy sell it for after this?  I bought a 1993 Rd for 12000 with a 105000 miles in early 2000.  I ended up putting in very little new things but still spent about 15 thousand next 4 years on basic maintenance.  These are now very rare and worth quite a lot.
You do all this work for free?
The value is double, it’s a rare FD with the badge on the trunk, and only has 8800 miles
Incredible car, Incredible job guys!
Dont recognize that badge on the back left doesn't look stock what does it read I thought it was spirit or efini
This was an absolute pleasure to watch. How much does a full detail like this even cost?
I’m from PA and I’m pretty sure I saw this car on Facebook marketplace
Sacrilege turned into a miracle. Job well done.
It blows my mind that someone could get scared of the car and just park it and not sell it or something. This transformation is amazing..crazy.
Incredible job on an incredible car. You don’t see many of those around. Amazing work.
What idiot would let that car go like that geez
You going to get those swirl marks off you put on there? Buffed in circles
I see one huge issue with this car, it's not on my driveway
I’ll trade you for my 1978 corvette and a watermelon
even the mice know how much a rotor engine is worth and just stayed there and enjoyed the warmth lol
I bet you could ask for 100k for this
Being all original  30-40,000 $ . Going to need a little work to bring it back to working order after setting 23 years !
Why do I have a description in Russian about comments all in English? 🤮
That’s just crazy it’s definitely worth a lot since FD rx7s are already expensive
wow that thing was in such great shape   AND THAT MILEAGE IS CRAZY 👀
As you know, it’s a used car sellers market right now because limited supply in the new market. The car would be attractive at a reputable auction with a reserve of $30000. You will be surprised. Good luck.
Awesome job! I would sell a kidney to be the one who gets to buy and drive that beauty. Those were/are bad ass cars and you treated that one right!
untouched rx7 worth a lot of money
75000
Kudos for removing the dealer's badge lmao
First things first. The biggest grapefruit shooter you can find at pepboys. Then maybe, just maybe a length of PVC with a fake K&N duct taped on it as a perfect intake. Throw in a pair of Cerwin Vega home speakers in the back seat with exposed wiring of course, and you got one fine piece of Japanese engineering. Oh, if the budget allows for it, then a 5" tach velcroed to the top of the dash. Just close enough to the steering to block your field of view. Trust me, you'll thank me when she rolls across the auction floor.
That FB too !
1995 was the last production year for the RX-7 in North America. This is either a 94 or 95 with the twin turbo charged twin rotor 13reb engine cranking out ~265 hp @ 4000 rpm. It was a fast car for sure. Problem was the Wankel rotary engine had problems meeting emissions standards so Mazda pulled them off the US market even though they continued to be sold in Japan until 2002. They sold for $40k equipped like this one in 1995. This car you have is practically cherry. On a good day at auction $100-$120k probably.
Old geezers be hoarding. Probably had a kid that wanted it but was too selfish smh wasted years.
Please read this comment! DROP the CHEEZY no name music from the time lapse work, NOT NEEDED and totally annoying tunes!
Engine junk. Manufacturer trash….basically a coin flip of who will be more relevant/even exist over the next decade Mazda or Nissan, BUT b/c of the rarity of the RX7 & the absurd obscurity of the nonsense wankel rotary engine this FOR SURE is a collectible….but it’s not b/c it was such a. Great design, it’s precisely b/c it’s such a shit one
A truck with alot of ammunition huh....I smell a rat with those mice.
This Ohio detailers are wild 💀
Great work
Was that Spitzer dodge in Whitehall ohio?
so goooddddd looks exactly like mine
U can get about 15k for it
Damn that thing is beautiful
The best alltime lucky find of alltime!
lame when dealers put their advertisement logo on there. I'd have them pay me for advertisement or take the logo off when I buy it.
Great jobs guys looks brand new !
# Adam LZ has entered chat 😅😂
$64,000 if put in showroom condition with no more miles?
Kinda sucks i was eating
Keep up the good work guys awesome Job
I’d say it prob worth 45k…?
140mph scared him.? What a beta male! 🤦‍♂️
Man, that is a great find and beautiful restoration.  I used to own a 3rd gen and this makes me really miss mine.
Rx7 power 💪
I’m gonna say $100k all original low miles original owner
I had the exact 1993 R1 RX7.  After rebuilding the engine due to failed apex seals, sold it.  It was a great car.  If this one is good mechanically, it’s worth over $100K.  Great job on detailing.
Son una chingonada, a ustedes si que les gustan los autos,,mis respetos ,,ya no hay personas así ,,,y ustedes son jóvenes,, felicidades!! Excelente video ,, saludos desde la sultana del norte Monterrey nuevo León México
Bad ass.  I love this gen RX7.  I bought an exact die cast replica of this same car in Germany in 97.  I still have it.  Wanna sell it?
you missed a spot
22,700
Sad they don't make like it anymore, great work 👍🏼
A think the spoiled the video
Beautiful Car
That car is a life goal for me
I can watch this car being slowly detailed for an entire month
That ammo with these prices seems like you made out.
Very nice
Cost of restoration?
What about the other RX-7 , the blue one on the right. Is it going to be detailed to?
Probably going to sale for about 100k
Those rusty brake rotors look great!
Where did I go to school to learn that
So you guys read every comment huh. Well I feel this is a good place to get this off my chest. Late at night when everyone in my house is asleep I like to go out back to my garden and cover myself with dirt to pretend I’m a carrot.
It worth about 80$/100,000
🤫 I won't say anything about those coins if you let me have the car😂
I bid 75,000
@tommyfyeah
Loved it!! Question! What did you used to clean the engine bay? How much PSI is your pressure washer?
Wow , PLEASE CAN I BUY THE RX7 FD 🥹
I call b******* on that being 23 years and you clean it off that easy I've had cars that I've gotten out of a barn after 5 or 6 years that did not come off that easy puts on like a mold and a baked into the paint not just washing off and it comes clean but still like the video
Is he selling this masterpiece of a car?
Wow that thing has to be worth 100k if not more with so little miles and in the shape it's in and with all the little paperwork
what a beautiful find. I love that car.
That's incredible. This has been my dream car for a long time it's really cool to see one in such good condition. I never could afford something like this time capsule but it turned out amazing. What a cool result.
No death,was fried,
That's a 100k+ car on a bad day
WOW 👌 you guys ROCK! GREAT JOB 👍
Car is looking brandnew again and that is what the car really is ! Nice for a Mazda museum !
I’d have bought those mice
parked in 1999 and just fired right up for you guys?  hmmm...
It will sell for more than 80K it looks great!!
That's the car from GTA
Wow this car needs to go straight to an auction house
Great job!!! Watching your videos is SO SATISFYING!!!!!
Spitzer is all around ohio I would not take less than 100,000 for this car there is not another one like it
Also… don’t say you’re detailing anything if you can’t do this level work. Holy sh*t
#RobDahmn would be the go to man  for this little sweet thing
Excellent!!
Subscribed. I like how you narrate, speed up the cleaning , and overall great video.
An R1 like that would be 80K on B aT. I would be surprised if less.
With the condition of the car and the low miles, I want to say the car is anywhere from $30,000-$40,000 or possibly more.
Sweetolini🥳🥳🥳
Very nice.  But does it start and run after 23 years???  I pulled an FD out of a barn too.  It had been there for 5 years.  The mice had built extensive nests in the ductwork for the heater and defroster and the fan.   We had to take the dash apart to get it all out.  Great running cars; scary fast on cold mornings!
That came out super clean. You guys did a killer job!!
Are those tyres still good after this time?
Surely those tyres should be replaced. Potential massive blow out.
That's beautiful 😍
Unfortunately those tires are dry rotted, need replacing. All that work for nothing, except the rims. You guys do a phenomenal job!
Incredible job!
Great barn find. That's triple the price or any other FD out there because it's stock with low mileage
Well I don't see nothing wrong with it at all except for the rims well I've seen a lot of those rims cause  if the brakes get wet but that's just my thoughts it's a pretty car no matter what y'all keep up the good work and have a wonderful day
So freakin perfect job! 👌
The explanation as to why it was parked makes zero sense. Why would the owner drive it 140 mph and then be afraid of the car and park it and never drive it again?
Love it. I had a 1990 GX FC all black back in 1994 and I own a red 1989 GXL FX that I rebuilt the engine in just over 10 years ago. Unfortunately it's been parked in the garage since due to financial reasons.
Beautiful car. Looks immaculate after the detail. Great job!
Brother that car deserves better brisket them that! That brisket looked dryer then my grandmas cooch🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Also a commonly overlooked thing those tires being 20 years old Plus definitely need to not be driven on. I understand leaving them for a collectors cool points, but anything older than 6 to 10 years for a tire is asking for problems of the disastrous kind
How do you get rid of your rodent problem in your car? Just let them live there for so long they die of natural causes. Apparently dorito power kills mice. They should call this car the mouse trap
Easy 60k car right there - he should put it on cars & bids if he intends to sell it.
Hi Man If You Don’t Mind Give Us A Random Figure Of How Much You Got It For
How much $ were you able to get it for?
Imagine having enough money to drive a car, get scared of it and just park it.
Okay, $30,000 - $60,000 👍 get video
EXCELLENT job, I thought you could not spray water or any fluids on the engine bay.
Amazing transformation. Id love to know how and why these cars are usually abandoned.
RX-7 Need For Speed Underground 2
Brings back a lot of memories growing up in NorCal in the 90's and seeing a lot of these, as well as the Supras, 300Z's, 3K GT's etc.  Hope the owner is changing the tires before going 140 MPH again.  Cheers.
Did you unplug battery before cleaning engine? :)
the most pristine condition i ever see rx7, ur guys just save a beautiful engineering of automobile 🎉🎉
Wow! Great job restoring this FD!  What about the FB that was also in the garage? Did you restore that one too?
Amazing Car 🎉🎉🎉
What part of ohio?
What an amazing find !!!
About 65 Grant
50-55k
should had painted the drum brakes
This car is magnificent
What about the car beside it
Idk...I call shenanigans! There is NO WAY those tires are that brand new after sitting that long. No air loss in 20+ years? No flat spots? No rubber rot whatsoever? Zero rust, in a non sealed garage? Clickbate man. Not cool.
That's going to be at LEAST a 120k car if you can manage to make that engine work well. A low miles matching numbers limited run legend like that? Raped ones go for 80k plus, let alone a show room new one! Sheesh
Hopefully you do the other blue Mazda too
what color is your rx-7
It has a Spitzer badge on it. You in Pennsylvania or Ohio? Incredible find I’m truly jealous 😅
yooooo this detail was intense.....I loved every minute!
Insane
that car, one owner, no accidents, 8800 original miles in the finished condition could bring BIG bucks on the collector market. what a beautiful machine.
Should definitely change those tires. Would be a shame to lose all that work to a blow out. Brilliant restoration!
Where is this car ? Is it for sale ?
45K or more   I want an Rx-7 but I'm only 13
Is the first gen for sale,
Awesome work!
Can we directly use the soap solution and water on the engine bay ?
You guys do brilliant work
U guys should see the YouTube of Dutch detailing company Stipt Polish point. They make everything almost like factory new. Check them Out!
well done, guys. the result is amazing.
Ready to blow up😎
Was that a 300zx beside the Mazda at the beginning?
Beautiful job fellas
Like a new car！
Awesome job!! You guys should do his other Rx7 1985
Reason why this beautiful car is stucked in the garage is a most shocking reason I have ever heard before!  It means this car was a just perfect condition when it was stored!  Jack Pot!
Much love from Uganda, I've always loved every detail done on your channel. This restoration came out absolutely flawless. much respect guys 👍
Are the tires not dry rotted?
Is that guy planning on selling this thing? Haha I'm in! You asked how much we think this car is worth. We'll in all actuality it's probably worth 10-20K. With the JDM market in America right now though I can see this going for way higher than that.
I would be concerned with the smell of mice poop and pee in the carpet
omg
Question is……….. how much for the car??? And beautiful job on bringing the car back to life.
did someone rescue the FB RX7 that looked in good condition as well
Why the winter hat ? Snowing inside or what ? I'll never understand young folks doing that. Might as well be wearing snowshoes as well.
It's looks like the car is still at the dealership, good job guys.
I’m new to detailing here in the UK, just wanted to say that I love your videos. Picking up loads of useful tips, techniques and well essentially the confidence to remove panels and seats when required. Than you.
What did u lightly spray on the engine bay to clean it?? Did u cover any electronics before u started spraying…Wanting to clean my engine bay but I’m scared of getting anything wet and possibly frying it
This car is a gem! Love 90's jdm cars!
Did you just spray water straight on the engine with the battery plugged in and the alternator not covered? You guys are morons
Thanks for a Nice video🙂Peter from Denmark
The mice didn't chew the wires because they didn't make them tasty then. The wires in late model vehicles are made to be supposedly environmentally friendly but rodents like the taste. We learned this when squirrels destroyed wiring in our vehicles causing $5000.00 in damages. Not sure how that helps the environment, and it definitely didn't help our wallet, but the auto shop was happy...
I am glad to see that gem restored and in working condition, I have one of my own that I also bought back in 1999 with barely 30,000 miles and it now has 93,000 original miles.( my diamond in a rough)  It has been an adventure and seeing yours an exact copy of mine it was for the best that it landed in your hands, having it to be a stick shift is a huge plus even though the console looks more of a 94/95 vs my 93 (but only mine being Tan over Black interior) but all beautiful and the value you will be surprised which I found out how these classics (JDM) are going for. (ranging $70K to as much as $150K) Fantastic work and enjoy that time capsule! PS I hope you have a vid on the 1st Gen too. 😉
Nice
The most beautiful rat nest that i ever seen.
what a strange dude to park a car basically brand new lol.  what a weirdo, how bout u dont drive 140 anymore
So what was the go with the other RX7??
Do u know what u found bro
What a beautiful job done Thank you for the video
What a find a brand new 23 old car would be worth a fortune 😊👍lol not even run in properly lol great job some collector will grab 4 sure 👌would love to see a follow up vid 👌😊
🥲straight pipe so it can sound scary
Beautiful. Still would love to see that 3000GT get done, it's white and those turn out amazing
who makes that car
Keep it stock then after a year the value of that will get high
Running condition with the mileage, I'd say $50-60k. I'm 95% certain that engine is going to need rebuilt sadly. Rotary engines do not like sitting 😮‍💨 Oh, and I have a 49k mile 98 GSX in my garage, just West of Youngstown, it's cool that we're "locals"
i don't understand this owner ,,this car is still a classic masterpiece nowadays,,
Less than 10k all original, no damage. On BaT this year a 5k mile FD sold for 105,000usd and a 17k miler sold for 90,000usd. I think you have a 6 figure Mazda on your hands gents! Oh and I can tell by the airbag it's a 94 or 95. The seats and the strut brace tell me it's the R2 model. That makes it even more rare and valuable.
I can only hope to get my 85 camaro to that kind of condition. The PA winters have not been nice to her

I don't care what anyone says, I do NOT trust driving on 20 year old tires.
The fact he paid for a car to keep in the garage instead of selling it. Wild, but made for great content
It's in sale ?
Rx7 have a story and this car its very scary.
Great detail, really enjoyed watching! My question is was the car running?  I mean sitting for over two decades there is no way she would run without some work.  Also, it would probably have leaks when it dors run as seals dry up over time.  Tires would probably be checked and have cracks.  If I was going to put a value to a car like that I would have alot of questions about the mechanical condition.
Even the mice knew the luxury place they have found.  They cherished their living quarters till death! 😢😢
Tik tok brought me here
ICE BLAST!!!
Well done my  My name is  Eddie from Eddies mobile car pro detailing like your content keep doing the great job in this business
20k easy. probably more. its a collectible now with low mileage. honestly idk how much you could get for it lol
you couldnt have found a better car to do this for.
Awesome work!!! Looks better than new!!!
Did u guya check the ac ventilation and air filter? For mice dropings and disinfection process inside the car? For bacteria
Is the owner interested in selling privately? And if so could you contact me
Omg it's so gorgeous!
Correct me if I’m wrong but is this car rare because of the miles? Because I know that people want these cars, but where I live there’s quite a lot of them getting around.
Going with the ammo nyc approach….nice!
Man, I would have been in there with so many Lysol cans
I can tell that you're listening to a Jordan Peterson podcast while you work... smart move!
Really enjoyed this video ! Any chance of getting the other earlier RX7 that was parked beside the black one in the garage and doing a detailing makeover on that ?
Excellent work gentleman 👏  That car was an absolute dream when you were finished! 🐊🏌🇺🇲
I wish I had the money to get all the equipment you have. If I had all that my detailing business would be going great
I wish I could get my cars detailed to that standard for a realistic cost. (I live in Australia) Nobody I know is that thorough removing wheels etc. and other bits and pieces apart to really bring the car back to its best standard possible.
it’ll go for 60k
I bought a car from a Spitzer dealership back in 2000. They stuck one of those huge, ugly advertising things right under the car's model logo, ruining the look of the car. I refused to take delivery or to sign anything until it was removed. They all whined "We'll lose our jobs!" I replied, "You'll lose this sale. You tell the owner to call me if he makes a stink about it."
smile
the only thing i hate about the RX7 is that i don't have one 😅
Am I the only one that feels like the carpet extraction was subpar? Nailed the wax and polish.
80 to 100 thousand especially with that low mileage
How much you bought it for
Superior clean
@tommyfyeah
Nice now throw a LS in it haha jk
Man this was so satisfying.  That car is incredible.  Looked amazing afterwards.  You guys really are some of the best around!!!!
can i have it please?   ;)
Nice detailing.   Cleaned up like a shiny new penny.  Not a Mazda rotary guy, especially one that hasn't turned over since "99.  Probably carbon locked.   Hopefully it's not turned over by the starter before those apex seals are lubed and broken.  I'd use 2 stroke mix a lil'bit down the plug holes and turned by hand. Or make sure the plugs are pulled so no compression  if starter is used.  Either way it's probably already locked up
Incrível demais wow oh my god beautiful cars  💯👍👏👏👏👏
Great job on a great car 👍🏻 It's crazy to think that your hand and that cloth  are probably the first things ever to go in that wee storage compartment in the back
Gg
Crazy ass paint transformation
Sooo fake
Mazda could literally just print money if they were to bring this car back.
Can i have it 🥺
He selling it?
200K car!!
Very beautiful work
You need a lift to get under
Seriously worth above 50K ! Bitchen content, thank you for posting ! FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ? are you kidding me ? you guys do impeccable work man !
Just a guess but 50k plus, idk
Nice job
Hands down my fave car of all time and happy to see you Gave it the royal treatment
Who else watched the whole video without forwarding any of it 🙋🏻‍♂️  So satisfying thank you for sharing
75k pre watching as I posted on Facebook
Amazing find  I'm watching this while I'm in the hospital God willing I get better so I one day I own one of these or any rx7 for that matter
What brand of foam gun do you use?  Thank you.
Saw this on a Facebook reel. Here to see this gem brought back to life.
I have an issue. How freaking rare and expensive they are. I want one despite the unreliability and from I heard lack of torque.
If it's as good mechanically as it looks now, 6 figures is not out of the realm of possibility. It would be the 2nd one to do it on Bring a Trailer.  Now do the first gen you left in the garage.
Hello Azerbaijan
Find the right collector and the car can get 40-50k for sure. Beautiful, running and crazy low miles. That’s a gem right there
Such a rare find.  Great job
wow i just realized that i have a rare car!!!
What an epic a barn find!!!
I love detailing, however my driveway is only spot I got..Is the steamer a must have for doing interior?
You guys really are the ones who add value to these cars usually you can watch someone and say you missed 😉 a spot but not you man really get down through there.
wow    priceless... great vlog
Replace those tires! Keep the old if the new owner wants the OE original. You don’t want your new investment to go sideways due to old tires giving out, need we be reminded of the old tires from our boy Paul Walker😢.
as cool as it is  we also have to look at the price reality,if the car sells it will probably go for around 70-100,then the owner will have a nice surprise of probably having to rebuild half the car as the parts are made for use,not sitting underpressure for 20 years,so wish the owner the best of luck
How could the paint be so swirled , inside so dirty , and everything thing else with only 8,800 miles?? I know it's old but the car never got drove.. something seems weird but it definitely looks great now. Great job guys
I don't know if I missed it but you don't trust 23 year old tires do you?  Is that one of the first things you replace is installing brand new tires?  Great videos!   🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁
Wow that's an awesome find I would love to find one like that I don't know what you guys gave for it I don't know if you even said but I can't imagine it being worth some the price some of the guys you're saying on here but I really need car I love them back in the day
Is the older blue rx7 for sale I would like to buy it
omg he got another rx7
Most beautiful car ever designed in my eyes.
really I love this car ❤️ Rare car Perfect condition Low KM  Shit I want 😭😂😂❤️❤️❤️
The nice job, looks like a new car. The owner should be blown away. Hopefully it will find a good home!
Take it to auction and who knows how much the value will hit internationally
Probably fetch $28k on carsandbids, has a manual that's a no brainer.
Don’t do those dumbass thumbnails of you gasping. You look like a little bitch.
Spitzer.   Pittsburgh car?
It’s so perfect as new before ! It’s priceless !
Excellent find, that car looks great!  I had to mute that music, gawhhh...it needs some heavy metal instead of disney music!  LOL!
Amazing find! The only thing that is worth less now on that car are the coins that you found.
Contact Jay Leno.
Question:  How long did the restoration take from inception to completion?  The end result is truly AMAZING!!!!!!  Loved it.  Ted McCormack Pewee Valley, KY
That mazda worth lots of money baby..if.I was back in good old USA I would offer the owner £40000.
Love this. This is one of my favorite detail / restorations of yours. Love how respectful you were of the cars value, documentation, and how you used less aggressive techniques to preserve the interior. Amazing job. Not sure how much the car is worth but you guys added 1000% to the profit. I would definitely consider buying this car from the owner.
WOW!!!!!  That is amazing!!!!  I found y’all while surfing TikTok by the way.  I’ve already subscribed and gave a BIG THUMBS UP!!!!  👍👍🤙
That story of him getting scared of it is bullshit lol
Amazing job!! This car should bring $100k fully restored
Love how you took the dealership badge off. It made the back look smoother.
Amazing!
What about that series 2 RX-7 in the garage also? 😮
In an auction, this could would be in the millions.   But an Rx7 with 100k miles is currently selling for 50k, and that one is in way worse condition than this one.
What about the motor?

Alan Spitzer might have something say about  taking that emblem off. 😉
I've been looking for one of these cars in original condition for quite some time. I'm also from NE Ohio where this car is located. Is the owner interested in selling?
@TommyFyeah would fully buy this from you guys!
R1 model. should fetch 80k plus
Is the owner trying to sell ? And if so , how much ?
We took one of these in trade for anew Audi, these are fun to drive but He'll to wrench on.
So...a thirty minute car wash and detailing video?  Meh.
I mean, I expected a restoration but damn, this is one of your best ones guys!!
Perfect job.
which is the 2 polishes you used ? which brand and types  ?
WOW.  R1 or R2?  Took me forever to find one and mine has about 90K miles on it... If its an R1 or R2 its worth at least 70-80k... A yellow R1 sold at mecum with i think 50k miles on it for 60k.
near 100k
IN South Africa. I will say it will still easely go for between R250 000, and R400 000 S. A. Rands, due to its rarety, Greetings Jan Hurter South Africa
Not just a car, but a piece of automotive history right there.  Even though it's not mine still I'd say thank you for treating her with this much respect. What an incredible transformation that was. Absolutely fantastic job. ✌️
best of best
Came here from tiktok...loved the video
Clean running fds are fetching prices anywhere from 41-45k sometimes even more depending
What about the other RX7? The blue series2/3? GLXE?
Amazing job. I'd like to know the fate of the aqua RX-7, series 2 I believe.
Nice job! Really should have changed pads and rotors while it was on the lift as the rusty rotors ruin the final impression a bit. But all in all, apart from that minor detail an amazing job!
With porn you skip to the good stuff, but with this you watch every single second of it. Well done!
AT LEAST $50,000
i dont live in ohio but i got a ‘93 eagle talon that other than a couple mechanical parts could use a clean and its fairly rare as only 20,000 were ever made of my specific trim. not sure if youd even be interested but i know one day id love to have it running on the road like new again!
Such an incredible transformation!
its great love it
Follow up series please!!!
lovely detail, i have been using dodo juice ifoam max for a while now, and wow, higly recommend it, especially for details like you guys do, it just works magic and gets rid of caked on dirt and grime, keep up the videos ;-)
this sweet girl really looks like fantastic, I really love it!
The other in the barn was an AE-86 Corrola! Real INITIAL D vibes lads! Too bad it wasn't a rotary tho.
Did you guys say you guys do this for free?
WOW! Incredible work, and attention to detail on the paint AND interior. I especially appreciate how gentle you were on the interior fabrics and carpets. Good narrative explaining each process. I wish I could send my classic Saab to you for a total detail. I look forward to seeing more of your videos.

Was not expecting that many dead mice… wow

At 15 minutes  I stopped watching Way to many commercials. You tube should make a different channel for commercials. Tired watch videos & in the middle Of an important video I have to watch commercials about something I have no interest in
140 and got scared😂I can’t believe this
The new shop looks great, congrats guys. Looking forward to more wheels off washes with that lift!
This is like an RM Sotheby’s example. Mileage that low means this car is basically a collector’s item. I hope you guys get to drive it after all your work. Btw, it would be cool to see a “Where are they now” update on some of your past details. Hopefully some of them got back on the road.
Who buys a sports car, gets afraid of the speed (while driving well over the speed limit) and then just parks it and ignores it for years? Seems... unlikely. Also, after all that time, the tires aren't dried and cracked?
Mint super low miles rx7 between 50-60k or more
I love watching your detailing videos. Other than all the ads 😩i quit counting at 63. What did you use to protect the paint at the end?
I have a golf 3 cabrio needs a good wash
With that low milage on the rx7 it worths a lot in JDM community.
wow the car looks awesome
Let’s stop copying Ammo NYC lol  Be original
So stunning. Even those original pirellis! Gosh, how do you even find these.
Awesome video. Could you please share the playlist of the music used? Thank you :)
That was awesome !!! Thanks guys
N.Z someone be asking 80k up I think
IN MY VIEW  First time seeing your video. Great job.
Im watching this as i eat my breakfast… mixed emotions while seeing the dead rats.. lol hahaha
Thinking fully restored. About 56k?
I’ve been detailing for a couple years and my favorite part about buying new cars is the first detail after I get it home and this would be my dream car and first detail
I would to hear the motor running . Maybe watch them drive it after it’s restored !
60k
Make it like dom car from fast and furious
Love it
Good work gentlemen. Only thing that I would’ve done in addition is, got something to remove the rust from the rotors/calipers. Great job!
The car with these low miles can fetch $55K +.or more. I had this exact car when I was young and I have driven it over 100 and it was smooth as butter and it cornered on rails as long as you had good sticky tires, but on the wrong hard tires it can slide on you and that happened to me but I got lucky. I loved that car in stock condition and I would buy it again with low miles to put into a collection.
I bet gas tank is rust and sludge.
Stunning
My dad has a 1996 vette that has been sitting since 2004 it’s in mint condition but looks like this thing
Whose Car Is It?
11:01 are you supposed to get the engine parts wet, doesn't it damage the electronics and stuff, thats my question because I want to clean my MINI Countryman's engine but I don't want to damage its moving parts and electronics, whats the best way I clean it safely.
Would you guys sell ?
Wow nice
The fb😫
What do you use for windshield cleaners
This car is a gem.... mint after all those years... Hate the steering wheel though.. get the JDM steering wheel
No not the alternator 😫
Y'all did the damn thang! I wish I knew how to do this to my car omg bae!
OMG!! that's my dream car 😍😍😍😍
1999 Mazda RX-7 with 8800 miles restored should get 38K TO 48K.
Owner’s a dweeb.
It’s actually rare to find these cars with low mileage
Car is easily 6 figures. Great work! I enjoy your videos
Nice! back to the shed now.
I realize your desire for “attention to detail”…parading the dead mice is really not necessary…keep up the good work…be safe
Should use some Atom Mac  by bilt hamber to protect that undercarriage
The Tires should be replace for safety purposes  as they are very old but do keep them for the collection
Man this is the dream car!!! It doesn't look to bad all in all probably worth 50 to 70k
Amazing find. Great car
I’ve done so many of these now, except my barn finds come from Japan down to NZ
I want this car how much?
Is this car for sale?   I would like to buy it!   I have 3 FDs but would sell all of them for this one!
Great video! Might have been mentioned already, but take caution driving on those tires at speed. Sitting for that long, they aren’t safe any longer.
Love you guys content also follow on tik tok. this rx7 came out beautiful and looks showroom status and I’d say be worth 40k possibly more with the miles on it also congrats on the shop space and keep the awesome work…
That dude should be in prison for letting that car rot. He definitely doesn't deserve it
I gotta garage kept RX-8 ya can come play with
Love the video but I hate hate hate the little brush to clean everything 😒  it drives me crazy and I know it shouldn't
Wow, great job.
I've always loved the RX-7. This time though to me I would take the first-gen that was next to this one. Years ago I has a 1985 GSL-SE. Great little car.  Awesome job!
There’s nothing like those 90s sports car! What a cool era. I love how you guys left the interior matte, looking so original and not all shined up. Great work!
1 owner, 8800 mile, black on black, R1 FD RX7… That’ll bring a TON!  Would love to see how the sale turns out/where it’s listed etc!
I’m not an expert, but in my opinion it will be $35-50k.
What happened to your arm?
this is not 23 years in the garage
Just use the brainless millennial VERSION and spray it all down and let get in the cracks to rott later
What is the soap solution you guys use? Then you hit it with steam? Wipe clean and use compressed air to dry?
BREATHE DEEP...PISS PARTICLES EVERYWHERE. PROBABLY IN THE VENTS TOO. THAT HOW THEY GET IN. YOU CAN NEVER REMOVE BY SIMPLY WIPING. IS WHAT YOU USE A DISINFECTANT?
Wow
Look at the mazda rx7 next to it. Fuk
Mazda is retarded for discontinuing this car
Nice work on the car.  Not a huge fan of the background music.
Круто, получилась новая RX-7, легенда!
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐💯💯💯😇😇🙏🙏
It’d be cool to do a run down of the products you use. Also an idea of what a detail like this would run.
60k
140 on a freeway yeah right that car needs a turbo to get close to 100miles what a liar
Clean the brake disc from rust,  it'll give a much smoother look. And tires have dates from it was produced and I bet those on the alloy wheels are from when he brugt it 23 years ago. Buy some new ones, there is less chance of accidents then
I want that car ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Muito bom. Parabéns pelo belo serviço.
I’m sure your email is filled with who’s the owner and how much he wants lmao
Damn.....😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 those factory body lines. 😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩 It's like this car came out of factory this year. Definitely a collectors item. Old things has art value. This is an art. So your pocket is like nothing.
12 thousand bucks
Dead serious: I'd rather have the '85 GSL next to it.
Are u guys from the Ohio area? I recognize that dealer plaque as a local car dealership!! Edit..  Yes I heard y'all are from northeast Ohio at end of the video!!
Crazy bro I'm not a car guy but we found 1 of these in a old house out here in sa tx
Engine cleaning? Don’t get me wrong you guys done awesome, however isn’t the way you cleaned that engine a tad on the risky side?
Considering that’s all original factory parts that has surly got to be one of the cleanest Rx7s out there (untouched or non refurbished). Good job
This was so much fun to watch!!!!!
The owner should take this car to a highly regarded rotary specialist and given a once over. Most shops don't know what to do with these cars and engines. RX7 Specialties is one of the best.
🌚
Loved the video I was wondering if you could do a garage tour on TikTok or YouTube I was wondering what you did for your floors cause I seen you were washing the wheels just right in your garage
amazing
Rx7 burn more oil than petrol 😄.     Still a fantastic car.
i want the rx7 so bad but i have no money and i'm 14 years old so it won't work😕
Y'all did a damn good job!!!!
He could easily get 50k out of that car
Beautiful work
Like why
Put that one back. The blue one next to it is the real treasure.
Great job
I had a 93. Glad this was a 94 or there would be no pain to restore. The 93s had paint that did not adhere to the primer. Mine specked flakes if you looked at it wrong. 94s are much more desirable than 93s. Prob get 50K from a collector for this one.
If the old man still owns I’ll give him $5000 for it. Lol but I’m guessing that probably how much you bought it off him for lol 😂
Does the owner know how much it worth? Because I wish I could have bought it. It’s 150k +
Did you end up cleaning the AC and heater business? My brother got a car from our uncle and when he turned on the AC full blast, some leaves started flying out of the vents because that kinda business wasn't clean. Awesome job though!
why dont you use dry ice cleaning?
Awesome
Love it
It's simple to get car to look dusty. Just parked the car at the side of the dirt road, wait for the dust to accumulate. When satisfied with the results. Use a trailer or a hauler. Hauls the car to anywhere you want. Have someone to guide and direct you. Even if you can't see through the windshield it's possible. This is how if I were to stage such scenario. Easy. 🤔🤔😂😂😜
Lmk when you have a cool car
Amazing work gentlemen! Hopefully the owner sticks some new rotors on this puppy or at least turns and paints the hubs on the originals, they stick out like a sore thumb.
Probably worth 40k. But some douchbag will buy it for 60. Drop 15k into it and blow the motor/wreck it and it will be at a co part within 6 months
Do a build on it
This turned out amazing
Tires had a lot of air after 23 years ……. I love these doctored and edited videos.
WTF? Awesome staged video. Note the tyres, should be flat if it's parked up for years. Even a daily driver is slowly losing air pressure. Try driving  your car for 3 to 4 months not checking, and maintaining air pressure, see what happens. How nice of the mice to stay in the glove box till dead without exploring any other parts of the car. By the way, the mice looked fresh. Should be mummified! No poop? Of all the parts of the car, the only part that the mice managed to chewed on is the insulation under the hood. How nice. Not very convincing. Somewhat  poorly staged. 😔😔👎👎.
From my decent knowledge of cars this RX-7 was in really good condition I have guesses that it’ll run between 60 and 80k
Why would you spray water directly on alternatot and battery in the engine bay!!?🫣🫣 before cleaning the engine make sure these things are protected from water!!!!
That was great! Gotta be so satisfying seeing it come back to life! I was wondering if you guys got to look at the other car that was sitting in the garage next to it!? It looked like a Rx 7 or Z car?
There are definitely mouse under the dashboard
Amazing job  guy's 👏
Former detailer here, not too sure if you guys know this trick, but for the badges on the back use some fishing line to get most of the decal off instead of steam! Ive never tried a steamer on decals but maybe its more efficient!
Amazing job 👍🏼
What a great transformation,
Went from a $100 trade in to an $8,000 retail piece in a couple of hours.
Beatiful car, nice job and great video
100k easy
If i had a FD RX7 ill put a 2jz engine or SL3 and put 2 pipes coming out the back
80k
Very nice video.  It made me go sit in my Mazdaspeed FD RX-7 that has been sitting in my garage for quite some time.  Too bad I'm not in Ohio.
So, you're out and about and you see one of your neighbors has an old sports car sitting in a garage. You call to inquire and he says, "Well, it's for sale." You don't really know anything about the model but it's a good looking car. After a few days a beautiful little black sports car belongs to you! "It just went too damned fast. It scared me," your neighbor says as he hands you the keys. You get a warm feeling in the pit of your stomach and it feels like you're blushing. "Oh, really," you reply innocently, seeing yourself blazing through a curve. "I think I can handle it."
Brilliant 👏
Great find and a brilliant detail! More JDM classics content please! 💯
Cleaning the tyres is wasted of time i think.
Soo beeen parked since 99’ and no new tires? Those one should be expire and rubber in pretty bad shape
Come on Mazda!  Bring this car back to the Mazda lineup!
Sadly, getting this running properly will be an absolute nightmare, I would almost guarantee. Amazing though.  Makes me upset cars like this aren't made anymore
@WD Detailing  Guys are you unplugging the battery when you're washing engine?
The tires should be changed re bro γεια.
First, I am impressed that the wheels spin.  Mazda brakes often swell and seize the rotors and or drums.  Second,, apex seals can also swell,, engine rotors do not always spin if left too long.  Does the engine turn over with the starter?  The starter on a rotary is huge. And,, I do not blame him for parking it after making a fast run.  Been there.  Done that.  140 mph in a 2,000 pound car,, awesome.
40 to 50 is the ballpark for that car right now. That car, along with the 300ZX, 3000 Vr4, and Supra represent a fun class of Japanese (almost) super cars. Kamikoto is everywhere right now, and that meat was over cooked.
Needs to be preserved!!!
@deadmau5
I can litterally see the apex seals dying
My question: if you didn't have a YT channel where you show these transformations, would you still detail cars for living, or is it worth doing only for YT money? Sorry for being this direct, but I consider similar "business" only I don't have a YT channel and I am not sure if it is going to be wrth my while starting all this up. Thanks for your good work and interesting videos.
What a great job-tremendous effort is good to see new generation kids working so hard congratulations are in order vowing my head.
Considering the car's mileage, shape, comes with original sticker and it's an R1/R2 model, I'd suspect this example brings $60K+ at reputable auctions.
I love that you kept in the original sound, it adds a nice touch to the video :)
This is your best transformation yet!  Sensational work!! @ 26:28 you can see the light that WD uses to light up the interior,  it spans the entire headliner, what is the make/model or link to such a light, I need one!!
How much is it worth? Not much. As the dumb ass owner let it rot 30 years and all the hoses and wiring is shit from the rats.
Hell I’ll take the 83!
Wow, next RX-7 saved. Very good shape and very original. I hate tuner cars. Such great ride doesn't need invention of garage experts.
My dream car..😮
My first time seeing the carpet getting clean without any brown mess coming up lol
Incredible work guys. The car looks brand new.  I wish Mazda and other car makers would go back to making cars that look this good.
Tires still good after 23years ?
Wow, what a fantastic finish from where you started out. 8829 miles loads of history with the car, if the owner is looking to sell I hope they get top $$$$ as most FD's have been modified by now & this is as Mazda intended 😜
Looks amazing!!!!
Somebody tag Rob Dahm in this ...
Ha Spitzer is/was a dealership here in Ohio. I pushed and zoomed in on the sticker to make sure it was an Ohio sticker lol
And don't wash tyres just change them straight away 💯
I am from Trinidad 🇹🇹 and I always watch your videos and I always learn alot from you videos👍💯
Just Chang discs pads oil filters and fluids and I say 100k€
6 dead rats ewww
I have one with 2,300 miles all original. I bought it brand new
He literally made the car go that fast and was scared of it? Makes sense.
Did yall replace the tires? I bought a car that sat for a long time and had a blow out from one of the tires, supposedly you're supposed to replace em every 7 gears or they dry rot and make it dangerous to drive incase of a blow out. So that would be my suggestion, my tires were still 90% new but since it sat for so long they dry rotted lol
Amazing work keep it up 🙏
I'd love to give u $5,000 for the car
Tires MUST be replaced at that age for risk of blow out and lack of traction. Please refuse to detail old tire like that.
I usually don't do this but I honestly have to say this car being what it is, deserved and needed a more attention to detail cleaning. Many areas were barely touched such as the under body, what's the point of using a lift for detailing if all your going to do is pressure wash the underbody? Lol the engine bay was just wiped down on the surface. Under the center console where there was guaranteed to be years of mouse urine and all you did was spray it and barely touch is with a microfiber lol and a few more areas. That shows your lack of attention to detail, care or knowledge. However the paint restoration came of amazing! So thumbs up for that. I hate to be so negative but I like to give my honest opinion and I gotta say I just simply don't think you guys deserved to touch this car. Such an iconic and rare car should not be treated like your everyday detail. I would love to see you guys do better in the future.
Brilliant work as usual.🎉
💪🏻
Perfeito♥️
Best restoration I’ve ever seen good job guys
Okay now that's absolutely amazing, I'd just keep it stock as is, at most maybe some new rims or something, then again an RX-7 on stock wheels doesn't seem too common, I'm glad there's at least some factory survivors out there, it's honestly refreshing. I'd love to see something come of that FB that was beside this too
He got scared of the car and just left it in his garage? didn't sell it?
Car should fetch close to 50k
Great video, personally I would have replaced those dry rotted tires. Also, pressure washing all those dust only will introduce more fine scratches. Always wash spray them with just garden hose first to remove the layers of dust then use dual bucket system with wool. A single wash will not remove all the dust…this is a double wash process….I would avoid those harsh products used in this video.  The pressure is way too strong to wash a car. You are not washing an asphalt.
I want this.
I hope the owner bought both of those Mazdas
The only dislike I have about this car is that it’s not mine. But I’d say it’s probably a $40k car imo.
What would a detailing like this cost?
I still can't believe people find cars like these in perfect mint condition i wish my grandpa had these type cars in his garage definitely amazing find
I want this car. Would the owner sell it?
My real question is not how much it's worth but how much did you pay for it. So did the seller get what it's worth
Deng RX7 R1
So satisfying,You guys are truly awesome and a pleasure to see the finished results  Keep up the great work 👍
Wow!  Someone got a winner there…. I wish this market wasn’t so crazy
I love FD Rx-7’s😫😫 prices are crazy though 😕.
I can see a car like this fetching a minimum of $50k if everything is in top shape, but with the 13b not turned over for so many years it can be a gamble. These are going for a lot in Japan now, the second generation rx7's are averaging at $25k USD now, and these third generations are much more valuable because of demand. Nice to see these cars being restored to it's original glory days. I remember back in 2000 I almost bought a pristine one for $13,700! I'm living with regrets now.
$65,000 all day with that odometer
Man awesome job fellas!!
i think its best to replace 23 year old tires instead of cleaning them..
Wow what a gem of a car, that’s going to bring 50k if he sells it.  Still one of the best looking cars ever produced.
Engine will need rebuild from aged coolant rusting iron plates and rotors
Damn been a long time since I've seen a Popular Equipment package on an FD. Car worth at least 80k in today's market. Be nice to find another forgotten FD like this. Seeing the OG Pirelli P-Zero S02-s tread brings back memories of me day dreaming of owning this car as a gazed at the brochure back in high school. I finally bought one in 2003 and still have it.
Great job
Bought from Spritzer? That an Ohio car?
?  maybe 60 70k worth if in good condition
OHIO!
Rxz2100
That Mazda RX-7 is so cool ! :D
$7,000 max
Only in Ohio
Great job guys! But I wonder how u wash a car inside the shop? Where does the water go? Never seen it in Europe before 😅
Beautiful find this car is going to be worth insane amounts of money
Bringing these old majestic cars back to life...wow
Great Job Guy's on the cleaning, washing and waxing the RX-7 Mazda..
This could be someone's next years SEMA project ?
Wow! Amazing job! 👏🏼👏🏼
love the outcome! great work as always!! maybe next time you'll find a toyota AE86 😁 just want to say mad respect to RJ, who doesn't seem to flinch when picking up dead mice, or that dead animal from the last video and those rat's nest!
Good work there's a liqui moly product for mice maybe you can tell the owner to use that I do have a question though when you wash the engine don't you cover any electronics or start the car or something?
Nice
Awesome job guys!  It turned out amazing!
That was sick guys...BRILLIANT RESTORATION. My only hiccup was that you did not use the steamer on the dash or door panals. With the amount of mice you found in that car, to me it seemed needed. But other than that...EXPLOSIVE!!!
The owner didnt realize you could drive the car under 140?  He could have driven the car all those years without being scared of it 😂
I’d easily pay 30k for it
What’s the story on the 1st gen next to it? Probably also has crazy low miles
holy time capsule
I hate cleaning.. its so much work.. Don't know why you guys did choose this to do.. for free yeah it looks good.. until 3 weeks later you can start all over
For me the most beautiful car from the 90's
That was the greatest RX7 Mazda ever built.  They used a lot of aluminum parts to keep the weight down.  The rotary engine was epic.
A average mileage daily driver is selling for upwards of 15k so I would think this car would bring over 30k easy with that crazy low mileage its basically brand new
that's my dream car , no need for more !  great find , great cleaning !   now give it to me :)
This car is so sexy in black 🥵 I’m glad you mentioned the dealer emblem. I couldn’t read it and was trying to figure out what it was
What about that second RX-7 of older gen sitting right next to it?
What a gem of a car. Almost unbelievable how well preserved it is. Probably the best candidate for a concours restoration I've ever seen of an FD  Edit: hats off on the care & attention to detail you guys put into the resto/detail 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Not sure how this detailing could have been anymore thorough or the video quality any better. Very impressive operation here.
Love this video, but just want to say be careful with that dewalt high impact driver on older or rusted lugs. You can easilly break nuts and bolts right off with that bad mamma jamma. I use the medium strengh driver on my truck and trailer regularly.
Even the rats were in good conditions 😂💀
My jealously level is through the roof
I am still looking for a 1991 Pontiac Sunbird V6 two door hardtop,, If any of you out there might know of one message me. thank You,,
You took the spoiler before taking off the dealer badge not after. We've got eyes 👀
The engine proved to be shit but everything else was good
Tommyfyeah about to pull up 😅
Super zachovalé autíčko
It's the 1985 or 86 for me that was in the garage.
in australia this would bring well over 100k prob close to 150k worth it ? not in my opinion , this would need every seal and bush replaced from sitting 23 years
To fully restore it you’ll need to do FULL service. Bleed the brake fluid, check ALL the plastic / rubber bushings, change the Oil, coolant, gasoline in the tank, blinker fluid etc. And ofc it needs fresh new tires.
So when are you restoring the FB RX7???
AN FB AND AN FC!?
Just going to strait blast the dirt and dust off with no pressure soak.... obviously not a professional.
What happened with the other RX7 beside that one (Blue one) ?
$39000
Proof that even mice know better than to damage such a great ride. Also mice are inside, rats are outside 😂
#tadorigem  Gabriel era um assim que querias achar e colocar no teu "bunker" 🤔😉😉👍🏼💪🏼
Time capsule. Nice work.
Such a rare find!!
Great Job Guys: That RX-7 Looks AMAZING!
And what about the fa rx7 he has How good does the engine look just after a wash
Why not brush the rotors?
Perfect
this barn find is absolutely crazy....I mean 8000 Mile RX7....holy moly....amazing video as always!
I'm getting a manual 2023 toyota Supra blk/blk, would the owner consider trading?
This car should be at Radwood
Guys this might be your best video yet! The car looks like it just came out of the factory! Insane!
What about head lights did u flip them up to clean them
Buy the car
nobody talking about that FB next to it...
When extracting the interior, how do you make sure the nasty smells are gone, and how do you introduce a nice smell??
Cabin air filter did it get changed
Great find,excellent work on the details and cleaning.
You guys did an amazing job on this vehicle.
Absolutely amazing
Both cars would have been great finds in that garage, FD and a FC...
Eeeee respect. Don't tuning, it's original car. Hello from Russia, American guys.
That dealer still uses those same badges on their new cars 30 years later! When I worked at an Acura dealership we used to trade Acura’s with them pretty often and always have to remove them
Ładne samochody🚗 masz na kanale  i w eleganckim stanie się trafiają można powiedzieć że jak nowe łapka w górę👍
First time on your videos i see People with plxeled Face like they dont like be on camera
Dayummm !!!!
I would do a full brake swap including brake calipers, unless if they still work very good then just paint them
The car could be worth at least $20,000
You’re only interested in the value of the car
Hey Guys, I am blown away from time to time when you guys find these cars that were bought and basically then parked with low miles on it for decades?  Blows my mind that someone would do that.  That's a lot of money to just have sitting in a garage moldering away slowly as a mouse hotel.    Nice job with the RX 7 boys.  I hope all is well with you guys.  Pete Hollister, CA
Effin awesome… thats a really rare find
I'd pay 500 bucks for it that'd more than fair 🤣🤣
Surprised no conditioner was applied to the steering wheel/shift knob leather or plastics. They are dying for moisture...
Tons of ammo🤔 140mph and parked to never be driven again 🤔 sound like it could have been involved in a crime… 🤷🏻‍♂️ 🤣
How did you find this ? and do you mind sharing what you paid for it ?
Is this car going to be for sale?
Is the owner willing to sell it?
damn I hope to be that lucky to find something that special one day!
Your details are always the most satisfying ever 👍🏻
Oh my!  I had an 1988 RX7 Turbo which I dearly loved.  Miss that car!  It was black also.  I had a choice between a Porsche 911 and the RX7 and I chose the RX7 because of two differences-price and the fact that the RX7 had an electric sunroof and the Porsche did not.  Plus having owned a previous years model in Australia I knew how they drove and handled.  Awesome car.  The non turbo isn’t quite as much fun tho.  This car came out looking fantastic!  Wonderful job.
Prob sell it on Bring a Trailer for like $60k
Amazing job fellas
Salute you from El Salvador in Central América
About $7000
Ok so could someone please explain to me why this car has a weird icon stock rather then the Mazda logo?
Why clean the tires though, they should be trashed by now.
With such ridiculously low miles and full paint correction I'd say between 60K and 75K. To the right person if the owner is patient - 70K to 75K. Good luck finding another in that condition with 8000 miles for sale.
All original 88k miles I'd say 40 to 50 k it's a turbo all original is not a lot around
I love this trip down memory lane. My Dad loved Asian sports coupes. My first car was a 280ZX. It competed heavily with the Mazda RX 7 & 8 and the Toyota Supra. It was a great time as those three companies tried to outdo one another. I’m happy you guys continue to be successful. Happy holidays!!!
The owner went 140 got scared and parked the car lmfao what a p*ssy
Gosh. $100k is realistic.
💯 mint good work guys big up 👌🏾     🤳🏾
This is my Absolute all time favorite car! You guys did a great job and I hope this video goes crazy viral and sends you to the top. You are lucky AMMO NYC didn't get this car cuz this is probably worth $90k+
Very very clean, kick ass find but I wouldve redone the breaks and rotors make this baby clean as all hell
Man, turned out brilliant! You guys truly rock! Amazing work!!!!
Very cool video I give you five star ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Brilliant
This car is very Beautiful very cool 😎 it looks Bad to the bone 🦴
Cool video
That car is worth about 100k in that condition with so few miles. It’s a highly sought after car.
Who's also from tiktok?
Pretty rx7 such a beautiful car
You smoked this one bro🔥
Perfect timing. I've been looking at FD's for sale the past couple days on marketplace 😅
how are you able to just power wash under the hood? can someone explain how it doesnt break anything im honestly curious
lets hope there are no dead animals in the HVAC system, did you check the cabin filter in the car for fresh air and rats in there?
Was this find in Ohio absolutely great job very impressive I can’t imagine what you could do to my 4Runner
if japan is known for their top-end steel why do they buy our old steel from years back does that mean that it's actually our steel giving them the name of good steel.
you need to check the date code on the tires
it's a Mazda how much could it be worth and it isn't that old.
That is amazing. I had a red 93 RX7 turbo hatchback. What I would give to still have that car. Sold it to a guy from Illinois because I wanted a 1997 Mitsubishi 3000GT. Hated the mits-a-bitchy ugh.
It wouldt surpsise me if the apex seals ars already bad because of it sitting
I hope this car stays stock as long as it can.
Let's goopo
Etrier de frein rouillé, ca te coute rien de mettre un antirouille noire . Bonsoir
マツダも何千台と売れ残った最終型を捨てなければ大儲けできたろうにな･･･
I love the restoration because it’s my dream car
I had the RX-7 previous generation to this ('87) and what a fun little car it was.  Not the best choice for 6'4" me, I felt like I had to unfold myself out of it every time I got out.
Did you find that car in south Bend Indiana ?
Love the video, car looks great!  Sure there is some surface rust on the underbody that should be addressed  and checked cause they maybe deeper. Otherwise honestly because it's been sitting it will need a full tear down and rebuild of the motor.
What's wrong with your left forearm?
The new shop looks great. This, by far, is the best detailing video you've done. You guys hit it out of the park with your thoroughness and attention to detail on this gem. Well done. Outstanding work.
Had two of these decades ago, I'd give a lot for this one.
Ohio ☠️
I’d go crazy with my price and list it at a quarter million.  $250k. Mint condition inside and out. A collector would love to have this beauty
...I'll give you 20% of whatever @tommyfyeah says it is...
I saw this on TikTok and had to watch the entire video just to see the end result 👌🏽💦
Tommyfyeah better get his hands on this
That car is gorgeous. The car was originally priced at about $27k back then which is about $40k in today's market. The owner could sell between $45-60k.. If I was making an offer, I'd say $50k. I'd give it a full mechanical check, upgrade the wheels and tires, and take it out on weekends. It's definitely a gem.
Love watching these transformations from you guys, especially on these older jdm cars!   If you guys have any trouble with paint correction, try working smaller sections, it makes a world of difference. Always a little surprised at the size of the work areas in the videos but I suppose the results speak for themselves so who am I to say anything 💁🏽‍♂️  Anyways, keep it up guys!
Realistically if you restored it to its former glory it could go from 20-60k
So cool!! That thing is definitely gonna need new tires lol
It's worth over 20k in that condition when it's all restored and all original miles
You are my favorite channel for car detailing and restoration. Not only do you do awesome work, but you seem like really good guys, also. Thanks for showing so many of the steps in the process, like the center console, the spoiler and especially the engine bay. The car came out looking incredible and hopefully the owner will be motivated to get it running and driving again. Perhaps, if you have time, you could post some additional content with updates on some of the cars you have detailed, especially of them running and driving. Keep up the great work! You guys are awesome!😁😁😁
Is this in Ohio? I've seen the Spitzer dealership emblem
Waste of water...
May be $60k-$70k
You should've used a medium bristle brush and manipulated the seats the old school way. 👊
100k
That car is easily worth $60,000+.
Awesome video!
I'd say 80k+ the the right collector
Looks beautiful good job 👍 🙏👍🙏🙏🖖
A clean FD with that low of mileage could catch upwards of $90k.  A 2200 mile second generation 1989 rx7 (FC) sold on bring a trailer for $60k.  Seriously, these things are gold mines among the rotary community.
I have a 2018 Buick sportback I would love for you to do this too!! I dally it everyday! How much do you charge I’m in Massillon Ohio
All do respect! Nice barn find, but that’s way too clean still. Feels staged.
I hope this car gets left stock.  It'd be a shame to turn it into some Fast and Furious wannabe.
Last year (telltale passenger airbag only available in 1995) R2 package in perhaps the 2nd most desirable color (Competition Yellow Mica will always be 1st) in almost NOS condition (apparently 100% complete, it even wears its factory Pirelli P Zero tires!) should be worth at least $80K. I wouldn't sell it, I'll enjoy it until it's worth more than $100K, but I'll make sure it's insured for that amount.
agree....When I buy a car the first thing is to get rid of the dealers logo...
Absolutely stunning work!
Gorgeous car one of my all-time favorite Rx7’s wish I could find something like that great job as usual
What this car is worth is really going to depend upon who you bring it to.  The open market, it is going to be seen as a 28-year-old car, and any issues with the 1994 model that haven't been addressed by the owner will detract from the price. But to a JDM car club, it's going to have a lot more value.
That car's worth a bazillion dollars now !
Wow! I think that's worth at least USD20,000 now.
Is the car for sale ?
WOW!  Looks brand new.  Heck of a barn find!!!
Although I can't stand the engine itself, the physical bodies of the Rx series are beautiful. Nice work guys
The owner is very fortunate because if I’m not mistaken, that’s an R1. Haven’t seen an original R1 in a very long time. 👏🏻 Kudos to you guys for bringing this back to life. Even if the engine needs a rebuild, the authenticity of a very low mileage R1 can fetch some serious coin. I wouldn’t doubt it can sell between 50-70g’s US. Everything is there and it’s all original. 👍🏻
Is it for sale? I'm very interested @wddetailing
I don't understand why you wash the rubbers of the wheels. After 23 years the rubber must be deteriorated and will burst when you walk with them. Isn't it better to change them?
I think it is worth 40,000 dollars or more
Not a huge fan of soaking the engine bay, but overall very well done.
Well firstly I believe the price is around 7 to 9,000 dollars. Secondly Love the vid. Can you guys can do a 1973 Datsun 620 truck? It will keep me inspired to get one myself. Plus, if you know a good engine that would work that would be nice.
Nice video , one of my favourite cars out there. Also, Kamikoto knives are a scam sorry. They are from Hong Kong and pretend do be Japanese but their quality is super sus.
Great work.  I see most people just go crazy with the power washer.  You go in a pattern for better coverage.  I don't understand the owner.  If he was scared of the car at 140MPH, just don't go that fast!
Well done lads. Spoiler off too 😉  You could have done a 10 minute slow mo around the car and I'd have kept watching.
All it be up for sale? When and where?
23 years old and the carpet quality is better than my 2 month old car
Easy 6 figures at mecum
I would keep it
Wow !! Would have loved to see it running ! Awesome work guys !
100k
High value, I’d say somewhere around 80k and I’m sure that’s even low. North of 80k wouldn’t surprise me on bring a trailer
Next time capture owner's reaction 🔥
Not a huge fan of dealer badging either but it’s been on there so long you might as well leave it.
What do y'all do with the vehicles afterwards
Job well done guys😊
Man probably bought it for two raspberries and a paperclip when it was new now hes gunna make a fortune 🤦🏽‍♂️
I would say about 22,500
I’m Gonna say between $60,000 -$80,000
Im interested in buying the blue 1st gen, is there a way to get my in contact with the owner?
4 years before you were born? *cries*
how long did this take start to finish?
I test drove one years ago. They were quick! The rotary engines l, the Wankel, were, well, interesting. Lol
My favorite car on this channel, by far... I'm a huge fan of cars from the 90s, especially JDM beauties like this one. 🔥
When do see that lovely M2 being detailed
150grand
It expired on the month and day I was born in Ohio 🤯
$80,000. Beautiful job.
I live in indiana but would be glad to drive my car up and have it done
Are we going to ignore the fact he had a series 3 rx7 right next to it?
Beautiful work!
This is an outrageous crime and I'm not even an import guy. Sorted out this car will be worth major money!
can you give some insight into what a detail like this would cost?
Reading every comment? Meow
One car owner, 8k miles, solid paperwork, sh*t, I'd start the reserve bidding at 80k. I could see this reaching 100k + at the right auction.
I wanted to see it start 😪
What was the deal on the other RX7 in the garage? Buddy of mine had one just like that growing up. Same color too. 🔥
That’s a 80-100k car easily. A Black 94 r2 is a rare car especially with the mileage. Good luck!
I hope you get to detail the other car in the guys garage
Would you make a trip to Dayton?
The condition of the car the low miles and a one owner with paperwork would be an excellent candidate for Mecum auction should fetch a pretty penny
That FB would have been a better barn find
I love being a JDM fangirl :)
🧼🧼
Seeing that Spitzer dealer emblem reminded me of my 1984 GT I bought right out of HS in 1987, had a Spitzer emblem which I promptly removed as well.
Excellent work!
Any chance you could give my 07 Z4 some love? I’m an hour north Toledo
That’s easily 90-100k on bring a trailer or cars and bids
RJ, did you buy this car ? It's a good one to buy.
Guys, again: Can I give feedback? It's kind of upsetting/sad when you guys show the dead animals... It doesn't add anything to the video... Of course, my opinion.
60k
That was amazing!  I would pay good money for this car.
Dang the flat spots on those tires
Easily 50-60k car 🤘🏼
Even the mice respected the car 😂
Gd job but ur not supposed to clean the engine it destroys the battery and the memory brains of the car over time
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
You guys do a great job.   One tip. Editing and commentary.   You took off the dealer badge, and then next comment was ‘after that we took off the wing’, but the video still shows the dealer badge on while you walk off with the wing.   Knit picking I know, but my OCD twitches.
Gorgeous! The market for import classics is on the rise so, this car is going to fetch some SERIOUS money if the owner is intent on letting her go to a new home. What an amazing find!
I would take it to auction with a reserve of 30k and let the market decide what its worth
How do ppl. Come across such gems!!
Brilliant!  Looks like it just came off the showroom floor.👏👏👏
Bad ass car.  Great job!
I mean I'd pay $1500 & I'm taking all the risk...I gotta get it framed, I gotta have my guy do some things to it and it'll probably sit on the shelf for months.
93model
Great job on the detail holy cow you guys rock
I’m sorry but I gotta call 🧢 on this one. For a car sitting so long….tire were in WAY too good of shape and almost no dirt could be seen going into the extractor. But a beautiful car!
As a mechanic I’d say that suspension was a good shape for sitting that long 👌🏼
There are RX-7's listed well over 50 grand with 30-40k miles on them.  This man is sitting on a gold mine and probably didn't even know it.
Awesome 👌
These days you could get $50k+, although I hear prices are dropping a little as of late. I'd put it on Bring A Trailer or similar. It will bring a good price.
Amazing
What an absolute gem of a find! Definitely a beacon in automotive history demonstration innovation and timeless designs of the era!
One of my dream car
Easily 100k on bring a trailor
Loved it my dream car!!!
60k +
gorgeous car. one of a few cars that I want
Great video lads. What a great find, I don't know what it's worth but it definitely worth more thanks to your great work.  Can you explain the flooring in your new digs sometime?
Every comment!?!?!
Nice when the mice realize the value and keep their tenancy respectful 😂 great job!
Did you guys get the other car in the garage too?!?
Cómo cojones dejas ese coche así 20 años?? Dios da pan a quien no tiene dientes...
I cringed when he took off the wing and then sprayed water into the screw holes which sent water into the trunk
Put clear coat protection over the paint
Most normal restoration in ohio
Tottally liked the video but I would freaking love to see it without music
Black Beauty !
Excelente
No me digas que con el mismo guante que agarraste al ratón partiste ese delicioso corte :(
Take the engine out and clean it
Looks like an 94-95 r2 fd rx7. With low mileage, if this thing runs and drives it should fetch over 70k. I'm happy with my r1 fd rx7, no complaints here since mine is only almost hitting 23 thousand miles. Any fd is nice some people just have a preference on certain years and models.
Beautiful job.  Love the car.
Jealous I didn't find it but so happy it's being saved
$50,000
“Scared of his car” what he do next? Buy a stock Miata ? 💀
The channel has grown so much, great work, I remember when you hit 100K, now its about to be 400k. Thanks for making such great videos! 😎🤠
Dang, I would have known before that this was for free. I actually have come across multiple gems in garages before. I don't know any at the moment, but I will keep ya in mind. Thanks.
Saw this on tiktok, can’t wait to see the vid through!
What a gem
Great video, the car is an absolute gem.
Does this car run??!
The car came out really good.  You guys do a really good job.
Looks great 👍,  you brought that thing back to life.
I would put the car with not a lot on the motor I would say 45k to 52k maybe more and I hope he changed all the fluid in that car before starting it because it sat for so long running old fluid could really mess that motor up to be honest I would have cleaned the motor qnd put nee plugs in it before I even thought of starting it but that's me
Sitting that long believe I woulda put new tires on it..
Ok this might sound very dumb but if you spray water or any kind of liquid in the engine bay and it gets on the battery would it do anything bad ?
This maybe the coolest car I’ve seen you guys detail I hope the owners faces his fear of this car and gets it bacc on the road
I had a Mazda Rx- 7 just like this one wonderful cars y'all did a great job 👍🏿 cleaning it up.
The fact that he had another RX-7 right next to this one says all you need to know about the man.
I hope you didnt leave any water where the spoiler attaches , could screw it up
Vero GOOD job🔝🏆💪🏻
50k upwards if this was in Aussie/New Zealand
60k
As the owner of a BB R1, there are more of these cars out there than you’d think. Seems like every month or so I see another USDM sub 10k mile car.  FYI, this is a 94 R2. One of 156 in Brilliant Black. This car, with the correct presentation on BAT, in spring, could set the new record. Kind of a bummer knowing about the mice tho.
Amazing video . Is this car for sale ? How can I contact the owner ?
Cool Story, Does the car even run??
still has the Spitzar Mazda dealer badge on it lmao....Ohioans know
I dont know anyone as professional as you guys in detailing cars. If only we had that professionalism in Ireland
I’m here from Tiktok
100% Quality, nothing less 👍 Paul🇬🇧
Pro Tip:  ALWAYS pull the carpeting in cases of mold or animal infestation.  That is the only way to ensure you've removed everything.
I Guess $25,000
Wish this thing was in my driveway
I would have applied the foam soap prior to the pressure wash and again after...
The initiative put into bringing cars back to life is something else. Hopefully most of these cars get shown out there to the world and not back in a barn. Excellent work guys 🇿🇦😊
Awesome car. Are you going to do the blue early rx7 that was parked next to this one??
50K all day
Que trabajo tan hermoso
Probably 150K
There are two 😦
Who came from tiktok too?
I was a sophomore in high school in 99.
Good job guys, the car looks minty.
My dream car 😍
I'm a Mazda guy and I love this particular car. And only 8,800 miles! What a gem. Great work as usual guys!
I would contact Dennis Collins to get a fare appraisel of that vehicle He is a U tuber....
what product do you have in the pump sprayer you used in the engine bay ?
Great restoration on the Mazda. I wondering what the word on back of the was, I  thought it was a type of  RX7 at first. Lol
1. Tell us the products you are using. 2. You should have scuffed up and cleaned the brake rotors. The rusty rotors detracted from the finished car! Brilliant to the rescue!  Love your work!
Next to the the toyota supra and nissan  300zx. This was the car to have
Great job...I would buy that in a heart beat!!
Well done for showing us a cracking return
My neighbor son had this same car. It sat for 10 years. It had a blown head gasket.  People offered him so much money. He eventually had to call his son to come get it. Lmao 🤣 🤣
How much u wanna sell it for
All these estimates are way too low. A 5k mile base model FD3S sold on bring a trailer not long ago for 105k. This looks to be a 94 or 95 Black R2 model which is one of the most sought after because it has the hardtop and better suspension. If it's a 94 than it's 1-156, and if it's a 95 than it's 1-18... Any 1995 FD3S is virtually made out of unobtainium, my guess would be 90-100k
Bravo sir ,, what was the total hours on this job ?
That is practically a brand new car. I would guess the value of the car is somewhere in the neighborhood of 35k and up.
Beautiful as always. It's basically brand new
0:42 @ 140 mph, humm.....may be he saw the Ghost of Akina AE86 drifting behind the mirror and then he got the Keisuke moment that possessed his car
I dislike this car so much because it's not at my house
Now is probably worth 100K
This car should fetch a pretty penny after a few things get checked out. Would hook up a boost gauge to ensure the sequential system is working. Boost should be 10psi down to 4 during transition then back to 10. If that isn’t happening then all the vacuum hoses under the intake manifold would need to be looked at. Would also do a compression check to ensure apex seal didn’t get damage since rotaries don’t like to sit for long periods of time and seals can get stuck to the housing. After all that gets looked at then I would put it on bring a trailer.
Brilliant detailing. You lads really put your heart and soul into this. I particularly enjoyed the 'real time' clip when you were detailing the inside. The sound of the brush emphasises how clean you get the car. Thanks again lads.
I saw your TikTok video and decided to follow you on both platforms
Probably gonna be Worth a high five figure or a low 6 figure
Es una reliquia
Such a beautiful car. I would love to own this and an nsx one day.
I had the exact same car , god I miss it 😢
At the most it's worth $40-$55 grand
Easy 40k
Hey guys when I saw this car I fell in love all over again. My aunt had a RX-7 in the pearl white, looked exactly like it, and I wanted it!!!
Those rotors are rusty lol makes me want to replace/ restore them 😅 🤣
AMAZING job!!  Cannot believe how clean that car is.
This channel is getting very annoying with the load of ads and paid advertising.
Tik tok
To the real FD purest meeting because it still has the original rotary motor and the low mileage I’d say minimum 20,000 starting at the right auction possibly over 50,000
Not gonna start it up ?
1million dollars
Are you keeping the car
45 to 50 thousand
👍🏾🔥
Wow!! What a transformation
Can someone kindly fill me in on why this car is so special?
You guys are awesome．Your attention to detail is unparalleled.  I am completely impressed on how you were able to turn this garage find into a showroom beauty.
This thing is easily worth 35k+ in this condition especially with the miles
Impressive results
100-120k
What's the mileage and story on the early Rx7 in the garage as well?
Didn't cover the alternator up.
Hey guys! How are you?! I just started watching detailing videos again and I definitely have a lot of your videos to catch up on. (Don't mind me, I'll just be over here binge watching your videos from where I left off a while ago 😂) But like I remember, you guys always do a fantastic job on the car and your videos. I love that you're still killing it! I'm also curious to know how long this detail took with how thorough you were.
Still one of the best looking cars ever made 👌
10:47 - 10:51 Badge off , on , off
$15,000
What a beautiful auto.  Especially after you guys did an overhaul on its appearance.  Great job.  Bet the owner could fetch 60K$
Wow, what a difference
That is a sick car but I can immediately tell, the hazmat suit says it's not safe.
Bravo...bravo guys ! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 What an incredible detailing ! 💯💥 Oh...and Brent ! I hope you and your bro RJ are more careful by using anti odor masks, and other protective gloves, cause the stench of a rat urine is extremely sickening and can cause you respiratory problems ! So be very careful guys when dealing with these kind of barn cars !  Cheers guys ! 😄
Guys, love your channel and projects, but please stop with the dead animals parade.
Excellent find excellent condition  awesome detailing on the street these cars reach 50 Grand and above and that condition a car with that low miles and Excellent condition on a dealer's lot would reach up to 75,000 think they were rated 255 Hp good luck guys nice find I got a 1984 GSL  love the first gen Fa/Fb I  hoping  too see that GS  detailed next 🤔 ?!
sitting that long this engine will need a rebuild most likely.   Super cool bar find though
I follow you on tiktok
Beautiful Garage find~  I would say that that Mazda would probably retail today in upwards of $30,000 as it sits right now!!!!  If I could afford it.  I'd make an offer!!!!!
Oh, my please, please sell this to Rob Dahm.
are we all just bypassing the fact theres an fb right next to it?!
Q maravilla
أحب سيارات مازدا لقد تعلمت القيادة على أحد أنواعها 💙🖤
I wish I could have it……
Crazy how many of our dream cars from the 90’s are just in someone’s home abandoned lol
The new shop looks great, congrats guys. Looking forward to more wheels off washes with that lift!
Great video brother ..... Is the owner selling it?
All of that absolute for free?!! Nah bro the amount of detail you put into cleaning that car is worth at least $1000
Great job I think I car is valued at $ 52,000😊
Like a new car. :)
Best video yet! Shop is looking good and liking the new toys/equipment! 👍
Bro ask this old dude if it’s for sale you know I have the cash to buy it
This is like an RM Sotheby’s example. Mileage that low means this car is basically a collector’s item. I hope you guys get to drive it after all your work. Btw, it would be cool to see a “Where are they now” update on some of your past details. Hopefully some of them got back on the road.
Outstanding, Gents! Immaculate restoration! If I’m the owner, I do something about that rust in those brakes. Love the vids!
That is a good car Still under factory warranty
Epic find!! Came out fantastic!! Makes me miss my FD!!
You should partner with a competent mechanic for a mechanical restoration video.  This car will need *a lot* of work to make it road worthy if it sat for 20+ years.  I love watching mechanical restoration videos where oem parts are used 😍
Got scared of the car because it hit 140 mph?  You know that accelerator thing on the floor?  You don't always have to push it all the way down.  (Although for some, it's instinctive.)
Looks brand new. Great job guys. This car is a timeless beauty
$10k on the car
This one was very cool to watch. I just did a client's 1986 RX7 convertible. It was in phenominal shape but needed a deep detail. I did damn near the same as you guys so the owner can list it on Bring A Trailer. It was such a fun detail, finally having the opportunity to have an owner say "I want everything, and I mean EVERYTHING detailed!" Fantastic work fellas!
Brilliant 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
FD's are such cool cars, I probably wouldn't pay more than 30 or 40k for it, since it's basically a new rx7, nut there are quite a few people who'll pay upwards of 150k for it
I used to had rx 7 back in 2012, very memorable car, the engine,the curve,the way the lights pops up. What a great times.
My favorite Hot Wheel car growing up was a 1979 Mazda RX7, so this car is an awesome find! Actually the '79 is a similar body style to other older one in his garage. I hope we can see it detailed, too! I have no idea what it is worth, but given its low mileage and condition, I'd say at least $50-60k minimum. I was a teenager at that time in the 90's and modifying cars was THE thing to do to you vehicle, so finding this in stock condition, should greatly increase its value. Awesome car and video!
Os produtos que você usa, consigo comprar no Brasil?
Really nice work. Very satisfying to watch.
😉🇵🇷
What waxes were used
$60K
I’m the 1k like‼️ Great detail per usual✨ and id say roughly between $30-40k
Looks great guys! Another top-notch performance.
What about the other abandoned rx7? I would like to see it on the channel!
Rotories don't like to sit, hopefully the engine seals aren't dried out, may have to rebuild the engine
TommyFyheah would love this rx7
Can you guys do a video on a pick up truck next pleasee pleasee
I just love your way of cleaning.. And being inspired by you guys I use your few methods also while cleaning my pickup truck at home...
WOW! To find something like this in unmolested condition, with under 5 digits on the clock is nothing short of phenomenal. The majority of these and their counterparts from the other brands were butchered by the "fast & furious" wannabes. Similar year Supras, when bone-stock, are selling for $95-100,000 at auction. I could see this car bringing that kind of money with the right crowd in the audience. Another fantastic job, guys!
How much was that lift ? I’m looking to invest
40 to 50 k if engine and everything works fine. With the rx7 first generation in the garaze did you do anything?
This Gen RX7 has really nice lines. I agree with some of the other comments, I'm thinking the value is somewhere in the 50s to a collector.  Hell of a find, and it's like a time capsule inside and out. Really nice work!
Super luxury car and great working
It’s a Mazda rx7 right
Whoa, the wheels were just finished and then you revealed the whole car detail during the sponsor ad 😳 😢
That GSL next to it looks nice too.  What a find.
What happened to using all MAD products?
omg that car is legend 🤤 she so sexy I remember when she in gran turismo game wow I think that car is the best in Mazda
Great find, RX7 FD is a treasure, I loved RX7 cars so much.
Wow 😍
That was a brilliant restoration, I was particularly impressed with your wheel cleaning gadget that allows you to rotate the wheel to clean it thoroughly. poor little mice who seemed to have lived and within the car, the poor little fellas probably died of starvation, anyway, good job guys🥰🤗👌
I just did a quick search on KBB using my zip and it said there is “Info currently available”
I’m curious why you don’t take the glove boxes out and check behind them for mice nests. They come out fairly easily on most cars.
Hard to imagine the tires being ok after sitting so long. Beautiful car
Gonna need new tires.  If the owner was scared of that car in 99, it will haunt and kill anyone today with 23 year old tires.  As for value...in the right auction and market MINIMUM 50k.  Prob double that given the mint condition and the fact it was just sitting in a garage.
Based on mileage, condition, and current market. I think it's worth $50,000.00
Очень жаль( такая машина должна ездить
Guys why u don't detail and the other car near to the rx-7
I hope they keep it. These is closest to getting a brand new FD that I can think  of. What an amazing find
Engine probably needs a rebuilt
tommyfyeah some where rubbing his hands like birdman probably hoping this car is for sale lol
Great video and a great car! Spitzer was a family of dealerships in the Columbus Ohio area for many years. Keep em coming Guys!
Мазда ,👍👍👍
My best guess would be atleast $20,000
Absolutely stunning that black is like ice. What us the value now after detail & low milage??
for sale?
Under 10k miles, one owner, in black, 100% original, this is a $75,000 vehicle.
My new favorite video so far😍😍
Excellent job  ...much like these barn finds detailing...continue please...hi from Hellas ( Greece) the most beautiful country on earth
Did you take the car for a rip? lol
Literally my ultimate pipe dream to find a barnfind Fd! This is awesome, good job. Given the fact that it’s such a low mileage car, untouched and manual, i could see this car fetching 60-65k. Maybe more, maybe less. These cars have been going for insane money the last few years.
Overrated car,,,,,ive had one .
2 RX7 damn Saw my first RX7 in person and it is really sick
I have 1989 Model suzuki car. 800 cc.Please exchange it with my car.good offer for you..Ha ha saeed Ahmed from lahore Pakistan
Steve finds all these deals. He'll make $40k off this car
How much you want for that 😏
How did the hatch area look so bad? Spare change, receipts, trash, only 8800 miles?? I have 11000 miles on mine and it looks brand new, 8800 is nothing he was barely in it.
Seeing the other RX7 in garage detailed would be nice.
You need to wear some spandex while cleaning those cars.
i love the 7, when i first saw it in X-Men 2 (it was Cyclopes's car and Wolverine stole it)...  question for you WD: "with all the new products and tools that created and relesed, if you could go back and redetail a car you did in your pass...which car would it be?"
Really random question, but I always check when cleaning out a car, what year were the coins from?
Awesome
Ohh my god, like a car directly from dealer. Is that single stage paint btw?
👽
The RX7 I thought the battery was always in the trunk
Here in Malaysia this care are worth US25,000 in our currency Rm90,000 to Rm100,000 depends on the condition
I don’t know much about rotaries but I know they absolutely do not like to sit. The apex seals in this motor are probably shot and it may need a rebuild. That aside, this would easily sell for 50k - 100k.
Are you going to restore the other car in the garage?
I enjoyed this transformation, that car is probably worth over 10 grand
At 8800miles… some dummy would happily pay 100k lol
Dashboard part?
You just made my Saturday morning my friend 🎉
The videos are oddly satisfying.  Thanks
What a cool car you find out,I hope you'll clean the blue car as well
I loved how the car came out in the end result! but I couldn’t help but notice the beautiful bimmer next to it. Who drives that??
No idea what it’s worth, but I’ll hazard of gas of around $50,000. Love this car. Would love to own it. Great job on the detail, boys.
Nice work, guys! Being all original, I would guess 20 to 25K in value, maybe more for a true collector. You just made me a fan of the later gen RX7, used to be staunch first gen guy...
All cleaned up I’d say probably 50-60k really clean
Great transformation guys.  Liked the real time interior shots that you mixed in, nice touch.
I will trade my 5.0 + some cash for it right now.
Easily my favourite vid of all time
What a car man…
Hey guys, great video as always. You mentioned in the video detailing the undercarriage. I have a classic Trans Am that I am going to restore the undercarriage this winter. Can you recommend a product that I can spray on bare metal that has flash rust on it and it will remove the rust or convert it chemically to a state that the metal can be painted. If you can give a quick step procedure on how I can clean and remove rust, prep metal and paint to protect the parts from rusting again. Thanks guys!👍👍👍👍
I like your guys's videos but can you guys do when you guys use your materials to clean your the cars can you guys put it in the video so we can know how to use it as like you
Where do you get your hand brush man?
Amazing video!
My dream car, I have owned 5 first gen RX7's one second gen, and got to test drive a 3rd gen when it first came out due to an awesome connection with my local Mazda dealerships mechanics and sales staff. I bought a 83 GSL sleeper from one of the the mechanics that looked like absolute crap but was hiding a very well modified NA 13B and suspension, it was a hoot to smoke flashy but poorly tuned Hondas...
It’s so much more enjoyable to watch you work on cool cars. I’m not a fan when you clean cars that should be in a salvage yard.
nice car . good job WD detailing .
I'm not much a JDM person but both those cars in that garage are rare and worth alot of money.  Especially the blue one hard to find anymore.
Great find. Love your content.  Enjoy watching every Saturday.
I’m definitely interested in buying it.
😃👍 Great Brother good job ☺️ 😊
That’s a hell of a find!  Nice job indeed.  I’ll do 3 easy payments of $49.95!
im already here watching
I would take both of those cars
Love the content boys keep it up 👍🏻
