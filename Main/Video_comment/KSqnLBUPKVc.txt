Which one? All of them get "slain".
You should interview them to get their takeon this issue!
Never heard of him until he was murdered.  But, that is how I usually first hear of a rapper.
"what he did for us and the state". WTF?! They're LITERALLY celebrating the life of a low-life criminal🙄
ABDBAB
We gotta stop the culture of violence in the rap community. It's just dumb and not worth anything.
Such a shock, out of nowhere, never could've guessed.
Who was he??? Never heard him.. is his name supposed to be lil takeoff though?? The Lil's are always the no name ones who die
We lost a person who poisoned and corrupted society the turn out is just a testament of how many people are infected and sick & too stupid to even know they are bewitched by spells and made slaves of that evil wicked so called "music"
Ignorant rapper won t be missed.
Oh, I'll have a Coke.
#trash  #gayasfuck  #mumblerap #mumblecrap  #noloss
Fake ass people love to celebrate someone death rather than celebrate their life.....
Looks like takeoff took off ! 😂😂😂
Modern day minstrel show.
Takeout took off
Lol he doesn't even know you all. Or Eve  care. He was a rich gang member that died by the gang. That's what he would have wanted.
All I ever heard was this dude rapping about car, sex ,drugs and money. I never heard him speak on anything positive in our community nor for the benefit or wisdom of black men. Other then life in general, I cannot see the lose here, but only God can judge.
Wow I’m guessing he helped so many families in Atlanta and contributed to 3rd class, if so good for him.
Take off took off  Hope he left behind a message of positivity
Is it normal that this many rapper are killed this frequently?
This isn't news. Who cares....
Where are the candles for Connie Tuori?
First I thought she said a "Lil Wayne can't stop them"
sorry NEVER HEARD OF HIM🤷‍♂️
I heard there were a dozen drive bys during the service. A twelve gun salute!
USA is over populated with low i.q. humans.
Hip-hop is cultural rot. I feel for his family
Who the he'll cares....
Another rapper dead.. jesus christ. I'm still hurt about dolph. May satan sexually assault all those who took the life of a rapper.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
No clue who he even is!
Rappers get what’s coming to them! To many of them preaching violence
Looks like he didn't"takeoff" after all, only "fell off" a 6 foot ledge.
Who????
Mind in state property please respect a person mind.
closed  casket im asuming ...how come nobody talks about how they chopped his hand off?
So, who is this guy and why is he so important? Seriously asking. What is it that he did that was so special? I have no clue who he is.
Why this hurt so much?
Rest
Most rappers end up dying of lead poisoning. Somebody took out Takeoff. Seems to go with the territory? 🤔🤔🤔
So very tragic!
🥳
Who cares.
Why don't they stop kill each other if they gonna do a stupid celebration
Who is this ?
This is so Sad 😞
Dude died literally fighting in the streets.  Now you pretend to celebrate 🍾 " life " ya"ll ALWAYS A DAY LATE
Do Not Let Them Get Away With This! We Need To Speak Up And Speak Out ABout This And Get Justice. Do Not Let The HPD Sweep This Under The Rug. Time To Show Up Atlanta. Time To Show Up Community! #JusticeForTakeOff   #ProtectOurLightworkers
Where are BLM? Help your community out smh
Just another dead rapper. Killed in a crap game. What was a "rapper" of his magnitude doing at a late night crap game out on a landing of a building? Hood is as good as.
damn this feels so unreal….. Rest Easy Takeoff, let the rocket fly  aye
Monkey see monkey do
RIP Slowdown jazz hands. Booger landing gear switzel.
This one hit different
Ok, and?
My condolences to all his loved ones Too sad
My 💔goes out to the family and friends to this amazing and talented soul sending my condolences and prayers to the family and friends sip you will be missed but never forgotten sip 💔💔💔🙏🙏
"To honour what the man has done for us" .......what did he actually do?
He will be sadly missed. May his soul rest in perfect peace
Music industry: How can we sell Crap? Public relations people:   Leave of the "C"
A thug is memorialised as a saint.  Sound scfamiliar rom this same community.  A multi felon, deadbeat father, addict, dealer and violent home invader...Was made a saint.  Funny, SAINTS USUALLY were people who REPENTED of their ways..NOT embraced it as a lifestyle.  Black people have problems BECAUSE of these sort of actions.  Memorialising a pimp who used you?   Pathetic
Such a loss 💔💔😞
Not one mention about his killer ? Or investigation?
That man was the most humble but he had bars that could shake anybody🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🏽🥺❤️‍🩹🕊️
ADIOS MY MIGO TAKEOFF 👋
https://youtu.be/gq3zHKEUGOY

Be safe out here. The rain and traffic is ridiculous. Welcome to Atlanta if you ain't from here. Now go home 💯

He was a young vet in the rap game and I'm happy he was laid to rest on veterans day.

R.i.p takeoff
Was the Prince family there ? Asking for a friend
The money need to go to families who were impacted by the gun violence. Giving to an agency to prevent is not possible in this day an age of unrest.That is putting money in the wrong place.
People from all Round Georgia came to pay their respects
everything not for consumption
My prayers are with take off family my condolences prayers going up R.I.P. TakeOff  fly high 🙏🏽🕊🕊🙏🏽
I give my condolences to takeoff family. I will keep everyone in my prayers. So sad RIP takeoff.🙏😢❤️
RIP Takeoff 🚀🚀🚀🚀💔♾
It doesnt seem real man. We loss a giant. RIP
Rest peacefully take
The wicked and evil 😈 will turn into hell for this ugly action. RIP
SLEEP SOFTLY LOVE🤍🕊
I truly appreciate that the family requested that there be no cameras or smart watches. Its such a shame that photos of his deceased body were leaked online. This generation has no respect for the living or the deceased.
It's so much hurt yet so much love being shown for Takeoff. Too bad his farewell couldn't be shared with the rest of us who wish we could be there. We love you Takeoff! May you rest in peace 🕊️ Justice will be served. Love, condolences and prayers to the family and straight to hell to whoever took your life. Sending hugs and healing vibes to Quavo. You can never unsee what happens before your eyes.
if the hole world. Would come  together  for church service like this. in the right place. ( God would smile  )
Takeoff is Atlanta. 💯😔
😭
I came up during the " Beatles arrow and for them to be called The modern Day Beatles this phenomenal that means they won the people over.  RIH YOUNG ONE SORE TO THE SKY AND TO THE HEAVENS ABOVE SORE YOUNG ONE TAKE FLIGHT 💔💔🙏🙏
😢😢😢😢😢😢 so freaking sad. He didn’t even get a chance to grow old. All the memories & future events with his family and friends, never going to happen because of some pure ignorance. My condolences to his family and friends. Gonna miss you bro.😢
