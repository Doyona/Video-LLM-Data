Got to 6:23 and set the playback speed to .25. That goal was onside, I don't get how VAR didn't overturn the offsides call. Should have been 5-2!
This Dartmouth Boss said I bring second team vs sheriff's and it's done he have to be fired it's not surprising sheriff's beat the Real Madrid last year small team big spirit
those rangers kits are slick. really like them.
Dortmund is such a loveable club but supporting them would be such a chore, they are so disgustingly inconsistent and unreliable.
Ask yourself this question: If Haaland plays do Rangers still win?
If anyone knows a young kid that’s afraid he’s not good enough to play soccer. Tell him to ask Zagadou how he became a professional without ANY talent. And I mean no talent once so ever. My god how can someone look at this guy and give him any money to play soccer?
Meanwhile Celtic got clapped at home by Bodoglimt LMAO.
Dont know his name but imo this referee is at least top 5 rn
Some things r in the wrong order CBS

If that's not abuse, then I don't know what is.
Zagadou had a very bad game last night
As someone who grew in a Celtic household, I had biggest smile when I saw this result
Ryan Kent with a stellar performance 🙌🏻
Ryan Kent , guys going to be world class !!
Poor Zagadou, poor Dortmund with no Haaland. Well done Rangers and 2nd leg match will be worth watching...I hope!
Someone translate what Morelos said in the camera
Why was the stadium so empty?
Stadium looks empty lol 😂  Trash team
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates- 🎈
Dortmund is deaD
Yo how have i not heard of Ryan Kent in England international team talk? Am i living under a rock? Was this a one off performance not telling of his usual play? Man is a menace on the wing.
Incredible man, I fell in love with 09-13 BVB,  not the mess that is my beloved team now. We’ve become the Manchester United of Germany which is unfortunate, it’s bs that BVB loses this bad even against pos lower rated teams too. The defense are shambles, Hummels is getting older and he needs help the other 2 suck. What made us into a attacking side was also our fullbacks the Polish Piszcek and Błaschikowski were good at what they did, even Schmelzer was decent. Reus is older too, I mean we need a whole revamp.
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤
omg more https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Krla_UxRg
haven't watched Rangers in awhile. I forgot how nasty Ryan Kent was sheesh.
That third goal was beautiful
I’m a Celtic fan but always back the Scottish team in Europe! And what a display by Rangers😮! Well done 👍
Alfie yelling WE ARE THE PEOPLE BITCHES! in Spanish after scoring. At least my Mexican coworker translated so.
It’s only 2-0 rn BVB we can do it
BVB whole back line needs to be thrown away, Hummels is horrendous, he doesn't doesn't try, he's always out of position, he's slow, the RB cnat defend a cone to save his life,Zagadau seems he can't even read and cover space, not to mention he's poor air skills.
Zagadou might be the worst CB I have seen this year
Football is easy and not complicated - when you overdo it you leave/lose the simplicity and efficiency!
How do Dortmund expect Haaland to stay when they can't make it past the Champions League group stage and then get smoked in Europa League
Zagadou is such a fraud. I’ve been seeing him play these past few matches and he’s been terrible. Not man marking properly and given away own goals
The Dortmund of yesteryear is truly gone. This is disgraceful
ryan kent, what a player
He's here he's there he's every fucking where Roy kent!
that assist by Kent 🔥
All respect for rangers but Dortmund’s performance was very poor
Rangers need a new goalkeeper. No way they can't find someone for over a decade now
Haaland needs to leave this club if he wants to move his career along. They need a huge rebuild
Ryan Kent. My word this guy is a TALENT.
Zagadou = Maguire in disguise
Jeez Rangers and Celtic fans are loud as fuck even when they're away from home lol
Ngl fuming at the description stating "Wonderkid Gio Reyna" takes away from actually talented kids like Bellingham, Musiala,  Rodrygo, Saka, and more just because he's American doesn't mean he's good at football smh...
Messiest game i ever seen lol
Ryan Kent was absolutely on fire
Embarrassing
Zagadu is the best defender there is just one bad game. Remember his athletico Madrid game diego costa didn’t have a single highlight. No worries 2nd leg
Seriously.  Bundesliga is farmer's league.  Trash teams in there.
Jude Bellingham man one word ...  BALLER!
The atmosphere at that second leg in Scotland is going to be off the charts now.
Missed this game live, but wow Dortmund's defense was just ball watching. Next year can't come soon enough.
Kent was cooking 🔥.
BVB = Yellow Spurs
can somebody translate what Morelos said at 2:59 ? all I heard was puta lmao
That guerreiro goal sheeeeeeesh
Sad
bundesliga stinks
This proves what we all knew...SPL > Bundesliga.
Do they think putting 7 repetitive ads in a *HIGHLIGHT* video is going to make us stream/pirate these games less?
Idk why people think dorthmund is a good club lmao the last time they was good was 2013
zagadou is absolutely atrocious ive only ever seen him playing terribly
Rangers scored 4 at Dortmund holly fuck
What a player Kent is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
And Bellingham said that Bayern needed referee's help to win Dortmund?? Lol, Dortmund is a joke.
Dortmund has just been a complete joke all season smh
Is it just me or is the quality really bad
Way too many ads on every clip why?
Dortmund defense looked wide open.  Fair play Rangers
What a game
The mighty ranger are back.
HSV & Rangers <3 commmme on. Glad for u boyz. Stark
Rangers could have won by a few goals more.  Ryan Kent is pure class.
Kent will tear you apart…..again!
Tbh u have to feel for rangers cause remember away goal rule doesn’t work anymore and halaand will probably be back u never know
Lundstram 🐐
How on earth do u lose 4-2 to rangers like cmon now
If kent was foreign they would be creaming over that .
So glad to see James Sands am playing for Rangers in the Europa League. But Reyna, needs to step up.🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🔥🔥
Morelos really said  “Put@“ 😂
The only positive from this match was Bellingham performance and Guerreiro shinning as always
Can't believe how that weak celtic who spread their legs today before norwegian teenagers could defeat this machine in old firm derby. Rangers is much above scottish league with their top players. Well done, Gio!
How tf can Dortmund be so trash like this?
I don’t understand why doorman fans still pouring money into the organization. Doorman is a selling team, not the winning team. They develop youngsters and sell them for profits. The fans can keep dreaming and hoping that the team will bring a trophy.
Dortmund’s defense is a joke!
Dortmund has such terrible defense. They had many terrible league games too.
Liverpool needs to save Bellingham
2:10 What is Van de Beek doing with the Rangers fans? Lmao!
I fucking love this. fuck dortmund
The third goalscorer from Rangers should've celebrated with Kent. What a play
What’s up with these big German teams lately?
Dortmund want to lose because they want to focus on Bundesliga and nobody cares about Europa League.
Dear lord sell zagadou. He is the worst player Dortmund has ever signed
Superb victory by Rangers ❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍🙌
Thank God for VAR. Sorry ass linesman... How tf did you see a damn offside... I hope borussia get smashed worse in Glasgow
2:57
Morello's  3:01  🗣️"Puta" 😂🖤👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Go rangers ✊🏿👏🏿🖤🇺🇲🇨🇦 #Kent #YNWA 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
make me dortmund manager plz, i promise i can do better
Ryan Kent proving he's not only OP in FIFA
Well done Rangers, but we all know the second leg is going to be a great game, cant wait!
Akanji and Zagadou are two of the worst defenders in all of the top 5 leagues
Why don't I believe this....
nice
This was an embarassment from Dortmund. Sule alone wont fix their terrible defense.
Rip 2012-2013 bvb dortmund 😢
Time to sack marco rose
Ryan Kent needs more respect
Huh? So how is that a handball and penalty but a couple weeks ago a Middlesborough player gets an epically obvious advantage from a handball in the box and no whistle? No consistency in this game.
I thought it was the round of 32
Well done Rangers, representing the UK with a brilliant win 🇬🇧
Zagadou: handballs, fouls, faulty challenges, 1v1 fails... Absolutely diabolical
Don’t know which difference it’s worst ManU or Dortmund
Zagadou with a nightmare of a game gave away the penalty had an own goal. Rangers deserved this win the 2nd leg will definitely be one to watch
Zagadou is so bad 😂
What a win for Rangers! 4 goals in one of the toughest stadiums to play away in. Morelos and Kent are such great players and link up great! Dortmund need to tighten up defensively and looked so slow in this match. Good game from both sides
Why is nobody talking about that Bellingham performance
Let’s see if Haaland will stay lol
Zagadou pulled a Maguire
No Haaland, no party
Embarassing couple days for german football
Dortmund has so much money but never spend just always sell smh they can buy some better players especially on the defensive side
Get rid if zagadou and malen
Change the coach. Please appoint the former coach back. He did outstanding job last year.
Dortmund are a shit team . Haaland need to leave asap if he wants to be one of the greats
Right in the Borussy 😔
I wonder what Morelos said after he said scored the second goal. All I caught was puta
Embarrassing, humbling week for the Bundesliga.
The fact that UEFA abandoned the away goals rule means there’s still a chance. Haaland better be fit for the 2nd leg because that was downright atrocious from Dortmund…
just throw the whole defense away
WTG Rangers... This shows how weak the Bundesliga is...
No Haaland no party
This was so embarrassing from Dortmund.  GG Rangers.
The 10 hour flight back won't seem so long, congrats to the Rangers!
Chef Ramsay would be proud
Football is pretty cruel. Almost a decade ago Dortmund were league champions and UCL finalists. Now they’re getting clapped by Rangers.
Marco Rose out!
Dortmund’s defence is absolutely atrocious
Zagadou was absolutely atrocious holy shit.
WATP!
Famous win for Rangers. Dortmund have been shocking all year
Change the coach
No Haaland, No Dortmund!
Hi ayo
