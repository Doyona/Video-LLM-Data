Gee still the shii😮‍💨🔥🔥🔥
I'm the trenches trying to get richer
Ion got no sympathy for no one ignoring what I'm preaching
Make me wanna get rich
But that's what i been saying they going to end their world because it's citizens across the world whos never gotten sick or wrecked or never alot never had to fight probably didn't even have to pray they just believed in a higher power.... And probably is like me and never had to go to the hospital unless someone made them sick
Right i confuse them by saying im fine because i don't want a mansion but the right thing to do is run me some of my money because im financially free
Dude otp who been locked up Gee always talking bout said don't legendary shit💯💯"ain't giving up on this end, ain't breaking down or nun"
Only real nigga related and you ain't one if you cant

Damn how many rappers he reference in this
Bro looking like the black undertaker on the thumbnail😂
literally liked the video while the ad was playing I ain't have to hear it to know it was hard 🫶🏽
The way Gee brings his soul into his music shiit unreal you can’t help but to feel every word ⚔️
You shook off drugs thats all on you, not god or no human got JuJu dust that strength is from within.  When i learned I am seen through one of my biggest fears was people would copy what i do as dumb as that seems to me cause my word is always real and raw but really prob best if you just close your eyes cause the picture I paint is a test meant to challenge your mind.  A trap of sorts, my greatest power.  Jealous and envious ones  hear the word and know they cant come close so they get the picture in focus and start comparing themselves and think they are better then me.   Many will look at what I dont got: money, a girl, etc.  They dont realize I am drowning in love and rich in spirit and I just hope my voice or flame lets other be inspired or ignite a torch to make a message of their own. In the end aint about me, I am just doing what I do, this is me, yall out there producing and working and hustling in a way that inspires me so thanks.  Dont worrry about substance I have no problem in that department but when they steal my kid and tell me to jump through a hoop to see her I raise a middle finger cause I aint negotiating with them.  Peace.
“you’re welcomes but no thank yous got me thinkin like thank who? most that shit was fake. but i do thank god for his grace and makin me starve so i ate”💯

The Greatest of all time frfr
I'll comment here since it's the top of the list: Your ad was unskippable through the opening profanity. Thanks for the loss of privileges at work, despite trying to play some ambiences. I blame YouTube for it's systems as much as I blame you for choosing to create such "art". Flow is so much more enjoyable when it's intelligent, not when it's laced with words designed to sting and be hurtful. And forcing that on viewers...?
Call Captain Clay out in the ocean with this fishing pole
If you from Louisville you know he talking that shit literally, putting how we talk into a flow and rhymes, home of the great Muhammad Ali 👑
Give dem boys some to look forward to forever solid 🦍

Lol this video 😂😂😂😂
it is people like you who are pushing this evil agenda (like the puppet you are) to are people with negative words you rappers should be ashamed letting the white man use you to manipulate the way we think and go about are day to day lives and it is so sad that a lot of us cannot see the bigger picture because the majority of us who listen to this type of music were born into it so it makes it a 10x harder to think outside the box. I hope a lot more of us can wake up and take the blind fold off and see the world for what it really is😕.
real shi at the end💯

Shoutout Goddessence, Satan and the DARKSIDE....  Dump the clip on jesucks if he comes back....  god is really Adolabroth aka Gadre'el... And on top of him reigns the true Goddessence known as Sophia(Pistis Sophia)... Don't forget too that jesucks I mean jesus is really Oserapis(Osiris + Apis) later on known as Serapis. Yet the term jesus didn't hit the stage till about 1620 so y'all really worshipping Zeus/Iupiter(Jupiter)... Even the Spanish folks say jesus as Hay-Zeus.... It couldn't be more obvious.... A Ptolemaic deity invented by Coptic priests to pacify the greeks who had invaded Egypt/Kemet and wished to be worshipped by the Egyptians.... Shout out Arius, the real Arian who saw through all the BS... All these religions are relics of the past, do your research and get informed.... The realest spirichuality lies within.... These religions are carrying around crumbs and broken promises...   Satan is an Egyptian God. Respected just as much as the others. You need to embrace the Darkside. Don't be fooled by these European concepts of so called spirituality through the religions they have fostered.... Many of which they learned via the Kemetans/AfriKans/Egyptians.....  SET. Source of the name Satan. The Kamite God SET was the God of Drought, Darkness, Negativity. "SET gives name to Satan as 'Set-an': 'SET'.... is the destructive power and 'an' in the Egyptian language is a mark of emphasis." Heru(Horus) bound SET in chains.  Knowledge is power. The bible is a joke on the subconscious if you don't pick up it's metaphysical aspects that they have purposely put forth, so out of touch with the real ancient 'Mysteries'.  You have the right to remain deceived..... It's your life...
Gee has created his own lane that only he can move in,truly a gift, I want to tell you to get EM GEESKI BUT YOU ALREADY GOT THEM KEEP PUNCHING CHAMP!!!
If it ain’t young shiner, what do you call that 💥

Music is to the ear what good food is to taste  If the N - word is very offence to black people possible not all.  Why would you use it in a song as if it's symbol be proud of. Now I know that friends my call each other names that are not used in the public.  Music is art perhaps do a song about big bad baby daddy's not supporting the kids or perhaps a song on Baby momma crying for more money from baby daddy's.  Don't understand the song but is it disrespectful  If a while person made a song like this would it be disrespectful
🔥🔥🔥🔥

A million in 24 hours the goat
G the realEST
To be undefeated takes work and class acts. A spiritual belief system is made on spiritual growth and development.
Dis first degree murder 🔥🔥🔥💯💪🏾
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think this is when he sounds the best, when you can hear him clearly without those adlibs repeating the line
Did yall catch est gee confession he said, "I ain't no motherfuckin' preacher, I'm more comfortable with demons." Wow to be a  person that's MORE comfortable (relaxed around) with demons, means u has given ur soul to Satan.  1 Timothy chapter 4 reads God's Spirit clearly says that in the last days many people will turn from their(believing in christ) faith. They will be fooled (tricked) by evil spirits and by teachings that come from demons.
He’s definitely the hardest…. Only the real ones F with Everyone Shine Together

This is fresh, to me I feel like it's 💯 EST but you can tell Yo Gotti sprinkled on the beat at least, which is a good thing. If I was a talented young rapper I'd feel like i hit the lotto to have someone like Yo Gotti as a mentor/homie however you want to see it. Yo Gotti is a true representation of a person that is gifted at the craft but also has a business adaptation to his craft. Take Tony Hawk to skating, skill undeniable but he built a brand or Jordan to basketball arguably the GOAT but those shoes and his imprint on industry goes beyond talent/skill. Greatest rapper is extremely subjective but Yo Gotti has put his imprint, what separated him from the next is what he is giving those that are next, the ability to build a brand. They say you are who you're friends are. Or you want to be great surround yourself with greatness. EST, Mozzy, that list will build. If I tried to rap I'd sound like doctor suess on a good day, but if I were established or building my way I'd be damn happy to be linked up with the yo Gotti s
