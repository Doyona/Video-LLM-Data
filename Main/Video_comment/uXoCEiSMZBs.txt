After you Both’s marriage you need to invest on building up a land!✨🌸
Does anybody knows the buttercream or whipped cream recipe?
My toxic trait is thinking I can do this lol
You did a fantastic job! How stressful that whole car ride must have been for you but you made it all work!
you look blurry with this camera like out of focus
What's the story behind "girl" .. her necklace and. Tattoo
Les I love your vibes !! 😂😂😘
Que linda
Can you please tell where you are from?
Amazing job!! Just wondering where you found both types of the balls? Making a similar cake for my cousin. Thank you! Awesome work!
That's such a very cute bear cake. You did a great job. As a baker, I will suggest to use a cake carrier to protect the cake when transporting it. Use a cake spatula and one hand to lift the cake or add another layer to the botton cake very carefully.
Thanks for showing about the balls, I always see people cover them and found it. But making them dipped in chocolate will make it so much lighter and easier thank you
Hey where did you get the balls from?
Hi Les!!! Was wondering where you bought those gold balls or what they are called so I can find them please and thanks 🥰
How did you make the buttercream!? And where did you get the filling?!❤️
To slow busy
The cake looks really good an cute..🤓🤓😂
Les your hair and make up look so good 😍🥰
Where do you get your jewelry from girl??
Wow !!. I'm very impressed because driving three and a half hours . You did it  Les !!  I'm going to call you cake Boss . Beautiful work Les . God bless you and your beautiful little family. 🥰❤🥰
Omg Les you are so talented! que guapa eres  te felicito 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗

Does anyone know where les got her dress from? 😩
I live in Hobbs NM.  Looks so good.
Where is your dress from 🤩
Does anyone know where did Les buy her dress??
what buttercream frosting do you use?!🤩
Just wondering, why you don’t make your cakes from scratch?
You are absolutely talented 😭
So beautiful 💚🤎💚
What frosting does she use or does she make her own ? Does anyone know what video she may have talked about it
I livee for your cake videos 😭😭
I love how talented you are! Beautiful, funny and sweet too! Me encanto!
Did anybody else get sad thinking that she had already frosted and put it together and it was just the styrofoam? No? Just me? 😂😂
omgg i was so scared for u i thought the cake was going to fall 😭
You should definitely make a dessert Instagram page so ppl can order from you because all your cakes are soo beautiful and yummy too ❤️ Don’t y’all agree like she needs a bakery Instagram page!! 🙏💜

Lmao ahhh she gives me a good chuckle how she pronounces her “f’s” on words that don’t even have a “f” in it!!! Hahahahaha…. When Les said “achieef” (her facial expression unsure if she pronounced it correct) lmao aka “achieve”!! Lmao so funny! 😂 🤣 😝  I remember one of her old videos in her and Alex’s first apartment together, how she said chef 👩‍🍳 Alex kept trying to correct her but she kept saying it wrong lmao 😂 🤣sounds cute how lil babies sound when they are first learning to speak their first words!!
This was such a beautiful cake

Vanidosa sabe lo q trae
Yo vine x su pechuga
Anyone know how she makes her butter cream?
What recipes do you use for the cakes?
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Aww I loved the outcome! It was beautiful 👌🏼🤍💚
So CUTE!

Love you beautiful 😻

Girl you made that bear look so easy to make 😩

Love it sooo planning on starting to make cakes you hella have motivated me
Les, get you some heating cores for your cakes. They serve the same purpose without leaving that big hole 🕳
I absolutely love your baking videos! You make it look soo easy.  I had a rough day today at work and just life…. This video made my day ❤️  $Jaclove90
We need more videos!! I love watching your videos ❤️
Much lovee les !! 💗
I've been waiting for this video all week! Always makes me want to go bake a crazy cake for literally no reason lol.
Love your baking videos!!❤ so talented!! Also, we need another cooking video with your mom!!
i felt like i had to put on my glasses to see this video lolll
Les please tell me what you used to hold phone above view on counter!?😫
Loovveee these videos😍♥️ Just what I needed to end a long day! 🙌🏼
Hi les! Fellow baker here. There’s this really awesome small business company located in Texas called The Sugar Art. They make amazing powder pigment called master elites and theyhelp you color buttercream, royal icing,  fondant, etcc.  And you use a very little amount as they are activated by water and give you the most awesome colors. They also have a glitter called diamond dust in a bunch of colors that is actually 100% fda approved, and kosher and not made of plastic like disco dust is that is sold in most cake supply stores.
You were in Hobbs and that’s were I live so sad I didn’t see you:(
Love your blogs baby G so handsome 💙
Les you get DOWN 😍😍😍 I love watching all your cake videos !   Alex : uhh was that supposed to happen ?   Les: just wait hold on were going to fix it   He was low key more nervous than you haha 😅
😍😍
Stop looking at the monitor and look at the camera. It drives me crazy lol 😆
You’re so beautiful bruh🤍!!
😍😍😍😍😍 Next time put the cake in the fridge overnight they are better too transport and handle and if you stack the cake cold u can just put a dowel in the Middle through all the cakes and the board and then take it cold and stacked
Love thisss! 🥰🥰 I missed your cake videos! 😊😊 you did such a great job!! 💚
Cake and cooking videos are my fav!!!! Lysm
I usually skip through promos on videos but les just make every sec of the video count. Honestly se puede grabar echando pedos y lo escucharía como AMSR 😅😂
Me encantó el cake 🎂
I been waiting all day for the video !!!love you less!!!
I'm not criticizing and I know this is only 2 seconds I'm watching but correct Baby Gs behavior of getting into everything. It seems as if you all let him "unload" everything he can get his hands on. Stop the "silver teeth activity behavior" before its too late. Lol
Missed your old blog videos  what happen?
I absolutely loved the cake my favorite so far 100% love you guys
The cake was too cute!❤️You killed it!
Hair and makeup on point.
Love the cake came out really cute you're just amazing bendiciones less for you and you're family
Les making a whole fake cake just so that the real is perfect 👍 that’s dedication
I love cake videos 😊
It looks beautiful
Do you make your own buttercream icing? If so can you show us how ? 😊
Wow that cake was so beautiful!!! You’re so talented Les 💞 I couldn’t stop laughing at the part where you added “casi se me sale un pedo” 😂😂😂💀
I love it 🥰
Omg I want you to make my wedding cake and baby shower cake actually every event you’re so damn talented les love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Perfection 😍
Les how do you make your buttercream? Also I love the black hoya so Mexican style 😍
Oh hell na youtube unsubcribed you from my account ?!?! 😭 but so excited for this video 💓
I love your videos 🥰
Your videos always put me in a good mood. 💜
Okay I see you Betty crockerrrr🤩🤩
Awwhhh I’m go to Hobbs, New Mexico this weekend 😞😞😞 i wish we could be there at the same time.
Super talentosa lesly 👍🏽
You were in my home town and I’m so sad I didn’t see you anywhere!! 🥲🥲
Les you are SO talented 😭😍
Yay a cake vid 🤍
Omg Les you are so talented! Que paciencia! The imagination that you have! The cake was absolutely beautiful!
I wanted to watch the mommy first look at the cake reaction ! You always do a great job on the cakes les ! Hope you do CakeMas again ☃️🎄
next time you make larger tiered cakes, add an extra cake round in between (ex: 2 layers of cake add another cake board and more cake dowels, then the remaining cake layers) helps keep your cake sturdy and secure when traveling.
Okay so Am I the only one that gets excited when she’s doing  the cake and goes into detail with it as well .
Baby G is me trying to get the attention all to himself by dropping the camera 🤣🤣❤❤
I look forward to all your videos but more the cake ones. You are talented! Love you les.
You came to Hobbs!!!
Les: sorry didn't realize it wasn't on focus  Me: wappenning with my optometrist consultation bill, though?  $423Batmans  🤣🤣🤣 Jkkk. Growing up I had BAD BAD BADDD resolution/speed Today's "not focus" was considered HD way back when 😂
Les you did it again!!! It was beautiful like all your cakes are. I can't even imagine driving three hours to deliver. Cake girl you crazy!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
