Queen 🥇💰❤️🇬🇧
❤️☀️💰👍🍀🇬🇧🌼🌼🥇
Quite amazing 🤯 . . . easily my favorite pop track EVER (so far). Brilliant ballad with virtually infinite replay value.  Most of comments here are so ridiculously lame and uninspired it makes me long for the "old 🏫" YouTube. 😒
Most importantly always remember God loves you my beautiful queen I love you ❤ Perfection ❤️ Blessings ❤️ King Chief Priest Timothy Yeshayahu
Love your voice Miley . My dream is to sing with you ❤
Beautiful ❤

Four years ago for some reason quite a few artists started doing 80s vibe music trippy did it so did a lil toe too
This sounds to me a lot like 80s Stevie Nicks, actually!
I don’t care about the lyrics to this or about Miley’s personal life, I just like how this song sounds. And that’s enough for me!
Had to come check the lyrics has " its hell from my waist but you'll never be replaced.. boom you know it's true" stuck in head so annoying lol I knew it was wrong
I'm in love on this song 💙
Amo essa música❤❤❤
that run "ohh noo" lives in my head 24/7
Does this song remind anyone else a little of Edge of Seventeen by Stevie Nicks? That's not a criticism, I think both songs are great and I actually like it when new songs share certain similarities or are inspired by older hits
🤗 🌞 ❤️ 👍🎯🥰
God hand picked gave her throat a voice of an angel 😇😇😁
I love song on forth 1
Amazing song❤
Play this at my funeral

FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST, WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE  EVERLASTING LIFE IN HEAVEN FOREVER AND EVER. John 3:16 Bible....THE RAINBOW🌈THRONE OF SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST AND THE TREE OF LIFE, Revelation 4 and Revelation 22 Bible. And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.🔥This is the second death. Revelations 20 bible.... ❤️I SAW A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. 2 Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 3 And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. 4 And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.” 5 Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.”❤️ 6 And He said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts. 7 He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. 8 But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone,🔥which is the second death.

This song is stuck in my head

What was the most draconic (like a dragon) line in the song?
"Can't bite the Devil on My Tongue", her lyric's to her song, clearly shows where her "allegiance and beliefs" are!
S0 🔥

Album of the year for me deadass  Go Miley
80s and Future retro wave was popular 5 years ago. Pop artist are catching up in the end of 2020. Not a fan of MC here but song is really good pop trash. I enjoyed as much as Lady Gagas last big single.
Ben fogle is fan of heres
Mily cyrus ft kasabian is a must
Miley je suis fan de toi depuis que je suis petite car moi aussi je m appelle Milley mais avec deux l j ai eu  9ans le 21 octobre c'était pour te dire que j'étais fan de toi depuis toute petite j'adore tes chansons  ben j'adore tes  musiques surtout la chanson ou tu es sur une boule blanche qui est accroché à un plafond je crois si je me trompe pas je te fait des bisous de loin et j'espère que tu ne va attraper le coronavirus
Now this is what you call female empowerment!!! We don’t need WAP when we have this masterpiece . This is edgy , sexy , nostalgic and empowering all in one . No disrespect to CB but this didn’t need to be overly explicit to be phenomenal 👌🏻 I wasn’t a huge fan of Miley but this has won me over
I get so emotional when I hear this song ain’t nothing like knowing your worth!!
Miley doesn't need to be cheap, she's a superstar, based on her vocal capabilities.
One of the most underrated tunes of the year!! Absolute masterpiece this by Miley!
Okay... I'm literally falling in love with her ❣️💜😗
Best song EVER ❤
THE BEST SONG OF 21ST CENTURY, BITCHEZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Laura Brannigan and Stevie Nick's called. They want their songs back
In German we say: coole Mukke 🇩🇪
This is such a Sagittarius song. Truly suits Miley.
Esto es hacer un puto temazo! 🤘👌❤️ Reinventándose como siempre, brutal.
Einfach geil 👌🏻
Why have I always heard 'I was born Nirvana...'
Not a fan but love this
Fucking love this Album Miley amazing job
what if the chipettes sung this
TT
What a skank. Great song though. I guess you can't be a decent human being and a great singer at the same time.
Miley I love you girl ❤lovely very much

Anyone one else wanna sing The lyrics to Edge of seventeen when Miley sings " everybodys talking now baby ohh baby ohh said ohhh. JUST LIKE THE WHITE WING DOVE!
Stevie nicks- edge of seventeen vibes ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I wander how much money Madonna threw at Miley so she  could do all this, instead of Lourdes. All vids are upgrades from Madonna.. All of them.  totally wrong genre for me  but even I can ..get pissed of at these. Send her to the woods please. thank you and wash you r hands.. oh yeah and wear a mask..heh
Miley is going through the old Jessie j stage at the moment with the looks
This is her best song!
I’m shocked by the likes!! This is amazing
I made a clip of this song on my channel with scenes of "Euphoria" 🔥 https://youtu.be/v8f1M_IHM2g
She's better than Adriana and Taylor!
This is artt
See my lips on her mouth everybody talking now.  I love it. I need practice but would love to sing this.
Love it
Love her tough, independent attitude and ferocity that comes across in her lyrics and voice.  This song and video style are both so musically awesome!!💗🔥🔥🔥
One of my favorite songs by her
Who is here from Graham Norton’s show?
I heard this song so many times and I thought it was “don’t need to be held by you” 👁👄👁
Getting Madonna vibesssss
She’s great at this song and it’s super and fabulous
Gives off her Hannah Montana vibes a little which I love! But an upgrade version. Yes girl ❤️

This track reminds me of stevie nicks style
She's done it again another catchy track just love this
The new stevie nicks love this and the look smashing it miley
Totally feeling this one  ☝️
"wait, why my screen is fading? oh.... never mind"
Melody Stolen from Fleetwood Mac without Credits.. That's redicilous and poor.
Hooked to this right now!!!
Melody seems familiar love it
Fleetwood Mac style's
Loved some of Mileys songs x been a fan forever x but this single i LOVE ! Xx
Decades from now, people will mistake this for an 80s mega hit song.
When I first heard this song, I didn't know who it was, When Alexa told me it was Miley, I was suprised to hear it. I have never been a big fan of Miley, However, this song has some Pat Benatar attitude to it, and I dig it.
Ngl the lyrics kinda remind me of Katherine Pierce or Katerina Petrova
Such a really song so do like it ♥️😊
Amazing😜. Alguém do Brasil 🇧🇷 ?
This song blew my heart. Awesome song during this pandemic!
How was this a month ago- I swear it came out like a couple days ago

I meant paid
I cannot believe the use of the internet to taint YouTube.I really don’t need to watch these political mini videos anymore.Politics is a thing that only the extremely intelligent should discuss.Ive gotten so annoyed by these political mini movies I’m thinking about deleting my Chanel boycotting YouTube Wanna know why because someone is being paid.
Sei troppo gnocca
Your awesome Miley much love
Man it's so cool your cleopatra take no shit
It's coronavirus let's play some Miley Cyrus
I'm 48 and lived my life afraid of being bisexual.  Afraid of being persecuted by my family.  Well, I've lost them all now.  This song had made me FREE!!!  I have done enough crying over all these years to cry for them.  I have my two dogs, I have been single for 7 years.  Now, I can let go and be free!!  Thank you Miley.  I'm making my own way now.  🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
People like to write her off, but she has a fantastic voice and she makes good tunes, so keep it up Miley 👍
Chic- I want your love.. can you hear it too?
Loved this song when I heard it on the radio- was disapointed by the video.  She looks great, but I was expecting something less tacky..
🖤❤😍
Miley took Isis words in “yet another side of me” seriously and now she be reinventing herself just with better results then in the show 😆
Con esta canción lo único que escucho es que todavía lo ama 😅
Miley you are my biggest fane
Monstra da minha Era!
🖤🌌
I can actually relate to the words in this song so much. 👌 I love Miley.
I like Miley Cyrus in Hannah Montana type
Don't get fat milly 😙
It reminds me of Fleetwood Mac
super voice😍
She's just amazing 👏
this screams Stevie Nicks - Edge of Seventeen, anyone else think so?
This is her best song to date!
‘It’s been a long night and the mirror tells me to go home’ Mikey Cyrus - 2020   ‘The mirrors image, tells me it’s home time’  - Alex Turner 2013   🤔 🤔

"Midnight Sky"  La-la, la-la, la  Yeah, it's been a long night and the mirror's telling me to go home (Home) But it's been a long time since I felt this good on my own Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in your ropes Forever, and ever, no more (No more)  The midnight sky's, the road I'm taking Head high up in the clouds (Oh-whoa)  I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh, no I don't need to be loved by you (By you) Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh, no I don't need to be loved by you See my lips, on her mouth, everybody's talking now, baby Ooh, you know it's true, yeah That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh, no I don't need to be loved by you (Loved by you)  La-la, la-la, la  She got her hair pulled back 'cause the sweat's dripping off of her face (Her face) Said it ain't so bad if I wanna make a couple mistakes You should know right now that I never stay put in one place Forever and ever, no more (No more)  The midnight sky's, the road I'm taking Head high up in the clouds (Oh-whoa)  I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh, no I don't need to be loved by you (By you) Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh, no I don't need to be loved by you See my lips, on her mouth, everybody's talking now, baby Ooh, you know it's true, yeah That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh, no I don't need to be loved by you (By you)  Oh  I don't hide, blurry eyes like you Like you  I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh, no I don't need to be loved by you (By you) Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, you know I don't need to be loved by you See his hands 'round my waist, thought you never be replaced, baby Ooh, you know it's true, yeah That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh, no I don't need to be loved by you Yea  La-la, la-la, la La-la  You know it's true You know it's true (Loved by you)  For amazing animated lyrics 😍❤💕👇🏻 https://youtu.be/Y-tNfABA-z8
Oh you know... She's a revolution... A legend (for all girls atleast)
🔥

THIS MUSIC DRIVES ME CRAZY!
I heard a rumour that Miley Cyrus's new album was inspired by Metallica......... What???
save your soul from this world of evil https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffQLAgmfkxQ
What a tune!!!!!🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Who the hell dislikes this
It got the 90s vibe in it
Dont know why but Im feeling she is next Madonna~
The way Miley *STANDS* I cannot stress this enough !!
Can’t believe 1k of my exes have seen this already
Who else thinks she looks like Carol Brady from the Brady Bunch
This song is a rip off of Lauren Branaigan's song "You take my self control" it also sounds like "One winged dove" by Fleetwood Mac. This song has ZERO new sound to it. It sounds ripped off.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
If Madonna and Stevie Nicks had a daughter it could be Miley.
Sorry for being so hard on you but with you're toung sticking out like that means you are a petifile and I think you're like that but that's what it means
This song giving me goosebumps 😳🤯
Miss the old miley
My Venus is in Gemini and I really enjoy lyrical videos. Often those videos are created by fans but to see you take charge and say let me control all content and not leave your lyrical art up for interpretation.

Megaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa❤️❗😘
I wanna see Steve Kardynal’s take on this one.
halloffame
I really like this song, It’s nice for the rock music 🎶
спасибо !
her song to Liam...
OMG i love you 💕❤👁👄👁❤💘💘💘👸🏼👸🏼👸🏼👸🏼👸🏼👸🏼👸🏼👸🏼
Miley Cyrus: 1) she admits she suffered severe brain damage at the age of 2 due to her negligent father  2) she admits to starving herself on the “vegan” diet and only eating celery  3) she admits to massive drug and alcohol use/abuse ... But it must have been the PLANT BASED DIET 👌
I've never been a Miley Cyrus fan but damn, this is so good!
Sorry miley cyrus but in the old school that toug sticking out like that makes red flags stick up like there's something rong with you and I'm telling you it's not a good thing it makes you look bad I'm letting you go I like you're music up tell now
I hear you, my love. Hold me. I like to cuddled. Disgusting. But you better be the big spoon. Biich.
Not with that toug sticking out like that lol
Uuuuu you know its true!!
This song makes me wanna break up with my boyfriend just so I can go out and sing this in the club
This song makes me wanna overdose on acid
When miley get,s it right the lady gets it RIGHT 😝🤪😜😝😛🤪😝😝
Жги ещё, Детка!
ahhh why you making me crazy miley!!!!!!!!!!!!
Anyone who dates Miley, beware
The beat kinda reminds me abit of the Edge of Seventeen by Stevi Nicks
Yes bring the 80s back
Like miley new songs superb vocals
For the most part we all do what we want to do in the end. This is not a revelation. Miley makes it seem more liberating than it is .I love this song btw
Miley playing tribute to Adrian Smith’s hairstyle seventh son of a seventh son era, and she looks great, apparently Miley is a fan of Iron Maiden so fair play to her and good on her for causing controversy and p*ssing those straight jacket wan*ers, go on lass you are doing a fine job 👍🏻
Why do I feel like it's a cry for help song
Really channeling blondie at 2:26 right there. Gave me chills
You resonate with my soul. Never stop you are Gold.👑
I wish this song to peak number 1. so good :((
This is my favourite song Miley's ever done!!!! 😍❤️

As a 43 year old woman....i never thought I'd say "I quite like Miley Cyrus' music..." but I absolutely do! This song is absolutely lush! I can't stop listening to it! That gravel in her voice is so beautiful 💜

Midnight sky in my mind ⭐🌙
Using auto tune 🤢

Can't wait to get crunk with you gurl.
Want a remix of this and Blinding Lights
Hannah Montana I’m a big fan my older sister is 19 and she still watches Hannah Montana well ur real name is Miley Cyrus
Can't wait to find my vibe like miley
I was born to love you, my girl. This bop saved 2020 and you saved me many times... Thank for just for existing. Te amo.
Sexxy .
Cigarettes do good to cyrus voice
Always rocking that red lipstick
How much autotune and seizures-inducing effects do you want ?  Miley : yes
She became a loser Since in started naked........ She's lost. in a few years Her star will be turned off.
Getting massive Edge of Seventeen vibes here
KATY PERRY IS BEING SABOTAGED BY CAPITOL RECORDS, HERE'S WHY AND HOW. (A THREAD)   1) In 2017, Katy released a political song Chained To The Rhythm, before that she was very vocal in politics, CTTR did pretty well on charts. But then she released Bon Appetit with Migos. Migos is an openly transphobic trio and Katy is LGBT+ supporter. Which means Capitol forced her  2) Bon Appetit was set to release solo but it got a feature on it on the last minute, and Katy got so much hate from it. When she was accused of being transphobic, her team did NOTHING to fix her image.  3) In 2018, Capitol's CEO confirmed that they were "disappointed" by Witness' unsuccess. And stated that they have a plan for Katy that they're excited for. But nothing happened in 2018. You can read his full conversation here  4)Katy released Harley's In Hawaii in 2019, which was a fan-favourite, was the fastest Katy Perry song ever to enter iTunes USA Top 10. But the song wasnt sent to the radios, it got sent later when the hype died down.  5)What is more strange about this is that even though HIH was so fast to enter the top 10, the song wouldnt come up when you searched it on iTunes. The song fell so quick. It lasted only 10 days on the chart even though its sudden success  6)Katy released Daisies, her lead single from her album earlier this year along with the music video. Daisies went #1 on iTunes and managed to say in the chart for over a month. But however, the song wasnt sent to the radios.  7)as you can see from the song's chart success, the song got out of the itunes chart after four weeks of release. The song was sent to the radios right after it got out of the chart, but the hype was already dead. and after 2 weeks, the song was taken back from the radios  8)Smile performance video was posted on Youtube without Katy knowing, after it got posted by her team, they deleted it. And posted it again on the right time. But the video already had over 500k views before they deleted. Also reminder that Smile was leaked 2 months before release.  9)Why would Capitol sabotage Katy, why is it good for them? Katy has a 5 album contract with capitol which ends with Smile, and Capitol doesnt want her to be a rival to them if she goes to an another company.  10)Katy is the only executive producer of Smile, which means she financed the album with her own money, because Capitol didnt financially support her  11)an average album is most likely to get 100 to 300 million playlist support from Spotify, but Smile only got 35 million. Also the whole album got leaked before its release by her own label, they sent the vinyls and cds to fans almost 2 weeks before release.
The vibes this music stimulates 👌🏼Ooh, you know it's True!🎶🎵
Great song ❤
Feminist AF 😍😍 Living for this!
j'adore cette musique elle déchire trop bien lol ❤️❤️❤️👍

Miley's no longer vegan... thank God! I don't need to support and listen to her music anymore! ❤
The best sources of omega-3 are chia seeds, ground flaxseed, flaxseed oil, and canola oil. Additional sources include hemp seed oil, walnuts, and, to a lesser extent, soybeans and leafy green vegetables. It is also possible to get these fatty acids from algae-derived supplement
Did you know this is her 100th YouTube video

I love you Miley♡
Music looklike song 80s @ 90s
Badass! I love you Ms. Miley ♥️
Seems u acted like a vegan as more of a fad or to gain vegan supporters then. what was in fish that made u feel better? what if any deficiency did u have that fish cured? Whatever it was, im sure u could get what u needed from a vegan source without many of the harmful things found in fish. U should have gone to some vegan dieticians if u didnt.
This chick is a rockstar.
A sagittarius anthem!
Who else saw them Red Lips and thought of Wreaking Ball
Obessed miley cyrus 😍 Huge fan
This is good but she sounds like Michael Jackson a bit haha
sounds like Stevie Nicks.....I love it
Bruh y’all don’t pay attention she’s a clone what’s wrong with y’all it’s obvious
Aca su voz me recuerda a Steve Nicks de Fleetwood Mac y en escena a Madonna.
This song gives  power 💪
why did you sell your soul to the devil ? the price is so high.  Repent ardently and ask forgiveness of your sins from God
I found you satan. Are-you sure you plant this game ? Neo  with the power. In God memory
I knew she was gonna make it. He did too.
Gross
This song makes me wanna break up with my controller bf 🙄😂
I cameeee inn like aa wreckingggg ballll
OHH NOOO 🥺❤️
God bless the QUEEN
This song made me break up with my ex.

Soy loco con esa mujer 💜💜💜
*HANNAH MONTANA*
Awesome song...the clip did not match the vibe I got when I heard this on the radio. I wosh she would embrace her full country voice..she would smash hits all over the place.
I think I'm lesbian.
You r good always were always will be. love this song and love you Miley you rock ❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
Periodttt
I like it 🤭🤭🤭🤭‼️‼️‼️
She looks like a young Dolly Parton!
It's driving me crazy, and you can try to lie But you're not gonna, not gonna deny No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love And you can run to the hillside And you can close your eyes But you're not gonna, not gonna deny No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love You can't deny my love
See y’all in 10 years
It's so funny how whenever Miley releases a new project people say *"she's found her sound"* .. Miley has no sound. She was born to run, she doesn't belong to anyone (or anything). *She is Miley Cyrus!*
This song is so good and it's over 3 mins? That's rare these days. Miley delivered!
Miley, por que tão lendária?
This is Sagittarius spirit from the very beginning to the very end. Miley is so free spirited so as every real sagittarius person in the world. Amazing song!
Me recuerda a MADONNA en 1986 en Open your heart
Who here listening again after the VMAs? 👀
Straight corny,bad singing, garbage,
Wow who else has been sleeping on miley
I like this song so much
Her vocals have really came into their own but keep your tongue in
I hear you Miley, friendships & relationships just don't seem to last now days but it's not because we're set up for failure, it's because we put ourselves out there for the wrong people because of what we have to offer. I can't tell you how much hatred opened when literally every person in my life from friends to family, abandoned me all at once & now expect me to allow em back without hesitation. This song to me is basically saying fuck co- dependency & how society makes you feel like the bad guy because you won't put up with other people's shit.
1st time I watch and hear midnight sky  💔💔💔  I remember  him 😔 I don't belong to anyone   I don't need to be loved by You
Jesus loves you

Hola yo tambien me llamo Miley porfa contestame
Русские есть? 😅
I wonder and delight your songs.
Sickest 80s vibe
Trop mimi notre Miley avec sa new coupe de cheveux . et pour la chanson , le clip au top . j'adore !
Incredible voice and amazing song, but what’s with the mullet?!!
Wao! the song is amazing, very catchy and her voice sounds amazing with like a raspy tone (like a combination with Stevie Nicks idiosyncratic voice!) Miley Cyrus, definitely projects a mature image, sure of her own convictions, of the self-control of her own experiences that, for better or worse, help you to reflect and make you see strong and how important you are as a person! leaving your fears behind, to be brave to leave the oppression of others. And not to permit that no one controls and decides for you and manipulates your emotions for convenience of a supposed "Love" submerged in darkness and tied to a world of sadness, appearances, of insecurity that consume your existence and your spirit of freedom to which you have the right.  Power lyrics like: "I was born to run" "I don't belong to anyone, so I don't need to be loved by you", so the capacity of each individual to empower themselves and transform their lives, will depend on their willpower to take the best path and the reins of life...So, in the past, you were like a bird was caged within its own fears... Now, you get up and emerge from the ashes like the Phoenix!
🔥
I like this one!!
I love you Miley
Love the old school vibe
I need a Tove Lo Miley duet... Pls
I'm not a huge fan really but this is a BANGERRRRR🤩

"I don't need to be loved by you."  -Know your worth.
Def Stevie Nicks - Edge of Seventeen inspired... same melody and tempo.
It's a good thing, Miley does not involve herself to any Korean group that only sings for attention, nothing more.
Miley is so amazing and unpredictable.
Listened her music Title: When i look at you its better to hear

Liam is a looser 🤣
Her time is over.
De kibaszott ronda lettél☹️

Dear stranger reading this, I know you're a beautiful person so for the full lyrics of this song, then click on the link below https://youtu.be/9v9Dakxe1D8
Guys, please go vote for Miley on Instagram. Go to MTV stories and vote midnight sky and cardigan - Taylor Swift. Taylor needs a lot of support please ❤️
Is Miley a lesbian?
I love her so much 😍
This, Blinding lights, Physical, Keep up with the vibes, we need to have sth for future from this era.
This song reminds me of when Ashley O was finally free to make her own music😂 and love this sound on Miley
This is so tough I swear listening to this is a small confidence boost !!
Her voice is perfection.
This song make me think shi* this is a pile of crap. Low budget!
How can you dislike this song??!!!....it’s so catching. Giving me 80s vibe! ❤️
Is this her best song?
Yessss Miley bring me back to the 80s
Kids learn your love language and then use it on yourselves ❤️
80/90 years
Does anyone else kind of miss the old song or is it just me because this is just like them and I really like it.
Steht ihr gut der Madonna Look , so alt und verbraucht

Lots of love
Мой кумир!!!!💟❣️ My  Idol!!!! 💟❣️
This song must be in GTA 6!
Today is my birthday, like my post to make my voice heard!
Great song it has that disco sound
🤮🤮🤮🤮
Your dad wants his mullet back.  Couldnt help it. Love it
I love this song! It feels so retro but somehow it also feels modern. Like an 80's song that got modernized. And her looks are giving me major Madonna vibes. Also love the lyrics!
Beautiful song. Thank you Miley .
She is so cut from a different cloth...  Can't listen to this without chills. Its too good
😍👑
Miley virus
♥️♥️♥️
Where’s her views???? cause this is a bop! 🥰
Ur song Make me crazy and feel better
Look y'all Hannah Montana is all grown up and very beautiful...
Sounds like a mixture of  tracks Tell me Lies by Christie McVie, edge of Seventeen by Stevie Nicks...Self control by Laura Branigan...Whole bunch of different songs to come up with this one. It's a catchy song but a whole mess of different ones to come up with it. 🤷🏼‍♀️
Reminds me of like a techno on the edge of 17
whosher
Welcome to the new millennium.

Bas me dira pesma iskreno
I can't be the only one that thinks this would've been perfect for AHS 1984 😂
This song was definitely made for sagittarius’
Miley is so talented. Her voice in this is rock and sultry. True Rockstar. Would be awesome if she came out with a cover album.
Absolute banger of a choon. Just what 2020 needs right nw.
Miley Cyrus está parecendo MADONNA!!!
Hana montana was beautiful but so sorry know she isn't beautiful.i wish can you com back to hana montana

Madona
The era of mullets and glam rock is back.
Ultra seductive sensual music full of extra energy and emotions.
Madonna vibes 😮
Reminds me of "The Glow" by MONOGEM, I still love them both
I've never cared for mileys music....just wasn't my thing.....but this is 🔥🔥🔥
This is VIBEEEE
Queen.
Everything, the music video, the hairstyle and the music reminds me of the 80s, is it really on purpose? Because I love it !
??? I like it
Hi sexy
LOVE YOU ❤️❤️❤️
I love the raspyness of her voice in some parts!
80’s vibes
What is happening?!?! I didn’t care for Miley much during her Bangerz era but this right here....this shit is a hit! And this video is perfection. I might be a Miley fan.
💘 Her Haircut in This Video
Id rather Lady Gaga have sang this.
Yay She Wearing A Purple Dress
Just 💘 This Song She A Beautiful Voice. I'm Hooked To This Song 💘 The Beat
super j adore.
this song is amazing !!!! she truly outdid herself ❤💪
Why she sounds Hannah Montana here
Literalmente  estoy amando este album
She's wonderful
Ohhh this girl has a feisty side 🔥
Real, yeah...
delicious
It’s been so long since someone made a pop song. Great job Miley.
^,~👍
Nice Miely Cyrus 80s vibe with modern finish 👌🏻
In love within the first few seconds 😍
no sabía que necesitaba mucho este video 💖
absolutely incredible
Miley has been saying she can't be Tamed since forever. That's why I love her music
Has a bit of an 80s vibe to it. This is actually a pretty good song.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Miley your toung is the devil your a half breed of a peacock and giraffe and a little pink flmingo
best karaoke ever
Miley you have the most unique voice for our time Musically ahead I love your lyrics too thank you 🥰
Anyone else hear edge of 17?
Boy this sure did bring back some memories! If you stay along these lines girl you'll do incredible! I love the rock/ pop. Who did it remind everyone of everyone???  I know the answer but I want everybody else to answer especially the millennials lol This way they can go back and listen to some really good music in the '80s.  That Miley Cirus was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 and you have come so far. I was really worried for a bit, but now... Wow!!! You look incredible!!! 😁🤗🌹🔥🔥🔥🥰😍
I bet this is her realization after being so head over heels to someone. Just saying 😊
DISCO
GO MILEY!!!!! YOUR SONG IS IN THE TOP CHARTS!!! WELL DONE MILEY
She’s gross.
I’ve loved Miley Cyrus since “Jolene” her tones are signature. I want Hannah Montana to be reintroduced!!👌🏽
I am using you as Inspiration to stop smoking weed. If you can go sober..then so can I
The Weeknd should have been on this
The beginning sounds like Little Lies by Fleetwood Mac.
She outdone herself. This type of music suits her. Wreck the ball, Miley!!
KIZ NE GÜZEL SÖYLEMİŞSİN
This generation better go back to the rock music
Just what I need
What drugs os she on what happen to music together this is how they target kids. Sad and I wont be condoning this yes im the one who disagrees  Katy perry clown song is terrible looks like everyone on drugs and that is what they are selling kids. Poor miley what happen
Wolf wolf. Midnight sky is my favorite song.
The midnight sky’s the road I’m taking... Head high up in the clouds
Чудово)
I’m officially voting Miley for president btw I suggest you guys do too.
Hello everyone! I made a “Soft version” cover of this song on my channel. Please check it out!! ❤️🌟❤️
It has been long time i not did listen ur new song
Her look and sound remind me of Chloe Mk’s EP.  Hopefully Miley isn’t trying exploit one of her former contestants on The Voice.
If this era was when Debbie Harry was at her prime this is what she would be
I’m getting 80’s 90’s vibes from this
*Not bad but the 90’s feel really gives you awkward feels, when ya know we’re 30 years past the 90’s. Seriously hunny i love ya but that makeup makes you look old AF. Still love your voice hunny!*
See his hands 'round my waist, thought you never be replaced, baby ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
I just hate it when vocal coches react on such a masterpiece, there's no comparison
Anyone getting the 80's vibes??
I like it 🤩
Miley's...Retro style 💓
The devil 😈 on your tongue is right!! You clearly are living for Satan. It's a shame. Save yourself Miley before it's too late.
😎 genial
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😁😁😁😁😁😆😉😁
😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
I love it miley
It’s never a bad time for new Miley music. Such an absolute QUEEN 👑
Ahhh yesss love ya
Authentic ❤️
Imagine if u could write a song against your ex being this much famous.
Yes yes Miley 😘 still love your music/lyrics..just smoke and vibe to this right here while tapping your foot.
She look sweet their
Catchy! A message of independence...She's my daughters age, and I like seeing this side of her. (As a dad.....I'm glad she dumped that punk).
A LIVING LEGEND♥️
U bringing 80's music back to life 🖤
Damn this is so good
Her voice is a gift
"I was born to run I don't belong to anyone" yes queen, you are slaying, you are free, and you never fail on us. you are such a great artist, love you 🥰
If Maleficent mistress of evil was a musical this would be a song in it!
this song really be stuck in my head foreverrrrr.
I love Miley
This track has a lot of dark and deep hidden meanings. Lyrics such as: Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in your ropes, Forever, and ever, no more / I don't belong to anyone, oh, no, I don't need to be loved by you / Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue / you know it’s true / She got her hair pulled back 'cause the sweat's dripping off of her face / You should know right now that I never stay put in one place Forever and ever, no more / I don't hide, blurry eyes like you. These are exposing the satanic truths in the music industry, child trafficking, child abuse including sexual abuse. It’s staring you in the face but the only way she can expose the truth is by giving us subtle hints through her lyrics. It’s a cry for help. Wake up! Keep your eyes open and you will see it. For example in the video when she says “You should know right now that I never stay put in one place” she is lay in candy telling us how the children are trafficked and used or passed around like candy. She is also surrounded by animals and she’s screaming to us when she sings. Either she’s crying for help, she’s part of it or she’s been brainwashed and this is her support for HIM and I don’t mean her lover or her boyfriend, that’s a facade. I mean the guy with the horns on his head.
tornado
I pray who ever reads this becomes successful. god bless you💓
Amazing
attack on titan
Just got my Disco on

Yup... sounds strangely familar with Stevie Nicks' EDGE OF SEVENTEEN.🤔
Invite The  Weekend for remix because of disco vibes
************************* john ling 😘😋😋🥰🥰🥰🤫😴
Arrasou Miley ❤️
Miley you have similar looks to Dolly Parton.. 😄
This combination of her voice and this music... mmm mmm.. I am living for this vibe
Love it
You'd think someone as experienced as her would know how to move their lips during a video shoot 🤔
Неплохо 👌
I really do believe she is the Madonna of our generation - in terms of reinvention and keeping things fresh af ... 😍
As a new single I wish I could go to a club to dance to this song. 😂
decidme que no soy el único que las tres primeras notas les suena a otra canción xd
Lol was singing ' I was born nirvana don't belong to anyone' for daysss
This actually gives me GAGA vibess
great.. not my type of music but still admit not bad. girl has husky voice
You Are ( FORGIVENESS)
Such a catchy tune, I just love it!!
No apologies suppression always creates LIONESSES
DAMM  lionesses
90 years haha  1990 I am born in 2008 but I feel in 1990 years
Ich freue mich auf Mileys neues Album
Love her voice! She is so fucking special 💪🏼 Love new music 🎶❤️
Judge me but i like this edit better than the actual video clip
Go Miley. 🌹
Did she broke up  with liam
But maybe I want to be petted by you... a fluffy kittie like me needs pets you know.
This song is gold, and the message hits the heart❤️
I really really like it
A Daft Punk collab on this or a future style track like this with Miley would be amazing.
Like the lyrics: I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no, don't need to be loved by you.   The song is awesome though and I believe the artist is an nice person.
Amazing 😀😎🤩🌹
Miley, you rock.
Stevie Nicks vibes!! 😍
so good
What an amazing song Miley cyrus is amazing
I miss Hannah Montana
para los que van llegando si le ponen en velocidad 1.5 se escucha mucho mejor <3
I love this song Miley! You finally make a song with how you feel and show on your music video. ......that's what music all about!!!!!!
Love this song and its vibe! Does this song sample Edge of 17 by Fleetwood Mac?
IT's so 80's
This song sounds like a good Tiktok POV sound
Got that Madonba feel to it.
My love for her will never fade 💜💙💜💙 such a great artist, always expressing herself no matter what ppl say or think u do u girl I will always support u
Another one!!🤸🏽‍♀️🤸🏽‍♀️🤸🏽‍♀️
Só sucesssoooooooooo vindo da minha queeeeeennnn ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yess miley...you go girl...hugs to you...beautiful song and beautiful woman....
I love miley and her music but I have to say her last few songs all sound the same.
My girl 😩❤️
🔥
i was born in the wrong generation😭. Miley turns up the disco light in my lungs every damn time❤️...arrgghh!
It's you
The video gives me early Madonna vibes.  I love both voices.  Madonna is a legend and Mikey will be as well.
MILEY CYRUS I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH🤩😍❤
एक बेहतरीन अदाकारा जो हमेशा से कुछ नया लाती रही है। मिली ने कभी किसी की परवाह नही करि और उसका अपना एक अंदाज़ है https://hothollywoodstar.com/miley-cyrus/
Miley "hot smouth" Cyrus  !!!
la la la la la 😍
This lady is a genius... she knows exactly what she’s putting out .....  she’s already more famous than her dad (and rightly so) she’s just fantastic....
The beat reminds me of a fleet wood Mac song
Miley is just so GD DOPE!! Her versatility/evolution is just ughhh!!! If you told me I would f with her like this when she was Hannah, I would have called you crazy af.
Definite Pat Benetar vibes for me. Love it!
Here before the millionth view ✨
Love the lyrics!
i swore she sang "don't call me jimmy" am i the oly?
Love u Miley ...  Cool haircut ❤️
I like this teme !
Ok I am impressed. She is an outstanding performer.
i'm so obsessed with this song
Are we going to talk about how miley looks good with a mullet?
I love her
Anyone getting Cher & Dolly Parton vibes? Im not sure but she looks amazing! Miley you are super hot! 🔥
Wow shes soooo pretty! ;D love ur gloves!
I missed her. I'm so happy :)
Getting strong Fleetwood Mac/Stevie Nicks vibes. Very cool!
Woooooooooooooooooow 😍
Miley best musician I know
I SUPPORT you mileyyyy at every stage of your life ❤️
I love Miley so much
She definitely knows she has perfect teeth
Lady Gaga new album feeling...🤔🤔😲😲
Mileyyy luv u Queeen
She sounds like a chipmunk. Milley looks like 1970's pornstar. At points a complete rip off of Madonna.
For many years, I was a fan of Miley on and off but when Midnight Sky came out, I finally became a true fan. I love Miley!!
So much Madonna feeling!! ♥️♥️♥️ Feeling nostalgic AF
I love this! Getting chills it’s so good
Legend
Way to go Miley !!! ♥️
Chhe takk😆😒  🖤🖤
I’m currently watching Hannah Montana...
Супер СЕКСИ.... Майли,ты 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥  И кстати,похожа сильно на Мадонну 👍👍👍
Love the shoes,all of them!!!!
Hi the "ooh, you know its true" remind me of Stevie- Edge of Seventeen, love it_ Good vibes
i truly like this song and i love miley but i’m kinda tired of this narrative of her being “wild and free”. don’t get me wrong, i love the fact that miley is so rebellious and reckless, but i feel like she’s been doing this kind of songs since “can’t be tamed” and doesn’t feel as interesting anymore. if this was her first song with these kind of lyrics i would be obsessed cause it’s a really good song but i want her to give something else, especially because i consider her the most versatile pop artist of her generation and i know that she’s capable of outdoing herself. i’ll be streaming tho cause the song is really good. i want to see more of her and can’t wait to hear what’s coming in the future  *i’m talking about lyrics here, not sound. she’s good with different genres, i just wish the lyrics of her songs were as diverse as the sound!
Song and video are great
Loveeeee thisssss
Great song Miley.
The road is wide for miley cyrus
Back to 'slut mode'.
El video es simplemente Perfecto 👌🏼
David Bowie and Madonna have a daughter, that's the good result 😍😍
Wawawoooooom this Song Hits all
Good Women, good music 🎧💀😘
❤🎤✨👑
Miley🎤✨✨🎤
The comeback of Dusty Springfield...i like it
Stevie Nicks vibes ❤️
Prophetees oh chaos
A well executed homage to Stevie Nicks. Anybody else hear  Edge Of Seventeen vibe all over this????
Brasil 🇧🇷
I didn't want to like miley music.. But I do  love her unique voice.. refreshing break from screechy singers of today
Młoda dziewczyna o świetnym głowie. Szkoda że ma styl ubioru pani spod latarni. A nie ma takiej potrzeby bo głos sam się obroni.
This is so 80's in 2020. I love it! 🥰
You know you just heard a masterpiece when you feel the chills on your skin. Awesome Miley!
Disgusting
Parece Madona
I hope you credit the set you used a couple of times in the music video, the artist's name is Athi Patra Ruga.
80's I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!
I love you girl 🥰
Is this unreleased track by Sandra of late 70's or early 80's?
<3
I love her so much from.italy
the new generation Madonna 🔥
She reminds me of Dolly Parton for some reason
Impresionada con el video ,con ella💗💗 ..muy  bella esta canción me alegro el día...besoos para todos los que disfrutan de su música 😊😊
Not bad
I'm not really huge fan of Miley Cyrus but this music song it's really nice 😌
OMG love the Kim Petras inspired lyric video 😩😍😍❤️❤️❤️
Rehashed version of a couple of 80's genre songs
I am a big fan of yours. I am watching your  disney series HANNAH MONTANA,but I like you more when you were doing the series HANNAH MONTANA.
She's selfish, she broke Liam's heart. Now she's posting all this powerful songs she look disparate to prove a point that isn't there. If she moved on she wouldn't make this song.
I loved the lyrics ♡ MILEY CYRUS ERES LA MEJOR #1
Omg,...Miley is FOREVER AND EVER...QUEEN!!!👍💋💗😍👍
Good luck to Miley, she deserves her success, but instead of navel gazing about love lost, she’d do better by stepping it up and singing about the serious shit we’re all facing, rather than her narcissistic self. I mean, for fuck sake, when are these powerhouse female entertainers like Cyrus, Swift, Minaj, Perry, Cardi, etc actually going to start singing about shit that matters instead of themselves...it’s getting pretty damned BORING! This mundane pop shit is like a sedative when the world is literally melting down. Where is the “Fuck you I won’t do what you tell me” Rage Against The Machine of this generation? Or is Miley’s crowd as superficial and narcissistic as she is, hence the parish pump pop. Come on Miley, fuck Liam, take on the Baby Boomers - start with Trump and his cronies. Miley tearing the joint down like RATM, now THAT is an album I’d buy, but I need this Midnight Sky shit like I need a marriage counsellor.
New songs MORE 💗 https://youtu.be/cplOyeVRl0M Orginal
Alrighty yhen. I can relate to this song
And that ladies and gentlemen - is a SERVE!
fuc**** goddess!
Weird how music is getting better while the world's getting worse
The production , her voice , the video everything's perfect
2020 is 80s all over again I'm loving it
Old good times! More 80s more Miley!!!!🤗
people often say they dont want to be loved but actually, who doesn't want to be loved? i dont really know how relationship works but if you want a relationship to work, you need to play your part as well.   okay i dont know what i'm saying.
No shade but I can t believe for a while people said Dua is the new queen of pop :)))
R.I.P 19's america
Miley win after all.
Best song this year❤️🔥🔥🔥
This song belongs to Liam Hemsworth
I am really obsessed with this song 😩😩😩❤️

Miley you got taste!
Its the way she sings it for me
Sounds like every other pop song in the world
I adore Miley But it sounds like “Edge of Seventeen” and “In the Air Tonight” mashup
The only good thing about the year 2020 is that some good songs have been released.
Miley is Awesome she got this
عليكي السليم
Una de las mejores canciones del 2020

Hello my friends, I don’t know who reads my comment, but I wish him eternal happiness. I wish you to subscribe to my channel and activate the bell. This is all I hope. Thank you.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
her voice never ceases to amaze me... been a fan since hannah montana days and im still SHOOK as new 😮
I still listen to her “Bangerz” album because it’s got jams, there’s a couple songs on there similar to this so I feel like it was always a direction she wanted to go and this song just fits Miley, ya know?!  Miley has made her share of mistakes, and she’s always evolving and maturing to try and make sure those mistakes don’t overshadow her growth. I’m proud of how far she’s come from where some people probably thought she’d be, and I’ll remain a fan!
Driving Song of the Year
good work
I think she wrote this song for her ex husband. Poor liam. That man really loves her n she doesn't even care.
She's very versatile. She can do many genres.
I love her voice 🥰
love uuu❤️❤️
queen ❤️
Who ever it is an ancient devel.
They realy hert my feelings.

QUEEN OF POP HAS CAME
MY QUEEN DID THAT!!
Finally a song without a trap beat 🌹
Digging this song 🎵 👌 and she is right we often feel the need to be validated by others and crave their love when our self love diminishes. Getting Madonna vibes with this look she reminds me of Madonna with short hair.
Rarísimo rarísimo rarísimooooo
Madonna 2020
Brasil aqui ? 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 Musicao da porra !!
Caraca que música top amei essa roquidao essa vibe eu amaria cantar uma música dessa no karaokê hahaha ameii 🇧🇷🇧🇷 salve dos fans brasileiros
I’ve always loved Mileys music and this is no exception. This is such a jam though.
https://youtu.be/svygN-lTNso
So fireeeee love it
I just found out that they broke up 💔
Liam has been really quite since this came out.....
yess omg reminds me of this - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdZLi9oWNZg (at 3:50 ❤)
Man, her vocals in this are so sexy. Shit, Idk where she's running but I want to go. Lol
Is she trying to  copying kylie minougue style??
For someone who sings “A lot of years went by with my hands tied up in your ropes” and “Forever and ever no more” and “I don’t need to be loved by you” Miley sure seems to spend a lot of her energy focussed on Liam.   If she doesn’t need to be loved by him, why keep singing about him and projecting her Freudian slips???
Am i the only one who thinks it looks like The Weenkd??
I recently found out that I’m a fan, this is absolutely awesome and beautiful ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💖
This video's deserved more views
Miley you look amazing I love this song I love your voice I love it all
Amazing!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Little monsters apoyando está sexy canción!!  Gaga lover ❤
Queen
Something about this song reminds me of Phil Collins' "Air tonight"
Good voice
When you can’t express your feelings literally. Put it into a song. She always release songs which is always timely relevant to what is goin on in her life.
love it!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Perfeitaaaah
Same vibes as blinding lights.
I'm gonna be the last one breathing and you better be down with me.
She is incredible singer.
I need her to do something like Joan Jett NOW 😂
Anyone else get Steve knicks vibes ?
I’m getting Stevie Nicks vibes and I’m loving it!!!
Never fails to impress me, idol
all to me
I love that late 70s early 80s vibe! So nostalgic!
She should really cover a Nirvana song. Her voice is made for it🔥
We needed this so badly ❤️❤️❤️❤️ was tired of hearing wap and same type of music being played constantly. We needed flavor ❤️🤣🤣
https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSfhCNqD/ síganme en tiktok !!!
I'd say this is the modern equivalent to Stevie Nick's Edge Of Seventeen. Truly a rocking song.
90's vibes!!

This song will always be GOLD
I wanna hear this song for the first time over and over again, it’s giving me very lady Gaga vibes. Very 𝓷𝓸𝓼𝓽𝓪𝓵𝓰𝓲𝓬 even though it’s new
"Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent, because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness.." (Acts 17:30,31) That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. (Rom.10:9-10) For "whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved." (Rom.10:13)  Repent, put your trust and faith in the Lord Jesus before it is too late.
yes Miley
I love you
Te amo tantooooooooo
I'm ready for your performance in MTV's Vmas 💖💖💖
Sounds like a The Weeknd one...
i wanna say that i  ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SONGGG!!!!!. however, i do wish that there was a more catchy hook/chorus. I feel like it wont get much radio play but i really hope to be proved wrong cuz i love this song and miley so much.

I think it is very 80's Madonna
Between this and blinding lights, the 80’s are making a come back

Himno
Miley please do us a christmas song. 😞😞😞😞😞😞. We badly want it.
This song came like a wrecking ball
Parece que realmente estamos voltando a ter nostalgias da doce era do final da última década. Cheirinho de "revoltas da miley".
I love it, i love you. You are amazing. 🔥🔥🔥 You belong to yourself. We ONLY belong to ourselves. All we need is to be loved by ourselves... not anyone else.   Thank you 4 sharing your music with us, we love your art, and you...
No dziwki ciezko pracuja
U look similar to Blondie, in my opinion 😍
I'm really glad i found this video for multiple reasons seriously period no questions asked at all
Minha musa
“I was born the run” is the most accurate line in my life
Go slay them all dead, girl!

大好き💓
Debo admitir que en este vídeo Miley luce como una diosa
Madonna wannabe
Love it!
Alguien que hable español
I really like her voice and vocal. Beside all the controversial things people thought she did, she still one of the best singer like she really can sing and know the techniques and how to control her voice.
Nice song 🤩🤩🤩🤩
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Queen❤❤
Awesome!!!
Someone said they left together I ran out the door to get her She was holding hands with Trevor Not the greatest feeling ever Said, "Pull yourself together You should try your luck with Heather" Then I heard they slept together Oh, the less I know the better The less I know the better Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night Oh my love, can't you see that you're on my mind Don't suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind So goodbye She said, "It's not now or never Wait ten years, we'll be together" I said, "Better late than never Just don't make me wait forever" Don't make me wait forever Don't make me wait forever Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side? I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind I was doing fine without you 'Til I saw your face, now I can't erase Giving in to all his bullshit Is this what you want, is this who you are? I was doing fine without you 'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine Oh, sweet darling, where he wants you Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line" Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line" Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"
ONE OF THE FEW GREAT THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN 2020!! JUST WHEN I THOUGHT MOTHER'S DAUGHTER & SLIDE AWAY WERE ENOUGH BANGERZ....MILEY CAME OUT WITH THIS I'LL ALWAYS SAY THIS ABOUT THIS...BIG SAGITTARIUS ENERGY HERE, MILEY!!
Who hurt u Miley?
Who would have thought that we'd be looking at a video made purposely in 144p in 2020?
The “oh no” reminds of Phil Collins coming in the air tonight
ONE OF THE FEW GREAT THINGS IN 2020!!
😍

I love how so many artists are bringing back the 80’s sounds. Seems like a new side of Miley. I hope she will keep this genre because it fits her really well 😍
Wow Miley that was good 🤩
Disco nu
Technically this song was actually technically in the content of the actions of the castle but with the actions of the castle it was known that you should have should be more respectful for how much of the developments of my pods and a few other things as that you know I have workers inside of their and my wife's systems!
Who is here after WAP?
cox gözəl mahnıdı👍
I got told stop stealing other people's lyrics because the track of the World Systems is known for the ones that are catching for how hard you are taught!
Achei q era a ROMAGAGA tô passada 🤣 adorei o clipe 😍
A lame copy of Madonna and Kylie. Nothing original. Weak song.
Lovely
God, She's good
Can’t get enough of this ❤️❤️
Just like karaoke love it
LIKE, if you are from India, Asia and the Middle East.... LIKE, jika Anda berasal dari India, Asia dan Timur Tengah...पसंद करें, यदि आप भारत, एशिया और मध्य पूर्व से हैं ... أنا أحب ذلك ، إذا كنت من الهند وآسيا والشرق الأوسط
Is it just me, or was there a strong Debbie Harry influence to the look and sound of this video?
La neta esta mejor la que saco para black mirror
Slide away, I don't need to be loved by you.
Director: how many filters you need?  Miley Cyrus: Yes
Omg! the video is so distracting. can't sing a long. lol I can't just stop looking at her. so stunning!
And that “Oh no” run is fire!
In love!!! 😍😍😍

This is what an artist looks like that does exactly what feels authentic to them at all times. No hits, numbers, mainstream sound needed. Just pure freedom. Yes Miley! 🔥

Lalalalala
I love the video I love the looks I love the vocals I love the lyrics. I just wish... her vocals were a little less processed? A little more in front? I feel like this would be amazing live. I feel like this could be a #1 hit if it was produced a little more like a Queen or Blondie track.
Se viene  algo nuevooo atentos
Хорошый музончик приятно слушать🎶🎙а клип в стиле80-х👍 Всем огромный салам с Казахстана (К-Орда) всем удачного дня🥳🥳🥳

Queen of pronunciation!
Tremenda diosa Miley 🤧🙌💞💞
Was looking and waiting all summer for a great summer song...and this was it! Well done, Miley! Great stuff and will be a catalyst for future memories of a summer like no other.
I like that she closed out with a lil classic Miley tongue action instead of opening with it #classy
Can’t wait to see Miley perform this song at the VMA’s at the end of this month!!!😄
Que musica boa, a voz dela ficou ótima nesse formato 👍
I stopped my job with the help of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*

Brasil girrl
Love this version
MILEY, this song is ripe for a mashup with, "One Winged Dove," by Fleetwood Mac. I was singing that chorus in the background of yours.
Someone mix this with Laura Brannigan Self Control because I’m hearing that mix

“SEE MY LIPS ON HER MOUTH” my lil gay ass loves that line so much
Sounds like she is collaborating w/ Mark
Since her disney days to every transition that she had I have been her greatest supporter! Love you down to bits Miley! 😍😘❤️

"I don't need to be loved by you"  That's true, guys. We don't need to be loved by anybody else. WE must love ourselves. Don't wait for someone else to fill you. BE FULL ON YOUR OWN. The rest is consequence!   (Btw, just posted a cover of this song, if you wanna watch it ^^)!!.
The creativity in this ?!!! Holy cow, I am just blow away!! You pulled me right back in to your music Miley! Especially when music can pull you in and be able to forget the shit in your life. So good 👏🏼
Cadê a versão karaokê?
Wacha, te sigo desde Hannah Montana, no des mas vueltas, dame bola lym, ahrre <3
LA LA LA LA LA LA, iconic.
why is it laggy though? who made this?
Mira sus manos en mi cintura que nunca podrás reemplazar.😏🔥😉 Mi cinturita de avispa no la tiene nadie papi.🔥

Buen tema
WOW VERY NICE.I LOVE IT.
TE AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Queen of versatility

Well, I'm glad Miley don't need love. Strong, independent; out there, creating her own life giving chi. She can be that star.
The lyric it's amazing!  Yeah girl!! 🤩🇲🇽

Unique is shaking
I love the simplicity of the lyric video!
This is so Great!  Love it!  😻
thanks miley!!❤️❤️❤️
weeknd风
We can't stop, and we won't stop! 🔥🔥🔥
I loved how she gifted us with this INCREDIBLE lyric video. The scene in the ball pool reminds me something of her past and I loved the pink feline. <3
❤❤❤
With blue hair ,she reminds me on Madonna...
Oh it’s just the normal clip but glitchy and some text
US FANS KEEP STREAMING AND BUYING ON ITUNES! She needs a top 10 debut.. right now they’re predicting top 15!
#freebritney
Everything she does she just does so damn good. And I’m definitely here for it

BUFFOOOOOOOO
Addiction
Love
She is a Chanel girl. ❤️
I wish Miley could have given us something more original for the lyric video. I know it's just a lyric video, but I think an animated concept with some type of storyline would have been cool for this. I like the filter on the clips from the music video, but the audio is slightly out of sync with the clips, which is driving me a bit crazy!
Loving this song so much
soo good
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷

Now this is music! Makes me proud of my generation as a teen for once👏🏻
I like how the lyrics video was made in the same 80's aesthetic. Karaoke on your VHS :D
Queen of this generation
Hi everyone ❤ I made a cover of Midnight sky on Instagram my name is veronicagiannetti, check it If you want, I'd be so glad and grateful ✨❤❤❤ I'm obsessed by this song, it's pure art, it's such a light. The meaning touches my soul in some many different ways, it's so special to me. I see me in her words, I feel such a strong connection with it that I can't explain, because it's about feelings but for this I made this cover. This song deserves so much, it's so powerful and I think Miley put all her soul in it. When I sing it, I feel so free, like all my troubles went away and then I feel positive energy into my veins and that's so beautiful. This song inspires me so much and I'm so thankful to Miley for this. She's such a beautiful, strong and brave soul. I love this song and I love her, she's a big big part of my soul,from my childhood to always and forever. ❤🎤🎼
love the lyrics. Yasss strong independent queen!
I love how pop is turning to disco as a reference. ❤
Loving this song every day
Back to the 80s
OMG
MILEGEND

I WAS BORN TO RUN
SHE IS THE BEST
LOVE YOU
QUEEN
she is awesome
Miley is megatalented. She's been entertaining us since she was a kid. She knows how to do it. Miley, I've loved you for years. Your music is the best there is.
observation light noise like hair in rain on me. Light noise. Useful when u and i. Hmm. Bad asć. Make experiments with atmosphere and liquids.
Ohh cooool COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO✨OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Who else rushed to YouTube to check this one out?
A r t
STREAM!!!!
okay. Invisible light. Contrast hider. Litle red light but litlle is hiden when is this word... Hmm. Okay i use simple.. Hiden between big red. Like this rep in endgame. Inside and around u has red rep but invisible. Because red liht. Without light source. This can be visble. Stupid but ok
fancam
yummy
yassd
Latinos?
This song is such a masterpiece it is scary. It leaves no doubt that every note and every vocal will resonate in fan ears for years to come!
I can barely concentrate on the lyrics because Miley's so beautiful 😭😭
HIT🔥🔥🔥🔥

another observation. Light in same colour. "mirror" sufrace and "normal" on red light example. Red light look like red only in/on mirror. I think this is from 2t
I had learned all the 80s songs by heart by now I needed this thanks
Tudo pra mim
Les algériens on est toujours là 💗💗
Miley queen
Insisto parece una copia de Dua Lipa y Madonna, por el ritmo, estilo y temática del vídeo aunque ella ya a veces se ve muy disforzada en poses de parecer sexy, como q ya llega un poco a lo vulgar 😕
OBSESSED AND CANT GET ENOUGH OF THE SONG/VISUAL/VOCALS MILEY IS SERVING US 🔥🔥🔥🔥
MILEY CYRUS IS POWERFUL💕✨
El mismo vídeo con la letra encima y un filtro. -permanecí
I think she wanna be young and modern version of Dolly Parton. And that's fine.
😎💫💫👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
I need another Ariana and Miley collab.
👏👏👏👏👏
I love you 😘
I love this vibe ❤️ you look like Dolly !!
Queen
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS BISH MILEY CYRUS FUCKING QUEEN I CAN'T WAIT FOR HER NEW ALBUM

Someone commented her voice has matured into a 1970s rockstar voice on a live performance she did last year and this is the first time we get that energy from her in a studio recording. Sounds incredible. I am beyond excited for what's to come from her!
reminds me of edge of seventeen
Can the US wake up
STREAM STREAM STREAM! She’s so close to a top 10 debut buy the song on iTunes
Eu to viciado nessa música
This is what an artist looks like that does exactly what feels authentic to them at all times. No hits, numbers, mainstream sound needed. Just pure freedom. Yes Miley! 🔥
"She got her hair pulled back 'cause the sweat's dripping off of her face, She said it ain't so bad if I wanna make a couple mistakes" THE BOTTOM ENERGY MILEY GAVE US I CANNOT
Every track of this era you can see people saying they used to not care for her but they can't stop playing the new music. The power this era has!
THIS SONG IS DOING SO WELL Y'ALL FINALLY SHE'S GETTING WHAT SHE DESERVES FOR ALL THE GREATNESS SHE'S PUT OUT THE LAST TWO YEARS
☀️💘

Miley - You are no Madonna so don't try to be her
Den bästa video jag sett på länge, skapar fin, märklig känsla till den sjyssta låten. Skumma vibbar, häftigt.
this is no accident no mistake. Yellow-green-blue. Green is invisible because is mix.
they say that Miley Cyrus have only amercan fans like you not

Miley only gets better.

I was actually questioning my decision not to get children as a woman. Everyone around me wants children and I don't want them, but for some reason I pressured myself. And then this song came out and I just bawled my eyes out. This song gives me so much strength.  *EDIT*: Thank you all for your encouraging words! I never thought so many people felt the same way and understood my perspective.
She can’t stop FEEDING us this era
