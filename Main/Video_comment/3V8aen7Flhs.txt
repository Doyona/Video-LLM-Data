God. Where's the button to turn this shit off? Hi there honey Puff
1:58 What you said here shows that you don’t even know what it is to be a Christian. You Must deny yourself & pick up your cross on a daily. You aren’t saved by your works, youre saved by Jesus Christs Finished work on the Cross Alone. However, your works ATTEST For your faith. So you saying you pray 5 times a day yet your lifestyle shows otherwise literally is a Reflection of this verse in Gods Word ( The Bible )   YOU WILL KNOW THEM BY THEIR FRUITS. A GOOD TREE CANNOT BEAR BAD FRUIT, NOR CAN A BAD TREE BEAR GOOD FRUIT. Matthew 7:26, 10  THEREFORE THE LORD SAID: THESE PEOPLE DRAW NEAR TO ME WITH THEIR MOUTHS AND HONOR ME WITH THEIR LIPS, BUT THEIR HEARTS ARE FAR FROM ME. THEIR WORSHIP OF ME IS BUT RULES TAUGHT BY MEN. - ISAIAH 29.13

@YBNBA have you heard of Earthing? It’s the easiest way to restore electrons into the body, barefoot grounding (waking in soil/grass/snow is also the easiest way to detox the body! Also have yu heard of the power 432hz and 528hz have? Most music is tuned to 440hz which actually causes deharmonization in the cells and indicates fear in the body and mind!!😮🤯😳…… Love Always Wins that’s L.A.W. And peace is a weapon, hit em with peace, love y’all thanks for the dedication ❤😊
No surrender

Revelation 22:18 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:

Nba youngboy granted my wish i told him to drop Home of the land and now look🔥🔥🔥 if i end up meeting you one day It would feel so unreal like wtf
My boy got the fucking 240 out here on scene bro🎉respect
Y’all talking about generations and this and that when you tube ends in about 3 more years . Bet y’all ain’t know that one . Check the expiration date
The car is hell bad ass slim
The right way on my own
I love my daughter stop the cap
I've never resonated with NBA Youngboy.. mainly cause of the heavy abuse with Autotune.. I wish he would be more authentic using more of his real voice  with a tiny splash of autotune and if only he tried to add more soul and rythmn to be more magnetic for the listeners. it would make listeners addicted to listening to him
This one of his best songs 🎈
Like not trying to hate but I'm just saying the truth idk how y'all like him his voice ain't even that good but like hes a good he has good bars
❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥
japanese car???? whatttt youngboy got different style omm

I think if he dropped just the song part separate, and used this as an extended video for his dedicated base, we’d see the numbers reflect what this song really is. in my opinion, this is his greatest work. shit still amaze how good this song is, 100M m i n i m u m. think the length mighta deterred the masses. but that’s okay, this one of those songs im happy not many know

We all prayin for you in Jesus name.   Remember to believe on his death, That he died and rose again on the third day. God has been so good to us Americans.

Who is NBA Youngboy? To the blind, he is the light. To the hungry, he is bread. To the sick, he is the cure. To the lonely, he is company. To the sad, he is joy. To the prisoner, he is freedom. For the poor, he is treasure. For me, he is everything.
The haters are just mad what you have young boy keep it up

About the opening caption. Don't bother with the Books of Mormon yal, he's searching for spiritual peace but that ain't it. The Mormons is an OLD WHITE RELIGION and Yahushua/Jesus ain't that. It's spiritual indoctrination frfr

@NBA YOUNGBOY 🏴‍☠️
If anybody looks at the beginning of the video, the way his baby mom looks at him. Looks like she's been beaten and going through some stuff. I can say this cuz I've been to the abuser and have also been the witness to the victim. hopefully he comes to justice , and hopefully they both can have the strength to move on
Tell the haters I said hey😂

Someone mentioned this artist, so I had to check it out. Literally sounds exactly like every other rapper out there. They all sound the same. There is no unique sound in rap anymore. Autotune and migos  ruined rap. Thanks to those two, ALL rap sound the same for the past 8+ years.

I really hate how a song like "Murda Business" and "Bad Bad" break the internet. but something as powerful as this, REAL FUCKING MUSIC, and it's not even at 10. the World makes zero sense to me. it's not even bout yb, it's bout what we literally choose to consume/be. yb's career def reflect it the easiest
Haters

yb you so nice now whenever i hear you talk it remains me of this one person in my mind, I don't know the figure but it's a picture of a good person who just trying to ''stop the violence.''
“Tell Charleston white ima gangsta who been mislead wrong obviously leading wrong”  he’s so humble ❤
The cameraman your ass showing the address. Youngboy watch his ass
This song helps me through so much . "I'm blessed so how can I complain" . He my GOAT.

He's come a long way. Good for him
Alma n Amulek some straight gangstaz!! This tracc🔥🔊
My favorite scripture 😭😍 Alma 36:19 ❤️
Fire
NAA  6:05 his shoe collection is crazyyy
YB gave me EMO vibes with this music video lol
good on you man! love that scripture verse btw. 🥰👌
Bro looking like the black Terminator with that fit on
So happy you've decided to be LDS brother when I was really down in high school and sinning a lot I listen to Ur music every day it helped a lot and now this song is whole new vibe and I'm here for it I'm so happy you've decided to get baptised you can do this 🫀
Gay
Love Alma 36:18
I personally am a fan of the old school music but after hearing that you're converting to the LDS church I couldn't believe it! I'm glad you have decided to make the right choice in changing yourself to be a better person, and hope the music you produce now, will only help, not only yourself, but other's to stop the violence. I'm all here for this type of change in the rap game. Bless up YB! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro I heard you just got converted and I respect that. There’s a lot of videos out there about you being converted and describing the religion but putting the exact opposite of what it means in the video😂😔 They’re spreading more false info
Love you like a brother yb, from SYDNEY Australia.
Just pls I got a feeling you might capp nle
Jk

Bro nba leave nle alone or
🔝 4L
the development is crazy. As an artist. As a person. And the fact that his numbers gradually drop as he grows as a person, leaving his pain and past behind, it show what "fans" really think of you. they just here for the adrenaline they get from the traumas put over these beats. but when you wanna be better and actually DO better, they turn their backs. even at 27, 23yrold YB really does teach me a lot about understanding myself internally, about Life. literally one of his best songs of his entire career with a very intense message, another one that should be in the 100Ms
I just saw the interview about him converting to the LDS church. As member it was weird to see a book of Mormon scripture at the front. He would be one the last ones I thought would join the church but anyone can change its pretty cool.
fck the haters lil top on top of  the mountains rn
OCustomize
vibe
NBA young boy songs gonna be playing in places that ain't never played rap. Keep pushing for the moon young king. 💪
🐐🐐🐐
Saludos desde Ecuador, sigue adelante, ningun paso atrás, cosas grandes son las que te esperan.

Alma 36:18 in the beginning from the Book of Mormon
Young boy I love that verse from the Book of Mormon. The book has changed my life and can change every heart of man/woman if they sincerely strive to get closer to their Heavenly Father. Much love ✌🏼
The scripture from the beginning of the video is from the Book of Mormon..
youngboy do you play fortnite
Love the Book of Mormon quote
Youngboy it brings me so much joy to see you quote Alma in your video! thank you
Book of Mormon plug 👀
Alma spittin fr fr

Dude freaking amazing!
No way this street nigga turning Mormon… I’m a have to see it to believe it
Yes! He's finally LDS.
That opening verse comes from a book called The Book of Mormon. It's awesome! Book it's free, you guys should read through it ✊🏽✊🏻
The Best way to start this 2023 is with God, I know that the book of Mormón is a blessing for those who open their hearts.
BEAST!!!!

His voice just sounds like he’s 13 and very whiny. It’s offbeat too, I just don’t see it.  Good for him for having success. People like him,  so he must be good. Music is so subjective.

Painted nails? Smh why is the industry trying to feminize our boys trying to grow up to be men. they ask what’s killing our youth. I’d say it’s the media, the music industry and social media. These kids need us as parents to step up,love them unconditionally and believe in them. … stay blessed

I'm proud of you Youngboy 😎🙌🏽💪🏽💨🤟🏼🔥💯
I just released my new song called Too Hard let me know what y’all think I’m the hardest white boy out no cap 💪
1 Corinthians 10:21 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.
🫀
funniest part bout all this is rappers faking streams while this man got a following of a goddamn nation behind him. love it
fuck the haters
@7:07 & @7:21 Dude showed your address numbers. Erase that YoungBoy frfr. Some ppl just can't be trusted and some don't mean to so accidents occurs without being careful. I love ya dawg edit that out now. And @7:36 you tag. It ain't hard to figure small things out. Becareful out there G
Dear, NBA YoungBoy... I'm from Georgia my dawg. I watched you grow G. For a minute I wouldn't listen to you until untouchable came out  Then I seen you stood on your words, it brought me in. Bruh, nomatter if they watching you through the scope. Don't let them guy kill you off and keep Nick with you through the end. Nick seem to be genuine. We all change, got saved we can change our ways. But I be damn if I let a man take me down if I can help the situation. C murder gone hold you down. I grew up on no limit, cash money... When I heard you... You are the next level to Boosie. But past Boosie. You like the new Birdman of this Generation ❤️💯 ps Don't let them stop you.. you can change, but don't leave your team behind. All the ones who rode need that same love. But the ones who betray let'em stay where they at!? And get elite security ex marine sniper you can't go wrong and the u.s has them too. Be safe my boi. Atlanta don't hate you. And Gucci is a good person. If you talk to Gucci,  I'm sure he'll listen. Gucci just been like that in Atlanta for years  He love everybody enough to do song with. He the pioneer of this trap shit.  So everybody he bump into. He gone do one. I don't think in my mind Gucci has beef. But 21 slaughter gang does and no one else. Bc Atlanta love you more. You get bumped all over north Gwinnett and south Fulton. Call Gucci mane G...once you make that peace with him & Boosie. You good. I think Boosie was sliding on them boys on the low in the A for you. That's why he was like come fwm mane. Really alot of Atlanta love Boosie. But not bc of the bloodiest summer in Atlanta. So it's a little in the air about Louisiana boy. Make peace with Boosie fly him out to a undisclosed location not home, have your professional security. And y'all talk that shit out like John Gotti & Sosa... Keep going NBA YoungBoy 💯
Shit hard
Tyson my boy 😂👌🏾
Fuck y’all haters

https://youtu.be/MBmldfe6myA
Tyson vs anybody 👀
Say top when they coming with the OGs Vap 🤒
I truly wish YB and his family that best. Lord please watch them alln❤
Whats the name of that red jacket 👀 top wearing?
That's a gta
The industry will wack you before they let you have generational wealth! I pray YB can make it out. Hollywood is satanic and full of puppets who are there to trick you and set you up  ( jay z , j prince, Rick Ross, p diddy, etc etc ) before you try to get out. YB already sold his soul but I hope he can be saved. They recently baited YB With a 60 million deal . But guess what ITS NOT THERE, they was never giving that to him .

* For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.   (1 Samuel 15:23) * Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.   (Revelation 2:16) * Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:   (1 Peter 5:8) * thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.   (Deuteronomy 6:5) * We are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.   (1 John 5:20)

Hi Haters!!!!!!
Were u tryin to make a long story short by saying stop the violence. Basically u felt like rowdy should have made his long story short wit stop the violence . Cuz so far I think that some people feel like u were telling Rowdy to shut up being hostile wit it which make people wonder what well what's wrong wit u n who was hating on u cuz honestly this is confusion
That's Growth when you can say"Hi Haters" When you can love your enemies and the ppl who treat you wrong, that's love!!!! Only Jesus can help us do it!🙏🏾✌🏿❤ Nice song!!!!
Apple Music ?

Talk bout a bad child hood; my mom passed away on my 2nd birthday and my father was in prison so I ended up in the system, until my dad got out in '97 and was out a week and I found him overdosed, had the needle in his arm still. I was 7 then and my aunty n uncle took me in thinking they would get money for me but nope, so after I wasn't a check for them they beat me and treated me bad. I fought back when I was 13 and I ran away to the block and been on my own since, the streets raised me. I'm 30 now and just had my first son after doing 7 years in prison, I'm trying to break the cycle n give my son the life he deserves n the life I always wanted.... My son's mom ain't around, so I'm a single father, a 2 time felon, a recovering drug addict, and still trying to figure it out. I always tell myself there's ALWAYS someone out there that has had it worse, and that's what keeps me going.... Staying strong for my son, and he likes listening to music so it keeps us focused
I know nba youngboy not worried, but you camera man exposed your address homie🤦
Yo .... i aint on my phone.......     K   A   R  I In darkest light ill be fighting near home mob ..  yo let me know  .. so i can let ya know.....switch up. ...blad up    Ak1DPGT1+2   I aint ony phonr

Sorry but I was blown about the first part of this video I stopped the video on your beautiful daughter, because I just have to say this I will watch the rest after but anyways.

IMA FAN
† We are all born with a sinful nature. To live eternally in paradise and escape eternal torment in hell, we must accept the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross.  Even though Jesus is God, He came to earth to be a sacrifice for us so that we could live with Him, God the Father and God the Holy Spirit forever. We can't save ourselves by doing good works. Only faith in what Jesus did will save us. Just by believing in our hearts that Jesus died for us, we are saved eternally. It can't be lost no matter what. After that, we trust God to do good works in us. It's all about what Jesus did, not what we have done or will do.  This is the gospel: 1 Corinthians 15 3 Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures Trust in this gospel to save you from your sins    †
Gee 😟😊

Yb ka stance. Mvana pta 012🔥
Is everyone here saved? Our relationship with God is the only thing that matters. God is real and God is love. God wants us to love Him above everyone and everything in exsistence. God also wants us to keep His commandments, love our neighbors as ourselves, and do our best not to sin. We all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. This is why God sent His son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for our sins so that all those who believe in God, do their best not to sin, and to live a life that is pleasing to God will not perish but have everlasting life. Heaven and hell exsist and the things we say and do in this lifetime will testify for us or against us and determine where we spend eternity. Forgiving others is very important. If we can't forgive others. God will not forgive us.  Always remember our enemies are demons not the people they work thru.  God expects everyone who knows the truth to tell everyone who has been decieved.  There is only one way to God and eternal life and that is thru Jesus Christ.  Keep God first, study His word, love and pray for everyone else as much as you pray for yourself.  There's power in prayer. God is love and love is the fufillment of God's law.  Freedom is free and Jesus Christ is the 🔑🔑🔑

Chicago in here check in
“Alma” is no where to be found in the Holy Bible. What is this world coming to. Making up different religions and serving Satan on the side. I cannot wait til Jesus comes back to stop this recklessness. I highly suggest you straighten your life out, Either your death, or Jesus Christ will come back soon, whichever is first. If you don’t want your soul saved, that’s on you.  You can be forgiven for all of your sins, regardless of what you’ve done. Anyone looking to be saved, I’ll post the Word below.  Hear the Gospel Romans 10:17 Believe the Gospel Romans 1:16 Repent of sins Acts 17:30 Confess Christ Romans 10:9-10 Baptism Mark 16:16 Be baptized in water for the forgiveness of your sins and be added to the church of Christ.
Love when Youngboy drops positivity like this🥶❤‍🔥
I pray who reads this peace love nd true purpose within life 🙏💚

Fire ass Lloyd sample
I love this song, it hits so much different then other songs!!!
Dam! Little short stint in jail turnt him out. Oh no! He was gay all the time. That was just his way of coming out the closet. Signing with kissing in the mouth Birdman was the first sign. Now he's wearing the symbols of homosexuals out in public and in his video. Watch out Nas X, now you have some furious competition. It's Lil Darius or Anti Da Menace now.
Thank you for being my friend I know how it feels at the end..
Fire new generation yb but he always gon him inside 🔥🔥🔥
Finally somebody rocking a nice ass jdm car !!!!

DADS AT WAR ON CHRISTMAS 2022 !! Where would I be without you dad My hero of night and day? I'm so glad you love my mother And think of us when you pray.  The last time we had Christmas You reached for me with your hand. I looked at you, then made a wish That I might be just half the man.  I love my father of Earth, And I love my Father of Heaven. It's a lot for me to love, you know For I’m only eleven.  Mom and I sure miss you Since you left to defend our flag. When others ask, where’s your dad I can't help but share, cry and brag.  The harder the conflict we sometimes face The far more glorious is the victory. Tyranny like hell is tough to defeat When it raises its head throughout history.  War never leaves a country as it was When neutrality is a word disregarded. As the murderous hands of man himself Are to blame for all who have departed.  By Tom Zart Most Published Poet On The Web Google = Bush Tom Zart
As a young and upcoming artist im looking up to this

Who is NBA Youngboy? To the blind, he is the light. To the hungry, he is bread. To the sick, he is the cure. To the lonely, he is company. To the sad, he is joy. To the prisoner, he is freedom. For the poor, he is treasure. For me, he is everything.
Woahhhh was not expecting that 240 new fav rapper
Why does Youngboy never put these on spotify anymore ?
Closet like a store
YoungBoy vs Lil Wayne debate begins now
😭😭😭come to South Africa
First rapper to ever shoot a video with a stanced Nissan 😮‍💨😮‍💨

Yo kentrrell, the small chance you read this I want to rely on enough to sacrifice my time to write this message. Your music has had the biggest impact on my life, like no other artist. I don’t know everything about your story, or the help you receive, but this product is heroin. (the music, in comparison to the rest in the same genre.) I think you’ve been set up as the king of the rap game/flex. It’s all vanity but damn it’s produced 🔥
Wen dis song go b on Apple Music??🤔
Never new the king liked my dream car
Fire beat
@5:27 thank you for being my friend 💔

The goat 🐐 Youngboy is on demon time 😈😈😈😈

Great blessings to young toung man. I see the great energy in your spirit! I wish you and your family well. Everyone makes mistakes,
Yes.
🧿✨🙏
He ain't regular ray bands are popular to us poor folks
nah YouTube bank probably empty yb keep getting millions of views
4:40-4:45 where yb get them shoes box holders from ? I need them
how this not trending #1 ????
whoever made that instrumental .... wow
He need to drop that last song ASAP🔥
NBA YoungBoy, “Thank you for being my friend”  Me: I’m your friend too!!! We all are💯🤞🏽
It’s hard for me to say this I’m officially a NBA youngboy fan now I like dude 🔥
Came here to get away from those “authentic views” comments hopefully we are safe here
The label make them paint nails and do odd stuff for attention get more ppl talking about them like the herpes rumors all that he did for $ they pay him to do that stuff why u think a lot rappers do weird shi like young thung wearinf a dress all that stuff is for publicity
Let the dog use the restroom

Being on house arrest in 2:48 Utah looks much more fun, relaxing, and productive than being in BR. I enjoy seeing how nba has matured in this short time. Living in the mountain west is the shit mugs just don’t know! You can have the hood I want acres in the high country!
‘Thank you for being my friend’❣️ I felt that  I like #YB  🎶  he has a good fanbase & kids 👀 🆙 to him I 💭 he can make a change for better & have kids 💭 differently he just needs the right person to lead him in that direction 🤲🏾 positive vibes i wish #YB the best 💯
Versatile...🔥😉
"thank you for bein my friend" hit
I’m so impressed that he literally makes a new song every week ! And is constantly putting out music videos !

YoungBoy just gained a new fan mayne
🌈🌈 🌈🌈🍬🍬🍬🍬🎐🎐🍭🍭🎠🎠🎽🎽💎  *Because of  love. God sent His Son Jesus Christ to die in our place. Three days later. Rose him  from the dead.*   *Now. By Jesus Christ alone.

What shoes are those
🦝

Why paint his nails tho? I don't know so call real gangsta who do that but that's just being wondering why he trying to push that agenda he didn't come in like that

If there is anyone who would like to have a relationship with God, kindly do the following: 😊😊😊😇😇 1. Pray the following prayer. 2. Pray this prayer willingly, genuinely, and wholeheartedly. 3. Pray this prayer out loud.  Here is the prayer:  “Dear Lord Jesus, Thank you for laying Your life on the cross for my sins. I ask you to forgive me. Come into my life. I receive You as my Lord and Saviour. I confess with my mouth that You are Lord. And I believe in my heart that God raised You from the grave. Now, guide me to live for You the rest of my life. In the Name of Jesus Christ, I pray. Amen.”  The preceding is what you need to do to have a relationship with God. Strongly and kindly consider doing it. Thank you. 😊😊😊😇😇

#1 goooo
Funny I didn't know how popular this guy is because none of my social pushes him to me until now and seeing 2m views tells me this is status quo of young American blacks now. Clearly y'all will produce the generation that eats itself to survive bc the braincells is gone and y'all just gonna produce savagery of the lowest quality. Hope I'm gone before y'all take over. I see it in my nephews. Mediocre is taking over.
dude i cant understand hiiiiiiiiiim, nice song tho

he coulda had a way badder bitch but he chose a smurf
A serious question to all the fans: can you imagine that he is cloned or like not even the real nba youngboy no more who they show in front of the camera? Because i dont know him that well but i can imagine that there is something going on but definetelly did he sold his soul kinda thing cause he dropps so much music because he has to do it to get free and independant i think but i dont know if its true maybe he makes it just for fun that much amount of music
Im yo biggest fan but I love aal the way in Columbus
1.9M Bitch doing #’S
Remember y’all give this man his flowers now. Sooner or later he gone be outside doing tours. With all the bridges this mans have been burning I will not be supposed if he gets shot. Don’t want nun to happens to dawg. Just y’all hype him up to be this bad dude. Now he is. He gots more enemies to count on both hands. Stay blessed but you know how this usually goes. If not shot dead he gone be in prison for 10+

Kentrell Gaulden, God hereby calls you to repent today! You claim the name of Jesus Christ, but are you serving Him as your Lord and Master? I hope so  “On that day, many will say to me, ‘Lord Lord, did we not cast out demons in Your name, prophecy in Your name, and do many great things in Your name?’ And I will say to them, ‘I never knew you, depart from Me you workers of lawlessness.’ “ Matthew 7:22  There no longer remains any sacrifice for sins if you blaspheme the Holy Covenant and call Christ’s blood something to throw around loosely. You have only a certain fearful expectation of judgement and Hell to follow.   Repent while you still have breath, cry out to God while He still hears you. Follow Christ’s commandments, give your ill gotten gains to the poor, stop taking drugs and give up your sin, or Christ will say “I never knew you” on the day of judgement.   “God is angry with the wicked every day.” - Psalm 7

Good to see so much positivity out of you. You're blessed in talent and in blessings in general playboy. Getting caught up in Street shit and possibly losing it all just so the "opposition" can get rich in turn from speaking on it in their shit ass tracks ain't worth a damn. Plus, how do you suppose you have "oops"? From what I can tell nobody has near enough leverage to "oppose" you. Opposition by definition has to be capable of opposing. They can oppose dis dick.... Bet they lose too!
This the☝🏽 ❤❤
Aye youngboy I see God getting to you. Keep going 🫱🏾‍🫲🏼

Jesus is coming soon! Repent, believe the Gospel, and be converted to new life in Jesus Christ today! Tomorrow is not promised! Jesus Christ is the only way to the Kingdom of Heaven and the only name that can save you!  Romans 10:9 ~ That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
Very cool track and video! I'm on repeat! 🚀🔥❤❤❤
Thats camber nissan s13 dope too🔥🔥
Beside everything else personal, he makes really great music 🗣
Hey young Girl .... Hey Young girl... Young Girl rl ..... most of you won't know where this beat is from ... But Big up to Lloyd
still on painfull voice
your fav rapper paint his nails
💚💚
For this man to be basically locked up for what about 2 years now and still put out a song I haven’t liked is outrageously great 😂💚
mfs always gon hate either way when you up or when you down, his nails being painted black he ain't and wasn't the only mf to start doing that but ifwi bc it's like a form of expression and he's a top tier expressionist with the way he carries himself with his music being so versatile asf, not a BIG fan but will always be a fan of this nigga no matter what and this vid was dope af only if YB turned this shit into a small documentary or did it part by part,  it'll trend 🔥
That "thank you for being my friend"
Can't believe he shared a book of Mormon verse at the beginning of the music video

This song isnt shit and all but this whole video cringe for real like also it kinda looks a ways with the no cap beef cause he brought up them nails then and people was saying he be beefing when he got some dropping and we all know homie sensitive to them nail comments but this video he gave off a vibe like he was trying to look tough with it on and play it up like this is a ha ha f the haters thing when it kinda comes off as sorry idk could just be me but this was the first video i felt that way like he was trying to pull a Kodak vs jack boy move highlight one thing then act like you dont care about that one thing by tossing it in peoples faces like you dont care about it like yak with the money but saying he dont care bout the money yb going I dont care about make up on my nails but look at my nail or i dont give a fuck what you think about my nails or fuck you talking bout my nails... all this it just comes of cringe as fuck to me especially when you was just talking bout them in the middle  of your beef then when you drop a vidoe i comes off like your trying to make people focus so much on it smh idk man like i said the song is meh its ok its not bad but that video is what really the thing that aint doing it for me music wise it all just feels like a awkward kids video
Top
You know he's kid's are gonna be talented n hopefully he's around to guide them in the right direction!

He ain't yo friend! Dude videotaped YB's address number and car plates. Come on now, dude is slipping! The internet is the world! A crazed fan will zoom-in and find YB's location. Next time, blur out what needs to be private. I must say, his house is nice, but its time to say:   "Hit the road, Jack! And don't cha come back no more." -Ray Charles.
Keep remaining you! 💯🖤 NBA ALLAH GOT YOU

I don’t get why people still listen to yb. I haven’t lsitened to anything for a lil and this song popped up so i checked it out . His shit when he first started dropping mixtapes was good but it seems like this with a lot of artist the more dumber the music gets the more popular the artist gets . The auto tune and fuckin moaning sounds pretty gay to me. And I just heard this dude painting his nails lol.
This song is 🔥🔥🔥 we need a lot more happy/thankful YB songs fr

Firstly, what does black nail polish symbolize? It can mean different things to different people, but generally, this color is said to symbolize strength, confidence, power. These are traditionally seen as “masculine'' traits, so it is not surprising that men choose to wear this color.

Brooo youngboyyyy omg the best rapper outchea fr
Mane say. This song makes you just realize that the violence needs to stop. Quit doubting yourself over these b*tches. Every obstacle that comes your way don't stop and cry about it. Get over that sh*t and keep running. Still protect yourself at all cost. Live life to the fullest and protect your circle and family if you close. Don't worry about this n*ggas and b*tches. Let GOD handle them. Pray to him too tho. Fr💯. Life too short and too beautiful to let this bullsh*t get to your head and f*ck up your future. It's gonna be ok😌
A hater don't like a hater😂

He just playin n it's still heat.
The verse at the beginning of the video comes from The Book of Mormon, in the book of Alma. The Book of Mormon tells how an Israelite family from the tribe of Joseph(Ephraim and Manasseh) escaped Jerusalem to a new land across the sea right before the Babylonians came and invaded and took captives out of the Holy Land. Interesting stuff.
He be delivering so many different styles and shutting people up who think he only rap about murder

If If Youngboy thinks, I agree. If Youngboy speaks, I listen. If Youngboy fails, I fail. If the world is against Youngboy, I am against the world. If Youngboy has 7 billion fans, I am one of them. If Youngboy has no fans, it’s because I no longer exist. I love NBA Youngboy.

Who is NBA Youngboy? To the blind,he is the light. To the hungry, he is bread. To the sick, he is the cure. To the lonely, he is company. To the sad, he is joy. To the prisoner, he is freedom. For the poor, he is treasure. For me, he is everything.

Youngboy is so inspirational he even has his own pledge “i pledge allegiance to the flag of 4kt and the slime nation of nba one nation under kentrell indivisible, with liberty and justice for youngboy” youngboy is my god he saved me from depression and i no longer have cancer because of the lord youngboy i prayed to him every second for him to heal me but ever since he got locked up again i went on stage 4, for cancer then i prayed and then the king got free. youngboy is my lord and savior i live and breathe youngboy, everything i do is for youngboy, youngboy is my father, i’ll kill for youngboy, youngboy is god 👊🏾🙏🏾. youngboy is the best rapper alive if he has a number 1# fan it’s me if youngboy don’t breathe i don’t either if youngboy die i die simple as that and if u don’t believe in young boy our god ur the reason why the human race will come to an end u shouldn’t be on this planet  😹😹🤡🤡 youngboy will transcend and save us. If youngboy gets locc up up for 7 years imma Barry my self til he gets out n every second imma jerk off to him and trying to process why is he so good at er thing he do

YoungBoy has truly changed my whole entire life. I was first a clueless, senseless individual, until YB. He took me under his wing and guided me through his delightful path. I have since then changed into a charming handsome man. I wish all other non-YB listeners will at last find this path as it will lead to the whole world being in harmony and peace at last. No single individual outshining others such as Kentrell has been graced to us since the beginning of time. When miracles like James Johnson III touch down to our planet, the clouds clear and the birds start chirping. I wouldn't be so surprised if YB is the reason we are able to breathe, eat, and hear everyday. When YB is played upon the ears of one, they come at peace, being able to outmaneuver and look down on others. If one is not fond of YB, you can take a observation out of the others, they are sad, unjoyful, and melancholy. They do not understand that would take a bullet for us, just as we would for him. It is truly enraging.

I used to hate on youngboy, really for no apparent reason. I thought he wasn't really a good rapper, but I sat there and thought about it and I never once listened to any of his music. I started listening to his music bar for bar and I just wanna apologize to youngboy for sitting thinking all negative when he really is one the best out right now. DONT SLEEP ON THIS MAN
