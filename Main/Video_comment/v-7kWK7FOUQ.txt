aight time to cook vik
Ellum calling someone a sweaty nerd is so ironic
Beyonty hyenter
26:00
The older these videos the dumber Danny is. Crazy to see he's still dumb as hell
19:01 Hilarious Tobi reaction again
Danny needed to stfu and let lazar help him 😅😂😂😂
2 yrs late but josh couldve just sabotoged comms and deji would be unable to see on cams
The bounty hunter is like the Juggernaut
32:49 he says while he only has 1 donne 😅😂
Deji masterclass 😂🔥
thats what you do when you have no brains.. sit on cams
Im grateful they added task to view cameras as it becomes to boring other wise
If viz didn’t had done the reactor in the second game he would had easily won
Danny: I’m just gonna let Josh get away with it he’s done nothing to me.  2 Seconds Later  Danny: IT’S JOSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Danny just shouts. Everytime he's in a vid, I leave
You know danny might be the most annoying ytber
deji leveled up
Josh is a such a horrible player. 0 brain ... every single time.   He is there everytime becuz of the seniority.   I'm sick of it.
I love that he had a keyboard replacement ready to destroy his keyboard lol
11:10
Is it just me or is viz super annoying
Anyone here in 2025 >>>>>
Josh has to be the worst among us player I have seen in these lobbies
Deji on cams should be a meme hahahahahahaha 😂
The game really took that first round off from vik personally 😂
i like how deji's camera is off an he's screaming 11:49
Deji just sitting on cams makes it  boring to watch
These vidoes are great good to see people showing love to among us again
We need 10 million subscribers!
2:17 33:25
21:31
These losers need to get off cams
if you want to get rid of hiccups fast: don't just hold your breath. you need to tense your diaphragm too. Hiccups are caused by spasms in your diaphragm. tensing it stops it, (try pressing your hand gently against your stomach, tense your abdominal muscles and hold your breath for a few moments)
Isnt it weird how every first bounty was vik like let him live godammit
got my food ready
Danny’s an idiot 😂 12:34 He walks over the body on purpose and says he won’t call out Josh for the kill Then gets mad when he gets sussed for not reporting the body lol
GET OFF CAMS!!!!!
Deji actually hits it most of the time, he's smart
Ethan the legendary third imposter as always 😂😂😂
You all be dickriding vik
Please stop inviting  Viz
People like Deji make me feel more sympathetic capital offenders. The man is a malevolent dumb skin rash.
Vik owned josh in the end.
11:52 Deji 😭😭😭
Danny Aron’s w ac Milan fan
https://youtu.be/dfFAlEuDJZQ?si=ik5prFD4OfQ8_Mi3
i thought viz was meant to be smarter than defending himself by saying “i was with the person that died all round”
Toby has anime pictures in his room 20:41
honesty is the best policy 🤣
Danny did well as a bounty Hunter👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I lowkey miss Ellum in these videos
Y was vik in this vid
Ethan is so dumb
Viz pretending to follow football 😂😂
Is it only me or whenever I see Deji with his mouth open on a thumbnail, I hear him laughing, like right into my eardrums?
Danny is the worst player man....
nahh Danny is so stupid, and still calls everyone stupid. Is he too dumb to notice hes the dumbest person there?
Danny saying "I played that so fkn well" while doing something moronic truly shows how stupid this guy really is
12:00 😂
“19 years I’ve known that guy and this is how he treats me” 😂😂😂
Who is here in 1988
W
Jj not in the video not gonna watch
"Why was honesty the best policy there?"
Danny is so dumb. He never explained nothing. He's don't deserve that moment
I love how nobody says anything about Vik taking himself out in the first game or even Harry doing it sometimes as a joke but like Ethan even said, if he were to do it for example, he'd get ripped to shreds by all the overly biased and sensitive new fans that put some Sidemen members on a pedestal. I'm not saying get on any of the guys for it at all by the way, I'm just pointing out the clear double standards a certain section of the fans show in pretty much every single video they post on any of their channels and it's quite sad because a lot of them have other priorities that may distract them from time to time and if they have to take themselves out of a round of Among Us for example to take care of those, I don't see the problem and people need to chill as it really isn't the end of the world.
So glad they don’t feature Ellen much anymore he’s the most annoying person they’ve ever had on in these videos
did ellum start transitioning just before this video or something?
6:48 thats like JME's facecam when he plays
How does deji survive life being that stupid
I know I’m commenting on an old video but can we get some new roles. Like Greek god edition. Have a Zeus that strikes lightning or a Cleopatra that freezes/turns others to “stone”, Achilles you can run faster. Etc.😅
They all sucked at bounty hunter
6:03
Lmfao tobi 22:56
Vik can be the most unnecessarily soppy guy sometimes
12:07 😂😂😂😂
Ellum is so jarring
why is ellum even on these videos
you little sweaty neeeerd🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why do they always complain about someone being on cameras when they could sabotage comms
Simon doesn’t like Vik tbh fr😅 anyone else agree?👇🏼
Deji is so annoying with his loud voice and laugh
12:04 IAM C*NT IAAAAM 15:59
2:59
can someone just kill deji in every game, man just sit on cams and call it masterclass
q
Bro casually dropping gems and not getting is crazy 😂😂 but wp and nice seeing
0:59, Danny being imposter still sussing behz, genius
The fact Lazer beam has a extra keyboard just sitting there is hilarious
Viz should not done reactor
Danny really needs to chill tf out, every video is a chaos mode because Danny and deji just scream at the top of their lungs
watched
31:52 The Power Rangers colors being the only 6 alive
Best 3rd imposter 6:48
11:50
deji really camping on cams,  hahah if you want deji to get out on cams, sabotage the comms
bro dej actually annoys me 😭
Did josh kill on cam?
Simon always critiquing the other playing calling them stupid when he's watching the game so he know who it is
23:30
21:28 lanon being supportive is so wholesome
What i gonna say josh is u have to sabotage the connection so that the cams will not work
1:53, 5:10, 20:30 😂😂😂
°°/
.
Does anyone actually like Danny want an abseloute dork he is lmao looks like he's been through a mangle lmao
15:41 valid
Danny intentionally not reporting a body, gets blamed for it, and then calls everyone ELSE stupid....... Absolute moron.
Lat laxer talk Danny 😅❤
@1:00 Lazar just straight up unboxed a brand new Kay board to just throw it at the wall! 🤣 I’m deeeead 💀
Josh is actually so trash. What happened to him?  He had so many opportunities where he could’ve vented into cams killed deji and vented back.
MAY GOD BLESS YALL 🙏🏾
love how everyone decided to vote josh but deji just screamed saying its not him lol 11:52
Danny and Deji the low IQ duo 😂😂
I'm done with sidemen among us 😂I'm becoming dumber and dumber each video
I cant lie who do you all root for inposters or crewmate me personally its imposters
Sabotaging coms would fix the issue with people camping the cameras
Hi
loving the poster in tobi's room
Deji’s random accusations make my head hurt
Danny Aarons when he can't decide if he's letting Josh off the hook or if he's nailing him:  'So anyway, I started screaming.'
Ethan: "Danny's gonna have to hard clear me and I know he wants me voted out" Danny: "you know what I think I'll hard clear Ethan"
Viz low-key pisses me off in this game
Everyone fighting each other stupidity
17:35 What are the chances those
Bro where was Vik this video Bro got like 10 seconds  of screen time
0:58 Lannan just chucking his keyboard across the room 😂
Josh coulda eaily kill his bounty who was ethan standing on cams and the kill deji in cams. Woulda been a sick play
Danny Arron’s is a idiot
Danii glow uppp
Ethan, to combat the hiccups, take a deep breath, stick your tongue against the roof of your mouth and hold your breath while looking up at the ceiling, hold your breath like you did until you feel the air bubble go down. Don’t hold it too long and hurt yourself though. If it doesn’t work try again until it does. Works for me every time and hiccups drive me nuts. 😂
Can someone tell me how they get there games modded
Tobi playing the victim card. The most boring thing.
Danny is the man ,makes videos funny
People keep forgetting to sabotage comms, best thing to get rid of cams
34:20 - 34:21 Ayo
Fk deji and his cam's camping What a noobie
Deji is boring a.f sitting on cams constantly, worse than camping in cod
W
Ethan and deji are so bad
❌❌❌ SPOIL BLOCKER ❌❌❌❌
29:18 for once Danny didn't lose his mortgage
The video is very good, the blogger is very creative
This is absolutely incredible
12 min of the video was the funniest 😂 whos here in 2024 btw?
watching this gives me cancer
Lazar my Boi try to help but still these stupid people haaaaa
It's funny how Deji is actually smart and usually picks the right imposter a lot lol xD
Honestly people camping cams literally ruins the video.
17 20 23
Danny: *walks directly up to a body on cams and doesn't report* Danny after the meeting: "why do they think it's me I played that so well"
watching this back because I've got a banging meal
Rip Vikk
Why was vik photo was in thumbnail Did he there in this video...😂
Poor Vic
Why do the sidemen act asif cameras is op. Like call comms kill and vent out of cams its really that easy.
Josh was genuinely stupid he wasted the biggest chance to just vent in reactor to kill Ethan, or even take out comms to get rid of the cameras and just kill him instead of running away from the arrow that told him where Ethan was 😂
Lazar is just amazing…he always has an emergency keyboard😂😂😂
Deji likes ro ruin the games by not doing tasks. You guys get so many opportunities for task wins, yet him or JJ gets lazy.
How pink Danny turned shouting
never take ellum back he is so fkn annoying
Tobi brings in a whole lotta nothing in this videos 🤷
HE Is coming back sooner than you think ! That man is Jesus
0:53 this is hilarious 😂 buys keyboards just to break them😂😂
even though vik didnt speak that much he all over in the comments. Bro cooks really well!
i love deji's laugh
Deji so boring
13:28 ultimate crash out
Tobi hits that pity “vote me” thing too much
12:04
Josh saying 'jave to work around the camera, when if you sabotage comms, it turns it off 😄
Vik shod get red card
i’m starting to think danny is actually the smart one😭😭
It's fun to watch when dany gets imposter.
Danny has to be one of the dumbest people I’ve watched on youtube. Like almost every sentence that comes out of his mouth gives me a headache. Its not funny stupid either, like Ethan, he’s just stupid.
danny is such a tosser... ellum gave up and said he's the bountyhunter then he sees josh kill on camera then screams its deji
15:04  VIKSTA
Jesus Deji and ksi have the exact same laugh it’s crazy
19:07
Ban deji
5:26 tobi:oh wait i meant to vote myself  aw fuck got me dying
ELLUM IS SO DUMB
Josh  is so bad.
Vik is the best sideman
Lazer beam just casually opening a brand new keyboard just to break it
Danny won 2 times in a row is crazy
bounty hunter were shit ngl 😆
my like make this vid from 199k to 200 lol
Za water
9:18 LMFAO
awesome
Does anyone understand in these lobbies that comms disable cameras ffs 😅
15:31 viz was actually so dumb they could win as an imposter when the reactors going to shutdown😂
Nah cuz Danny is actually annoying af
Green fn😂
This was the first danny masterclass
does Josh not realize he can kill the person on cams or even call comms?
jobbins
اللغة العربية راقم واحد و هي من أقوى اللغة في العالم
deji’s laugh makes me smile
Danny:I am just gonna annoy Ethan even more. Ethan:oh my fucking god Danny  STOP
Ethan: i love the heart above my head 😂
No one but tobi : 19 yrs I knew that guy and that’s how he treat me 😂😂😂😂😂
Just disable cams or make it a red card offence or something. It’s genuinely so boring when you have cam merchants and Deji is the worst offender.
Simon just says Danny’s name for no reason I hate it when Danny gets picked on especially last video
Nah Danny’s an idiot 🤦🏽‍♂️
Danny saying deli do some task and he has only done card swipe 😂😂😂😂
the editing at 3:05 is such a tiny detail but is so well done
Tobi is such a fucking crying victim it's crazy
Josh sucks as imposter, hard to watch 😂
Surely with Josh as imposter and Deji just sitting on cams...Josh could've shut the doors to cams, vented in from electric or med and kill deji...eliminating the cam merchant...
Turn to Jesus and Repent of your sins🙏Amen.
you guys should do among us but everytime a meeting is called there’s a new killer.
12:35💀 bro went to the body and said nahh
let me join the sidemen
without vik's video this video is seeming incomplete
Zerkaa is so dumb and boring lmaooo 😂
danny is stupid not reporting it lmao he just made himself look like imposter
That Danny kid has a face for radio... It's disturbing seeing his face
New role ❌ deli on cams✅
Yeah, create more electronic waste for clicks...
Cause I don't have one
I hate my sister
Deji makes the videos sooo fun 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I swear
Deji is a perfect cam player
The segment at 18:37 to 18:43 is world class 😂 😭
I love the sidemen but the moment Vikkstar starts being unbothered or can’t be arsed with recording or being in the video it makes it soooo hard to bear him
I don’t understand why they don’t just vote out deli at the start of the game if they know he is just gonna sit on cams lol
Deji and Danny are hands down the dumbest human beings of all time.
"The Joshes together: Josh squared" -Josh 2023
okay but to be honest, had danny just reported the body first he would have these issues
Dejis laugh, and just overall voice is so annoying
Viz is so lame
15:41 He waited so long to say that
Wallahi deji's retarded
Deji the camera camper.
Honestly i love the edits.😂
Danny is a NEED
I love the mandalorian I'm waiting for season 4
DO A TASK DEJI AND YOUD KNOW! omg I cant. Im dead laughing.
Danny is getting much better, praise for Danny!
A
bro i just watch these videos to past time and i dont even really among us and i dont play it idk why i watch these videos
I hope Lazar has stopped spoiling keyboards. He could throw a phone book or something. I don’t like the plastic & e waste.
Josh fell off so hard in among us
These among us games are 90% Danny Aarons
I just love how lazer fucking just unboxes a keyboard then just break it lol.
Deji better than tobi on this?
deji “talking” is him yelling. pls i cant
Josh drinkin swedish nocco🫡
i like how almost every game its vikk thats the bounty 💀💀
Josh hates vik
Dej tryna vote Tobi bc his cam is off, then says Sidemen have no logic.
Behz is awful at reading people don’t know if he’s ever been right.
deji always saying to vote him out makes me mad
All the bounty hunters hate vikk
Oh hey that me!😂
Repent Jesus Christ is coming soon
Matthew 3:2
Okay. !
Danny is the most foolish person I have ever seen 😵😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵🥴 always play as 3rd imposter and think others are stupid
Vik was everyones first bounty😂😂😂
Tobi is so annoying in these fucking hell what a victim
Ellum is the British facial copy of clix
I felt so bad for Danny
What does killing bounties do???
Jesus Christ, Danny Aarons is hella annoying in this video
"YOU LITTLE SWEATY NERD!!!!" buckled me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You could have sabotaged comms josh
Harry man😅😅 portal
02:55 Ethan basically called Deji stupid 😭
What's the music in background when the kills are being done?
Tobi has stolen a living honestly.
Damn Ellum does suck at imp
If they wanted to be sweaty. Sabotage comms so they can’t see them kill on cams
The most boring among us
josh and ellum killing someone and getting caught on cams at the exact same place is crazy
"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"
The game always somehow puts vik as the first bounty
The game always somehow puts vik as the first bounty
This deji guy laughing makes me laugh everytime
Vik just decided to speak for 10 sec just to roast josh
how’s danny getting mad at everyone when he’s the one who purposely didn’t report the dead body he made himself look sus nd called everyone an idiot who thought he was the imposter😂
25:08
I fucking hate cams.
Instantly
Danny is stupid bro watched Behz do a visual task and didn’t clear him
i miss jj in theses videos 😂😢❤❤
I hate Tobi's voice, his yell and his laugh. Wow
We ain't gonna talk about how Josh could've killed Ethan outside security and since he was the bounty he could've went inside and killed Deji instantly, it would be fast enough to get away with before Simon came around and even better if Deji was his next bounty after Ethan he could've possibly slain Simon right there too and that would've just led to almost impossible odds of losing
If I ever in a million years play Among Us with Deji, I will never not trust him
Was i the only one who hold my breathe with Behz?
Imagine if Simon and Vikk were imposters  The lobby will have no chance  💀💀💀
Petition to kick danny out of these among us videos
Ethan -  swallow 3 times while holding your breath that gets rid of my hiccups trick
Danny and Ethan in nav oml had me creasin
Deji is the most funniest person .. he could easily beeing more fame than all sides together 😂❤❤
26:23 😂
Danny to be honest with you Aarons
deji is a mthfkin noob bruh
Why did Viz fix reactor with 10 seconds to go as an impostor?  Could've won the game in the first round
Vikk RUINED this video!!! 😡😡😤😤😠😤😠😡😠😡
Love these vid and the chaos all bring to it… BUT there are times I get frustrated voting only goes a set way because Danny just screams the whole voting time 🤣 in a way I feel like I’m there   Still it’s always funny AF
4:41       12:26       26:15     26:58
Definitely a yellow card for vik …
Why did vikk get targeted by the bounty hunter every game yet spoke like 3 words to tear josh apart 😂 he’s just there for the bants and to spectate I love it ❤
tobi such a crime merchant i mean he always says vote me when he is a killer jis pov is one of the lamest also such a boring lad and people call josh boring i dont know where they get that watching sidemen since 5-6 year ago and he is never the guy i like in gaming videos in more sidemen when behz make funny allegation just be a part of joke but he just make incoherent noises and faces.
A lobby with deji, Danny, ging, Lazar and ksi would be elite
15:01 Vik got into the bounty 3 times in a row! Wtf is that cursed luck bro! 🤣🤣 Or is the bounty set on Vik purposely? 🤣🤣
Deji being on cams with 2 bodies right behind him😭
Honestly low key kind of wish that people didn’t sit on cameras better content if the killers have a chance
Danny is top tier entertainment in these among us vids
Surely comms sabotage is the answer to excessive camera camping?
funniest one yet
I HOPE DEJI NEVER COMES BACK. All he does it sit on cams. Soo boring
The timer with ethan holding his breath got me 18:14
The ‘I think it might be Danny’ killed me😭😭😂
I love the little friendship Simon and dannyarrons have
people stink ❤
19:02
Honestly Danny is the dumbest of em all 😂 like seriously get some brain
Haha Deji and Danny is such jokes😂
“Na it’s tobi  “Why is it me!” “Tobi tobi look in your camera and say it’s not you”  😂😂😂😂😂
Actually hate Deji lol 😂
Josh slow 😂👎
This video shows why Danny is unbearable. How don't you just go with what Josh did for content.
DANNY IS LITERALLY THE MOST STUPID PERSON TO EVER PLAY AMONG US
idk why vik was in this video
i dont get why josh said deji on cams makes it harder. just sabotage coms and it disabled the cams
Viz was sad for sitting on cams I can't lie
4.9 million views in a month on among us is crazy 😂 more than some man’s monthly listeners on Spotify
You know I love the fact they don’t realise that sabotaging Comms turns off the cams and yet the very rare occasion someone does sabotage comms they’re all like “who the F” does comms” 😆😂
Tobi:‘WHAT THE FUCK!!’! 19:04
Danny goes full autist when people don’t listen too him
Deji’s laugh 🥹😭😭🔥🔥
Absolutely no one   Deji ; it's tobi ⚰️😭
Sidemen: omg who cuts comms??? Also Sidemen: omg they don't get out of cams
"Stooooop" nah he wont he is just a legend! These people only makiing it worse
Deji is soooooo dumb OMG...watching him play is giving me an anxiety attack...😮‍💨🤕🤦🏻‍♂️
Deji is a pretty good imposter
why ellum put on makeup
Does nobody sabotage comms to get people off cams?
danny never let’s lazar talk it must be frustrating for him lol😂
2:58  Ethan is the stupid one though 😂
Deji makes me laugh when he laughs
I love how the impostors completely forgot about sabotages
When Deji Got voted out i hear I Hate Being......... BEING SEEN AS THE BAD GUUUUUUY😢😢 Screaming  in my Head
"Deji, what you looking at??!!" 😂😂😂
Lazar just buying computer kit to break it.... 😂😂
these sidemen among us videos are 🔥
Lmao at danny acting like he made a big brain play by seeing the only remaining impostor kill someone and then somehow fucking up so hard that he gets suspicion on himself
ive been watching sidemen since they started the group, but now all i watch is theese among us, its way to fun, should collab with beta squad in this would be awesome
Vik didnt say much but tbh he didnt rly get a chance in the first 3 rounds
18:38 Killed my self then dies ffs
Danny has a voice that makes syphilis seem enjoyable
Danny is him a.k.a HIMothy 😂😂😂
Deji just accused Tobi bcz he phased through the doors when closed... He couldnt understand that it was a glitch... He is so stupid bro with that stupid face
Vik just CBa to play anymore 😂
33:26
No point in vik and Tobi
Deji is thick af
rly ironic Ethan’s calling deji stupid 💀 deji called out more imposters in the handful of videos he’s been in than Ethan who’s in every single one…
You guys should have a gentlemans agreement that there's no sitting on Cams till you complete all your tasks...
why is it always danna arrons
na deji and his tasks🤣
That angelic music with the 2 dead bodies behind Deji just staring at cams had me absolutely rolling 😂 that was a brilliant bit of editing
Bro just told everybody where the body was. 11:28
Deji is hilarious asf man😂😂 He is becoming even more hilarious after every video😂  He is a GEM
14:38 wtf is blud talking, new genji ultimate sound?
8:24 Is Viz Asian or high
Lazar smashing that keyboard was hilarious 😂😂😂
Ngl Ellum's "YouTube Voice" is quite annoying.
ellum is so annoying bro😭😭😭 9:27
Dani talks to much
Danni: I played that so fing well they are stupid   Also danni : *walks over the body it while someone is on cams and then walks away *
Vik Has been everyone's first Target as a bounty Hunter 😮😅+ I beat ethan's record of not breathing in 40 seconds😅
Danny not reporting that was the biggest throw of all time
Please make more among us videos ❤❤ please
I love lazar
Nah let's not rinse Vik, I'd give up on life if I had to play this game with Danny Aarons too
the only video where Lazar has his anger issues in control  I enjoyed this xD
Danny with his stupidest tactics lmao
Deji playin in his kitchen?
Viz is too sweaty. He literally lives in Among Us
3 vikk in a row commrbts… also saw in screen after memeulous house (re end warch) finish n saw new one… hidden camera??? Interesting… so watchimg this fikally One month aho tho lol
Is vik ok?
What happened to vik
Imagine sitting on cams first round what a loser play ngl
Danny, Ethan, Ellum and Tobi have zero IQ... I can't believe Ethan has a child, I feel sorry for that poor little girl
Why does that autistic guy keep screaming in these vids? 😂
Surely vik gets a yellow for this
We need more among us
nice
27:52
13:30
22:53 "19 years I've known that guy" had me laughing xD
Vikk being the Bounty twice in a row, and being killed more than three times first is crazy 💀💀
More among us
Love all these among us videos it’s strange Danny aarons is always the imposter majority of the time funny thougj
18:42  get *clucked*
So was this the last among us video
Will Mario cart ever come back
deji is so quick to peak his mic lmao
why deji so loud?
I hope they release a new sidemen among us videos.
8:56 Ellum going off had me deadd ☠️
like how danny calls them idiots when he set himself up 12:31
Why No one talking about Lazer Breaking keyboards? Thats the best highlight lol 😂😂
Is there away to play all the roles like the chaos mod like all  together
denji makes these vid so much funnier
"it could be danny aarons masterclass"
let me play i will no diff all of you NOOBS
When we gonna get Sidemen Among Us in VR? 👀
Will you be doing videos on the new map coming out. The fungle one?
12:03 16:10
Angry ginge in a sidemen among us would be hilarious
Imagine being in a video without actually being in the video
30:28, they recreated that spiderman meme
Vikk disappearing all video, people voting for themselves and telling everyone else to vote for them, grouping, cams camping, so boring. Whats the point
Idiot danay
Danny Aarons and masterclass do not belong in the same sentence. 😂
When Danny Arrons said I don’t know what I feel about that because he was imposter with Tobi is the definition of racist
Saitama
Deji is funny af
GET ANGRY GINGE IN AMONG US VID
Among us getting a new map! Sidemen gotta make a video of that map soon
Invite angry ginge for the next episode I wanna see a angry ginge and Danny Aarons collab
Among us for 8M sub
should've went through vents to kill Deji Josh
Josh sucks at amon us
Vikk just roasted josh.
Ethan actually played with 150 IQ😂😂
Nah im gonna watch it hit 8 mil
So thoughtful of Ellum to call Viz “Unique” so lovely 🥰
Mad how if Ethan acted like Vik that game peple would be on him
lazer destroying keyboard 😭🤣
Vik ? Where you 😂
Blow this up if you want to see angry ginge in these among us videos
Elum coulda called bs and said that they were viz and tobes were teams m8z smh.
Deji has become The Harry of the game and KSI at the same time! JJ throws like Deji and Harry does the cam marching like Deji. So with a guy of two idiots, who needs Harry??
Doug the bounty hunter. Goated 14:43
No way Deji didn’t see the second body😂
How didnt anybody pick up on Viz saying "i didnt see the BODIES" when Toby only said he saw one body.  Pay attention boys!
wheres the next one!!! always end up rewatching every single one again before a new one comes out
We need an among us where the imposters don’t know who the other imposters are
Deji laugh 😂😂
I love lazarbeam smashing keyboards😂😅
The funny thing is that’s the same thing JJ does when he plays just sit on cams the whole time 🤣
destroying key boards 😂😂😂 what a waste of money when you could donate them to the poor or something 😂
Can't believe they can make this dumber, and then they invited deji💀
You realize that if someone is sitting on cams, then you can just sabotage comms and then they can’t see on cams
12:18 danny your the one who's stupid mate
Just sabotage the coms then kill Deji though
Need more among us 😂
Nothing better than amongus sidemen vid
get angry ginge in the next sidemen among us
get angry ginge in
He was I die
get speed in on among us 😂😂😂😂
need more of these
The sidemen need anonymous votes
25:25 personaltime
tobi always acting the victim is so annoying
"Sounds like a skill issue"😂
Vik deserve a red card
Petition to get angreyginge in a sidemen among us 👉
Josh ALWAYS lose his teammate first round when he’s imposter
Man like Doug the bounty hunter shout out tgf
we honestly need ginge to join sidmen amougus
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
I don't care about Vik being absent from the video but if Simon or Behz did what Vik did this video, they would both get so much hate.
vikk was in his feelings for this episode
Among us is sauce and watching it at a very suspect percentage of sixty nine percent
Pls can i join
please dont let vik, danny or deji come back, they are ruining it
Can I maybe join sometime pls
Josh squared? Wtf Zerkaa
Man camera merchants are toxic
22:50 that statement made lough in with my tears out
Wheres harry
i have a suspicion that vikk was an ai or looe someone else is controlling his acc and his contribution with talking was pre recorded or something MY MAN WAS DESD THE WHOLE VID
Pieface was ruining the previous among us videos
Dont backbite
Plz can somebody tell me is it possible to play this ( a lot of roles ) mode in mobile phone
Let danny coooooooookkkkkkkk😂😂😂😂😂
Bro Danny put himself in that situation😂
I liked Vikk roasting Josh.
Vik is depressed....may lord save him🙏🙏
Vik being first on the bounty’s hit list . Deji makes up for KSI's absence. These brothers are so funny .
Bro tobi is always doin the guilt trip stuff, it kills the whole vibe of him trying to defend and kills the chance for some funny content, it's the whole "just vote me then" it's dry af
Sidemen Among Us is usually such a joy for me but I realized that a big part of it is the way that Vik usually plays. I missed him in this video :(
Poor Danny Arrons. He is ACTUALLY having a WONDERFUL session (and has figured out how to play Among Us), but everyone is dog piling on him.
Does anyone know what background music is?
I hear Danny and Just want to end it all, omg so annoying
Those glasses vikk wears make him turn into a demon
WE NEED MORE AMONGUS, KEEP THEM COMING
4:54 actually Behz has a point 😂😂😂
Ellum and simon being friends make so much sense. Both annoying frfr
Everyone in these videos are goated apart from that ellum guy
bro the whole lobby literally nearly 3rd impostered on Ethan and ethan usually 3rd imposters
Surely vik should get a yellow for his absence 😂
pew pew vikkstar123
Danny with 2 masterclasses is crazy
danny is genuinly so entertaining to watch
26:49   Lazar: “I know you’ve taken some knocks to the head in your boxing career, but it’s unnecessary to be that stoopid” gets me 😂😂😂😊
13:32 Danny 😂😂😂
Deji is so slow but spmehow smart he reminds me of his  brother jj wen hes playing  😂😂
W
“so after I sniffed simons corpse..” 😂😂😂
We didn’t see viks cam/pov at all right?? Unless I’m bugging I thinks we might have ourselves a lil conspiracy 😮 Notice how we’ve never had viks face on the thumbnail before right (unless I’m missing any) I reckon they have someone else playing as vik 🧐 (they have out his face on the thumbnail to make us unconsciously think he’s involved in the vid ). but hold on what about his voice that - we barely actually hear? They used Ai …🤔 we’ve all come across Ai voice changers on tiktok…I reckon that’s that
Deji laughs goofy
Danny Aarons masterclass this video
Lazarbeam and Danny Character Development! we love to see it
Get angry ginge in one
I think VIK wasn't there for the recording. They've just used some sound bites to make it look like he was there
yeah vikk doesn’t care about anything, fans especially
Miss simons old hair
Degi filling in for Harry hahah
I can’t wait for them to vote out Deji for being KSI’s brother
yes
Can we please have Deji in every future Sidemen Among Us? ❤❤
Vikk deserves a yellow for this performance
Lazar beam " I am cunt, I am"😂
All these Vik comments but no one’s talking about Josh not even trying as imposter like why not just vent into cams?
Dannyarons cures my depression 😂😂😂😂😂
I don’t understand why every so mean to Danny. Bless him
Have 3 imps but they dont know who other imps are and can kill eachoder
Bro does among us hate vikk why does the first bounty of bounty hunter is always vikk
You Guys need to stop inviting danny pls man
HOW are YOU SO SCHEWPID😂
Simons hair grew back just for this video
Sidemen men among will always be gold
vik needs a yellow lol
All of them investing in huge setups.  Deji: kitchen will do.
How to use these mods? Anyone?
I LOVE WATCHING SDM ACTING GAY AF
Jankiest among us, but still so good ❤❤🎉
Never thought I’d say this but denk is genuinely funnier than jj
deji a sado
32:10 jj????
Vik was afk the whole vid and was still more useful than Deji 😂
Nah these lobbies are elite😂😂😂
Sidemen among us videos are lowkey the funniest sidemen content. These lobbies really are just pure fuckery😂 Deji is also such a great addition.
Why did vikk randomly re-enter with no explanation 💀💀💀 31:20
22:52 19 years😂
Ngl, Danny is so annoying, he makes even a fun game an irritating game. Bro is a 5 year old in a 30 years old body
https://youtube.com/shorts/dhZQDJ9Zi8s?si=-mEKiTiJCfr0ufLQ😊
https://youtube.com/shorts/dhZQDJ9Zi8s?si=-mEKiTiJCfr0ufLQ😢
Poor Ethan just wanted to get rid of his hiccups :(
the edit over danny and ethan being hard cleared is amazing
They should start doing this thing where the impostors can talk to eachother
I don’t like vikk most the time but I hate Tobi almost all the time
Ellum: *admits its him*  Danny: sees Josh kill on cams  Also Danny: acts like it was a high IQ play to ignore the report to find out who the second imp was
I think the fact that Viks footage corrupted, we don’t even hear him when he is playing so we legit can only hear him if he participates in meetings, which he was dead in majority 😂
PLEASE CAN YOU GUYS ALL PLAY INFINITE GOLF!!!!!!! WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT VIDEO
Vik come on man, what is this even?
daniel haron is a jewish American name for sure (just saying)
They need to make at least 1 of these a week
Vik's  choice to cook Josh in the 16 seconds he actually played is goated
It's boring with Ellum and Viz theyre too good , they should get in some stupid ppl
How- does Deji have sixth sense or sumn?
Vik needs to put more effort into these videos. The energy he puts into the Pack videos compared to these is crazy
I am 3 rounds in and every bounty is vik #stopvikabuse
damn how the first three bounty hunters all got vik😭😭
19:02 was priceless😂
Vik was clearly the viktim in this vid
Finally!
AI Vik 👀
Can we genuinely have a sidemen among us not a 3 men with guests
vu
remove hickups: hold breath then when you need to take a breath, drink a some water
Danny Aarons has gotten so good, gonna need another compilation of his best moments
4:48 lmao karen ethan is here "Well aktually" with the finger lol  And i dont mean iit in a mean way
Danny is smart af y’all don’t know
VIZ ADDS NOTHING GET HIM OUT
Danny aarons in that second game is a new level of stupidity
this is a danny's master class video nj
This line up is one of the best, always cracks me up
YES more among us
😮
Danny has a pretty high win rate in these Sidemen AU videos which is crazy since people call him stupid.
I love Deji’s laugh
Surely that's a yellow for Vik🤔😅
Ethan is just so paranoid of Vikk now lmao ... He has been burnt wayy too many times.
When Deji literally sees anyone on cameras: THAT’S HIM!!
Tobi’s Naruto, Sasuke, Levi and Saitama poster is fucking heat🔥
Get ginge on among us
As always what was the point of Vik being in this video. Absolute waste of space
Deadest sidemen among us
13:32 is my favourite part 😂😂 hilarious editing 😂
vik yellow?
https://youtu.be/kwy2DYTssv4?si=8afeQKT7BNYvlpfF
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Vik gets a red card imo
If Danny actually shut up he could’ve voted him out the first time
danny being dumb and then calling the rest of the lobby idiots is hilarious
BANGER
Ethan's hiccup moment was so well done
When will harry returne to among us
8:20 - never seen a more british fucking rage
How ironic deji was the most interesting part of the video how the turn tables turn
😂🎉😂🎉😂
The team needs some new energy.
Cams is a major flaw in among us. Just reduce the number of times someone can use cams in a game.
I like how they never disable comms when someone's on cams
Ethan’s definitely been watching Only fools and horses
YOU DONUT😂
We need Stephen tries in this
VIK IS SO COLD
They are skipping after knowing who it is? Damn... stopped the video asap, whats the fun in that lol
Deji being a cam merchant ruins the videos
Tobi is so fake humble. "Vote me out, I don't care", then why play, ffs!
these among us videos always bang!!!!!!!
Tobi being killed by Josh when he's the bounty hunter & he goes... '19yrs i've known this guy and this is hw he treats me'😆😆
Vik is gettin hella annoying
How are they so bad, they never tell the full story and then get confused when they are voted out
32:50 says the man who's done card swipe.
Ellum calling degi a nicke 😂😂
game❤‍🔥
the name DANNY AARONS MAKES ME TILTED NOW
Black colour Kolhapur❤❤❤❤❤❤😂
That is a MASTERCLASSSS FROM ANNY DAAORNS
we need a beta squad and sidemen among us vid
They need to play Texas chainsaw massacre would be a show
Vik should definitely get a red card for that one
Vik😂❤
Ellum needs to be in a sdmn Sunday
Why was vikky boi always being hunted lol
Danny arons is becoming irritating to watch in sidemen videos repeatedly.
W
We need chaos mode
Ellum doesn't really add much, he just shouts ffs
Lots of cameras offline this vid. Kinda like the lots brains when playing this game hahahaha.
Josh is so boring he even said oh im gonna crazy with bounty hunter then didnt even kill no one the whole game ffs
https://youtu.be/lakG82Ls0co?si=f_1snZbNqgXsleEQ sidemen bad
Please drop more of this 😂
Nocco
Josh could have sabotage comms it would have switched off the cams
Deji is great in these among us videos
L Vikstarr
Just disable comms bro, is not that hard
vikk is such a goat in this vid
Body gets reported  KSI: It' Tobi  Deji: It's Tobi
deji saw viz kill on cams but my guy stuck there
Oooooooooooo😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
anyone know where tobi's kanye posters from, shits fire
I mean, Vik if you don't want to play Then don't be in these videos You're killing the vibes
Ellum could have killed tobi, the cooldown was 3 seconds
For Ethan to stop your hiccups: swallow  three times with out breathing warst doing that have your ears covered very well
Danny is actually the idiot. He ignored the body just to follow josh. Then gets mad when they question him lol.
Worst among us video you’ve ever posted. If you guys don’t wanna play then don’t play, it’s just a waste of time having people sit on cams all game or not talk because they can’t be bothered to play properly
vik was so boring this vid
I did not feel this episode. Seemed a bit forced for me personally. VIK should defo get a yellow lol.
Just sabotage comms as an impostor and they can't see cameras ...
They can sabotage comms tho
Thanks for playing Vik 👌🏽
These vids are unreal, Danny, Deji and Lazar, unreal! need to be more often
Deji plays so boring
These are the only people who can pull of among us videos
Police police police police police police police police
If simon or behz did what Vik did in this vid they would have gotten so much hate
10:25 It would've been hilarious if Lazar suspected Danny because he walked from the body on cams. Then Danny didn't work in front of the body when Deji came on cams so then Deji suspects Lazar being on cams and seeing a dead body but not reporting it. So two people are accused of killing but it's actually Josh.
Bro, LAZAR's gonna kill more keyboard Than imposters....😂
Lazer having to wake up at 3:00 just to be the side character...
give vid a yellow lmaooo
VIK straight red, no effort
What we need is Angryginge13 on sidemen among us that would be class
Harry missing a moresidemen shoot? Is he ok?
Sidemen Among Us is always pure chaos and I am here for it!! Love these videos <3
Vik is gonna leave the sidemen soon...
It’d be great to see regular among us with 1 shapeshifter again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFOtIJ-nxps&t=2s
Vik: says nothing and votes himself. Also Vik: I didn't tell you guys to vote me Lmao
We need to see a sidemen VR imposter 👌
Why does no use comms to get rid of cams
Can you send me a keyboard instead of destroying it please ?
Why so many problems in vid bro tell them prior to fix their cameras and stuff
Nah shoulda just brought randy in or someone else rather than Likkstar
DEJI always seems to no he pycic
Why is Tobi so mad in this vid lol
How is Ellum so aggressively stupid?
I say get Jacksepticeye and Markiplier in!
Darren’s face pisses me off
"19 years I've known that guy and he treats me like this" 😂
Vikk was an ass in this video.
Tobi should honestly stop complaining all the time and play the game without wanting to be voted out. If he thinks it is such a pain to play and make content then it's best that he doesn't feature in the video. And Vik chose to be low on energy this vid as well. I'm really not sure if his footage was actually corrupt
Sidemen among us.... Week made 👌
Aarons you brought that upon yourself by not reporting the body😂
I hate how bad Josh is, bro literally could've played the long game because Deji isn't dong tasks
Can't believe Deji took so long to report and then only he accused Viz and everyone else jumped on it ffs he didn't deserve that
2:08 deji lowkey genius move 😂😂
Lol what was with Vikk this video
Dejis laugh is just as bad as JJs
Imagine Danny & Lazar meeting in the town of Chillingbourne.
Idk tobi talks more when he doesn’t have his camera on lol
"I didn't need to play I knew you were gonna throw" is crazy 🤣
Vik was not part of this video at all
Am i the only one who doesn’t like dany like he’s alright but he’s annoying as fuck ngl
Lazarbeams stained background got my high ass wiping my screen thinking it’s dirt, What a let down.
ayo chip giving deji the monkey lips is a violation LMAO
Actually better without vik
Deji's masterclass🔥🔥
26:52 says a guy who dropped out of school at 15
"i played that so well" no sir, no you did not, danny is actually so bad lmao
14:25  16:00  24:45
Vik Vik Vik
VIK half asses a lot of stuff tbh if it’s not DJ or Pack related
22:52 19 years I’ve known that guy and this is how he treats me 😭
is anyone gonna talk about how vik didnt exist the whole video apart from like 30 seconds 😭?
See Simon wedding ring, how times have changed 🥲🥲🥲🥲
Series never gets old
Is vikstar going through the era of depression because I forgot he was in the lobby 😂
Not Danny saying "obserb" and "obserbing"😂
Is it just me or is the Danny guy  Unbearably annoying af
Vikk was a great addition to this video  I'm also slightly disappointed no one really used the bounty hunter power tbh. I was waiting for like a blatant kill to then immediately kill the person who saw or something like that like kill vikk then simon at the end or ethan on cam then go in murder deji
I miss Vik
Doug the bounty hunter😂
Love you vik, cracking work today mate proper entertaining
Deji, is so good for sidemen but when deji and ksi are doing videos together they focus too much on each other.
AMP x SIDEMEN Among Us????
What’s the point of vik
Don't watch this it's so stupid
What is the D and L next to their names never realised
why’s tobis camera always off
30 minutes in and just found out viks here, rather him not there anyway tbf
Imposter series is goated
I genuinely thought Deji was smarter than JJ💀
can they do communications to stop the cams for a bit?
where’s harry?😔
Disable coms to get rid of cams 😂😂
nbf, I like Tobi, but if he doesn't ever want to play I'd rather he just didn't in the first place and let someone else play who might want to. It's so boring to watch when he just gives himself up as imposter or doesn't argue his case to not get voted off, he just gives in, votes himself and screws over the other imposter. again, I like him, but if you don't want to play then don't.
Ngl I like tobi without his camera with that nice photo idk but it just seems funnier
Deji: 7/7?😂 But Simon says 7/7!🤣
vik annoyed me soo much didnt play and just abbusing josh
Disappointed in Ethan this episode. Really didn’t bring the energy we deserved🫤
I just want to see them win by completing their tasks 1 time 😂
YAY DEJIS BACK IN THESW
I like these vids but it’s annoying when they (Josh and Vik) just don’t play properly and give up strait away, what’s the point???
Does Harry just refuse to be apart of among us now 😂😂
Deji's laugh makes me so happy
Crazy how deji and jj play the exact same😂😂
Why is vik even in it if he isn't talking or on cam loo
Among us with Jidion !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! would be lit
If I was in a room with Ellum I’d fart
Deji is soo stoopid😂😂😂
danny got smart bro
Vik was on fire this game
Danny with 3 from 3 wins to start
We needed, vik,Randy, Harry, & jj
Please make an Among Use episode where you can only discuss for 15 seconds, and then you just gotta vote someone!
More videos like this please. Vik hardly in it 😅
Danny the goat
Josh is stinky at Among Us
We need w2s trying to explane what he saw or why hes not imposter in sideman amung us
i love danny so much hes so funny for no reason
we need soosy choongus randy back idk why but i love it when he’s in among us vids w y’all
Tobi is only defensive when his imposter I’ve never seen him this mad haha
The sidemen that weren’t in this video KSI and VIK and Harry
8:20 prime acting from Ellum here, idk how many times i replayed it, thats so funny
Thats a yellow card for vikk right...
Where was w2s?
i fcking died with ethan on th side with his timer 18:00
Zerkaa is a pick me
Aint nobody gonna talk about danny aarons having a 100 percent winrate and survival rate?
Love when laser destroys his keyboard
This is a shorter episode 😭. Sidemen among us is the best sidemen content ever. Please do more frequently
Why the hell is Lanan's mic's volume so low, please fix it for the next video
Usually love sidemen among us, bit disappointing
BTW I think vik was controlled by a another person
Danny is the biggest mouth breather. Just shut up and let Lazer help you out instead of listening to the sound of your own damn voice
I always look forward to sideman among us
When any of the member says "yeah vote me out"it kinda seems that they are  not interested in playing.
Among Us is the greatest youtube content SIdemen started doing. It makes your day 10000x better as well when Danny and Lannon are in it! 😀
Josh: oh no oh no oh no 😐
I love the sidemen!
I love sidemen among us!!!!!
Imagine a lobby with jj deji danny lazar and angry ginge thats absolute kaos
if Danny says masterclass one more time ban him from all sidemen shoots...
The fact danny thinks hes right is so funny
Anyone notice how Danny pronounces ‘observe’ as obserb😂😂😂
imposters just disable comms to stop cams lmao
Pic of Dejuan makes him look like avatar with his forehead😂
stop playing among us bro
the yawning😆😆
vikk is becoming more of an L
I love the sidemen among us videos, but it’s so hard to enjoy them when some of the players show 0 interest in the game. Vik has seemed so uninterested in the game for the past few among us videos, and it’s been the same in the past with Ethan and tobi
Not the best among us video tbh
12:11
Danny turning red🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bring back Proximity Chat
Thankfuck vik left
Danny, let someone else speak for the love of god
Columbian women pov
Ethan hold his breath for about a minute then straight away got killed and still got his hiccup😂
Yoo Josh drinking Nocco 🙌🇸🇪
Seems like Vikk had a long day, he was not involved in the video at all
🔥
Whe someone camps cams like that he was in the room alone for along time shut his door go into lights vent up kill him & vent back out
How can you blame vik for you losing 😂
Idk if it only me but I would like sidemen to play goose goose duck
About time lads im late to the party but amazed to see its AMONG US!!... LOOK at the VIEWS!!... we want more Among US lool
Ellum looks like a drag queen.
Tbh at this point this lobby is wayyyyy to bumb not even funny to watch anymore like how its it even possible to lack so many brain cells 💀 im just amazed
Love you Ethan ❤️❤️
Thank you sidemen for bringing old cs 1.6 voice comms "target aquired" back it brings me to old memories to counter strike
Danny just shut up for one sec “Yh Yh that’s what I’m”
Where’s JJ..?😢😢
Danny is so bad at mario cart
Vik being in the thumbnail despite only talk in 3 sentences the whole vid
I absolutley LOVE these videos!!! Always excited when I see a new one ❤❤❤
The way deji said good games at the end, you can tell he really Enjoys playing with them all
This was hilarious 😂😂😂
Camera man never die 😂😂😂
Danny's blood pressure was through the roof for a minute there!
Just finished dinner and saw a new episode of Sidemen Among Us , it’s a good lofe
I swear Vik only said 2 things this whole vid
ellum just doesnt belong to the group at all he doesnt fit in with the energy at all
Damn vik 😂 don’t wanna be in a video 😂.  Poor Ethan
get angry ginge on here
Need Sidemen among us once in 2 weeks atleast
whys deji so black
ngl deji kinda ruined the last round for me
Virgin Bezhinga cries when Vikkstar tries and plays normally. Virgin Behzhing cries more when Vikkstar doesnt give a fk anymore. Virgin Behzinga is a nonce and he can also cry about it.
Might the worst among us they’ve done
Absolutely masterclass
Outstanding performance by Vikk, greatest gamer in this video
Just turn comms off to get rid of the cams problem...
16:49 25:00 32:00
22:54 just tobi being tobi is the wholesome thing🤣🤣
At just 0:27, but tobis photo takes me back to the good music and (good) (whole) entertainment era.
Deji is horrible at this game like damn
Ethan is the worst
Why did Vik not interact at all? I get his cam wasn't working, but his mic was working just fine. I usually love what he contributes to these videos, but it seemed like he was just being lazy
No face no trace Tobi🔥🔥🔥
How did Simon's hair grow so fast?
Danny just raging at no one believing him in among us when he does stupid shit like that and he wonders why the game doesn't end and calls others stupid 🤔 interesting but nah fair enough Danny aarons cooked but I know big nose tobi ain't talking about punching ppl right XD
Danny caling deji a cam virgin but sits on cam himself. Idiot
Vik needs to pick up his energy in these recent vids shame
I’m really liking when Deji plays with them. He’s got good energy
Vik was like ‘nah’ and dipped 😂
Why did vikk not speak
vik should get a yellow card
https://youtu.be/hld7f8PaEPQ?si=lPzsfrwXEAqQG9_g
Diji and among us 😂😂😂
Josh gotten so bad
This is literally a binge show for me I love sidemen among us
Josh got roasted
Vikkstar deserves a yellow card for this one tbh
worst edit ever... very hard to follow
Deji inside his kitchen
This video was shoot when Simon had good hair😂😂
31:45
Vik is usually so boring, so him not speaking didn't make a difference.
Is sidemen among us coming to an end😢
How old is this clip coz simon still have long hair😂
vik coulndt ruin the video now...
Me when I cant afford a new phone and Lazarbeam just destroying keyborads😭😭😭😭
I dont care how dumb the sidemen get when playing among us, these are the most entertaining videos on more sidemen
Lovin lazars 260 ping
Josh forgetting how to sabotage is brilliant
When Ethan was just standing in the hallway, Josh should have vented into cams smh
ellum saying they need to go outside makes no sence level like 70
Vik would've carried they all scared
Pagans voting vik
Anyone need friends like this? I do😅
Yayyyyyyy among us!!!!
Danny is actually a decent imposter
Claaaaasic throwbi
tobi's bottom  camera angel you can see his 🧠 through his 👃
Deji saying I NEW IT I NEW IT POV: has no reason to say it
we love lazar destroying keyboard all the time
Deji is lowkey a good supersub for jj in these vids
21:31
They could make it be 3 tasks and the tasks still wouldn't get finished because of Deji and Harry and JJ etc
Viks a nonce for not playing properly 😂
minute 28:18 ethan’s tooth💩
Best vids on youtube
I missed Sidemen Among us❤
Ellum literally said that he was the bounty hunter when he got voted out, only for everyone to think that there are still 2 killers in the next round lmao.
Disappointed with this video
Why does Danny sound like a drip
Vik is still my favourite by far
Why is vik even here then if it was ethan and Simon they would be getting hate
21:00
16:00 is absolute brilliant editing
I wanted more sidemen not the side men
vik is super boring in sidemen videos he never puts effort in
It's just a little jarring with all the footage missing between facecams and gameplay. Love the vids tho. Among us bangs every time
see if you can get angryginge for an among us at some point
30:05 he's just standing there... MENACINGLY
Vikkstar was the 1st Bounty in most of the rounds John wick more like John vikk
Vik not playing made the video 10x better
😂this crazy
MORE AMONG US PLEASE PLEASE I LOVE THIS SO MUCH PLEASE
More among us!❤ it's the best❤😂❤
I feel like they forget the fact that comms turns of the cameras😅
Danny Gotta stop killing lazar first round
Vik was very talkative this vid
Get ginge on among us!
How do you not know after so many games that the bar is for everyone and not only yourself...
that ellum annoys me, just something about him that grinds my gears
4:22 lol that sync
Deji is the best replacement for jj
I dunno man, if im playin im jus gna sit back, npt worth talking so much 😂
Yo what's up with vikk is he ok
Best group ❤
😊😊
Fellas, you have to do AT LEAST 2 among us vids a week at very min. Gets you so many views and can re watch it that many times well done lads keep grinding
If they wanna camp on cameras just sabotage communication
29:50 If Simon didn't show up at cams, seeing Josh kill Behz then Deji straight after with the 3 second cooldown would have been sick
Ellum is so trash that it seriously feels like he isn't trying
Finally lads. Need more among us..
Deji is the only one who can genuinely replace JJ for these sidemen videos, no one is doing the stuff they do
Danny saying “get off cams and do your task” to deji while only himself done card swipe😂😂
Yay more sidemen among us
love how lazar gets killed by danny again and again
FINALLY
need an among us youtube channel fr
22:58 Tobi was in pain 😂
Poor form from Vik
deji is acc so annoying
Why didn’t vikk sub someone into his spot I fully understand, as should anyone, being burnt out of a game as they definitely record these videos in hours upon hours of sessions
Behz and deji is carrying these games!
Vikk just in the shadowrealm talking sometimes
Someone: *looks at deji Deji: youre the imposter. i have so much evidence and research to back my answer
All Josh had to do was comms sabotage 😂
those who are sidemen fans and not tiktok fans can like this
You need to get ginge in among us it will be jokes
Unpopular opinion: the cams kill the game.
The Olatunji laughs never fail to miss 😂
These among us episodes have shown me deji is such a baby sibling instant snitch 😂😂
It’s KSI’s brother again 😂
fun fact: sipping vinegar actually cures hiccups
finally another video .. on another note what settings do you lot use on among us
Nah but on a real note If Ethan did what Vik done in this video and not participate the amount of hate he would receive is crazy or am I tripping??
SIDEMEN AMONG US NEEDS TO BE A WEEKLY SERIES!!!
Deji is a great addition.
StopVik abuse
posh boy ellum going mad is funny
Bored
so what does the role do?
Bit shit when tobi and vikk always seem like they dont want to play, brings the energy down.
idk if they realize that coms disables the cams
9:47
12:05
NDL
5:37 5:39 5:40 5:41 5:42
Danny: ignores Josh literally murdering Simon on cams Also Danny: "I PLAYED THAT SO WELL"
I’m starting too think it’s not Ethan we have too worry about , I think vikk is going too be the first too leave the sidemen , doesn’t upload on his own channel , very rarely participates in most videos , constantly on his phone for more sidemen , he’s just disappointing , made a bit of money and now he doesn’t care about his fans 🤷🏼‍♂️, kind of a shame how money changes people 🙄
Vik and ksi just not being there made it a bit dry
Petition for hour long among us videos
Vik existing for about 2 minutes is crazy. The amount of chaos josh can cause Is immense.
Vikk always being the first target for the bounty hunter is so funny bc he barely participated 😭
What was going on with Vik todayy?
Danny Aaron’s gets imposter every game
Vik deserves a YELLOW CARD for this vid. He didnt speak until 30:55 into it other than to say im voting for myself and then he still just said im chillin. And then he said 30 secs before the video ends "it sounds like a skill issue"
anybody noticed that danny screams when hes crewmate but not when hes imposter
ima be real this is the only video i have understood danny screaming down his mic 😂
"The (Dej) Cams"
i looove the music in the background
josh has been so entertaining imo lately.
poor from vik, shows a lot about his character
Bring back proximity chat😫
Man I miss harry and KSI
"I'm playing with love" - that was actually adorable
“19 years I known this guy man and this is how he treats me” 😂😂😂
ethan makes these videos so hard to watch with his constant sarcasm and complaining💀
Behz, Tobi and Deji were hilarious in this one
Vikk roasting Josh at the end is GOLD🤣
Bro is Deji playing in is kitchen 😂
The 2nd game is proof that danny is the dumbest person on this planet. They get the killer to confess round 1 and the next round he still think its 2 people. 😂😂😂 i swear 😂
deji ruins these videos
Why was vik always the first one the bounty hunters had to kill 😂
Why do I like Tobis new Facecam more
Weji
Here for the search party for vik
Dojo clean your kitchen
Bring angryginge in
YELLOW CARD FOR VIK. For not wanting to be "BOTHERED" with being in the video. 😂
Sidemen among us videos always makes my day better
In the fiest game behz is kinda right that vik does like to do get out when hes with a dumbass. And 2 of those people are deji and danny for sure.
I get so hyped when there’s a sidemen amongus video🗿😩
Nice to see Ethan having fun on this one
Unpopular opinion: deji brings nothing to sidemen among us.
Love how Vik didn’t play or waste any braincells.
They should fr post videos of among us gameplay more often since those are the only videos that are getting over 4M views each video.
Danny raging “ITS JOOOOSH” was so funny the last few minutes of that round had me creasing
boooooring because of deji
Sidemen playing goose goose duck?👀👀
can you guys stop having the stupid Danny on your videos? He's not even funny
Even JJ was more in the Video then Vik
please the sideman libary part 3..
I hate when Tobi speaks
Why does Deji play in the kitchen now?😂😂
Get viz off these vids, he ruins the funny part of the game and is a nerd, has no humor no emotion neek
Why no one attacks Vik now for literally not being in the video? When someone other do that you all cry...
legit I used to love these videos, but it seems like people cba for them anymore - vik just voting himself out would of been funny a year ago but in every video he "can't be arsed" getting fucking boring
Danny really played well these games
Finally
18:42
Steady on the Redbull Josh
You should start sabotaging Comms from now to stop the cam merchants 😂
14:27: dej : its called META GAMING
Lazar is always the first to die 😂😂😂😂🤣
Josh's oh no has to be memed
whats with these fucking noobs, always killing infront of cams
I miss Harry and JJ
Vik quickly became my least favourite sidemen, why show up if your not going to play....
Why are they all whining about Deji doing tasks when they don't do tasks in 99% of these fucking videos?
Make my day😂😂
Behz calling Simon his friend instead of his colleague is so wholesome
Who would have thought, ksi is the smarter brother
Why is everyone always so mean to Deji?
Seriously, what are the Ds and the Ls?
The people liking the “like if you didn’t come from TikTok” bot comments are dumber than Danny Aarons and Deji combined 😂
After so long a funny among us video. Keep it up buddies
Oh boohoo, Ethan has a kid. He could have cancer, chronic pain, and be broke from medical leave.
Needs to be a rule where you can' use cams until you finish your tasks
Ethan have a teaspoon of vinegar to get rid of hiccups it actually works 👍🏻
Can we just talk about how fucking racist the game is
If Josh killed vik first he would have had 2 second cooldown and be able to kill simon
Ethan's got a lot of stress in his life?
Vikk earning all this money living the life and he can’t be bothered with a game of among us…MUG
Pre recorded fasho 😂😂. Stimpy still got faux cut lol
i need to get back on this game with friends, forgot how hilarious it was
Danny: Ethan's been going through a lot of stress recently  Me: Aw, he's being so wholesome Also Danny: So I'm looking to add to that
Imagine these games with people other than the Sidemen and friends. Literally all the games in the video are technically terrible. Danny actually did pretty well but oh my lord that was bad as a whole. Thank God the Sidemen made it entertaining. 😂😂
At nah viz ur dead it's not actually me       This killed me
y’all gotta turn down deji audio, he be a different type of yelling
To be fair we know among us vids are jokes but the video ethan didn’t wanna participate in was a proper organised video which had an impact
Thank the lord vik wasn't in this much and just got killed straight away
29:15 danny's mortgage💀
Love ethan brought up the vid where everyone harassed him for not wanting to do the video 😂 even I did
Deji is boring in these, had potential for some serious plays but he just sat on cams, yawn
Why is Danny in every one of these😑
Deji made this vid Mid.. Danny made it Goated
The greatest series on YouTube
Why did Vikk just not talk the whole video 😂
Danny absolutely terrorizing Ethan was hilarious
Danny had a moment. Im happy 14:16 😂😂
it was so boring by the end.. like get off the cams ffs
22:52 is fucking hilarious😂😂😂
When Danny said he had no sus then Simon has to claim he was sus of him just to make sure everyone knows he’s right, guys ego is through the roof such a know it all
Bruh this ellum is shit
I didn't even know Vik was in the video
Deji iq200
Among Us is pretty dead without Harry and KSI to be honest
Every time josh becomes an imposter he is ALL ALONE. POOR LAD😂😂 9:27
Sidemen first of all u have to kill person who always go on camera like harry,JJ,and Deji
If only people knew how to use comms
DISSTRACKS!!! BRING IT BBACK
😂
They used Vik as the thumbnail but he doesn't do shit in this video🤦‍♂️
who thinks that ellum is unfunny 😅(I love sidemen among us btw!!)
Finally!!
Vik just say you don't want to be in a vid next time
Hello Sidemen, you are probably not gonna read this but if you do, please acknowledge what I'm gonna say. A few years I ago I used to watch this youtuber who played among us and after a while he decided to make a custom map related to his channel. It was still the skeld, but the rooms and characters and tasks where slightly different. It felt much more close to their fans and audience so if you could do it I, and probably many fans would love that. When I saw Ethan's face on the admin task I remembered this.  Please give likes so the Sidemem get to see this
Prick star should get a yellow for that
Vik contributed as much as JJ in this video (literally non existent)
Tobi is such a cuck
its like lazer just has extra keyboards just for these vids 😂
can we just boot toby from these?
In defence of Ethan, he kind of got Danny as a guess that first round lol altho he did third imposter with regards to Tobi and Deji
Anyone else felt this among us vid didn’t hit the same?
33:27 only time vikk talk still manage to roast josh😂😂
danny is the most annoying person ever even thinking he's the smart one at the second game
It's fucking fun to see danny get imposter but at this point it's just him mainly getting imposter in almost all the videos and it's getting kinda boring
Danny Aarons really is him
Three people with no camera fotage
Is vikk okay?
If you haven't heard a single word from vikk raise your hand 🙋
Deji actually being right a couple times 😂😂
Vik recently not giving a fuck about MoreSidemen videos kinda annoys me
Bro why is Deji in a kitchen?
Deji is so dumb on cams
Bro why does Lazar's studio look like dodgy dungeon???
The camera from below´s like gazing at the kilimandscharo #nosejoke
Please make more sidemen among us in the skeld
This is the most sidemen vid ever absolute shambles 💀
Among us is so dead but I still love watching these among us vids
Deji: "But Simon said he's 7/7!" Simon & Ethan: "You're an idiot, you're an idiot..." 😂💀
i swear deji is the most stupid and smart crewmate by calling random people out
dannys had a blinder!
yo this no vikkstar among us is quite nice to watch, might need to continue that
Josh kills tobi Tobi:19 years I've known that guy😭
21:35
I’m with Vik, doesn’t want a bar of this episode lol
Any sidemen Amogus video shorter than at least 40 minutes is a crime
didn‘t even realize vik was afk until simon mentioned it.
Among us without KSI and Harry stupidity is boring ngl
Plz make these videos longer
Remember when Josh was a good imposter. Now he doesn’t know the red light means the camera is on
from lazar "i am c*nt"  I'm so proud to be Australian in this moment 🤣
I thought Viz was a complete virgin. He’s showed in this video that he is not. First voting Danny when Danny and Lazar said Josh killed on cams. Then standing on cams with lazar whilst deji is watching and killing him. Horror show from him
They need to ban cams for a video, and see what happens.
Ahh, now it makes sense why Deji's IQ is similar to Chimpanzees'
wtf is wrong with vikk this video
You know we never show enough love to Ethan man he’s one of the funniest sidemen top 3 easy wish he was my dad
Even though we didnt get a Vik masterclass today. it felt good to see the other players of the lobby shine.
What is knox cola?
Lit ep
Deji strategy summarised :  Yell something ,blame everyone for the smallest thing and just make the video better
I think its too late.
Deji filling up for KSI nonsense 🙄 like it
Danny's masstercllaasss
Vikk npc moments
Deji get off the f*cking cams😩😩😂😂
I love how Vik is in the thumbnail and only 16 seconds in the video, and he decided to use that little amount of time to cook josh 😂😂😂
Yessss finallly I wait for weeks for this 😫
Ellum so cute 😭
bro was vikk playin on his phone or something wtf?? haha still decided to cook josh at the end tho
Jj and deji are the same person
Can you have a rule that you can't go on cams
W vid
I’m a simple man, I see Sidemen among us, I click
Vikk should of gotten a yellow card for this 😅
Tbh, Danny IQ is going up these days. From 68 to 69
If Ethan or Simon did what vik did there would be a war in these comments
28:08 that edit is a violation 😂
Vik phoning it in… poor effort
So…..Was Vik in the video?
You know what would be a cool mod? If every crewmate could see everyone’s heartbeats. So they could use that to catch people who lie etc
How tf ksi so rich and deji streaming in the kitchen
Deji is the most lowest iq person i saw in my life😂
you should upload more among us videos
25:10 get this man an Oscar
Danny's best episode
Anyone else see tobi absolutely soak his keyboard in saliva
fkn Vikkstar, lost respect even more you lazy fk
What happened to vik??
Yellow card for vik surely ?
Its crazy that when Josh is imposter always his teammate gets vote out at the first round 🤣🤣
We have got Rug in  the chat
someone gotta check on vid
Pussio
Yay
I want filly on this ong
Yess Amogus
The editor funny as hell. Vik rarely in the thumbnails, but they added him to the one video where he didn’t participate 😭
Delirious showing why he's the lets play goat
Finally
Ayo Ethan why u bullying vik😂
Sidemen solely keeping among us alive! Hats off!
😂😂
At this point deji is more of a Sideman than Vikkkstar.  If Vikkkstar doesn't like it he can just leave the group
Never knew someone could be worse than JJ at sitting on cams
Viks comeback to josh at the end 💀
Video idea - Sidemen v camera crew (mine craft)
How come simon never gets imposter
Kinda sadge the bounty isn't random, it's reverse alphabetical order it seems?
Josh is genuinely the shittest imposter of all time
Lazer just came prepared😂
Funny how every time Josh is the imposter, his imposter teammate gets voted out
I wish there was a button to mute the little girls that can't have a conversation without screaming like a toddler....Danny Screamimg Aarons
I like how they blame vik when they all vote him 😭and everyone else was like wtf then bez 3rd imposter. Elite vid already
tobis facecam here is better than JMEs actual facecam lol
Sidemen should replace Josh with Lazar!!🤷🏻‍♂️
We invisible imposter with proximity chat
Just for context to whoever needs it, the keyboards LazarBeam breaks are 7.50 Australian Dollars each, which means 4 pounds or 5 USD
Surprised the video didn't end after the first round 😯😯😯
As sidemen fans it’s time to give mr 123 the same energy you lot gave behz😂
There should be a rule in these videos that no one can sit on cams. It makes shit content. LMAO
Bro where is everyone in this vid like theres not as manu as usual
This vid is a Danny masterclass
Its nice of vik to feature in the video 😅
Its getting boring now killing lazar first round . Poor choices not gonna lie
Vik a letdown today, let alone the shit dj sets
i really like lazer beam and what he brings to sidemen videos, especially among us videos but ngl breaking brand new keyboards as coping is a destructive influence for the younger viewers here and just too excessive; wasting all those materials for such shallow motives only leaves our world with even much waste. Also, as someone who lives in a third-world country and constantly sees poverty and children struggling to have access to education and technology—it just makes me feel aggravated and disappointed.   p.s. feel free to correct me if he already addressed someone and the keyboard breaking
Looks like vik has had a fight with Elli😂
I love lazerbeams his reaction every time
Theses videos are so good
POG innit bruv fam
Sidemen among us content!!! More more more brrrrrrrrr
Ellum’s never been the same since Randolph destroyed him
Vik was so good the entire video omg but Ethan has to watch out being third impostor every game.
ellum's not funny, adds nothing. get him out
been waiting for an among us video for so long
This is alll I wanted!!!
Yesssss
Does Ellum have make up on? Lol
Just get Ellum out of these videos, he’s annoying and doesn’t play the game properly
sidemen among us is better than main channel sidemen videos most of the time 😂
best moresidemen series ever, hope it never ends
Viz is lowkey kind of a dummy 😭 he’s rlly close minded which makes him not so good at this game
The duoble vote on Josh and Danny has me gas laughing for 5min🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣I tell you... That shit what so unexpected
finally
Wow, Danny was chill with josh and josh threw him under the bus.
Deji is making these vids so much funnier😂
I LOVE!!! How they are still saying "Fuck you" to those fans who bitched so much over that sidemen vid lol
Josh a sore loser
vikkstar wasnt himself in this video, is he okay?
claim your here within a day ticket 👇
How they finna blame Vik when they all decided to vote him for no reason 😢
Yellow for vikk 😢
Lannan is the best person in this lobby, in brain size and because he is funny asf
Make more !!!!
"Alright IM gonna bring out another keyboard" 😂🤣Lannon too rich
Tobi everytime he’s impostor “vote for me vote for me, you always do”
vikk sort ya self ooot
Like farming is getting crazy
More deji among us
It’s so annoying that they add new roles and don’t know how they work. Like not one person in this vid capitalised on the 3 second cool down
It's all well and good if Vik doesn't wanna be in these videos, but can we not just have someone else in his place? Feels like a wasted spot for someone who would actually participate
If cams is a problem, doesn't sabotaging coms solve that? Really did seem like a skill issue but yeah, someone being on cams the whole time is still annoying
Loving deji.. adds a lot more jokes
sidemen among us always an banger !
The best gaming content in youtube history, but need w2s to be more legendary
Sidemen Among us: No Camera video
Danny aarons masterclass btw
dude they literally edited vikk into this video
Why does Vik even show up anymore?
Ethan ☕
The Best Sidemen Series IMO
As funny as it is, yo vik straight up wasn’t part of the video
This is the first among us where I was not entertained😢 and that breaks my heart
Vikk should get a yellow lmao
Poor Vikk almost always had top bounty lol. It didn't seem random
We all know that bog is the real cam merchant😂
Vik just couldn’t be bothered I guess
Deji’s in more sidemen videos then jj nowadays
people will remember this video as big-brain danny
Been waiting so loooonnnggg
ban cams I beg
This video should called camera edition
AnnyDarons: “To be completely honest with you” Tobi: “Vote me I’m done with this”
Deji just sitting on cams while the bodies just laid behind him😂
Nice of Deji to fill in with Harry's gameplay and JJ's IQ.
nothing to do? maybe turn off lights and kill u donut
Wanna see them call vik out more for not being involved NGL felt like he's not in the video at all
its so annoying how as soon as tobi gets called out he gives up and tells everyone to vote him
Danny is so annoying, top of that he is stupid
32:49 "Do your tasks deji you've done zero!" - Danny, who's only done admin card swipe
Tell lazar i need a keyboard
The sidemen among us never fails to make my cheeks red
If Lazer going to meet Danny in person, Danny better run from the scene 😂😂
ngl the least enjoyable among us so far
Why doesn’t anyone sabotage comms?
vik needs to stop slacking off
I love sideman among us no matter who's there, It felt like a missed an extra spark with JJ and Harry both not being there in this episode.
putting vikk on the thumbnail and his footage is corrupted nor does he speak whats th point lol
We love you Danny!!
Today I realized watching sidemen among us when you’re high af is one of the best feelings
I just wanna see double kill by Bounty in 5 sec
you guys know if you sabotage comms, it takes out the cams
Josh is the DUMBEST player
9:20 Unique
Danny and Simon's banter is all I need 🤣🤣
Deji is so stupid 😂😂😂
If you guys wanna kill when someone is on cams, just turn off comms 😂
Lmaooo Deji finally got a pick right for once in his life loll
Deji = harry 2.0😂😂
penstar123 ghosting in big among us games 👻👻👻👻👻
Vikk has beeen getting fucked first round
Na man ….Ethan and Danny are dumb as rock  No hate to anyone but thats facts 😂
Lmfao 😂 0:54  gotta love Lannan
did vik loose the missus  or something ?
Yes another W among us vid 😂
Vik existing for about 2 minutes is crazy💀
12:07 got me creasing.
Someone sabotaged comms AFTER Josh killed on cams
Lmaooo Deji intuition was on point and of course get voted out after 😂😂
Josh was good in the first two videos of amongus but he is really shit at the game actually ever since in the videos in moresidemen channel.
3:05 Deji heard him? 😂
Please upload among us once a week i just love it ❤
We do love sidemen AMOTUDSSSSS
1:06 😂
1:02 I was waiting for it 😂
Lazar is my favorite sideman
I love these amount us vids bruh
Tip for editors, just tryna be helpful, whenever the cameras are offline like tobis and dejis you can just use their among us charactera to like show them talk or make us viewers feel the emotions theyre feeling like the og among us days when yters used among us characters to show us that they used to communicate. Its long its hella long but it keeps the viewer retention
“Let me just bring out another keyboard” Its a tradition at this point 😂
Bro I am twenty minutes into da game and I easily say damn Danny got hella good and dis his game.
Nah vim can you be serious bro
Vim was getting that sloppy toppy that’s why he wasn’t moving
What happened to vik?
The fact that Danny is wondering why they didn't believe him after he just ignored a body is under 70iq, the yelling afterwards wasn't content either so I hope he changes bcs he's ruining sidemen content for me
22:57 i can’t imagine having a friend for 19 years 🤯 that’s so cool
Danny calling them idiots after that nonsense is wild
Vik said some crazy stuff this video
finally
So poor from vikk i expected better from him he voted himself out like why how could he do this to us to me to the fans some of us side+ members like vikk just doesnt wanna play but wanna show up on recordings but doesnt wanna record his gameplay or even play but wanna be there for the bread like vikkstar123 are you tryna cheat the system to buy another house like tryna buy another aston martin like vikkstar123 my og content creator i missed you that game😔
Vik in the thumbnail but barely in the video haha
Who else doesn’t even play among us or barely played but watchs every sidemen among us video.
Sitting on cams deadass makes it boring lol
Deji is funny asf 🤣
Geez I can’t stand viz in these anymore
Nothing better than waking up and seeing a sidemen among us video
Without jj, harold, vik this game is boring 🥱
Yellow card for Vik
Sidemen among us fixes everything
😂😂 22:54  19 years ive known that guy and this is how he treats me lmaooo had me in stitches
Josh is literally the most boring imposter. He takes so long to kill people
I wanna take my time and say ...This was the shitiest custom role till now ....thanks
Harry would be proud of Deji
Less goooo
Ethan third poster again thats just amazing by now how does this mans keep doing this hahaha😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love how Vik made it to the thumbnail even though he was hardly in the video😂😂😂
Yo more more more more more more 😂😂😂😂 i want more
Lol every single time deji laughs he sounds like a little goblin 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I love him he’s great
Danny is actually probably the stupidest human being I’ve ever seen in my life
Love Tobis anime wall art
i miss pieface
red card for vic his forfeit should be harry hitting the squash ball at him
I thought they stopped doing these, I’m happy they are still releasing these!
Dejimon
DEJI FULFILLING THE BOTH ROLE OF HARRY N JJ
These guys know that the visual tasks like asteroids and med scan kind of clears the person
Vikk woke up and be like "yea fck this game"
15:28 why did viz help do the reactor meltdown, he had 5 more seconds to win 💀
Dear sidemen, I'm typing this to suggest playing town of Salem 2. That is all
Bro josh is so asss
Dejis volume 10x louder than everyone else
nah Daniel Aarons went crazy this episode
If I wanted to watch Danny I’d go to his channel, please use the others POV lmfao
wouldve been seick if vikk was imposter
One of the best more sidemen series
33:32 Woaahh Vikstar's cold moment😂
It’s crazy how bad Ethan’s sense of time in this game is lmao
I would literally pay over 50$ a month simply to watch an hour of among us from sidemen, every day
Deji sitting on cams reminded me of the days where JJ would just sit on cams. They are truly brothers.
great video
I love vik in this video 🤣
Just realized harry isnt there and cams missing him haha
poor tobi and josh, the worst imposters itw
what happen the the try hard vik??
4:25 love that synchronization 😂
i miss the days when vik got bullied...
Yes!!!
😁😆😂🤣😂 oh no..oh no…oh no…oh no…oh no..oh no.. oh no… oh no.. oh no.. 🤭😁😆😂🤣
aboutttt time we got another sdmn amoung us
The comedic and chaotic chemistry with the all their personalities on Among Us is always gold😂
26:47 That comment!😂😂
I really want to see the sidemen play among us with Disguised Toast
man..was vik even in the video?
This bitch 10:22 these videos are elite sidemen content 😂😂
We misse harry!
They should take a break from among us for a bit. Humour and effort is way down. Shadow of its old self. Vik being a prime example in this episode. Disappointing:(
The among is videos are the best
I swear deji is the stupidest person in this lobby
Bro sidemen among us is the best among us
Josh: *kills Toby* Toby: 19 years I've known that guy and this is how he treats me. 22:50😂😂😂
vik needs a yellow for that wtf was that shit. Embarrassing
Give vik a yellow
Sitting on camera’s kill the fun of the game
Tbh there was no clip of vikk or voice they did dirty
Afkstar
Ethan is having fun...nice!
Finally an Among Us video I can watch and not be disgusted by!
vik u dog
U lads need proxy chat
i kind of watch it for deji now tbh
thank god danny blew up on youtube cause he would be finished in the real world
Deji, Lazar and DannyAarons are certified members of sidemen among us. They are so entertaining!!
I swear Danny’s only actual knowledge of anything comes from Fifa, everything else he’s like a 4 year old trying to learn about it
Felt sorry for Tobi 19 years comment after he dies it be your own homies 😂
VikkstarNPC 😂
Deji makes up for KSI's absence. These brothers are so funny 😂😂😂
Sidemen Among Us 🎉🎉🎉
vik needs a yellow card for that one hahaha
https://www.youtube.com/live/pNmWxGIRzq4?si=eVnE-LXpBym56aJ7
Who’s better at cams, deji or harry?
Justice for simon and behz. Overhated sidemen members. Whenever the rest do shit its fine but if those two do shit "they ruined the vid" personally dont care about whos doing what but simon and behz dont deserve the hate they be getting.
This has to be the most boring side men among us I've watched
Danny won all games impressive 🎉
VIKKKK I mean WTH 🥸🥸🥸🥸
Ethan is so real for pointing out the double standard in the sidemen fans between Vik and others, if Behz or Simon did this fans would be on their ass nonstop
This was a really bad video
Deji is just wannabe ksi
Only Australian fans can like this comment
I want more among us
Simon hasn’t had imposter in foreverrr. I miss the manipulation & marination
Tobi is sooo christian that he won't drink, which is literally in the bible and perfectly allowed, but he blasphemes and curses, and behaves like the most secular person in the world
ellum in the poshest way “oh you! get out of here!” oof 😐
yalls videos always make me feel better...thank you
This video was quite mid tbh. also less deji would be better. He's not a KSI replacement
I hate Danny Aron’s or whatever his name is😂
Who else hasn’t played among us in like 2 years but still watches these vids 😂😂😂
I mean dafuq is this with vik this vid, would prefer someone active at least
This among us vid is poooo
Tobi never tried in these videos he should be removed from among us
Vik plays Among Us with the Pack now not the Sidemen.😂
I live for these
josh is 30 saying stop begging it holy shit these lot need to retire
Danny calling everyone idiots after walking away from a dead body on cams 💀 lil bro tried to make content and pissed himself off
absolutely love danny in these videos
Deji ruined it I like the amog us videos but sitting on cams doing nothing it takes the fun out of it
Josh's partner always dies in the first round
I like ethans theories they are stupid but funny
Was Vik even there? It could’ve just been a sound board this guy spoke like once
Is Vik okay? He seem not in the mood tbh, no cam face and not talking? That's not Vik 😂
Two braincells added to Danny is bit mad 😅 man going back to back wins 😅
Where is vikkkkkk........ Wtffffffff
sabotage comms??????? hello ???
y is ik everyones bounty
Viz is a loser when imposter. Canbthey replace viz with milk or pie
What is happening with Vikk is he okay
This is like they just removed Vik's footage and say it corrupted. Vik does not get the respect he deserves. 😢
Josh is so incredibly dead at this game
11:15 lol danny witnessed josh killed twice in the same round and it took him ages to convince the rest lol.
i feel like vikk just let his girl play and he went to bed or something lmao
no harry no fun
Dejis quite a specimen bro, tries to vote tobi out for lagging through a door on his screen but tries to defend himself by saying theres no logic in voting him out 💀. High iq individual obviously 😭😭
I literally can NOT get enough of Sidemen Among Us!
deji so boring bruv stop inviting him
Cams should only be allowed after all tasks
Danny is content
Vikkstar yellow card incoming lol
legend has it that Lazarbeam is never playing another sidemen among us game again 💀
Just disable comms, cams then shut off, simple 😂😂
12:13 they should of voted Deji out just for the laugh, it would of been funny as hell
No among us vid is complete without ksi or deji
Days made
play texas chainsaw🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Behz is still stupid
I think sidemen among us is one of my fave series
Nah deji😂
Deji L bro😭😭
The sidemen should play the chainsaw massacre game! It’s games of 7 so it’s perfect
You should spam us with among us. I miss it to much waiting
Vik was hilarious in this episode 🔥🔥
Don’t know if its possible.. but you should do an among us reunion/special episode with all the sidemen, Randolph, Viz, Lazar, Ellum, Deji, Lachlan, Chrismd, chip, callux, freezy, Willne, Danny Aarons and Pieface. All these people, 3 or 4 imposters. Pure chaos 😂😂
12:36 u played that well, hell naw u didn’t u idiot.
Danny milan kit W
Hold on u guys get mad when Deji stands on the cams but are totally Okay when Harry does it
🤣🤣12:03
Yo
The fact they complain about deji being on cameras, BUT NEVER KILL HIM, is actually so annoying
Tobi, you're not an idiot. You're a very smart person, and I'm being real with that!
Chat is this a Roronoa Zoro reference
Deji was smart in the earlier sessions, what happened?
@9:19 Ellum: “Grow man, you kneeek”   💀💀 Kneek grow?
Where the fuck is Harry
omg
That filter on Ethan HAHAHAHAHA
Chipfat with the great editing again 22:26
Cams after you done task would be a better rule
Sidemen among us never dies
simon never gets imposter... sucks
Josh should've sabotaged comms and it would've been easier
Vik contributed just as much to this video as he did to Christmas drillings.
Petition to take viz out for angry ginge
Josh has fallen off so hard 😭😂
Sidemen Among Us strikes back, it always brings me joy to see these videos
Nah vik is allowed to not care ngl
Lazarbeam is just more content and the next KSI for the sidemen
Vik being first on the bounty’s hit list 😂
They’re really blaming Vik for them wanting to vote him off???🤦🏽‍♂️😂
Sidemen Among Us is my new addiction 🤌
Always a great day when sidemen post among us
Vik was in the thumbnail but not in the video😂😂😂😂
That ellum guy is annoying. Get rid.
Finally
the Josh bit where he's running to reactor saying "oh no" 😂
Why didn't they just block comms so Deji can't use the cameras???? Like... what??
#22 sideman among us channel😊
#22 sidemenamongus channel
Finally among us😭
I like how Ethan tries to become soo oversmart while playing among us meanwhile everyone know he is the dummest sidemen
Vik never played this session of among us
Vik doing a silent win I’d assume
Deji the cam merch
hi
Love a sideman among us 🎉🎉🎉
inv speed on among us pls
Vik was a waste of a player on this.
the overlay of ethan holding his breath is unbelievable, well done editors lmao
Sidemen among us upload on my birthday 🥳 the best gift
SIDEMEN AMONG US MAKES MY DAY BETTER
So many IT issues even though they been doing this since 10 years now.
whose idea was it to play arabian theme music in the background.
thank you ... been waiting for among us series
Why can’t Tobi just try and be more interesting in these vids man
Vik didn't bother playing And not even his footage bother playing 😂
12:04 hollering 🤣🤣🤣 lannan and danny same person different fonts
Ellum gives me Morgz vibes idk why
Is this the AmongUs game Josh was referring to wherein Vik is not talking on the last MoreSidemen video?
Deji Masterclass
NDL
If their on cameras just call comms 😂❤ love  gg
TELL BEZINGHA, to get rid of hiccups just lean over forwards with ur head low ish, and drink your drink upside down. I’ve only had 100% success rate with this trick!
Vikk gets voted out randomly in the first game with no sus because of a joke, then gets killed first pretty much every other game. Tbh if that was me I wouldn't want to try too.
How does Vik not get a yellow card for this video…
Ginge needs to get on Sidemen Among Us
UPLOAD… THESE… QUICKER!
cant blame vik for voting himself bc these videos are horrendously funny bc everyone is so bad
Danny: do some tasks deji you have none Also Danny: 1 quest completed
BEEN WAITING FOR MORE AMONG US!!
its a good day when there's a sidemen among us. an even better one when Dannys there
Keep the amoung us content up!!!!! ❤❤
Vik spoke like three sentences the whole vid and chose to cook Josh 😂
It’s sad Danny got something right
This be better if cams was gone
Not really liking Ethan's attitude in this video.......
Dejis worse than Harry on cams 🤣🤣🤣
I love sideman among us
Lannan and Danny can never get along well 😂 Even if Lannan is trying to defend him 😂
They forget that calling coms is a thing when someone won’t get off cams
Danny screaming ITS JOSH AND DEJI I SAW JOSH KILL ON CAMS THATS ALL I NEED TO SAY. Whilst forgetting Viz also saw the first kill on camera but that wasnt enough for him, also he accused Josh AND Deji and didnt report the body to "Figure out who the other imposter is" when there was only one.... The most stupid player in here
Petition to get Danny and Lazar to meet irl
Please never stop these videos
What was up with Vik today, really weird
Tf was vik doing this entire vid
Ive been binging these videos and now heres another
nothing better than getting back from work and a new among us video is out
i miss randolph
vik should get a yellow card for not playing
The opening scene of KSI will never get old 😂😂
Is it just me or does Ellum rage in lower caps?
if the sidemen just did among us! like twice a week this channel would be full for an entire year! it's literally a 8 hour shift split into about 80 videos! but the sad thing is im here for it!
The only Moresidemen videos that matter
VIKK SHOULD GET A YELLOW CARD FOR THAT VIDEO
Bro I swear that among us should be uploaded twice a week if is the best content
RIP VIK ⭐ 123
Did anyone else notice that the bounty hunter role was extremely racist towards Indians cause Vik was the first bounty in 2/3 rounds
I’ve been waiting 😂!!!!
Danny had a masterclass this vid
I love this guys its just so fucking funny  lazar is the best
They need to bring the rule back where you can only go on cams when you’ve done all your tasks, it’s too op
20:00
Its a good day when sidemen upload amongus
Deji is a better Among us player than KSI.
Sitting on cams makes the game boring sigh
31:22 DEJI it’s the tasks… not the player number
Damn I really needed this video today 😮‍💨👏🏽
VIK LEAVING IS ASSAULTING TO THE SIDEMEN!!! RED CARD 😭😭
Do they know that sabotaging comms takes out cameras
Ngl this episode was DEAD
There’s no point having Vik in these lobbies anymore, rather get someone that speaks
Deji and JJ really don't need a DNA test😂
That last game was so shit because of Deji lol
Bro do you know how addicting it is watching these man play this game. Actually joke. Whole line up is Elite.
Why is deji always right but never for the right reason😂
LMAO
Deji was awful for this video
nah vik is king behz isn’t
28:29 EXACTLY VIK SPEAKKKKK
16:15 funniest ,montage hahah
Ethan's got a lot of stress going on in his life right now, so I'm just looking to add to that if I'm completely honest with you ~Danny Aarons 2023
26:29 DEJI LMFAOOOO
26:18 smartest kill
If you didnt see vik like this cm
This has to be the worst sidemen among us video I’ve ever watched.. For starters them trying to give a bounty hunter a chance to play seems unauthentic, and they also seemed less interested to play somehow!
Viks contribution was class
Vik is so boring fam he should get a yellow for his awful gameplay
Get Angry Ginge in these videos
Sidemen among us is the best series they do
Can someone ask lannan if he is OK?
editor deserves sum raise n praise. ellums voice over as Danny kills him is hilarious
Ellum ruined this video ngl
21:32 lazar ❤❤
21:16 Danny aarons masterclass
This is why I have a rule that if somebody just stays on cams, the imposter can kill them for free, cause they're just not helping at all
Great plays from Vik this video.
Get ellum outta these vids hes just annoying
Deji needs to do tasks and not sit on cameras... boring asf
These among us videos are one of the best forms of content on YouTube! When ellum and danny shout it's the best!
18:40-18:48 18:45 😂😂
18:43 sorry I laughed am here 18:48 and here 😭
Press play on the video..... Think to self 'I hope Lazar is in this one, its always better with Lazar!' Danny kills him 30 seconds later!  No!! Danny you rotten scoundrel!
17:01 ayo?
32:49 "Deji get off cameras mate you've done zero fucking tasks" - Danny Aarons who's done 1/7 tasks
Is nobody talking about how lazar just snapped his keyboard in half
1:58 that was like the angriest I've heard Tobi lol
Josh’s will to die are among us videos now.
14:46 W Tottenham L Arsenal  i like both viz and Danny btw ❤
dejis so annoying
13:32 Danny :🐸
Those who don’t have a fuck about the people that say those who didn’t come from tik tok can like this comment…
12:17 LMAOOO
has simons hair grown
Ahh was so exited when I saw this
Interesting
12:08 lmaooo lazar’s rage
For the imposters, hit comms to get rid of the camera and get a kill. Ik I’m a virgin
love how ellum rages
Lazarbeam brought out the Keji branded officeworks keyboard.
PLEASE stop inviting deji to these.... he ruins the whole vibe
10:27 W danny
Rule 1: no one on cams until your individual tasks are finished
we need angry ginge in the next one would be to jokes
Danny and Ethan are the funniest combo😂😂
HELP IVE BEEN WATCHIGN AMONG US SIDEMEN ALL DAY AND LIKR ALL NIGHT ITS JUST IDK GOOD
What Viz said to Ellum when they were voting him out is so true lol. He's trash even at a MoreSidemen level and lobby treat him like he's one of the star players!
8:32 me when I have to do anything
Just dont play with Danny
Vikkstar has a eyebrow pen is
Poor Vik. Nearly didn't played at all.
6:36 1/3rd impostored. Ethan actually did ok
They should start sabotaging COMMs when people are on CAMs.
Danny is actually comedy gold🤣🤣🤣
Tobi my guy!!!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 your art on your walls is hella amazing 😮❤
Poor josh whenever he’s imposter his partner get voted out first round and he has to 1v8
MORE PLEASE MORE !!!
The Ellum rant was the poshest rage I’ve ever seen
My Goats Carrying and reviving Among us
Na honestly, Deji ruined this lobby.   Need to get him off these videos, he literally doesn’t do anything.
Genuinely so annoying watching Tobi, anyone accuses him he just goes ‘just vote me I don’t even care’ it’s pointless him playing when he clearly hates it
Honestly Danny Aaron’s doesn’t listing and pisses of lazarbeam😂
If you get hiccups, have a tablespoon of sugar and roll it around your mouth for 30 seconds and its gone.
Fan of Vik's play on these lobbies, but disappointed that he didn't put an effort in this whole video. Common Vik , what's wrong with you...?? Where was your mastermind deductive skills...?? Please turn up on the next among us video.
I can't believe how little Vik cares about the content, we wait for these videos and we support you and... yeah real fans don't care, stop complaining. Leave the boys alone
1:22 *ok*
0:54 lazar and his keyboards ❤❤
Love you Danny ❤️❤️
Vikk just got married
It genuinely does make the video less enjoyable if the people playing the game can’t be arsed. Like they would be much better off getting other people like Pieface who are engaged and keep the viewers engaged.
Could dej hear Eathan speak or am I just hella confused
Like if sideman should do among us videos once a week .
No Ethan u just ruin the whole vid, at least vik just dipped so he didn’t ruin the vid 💀
You need a rule for the cams like you cant use them until u do all your tasks or something 😂 its to op
yesss my daily  __ its that good it can congigate any adgictive or (drug) dopamine!!
danny betting his mortgage like it’s not just his caravan insurance
Such a dead role.
I actually think KSI should be replaced by Deji in the Sidemen for good, the video is an easier watch with Deji's positivity.
Danny and Deji CARRIED this episode 🤣🤣
Finally back
The combined IQ of this lobby is dropping every session and I love it
People who didnt come from tiktok are allowed to like this comment!
Sidemen never fails to entertain
I love ethan taking the piss out of the stupid fans who always complain
Best gaming content on youtube I SWEAR I AINT GLAZING
I love how brain dead imposters are when they accept defeat 😂 it makes it funny, josh seems to do that a lot 😅
you donut🤣🤣🤣
WHEREE IS HARRY
Simon and behz are matching with their characters
Part 2: https://youtu.be/hN4YoXaQe9c?si=yUhr-dRl_x7Zm8sP
YESSS MORE AMONG US
bb jester
22:48 bro the "19 years I've known that guy and this is how he treats me" was hella funny💀
NEED ANGRY GINGE IN THESE !!
Ethan and Dej laughing at the same time is great 😂
Poor Vikk can't wait to leave SIDEMEN for Lazar
love deji being here i'll be honest
I've watched every sidemen among us and i can easily say Ellum is the shittest player ever. Not even funny, just plain bad.
The cameras on this video just decided to have a mind of its own
Danny being the new bog
I was saying to myself “I wish there’s a sidemen among us video soon” and it comes today
“‘old that Dej, pussyole”   🤣
Lazer can't take any breaks
BABE WAKE UP SIDEMEN AMONG USS
wow among us was trending 3 yrs ago
just turn off comms to beat cam mercgants
o/
Why wasn’t vik doing anything the whole time 😂😂
Why was vik so quiet
Vik just got married in Malta 🥳
I saw this and clicked so fast, I’ve been waiting so long for another among video 😭
More among us please
Random question :- Messi or Ronaldo ?
Let’s not go on vik he is calm
Deji and Danny are the best Guests for Sidemen Among Us, 🐐
Vik was really good in this vid but behz was throwing
FINALLY ANOTHER SIDEMAN AMONG US!!!
I hope Viks okay:)
14:38 “It’s a Arsenal and Tottenham duo”
Viz is soooo jarring
The preparation for Lazars keyboard throw gets me every time 😂
can't you just sabotage comms to turn the cams off?
It ain't the same without vikk footage
who else thinks the sidemen should play with people like smajor and hafu cause I think it’s be hilarious
Angry ginge needs to be in these 💯
If I was josh I'd have got my bounty and tried getting a kill streak of bounty kills when they were all clustered together. Would've had to been lucky with it but would've been interesting to see
Deji’s laugh is so contagious
I love Danny thinking he’s a good imposter and bigging himself for average stuff hahaha
You know this video is a month old because of simons haircut
Vik deserves a yellow for this performance
Amazing video 🎉
Vik always tryna get out of this
Vik should get a yellow card.
they replaced KSI with Deji
It’s the 123 and he just chillin 🤣🤣
Vik L, the colleague of the Sidemen.
Vik deserved a yellow for this vid 😂
I can tell these mfers are DRAINED of this game lmfao
Yessssss please make more!!
Tbf Deji is slowly getting better at sussing the right people 😂😂😂
Lazar is straight content
This was a really weak episode :-( i think the worst so far
They created a monster in Danny
We need this as a weekly thing
How does Simon have so much hair He just got buzzed
ethan bitching per usual
Out of all of them, Harry and JJ did the best...
this means more to follow as well😍
vikk in the thumbnail but not the vid haha
One of the boring episode of sidemen among us history.
7:02  Josh: NOOO I wanted to be bounty hunter   Also josh: YESS I GET TO BE BOUNTY HUNTER 🤤
Comment. No hate this time😊😊😊 They did well
Yooo that anime art in Tobi’s background is so sick
I missed Sidemen Among Us, love this series
Ethan making himself die laughing is the most wholesome thing somehow😂
FINALLY ANOTHER AMONG US VIDEO
Danny mad at Deji for having 0 tasks done but he only did swipe card 😂 32:51
Ellum is so cringe
Vikk didnt want to plug his shite glasses in this one?
Really hope Vikk is okay, didn't seem like he was with it this upload. :(
25:53 why did josh not vent out after killing Ellum, that was so stupid
Josh is a rotten imp
Toby literally thinks he’s better than everyone, can’t stand him
YESSSS MORE AMONG US
you guys are voting dj bc hes black you ricist
This is why i hate vikk
viz is annoying i dont like him
Vik needs a yellow card
LAZERBEAM Donate the keyboards you keep smashing.
Ellum  was calling people a sweaty nerd when he literally sounded like a nerd
Danny Arons, "I bet my morgage its deji" what morgage mate you got a caravan 😂
Get Angry Ginge on here for an episode if possible ! he was so funny in pro clubs
moreeeee sidemen among ussss
19
Viz absolutely threw that third game should’ve let reactor run out
Viks imposter is the colour of the card he should get for this effort
Vik said one line the entire game and killed his killer with it. My GOAT
Josh wasn’t lying he really was saying “oh no”
WOOOHOOOO THANG GOD SIDEMEN AMONG US
I want a game with the witch mod... Everyone sussing each other because they were too close to one another is going to be insane 😂😂😂
Ban cameras it's so boring. Or change map
Please make longer videos
Sidemen should do a no cam rule next time for among us
Bro why is viz such a sweat
19:00  “Honestl- WHAT THE FUAÆCK”  😭
Vikks been babying his friends for 2 years in a video game. Not sayin I dont still love the content, but I can understand that he's probably bored af for the majority of these sessions now
Another Anny Daarons masterclass. Him and Lannan just glue so well!
Danny has no business being this angry when he didn’t just report simons body the second he saw it. Moron
Never stop these plz
"I'm him, I'm himothy".👌👌👌
We need Harry in Among us videos
The new fans will say what vik did was funny but if ethan did it big issue
#dannyout can't stand it
Camera camping is so dead. Also Vik ruined the video
More more more more more 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Was vik in this vid
Brooo... Vik coming in in the last round just to roast josh and then go back to being an npc 😂😂😂
Ellum is funny
Been waiting for more than a week for the among us to release😌
We don’t care about roles we wouldn’t mind normal sidemen among us as long as u guys post at least once weekly
Its 2023 maybe stop playing among us?
Sidemen among us will always be my fav  video to watch it just never gets old
Ellum is everywhere these days. First he is/was playing Among Us with Hafu while playing games with Talia and Simon and now he is playing variety with Valkyrae and Fuslie (which Sidemen still haven't set up) as well as being in general Sidemen gaming content.
If this is the greatest series of all time, like thos comment
yk its bad when danny and lazar are teaming up
The amount of chaos josh can cause Is immense  Edit : likes are cool
SCUFFED
Lazar every video be like “itsssss 3am”
Haven't see it but arleady love it!
Give someone hacks in secret and see how much chaos u can cause
This needs a once a week thing
This is one of the best episodes 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ethan's first hiccup after claiming they were gone was funny
Is it just me or the sidemen should switch up maps?? Dude you guys have 3 more maps, play on them it will make it more interesting and funny... That's what I think
2:18 2:40 4:42 _4:48_ 6:13 6:30 7:13 28:25 30:46 33:25 33:33
Danny and Deji had a masterclass this video.
MORE aMONG US PLS
Stop playing skeld map and go to polus! you guys are good as crewmates especially with cams! there the imposters might have a decent and a fair chance.
I still can’t get over dejis set up hahs
FINALLY FINALLY , Love it, Among Us
I like what tobi did with facecam
How do they get these.. do they pay for it, is it updated game. What 😢
I had to sub so KSI would stop calling me pussio
No Viks were hurt in this video
Why was vik even there☠️
ITS BACK YESSS
amongus with 4 sidemen (excluding jj harry and VIKK)
About time for a new episode
Only videos I watch on YouTube without skipping 1 second
finally a good moresidemen
Finnaaallyyy we need more of sidemen among usss ive watched the whole 50 among us vids
didnt viz had s stinker here 15:28 ? why didnt he let the reactor go?
Behz is good vibes man
Danny got so mad but to be fair he chose not to report the body so that's his fault for being an idiot lmao
behz in among us is something else lmao, he's too funny
i like how ethan isn't letting the comments get to him as much people will talk about how sensitive the world is nowadays and then get offended when someone they've never met makes a comment that doesn't affect them in any way
Ngl these cam players are just noncey, PLAY THE GAME!! 😂
The other boys had good vibes in this video but honestly Vik could’ve ruined it
That last round was dead tbh. The rest good as usual. Maybe tell people to not sweat cams.
W music @editors
no but Josh is really shit at the game
Yay more sidemen amogus my favoriteee
Why not sabotage communications?
Danny lacks brain cells
Can’t stand Ellum the mug
C'mon when u guys don't wanna play these videos seems boring asf and we love among us videos
Seriously, whats with Josh's imposter partner always getting offed? 😂😂
Sidemen single handedly keeping among us alive
2:22 LOL   5:09 5:14 5:20   6:07   10:32   11:50 ITS NOT ME!  16:26   19:39 19:46   20:37   25:52 25:56 25:58   26:22 them screaming at deji LOL 26:41 26:45   27:15 LMAO   27:31 27:52 28:00 28:06 28:13 The sound barrier   28:22 28:25   31:15 31:22 31:27 deji getting cooked   32:02
Ellum is the cringiest bloke alive
16:00
What a surprise a few minutes in and Simon's already moaning
Hello James
wow
josh is the worst impostor
21:26 i had to replay the part bc lannon actually praised danny for something. there is actually good left in this world. damn.
Finally I can eat
Deji on cams and vik no showing ruins the videos
Is Danny's shirt inside out
Deji seeing both those kills and saying “wait viz just killed, I should report” had me dead 🤣
Nothing makes my day more then when I see sidemen drop a amoung us vid🫡
Am I tripping or has Simon hair grew back really quick
Every time I see sidemen among us video ❤😊
wwooooowww vik really herring himself voted put so he psnt have to play is crazy wouldn't expect it from the supposed mother  of the group but guess yhings have changed since he started pursuing a career with D.Jing
why cant ethan be botherd in the videos? he kinda ruins it
Deji’s so annoying lol
This would have been good if Ellum wasn’t in it tbh
If there was xxx content in among us then 4 sho cams all day - but to sit on cams is Harry's task all other neeks find another glory hole
Day 3 of asking for sidemen cards against humanity to Make a bloody return!
Much like his brother Deji gets super defensive even if he’s not impostor.
Vikk not being in the game reminds me of - "oh okay" and drinking his coffee with the car with KSI
WE ALL MISSED SIDEMEN AMONG US!!!!
vikk bars in the end..cold
their videos are so ass lately
Josh gotta understand how sabotaging comms works
Bring back DCI pie 🫡
Please get Ellum & viz out of these videos they are so boring and jarring. And not funny not even in the slightest
oh cmon just play 1 normal game without anyone being like '' just vote me out'' or '' i dont want to play anymore'' this bit is not FUNNY ANYMORE
Can you guys get this comment near the top. Comms sabotage litteraly disable cams bro!
Vik should get a Yellow Card for not even trying
if thats the alternative camera angle for toby I would rather look at a black screen than his massive nostrils wide open.  I feel like they are staring back at me and i dont feel okay. we need an intervention.
How cant even the sidemen fill out these lobbys
I want to be Lazar beam rich 😅 breaking keybords
I was gonna say how it feels like josh is showing soo much more character and charisma on these vids and then 16:02 happens the more things change the more they stay the same😂😂😂
There can never be enough Sidemen Among us
YEEESS WE GOT MORE🎉
I fucking hate Danny
The more you mature the more you realize more sidemen is the better channel
Anyone know the music from 25:00 on?
we need weekly Sidemen Among Us vids
deji is just so stupidley funny
1:36
Vik puts in no effort fr he doesn’t care about any sidemen video he needs the sack
Lazar's arsenal of keyboards 😂😅
Might as well just replace KSI with Deji at this point
Danny “I’m willing to bet my house deji is sitting on cams  *cuts to deji saying being on cams is fun*😂
Finally not 6 months late to a sidemen among us video
Is it just me thats getting annoyed that deji is on cams most of time?
Poor from Vic that
0/7😂🤣
Vikk honestly just couldn’t bother you know
Tobi has the coldest poster evah
🗣#killhiminthecomments🧍🏾‍♂️
Ethan is always a very baby😂😂
sidemen among us on my birthday???? elite.
Vik was in the vid?
always a good day when a sidemen among us comes out.
josh reminds me so much of drake idek why
Love the among us vids!!! Keep them coming
Why is Dejis setup in his kitchen😂
Vik L 😂 stealing a wage lmao😊
Tobi is annoying and makes these videos harder to watch with him in them. The more he is more and more involved them they are boring like his personality
Please play on the bigger map next time
2 hour
I hope Vik didn’t get paid a penny for this video 😂😂😂😂
Deji revived the Among Us series but he needs to focus up on boxing
Danny: I played that so well  Also Danny: Walks up to a dead body and leaves it while someone is on cameras.
Danny always get imposter
"I was like oh no"   Oh no.... oh no.... oh no😢
👍 For sidemen among us 👍
Surrely this is a yellow card for Vik😂
this needs to become weekly
I’m with Ethan. I thought the second Vik voted himself that he’d might as well have not bothered with this and gone and made more kid videos with his other friends instead.
Vikk should honestly get punished for not playing... Poor effort from him
Harmonized beautifully at 4:24
LazarBeam Rage Quits! 😡
Is Ellum's sense of humour talking as loud as he can? bare funny
Why did vikstar say nothing this whole vid
Let's gooo
Dejii and aroons
Bout time you guys uploaded lol
No way youndid that
Does Vik even exist in Sidemen Among Us?
vikk is actually so dead
33:42 deji's laugh is so contagious 😂
32:09 u could hear that KSI was just about to spond in🤣
Deji is doing Harry's work 😅
I NEED SOME AMONG US WEEKLY UPLOAD <3
Is vikk even playing?
For the killers sake, yall should make it a rule that your only allowed on cams if you completed all your tasks
Just wanted to see someone go on a proper rampage 😂
Josh stinks so hard, it's sad to see the downfall
Ethan should play in the special kids league
Ksi being silly is funny iconic deji being silly is just annoying
Every video lazar just breaking keyboards is hilarious 🤣💀
The caption should’ve been: “Among us but our cameras are offline”
deji is somehow worse, more stupid and more annoying than randolph
BEZ has to start thinking logically who it could be and just Vote the complete other person
Danny and Lannen are so good in these, There jokes in both roles and really entertaining.
12:26 me after fumbling a 10/10
Tobis set up is looking sick
Make a mod where you can't access Cameras and you have the Bounty Hunter as well as the Spouse mode on. It would be chaaaooossss......
I love how deji has complained about being crewmate at every video he has been in hahaha
Demi’s laugh gives me cancer
KSI or Deji, doesnt matter. That Olatunji stupidity always tops off a great vid
I thought Josh was supposed to be smart. Why didn't he kill Ethan when he stood by cams and acted as bait, get a 2 second cooldown, and just kill the person on cams?
Wanny Warons
Deji being on cams is funny but when Harry does it he's treated like the special kid
6x "oh no" hits different😂
pump me full of among us videos sidaddys
vikk 100% deserves a yellow. not showing up for a video, and being literally AFK for the entire video are the exact same thing. i’m glad he was silent because at least he didn’t ruin the vid like usual, but come on
No JJ no Harry no vikkstar talking sense..This was the first amomg us video which proved to be an absoulte stinker..
gonna need 2 among us videos weekly. the thing is half of the most popular moresidemen videos are among us videos so Idk why they don't do atleast a weekly one.
OK so Danny's one of the dumbest on here now. He was Willingly gonna just not report, then goes STRAIGHT to the body FOR NO REASON, allowing people to sus him, then follows Josh and then decides then that hell want to win. Then OUT IF NOWHERE AGAIN, suses Deji to make Deji not want to Vite for him, and then not letting Lazar help him do it and then is the one to say he's the one with Brains. That might be one of the worst single round performances ever on Sidemen Among us and that's saying something. He won that round IN SPITE of hinself
I just wanna comment just to appreciate Ethan. Literally my favorite moments in Among us is mostly his. I don't think he knows the impact of his role in these videos.
They lose games by “taking the piss” like every game lol. One wasted round of voting someone who is obviously innocent is killer for the crew. Yet they do it all the time for a mediocre laugh.
This was one of the shitest among us vids, no ksi, no w2s, viks not playing, the cameras not working, we’re lucky we got danny, viz and ellum are boring, all just my opinion
i love some good Sidemen Among Us
31:10 as soon as Deji asked Ethan I knew exactly what he was cooking.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
25:07 kinda wholesome
should put in the rule no cams until all tasks are done
I can’t stand Deji’s laugh y’know 🤦🏼‍♂️
I LIVE for Sidemen among us
Deji did better than Harry on cams just saying
these vids r goated prove me wrong
Please more of among us 🙏🙏
Ethan using SNUS??????
Deji doesn't know how to talk
Who else misses Simon’s hair?
Idk what’s happened with Vikk but I hope all is well❤️
Vik had some big brain plays man
Yessssssss
#VikCancelled
The best sidemen videos
Was waiting for this agian
another moresidemen video being pushed forward by the 123
Without all the sidemen, it doesn’t fit for me.
Ellum has a clapped face
I was just watching sidemen among us videos and I got the notification for this one. Timing was incredible 🔥
not much energy without harry and jj
I love these but Vikk and Deji kinda ruined this one
Danny could’ve saved himself a headache if he would’ve just reported the first body lmao
They should premiere these
These video would be so much better if it wasn’t Danny playing
We love sidemen among us
Tf was vik doing 😭
Petition to get angry ginge on sidemen among us
Hey someone please tell me where I can get that naruto and and eren picture or painting or poster whatever it is please I need that in my room it's behind tobi
Sabotage Comms it takes cams offline boys
I love that Deji has become a regular member in among us videos. He’s so funny in these
i love this series so much
been subscribed to this channel since 2017😁
honestly true, vikk doesnt seem to care much anymore
Vik not trying in any round wasn’t cool
I am absolutely dead 😂  ‘It’s Josh!’ 💀
Vik on thumbnail but he didnt talk once
WHO ELSE LOVES WHEN A NEW AMONG US VID DROPS!  I  I \/
The fact that there was two bodies behind deji is mad
You want more views? STOP killing Lazar!!
Is it only me that Deji’s laugh get all the time 😂😂😂
Deji ruined it
Josh:You weren't playing so u cant talk  Vik:I didnt need to play i knew you were gonna throw  Deji&Ethan;oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Alright so we can agree that Vik was here but he wasn’t here
Normal people: See a kill and report  Danny: Sees a kill and instead decides to incriminate himself and then report another kill he sees, therefore further incriminating himself  Deji: Just sits on cams for a solid minute for no reason before reporting the two bodies right next to him
“I’m gonna bring out another keyboard” I feel so fucking bad for lazar 😭😭😭
it's hilarious that the two people who hardly done anything throughout the session are the ones on the thumbnail
I love Vikk but this was just lame. Dont show up if you are this unbothered
I am addicted to These among us videos
We need harry it's soo much better with him
Danny Arons is so annoying in this game.. its unbelievable. Also, for some reason, Josh (zerkaa) seems to have lost his MOJO in this game... why was Vik so quiet ?
Get Angry Ginge on the next one
i fuckingggg loveee these vediossss should post one daily tbh
I can finally eat food again.
Vikk being the first person the bounty hunter targets every single round 🤣  The clips I'm going to make from this video are going to be elite!
I get viks footage got corrupted, but man your a millionaire who plays among us for a living - at least try to get involved and be entertaining (u still a goat tho all love)
I love Ethan piping up back at the fans lol talk your shit
how they blaming vik, they the ones that voted him out. idiots
Omg, finally an Among us video!!!😊
w love a bit of sidemen among us but the corrupted footage and webcam is kinda annoying me i can’t lie
danny with the clutch today n vik not saying nothing then bullies josh at the end
Among us is by far the best moresidemen series
I just love Lazarbeam angry at this point 😂😂
Pause at 21:38 💀
Ellum needs to get out these videos bruv kids jarring
Sideman.  And more hello
Josh just casually drinking Nocco🔥
Vik the *unt didnt do nothing
Keep these up! Funny because it just is you know!! No conmen sense is the best
I LOVE these videos!!
Ethans right tbf, if he or Simon did what vikk did this game then they'd be crucified... What's the point in being in the vid
Need jynxzi and angry ginge in these with Danny would be hilarious
I love these among us videos ❤️ they will never get old
Create a mod to where each person only has 20 seconds on cams a round
dani and tobi putting on a master class
Not cool vikstar taking the audience for granted aint cool
Haha Simon and Ethan are kinda pathetic, you can tell they're trying to bring hate to the other sidemen to deflect the hate of themselves😭
Why Vik so quiet check on him😢
Sidemen sunday idea who ever gets the most kills across 10 games of among us has to cook for the rest of the sidemen
Viz gets on my nerves 100% no offence
So ONCE again, Vikstar has shown up, said nothing, got paid and fucked off 🫠🫠
5:22 this must go down in Tobi's funniest moments, "Hold That Dej Pussyhoe" 😂😂
(Not a hater) but Vikk thinks hes so clear from the sidemen. Y join if u ain't gonna talk and shit 6:32
Danny is that guy who's so crap at the game but his stupidity makes him think he's actually good
How Come Simon has Hair in this Vid he got a Buzz cut
Danny: I am gonna let Josh get on with his day  Ten seconds later   TURNING INTO A RED TOMATO TELLING EVERYONE TO SHUT UP  Deji: Ay Viz your dead *End up getting voted* timestamp  20:38
new merch, deji on cams with 0 out of 7 task
loving the among us vids (like if we need more) >>
Deji is boring
Tobi really got the JME webcam setup
Love how Ellum smiles so much when he’s “getting angry” 😂
These are hard to watch with Deji in, He is some how even louder and more annoying than KSI which is genuinely impressive.
Ethan is the funniest, bro just finishes tasks and stands on cams😂😂😂
Aren’t they in malta tho??
https://youtu.be/E8xp0iYXIaQ?si=kjqzouqhx-_NnUJD
Everyone complains about cams, but decide to constantly kill someone in front of one of the 4 cams that cover maybe 5% of the map total
Is that Ellum guy like a make a wish kid or something? There’s no way the sidemen are actually friends with that neek
The way I look forward to these sidemen among us videos are crazy. Love you guys !!!!
Deji with his Amazon IQ 😂😂😂
can we all agree cam warriors are no fun to watch and no fun for imposters like make it so you can only use cams after you finish your tasks
Ima watch this tomorrow, cant wait! I LOVE AMONG US
vikkstar wll retire before the sidemen stop making videos.
Not lazar just casually breaking keyboards
I hope Vik is ok… but it was disappointing him not putting some heart to play.. but who knows
finally sidemen among us agaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin
Is it just me or you lot also got annoyed by the deji's camera thing....bruh do some tasks man...!!!!
New among us video = new keyboard destroyed by lazarbeam
warra masterclass from Danny Aarons
These cams plays are so boring
Nothing is Better Than Danny not Caring about josh killing Someone at 10:20😂
what the hell Vik
100watt, mazar mall 31st
Tobi got that JME camera angle
Finally..
People say father like son but after watching this vid it's like  brother like brother
I think the hates getting to ethan, when people over talk and talk quick. He’s sad bro, just for saying his opinion fuck all the haters 👍
I came from Tik tok
i liked vik this vid, however i didnt bc i like when he gets mad at brainless decisions made by ethan or smth
colab episodes about moded among us with sundee would be pog
Vikk played amazing 🙌😂
Let’s go 4 games of among us we are living good
Why is danny getting so angry. He didn't report the body on purpose then gets mad when people don't believe him. like shut up.
guys if u sabotage comms, it disables the cameras....
deji channeling his inner jj and harry
why does ellum look like he wears makeup
josh's falloff on among us has to be documented
No Deji please
Why is the bounty always on Vik 😂
Lazar beam accepting with Danny for once
boring
guys violate danny for no reason
Fav series on yt
Yayyy!!🎉 Sidemen among us I look forward to these days😆👍
Doug the bounty hunter? Danny Aaron's is stupid af.
vik being in the thumbnail must be a joke
vikk being a npc the whole vid was jokes tbh
Josh saying he’s gonna go crazy to then absolutely not go crazy is hilarious
Josh's uh oh had me in tears😂
Vik is so quiet
love these among us videos
this video was filmed so long ago that simon still had hair 😂
Vik the pedophile
Man of the Match goes to Vikk
Ethan calling everyone his friend 😂
Deji not getting off cams with 2 bodies behind him is the most Deji thing ever
why does josh act like he can’t have a good imposter game, bros lame ash
do they not realize that sabotaging coms takes out cams?
Ellum: “you neek” to deji, bro what did he sayyyyy
Sidemen among ussss!
just saying this video was a banger but Vik never talked and had no camera and bounty hunter maybe wasent THE best
Deji needs to stop screaming all the time..
How does Simons hair grow back so fast
Sidemen among us  is goated
Star wars fans came for the thumbnail
use me as the ban cams button
Vik is the best sidemen.
that edit w dejis mouth killed me off
Was hoping danny wasn't in this fml would rather have caner
if Vikk does not want to play , dont bring him in
29:21 Danny and deji😂
4:45
Deji is the best among us player
Tobi latched on the special kid on the first round😂😂
Deji's laughter is awfully irritating, damn!
looks like sidemen cba with this anymore, the guests literally carry. Shame because it's their best content atm imo. I mean the rest bring something but Vikk and Josh, what is the point of them being in the video they're clearly not bothered
Imagine coming home from a long day and seeing new sidemen among us
They took so long to upload an among us video simon grew back his hair
Unpopular opinion: tobi giving up every round saying yeah fine vote me is extremely annoying
L ellum
“those who didn’t come from tiktok, are allowed to like this comment… 🤓”
It’s an amazing day when there is a new sidemen among us
I feel like they should put a ban on going on cameras 😂
Has simons hair grown in a week
Vikk spoke 3 words the whole video.
Vik was amazing in this video!
Vik kept getting kill but still took the W! 🐐
If I was vikk, I’d be tired of behz too and vote myself
U GUYS ARE IN MALTA !!!!!!
anyydarrons masterclass
Surely there’s not been a single video Danny has been in where he has not got imposter
poor from vikk
13:28 🍿🍿🍿
vik is an awful person literally  killed the whole vibe
WE NEED GINGE IN AMONG US
Deji is trash, stop bringing him back for Among Us, these games are too much fun with a cams merchant
Vik had a whole one minute of screen time
Tobi pisses me off man he’s such a pick me, plays the victim every damn time. Every time he’s imposter and he gets a tiny bit of sus “oh just vote me then” it’s so annoying
Yay more sidemen Amongus
Danny refuses to report the body....... Sees another body with Josh..... Doesn't say anything... And calls people idiots 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Deji turned  into Harry
Enjoy your special day Vik 🎉 💍
VIK IS DONE WITH THE SIDEMEN I BET 100k he wants to leave them first
Simon looks so good in that shirt every time
I love gabby
Vik will leave Sidemen end of 2023, he can only bring the energy every 1 out of 4 videos due to his other businesses.
Deji is GOATED MORE DEJI BIDEOS
Poor from vik
Make a role where you win if you get a specific crewmate voted out
Vikk, or to give him his full name, vikktim
No Danny throws congrats
Anyone wonder why Tobi always screams when he sees a body
31:31 Deji selling with 0/7 tasks lmao
Was there any point of having Vikk playing at all? Literally probably just sat on his phone doing fuck all that’s why they can’t show the footage 😂
I love when I have a nice meal laying in bed and see either a sidemen Sunday or sidemen among us. Makes my day
I need Randy back in these vids, he’s top tier.
*Ethan is the BEST third imposter!*
Get ginge on this
W Ethan 😂
Vikk participated more in the thumbnail than the actual video
Danny Arron’s voice annoys the living fuck outta me but he’s entertaining as shit🤣
peak
Deji is the new harry, always checking the cameras 😌
Doug the bounty hunter... do you mean dog the bounty hunter 😭🤣
Tobi with the jme angles you love to see it
Vikk contributed more to this video than Ronaldo did against Morocco
The chad move from Vikk voting himself out lmao
Behz gets so pissed off at sidemen fans it’s so funny
Vik 💀
These bots are fast
Love the passion from Danny 😂
Vikk doesn't add much to the videos, huh? I literally wouldn't have noticed he wasn't playing if the others weren't talking about it lol
Deji’s laugh sounds like KSIs chainsmoking granny😂
No cap they better keep doing sidemen among us for the rest of eternity cause it’s the only thing that keeps me going
Danny: "I'm himothy"
Vikk the goat.
Camara just Comms Sabotage ....
This lobby is actually brain dead when deji first joined he was so Smart now he is DUMB AF
If I see one more of these videos I’m gonna kill myself
What took yall so long
always a good day when these are uploaded
💪💪💪
in the first round the way danny kills lannan straight away without knowing its him killed me 😂😂
Crazy having a more sidmen video without Harry and jj
Danny thinking he played that well after walking past a body and not reporting it is a classic🤣🤣
Don’t invite Deji back, he’s too annoying
Since Ethan got a child mans just out here more sensible lol maybe I'm wrong but he has gotten happier
Oh yesssssss
28:10 DEJI TURNED INTO JJ
This is Danny's video for sure!
I love sidemen and friends doing amount us. Please give us more
Bounty hunter with 15 players would be perfect
“Deji what you looking at!!!!” 🤣🤣🤣
You're supposed to hold your breath and swallow to get rid of hiccups 😂
Chipfat’s constant Star Wars references are why I love him
Congrats to everyone Who is early and Who found this comment
Danny being in among us makes me scream😂😂😂
I pray Who ever Reads this Becomes succesful in Life
If you are an imposter and you dont want ppl to be there on cams, then you can sabotage communication
ethan’s a nonce
Its a good day.
please bring back prox chat. the chaos was golden
Deji now knows what happens when you try to troll in sidemen among us 😂😂
Bro how is the target Vikk every time 😂
Get angry ginge in
The editing on these is next level
The olatunji brothers and thier iq in among videos is jokes 😂
SIDEMEN AMONG US!!!
Get angry Ginge on this
Well thats a red card for vikk right??? Love vikk but dude aint playing lol
Vik needs a yellow for this performance icl😂
Imagine getting paid to sit in your arse and play games and refusing to do so
Get angry ginge in
This is probably the best role in sidemen among us history
This is exactly what I need before my exam.
Deji has been a great addition to this series he makes everything funnier than it is
When is Danny gonna realise that's not where do the card swipe
It is so boring with cams being camped
every bounty on Vikkstar
the men dem be slacking. tobi AND vik not having face cam working
Vikk being in the thumbnail is so ironic because he’s just barely playing gotta love the man
“I am you c**t” .. that’s as Aussie as it gets
SDMN Among Us: Imposters chat proximity mode
Bravo to the editor for my making this video happen it must have been very difficult with all the cameras not working and the bad audio 👏👏👏👏👏
Deji is funny af in these among us vids
Pls bring back sidemen charades
Josh has to be cursed at this rate, with him being impostor and his teammate getting booted off early.
Finally
why do people wear caps in thier house lol
Deji dont be a prick ok
Tobi always do the "i dont care vote me out" crybaby thing every time he's imposter
lazar gets bullied
Waited for 2 weeks + just for a 30 mins video 🥲
Tobi the goat
The series that we have been waiting for a long time 🔥
Iv been waiting for another vid
how old is this vid simon has hair
Vikk Getting head the whole recording
Lazer actually puts sm effort into these videos and it goes unnoticed. Big up yaself
Behz is actually the best  3rd imposter
Lazar x Danny friendship arc
I thought the "brain dead lobby" was just a gig until now.
holy fuck tobi is kinda bad at this game. how.
"IT'S VIZ IT'S VIZ IT'S VIZ"
Gotta love how Lazarbeam has all those keyboards ready to smash lol
1 min in and behz is already 3rd imposter
Would be cool to see Viz and Ellum in more sidemen videos they're good vibes
Deji gotta be stupid
facecams not working, Vikk not playing.. Whats going on lmao
ngl vik needs a yellow for that
Lazar dying first everytime is hilarious 😂😂
danny: sees body but doesn't report also danny: 12:35
Red card vikk
Video editz is insane
1009 th cmment
vikk just leave the sidmen please
God I've missed this
Surely that’s a yellow card for vik. Blud literally contributed nothing at all. Shame
On time and another among us🔥 gonna be a banger
there’s literally no point in the bounty hunter if they aren’t making use of their 3 second cooldown, danny had so many opportunities for example.
Am I the only one that loves this series but gets absolutely jarred when they don't fully give out obvious info. Like there, Deji could have simply said he saw Tobi with Viz but decided not to, it's entertaining but jarring at the same time😂
Ethan’s lazy eye was buggin today 💀
I love deji man hahaha
josh was the bounty hunter could of killed vikstar and simon in 3 seconds, you're smarter then this josh
This video shows how dumb deji is
I fucking lost when josh killed simon on cams twice. lmao I can't breathe!!
i click on these videos sooo fuckin fast😂😭
OMG vikk cba to be in the video what a bad man. He lost his respect for his fans so he lost his respect for his family OMG. (For the dumb and stupid new fans this is all a joke btw)
Ellum always gets caught killing 😂😂
i love how everyone thinks that cameras make everything harder when there's literally comms sabotage 😭😭😭
I normally love these, but this one was bland. Mostly due to Deji's constant campin, Vikk being almost completely uninvolved and the new role didn't seem to add anything in beyond  a "recommended" target.
Sir Deji the cam merchant, neet and no 7 tasks
Sitting on cams 24/7 makes the video a bit boring tbh
Lazar is contributing to climate change...
Sidemen need to invest in some new cameras lol
Vik pissed me off this vid I have to say
can i get a shout in the next video
Josh sucks so hard
0:00 JJ growling Still makes me laugh 😂
i reckon vik is doing a sounboard vid
Best videos
A better version of Harold in cams
Behzingha is too painful to watch man. Serial killers should hire him as a defence attorney cause he will 100% pin it on someone else
9:38 chipfat missed a great opportunity to insert arteta's meme😂
Do a 1 hour amongus
get randy back on these
Man what is vik doing
1 hour tickets🎉
i love how josh blames vik for his own mistake, he didnt need to vote vik round 1, thats all on him
the only lobby where they end up voting out the other person instead of 'the one' they should actually vote out LOL.
Vik should have to do a 24h live stream of among us for that lol😂
Who else just loves when a new sidemen among us drops  It's just great
Deji is so funny 😂
Danny looking like a tomato after he got something right
Ellum raging is always funny 😂
Wth does Viz say at 14:37? I can't make it out
The editors of this channel are the most pathetic editors they have. They cant go one day witbout clickbaiting or using fake thumbnails 🤦🏾🤦🏾.     Otherwise this channel cant get any views.
Sidemen Among Us is a Therapy Session
Boring among us. Rare. Lobby is a bit dead.
Can we just appreciate how the sidemen just pump me with content
Ban cameras
Tobi is doing to much with this i don't care act
FINALLY MORE
Get Angry Ginge in Sidemen Among us
Danny’s bit about knowing Ethan’s stressed and wanting to add to it, loved that energy
YESSSSS
Nothing is better than sidemen among us
Should have 20s on cam then a cool down
I love deji in these videos
Simon still got hair 💀
Waiting 3weeks for among us hurts my heart
cam merchant is the best role fr
❗If you want sidemen among us atleast once a week like my comment❗
Tobi no camera and vik no footage hilarious
Sack deji off man
ellom looks ike a vampire
this video made my day
Balls
Deji is so annoying, JJ can't be replaced
R.I.P Lazar’s Gaming Room😂
I love sidemen amongus
Rip vik 😂
Imagine if simon acted like vikk....yall would be mad with rabbies.....stupid lot
Yesssss
You know it’s a good day when the sidemen uploads.
5:19 deji playing with the soft pad from his headset because he doesn’t know how to put it back on 😂
We need more among us
Anyone else noticed the bape blue bear from the sdmn gift vid is still there in Ethans's back ground.
The best vid with Vik on the Internet. It's just the feeling when you could experience something bаd but you didn't. It's like not receiving much work to do when it was promised.
Respect the special appearance made by Vikk in the thumbnail of this video! 😂😂😂
we nnnneeeeeeeed more amogus
damn Simon and Ethan are not happy about the comments on Harry's beautiful forfeit video
Vikk should get a yellow for this or atleast tell him to wake up next time
Ethan is third imposter, deji is actually the smartest here
Id much prefer they just do a daily more sidemen video and just one epic sidemen Sunday a month.   They do filler sidemen Sundays anyway, more sidemen is better than the sidemen channel, frees up time in their schedules.   Start a petition
I think "sidemen among us but you can't skip votes" would be hilarious
More among us
You should ban cameras
Ellum kinda cringe ngl
If you want to kill on cams you should do the comms imposter sabotage in the bottom right. It exists literally to prevent this issue.
Love it
JJ 😢
So late the "only people who didn't come from tiktok can like this" bot is already on 1k likes
Lots of shouting on this among us episode hahahaha
Man I'm good on deji coming back to these lobbies man he is so vexing
Tobi gave his curse of being killed first every round to Vik 🤣
Vik was by far the most entertaining person this vid
I like how Vik came on to just insult Josh
YEss we want more amoung us even though we enjoy sit down vids
Ok genuinely Vik is already so boring and on top of that he isn't bothered to record like bruh put some effort
We will not tolerate Vikkstar123 no matter what. He’s the goat 🐐
FIRST
please please please don't stop making more among us. i absolutely love them and so do these people ↓↓
today is a danny aarons masterclass. Gg danny!
I need vikstar in among us
Bring back fifa guuuuys.. come ooon
I honestly think if your add angryginge to the next among us vid it will be the funniest shit ever
More sidemen amogus yes
Ethan’s sidemen fans comments was too good 😂😂
Danny: *”I played that so well”* Also Danny: *sees josh kill somebody and refuses the report the dead body* 😂
ya ya ya na na na na...
Get angry ginge on among us
25:00 lmaoo  ethan: if you f*ckers.... *literally 5 sec later* ethan: im playing with love today
Deji plays like a mixture of harry and ksi
Please never stop sidemen among us it is the best gaming series in this channel❤❤❤
Good vid
Is VIKK on his period or something in this video
lannan and danny fighting every session is hillarious 🤣🤣
i think i finally realised why i like these among us videos so much, the vibe just reminds me completely of their old GTA videos as its just them messing about and having fun like normal people.
The most boring sideman among us
i miss simons old hair 😂
Vote for more proximity mod
Do they not know if you sabotage comms then you can’t look on cams.
It's been recorded long time ago mate LIKE IF YOU NOTICED  👇🏻
Im so glaf thay arthur started the whole caravan joke. Long may it continue.
This comment section is Bot heaven
When are they gonna stop with Among Us. It’s so dead 😂 it’s been for the past couple years alreasy
They know comms is a thing right? They can use that and shutdown comms when someone's being a cam merchent
Vik didn't want to be here, I suspect his footage didn't corrupt he just did not want to record. People dying out here poor hoping for subs and watch time and this guy can't be bothered. PUSSIO
Danny is carrying this series at the moment
Been waiting for these checking back to the channel everyday lmao
Lmao Danny, don't read the comments. Even when it looks bad people usually like to talk shit just for fun 😂
Surely thats a vikkstar red card
FINALLY.. ITS BACK! We love some chaos and sussiness
Danny Aarons masterclass
Was vik forced to play or sumthin? Damn so fucking boring
How convenient for vikk's footage to be corrupted when he's AFK
❤
Wow viz , danny and josh with three times impostors
I love how Danny didn't immediately report Simon's body, inviting sus on himself, then accused Deji despite the fact Ellum had been voted out, AND also kept waffling instead of letting Lannan defend him, and then acted like he was the smart one.
you should do more among us videos
The last game had some crazy butterfly effect😂
Wow viz and danny two impostor wins , crazyy
I love how angry Lazarbeam gets 😂
Vik and Josh really do hate each other don’t they 🤣
Wow danny s gotten tooooo gooodat the game
Behz always playing 3rd impostor
Ethan misses so much😂
Don't get me wrong i love sidemen among us but this was the worst of all the series
hi
I watch old sidemen among us while waiting for a new one to come out 🥲 I have a problem
Ethan got a crazy victim complex
I feel sorry for lazar 😢😂
👇under 1 hour gang
SDMN Among Us > SDMN Sundays 😅
Just letting you know behz you bend your head back so you look up while holding your breath and your nose for 30 seconds to get rid of hiccups.
We ❤ vikkstar we do we ❤ vikkstar we do
Deji taking harry's duty
So we love Vikkstar but as loyal fans we have to kill him in the comments. Use this a thread.
Fair play vik
Ethan, Danny or Deji throwing is probably the funniest and best part of these videos.
so many kills couldve been saved with putting comms on so cams dont work😂
I love among us
33:34 Vik saying *I didn't need to play i knew you were gonna throw* to Josh was actually mad 😂
Why was Vik always the one who was hunted :(
YESSSS
i dont even blame vik for voting himself u got ethan already third impostoring
Simons wearing a Chicago shirt, yet the Sidemen will never do anything in Chicago for a video, even though they have a sizeable fanbase in the chicagoland area
why is the bounty hunter always targeting vik LMAO
we need more among us!
Simon's hair grew back
Charge your damn cameras lmao
Petition for among us at least every 2 weeks
This vid was definitely an improvement from Danny
Its okay to have an off day Vik
Petition for weekly among us
I will cry on the day they stop making these. I don't know why but it's sooooo good!
best on yt
1:09 keyboards were harmed in the making of this series. Rip
Big up Danny Arons 👏
Does Ethan have beach blonde eyebrows?  Also Vik has to get a yellow card for being POV AFK the whole video!
Personally best gameplay and input was vik my guy was on smoke his input in meetings was great big up vik ❤❤
Vikk can not be bothered with among us anymore 😂
Är det bara jag som svensk som blev glad att se Josh dricka nocco?
Yoo Tyrese if you see this I love you and respect you may God bless you ❤
danny is lucky
Vik felt like the friend who's just left out in this lobby lol.
Danny: “I’m gonna leave the body and let Josh get on with the round”  Danny 10 seconds later: “ITS JOSH I SAW HIM KILL!”
Got to be a yellow for vik
Cams party 🎉😂😂😂😂🎥📷
Simons being Danny’s bounty is almost on par with Simon and JJ being lovers lol.
I NEED a game with 3 impostors, that would be even more chaos
Danny masterclass
Love the fact Deji is recording in kitchen. Brings a sort of ambience to the gameplay, greenscreen or not
Let,s goooooooo🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
Vik said fuck this video
Watching sidemen among us has just become apart of my daily routine 😭😭😭
The bounty hunter role is the most pointless thing ever. Like there is no gain.
Hands down one of the best series of Sidemen
Danny actually playing good is pretty crazy😂
Use the comms sabotage more often, it turns off cams
Deji being crewmate = Wroetobog 2.0.
Vik absolutely shithoused this video
Vikk gave a quality content in this vid.
Jokes aside, hope Vik is okay
Why Josh didn't think to sabotage at oxigen 🤔
EARLYYY GANG
22:55 "19 years I've known thus dude and this is how he treats me" 😂😂😂
Get ginge in the next one
Deji and KSI really like to watch in cams in almost every Among us Vids
The murders done behind Deji are peak 😂😂😂
Who is putting bounty on vik man
Yeeeees!! Keep the among us videos coming!
CAN'T BELIEVE VIK DID THAT!! I WILL NEVER GO TO HIS SHOWS... ;)
I've been craving sidemen among us so much!!!
Ethan: I have a theory lads The entire universe: Ah shit, here we go again
The last week i rewatched all the sidemen among us again😂😭been waiting for them to upload again
Never EVER gets old 🫶
This video is dead. Get Harry back and kick Vik
Viz needs to allow content to happen more, not sweat it in this lobby
Tobi and Danny kindve a goated duo. One is quiet and the other one is loud
I love this content i whant more Amongos
Danny is such an odd fella and so annoying in these
Vikkstar participate in video’s unless he’s sponsored for it :/
Why did I read it as booty hunter?
Among uuuuusss!!!🎉🎉
I think vik will leave the sidemen first , ever since he's gotten married he's distanced himself in videos
Deji is better at this game than Ethan ever will be hahahahahaha Ethan’s so stupid
Deji master class
*ETHAN* is having *FUN* w/ *FRIENDS!* 🎉😂
Danny let Lazar speak 😂
Ban cams
vikk deserves yellow card
Deji filling in for Harry as Cam merchant.
Vik needs a yellow for this performance
GIVE US MORE AMONG US VIDEOS AND BRING GINGE
Why does Tobi even bother showing up if he just wants to quit
Vikkstar masterclass in this one
Hate when someone sits on cams that ain’t harry lol
Among us is a great video till vik doesn’t do anything.
Vikkstar got melted every round 😂
BEEN WAITING 4 WEEKS FOR A NEW ONE I WATCHED ALL THE OTHERS
Why did the remove the ksi ejection sound
Bruh how is vikk always the first bounty 🗿🗿
Woooow, poor from vik in the first round mates, give ‘‘em a red
Danny Aarons redemption and I’m here for it
FUCK "sidemen never fail to entertain us ❤" WHYS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT LAZER BEAM THROWING KEY BOARDS???
I need an angry ginge in this lobby
I don't like deji in sidemen clips
Jizz and darron masterclass
IM DOUG. IM DOUG THE BOUNTY HUNTER.
Please never stop making sidemen among us
That’s kind of stupid that cameras are clear even if lights are off
Deji has taken JJ’s place with the IQ in the lobby 😂😂
I love this series. It’s one of my favorites of all time
At this point sidemen are alone carrying among us😂😂😂
“Oh no, oh no, oh no” 😂😂😂
W video
Pls do more of these videos! They are legit entertaining
I almost forgot vikstar was in the video😂😂
would wanna see speed in am among us ngl
i feel like the only good thing to watch now a days from the sidemen is just AMONG US
why was vik even here. let’s be real 💀💀
Yeh Deji’s setup is insane 😂
Deji is so wannabe KSI but in reality both are irritating
As an AC Milan fan love the new kit on Danny
Wimbledon 1 : Chelsea 0!
Ethan’s an absolute idiot I can’t believe he’s a father
Lmao vikks always the first target
Vik fan for life ❤
We need new imposter roles like the arsonist
|  Hour gang here V
New sidemen videooo
Just finished the vid and it was worth it!
Oh no
sdmn among us>>>
Josh: "oh nar...oh nar................ oh nar"
I miss Harry and JJ
There’s never enough sidemen among us
fr tho, how's ellum level 64 and doesn't know not to kill on cams?
This was not the best of the bunch
WAKE UP BOYS SIDEMEN AMONG US IS BACK
Danny Aarons masterclass
Vikk hate will not be tolerated 😂
can we please make sidemen among us a weekly video instead of waiting 2 weeks😭
Man sidemen among us videos are so good could watch them for Hours 🔥
danny aarons masterclass
Sod
Sidemen among us is and always will be my guilty pleasure
Deji has the best set up in this lobby, can't change my mind
omg Ethan is so DUMB XD
I don’t blame vik at all, you all voted him, you could’ve just skipped lol
Imagine still playing this dead game 😂😂🤦🏾.
Danny Aaron’s Episode😂😂
Honestly I can’t stand with Ethan being 3rd imposter, he’s annoying asf!😂
ellum should relax. why is he going off at vizz
Aww, Ethan is having fun with his colleagues
Why does Lazar do these pointless things like buying keyboards just to break them
LETS GO!!! SIDEMEN AMONGUS VIDEOS ARE ABSOLUTELY TIMELESS.
Deji has such an *infectious positive attitood* . makes everyone more fun !
Vik is the worst sidemen
Deji is such a funny chap I absolutely love him
This over any other game they play.  Love a sidemen among us
CANT WAIT FOR THE CHARITY MATCH!
why the first round is not seems funny?
Sidemen Among Us is so iconic
Ehy is it always vik the bounty
Danny was him during this among us!
Tobi with this face cam giving JME vibes I love it
Vik the lazy fuck!, got yo back Ethan and Simon!
Vik was great in this vid
How the flying fuck does Danny Aarons think he played that well
W among us
RIP another Lazarbeam keyboard ⌨️
Danny and Deji are like the little brother no one takes seriously
vik you nonce lol jk
vik touches kids. haha
I GET SO HYPE WHEN I SEE NEW SIDEMEN AMONG US 😎😎😎, sidemen are the kings of YouTube
Lazar is such a legend in these
Can't believe Vikk would do this
22:26 this is class
DannyAarons x Lazarbeam is the best crossover ever 😭😭
Honestly it looks way more fun to just see the chaos unfold then try and work out the chaos so fair play to vik.
Those who came from TikTok, you are allowed to like this comment.
Me relising simon still has longer hair there
I wonder how many times Ethan makes up stories that are not true
Having lazarbeam on sidemen among us just does it for me😂😂
Never getting bored of Sidemen Among Us 😍
finally yall made another among us vid 😭
Danny is really really annoying
Deji is actually so smart, I just realized
The way Danny was telling josh to shut up had me rolling 😂😂😂 12:56
@19:36 - Viz said "bodies" instead of "body" - would have been cool if someone picked up on that
Ellum is so annoying he makes the video worse everytime he’s in it
Get ginge involved in these and sack Ellum off
22:53 Tobi’s utter disbelief 😂
danny aarons is so annoyiny on among us istg
The sidemen need to play the Texas chainsaw massacre it would be hilarious and it’s perfect since there’s 7 people needed for a match
when have they recorded this
😂😂😂😂😂😂 10:08  Danny: I almost don’t want to report that. Simon: this bitch Rolling on the floor 💀
Bring costumes back!
❤
Great Video
Stabby stab stab😂❤
Lately been loving these
Haven’t even watched the video and I already wanna beg for more 🔥
Vikk should off himself for offing himself in the game. Lazy indian rice picker
I honestly might stop Danny Aaron's just annoys me too much but lazar helps me enjoy the vids if lazar stops doing among us and Danny stays that's when I'll prolly stop watching
Give deji impostor..😅
Sidemen among us is the best thing on yt rn
Bro, Vikk should of just stayed out the video - he got killed every round
waiting for this one..and it came
Yaaaaay....amoooong us!!!
Tobi winning but without a facecam is hilarious
idk why they always think that someone's gonna get cooked in the comments, loyal fans love people who do nothing or give up.
Danny’s face is disrespectful
It’s crazy how sidemen videos have become so important to me that I can’t just watch them at any time. I need to plan for it, have some nice food prepared. 😂😂
Nice more content to watch less gooo
Vik can’t be bothered to even try and be entertaining anymore 😒
Yassss!!! Missed this 🥹
Thanks for creating such great content. When I'm sad, I watch these videos to make me happy! Keep up the great work Sidemen!
honestly hope they never stop playing among us
Watching Sidemen Among Us has been my daily ritual for a while, finally got a new one to watch over and over again!
This video is a Danny Aarons Masterclass.
Danny - "I'm gonna let Josh get on with the round" Danny 5 seconds later - "I saw Josh kill"  This guy man 😂
Vik mate why you duckin out the vid 😂
I wasn't having the best day, thanks Sidemen I needed this
Sidemen among us is the second best sidemen after sidemen gta.
Ive been waiting for so long..
Vik played the NPC game bro. Now that's cold.🥶🥶
#PoorFromVikkstar 😂
I LOVE UR VIDS
I feel bad for vikkstar he got killed like so many times
Danny Vs lazar is a sick rivalry
Love Danny and Lazar's relationship
When Danny saw Josh kill on cams and didn’t report the body, that was funny as hell
Ethan: Honesty is the best policy Josh: what was Honesty the next policy there Ethan: because I'm honest.   😂😂😂
Vikk being the first person the bounty hunter targets every single round 🤣
Whether he is imposter or not, they should just vote Behz out every game 😂 The chance for crewmates to win increase significantly if they do
Yessss I knew we were getting another among us today! Let’s gooo
Sidemen among us is by far the best series in the second channel
This channel is the goat
I am so happy for the past week I have been looking for a new one
Vikk man putting in no effort. First Ethan and now this. Disgraceful. 1/10 video. Sidemen fell off fr
Not the bounty hunter kill being vikk twice in a row 😂
Vik should rly try more ehhhhh
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR AN AMONGUS VID WWWWW
I guess I'm early?
Ngl worst among us vid and I watched ever one
Danny and lazar are my fav pls never do a vid without them😂
Every time I have something to eat and go on YouTube, sidemen among us always comes in clutch
Viz sold when it was him and Danny he could've just let reactor go off no one else was there with 5 seconds left.
❤
Danny saying "obserb" 9:30 in.... this dude 🤣
Vik ruining videos again 😂 i got you bez
It’s so poetic that as soon as I was about to go to sleep, a new sidemen video popped out.😂  Edit:Yeah of course I watched it
17 minutes lesgo
Josh drinking Nocco energy drinks... No prime hook up bro?
YES A SIDEMEN AMONG US
Danny "to be completely honest with you" Aaron's
Anyone here to cook Vik??
What’s wrong with tobi camera 😭?
get the beta squad. like this comment if you agree
no harry:(
Sidemen among us>>>>
LEEEEEEEEEEEESSGOOO  among us video
Whoever is playing along  josh they always get voted out 😂
I love the way that lazar rages in every single video 😂
love sidemen
Y’all the only ones keeping this game alive😢
Stop playing with Danny Aaron's he's a prick
Danny is insufferable
12:15 danny has no right to call anyone stupid when he at first never reported
It’s so funny seeing Danny get mad💀
Praise allah for the sidemen
It can’t be a sidemen among us without Ethan 3rd impostering 😂
who else thinks the sidemen are the best youtubers?
poor vik
Please never stop making these videos
Yes! Sidemen among us!
Smh can't believe that Vik just sacked it off, disgraceful, ruined the vid
Would really love to see MD in one of these again
So how long until Bez 3rd imposters this time?  2:50 not bad but not the quickest.
I have been waiting for the next sidemen among us video for ages it's finally here!
Sidemen never fails to impress
Sidemen Among Us never fails to entertain me!
3 minute game
It’s about time!! Lol
Yo where's the 1hour dudes 👇(yes I liked my own comment...)
Whats up with Vik not wanting to participate in Among Us anymore?
🔥
Danny The Autist
15 minutes in and 6k likes is crazy
Danny is a lad you’d find down the local pissed off his head
This among us is just technical issues 😂😂😂
Deji and Tobi are for real the greatest gift that keeps on giving.
vik is a stinky poo😊
It's Tobi, he was right but they still voted Deji, that's what we're here for
Never dying series
first day gang
wish the comments weren’t botted by absolute mongs
No comments about deli hairline 😂
Those who did not come from TikTok are allowed to like this comment
Bruh Ethan calling us out 😂
These are the best sidemen videos 💯💯💯💯
Vik is always the first bounty
Sidemen among us is as great as sidemen Sundays i don't care what anyone says
7 mins in thats the 1st time i have been so early
This is genuinely one of the best Sidemen series they have ever made 💯.  I could watch 100s of these videos
Made my day love these vids
did Tobi's main camera like break or get damaged?
YESSS SIDEMEN AMONG US IS BACKKKK
there was supposed to be a hurricane hitting me rn but it didn’t so now i’m watching this
thought the title said booty hunter ngl
Love coming home to watch Sidemen Among Us🔥🔥🔥🔥
Vik Josh and danny aarons need to get binned.
57 seconds in an lazar threw a keyboard ☠️
Deji calling it out first try lol
6:50 great background!
Deji needs to be on MoreSidemen more often 🤣!
U know it’s a good day when sidemen upload Among Us Videos
Sad that ksi isn’t in it
Yo! Y'all should make this a weekly thing fgs, I'm tired of not seeing Sidemen among us 😩😫😩😫😩
MoreSidemen Among us is OP
We need Pieface back
10min club   | \|/
Who's waiting for sidemen among us 👍
Yesssss finally 😭 thank you guys
watching behz try to solve it hurts my head. man screams no when deji accuses tobi even tho he didnt see tobi at all
Now this is what I call real cinema
You know.... sidemen....... I am so thankful for you all..... Every time.... I am a bit upset.... A notification comes instantly of either moresideman or sideman main channel..... Today aswell.... It's my Birthday..... And it's 12:02 now.... And i haven't actually wished for it..... I might be being too shitty about it... Still.... Atleast a single msg might not have been bad right?.... But just as I was feeling like this ..... Notification for this video came..... As if it was a gift to me...... I am sorry if I am being too soft or something...... But yeah... I am thankful to you Sideman.... It's one of the best birthday present.... I love you lot ... And hope you lot Keep doing well in life as well......Keep going up man✊🏼✊🏼✊🏼✊🏼✊🏼
Never fails to entertain us ❤
Sidemen amongus is the way
Vikstar Yellow card
More 0 IQ Among us gameplay
Danny Aarons Lowkey the best imposter in these vids
I honestly thought Behz would say he is the impostor instead of Deji when he mentioned that Vik sacrifices himself when he is an impostor with a ‘stupid’ person
Love the among us videos ❤️
they saying were gonna hate on vik in comments, hell nah were not😂
Best series ever as well as gartic phone
When's the next ExtraMoreSidemen video coming out, lads?
Imagine this role with chaos mode
I just hate when tobi gives up when he is imposter....he throws his teammate under the bus...
So Deji is a Sidemen?
Grrrr Vikkstar 😡
I love this series
Ellum had an absolute stinker 😂
9 minutes late gang
Has a ton noticed that the sidemen are actually falling apart
never click a video faster than a sidemen among us
Calling a Behz third imposter
Obsessed with Deji’s kitchen set up
Favourite series
Send me some money fam
It’s a good day when sidemen post a among us vid
Simon and Ethan should just rise above the comments - no need to make every video about Wheel of Fortune and the comments.
VIKKSTAR123 ALWAYS FAILS TO DISAPPOINT 🔥🔥🔥
Love the mando
The irony of Vikk being in the thumbnail but not being concerned in the real game
Yo it came out 8 minutes ago
angryginge on this would be class
Yo big fan
Deji is always fun to watch
among us without harry and ksi just doesn't hit the same
make a weekly sidemen among us please it makes me erect every time
we love sidemen among us !
I approve of Boba Fett in the thumbnail
Honestly the laziness is taking over for vikk 😡! It’s like he can’t even be bothered for these videos anymore
It’s been so long god did
Deji just makes the videos so much funnier
Love sidemen among us way more than GTA and the one off Mario kart series
Tobi is so cringe and has the deadest banter I’ve ever seen. His lucky to be in the sidemen cuz if it weren’t. For it he would not have made it as YouTuber. Lmao
THEY voted vikk out abd then complained about him not wanting to play.😭
get angry ginge in sidemen among us
Use This As A: PLEASE MORE SIDEMEN AMONG US Button 🔴🔥
Siuuuuuuuuuuu
Deji really replaced JJ even on the thumbnail. 🔥😭
Sidemen never fail to make my balls twitch
Can't blame vik for not wanting to put up with the lobby especially with Simon bossing everyone around💀💀
The way id sit here all day watching sidemen play among us 😂
when behz is telling his theory at 2:50. then deji replied "that doesnt make sense"  and ellum also said something related. its almost like they could hear what behz was saying and now im confused
Can't lie, we were actually missing the Among Us videos
Please.upload more sidemen among us pleeease❤❤❤
My brain is simple: I see sidemen among us, I click
I predict 6.7 million views
Chipfat you legend !! Fun video as always
6 mins ago 25k views
When there's a sidemen among us video I'm happy
Since y’all love among us so much you might as well get everybody on here and do Among us in real life again
Les go
via carried the video
Ethan was definitely not cooking at all this video 🔥🔥🔥
Im here before the bots
Never been this early
Vikstarrrr
Danny: That was a good uh oh, that’s gonna make them trust me.  Simon: It’s Danny
Fucking love deji makes me piss😂
Tobi is so annoying... Why does he keep playing if he just tells the others to vote him out everytime anyone suspects him of anything?
"I got tobi, idk how to feel about that" danny is kind of sus
Innit
Sidemen comment hack: Write a BS sentence and end it with (wholesome) to gain likes
but they voted vikk, that on them
I genuinely get happy when the sidemen upload. It's a treat!
Not first.
lol
I hate Simon minter cuz he thinks he’s smarter than he actually is
RELEASE THESE MORE OFTEN
WE WANT MORE
