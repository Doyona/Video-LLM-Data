Everyone’s talking about Regina’s first catch, but no one’s talking about Gabe’s insane catch at 14:58. Bobby is right, Gabe is HIM. And who else to make a crazy catch like that.
Y’all should play more games on this field

WOW, I can remember back when Gabe was a little boy too. Lil` Kersh and Javy as well. All of them were just little kids when I first subscribed. Now those kids are young men, and Lumpy is quickly becoming a exceptional baseball player! ⚾️ EVERY SINGLE ONE of these young guys and gals have grown into really wonderful and talented men and women. They had some really great role models to look up to. Benny is an amazing Dad, and the fact you are all such a close knit group, shows exactly why all of these kids have become exceptional young adults. Bobby you have to be one of the most selfless, giving, and caring people I've ever seen. You are all extremely lucky to have so many incredible friendships and close relationships with each other. This has been a wonderful journey to watch all of the younger kids grow up and see all of the rest of you men and women also grow as well. From 🥎Softball🥎 to ⚾️Baseball⚾️, from 🏉Football🏈 to ⚽️kickball⚽️, finally to🏀Grassketball🏀. Every game, every competition, and award ceremony has been incredibly fun to be a part of. But again the absolute best part is seeing how these young men and women have grown into young adults and have become great men and women, oh AND very talented ballplayers!  Easily a top 5 all-time channel on You Tube!  EVER!
Maxx
Regina is coming into her own. She had a couple of RBI hits last year, and now her first catch! The way you give props to everyone shows that you are ALL WINNERS and exceptional people and players. It's moments like these that got me to subscribe and kept me coming back for the last five or six years. Great sportsmanship and awesome role models for kids watching! Congrats to Regina and to ALL OF YOU for being some of the premier entertainment channels on You Tube! 👍👍👍👍👍 God Bless you all and take care of yourselves and each other!

Dear Bobby,  I just came across your YouTube channel and I have to say, I'm thoroughly impressed with the amount of hard work and dedication you put into your softball games. Your skills on the field are truly remarkable, and it's evident that you have a true passion for the game.  As someone who's also a fan of softball, I appreciate the effort you put into creating and sharing your content. Your videos are not only entertaining, but they also provide a great source of inspiration for those of us who aspire to improve our own skills on the field.  One thing I particularly love about your videos is that they showcase the importance of teamwork and sportsmanship. It's clear that you and your teammates share a special bond, and it's truly a joy to watch you all work together to achieve your goals.  Overall, I just want to extend my thanks to you for sharing your love of softball with the world. You truly exemplify what it means to be a dedicated and passionate athlete. Keep up   Instagram is lil_orange_14

@nicorobledo3 Bobby you’ve inspired to play baseball and continue playing over the years. Ever since my grandfather passed away back in 2017 I stopped playing and following it because he used to always take me to games with him and just the thought of baseball just made me go back to the time I was with him and a dark place in my life. Just wanted to say thank you Bobby and the whole softball crew. Keep it up with the amazing videos❤️‍🔥
@crilleyjustin  Thanks for being awesome keep up the great vids

@a.Brookie_0 …. In Oct of 2020 I was in a near fatal car accident that had to be bedridden for over a year. Before the accident my professional career and my family took up all of my time and I barely ever watched anything on YouTube other than how to videos for repairing cars which is what I did professionally. After my accident I had tons of time to kill and my kids recommended that I find some YouTube channels with content that I would enjoy this was one of the first that I found and I bet I’ve watched every single video you’ve ever made at least twice, some 10 to 15 times, like the championships and All-Star games. Thank you for helping me get through some tough times and keep making a great content, love everybody involved with dodgerfilms!
