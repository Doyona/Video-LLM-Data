Go on Kalvin! 🇬🇧👍
BK
Congratulations 👏🏽
I’m not a Leeds fan/ supporter but I LOVE this guy he is so calm and plays great football. It’s coming home. Congrats Kalvin
Who actually dislikes this man
Interviewer is soooo annoying - just want him to stop talking
Your Girlfriend and your agent are quite close??? That agent better be female.....🤣🤣🤣
Made a solid start to his prem career with Leeds so I’d say it’s a deserved call up👏🏾👏🏾
MOT
If he keeps on working on his game I can see a big club like Manchester United signing him!
He's so precious!
I am a leeds fan from Mauritius. Kalvin joins great leeds players like j  Chalton, Hunter,  Clarke, Madeley, cherry, n so many others for England.
SO BRILLIANT FOR YOU KALVIN CONGRATULATIONS  M O T . CRAIG  :  )  :  )  :  )
Miniminter would be proud for him
HE'S MAGIC, YOU KNOOOOOWWWW PHILLIPS THE YORKSHIRE PIRLOOOOO
Enhorabuena campeón! Cada dia mas grande Kalvin!!!!
No offense to this guy,  but where’s Craig Mitch? 👀
Waiting for the Conor Coady’s first impression
Where’s Craig?
Absolutely buzzing for him, everyone in Leeds is proud of you lad. He's magic
‘ My agent and my girlfriend are quite close ’  Ah poor lad
Sort your hair out. No need for that awful trim
Is it just me or does he look like Harvey Elliot?
Yorkshire Pirlo. All the best, MOT
he deserves, but he’s gonna have a tough competition on the position.. all the best to him.
Asking him about training. I bet England training is like a day off compared to Bielsa's brutal sessions
United will end up buying him in the future, like how we bought their star players always before 😂🤷‍♂️
Yet another YORKSHIREMAN in the England squad...M.O.T!!!
LETS GOOO TIMBSYYYY!!!
Kalvin  🇯🇲
He deserves the call up :) play so well for leeds last season and do it agun this season :) fresh for comming games :) 🙃😊
NIce interview by timbsy
Congrats
I’ve not even watching too much of him. But coached my bielsa? Baller.
All you armchair wankers thinking you know better than Southgate because you've played a bit of footie manager😂 get a grip
wrong spelling mate
Young fella looks like hes about to explode with pride. Well done kid
His girlfriend and his agent are quite close...Well thats interesting 👀
I wonder how many players have been called up to the England team before they have played a premiere league game 🤔
Cut ya hair
Tbh was anti Phillips when he first got the call up for the reason he’s only played championship level at the moment. However, seems a smiley great young lad all the best to him 🦁 ❤️
#ALAW! The yorkshire pirlo deserved it!
You lot should get filly on here
👽👽👽https://youtu.be/Tl-Wou65yYQ
Bring back craig mitch
We love you Kalvin ❤️
PHILLIPS THE YORKSHIRE PIRLO HES MAGIC YOU KNOWWWWWWW
Local lad to us in Leeds, everyone is so proud of the lad and most of us have never even met him 😂
He could of played for Jamaica
Congratulations Kalvin
I think he should sign for a bigger club🙂
Scraping the bottom of the barrel picking him
I love your videos!!!  Please see on YouTube 'Mini Melon' https://youtu.be/IrFbpx1b484 Thank you for your time
🟡🔵🟡🔵
He’s magic you know, Phillips the yorkshire Pirlo⚽️ #Lufc
congrats Kalvin
A little controversial after seeing all the comments below, but has southgate lost his mind, we are now selecting players who have never played in a top league before, but now we find him in the england setup, I cant imagine what all the english players who have cvast experience in the prem league but get a sniff in the national team, must be thinking. CRAZY, I'm supporting Germany in the next tournament,
Have to give credit to marcelo.
Literally to  the 1% people who’s reading... I strongly hope your parents live longer than 100 years with awesome health thanks for📖
He seems to be such a nice and humble lad. Really happy for him! He deserves this👏🏼
his chest is MASSIVE
GEEEEEEEET ON KALVIN LAD
GOAT
Is that miniminter???
Interviewer looks like Miniminter 👀
PHILLIPS THE YORKSHIRE PIRLO HES MAGIC YANO 💙💛💙💛
Why does the interviewer look and sound like miniminter 😂
Well done kalvin from a Huddersfield fan
Is he mixed race??
Great lad, down to earth and fully deserves his England Cap.  Take it in Kalvin and enjoy it, these memories will last a life time.  #alaw #mot
Once he’s in England squad he would be out
So proud of you Kalvin. One of the nicest people to grace this Earth. Go and show everybody in the World what you're made of and do Leeds proud!
Can’t stand that blonde guy interviewing him
Congrats, Yorkshire Pirlo (even though im a united fan) but still congrats
Speaking as a man united fan he’s a great player and he deserves to be in the England squad well done Kalvin!
Where him and Harvey Elliot separated at birth or something
To be Honest i like Timbsy better than craig mitch as england presenter
Stand up if you hate Man U
Could have struggled with Villa last season but stayed loyal to his home town club. Rewarded, especially as Leeds now buy Rodrigo etc.
Check miniminter
Kieran trippier is not a yorkshireman! He's from Bury
Well deserved I only know him from fifa 😂but I’m sure he will do very well seems humble
Big up Timbsy !!!
Great interview from miniminter
There he is, our Yorkshire Pirlo! Doing us proud both on and off the field. Congrats Kalvin, now go show them what you’re all about! MOT
well done Kalvin you deserve it!!!!!!!!!!
Congratulations Kalvin.
He’s magic you knowwww Phillips the Yorkshire Pirlo. Hope he proves himself he deserves a call up
Humble guy with the biggest smile.   All the best young man
For the people wondering why he was called up without kicking a prem ball and Grealish initially was not (it’s very simple):  England have been crying out for a deep lying playmaker, Phillips fits that mould and is tough competition for Dier, Winks and Rice. Grealish on the other hand is more attacking, his competition is Sterling, Alli, Henderson, Foden, Ox to name a few....that’s why Phillips was called up before, he’s needed.
Leeds Leeds Leeds
HES MAGIC YOU KNOW PHILLIPS THE YORKSHIRE PIRLO 💛💙
So proud of you kalvin 💛💙
"My agent and my girlfriend are quite close" Hopefully not too close😂😂😂
bring back craig
If he doesn’t get played over dier we’re doomed
0:55 who's jack???
Great player and looks like a humble lads. Shame he played for a pathetic club at the moment. Go get a transfer to Everton/Villa/Spurs or any other better team than that disgusting Leeds.  -Man united fans
Southgate : Grealish doesn't have prem experience yet. Also Southgate: selects someone from the championship            Manager philosophy 101
Seems to be a nice bloke really humbled and chuffed for being in there big up on him 👏🏿
Shouldn't be in the squad, should've proved himself in the prem first before he got called up.
He’s gonna be that pit bull playing deep in that no.6 role with his pace and amazing long ball ability.
Where jessie lingard
big up man like kalvin phillips!! yorkshire pirlo buzzing for the lad
who’s eddie?
This guy looks like Harvey Elliot 🤔
mano eu sou brasileiro mas eu sou muito fa dos videos de goalkeeper
Bit of a downgrade from bielsa to Southgate but still go on lad Kalvin
is he biracial?
For a second I thought he signed for palace
To see all the teams players in all of Europe to go back to their countries. Seems surreal especially in todays world. I'm looking forward to this competition
I love this guy fam, I’ve had him on the back of my shirt for the past 3 seasons and he’s never let me down, He’s one of our own
Yorkshire Pirlo 💙💛
#mot 💛💙💛💙💛💙
He’s magic
I can’t believe as a Leeds fan  watching a Leeds player in the England team for the first time in my life, congrats Kalvin you deserve it mate.
Coming from a Liverpool fan, I’m so happy this man got the call up.
Congratulations Kalvin, well deserved bro
Absolute legend. MOT

He’s a decent lad hopefully he does well in the prem
3:07 oh no I know what’s gonna happen when he’s playing and not at home
Even as a united fan I respect this lad a lot class player even though he plays for Leeds
Humble and down to earth. Hard not to like this lad.
Not a Leeds fan but this kid is class. I hope he can replicate his leeds form for england
Looks like a very humble and down-to-earth bloke. Looking forward to watching him play.
best player to come out of yorkshire
Congratulations Kalvin!! Marching On Together!

What happened to Craig Mitch ?
Last time he did something like this, it was with his boyfriend Ben White
This England team literally changes like the weather.
Saw this guy when he arrived at camp with his mask and was so confused. 😂 Literally was lost.
Let's go England
Lovely to see him
Love your vids keep up the cracking work
