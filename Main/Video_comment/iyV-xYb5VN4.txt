who's watching crown jewel 2024 now?
I hated this crowd especially for the women’s mathces
I went there it was lit
3:48 Rhea looks like Hela from Thor Ragnarok but with short hair
This bloodline wins completely due to interference
11:01 왼쪽에 있는 분은 누구인가요?
These refs need to learn how to slow count the finish like Earl used to do
Cool, merci.
nice to see wrestlers male/female  wearing long pants rather than just underwear/short pants
Arab crowd is so lame dawg they gotta stop doing shows here jesus christ 🥱
Free palestine 🇵🇸
This year’s WWE Crown Jewel official theme song will be Bad Wolves Legends never die

JD's superkick selling is gold
Roman the GOAT
Judgment Day(including Edge,Drew M)and bloodlinevs LA knight,Aj styles,John cena,Logan Paul,Seth freakin Rollins,Chody Rhodes,Joey uso,andRey MYSTERIO in WAR GAMESSSSSS!!!!!!
A disappointing Show The worst Crown Jewel show in history, because of TKO 👎👎👎👎👎

Sasha Banks should have to come back.Sasha banks 💙💙💙💙
Cena chokeslam😂😂😂 ummmm noo. More like cena rock bottom
Do you notice anything? How beautifully well-behaved and fully dressed the women are.... haha. :D
Love when WWE does Crown Jewel and all the women have to wear jumpsuits.  Can't wait till next year when they're wearing burkas/hijabs.
please try to put results footges also..❤❤
So if u don't like Roman go sleep
Here's the biggest issue with Roman reigns every match as a heal every match that he's done for the past two and a half years is every time The opponent almost wins somebody has to interfere it's getting really old That's why I stopped watching after WrestleMania.
1:54 great acting
Come on let's see Some Gold 🪙 on Drew McIntyre. And Damien Priest
Don't worry I will watch ur highlights ok ur excellency Majesty undertaker❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤mc Donald❤

Editing so bad way m not see wo will win😢😢😢
So pathetic that the women have to dress like cosplay superheroes….
I will give you your video by translating it in Hindi and whatever it will take 50-50
roman reigns the most boring person ever
Ahlen wa sehlan . Marhaba. 🎉
Logan Paul  don't deserve the championship he cheated  he did play fair  this is sooo stupid  they need to disqualifie him
Where ronaldo
Shame on Roman reigns and empire and all management always cheating why match Roman just telling you win without fight
LA Knight proved he belongs in the main event. He put on a great match. Him losing was known, but its so awesome to see how far he's made it. YEAH
People don’t get me wrong but let’s all be real it’s time we all see Roman fight on his own without the bloodline jumping in it . Because to me every time someone gets the best of Roman his cousin jumped in it . I don’t consider Roman a winner and I don’t consider him for holding that title long as he claims because he never fight on his own without his cousin help . It’s time to remove the title from Roman he’s a waste of time who can’t fight on his own .to me his a Loser
13:30 lmao 😂😂
What a disgrace to the United States title!
Job well done both LA KNIGHT  ROMAN REIGNS
This crowd was dead
4:10
Am I the only one who is thinking that wwe is getting worst day by day 😭😔😢
I didn't realize how much hair Cena is losing on top. Holy hell.
Wwe is working as establishment of Pakistan.... Just 1 family
Kairi 🥰😍
Imo Drew should have won so seth could heal his injury and be back in time for WM i would love to see a triple threat between drew McIntyre Seth rollins and La Knight (not being bias)
VAR would completely change the WWE world. Haha
He had to.   Cheat just to get the belt
free palastine 🥰
Always winning by cheating ROMAN REIGNS
So tired of the predictability here, Judgement Day, Bloodline, Damage Control, you can always predict there will be interference if it looks like their member is about to lose.
Sounds like Paul was lucky to get out of the country...
LA night former impact world heavyweight champion , so please give opportunities and become a new WWE champion
Drewmcintyre toughest player, please give world title opportunities  WWE management deceive McIntyre
Roman when will lose?? Very boring WWE management change the Story line, many wrestler waiting for opportunities,, I one thing forget it I tell you something  what are  the reason John Cena continues lose the match  he is the toppest wrestler  why WWE  .....
Roman has no balls to win any of his championship match without help, Paper Champ 😂😅
Again bloodline intrupt come on roman you are my favorite please win matches yourself I am big fan of you❤
Gente boba q cree en eso
I'm honestly sick of Roman kicking ou a the last second when will he lose the title
Zaatu roman and his brothers
Logan paul wins ❤
Out Of All The Superstars That Showed Improvement Through The Years Drew McIntyre
It's sad how the women can't show even a tiny bit of skin because it's Saudi Arabia and a 99.9% male crowd.
☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻
Roman rigns iz fail all games
Crown Jewel PLE 2023 was a very average show.
Roman Reigns is too much Falls winner,,, Bulshit
Tooo much tired of Watching Roman winning with cheating again & again... really worst.... No interest left now....
Scripted 😢
Never thought I'll see cena perform a choke-slam 😂
Stop roman title winning its getting boring, how long he will retained his title cowardly taking bloodline help.
Love from India 🇮🇳♥️
Why is Roman the longest champ.... so disrespectful to the greats who went it alone ... solo beating cena ... with his thumb!?!? Wow bring back attitude era .. this 1 is lame as
Logan Paul is a cheat
Romen is nothing without help of brothers these days
Wwe is a business and reigns has the it factor right now. Whatever you call it but as a business he has the look that crosses alot of different cultures at the moment. India,China and the Middle East. The U.S.  market is just a portion of that market now since they merged so until they know 100 percent Knight can cross over then it ain't going to happen but may e later when knight loses that gimmick and becomes badass like a stone cold 2.0.  He has it all .
Lmao john cena chokeslam😆😆
Punk & Cody gonna be the final 2 in the Royal Rumble 2024, both go over the top rope together and hit the floor at the same time, Setting up Punk vs Cody vs Roman at Wrestlemania 2024 for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship.  Sorry Cody, Punk pins Roman clean.
Crowd was dead
So the POS that laughed at a suicide body in Japan just won a title "representing" the US. As a Marine Corps Veteran you've lost a fan
Anyone else sick of Roman never defending in a fair match
So happy to see roman defend!! Am practising for 20 years time 😴😴😴
LA knight is win undisputed Campion.... Roman Reigns Big cheater All tym 👎👎👎👎
Ganaron entre dos otra  vz como siempre roman con sus trampas
Highlights that don't show the end of the match,awesome
without brock lesnar wwe is nothing
Gave Romen Down He Was Thif
Seth Rollin is really an architect 👍..but honestly, I don't like his new fancy world😅
Let roman reigns go up against Ilja dragunov from nxt how going to win
It's so funny that liberty supporter USA forces their girls to cover head to toe under money pressure 😂😂
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
☝️
I’m begging you to please stop and make someone else the champion. It’s turned into an absolute snore fest
OMG WWE has become so predictable..... 😂😂😂
Roman Reigns is cheap cheater
Kya madrachod banaa hai dikhao to sahi diko
Not highlights if we miss The pinfall
Yes yes 💜💜💜💜💜
This audience is dead
Saudi Arabia really did a good job organizing such a big event, would love to see MORE of them
I don't know why people even bother to watch anymore it's going to be the same thing every single time reigns is never going to lose
Roman reigns is now Chief tribal cheater, and it is becoming his legacy for the futures...One of the stupid idiot cheater wrestler of the world. Shame on you Roman Mr. Joe... Feeeeeeeeee.....
I promised to myself that I will never ever watch wwe what if Roman Reigns loss his tiltle but it’s not happen like that and I was damn excited and happy☺️
I was there 🎉
😅😅😅😅😂😂😂somone  aur cena over actiong
It is not even funny, it is sad that wrestling ladies were dressed like divers/frogmen. Ok, there are some rules in S. Arabia, so follow them also here in Europe when visiting our countries. No need to look (women) like potato sack etc.
Worst crown jewel
Dont upload highlights rather than uploading it like this
I hate you wwe 😂😂😂😂😂 cena
kairi sane🤩
Why idiot fans are even interested in seeing Reigns vs anyone at all?😆 This thing has became way way too repetitive even for themselves as well...
WHY ON EARTH would they make Zayn share the ring with an “Alleged” Abuser
It's 2 vs 1 for undisputed championship. It is not fair
La knight got buried, and although heartfelt it was so predictable because anyone who faces Roman regardless of popularity gets buried at the end. If he ain't defending that title consistently like Seth is then they need to put it on someone like knight or Cody. But even now if they put the belt on Cody the sad part is that it won't be as good as it would have been in last year's WrestleMania when he was red hot. He won't get the pop that they looking for or at least what they're expecting to because they waited to long. Better Priest even at this point than reigns because he's at least there every week.
This event was very poor compared to the last one which had Rollins defeat Nakamura. I guess to me it never recovered after Cena's beat down. They should have let him retire with a convincing win not the other way around.
Roman Reigns looking like a jobber Wwe sucks
For a guy who's seeing WWE for > 35 yrs, 2023 folks copy: Superkick from HBK, Samoan drops, Kevin owens copy Stone Cold stunner, new folks copy Rock's People's elbow, Seth copy Triple H's Pedigree, Cena repeating the same 2 moves once a year. Is anything even Original anymore, other than few originals like Roman, Rey etc ?
What kind of this class highlights is this not even showing the winning moment?! 😅
Band baja baraat
I've just come across this page and I had a wee laugh to myself,  you guys actually believe this is true lol
Hello everyone
Really enjoyed this event after ages.
Yrs
Glad y’all showed the winner of each match thnaks wwe
Feeling sad for Cena 😢
0:02 Sami Zayn VS JD McDonugh (Kickoff Show) 1:03 Drew McIntyre VS Seth Rollins 2:06 Damián Priest tries to cash his MITB (2:38 Sami Zayn stealls the briefcase) 3:00 Rhea confronts Drew 3:19 Nia Jax VS Shayna Baszler VS Zoey Stark VS Raquel Rodriguez VS Rhea Ripley 4:10 Solo Sikoa VS John Cena (The G.O.A.T) 5:42 Grayson Waller & Miz Fight about what show is better than Ibrahim All Hajjah 7:39 Logan Paul Big Entrance 8:39 Logan Paul VS Rey Mysterio 9:38 Bianca Belair VS Iyo Sky (9:49 Kairi Sane return) 11:16 Damián Priest VS Cody Rhodes 12:09 L.A Knight VS Román Reigns
Damn that looked good😂
❤
WE WANT A CHANGE IN THE UNDISPUTED CHAMPIONSHIP THINGY, BECAME SO PREDICTABLE NOW. LET THIS REIGNS' ERA BE OVER
After seeing this I remember why I quit watching WWE.
Cool vid
Why john cina why wwe stop this
Does Roman Reigns ever have a match where his cousins don’t get involved?
Wrestling is boring now
I hate how WWE is making Roman look weak, like he needs help in every single match to win, Roman used to be almost invincible before tribal chief Era
I love Roman reigns but nowadays it's becoming boring  ,all the time he has to cheat to win and then I think there are other superstars who are better even than him,,,nowadays it's Soo predictable ,,we obviously know when Roman defends the championship the bloodline must interfere,,,,I miss the old Roman who fought for his titles and earned them fairly  nowadays I think he is a cheat,,,
WWE yawl on some BS for that disrespect on Belair.
cena balding
Well! Here we go again! Still gotta put up with Roman Reigns. It's time for him to go! He lost! But i guess its ok to keep this goin. It's really getting old!😠
Good set, good matches, bad booking. No one likes Roman Reigns anymore, it's getting old & boring. Gunther is better at his job & how he defends his title at least once a month or so, compared to once every 4 months. Vince, Reigns, and Lesnar are all buTt buddies lol.
Is it just me or is anyone else bored with seeing Roman Reigns still winning the matches
Roman can’t win his own
WWE still clinging to Romans johnson I see!!! Welp, guess it will be a lil while longer before I can watch wwe again!! The character, the storyline, the entire thing was fire!!! like a year and a half ago!!!
my tribal chief wins again.  Flawless victory.  Acknowledge him!!!
Roman is Pathetic . How long are people gonna tolerate his below average showings?
Booking average tag team guys better than the Prince devitt
survivor series she's better when she's been like that champion vs champion raw vs SmackDown
There cheating in WWE is too much especially this crown jewel i did not enjoy it
wwe is f...kng annoying😡. now it's even getting worse. soccer is far more better because it's a fair game
Roman a cheater i don't like him anymore he is boring yooh aaa..  LA  Knight Yea! ❤
Love the way the women in the matches are covered to respect a muslim country.
Yea. I done with WWE.  Longan Paul -no thanks. LA Knight will be wasted. Drew - wasted. Romans a joke.
المهلكة في عهد ابن سلمان
Scripted hoti h sab
Tell me why Logan Paul actually won😮
Hahahahah the craziest thing I’ve ever seen is the ability to allow Roman to have so much help and it not even be brought up within league rule officials lmfaoooo
Bring back vince
HHH SUCKS
i knew it that logan paul would use his brass nuckles to win the title
Wwe now become joke
Now wwe uploading highlights events its means TRP getting Zero 😅
The worst pay per view outing in years . This one was a joke
This Roman Reigns and his cousins ​​have made me hate wrestling. Every match is interference. They have made wrestling useless now. And they don't even win Money in the Bank. Nonsense wrestling.
1:32 chk in 0.25x speed 😂😂How fake wwe
Hr
Bloodline bs is played out time to move those belts on too bigger and better ppl
John Cena has more moves than tribal chief at this age I would rather John Cena defend the title Roman Reigns is boring now LA Knight should have won.
This is really bad editing. Someone needs to be fired
They kill that John Cena what meaning of being a legend if you lose again and again and specially like that 😢 that Goat term doesn't suits you anymore cena 🙏
You know what people are fed up with the outside interference and we know its just an excuse to have someone keep the titles. When is it ever gonna stop so the belt can change hands all The time? Its more exciting to watch when different people hold the belt but you idiots keep it with the same person far to long.
King. Roman regains😮
Roman reigns is sooooo corny 💯💯💯y is he still pushed
Bloodline aur judgement day dono likely same hai because dono hi cheating karke match win karti hai
My favourite derw mcintyre Seth Rollins sami Zayn ❤️❤️
I think the stunner and pedigree should be retired only to be used by the ones who made it famous..y can’t they come up with they own moves
Sorry another thing please sign Will Osprea 😂
Byron Saxton missed his true calling. He was a great ring announcer during this PLE.
And please bring Punker back........YEAAA
This Roman title Run is so boring, tiresome and predictable, same finish as summerslam. This isn't like a good heel response where I like to hate him, this is I hate how predictable and repetitive this  is especially since he works once every three months. This is beyond boring at this point, rushed story line to just kill the fan favorites momentum. Its obsurd, I really don't understand what the writers are thinking anymore. Why wouldn't LA Knight win the US or IC belt before going up against Reigns. Really build up the story and make people at least believe he had a chance. Nobody thought he was gonna win the match at all that's how repetitive and predictable this title run has become. If he passes Hogans run this will be a complete travesty and remebered for all the wrong reasons. Its not Romans fault its the writers fault. I spent a decent penny on Wrestlemania tickets and I have to say I'm starting to be concerned about how lame it will be and I have been to 2 other Wrestlemanias and I was super pumped. This is ridiculous at least change the way he wins a match or here's a thought have him win straight up like Solo did. Romans not even the toughest member of Bloodline. I don't ever comment on things but this has become mind numbing.
Roman is ziro 😂😂😂
Reigns, Jimmy, Solo, Dom, Finn, JD, Priest are nothing but a bunch of sissy babies, nothing but a bunch of kids. Acknowledged
And LA knight Title match vs Reigns  ending Reigns Streak and Title holder  at Survivors series
See you next year, trimonthly chief :/
SOMEONE TELL ME WHY THESE HIGHLIGHTS NEVEER SHOW THE PINFALL?????
It's not survivor's series. It's The  Shield vs Judgement and Bloodline   Seth Drew Samy Jey and Cody vs Solo Roman Jimmy And Finn Priest
☝️
Sami said YOOOOOINKKK
I am not watching any Roman Reigns match until I hear the news of his loss.
It's time for the WWE Universe to go  All Elite.
The worse booked event
If Roman suppose to never lose, why you execute title matches?! SAME SENARIO EVERY TIME. There is always Uso or Solo helps roman. Seriously, WHYYYYY?!
Romom right
This is the worst show
Part timer & a no show Boreman Ruins retains again! Woohoo... Let's give this part timer no show talent another 1000 more days to hold the title and also to dethrone Hulk Hogan! Sounds like a great idea from the creative team! At least Rollins put up an awesome match against McIntyre. Rollins is a real true fighting champion unlike Boreman Ruins who only defended his title about 3 times out of the 1000+ days.
Free Palestine ✊
Worst continues regarding RR .. without support he can't retain the champion ship.. Still boring..
Roman 👎👎👎 ,LAk knight 💪💪💪
Are female fans not allowed to go to these events in Saudi Arabia? Serious question.
Why over push to Roman. Shamed wwe 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
WWE crown jewel🎉
BC pura scripted rahta hai 😂😂😂😂
I was hoping Dominik would come out and celebrate with Logan Paul. That would create so much heat lol
Worst crown jewel ever. .
Kairi ❤
Please tell me wtf is the point of boasting about doing things no one else has ever done & being the goat if you can never win a singles match without your family intervening?? How many times has it been now LOL ok buddy
If romain is not in wwe I will never watch wwe
Romain please broke the hulkhogon record
Dear WWE, I think we are ready for something to change. I hope it comes at Survivor Series.
Fast start var With iran fast please not late
Cena shouldn't have put Solo Over...
JD felt really well Jey's kick. Tbh i dont understand why do we need fake champs like Logan Paul...this is the only thing i dislike on WWE this days.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ love my family
LA knight get the 3 count. jimmy uso is late.
Whoever was in charge of the camera cuts/angles was not KD. The whole night just seemed off. Like a step behind
Sad thing is John Cena becoming old😢....but he was legend❤
🎉
Just shame on you Stupid Roman Reigns
Logan Paul's entrance is an international version of John Cena's WrestleMania entrance.
Roman king
Roman Reigns one match❤>>>>>LA knight whole carrier
Roman ki itni bejjati Abhi tak nhi hui
I hate incomplete stories. Bait?
amazing Roma RIGNS ❤❤🎉
La knight is the real champion, like the Rock👍
Bored shorts fight with wwe 🥱
John Cena ❤
Y’all Saab were la knight almost botched the spear through the barricade by almost breaking it before it was time 😂
In Crown Jewel, again Roman proves he can't win any single match with out bloodline help. Funny Roman 🤣🤣🤣
😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Jey uso strong
I told u la
Oooohhh I hate to see why Drew lost?!
Making winner to solo sikao is the worst idea  of WWE ever made. He is John Cena and the goat of wwe. Someone like sikao cannot deafet John Cena it's redicules. From now on I will never watch WWE forever. Same on far  the whole team of WWE.
Mami bail me out
Mami always best
Wwe is so irritating nowadays one champion holding a champion for years and years..boring...in the previous years there used to be a title changes every afer 2-3 months...
Bravo Mr. Ceena. U did it better. U shld have followed it wid some other move instantly to ensure ur victory.😬
Good card but boring outcomes
Can't seel legend like John Cena loss against small solo.wwe going to worst level
Seriously? You're that Stvpid? Damian Priest as World Champ with & JD is a complete copy & of Roman Reigns with Bloodline. You must be joking. Go ahead. See how much fan base you lose to AEW, NJ, AAA, & Impact. You are dmr than a sack of rocks. AEW sucks & TK is too stupid to know that's not about who you have, but what you do with them, but AEW is about to win their imaginary war by default.
ROMAN is a CHAMPION who CANNOT WIN BY HIMSELF! HAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Go to AEW guys!
So roman cant win by himself now? One of the worst crown jewels in history off wwe   We want some new champs LA Knight becoming a champion+cash in for priest losing to coddy what hell of a drama would have that been
John cena 😢😢😢
Miss the old wwe 😢
WWE, a CHARADE.
Everything in this show was cringe , specially the KSA fan
Wwe is terribly a former shell of what it used to be.  No longer having shows in the united states.  Lying about beating aew.  I have never seen a more delusional company than wwe.  Too bad vince mcmahon sold the company to shareholders already.
Why Arab... your brother is suffering there, but you can still have fun with all kinds of shows
All scripted
Femal wrestlers wearing those latex suits is so fkn weird man
The worst show I've ever seen. HHH has no respect of living legend. John cena is the greatest of all time and he sacrificed a lot for WWE. solo sikoa?? Did he really win? You're trying to force him into a monster gimmick.. I'm so disappointed. 정말 최악의 쇼였고 로만은 여전히 최악이었다.. 이 회사는 정말 존중심을 보여야할 선수에게 최악의 행동을 보여줬다
We stop watching WWE because Roman Reigns never loses as it is completely scripted
La knight lost cause I believe the Logan Paul and la knight fued will resume and that's where la knight will become us champion before becoming a world champion
Cena fans-like
99% knows l a knight will loss😅
11:43 that sold 🥵
Kids an adults around the world 🌎 👊🏿yeeeaah
Win for Tribal chief Hah 💯
LA Knight deserve the gold
Even though its script the moves  are getting better 😮
I hate WWE cz of this cheater Roman Reigns
Drew should've won 🏆
Drew needed this win for sure!
😁
Now WWE Is Very Worst
Roman reigns story is day by day going to be worst, starting is shocking,  in the middle is it unbeatable, and ending is worst 😢
Roman cheater
ROMAN REIGNS ☝️🔥💯
All the judgements  day is very bad
Logan is too good…
عرض فاشل
WWE getting boring nowadays AEW delivered real wrestling
Is John Cena going bald
GOOD DRAMA, NOT WRESTLINGS❗ 🙏  🤠 🇵🇰  🥊❗(06-11-2023)❗
Unsatisfactory scenario For all John fans Cena... always wins Roman Reigns cheated You are deceiving lovers Wrestling. We have become We hate wrestling 💔
Kayre sein 0+0=0👎🖕🔏

So happy for Bianca 😊
Wwe sucks 😡 Cena lost to this piece of dung solo sikoa how the hell  La lost to reings again due to help  Common we are tired of this
Cena chokeslams Solo very quick 😮🔥
Waste and worst experience
There are far better wrestlers than SOLO SIKOA, That product of Nepotism is not a better wrestler, nor has the physique, and charisma is also void, NXT has so many bright prospects but they are not given a chance as they are not Samoan and this Pokamon looking stiff ahh mf gets to beat Cena, I'll stop watching wwe if he gets in the main event, and wrestlers like, BRON, ILJA, DIJAK, MELO, TRICK, BARON, LEXIS, VON , AXIOM, WES LEE are stuck in NXT or Middle card ....
This whole Roman Reigns... bloodline storyline is starting to leave a bitter taste for a while now. To the extent that it's beginning to take the fun out of professional wrestling and WWE in particular. I guess WWE has nothing better to put on the script.
Roman doesn't deserve any championship 🏆,,he can't win without any helping
كذابين وحلقة رومان رينز تحديدآ واضح كان التمثيل
Every Main Event in Saudi Arabia , all women wrestlers in Full cloth and no women audiences at all 😂😂😂😂😂
I was a huge FAN of Roman when the Sheild split....but not now because of his so called "COUSIN". They sucks 🤣
Watching divas.wrestling with power rangers outfit only cuz of the arabs is just sad
McDonaugh selling that kick so expensive 😂😂
People’s feel boring to watch roman as a champ again and again 😢
LA night is overrated
There are so many talent in WWE who deserve a title shot. Look who got it..Logan Paul😂What a joke
Jey uso supplying super kicks to everyone's chins
Cheater roman reìgns
Can someone put some efforts to say who'll are the winners?
The crowd was not going off as I expected 😢
La knight🎉🎉😂😂
very disappointing  match for John Cena 👎
Roman Reigns ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
everything LA Knight does is gold!
saudi shows absolutely rock
Totally fed up with the Fixed matches. No entertainment. La Night copy of stone cold vs Roman  was joke.  What happened with wwe .  We want iron matches, title change matches, no contender match. Looking for good stories nd title matches.  I hope wwe will do something.  Be honest Losing interest now from wwe. Fan from Since 2001
The most worstest highlights I have ever seen in my life time no match have the result what the hell this video has a purpose
Roman pensava fosse facile
Complimenti complimenti
Lknghit
Roman will never win if alone 🤣
Roman regins like screw off already 😂
How many ads would you like on your video?   WWE: Yes
💪😊👊Roman❤
Am I the only one who wants Rey Mysterio to get a rematch
Waste of time
that's the deadest crowd ever lmao
Genuinely don't think anyone is going to be worth beating Roman in WWE's eyes. Like, they build Sami and Jey and Cody and Seth and LA Knight and now they all just feel like secondary characters that will never truly be the guy in WWE. Like, they have one guy and when Roman's done, all these pointless (and REPETITIVE AF) screw jobs they pull every match makes them downright skippable for me now. The women's booking is just as bad, actually. The only real drama I actually accept anymore is the men's undercard and even then, it's inconsistent at best. Like that Candice Lerae concussion angle was TERRIBLE. The angles are either nonsensical that end the same way everytime (Jimmy's out because they tried to end his career! JUST KIDDING! He's helping Roman again 😂) or they just don't pay off. Ever. Like Seth. Love the guy profusely. But that whole Nakamura angle feels like his entire 'main roster' run: brought in just to keep him from wrestling elsewhere, booked just enough NOT to make him world champion. The tag titles are being hot potatoed, after over a year long reign. Drew looks bitter and ready to leave. And I could say the same for Ricochet, Escobar, Kross (who might be done) and Theory, who is proof Vince isn't calling the shots anymore. Not that they're all incredibly captivating, but my god. The company is three people right now (Gunther, Rhea, and Roman). Everyone else is just fodder. You could kill off Jimmy and put Solo in a shark cage, and Heyman alone could thwart 99% of the people Reigns has faced so far. His opponents are booked to look like morons that only want to screw each other over. It's too much. I had to cancel the network. I just don't see this being worth even 10$ a month anymore.
I'm really sad for John and drew but other hand I have a reason to be happy still WWE undisputed Universal Champion ☝🏻
HHH another father come Solo sikoa 😂
dajjal in Arab
Roman Reigns cheating khel khelte hai 😢😢
John Cena Lost How ?
Once again, we all knew Roman reigns couldn't win a Battle on his own.
John cena is getting old 🥲
Man this is just bad low level going through the motions theater.  No passion in it anymore. The Attitude and Ruthless Agression Era's were peak
Logan Paul is the next champion!
Happy to Kairi Sane back again😊❤
Like for Roman
Roman Reigns is the worst ever champion. Always taking rest only taking part in main events. Can't even defend his title on his own, needs solo or an uso to help him. Pathetic script writing.
Knight's lockout was 🔥
Roman rings❤❤❤
Worst event of wwe ever
I guess no one wins without cheating and can be part time and still get handed a title 🤮🚮
But I still support you Roman ❤
Roman u need to play solo with no support  we need to see your power
Wolves Back Kairi Sane your Best 😊
Dirty mane  brings bank to the match
Loser Roman Ring vs LA Knight winner
WWE is so desperate that they need Logal LOL
roman full success is achieved through cheating, someone needs help roman.... tell him to come alone without any help....la kanight super game 🔥 He deserved this victory.. but Roman's helper came and ruined everything... these 2 have to come again for a match  The name
Either you drop Roman as the champion, or lose fans and viewers. What kind of legacy is this, where he's remaining the champion forcefully.. Its irritating to watch him lifting the belt and wining through outside supports.. Isn't the locker room have any other talent to be the champion??.. Come on, we had enough of Roman, its the time to change.. Otherwise people are gonna just stop watching wwe..
How Roman has made it this far with two of the lamest finishers is beyond me. Superman Punch? A spear that isn’t even devastating, one of the most overused moves. I don’t get it man. Every match I see him in he looks so pedestrian.
Drew Macntire will champion in judgment day
I'm always a John Cena fan ❤ Now LA Knight too ❤
Cana gotta let it go that bald spot man!!!!
Please Stooped title interrupted it's not fair games...

Seth really needs to lose the belt already . I understand Roman trying to catch hogan n samartino but Seth ... they gotta let the belt move around.  Shinsuka or Drew would've been good . At this point bring la knight to raw n have him take it . But just I'm over it . Seth is dope but he don't need the belt .
Pathetic wwe, whats the point of other wrestlers if only roman reigns, seth rollins and Rhea ripley never loses... i guess they will make roman vs seth and unified the title again.. undisputed heavy weight champion.
Fake fake fake😂
Roman Reigns best chetar in the world or Jimmy solo sam chetar
roman never win without help
Roman Reigns 🦁🇧🇩🇧🇩❤️❤️❤️💪💪
Can’t wait for Seth Vs Roman at Survival Series Champ V Champ❤❤ Seth will win obviously
Survivor Series 2023 : RAW TV SHOW HOST The Miz vs SmackDown TV SHOW HOST Grayson Waller.
How are people still letting WWE have Roman as champ? 🤮
Roman is now also a cheater nothing else
It's a great show❤❤❤❤ Loved it❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Finishers and superkicks don’t mean anything anymore. Everyone kicks out
Finally Kairi is back
Where the people saying LA stage fright ....
Where is the 24x7 champ?
Worst ppv
WWE treat John Cena and Mysterio like a jobber what the hell,they carried WWE for years and now wtf?
Wwe still ignored the fact that crowd was chanting CM punks name at a certain point of time,those chants were unexpected
Bro did the ppls elbow🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can't believe they gave the title to a Podcast/YouTube guy. I know one title had to change hands in Saudi but this is ridiculous. I don't like Priest but he should of cashed in on him smh. What a joke!
Roman's matches are so repetitive. So boring, always needs help to win. Worst Champion in the recent times.
Fake players Roman ring 😠😠😠😠😠 😠
Cm punk chants supressed by wwe lol
How hell this video is trending not show all ein
Hey I know John Cena is easily beat solo , it's too much WWE😰, how can you disrespect a legend.
even dom n youtuber wrestler is better than la knight.. i dont know why he got wwe champion ship match.. there was cena. cody. other better superstar🤣🤣🤣🤣
We all knew Knight would lose. Hopefully they had Logan win so LA can take the title from him.  Otherwise Smackdown will have 2 part time champions.
Wade Barrette in commentary made me emotional. 😶 Those Nexus days & fued with Ortan & Cena ❤️
Wwe you are disrespect the legend John Cena
Listooooo🎉
Jey's superkicks are just a thing of beauty
3 years of same old Roman vs Name and some Uso spoiling the title match. @WWE can we please move on now?
Joker Romain  never win without help 😂😂😂
There truly is no point to watching Roman Reigns content anymore. Every promo is the exact same. Every title match(of which there are few) is the exact same. It's  gotten very truly boring.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Worst crown jewel
@WWE has become trash after booking logan paul to win again and again. It's going to fall to rock bottom soon
Anybody else just skim to the end of Roman Rein's $h1tty singles matches now. Because it's been the same match for every match for like 3 years now. He can't win without help from his family.   Honestly his reign as champion is fkn sad. It's the worst artificially fluffed up reign since Ric Flair's 80's reign/s as champion.
It's high time that WWE finds a way to get rid of Roman Reigns' Title run. It's getting so boring and going nowhere. It's gotten to a point that now its feels that he's been forced into the fans. His aura and stage presence has faded. WWE should have ended his wonderful storyline in a better way.
Allows JHON china lover 💖💖💖
WWE is missing a trick here, and I'm afraid they won't be able to capitalise on LA Knight's megastardom. They ruined the prime of the likes of Drew McIntyre, Kevin Owens, Cody Rhodes, and now LA. What purpose was served when they just wanted Roman to retain the title with all his family against one person?I know it's their business, and Roman is making them a lot of money, so they're just pushing him, but they don't understand that Drew, KO, and Cody would've made them more money than Reigns. But their think tank and content creators are looking clueless and out of new ideas, so they're just keeping going in the same direction. By this way, they can earn money; however, LA, KO, and Cody would've made a lot more than Reigns in every department, whether it's in ring sales or merchandise.They're not understanding that LA, Cody, Drew, and KO have been heavily ignored, and their worth is lowering day by day due to this boring bloodline story and Reigns, who only show up on PLEs and keep vanishing from his root, The SmackDown. I've been a sports wrestling fan since WCW Nitro days, and seeing today's story lines and in-ring performances, it's very obvious and clear that WWE is now out of new ideas with poor scripting and content creation. They're now doing some good with Logan Paul and using his online stardom, which should have been done at last year's PLE Crown Jewel by putting Logan over Reigns. Logan did prove his worth in terms of in-ring wrestling at that PLE, but WWE content creators made a disastrous move by putting Reigns over Logan. Now, after a year, they've given him a US Championship, but think if he'd won that Universal Title last year, how much of a fan base and money WWE could've earned, but....
😂
I don’t remember now how long is that I don’t waste my time watching the entire program and taking the short version here.   You undisputed champion and his record sucks, the matches sucks (except the women that seems are the only ones who work hard there. You should put all of the men on paid vacation or whatever and make the show entirely women and maybe it will worth watching
3 my most favourite wrestlers lost this night. I'm really upset with the defeat of Knight, Drew and Rey
This stupid crowd cheering for a cheating Logan Paul is very annoying. Not sure why anyone would like this bozo
So absurd the women have to wear the same stupid looking shiny jumpsuits but in different colors. Religious extremist nutters
It's definitely a better Crown Jewel than others.
Heel mcyntire could be something very fresh and exciting. They should be pushing him in that role over boring annoyances like rollings
I really think Sammy  stole the show hands down
Awfully predictable, but a good show.
It’s really getting old now with Roman as the champ, need a new Champ WWE
I Love WWE Crown Jewel It Was Beautiful 💪👑💎💖💖💖💖💖👊💥🤝🇺🇸
The worst PPV ever
Roman Reigns sucks hasn’t won a match single handed since he became the champion his whole family needs to go somewhere
Was there any fair win?
im over roman reins being champ need somone new bring back brock lesnar and make a team like back in the day NWO
I'm burnt out on Roman being champ after 3 fkn yrs.
wade barrett sounds soooo much like the late james hunt when he partnered with murray walker on F1 commentary
I love Rhea Ripley but she’s giving me Noel Fielding vibes in that outfit
iyo sky best--logan paul makes me sick
RitaNeno Loue Stephanie 22😍
Roman reign is not a real champ cause never has fought alone.
Roman Reigns is the best forever
Drew should've won. He deserves something. He's far too good to have nothing, same goes for raquel. I really want her to win something
Logan Paul is today
Where is Ronaldo ?
What is the point of this title reign where the title is retained by cheating and interference? Is WWE being bribed by Roman Reigns and Bloodlines?
Damn u roman
I hate that they let Reigns keep the belt again. I’m so sick of him winning the belt the same way. Always because someone in the Bloodline intervenes
Why watch Romen matche, they  are pointless.

Tired of Roman being the champion. He nevers wrestle. The Undertaker, the Rock, Stone Cold, Hogan and many more were champions and actually wrestled. Roman just has the back seat. WWE you need to do better!
Ok iyo sky get away from Bayley 🤢🤮 because the Kabuki warriors are back hell yeah plus like always Roman never can win on his own always interference 🙄
رومان لا يستطيع الفوز بمفرده
Where is Cristiano Ronaldo
So sick of watching Roman and Rollins as a champion
They bury a Megastar & give a Title to a YouTube star that is BS
So, Logan Paul pulled a John Cena move on Rey Misterio, huh?
That Logan win was pour BS!
Roman ❤❤🇨🇩🇨🇩
Logan Paul with that heel brass knuckle move respect haha a dirty way to win he could have won without as well was whooping mysterio mysterio experience showed tho 🔥
And of course Roman stays the champ. A boring finish, predicted by everyone, that practically no one wanted. At least Kairi is back i guess
y cristiano??
Another one 🎉
All acted well....😊 nice movie
wwe hates us sooo much build us up to tear us down pimping us out
11:11 the camera man knows what's he doing he thinks he slick 😂
This was such a mediocre event. WWE was better last year. They should put the Bloodline back together
Nice way to make ur champion look weak as hell by having no clean wins
Akira Tozawa to defeat Roman reigns fight me
Creo que hablo por todos al decir que estamos artos de ver que le hagan perder todas las peleas a jhon cena y encima de una manera humillante , ya no recuerdo la ultima vez que jhon cena gano una pelea ... Queresmos ver al campeon "jhon cena" de vuelta ser campeon
Cena losing AGAIN is TRASH! 😂😢
Ray es un huevon era para pierda con amigo Escobar así quedaba bien ahora perdió con otro es un huevon
Has anyone beat Roman yet?
Ok,WWE is nonsense. Escobar put that knacle there.. don't tell me you didn't see it.. AEW IS AMAZING. BS
Get lost Roman,
And roman finisher just a spear? 😂  What a joke finisher😂🤣
E thW o gats odo something about that s*** show going on with Roman reigns's title reign. Is that same s*** every f****** time he fights? They need a new f****** champion, none of this f****** 3 on 1 b*******
John Cena hair
This was ok pvv only good match was Seth Rollins vs drew and ray vs Logan
That elbow by Kairi is just inSANE
And yet again we all knew the results  of all the matches. WWE uncreative  just can't let a title change happen.  Why I will never buy a ppv. A waste of  money  if you do.     What a joke again same results  for 3 years now. Get real WWE.
Thank God that Roman is not the champion anymore.
Kairi Sane and Iyo Sky.  Two beautiful women.
How exciting Roman retained we didn't see that coming 🙄 its getting boring now, massive respect to Logan Paul though if it wasn't for his quick thinking Rey would have been seriously hurt or worse
Best match of the evening at Crown Jewel 2023 was hands down Seth "Freakin" Rollins vs Drew Mclntyre for the WWE world heavyweight title a great match between two excellent wrestlers a great match of pure wrestling I really liked this match and I have to be honest this match was my favorite of this WWE PPV 🔥🔥🔥🔥
NO ME PIERDO DE NADA , ES SIEMPRE LO MISMO OLVIDATE
Full WWE Crown Jewel in 13:53 ? really ?is not full show
Roman reigns suchk
So Boring The same ol 💩
Survivor Series War Games 2024 Randy Orton Returns
Miss you old John Cena😢 and Cm punk return😢
rinse and repeat roman ending as per boring asf
Yes! Jey Uso took Dominic's head clean off with that Super Kick! 👍🏿
That damn Logan Paul! 😡
Cena already made his time; more than twenty years
Logan Paul's a cheater like his girlfriend
WWE thank you for the carmelo    hayes  action figure now can you please do the trick Williams action figure❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I am sick to the back teeth of the WWE always allowing the same old westlers to be champions, I also knew deep down before crown jewels who was going to win & lose it's becoming a joke when u can tell straight away what's going to happen, L.A Knight should off beaten Roman regins, John cena should of beaten solo (so cena can go out on a high instead of a low) Logan Paul should have lost, I could go on but i think i made my point, it's time for a change & allow the up & coming new stars of today a chance to shine instaed of keeping with the old.
Nothing special this gala🥱
Tangina upload nyo na full video
I didn't expect Kairi Sane to return
It only took 8 matches into his WWE career to win his first championship. Logan Paul is a star in the making. What an absolute legend and future WWE Hall of Famer
I liked Logan Paul entrance
Miz should turn face
I am glad that Rhea Ripley retained her WWE Women Championship
I knew that Roman Reigns would retain his WWE Undisputed Universal championship and it happened
I knew that Logan Paul would be the new United States champion and it happened
Sami Zayn should haven't won
I feel that Drew McIntyre will join Judgment Day
WWE needs a few more part timers. All the belts should be held by part timers.
Out of all of this. I really freaking love Jimmy USO he sells SOOOOOO well!
Sane Is so gorgeous
Román ☝️
Only Reason Roman Reigns Is Still Champion Is Cause He Gets Outside Help
In Arabia Mens Wrestlers Can Use ... Butty Shorts , Womens No 😂❓
So it was L.A knight vs Bloodline
Be honest with you you can't get mad at Roman because one Roman was on his vacation Roman never called out La night La night called  Roman out  he put his own foot in his mouth so la night Got served where  do you see hear  Roman reigns call out La night first that was La night fault how you feel if you're not bothering that person out of no  where somebody call you out and you haven't done nothing wrong to them are you kidding me right now you probably thinking what the hell you do to them for them to call you out right
Stop the Seth Rollins hate! The man damn near has match of the night every time he wrestles and consistently defends that title.
Never watching a crown jewel again even if it is free on peacock...
It's always the same with Román, someone helps him win, they have no imagination for a better result🤔
Me gusta la pelea de rey misterio pero con trampa se gana todo fácil que lastima que se ensuciara la lucha de esa manera Logan paul sabes que tuviste que hacerle trampa al gran rey misterio para poder quitarle el cinturón asi no se hacen los campeones pero ya veremos la revancha que pedirá el gran rey misterio
What was wrong with those ring ropes at crown jewel?
How people can still enjoy reigns matches after that is wild
Who’s getting tired of Roman👇
Cómo basuras solas nunca podrán ganar un campeonato
Claramente se ve que le ganó con trampa a rey misterio cuando lo cubre y la cuenta se da tres algo se guarda en el pantalón es evidente que lo ko con trampa a rey misterio vean bien
I wasted my time watching this, the most boring ever.
Who would have seen Roman retaining coming 😐 its not like 🎉weve been repeating the same sequence for the past 4 years now as we watch him take another 15 year time off
wwe to a new low!!!...logan karen paul. smh!!!
Now Roman is gonna face against some people I’m guessing Royal Rumble, maybe elimination chamber and or money in the bank, then looses the title at Wrestlemania XXXX (40)
Best matches were Sami/JD, Roman/LA, and Rhea+ 4. Rest of the card was mid or worse. Best part of most matches was the outside interference. We see that every single week a couple times. Usually by the same exact people, all the time.
I’m sick of Roman reigns cheating to win he should’ve lost
🫂🤍🐷😻😡😕😮🤳💅🌺🌱
Cena needs to retire! Roman is the worst champ next to Brock and Punk. They brag about the women's division, and honestly, that 5-way match was straight trash! Logan Paul becoming champ is a joke to that title.
Remember back in the 90s and early 2000s when it was wwf at the time and they had people clinging thier seats because of a really good storyline they had but now not so much. It was nice to see one wrestler be on top for a bit and then switch hands. Now it's you see what matches are what and yoi already know who's winning and for that it gets stale and when it gets stale you lose ratings. It would be nice to see roman defeated he's had that belt way to long. I also think the bloodline story is boring and not so creative they need to pull out new stories because right now its not there like back in the old day
I’m getting so tired now of Roman Reigns cheating. LA Knight won that match!! WWE you need to sort this out.
Esto de Román se a vuelto completamente Monótono 👎👎👎👎👎 siempre con Ayudas
Hhh is just Vince McMahon behind a mask… he is no different
The 5 way women's match was terrible, Nia is one of the worst female wrestlers
McIntyre to the judgement day ????
Wwe is not really last year romaine rein  championship this year
I'm glad Roman Reigns won i never liked Eli Drake/ LA knight.
Logan beating rey is a joke
Waw Amazing !!!
Can they just let Roman win clean without the help of his cousins or without any interruption? They makin Roman look so weak every Pay Per View match😂
ts fake asf
Roman won n gonna lose the belt to CM punk whn he returns in Chicago Survivor Series
Imagine cheating to beat a legend
WWE is being bias, they are not making a small celebration video of Roman and Solo from winning, what if knight and cena are also won? Im sure that they are making a video about them
just as i predicted RR retains the title..
And once again Roman can’t do it alone .
Next championship match should be a cage match pr hell in a cell. That will keep those bloodline guys out !
Wow you apparently managed to make a 14 min video of highlights from that snoozefest
The way JD sold the super kick lmao
If crown 👑 jewel 💎 comes out on dvd 📀 I’m getting it to watch.
Ngl rheas shoukder shrug to drew said so much without a word being spoken
Man am I the only one tired of the bloodline and judgement day getting over
Sorry to say but Worst PLE of 2023
Logan saving Rey’s botch is sensational by the way.
Why do you have Shayna beatRonda then you do nothing with her.  New management is the same as the old.
Rhea looks hot af in that suit 🥺
2:39 bro pulling a Jay White 💀
12:53- “OMG, how did he do that! How did LA Knight kick out of the first spear….. like pretty much every single other wrestler has done against Roman for almost a year now (if not longer)!!! I can’t believe I just saw something that always happens! That’s insane!” That’s what I heard!!! I may be one of the few people that actually likes Roman! But for different reasons!!! I like him because he is a perfect metaphor for how the world actually works! If you are a A hole, gaslighting, lying, cheating thief and the worst type of person but you have power and friends with power also you will always be on top! The good be damned! If you care for others and try to do what’s right you will never bring home the gold!!! And yes, I know some day he will lose! But the point has already been made!!!
I think La knight won
Kairi Sane looks great too bad the crowd didn’t know who she was.
Román sin sus primos no es nada
Logan Paul as US Champ is a Joke!!!!!
Kairi is so pretty
LA Knight really need a better finisher
10:38- Is she really called a pirate?!? Lmao Really!?! And what’s with the salute before dropping a plane elbow drop?!?
9:11 Why are they getting this guy over, he is a leech snd disgrace to the United states title 🇺🇸 WWE trying to mute the booes lol, it so bad, the guy is a f***tard. Shameful.
I never see John doing a choke slam
Vaya mierda de resumen
Welcome back kairi.
Bro, I swear I hate Jimmy USO I used to like him, but this man😡
Logan pulling a John Cena with The entrance.
Man, let either Roman win fair and square for once or remove him from the title.
yes login Paul wins let’s all drink Primie!!!!!
7:04 we'll be seeing more of him soon. Just hope they don't do a gable stevenson on him.
Grayson waller show vs Miz T.V.😂
Roman is getting help he's not a champion ok people champion do it by there self ok
I hope WWE is building towards something worth seeing, because they just fed my favorite Megastar to a guy who could never get over as a face.  And made Logan Paul a champion as well….  I don’t even see a reason to watch Survivor Series now.    One of the worst PPVs in recent memory.
Free Palestine saudi
5:07- If this match was to show the Solo is going to be the one to dethrone Roman then “maybe” it might turn into something worth watching (but WWE is well known for F-ing up great storylines and turning them into 💩)! If not this was just a waist of time!
I actually thought about watching this sorry B show ppv. I'm glad I didn't sleeping was better than wasting my time watching garbage.
Sami did him dirty😂
Wwe, I'm 16k.
3:37-WWF/WWE has definitely ruined matches like this for me! I’m sorry (and really don’t care if no one agrees with me) but if the match isn’t a tag match and has 3 or more wrestlers in it fighting each other then it SHOULD BE a elimination match!!! It’s very dumb having 5 wrestlers in one match fighting each other and only having one pin! Especially since the champion could have nothing to do with a pen and still lose our belt!!! Horrible
Ok Logan Paul .... respect!
Cena was just there to pass the torch to solo.
2:27- Yeah, I really didn’t think it was going to happen this night!?! Since if he got hurt in any way in that he would be going into his original match not at 100% and it probably would be for the title also since he would now be champion!!!
Someone hit me up when Roman is no longer being fed true main eventers….    And really?  Logan Paul?  I get that Trips is a heel sympathizer, but I’m out for awhile.  Later Fam!
JD should have done better!
1:02- I can’t wait for Ups and Downs today!!! Simon loves to say that the blue thunder bomb never works but this is now the second time this year that it’s gotten the win!!! I wonder if he’s going to act like that’s never happened before like always or another thing he does when he refuses to admit he’s wrong is he will skate around it and not even mention it to make it look like it didn’t exist! Therefore he’s not wrong!?! Lmao ok!
Rey Mysterio now not strong 🥲
I get that there is a script WWE uses, but did you all have to have outside interference in almost every single match?!?!?!?!   • The end of Seth vs Drew, with potential MITB cash in, outside interference   • Cody vs Priest outside interference  • Rey vs Logan outside interference   • Bianca vs Iyo outside interference   • Reigns vs Knight outside interference (which the world knew was going to happen eventually).  • Even Miz TV outside interference  Only three out of nine segments didn't have interference, and of those three, the interference was in the ring with the Women's World Championship, so technically, two matches with no interference.  I understand that all of this leads to more storylines, but man, to this multiple decades long fan, the interference is becoming a nuisance. I know my opinion doesn't matter for the simple fact that the event was sold out and people from around the world decended upon Saudi Arabia to attend, so this is just my opinion of the show.
boring
I don’t know why but the aura of the crowd is so…off
If Cena isn't going to win anymore stop his in ring appearances
Really bored with the tribal chief story
@wwe Logan doesn’t deserve that title, remember the Japan forest that no one wants to talk about
Crowd is dead.
That was definitely the funniest WWE PPV I’ve seen in a very long time! Lmao hahahahahaha But what I didn’t know is how much WWE must really hate that country!?! Seriously!!! Why else would you have 1 or maybe 2 PPVs at the most in that country and do the opposite of what you know the fans want in 93% of the matches?!? Before I saw that I think the average fan hate per match was at the most 70-75%!?! They loved to repeat most of the night then “there are 5 titles on the line” for that low class PPV. So how many of those ended without some form of cheating and/or interference??? Yeah, I’ll wait! And then Ripley’s entrance?!? Um, what?!? I couldn’t tell if that was supposed to celebrate that country’s culture or insult it!?! But I’m pretty sure with how the crowd was silent all the way up until her actual music started I bet it was the second one!?! I like Judgment Day (not baby Dom Dom) but that was……… um, yeah! And now I’m going to look through the comments for all those people that are salty over Knight getting whooped just like I said he would!?! Too bad I don’t have any popcorn lol
I have to give respect to the Saudi fans for showing appreciation for great pro wrestling and the psychology of the matches.  They seem like a blend of an American and a Japanese crowd.  Maybe I am wrong, but that's the way it looks and sounds to me.
Lol judgment day
I have mixed  feelings about Logan being champ.  It's good for business to get more people in. BUT, he did kinda abandoned his pig a few months ago

👌👌👌👌👌😭😭
LA knight is a true warrior YEAH!!!!
Team WWE vs. The Judgment Day Team WWE vs. The Bloodline WWE Women vs. Damage CTRL
Kairi Sane's elbow is always a thing of beauty.
What a boring show
I think it’s time for Drew to get a heel turn. Time to freshen things up.
I was wondering why the women were dressed like that then i realized where it was
The most boring PPV so far in 2023
eli drake wouldn't have fought like that in the match. yeah.
Crown Jewel trash 👎🗑 PG trash 👎🗑 WWE trash for very along time 👎🗑 The product is trash 👎🗑 Very disappointing WWE. WWE has became a joke and not worth to watch anymore.
I hope knuckles doesn't find out where WWE took his emerald till this is over.
Soooo, why is Nia in a title match?
Why do they always do rey dirty
I would never pay and have never paid to watch wwe ppv 🤣 these are so garbage
kairi & iyo so pretty   love you ❤❤❤❤
Fkn arabs are afraid of women showin' some skin?😂
Logan Paul going for the Johnny Lawrence look from karate kid
let’s Go MIZ !!!
Chris motionless slapped the spit out of Rodriguez mouth
L show for what they did to cena
Jimmy sold being put through the table so well 😂
Wwe writers are boring
I'll keep it a buck I forgot Iyo was a champion. I forgot she was on the roster
The only boring 😞 match of all time as always was between L A KNIGHT YEAH ! and you know that cowards the bloodline
Great to see Kairi back
I keep imagining Solo Sikoa in shoes 👟    😅
Reigns is boring
Am i the only one whos getting tired of roman holding a title?
Roman Reigns is not a super star because he can't win alone without support
McDonough, low budget Cameron Grimes
man bro is so good and sick
Y'all remember when roman got his head bounced off the table by triple h
seth Rollins is gonna win
man this is so  dope. and cool man this is sick
Rhea Ripley pinning Zoey Stark is like Former WWE Superstar Edge pinning Finn Balor!   it's hinting that Zoey Stark joins The Judgment Day folks!
"through the already dismantled barricade"  😊
Bro it must suck being a woman where they were st ,theres legit nothing but guys there a huge suasage fest
*only JAMES  ELSWORTH can defeat this lazy boring tribal chef cooking champion.*
@WWE writers. That was ba the way you screwed Rey, Bianca and LA Knight. Cheating on your best matches, Like come on. We are tired of the cheating, Roman sucks, Damage Control is just as stale as he is, Logan Paul cheated cus there is no way he could have beat Rey (Roman Style), Wait, did i mention Roman sucks? Like come on LA Knight and all of his precious opponents since he turned heal would have beat him. He always cheats and it's not right. Bianca deserved to win the WWE women's championship, Iyo is not worthy. Come on @WWE writers what's happening to my show man?
That crowd was atrocious!  The only ones who make any noise at all for the women is the children.  All the adults are sexist losers who can’t even bring themselves to show a woman respect enough to clap or cheer.  Pathetic WWE.  Compare that sausage fest of a crowd to the electricity of Puerto Rico
Bianca got them cheeks 🤤
Roman Reigns is nothing without bloodlines interference. He could have been ousted from his team some months ago. This has become less entertaining
Romain can't fight by himself he needs  support  and he is a cheater and has no talent and doesn't  deserve to be champion 😊
Roman's plot armor is freaking boring at this point. Rinse and repeat ever since CATC event.
It took Logan an MJF but finally! Dude deserves a title with all the quality matches he’s been putting up.
This is proof that Roman Reigns will lose the title if he fights alone. What a shame "Head of the table"
Wwe matches are so much predictable making them boring.We fans want to be shocked, amazed and our minds blown away....this is not entertaining anymore.Repeating the same thing again and again
Enough with Romans title reign. The number of days is doing nothing for the fans at this point
Boring predictable ppv, WWE ain’t going to let Roman drop the title before wrestle mania but drew should of won though
There’s KNOW EXCITEMENT in the universal championship picture any more smh Roman is starting to get very boring
Am I the only one that thinks Rhea Ripley is turning into Noel Fielding hahahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don’t thinks it’s right for the wwe to continue to make US fans keep suffering by watching Roman continue to defeat everybody by outside interference it’s literally KNOW EXCITEMENT in the wee know more it’s time for a new CHAMPION
SIX. MONTH. BREAK. YEAH!
Thank you WWE For your years of Entertainment  Haven’t been the same  Since the WWF… Tired of watching the same  LOPSIDED 3or/4 on ONE      STORYLINE ‼️🕳️
Bet they don't show the LA Knight 3 count pin 🤣🤣
STOP!!! JUST STOP LETTING ROMAN WIN!!!! HE NO LONGER DESERVES THE TITLE SINCE HE CAN'T WIN WITHOUT HELP ANYMORE!!!!!
Oh come on... superman punch? What sort of gae azz move is that
After Roman dominance, then Seth Rollins.
WWE dropped the ball with LA KNIGHT , writers made him look weak.
Why do u know the end of the fights before they start? 😂 Always helping gangs ruining combats 😂
sane is insane
Worst Ppv This Year, Everything Stayed The Same,The Girls Looked like Nas Car Drivers, LA Night, And Drew was Screwed bt we all Seen It Coming, Why Build Them Up Only To Get Embarrassed… Ps II’ve to see Bailey in Shorts( Unrelated)
that arab guy was cringe af
LP Can't win a match so he cheats wow
where the hell was tje sami match i watched the full ppvthis was never on
john cena in my opinion shoud not of lost
they show Roman very weak😂
Drew is done, i hope he drafts to smackdown and wins the US title and becomes a grand slam champion
Yeah nice highlights……
Bloodline and judgement day vs cody Rhodes and jey uso and sami zayn and la knight and john cena survivor series war games great match
Tired of Reigns ! Again Winner, again cheater ! So booooooring ! AEW seems to be more and more attractive after each WWE PLE.
Joke of a PPV
Roman hanya bisa menang dengan bantun orang lain atau timnya.. tanpa mereka roman sudah selalu kalah
Roman hanya bisa menang dengan bantun orang lain atau timnya.. tanpa mereka roman sudah selalu kalah
Logan Paul would have lost if it wasn't for brass knuckles
Roman hanya bisa menang dengan bantun orang lain atau timnya.. tanpa mereka roman sudah selalu kalah
Where's Ronaldo?
Logan paul won the us title
At least show how they  win
Roman always win not fair...
The day Roman defends his title against a worthy opponent and no one gets involved will be the day i might acknowledge him.. But probably not
Instead of shield we need a new team called sword with Seth and Cody and Sami and Jey and KO
Roman cant win without  his back up .. wil like to see him actually  win without backup. Im tired of him
Wtf? Giving logan paul a belt???? WWE you crazy…
What a joke the WWE has become..you can't watch a competitive fight without intervention... usual scripted BS
Padahal mereka yang menonton mengetahui kalau palestina sedang butuh banyak bantuan, tapi mereka lebih menyukai hiburan dunia gulat 😢
Bayley about to get Put out the Group....
I can't believe the WWE LET SOMEONE LIKE LOGAN PAUL Beat Rey Mysterio.  And he the only one Who Lost His Belt.... Ain't that something....SMH...
💤 RR still champ then 💤
The Knight movement doesnt stop! Nah nah dummies😊! We just get started! And thats a fact of life❤
what's the point of putting highlights without the pinfall... I've never understood that...
Rey lost the title? Goodnight WWE
Am I the only that thinks reigns is the worst champion all his big wins had interference from bloodline which shows he's not able to be a solo champ ... Also the writing is lazy from WWE on reigns matches is very predictable
Oh Well The SAMOAN HULK HOGAN WON AGAIN WHAT ELSE IS NEW!!!....
1:29 very creative counter
John cena is almost at its wits end...
Astaga.... swdara" ny di Palestina lg di Bantai ech ini di Bahrain lg huraa huraa huraa....
Roman reigns can not win without help. Its been boring for 2 years. I have not watched any of his matches for 2 years. Because i know the outcome. He gets saved from loosing every time. The story line has been done for iver 2years. Enough is enough.
ฉันเกลียด ROMAN
House show
michael cole reminding all of us hes undefeated at wrestlemania
I love drew sooooo much ❤
Please, Bookers, for the love of Hogan, let Roman lose his next title match or, if he has to win, make it fricking clean!
Why do the men not have to wear body suits?
Just on a side note, how incredible (considering all the political upheaval in the Middle East right now) to see Syrian/Canadian duel national Sami Zayn getting such a pop in Suadin Arabia considering it wasn’t that long ago that he was banned from entry to Saudi Arabia.
WWE failed on this one. L.A. Knight should be the Champion !
We will boycott WWE until L A Knight will be the Undisputed Universal Champion.
What a bummer! Totally boring. Nothing has ever changed every times, all the times, in years. WWE writers either they're sleeping from years or have no ideas obviously. Such a ridicolous event.
Roman reigns
Who wins roman or la
Those kicks from 11:34 are insane 🥴🥴
Crown Jewel sucks
Ugh.
It’s painful to watch solo bitchkoa and Roman lames wrestle
Has Ronaldo come?
I'm getting tired of interference ughh maybe that's the point, making us frustrated lol . Well, can't wait to see what happens next in Royal Rumble and Wrestlemania!
Drew should be won!!!
McIntyre should have won
Am here for roman reigns ❤❤
logan paul is  such a pus...... when he needs a barenuckel
What a joke result to the main event
Disgusting ends to all matches
Giving logan paul a title is disgraceful mans publicly admitted scamming ppl n kids yet u give him a platform too promote his bs a for one wont be back.
WHY DO THIS SHOW? THIS SHOW SUCK LIKE A RAW OR SMACKDOWN
Who won the match between roman regins and LA night
Is nobody gonna talk about Logan winning us title they could’ve waited till survivor series and mae Santos Escobar champion it would make more sense
So now not only do we have an absent universal champion but an absent US champion as well, sounds great!
Roman reigns can’t win on his own worst champion ever
Getting a bit boring mr reigns
I want to wrestle Michael Cole. I can beat him.
The black queen vibes from Rhea tonight...
Reigns can NEVER win without help
My goodness bad !! Hats off to the Rock for staying in shape !!
L crowd
Your stories are getting boring. I would rather watch highlights on YouTube than the actual ppv
La knight was probably mvp in that match cause as I watched that match I started to realise how do you win against reigns. If you go to he’s past matches you will see what he does
Now smackdown has no titles on their show, well done
saudi 😢 why ????
So boring...how can they always allow someone to help reigns to win???
It was a good show, congratulations Logan
Ofcourse as always Roman reigns cheated 😂😂Too predictable now
As long that roman reigns is cheating he will never lose his titles
Omg kairi sane is back in wwe .....this woman she very strong the goat is back
Awesome☝️❤️❤️❤️
Seriously, they praise Logan's victory with a boxer and wait, Roman Reins or as I like to call it Bulge Reings, why not put him with a real fighter like Rush, Kenny Omega, wait, WWE does not have the finances to compete with AEW
Drew should have won
Can we get a different ending to these Roman matches come on it’s the same bs finishes they’re always great matches but it’s just constantly the same old finish every time.
Kairi deserved a better venue than Saudi Arabia.  Drew not being in Hunter's kliq is hurting him.  That crowd swarmed Sami like he was Jesus.  Roman never winning clean with that belt is boring af now.
Face it kids… There was no highlights from this show… 🥱😴
ASUKA KAIRI IYO THE KABUKI WARRIORS
Am happy iyo sky retained❤
Putting the us title on Logan shows just how little respect the wwe has for that title and for Rey. To let a tool like Logan carry that belt is a disgrace, he's not a wrestler, he's got no respect for the industry, what has he done to deserve the belt? You hardly see him on screen unless it's to push his crappy drink, Rey was in the ring almost every week fighting and putting on a show while Logans off having a boxing match with a mma fighter who's not a boxer.
I knew Rey would lose it soon… but to scammer Logan?? 😪
Logan Paul is talented ngl but damm wtf is he soo cringe😭😭
Roman not dropping till dom is ready to be champ . Sorry another 2 years to groom dom to be a face win than turn heel again for long reign
Fans should just walk out and head home once romans music starts no point in watching if the opponent is rigged to lose we already know the outcome at this point
ok i knew roman was going to win  nooo shocker but can this dude not win  a title match without help,   his 3 and half year run is tainted,  loll
The women couldn't show any skin? Lmao. Saudia Arabia is so oppressive.
worst ple in hhh era
respect logan for saving rey's neck
Great show except for the same lame finish to Reigns match that we've seen for 3 1/2 years.  The Reigns matches are really getting old.  Don't they have any fresh ideas?
Imagine getting super kicked in the face and getting up 2 seconds later 😂
people moaning about la knight give him a break he has worked hard to get to where he is you are all only jealous that you will never be able to achieve half of what he has so stop moaning for god sake
Why is there just men and boys in the crowd ??
After today is Riyhad I might stop watching WWE because of Solo, Nick, Roman, Triple H. Just end the title reign already before I fully stop watching
you will never dethrone Roman
Blah and predictable, nothing special or anything that grabs your attention...
Rheas look was weird...
What does ripply look like?
So predictable
Although Knight lost he looked like a Mega Star 🌟 🤩
I hope punk wii appear @survivor series and cost seth the belt
Tired of seeing roman reign win because of distraction or help
i think its time for Romans fake cancer to come back only way they will give the title to someone else this is why i quit buying tickets to events they all suck bring back the wwe of the 80's and 90's
I am getting tired of Roman reigns
The tribal cheat
bad cripted and pretty predictable
Boring..same result
logan always got to cheat towin nhe just needs to quit
It's funny how Saudis like wrestling.
Tis isnt no DQ LA knight was fighting 2 on 1
Who care if John Cena lose he still the greatest of all time like if u agree 👎🏾
Wwes yt channel has an ad every minute
I think Roman vs LA was not supposed to be this early but Saudis has money and they wanted the match now. And WWE could not refuse coz the dollarz was keeping increasing
Rhea is sexy AF
Arto de ver como hacen trampa y lo permiten con tal de que roman retenga el campeonato ya hasta aburre
Wwe has so many great women wrestlers
Cena never young anymore...its old now...its time to ritire in wrestling...legend
What a terrible plot
John cena hasn't been beat down this badly since his match against Brock lesnar at Summerslam in 2014
Great show
Im sadd for drew he deserve for title 😢
Roman☝🏿
Honestly reigns keeping the title marks the end of WWE. Its become boring, predictable. Same thing week in and week out. But hey itll be interesting AEW become the new show to watch.
🥱🥱🥱 as expected.. when have we ever seen major titles change hands on night of champions.. 🥱🥱🥱
Honestly the writing keeping Reigns with the title is probably the end of popular WWE. Theyve become boring, predictable. Itll be interesting seeing AEW become the new popular show.
Wasn't a bad card but that crowd was awful tbh no energy or anything
logan paul is truly pendeho.
see when damien alone,hes afraid and he loss
Just what wwe needed, another champ thats almost never there
I’d call every Roman reigns match a 2 on 1
Rhea Ripley and Logan Paul and solo sikoa and Roman reigns cheat it to win like always
Why can't roman beat an opponent clean for once ? It's been the same ending to his matches for what, almost 4 years now lol
Why is the drug pusher Logan Paul champ?
This PPV was full of children which pure stupidity   Still all of them look like terrorists
wwe is fake, they are acting all this thing, i was so angry when la knight lose, wwe please make roman reign to lose that belt against randy Orton
Cut & paste outcomes are Roman Reigns matches
seth gets super cena treatment
Ive been a wwe fan since attitude Era and now I say wwe NO MORE after Roman reins win!
Never Cena chokeslam before. 😂
Not one woman in the crowd
Bloodline is enough! La knight deserve to champ
Wwe probably supports Palestine
I think at WM40 cody chrodes will defeated Roman and become Undisputed Champ. If not I think nobody can stop him😂😂
Now Randy returns and claims his belt...
John chokena slam😂
LA Knight is a dehm One Man Champion💪🏽💪🏽 Cordy Rhodes is a dehm Steel 💥💥💪🏽💪🏽
Anyone else done watching WWE cause of this LA Knight loss?
So does this mean Logan Paul is a full time wrestler now?? Since he’s the u.s champ
☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿
La Knight is the true champ
Denuevo la perrita con lomismo y lo de Reymisterio no mamen
We now know that Roman Reigns wins , go to hell
We are tired of Roman Reigns please
Awesome, Great and Fantastic highlights of Main event Crown Jewel 2023 🔥💎💯😈 Congrats to all Winners 💥💫 Like who agree with me... 👏👏👏
Really enjoyed the fatal 5 way that triple submission by Shayna was nice
Roman once again wins with assistance.   This is getting soooo bloody boring, piss him off, and give others a bloody go.
Crown jewel 2023❤❤❤❤❤
WWE is Garbage now a days. After attitude era I stop watching. Bland, Generic, Formulaic, Dumb down, Cheesy, and Garbage matches started with cena and now its continuing with reigns. 💩💩💩💩
Logan Paul is trash. Why put a great title on trash
Is Logan Paul really our untied states champion?
What if in survivors series war games if Randy Orton returns?
We're was montez to save bianca😢
WTF
It’s Crazy to me Roman is 1 year away from surpassing hogans title reign length. Roman only has 54 title defenses to hogans 468 (look it up and read yourself) also Roman has 32 more promos than he does defenses. The biggest joke of it all is that out of the 54 he has been helped 34 times. He isn’t a chief he is a clown. I don’t hate Roman he is literally just BORING and this bloodline segment is stale.
Y did Jimmy rejoin the bloodline?
I’m convinced Roman can never win without help
Roman  reigns is sustained by his cousins
All the titles except Seths on part timers now lmao
No shock Roman couldnt fight his own fight with out help boring as to watch allways the same
I remember back in the day that the ref ALWAYS checked each participant for any objects. Looks like they don’t care now.
KAIRI SANE IS BACK! BEST ELBOW DROP IN THE BUSINESS
Who’s match is the main event on Crown Jewel?
Another Roman Reigns victory and long vacation.   Well, to the creative team, thank you for disappointing fans once again.
Imagine if we had a multi-billion dollar wrestling organization with bookers who weren't from a nepotism wrestling organization and actually had a fraction of semblance about what wrestling is
I wanna care about the main event but you all knew what would happen. Same story different PLE. The entire rest of the event  was damn good. I didn’t even watch Roman vs LA Knight. I knew what would happen so why watch. Sorry, Knight I’d support ya but anything involving Roman I am completely over.
Logan Paul a champion. Give me a freaking break. What has he done to get all of these matches against the champions.  Not a dam thing. I am pretty much done with WWE. You have a champion who He’s been champion this many days but when you don’t fight anyone but 4 times a year that’s easy to keep. Hell Rollins has defended his more since he got it than Reigns has in years. Bye bye WWE. Maybe AEW will turn you into their Biotch like you did WCW.
Who else noticed the Saudi fans just chant ' this is awesome' for every match 😂😂
WWE SCREWED LA KNIGHT
LA Knight should’ve won. BS.
What a waste of a pay per view 🙄  it was just as bad as the ufc pay per view tonight glad i didn't watch either and only highlights lol 😆 😅
Crown Jewel (2023) was shocking and ok.
Roman regins still winer😊
This was good,just because of the  results make the show looks bad
Why can't Roman defend his title alone
LA the best...❤😇
Cena with a chokeslam? Bro what 😂
Cena still got it
Same old story lines ,the titles will never be defended every week ,or we there be new Champs
If Roman only wrestles 5-6 times per year, why can't you come up with better creative for him? The only thing missing from tonight's match was the part where the referee gets knocked out and opponent pins Roman for 10 count but there is nobody to count... Otherwise we had all the usual: - opponent stats off strong - then slow and plodding back and forth - outside the ring action with steel steps before going back in the ring - Uso/Bloodline interference - Roman spears opponent through barricade to timekeepers area  I'm just saying that with so few matches to book for the guy one would think each one could be made different and special
Kairi returning was the best part of the ppv
What a night? With the exception of Logan stealing the title, I guess so.
HHH era is getting boring. Same stuff every week, every month &every year. We need new champions now. Roman need to loose and we can't wait untill WrestleMania. As far as Seth, i love that man but you need to give him some rest and let drew continue with this momentum. HHH, you really need to do new things. I hope you listening to us

I don't want to see John Cena wrestle anymore, too many L's.
Just take the title off of reigns already. Hasn’t won a match on his own in over a year maybe 2 years. So boring, so lame.
Nobody talking about the three count that never was with LA/Roman? Unreal.
Drew going heel
LOGUN PAUL CHEATED TO RAY MYSTERIO BY HITTING HIM WITH THAT IRON FIST RING😢
Boring 😂
I can't believe WWE has had to sink so low as to give Logan Paul a title. He's a frickin joke and in a couple years,people won't even remember who he is
Wtf is goin on John cena looking like a uncletom back street boy wannabe wtfff
AWESOME WWE CROWN JEWEL 2023 PAY PER VIEW HIGHLIGHTS !!!!
💯💯💯
LA Knight, yeahhh🫡
So again another guy in LA Knight that the crowd chose to be the guy loses to Roman but Logan freaking Paul beats Rey for the US title I'm so over this garbage
FAKE
Kairi looked amazing
when will Roman stop being such coward and a chicken and try win without his dumb idiots
La Piratita Kawaii si back!!!😂
I'm done with this Romen B.S. cuz now I hear he won't wrestle for about 2-3 month. WTF!!!!
I will always support you when you release a new video
great, excellent, wonderfull
Only way Roman can win is having help n this title rain it gets old after a while as the same champion
wwe such a sellout to let lowlife marketing gimmick logan paul win lol
This wasn’t the best place to bring sang back tbh
Wwe is too obsessed with the formula. Not even entertaining anymore because its obvious whos going win every f*ing match
Results were so easily predictable.
It's a travesty that female wrestlers are not allowed to wear their usual outfits
Logan Paul winning a singles title? Wow, and people will call out AEW for overusing part timers.
Imagine putting out a PPV while the highlight of your night was Kairi Sane. Worst PPV of the year.
We need to see a Shave your Head match soon. .. it's over due ..been year's...Cena..any volunteers, Give back to the business... Actually it should be the business thanking John.
LA knight should've won
Roman reigns your bloodline is the reason why you won't ever even be close to john cena level.
Iyos a useless champion
Pathetic …… let me know when Roman loses that belt and I’ll start watching wrestling again
The part-time champ won with his last match in 2023. 😂
Drew should win the match but they decided to downgrade his character into someone who can't beat a guy with back injury.
Roman reigns awesome good
Wtf??? When did Cena start using the chokeslam? Lmao  Btw, Logan Paul was crying too much so they had to slap a belt on him smh
WWE just doesn’t know how to finish matches anymore. Logan Paul shouldn’t have won. Roman can’t win without interference, and is a sorry excuse for a champion. Especially since he only defends 4 times a year and takes 3 month vacations. Like just give the title to people that actually defend.  Becky and Seth defend their titles more than Roman and the Judgement a day combined.
Was green shirt guy there in his front row seat. You know smiley with his big Gawl of chew in his mouth.😂
this ple is predictable but the macth is great
This paper view sucked 😂😂😂cm punk betger save wwe
I use to be a Roman fan it's a joke to watch him anymore
All these matches were predictable 😂😂😂only surprise win was Logan Paul
Anybody else bored of Roman Reigns or is it just me? I don’t know why people even bother watching his matches anymore. We all know he’s not losing. They’re just gonna feed your favorite superstar to him. It’s no wonder he’s been champion for three years, he only wrestles at PPVs. Dude’s a part timer and is supposed to be the face of the company.
Worst. Crowd. Ever.
Still think LA Knight should have won. Done with the whole bloodline storyline. Be better if it was different. Other than Roman keeping the title with help.
Booo for sucker Logan
No~~  roman, yeah~~ LA
Dude I don’t even watch wwe, I just keep up with it kinda deal. I could not imagine watching the same “bloodline” story line with the same ending over and over and over. LA knight would have been perfect to change it up with. Like golly, it’s just a continuous rerun at this point
Is it just me? Or was cenas chokeslam kinda nasty😂
The writers are doing the same thing every Raw, Smackdown and pay-per-view. They mess over Drew McIntyre over and over. Give him a title. Same outcome every match. Predictable and boring and Logan Paul does not deserve a title nor deserves to be in WWE. Enough is enough.
La verdad que esos campeonato que tiene Román no los perderá nunca con los primos ayudándolo sinceramente Román tiene miedo y por eso los primos tienen que ayudarlo
JD's move looks like the opponent did it.
LA Knight was boring and cringey! So happy that Roman Reigns beat him!
Paul Logan is a cowshoof
Fastlane was better than Crown jewel
Roman y sus perras. Ya aburre y se me quitaron las ganas de ver algo tan predecible
WWE is to predictable I didn't even have to watch it to tell you who was going to win there matches and how boring fans wit the same thing all the time
The Roman Reign winning for all this time is getting really boring and complete bs..! Even back in the days the title would change hands and the fued continues then either the former champ wins or loses. And we get more challengers. Austin, Rock, Triple H gave us so many good title matches and the title changed hands between them..! Do something new which is not predictable
Why the hell do you have Rey Mysterio job out to Logan Paul? Good grief, and on a botched knockout punch? Weak.
Roman's matches are boring and predictable. Roman's reign of terror continues. Worse Champion reign ever.
Logan Paul must don't know how to wrestle
What a surprise, Roman once again retains thanks to Bloodline interference.
Triple H' reign of terror<Roman's reign of terror. Romans' reign of terror is awful. He is the awful champion. Triple H is no better than Vince. Roman's title reign is the worst long-term reign ever. WWE is no better after Vince
0:02 Sami Zayn VS JD McDonugh (Kickoff Show) 1:03 Drew McIntyre VS Seth Rollins 2:06 Damián Priest tries to cash his MITB (2:38 Sami Zayn stealls the briefcase) 3:00 Rhea confronts Drew 3:18 Nia Jax VS Shayna Baszler VS Zoey Stark VS Raquel Rodriguez VS Rhea Ripley 4:10 Solo Sikoa VS John Cena (The G.O.A.T) 5:42 Grayson Waller & Miz Fight about what show is better than Ibrahim All Hajjah 7:39 Logan Paul Big Entrance 8:39 Logan Paul VS Rey Mysterio 9:37 Bianca Belair VS Iyo Sky (9:49 Kairi Sane return) 11:16 Damián Priest VS Cody Rhodes 12:09 L.A Knight VS Román Reigns
Kairi with the best looking finisher of all superstars let alone females.
someone tell me vince isnt still in charge. lmao what a joke of a main event. we seen the same damn match the past 4 years. this is why aew is better.
Imagine drew join judgement day
US Title means nothing now just like the WCW title after that actor won.
very good
get someone who can write a different ending for a Boring Reigns match.
This is not wrestling. 90's forever.
Yess!!!! Bring back the kabuki warriors!!!
That super kick sell to jd was perfect
Hotro que va tardar un buen en exponer su título
EVERYBODY SAYING LA KNIGHT YEAH
what a good ppv
I'm actually over people claiming the bloodline to be the best story for a long time ignoring the horrible writing where EVERYONE who wrestles Roman gets beaten by interference from the Uso's , Heyman or Solo yet NONE of them are interfering to screw Roman and CO back its like every wrestler has the memory of a Goldfish  Sami's momentum got absolutely wasted as IMO he should be still trying to cost Roman the title it should be his mission until Roman loses the title and where was Cena when Knight needed back up mans been there every week then goes MIA when it matters   Also Jey should've came out when Jimmy did because if Jey really wants the smoke with his bro he knew Jimmy would show up during that match  Roman's Reign is so boring and predictable.
Is it just me, or the ring looked much higher than normal?
Id strip
I think WWE should start using instant replay like they do in football!  As for  Crown Jewel....there was no "Wow factor ".  Creative needs to give the fans what they want once in a while.
Same wrestlers every werk
Rhea looks like she got Botox surgery enhancements or something huh?
Roman can't  defend on his own   his  got to have his backup people  his not a champion  yeah  !!!!!!!
Logan Paul just showed how his ancestors got everything they have.
Lol you won't cash in tonight Damien priest thank u sami
That is the reason why I hate Roman reigns always gets help.# not a true champion
Gemor sangat pak arab nengok gusti
Congralations lucky punch❤️
I Don’t know about anyone but very good title matches getting interfered by someone that changes the result of the match is getting old! LA Night and Roman was a great match untill the interferences.
all the women look like power rangers without helmets
Boring roman the tribal cheat win boring to storyline
John starting going bald then decided to grow his hair😂 ridiculous
Und wieder mal bringt Roman nichts alleine źustande!! Habe ich schon vorher gewusst!!! Fazit es ist vorhersehbar  und LANGWEILIG!!!! Roman hat nichts DRAUF¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Samantha should be ring announcer 😂
WWE is too boring, it's all about Roman Reigns, there's no change, it's boring
Cody could have beat roman in wrestlemania yall just don't want roman to lose the titles
40 ads later , finally finished the video
La Knight's defeat was purely because there was help and that made many people disappointed
With everybody saying LOSER KNIGHT YEAHHH!😂😂
Did dirty on JC with a semi retirement march to rey losing to someone 25 years younger mistreatment of legends really
Pretty smart having Knight kick out of the first spear. Keeps him strong despite the loss.
That’s why he’s the champ ☝🏾🏆🥇🎟
Everyone tired of Roman champion because every match has been cheated
Cena fell off
Grayson nex miz
Arab Saudi seronok. . Palestin kena bunuh dengan orang Yahudi
6:11 i remember when Miz did the same think. He came out replaced Jericho’s show with Miz TV then Dean came out and Miz TV became Ambrose’s show and Dean gave Jericho a jacket 😂
Jeremy. Wright
Hold up, so the girl hits the other girl with her hair and it shuts her down? Wow this is so bad
Losing interest in wwe. So boring now. Always know Roman is going to win so no point in watching anymore
Logan use the brass knuckles that cheating
If these were really the highlights then I’m very glad I didn’t watch lol
Why does Logan Paul have a title after putting no work in at all
getting boring of storyline  of bloodline...theres no new..same content every year
Im glad that overrated redneck rock wannabe lost. I can't take him seriously. He's not a main eventer. Nothing original about him either and im being honest.
This is waste match always Roman Is Win
kairi sane is no longer the pirate princess she is the assassin
Welcome Back KAIRIIII (: Highlight of the night for sure!
Remember, he wont stop and he cant stop 💪🏼
why cena as white as sheamus?
Hey, wwe, do you remember when you was the biggest show on the planet? Yeah? Well when you was people didn’t have to wait for mania every four years for a title change  It happened on raw is war sometimes!!!   It happened on other ppvs   The championship has lost its prestige because you made it about the title holder and not the main event scene  Cody don’t need a title to be over til the day he hangs it up  La knight was the last straw A man who got over on his own and you put a man who’s career is marked with the wrong kind of heat over   Just when we thought triple H was gunna make a real difference to wwe we get this lame repeat of a match  You made knight look like a damned amateur in that match  He’s worked harder in a score of career than anyone on that damn roster the least you could have done is make him look deadly in defeat   Not fanboying for la knight at all But I’m definitely fanboying for the concept of f*cking getting over
i believe if iyo and kairi be tag team the combo finisher will be good
Cena with a goddamn choke slam! 😜 crazy!
Besides Shawn Michaels Jey Uso has a perfect super kick
Imagine that roman reigns needing help needing help to win
I wish Dom interfered with Rey's match to cost him but I am ok with this outcome. Logan will get some genuine heat though for the win and I am all for it.
Logan Paul won the US Championship. Great. Now you gotta defend it on a regular basis.
The WWE never disappoints
So, here's my thoughts on WWE right now. Rhea's title reign has been boring honestly. It reminds me alot of Dean Ambrose US title reign. She's more focused on the men's division (because of Judgement Day) than she is the women's division. Roman Reigns title reign is getting old and predictable. You know WWE only wants him to lose the title to Cody so having him face anyone besides Cody is pointless because you know he's coming out victorious. Plus the Bloodline is losing steam. Why hasnt Jade debut yet? Are they saving her for something? Cena seems like he's close to retiring. The speech he gave on smackdown where he even mentioned retirement and then the standing ovation he got at Crown Jewel, I wouldn't be surprised if there is a retirement announcement from him soon. I genuinely think WWE doesn't know what they want to do with Drew and Seth. TO ME Seth is having meaningless matches for the title, just for the sake of them saying he's a better champion then Roman. I just feel like whoever says "I WANT A TITLE SHOT" gets it now.
Great matches but i hate how the women are all dressed like Shinske Nakamura.
Next LA knight vs Roman in a no interference match would be good to see
well we got new US Champ now  The Half Time Job LOGAN PAUL Congratulations,
And everyone thinks La Knight going to win smh
Hai...  Romans title defense is always the same....  Sorry just plain boring and stupid
Knight should have rematch with Reigns in a cage match with all Bloodline members locked up in a small steel cage hung up 10 meters high...
Rollins into that Pedigree was awesome
Why exactly is WWE so committed to spitting in the faces of wrestling fans?
LA Knight is a one man army and seeing Jimmy Uso and Roman Reigns take turns getting beat up was like a Tom & Jerry bit lmao
Geed sucked..Buffered alot
John Cena has a Bald Spot
Roman's Reign becomes exhausting to watch. Even he's a heel.  Same predictable scenario—— wins by the help of his backups. Never fails to dissapoint.
This product has gotten so predictable it really drags it down.  It seems the only time any titles ever change hands is at wrestlemania and it sucks.  There are a few exceptions, but these title runs might as well be scheduled as an annual contest.  It feels like there are never any real stakes and everybody knows it.
Idk why wwe continues to keep Roman as the champion?! He ain't bringing in ratings he's never there it's the same old boring storyline. Also, they want to compare to Hulk hogan and bruno samartino, but they shouldn't because every title defense he's had the bloodline helps him cheat, so how is that dominant? He's more of a joke, but I guess it's smart to keep the title on him because they know people are going to watch every title match he has to see if he loses finally anyway boring same product. WWE doesn't care about what the fans want anymore or striking while the iron is hot. If so, then guys like LA Night and others would be on top instead of the same old guys.
kairi sane ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Really….Logan Paul…..guess they are just goin back to WCW days givin anybody titles 🙄
roman can't win without help 😂
So happy bianca lost. I absolutely hate her
Someone please tell me why cena is doing a chokeslam now?
You mean you took this bs storyline all the way to the middle east
Am i the only one here thinks Grayson Waller looks like a WANNABE Tommy Vercetti in Vice City 🤣
I think LA Knight should of won. Timing was perfect. Wwe should do a poll to see what main events matches they want to see at wm40. I don't think Roman vs Cody 2 would be on that list. And when is the last time wwe had a new superstar on their hands?
Not surprised with the rhea rhipley match, roman reigns, and John cena. If I was a betting woman, I would have bet exactly as those matches ended up going. So predictable 🙄🙄🙄 seriously wwe creative, please be just that, creative. Shake things up, please, disband judgement day, dethrone Roman, and check rheas ego.
Can we all agree that Logan Paul needs to go ahead and become a full timer. His potential to be a huge wwe superstar that can be the face of wwe is crazy
I'm so tired of this 2 bit chump champ let's get some real full time talent not a part time hack of Roman reings
Not Impressed with the whole bringing out  The Princess Pirate.. Not Impressed at All. Lame
My 8 year old son correctly predicted every match.
Worst PLE EVER all time
There are no women on the crowd. But they dont mind watching women fight
Prime sucks
Ple was straight trash
Main event was predictable as usual. It's time to do something different.
I don like Brock n his part time champ but atlest he can win at his own match but Roman just worst part time
‼️‼️‼️‼️13:35-13:36 barricade is already falling‼️‼️‼️‼️😂😂😂
Roman “never won a match on his own” Reigns 😴🙄 WWE is sooooooooo predictable
This the worst product I wrestling right now it sucks ill be taking a long break from this trash to predictable see you some time next year wwe y'all suck
Roman the goat !!!!    Bye bye knight
Hope that John Cena joins AEW 🙏
Can u update an install updates matches notification
honestly it was awful. was not a very good show.... now we dont see roman for 3 months amazing
Again Roman with his handicap match 😂😂😂😂
So it's ok for Logan Paul to win the title but not la knight? I rather see the reverse.
Sami ❤
Roman Ring 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cena’s bald spot 🫣🤣😭👀
Thats why i hate watching wwe now. Focus more on the entertainment than actual wrestling
Kairi looks like Asuka from Evangelion. 👍
JEY USO CLUTCHED UP
Roman reigns cant winon his own...L A knight is the true champion.....
Kairi Sane!!  DAISUKI!
And once again reigns wins via help of his cousin. Same storyline/outcome for over 2 years. Go figure.
i did not expect logan to win the us title
the judgement day security guard men
Meh.....
Now the US championship is part time as well
I miss how over Drew was during the pandemic. Man deserved better.
Be building up to roman losing his title its on the way
who noticed that logan paul had a title match at crown jewel twice in a row
Roman Reigns ❣️❣️❣️
This crowd was the best I've seen
Welcome Back Kairi Sane
I LOVE MAIN EVENT JEY USO
boooorrrriiing... WWE lets cheating scene all the time for premium show... ??
I told u Kairi Sane will be return❤
Grayson waller been spending too much time in bankstown “yallah yallah yallah” 😂
So tired of Roman Reigns. Let him lose already.
Who won between cena and solo?
Is it sad when I predicted every match outcome before they started? WWE is too predictable. It's pathetic.
Now put la knight, or stone cold wannabe, back to the mid-card where he belongs
I know he is a heel and i know the win wasn't clean but Logan deserved to win a title he is such a good Athlete
Great to see kairi Sane is back but when Randy orton are back?
what a Fkn joke! disappointed
Wow. Why wrestle when I'm coming back to next year's Royal Rumble season after defending like this in Crown Jewel
So Rey had to lose the belt out of everyone else huh even IYO retained
LA KNIGHT THE NEXT US CHAMP YEAH!
Wow kairi
Acknowledge Roman Reign s
All I’m going to say is LA knight had it he should be champ Logan Paul cheated as always I feel like they are letting this streak get out of hand for Roman. And Logan Paul couldn’t win a match without cheating it’s disrespectful af
So tired of this Roman saga its old washed up wwe you need something new you've had two amazing chances hope you noticed the drop in support behind Roman
The last clip showed the "incrediblenes" of Roman Reigns
Roman taking time off sounds like maybe next Match riyal rumble 2 1/2 months away. I say he can't add 75 days to title reign. HE Didn't FIGHT, HE Don't GET ADD TIME. HE'S GETTING TIME OFF. PLUS CHEATING TO WIN. I SAY LA KNIGHT PLAYS CHARLOTTE FLAIR A REMATCH ON MONDAY OR WE SUE WWE
Roman won again... yay...😒 I'm so sick of this, I swear I'm done watching WWE. It's getting old
As usual roman reign win again hahaha
Logan Paul knew he couldn't beat Rey Mysterio fairly. That's why he used them brass knuckles. A real cheater instead of a real defeater.
Seth needs to lose it he is boring now😊
ROMAN REIGNS☝️👹🔥 TRIBAL CHIEF
Cena doing a chokeslam makes me wish he had done that more throughout his WWE career.
WWE IS BORING THESE DAYS
Logan Paul stealing John Cena's entrance like he did with Shawn Michaels back at SummerSlam
KAIRI 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I couldn't even watch this on Binge app it was blury as and bad quality so disappointed
Logan Paul as US champion, 🤦‍♂
Roman Reigns Cheating champion
Always the same basic thing
Molto bello il video io sono un tuo grande fan WWE sarò acomprare federazione WWE
Did anyone seriously believe that after this long, Roman was gonna drop the belt in Saudi of all places?  Never was gonna happen.
Awful event
I also wish John cena would have won 😪😭.
Turning wwe off until Roman loses get boring now
Cena should have won. BS!
OMG WWE Crown jewels was absolutely insane loved all the matches and th it was crazy just wish Rey retained and is knight won .
I would love to see someone,beat him for that title
WWE IS STARTING TO BE A BIG CIRCUS WITH STUPID WWE CHAMPION
Had to cancel Peacock recently due to my current financial situation so this is the only way I’ll be able to watch Crown Jewel, thank you WWE 😂
Rhea's hair and make-up was absolutely fabulous!
Same old boring story.... massive interference and Roman wins again.... Yawn!
At least the women champions are entertaining, unlike Roman and Seth.
Roman and Seth are the two most boring, corny singles champions, male or female, of either company. I actually turn it off when those two come on now.
Worst ppv ever i seen 1 vs 2 or 3 why cant be 1 on 1 ? Really boring when 1 on 1 and later come to help
Sarkas wrestling 😇🤣

Sane joins Damage control
Como siempre... tienen que salir a ayudarle .... jjajaja esta comprobado .. No puede solo ... como seth freakin rollins o cody rhodes.. que ganan solo ... claro interfieren pero para alejar a los de demás.... pero aka ... lo ayudan a ganar 😂😂😂😂😂
씨발놈들 존시나 대우 개좆같이하고잇네 하필 밀어주는것도 좆도 노잼인 솔로자버나 시키고 에라이 개새끼들아
Triple H you should shame yourself, Drew Mcintyre needs more than that!
what an amazing ppv but truly roman should begin to win on his own just like gunther
Wwe please..... We're so tired of seeing the same old worn out roman reigns match with the same old predictable outcome.
I’m so glad I didn’t order this PPV. A bunch of terrible matches. Seth and Roman both retaining is ridiculous. Seth should’ve lost his title. His gimmick is cringe. He should go back to his black attire. Everyone knew Roman was retaining so there was also no point in watching that match either. The only ok thing that happened was Logan winning.
Am a roman reigns fun fun from his NXT,Shield,BigDawg and then TribalChief but we are sick of Roman Reigns' title reign. I mean we love the guy,he's a real good entertainer but his championship reign has now become one of those movie series U jst watch and predict wats gonna happen next... I think wwe should give another superstar a chance to shine on top and put an end to this boomerang..... No matter how good of a dancer U are,U must step aside of the dancing flow for others,coz if U don't your good dancing moves become shity as people start getting used at them.
Wow,Crown Jewel just make an update Just lighting&stage  lookalike Celebrity Hollywood Singer Concert.🎉🎉Nice WWE in Saudi Arabia The miz phrase always words say gonna be Awesome...
LA Knight didn't win the title. Wow, what a surprise...
❌️Jimmy uso
❌️Sami Swoi
❌️Roman Reigns
WWE 🖕🖕🖕🖕USO
Celebrate your tribal chief. *The sun arises cause he allows it!☀️😁💥*
Kairi sane returning...at crown jewel during bianca's match...was terrible...at least allow her return when the match was over.
Cena looks so white.
My favorite wwe  judgment day❤
Roman reigns won at last?
I’m telling you priest and Dom are going to LWO. Judgement day is either breaking up or getting new members
Wait, was Logan Paul really higher up the card than Cena or the WWE heavyweight title match? Who booked that?
Can we talk about Byron Saxton sounding exactly like Bobby Cruise from ROH
Logan Paul only wins fake fights
Roman's matches end predictably but he still does put on some pretty good matches
Wwe suck so hard   immer Roman reigns. So gut wie keine Titel Wechsel 😢😂 braucht man sich Garnicht mehr anschauen ohne Witz
Ohhh man I missed Crown Jewel because time difference between Malaysia and Saudi Arabia . Might watching it later if WWE network rewind it 😂
And had to help when was women
Didn't watch the last match. I like both guys just knew the outcome. Takes all the fun out if it
For three years well with you Roman a coward move his family to help win
I noticed that due to Islam that no cleavage was permitted to be shown.
Play with you the words crown jewel waste of money
LA Knight proved he belongs in the main event. He put on a great match. Him losing was known, but its so awesome to see how far he's made it. YEAH
Well guess damage  control  is now changing
Ground you ground ground rules
Let Roman win so he can get enough money to get the rest of his not tribal tattoo
Rey mysterio match worse match ever
Guess il google the actual results
This pay per view was ok, not the best, not the greatest but it was decent, predictable but decent..
Kairri is back
'Full' highlights but the miss out the match endings 😂
WWE has been garbage for the past decade lol
I hate roman reigns
Yes
F Logan
Garbage ppv
notice how all the girls had to cover themselfs up
McDonalds vs Sami Zayn.
What a joke
After the first match the crowd was kinda dead for the whole thing except for LA knight
John cena no longer serves in wwe 🤮👎
Easily worst PPV of the year.
Another boring ppv. God i hate Roman reigns. John Cena was just a work
Another boring, predictable Roman Reigns title defense...
No Women Allowed ...Think About That ZERO WOMEN
WWE is wack.
Boring…..no big surprises
Brooo!!! This is tooooooo predictable 😑😑😑
Reigns had to cheat to retain title
Disappointed of Roman Reings keep winning with help of his team.
Yeet ❤
knight so great
Acknowledge me ☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️
Guess rhea us the only JD member that can do it on her own, guess that us why she is in control. Why can't we have clean matches, romans tittle rein is getting boring, 3 yrs so wwe feels no one else is worthy of the tittle
Yesss now a new fued and beef plus I don’t think Bayley will be happy with iyo I think kairi wants to challenge iyo I want that hope kairi wins the championship and we should do Jade and bianca team yesss
This is why I pretty much quit watching. I’m so sick of this Roman Reins thing, it’s to predictable. When WWE starts loosing money because everyone is tired of this Roman Reins boring winning thing, things will change.
Saudi arabia shows sucks af
WWE needs to do a ple in Japan soon. 🇯🇵
Jey usos is thé best for his action
In my mind it’s gonna be either Cody Rhodes or LA Knight that’s gonna main event Wrestlmania 40 vs Roman Reigns
Vince comback you rapis..
Another extremely disappointing pay per view
ooh yeesss
This was a mid live event
Logan Paul is the next level of cheaters!!
WWE is trash 🗑️🗑️💯 now ,all my prediction was accurate, it's more of money for them now ,trash trash and straight garbage!!! Let's see what happen in Royal rumble!!
This was boring
Roman can't win tiis game without the bloodline😂😂😂
Oh yippee, they put another title on a part timer. Will WWE never learn that nobody wants wrestlers who only defend their belts a few times a year 😢  I'm so glad I recorded and then simply could fast forward through the show. There is no need to watch properly as you can predict what will happen and does happen.  We all know Roman won't lose until at least Wrestlemania, so you can expect to only see about one more title defence from him before then, given his part-timer appearances.
Yep cheated to keep his belt like always la knight is the champ hear
Never thought I'll see cena perform a choke-slam 😂
With that bruise on JD McDonagh he will be out for a bit...
The referees let la knight lose that match by letting jimmy uso keep interfering in the match without sending him to back stage ,wwe ripped of la knight
I literally skip through the whole show and all my predictions were 100% correct
Kairi my waifu!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
crowd really into it..lol..lol..lol
Allmost fourteen minutes of highlights ? Thank you soooooo much WWE .
Let the old finisher move stay with the legends you don't suppose to kick out the pedigree
these highlights suck, you cant even see who wins.
really boring ppv
mid event ngl
Reigns can't win without help it's time for a new champion
Because one part time champion wasn't enough for WWE, now there are 2! 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
So samy was over earlier this year....roman pinned him.....la knight  over now annnnnd exact same thing .....roman retains....no1 will remember roman as being a great champion
bianca got some booty some some some
I honestly was mad about this ppv. I dont know why i thought it would be different but i just knew roman was going to win and i was pulling for john cena to win.
Roman und die Bloodline ist einfach nur noch langweilig. Fickt die wwe
Mid
Roman Reigns you should wanna step down for a while man cmon do you think we wanna see another stale storyline you so stale now take some time away from the ring or something whos make the decisions what happened to actually wrestling atleast let another hard worker shine this roman reigns stuff is burnt out
Worst WWE Crowd Ever. Cancel this Event.
LA KNIGHT TALKED ALL THAT FAKE GANGSTA SHID HOW HE GON WHOOP ROMAN REIGNS BEHIND LA KNIGHT YOU SUCK MAN
Nothing new Show 4.0
Roman is officially the joke of WWE, I wonder how hes gonna explain his actions next friday..
Crown jewels was amazing.
I know the Saudis pay well. But please cancel Crown Jewel. I’ve never seen a more shittier dead audience in my life.    Even Indie events with just 20 people in the Audience are louder than these people.
Of course another garbage finish....remember when Jimmy said he didn't want jey to turn into roman....then Jimmy returns to bloodline....garbage writing
Really??? Cmon WWE you've run the hell out of the bloodline/Roman story now. Its time for change already. Getting close to just switching WWE off😴
Free Palestine 🇵🇸✊
Logan paul wins a title but yet La Knight still hasn’t gotten his 1st title yet… wow
Crown Jewel wasted Kairis return.
After today, I’ve seen enough. Vince or no Vince, the quality of WWE has gone through the basement. IDC what you kids say, that was the worst PPV I’ve ever seen. Maybe Cena should retire before he loses his legacy completely
Boo logan
Roman Reigns needs to be beat for real.. forget story line.  He needs to be hooked for this garbage.
Even with this loss I feel LA's stock just went up and that says a lot considering how damn over he is. He WILL hold a singles title in 2024. YEAH
Logan Paul cheated and used Brass Knuckles just to win the game
Im mot gon lie jd is impressive
Acknowledge Him🔥🔥
Can we get a long title run with someone that wins without interference? lol. Is that too boring bc it's scripted?
It was just a Saturday Night RAW
WWE should have left that idiot Michael Cole at home another event ruined by him
Roman, the man who wwe is shoving down peoples throats even though nobody is asking for him anymore. I thought just maybe HHH would have listened to the people, but nope.
What's with Logan Paul and Maverick??
If Roman didn’t have his little minions with him, he would have gotten beat by la knight
This show is like watching barnie the purple dinosaur
Today not god mode for roman..assist by bloodline..
Just stop roman winning like this it's became boring
drew should've won
Knight lost in the worst way than the rest of them 😑
Rhea is turning into the crow. Or better yet, “a raven”
People saying Roman obviously wasn’t going to lose is exactly why LA Knight should’ve won. Everything is far too predictable. When was the last time WWE had a truly shocking victory? Lesnar ending the streak?
man roman reigns its bad at getting hit act
Damn Kairi Sane is back 👍🔥
카이리세인복귀🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
No more PLE in saudi the crowd reactions were wack!
Logan Paul doesn't belong in WWE he is just trash and I really don't care about your opinions it doesn't matter
I know it’s stupid to say but I now see what Theory meant by bald spot not going anywhere 😢
The spear barricade spot is so over done especially with Roman
This Crown Jewel is brilliant! The stage creative is turn up to 100 here. This is on Wrestlemania level!!!?
ONE OF THE WORST PPV EVENTS IN WRESTLING BUSINESS HISTORY FOR MY OPINION, believe that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Seth Rollins carrying the company on his back fr.
Dead Crowd 💀
☝
WWE sucks I predicted every match winner and what would occur for them to win  Romans the worst champion ever in any wrestling history and has disgraced the belt and its legacy and his own by cheating 90 percent of the time proving you don't have to be strongest or best or most talented to be champion just have to cheat to be champion and that's all his title run will be remember by is a cheater champion ( Roman isn't in God mode he's in Cheat mode cause he's a cheater and that all he'll be known for )
Horrible.  You continue to let Roman stay champion with continued interference and you make Ray lose the title to a no -wrestler.  What does that say to the locker room.
Well it looks like Drew is on his way out the company 😢
I can see a Miz babyface turn coming, if you ever turn Miz babyface please give him a strong push so he can be like the man he used to be back in 2016
Don't ever expect anything good to happen Saudi Arabia it's a glorified House show
i want to join wwe
Stealing the case is stupid you cant steal someone's royal rumble win. Wtf
THIS!! PPV....                😂 😂 😂 💀 *PREDICTABLE & GARBAGE*
Why do you keep screwing over Bianca ??? And whats the point of giving the US title to Logan??? Just don’t understand..
Logan Paul?!?!??? WTF WWE
Worst PLE of this year and worst Crown Jewel ever.   Tribal Queef absolutely sucks
Clown jewel.
So after having 1 part timer who is a world champ, we will have another one. Nice
I knew LA knight would lose but it's the way he lost,they built him for 6 months as a different kind of challenge but to bury him here this way wasn't creative at all
Logan Paul champ time to stop watching
this crowd was so meh lmao
Now we need to say thanks to sami
trash dude fr this entire event was so depressing
Great, another belt that won't be defended unless it's a ppv.
OMFG KAIRI SANE IS BACK!!! I LITERALLY JUMPED UP WITH EXCITEMENT!!!! <3
I wished randy ortan returned it would've been one of the greatest returns of my life
I wish they showed the ending to each match
Triple H sucks period... his match are predictable
Kairi looks great! Great return!
Another snoozefest crown jewel was tbh everything was predictable tbh other then sami taking the case and kaira returning
Roman reigns y'en a marre. On en peut plus, on en veut plus.
Full WWE crown jewel highlights???? 🤔
I find it truly amazing, how for an entire event, I can just look at the entire crowd the ENTIRE time, and see how they're not giving ONCE SINGLE response for the entire thing.
I really wish the official would have caught Logan Paul with the brass knuckles,someone needs to teach him that what goes around comes around. The women’s match was so cool I wonder if anyone is going to take the title away from Ripley . I am definitely looking forward to war games .
So tired of the bloodline story ruining things for the fans. Solo got like 3 moves and no personality. Logan Paul is just new miz. Drew should just join the judgement day. Be the “leader”. And I can promise you that the way wwe just cut the legs out from under LA Knight isn’t something this character will recover from. Stupid.
WCk PPV
Crown Jewel💚 estuvo espectacular y se me hace que Sami Zayn va por el título de Seth ❤
Siempre ganando Román el petardo Reigns con ayuda de sus esclavos vendidos
What happened to Carrion Cross is he injured or they let him go?
5:15 Cena Doing What He Did To Kane A Chokeslam To Hell
Where is Dom
Did anyone else catch the CM Punk chants during the show
Who else thinks the pedigree should be a finisher? If it can't finish a match it shouldnt be used at all.
Someone take the title from Roman, we need something fresh his reign has been long enough!
Wow…Roman Reigns won…who could have seen that one coming …? 😒 See you in 3 months for the 30th title defense. What a reign!
The Japanese Powerhouse 👏👏 Asuka, Iyo & Kairi 🔥🔥🔥🔥 🇯🇵
Bayley came to saudi arabia wit the whole entire bakery on display
I watched with my GF who hasn't watched in a while. I told her the outcome of every match before it happened with an accuracy of 100%.  Try harder WWE, this is getting stale. The only things that furthered any sort of narrative were:  1. Logan Paul won the least interesting title. 2. Kairi Sane came back. Bit pointless flying all those people to Saudi when nothing actually happens.
thanks wwe
Sami pulled a Dean Ambrose frfr
Absolutely awful
Terrible highlights reel
Drew zu JD ?klingt spannend
Roman reigns have cheat all the time
Come on guys at least give cena a win :(
Terrible Highlights....don't even show all the pins! Skips around and doesn't show key moments! Poor.
Who else is tired of Roman Reigns?😂
so glad to see kairi! that elbow from the top rope is still the best in the business :D
that bald spot on John Cena though.... lol
🇺🇲👑 The Bloodline 👑🇺🇲
Was this match at crown Jewel too? i had no idea .
Isso já foi bom.
Why is Cena losing so much now 😂…. It’s like he’s having too payback all his wins
So boring
Iyo shy  cheat too
My Seth's mediocre title reign continue until nobody gives a damn about the title he is supposed to be bringing prestige too instead of hogging it to himself.
Logan Paul cheat
Good pay payr view
S.i.p Bray Wyatt
This afternoon was lit 🔥🔥🔥🔥☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾
Roman Reigns sucks balls
roman no merece el titulo solo gana con trampas lacayos u objetos
I want to see zilla fatu vs solo
With kairi sane, iyo sky, and asuka in an alliance, these three will dominate the women's roster.
Great show
I missed kairi sane!!!! But I wish it would’ve been done on a different ppv, would’ve gotten a bigger pop 🥺
logan paul entrance was fire
Crown jewel was a successful and surprising event man
It's discousting victory by Reings, i will block wwe for myself.
Give John cena his run again yall do him so dirty
Yawn Roman Reigns blah blah blah. Lamest garbage run ever also easy to tell they're in the middle east, all the women are dressed to their necks lol
All the hype for noting la knight 🤦‍♂️
Who won
I dont like it when champions lose their titles for 88 days like rey Mysterio Logan paul you cheated
Who won
The worst ending
Astagfirullah what they made of the land of PROPHET MUHAMMAD (SAW)..
I've always loved Wade Barrett!
Not gonna lie this ppv was really lackluster.  The matches were all mediocre and a few had the wrong winner.  Definitely a disappointment.
Can we all agre that LA knight vs Roman reigns was way to short
Incredable matches , watching from Solomon islands as a great funs of wrestling, hope One day wwe will give me a previledge to come and watch any of great matches. Lastly I wish wrestling should be promoted as well here in the Solomon islands as well
women decently dressed ... i love saudi
WWE has hit rock bottom to sign Logan was 1 thing but to bring Jake in and let him win a title it's a joke what are they thinking 🤦🤦🤦
I think damage control is gonna split and bailey is gonna turn on iyo sky
CM PUNK CM PUNK
🇸🇦=💣
So stoked Kairi sane is back
As usual reigns can't win without help! Why don't they ban EVERYONE from ringside. Reigns is not a real champion.real champs do it alone!!
with her hair like that,Rea looks like Dom 🤦🏾‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love kairi sane❤
It's nice to see  WWE  support modern day  slavery
Crown jewel sucks!! I'm glad I didn't pay for it!!!
Except Cody and Logan’s win other match outcomes were too disappointing
This video was completely useless.   No clue of who won anything.
Congratulations to both RHEA RIPLEY and ROMAN REIGNS retaining their respective titles on Crown Jewel  MAMI Rhea is still the Womens World Champion and the Tribal Chief Roman Reigns is still the Undisputed Universal Champion 👑👏☝🎆👏🎆☝👏👑  This year Crown Jewel is 👊🔥
seriously can roman reigns have 1 damn match that he doesnt have to cheat to win????   3 years and it still takes someone elses help to win....can you say cheater???
Incredible event. I just wish LA had won.
Saudí crowed sucks lol
Jimmy getting his head bounced off the table he aint been that woozy since he got behind the wheel drunk.
I said it, the tribal chief ain't going nowhere. WWE should just admit that they don't have any recent wrestler who can challenge Roman. Every potential threat have their own title to defend. LA wasn't thinking straight to go for the big gold. At least he could have started with Logan's title
Logan is actually good he need a new gimmick now
Cena vs Sikoa brings back memories of Cena vs Umaga
The tribal cheat
Great watch this tonight show with everyone our favorites male and female wrestlers... Congratulations to everyone...🎉🎉🎉👑💚💜💛
Hello Roman reigns nothing new everything the same, without help he does not win,  WWE: It's Got To Stop  That he can only win with help
I’m a little upset Sami ruined the cash in. This was Priest’s time.
I like how every match just ends with the bloodline coming to save Roman 😑
Roman deberia ser jefe tribal mas de 2000
WE NEED NEW FACES FOR THE TOP TITLES. Seriously WWE. Why so easy playing hot potato with the US and Tag titles? Afraid to replace former Shield members as your top guys? It only shows you don't trust others to take over. Stale runs are finally here and they ain't looking pretty.
Awesome another part time champion 😂
Balor is the dylan mulvaney of wwe
another boring predictable roman finish zzzz
Crown Jewel was not what I expected because it's just like watching Raw and Smackdown. Every week all you see is cheating and bulls**t, which is getting pretty boring just like watching Roman who got beat by John Cena and others. I would like to see Roman defend his belt one on one with the bloodline banned from ringside, and if there's any interference, Roman loses his belt.
I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE KAIRI SANE BACK THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU
Get leady to wark the prank.. Kari sanes back
Damn Cena is not aging well
So Roman basically pins LA clean in the middle of the ring? Yes, there was interference from the bloodline, but….⚰️
The U.S title actually suits Logan very well but disrespecting a legend is crazy
Kairi Sane is back
Waste of money on matches that nearly all had interference and now has two part time champs that is making wwe lose fans all the hype yet all big let down no wander aew and tna gaining fans who wants a part time champ for 4 years
Ok solo did his thing ❤
Whenever Roman has a match, the bloodline always interfere.
Damien should have cashed in
is the comments section just full of sycophants or bots? really hard to tell🥴🥴🥴
Fxnkin hunter.
Am I the only one who wants Drew to turn into a heel 😭😭
Rhea Ripley is fckn bad
So sick of Roman cheatin we know y’all wanna just make him relevant until next February where he breaks the record
9:07 Logan Paul winning the US Title is the highlight of my day
When will Roman stop getting help.😭
Reheas face painted up like a goth clown. Lol
JD McDonaugh stole Camryn Grimes move
And obviously there's the on going with John cenas loosing streak, people think it's a bad thing, ok a win here and there maybe in a tag match. And as great as some people think John Cena is, we all know he's getting to the end of his time, and he's been a massive part of WWE for years. He's putting over so much more newer talent. But he does need a win soon just because it might or might not ruin his credibility.
Better crowd than half of usa crowd.  (Except for hometown boy or girl )
Mark my words, Logan Paul will try to sell people NFTs of the US Championship.
Sammis gonna be the one to end Leukemia boys reign.
WWE Crown Jewel Never Disappoints
That Saudi Arabia crowd was electric tonight 🔥🔥🔥
8/10 PPV new champ , a return , false finishes and bangers
It's nice to see the WWE supporting Saudi Arabia  (a country where SLAVERY still continues) What am I saying?  Of course! Why am I surprised. USA loves slavery 🇺🇸♥🇸🇦
of course roman wins by cheating again lol typical
predictable
Think drew MacIntyre needs to turn full heel in a rematch with Seth maybe because the judgement day are in his head and wins the title. He can then have a monster run for like 7months fighting with his conscience the while time, but he does what he can to win (cheat etc) there is a few opportunities here and before anyone comments yes the contract situation is common knowledge
This Crown Jewel Main Event was amazing! 🔥👊
Congratulations winners
WWE just edit out that LA BFT and 1 2 3 then jimmy put roman leg on the rope,is just a botch from ref
I’m upset that Logan Paul won the United States championship smh.
Kairi sane holy shot
Ok
So we have 2 smackdown champions that only wrestle at pay per view events looks like I’m going to bed early Friday nights
Bruh talking tuff and at the end he lost roman ☝️
Roman is good as “product”, not as “wrestler”
There was some parts of this PPV I enjoyed but the part I didn't enjoy was the fact that LA Knight was fed to Roman
Survivor Series WarGames! Bloodline and Judgement Day vs Cody Rhodes, Jey Uso, Sami Zayn, AJ Styles, LA Knight, Seth Rollins!
I dont think anyone is suprised roman won
A ok ppv
Why we all know what is gonna happen  in Roman's match but we all get hype for it every time .
Reigns retains the title against Knight: Yeah! Solo beats John Cena. What a night for the Bloodline ☝️☝️☝️
Present 1 minutes
2 minute gang 👆
