Pepe was rubbish today, even before he was sent off, he was offering absolutely no protection for Bellerin who was having to deal with overlap, after overlap while pepe was strolling back. I've been calling out for Pepe to be started but we now know why he's not
Arteta is out of his depth. People should already see this by now
Lee, have you tried using Iqos? Its pretty good and much better than a conventional Cigarette.
Good rant mate, realistic supporter
Yeah blame Pepe but forgive Xhaka right? I Hate this fanbase..but I can’t change clubs now.
Forza PSV
Time stamps?
A good manager would get the best out of players he's got. Look at Klopp at LFC, he wanted Ismail Sarr at LFC but were put off by the price tag, but he didn't give any excuse he bought Jota, who was bang average player before he went to LFC and now he's performing like a WC player.
Mate hes not only got job because hes white mate
big up to you lee keep up the great content, gutted we didnt win
Time stamps?
Siraj Khazen 😁
Lee. That was a great livestream. You and Chig were far more entertaining than the game that finished 0-0. You and Chig made a lot of great points tonight. Big love and respect to both of you 👊❤️
Willian was punished Lee - he got picked to play 😂
Lee, you got 35K+ views today! Thats amazing!
If arteta cant fix the team.  RAFA POCH  ALLEGRI They need to look at these managers
🐀🐀🐀
These two are made for each other!
The crossbar saved us today Lee. Coneman was spared a big L by sheer luck.
Hand balls have been given for less this year.
How can AFTV blame this loss on pepe when we had no attacking possibilities, arteta is clearly out of his depth, “trust the process” bullshit when we have no consistency, he has to go
You smash Bellerin when he is poor. He made the run and pass of the game and crickets from you. 😆. You're agenda shines through again.
You can blame who you want. The facts are Arsenal has no creativity in the midfield. Cristiano could be up front and the situation would be the same. Aouar and or Szoboszlai are essential.
LEE KEEP SPITTING FACTS! AFTV ARE A BUNCH OF FAKE MUGS!
Seeing how 2020 has been a crazy year, imagine this scene   Tottenham - PL winners  Arsenal - relegated to the championship   Arsenal are playing relegation football so anything can happen, just putting it out there as a possibility
The only three players who actually think a shît about the club is gab tierney and saka
Lee calls ceballos shit then asks 'tell me if this team is shit'. Off course it is shit, pepe just cost us the game and you want his on the right. The day arteta starts to manage his players and we play shit, hez out.
Arteta is hands down now one of the worst manager I have ever laid my eyes on. 2 weeks to sort that absolute shite out and we just serverd up another absolute fucking horror show of a performance. He can blame Pepe all he wants, we were shocking the entire match. He then throws him under the bus in his post match interview while he then starts Willian for breaking lockdown rules? Get the fuck out of our club you fraud.
Get this manger out
Arteta out simple
You can’t blame Pepe when he does not get a run of games and Willian does when he contributes nothing.  Pepe will leave because no matter how well he plays he just gets benched for the next game, Arteta out, Rafa in
No open play goals in last 5 games
Son has scored 9 goals equal to the whole Banter FC, let that sink in,, the Dinosaur has been resurrected COYS 😀
Pepe cost 70m.  Arsenal record signing.  Let that sink in.
Arsenal have turned into prime Stoke
3:02:45 Quality rant and roast till the end
2 pricks
Red card 2:03:30
We got a point with 10 men , the performance still shit but the result is not that bad
Our crossbar was the man of the match. We would have won if we had extra two crossbars replacing Wilian and Pepe.  PEPE is not normal. I have said it, the opposing team pays his weekly wages, so he plays for them against us.  Thank God we haven't paid completely for him. We should tell his former team we don't want him again. They can go with the money we have already paid and take him back.  As for Wilian, I am very sure Arteta plays Wilian because he gets free food from Wilian's restaurant. That food will purge him soon.  SHAMBOLIC PERFORMANCES WEEK IN WEEK OUT.
Artea is a fraud we are so embarrassing I’ve not seen Arsenal this bad since 1995/1996
If wenger had this team the results would have been better. When will Arsenal get a proper manager. By the way Wenger was wack by 2013
Tapas pulis is garbage
