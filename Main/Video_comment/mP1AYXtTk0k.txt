But when you're waved you hit my main line Hmm Girl you know I'll always make time When you wanna smoke and get high Anytime you hit the Facetime I'll roll one, we can catch the same flight Hmm Don't be afraid to say that you love me Girl it's okay, you don't have to be low key Don't be ashamed to say that you need me Show me your pain girl, I'll raise you up quickly Don't be afraid to say that you love me Girl it's okay, you don't have to be low key Don't be ashamed to say that you need me Show me your pain girl, I'll raise you up quickly You know You say you've seen some better days But all that changed when I'm with you Baby tell me how you feeling Hmm Is shit the same when I'm with you? So baby hit me up when you get the chance When you need love come take mine Been around and I've seen shit Trust me girl, we on the same side Trust me girl, we on the same time Hit me up, we'll exchange minds You can hit me up on that late night I don't mind losing some sleep, keep me energized Girl there's more meets the eye, no need to lie We both know you're a freak, you just in disguise Don't be afraid to say that you love me Girl it's okay, you don't have to be low key Don't be ashamed to say that you need me Show me your pain girl, I'll raise you up quickly Don't be afraid to say that you love me Girl it's okay, you don't have to be low key Don't be ashamed to say that you need me Show me your pain girl, I'll raise you up quickly Baby something ain't right Always trying to hit the brake light Saying fuck love, you wanna waste time?

Lovely song ❤🇦🇱
Try to make a love song with a romantic video instead of one that is promoting gun violence and stealing. My best friend was shot and killed last year while walking home because some chavs like you wanted his mobile phone. Fucking bellend. You have to be really stunted to think this video even matches the song. Loser.
My kind of vibe 🙌
Under rated Your music is fantastic x
He's gross
Copied from Kamal Raja's song
wooooooooow
it's on repeat!
what a beauty...that M3 convertible man
This was shot at my uni wth

1:26 man said middlesex uni LOOOOOOOOL dont kill me pls
best song out no 🧢
Best song + video he’s done!!  💜
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why is my man promoting this road life? Damn thought he was wiser than that. Dope track and visuals but it's dangerous promoting such to the young and even to these deluded elders who think doing road is a way of life and all this drill stuff. Open your mind. Travel the world.
Think B Young will just make singing on Drill even more mainstream now. This song was lowkey the best on the album 💯
PLEASE DO A VIDEO TO LIGHTWORK.....!!!!! BIG TUNE
Babe Babe Babe 🥵😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Love the song
e Truth, the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Him. There is no other intermediary. May Jesus Bless you, trust Him, give your life - and He will take care of it :pray Convert yourself and believe in the Gospel - Romans 10 8-10 But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,” that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim: 9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.♡: Please read Revelation, the Whole Truth Is Contained in the Holy Bible, Ps 62, Mt 6 24-34**♡*
Man this guy brought out the whole vibez man!!!! Much love God bless ❤️

Baby suttin' ain't right Always tryna hit the brake light Saying fuck love you wanna waste time But when you're waved you hit my main line Hmm Girl you know I'll always make time When you wanna smoke and get high Anytime you hit the Face Time, I'll roll one we can catch the same flight Hmm  Don't be afraid to say that you love me Girl it's okay you don't have to be low key Don't be ashamed to say that you need me Show me your pain girl I'll raise you up quickly Don't be afraid to say that you love me Girl it's okay you don't have to be low key Don't be ashamed to say that you need me Show me your pain girl I'll raise you up quickly You know  You say you've seen some better days but all that changed when I'm with you Baby tell me how you feeling Hmm Is shit the same when I'm with you? So baby hit me when you get the chance When you need love come take mine Been around and I've seen shit Trust me girl we on the same side Trust me girl we on the same time Hit me up we'll exchange minds You can hit me on that late night I don't mind losing some sleep keep me energized Girl there's more meets the eye, no need to lie We both know you're a freak you just in disguise  Don't be afraid to say that you love me Girl it's okay you don't have to be low key Don't be ashamed to say that you need me Show me your pain girl I'll raise you up quickly Don't be afraid to say that you love me Girl it's okay you don't have to be low key Don't be ashamed to say that you need me Show me your pain girl I'll raise you up quickly  Baby suttin' ain't right Always trying to hit the brake light Saying fuck love you wanna waste time But when you're waved you hit my main line Hmm Girl you know I'll always make time When you wanna smoke and get high Anytime you hit the face time, I'll roll one we can catch the same flight Hmm

Stole frome NAVI - Feelings
I dont get the video story line
You guys have any other underrated artists to recommend? Just found this guy and he's just too good
I can honestly say his one of two artists I've fanned over ever that isn't part of the old school generation just him and pop smoke but with him I just go soft and mushy and with pop smoke its more bad girl energy so b young is like red wine and pop smoke is like cocktail and shots
I love this 🔥🔥🔥
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Where s the drill at?
THE DEADMOURS RECORD 🤔🍒🍓🍇🌶🥥🍍🥑🌽🍌😎

I saw a bus going to London Bridge  Station. Liked it but that gun shot was shocking.

Not gonna lie no more words needed for this one. This masterpiece is a vibe in it's own for sure & yes you are a living brand no doubt about that. // Coming from a (latino) adopted from Colombia who lives in Sweden. Just wanted to comment to say thanks for making the best music that will be on repeat for many generations to come also btw.

Wow😇😇😇😇🕺🕺🕺💖🤗
Kevin Gates once said "I nolonger make music for myself, l make it for anyone who is in a hard situation🖤⚓" thats the most gangsta statement l have ever heard in my life and Byoung has understood that philosophy.He is making music for us not for himself, he makes it for us who are in trying situations , the struggle is harder to an extent we taking nacotics to numb the pain but Byoung'S MUSIC   is what l have been taking in lately and l can safely raise a middle finger to the rehabs, therapists and everyone else who does all those counsellings,WE HAVE ByoungFOR THAT.  Thank you so much MR OKAY from the bottom of my heart, keep doing what you are doing, big love to your mom and pops, they raised a legend.YOU ARE A GENERAL🖤⚓📌 ALL LOVE IF YOU ARE READING THIS, YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS, THIS IS THE PERFECT DRUG💊💊 Differences IS A MASTERPIECE.... lIKE IF YOU AGREE WITH ME
