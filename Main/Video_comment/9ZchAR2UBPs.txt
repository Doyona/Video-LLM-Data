It's really funny how Thessa went from "one of America's best new chefs" to "one of the most notable chefs in the world" throughout the judging via continued exaggeration xD
Not Keith with the self-sabotaging tomato-soup flavour! 😭
holy crap those macarons looked good
In New Zealands native language of Māori French people are known as Wiwi's
I used to be a chef, being far removed from the industry now I love watching this chaos 😆
why does no one just write down the instructions at the beginning adn then just do it, like have the chef give them all the instructions and write it down, if they're on such a time limit, that's what I'd do 😂
I love Marissa so much, I would so ask her out if I lived in California
This thumbnail made me laugh for waaaay too long-y'all's expressions were great!😂
2:58 So real! I didn't know that was a thing for like 3 years.
That Adderall comment wasn't a good look.
“He said I was going to use the thing again! 🤯”
For anyone watching this nowadays, Tomato Water, and I just recently found this out, is what you get when you scoop out the gooey insides of a tomato and pass it through a strainer so there are no veggie chunks or seeds in it. It has the most concentrated tomato flavor in the whole fruit and has a LOT of umami [AKA MSGGGGG (Uncle Roger 😉)]
Fuck me.... an 1/8 inch is 3 mm. How did Americans decided ...yeah, let's split in 8, or 10..... or 6... when you have the metric system...
3:04 the echo they put on her scream is crazy lol
Keith about soup macaroons: Only I can and only I will!  Do you know why? ...cos they taste horrible! hahaha
Lmao, the fact that they introduced Marissa as "to her" instead of "an idiot"
To this day, I have no idea what the hell tomato water is.
I love the guest judge sm
marisa got on my damn nerves in this episode
Notice when Keith doesn't make Daddy's Favorite, he blows a gasket. Kind of similar to how he blew his dad growing up. I know I'm pushing it with my humor, but nobody mentions their parent as much as he does. It makes me believe that it wasn't a very healthy relationship. 😅 Sorry
Something so wholesome about Jimmy's laugh
I CANNOT believe Keith and Jonny didn't win. Keith ACTUALLY MADE A MACARON!!!
To be fair to Keith, Macarons and everything made with almond flour is indeed terrible
If Keith had used tomato paste instead of the reduction he'd be safe
😂😂😂Keith just hates sweets
😤so frustrating watching chefs trying to spit words out and just talk slower
Marissa has 100% little sister energy. She's just everyone's younger sister.  (She also just reminds me of _my_ younger sister...)
Why is he not playing magic the gathering?
"multiple soups" CRYING
5:56 Rachel really is the try guys mother
marissa is so right because truly what IS tomato water?!?
JIMMY WONG JUMPSCARE WOAH
Jonny is my favroite try guy!!!
2 chefs one oven is the cruelest part of this show
Keith started to become his soup macaroon at the end lmaoo
Jimmy was legit in his mind: "no f***ing way the try guys made this"
You'd think they'd stop just adding random shit when they don't know what to do next. Like bruh can cheese really?
Love it
32:39 has me cracking up MULTIPLE SOUPS🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Marissa in the kitchen is the best thing, Keith did so good with the macarons. I love them competing together
Marissa, cant open a lid: RACHEL!!! Rachel: im rooting for you I think Marissa had something more practical in mind 😂
Love the way Keith says "pipe a wall with cheez whiz!"
That font is not Creat.
i support keith's mutliple soups !!
Keith at the end cracked me tf up 🤣🤣🤣🤣
“You know what I’m making?? MULTIPLE SOUPS” killed me
jimmy is such a great judge. love seeing him in these videos!
I'm back here for the third time.....watching again 😂
13:26 something holy???
Keith at the end made me laugh so hard!!!
the amount of times they overmix on this show
can we bring back this judge i love her energy
This is my favorite show to rewatch
(I say this with such respect, trying not to be weird) I feel like Nick and Marissa would be an adorable couple. Like this whole episode felt very quiet, straight laced guy is stunned and then completely enamored by the bubbly manic girl who shakes up his world.
I like how in every ep, no one knows what a saucepan is 😂
nick needs to be brought back on, he matched the energy of everyone soooo well
I actually like this better than WAR 😅
I bloody ADORE Johnny!
Nick is sooooo hot
11:38 how can you be an adult and never-ever fry stuff??? Did you had like maids growing up?? Did you never like wanted chicken nuggets, but your parents said "we have chicken at home" so you cut the chicken and make your own nuggets?? Sunnyside egg? French toast? Anything? Damn.
Nick needs to come back 😂😂
i'm obsessed with jimmy laughing at jonny's loss HAHAHAHA
But what is tomato water????
I would really love seeing a series where Jonny dedicates himself to getting, like, solid baker rep. Maybe not a Michelin star, but I'd really love to see him learn and grow and get over feeling inadequate around other chefs. I think that would be satisfying as hell to watch.
ANGRY KEITH IS MY SPIRIT ANIMAL
24:51 yes, grandmas do taste like lavender LMAO 😂
keith helping marissa was so nice
i kinda feel for keith a little on this one. i know him having a fit is a bit, but macarons are very hard to do in general, let alone trying to attempt to make them in this kind of environment. so i can kinda see how he'd genuinely might be a lil mad about this one.
16:17 Love how you can hear Marissa's frustrated scream in the background
I like Marissa in without a recipe but she was soooooo annoying in this.
nick kind of looks like a yassified jared popkin if you ask me......
they should switch places with the try guys. chefs cooking what zach and keith want them to make with only their directions. i think that would be equally entertaining
free Palestine
Keith turning himself the color of his "soup cookie" just shows his level of commitment.
She’s right! I don’t know what tomato water is
I wonder if the dudes will read my suggestion: this is the 2nd phone it in I’ve watched I was hopingggggggggg the game the chefs played would be diff per episode it’s FINE but just my thought
I love when renowned chefs say they love a "fake food" like cheeze wiz or blue raspberry. They aren't real food but so delicious.
i love how marrisa kept turning the heat down LMAO
Marissa yelling at Rachel everytime is golden XD
I couldn’t stop laughing, this is the best. The format is great, this group was great, and omg the dishes were great, I’ll gonna try to make them ngl. Thank you!
I really want to see an episode of this with Gordon Ramsay or Guy Fieri or something. I feel like that would be legendary and hilarious.
How am I the ONLY person confused by the videos title?! It’s not a macaroon episode, it’s a flour episode…..
Marissa is me when I panic anytime I’m cooking with any doubt 😂 Just try anything and everything that could possibly make it better 😂😂😂😂
All I heard was arugula
Phoning it in idea: the chefs remaster a failed “without a recipe” dish
The editors did Marissa WRONG with the echo of her AUGH from the intro 💀😭
TRY Guys should DEFINITELY have their own platform (like DropOut TV with Sam Reich) to organize all the different shows!! But I'm super thankful that this is free for us here ♡
One of my favorite episodes 😂
Love this series
Love marissa want her in more videos
Marissa makes Kwesi and Jared look like seasoned pros.  😂  I love it.
Jonny in spirit has definitely become one of the try guys at this point. And Keith blowing up over his creativity being brushed off is what I live for.
I absolutely LOVE this series!!!
Marissa, you go girl!!!!
That is by far the BEST looking macarons from Keith!!
Marissa is so cute
4:00 having time management be important paired with someone who has ADHD is cruel lol
I didn’t know a women could be so dumb
rewatching this and i forgot how hilarious marissa is, can't wait to see her on the next WAR!
please tell me I'm not the only one who thinks they look like Lin Manuel Maranda
I missed this series and now I find myself binging it
I can't be the only one who thinks nick kinda looks like a cooler/more hipster version of jared popkin
I absolutely love this series!! Wish they did more of them! 💜
"MULTIPLE SOUPS!" 💀
Is Bagel Boy back??
You should do idiots coach chefs but they can only do what they say
I smell like lavender because i have lavender rub that helps me with panic disorder and im absolutely destroyed when jonny said grandmas taste like lavender 😭 im 23 🥲🤣
Not a fan of Marissa ..
Not them BOTH adding cheese whiz unprompted 😂
Am I the only one who doesn’t like Marissa? 😂
Marissa maybe leave the meds out of the recipe
Poor Jonny give him a W he deserves it!
Why is the caption, they make macarons if one of them doesn’t 😭😂
I love this show so much <3
The ending editing misspelled rugelach! It says rucelach, on the intro card and on the “should look like” image
Ok but nick and marissa were such a silly pairing 😭 I want to see them again so badddd they were STRESSED LMFAO
More Marissa! She's hilarious 😄😄
Marissa is giving me so much anxiety but I also feel her on a spiritual level
Maybe Keith is a Jinx lol😂
27:28 Jonny be death staring 😂
Rachel calling Marissa darling 🥺
Watching new chefs on this show confused and panicked by novice bakers and Jonny just smiling and leaning back (13:12) is hilarious and also adorable, Jonny needs to be on every episode of this show
I'd love a timer in the corner during the cup and ball game because I feel like it would take me multiple days to get and I know they cut some for time but it looks like they do it pretty fast
Nick is so damn fine!!! Haaaaay daddy lol
hilarious ep as ever but i just wanted to say tessa has the loveliest smoldering eyes! and her voice is so smooth too 💞❤ loved to hear it
The banging boom music scared the sh*t out of me. I thought I had to call 911 for a minute. I was just trying to do homework while watching vids
Please. Make. More. Of. These.  I am not at all your target demographic but these can please ANY audience.  Especially those with *cough* French pastry experience *cough*
13:12 I just love how Johnny looks like a high school kid calling their crush :’D💗
I love that in every cooking episode where Keith blows up, he gets redder and redder per episode. His outbursts are so cathartic for us who can't explode like this irl 😂
The f ck is a tomato water im dieing 😂😂😂
This is the first time I watch Phoning it in and I LOVE it
Ok but that’s not Swiss meringue buttercream. No Swiss meringue was made in that kitchen
When I heard Jimmy I had to make a double-take, because since last time he was on Try Guys I've listened to Dungeons and Daddies and I wasn't expecting Freddie's brother to appear in a cooking show :')
THE MACARONS ACTUALLY LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL THOUGH
Still to this day dont know what tomato water is.
beep beep
I want to see Miles or Rainie on this show
Why not give instructions that would take like, ten minutes to do, then call them back in ten minutes? Spend two minutes giving instructions, that would save eight minutes to go towards the more difficult parts of the cooking/baking.
It really felt like marissa should have been labeled 'the idiot' and Keith the 'him'
As someone with adhd that has forced myself to learn to bake, I really commiserate with Masrisa in this episode. My first few times following recipes from YouTube videos went pretty much exactly like this. It took about 7 years of doing it on a regular basis for me to feel comfortable in the kitchen and not have a meltdown from forgetting a step or ingredient, but I’m a pretty competent home baker these days 😅
Johnny needs to remake those tomato himself, it's unorthodox, but I'd like to know if it can be improved by someone that knows what they're doing.
I love her ❤😂
Side Question: Why aren’t these in a playlist? I’d like to watch them al without having to search. First world issue-but still.
MmmmmmUlTiplE SOupS 😂😂😂😂
Posting another comment as a fan of Marissa bc I have seen too much negativity towards her! YES to women with big personalities - I see your Kwesi, I see your Johnny, let's balance that energy with this ADHD queen 🎉❤
Lovedddd this episode, maybe the best of this series! Please bring Marissa and Nick back in !!!! They were both awesome presences
Keith getting vexed, and yelling at the end of the episodes he does y win is the funniest shit ever 😂
Marissa's ADHD was working on overdrive, like asking someone with ADHD to multitask with an overwhelming amount of information going in, I felt every bit of her suffering.
id actually really love to see Keith make multiple soup flavored macarons
MMMMULTIPLE SOUPS!
who is this annoying girl
The fact that Keith always wants to help no matter what even if it’s a competition is just so darn sweet 😢❤
To be honest, what the fuck *is* tomato water?
The chefs shouldn’t know who they are working with next time haha
Keith and his freaking tomato soup macaron 😂
Petition for Jonny and Keith to always be paired together for this
As a girl with adhd I immediately knew what “ mm mm “ meant 😂
This is hands downs my favourite season to watch lol😂
Video Idea: Pro Chefs compete at who can make the best tomato grilled cheese macaron. Whosever's is the least terrible wins >:D
I too, am Marissa... 🤣🤡😅
Chef Thessa is fantastic, invite her over next time please ❤️
I loved this episode. Had me laughing the whole time. Go make soup macarons keith. We all trust you!
The silent commentary is my favorite part
31:07 LOL Nick pretending he made the pastries was hilarious
I love Marissa screaming "sABATOgE!" every three seconds
The *very* quiet "howdoyoufeelaboutthis" said by Thessa during the judging is hilarious to me because it just feels like a strong attempt at hiding initial judgment, while utterly failing to hide the emotions on her face   And then Jimmy just following up with "it kinda tastes AWFUL." 😄
Keith should of won!! They looked perfect!
this is probably the most calm episode of this series ever, i feel so relaxed watching it for no reason
I love Keith and I root for him all the time but his reactions whenever he loses are so friggin hilarious that it lowkey makes me root against him just to see him lose his mind 🤣
Marissa's lack of common sense is just grating
Her turning up the oven Keith was using and telling him to fuck off and use the other one 🙄😂
Best video yet!!!😂
Okay to be fair, genuinely what even is tomato water. Also. The adderall and ADHD situation? Relatable. Painfully relatable.
I still don't know what tomato water is 😂
This show is so fun and it's honestly AMAZINGLY impressive how well they manage to do. Like bro look at those macarons? I gasped
That woman has the voice of every stereotyped nagging wife. Please good Lord, never put her on again
Famous last words: 'IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER IF ITS BAKED' -Keith Habersberger 2023
cheese wiz just being in the kitchen is sabotage
This is my personal opinion, but Marissa was not it for me.
"MULTIPLE SOUPS" has got to be my new favorite Keith moment
“Next time we do macarons, you know what I’m makin’? Mmmmultiple soups.” These episodes have me crying 🤣
Can you do an episode with The Icing Artist?
i am IN LOVE with Marissa
Lmaoo Nick and Marissa were great additions to this series, and I'll never get tired of Keith's losing meltdowns 😂
We’ve all seen 1/8th inches… right? Like we’ve all thought “poor guy” right?
The way i gasped when the vanilla spilled 😭
*A pizza-rugelach appears*  'Do you have Italian roots, too' 'No... But' 'Say yes.'  This one killed me😂😂😂
“Your paint is really bad”    “What?”  “I said best coffee I’ve ever had”
The fact they dont have to break the egg and get the egg whites on their own is cheating imo
Dude, Marissa is so annoying I feel like she tries way to hard to be funny
Angry Keith is back 😂
How can you not FRY!!?!!
11:16
Is it just me, or does kieths Macaroons look like the colorful krabby pattys from spongebob
This is the show that needs to be on Food Network.
Oui-oui like the cartoon character? Good team name ! Oooh next time Keith should do a little guillotine shaped pile of fruits on top of the macaron 😶
Oh how I missed Keith’s end-of-video meltdowns
i loved when the guys give the real.chief's anxiety 😂😂
marrissa is so annoying 😭😭
MULTIPLE SOUPS! 😭😭😭
The funniest thing to me was Marissa using the microplane to zest that way haha  I’m impressed at Keith being able to even get as far as he did
Keith's becoming a soupervillain...
I resonate with Marissa so much
KEITH FREAKING OUT IN THE END HAD ME DYING I WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND I WAS STILL LAUGHING AT “MULTIPLE SOUPS” LIKE SERIOUSLY I WAS LAUGHING FOR LIKE 5 MINUTES STRAIGHT
Marissa is an incredibly entertaining competitor on this show, MORE OF HER
I low key want justice for the macarons, only because the flavour develops as a macaron sits  for a few days normally so honestly they probably would have been better in a week, not good, because they are wet, but more flavourful
Jonny and Keith. Perfect duo.
I went to Paris to learn how to make French macarons by professionals.They literally said not to use French merengue and use Italian merengue because it's idiot proof 😂 Keith did it with French merengue
I’m sorry but Keith deserved this win
Seeing Nick and the clip of the bagel  episode of Without a Recipe he was in reminded me of his business partner's line from that episode. It was the best line in that episode, if not the whole Without at Recipe series:  "I think you should pursue other means of honoring your father."  😂😂😂
Starts at 3:15
Marisa was hilarious! Keith was very sweet to help her in the kitchen. This food contest format is great. These poor chefs must be so frustrated cooking blindly through another pair of hands haha
Saw on Tik Tok that if you heat an oven to 200ºF and put your macs in there with the oven partially closed, you can leave them there for ten minutes for a more developed crust. I do that quite often and it's not bad. I do 300ºF and ten-ish minutes 'cause I'm impatient and like the resulting texture, but yeah. 200º or 225ºF at ten-ish minutes.
Annoyed with Nick constantly giving Marisa shit for not knowing how to do things. Girl not everyone deep fries in their home kitchens 😂
Marissa is the epitome of medicated ADHD: somewhat organized chaos. :)
Think I fell in love with Nick. Damn.
I love Marissa. She has lots of personality and fits in with the try guys really well!!
I am SO PROUD of Keith in making macarons. He’s not trained at all and in the weirdest setting and got so close!!! It’s a feat!!!
LOVED theresa as a judge! An instant icon.
Funny how Keith and Johnny were wearing the colors of their chosen macaroons
Keith needs to make French onion French macarons
Was eating soup when Keith screamed 'MULIPLE SOUPS' and with that, a singular soup almost came out of my nose lmfao
Props to Keith for making macarons just by verbal instruction! Here I am at 5am making macarons almost thinking my meringue was ruined because it was too runny but it actually needed to be whipped faster
Very excited for the continuation of the soup macaron saga
We’re gonna hold you to that promise Keith, I can't wait for multiple soup macarons 😂😂😂
keith’s macaroons look like the pretty pattie’s from spongebob 😂
Johnny Cakes is my favourite part of _Phoning It In_ .
I wonder if the tomato soup macaron would have been better if Keith had used cream cheese instead of sour cream 😂
Jonny: “That looks Iike a murky hot tub.”
recognized the bagel guy from a worth it episode
Listening to this while working and all i can think is jodi foster, jodi foster, jodi foster
Keith won in my eyes
mmmmultiple soups!!!
That was so ADHD. I feel heard
It would be cool to have them drop quarters down a peg board and whichever ones land in their space they get to use
I'm catching up on episodes after like 3 months and I must say I almost stopped watching that Marisa chick is annoying af 🤦🏾‍♀️
Love Jimmy Wong, I heard him on Dungeons and Daddies and was just so happy about it! So glad he goes across so many of my favorite shows!
the macaroons remind me of pretty patties
Keith successfully made macarons and that’s pretty damn impressive for a non-baker
i’m glad they understand that we want johnny cakes in every episode
Omg the Adderall sweats 😅😂 Marissa I FEEL YOU.
I’m here for Marisa and Nick’s second date
keith started stressing
Like, KEITH, the macarons! They look so nice, presentation on point! Wow!
At this point Johnny loosing Phoning it In is Try Guys equivalent of Ryan loosing Puppet History 😂🎉
Johnny reminds me so much of Garrett watts!!
I love how as Johnny is confidently explaining his dish to the judges, you can see him side-eyeing his co-chef to get cues on what to say.
Great video! Anyone else think Marissa kinda looks like Aubrey Plaza?
Love the show but that girl was very obnoxious.
Love how Keith knows what he's making and Johnny knows as well ..yet they call it disks:))(
Please never stop making this series
marissa mentioning the adderall sweatiness was the realest, i feel so seen and represented
Marissa again please
SABOTAGE
The moment Keith added the tomato that was a lost for me 😂
Nick  saying I'm so talented had me laughing sooo hard!!!
The moment of Marissa's reminiscing is so cinematic dramatically edited lol
Maaate.... as a chef... that chick is PAINFUL to watch... and listen to... not to mention her flicking her towel around a pot full of hot oil that could do some serious damage..... eeeeeek!!!  Hashtag anxiety THROUGHTHEROOF!!  don't use her again lol
Absolutely LOVE Johnny. He is amazing. Everyone did a great job.
Bruh keith stop pushing your tomato and cheese fantasy!! It never works! Lol
This is my favorite try guys series
as a chilean jewish italian person i feel represented 😊
MULTIPLE SOUPS 💀💀💀
Why isn’t Marisa in more videos?! She’s fucking hilarious!
And Marissa actually using a ruler to measure everything was so great🤣🤣🤣
“Until we can come up with something else; they’ll be playing the cup and ball game”🤣🤣 I feel like there’s so many other silly games they can play too
The way Marissa kept calling out for Rachel reminded me of the newer Without a Recipe episode when Keith said “mom,help” when he needed Rachel’s help opening a bottle 🤣🤣
I fucking love her 😂
Omg I'm dying. Always a pleasure to see Angry Keith and them trying the soup cookie was too good. I also have never heard of tomato water lol
I'm sorry, Americans have cheese in a spray can ?? How is no one commenting on this
SABATOGE!
uarters 8:45
This is a great show.
petition to make Johnny a recurring guest on any/all Try Guys series
It’s the “I’m so talented” dude Nick is hilarious 😂
The duo I never knew I needed was Marissa and Nick 😂 Marissa yelling SABOTAGE and RACHEL 😂 Nick and Johnny explaining their cooking pivots 😂 DEF my FAV!!
my soul LEFT my body when I saw Shane
jonny was robbed
cant wait for keiths multiple soups
Can we have johnny in all episodes of phoning it in? Pleaseeeee
This alongside without a recipe has become one of my favourites segments from try guys
Thank you for your honesty Marissa. I love it!
Most are only talking about Johnny and Keith, I just want to say I also like Nick's chill vibes
Justice for Jonny
Jimmy wong!!! From dungeons and daddies fame (and tons of more important things I suppose)!!!
I love phoning it in but what I really miss is candid competition. I know you say it didn’t do well but it was my favorite! Please bring it back
Omg I love Nick's "mmhm I'm so talented" hahaha
What's a saucepan???!!! Head in hands in Hackney 🤣🤣🤣
Keith was given a much harder task than Marissa. Still great!
it's ok keith pretty people don't have to be talented
please don't put her in anymore videos ..
Justice for Johnny! Those macarons looked incredible, so pretty and such a huge improvement from the without a recipe versions!
Keith should have learned from the Without a Recipe episode that cheese and macarons don’t go together 😂
marissa representing everyone w adhd rn 😭😭
What if the chefs have them instructions the whole time, but through like 30 layers of google translate 😳
Keith kills me!! 😂🤣
This show as a concept is already amazing, but forcing the cooks to treat the dishes like they made it in front of really accomplished chefs makes it top tier
Damn Johnny 😭😭
Can jonny cakes be the 4th try guy????
I Stan marissa! LOVE her energy! As a LONG time watcher I greatly approve!👌
They called kieth an idiot in the intro and Marisa just her kinda weird
Who is marissa and how did she get on this show.   It’s cool that they bring different characters in, but shouldn’t someone at least know what a saucepan is to get on this show? 😂
Justice for johnny 😊😊
her taking her adderal and sweating is the most relatable shit ever lmfao
The amount of chaos there would be if this was in reverse and the try guys were giving the professional chefs instructions on there recipes they make at home.
I was laughing the entire time 😂
JUSTICE FOR JONNY!!!!!!!!!!!
23:29 AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
I won't lie, I'm tempted to make a soup flavored cookie at home now
That "MULTIPLE SOUPS" got me 🤣
I liked it better when it was just the try guys in phoning it in.❤
The multiple soups took me out 😂
“Honestly….. that’s above my pay grade.” 😂🤣😂🤣😂
This is my favorite try guys show. I'd love to see this reversed. One episode of the pro chefs desperately trying to follow the worst advice.
Johnny is a staple in this show
NEXT TIME IM MAKING MULTIPLE SOUPS!!!! 😂😂😂
An idea i had watching Phoning it in, a Phoning it in without a recipe hybrid. So In the kitchen you have two- three professional chefs, perhaps johnny cakes and mythical chef josh, and on the phone we have say Keith and Eugene and zach if we went for the three people. Keith and that are then given an exotic dish something they wouldn't have had before and perhaps a pixelated photo and or a vague brief description of the dish and a list of 30-50 ingredients then the chefs must follow a recipe made up by keith etc on how they think that dish would be made (if that makes sense)
MULTIPLE SOUPS
MULTIPLE SOUPS
This is rigged. How does Johnny keep loosing omg
I love that y’all basically make tv series but they’re better bc they aren’t ruined by a streaming platform
I am sooooo not a fan of Marissa’s frantic “help-me” pixie vibe. As much as I love the Try Guys, this episode was hard to watch.
Just like. Keep inviting Jhonny. Make him the fourth try guy.
marissa reallyyyy knows her tablespoons from her teaspoons!! hahah LOVED the energy in this video (:
Nicks “I’m so talented 😢” was so good
The love I have for Jonny is insane
Sorry to say, I had to quit this after she laughed at Keith. Bad choice of a guest. You should have had Emily from GMM.
The seriousness on Keith’s face when he just says multiple soups kills me 😂😂😂😂😂
This is by far my favourite episode! Go ADHD go!
Incase the comments already didn’t make it totally clear…We the people can’t get enough of Jonny!!!
Incase the comments already didn’t make it totally clear…We the people can’t get enough of Jonny!!!
Nick was taking it so seriously, it was hilarious
This was one of the most entertaining cooking shows I've ever seen!
“And I’ll pick orange and tomato soup” 😂😂😂 I cantttt Keith
Johnny giving heavy squidward vibes
Please have Roy Choi giving instructions on the phone.
correction, Keith fixes French macarons
Try guys without a recipe is better
Every time I watch one of these I love it! 😁
Multiple soups
Me within the first couple seconds of Marissa’s intro: oh she has adhd like me! This is either going to be the best dish ever or going to come out with a new chemical warfare method.. There is no in between.
Wow 😂 I loved the dynamic with this 4. Bring them back 💜
Macarons are supposed to be the Pretty Pattys from spongebob
JUSTICE FOR JOHNNY WTF HE DID SO GOOD
nahhhhh they're just doing this to keep johnny on now - that was a CLEAR win for themmmmm did you SEE those macarons?! sure they were mushy and tasteless but they looked so PRETTY! give the lad his win and still keep him as a show regular i beg 😭😭😭😭
I just want Johnny to lose so we can have him for the whole season
Can we have more of Marissa? I think I'm in love with her.
Marissa! How have you never fried anything before!??!! How do you not know what a saucepan is??!  I'm so confused. Like how do you eat? How are you alive?
This is such a good show. I love the pro chefs trying to pass off the food as their own.
the upside of Jonny not winning yet again is that we get him for more episodes!!!
Food network should buy this concept lol
Keith saying he didn't want to shock the maroons was soo funny lol
keith raging and turning red in the end is amazing
the way shes so skittish has me on edge
marisa is so funny in this lol "we're gonna be frying? like airfrying????"
Sorry to say this, but am I the only one who found Marissa kind of annoying in this video? Both Keith and Marissa are big personalities but it's funny on Keith and is kind of obnoxious on Marissa.
Johnny just can’t
Wheres Nate?
Imma be honest I really thought Johnny had it in the bag on this one!
The chefs trying to bs their way to explain isn't that far off from what happens in the kitchen tbh 🤣 so funny i love this more than without a recipe
Nick's "Mmm yes, I'm so proud of myself,"  had me rolling
Please don’t bring her back.
are you guys stopping two videos a week 😢
One of the original four Try Guys is in the video. Is this even Try Guys anymore?...
I lost it when he said "MULTIPLE SOUPS". Why is that funnier than  anything Keith had ever said in this lifetime? HAHAHAHA
i am so excited for keiths soup macaron saga to continue
As a viewer from France, this was horrifying and I am LIVING FOR IT. Please keep destroying French food, Try Guys, this is hysterical.
I live for this series! It's so awesome and I always love Keith's freakouts 😂
Bring back nick the his subtle sass was appreciated
Keith is such a trooper for not just straight walking out the kitchen the second he realized he'd have to make macarons again lmao And he ended up helping Melissa a bunch too haha
Istg let Jonny win one please i feel so bad 😭
I thought they both were going to make macarons. I got confused when Melissa was doing a dough. 😂 I was like "wow, a new way of making them"!
😂😂😂😂
24:10 😌💅
Who is Marissa and why is she the cutest
My brain very much dislikes this narrator's voice.
This is probably my favorite series.
Jonny and Jimmy are both so delightful
I just wanna say that the macaron without a recipe inspired me to try baking them when i only knew how to bake chocolate chip cookies. Proud to say i've made some successful batches!! Thanks for trying it
Only having one oven is giving big “single ice cream maker in the Chopped kitchen” vibes
Obsessed with this series!!!!
Can't tell if kieth laughs like Zach. Or Zach laughs like Keith 🤔 😂
They’ll never let Johnny win cause he’s the star of the show
Poor Johnny l😅
JONNY AND KEITH WERE ROBBED!!!!!
My favourite episode of this show so far!  Keith is a national treasure, and I am 100% Marissa in the kitchen.
I really loved marissa in this episode!! Although I do kinda feel gipped that there was only 1 fry guy in their big series like this. I think it should be known that we’re mostly here for our 3 bois, too many guests and you’ll lose the heart of what we’re all here to support
Honestly though I was very impressed with how well Keith's macarons turned out. And it was so sweet when he was helping Marissa with the induction stove lol
omg I felt so bad for Johnny for losing again lol. He and Keith might have won if Keith had not deviated from the original plan and made his tomato soup and grilled cheese macaron. The girl was so relatable though while cooking and I love her energy lol
MULTIPLE SOUPS!
I appreciate how Keith is introduced as "an idiot" and Marissa isn't 🤣.
I want Johnny to be on every episode of phoning it in.
Poor Mr. Cakes.
Melissa being a hot mess is hilarious...and yelling Sabotage and Rachel! 😂
Pssst...Keith--you forgot the  basil. That's why they didn't like it
Love the quarters obstacle for the phoning in chefs!
MmMmUltIpLe SoUpsSs 😤
I think Keith is getting too good to be on this show lol
Jonny must be part of try guys by now, we want him!!!
They should have a phoning it in all star series during the summer
“Multiple soups” got me
Jonny Cakes should officially become the 4th try guy 🥰
"As always or at least until we come up with something better, the wheel of mayhem will determine how many quarters the fates allow."  Why did I laugh so much at this line
Not really the try guys... it's the try guy, Keith
Keith is so good at enunciating like I honestly feel like I can hear is voice in my head as he’s mouthing the words lol
Ok but seriously, I REALLY want the Try Guys to do a tomato soup and grilled cheese Macaron challenge now. Or some of the guest chefs anyway LOL I REALLY want to see someone do it, take it seriously and make it taste good too!  Also feel bad for Jonny for glad to have him around still LOL
I'm LOVING the fact that the Try Guys/Try Staff are getting badass female chefs to judge these shows! ❤🩷
A collab btw GMM and the try guys would be awesome!
Poor Johnny
I love this series. I love Johnny
Imagine biting into a broccoli and cheddar macaron. With little pieces of broccoli in the feeling 🙊
why did jonny tempt fate with that messed up Daedalus and Icarus allusion at 16:40
MULTIPLE SOUPS
I feel like Rachel is just a professional mom, like she's a mom of twin girls at home and then she goes to work and is basically just the mom there too🤣
I 100% want to see more of Nick on the channel!!!
I read try guys ruin and just started laughing. This is just great!
Keith at the end screaming about soup😭
I looooove angry Keith 😂 wow what a treat
As someone with ADHD, I feel for Marissa. This would give me so much anxiety.
I'm gonna be honest. I feel Keith and Johnny should've won. It didn't taste bad and the only one that did was the soup. And Keith failed miserably before with them and he proved that he has done way better this time. So I feel like they were jipped
You should get @sideserfcakes
I don’t understand why they have the chefs pretend that they made the dish during judging. Just have them all together. They already know what’s going on.
18:45 Didn’t Johnny have one more quarter in his hand???
Love the Improve  show that is the judging.  Waiting for Keith to perfect the tomato soup cookie
I can't get enough of Jimmy's infectious laughter. Him and Johnny are two of my absolute faves! More of them please!
Loved this episode. Try Guys should do a series alone on Keith's best angry moments and his reaction to them. FYI: I saw the compilations of Keith's being upset on WAR and I always wanted to see  Keith's reaction to those moments.
im kinda sad about jonny. i wished him win already, it was really well executed
When he says that’s above my pay grade, I feel that on so many levels at work 😂
What a fun series!
one of my favorite series ever on this channel.
I wanted to see Keith try his soup cookie!!!
so this is just a part 2 to without a recipe macarons for keith
I love angry Keith so much.
Poor Keith....he made the most difficult cookie on the planet to make and he still lost 😭😭😭
The repeated "sabotage!" phrase is super annoying. Less Marissa plz
Okay but the way Keith just swooped in there to help with the gas stove is so wholesome. Like, competition be damned big bro Keith is here to keep everyone safe and having fun.
This is without a doubt my favorite series on Try Guys. Kudos to the idea-person and all the participants!
I'm still kinda new. Where are the other 2 guys like Zach and Eugene and who is this girl?
I LOVE this series omg
I hope Keith continues to try to make tomato soup macarons in every challenge until they work
This is a systemic attempt to break Johnny’s psyche
Though it during the bagels without a recepy, think it still... Nick is HOT
Omg is Johnny going to be on everyone phoning it in? His sass gives me life
Nick saying “you know what? My memory actually escaped me” was the best lol love him
The online recipe:  Heat to 350 degrees  My stove: I can give you 6 or 8
I don't know why they did not put two ovens in that kitchen.
I get way too much second hand anxiety to watch the chefs try to pass of the food? they’re given as their own.
Keith cracks me up 😅….when he loses he also loses the plot.. poor guy can’t just catch a break in these dessert making episodes this was extremely hilarious 😂🤣  P.S I would love to see Steven Lim as a judge on Phoning It In or Without a Recipe he still hasn’t been on this channel! 🥺
I honestly thought Keith had this in the bag 🥲
Rewatched the macaroon without a recipe and Keith did tomato soup there too!
Hopefully my sickness will disappear after watching this
Omg, Josh is cursed
new try guys era is on fire this is so good
I DO want to see good versions of the soup ones though. I think like... french onion soup and miso soup would make good macarons
Keith has inspired me to throw a soup party and make macarons to pair with every kind of soup
I can't wait for the next episode
i guess i missed it, whooooo is the other girl??? kind of ruined the episode for me by trying soooo hard to be funny. coming off as super pretentious
i am so desperate for them to play d&d with jimmy and freddie wong like with the whole dungeons and daddies crew it would be so amazing
how did kieth make almost perfect macarons and still not get the win?
Keith made those macarons look so good! And I absolutely love the idea of a bagel and lox rugelach. Honestly thought Jonny was finally going to get his win, but congrats to Nick and Marissa for making a tastier chaos!
Keith's macaron journey has been beautiful to watch...he's come a long way
johnny on a losing streak 🎉 keep it up king 🥈
The production quality of these is so good- better than a lot of food network/netflix shows
thessa teling nick to just say yes is so funny
i think you should give them more time so they have time to properly cook the food to give them a proper chance but that’s just my personal opinion
Without a recipe macarons. Gauntlet thrown.
Omg Marissa gives me anxiety..
I just want Johnny to win one. I was so proud of Keith's macarons until they bit into it. 😶
Apparently, "tomato water" is the transparent yellow-ish water that seeps out of tomatoes.  To obtain it, you're supposed to chop tomatoes into wedges and just let them strain into a bowl, allowing the "tomato water" to drip and collect without the pulp or seeds. No average home cook is gonna know wtf tomato water is.
Keith macaroons looked beautiful. One day the tomato and cheese soup macaroon will work 😂
After a few seconds of this , I said I ain't watching some gay men acting like women cooking. So sick. 🤦🙏
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀☠️
I love this series
MULTIPLE SOUPS
"M U L T I P L E SOUPS" is what got me 🤣
well i for one can't wait until keith makes a clam chowder macaron! (i love this show so much)
Im sorry but kieth wins they didn’t like how hers tasted at least they semi liked Keith’s. His macarons are impressive
I hope that vanilla Keith spilled was vanilla flavor, not actual vanilla
Keith looks like a creepy uncle that has candy in a white van
Please give us macarons multiple soups
Nick absolutely must come back
The captions are different from what's being spoken :(
Kieth ended up looking like tomato soup by the end of this.
"YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA MAKE? ... MULTIPLE SOUPS." 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Please have Kian and JC on!!! They’ve been calling y’all out lol I would love to see that!!!
"...you know what I'm making?  *Dramatic pause*  Multiple soups!"  Oh, i laughed a great deal.  Wonderful job.
I hurt my stomach so bad from laughing at Keith’s outburst. I lost it when he said I’m going to make multiple soups 😂😂😂😂 omg goodness Keith never disappoints 😂😂😂😂
she's so clueless i couldn't help rolling my eyes and shaking my head
Can someone tell Keith about Pani Puri? Closest thing to a soup cookie I can think of
sx
I love thé half inch thick green onions
M U L T I P L E  S O U P S
hi big fan
Im rooting for you Johnny!!!
Marissa, you sweet angel 😂 please be in camera more 💗
I forgot just how amazing Keith's rants were since he's been winning so much lol. I just love that Jonny knew it was coming and felt like he had to warn the new judge.
I would totally try Keith’s soup macaroons! I once screwed up my recipe when I made normal ones and my stepfather renamed them “muckaroons” 😂
Yeah, I don't think those peaks were stiff enough... now I really want to try making macarons  Edit: after seeing the results, all I can say is nevermind. Those look fantastic
"Time management is of the utmost importance"  Me, a person with ADHD: 🙂 so I've got some bad news for you
I know this is weird but Nick sounds a lot like Nathan from Drawfee. Like EXACTLY like him.
that girl is so annoying bruh like why r u jumping around and screaming
I’m sorry, but how did Keith and Jonny not win?!
Why are we having people say they just took their Adderall so they are feeling great? On a show that many children and teens watch? That probably could have been omitted from the show. Jesus.
Johnny was robbed!!!
MmULTIple SoUps!
Wow!!!
GIVE MY MAN JONNY CAKES A DAMN WIN.
😊
24:14 as the representative of the swiss people, i just wanna say, we love you too jonny
Loved this episode!! Honestly I thought Keith and Johnny would finally win, loved to see Marissa as a new participant of the series❤️❤️
im so dramatic bc i gasped at the typo around 8:45 lmao
Keith being ENRAGED whenever he looses is what I live for
Mad keith is back❤
Nick being super calm made me feel calm despite how stressful this series is lol
Johnny has become my favorite! Anytime he's with the try guys you know it's gonna be an amazing video!!
These are always such fun but stressful at the same time - and come on, you have to get two ovens, there are already so many detrimental factors to achieving the goal, at least give things a chance to cook through. 🤣
Keith continuing to try to push his tomato soup cookie & failing kills me 😂
HAHAHAHA Marissa is awesome
Why is Marissa literally me in the kitchen hahajsjsj
Johnny and Josh?
When I saw the cheese whiz I just couldn’t resist
Johnny cakes and click
I vote for Jonny to be permanent on this channel!  Such a wonderful and lovable personality!  💖
I truly thought Johnny Cakes would have won this one
How is that possible that she had never fried something before?
I feel so bad for Johnny I surely thought he would win this time. Are these games rigged??
I think Keith deserved the win for making pretty good macarons. Just slightly underbaked.
Love this series
he made PASSABLE MACARONS
Get Uncle Roger on here!!!!!
I love this show so much. I never though they would make a baking/cooking show that I would find equally as entertaining as Without a Recipe, but this is SO holding up. I hope they don't take the comparatively lower view count as a a sign to stop it
I feel Marissa got such a hard recipe for someone who doesn’t bake lol
Oh I can not wait for MULTIPLE soups!!
Keith actually did good here tho! This series just keeps getting chaotically better and better, I can’t wait for the next one 😆
It was going great for both chefs until Keith found the cheese whiz...
“You know what I’m making? MUltiple soups” 😂😂😂
MARISSA!!! Love love love
Get ready for a fucking clam chowder macaron!
SABOTAAAAAGE!!!!
Good this series is genius.
Next time they should have the guys on the phone and the chefs in the kitchen
I love everytime Marissa says “Sabotage!!”
I really enjoyed Nick and I hope he comes back!
I love how Keith can keep a straight face through the yelling at the end, even when everyone's laughing so hard 😂
Yoooo they got jodi on!
Alternative title: cheese whiz w/ pro chefs
Y’all better have Johnny win before or for the finale. Cause if not, I’m unsubscribing. THOSE MACRONS LOOKED FREAKING PERFECT. IM SPIRALING LIKE KEITH RN.
im actually genuinely confused as to how half raw dough with seasonings on it won over decently done and well cooked macaroons with an assortment of flavors.
Nick stressing about the simplest things going wrong while Jonny is lounging in the other booth with his legs crossed 😂
Is Marissa Maggies sister?
Honestly, those macarons were amazing looking compared to last time on WAR. Keith should be proud of them. I demand a redemption series for all their food crimes, where they get to redo them all in a head-to-head to try and make them better... or worse
Johnny & Keith lighted up my day 😍 ; but Marissa and Nick represent me 🤣 PS: Johnny deserves a win!!!
They must really like Jonny being on this series bc there's no way he didn't win this one
Omg Marissa. More Marissa!
Johnny must always come back until he wins and even after
I love these videos so much, they are so great chaos! Yeeesss.  Also love that Keith had to do Macarons again.   Also Keith going 'multiple soups'. Oh god. Please do!
I would love to see a Marissa x Kwesi match up in phoning it in! Pure chaos
I love the neurodivergent representation 😂
If Johnny never wins can we keep him on forever??? He makes this show
The chefs having to pretend it's their food at the end is hands-down the funniest part of these videos
Nahhh JOHNNY WAS ROBBED ‼️‼️
Nick remaining calm is the best
It's funny how Johnny still didn't win.
Can we like let Jonny win for once? Like please
Love this series ♥️
I like the Keith and Johnny duo calm and kind energy so much
Damn, I dislike her, can Zack please come back??
Rooting for Jonny, but do i believe he will win? No, absolutely not
Keiths own redemption 😂 he knew right away
Yay, we get Marissa!!! ❤❤❤
you have no idea how badly i want jonny to win at least one of these
BUT WHAT IS TOMATO WATER
I ALWAYS love seeing Johnny on the channel. Would love to keep seeing more of him.
More Google/YT "Heated" or "Cooked" videos pushing their agenda on an unwilling society.
oh my god I love this shit!!! The fact that the chefs have to talk about it like they actually made it makes it so much better.
Marissa is super annoying lol
Johnny is never winning this because they want him to stay in this show for as long as possible.
man, at this point just make Jonny an official member of the team lol he'd clean up in Without a Recipe
God I love this show 😂
Not Keith slowly turning into a tomato while screaming about his tomato soup macarons
No one cares get off the internet
That... was... AWESOME!! I love this series, the pros and the new contestants, their chemistry HITS!! Yes, just yes, over and over again.
i feel bad for him but i kinda don’t want jonny to win so that he will keep coming!
I realized once  the video was over that I was laughing out loud on a full packed bus 🤣😭
Is it bad that I want Johnny to keep losing because I love watching him in this series? 😅😂 I love him 😂
kinda want zach & marissa in one eps, bcs it would be soo chaotic
holy crap i cant believe jonny and keith didn't win LIKE HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE 😭 SOUP COOKIE FTW 😭❤️‍🔥
I never smiled from ear to ear this much in so long 😂😂😂😂 I love this show !!! Never stop
I really enjoy these episodes 😂
Hey keith here’s some inspiration: chicken soup, cream of chicken or cream or mushroom soup, tortilla soup, broccoli cheddar soup, split pea soup, black bean soup, cream of potato soup, navy bean soup, beef barley soup, minestrone soup, chicken gnocchi soup, vegetable soup, French onion soup, pozole, chili, lemon orzo soup, fideo, squash/pumpkin soup, zucchini soup, ramen. 😅
Don't think she was a good candidate for this show. Seems like a huge handicap for her team
“Multiple soups!” Had me dying😂
Actual question but why does the title have French macarons if only one team is making them?
This is truly my favorite series so far. So fking wonderful.
Who is the girl Keith is competing against? I really like her!
deposit uarters
I loved Marissas energy from start to finish. Please bring her back
this show is gold
Nick and Marissa otp
I love these so much 😊
I LOVE these!! So entertaining!
Try guys should do croissants
Keith's soup cookie rant was amazing ❤
Who is Marissa and what's her relation to the show? I liked her in this I just have no idea where she came from or who she is
Chef Nick’s cute 😜
i hope Johnny is in all the PII episodes! <3
I wish they did this where the judges don’t know that the chefs didn’t actually cook it and the chefs have like a ear piece where the “idiots” can talk to them while they are getting judged
I LOVE this series
This show but the guys give instructions to pro chefs
Marissa is a whole vibe
such a fun format:) UNHOLY WHOA KEITH :0 ...I'm so sorry...you should;ve won
I DIDNT THINK NICK WOULD WIN AT ALL??
This is the third episode they've done with macarons, so I'm glad Keith's experience got to shine through. In fact, didn't he-who-shall-not-be-named make a tomato based macaron in that first episode?
Who the heck is Marisa
Never thought lavender would be called a smell thats signature to grandmas 🤣 ive always thought that it's a mosquito repellent smell, cuz grandmas usually smell like cajuputi oil and jamu (health potions)
Why does Keith act like he doesn’t like this chick lol
Marisa belting out "WTF IS A TOMATO WATER?!" when they're supposed to be silent absolutely cracked me up 😂😂😂
why is the titling off for this series? is it an engagement thing??
Lmao😂 Keith got immediately offended
I also did not know what tomato water was 😂
i can't even explain how much i love hearing jimmy's laugh. it's so contagious!!!<3
I want to see the reverse of this where the pro chefs cook something the non-chefs describe/walk them through!
*Keith being disgruntled as soon as he hears almond flour is my favorite thing*
anything: *goes wrong * Marissa: RACHEL!!! SABOTAGE!!
It really seems unfair that there is only one oven. They should probably change that for fairness
This video is pure gold, best episode of the season so far 😂
I freaking love Jimmy's laugh. It instantly makes me giggle.
If you all are looking for an upgrade to the wheel, might a recommend making a giant d10 (10-sided die) for the chefs to roll to determine the number of quarters they get.
phoning it in > without a recipe
“Energized just took my adderall so..” RELATABLE
Daily Reminder: JESUS LOVES YALL ❤️ 💝💗💕💛💝💖💚💓💕❤💌💛💖💝💙💌💓💖💝💗💘
JODY FOSTER!!!!!
My favourite part of this show is when the judges have to pretend they made it lol
Love the "offscreen" non verbal communication between the chefs and the contestants when presenting to the judges, its like they swithced roles
Marissa I relate to you so hard
Like the show but they gotta make new mini games
I believe in you Johnny!!!
Not the tomatoe soup comeback🤣🤣🤣
But what IS tomato water??
How about a beanbag toss for quarters to change up the wheel?
This series is BRILLIANT!
Did Nick host a Crypto channel in his previous life? He looks familiar
OMG IM EXCITED FOR KWESI TO BE ON NEXT EP
Me. That’s what she said  Them: we are not immature anymore.  Me. 😶
Me. That’s what she said  Them: we not immature anymore.  Me. 😶
Johnny was robbed this episode, considering Keith made colourful macaroons tf
Acc love this series 😂
I can't wait for Jhonny to have a redemption arch just like Zach's
OMG, how far did they have to search to find Marissa? She's so freaking annoying. No adult can be that clueless.  It was hard listening to her hysterics. Please, let this be a one time shot.
She’s really annoying :/
I closed my eyes just when jimmy started talking and all I can hear is Jodie foster wtf s I r
Please let Jonny win so he can be free
The ending of this video was perfection
hi
Jonny and Keith are an amazing duo
There should be an episode where after the initial quarters run out the chefs have to switch phones booths and finish the other person’s dish without knowing what they are making.
im shocked. BUT HE MADE MACAROONS!! nicks thing didnt even come out right or taste great. you cant be serious.
I died laughing when the judges had to justify "their" decisions and figure out what happened only in the moment of judging!! Amazing <3
I honestly have to believe that Jonny is stuck here in the same way that Ryan Bergara is stuck in Puppet History
Love every single video with Jonny in it! He’s hilarious. Maybe he can become a try guy? 🥰😀🥳
I feel so bad for Johnny at this point
But seriously, what is tomato water?!
I’m convinced this season is just a prank they’re pulling on Johnny
This was chaotic and my anxiety definitely spiked during this 😅😅😅
So happy to see so much Johnny on the channel ❤😂
“you never had soup in a cookie before, im over here making 🤫up”.. Lol this was fun to watch!
im so proud of keith’s macarons they look so good
GREAT EPISODE OMG
Can we please get Kelsey in here
☕️
Sabotage! 😂 😂 😂
at this point id be heartbroken if jonny won and left
Keith screaming in a lavender beret about soup cookies is a brilliant vibe
Imagine the opposite, where the 'wrecks in the kitchen' are telling pro chefs to create their wild ideas. Like others have said, I want to see Keith directing pros to make soup macaroons :') but I also want to see Eugene forcing chefs to participate in making his wild creations
I love it when Keith rages in these videos 🤣
I think Jonny is just cursed or something😭how does he always manage to lose
johnny is great with everyone.
I love Jonny and am so glad he's gonna keep being on the show til he wins. We're rooting for you!!!
Keith is such a good friend, I love how quickly he ran over to help Marissa figure out the fryer situation
I love this series way more than without a recipe. And YES thank you for bringing back Jimmy to judge - I'm still ADDICTED to his manic laughter.
No wayyyy Keith and Johnny won this
MULTIPLE SOUPS MACARONS! Goooo Keith! 🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂❤❤❤
this is turning into Puppet History except its Johnny who loses every time
It's like the group leaders will have to explain the slop of a product to their superiors made by their members without actual help, other than the audio.
“I stand it straight up and it curls like nightmare before Christmas”
Come on!!! Jonny needs a win!! 😭
Omg I seriously love this sooo much hahaha
Johnny and Keith were projecting so much personal growth in being more polished throughout the video just for Keith to have a meltdown at the end. Chefs kiss! 🤌🏾
Yay, Johnny Cakes is back!!!! Love him!
But what if it was opposite where the chefs were in the kitchen and had to do exactly what the try team told them on the phone?
SOUP COOKIE HAHAHA
OMG, MULTIPLE SOUPS had me on the floor. Knowing Keith he would too. That and Daddy's favourite of course.
jimmy on dndads, jimmy on phonin it in :) what a great time to be a fan of jimmy :P
Johnny Cakes official Try Chef when?
how Rachel can stay calm and stand on the sidelines is beyond me. when that oil started smoking, I would have sent everyone home, they can burn their own kitchens down 🤣
General question: Why are there so many people who dont know how to cook? Doesnt have to be anything fancy, just basic stuff
LOL THAT ENDING THOUGH!! KEITH GAVE ME WITHOUT A RECIPE VIBES
How is Keith doing this series, Eat the Menu, Rank King Court, Lewberger,  and his Broadway show? Where are the TRI Guys?
I always get so anxious when they leave so much overhang with parchment paper and start shoving it into hot places. I've had that stuff touch something it shouldn't and catch!
Omg. I wasn't expecting that ending lolol
Poor Johnny
The way Marissa started describing herself, I thought it was me
I love that even tho Zach isn’t in the video but you can still hear his laugh
For what it’s worth, I’m still TeamKeithJohnny
Poor Keith gets screwed again!
When the chefs have to bullshit through the explanations is setting me off🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I had so many lols with this one
I was wondering why Marissa seemed so familiar and then I realized that she looks a lot like Zach’s wife Maggie!!
I’m honestly super impressed with Keith in this one XD
this b*tch is so irritating wtf
I would love to see their cooking telephone series with pro chefs, I think that’d just be super informative
The way Marissa warned everyone in the beginning that she was slow and medicated with Adderall and yet there's people in this comment section straight hating on her for her unspecified mental condition symptoms... as someone with learning disabilities I am disappointed in this community, but ig it was a good reminder that people outside of my town are also ableist. Yall should be downright ashamed, the way some yall are talking about this poor woman.
okay but like what if instead of the ball and cup and the wheel the bakers have to do pong and under each pong cup is a number of quarters and then the first cup they get is the amount of quarters they have to use
Multiple soups 😅👏
Hilarious. I could not stop laughing. I love this show
This is an injustice!
Please invite gordon ramsey to the show xD and let him team up with keith xD  (also still waiting for the day, that Johnny's quest to win an episode xD)
No johnny!!!! He's gna be here til the season finale. 😂😂😂😂😂
Please, Kieth, make a French onion macaron 😂
omg jimmy wong! i know him from dungeons and daddies!
I really want Jonny to win one of these. It's like he's stuck in cooking phone booth purgatory. I almost feel bad for enjoying it 😂
are u fawking serious.. that girl is so annoying and her cooking sucked snd she won GOD.. keith ate her up in every way
I’m actually okay with that because that means Johnny gets to come back
How did Jonny not win. Keith made MACARONS!
if i was Nick i would have a mental breakdown just watching her try to cook was making me upset 😂😭
At this point I just want Jonny to win no matter what
This is my favorite series
this is a win for me because i love seeing jonny in these videos
you can't make a soup cookie? Oh yeah I CAN AND I WILL next time we make macarons, you know what I'M making?! MULTIPLE SOUPS
jonny never winning a single time is my favorite thing 😭😭
jonny is for real coming back until he wins 💀💀
The Keith rant !!
“MmmmmmULTIBLE soups!”
Do ya'll remember when the Try Guys was relaxing to watch? Sigh......
Soup macarons
Oh my goodness.... that introduction just WOULDN"T ENNNNND!!!
They should change the wheel to a dart board 🤣 just 1 episode where a baker has been there before and watch the choas/confusion
I fell like normally the background voices are edited out and they didn’t this time and as someone who has problems with “background noise” it’s bothering me. I can’t stand background chatter like in a cafeteria or a restaurant.
So….what IS tomato water? It never got addressed 😂 is it the liquid from a fresh tomato or something you have to make…?
i want so badly to make keiths soup cookie work for him
Marissa is so cute
The fact that this is chaotic even with a “recipe” makes my day
all i want is for this show to keep being made until jonny wins one
KWASI NEXT EP FUCK YAAAAA
i am stressing with the chefs omg on both sides
Why would Jonny let Keith choose a flavor
Try Guys out here giving Food Network some serious competition competition! It would be amazing if someone like Alton Brown, one of the celebrity chefs who clearly embraces chaos in the kitchen, could do a guest spot.
pls do one with sam and colby literally would be so iconic
It’s so funky watching this as a dungeons and daddies fan as well with Jimmy Wong being here. 😭
I would love to see an episode with Rainie and Miles cooking and Keith and Zach on the phone.
the Return of Rage Keith 😂
Keith! I love your outbursts!
Wow, just like they ruin everything else!
Okay but justice for Johnny. Keith did a great job this episode. They should have won
They just refuse to give Jonny a win!!
You guys should have a video series where a professional chef recreates some your worst creations from Without a Recipe just to prove that it can be done!
Can we have a Phoning it in with Keith & Zach as the pro chefs?
I want Jonny to win so bad but I also want him in more episodes so I am kind of glad he did not win again
At this point I feel like they’re not letting Johnny win so he can stay in the show lolol
Marissa! I've missed seeing her around <3
At least we get more jonny!
maria is me in the kitchen. i feel seen
Lmaooooo okay she needs to be on more often she is just too cute and hilarious
Who’s the new girl? I like her.
Johnny’s purple beret is adorable
I absolutely ADORE Johnny! He needs a win, someone give him a win!!
I love how all of them are just as chaotic as each other
I thought these guys were canceled ?????
SPOILER ALERT     The best part of this is that we get Jonny for another episode! Play to win. ❤️
Keith shooting for his redemption arc the moment he realised it was macarons. "CAN ONE OF THE FLAVORS BE TOMATO SOUP"
Someone give Marissa a cooking show damnit!!!
marissa: SABOTAGE 👺👺👺👺  my new spirit animal
Keith gives me “who you you think you are? I AM” vibes with his rants at the end
Marissa and Keith miming was peak comedy 🤣
imagine at the beginning of every season how many quarters they send one of the employees to get 😭
Rooting for “Try Guys make soup without a recipe” 🍲
😭😭😭 i love jonny’s and keith’s dynamic so much
This try gal has very similar energy to both Zach and Maggie.... Is this their child from the future or just another amazing person who I want to meet irl?
title is misleading there's a single try guy no (s)
This series is everything 😂
I really thought jonny would finally win.
Loved Marissa as a contestant!!! More of her!
So what is tomato water?
I LOVE this serie
Keith is by far the best in these thank you guys 🖤😅
Finale chef going against Jonny has GOT to be Rosanna Pansino
I once was tricked into eating a duck pate macaron. I'm not really here for the savory macarons, lmao
I got an ad for macarons on this video. 10/10 placement LMAO
Love this series, but I'm missing Rosanna Pansino as a judge. Love her judging. The others did great, but I'd love to see her again too.
I love this show but it would be infinitely better if you only had keith, zach, eugene and kwesi as the ones in the kitchen. I cant fucking stand Melissa
i love jonny, also when they were saying who he was teaming with i kept saying “keith” they said “an idiot” and i went “YES” so that’s nice
MULTIPLE SOUPS has me 💀
This series is quickly becoming my favourite!
"I'm so talented"🤣🤣🤣🤣
Marissa is such a mood
Truly best cooking show out there
I'm SOOOO IMPRESSEDDD that Keith's macarons came out so niceeee!! I literally went WOWWWW~ Love seeing the Try Guys in the kitchen, so fun to watch ❤️
Is this somehow sponsored by Cheeze Whiz? 😂
And special episodes called “testing pro chefs’ mental stability with a dash of uplifting suprises”
As much as I love WAR, Phoning it in has become my fave try guys cooking series!
Wait, next episode has Kwesi?  I’m so in!!
can we all agree that jimmy’s reaction is the best?? i laugh at the guys yeah but when i his reaction, i laugh even more. to more shows with him!!!
Where’s the fourth guy?
she is way to annoying. just everything about her stresses me out...
"i can do hard stuff too" Johnny 👀
I still want to know what the actual f*** is "tomato water"?!
2:53 is SO RELATABLE 😂😂 love the lil ADHD scream at the end
How is this series so good?!  And why is it not a network show?
Okay, but the macarons LOOKED amazing
Keith. Was. ROBBED. Nick's recipe was a crescent roll with cream cheese and fish. Johnny's recipe was MACARONS.
Love your videos I find them so comforting ❤❤ keep going guys <3
i want jonny and keith to win together so badly
“I’m over here cooking up stuff inside this beret.” I loved Jonny’s beret!
I love Jonny so much, he is soooooo funny!!! Can we please keep himmmm
Please bring back Marissa for without a recipe or any other cooking show. She is hilarious!
i think the reason why jimmy was so shocked when he saw keith's macarons because he reminded how terrible his black forrest cake was 🤣
Keith’s macarons look amazing I am so jealous bc I’ve attempted them in the past and they failed miserably 😢
I love this show so much! Still wish Keith wouldn’t do the angry yelling thing 😅
Thessa is so hilarious 😭
The chefs were such good sports! I feel like the constraint on only having one oven makes things unfair for all parties. But Keith's macarons turned out so beautiful, he just ran out of time! And Marissa was lovely and made a great dish despite the deluge of last-minute instructions. Well done all!
at this point I’m convinced they are denying Jonny his win just to keep letting him come back
Marissa is me in the kitchen trying new recipes—except she’s incredibly beautiful 😍
Marissa is sooo cute and fun to watch 🩷
Anyone else think Jonny looks like Daniel Preda??? 😅
Jonny: Today we're being classy~ 10 seconds later............................ Vanilla: i'm vanilla and i gooooooo spill~
Keith’s angry outburst at the end is both hilarious and scary😂😂 I want to run away, but I can’t stop watching 😂😂😂
Finally got to the ending, and I was totally right about Johnny losing again which makes me really think they’re going to do the same thing they did with Keith having lost nearly every time with daddy’s favorite, but this time it’s gonna be Johnny losing every time until maybe the very end, like how when Keith won the last episode of that season Without A Recipe… This feels very Rigged
“Heat it 350 degrees.” “I can give you 6 or 8.” 😂😂😂 Thank you Keith for putting it into terms I can understand
Jimmy's laugh always makes me laugh lmao
This series absolutely kills me! Multiple soup cookies.
29:17 I know this is a joke, and I’m not that offended. However, calling salsa, tomato water… Little disrespectful, so fuck you for that comment but whatever in the grand scheme of things
I am shocked by how well Keith did
If Johnny does not win this episode, I’m convinced he’s gonna be a regular contestant, and that part of the joke is that he will never win until like the last fucking challenge
Sounds like Zac is there laughing in the back
get jimmy wong back i want jimmy wong back
I didn‘t think I could find someone more annoying in the kitchen than Zach but then you guys found Marissa, very impressive
i wish u guys start going back to twice videos a week, i feel starved from content😅😂
I loveee her chaotic energy 😂
I'm so invested in Johnny winning one of these 🤣
at this point they just want Johnny to keep appearing in this series..
LoveloveLOVE this series! <3 Also so happy that Jimmy Wong is making more appearances, he's so much fun!
Massive fan of this show! But please would it be possible to change the title of the videos? It's pretty easy to figure out who wins. I guess it doesn't detract from the viewing experience, but would be a nice surprise!
Now I love jimmy as a judge but Jonny and jimmy as the pros together is just the best content 😆 please can you make it happen again
I can NOT express how excited I am for the next episode of this
The cast was soooooo refreshing and warm. Keep them around please I'm over the reality tv cake chick.
I love this series
Gosh Marissa is so annoying
No🥺Give Johnny a win! They looked so good. Keith actually made something... yeah, something. That should be grounds for a win in itself
Whoah!!!!!! Keith hit those friggin things outta the park! They looked so pretty and tasty!!!!!
Yesss we all love this series
Them eating "their" creations at the judging was so good! I love Marissa and her insistence that everything was sabotaged. It's true, absolutely no one knows what "tomato water" is. Sounds like what posh people drink when they're trying to lose weight and don't want to eat dinner.
Keith and Jonny made actual macarons! Justice flr the macarons!
Marissa made acrolein.
Jonny is such a delight and has the funniest reactions! :)) I'm so glad to see him on this channel every now and then <3
im kinda confused about the format. are they supposed to use their quarters strategically and the guests just don't want to or don't realise? or do they just get a specific amount of time and the quarters are just bc that's fun?
I love that the theme of this episode was flour and Jonny chooses the only  French pastry without "traditional" flour
I love this show to death. The look and editing is * chef's kiss *
whoever added the cheese whizz to the kitchen knew what chaos they were sewing
Girl must have a pretty rough life if "tomato water" is actually too difficult for her to comprehend...
who is Marissa? Does she work for the try guys?
I think i’m loving this series as much as i love without a recipe 🤣😭
Marissa stressed me out SO MUCH that I could barely get through this show.
Please bring Nick back
marissa: exhibiting symptoms  me: okay adhd, autism or both “i just took my Adderall”  there it is
can rachel call me darling in that calm, kind voice when i’m stressed out please sodkskdjsjjd
the johnny loosing even when keith makes near perfect macaroons gives ryan loosing every puppet history episode to force him to keep coming back energy skcndjdjjd
How did Nick win?
***Do opposite try guys in the phone booth and shaves following directions***
I will say, Keith’s macarons looked really good! He did well
Chefs: This is a very difficult dish   Also chefs: How did you fuck this up?!
sabotage.
7:16 idk why but i am wheezing 😭😭😂
marissa has adhd?? MAKING HER REMEMBER MULTIPLE STEPS THAT WERE DELIVERED TO HER AUDIBLY IS SABOTAGE! CRIMINAL!
Not gonna lie but these aren't fun when it's just a random guest and only 1 try guy
This series is as chaotic as without a recipe.. I love it!! And all the guests they have are really enjoyable to watch
I love Marissa
I don’t like the thumbnail. Marissa deserves to be in front as much as any try guy.
Johnny's so hilarious!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 He should always be in every episode
she's so cringe
omg the brownie judge!!! i'm thrilled
Jonny calling Keith baby 🥺😭 so sweet I'm crying and keith wearing the little beret omg
Dang... I was rooting so hard for Jonny... like at least this time.. I even thought it was because of the cooker he was put with... now Ijust don't know...
Nick's realization that Marissa used cheese wiz instead of cream cheese has me cryinnnnnng
It's so hilarious when kieth said "multiple soups" with a straight face, hahahahaha
Even with an 'upgrade' to Keith Jonny didn't win.. He will be on this show forever (as he should be.. because he is hilarious!)
I demand a recount Jonny should’ve won!
Marissa is definitely the female version of Zach
Poor Johnny must have done a real bad deed in his past life
I love that the try guys occasionally have try-guests… seein someone with as much cooking knowledge as me try this was fun😅❤️
Here's to me hoping that there'll be a collab with Sorted Food sometime in the future ;;
Dying at MULTIPLE SOUPS 😂
I love this show. So much.
I love Johnny so much but Jimmy will also always always be an absolute fave lmao. His laugh brings me joy.
Keith and Jonny were ROBBED. Macarons are so hard and Keith crushed it!
I feel like they will never make Jonny win to keep him forever. AND I AM HERE FOR IT!
do ghost hunting with the watcher please. i bet it's gonna be funny😂😂
We must protect Jonny at all costs.
Sabotage!
Now keith needs a full episode of making multiple soup macaroons now
Him  going nuclear made it!!
No wander buzzfeed Let you go. Scam's and bad content. Boooo !
Absolutely love this series. The concept is so stupid and funny. Love that Johnny returns a lot, he’s a natural. I’m also loving Marisa!
Loveeeee this series, i feel like anyone who cannot cook in the office should also be part of the idiots’ team!❤
I think this has been my favorite phoning it in episode so far.  I love this series just as much as without a recipe.
this is keith learning that tomato soup and grilled cheese is not a very good macaron flavor
Well now they have to do another macaron video so Keith can do his multiple soup flavors LMAO
Nooooooooooooooo Jonnyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
I feel like it this point, they just want Jonny on every episode so they don’t give him his dream victory. I’m not complaining tho 😌
I think this might be the best series ever
Johnny getting the Jan edit
I LOVED NICK and MARISSA please bring them back for more content!!!
Honestly as someone who cooks all day everyday for a living, I do not envy you guys. This is so amazingly chaotic. Tips the hat and chef kisses to all you crazy fuckers.  I've watched you guys forever and I'll always tune in when Keith is on. Love you all!
Did they ever figure out what tomato water is?
my new favorite series!!!
I love Keith's persistence in trying to convey his unique flavors in his creations
God johnny coming back for every episode reminds me of ryan in puppet history
did´nt the try guys already learn to make macarons? xd
I haven’t been feeling well and this made my day. I was cracking up so hard. 😂 love it
MULTIPLE SOUPS
mmmmMMMMULTIPLE SOUPS!!!😂😂😂
Jonny was robbed!
MULTIPLE SOUPS!!!!
Nicks awkward sense of humor was awesome, what a great contestant 😂 I'm so glad he won, and I'm doubly glad he won because that means we get more Johnny too lmao
After a very long day this video is exactly what I needed ❤
We truly have hit a mile stone in this channel.....a Try Guys challenge only including ONE Try Guy......you guys were supposed to BEAT buzzfeed...not BECOME it 😭
Can we please have roy choi once more??? It always cracks me up how disappointed he is in everything’s done😂
Anyone else think this was all a ploy to set up Nick and Marissa? They were so cute together on the phone, and then when he said, “I’m so proud (of myself)” he was saying how proud he was of her, and her hugging him in the end. So cute! 🥺 (Sorry idk if they are already in relationships with anyone else they just had such cute chemistry tho)
Fear of frying always confuses me. I live in the south and we fry things all the time. I forget it isn’t normal in other parts of the country.
Who is Marissa? Lol why didn't she get an intro as to how she knows the try guys? Did I miss something?
Crying laughing as usual Who is Marissa?
I love how Johnny has become the "Zach" of "Phone it In." I hope he wins in the Finals.
Soup macaroons: French onion, split pea, (can we count a chowder?), broccoli cheddar, butter nut squash,
Jonny in a beret is something I never knew I needed.
Wow Keith did a full on Zach laugh at 27:55 that’s how you know their true friends
ONLY I CAN!!! AND ONLY I WILL!!!!
Given the circumstances, Keith really did made beautiful macarons
RACHEL!! SABOTAGE!!
Jonny needs a W!!
Idk who the hell this woman is but holy hell she was annoying and ruined this show. My GF and I both hated her.
Johnny was robbed!!!!!
Always love Johnny Cakes and Nick was a great addition as well!! ☺️
Marissa's panic the entire time was so funny
eagerly anticipated multiple soups
After seeing those macrons I actually thought this is the day Johnny wins 🙊🤧
johnny cakes should never win. otherwise the joke is over.
"Do you have Italian roots too?" "N... No?" (with pitty) "Just say yes"
This is honestly my new favorite series. It kills me every. Single. Time!
I love how Jimmy loves Angry Keith
i love how much jimmy loves it when keith goes crazy lmfao
I love this series. Everyone was great. To chef to the judges and of course Keith and marissa !!
the production and editing of these are always so good
thanks to marissa I now have the beastie boys' classic "sabotage" stuck in my head
I want Jonny to win, but again I don't. He makes this show amazing!
No! I Johnny should have won! But I'm starting to suspect this is by design, like Ryan always losing on Puppet History. 😅
Keith turned the same shade as his soup macarons at the end there
How did Keith get away with not cooking it🤣 they just thought it was under baked
That title card graphic is beautiful. 👏 for whoever made it.
Keith is doing so so good in the series!!!! So funny and the techniques improved so much!
Roy Choi and David Chang as chefs with Eugune and Zach... Would be total chaos
god she's annoying
I JUST WANNA GIVE JOHNNY A WIN. PLEASE. 🤣😭😭😭
23:36 dying at Jimmy gasping and going "what the fuuuuu, yougottobekiddingme"
She's literally a more energetic Aubrey Plaza
Johnny Cakes little beret is its own character tbh
I'm sorry but where the F is Eugene. Does he not even care about this company anymore?
Marissa is awesome!
I thought Johnny had it in the bag this time, not gonna lie
The way Marissa doesn't listen just kills me in this challenge.  He was so clear.
Jonny is me I am Jonny
32:38 "mmmULTIPLE soups!"
Phoning it in, but the try guys become the "chefs" on the phone.
I am so glad this series and The Try Guys exist (especially out of buzzfeed because I think this series would've never happened in Buzzfeed). The Try Guys never cease to make me laugh and calm me down from an anxious and horrible day. Thank you :)
I want Jonny in every episode of this till I die he is my fav human being
Mr. Johnny Cakes is officially the unofficial fourth Try Guy.
Marissa is a funny guest cook :) I loved her chaotic clueless energy.
Another defeat for johnny 😂😂😂
Oh yes, tomato water. It must contain cheese whiz!
Marissa is annoying as heck
This is like the 3rd time Keith’s made macarons. the multiple soup macarons are gonna be epic judges watch out
😭❤ I LOVE JOHNNY
This show is SO good. Please keep making it forever!
"Yes, that's what it's like here" in response to it being 5 minutes and 5 hours sent me 💀
I really want to see multiple soups executed. I always love Keith’s energy in this and without a recipe
29:27 lol Johnny
Play darts for quarters
I like Marissa when she's on her Adderall 😂
Don't underestimate ADHD meds. I took mine yesterday after forgetting it for a week and dug up a small tree I hated. At the start my neighbor left to get groceries. After an hour my mom asked if I took my meds. After three hours my neighbor returned and loaned me a trench shovel to get the last few roots. My legs hurt.
The way Johnny is such a good sport about his losing record and continues to come back. He’s a gem!
Big round stiff tips
Poor Easy Cheese is over here crying because everyone's calling it Cheese Wiz.
hoping chef roy choi will be a future contestant!. it'll be nice to see how he will react & defend whatever concoction his idiot chef ends up making. him getting paired up with zach and competing against johnny, while jimmy and josh are the judges. would be hillarious me thinks
You all at 2nd Try are hitting straight up stunners... this is such a great idea/show. Humbling the Pro's and getting the average "Joe's" to mess with their skills is a beautiful disaster. Great Job everyone!
Me and all other celiacs at 1:04
Her asking over and over if it is a tablespoon made me feel seen as someone with adhd.
I love that they were able to convince their old judges into the show and find new judges and assault their palettes too! HAHAHAHAHAHA!
I"m so here for Johnny to get his redemption arc.
the funniest bit of this series is the chefs trying to pass off whatever fuck ups the people making the food made as their own
I would like to request that even if Jonny wins, he remain a permanent chef, like an Iron Chef situation, or just have him lose no matter what and keep him on here trying to win forever like a Puppet History situation
You should do cheese cakes next. Give Jonny Cakes a chance with something he's good at.
I cannot express how much I love the dynamic of the vets Keith and Jonny being all calm and collected vs the newbs Marissa and Nick being all stressed. Something about this is hilarious.
I love melissa she’s ultimately chaotic 😂😂😂
I love the way that the videos are titled instantly reveal that Johnny's gonna lose again
Nick, the bagel judge was so fun! I thought Jonny was gonna get his win, but nahhhh😂, and the caption for him calling him out lol. Marissa was an awesome addition and Keith’s multiple soups rant 😂
I’m starting to think the judges just aren’t allowed to let John win
Keith Comedy 🫰
Marissa, I think I speak for all of us when I say that we feel seen by your adderall comment
THIS EPISODE WAS AMAZING! Marissa is hilarious and on point about that sabotage 👀 Also what IS tomato water?! 🍅💧🤷‍♀️ Keith and Johnny make an amazing pair, they're hilarious and their chemistry is great 🥰 A secret mission for Keith to make macarons is just cruel 🤣😂 He's been through enough! Of COURSE he tried tomato soup and grilled cheese, that killed me! Recipe obsession returns! Nick came in HOT with high expectations of the Try Guys crew 😂🤣 Very intricate dish The judging was fantastic, love seeing Jimmy Wong, he's so damn funny!  Thessa was absolutely LOVELY 🥰 She fit in so well with the group, great energy, great humor, great critique!  I love watching the chefs try their hardest to answer the judges questions while the cooks mime the answers off to the side, fucking gold! Keith, your determination to make soup cookies is entertaining, hilarious, and inspiring. You are such a joy to watch, I love your curious spirit 💕
Instead of the cup and ball (kendama?) You could do one of those wire loop mazes where you can't let the hoop touch the wire.  You could have them play operation with a custom board of some kind related to the show. Darts, which could also decide how many coins they get.
Keith is truly a treasure
For where his skill level is at and getting directions through a phone, Keith's macarons are honestly pretty good.
Jonny saying that knowing how cream of tartar is made is "above his pay grade" is so funny and I love that this phrase is used in literally all fields
Marissa yelling "SABATOGE" and "RACHEL" every time something goes wrong is such a mood!
I think it would be funny if the chefs made the dish too. Then compare the real dish to the phones in dish. This show is hilarious! I’m really rooting for Jonny!
My nearly 2 year old triplets are asleep in the next room. It’s been a rough night. They just fell asleep  maybe 30 mins ago. Still could not contain laughing out loud when Keith yelled “MULTIPLE SOUPS” did so well silently laughing through the rest of the episode. Luckily no one woke up.
Id watch a whole reality tv show featuring Jonny omg he’s SO FUNNY
She’s annoying
Keith lowkey looks sad. Like he started this company with his four best friends and now he’s all by himself…😢
I hate her screaming SAVOTAGE
IN REGARDS TO THE WHEEL OF QUARTERS,  IF YOU DO AN EGG CENTRIC EPISODE THE PRO CHEFS COULD SEE HOW MANY EGGS THEY CAN HOLD IN ONE HAND IN 20 SECONDS AND HOLD FOR 10 SECONDS ANY BROKEN EGGS RESULT IN A1 MIN LOSS OF TIME FOR THE COOKS
Jimmy is so pretty
i guess jonny will be joing every single episode of phoning it in and im here for it <3
I freaking love Marissa! She needs to be in more things.. Sabotage! 😂 this was great!
I thought it was so kind of Keith to help Marissa with the hot plate.
Bring Johnny on until he wins!
Nick is so cute and deadpan
My favorite try guys series 😁
Marissa is hilarious "Keith fucked up!!" Or "sabotaged!"
So much background noise in this one
Johnny was robbed!!!! Lol
i can't believe how genuinely hard i laughed at "multiple soups" oh my god
I'm obsessed with Johnny!
kwesi should be the new 4th try guy
Marissa saying sabotage for everything is so funny 😂
I wish they’d just title with the prompt
Yeah she didn't deserve that win. Part of it was raw and they couldn't taste the lox which is a huge part of bagel and LOX. They enjoyed three of the four flavors of the cookies. Kieth deserved to win
Conflicted between needing justice for Johnny and wanting him on every single episode of this series
Marissa did so good for her first time cooking with the try guys!!!
Edit Team - please check audio spectrum, ear bleeding high freq coming through in some segments/shots. Not audible on mobile device.
Kieth knew what it was when he asked if he can make a tomato soup flavor.  I bet he can perfect the flavor if he tried the recipe a third time.
I don’t like the miss girl cuz she idk sound fake
i wanna see a episode where this is swapped, keith looked up a recipe before coming in but doesn’t have a physical copy, then phones in to Jonny, who has to cook and figure what the flying fuck keith is trying to tell him to do
I LOVE THIS SERIES SO MUCH!!!!
How can a grown ass person not know how to fry things?...*gets astonished in Polish*
Is tomato water actually something???
I wasn't a huge fan when they first introduced this show, but now I love it. Fun, wholesome, and chaotic. Loving that the chefs had to defend their creations and the great rotation of guests alongside Keith as the cooks.
Love Keith and Johnny together <3
Ok no offense but nick and her winning is bull crap the end el was y even macaron adjacent at least Keith’s looked like one
I’m just stating the video, but who is Marissa??? Like is she part of the try team or another Internet personality?
Marisa screaming "sabotage!" killed me every time 😂
Waitttttt i LOVE Marissa…… Would love her in more videos she is so relatable!!
Please please please do soup as a theme so Keith can do that. I WANT to see multiple soup macrons-see yes. Smell, taste or touch one? Noooooooo
Jonny>>>>>everyone
cant wait for multiple soups macarons
all i remember is cheese whiz
Jimmy reminds me of Grant Imahara.... had to do a double take.
Honestly Marissa's high pitched screaming made this kind of hard to get through. I much prefer the original guys
Jonny IMMEDIATELY turning to cajole Keith for Jonn'ys own safety is comedy
They won’t let Johnny win so that he keeps coming back
I will never get tired of Phoning it in! 🤣🤣🤣🤣  Edited to add: Please bring the best chef of our generation back for more episodes, possibly as a contestant, and maybe also as a judge for WAR 😂 Her one-liners were just *chef's kiss*
i love keith so much! 😂😂😂
I loved Nick as a judge. Having him back as a contestant? *chefs kiss*
genuinely one of my favorite series on youtube right now!!! xD looking forward to the next episode!
never in a million years did I think I would see the return of the cursed tomato soup and grilled cheese macaron. Absolutely vile but I commend the commitment to the bit
I love Johnny!! I hope we get to see more of him
ooh so thats what folding in the cheese means? got it.
Are we sure this video isn't sponsored by Cheez Whizz? 😂
I FRIGGIN LOVE THIS SERIES!!
Jonny reminds me so much of Chad Warwick from American Horror Story Season 1, is that just me?!
I genuinly want to see Keith make multiple soup macaroons
Absolutely love this series!
I love the pleasantly surprised looks on the chefs' and judges' faces when they revealed the pastries. They all looked really good!
Call me crazy, but Johnny looks a lot like Zach in the thumbnail😂
marissa is so me i love her
honestly despite keith losing and making kinda bad macarons the fact that they at least look eons better than last time is a win in my book
I love Marissa!!!
I am convinced Jimmy made sure Jonny lost just so he could watch Keith flip his lid and honestly, valid. 🤣
I’m rooting for Jonny to lose every time so he can keep doing these videos!!! I love him
Nannas phoning it in for a family recipe pls
Keith squirting out ez cheez into a piping bag to squirt out onto the macarons was so funny. Like sir
I'm curious how they get this to work wrt the pay phones
“I just took my Adderall, feeling good but sweaty” RELATABLE AF lol hooked already
Oh my god, I love Jonny so fucking much. Please keep him forever. We must protect this man!
Having only one oven really screws people over 🤣
OMG u guys ❤️❤️❤️ Johnnnyyyyyy 💗
So the judges don’t know they made the dishes through other people?
Johnny and Keith were cheated!
Keith DELIVERS the entertainment... **Standing ovation**
I want a version where the idiots have to convey a complicated recipe to a chef. Like a reverse telephone
I LOVE THIS SERIES!!!❤❤❤❤❤ so much fun and I just love it.
KEITH AND JONNY WERE ROBBED!!!!!!!!
Marissa yelling "sabotage" whenever something was slightly inconveniencing is my favorite thing. same
I think my favorite thing is hearing the chefs talk in third person about the food 😂😂
This is my new favorite try guys show
When she spanked the food processor...
I am absolutely addicted to this new concept. The person who came up with this should get major props!!!
Next time: chowder macaron
There is no way these guys only exist on YouTube. Give them their only network
I love these so much lol please more phoning it in 🙏🏼
gonna use “honestly, that’s above my pay grade” from now on, thanks johnny !
“I’m clearly a classy lady.” Yaaas Johnny. Also “feeling good but I’m also sweaty  so…” is my new life motto.
The fact that Jonny “yes and”ed Keith’s tomato soup idea is incredible 😂
You accomplished a feat, you made me spit my drink an pee
Plot twist the real reason Jonny never wins is because they want to keep him on the show as long as possible.
is "tomato water" the new "spa water?" like, an altered version of a hispanic food?
29:25 Keith is STRESSED lol
Johnny and Marissa are wonderful, and i really hope they appear again. They are so funny and entertaining!
I think Jonny should be paired with Rachel for once... Maybe he'll finally get that W... 😅🤣🤣
I love this series!
@tryguys : when Keith finally wins, would you please use 'winner, winner,  chicken dinner?"
This is quickly becoming my favorite series. XD Keith's "Multiple Soups!" Had me ROLLING!
The chefs bullshitting their way through an explanation of their dishes is hands down my favorite part of this series.
She is more concentrated on her character rather than the task, annoying.
Marissa is me when it comes to multi tasking in the kitchen. I feel her chaotic lostiness, I'm with you girl! Just pull through it just say it'll be fine hahaha
convinced keith wasn’t given the win to keep the big of johnny never having won going
My favorite Pc game is Macaroonscape 🙃
I think this is the hardest I've ever laughed at a try guys video. I'm absolutely looking forward to the next one. 🤎
I want chad and max from coldones to be the guys that phone it in thanks
Multiple soups lol😂😂😂😂😂 I’m ready for next episode
For once I'd love to see the ones cooking doing differently than told and surprising the chefs with their own dishes
Who is Marissa?
Love this series, love seeing Johnny too
I love Jonny he needs to be a regular on try guys
Ugh! Best series so far. Whoever thought about phoning it in is a gem ✨
Honestly this is my favorite new try guys segment.
Oh Keith and Jonny were ROBBED!! lol
Johnny cakes is my favorite try guys character he makes everything better
YESSSS MY FAV VIDEO
I'm honestly impressed that Keith made macarons that looked that good. Props to him and Johnny 😁
Anyone else Ship Marissa and Nick?
Poor Johny
Man I was yelling GIVE JOHNNY A WIN!!
When Marisa pulled out the ruler to make sure it was 1/8th of an inch 😂 I absolutely loved this whole episode❤
please dont have marissa back on this show
One of the best macarons I had by Zumba in sydney was Kalamata Olives. Mindblowing.
Rugelach vs macaron, poor johnny 😭🤣
let me just say im SO happy johnnys a regular guest on the channel now ive been watching since the try guys started and hes by far my favorite guest expert
Jonny is to Phoning It In what Ryan is to Puppet History? The permanent contestant? Let’s just hope it doesn’t end the same way 😉
😂 so funny!
I’m 6 minutes in and Nick is stressing me out😂❤️
Marissa panicking every two seconds is so relatable
Keith keeps getting robbed 😂
Marisa NEEDS to appear more frequently please & thank you.
Keith's macarons were such a win though, it's quite surprising he managed to cook them as well as he did, even if they were a bit undercooked. I think the issue is that they were just too plain whereas the other dish was maybe a bit more creative and flavorful. Also, Marissa was pure panic.
johnny is too precious. dont give him a win so we can have more episodes with him😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂
I loved the girl (Marissa?) Screaming SABOTAAAAGE 😡 HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I cannot believe how gorgeous those macarons are! 😍
Please have Rosanna on here!!
Marissa is my spirit animal. I love her chaotic mood so much
@7:13 "Ha Ha Ha,, Keith fucked up!" is when I fell in love with Marissa.
I love Johnny cakes
Remember when everyone rooted for I think it was dicaprio to finally win an oscar? That's how I feel ab Jonny on this show
Poor Johnny, I thought he had a chance this time XD
Johnny got robbed
Everyone was great in this episode, but it looks like they were teasing Johnny with kwesi next week, which sounds like a disaster waiting to happen and I can't wait
I think Keith and Becky should face off in phoning it in
This ENTIRE episode was hilarious, everyone was great. Please don’t ever stop this series
Marissa's "Rachel?!  SABOTAGE!!" was hilarious 😂
Marissa’s chaos fits with the entire show perfectly I hope to see more of her. Keith and Johnny Hilarious as always👌
I really appreciate that you brought back the Hot Bagel Man
MULTIPLE SOUPS!
Keith’s actions are JUSTIFIED 😂😂
why? idk...she's...idk guys...first video I didn't like from u...so upsetting... ps: adhd is fine...no prob, but it not about adhd
I stg it’s just a skit now that Jonny never wins despite who he’s with
I thought they photoshopped Johnny’s hat on the thumbnail... >_>
I support Keith’s macaron soup ambitions! 😂 Come on Jonny! You’ll get a win soon! 🏆😂❤️
Not loving home girl feels forceful energetic
Justice for Jonny! Give him his win!
i love that keith used sour cream instead of cream cheese
MMMMMULTIPLE SOUPS.
💀 laughing from "multiple soups" and then getting super excited Kwesi is in the next one 👏👏👏
jimmy is always so funny
I'm all in for the multiple soups
Geez will Jonny every get to win? Lol
I love watching Johnny and I kinda don't want him to Win just because of how funny it is
Nothing in this life has filled me with terror the way Keith saying "M U L T I P L E S O U P S" has. I love it, Try Team please make this happen. Just an entire episode of soup macarons!
Omg the during the judging I just feel dread for Jonny
whattt i REALLY thought Johnny and Keith had this oneeee🤔😑🤨🙃
Who's marissa
Keith overthinking the consistency of lava is so relatable 😂
The title and the title Keith gives are 2 different things??
Dude Keith did so well making macarons. No cracks is insane
Johnny is the Zack of Phoning it in, can never get the win but is who everyone is rooting for.
"i just took my adderall" was really the tone setter for the rest of the episode
I loved this,  Keith rant was the best.  can't wait for the next one yaaay
Keith really has grown into quite the chef. I'm so proud of that lil guy.
Hi Johnny, love the berat on you😊
Poor Jonny 😂😂 lost again
I want Jonny to win, but I also want him to keep appearing in these into perpetuity.
Instead of a wheel it should be like a longest straw sorta thing where they pick a thing at random and the length determines the amount of quarters. This will remove any wheel skill the cooks could have.
Please forgive me but Keith is fuckin carrying this show at this point. If he isn't getting the lions share of the pay I'm unsubscribing  (Please note this is about the try guys, not their team, they all deserve a raise or at least a tax free bonus or something)
Keith such a sweet guy :''''
I'm at the beginning of the episode and Making Keith do Macrons was just his way of saying I don't want to win let's just have fun. Let's see how it goes though.
Johnny winning quarters. Good god i love this show.
These are kinda fun, but I miss Without A Recipe.
Nick is the most calm person that has ever been on The Try Guys and I love him.
Okay two in a row no Corn goodness is Zack well?!
Idk why, but this seems like the type of show Eugene would host and cackle at the suffering of everyone involved.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣I can't get enough of Keith outbursts everytime he takes an L
OHHHH it was the chef who was rolling the dough in the intro clip. that makes sense. I thought it was Keith for a second there.
When will Ro be a contestant? I can't wait!
Gordon Ramsay needs to be on this show
Nick whimpering "I am so proud of myself" with tears in his eyes is a whole freaking mood 😂🤣
They have created the best cooking show ever.
this is the best show on earth and i am very happy now.
I just want to watch this, only this, all the time
Keith being disgruntled as soon as he hears almond flour is my favorite thing
Missed opportunity for Keith/Johnny to not use a Schitt's Creek reference to "folding in the cheese" 😆
Ooohh, another Phoning It In episode right after the last one? 😍 You're really spoiling us now guys 🥰🖤
Marissa screaming "Rachel!" is so pure
phoning it in is my new favorite series!
I’m so mad it took 28 minutes for someone to say “what the fuck is tomato water!?”
Jimmy's laugh will forever be one of my favorite things about this show 🤣😂 he legit laughs from his soul and I love it
Once again, Johnny loses 😂. It’s okay! You will win at some point Johnny!
Phone it in is my favorite 😊❤
Ok, but. Has Keith considered making soup-flavoured scones? Because there are savoury scones and I think a tomato-cheese scone would genuinely be delicious. Plus, it would solve the texture issue because the humidity of tomatoes and cheese wouldn't ruin the texture of scones the way it does with macarons.
“RACHEEEL. SABOTAGE!”  “I’M ROOTING FOR YOU—“
9:36 Instead of a wheel, a plate of (insert finger food here) with a paper in it and a number XD to follow after cup-game or something
keith helping marissa set up the hot plate was so sweet why did it make me feel such big emotions
Ever since you guys put out a vid explaining that this is a new era of try guys and that this'll be a bit different from the normal I was kind of expecting different and more experimental things but so far this seems like more of the same. More power to you bc obviously they're popular. But why state you're going to left when you're still going right.
Bahahaha Johnny’s “nooo” when asked if the buttercream was flavored 😂
johnny is getting so much practice out of this little cup game he rly should be better (/lighthearted)
OH LAWD. Kwesi is in the next episode. Chaos levels will be 1000/10 😂😂
I have been waiting for Nick to come back on the channel since the bagel recipe! He's hilarious
As a non-American I have no idea what Cheese Wiz is but it looks and sounds terrifying.
Johnny's really never gonna win
Ok but screeching "I just took my Adderall!" is by and far the most millennial thing ever uttered on this show 🤣😂
Multiple soups! 😂
Jonny was robbed.
Make thessa do the chef part! She’s so funny 😂😂
I've missed this show!!! I love everything about it, keep it coming!!! 😍
BEST SHOW EVER!!!!!!!
Keith's "yeah I know, that's what it's like here" had big actual restaurant kitchen staff energy.
Keith's rage at the end had me dying
This is my favourite series on Youtube, hands down!
What did Thessa do to deserve this chaos?! She seems like a wonderful human who came in with no expectations and left with no taste buds remaining 😂
i really love johnny and marisa all the characters they have on the show are great
who does the opening voiceover because i love it
I can’t wait for multiple soup macaroons
During judging the girl's food, Keith looks so done 😂 she's so animated, arms all over the place and Keith is just 🙃
Keith master baker flashbacks!!!  I just want you to know, Keith, I am so proud of you cause those macarons looked AmAzInG!! You came a long way and I find your breakdown at the end understandable! (I am cackling, please Keith is so funny!!)
loved the marissa addition
I just can’t wait for the day Jonny wins. He can’t leave the show until he has a victory!
Jonny is the best.  He cracks me up like no one else.  Poor Jonny.  Always the bridesmaids, never the bride.  The show is well conceived and well formatted but I think Jonny is the thing that absolutely kills me each time.  Love seeing Jimmy back too.  Just love every iteration of this.
By far one of my favorite series! 😂
I think Jonny should never win so that he can always be on. He's my favourite. I love this series.
Appreciation comment for Marissa♡ she's so cute I love her
I'm dying laughing 🤣. This is my favorite series!
I laughed so hard that I cried. Usually I fast forward through parts of without a recipe, but this one I EAGERLY watched every second
i love rachel's "yes darling?" shes such a sweet human and i hope she is THRIVING.
I loveeee Jonny and it makes me so happy you guys continue to invite him to this shows!! Also great to see Nick again!! I love the bagels episode of war!
This series is everything, thank you
I absolutely love Jonny! He's a gem 💕
I don't want to remember a world before I knew Jonny lived in it, too. Super rad video today, Try Guys Team!🤘🤘🤘👊💙
Hahaha when Keith goes into George Costanza mode 🤣
Everybody is talking about Johnny, but imo Nick steals the episode :D
I would love it if they had an English person on this show with Keith; to start with, we don’t have cake flour and have different sugars so I’m sure there would be more chaos 😂
I'd love to see an episode where its reversed and Keith has to explain a recipe with keywords missing from the recipe card. It would be chaos.
I know Rachel has previously planted things in hopes they fuck up and use it and I can only imagine that was her plans w the cheese wiz and that’s why she’s our fav producer
Shes trying to hard to be funny I do not find her funny at all. She would be better on blippi
Yessss More phoning it innnn
I start to believe, that it is more realistic that we will achieve world peace, than seeing Jonny win one of these episodes. But I wont give up hope, we are rooting for you Jonny!! You deserve it!
Every time after I watch a new episode I cycle through all the old episodes because it is so good!
I think Keith was robbed. Yes, the tomato soup idea was stupid, LOL, but they looked beautiful! That's difficult to achieve.
Better luck next time 😂
SABATAGE
I refuse to believe Jonny and Keith lost this one. At this point they’re just trying to keep Jonny around as long as possible
Poor Keith!! 😂😂😂
You could incorporate steak into a flour theme: chicken/country fried steak
Honestly the macarons looked fantastic! Kieth and Jonny shoulda won
you should do the opposite. where an idiot with no recipe gives directions to a chef
I love angry Keith! can't wait for the multiple soup macarons!
It's absolutely insane that they expect them to use one small oven between the two of them.
SABATOGE!!!
Petition to make Jonny the fourth Try Guy! 💚 (Then the TG would be 1/2 gay) 😁
MULTIPLE SOUPS
LMAO POOR JONNY ALWAYS LOSING 😭😭😭
I haven't finished, but if Jonny doesn't win, I'm going to cry
johnny deserves a award for agreeing to come back to do this each time
Is Marissa actually that bad at cooking? Or like is there acting going on???
I know Jimmy Wong as Jodie Foster
imo, Jonny should be the 4th Try Guy, just sayin'
I want reversed roles with this.   I´m not sure how it would work, but I imagine something like this: Let Keith give a chef directions, but all Keith has for orientation are two lists: One with ingredients (some red herrings in there as well) and the other being a list with measurements (like 100ml, 3 table spoons, etc.). He basically has to come up with a way to combine things from the list into something he thinks works / fits the recipe name. And at the end, the chef gets 30min without them to fix the dish in whatever way they still can.  Or simply have a chef try to fix a TryGuys dish to make it end up professional. Like, how to desalt a pretzel dough or how to fix too much booze in Eugenes next cake dough, but without knowing what exactly went wrong so far. Let the TryGuys do the first half of a given topic without a recipe, and have a chef try to fix it without knowing what the dish is.
cant wait for broccoli cheddar macaroons
MULTIPLE SOUPS! I'm wheezing 🤣
Can't wait to see Mr. Kwesi vex next week! My favorite unofficial Try Guy. Love you guys. 💙💣📞♨
HOW DID JONNY AND KEITH NOT WIN
Honestly I feel like nick was a super underrated judge on without a recipe lol “I think you should pursue other means of honoring your father” was a really iconic moment  Edit: okay guys I get it, his partner was the one that said it. I still think that nick was a fantastic judge on WAR and enjoyed having him on this episode too.
Honestly Johnny Cakes is my favorite addition to the Try universe
I still don’t know what tomato water is
Johnny not winning again despite Marissa's messiness and that salsa-ish thingy is soo funny LOL 😂😂
Easily has become one of my favorite series on this channel hands down! 💙💙💙
Jonny is a legend
Don't know who Marissa is but I liked her!
LOLOLOL I am so angry at the winner(both did amazing).
Keith starting turning into tomato soup at the end
nick “the simplest things go wrong” johnny *grinning ear to ear lounging in the booth* 😂😂 i’m so glad this show is staying 13:10
Jonny was ROBBED
-¿Do you have Italian roots? -No -Say yes -Yes   I died
I absolutely love this show.  And we get Kway-Z next time??!! I have no idea how to spell his name, but I'm always happy when he's in episodes!
We've already watched them try Macarons twice, this is not going to end well.
I'm sorry but the rugelach should not have been conceived into existence. also team adhd ftw
You guys dont know how excited I was when a new episode of phoning it in came out
“At a certain point, I decided to… pivot.” 💀☠️
"Next time I make macarons, you know what I'm makin'?! MULTIPLE SOUPS."
JohnnyCakes is my favorite recurring member
I’m so proud of Keith making those macaroons
This is such a good show
Genuinely get so excited for this series please more!!!
Keith’s Macaron’s look like pretty patties and I absolutely loved them!! This was such a good episode, I love this series
SABOTAGE!
can we set up Garrett Watts with Jonny
"Judges, what do you think about the competitors execution?"..."We are in favor of it."
were r the other try guys at? this chick just ruined the vib big time. and shes annoying as hell
Damn Keith was robbed
I can’t believe Johnny has not won yet. Like I feel like it’s statistically impossible at this point.
We better get that episode of multiple soup macaroons
I love this series SO much, holy sh...
They always get like max quarters, I'm waiting one day for someone to get one
i fancy Marissa
Omg I am in love with ALL of this! 😂
“Honestly, that’s above my pay grade” should be my new motto at work now 😂😂😂
Keith can we get a solo show for Keith fans😩
Honestly Keith is great!! He could carry the try guys alone😂
Keith: I don't like fragrances Why did that make me laugh so hard?
Im gunna say it.  Not a fan of marissa on this one😅😅😅  Sorry that's just my hot take
I thought Keith had in the bag! Fun video!
An absolutely wonderful cast of characters today! Loved the cooks, the chefs, the judges, they were all great. So proud of Keith for that macaron redemption compared to his previous attempts 😂😂😂
jonny is to this series what ryan is to puppet history and I love it
loving this series. fresh and Chaotic!
Seriously what the fuck is tomato water
the macarons looked like pretty Patties
I know we're not doing a 4th try guy. But if we were, Johnny would have my vote.
Love this series so much
Still waiting for Jonny to win a competition someday
I want Jonny to win so bad!! I’m rooting for him every time
They misspelled meringue
I needed the Keith freak out at the end. I couldn’t stop laughing. MULTIPLE SOUPS is a T-shirt that needs made.
I feel like Keith has found his new villain origin story with Macarons🤣🤣🤣😈
As a pastry chef who literally just finished randomly making rugelach this was so satisfying and slightly relatable
Can she stop screaming D:
DAD WAKE UP THE TRY GUYS POSTED ANOTHER PHONING IT IN
MULTIPLE SOUPS !!!
Why would Marisa and Nick be adorable together
once again I said "oh Jonny has this one in the bag" before judging and then he still lost
Without a Recipe Soups Edition, but Keith makes soup macarons
i'm gonna be so sad once johnny wins 😂😅😂
Best show yet! Never get rid of Jonny and Keith
Why do I wanna see Gordon Ramsey and Eugene teamed up on this 🤣
Oh my gosh Johnny is never going to win 😂
bring back zach and eugene!
some of the subtitles were a lil wonky but didn't take away from the overall video. just letting yall know!
Damn, that girl is hella annoying and I even have adhd
at this point they just have to keep up johnnys losing streak.
Nooo i thought for sure Johnny had it this time but i gotta say Marissa is very much like me in the kitchen so seeing her be validated by winning felt good!! She did great
I'd love to see this in reverse. The chefs have to make some that the phoners come up with but the phoners are the recipe they must follow. They are essentially the mouth and the chefs are the arms only.  No input from the chefs, no taking it their own way.
not a fan of marissa
ugh i want them to have a gas stove for the ppl cooking, watching the arbitrary 1-8 setting made me like nOOOOO!!
Great job on the macarons! They looked pretty good.
can alix traeger come on as a chef, i feel like she’d be so fun!!! OR A JUDGE???
"I just took my Adderall, so I'm feeling good but also sweaty," I fucking love her hahaha 😂
Haha, Johnny and Keith's "we're classy!" dynamic was fun.
DANG IT, SOMEONE GIVE JOHNNY A WIN!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I couldn’t figure out where I recognised Nick in the thumb nail but I’m so glad they had him back, I loved them on the bagel ep!
Not me watching going ‘oh yay a Keith meltdown’ 😂
i love Jonny!!!
Soup cookie? Keith, I have no words
Please can  we have more Marissa?she is the best 😂
So multiple soups right. I suggest pea soup and french onion. Then the classic chickensoup and a redo of the Tomato soup!
Is it just me or Marissa looks like a bubbly Aubray Plaza?
Jonny has to do these until he wins!
Keith dear....would the tomato soup macaron work if you mixed the filling with one of those tomato soup packets? That way it wouldn't get too soggy but still be tomato flavored? 🤔
I'm in LOVE with Marissa!!! She's SO cute n naturally hilarious 🫶🏽 SAAABOTAGE!! 🤭🤣
The Wheel of Mayhem should be a dartboard, but each epidsode its a different dart game.... You could even use the wheel of mayhem to decide which!! LOL
She knows offset spatula bout doesn’t know how to turn on the induction top🤔
I swear they don’t pick Johnny just to keep him
Multiple soups!! 😂
I loved Marissa and her energy but Keith and Johnny were robbed!!
i didn't think I'd love something more than WAR but this is so much fun. Johnny is fantastic and I love Marissa. I feel like someone new starting back where the Guys used to be really adds a fun aspect to this kind of series. More please!!
I kind of miss without a recipe, but this is all right for now. xD
They're just pulling a Puppet History where the bit is that Johnny just never wins
Miss Zach or Eugene
At this point I think they’re just taunting Johnny lol
They should do a spin off where they get professional chefs to try and get their crazy without a recipe ideas to work
I love Jonny so much. Him and Keith worked really well together and I was rooting for a win. But I also want Jonny to always be on this show so 🤷‍♀️🤣
I have to say, these are some of the best looking results I've seen on Phoning It In! Like they both looked really appetizing and pretty!
Love Keith's freak outs
Please never ever stop this series. I LOVE it :D
Poor Johnny
I love this show 😂😂😂😂😂
I fucking love the guest judge so much ❤️❤️❤️ ADHD unite
This is great, but without a recipe is epic
I love jimmy
While I enjoy phoning it in it is getting old. It would be nice if the Try Guys mixed it up some.
I'm convinced they hate Johnny Cakes 🤔😡
This series must continue at least until Johnny gets a win!!
Jonny's curse of losing reminds me of Ryan's experience on the Puppet History😂 One day, Jonny, one day... you'll win the cup!
So good! 😂 I love Keith’s reactions
Ok ok! How about our fave Eat the Menu guest Jared Popkin be a guest cook here???? Omg! I'd be so happy!
When Johnny lost I literally THREW my phone. I’m rooting for him until he wins!
Keith is MVTG again.  Most Valuable Try Guy
at this point they have to be conspiring to make sure jonny doesn't win lmao he keeps getting so close😂😂
The amount of chaos in these episodes is great.
MULTIPLE SOUPS
Seriously what on earth is tomato water
This episode cracked me up, especially during the judging. Keep this series going! Love the chaos!
SABOTAGE!!!
I laughed out loud at multiple soups
They chefs should have to answer try guy trivia for quarters 😂😂
Marissa is so funny!!! Love herrr 🫶🫶🫶
Imagine doing this when wireless earphones weren't a thing yet. Lol
Love this series!! ❤
Anyone have ptsd from the tomato macaron’s 🫢
Keith acting surprisingly calm😄 Okay, I commented this while watching it. After watching it.. I was wrong
This show is now one of my favorites! Love it! 😂
Jonnycakes in a beret. Why is there not a double-like button?!!!!
Nick was such an awesome guest chef!!
MMarissa.... Sweet, sweet angel. Please never cook again.
This is truly one of the greatest show ideas out there!! Obsessed with everything about it
I really love phoning it in more than without a recipe. Seeing the mistranslations of instructions from a culinary professional to someone who doesn’t have that knowledge makes for such fun entertainment
Marissa had the funniest most cartoon-like expressions i dieedd
Is Johnny not winning just a bit at this point? Otherwise I don't understand why his team lost
Keith is single-handedly carrying this channel and I have no complaints. We love Keith! 💜
This was so amazing and Keith blowing up at the end was the best part, been missing that!! Can't wait for the next one!
I can't eat while watching this show because I'm scared of choking on food while laughing 😂
I love that they're bringing in past judges from Without a Recipe!! And that Jonny is a regular now lol, this is one of my new favorite series!!
Marissa is a dream!! And I’m here for the producers playing this long con of driving JohnnyCakes crazy and eventually will become a TryGuys super villain! Can’t wait!
It’d be cool if they did different mid game challenges, but I’m so happy there’s another episode
Poor Jonny is starting to have the experience of Ryan on Puppet History 🤣
Wow, I'm sitting down to have macaroons with my breakfast this morning, and do I see in my inbox but a new Phoning It In about macaroons??? Perfect!
Not Jonny losing again💀💀
"Jonny will be back until he wins" I'm here for it
MULTIPLE SOUPS LOLOLOLOLOL
If Keith loses another with savory food I think he might explode 😂😂😂
ok but Keith's macarons were looking so good 🤯
16:16 her squawk yell in the background 🤣🤣🤣
Can't wait for the day Keith wins a challenge with a soup flavored macron. I will watch as many episodes as it takes to do it too!
I KNOW FOR A FACT keith had many flashbanks this episode
“who even knows what tomato water is” 😭
Can’t wait to watch kwesi!
i'm surprised you put two experienced ppl and two inexperienced ppl together
I watched this whole episode and I still don’t know what tomato water is😭
Come on, I thought this time Johnny will win by seeing this comparison.
Jonny cakes 💕❤️🎂💯
i want jonny to be the newest try giy
Marissa made me want to bash my head against a wall.
The ending 😆 MULTIPLE soups!! F*ck yeah Keith!!! 🔥
I’m always rooting for Jonny cus I just want him to get a win, but omg I didn’t expect to love Nick and Marissa as much as I do 😭♥️
Putting Keith and Jonny together seems unfair since they’ve both done the show before. HOWEVER, the chemistry and chaos of Nick and Marissa is everything I could’ve ever wanted.
They could've used sun-dried tomatoes too. Blended them, use as top garnish. Or rehydrate/boil them for a concentrated tomato flavour and saved time.
"Sabotage" merch when?
When Johnny leaves I will be vastly sad
MULTIPLE SOUPS
I kinda want Johnny Cakes to be the fourth Try Guy
I would love to see the reactions of the chefs when they watch the footage of guys baking!! Esp last episode when Keith poured the cream into the ice cream maker and it fell onto the floor.
Johnny is the Susan Lucci of phoning it in.
Marissa is precious. my heart dropped for Jonny not winning but also at this rate I hope he doesn't so he stays haha.
Would love to see phoning it in but instead of cooking, its some type of crafting. That way Johnny can be on the other end of the phone!
the way  Jimmy's @ links to his brothers account and not his is so funny to me
the fact she is on adderaLL and still cant focus for one second tells me adderalL SUCKKKS.... AND for the record i know adderall is prescribed to people for a specific reason but its also a very addictive substance that most people dont even know is basically JUST like meth....  which can be triggering to like any addict on here....  and i know on the podcast they do say use pain killers if absolutely necessary but they note its addictive... they should do the same thing when announcing multple people like kelsey and her are on it and it could be triggering. im just saying... stay woke people... adderal is literally an Amphetamines STAY WOKE.....
Team oui oui 😭🤣🤣
Johnny will never win💔
cheese wiz should've sponsored
oh Jonny! you will win eventually, but glad we'll see you again haha
Absolutely obsessed with this series!!!!
I swear there's a conspiracy against Jonny 😭🤣
man keith sure loves poisoning judges
"sal...sa" is sending me
Thessa is so charming, humble, and so gorgeous!!! Please have her on more!!
I feel like to be fair, there should be two full ovens in the kitchen as this is a frequent pain point
Marissa is an angel and I love her
I just want Jonny to win so bad ;-;
I always love a good Jimmy Wong x Try Guys collab! They really work together so well. Also the way Keith so confidently said "Mmmultiple soups!" has me in tears with laughter 😂
Petition to let Johnny win a game show for once
I feel stressed just watching Marissa
Everybody is so creative
Marissa reflects my soul
I love this series so much. It’s hysterical! Looking forward to this one making it to the food network, too!
I want a shirt with colorful macarons that says "multiple soups" 😂
i love this series so much!
I'm so glad this series is continuing. My mother's going into surgery in a week and Phoning it In and WAR are her favorite things to watch. She hasn't watched the latest season yet or any of these new episodes in full, so I'm making her a playlist to watch while she's recovering. Thank you guys and the crew for all the hard work you put into this series. <3
I freaking love this series XD  But hear me out. Josh vs Nick
No first letter for you, only uarters and lay again
This series fills me with so much joy. ❤
I like these but like without a recipe more lol
love jonny so much he's so funny and I'm always routing for him
Keith’s loss rages never fail to make me die laughing 😂
if we could have phoning it in and without a recipe every year, it would be a godsend of entertainment
A phoning it in tournament would be cool….kinda like a March madness
I love this series!
I love when Keith gets mad
Please oh my god let Jonny win ONCE 😭😭😭
is it just gonna be a running gag that jonny doesnt win? lmfao
lets goooo, showing off pretty much the equivalent of doing hard drugs in the form of adderall pill form WOOOOO!!!
Marissa and Nick are so funny 🤣
Also Keith and Johnny were robbed lol but I’m glad we’ll have another video with Johnny
I love this show
Marisa every 2 mins: sabotage!
Ah Keith. I love it every time he just rages in cooking videos😆
Kinda pisses me off when you just call Keith an idiot
I like Marissa she is so cute.
Well, maybe Jonny will win with Kwesi by his side... one can hope 😅 I agree with everyone though, he's a total gem!
Make the guys give instructions to friends.
Omg I love the judging and the acting and guessing.
I love this concept!!! Yall could put anyone on this show and I'd watch it
I really want Gordon Ramsey to be a chef on this show.
poor jonny cant get a win
You’d be suspicious that Johnny loosing is a bit but nah, I’d have voted for the other team every time too
13:42 actually macarons don’t have to sit for 45 minutes. You can go ahead and bake them and they will have a foot, regardless if they sat out. Speaking as someone who has tested it out- and baked many macarons without the 45 min delay.
Rachel's "Yes, darling?" is the kind of response a kind mum would give when their kid cries for them from the other end of the house like "Muuuuum! 😩🥺" ahdjjsks
So glad they got a second oven. The Keith vs Eugene episode was just unfair
I love this, but I really don't like the "one oven" drama. It feels forced & unfair. Outside of THAT, kudos! 😂👍
I can't wait for Keith's "Souparons"!
Nick's "I am so talented" threw me lol
Double the hurt was felt when the winner was announced. Poor Keith and Jonny 😂. Congrats to the newcomers, Marissa and Nick, welcome to chaos😂🎉❤
I want a video of Keith successfully making his soup macarons. Like maybe him and Johnny actually in the kitchen making them together and making them taste good. Make Keith's soup macaroon dream come true.
macarons are hard enough doing them yourself 😂
Don’t let Jonny win so he stays on forever pls
Poor Johnny cakes
Such class and elegance displayed by Jonny and Keith in this episode 💁🏻‍♀️
I love Marissa! Such a fun episode! Thank you!
Marissa & Nick are hilarious together 😂
This is actually one of my favorite things on YouTube
I was wondering why Zach wasn't in this episode, but then I saw that one of the chefs who trashed on his bagel was there, and he still might have rage burning inside of him  Edit: Nevermind now I know he was in the hospital
I truly hope Food Network gives you a 2nd Try with Phoning it in. It's a great show!
Love Jonny he is so funny 😂
I love the extra chaos of this show. And I love Jonny just getting more and more done with the guys but also loving them simultaniously
Best series ! My mom likes it too 😂
I only know Marissa for 33 minutes but if anything happens to her I’m killing everyone and then myself
Truly what the fuck is tomato water
There is a BIG difference between CHEEZ WHIZ and EASY CHEESE!!!🤣
"Time management is gonna be of the utmost importance." - Has a contestant that has ADHD 😂
This is the calmest I have ever seen Keith in a cooking video
No joke about the egg whites looking like a tub of seamen is proof Keith is growing up. 😂       (Misspelling intentional to avoid YT deleting comment.)
i love this series so much
This is my favorite episode of Phoning It In. I couldn't stop laughing 😂
Does anyone know...what is Tommato water?
Aww it was because it was underbaked. The macarons looked so good!
Keith's soup cookie dream could be a whole other series 😆  Also would love a shirt that just says MULTIPLE SOUPS
"Rachel!" "Yes, darling?☺" "Is there a bigger food processor?" "No~"  Lmao I love Rachel
Jonny makes every episode fun wow
I love love love this series its so fun!
The second Jonny wins, they have to announce the new rules are the winner stays on to defend their title instead. I just want any excuse to keep him on every episode.
I swear Keith's tomato soup flavor sabotaged johnny. I feel so bad for him being paired up with Kieth. Soup does not belong in a cookie.  Then again Kieth is presented as an IDIOT. So it is fitting.
honestly though, everyone on this show is so funny and i'm looking forward to the next one 💖💖💖
"I'm gonna do it again. Next time we make Macarons, you know what I'm makin? Multiple soups." 🤣😂
There are actual tears in my eyes over their reactions to the tomato soup macaron 😂😭🤣☠️
The try guys is basically just Keith now haha
I'm so down for Johnny being another unofficial but pretty official try guy 😂
We may never know what was truly meant by tomato water...
I love the sudden switch up with the chefs during judging lmao !! “Who knows what tomatoe water is?” 😂 Nick is awesome in this lol
Johnny cakes for every cooking video please . He makes every video he’s in better , I love when he judges too !
✨multiple soups ✨
I absolutely love this episode but there is a typo where the judges eat a certain macaron, it says Orance instead of Orange
Favorite thing on YouTube right now!
This could truly be a food network series!!! Im obsessed!!!
Don’t worry, Jonny, I’ll keep rooting for you till you win 😂
Gotta appreciate Jonny for going along with the tomato soup flavor even though he knew from the start that it was a bad idea
i loved keith in this video ahaha, he was a whole mood
It's funny how they only refer to Keith and Zach as "idiots" but not Eugene or guest cooks 😆  I love this series so much!
I’m gonna win this episode I can feel it in my bones!
that workstation is QUAITY if she put something that hot on it and it isn't an issue
why is marissa me thoughhhhhhh
Johnnys hat lmao nice to see Nick back!! Knew he looked familiar 😂
more marisa more marisa more marisa!!!
Keith made macarons!  They had feet!  And cheese lol
Jonny is so freaking funny hahahaha his explanations of the food 😭😭 keep him on as long as possible lmao
Love this series SO MUCH!!! XD
Marissa is the female version of Zach
"YOU NEVER HAD SOUP AS A COOKIE??!! NOW THAT'S AN IDEA!!!"
You have to ask yourself, if Keith has a stroke while screaming "Multiple Soups", would I still be laughing?
I just love the synergies between the pairs. Esp Jonny and Keith are so fun
I never knew I needed multiple soup macaroons until this day
would love the judge who wore the pink jumpsuit from the cheesecake episode to be a coach!
Johnny has to win ones of these. I’m rooting for him!
Hands down my favorite Try Guys series
I loved Nick and Marissa's dynamic, they were so fun! 🧡
Jodie foster?
Keith: "so I'm going to leave the door open" Me, a student who knows nothing about cooking: KEITH NO
This is amazing! I really enjoyed it, couldn't stop laughing 🤣
This was awesome 👌
I cannot wait for multiple soups
We love the adhd representation 😂❤ I feel you girl! I too am sweaty and ready after I take mine
I love watching your videos 😍😍🖤😹 especially without a recipe and phoning it in.... keep doing what you guys are doing coz you're amazing 🖤✨ sending lots of love from india ✨🖤
Omg it’s the bagel guy!!!
The “ohh grEAAaaat” has me crying
Poor judges haha 🤣
I love this damn show. XD
Keith's "Do you think anyone in France has ever done this?" while frosting the macron with cheese wiz killed me.
“I’m not a great multitasker, Nick” “That’s….not great to hear”  😂😂
This is such a great show, watching the "chef's" describe their dishes and the methods that were done makes it so entertaining
Poor Johnny! I demand a recount!
Jonny’s «I can do hard stuff too» was legit adorable.
Idk who marrisa is but i love her energy
This was seriously such a genius idea for a series. I think I said it on the first ones as well but genuinely this feels like a Food Network TV show. Like, can't you just imagine this done Worst Cooks In America style???? I would watch the shit out of it!!
i love jonny
My next go-to phrases are "Sabotage!" and "Multiple soups!"
I feel like Keith and Johnny should have won but I also feel like they don’t want Johnny to leave so he can’t win 😂
Johnny: "grab the almond flour..." Keith: INSTANT DREAD LOL
I love seeing marissa on here! I’ve seen some of her ads which are cute. She’s so funny & love the chaos of this show & everyone!
This series is SO GOOD
Are we supposed to know who Marissa is?
im putting "SABOTAGE" to my vocabulary whenever the universe starts giving me minor inconveniences
I definitely heard Zach's laughter
Johnny definitely pissed off someone working there because at this point there's no way he hasn't won
Everyone's draw dropping surprise at the macarons was just great!
*the wind blows* Marissa: “SABOTAGE” 😂
Jonny was ROBBED those macarons were INCREDIBLE given the constraints of the show!!
I'm loving the WAR judges coming back as Phoning It In contestants!  Roy Choi needs to compete to heal the trauma caused by judging the birthday cakes episode.
That girl yells too much... She's annoying
They called it Cheese Whiz over and over again, but it was clearly Easy Cheese. Also, did they really never tell us what tomato water is?
Oh thank god it’s not that good mythical kitchen guy. He’s so annoying lol
This is ultimate chaos and I am here for it!!!!
I was very proud of Marissa
I didn’t think they could find someone worse than Zach in the kitchen, th eh might just have.
The true saboteur was whoever left the Cheez-Wiz on the set. That bottle wrecked everybody.
I love this damn series! Keep up the amazing content Try Fam!
what is tomato water ?
This series is so funny, I love it!
Love this series. ❤
Keith deserved the W on this one
I’m team: never let Johnny win so he’ll have to stay forever. 🤩
Keith didn't do well in Without A Recipe at all, but he is not giving up.
“I’m glad you took initiative” “Rachel yelled at me and told me to keep going” 🤣🤣🤣
Is Jonny turning into the Zack of early without a recipes? 😭😭😭
One of my favourite things in this series is when chef #1 leans out of their phone booth to ask chef #2 what on earth they've been asking their contestant to do because they're making so much noise.
I just want Jonny to win even if it's just once. I love him so much.
I’m torn because I love Jonny so I want him to win but also I love Jonny so I want him to keep losing so he’s in more episodes 😂
Hate seeing jonny lose but kinda love keith’s reaction to losing 😂❤
Was hoping when Keith asked for a flavor he would ask to do Daddy’s Favorite
I love this show. That it all.
I’m loving this series!!!
The best way to ruin macarons is to make them Depressing sad depressing cookie
They should have mic ear pieces for the judging part… way funnier
keith i support you to make macaroon soups! multiple!
I love Eugene but I hate when he’s in these types of episodes I think it’s a little more fun when people take it a little seriously.
Rigged!!!  Johnny is one of the most beautiful men on the planet, and for THAT reason alone he should win. Oh, and Keith. Yea him. JOHNNY!!! JOHNNY!!!
Keith was robbed on this one!
Keith putting cheese wiz in a piping bag only to pipe it out like it came straight from the can has me DECEASED 💀🤣
can’t wait for the multiple soup macarons tbh
ROFLOLASTC
THE OUI OUIS SHOULD HAVE WON WHEN WILL WE GET THE JONNY SWEEP
Now I want to see a minestrone macaron...
Calling it that they’re pulling a Yes or No and are rigging it so Jonny is on the whole season.
My head hurts from laughing. This is the best one yet 😂
therapists should recommend the try guys as a cure for depression.
“will be back until he wins” killed me
one day Johnny will win 😔✊
Keith did a pretty great job actually - just needed a little more time for the baking (and he recognized it when he took them out of the oven). Much improved from the last time he did macarons!
Jonny is never escaping this show. He is trapped here forever
I loveee this series with all my heart 😂❤️
I want Jonny to get his win but never want him to leave lmao I'm so torn.
Love that Keith gets to redo his 'savor the summer' macaron and it not be a puddle of a cookie
Keith just won't let the soup macaroon die
It's only one try guy...why?? Where is Eugene or Zach? 🫤
I think Keith and Jonny should have won!!!
Will Johnny ever win? Lmao. But I love that this was a redemptive try for Keith and his macarons ❤
SABOTAGE!!!!  Needs to be on a t shirt or something 😭
Why do I feel like Johnny can’t win yet because that would be such a good finale and they’re probably saving that episode 😂
Johnny is the Zach of phoning it in.
Can we talk about how awesome of a last name "Diadem" is? Is this her actual real name?  On another subject, can somebody actually explain wtf tomato water is?
Food Network should be kicking themselves for not coming up with this idea first lol
I love this series
if jonny will be here until he wins, i guess we can call jonny the permanent 4th member to the try guys parade
I loved Marissa energy here! Pls add her to more of your videos!
marissa making me feel some type of way
i think this is my favorite series other than without a recipe!! it’s so funny with johnny and feels so new
Rachel is the true chaos mastermind behind all this HAHA
Do they let Johnny go home in between shoot days or is he just held captive until he wins? Lol I hope Johnnys ok
who is marissa? why should i root for her?! can we get a lil description or backstory or something
will jonny ever win anything?
How many times they gonna make those?
Never thought I’d like anything as much as without a recipe, yet here we are 😂
Can we get a two-part special where Keith attempts to make soup-flavored macarons and Eugene the Rank King rates which soups taste best when macaron-ified?
this show is so funny, all the guests really come thru too, today's guest looked a little spooked and shy but she also was sooo funny thru the judging lmao
haven't finished the video yet but there is something very heart warming about seeing johnny give tips to make keith's old tomato soup and grilled cheese macaroons. wonderful redemption, i hope they win now honestly lskdls
Jonny’s Anger Translator is Keith. 😂😂😂
It turns out tomato water was the friends we made along the way.
Marissa has the best chaotic best friend vibes and it's why I love her ♥️
marissa confirming everything twice in a desperate bid to not fuck up teaspoon vs tablespoon is such an enormous adhd mood
its a small thing but could we stop with the “idiot” thing? its rooted in discrimination against disabled ppl, perhaps instead you could say “itll be phoned to….this guy!” w crickets or something 💞👍🏽
Is marissa on the try guys team??? I’ve never seen her before
Love this idea. Can’t wait for the new ep.
I love how theyre bringing in past chef judges from WAR to be in phoning it in,, mayhaps well see Ro as a contestant in future episodes 👀
Marissa breaking during the judging and yelling “What the fuck is a tomato water!?” will always be my favorite thing 😂😂😂
Nick I’m sorry but you are a terrible communicator
I love how they made the chefs DEFEND their creations and not allow them to blame the idiots.  I feel bad for the chefs but I was laughing out loud at the same time. 😅🤣
So now this series is, let's give Johnny everyone till he wins, one of these days it'll work. Honestly though if Keith didn't choose to make a soup cookie, I think they would have been great.
I know they have to work with what they have, but this 1 oven thing sucks.
I love this series so much
IM CRYING FROM LAUGHTER I LOVE THISSS
Johnny and Kieth genuinely deserved the win; those macaron had feet!!!!!
Johnny’s got bring in a win eventually 😂
Johnny was sooo not having it this time
Guys .. you reaaally have to think about a Rosana Pansino vs Jonny episode with Zach and Keith as contestants
Johnny, a professional baker: okay, i’m gonna pick lavender and blueberry.  Keith, master of chaos: and I’ll pick orange and tomato soup.   I love my chaos dads
This and without a recipe are really battling for my heart 😊
“SABOTAGE”
PLEASE bring Matty Matheson on the show
Can we please get a spin-off series of Keith making his soup cookies??? I would watch the shit out of that!!
I think the best part is when the chefs try to sell it as their own, as if they made it.
gay or pretend to be gay to be in this cult
I want Jonny in every video pls
I’d rather without a recipe 😢
I love this show, and Jonny is a gem. I love him and his interactions with the guys.
Keith yelling "Multiple Soups" made me laugh so hard that my husband thought something was wrong with me 🤣 You go, Keith!  Follow your dream of soup cookies!
Manic friend and ADHD friend
“AND I’LL DO IT AGAIN” Keith honey please refrain from threatening the chef’s with their lives on camera like that 😂
Oh, after watching the preview for next week's episode, I love how your previous guest chefs from both cooking series are open, willing and happy to participate in this series! Keep 'em coming!
I love this series! As much as I want Jonny to win...I also don't want him to win so that it is a guarantee that he is in the next episode! His vibe goes so well with all three of the guys! His banter with Zach is amazing..."I know right? F*ck you" [without a recipe] and "baby, when did you ever eat an eggshell"? [Phonin it in] 😂 my favorites
Love this series. It's really great.
jonny was ROBBED this episode omg
Can we just thank Keith for carrying this channel since Ned’s departure! 👏🏼
When Nick with a mouthful of his everything something said, "ummhmm...I'm so talented" I just died!! 🤣🤣🤣
If Keith would just taste things as he went he probably would do better at these
I love how everyone is such a good sport in this series!!!
judges: hate the soups keith: You know what im making? MULTIPLE SOUPS *small angry keith noises*
who is marissa? am i like behind or something
great episode, but the "MMMMMultiple soups" at the end absolutely killed me
Clam chowder macarons or go home!
"Sabotage" merch in the future 🤣
Marissa is the ADHD representation I needed. I feel so valid and so seen. 😂
I don't know if it's the edit or the judging, but something about the ending of this episode is OFF. Based on the entire storyline, the judging comments, everyone's individual reactions, it makes no sense that the rugelach won. Is it just so Johnny can finally get his victory later? What's the point of game show content if we're going to script season winners according to a preset narrative?
this series is so creative, original, entertaining, and fun. I absolutely love it
We are blessed!
MULTIPLE SOUPS 💀
💚💚💚Jonny Cakes
Just can't get much better than this. So excellent
"MULTIPLE SOUPS" took me out 🤣
Wow I look great in a beret
It's clearly rigged, given one person made slightly underdone Macarons, and the other made A ROLLED UP PIZZA with a cheese/tomato dip. Not to mention the dough was clearly underdone on the pizza as well, but somehow that didn't count?
I really love this show
I love Nick. This guy is hilarious
Johnny should just stay forever
is it me or why does keith reacted like an anger translator for jonny
I’m really excited their making rugula. Yes it is probably spelled wrong
Rugelach! Yes!!!!
Johny will be forever stuck in this series🤣🤣
Free idea - carnival games to get the quarters! Ring toss, pop the balloon, etc!
Still loving this series! Marissa was rly funny, and the Jonny/Keith match up was great!  I used to not get why the "idiot hands" of the chefs would be "hidden" from the judges, but the judging portion during this episode really proved to me how funny it can get when it's set up like that
MmmmmmmmmmmULTIPLE SOUPS
I love how the Try Guys are now just like unofficially a cooking channel 😂❤️
Keith, please stop trying to make tomato soup and grilled cheese macarons happen, you're just going to make more people nauseated.
ROBBERY!!! Keith should've won that without a doubt
"You know what, hitting it sounds right."
Johnny- I can't believe I lost again Ryan, tied up to a chair- First time here?  Also, I'm personally paying Shane with some knitted goods to get Johnny in Puppet History. You know he'd enjoy it.
I LOVE MARISSA! I get so excited every time she makes an appearance, and this time we get her for the WHOLE VIDEO?! This is the BEST day.
I absolutely LOVE that you can hear ZACHs laugh 😂in the back ground at tasting!!!
Raging Keith returns!!
This is my favorite series by far
The pure chaos, is immaculate. All the soups Keith will take over the world.
Rachel replying “Yes Darling?” to Marissa is so sweet 🥲❤️ she’s truly everyone’s mom ❤
I needed some Keith angry rant. Thank you
Marissa is a delight ✨
Johnny Cake for GBBO 2024
Please make Jonny a permanent fixture with Try Guys!!!! He's the best
Keith and Johnny were robbed 😭
My jaw DROPPED when they revealed the macaroons
I love this series and honestly can't believe Jonny hasn't won yet. The judges always seem pleasantly surprised by what his contestant produces but give the win to the opponent instead:'D
Johnny looks like he uses a bit round tip.
Poor Keith... Tomato soup with avenge you dammit! ❣️😆
Is it just me or is marissa and nicks chemistry is off the charts
Really hope johnny wins this one
Best series tied with without a recipe
I LOOOOOOVE THIS SERIES! Also- this may have been my favorite 😍. Marissa screaming sabotage at Rachel was hilarious.
we love marissa!! such a good addition to the series
YESSS MORE PII!!!!! IM SO EXCITED
Keith is always always in the videos. And he does so many other things too. He’s so committed! I know the guys also have their things to do but Keith always comes through! lol
At this point they should invest atleast 3  smeg convection **ovens
This series is just going to be Jonny's villain arch 😆
cant wait for the multiple soups macaroons
In before an hour club heeeeeeeey
I like this series but I don't like the part where they call Keith an idiot during the intro. Keith isn't an idiot, he's cooking without a recipe or by just listening to someone.   I know it's part of the schtick it just makes me sad 😢
I'm sorry I'm just thinking about it (still near the beginning) but macaroons are known for being hard to bake and you decided to do it for phoning it in? That's bold lol. Can't wait to see hoe this turns out
I would like to see the professional chefs teaching the novice chefs how the item was supposed to be made/look
Phoning it in...to an idiot. 🤣🤣🤣
Oh noe. Marissa's annoying. No offense.
Tomato Water: "the liquid that seeps from the ripe flesh after it's been cut" CMONNNNNN WHO KNOWS THAT!?!
God I love me some try guys 😂
LOL Poor Jonny, never winning
Keith screaming “MULTIPLE SOUPS” is never something I thought would hear or expect to kill me like it did. 😂
The *series can't go less creamer or sugarless*
Marissa's teaspoon/tablespoon confirmation is a whole vibe
When you put everything into a rugelach, what you get is the truth:  Keith's making multiple soups.
God I’ve missed angry Keith he’s so funny for NO REASON
Honestly I will be heartbroken when Jonny Cakes wins, because he is SO funny! This series is incredible! 😂
But what IS tomato water?!
what a lovely thing to wake up to
“The mind of a chef… with the hands of an idiot.”   Huh, I think my friend said the same thing when she was teaching me how to cook for her dinner party
can’t tell at this point of they’re deliberately putting Jonny in last place because it’s funny or if the tomato soup macarons were genuinely that bad lmao  Also, Marissa at the end was kinda clutch with the sauce she made cuz I wouldn’t have even tried at that point
Poor Johnny!! I hope he gets a victory soon!
I wasn't to see Keith's Soup Macarons lol.
Can I confess something? I enjoy this more than Without a Recipe 🤫
Jonny, I loved you in, is it cake?!
ngl, Keith DID have an advantage
STILL ROOTING FOR JONNY TO WIN!!!
The absolute chaos of this show is INSPIRING
Nick is sooo cute. Hes like a puppyyy😂
"Multiple soups!"  This is the best phoning it in I've ever seen 😂
nuuuuuuuu let Jonny win already!! 😭
Okay but seriously, what IS tomato water??
SABOTAGE
Just love it when they double down. Hell yeah Keith, make those mUltIPle sOup macarons
I really thought that Johnny Cakes was gonna win this one 😭😭😭
The new chef was NOT ready for the chaos he was about to experience.
Marissa and Nick were so awesome on this episode! I loved their duo and Marissa was so funny cooking. I love that every time they bring in a new person they are pretty much exactly like Zach at the beginning of without a recipe lol
Go Jonny!!!
Unpopular opinion perhaps?  This series is better than Without a Recipe😅
I’m sorry Keith but I love angry Keith yelling when he loses😂😂😂
Johnnyyyyy 😭💕💕
Didn't Keith do Tomato Soup macarons in Without a Recipe too? If memory serves, he also lost that episode. At some point, either he's going to make the most amazing Tomato Soup macarons in the world or he has to throw in the towel
They found someone more chaotic than any of the guys!! MARISSA I LOVE YOU!!!! ❤😂
My names Marissa and I have ADHD too!!😂
muLtIpLE sOOpSSS 😂
This series is the best start to my weekend!!
This is the first time I've seen Marissa but I already love her
Appreciation for the pronunciation of macarons this video! Last time was rough lol
Johnny still hasn't won 😭 poor guy 🤣
I love jonny sm
How tf did Nick win?  Istg they're torturing Jonny on purpose
I lost it at "Multiple Soups!"
This series is everything that's ever been missing from my life.  Jonny and Keith were robbed this episode! The Oui Wee's forever!!
I love phoning it in sooo much!
SUSSY
Oh my god I am so excited! This is easily my favorite series! Let’s go team Jonny!!!
Keith REALLY wanted this to be his redemption round for his failed macarons but this should further prove to him that's not a doable thing 😂🤣😂
Oh c'mon. Johnny needs a win!
I am very excited for the next edition of Keith's soup macarons
MULTIPLE SOUPS 🫵🏻 What a threat omg
The fact is says depositing uarters for a hot second is both hilarious and extremely frustrating (I know it’s cause the glitch effect but it looks like when the light goes out so Walmart is Almart)
This is the best series on the internet
YUH✨
Johnny must ALWAYS be a contestant. He’s always hilarious ❤😂
Man Keith and Jonny got fuckin robbed. Macarons are so difficult to make, especially for a savory man like Keith.
I LOVE JONNY I LOVE JONNY I LOVEEEEE JONNNYYYYY
Johnny as the queen of hearts was absolutely hilarious. I love this guy.
I love how secretive Keith gets every time he screws up. He never wants his chef to know he messed up
LOL - Keith, you forgot the basil!!!!!!
Marissa should be a regular in the try guys roster.
Johnny can rock a beret.
I want Johnny back with Eugene vs. Zach with Josh😂
Keith and Jonny are the duo I never knew I needed and I can never let them go now. Please 🙏🏻 more konny….jeith? Jeith sounds better.
Even if it's 12 am rn, I still watch this! Never fail to make my day 🥳
Nick is awesome
Trust Keith to make something that is three quarters of the way there but fails in the final quarter.. :D
I watched just the first minute, said "Oh no, this is going to be a disaster, I can't wait." And it was AWESOME lmao
Why am I having flashbacks to the time my family sent me to the store for cream of tartar? (I came home with a very large jar of it, and apparently they didn’t want enough cream of tartar to last a decade. I still haven’t lived it down, probably because we still haven’t made a dent in the massive amount of cream of tartar I bought.)
Love you guys ❤️ ❤️ 🔥 🔥 ❤️  ❤️ 🔥 🔥
i love this series so much it’s the perfect combination of chaos and jonny
I really love this series but Marissa is really annoying me-
I was in the middle of watching a video, saw this and I've never clicked on anything so fast. I love this series and Without a Recipe/Without Instructions so much.
lol i love it "french macarons", like "british english"! lol
everytime the chef on the blue side finds out hes running out of time he takes time to say oh no no no no LMFAOOO
Jonny is amazing! I love him so much!
I’m about 18 minutes in but if Keith and Jonny don’t win this with how chaotic Marissa has been this entire episode that will be tough 😂  Edit: Genuinely can’t believe it 😭
I’m a French student so excuse me if I watch this one hysterically crying in a ball on the floor 😂😂😂
Happy Saturday ❤❤
Marissa’s “I just took my Adderall so I’m feeling good but I’m also sweaty” is a whole ADHD mood.
marissa double checking the unit of measurement each time dIRECTLY after chef nick says it is such an unbelievable adhd mood
no cause fr who knows what tomato water is 😭😭😭
You lost me. I am done with Try Guys. It gets more and more boring.
"Haha, he f*cked up!" absolutely sent me.
love this series sooo much never stop pls
this is like the food equivelent of watching a horror / suspense movie
Oh nooooooo not macarons 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 This series is my new favorite!! I was also enjoying Zoogene but that clearly was a “he-who-won’t-be-named” idea that didn’t end up doing well, even if I did love Eugene meeting animals 😜 But this is just hysterical chaos beyond belief and I love it!
Can you guys do a without a recipe series with your crew members?
Wonder change ball and cup for bottle flip be funny . Love the video
Yes!!!! I love that Jonny helped Keith execute on his beloved tomato soup macaron. And Keith’s macarons were beautiful! I love this series.
Giggles and kicks my feet
7:08 "I'm holding it up and it curls like Nightmare Before Christmas" Keith Habersburger my beloved
This series always gives me so many laughs
Food network could never make such a chaotic show
"RACHEL!" 🤣🤣🤣
This series is my EVERYTHING
Devlin’s voiceover is one of my favourite parts of phonin it in fr
Macarons have got to be the hardest recipe for phoning it in😂 I’ve made macarons almost a hundred times but sometimes they just don’t turn out right🥲 I can really only make them in the fall and winter because spring and summer get too humid and the skin will never form
“RACHEL!!!!” Bahahaha I love that she is getting blamed for everything. LOL
Marissa looks like Maggie
These are never long enough 🤣😭
drug use nice
This is the best! I‘ve been sick in bed all day and this just makes my day :)
I didn’t know there could be a show more chaotic than without a recipe 😂
Johnny gives Zach vibes a lot when he is on this series 😂
“What is tartar and how do you cream it?” Same Keith 😭
This is such a great concept ♡
Jonny is going to lose his mind with Keith!!!!!!
Thanks
If Jonny leaves, I will riot. I love him soooo much.
Yes, waking up to a new video and a really tough one as well.
Been on my phone waiting for this to drop!
Try Guys Rule!!!
Not even pretending to make anything today, straight to ruining things lol
This is neck and neck with without a recipe!
IDC I’m always rooting for JonnyCakes to win and be the best culinary chaos agent ever 🔥  P.S. I’m here for the Beret.
French macaroons are the absolute best desserts. Seems like they've all done such a great job with baking.
Miles’s voiceover is the best 😂
Please never quit this series, it's truly a gem guys!! 💚💙💜🧡🎉
Ive never clicked on a notification so fast
oh my god 😭🙏
I’ve missed Miles’ voice
Clearly a classy lady
I've never clicked a notification so fast in my life hahahahaha
Go Johnny I'm routing for you!
The chefs are so funny, really like these series.
this series is awesome!
Yes a female try guy
This series just keeps on getting better and better
phoning it in has got to be my new favorite series. i click immediately every time i see it
hope jhonny wins this one
Hilarious that I was just watching the other macaroon video haha
Marissa! Let's gooo I miss seeing her!
I have never been here so early
first!!!!!! wow it's so empty.   i'm loving this series!!!
Love this series ❤
Love it ❤
KEITH everything you can eat at ZAXBYS best chicken ever for fast food.  You got to try!!!
Wow this is going to be fun
Early af
Justice for Jonny
So early 😭😭
Johnny is the moment w the beret ngl
Omg yes this is the BEST series! 🎉
Never clicked on something so fast!
never been earlier
Yayy
Love this series
I loveeee this series with all my heart 😂😭
LET’S GOOO
At some point, Jonny must be wondering if his 'I know right? f*** you' to Zach is the reason why he is a contestant and not the judge on Phoning it in
wow
