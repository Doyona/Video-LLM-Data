HELLO FRIENDS PLS CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING XX
Tea on the bus was amazing! I did it last time I was in London
7:04 i know i’m 4 years late but does anyone know where the “a joke” clip is from
Too many ads on his vids
Sending Mia to magic Mike has aged like milk 😂
There is no way this was able to be tax write off?
Where’s the igloo?
Watching this back, they should have bought the Hyundai 🤣
Aww bless the second delivery driver he still delivered the item  that was tight he wasn’t to know he was in a race
20 fkn 20
Seeing this after seeing the video where Will forgot he gave James a PS5 is Peak Cinema😂😂😂
Also Noel Fielding on bake off will never sit right, he's meant to be on far better and weirder things.
As a droid user I too would rather blindness than using apple, their shit is shit, it's watered down linux for twats.
Should have gotten the hyundai
that knock got me😂😂
Tesla didnt work out for the best in the end ey.
Yhhhh bcooossss HAVING to ACT PAY!!!!!!?????? JUUUUUUSSSSTTTT so ur able to have MUSIC on the mug attracting CRAPPLE SHIIIIIITTTTEEPHONE FFSSSSSS suuuuuuch seriously absolutely insanely overrated complete and utter bullocks😅 ;;8;)8);))   💩💩🤡🤡🍏🍏🍎🍎📱📱💻💻➡️➡️⬇️⬇️🗑🗑⚠️⚠️📵📵🚫🚫⛔️⛔️
Yo he supports ndl did u know that there will be a collab with ndl X hdl (Hurairah’s defence league)
This video should be called how to go to the euros on the tax man 🤣🤣
Where om earth o you get 33,000 to waste on this stuff
23:20 … thats crazy
not will using a mini helmet to wrap a pressie 😭
18:31 scared the living daylights out of me
your hillarious
Ew a tesla
the side Fuckn eye. Literally me when I'm telling someone I'm over it and do what they ant with me but take me out if where I'm situated. And they keep talking about bs. Or telling me it's fine.  Like no itsnot I want to leave but I'm obligated to fckn work here and I kinda like my fckn benifits or whatever for the shit I do😭😭 I literlakg just turn off and my eyes shoot and I pivot every turn lol like please let my dance skate gymnastics and track come trough xauseim yelling through and getting through within m5 of a second of 4 people if u didn't hear don't talk I me.  Worked too many jobs... Worked way too many jobs 🤣😂 freelancing is my favorite but I need communication so rip
50quid while I spend 2.5 hours perfecting a makeshift backdrop for numerous sized products. White of, editing in post😭😭 I literally cry when I hear the prices of these funny videos and the only thing that makes me continue my stupid career I decided school was useless to even attend to learn when everything what was said I knew but now I know it in legal. Lmfao for 7000k in 3 months I couldn't researched myself but... It's Okay it's hilarious. Can't wait to laugh at it even more when I eventually make a decent living. Cause so far... Not alot. But good timing. Where if I was doing this it'd take so long but be so fun so yeah 1. Sorry I'm a Lil fckn cringe some days 2. Thanks for literally just being one of the few youtubers I can't even name specifically when I started watching that I still do. Cause re runs only last so many years stoll it's like u know the script but u and the group u keep have basically kept me going on any given day and I kill for alot of series that you all do.
Know I'd love to one day dothe whokesystem thing to see wtg I've comments in the past how many years cause I always re-watch videos and think of them but like I'm probably down here from 2 years back waffling like always 😭😭😂 but 10/10 vid would recommend to myself again in two years when I lose most of my memories again until they're unlocked by the grace of the internet or music gods
The down side of a Tesla, is the car itself
60 quid for that little lung thing. That's a rip-off, should be £35
Nah I'm watching this after both Shannon and Mia left, and I genuinely believe it's Mike's fault
Is this a Tesla add at the end
After seeing this I'm surprised nobody saw the break ups happening.
" but i dont waaaaaaaana be a pirate "
Oi will, that ps5 James was on about in the latest 2nd channel video (the Facebook marketplace one)
I swear fosters isnt even Australian. Plus the old ads would say its their favorite beer yet they dont even drink it🤣
next time do this in nyc and yiur bank account will be 1000000000000000 in debt
The NDL hoodie 💪🏻
Shite car choice💩 The Hyundai and especially the pink🩷 Belle Delphine car were much better options🤦 And also Android🤖 is just superior to whack mac.
I have the lung thing chest infection goin in 2 days
yea you nonce scotland will beat england anyday (ik they shit)
"I'd rather go blind than use an android" I feel the same, except my feelings are about using anything that comes from apple's scummy hands
Who did he go on the English tea bus with
I'd rather go blind than use an android 😭😭
Honestly, the shirt is gas.
21:32 he ppeed 22:15
You know whats funny every British person does not like people from Australia and new Zealand 😂 and there so similar I think it's like China and Taiwan gov not civil
Bro casually purchase my entire salary
Why didnt you go to England Croatia game
love the NDL hoodie 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Australia also invented wifi
2:48 bro is saying that ios is better than android😹😹
This video was the beginning of the end of their relationships
14:26 bro be rizzing the girls
Hello ima ad everyone feel free to send me anything $Timmydrip21 😢🤣 I'll take any car as well 😭 cause dropping an tesla out the air is crazy I can't even afford to drop a penny or a piece of food 🤣sad but true
Why did he say “Hi yun die”😂
Will mate I remember watching you when you had almost no subs, gassed to see you doing so well. Always said you were underrated.
The sub button glowed rainbow
Scotland is the best country in the world
iphones are 🐕💩
What happened to the Igloo?
The shirt looks like the one that i where for school 😅
The Hyundai is better than a tesla
THE NOCKING 😦
i wonder why both chris and will are single now
Why does willNE walk like such a retard man. Pisses me right off the bat
18:30 Legit thought someone was knocking on my window!!! 😳🤣
criminal ending
Would have been funny with one of those plastic peanut butter containers that are historically easy to open. Everyone would be bamboozled
I'd unironically take a nice game of chess over an obnoxiously loud nightclub
bnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
i bet you spent more than half a millon lol
I have that shirt!!!  AND I GOT IT FOR FREE! I think my sisters wife got it discounted and didn't like it so she just gave it to me and I fucking ruined it... It's pink now because I accidentally mixed it with my colours... I could've sold that...
You went past the hotel I stay in when I go to London
why. why would you do this. i wanted to see boom.
"Now London as Im sure you now is renowned for two things, Stabbings and Traffic."  💀💀💀💀
Yeah, the Australian made thing is actually meant for Australia. We have so much shit outsourced that something being Aussie made is genuinely a selling point here
1:45 TURKEY MENTIONED 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺 WHAT THE FUCK IS AN ECONOMY
I just spent a good 20 minutes trying to figure out if I should answer the front door, the back door, there wall, perhaps the ceiling, or have an exorcism… 😂
Android user: ouch🙄
that shirt was horrendous
That knock gave me a heart attack
that door knock at 18 31 was so realsitic i even pulled my earphones off to go and check if there was anyone at m door
damn zapp took ages
How can you destroy that car it cost the majority of this video 💀💀
And they say girls are always drooling over girls it 100% goes both ways
lmao my mam has a hyundai ionic
Are you taking the mick................. I WANT TO SEE THE FIAT 500 SMASH INTO THE GROUND WILL!
As a turkey getir means bring and they are fast as f boiiiiii you can order whatever you want and in 5 mins ring ring a ring it's getir
As an Australian. No one, and I mean no one, ever drinks fosters beer. I’ve never even seen someone drink fosters beer. America fucking made that up and now the whole world thinks it’s gospel.
You didn't buy everything tho did you....we haven't had the video for it yet 😢
Bullshit vid, a Hyundai isn’t a Tesla.
In that case my brother is very blind
These guys are nuts .. glad i found the channel subbed brillant
the door knock is to real  W will
Will will key the poor bus if he ever sees it, dont blame him tho, looks disgusting the passionate hatred is inspirational
Interesting video but the fact that they said that Fosters Beer tastes like piss is nonsense as many people like it otherwise it wouldn't be made even I like it
I'm not sure why I'm picking out this one. But that Samsung QLED 8k HDR TV. Is not the same model And is from 3 years ago older model. And I'm sure it's class A+. That's why they selling four times cheaper.
18:30 People wearing headphones just shit themselves
welp! looks like Getir is certified fast and nice
I was gonna say, "a box of Stanley tools for 25 quid? Gotta be a scam"  And then you just got the actual box itself, and it all made sense.
Need to do a updated video of this Will and I am sure you have more wonga to splash 😉
This is so bamb it’s hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
I just watched a rich guy complain about eating on a public bus💀
The NDL merch🔥🔥
bro swar like hes triyging to get banned
22:07 Hey! Lots of people own Hyundais! Like my dad, who has...two kids and male pattern baldness. Oh, I see it now
Why is will always flicking off the camera 18:49
Never got to see the igloo
WAIT ndl niko defence legue?
I get this may be a year old but I just calculated he spent $44,000 in the video before he did this
thw main fact that buses in the uk drive somewhat recklessly, tea is no ideal
My buttons white, so good.
To be fair all those purchases can be listed as a business expanse and as such be tax deductable
Its not red, its black
the knock made me go to my door lol
0:32 Piccadilly
The bus rant was utter class
By reading we enrich the mind; by conversation we polish it
He's wearing NDL merch 😮
The ionic is a much better car will 😂
the knocking after you said ignoring the tax man at the door scared tf out of me because it sounded so realistic.
Australia invented Wifi ya cunt
anyone else noticed jin in the background on a hyundai ad? hahah.... I just wanted to comment something:)
the numberplate of the tesla is visible at 21:56. But idk what good that does anyone lol
Igloo…

Advertis of the private Jets and some real estate in Manhattan
The bus has a 2019 bus plate. It's not 20 years old
And WIll Is Probaly Still Waiting On zapp
2:47 FINALLY SOMEONE WHO REFUSES ANDROID
the horn is a totally different thing than the pws, the pws is the sounds electric cars make when driving slowly to alert people around. Its the feature that immitates the sounds emmited from normal car engines, because if it wouldn't be made on purpose, the car would be almost absolutely silent at low speeds, at least way to silent to notify it properly. But the horn is just the thing you press to make noise, totally different thing.
L we just finished that book
im from portugal and we won
fosters literally have on their can made in the UK literally no one here in Australia drinks it
You didnt buy locals in your area?
Imagine subbing to a squealing whining twat that squeals like a little girl. Must say at 14:09 that fella looks rather disappointed looking into his boxers (FUCK IT SHRUNK again)
I don’t care if this video is old I have the exact same chessboard as willNE

18:30 the knock sounded so realistic

Whoever sees this, put AirPods or earphones in and go to 18:30

Legends say its been a year but the tax man is still knocking
Hey will just a heads up but on rewatching at 21:56 you can see the full license plate
This channel is the funniest thing to come out of the North of the UK, p much ever, so I just had to subcribe on both my accounts because why not? Not only is Will funny as hell, no matter what he is saying/doing, but the accent just makes it even funnier... you sound like you're having a stroke when you speak half of the time :DDD
This got recommended to me and I love it
that knock on the was so real that i accualtly thought there was a knock at my wall by me nabouir

this is the most boring video ever. jeez
23:36 this is so funny
just letting you know that Australia invented half the shit you use everyday so
How about taking all that money that’s been wasted on complete garbage and spend it on food and clothes for the homeless or get new furniture for a residential home. How about staring something for the local kids to keep them from getting into trouble.
Number plate: LB69FKJ 😁.  (21:56)

AUSTRALIA INVENTED WIFI HOW DARE YOU ASK WHAT WEVE BROUGHT TO THE TABLE

It's a technology used by billions of devices around the world every day, and it all started right here, down-under.  the only good thing Australians have brought to the table

Cant wait until Will gets told he’s doing crack in a B&M when using that lung thing. Doesn’t half look dodgy..

As someone who works for a Hyundai dealership, Will is spot on about people who drive the Ionic.

alterantive title, " how to tell the taxman to fuck off when buying a tesla and don't want to pay tax"
I am on page 39 of Mice and men FFS
Wait 4000 for a tickets to see group stage match? That's like legal robbery. Honestly even 400 would have been expensive if you ask me

2:47 I'd rather sit next to Piers Morgan than use Apple so Samsung and Android for the win because they made hi-tec devices unlike the poncy imcompent Apple
Well, Australian's did invent wi-fi. Which is kinda important to being able to watch youtube videos.
19:10 this whole video i laughed so so so incredibly much… but this is just too true and so hilarious
just for confirmation us Australians do not drink fosters, its sh*t, even to us bogans
NDL NDL NDL

Now that’s a shit poster
I subscribed will don’t worry
Hyundai watching this like 😑
As he says heres the story of how it went,  Audemars piguet advert pops up 😂
wifi was invented by an australian, so you’d be stacking shelves in an aldi if aussies didn’t invent anything
Didn’t Australians invent wifi or something
box of tools lmao fitting though
Reason the TV was cheaper is because it is the entry level 8k qled from samsung 2020. Entry model, clearance due to prior year.
Im in ur 9, reading mice of men and its written on the front of my book

4:45 Will im Australian you twat

WILL!!!!! THAT KNOCK AT 18:30 is NOT i repeat NOT OKAY!!!!! MADE ME SHIT MYSELF WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR AND THERE WAS NO ONE THERE
18:31 the knocking sound scared me properly
Hey I remember not to long ago when you kept saying that you want to hit 2 mil subs on this channel for idk how many times, but it makes me really happy to see u almost at 5, quality content man thanks for never giving up
Aw come on don’t bully us Aussies, we gave you Wi-Fi
Australians invented wifi, sooo these videos might not have existed without us

Will loves a whitley bay reference

WillNE: "I'd rather go blind than use an android" that's it, I'm unsubscribing

I like the NDL merch 👍🏼

Just saying he will make an intro where he exits the tent I’m calling it.
Also props to Will for being secure in his relationship and giving tickets to his gf to see male strippers. Instead of being ultra protective and just selling the tickets or giving them away
damnit i’m reading of mice and men right now 😭😭
Also we love that will actually knows how to wrap a gift properly. And the Alexander McQueen shirt looks like the puffy shirt they made fun of on Seinfeld
Got more money than me Lots more
Love you will. I wish we were aloud mace here in Canada. We can't get nothing or carry anything without us likely getting a charge. In my city it's the highest crime severity index in the country, so if I get robbed or something I guess I'm just supposed to say can you please stop
19:19 ahahah that caught me off guard
Ain’t no one in Australia drink fosters 😂 XXXX gold, VB and Great Northern 💪💪 Oh and the BA XR6 TURBO

Every one of us aussies when he says fosters.  "WE DON'T DRINK FOSTERS!"
Im from Australia and the comment about what we bring to the table is correct and joe biden even forgot our prime ministers name lol
Will's business expenses sheet looking very strange this year
Are you top gear now? I like it that you're top gear now.
11:35 JIN!!??

Thanks will for ruining Mice and men for me :) :/
£36k... Tax deductible of course.
oiii don’t slate croydon 😂😭
My bird watches on here but she don’t have her own account on yt
Seeing the euros again is just depressing
Australia makes Rode microphones and audio equipment probably one the most important companies for Vloggers/Youtubers and Podcasters.
THAT ENDING NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
What about the Audermars Piguet?
Is this video just a big tax write off?
Mr Beast knockoff? I don't even like Mr Beast
What have Australians ever bought to the table you ask? How about wifi? You're welcome. I'll take my apology in writing thanks.
11:35 jin
Aussie here. Fosters does taste like piss... that's why we send it over there!
18:29  genuinely made me look back thinking there was someone knocking
Good video
I'm wearing headphones and that taxman knock scared me. I thought someone was knocking on my wall. Instead of checking I just rewinded to see if it was in the video and not irl. Jeez tho it sounded legit.
Australia gave you wifi and the selfie, also no one in Australia drinks fosters, u r correct it tastes like piss
Australia made google maps lmao
The videography skillz is just 😚👌
18:30 BRUH! That scared me so bad!
Ahhh I’m Glad Mo Won The Race

Getir based 1 block from my house
Took forever to make this next one haha
18:30 holy shit that actually surprised me. Thought someone was actually knocking on my window.

BLOCKHEAAAAAAAAAAAD!
Will is so rich use an 8k tv to put stickers on it for comedy
Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 is above Greece 🇬🇷 & below Costa Rica 🇨🇷. In the most recent fifa rankings (16th of September 2021). This video must’ve been taken you a while Will haha
tbf one of the best vids hes done
Cheers for completely spoiling of mice and men for me will, my English teacher is going to be so pleased

Noicceeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

Just me waiting for Will to change his car horn to the Ksi “ur getting raped today!”
:v)
I’m about to do gcse English :/
Oh so it was minutes to deliver the bread , not hours !!
Mice and men was a good book
Funny how you pronounce getir
Will you absolute bell end 19:00
the iglo??
"yeah that WillNE guy, he's a bit of a knob." *unsubscribes*    (this isn't realistic, and I'm still subbed)
18:30 FUCK OFF! I have surround sound bass headphones, that scared the shit outta me.
At least it is tax deductible (not sure about UK tax though I am American)
finally followed through with a 2 part video ehh ;)
Fuck sake Will spoiling of mice and men for me
Gonna get a massive tax return r kid
ah you bitch why you gotta end it like that
Will in the intro: "There are so many people that watch this channel every day"  Me: hmmm, the last time I checked...
4 on trending
I got a zapp advert watching this vid😂
He just wanted to deduct his tesla
nioooo why you smashing belle's car? that is a gold dime, some perverted guy would have paid big bucks for it..
19:05 WHATTTTT
why you gotta be mean to Big Grant Hanley he's a beast unneeded
My mom said you need to brush your teeth.
Will you may have forgotten the eyelashes, how could you
Nice skateboard collection will. Skateboarding video???
thought that dummy was a squid game costume for a second there
and I've literally just started gcse english
Sad that i’m not in London to find that phone >~< tis my dream phone

Will just someone else nazi saluting in the English anthem
I’ve never saw him outside before WOOEW
Neps ‘why are you there’ for the blind people lmao

Love that Will is a secure boyfriend that was happy for Mia to go!!
How is this man still only on 4 mil for his Stella content?!?!
suarez is a KING
9:32 he looks like he's just come back from tennis practice
Just by the way, us Australians actually never drink fosters. I don't know why it's such a massive thing for the rest of the world. I'm 25 and I have lived my whole life in Australia. I don't think I've ever actually seen a foster in real life before.
19:05 thanks will in doing this at school at just starting to enjoy it😂
Now we just need the follow up to the trade video.
Will where’s the trading video it’s been 10 months

Imagine having enough money to even buy one thing from an advert
Teslas aren’t 30k
Did anyone else check outside their door when he said about the taxman knocking on his door and the knocking sound effect played, because I did 😂😂
Shut it will Scotland could clap England any day of the week ya wank stain
It took me 3 days just to watch this whole video
I'm still waiting for the trade video 😂
Zapp is in shambles
"I'd rather go blind then use an android 🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓"
I was waiting for will to make a shameful plug into a sponsor
I love how childish he is
That poor lass at 19:34 looks horrified
How do you know what pee taste like?
I wondered why my mum had two black eyes when I woke up
Will needs to do a little series similar to the love island reaction but reacting to big Jezzas new garden transformation and get Stephen in. That would bang
By the fucking way nobody in Australia drinks fucking fosters
weres the igloo
Well up mate
Not me actually being excited to see the igloo but it never showed up 😭
Just to get the stuff tax free * I swear it was for the video
only if willne did a top gear camping trip

Great video
what’s the song at 15:36 ?
Will this vid was sick, just like…make more of them
Dang it! I want a Fiat!
will: what has Australia ever brought to the table. Australia: the internet
Fantastic marketing campaign for all brands involved… this is what influencer marketing is 😂
Defo battered Scotland
There were loads of tools in that box
Fuck you for that ending will
Bg media made you
Was anyone else expecting "move bitch, get out the way!"?
made in turkey getir .
Rather go blind then use an android 🙄 so you prefer the crapple pay wall, and zero customability, says a lot about wills iq
Why do you have to crap on companies you don't like, without even saying why you don't them
We aussies made wifi!! Ahhhhhh I’VE NEVER SEEN A FOSTERS BEER IN MY LIFE FFS 😂
aussies invented internet so basically we invented your whole career
When will said what did aus bring to the world I cracked up cause we invented bug spray and were one of the main inventors of internet
I can confidently say we Australians DO NOT drink fosters
you are a massive dickhead. i love it.
Who's Il ham I was thinking squid game
18:57 i did of mice and men in year 9 not gcse
"I'd rather go blind than use an Android" 😭😂🤣🙈
Whatever happened to the eboys channel I really liked it
its been ten years
4:44 will you do know Australians created wifi...right? like you would not have a career
Nice blurring the plate in the video mate, only thing is you left it visible in the thumbnail.
Bro when the toolbox opened i fucking lost it lmao
What about the igloo
So no headphone users are going to talk about the terrifying realistic door knock at 18:30?
Willnie Wust have you done 😂
Fosters beer isn't even served at most places in Australia anymore. Absolute piss that stuff. Get around a good old fashioned VB ! The Very Best
Hey bro, you’re videos are TOP TIER. However, just to let everyone know. Australians DO NOT drink Fosters. I’m baffled as to why everyone thinks we do, because we don’t. It’s horrid 😂
meanwhile bella dolphin watching the that she gave will
no credit to drew gooden i see. just getting worse every year
Jesus Christ love you
WEHRE IS THE IGLOO
I didn’t skip the ads bc I felt bad u spent so much money
that knock on the door made me go to my own door, the panning of that knock sounded so realistic, the detail of this man
Tommyinit inspired asking ppl to subscribe Lmaoo
4:45 What have we ever brought to the table? Use Wi-Fi much Will? Then there's the black box flight recorder, the inflatable slides on planes, the cochlea implant... Australians.
20:35 gold
FINALLY
The patrick schick joke was class
Will, lad, we don’t drink fosters
that knock at 18:30 really isnt a nice thing to hear at 1am
England still lost
Will nobody in Australia likes foster
With that tesla, you're laughing now
We created wifi Australia made your career 🖕
samantha all i can say that you were bought into this world because your mum desperately wanted a child and you should be very proud how very special you should feel i think its wonderful , and the relationship you have together is fabulous, and its makes you very very special .
NDL
As a german football fan.. it's clearly hard to watch.. 💔
I was waiting for the LED IGLOO ;-;
NDL hoodie for the win!!!!!
The taxman knocking on the door scared the shit out of me
No just no. Fosters beer is not Australia I live in Australia and I have never seen it before. It is non existent and I hadn’t heard of it until an American mentioned it. Made in Australia is on all products from Australia because when we shop it shows that it supports Australia and not foreign businesses.
Hello knobster
FUCK me that knock scared me
YOUR BACK
The ending is the biggest blue balls moment ever I swear
love will rantin was funny
As an Australian… nobody drinks fosters beer
Sorry if this offends anyone but I was so goddamn tired of those love Island videos

RIP belle delphine car
Wtf will I am reading of mice and men dude!!! I will not like and subscribe or watch the video to the end.(This is a joke BTW I love your videos

The austrailiens gave the british a massive prison to send all of their criminals, between  1787 and 1868
the tea bus is definitely meant for american tourists
You had to stop right there man

rip belle delphine car
Finally, (jk)
Fosters beer... is that really all you could think of?  Wi-Fi was invented by an Australian!
Luke was faster than the Zapp driver
watching people get excited over sports makes no sense to me at all i don’t understand the hype and i never will
Absolutely elite video but I feel bad for the drivers of London as they’re gonna have to put up with Wills majestic voice whilst driving through Watford
jesus christ that door knock was realistic
Uhh it seems u were taking many cautions during corona... uh yeah..
NOOOOOOOOOOOO THE BELLE DELPHINE CAR
Btw getir is bring it in Turkish
7 months ... it's not red anymore ... and the bell is on . . iygm
Will, people that watch this channel daily but aren't subscribed? Will, I would love to watch daily
11:27 Fun fact: Afternoon tea on a bus is bad since the 305 was withdrawn about 3 years ago. Go check it.

NDL!!!!!!
Genuiley the best video by will so far

I was watching this thinking I’ve already seen this but it came out yesterday? Shambles

I love how he literally used the wii boxing theme as his background music and still made it work
kool beanz

Great Tesla for a fuel crisis

Will mate. Letting your lass go to that stripper place sorry to say but your a SIMP!!!

SUAREZ was watching the BGM videos whilst on deliveries !

At least Will's got a NDL hoodie
When u where talking abt the e-boys what’s the song called plz
Will u should have put simon's, hi guys.... its me on ur horn
Hey we don't even drink Foster's in Australia. It's weaker than cats piss. I don't think I've ever seen anyone drink Foster's in the 40 years I've lived in Australia.
Will's spending 5K on an ad Also Will: spends 2.5K on Belle's Patreon
the euros footage im so sad
I am very distracted by whatever that red spots are on his hand .
12:12 boris johnson
finnaly ive beeen wating for this

Where is the igloo
Scrap the Tesla, buy the Hyundai

SHEESH NO.2 ON TRENDING
Pin thissssssssssss
Genuinley phenomenal video!
Where does this man get the money
SCOTLAND GOATS
As an Australian, Fosters beer isn't made or sold in Australia. Nobody drinks it. Only time i've had it was in the UK
Great another YouTuber buying a  white tesla model 3😑
Coppin dat NDL Merch
I honestly didn't think Will was such a basic person... Why get a Tesla? Like honestly it's an aweful choice of car that only gets sales because YouTubers and influencers think it's a good car.
Meanwhile, the stock of Flour Station sourdough bread 📈📈
banger
It was terrible the first time you did it
i cannot believe that mr willne just spoiled a piece of classic english literature for me im an absolutely fuming english major
I drive a Hyundai and have 2 kids I pray the patterned baldness doesn’t happen 😂
Letsss goooo #2 on trending?????!!
Imagine the last thing you hear was “Right, hello!!" before being hit at 100MPH
willne double apartment video

THAT DOOR KNOCK MADE ME GENUINELY THINK SOMEONE WAS AT THE DOOR lmao
This is pretty much, how much cool stuff I can buy and get a tax write off for
This is like top gear
So worth the wait like a modern day George R Martin
NDL GANG
love the niko defence league shirt. respect.
Ah dude did the igloo you were so hyped about not arrive
HOLY MOLY
androids are actually more powerful than apple and the operating system is extremally configurable
If it's for content, it's a tax write off 😉 Spent wisely.
i did undress it
What about the igloo
Joke review: Scrabble was the best one.
Lmao Got Covid Flu
the tesla part had top gear vibes not gonna lie
that door sound was too realistic
So F ing hilarious, that magic mike part had me in tears
4:48 AUSSIES DONT DRINK FOSTERS
I will not tolerate any Australian slander thank you very much
THE NDL HOODIE
WHEN MAN COPIES COLD ONES
That's got to be the exact shirt from Seinfeld 😅
This video was absolutely worth the wait. Would be happy to wait a year for the next one if it's this good
Welcome to the model 3 gang will😂
he tells me to press the red button but little does he know I am using dark mode! get fucked
Not me thinking the knocking on the door was my sibling snooping at what I was watching through the window
is this patrik schik?????????????
12:28:18
4:45, they brought us the big lez show 😂
My uncle is the owner of air physio and was the man who spoke in that educational video too lol

12:57 willne you look like a wax model version of yourself.. xD
Will is literally ready to get cucked for a video. GODDAMN this man is up to do literally anything for a vidya
Hello
you get a like just for the effort that went into this and a comment to please the youtube overlords
Blurred the plate, but the plates visible in the thumbnail 😅
36k is so much money but in a mr beast video he’s pissing it out
Finally Will! Been waiting
this was pure brilliance fella. staggered.
Best part of the video is the footy part , we were so happy then 😔😔😔😔😔😔
me and my hyundai will not be returning to this channel, thanks will
bro the galaxy s21 is better than most iphones so... 🧍🏻‍♀️
dude android isn't that bad-
NDL
Tax avoidance at the highest level
he's very clever, these are all income generating purchases since he's bought them for a video so he has paid a lot less than he normally would
We don’t even drink fosters beer here lol tooheys new or Victoria bitter lol
Like
I’ll swap a sticky rib pot noodle for your curtains 👍
This was alright
Just wanted an excuse to buy a Tesla
Finaly he's back.
Add Simon's 'hi again, it's me' as horn!
Mate not even Australians like fosters
Very tidy video mate
Is that the Seinfeld shirt?
"I'd rather go blind than use an Android" paid shill award goes to.
Was will doing the Hitler salute for the England national anthem .
The hatred for android is so odd, I really don't understand. Must be the status symbol of the apple logo
Your 100% laughing with your electric car right now 🤪🤪
Can’t believe I walked past him and Calfreezy at the AJ fight and I just kept staring at them as I walked past thinking they really look like WillNE and Calfreezy 🤦‍♂️
Finally 😀 keen to watch this
Finally something that isn’t love island 😂
Just spat my brew out at "I just look like I've come straight out of a carehome"
Top tier video
I think you may have bought the wrong size shirt William
im going to continue watching your channel                   without subscribing
LANDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Great video and all but big ups for the Lando Norris mini helmet when wrapping Jim's PS5!
It would definitely not take under 20 minutes where I live
Can tell you filmed this in the morning just after waking up 😂great video as always😂
pov: you were at the england game and saw WillNE and all the lads trying to hide at the tube station from everyone 😭
9:58 Mans used Lando’s mini helmet to hold the wrap 😂😂
i did the same! but i was using adblocker
Big up Theo walfflin boyz
nice hoodie btw
Finally the vids we need
Sue the afternoon tea tour bus I don't know if you could do it for a video that would be jokes
Who else though someone was knocking on your door at 18:24
Australians created wifi haha
That is the puffy shirt from Seinfeld.
At 18:29  I'll be honest and say that the knocking sound scared the shit out of me. I really thought someone was knocking on the wall in my room.
Why did the section with the car feel like a knock off top gear
Birth name definitely Suarez, actual tears
U killed the belle delphine  car rip
Ill tarde you a roll of toilet paper for the tesla
4:44 we invented wifi
Can’t believe you would slag off Australian inventions. We literally invented wifi mate
.
the bar he sets for videos are so high.
19:36
Why didn’t he buy the shirt for someone else?
I’m legit watching this only for the reason of adverts I have to take down for consumers in home ec    Very educational
This is low key giving me Jeremy Clarkson Top gear vibes.
WILL HAS A QUADRENT HELMET !!!!!!!!!!1
Doing GCSE English and having Will spoil the book when I’ve spent 8 Lessons analysing the context is just depressing
We don’t drink fosters, we give away our shittest beer
👏🏻FINALLY👏🏻 I’ve been waiting for this!!
Not the Lando Norris helmet being used as paper weight for the wrapping paper lmao
the afternoon tea on the bus segment has me crying laughing
Anyone gonna tell Will that that us aussies bought the world wifi, lawn mowers, the hills hoist and the bionic ear
Mate none of us Aussies drink Fosters beer
Yes
This he showed the wrong car at the end
The amount of money in advertising he should of gotten from this video is insane. SOOOO many brands mentioned
brooo that ending was some richard hammond's blast lab type scene omg
Why dyou have me grans curtains for pants Will?
Mate no one in Australia drinks fosters
okay i was in my dorm and that knocking sounded like someone banging on my wall every single time I played that part
Algotrithm
8:06 seems like Will took that rugby team challenge seriously. look at that boy's knee
Epik
Its funny because this video is stolen
Too easy
In b4 lucid becomes the best electric car company
Im more of an android guy
Bout time you rubix cube.
"what have Australians ever brought to the market", um... wifi
so you "drew" inspiration from gooden
Genuine goosebumps
Will out here milking this dead cow
The number plate is edited in the video but in the thumbnail it’s clear
Nah the ending tho, whyyy
Brooooooooooooooooooo
I’m still on pandemic brain mode and the soccer game footage gave me really bad anxiety lol.
Me who drives a Hyundai
Fuck you WillNE how dare you end this video on a cliff hanger AFTER WE'VE WAITED 3 FUCKING MONTHS
4:41 Australia doesn't make or sell Fosters beer (American marketing lie). They did however invent Wi-Fi
The lando Norris helmet sticky tape
I’m Australian and iv never seen fosters beer in my 28years of life. Great northern, XXXX , VB are the top 3 beers
You should run over that dummy you got and play the sound “RIGHT! Hello” so we can see what it’s like to be run over by WillNE
did anyone else notice harry’s ex girlfriend
time to wait another 3 months for the car smash video
This giving me some deja vu o_O
Who gives a shit....
GREAT VIDEO
"what has Australia ever done for us?"  just beer thats really it nothing more definitely not something huge like the....the internet...
I phones aren't better than anything give up
Will you just got a shit inhaler (I'm saying that as an asthmatic)
He disrespected the android users
I've been waiting for this vid
Will has overtook memeulous in subs, didn’t he used to have like 2 million less lol, well in lad
He frustrates me attacking Australians because of fosters beer, but I don't think I've even seen a fosters beer in Australia ( I know he was making a joke)
Literally isnt a single australian who drinks fosters hahahahaha
Every video we should get a segment on what Ciaràn is listening to
NO. NO. NO.
Fuck that knock I thought someone was knocking my door
"What have Australians brought to the table?" WiFi Will
Upload more please
Don't worry, Will, we don't drink Foster's. We just sell it to America
Finally
Your best video by far!!
Wow amazing blog
of mice and men was the only book i read for english and i was so hurt
No one likes foster's beer will. It's a disgrace to the Australian name.
Bet that Tesla is used or his friends cheap piece of c
Ain’t no one in Australia drink fosters 😂 XXXX gold, VB and Great Northern 💪💪 Oh and the BA XR6 TURBO
once a blue moon
Don’t fuck with Australia Will, we will get the spiders and snakes on u
this is literally the exact reason why youtubers are overpaid for the content they provide...
that knocking scared the crap out of me will.
Where the fuck is the igloo???
International Womaniser Theo Baker 😂
I want a tesla
Can drew and will collab??????
Finally !
You can't smash the belle delphine car!
Alex would like the shirt
Great vid bro
William my good friend I will trade a like for that Tesla what do you say
Absolutely incredible
why has wills vids got the same production quality as like a top gear video
This video definitely came down as business expense very smart man you are will
thanks for ending he video before that lovely car smashed into pieces! you truly saved it,thanks Will!
He didn’t show the iglo
First Cody reacts to George, now Will is pulling a Drew. My favorite US and UK lads!
Fuck off mate fosters is American
Australians don’t drink Fosters you wank Will
Algo
3months
Australia invented wifi
Cant believe it you 'forgot' to mention when callum McGregor  slammed one in for scotland  O flower of Scotland  when will we see your like again that fought and died for your wee bit hill and glen and stood against him AGAINST WHO proud Edwards army and sent him homeward to think again
21:32 did you pick up broken glass or something?
We accept the car swap but on one condition. You get it wrapped with the most like comment!!!
Im sorry to say but the euro's finished just a while ago
Really bad video, didn't even buy all of the ads u saw
Didn’t appreciate the euro part.  Ruined my day a bit
19:09 I don’t think I’ve ever heard anything more accurate
Omg finally yay
13:05 respect to the french lady she has my name lol (its pretty weird hearing my name in a yt vid)
Just thought I would let you know no one in Australia drinks fosters
Honestly completely forgot about this video.  Also, I will probably forget about the trading video very soon. William, do with that info what you will.
What’s that hoodie? I really like that!!
that knocking sound scared the shit out of me
Wtf happened to the igloo
imagine being blind, taking a leisurely stroll along the road and suddenly hearing "RIGHT, HELLO"
Not a big fan of that door knocking sound effect lol I thought the fbi had finally come to raid me
Wait Thomas Müller Made It INTO A WILLNE VIDEO 😧
Suarez 😂😂😂
I went too the Anthony Joshua fight at the weekend what a shit hole London is
That is mad disresepctful what youre doing to that car, i hope you checked it was okay with belle first
The Black Box is Aussie made and many other great inventions are Aussie
this is my new favourite Willne video
He doesn’t post much but when he does, it’s always entertaining.
Just putting it out there that England dropped points twice during the euros against Scotland and Italy. I think yous should be giving a bit more respect to the Scottish national team and Scottish football in general.
Ive being waiting for this part 2 for ever :)
Did he just say a Hyundai IONIQ is the same price as a Tesla Model 3???
what's blue and not very heavy? light blue     description
It’s a lung cleaner from Australia because of the bushfires which stuffed a lot of peoples lungs I was lucky and not a lot of smoke got into make lungs
That ciaran Spotify bit 🤣🤣🤣
The best video I have seen in a hot minute
The english tea bus? Is Britain even real at this point
what about the igloo???
Me, still waiting for the trading
Ok I waited the whole video to see you talk about my favorite line of cars. Hyundai ioniq. I have a plug in hybrid and it’s fucking not a knockoff. It’s a better Prius. Saying that was very offensive and I’m very offended. I expect to see an apology video in the next week   Btw I’m 19 and I don’t have children  And I also think Tesla’s are still amazing
Will tries to cover up his number plate but at 21:56 you can clearly see the whole plate as it’s not blurred then.
The spelling out “CUCK” in scrabble is underrated 😂
Will has midlife crisis over Tesla
worth the wait
5:29 your gonna suck off a whole rugby team wrf
That door knocking sound got me good
I was watching this with my mom who doesn't speak english, all she got from this video was the Magic Mike scene which led her to tell me the story of how she wanted to open a male strip club at our small town so...thanks Will :).
As soon as it is At this bit 4:07 I shit you not it started playing an add for me like the timing 🤣🤣
Tickets to the Euro's? How old is this
FUCK THAT KNOCK SOUND EFFECT I nearly shat myself thinking someone was wanting to get into my house
The amount of times will mentions the tax man is worrying should probably do a full check on this guys earnings
The amount of ads on this video I don’t even blame ya
Anyone else shit themselves at 18:30 when the knocking sound came through their headphones?
I completely forgot about this
Are you still doing the YouTuber trading thing?
When he said about the tax man knocking it generally sounded like a person nocking on my wall. Made me jump. Had to listen to it a few times to make sure it wasn't real
The fact that will gave me apple music
not gonna lie the England vs Germany game still hurts
What a time to own a electric car
What an amazing videos will
this is excellent
"whats australia ever brought to the table" JKVFWFRBGV YOUR PHONE MAN
Please bring back e-boys podcast
Shoulda done the ali g intro music ahahaha
Will don’t anger us Australians we made your wifi
Big up Croydon
here we go
WILL WHY DID YOU HAVE TO SPOIL OF MICE AND MEN!!!!!!!!!!
_Every day_ _Last upload, 2 weeks ago_ _Second to last upload, 2 months ago_ Hadaway lad Good video though!
👀
Mate if your gonna associate us with a beer, don’t put us side by side bloody fosters. No one here drinks fosters
Mikey needs a raise for this video
Getir gets bonus points cause the bag looks more durable and you can use it again
> I'd rather go blind than use an Android At least I don't get my images scanned Enjoy living in 1984 Mr Lenney, try not to wrongthink /hj
We cant watch it everyday when these uploads are more inconsistent than the gap between when Mr Beast records a gaming videon and when he posts is on the gaming channel
Will u prick scared the living day lives out of me with the knocking and me having earphones in ffs. 18:29
Willne….  Now there’s a name I haven’t heard in a very long time.
I feel like Will doesnt like us (Australians)
Where the igloo at?
I’m not a fan of Tesla’s and electric cars in general but I love those customisable horns 😂
11:34 what tf is Seokjin doing up there lmaooo
Class vid Will! Cant wait for the trade one to be out 😁
As an Australian, I can say no Aussie has ever drunken a Foster's. It's a conspiracy that the whole world put on Australia. Also you gotta thank us for your job, we invented WiFi
20:11 will looking like George Russell
I’ll take that shirt of you will 😁
SO you MAKE US WAIT LIKE 3 MONTHS AND DONT SHOW BELLE DELPHINE CAR GETTING SMASHED, i am very sad
Comment for algorithm so Will doesn't go bankrupt
This is the greatest bitch move of all time
18:30 if u had headphones in you'd look around thinking the knocking is real
19:02, FFS Will. We literally started reading that book in English.
Drew is really gooden
What about the igloo? That looked like the coolest thing
Will I knew about you dropping the car for months lol it’s in Norfolk right ?
amazing video
I watched the ads without skipping cause you need the ad cents!
I love this new huge trend of to make money on yt you gotta spend tons
Nope 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This video is fucking brilliant
"Rather go blind then use an android" i'm sorry but using an iphone means you are already blind xD my girlfriend just got a brand new iphone 12 pro and i swear to god it looks the same as an iphone 4 both on the outside and in the operating system xD apple are soooooooooo far behind the curve it's actually criminal.
George shooting Lenny was actually my favorite part of the book
The ending of this turned into wills version of top gear
Can we all appreciate that this guy came from dissing kids rapping about how they are going to do something to someones little sister.
This was the best video in September
Imagine Will spending all that money and getting this video demonitized 😭
As an Australian, I can gladly agree fosters beer does taste like piss, no one in Australia would be caught dead drinking it 😂
Well that's a cliff hanger
I will subscribe
No not the fiat no
you dickhead will, i thought i was about to get my head packed in  18:31
Will, I love your channel but what are those trousers lad, lmao
5:33 bit suss ngl
I just finished reading of mice and me today in class, this is scary! I have never heard anyone reference that book before and the will does it right after I finish it
Great Vid! If you're thinking about giving away the BJJ dummy I'll take it off your hands.
18:31 that knock fucked me up i really thought someone was banging on my window
When he played that Knocking effect I genuinely shit myself LMAO
I asked my mum, she said she’s had better.
This is probably the most effort will's put into a video.
Still sad about the euros
8:12 when you know he’s been watching too much love island
Oh the intro actually proves it. Neat
ah yes 2 10 second un skippable ads right at the end we love to see it
Where’s the igloo??? 🧊🧊🧊
The Tesla’s front boot isn’t aligned
Will I’m still waiting on the video of the bel delphine car lol can you DROP it yet ……..
That ad placement for the car on the crane at the end is criminal
Good video, see you all in a month
this video is just my mum 'nipping to the shop'
wills uploaded schedule is as bad as madeline mcanns kidnapper

very pog, nice to see you back
Barry fella put the keys down lad  😂😂😂
Took you long enough

Ok
Been waiting on this such a good video g
will is probably laughing at all the petrol buyers with his new electric car 😎
I love everything about your uploads now Will, all the editing and effort shows. Keep up the good work! ❤️
Suarez
The ending will I will come on
As an Australian, I am offended by being associated with Fosters. Literally never had one lol
Wait, where's the Igloo?
The fact that he said we’d score 6 past Scotland even when the last time we played them it was a 2-2 draw and they were lucky England didn’t lose
Will ruined my year 9 of mice and men 😂
the shirt isnt bad lol
No cause i actually looked around the room at 18:29 that was scary as hell
Can we appreciate that even though Ciarán isn’t working with Will any more he still helps commit with his content, well in Ciarán.
About time
PLEASE make more videos like this
SO HYPED FOR THE TRADE VIDEO OH MY GOD
My dad drives a Hyundai. Hes bald and has 3 kids so suck on that will you a kid short.
Never been blue balled harder in my life than at the end of this video 😂
That Of Mice and Men thing was so jarring cause I've just started the book. Sounds good. I'm shocked
Currently doing of mice and men in english thanks for ruining it 😥
I'm atually doing of mice and men in Eng literature... Will spoiled it :(
idk why the outro to this video got me kinda gassed
I’m reading of mice and men at school . We aren’t near that point ,we’re in the first 30 pages at most. Thanks
Great video lad excited to see where the trade video goes
Trade video tease. Guess we’re waiting another 10 months
worth the wait
aussies made wifi

Where was the igloo will.
WE DIDNT GET TO SEE THE IGLOO
Will going full top gear with the car
THE END NO
how are we all today
Because England lost hahaha yasss
finalllyyy
Is willne actually putting in budget to his vids now
Genuinely such a great video. Each and every bit was funnier than the last. I'd thought we'd hit our peak when you were on the tea bus, and it only went up from there. Keep it up, Mikey and Will!
Cold ones did it before you somehow lmfao
The of Mice and Men bit is so unnervingly accurate
14:13 ummm
The Fucking Knock at 18:30 shit me up
As a Scottish person, rewatching the scenes of Scotland losing (yet again) just dug the knife in further…
*finally!!*
Will are we just gonna act like belle delphine didnt give u a free car a few months ago 😂 Nvm just realised u gave it away 🤣
I’ve been waiting for this one turn it up
Imagine your about to get run over and you hear hey guys its me vikkstar123  Now you think for the rest of your life that Vick ran you over
Where’s the trading video at will
110 quid for scran on a bus yanno, London shouldn't exist
I shit you not we just started reading of mice and men in class.😂😂🤣🤣
18:30 I genuinely Shat myself through some pedo was at me window
Banger 🔥
Honestly, love the Tesla. Great options too.
Will is fit
Bet mia made him trash that car
I drive a Hyundai, this made me sad
Me: entering every code an hour late ( not receiving any ) will : no sympathy because why would he ?
That’s euros but was actually torture to watch
Nooo Im literally halfway through of mice and men and he ruined it!!!!
just 1 thing why
I started reading Of Mice and Men this year in school. I'm on chapter 2...... Biggest spoiler you could've given. Cheers lad.
Can we all agree that when he uploads our days get better! 💖
You can ask Jack for the Tesla tips
if this vid dose bad wills going to be very mad
you posting has made my day! consistency?
Of Mice and Men : George shoots WillNE
What a cinematic experience!!
How in the world did you get a Tesla for 30,000 gbp? They are so much more expensive in the states
Haha great video  20:13 had to pause the video to finish laughing  20:22 the what training dummy?!
Spread the gospel,Amen
Great vid
That shirt looks like my shirt for school lol 😂😂😂
Ruined the book will ffs
Fun fact, samsungs are better than iphones. Comment if agree, like if disagree
This trade video better be a feature length film
You were never gonna beat Scotland
Uses Lando Norris helmet for some reason
I wonder what wills CPM is? You don’t see many channels with 4.5 million subs making videos as expensive as these
Done
Is it just me who didn't notice he put on the expensive shirt?
Why would you say george shoots lenny I haven't read it yet
My school don’t do mice and men
I might cry he acc done it
As a Hyundai owner i found your description far too accurate
The bellemobile in free fall!
Great now we need to wait 8 months for a Love Island video and another 10 you the trade video
Will Aussies don’t drink fosters, it’s shit
Tbh i forgot about the first video
Of Mice and Men truly had a sad ending, I loved reading in class playing lenny but then I got shot. Sad times. Sad, sad times
Beautiful merch you were wearing in the start of the video where could I get that
1:01 we dont serve your kind around here
I'm Scottish, Will
78k in an hour on the main? Will your on the ropes m8
I actually need that toolbox tbh @willne can I have it
I don't like soccer (sorry, football) all that much, but I'd like to go to a game in England now, y'all are so enthusiastic I don't think I could sound more American there if I tried but it's okay
11:34 JIN
Wow, I did not expect to ever see this video 🤣
What’s wrong with ur knee
The legend is BACK
yoooo wheres your igloo thingy IT HAS LEDS WILL LEDS

Lb69 fkj

“Get a job fella”
RIP the bank

Hello Wlliam Lenney i am ,at this point in time, infact doing GCSE english. you have just ruined mice and men for me and made me very sad. you bastard.
About time Jesus Christ
Scotland!
Cold ones
Guess this petrol shortage isn’t affecting Will then
Ehhh was looking forward to the ionic 😂
Maybe there is hope for the trading video after all
A fuck tone of work went into this fair play fella
That is 1 fake Samsung 😂😂😂
bruh im reading mice and men right now and it is write on the front page lmao
Banging joke 0:30
damn will really became jeremy clarkson for this video
Longest 3 months of my life. 🙄😂.  Finally.
Is the air physio just like an incentive spirometer? Those are fantastic for preventing pneumonia in hospital  EDIT: it seems to be an OPEP which is oscillating positive expiratory pressure device and they do help clear mucus.
About time🤷‍♂️🤣
he should've changed the horn to dejis intro
WiLLNE BAYBE.
Using Landos helmet as a weight haha
WillNE needs to be on TopGear just because of that vlog on the car 🤣
Drew gooden
Put some respect on Android's name Will
is this willne or mr beast?  smashed it
The story telling and editing in this video was elite. Also.. we need to talk about that trade video teaser at the end 👀
He just shit housed it and bought a load of shit he wanted instead .....
Lmao u actually spoiled it for me
12:57 WillNE has morphed into Amelia from the Chicken Shop
I want a sugardaddy friend like Will
Welcome back Will, though covid had go ya and you died
THE FUCKING KNOCK HOLY SHIT WHY WILLLLLL
NDL less goooo
When he was in the car talking like he’s in top gear
tesla :( ugly cars
Is this really WillNE doing a part 2 of something
omg stop sticking up ur finger u look like an 8 year old...
That horn is elite my friend
Legendary
69K POHG
Wait a minute didn't cold ones just do..
Man like Patrick Schick is back
i thought someone was at my fucking door at 18:31 you scary bastard
Big up Suarez
Blurs the number plate in the video but leaves it open in the thumbnail
way too optimistic with the phone
Will what happened to your hand (Tesla clip)
You probably won't see or answer this but when were you in London? I was there in August and noticed the English tea bus, would have been hilarious if you happened to be on there xD
BRO HE SPOILED OF MICE AND MEN
That bus is a Enviro 400 it was probs made around 2006/8 so no it's not 20 years old
Kinda miss the point if you just buy diffrent stuff
i did omam in year 9 and by the end of the first week on it, barely past chapter 1 everybody knew the ending. But tbf it was obvious what was gonna happen as you got more towards the end.
Finally will!!!
“So basically now, I could suck off a whole rugby team and I wouldn’t even have to stop for breath”
Imagine being ran over by Will hearing "Hey guys, it's me, Vikkstarr123"
21:38 you hear that tax man “the WillNE channel tesla” well played son
What about the 8 grand igloo??
Fuck you will  24:23
Will you had to spoil that for me. Smh. Was just starting Of Mice and Men in English Class.
banger video jesus christ the story telling and overall video ELITE
Suarez is elite ngl
WillNe for top gear pls
“Literally as we speak, he’s listening to “give me more” by Britney Spears” God, Ciarán is such an icon.
That knocking on the door noise at 18:29 with headphones freaked me the fuck out.
Am so hyped for this video man!
Finally
Hi
the fact that this man doesn’t have his own spotify account😭
Bet he's glad he bought an electric car rn
I knew he knocked it off of drew
Edit was on this was class
Gcse fucking hell I got to do it now in year nine it’s the most dead book ever
finally
People aren't subscribed cause you upload 2 times a month if we're lucky 😂
Finally
This video is fucking elite genuinely
Chess and scramble > night out, all day
Wow. This only took 3 months. WillNe is getting consistent
"fucking lungs of iron man" IM SCREMAISNSHDND LMAO
2:47 BASED BASED BASED
I waited so long for thos
698 comments
just a tad late, but who cares its here now
RIP the Eboys...  Also when are you doing the trading video!?!?
AYO, did that knock at 18:32 shake anyone else up?!😨 (earphone users)
FORZA ITALIA🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🎈
bouT TIME
I drive that exact hyundai and have a healthier hairline than you Will, piss off
Finally jeez
This video has the quality of a Mr beast video, genuinely impressive. A*** content!!
11:34 just jin casually sitting there
Didn't get pinged about this
You can tell how long they've worked on this when you see Will's old bedroom
These adverts got more exposure than they ever could have imagined.
im getting this weird feeling of déjà vu clicking on this
I knew the horn would be ‘right hello’ before he said
Does the tesla have the pws thing or was that the speaker aswell
Cool how the video is 24 minutes long and it’s a 24 hour challenge
I have to say that this was a really great video. I had several moments where I laughed out loud, which is not a common thing for me. Let's hope it brings in some of the money invested in it.  And finally: I thought that the trade video idea was to trade videos. Dropping the Belle Delphine car from a great height seems like a strange trade...
I'm literally doing GCSE of mice and men hwk rn. Thanks for the spoiler ig
was anyone else wearing earphones then that knock on the door happened, shat my self.
so this si why s2w died
Well, Considering you are broke now we can expect a influx of react videos init a big W for us
Will spoilt Mice and amen for me, doing it at school.
love the lando helmet as a paper weight ... class
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MESSING WITH THIS IS HESKEY KID HES THE BEST THERE IS
ITS HERE
Teslas not a car, it's more like an electric lawnmower that can't cut grass.
Screw you Mr Lenney. We're literally reading of mice and men rn in school. 😐
18:30 i thought someone was actually knocking on my door XD
Where the fuck did Will get the budget for this shit
Get it to say ayup and welcome to Callum’s corner
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MY CAR
Don’t mind me just crying with laughter  Edit: I am also Scottish and I have never been so offended by something I 100% agree with
LET US SEE THE SMASH OF THE CAR AT THE END
I have actually been so excited 4 this vid nglll
The delivery guy recognized him💀💀💀
all those year 7s
That tesla review almost giving me top gear vibes
18:31 I lost it
So happy to see the outcome of this at last
Luckily I finished “Of mice and men” literally yesterday. Phew
You can tell  you put so much effort in your  videos, so entertaining love it will☺️
Niko would be proud of u wearing ndl hoodie
nice hoodie you are wearing
5:28 no need to thank me, ronnie coleman beast
Will that fucking knock , very cross
Will are you okay? Give us a sign if ur in trouble
been half a year but still happy to see it
11:34 did yall see Jin lmaoo 😩
since when did Will become a presenter on Top Gear?
Worth waiting for, hope the trade video is just as good 😂
talk about a fucking cliff hanger
The effort that goes into making each ‘Right, hello!’ bigger than the one before is elite.
There was an Audimars Piquet ad. Where’s the £50,000+ watch
Nice but you still bought the wrong car 💖
Stabbings n traffic lmao
Mate check your thumbnail
I’m the guy in the yellow jacket at the Scotland game ahhh
NDL!!
aw man I miss Will's old room
This was fun and all but really? People are just gonna watch someone piss away £36000? Like yeah it's funny because that's more than most people make in a year.
imagine "RIGHT HELLO" repeatedly down the line on the M1
love a little ciarán cameo
20:17 i thought it was from squid game
worth the wait every single time
How the other half live here’s me watching this I’ve not eaten in 6 days
Holy shit
4:41  Aaron mooy watching this video:🥺😢
The saddest part of a Willne video is that the next video is going to be in a months time
I'll take the galaxy s21 if you don't want it
19:03 WTF WILL...I’m one of those people
No joke where willne said about of mice and men I'm reading it in engelish thanks for ruining it 😂😂
Big up suarez
Why are all of wills videos flipped
You dodged a bullet getting a Tesla instead of the Hyundai
I was a child when part 1 came out, i'm now an adult, good schedule will :)
20:35 shoulda just asked ur mum 😂😂
Was literally going to read of mice and men in a week.
Petition for Will to present Top Gear
My friend ask mid-video "I wonder what happened to the Belle-delphine car" I replied "It Died",  y'know, as a joke... I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO DIE
I’ve just turned 72. When the first part came out I was 14. Been so long
Love the storytelling here mate
Great video but why do your trousers look like my nans caravan sofa 21:9
18:30 I got scared as hell when I heard that, especially since i was alone 😭
I literally forgot about this video 😂
Where did you get that lung thing from again? 😏
Ŵîłłš thè ßęśt
Willines gone broke  Mr beast I can help
When the car dropped as soon as it was about to hit the ground I got a dominos ad. Cheers will
Tesla's are shit
No not the Belle Delphine car!
every time will wants a new car he makes these videos 😂
What happened to your hand Will? 21:23
The door knocking sound made me karate chop my wall ffs
Nearly shed a tear during the Euros section 🥲
Lol will just spoiled mice of men for me in English thx will im only half way through😂
Can’t believe I actually tried the Apple Music code thing…told me I had to be in the uk to redeem it 😔. I’m also too broke for Spotify etc ✋😔
very extremely cool video man
AAAAAAA the trade video is back on!!! 🎊👏🏼
My family kept walking in whilst the Magic Mike part was happening ffs
who else looked around as if someone was there at 18:30
cheers for the premium lad
Took a while lol
Will lol thanks for the mice and men spoiler jeez I litteraly just started GCSE English lol.
The groceries adverts must not go down too well with Gorillas after the brand deal
i thought someone was actually knocking on my door at 18:30
would be kinda weird if there was an adoption add
the bus in the video is 12 years old (the one thats going to west Croydon)
Guess who’s back back again
11:34 catch seokjin on the billboard
RIP Chris
Poor will's pocket
It’s sad seeing him spend 30000  and I can’t even get Fifa 22 😭
Cheers for telling me what happens in of mice and men cause I can now spoil what happens to my class
That poster cost £50?!?!? This is why you’re losing money mate, I’d have done it for £49.99
What all is doing with 4 million subs is phenomenal
oh no the belle delphine car
Can we just take a moment of silence to appreciate how amazing the editing in this is LOOOOOL
Here's a comment
Will and James watch idea- That'll teach em
will not tolerate this Android slander, unsubbed. oh, it's a Samsung, resubbed.
Honestly recon the BBC should get will in as a presenter for top gear
Every
RIP wills bank account
You can't end a video like that Will.
the ndl merch tho 🔥🔥
Who ever copped those Apple Music gift codes are lucky af
Good thing you got the hundred quid skinny pills to counter all those fast food things XD

Bigger cliffhanger than infinity war
Mate I'm about to read mice of men next week lol
that knock at 18:34 genuinly made me jump
THAT ending omg
THAT ENDING
next video from wil is just going to be IM BrOkE
The story telling and editing in this video was elite. Also.. we need to talk about that trade video teaser at the end 👀
How you gonna end the vid like that
unsubscribing as we speak due to Grant Hanley slander... unacceptable Will
Will lad it’s been ten months where’s the trade video
I wish i was in that pink car smh
hi
Yo WTF?? I’m doing of mice and men in school rn. Way to ruin it
JIN 💜💜💜
return of the king

I WILL HEAR NO GRANT HANLEY SLANDER
The ending has made me sad
Thanks will, I am currently on page 35 of “of mice and men”      Can’t wait to see what happens at the end

Wow
Bet Will's loving the electric car at the moment
THANK YOU FOR THE FREE MUSIC WILL I WAS ABLE TO GET A CODE XX
U legend! What a video this was!
The ending 😩
That show just looked like a gay amateur bodybuilding show. They were wearing posing thongs and all
I think the biggest surprise is that the delivery guy knew Will.
Ngl wills laughing with tat Tesla cos of the petrol shortage
Willne give an android phone because Androids have features which are very old and those old features are adapted by iPhones only now.
That's just sly
i want my car to scream vikstars intro at padestrians 😔
I’m earlier than…. -insert witty joke here-
big up suarez
if i had a penny for every time mice and men was spoilt by a youtuber, i'd have two pennies, which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice
Will: shows England  Me: I’m depressed now
Again really
I'm unsubcribing you spoiled of mice and men I'm reading that in y9
thanks for the £100 apple credit  <3
4:44 they'd agree with you
The door knocks scared at the shit out of me at 4am
As a German seeing this again fucking hurts
"Congratulations to everyone who comes every second" ❤️
Fun fact: these videos  1 makes our days better

Will is a YouTube genius. So happy to see new video that is not bloody love island 😂😂
When Will put on the shirt, he looked like a kid who forgot his PE shirt, but remembered his shorts, and now the Teacher is making him do PE in that
Whenever he uploads I drop EVERYTHING and watch immediately
YESS THE KING IS BACK
an actual pt 2, i didnt think it was gonna happen.
Finally Will, was losing my patience
Ngl Will is honestly the only youtuber I regularly watch
Will when he has to spend 35k: 👁👄👁  Also will when he realised he can right it off:😩
11:34 JIN
