And now it's looking very similar
This was the best colts game in a long time.
The beginning of the end for Mac Jones in NE
Can't believe this game is almost already 3 years old I remember watching this as a patriots fan I was sad when JT got the huge play during the end.
13:15 that one patriots fan in a sea of colts fans
As a patriots fan I hate JT
Let go colts
Colts 27 vs patros 14 Final
One of the most shocking losses by the patriots in 2021
revenge!
26-3
was at this game, the atmosphere was crazy
Colts snap the streak
I like how as soon as Jonathan Taylor broke free the announcer said TAYLORS GONNA FINISH IT
That stadium was rocking that night!
Jonathan Taylor 29 attempts 170 rushing yards 1 rushing touchdown 23.0 Fantasy Points!
This was the loudest sporting event I’ve ever attended
Mac jones was throwing dimes on the last scoring drive
How many of you know these facts about the NFL? https://youtu.be/ZrHs-CML4KM
Makes me sad Wentz isn't a consistent QB. HE could be great, he just isn't
Best game I’ve ever been too
The running lanes in this game are just beautifully created by the colts offensive line! ❄️💥👌🏾💯
Even without Brady the Patriots never get called for holding. It's pathetic really.
That last scoring drive Mac Jones was outstanding

The first Patriots-Colts matchup without Peyton Manning AND Tom Brady.
Very enjoyable game.
Great TD run by Taylor at the end to seal the deal. No comeback this time for the NE Pats lol 😂!
Week 18 where is the colts now 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
people say that carson wentz got mad at someone on the other team .i didn't see anything
4:05 Realize Jones didn't have his best game but how does he throw this pass? It seems to be a relatively good spiral but then drops about five feet from its trajectory as it nears the receiver. Like a pitcher throwing a curveball that drops about two feet as the batter swings.
Jonathan Taylor doing everything—runs middle, runs wide, catches, blocks and seals the edge, even pushes Wentz on the sneaks lol this dude is a one man army
Hahaha !!!!!! No comeback this time patriots lol
It is always Very satisfying watching the pat punks getting beat.
New England is nothing with out Brady!  They need a new Quarterback… so many turnovers in one game… bad throws and bad decisions!
After watching my Bills drop kick the Patriots out of the 1-spot in AFC east, I had to come here and check out the Colts sh*tting on them the week before!
Carson Wentz is low key good
Classic smashmouth football, soon to be extinct.
How the. F pat’s lost 😡🤬
While the colts were doing insane, you have to admit tho it’s pretty impressive how the patriots and Jones nearly made a come back.
10:16 😧
8:21
The Colts are a tough team.  They will be a handful in the playoffs.
Belichick played scared. Should have gone for the TD on 4th down instead of living the field goal. Would have then eventually put the Patriots up by a point and Wentz would have thrown another interception 😆
I don't trust Wentz to be consistent enough for a season.
2:05 😲 go  colts
Go Colts🏈✌
1:15 watch the great block by colt's Taylor which makes colt's runner Hines td a sure thing. Now, it was a couple yards from the goal line and one Patriot potential tackler in front of him . but in today's type of nfl, with all its rules against hard tackles, especially with head , i think he would have made the td anyway .  defensive players are very hesitant , and sadly have to do more arm tackling which isn't as effective as using your whole body force .  just an opinion on my part
Looks like Patriots defense was confused on that 60 bomb by Taylor
From Seattle: Awesome performance and gameplay, Indianapolis Colts.  Please, please, make it to the playoffs this year.  Your team is scary.  Impressive D and offensive, especially with the run game.
13:52 That't the Ken Stabler play  Stabler said about The Holyroller  "The ball wasn't doing me any good so I just let it go"  lol
Damn imagine if the Patriots were good for more than 1 quarter this week
Wentz needs another target
PAIN
Colts Nation!!!! 💪🏾
Huh. Guess the Patriots weren’t as invincible as everyone was saying. Hehehehhehe.
I had to really check out highlights colts stomp tha patriots go indy
Excellent Indi , Unitus would proudly weep
The chiefs could lose 2 of their next 3 if not all 3
That stiff arm after the pick was the highlight of my night☠️😁
Patriots badly need an elite wr
New england QB is so dissappointing
Had to turn the video off as I was nauseated by the repetitive State Farm Auto Insurance commercials.  They are on constantly on multiple forms of media.  There is no question that these repetitious, annoying ads cost a ton of money to broadcast.  That cost is passed along to the consumer.
2:06 GOOD JOB Colts
Jt for mvp
On to Cincinnati
Number 10 patriots (FUCKEN DUMB)
Pats D was playing on 87 octane while their O was on 91
Go the Colts!!!! Really good to see Carson playing well.
the runningback of cowboys is unstoppable!
I am a WI badgers fan, it is amazing to see what Taylors doing in the NFL
Defence and running wins championships js
That interception by the Colts 58 was one of the best defensive plays this year. Amazing!
we just gotta work on our 4th quarter defense on godddd
is this the year???
Thumbnail pretty much sums up the game
Great game. Only thing. Wentz played an entire four quarters under a helmet not wearing a mask. Stop putting it on while helmet is off. Just as foolish as putting it back on after each bite of food. Just stop.
The clock only has a minute left. Who will get last touchdown!
Patriots caught it, this time! We are sure!
Watch out, Colts! Patriots headed to the touchdown!!
The heat is turned up. Who got the ball!
Yes! Patriots, finally got a touchdown.
It's caught, again, Patriots. You need a touchdown.
Perfect , throw and catch Patriots. The Colts still has the lead.
The Colt kicked ball, almost made it out of bounds.
I think this is the best comments thread I have ever read! It's great seeing respectful comments between Colts and Patriots fans. If it hadn't been for family being in town on game day, my wife and I would have been at Lucas Oil screaming and cheering with all the other Colts fans! And, as a Colts fan, I'd like to give kudos to Bill Belichick for mentioning Ryan Kelly's family's loss at the start of his press conference. Very classy, Bill!
The Patriots shouldn't give up, yet! The game isn't over!
Outta bounds , Patriots.
The Patriots, Defense got him down!
Whoo,! Myers,  almost caught the ball! 👏👏👏🥳
Hmm. He is pushing his way through . 👏👏👏👏🥳
Colts are a really good team lol
Colts have std
Colts like the care bears
Colts really aren’t a good team
Colts are terrible
Their were a lot of commercials in this video.
The saints beat Tempe bay too.
Jeez Wentz looks pretty shabby . What was Philly thinking .
God damn the Colts D is hitting hard this year
Mac needs to increase his arm strength
So, where were all those "experts" and "pundits" who said Patriots were going to steamroll Colts? Obviously they're nowhere to be seen........ they couldn't see the point of thinking the Colts could win Just out of interest, does anyone know what the spread was before kick off?
Why is every ad Patrick mahomes
STOP SHOWING THE OUTCOME OF THE GAME IN THE THUMBNAIL!
TAYLOR MADE! KID’S GOOD! 😵🔥😵
This week's episode of Hard Knocks is gonna be great!
Not a fan of the Patriots, but even though they lost I think they can win the SB.
This game should of been on CBS.
Damn, I have to admit it, the colts had a really good O-line. The best I ever. I'm so sad about my Pats. Anyway, Isaiah Wynn bad play coast us the victory. The playoff will be great. Hope that the Chiefs lost their next games 🙏🙏🙏
The thumbnail explains this game as a whole. Colts were physical out there
Thumbnail nasty😬
I'm rooting for the Colts, and I think Jonathan Taylor is amazing, but I tell you ... The Patriots have have found their successor to Tom Brady, and the Buffalo Bills have some work to do if they're going to be perennial contenders in the AFC East. If you like NFL football, you have to love Mac Jones and JT. Long may they play.
Patriots fans says mac jones is a god  Prolly a cheater again ngl
remember when the pats were almost unbeatable? but then paton retired.
ima chargers fan and oh boi i dont want to see the colt in the playoff i don wanna see him rush for 200yards on us J.taylor
Mannn when the colts actually click together in a drive; it’s hard to stop them. That o-line is special btw.
And They said Mac Jones couldn’t trow 🤦🏻‍♂️
The thumbnail pretty much sums up how exactly how the game went
Great block by TE #83 Kylen Granson to spring Taylor for his 67 yard game winner. Kudos!
Colts center Ryan Kelly missed the game against the Patriots after the death of his daughter Mary Kate. My deepest condolences to him and his family
Call 3yy&yu Yes
We started off rough , but we are going to AFC championship
Next time they play pats will win lol
what a stupid call qb draw/sneak what ever you wanna call that on 3rd and long..genius just absolute genius maybe if murray or hurtz was the qb it could work, but wentz ? cmon man what are you thinkin ?
Now these were the Colts I thought they'd be with Wentz this year.
Mac jones didn’t look like a rookie in the 4 th quarter, this kid is legit
Darius Leonard. Defensive player of the year.
Letss gooo Colts everybody slept on Us Now its time to prove what this team is really made of!💯  Couldnt be more happy to be a die hard colts fan #COTLSNATION
colts really surprised me even after both teams had the bye the week before
We needed that humble pie...
People be sleeping on the Colts they is a very good team don't let they record foul you
JT for MVP! 🙌🏆
👍🏈🇺🇲
In Madden there should be a 99 ovr card of Jonathan Taylor
someone gotta clock his 40 time on that long td
They need to give the o line for the colts some props. They were the force of this game they played well.
#42 can hit!
Very Thankful to the Colts. I bet 4 Co-Workers 100  Dollar Canadian Each and Also I won the Football Pool twice 1 was 120 Dollar and the other is 155 Dollar. a Total of 675 Dollar. Everyone Took the Patriot Expect me. My Supervisor was checking my Paper He is like You the only guy who Picked the Colts And be was Laughing So I told him If you want make a Bet and he Refuse he backed down.  So I told him Colts will win. I score 30-23 for 53 Total Point and I was Close. I'm so so Good.
13:15 that one patriots fan full of colts fans 🤣
Colts ran the damn ball 🏈
And stay out of Indy!!!! GO COLTS!!!
8:24 yep, thats the reason NFL player  die with  chronic traumatic encephalopathy
You love to see it
As a eagles fan who isnt a hater. You just love to see wentz ball out. Kid deserves respect
the ads! bruh fu
JT = MVP!!! GO COLTS!!! 👍👍👍👍
Can we talk about Leonards stiff arm after the INT? jeeeez
We need to take shots to harry more often we are kinda wasting his talents in my opinion
I'm a New England fan, but tons of respect to the Colts. Got the talent they needed. Taylor is a beast. There's no question about that. Even through this loss, though, Jones still looked impressive. I hope to see both of these teams in the playoffs. Congrats Colts
Reputation, history and consistency that #colts didn’t care! #underdogs!
i feel like they need to feed nkeal the ball mor and use him properly, that deep ball catch was beautiful
Fischer took Barmore COMPLETELY outta the play on the JT TD
Colts 3-0 against rookie qbs this season
As bad as the patriots played they came back and put themselves in a position to win at the very end. I am just glad the team did not quit. They fought until the end. Every team is going to a bad game here and there. Weird week of football for a lot of good teams.
Patriots got punked.
Both of those interceptions by Jones were completely on him. First pick was a complete bait. Allow Henry to appear open for a split second and let Leonard peak his head in for an easy pick inside the red zone. Huge mistake. 2nd. When you constantly attack with the out route like the Patriots had been showing all day at that point. You’re setting yourself up for them to jump the route. Gotta keep them guessing which at that point in the game, he did not.
The Patriots are in the middle of a five year rebuild... 2020 - sub .500 and hopefully get draft a QB for the future 2021 - finish over .500 and hopefully compete for a wild-card spot 2022 - get in the playoffs and maybe even compete for a division title 2023 - Finally end the reign of the Bills and win the division title and be a contender for the conference 2024 - Become a Super Bowl contender and a Top 5 team in the NFL ...this was a tough loss...but overall, I'd say they're doing just fine.  I don't think their season is over like everyone seems to be saying.
If it weren't for Jonathan Taylor, there was a chance the Patriots could have come back and won the game. Yikes.
Looks like the rivalry is back. Love to see it. Feels like the good ole days lol.
The afc really is strong this year. Any of the current playoff teams can beat each other on a given sunday.
Mac looks like a sore loser like Brady
oh, God, my Colts has a DEFENCE!!!! Taylor is unstoppable machine!!!
Shows u anyone any team can get beat any day no matter how good u are how bad u are. Gb was 15-1 and lost there first game of playoff game
New England made too many mistakes in the first half. Almost came back
Colts offensive linemen are slow ass hell but they be moving the earth in them trenches
Great job colts! Good running by Taylor! Wentz watch the greedy throws take the check downs. And number 42 on our defense is the hardest hitter since Bob Sanders!
So happy the rams played the colts early, they are legit colts vs chiefs in the afc championship for sure
Did Mac really just try in push the pile with about 11:30 left in the 4 th lol
The Colts are 4 real. They are good in all 3 phases of game. Ride Taylor into playoffs.
Hope the Colts all get flesh eating disease of the crotch.
Jones is good
Patriots are good this year
What sucks is I think Derrick Henry is an amazing player and amazing overall human being but Titans fans are so damn unbearably obnoxious that it makes it hard to root for him. They literally come into every single highlight video to talk about how Henry is more superior over Taylor. It’s annoying. Get a life you hicks!
Was at this game. Patriots just started out so flat and had to play from behind all game. Then the penalty’s. Offsides on 3rd and 1 from the 1 yd line! A couple others. Bad coaching, bad week of practice, bad everything. Still don’t understand the reason to kick that fg on 4th down right outside end zone to make it 20-10… Colts fans all acted like it was the the rising of Christ. Not many times you see them beat the Patriots so I don’t blame them. It’s a Christmas miracle. Enjoy ur 6 seed losers…
Tv analyst, podcast host, radio show host, twitter, sky writer, all extremely quiet on Mac or the literal 2nd coming of Jesus Christ now. Shoved this guys name down everyone throat for the last 2 months and now? Crickets….
I missed the game, but from these highlights, I see 4 plays that really were the difference makers in my pats winning, the two picks, the penalty in the red zone that pulled us back from the goal line and the blocked punt td. All i can say is good job colts ya got us on this one, and also good job pats, for fighting all the way to the end, and never giving up
Colts fans best hope Taylor stays healthy; Wentz was hot garbage in this game.
Wentz hella scared
Best team in the nfc right now is the packers and best team in afc right now is the colts
What a boring game 😂🤣😂 yawns 🥱 just waiting on the kingdoms return let’s go chiefs 🔥🔥🔥🔥🤘🏿
Mac jones is the new Brady
The Patriots QB completed 26 out of 45 passes (57%) for 299 yards. The Colts QB only completed 5 out of 12 passes (41%) for 57 yards THE ENTIRE GAME and they still won. This is why win/loss records next to quarterbacks' names are useless stats.
Excited to see how far these teams will get next year...!
Thumbnail for this is straight disrespectful
13:01 That cut by Taylor tho 👀👀
Love the Game!! Calling all owners&players in the NFL,NHL,NBA&MLB to donate 20%&10% respectively this financially tough holiday season 4 food security, kids toys,sweets,books& hygienik products. Will lovingly volunteer brain&muscle 2 deliver the goods throughout North America days before X-Mas.
Anyone else see TimThetatman at 13:16 ????😭😭😭
It was some big hits this game
the patriots defense looked tired...painful to watch..time to watch those Dolphins..apparently they won !!!!
After reading these Comments did everyone jump on the Colts bandwagon after the game? Because some just seem like their only becoming Colts fans because it took them 12 years to beat them.
MVP! MVP! Jonathan Taylor more deserving than any QBs right now.
Aren’t the refs and announcers supposed to be unbiased? To me it seemed like their were flag after flag thrown against NE all game it’s like they coughed the refs pushed back NE 10 yards. And why wasn’t there no roughing the kicker penalty on Indy for running into NEs punter? If that was the other way around it would of been automatic first down for Indy. I get that the league wants a new Pats vs Colts rivalry but the game last night seemed one sided. And yes the Patriots had a week to prepare not saying they deserve to win but this game was nowhere near fair. Also I know if this was in NE I’m sure the calls would have gone NEs way it’s like that in every sport.
Wow like Jonathan Taylor is showing us he's forreal!!!
As a colts fanatic for 20+ years you have no idea how elated I am to FINALLY see not only a run game but THE BEST run(ner) in the league! Not since 'the edge' have we fans had anything to talk about PERIODT at the run table lol but now.. we host the run table meetings 😎
As a colts fan for the past 25 years, this felt like a afc championship game I was crying tears of joy after JT scored the last touchdown. After 10+ years of being beaten by the Patriots this felt so good . Good game non the less
definitely had a playoff feeling
JT is a bad boy 💪 him and MPJ are gonna be a scary 1-2 punch in the years to come. Damn good win Indy 💙
Thank you to the Colts and the Steelers.  Thank you also to Brandon Staley’s ‘courage’.  -Chiefs fan I can remember losing in the playoffs twice to the Colts in years when KC fielded a much better team. Mariota and Harbaugh looking at you.  This year I wouldnt make that claim.  I would like to see some payback however.  Colts are a formidable opponent who will take any team to task.  Screw Brady and the Patriots always and forever.  AFC Playoffs will be exciting however the seeding ends up but other than seeding I dont see the current 7 teams positioned for playoffs changing.  I think Chiefs, Titans, patriots, Colts and Bills will lose at worst one more game regular season.  Ravens and Bengals possibly two.
I feel if they played again pats would lay a beat down. I think the bye messed up their momentum a bit. Weren’t playing like themselves. A lot of penalties especially on big plays. The offensive line wasn’t its self in the beginning, couldn’t make lanes for the run game and couldn’t protect Mac. But the pats will win out the rest of their games and are going to be scary in the playoffs.
13:02....Karma for when the Patriots played the Bills....that bad angle from the safety game the Patriots that win in wild, windy, cold weather...and funny how this happened....
WAY TO GO COLTS
Patriots still SUCK!!!LOL.
Fisher just peeled the whole open on taylor Taylor td
Why not dive and leg tackle him inste of unnig beside him into enzo e ya freak bWhahh
So is Indy in the playoffs now?
Wish we had the all 3 helmet to helmet shots flagged got one of the qb called that but then 2 more that took out 2 players one on Agholor and the one of nkeal harry was a clear helmet to helmet no call
7 damn adds in a 14 minute video, so who is the greedy ass person that does that crap...
Good game Colts - showed up ready to play.
Worst Pats game in years.
Taylor is a *beast*.
colts would be a superbowl team without Wentz
Ima pat fans colts got good D
I don’t know why the Niners got rid of Buckner I really miss that guy glad he thriving
Good thing we got rid of Brady, all that bum ever did was win gams.
I think the patriots are use to stopping them at that point but looks like colts have cross that point.
pretty sure that taylor gonna get drug tested like crazy after that game
I always watch all game highlights and I love watching them, however the popup scores on the bottom of screen sometimes really spoil my "fun", already seeing that a certain team is ahead or had won before even having seen the game. Maybe it's just me but i feel like this is a big point of improvement to blur the scores out or something like that.
Wentz barely had to throw the ball. They just controlled the Patriots that was a pretty good performance by those dudes
Vote Taylor for Colts MVP.
The final score was deceiving but also not. The Pats almost came back. Wentz was also hot garbage. Colts knew that NE defense would feast on reckless Wentz so they ran the ball and it paid off.
13:04 Will the colts have enough to finish IT.. 1 second later: TAYLORS GONNA FINISH IT  TOUCHDOWN!!!!!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Not only is it the first time that Indy beat new England in 12 years. It’s also the first time since 2008 that the Colts swept an entire AFC division in a season.
Chiefs winning superbowl 100%
Pats were unbelievable so close to that Brady style comeback. But our defense can't choke on those critical moments
Flight ain’t gonna like this one
I am a cardinals and a colts fan but when I saw that Jonathan Taylor run at the end I’m leaning towards the colts
Former NFL and Colts fan here. I've been disillusioned with the NFL (and NBA as well) for the past several years, so I haven't watched any games. Imagine my surprise when I come across these highlights and see the Colts run heavy offense. When I was watching, it was Manning, then Luck.
Thumbnail is straight up disrespectful
Talk about come from behind, how about them COLTS  they could not buy a game earlier this year, WOW COLTS GOOD JOB,I HOPE THEY MAKE IT TO POSTSEASON, 2 great come BACK teams.....
Massive Colts fan here. Awesome game. I still don't trust Wentz as our QB. However the presence of JT and a strong running game has taken the pressure off of Wentz and allows the offence to put defences in two minds when wanting to shut down our enduring run game. I just fear that if JT is injured Wentz will implode... However, I'll take the win and the season so far. Eager for the play-offs!
That's a 2 year rebuild that's giants ownership are aweful
I mean you better be able to beat a rookie quarter back like bruh its not even impressive 😂
That's what's I'm talking about, let's go colts💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿good game#coltsnation
Well, how nice it is to see the Patriots come back down to earth. Now to be fair, I still think that the Patriots are not to be underestimated.
Taste of victory is sweet and savory
Been saying colts the most dangerous sleeper team for weeks now…
Lol if dude was a little faster pats would have gotten a steal at Qb but I wonder who Tom got pregnant because that’s literally a spitting image of Tom   Football wise
13:14 the only patriot in a crowd of colts fans lmaoooo after the touchdown
I don’t know who they were, but Taylor took at least two souls with him off the field with that touchdown run.  ~_~
I haven't seen our run game be taken away quite so effectively in a while, nor our run defence get shattered like that. Well done Colts. Proud of the boys for trying to come back though.
what is it with this channel leavin' out the good stuff like a fight.  cowards.
Damn the Colts have had some talented running backs over the years, Marshall Faulk, Edgerrin James, Joseph Addai and now Jonathan Taylor.
As a Chiefs fan, thank you Colts! (For helping us with the #1 seed) Now we have fear you all in the playoffs😅
The New England Patriots got exposed
If Harris wasn't injured it be a different game. Taylor vs Harris
Forget about that TB v NE Superbowl meeting the NFL was setting up
JT is on beast mode! MVP for sure!!!
yea! colts dominated
What IS that warm feeling I have?………..oh yes that the feel of the Pats losing….
Thumbnail is quite tragic homie is getting tucked into a coffin
People were really comparing Jones with Brady 😂😂😂😂. Jones is lucky to play for a great defense, great OLine and the goat coach Bill. Brady on the other hand can win with any team and any coach.
come back to this comment when the colts win the super bowl
Great win, still not a Wentz fan.
When the announcer said Taylor will finish it before he had even crossed the first down line 🥶
Watched that taylor run like ten times. That's a beautiful thing. Any relation to Jonathan Taylor Thomas? Hmm I wonder 🤔
Dammmm . left on 20. Before we even got on the bard
I would love to see these teams rematch in the playoffs. I feel like the absence of Damien Harris really limited what the Patriots could do on offense and this game proves that a good RB is still important in the NFL. Congratulations to N'keal Harry, his first highlight reel play comes 3/4 of the way in his 3rd season!
It is appointed unto men once to die, then the Judgement.

My boy Taylor  working haf!!!!!
As a Dolphins fan. THANK YOU INDY
what an awesome thumbnail!
NFL = NATIONAL FIXED / FAKE LEAGUE
I have come to the conclusion that the NFL and NBA are garbage and both needs to be shut down due to being traitors. Why...For supporting China by saying they think Taiwan should be taken over by China.   China is a communist Marxist regime that has killed 100's of millions and has enslaved millions in death camps. They have stolen intellectual property fron the United States while creating horrible trade and tariff deals that have destroyed our labor market costing the US 30 million jobs.   The NFL and NBA have stooped to all time lows. Of it is not bad enough that they charge 100's for tickets, high parking fees at games, expensive concession costs, expensive merchandise, and mostly alienated the true fan base. Players, making millions while the corrupt owners make billions. None of them are worth and many become non productive in society after sports. 78% of NFL players go bankrupt since tge lack academic skills to financially support themselves.  I stopped watching like many others a couple of years ago. It is garbage   They now support communist organizations like BLM and Antifa while knelling and disrespecting our flag.
JT IS A BEAST🚀🚀🚀
Being a Pats fan I’m never a sore loser they beat us fair and square but we are a much better team then the Colts. We made a lot of mistakes and dropped a lot of easy passes and interceptions. We held them to 3 points in the 2nd half and would’ve been 0 points if we didn’t jump offsides on there field goal attempt. Then Taylor breaking away in the last 2 min of the game for a TD. This lose don’t hurt us we’re still winning the division and if we had to play the Colts in the playoffs the outcome will be much different next time believe me. But congrats on the Colts with the W. But forever PatsNation
did I even see Wentz pass the ball?
As a patriots fan we needed this loss
Can’t wait till flight to react to this game
Hello?
👇👇 https://youtu.be/UTapeU7tmpY
The Patriots played absolutely terrible and still was a game at the end. Patriots will be good
Taylor is the mvp this year!
That Colts D is solid...They hit really hard but clean
Can u just imagine if peyton manning and tom brady played in this game!
Colts aren't going anywhere with Wentz at qb... he's good for a 4th down qb sneak and that's about it.  One and done in the playoffs if they make it in.
In the league that has become soft where the refs would call fouls on anything, I’ve never seen anything so one-sided. The Colts would go helmet first into the patriots and the refs didn’t even call one foul. I guess this is the way NFL players. And I don’t even like Boston for the patriots
God bless you guys Always keep God first
What happened Patriots? I thought you were “the best”? LOL!
Thank you Mr. Wentz for our 3rd 1st round pick! Win win all round!! #Colts #Eagles
I'm 100% getting "Taylor's gonna finish it!" t-shirts made.
Wow that flip toss really counted as a TD pass 🤣
Your welcome Bills fans(even though we beat you guys already)  Sincerely, A passionate Colts fan😃
Wooowww colts fans should feel good about there team... Good running game n Defense... Wentz is playing smart now....  Pats punch in the Gut!!!!
Goku:   1:12 this is a Super Saiyan.  2:03 and this is a Super Saiyan who was ascended past a Super Saiyan  13:01 and this is to go even further beyond!
blowout game
Badgley looks like a young pat mcafee at 3:43
GG's Colts. Maybe we'll see each other again in the playoffs, that would be epic.
Too beat a good football team , all you have to do is beat the image . Beat the image and a team will fall apart .
Colts played Colts football and no one can stop them from doing that. Taylor will run all over you and the blocking is good enough that stacking the box barely helps slow it down. Imagine if the Colts got a legit WR opposite of Pittman. It’d be genuinely unstoppable.
God bless you
Lotta happy colts fans in here, but that jones kid looks pretty good not gonna lie.
pats vs Jonathan Taylor
Да уж! Атака была совсем плохая сегодня у Патриотов!
Good job y’all beat them patriots
Patriots played very flat. Like they were just going through the motions.  Pats said Merry Christmas Indianapolis as they gave this one away.
Always nice to see Bill Belichick take one in the shorts.
I dont like the patriots but there is no reason this should've ended this way
It go to show that Tom Brady was the patriots because they ain't the talk of the NFL anymore and they can be beat.
They all shine when the cameras are on take notes.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂and the overrated Patroits got their ass wooped.
And just like that Chiefs have the number 1 seed again. 🤮
Why is a team from Indiana in the NFC 'South' ?
if it wasn't for that blocked punt, Pats win. A lot of losses this season come down to mistakes like that
I feel Carson Wentz is a liability. Missed JT28  for that incomplete pass in the end zone. Too many white jerseys around for my comfort when that INT happened (what do I know?).  3rd&14 Carson kept it; I thought they’d hand it off to JT28. I’ll be the one to say the colts are a QB away from being a contender.
Wentz hasn’t lost a step he doing better with the colts kir but My patriots wtf is ya doing Mac Jones just showed he will not be showing up in big games smh 🤦‍♂️
nice to the see the Colts have found another superstar in Taylor.... imagine this Colts team, with Taylor, that offensive line, and that defense, with Andrew Luck as quarterback?!
JONES IS NOT A JOSH ALLEN TYPE QB...  IN A DOME  ALLEN WOULD KICK HIS ASS!!!
Damn
Wow he got lucky with that one run touchdown but not best game for jones well get the Colts back next season or in playoffs possibly
It was a tough game for the Patriots
What the f happened to my team in this game this is not patriots that have won last 7 straight wtf man
Lucas oil was absolutely electric! COLTS NEED MORE HOME PRIMETIME GAMES!!!!!!
NFL look at the fight it is intentional. The Patriots knew that Micheal was frustrated. As well as he  was caught kicking a cooler then Kyle attacks him to get him OUT on purpose because that’s there best WR they cheated AGAIN Deflate-gate to fighting  the Colts are most likely NOT to get in a fight! He did on PURPOSE
The Colts have the right mindset. The colts are playing like it’s the last game of the season do or die. The Patriots are a trash team no longer one of the top teams in the NFL
Even the linebackers know how to stiff arm
Even though I'm hurt because the New England Patriots lost, I give credit to my former Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz credit for the performance against the New England Patriots at home!!! Carson Wentz and the Indianapolis Colts deserved to win and it was a good day for Carson Wentz. As for the New England Patriots Mac Jones has a lot of work to do!!! Nothing against Mac Jones but Mac Jones has to improve as the quarterback of the New England Patriots!!! Carson Wentz had a good day against New England Patriots!!! I give credit to my former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz a lot of credit against the New England Patriots!!! I'm not trying to judge Mac Jones but Mac Jones has to improve as the quarterback of the New England Patriots!!! Congrats to Carson Wentz on the victory against the New England Patriots!!!
When it's 4th and one and you're rolling back to pass, that is a terrible sign.  4th and one should always be a rushing play...or a maybe a screen.
That was so fun to watch in person. You felt that explosion in your soul when Taylor broke free
Good game, Kudos to the Colts
You all see the " End Racism " sign the NFL has on the end zone back line.. Kinda hard to sympathize when you're watching a game played primarily by black players, all of which are multi millionaires. You think they give 10 percent of their salaries to black run charities ? FOOK NO. So then we are talking about lip service.
JT is MVP bro 💯great year for that guy
Big boy hits in this game
colts are just a pain the arse this year
I'm glad the Colts beat the Patriots
What a game by the colts
Pittman screwed me in fantasy 1 catch
“Do they have enough to finish it…as Frank Reicht said.”  Second later  “TAYLORS GONNA FINISH IT!” 😂
How are all these teams gonna get beat by a non throwing QB smh
Mac Jones literally made like 2 good throws, he’s not the big cheese everyone thinks he is!! Life’s easy when you have the schedule the pats have had this year!!
Jonathan Taylor is a lethal weapon..
Patriots are frauds
Nice pick almost as good as the face mask right after but no flag as always. Kinda messed up the ball carrier can grab the face mask all day but never gets flagged. NFL needs to fix that
The Colts are hungry
aw man....Colts were NOT playing around this game! They are finding their stride at the perfect time....
Jones tried to be like Tom Brady in the second half
This is only more evidence that there are no DOMINANT teams in the NFL.... NOT One!
That thumbnail disrespectful 😭
Colts Are A Dark Horse Now, Just Wait Till Playoff They Will Upset Someone
Bill Belichick doesn't know how to stop a QB run, failed three times in crucial situations. How fitting.
Please tell me they mic'd Darius Leonard for this game.
Bet the pats needed tampons after this loss 😂
Proud of the Colts, though they lacked the killer instinct that would've put the game away much earlier.
Super shocked. Super shocked that the pats lost to the colts
The Colts out physical’d the Pats…both teams will make the playoffs and then we’ll see who learned more from this
"Bill Belichik's gonna take away JT" - All the "experts"
3:00 was BEAUTIFUL
That thumbnail is so disrespectful 😭😭
Quentin Nelson is the truth!!!!
FY Billichicken!!!
Why does wentz gotta start playing well when he gets traded
The Patriots was coming back, it's just that touchdown run that really pulled away. I also feel like if the Patriots scored earlier in the game, then they had a chance of winning
Jonathan Taylor was a beast. He got a bright future ahead of him
Colts really only scored 20. That blocked punt was the difference..pats would have won it without that. Pats would have had another score
Patriots defense SUCKS!
I'm glad the Colts beat the Patriots. I'm not a Colts fan but I like to see an underdog team win. That Johnathon Taylor played great.
Great technique from LB 58. I love the colts defense bruh.
What an amazing game!! Thx Colts for this big win!!!
I knew Taylor would finally be a great back out of Wisconsin in the NFL (they produce great backs who haven't always panned out in NFL). I didn't expect this good, this soon.
night night Patriots!aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaa
If I were Belechick, defence would have walked home from Indy.
A game colts fans have wanted since 2005
Patriots got punched in the mouth. Mac is talented but not ready.
The idea of Wentz playing an entire game of full contact with all those players without a mask, then immediately donning a mask when the game is over, is just laughable.
Fun Fact: I have the same birthday as Jonathan Taylor
BOYCOTT ALL SOCIAL MEDIA....SHUT IT DOWN
Pats blew this game.
Jones goes down like a girl, similarly to how Brady used to go down. Afraid to get hit.
Hope my Colts don't play any more teams with an offensive player named "Henry".   I see a pattern and I don't like it.
This colts blue runs through my blood we've showed guts this year and that we can pretty much hang with anybody but winning this game really proves that we can not only play with best but we can also win
I wish Jonathan Taylor wasn’t standing between me and a Fantasy championship so I could root for him.
This game has huge playoff implications
The Indianapolis Colts are 8-6 🔵🐎5th in the AFC
The N F L woke is putting it’s fans in danger supporting defunding the police . It’s time not too watch the N F L . They don’t care about their fans .
Beautiful game! Go Pats!
That thumbnail is the perfect amount of DisrespectfulAF.
The colts run so well, I'm nervous for next Saturday.  The cards suck at run defense without Watt.  😔
Hell of a victory!!! This team is firing on all cylinders!!
Its amazing to me how everybody hyped up matt jones when the Patriots were winning even though the run game was winning them games.when he did that dirty play after an interception yall called him tough and he had fire all of you people were on his jock.you know damn well he is no tom brady.he showed me nothing name a Alabama quarterback that was successful
Taylor's good, but 13:02 proves he's no Nick Chubb.
You know what, as a Pats fan I don’t even care about this game because I know Brady will win tonight against the Saints and will get his 8th rings, so this doesn’t even matter
Carson Wentz is getting carried by Jonathan Taylor lol
If the colts stay healthy , make the playoffs,  they are going to be a tough out ....
As a Broncos fan, we need the Colts to lose but at the same time we need the Chiefs to get first round bye to make our final game easier. Game really had me in a box.
8:27 looked like mahomes
All that mac jones hype before the game 😂 colt D made him look silly
Way to go Colts 👍 🏈 That made my day.   Just RUN IT DOWN THEIR THROATS
F the Patriots haha
Taylor seems unstoppable but big Credit with a cap C to that offensive line, best in the league
"Here's Taylor....... TAYLOR'S GONNA FINISH IT!!!!!!!!!"  lmao a true blow.
THE RIVALRY IS BACK ON
Ltriots
Keep watching the NFL while your gov steals yours liberties.
Mac Jones is who we thought he was. Everyone thinks the patriots success is from mac but it's not. The pats success up until this point has been defense and coaching. When the opponents defense and opponents running game is better than their game plan then that's when pats gets exposed.
mac jones is trash but the media LOVES him.
The Colts should have retired the #21 jersey for Bob Sanders. He definitely earned it.
Two int's by Mac didn't help and a punt blocked. When you turn the ballover like that you can't expect good things to happen.
So glad the Patriots lost. But I have to see it in the playoffs first. No superbowl with brady, Belichick or mahomes this year. If the nfl riggs it in any form I will not support it
The Patriots came back well from a terrible start. In a repeat fixture I could see the Patriots turning the tables.
Did that punt feel too long, or were they too fast for him?!
Poor Patriots!
Colts fans all hyped cuz they beat a rookie QB...funny. remind me of Bills fans acting like it was a huge deal winning the division the yr their daddy leaves it.
Still hurts seeing buck in a colts uniform. Glad he is proving our front office wrong.
Refs vs patriots. Only 2 penalties on colts all gmae
I ain't even mad, I'm impressed how the Colts trounced us
Pats fans shouldn't complain. They have been getting free wins from the Texans panthers jets ect and they gave jags and dolphins which is another 2 free wins. They got it easier than all
I don’t wanna hear nothin about Carson wentz he is a liability if u ask me
I think Mac takes to many steps back, he needs to release ball faster, and special teams lost the game for the patriots. Keep giving the ball to Stevension #38
How did Wentz get credit for a passing TD? That little flip to Hines counted as a pass? 😂
It’s cool but patroits  colts tripping tripping JT doing wayyyy too much running for that team both need new QB 🤷🏾‍♂️
I've never seen a highlight reel of a single game where one team's offense was almost all running plays. Wow
9:29 what's that Brady animation?
Donte Hightower sold big time all that money wasted on his bum ahh
afc South predictions worst division my aas media.  every year they propagate that and every year they are wrong . its become a normal with the current marxist media Tactical campaigns where everything is Opposite .
Once again, the colts overcome coaching and Wentz to win a big game. Jonathan Taylor is a beast!
4:23 For that AMAZING STIFF ARM
NFL colts are big fat cheater
Bb bb b bb b b bb bbb b bbb
Colts are legit if you ask me just need Wentz to not make mistakes I see them going far
Titans have clearly tied or led the afc almost all year so now if they win against steelers they will win out and finish out #1.
This game reminds me of steelers cowboys daks first year
2 patriots players had a chance to takle Taylor for a short game smh but Taylor said not today 🤦🏾‍♂️
I know I’m late, but as a Chief’s fan, thank you Colts.
Thank you Colts!
been saying that if the colts match up with the pats in the playoffs they may have their number.....
COLTS NATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mac jones is dak prescott rookie year
It’s crazy how this game would be way different without the blocked punt. If Bailey doesn’t stop to fix the grip he would get the punt off.
The owner of the Patriots abused a young girl in Florida last year and escaped all responsibility using his money & power it's funny how karma takes over: 1st star quarterback leaves, now his fledgling team meets the reality that they deserve under an owner who abuses women for his own needs--  I wonder if he sent her family a Christmas card
As a Dallas fan I’m happy that wentz is succeeding in a place that isn’t nfc
Eagles fan here knew Wentz would do better here but kinda glad we don't have him still wish him best of luck but he was never meant for Philly always have love for him tho
How bout them cults Jesus.
Pats loose it's a good day lol
Jones and company got slammed too the ground quickly. Mac Jones is not the next Tom Brady not by a long shot.
What n exciting game n very intertaining n great for the colts happy for them n city n fans one of the best games this season
Excellent tackling by the Colts on defense. Haven’t seen tackling like that in a long time. Oh and JT for MVP!
As a Chargers fan, its good seeing Badgley still missing kicks lol
As a Patriots fan, I have to admit that was some solid defence by the Colts. Great game, really enjoyable. Good job Indianapolis.
Browns fan here and for a wild card spot we rlly needed colts to lose, well played colts
The NBA should take notes on how to post a games recap highlights
So living here in NEW England you think the game would be on our local channels NOPE
Can the Cowboys trade zeke for Taylor lol
He telegraphs his passes too much easy to see where he’s going in this game.
What did we learn....Jones won't lose but he damn sure won't win the game. He is a rookie though. GG
Great win Colts!
10:26 wtf is Mac Jones gonna do 😂😂
What happened Patriots, couldn’t cheat your way out of it? What happened, I thought the Cheatriots were “the most dangerous team in the NFL” 😂😂😂😂😂 🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼
Colts  =  Super Bowl bound
As a chiefs fan thank you Colts
Jonathan Taylor is a beast!  I hope he takes care of his body to have a long career. The Colts are dangerous! I am glad the Patriots got their butts kicked. They deserve it. This is coming from Boston
I’ve haven’t seen the Patriots make so many mistakes in a long time. They totally beat themselves last night. But I have to admit, Johnathan Taylor is awesome.
Jonathan Taylor runs like Le'Veon Bell
Some hard hitting went on last . Great game , colts defense , especially the db's  some big time Hits . Gotta think there's some sore  player's this morning .
So Colts gave to the Patriots and Bill their own medicine. This is how Bill and Patriots were beating Colts while Payton played. Totally mirrored game.
#16 Meyers should be cut by the Pats. He had so many drops with Brady and now Jones. Luckily Pats still won some of those games when Meyers dropped passed from Jones(the game vs the Texans). So much bullshit with him
I miss Kendrick Bourne  we should held on to him smh #49ERS
As a Pat's fan, I was NOT buying the hype. Pump the breaks on AFC champs and Superbowl contenders. Mac Jones is who he is: a rookie quarterback. He was not making good throws, and he was oft late on his throws (not counting the INT when Leonard broke from his responsibility and just made a great play. A better arc on the ball and it might've been a different story). The blocked punt TD was the friggin' punter's fault! He took forever to get that ball away. On the 62-yard TD run by Taylor, McCourty has to be better! There is no "Patriot Way" anymore. Off-sides on a field goal attempt? Stupid false start and motions? Can't convert or stop 4th downs? Colts were finishings blocks with mean intentions. WAKE UP, PATS!
Dumb dumb Patriots should've stuck with Cam.
Back in the old days Patriots and Colts used to be division rivals. Division: AFC East
End racism      Seems like the nfl is very racist with 78% non Caucasian in the league
Taylor been waiting to really take the reigns as the lead rb i’m glad he’s fulfilling his potential rn
mac jones has a weak arm
I laughed so hard, Pats got ran on like they did to the Bills lol and they couldn't stop it.
I'm glad the colts won even tho I'm a cowboy fan it's better for the playoffs for the colts they deserve a good season
Hell yea colts keep it going baby!!
The refs had bad calls there were so many calls they missed on the colts
Need that Darius Leonard stiff arm animation in Madden
the best https://youtu.be/bPDhgWO9Poo
Patriots Look Vulnerable.
M. Jones came back down to earth
Man Taylor Is A Beast !! Hey Barkley Take Notes !
Nah he was looking who to drop
The NFL continues to praise Mac Jones while he’s an average quarterback. Throw him on any other team and he wouldn’t even be mentioned. It’s only because he’s on the patriots. They continue to kiss his ass because he’s under Bill Belichick. Just like the rest of the NFL kisses Tom’s Brady,$ ass.
Taylor!
Do you know how fast you have to be to  best JC Jackson in a footrace down the field? Taylor is THAT dude
Not too familiar with roughing the kicker calls, but isn't it against the rules to hit a kicker in the plant leg? That's what looked like happend to me on the punt block.  Also, I have an unhealthy hatred for the Patriots so I am not being biased lol.
Mac Jones is overrated
0-0-0-17 cmon now 💀
The colts would be so damn good with a QB that isn't a complete wildcard.
As a Cardinals fan, I very much fear the idea of watching Taylor run all over us on Christmas 😂
Man JT IS MVP give the RB some love without him we would not be were we is put some respect on his name best RB in the league
I think the colts have a chance for Súper bowl 56.
Where’s that run the damn ball guy cuz they did just that!
Pats weak run d got exposed
Mac Jones is honestly amazing!!!! I saw so much I didn’t even know he was capable of doing this game. His escapability, pocket poise. That throw off his back foot going across his body that everyone raves about when someone else does it. His speed on the run out! Not a great game from him or the Patriots as a whole by any means but he has definitely put the league on notice of his abilities. Bright future for him and this organization #Patsnation has a lot to look forward too with this kid.
Nw it will com 2 life commentary going chew an spit Belichick out 4 this one Mac j is a awesome QB that’s that’s my ninja from Alabama 2 he get my vote .. hme time bt he nt TB12 feel me this nt College football in November and December the NFL elite come out to play bring your A game nothing less gud game Mac keep ur head up ⬆️ bro 😎 ur career nn the nfl will b a Great one
As a browns fan, they need to give mac jones the same criticism as baker gets for having a bad game
Just...........WOW.........J.T is unbelievable...... himself and Cook are at the top of their game....I hope Taylor gets done right with a contract and not used to his fullest.......  Please 🙏🙏 let this 🌟 keep shinning..... exciting as F to watch....every run even if stopped
Can’t wait for flight reaction
Jonathan Taylor reminds me of Larry Johnson so much. Light on his feet, patient and strong
YESSSS! As a "Dolfan" anytime Pats lose is great! Hard-fought game won by Indy. Hope Miami D can dominate Pats too in Week 18!🙏
Bruh taylor
Taylor ain't doing nothing..Henry been doing the same thing at a higher level for the past few year.
As a colts fan, we need to get rid of Wentz
Colts thought they won the superbowl 😂😂😂
Die Hard Chiefs Fan Here......good job Colts 👍
this is where the old conservative coaching kills the pats. half the coaches in the league go for that 2nd TD instead of taking the 3 points when you're down that far. would have still been in that game at the end if you made it and if you didn't the defence was turned up already and had a good chance at makeing the quick stop. huge shout out to JT tho what a beast
A good run GAME cured all.
Ads every two minutes certainly doesn’t get old, YouTube. Thanks!
Why do they Colts insist on throwing late with a lead after running so well
Good  for you Weinz
Wow, I was beginning to believe the media hype that the Patriots were an actual threat this year. Thank goodness they just prop them up due to their fan base size.
as a pats fan this was a frustrating game, but well needed. get a loss under their belt and push for this last stretch before the playoffs. winning out and not losing a playoff game would've been tough to do.
Colts starting to wake up again 💜💪
Nightmare in Indie for Pats fans.
JT is so damn good. That long run was just icing on the cake.
As a Patriots fan, considering this was one of if not the worst performance all year for the Patriots with their flags and turnovers, I’m not that worried. Defense also gave up 20 points but if you don’t account for the very last run to end the game, they only gave up 13 which is impressive.
WTF man this game was on Saturday?
Lmaooo really just exposed Mac jones he’s actually garbage
This game was very interesting. From the holding by the colts line to the big hit helmet to helmet at the end of the game that the refs decided not to call that endangered the players. There was definitely some questionable officiated that night. It was not a fair fight by any stretch of the imagination. Colts are a great team let them win on their own merit. As a colt fan I don't feel good about this win.
Eagles fan here thank you colts
Just wondering what’s the rules about running into the kicker?!?
The play design man sheesh! 😳 Frank throwing it back to 2017-18 postseason with these.
If the Colts didn't start 1-4 every year they'd probably be pretty good.
Taylor's top end speed is remarkable for a 225 lb running back
Every Dolphins fan worldwide jumped up with that Taylor run 🐬✊🏾💯
Beautiful
I left Taylor on the bench by accident 😑
Bro 58 put on acrobat
Pat's really need to beef up their DLine. No first round bye for new England now but will get the division title next week
Why the hell would you run RPO with Wentz on 3rd and 14? Even if it fools everyone it's not going anywhere. Plus Wentz is made of glass so you're flirting with disaster. I wouldn't even run QB sneaks with him because Mahomes dislocated his kneecap on one of those.
Pats looked very unprepared to play. They seemed taken aback at the Colts calls and aggressive start on both sides of the ball. Took them til the 4th to figure it out.
The colts o-line gives me fomo :(
Wentz has another great game.  Thanks Philly.
Been calling this Colts win for a month Pats haven't beaten any good teams this year (and don't say the Bills they stink in 2021).....Colts are legit - a running game and a quality defense can still win in today's NFL
Colts #2 wimp puttin' on the mask at the end of the game. Disgusting
Carson #birdGang we miss u in Philly broski
Man jt is scary fast strong and smart he stays healthy he a problem for years to come
I started Stevenson and the kicker . I’m so screwed this week
If Madden gave OLs X-Factors it would be called Pancake
Patriots have a easy schedule now they actually playing comp  lol they not winnig anyomore games unless the schedule easy
As a colts fan this is one of my favorite games in a long time
Wen u bringin a nife to a Gun-fight  this is how u end up in URGENT-Care orEmergancy Room🤗
90% of refs calls based upon home town decision for Indianapolis. Nice fight btw... Taylor is on drugs.
Nothing but respect to the Colts. They came prepared and ready to play. If anything, this loss should motivate the patriots going into the playoffs.
Lets be honest king henry would've done the same thing. Pats over rated without brady
I still don’t like Carson Wentz know the Colts the Colts I’m not gonna go anywhere with that type of plate from the quarterback. And the coach I don’t like him either they can get rid of both of them to sometime especially a quarterback he’s horrible big games he’s always throwing the ball behind the receiver interception come on Siri he only has six but he’s always had a crucial time he just don’t have what it takes all those draft picks and he is disappointing I can hardly watch them if you want for Jonathan Taylor where is the passing game we don’t even have one game over
Is this one of the COVID reschedules
These Colts are channeling their inner Bob Sanders. They were hitting hard all game.
When the Titans need the Pats to win they loose. Go figure.  The Titans will most likely loose the rest of they're games anyway.
Hulu sucks for taking this game.
Ah! Como é gostoso ver o Patriots perdendo.
Did not expect that
Ever since Covid…fake fan noise is ridiculous :(.
Jonathan Taylor has 1,518 yards of rushing, I’m predicting hes get around 1,800 rushing yards so bro been beast. I can see a pro bowl appearance this year
Colts hit the kicked or blocked punt.
To all die hard colts fans do you realize that  this is our first win against the patriots since Peyton manning
So... the Colts used Patriots strategy from last week against them xD Good riddance.
stiff arm Right after the interception is nasty
I do believe that makes us 1-1 since Chris Ballad said it’s on??
Bro as a colts fan, I love seeing bill belicheck lose. It brings so much joy to my heart and I’m even more happier cause my team beat them. Btw: jt is top ten all time
KC # 1 SEED SOON
Any decent high school quarterback can do what Jones does every game. 5-10 yard dumps. Dude is garbage and I think Belichick knows it lmao 😂
Big win, go Colts 💙
Now we just need the Steelers to win.
Be careful out there JT
Bucs v colts superbowl book it
Wasn't that a roughing the kicker penalty on that blocked punt?
Colts played great. Good game. Jt with the big run was the nail in coffin but!! The drive before with the no call on Harry was disappointing ,huge momentum change
Patriots got exposed.  Looks like more people will be running it down their throats before the regular season is over.  Almost as embarrassing as the Buffalo defence.
The colts didn't out play them they out played themselves from jump
That thumbnail crazy🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥
Bro when pitman got ejected I was so mad
Watching the kicker for The Colts, really makes me realize how good Justin Tucker is for my home team The Ravens. The Ravens have really won by just Tucker alone lol. This guy for The Colts had some misses that shouldn't have been missed lol
Mac gave Buckner that sack
Indy seems like a dangerous team.  Wentz can just fall forward for the rest of the season and get first downs.  The guy is like a tree.  Just don't pull a 28-3 like my team.
I’m a patriots fan but I respect the colts for this win they played hard and beat the pats on most plays. I can’t wait to see them in the playoffs!
Wentz once again gets carried through a big game 😂 dudes a bum
"And this game isn't over!"  Johnathan Taylor: It's over
Colts are gonna be in the afc championship
Felt like a healthy loss after a 7 game win streak. The pats roster should feel confident if they see the colts again...
Jt vs the Patriots highlights
That lil gravedigger sack comm was unsportsmanlike
Taylor is overrated bro
PAT WILL GET KILLED BY THE 🪓🪓🪓 IF THEY PLAY. GKC!!!
my teacher made a bet with the principal so my teacher said if the patriots win that the principal has to be a patriots fan but if the colts win than the principal gets to tease my teacher for a year
You guys ever get that weird smell on your fingers that you can’t stop smelling?
Nice to see someone finally show who the Patriots really are. Nice job Colts.
12:58 oh……it’s over
When i saw the first half, i said:The New England will lose. And i was right...
Colts allways bring it Thats american football
Speaking as a Bucs fan: The Colts look scary/dangerous.
Patriots' O line had me holding my breath every play but Colt's D came up big.
Oh New England see what happens when you actually play a decent football team not some scrub team
Maybe the pats would have won if they still had Cam.🤣
😩😩 i left JT and the colts defense on my bench
Don't post the score over the game highlights !
As an Eagles fan i really wanna see Carson ball out
Damn!!@Pats was not ready for this one. Some of those players needed some Colada on their system.
I am not mad with this loss mac showed we could come back down 20 in the 4th Jones two picks were terrible especially that red zone one and thoes peneltys
Like i said... without Tom Brady, patriot is garbage
Love that everyone thought the pats were gonna win lol
Colts are winning the afc
Bills run the table. Patriots lose the table
That's what happens when the pats play a team that's good!🤣
I’m a Chiefs fan so there’s no biasedness. JT should win MVP. TJ watt should be 2nd. Oh wait I forgot the MVP = Best QB. Smh
No it proved Colts are a bad mf and JT deserves the M.V.P
👏 congratulations to the colts. I did not understand the hype surrounding Jared golf and Carson Wentz coming out of college.  Who should be drafted first?looks like neither one should have been drafted at all. They aren't bad, but the aren't great either 😕
Told ppl it's not no dam Mac Jones son iight but this baby goat thing is wild cap
Very unsportsmanlike game on behalf of Colts. They were rude,  and disrespectful bullies right down to coaches. They should be ashamed, of themselves.  It was not a fair win in my estimation.
I still think the smart play for the long run by Taylor was to go down inbounds short of the endzone. That would either make the patriots use all their time outs or have colts kneel for the win. Winning is the goal not the stats.
Delighted for the Colts' fans; every part of their team played like heroes.
Fantasy owner’s worried the whole game taylor said I got you
Honestly this was a good game. New England didn’t even really play horrible they just had some rotten luck on some plays. Sometimes it’s just not in the cards
The amazing unbeatable patriots hahaha! I called bs and I nailed it... old plays no receivers other than tightend grunt
How about them colts
Will they have enough to finish It..TAYLORS GONNA FINISH IT!!!!!
What a blitz pick up by Taylor. That was awesome. Wood Weee, colts something fierce. Big Defense. Running with Taylor. Gonna bring havoc in the playoffs.
This game had some hard hits
I hope they gave the game ball to the Colts O-line, jeez they were nasty this game.  Quinton Nelson is just too good, I hope he has a long and healthy career, he's too fun to watch pancaking people, and hustling to be the first person to help a teammate up after a play.
As a patriots fan, since i like like a hour away to fenway, colts deserved this win, and as a patriot’s fan, they had to lose there win streak one day 😂
Patriots OC Josh McDaniels should have got the game ball as thanks for bailing on the Colts head coach job a few years ago.  Like the Longest Yard when Paul Crewe gave the warden the game ball, stick this in your trophy case
I'M SURE THESE SPEEDSTERS ARE ON ROIDS. INVESTIGATE NOW!
Love seeing pats get a beatdown
If the Broncos had Melvin Gordon, Jonathan Taylor, AND Javonte Williams... we'd only run the football.
All this with a backup center.  Colts will be scary in the playoff cold.  They are no longer a fluff dome team.  They are physical af.  Playoffs may be interesting this season every team has a head scratcher loss somewhere in the schedules
Good win for the Colts but the Pats were off tonight. Defense wasn't playing like they have been and o line letting that kick get blocked and returned for a td.
The amount of ads is ridiculous
2:58 that jump into the pile 🤣
GM's will be selling their souls to get Taylor into their teams. Damn !
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I like the wr Dulin that man looks like he can be s star. Speed yes. Catching yes. What do you all think?
I'm a cheater you are a cheater let's all be cheaters like New England too. Glad Indy won
The Pats have a problem with defending the run . In this game as well as the last the run defense has been exposed ...
Now THIS is GOOD FOOTBALL
If the Colts would have one a few of the games they should have they might have the top seed in AFC ! Go Colts !!
Don't count out Arizona?? Young gun could win it all
When the Patriots lose its a good day!
Patriots are still strong. Looking at the highlights, I saw that they had a penalty from the kick that was initially missed, and after that, Mac Jones missed a target at the end zone. Of course there were probably more mistakes made, but not enough for me to worry about the Patriots. As for Indy? Nice running, but let’s see how teams scheme for them in the Playoffs. Stuff the run game and force Wentz to throw…often? Who knows? Gg tho.
The Chiefs, Bills and Eagles are happy with this Colts win. 😀
Loved watching the shitriots lose!!
As a patriots fan the colts played an excellent  game they disguised coverage s really well  I wouldn't  be surprised if that team makes  it to the superbowl
The patriots finally played a team with a Healthy full roster with good defense.🤷🏿‍♂️
I wonder where these dumb ass analysts are gonna Power Rank NE now. I've never disliked Power Rankings so much since this year...
TIRED OF WATCHING HUMILITY-LACKING PLAYERS EVERY WEEK.
After Pittman got ejected I started to worry but the colts still closed it out. That’s a big win that we needed
KC 1 😆😆😆
We've all had enough of the Patriots
All we have to do is listen to the analysts talk about what a team or player hasn't struggled with and they will struggle with whatever it may be.. has been the story this season.
N’KEAL HARRYYYYYY
So they was a little rusty off the bye rellaaaaxxxxx LOL
You can always rely on Wentz to throw a interception when the Colts have momentum,Taylor and the offensive line saved Wentz again.
Predict correct
Colts achilles will be their PK leading to postseason. The incumbent PK is just as unreliable as the former. Taylor should average upwards in the 20 carries per game. They have the OLIne to control LOS & definitely have the horses in Taylor & Hines. Colts will only set themselves up for failure if they leave up to Wentz with his TO happy crucial passes.
Man, something about JT reminds me of barry
Mac Who?
tell Jonathan Taylor its ok to be tackled
As a patriots fan this was a tough one to watch. Congratulations colts you absolutely dominates us through 3 quarters! Unprecedented huge victory. Hope for a rematch in the playoffs!
I kid you not, every single time I start watching these Pats highlights, the announcer shocks me with "Jones throws to...." and I'm thinking what happened to Brady?  Was he injured in training this week?  Then.....yes, I know.  But it's really incredible that he's not in that uniform.
As a pats fan, Im not gonna be cocky and arrogant... The colts played the much better and much more physical game. I truly believe that we played a lot better in the 2nd half aside from the last TD by JT. The win streak had to end eventually and Im proud of Macs willingness to play hard and not give up in the 2nd half. GG Colts, I respect you guys and JT is a beast definitely the best player we've had to deal with all year.
Indy took a okay out of Dallas Playbook and Pounded the rock! Ran the ball down New England's throat! My dark horse sleeper team is Indy!
Banana
I think he has a chance to be the all time rushing leader if he keeps it up. At the end of the season he could have 3000 yards including last season in total. And he’s only 22 years old as long as he doesn’t get hurt he will be amazing
Gg to the colts. They obviously have running game and a stout defense. But it's okay next week we play buffalo that has no run game, also I'll say this, I'm not sure another rookie QB stays in that game.
The weakest link is Wentz.  Throwing that few of passes and still getting an interception vs a winning team.  They need more than a dink n dunker.
Now the Patriots fans can shut up
To the nfl & Steve Smith:  Stop overrating mac & blaming the receivers in this game because they have been carrying mac ALL season (with his 90% 5yrd passes all season) along with the running game, defense & weak schedule. mac is the reason new england lost..he didn't throw last weak & new england wins, he throws this week & new england loses. wents is also garbage as we seen in the game he replicated mac last week in attempts.
Colts almost did a Colts. But O line and RB came to save the day.
Where the Wentz haters at?
Colts dominated
I called the upset Patriots fans
Damn I thought you Pats fans were winning 81-3🤣 where’s the stupid ass that said that
Force dink and dunk Jones to throw more than 4 yards and look what happens
Is it just me or did the Colts "Patriot", The Patriots???
They took a page from Pats/Bill's... Only throwing for 5 receptions.
Great win Colts, now on to the next one. Colts vs Cardinals Christmas night!!! LETS GO COLTS!!!!!!
Haha Mac had to lead the team and throw more than 4 yards and look what happened. Colts let them come back.  Jones couldn't ride the defence this time and play a real team and look what happened. Free wins from the Texans panthers jets ect and now you lose
Too many commercials for a 15 minute clip. The first commercial “break”, not including the intro commercials, was at about 1 and a half minutes.
This is the first time the Colts have beaten the Patriots since the 4th and 2 game
It seems Mac Jones isn't perfect after all. That he maintained his composure after that 1st and 2nd picks speaks volumes. It's going to be a long week for him. And the colts might do well to curb their enthusiasm, considering they barely squeaked by with a home field victory against a late 1st round rook QB, who will do nothing but improve over the course of his up and coming career. And those picks will loom large in his development, going forward.  That Colts kicker is going to cost them when it matters.  Good game between two perennial rivals with storied battles for supremacy.
LOVE when pats lose !!!!!
The luck of the cheatriots is over...
Thought it would be a good week to play against Taylor in fantasy. I was wrong. Come on Pats.
Jonathan Taylor best RB in the league. Should be league MVP
Jonathan Taylor and the Colts offensive line played great. They have a very good defense, in terms of forcing turnovers. As long as Carson Wentz doesn't have to throw the ball much, they're going to be a tough out in the playoffs.  If an opponent makes them one-dimensional, and Wentz is forced to throw it, that's when they'll have big issues.
Quentin Nelson is the best o-lineman I'm the NFL. GOOD LORD.
This game pats let the colts win
Wentz is 5 for 12 lol.  Colts needs a QB, get Aaron Rogers and go to the SB!
Tbh colts got lucky Meyers missed 20 yrd pass and next play was a blocked field goal td
Great way to bounce back N.E, great game and win Indy
Colts ran it down their throat!
Colts defense looked impressive
Mac jones throws like jimmy g
The pats were playing some garbage teams their luck finally ran out. It's Sunday take your behinds to church then it's game time baby!
Taylor gotta be the best running back including the past couple years
Isaiah Wynn is trash and shouldn't be on the line anymore he is too small and undisciplined
Confused the hell out of me when they broke the 180° rule and the Patriots went from attacking Right to left - to Left to Right 9:18
Still enjoy to see the loss by the  evil empire.
That effort JT made to pave the way for Hines is the ultimate teammate that players will stay because of it
Wentz is the worst qb in th league. Start Sam Ehlinger.
STOP GIVING AWAY THE RESULT WITH THE FRONT PHOTO! THERE IS NO POINT AVOIDING THE RESULT TO BE GIVEN THE OUTCOME AS SOON AS YOU LOAD UP THE HIGHLIGHTS
So is it a passing TD everytime another player hands it off in the reverse sweeps like that? Stats say Wentz got a passing TD off the Hines run. If so I never knew that. There must be a lot more non QB passing TD's in the league than I thought.
F…. New England 😂😂😂
Yall got referee luck ive seen holding from colts never called that game was terrible
Meh. It's no Manning/Brady. #HttRedskins
Taylor should get mvp tired of qbs getting it all the time
Total team win, dominated start to finish! Great job colts!
Always a good day or night when the Patriots lose
Belichick has to let Mac show off that arm more
Matt Jones had 299 yards and 2 touchdowns and lost
Why a Saturday game?
JT is a beast. I would know he’s on my fantasy team
should of kept Brady , launched the Belichick twins . No way Brady losses to the lowly Colts
I loved watching this game because I’m colts fan
HES THE GOAT
pats miss brady
13:15 Call me a hater but seeing this mopey b made my day. Best thing I've seen all week.
Mac Jones will be a force to be reckoned with.
The Patriots had too many mistakes. Penalties, turnovers, and they just couldn’t stop Taylor. I understand that he is an amazing running back, and I love him (except when we play him) but we knew they would run. They barely threw at all. 5 passes in a dome!? But, JT had 170 yards.
Going into this game the patriots were in the drivers seat. After falling apart in this one it looks like they can plan on a quick playoff exit
ASHTON DULLIN!!!
Downtown Indy was INSANE last night.
Colts: Today's Lesson will be "DEFENSE"...
That blocked punt was beautiful. I needed this patriots loss
Makes me wonder why the browns didnt just keep running Johnson during their matchup after he dominated the first drive
Jonathan Taylor is an absolute stud and our defense is phenomenal, let's go Colts!!!
Wentz might have had a bad passing game, but how about those play fakes, 4th down QB sneaks, and a couple runs when things broke down
The Trophy is going to the NFC
I guess the chiefs are hands down the best in the AFC now
Colts are way better than their record. Very dangerous team getting very hot at the right time. Some serious studs on that team with Nelson and Leonard being easily the best in their positions in the entire league. As a dolphins fan it's great to see the pats getting their arse handed to them.
The pats got themselves in a big hole on the road, early, it's rare any team wins that game vs a good opponent
What, the newly crowned media darling Mac Jones threw an INT in prove it or lose it time?
I don’t want to play anyone starting jonathan taylor in fantasy anymore.
On to Arizona!!!
😮‍💨
Maaan that colts came here to play for the win and nothing else !!! Darius leonard best LB for real
Patriots defense sucks,, not sure why people say this defense is strong, are they blind.. they were sliced and diced
Damn they did my boy Meyers dirty on that thumbnail lol
there are few things in this world that make me happier than watching the Patriots lose
Good win colts💙💙
Mac Jones is like Jimmy g. Scheme helps him out
The Pats fan at 13:16 LOL
Cmon too sanitised , show the fisticuffs
Someone's getting a Ball Hawk tshirt
Wow the Colts won but if it wasn't for that run back for a touchdown I don't think the Indianapolis Colts would have won
Carson wentz showing some christians will mask up
Legit win, but their record is fluff. They get four free wins playing Jags and Texans. Not impressed at all by them, but they do have potential.
Who is crying now Bill Burr 🤣
Eagles fans...1st round pick baby! Thanks Colts!!
Colts almost blew a 20 point lead lol
Colts back at it again starting the season 1-4 then coming back to 8-6 being contenders for the playoffs.
Can't wait for new Hard Knocks
great win!!!
Mac Jones sold his team today but he’s a rookie.
Wentz will be the colts downfall. Telling yall right now.
I’ve never seen the Patriots make this many mistakes in a game.
Colts have definitely improved and gave Patriots a little of their own medicine at what they did against the Bills..and ran it down their throat..very entertaining game though
lol mac jones didn't like w.ev wentz said to him @ 14:22
Pats fan here, the real thing about this colts team is Nelson they just have to run behind him and then JT finishing the job..
That Leonard stiff arm tho
The thumbnail tho 😂
Pats been feeling themselves it's good to see a loss
It’s going to be hilarious when the Chiefs lose their playoff opener.
JT is the BADDEST MAN in the league f*** the Patriots
When people say about generational talent I think of Quenton nelson. Monster
Colts matchup well against the Patriots. If they don't have a retard at qb spot this game wouldn't even be close
This was a complete reversal of last week’s game between the Patriots and the Bills when Mac Jones only threw three passes (Carson Wentz only 5 for 12) and the Patriots’ run game stuffed it down the Bills’ defense (Colts’ Jason Taylor rammed the Patriots’ run defense to the tune of 170 yards).
As a Colts fan JT saved us If they got that stop it would’ve been over I still think this year not our year But Ion wanna play the patriots again at all
That quick slice cut to the open space was a thing of beauty
https://youtu.be/j-abNPky3RI
Colts beat the pats like the pats beat the bills
Looks like the patriots running out of gas
I work with a Colts fan and I've been telling him for 2 months that if they make the playoffs, nobody is going to want to play them. Not with that running game and defense. Controlling the line of scrimmage is what wins football games and they do that on both sides of the ball.
The bucs beat the colts GO BRADY
Looks like Talyor just won Rookie of the year
If you had the colts defense in fantasy ur lucky
Colts must thank Jonathan Taylor everyday Just for being alive
Mac might be the best rookie QB of all time but in this game he looked bad. Somewhere Tom Brady is laughing while watching this.
This was one hell of a game
adverts are way too long ya creetttinnss
for people who are unaware, the colts are better than their record
Just the thumbnail on this one is so cool
Funny how pats scored over 20 points in 4th quarter. Game was thrown easy to see.
Colts won the superbowl! They played like it was it, wow, the inferiority complex is haaard
Man JT….is special 💯
As a Chiefs fan, we appreciate the effort as were now the #1 seed with some space and 3 games to go, but the colts look like a formidable playoff team. Should be fun in January. Good game well played Colts.  #ChiefsKingdom
the colts kicker with a helmet on really looks like a young pat mccafee
I can see Nick Wright smiling now, about this Mac Jones performance
Loving it
mac jones got a bright future but hes just a rookie. micah parsons has a bright future but hes just a rookie. both deserve rookie of the year.
Dang the Colts were like “hey look we can win without throwing the ball too” lol
The Colts beat NE at their own game. 👌 Poetic.
Let’s go colts!!!
Can't want for the playoffs
I hate when ppl pronounce Taylor as “Teller”

There were some big hits this game.
colts kicker blows.....
Absolutely dominant performance by the Colts. 👏🏼
The thumbnail for this vid is disrespectful lol
Gg to the colts fans. Your team played their heart out. Felt like this bye week hurt my patriots more than it blessed them. JT is a monster. God bless
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtoIWUkY-c4
Why do the graphic images have overtly large muscles? You know what’s more impressive. How big these dudes are without SpongeBob’s anchor arms.
The Colts basically beat the Patriots will the same game plan the Patriots had against the Bills.

Horrible Play calling by the Patriots
As a biased Bills fan... I needed this to happened.  I called it out after last week , to come back in 2 weeks and the story line will be shifted again.  The Bills will be in 1st at 9-6 and the Pats will be tied for the Division at 9-6.  As long as the Bills can avoid 50mph winds in New England... feel pretty confident in our passing game + our Defense.  But rain + 50mph winds crush the Bills since we suck at running.
The league or sports outlets outside of Indy still doesn't give the#COLTS the respect they deserve... But that's ok... #COLTS STRONG...
Pats killed themselves in this one. Still gotta give credit to Indy tho
32 for the Patriots u scared to hit
As a pats fan colts deserve this win a great Offensive And Defensive Game By Indi.
Mac”Winston”Jones
Colts national fan please stand up. This is great victory for us.. Jonathan is MVP
Patriots lost to themselves, not the Colts.
If they play in the play offs … PATRIOTS will be the ones with that chip on their shoulder. This is not over. Good intensity by the Colts.  But at the end of the day, they only won by Patriots making uncharacteristic mistakes on special teams — which will be fixed
NE has a slow QB and Kicker.
Thank you Colts!!
Despite the loss, I'm now a full believer in MJ10. Hard time in the first half and really came to play in the second.  Colts played a good game, but the Patriots didn't help themselves with all those penalties
Colts biggest home win in a long time. 🐋🐳🐬
Patriots made so many mistakes and it was still close
Finished like you started Indy Established that run, ex. OL, Defense took a piece of the pie Ended it on a run Great job gentleman
Colts defense came to play in the first half.
Good thing I fell asleep hahahahahaha. Btw that Jonathan Taylor, will be a HOFamer.
The colts definitely worry me going into next weeks Xmas game...Go Cardinals. Should be a good one
Hines is lowkey a starter in n a lot of other teams 🤷🏾‍♂️
Colts has to clean up their defense when they have the lead.
These teams might meet again. Colts better be careful. Anyhow, on to Buffalo.
The colts are going to be tough to contend with in the playoffs
Colts can win a Super Bowl. Obviously they're not the favourites, but they're legitimate contenders
🙏🏼🙏🏼
Love seeing Mac get exposed. Mr Dink and Dunk
Wow Taylor- everyone knew he was getting the ball and he just ran over people
Jones fought himself back after that shaky start.  That's a stamp on that kid's toughness.
I want us to stop slowing the aggression down in the second half of games. It’s how teams came back on us all season. Great win tho boys!! Playoff inbound
85 could’ve got caught that ball for aTD release him for dat
As a Chiefs fan..thank you Colts!!!
carson one handed catch from the center before the end of the first half was pretty fire 🔥
Défense des colts très solides 👏
I really really really wish they had built this team for Andrew luck I promise they wud be Super Bowl bound….
9:19  12:47 what a pair of touchdowns guys , Madonna mia what a player !
2:57 whats no.9 for the pats doing?
Colts!
All right Colts! It's about time someone took down the Patriots. Now if someone can just take the wind out of the Cowboys' sails tomorrow, I'll really be happy. Who are they playing? The Giants? Well, so much for that.
😴😴😴😴😴
13:00 "Will they have enough to finish this game?"  (Immediately on the next play)  "Taylor's gonna finish it!"
the day belicheck decided to draft another qb
Go Colts!!
all those videos that came out last week about MJ being the second coming of TB have just been debunked smh
On his way to becoming the Best rb in nfl history
So many great teams. You could pick 5 teams from each conference that has a shot at making the SB.  1. KC 2. Patriots 3. Ravens 4. Titans 5. Bills  6. Bucs 7. Packers 8. Cardinals  9. Rams 10. Cowboys 11. Colts  In the AFC, I think it will be New England vs Kansas City. In the NFC, I say Bucs vs Packers or Rams.
the last run by taylor my gosh the colts o-line was amazing
Colts defense secured the w
That oline deserved the ball of the game. They were physical and just bulldozed the patriots. I think bill belichick didn’t see how physical this colts team was. The patriots were getting knocked around. Even simple tackles by the colts were harder than the patriots. The defense played hard smash mouth football. Loved to watch that. Especially that colts defense.
3:41 savage moments
Taylor was a monster!!!
Ahh and my “Broken” Chiefs sit atop of the AFC
Worst game from the Pats all season 3 QB sneaks ... Come TF....
Leanard is underrated
Colts played a perfect game on defense
After the Wentz interception i was getting ready to witness another Indianapolis collapse. Looks like FR leaned his lesson about wanting Wentz to be the hero lol
This was one of the best games to watch as a Colts fan in a long time
Jones looking like ass tonight boi, I'm talking straight 🚮🚮
Everyone Says the Colts were so good. Yeah they were in the first halt. But did you saw the 2 half? They mostly chocked this whole game to a 2 half where the pats Played a little bit better but not great. If they want to win with not that high scores between them and the other team they must stop choking in the end of the game.
I miss Wentz as a eagle.. sigh*
Thanks NFL...im enjoying the highlights more with the key play replays🙏
It’s funny how the same people calling the NCAA Football are the same “POLITICS” calling the NFL but when EURO League did the UNITED SNAKES…. When against play.?.?. She they “USA” does the in college and Major leagues
The blocked Punt and the following Touchdown were clearly the Punters fault. It was obvious that there is not enough room left to kick it and that it will be blocked. A good Punter should realize this and react to it. He should never have tried to kick it.
Where are the "nfl is rigged" comments?
JT and the o-line dominated 💪🏼
Jonathan Taylor making that MVP push
Great game Indy. It was good to see Mac Jones bounce back and fight though.  Hope to see a rematch soon.
13:14 that Patriots fan all sad in the middle of Colts fans is priceless
There was something very off with this game. I didn’t even feel like I was watching the patriots
Couldn’t stop the run game
This year has SB rematch written all over it
All these take ways remind me of the legion boom
The colts are basically the Dallas Cowboys of the AFC
Totally forgot this game was on tonight lol looked like a good one! JT is an absolute beast
Games like this is why I love football.
Why is this a 14 minute video
The thumbnail on this video is an absolute violation😭
I never again want to hear a Mac Jones Tom Brady comparison. Brady would not have lost this game. 200 + million spent on new talent too. When did Brady ever get that? So much for the great Bill Belichick. He will not win another Superbowl, mark my words.
( Thank You Colts ) -  From A Chiefs Fan . . . . .
Leonard is a evil robot 🤖
I knew it and guessed right before colts pass defense is dangerous even when they had rivers
Congrats to the underdog Colts for taking it to the Patriots 👍
Mac just is a average qb at best and a system qb he played horrible colts great defense took advantage of the rookie great game colts
Coach 30: Moments too big. Just gonna run along side him and try to reason with him.
Bagsley has been alright but looking forward to getting hot rod back
Mac Jones sucks
the slowest punt ive ever seen  @2:00
Can’t wait to see what the AFC looks like after the last week, these games are so crazy! 🔥🔥
I'm not an expert on football so I ask do you know why punters are so slow to kick the ball?
what happened after 17-20 TD?? onside kick or crazy return??
This is a flashback, at least for me, for those old Baltimore Colts/New England Patriots games of the late 70s
Credit to where it is man gg to the colts and now the pats have to shake this one off asap becuz we got the bills at home again
The mask finally comes off... the pats suck... they're in a easy division and have been incredibly lucky.
Where are all of the people that wanted a Patriots Buccaneers Super bowl? Where are all of y'all at?
Great job colts 👍 bills Mafia needed that. Now we know if bills win Tomm. Next week will be for the division most likely.the door is still opened, let's bust it down buffalo 😠
I don’t put much stock in this game. Odd game on a Saturday in Indy
So this is what the best defense in the league gets you, gives up 27 points to a in the hunt team. Props for the colts derailing the patriots tho, killer performance.
The offensive linemen played a huge factor in this match. No doubt.
How is Taylor in the 70s overall dude is a stud. I wanted the pats to win (chargers fan) so our wildcard wasn’t messed with but dang this preference I can’t be mad about
frank? why didn't your team play this way 3rd quarter against the colts? you should have one more win and be considered even better right now. congrats on the win
Quenton Nelson set that space for jt
Is Carson Wentz the worst starting QB in the NFL right now?? I think between home and Baker Mayfield it’s just sad to watch.
Colts need a quarterback to be a super bowl contender
Jones looked terrible.
Despite his interceptions Mac Jones still kept going and had a good 4rth quarter
Them boys were hittin tonight
Love how this is the game of the year!😅 Colts beating the Pats!!! Reminds me of the 06 AFC championship game.
Man now Mac knows how Derek Carr felt with Agholor just giving up on routes. That has to be infuriating as the QB.
The colts controlled the line of scrimmage with Nelson leading the way, and Leonard being himself on defense. Taylor is an MVP candidate
i think the call that lost the game for the pats was settling for a fg instead of going for a td late in the 4th. that would have made it a 1 score game, and things might have turned out differently. but in the end, the o-line's early struggles were too much to overcome. another blown game from the pats (one could make a case for them only having 1 loss on the year of they didnt make stupid mistakes or bad calls). colts are a team to look out for in january, and hopefully the pats can rebound next week against buffalo
Indianapolis rushed the ball in this game amazingly well... Nobody had done that to the patriots this season..  Carson Wenz is a terrible but terrible passer... He only knows how to hand over the ball to his running backs...  The Colts’ OL and DL with the running game made the Patriots to lose this game but this quarterback the colts have is less than a mediocre passer for the NFL’ standards.
Poor ol' Billy Blaster :(
will you post the full game to youtube please not everyone got a chance to watch it live
Thumbnail is crazy lol but dam the colts look good this year
What a shitgame
The interception in the redzone and blocked punt killed the pats.
J.Taylor should be MVP, that man is a beast. Colts just out played Pats on both side of the ball, Mac Jones was no good against this defense.
2 great running, 2 great defenses, and 2 very average QBs.   Man, the 1st half Mac Jones' Int's really hurt
Felt like Indy ran out the clock for an entire half
Jonathon Taylor’s good but he shouldn’t win mvp he gets yards because he gets blocks that’s a good line every time he don’t get blocks hes stuffed shouldn’t win mvp his line should
I thought pats were winning the Superbowl
That thumbnail is nasty
Great game for Taylor but I think people forgot how the colts defense shut out the pats for 3 quarters
Yeah. I don’t see the dolphins making the playoffs.
I am just here too see all wentz Highlights. Please add  them asap
The last team beat the patriots was the cowboys crazy dat was 7 weeks ago hats off colts good running game
That play is gonna be on nfl top 100 2021
As a chiefs fan, I like to thank the colts💯😊
Jonathan Taylor is the best running back in the league.🔥
And the Patriots fans are gonna cry!!!........
I'm so annoyed that the thumbnail always already tells which team won.....
Colts showed that Patriots and Jones are overhyped!
might as well call them the indy refs. i hate the colts to death.
I guess the Mac Jones Statue is now on hold
I mean if your running right throw with the left .. suggestion
Taylor is in full beast mode, chalk up one for the colts. Love to see the Pats lose 🎶😂😂🤣 and I’m not even a colts fan….🤣🤣🤣🤣
what a game, but are the colts doomed to struggle to lock the win every time , Anyway their rb show in the first half was priceless.
The Colts understood the assignment 😁
Colts  good defense
once michael pittman got out, it was hard for the QB to open up options bc Michael pittman is prolly the man wr for the team
Pats are overrated.
Colts ran through the Patriots like Muhammad Ali beat up on PeeWee Herman👏👏👏🤣 I said the Patriots had not played anyone until they played the Colts!!!!! MAC JONES WHO????
LETS GO COLTS BABY!!
Suggestion: running left throw with the right running right throw left  If you pivot throw in the opposite direction
The colts were galloping all over the pasture tonight. They were kicking and bronco'in their way to victory.
Watching the cheatriots get their teeth kicked in, is one of life’s true pleasure’s. also loved watching bill sulk like a two year old during the press conference.
Potentissimi sto colts
Went on a mission this yr🗣
Didn't expect The Patriots to leave the game with The Colts Horseshoe stuck securely in their butts!!!  I'll bet they don't feel like it's a "Good Luck Charm" 🧿!!! Ouch, that hurt!!!
Two things happened in this game: one, the Pattywhacks had absolutely no answer for JT. And, they had no answer for Quentin. Too bad. Well, Bellychick, well Daddy Mac, it's like this; some days you're the windshield, and some days you're the bug.
I swear if you was to tell me the score without telling me who won, by looking at the stats I would have said the Patriots won again. No way I thought the Colts would've just thrown 12 times. I guess the gave the Patriots a taste of their own medicine
Get To watch Football tomorrow, Monday , Tuesday ,Thursday ,Friday ,Saturday ,Sunday and Monday again!!! That scrazy
Good result for the Colts, they us by playing our game. A few mistakes from us and the colts capped on it. We go again next week, come on you pats!
RB Quentin Nelson is a absolute unit.
That Man Jonathan Taylor Different He Really Slowed Down @13:05 He Coulda BEEN kicked it in Another gear 🤦🏾‍♂️🔥
Great game! A lot of rushing plays and very few passing plays from the Colts! Sounds familiar! Nuff Said!
Michael Pittman lost me fantasy playoffs with 1.7 points don't think I'll recover😒. Wentz overthrew TD bomb then he gets ejected 😔...
What a great thumbnail 😂😂
Good game. We couldn’t match that Colts intensity. Hopefully we meet again in the Playoffs. We’ll be ready then.
WTH Happened Pats!! Still Pat Nation
This has been a really weird season because there just doesn’t seem to be any great teams. You’ve got a bunch of good teams and maybe three really good squads but again no “class” of the league
Imagine Andrew luck with this colts team
Nefarious Buckelnore’s sack sealed the game
Pats need to invest in sum wrs
like I said it before Bellichick"s Defense can't really stop the rum for years
As a pats fan good win for the colts. Patriots looked awful 3 quarters and that cost them.
Looking more and more like the Chiefs are going to the Super Bowl from the AFC.
both those teams would beat the breaks out of the Chiefs, they’re way better
Jonathan Taylor is a star in the making.
Packer fan who believes that former great Wisconsin RB1 deserves the MVP this year. #28 #Taylor
Pat’s can stop the run, and their Qb sucks😂
everyone and their grandmas were so quick to put the patriots up the pedestal LOL. blahhhhh STFU now patriots suck
Carson Wentz needs to stop running the read option haha he isn't Lamar Jackson and he needs to protect that knee
New England  were calling some weird plays and no play action all night long idk what they were doing.
The colts played like the patriots slept with their wife, and took all their money, and tried to get back at them.
Ne will also lose bills game and Dolphins there so fluky they ain't no where near as good as they appear
*This the best NFL season ever.. super unpredictable*
4:52 funny how when Wentz caught the snap it sounded like smashing a goom on Super Mario
Patriots said it ain’t over, but colts said oh yeah it is
Hard knocks has me keeping up with the Colts and I’m not even a Colts fan
While that Colts Defense was the real deal in this game(Is Mac n' Cheese STILL the next best thing?🤔) they cannot afford ANYTHING to happen to JT.
Overrated Jones can't lead. He's been riding that defence all year getting free wins from the Texans panthers jets ect and when they needed him to lead he couldn't get it done. Sit down boy 🤣
Man, the colts defense has some hard hitters!!
he said are they going to finish this game 2 seconds later Taylor is going to finish this  game
lol f u Mac Jones and PATS
Taylor is a beast
Its always nice to see a star like Jonathan Taylor be down to block for his teammates
Colts got rlly lucky, patriots just kept on shooting themselves on the foot way too many unnecessary penalties from errors, credits for JT he's a beast
I knew colts were going to beat them new England might have a Decent record but they really haven't beaten any real good teams and the bills game was a fluke I bet they get knocked out first round of playoffs
All colts did was show bill their best plays lol everyone knows bill is gonna put up a master plan and destroy the colts in the playoffs
First game I’ve watched of this Mac Jones kid. He looked pretty terrible. His numbers look crappy too for a so called ROY. Guess I’m missing something.
And somehow all sports channels espn etc won’t talk about how great the colts did only how bad the patriots performed.
The Cheaters Lose. Sweet!!!
mac jones literally gave the patriots a chance. its feel likes the coaching from mcdaniels holding back jones potential,  mcdaniels isnt the guy everyone overhypes to be, he does some idiotic play calling at times, like he did a HB toss on 3rd and long yesterday, also get him some receivers, they make too much mistakes, the only good one is bourne tbh and he’s less used out of them three, and its time to give nkeal some reps, he showed his ASU style yesterday, the patriots just don’t know how to use him.
Phillip Rivers would have the colts inn top 3 seed in AFC if he was still playing
Great win for the colts, JT & Nelson where Amazing. But as for Mac jones and the pats better luck next week
Patriots got beat at their own game
Somewhere the incredible hulk is looking at j Taylor like, "damn boy got some thighs.”
Can we stop pretending that Jonathan Taylor would be the league’s leading rusher behind an average offensive line?  If you’re wondering why RBs are rarely selected as MVP, that’s one reason why. They rely even more on the O-line than the QB because they need blocks, not just protection.
How crazy is it that Mac Jones is already a better QB than Carson Wentz?
How do the games stay good? Nfl having a great season
Nice little sound effect at 4:53
I cringe every time Wentz runs the ball and takes contact. That dude is injury-prone.
Me: I wonder who won the game today  *see’s the thumbnail* Me: Oh word
Why didn't he tackle Jonathon Taylor on that TD in the end? He let him score smh rigged smh vegas in on it also. I wish it wasn't rigged.
I love seeing the cheaters lose.
Legends have it that the entire Patriots team will be running tomorrow at practice
To bad Taylor isn’t a Kansas City chief
Colts are lucky they didnt gave away this game game it looked like it for the whole 3rd quater I wouldn't be celebrating in those locker room
Kc chiefs first place in AFC!!
So are the chiefs gonna take the first round bye and the first seed again?
JT for mvp McCaffrey and Barkley injury prone their both done.
Good game Colts hopefully we can get a rematch in the AFC Conference Championship game.
10:27 i like that energy from mac jones!
Colts is winning the AFC
THAT WAS A BAD DAY.EVERY TEAM LOST .
The colts are gonna be a problem if they get to the playoffs... they're playing with that underdogs mentality
Wish the Colts were in the AFC East so we can see this twice a year.   Again why are the Colts in the AFC south and the Dolphins in the East?
Colts didn’t win this game, the Pats lost this game. So many turnovers isn’t normal for Pats. Good Job done by Colts for capitalizing.
Thanks Indy! Just need a Pittsburgh win tomorrow or a 49er win on Thursday.
When I played football in high school, my freshman year I got to see Nyhiem Hines run all over my varsity teams defense, the kid was insane. My dad and I have called it the "Garner Toss" because literally every play was a toss sweep to Hines and he would break away for a touchdown run every time he got the ball. He was also an amazing return specialist and its awesome to see him take what he did in high school and do it in the pros.
Come on nfl, we want to see the fight!!!! At least we would have something entertaining unlike the football that you guys are ruining with all you dumb rules every year....
Shows when Patriots have to rely on Jones throwing the ball they can’t win.
13:16 the guy in the patriots jersey looks so sad lol
El fan número 1 mundial de Jonathan Taylor hoy es Jose Antonio Ponseti
Neither Wentz nor Mahomes are really good but their teams are really good overall this year
wentz is still so bad.
The run game is key to winning in December!!!
The Colts had beaten every AFC East team this season
That was fun!
I love my Pats, but our team is trash
The thumbnail 😂😂😂
How was Okereke able to do that without the Acrobat ability?
Jonathan Taylor Is An Absolute Superstar
“O-Kay-ra-Kay” for Okereke smh do your research
Look at Taylor's blocking too wow
i bet that billy boy misses tommy boy now
Colts are like the Titans if they had Derrick Henry
The  Colts  don't  play  like  7 and  6 team.
Leonard’s stiff arm on Meyers omg
SO  SHWEEEETTT...much  love  Tee with  LIONS  NAMED LEO.[the music  worldwide}  oooweee  GREAT  GAME..
The Colts did to Belichick what Belichick did to Bills 2 weeks ago. Expect Bills had many chances to win but Patriots were basically behind the whole game by 2 or 3 positions.
Thanks colts that win might gift the chiefs the one seed if we hold now
Bill Billick got black eyes today and Mac Jones played like a rookie?? I bet on Buffalo next time week.
The Colts basically played the Patriots the way the Patriots played the Bills
Taylor was scary.  But Jones. Some of those throws. His future might be as scary as Brady’s.
Big Mac was on the menu tonight for the colts!!!! Colts played good tonight!!!
NFL Postponed a game for the Patriots and Patriots still lost....
That pic and stuff arm tho nasty 🤢🔥🔥🔥
Mac Jones is Brady'esque eh?
Why was this played today instead of tomorrow?
My predictions, Pats lose to Buffalo, beat the Jags, and God knows what happens against the Phins, as they are mirror images of each other, and it is a division game
NFL wrong for the thumbnail
Patriots vs. Jonathan Taylor Week 15 Highlights
Omg I forgot colts got Wentz 😳
13:04 I think that’s easily in the top five of loudest I’ve ever heard a crowd get in an NFL stadium.
⬅️🏃💨 Taylor!
Pats d celebrating sacks when they are down 20 - 0. What joke.
The Colts are a much better team than their record suggests.
COLTS NATION 💯✊🏾🙏🏾
So glad the pats lost, can't stand folks saying their elite, they arent.
- “Taylor is going to finish it.”
The Pats got exposed for the frauds they are
Honestly the wentz slander is so crazy to me. The patriots have allowed an average of 113 passing yard in their last 3 outings… arguably the best passing defense in the nfl as of right now. The colts have a weapon named Jonathan Taylor and Frank is finally starting to utilize him. Sure, wentz could have had a much more productive night, but why would they not chose to put the ball in the hands of their best offensive weapon? The colts offense is finally starting to fall in line and all people want to do is take jabs at wentz 🤦🏼‍♂️ when will people realize that he’s an above average QB? When will eagles fans accept the fact that Philadelphia just grossly mismanaged him and had it out for him when then never put any offensive weapons next to him? It’s crazy, he’s been nothing but good for Indy and he’s a key piece to the offense.
Jonathan Taylor is the real league MVP.
The colts defense had a fire lit underneath them. They beat up the patriots.
I’m HE Man of the Year - Memphis Lee
It’s great to see Jonathan Taylor run the football especially when you consider how much the game has changed from running the football to throwing the football down the field for deep passes.
Time of year when we separate the men from the boys.
Greg Olsen is a damn good commentator
Mac jones overrated
Jonathan Taylor was on fire in this game. He played great. He carried the Colts to a tremendous victory.
Dear lord, the Pats need a Q-back
"Meyers had a chance to make the catch, probably should have done so..." is the stupidest comment I've EVER HEARD.
1:11 one of my favorite plays I’ve seen in a while
Why is there an NFL game on saturday? Can some one explain
Colts are good in weather even though they are a dome team. Some say because Irsay has them play with the top open a lot. Personally I think it is because they are physical and have a great running game with JT.
This is why I went to bed. I knew we'd lose this. WTF BB.
Nice game.. This really a hot game i love it.. 🥰
Wow, was not expecting a one sided game by the underdog not so much in favor leading in. Taylor was a bit of a ball hog though, give someone else a chance here and there?
11:07 when you playing madden but instead of picking fg block you pick cover 2 man
JT did this to Patriots 🤣🤣 Patriots knew the run was coming, their mothers knew the run was coming but they couldn’t stop it. 😂😂😂
People forget that wentz was mvp type player 😂  with a great oline and great running back...if the defense was alil better then they superbowl ready forsure
the cartoon drawings of the players are so cringe
nice job indianapolis taylors
You colts D is nothing to be played with. They are on some Saitama level death hits. Also Mac Jones fast ball is NASTY I love it.
These two teams are so similar but so different to the rest of the league, good qb's for when they need to throw it but mainly they just use their run game and their defense is their main strength, such a nice game and win for the colts
I think most knew before the game but for sure now Colts should  make it in The postseason.
Colts is ah decent lil team but what makes them bad is when they let up leads like they almost did tonight
Fitting end to the game. Taylor was a one man wrecking ball. Strange that the Pats won last week on the running game and this week the running game beat them. That's why they play the games every week.
Where was Michael Pittman Jr?
Just like I said. I’m cursing the Colts
Taylor best rb in Nfl
God I hate the Patriots with a fiery passion. Can’t stand all the dirty plays and the way they play. If they’re lucky to make the playoffs, somebody get their plane ready for a first round exit #overrated #exposed
Great performance by the Colts
colts almost blew that😡😡 thank god we have JT🤓
Carzon wents sucks big time. But hats off to jt28 and the D
Colts still need a QB. Wentz was awful
My only reason to come here is to laugh at how wrong barstool sports advisors were each week...
This is better then a linemen running the ball !
whoever is commentating this game is killing it
What a game
The colts would be a super bowl team with out wentz
Well if this game doesn't respark the rivalry idk what will.
Colts are a team that no body wants to play, they can play in any weather, and they are a dome team.
Free money. COLT WINNING SUPER BOWL.
何回インターセプトされるんだよwww
Colts fans need to pray every night for Taylor’s health. This guy is doing everything for that offence.
The Colts bullied the Patriots.
Love the refs let em hit out there tonight! Some good licks out there that I thought a flag would be thrown on 😅
Let's go colts, defense carried
Is this the first time Indy has beaten New England since Peyton left?
Just gave the pats a taste of there own medicine tonight
LOVE this thumbnail lmao
It’s sad that people still think these games are real
Pittman dropped some
Carson played his part
Ahí están sus patriotas de cartón!😂😂
Patriots threw the ball that's why they lost
That 4th down field goal should have played for the 6 points. Bellyshits is an idiot.
Lol @ Steve Smith in the half time show trying to walk back his support of the patriots..."I told you" only thing you told us was you backed the wrong horse (or Colt)
I didn’t watch the game but from what I’ve heard from others . The colts did quite a bit of headhunting
I like how the COITS  are hitting hard between the third quarter in the fourth quarter
Now if the colts had an actual quarterback under center theyd be able to make a deep playoff run, but sadly not like this. Also taylor for mvp. Hes fast, strong and elusive, the perfect RB
Lmao they typing mack jones trash ass up too much 😂 dude sucks
Buy week kills the team resting 💯💯💯
Finally, some good news this morning! Way to go Colts!
Before this game some people said the patriots are the best team in the AFC but I never really understood that and I'm not surprised that they lost this game
9:29 Why does Hunter Henry look like a tight end Tom Brady?
Now the bills - patriots game is deciding for the division (after the bills beat panthers ofc)
Didn’t watch the game live but by the looks colts are lucky to come away with this one
Finally a Team not scared to play hard !!!
We're 1000% losing to the colts and chargers..... Gahdammit man! At this point we're lucky if we even beat the browns or the broncos RN4L but man......  it's so hard to be a Raiders fan So gahdamn hard
Big bad patriots got a good ole ass whoopin
Colts Patriots rivalry might be reincarnated.
Everybody is running Michigan sweep plays now does anybody besides me notice this.
Thank you Colts. ~a Chiefs fan
MAC JONES IS A FRAUD
ok, now colts as an eagles fan, lose out, lose out, lose out, we have your 1st now, lost put, lose out lose out.
I'm glad Mac's rookie season is shaping up to be a hard-fought one. It's really going to mold him into an even greater player.
As a colts fan is to end winning streaks hmm
Carson Wentz is still a scrub
Always good to watch the Pats lose.
If you watched Taylor at UW, you could tell he'd be a great Professional.
Imagine how good the colts would be if they actually had a good QB....
FTP!
That Colts defense is fun to watch.
As a colts fan for the past 25 years, this felt like a afc championship game I was crying tears of joy after JT scored the last touchdown. After 10+ years of being beaten by the Patriots this felt so good 😭😭😭. Good game non the less
This one is for Ryan Kelly's son🙏
Shows mike jones stinks smh loll
the juju commercial makes me wanna throw a semi and a grandma
FOR THE 1ST TIME ALL YR,the refs called an even game and a REAL team beat the NFL'S CHOICE for AFC representative of the Suoer Bowl,congratulations from a DIE HARD RAIDERS FAN ON BEATING THE CORRUPT NFL
Taylor plays like a young zeke
Colts are in good motion, bright future this year
Wentz isn't a top 10 QB but he is underrated.
Can you imagine mac Jones on the jags or jets he would be terrible
Yo what happened to N’keal Harry?
People need to get off of this kid's sack. He reminds me of Tony Romo. Lots of carelessness outside of the pocket. Keep patenting nonsense instead of studying film and winning games. #gopats
I love JT, but as we’ve seen giving RBs insane workloads only lasts for a little bit until they get injured. As we’ve seen from CMC and Henry.
More power for the COLTS. I,m glad new England lost.😂
The Dolplin is The bess ja ja ja Tua MBP
HAHAH THE PATRIOTS ARE FRAUDS
Miami Dolplin ja ja ja ja ja Tua tua MBP
@Nyheim hines is a good fantasy pick,,
A Saturday game 🤔?
Dolplin Miami jelou
So put some good defense and a little bit of pressure and the pats arent so tough. I hope teams are writing this down lol
I hate that my chiefs took Clyde Edwards Helaire instead of Jonathan Taylor.
It's great the Colts brought back down to earth Jones, and making him look like the rookie that he is.
@Jonathan taylor finished off the pats comeback attempt with a clinching 67-yard TD,, turn the table on New England
Colts offense: a lead??? Nah let’s make it interesting
Mr. Taylor is a special kind of talent
the AFC playoff race will be crazy this year again browns,Steelers,bengals,broncos,raiders all looking for spots the Dolphins are done they blew it already even if they go 10-7 we need a lot of teams to lose it’s almost impossible
The Hines touchdown looked like the last play in Remember The Titans
A game the colts had to have
If you was watching the game from start colts shouldve won 38-0(missed badgley kick). You know the NFL ain't making Belicheck look that bad. 💯
Titans fans are happy 😊
KEEP SLEEPING ON THE COLTS
9:48 this is why the Colts don’t let Carson throw
Patriots just ain't the same without Brady. I just don't get why they didn't re-sign and keep Brady who's a superstar.
Bring Matt Jones Down 👎🏽👇🏼 to Earth.. The NFL Doesn't Discriminate,  it's Not a Field Trip Buddy😬😲🤬💪🏾
Colts started hitting a lot harder after Pittman got ejected
Taylor is a beast at RB 🔥
Running Game is Dominant 💥 and Phenomenal and Gutty as Well 👍🏽‼️
8:55 the nfl needs to check this cause the Colts are paying the refs
the patriots got bullied by a more talented and physical team
Always good to see the Patriots get embarrassed on national television.
170 rushing yards for Johnathan Taylor. What a great player. The Patriots’ 7 game winning streak ends. First loss to the Colts since 2009.
8:11 "As the game gets chippy" comment from the third row.."Chippy?"  Guess it goes the current NFL contact touch football. Miss those football glory days when it was all out war and games were scores like 14 to 10.
The Patriots have proven themselves to be a good team, but they don't really have an X-Factor on offence. Damien Harris was out, and that mattered a bit, but I don't think that would have really mattered. The Colts Played hard and smart, they'll be a problem if they can sneak into the playoffs
looks at the stats people and schedule colts have had the toughest season out of every team look at the scores the stats if they had Browns schedule they be undefeated look at anybody colts have their number just wait next season will be infamous
Johnathan...Taylor....DAMN..I'm not a Colts fan, but I'm definitely a J.T.T. fan...hahaha! Why is he not in the M.V.P. discussion?
Lost To The Colts 😂😂😂😂
At 13:03, you can hear the entire state of Indiana collectively cream it's pants.
can’t wait to see Flights reaction to this😂
Why was this game on a Saturday?
Am I the only one that didn’t know there was a game yesterday?
Let's see what all the "experts" that picked the Patriots have to say Sunday morning. Keep 🍆 riding the Patriots.
This is Wentz when you give him a run game!
#jakobjohnson 💪🇩🇪
Loudest ive ever heard lucus oil,wasnt even a 5th as loud during the comeback against the cheifs.
I dont get the 4th and goal FG. you needed two touchdowns not a FG and a TD, WTH was that?
I despise the Colts, what a terrible game to watch.
That stiff arm by Leonard was DISRESPECTFUL 😂 4:23
No one is happier about this than coach bill
Patriots lost this one with bonehead mistakes…. And still were a couple plays away from winning on the road.
Thank you Colts. Sincerely, Chiefs Kingdom...
I wish Mac Jones was the colts QB..would really elevate the team. Especially with our talented receivers
Colts finally have a run game after so many years
bro taylor fast ash gyat
It's like the Pat's timing was off this whole game or had bad internet connection and were lagging lol just not their day, gg indi
Not impressed at all with Jones this game. . the few big plays in the air were more of a great catch by the WR over a great throw. . not to mention the horrible interceptions. maybe its time people start to tap the breaks on his bandwagon.
not why Pats tried to throw the ball instead of running it but it was a hard fought game anyway
Russell Wilson and Ciara had a baby, and his name is Jonathan Taylor. The pr guy is full time baby sitter
Thank you!!!   - Chiefs Organization
When you have an all around great team your QB doesn't have to put up crazy numbers. Colts are showing the league that it's always been a team effort and the QB position is over glorified.
great news for the chiefs
Who's here is the Chiefs fan??
Thanks colts great game
I don't think the pats are as good as everyone thinks
8:30 the throw in madden u call fake 😂
Indianapolis must not know how to throw passes.
Colts came big here. Could have went better but a W is a W. All these players have come a long way and JT is just something different.
Bills be like that’s how it feels to lose with less than 50 passing yards
Watch out for the colts!
that thumbnail goes hard
Let’s go Colts! JT for MVP
Pats been overrated
And I picked the Colts to win
As a Colts fan during the Manning era, I can tell you NO fanbase hates the Patriots as much as Colts fans. Yes, the Patriots beat several teams durimg their many Super Bowl runs. But if it wasn’t for them we know how many Super Bowls the Colts would have attended. Indianapolis is a smaller market so it gets glossed over a lot, but it was obvious that Indy fans showed up for this game. I’ve rarely heard Lucas Oil be so loud for any game. They wanted this game as much as the players.
Thank for the 1st rounder and relief from Wince's bloated salary... Enjoy the 50 yards passing, fumbles, picks and sacks upcoming in the one n don playoff game in a few weeks.... Lol
As you see... You need start wide outs to win these days. Bill lol
wentz threw 12 passes… didnt pass for more then 100 yards and they won. patriots clearly suck… cant do nothing on offense… chiefs #1 defense last 7 weeks… and offense is starting to look unstoppable… try beating the chiefs throwing fewer than 100 yards. ppl debating wether or not PATS beat CHIEFS. not even close. THIS IS A JOKE!
The Colts shock everyone what a solid win
The whole colts team is good, except for the QB.
Im a charger fan and I thank the colts for taking money badger
I think it's between Taylor and Mac Jones for ROY
Its always a good day whenever a boston team loses....😊
The Colts swept their old division, the AFC East... 4 - 0
I loved Jonathan Taylor light it up for my Wisconsin Badgers 💪💪 and seeing him thrive with the Colts makes me chant MVP-MVP!
Meyers shouldn't of taunted Leonard like that. Then maybe he wouldn't of gotten stiff armed back to the 6th grade.
So on that punt block, why was that not a flag ruffing the kicker? The guy that blocked it ran into the kickers leg.
All I got to say is I been a Indy fan for more than 20 + years that was a good win but Carson Wentz is Trash 🗑️ and all of history I have never seen a running back have more yards than a quarterback
KANSAS CITY CHIEFS THE BEST TEAM IN THE AFC THEY WINNING THE SUPERBOWL
Pats got a taste of their own medicine...couldn't stop the run even when they knew it was coming lmaoo
Mac played well. Having about 250 more passing yards than Wentz. Did Damian Harris play this game for the Pats? Anyways. Taylor is a beast! Edited: I did not know Mac had some bad picks. He didn’t play well today.
That cover picture is just straight disrespectful 💀
love your comment, like a video 7ame.  certainly true.  wonderful
I said this when the pats let the titans rush for 270 yards with 2nd string RB's that you cannot have a good defense if you cant stop the run.....
13:05 hes staring at him full speed?! thats cold
For the comparison makes Tom Brady never would have made that sweet sweet throw to darius leonard. Also how about Mac Jones now looks slower than 44 year old Tom Brady😂😂😂
Colts certainly have the potential to go far in the playoffs. Just give it to JT man.
JT ran laps around a defense that heavily focused his team’s run game. Insane productivity for him today, Colts got themselves a real one.
VIVA SEAHAWKS
God loves you come to him and repent
Taylor is a problem coming from a pats fan I knew we wouldn’t stop him
I'm a MJ10 fan and I believe he will win a SB one day but no 🧢 he sold tf outta this game.
Remember those people saying how all the other teams are scared of the Pats? Funniest joke I heard all year lol
As a bills fan thank you. We’ll take care of them next time
Weird seeing the Colts transition into a running team, but damn is Taylor a beast
JT is MVP!!!
JT is just an unbelievable player. He   can do it all.
Check down Jones needs to play be Tter
Jonathon Taylor is getting lots of touches these days. I hope he can stay healthy for years to come
That big Taylor run was just a twist of the knife. My Pats looked to have some spark left late in the game, but Taylor is just unstoppable.
a game happened today on a saturday????
Best name ever haha. EJ Speed
Muy embarrasso Patriotios con pokito corazón
Jonathan Taylor from Heisman candidate to the Best RB this season
Taylor & Wentz !!! Love the colts !!! Just can't watch Brady any more ...
Colts fans are happy 😂😂😂 ,  guess they forgot about that time Blount ran all over them in the AFC Championship game 😂😂😂.
Once again the Patriots have another game filled with missed opportunities and mistakes. The defense played a decent game.  But too many 4th down conversations Giving up a blocked punt  The Red Zone int And the on top of that penalties at the worst times.  Patriots fought back hard but it was already too late and Jonathan taylor just built different. I am happy to see Mac Jones Playing we’ll all things considered
Huge Game For The Colts!! They Needed That One. They Looked Strong And Played Well.
Colts let pats come back. But glad pats got humbled and that dink and dunk Jones
NFL makes a 14 minute video but cant show the 30 second pushing match in the middle of the 3rd lol
Mac Jones can't carry a team coming from behind. He'll get a pass this year since he's a rookie but he already reached his ceiling
Any game where Patriots lose is a good one ☝️
I was watching this game live the whole time. There was a lot of missed calls in the colts but the patriots were pretty out of it today. I feel the several false start penalties should have been challenged as they were caused by the colts defense
that thumbnail is my heart as a pats fan. we got a durability check this game. ggs to the colts and their fans.
Gotta love that thumbnail 😂
I just really knew the Colts would win this game, I don't know why when I am a 49ers fan but I'm really happy for Carson Wentz he reminds me of Alex Smith in the Singletary days for some reason.
Im sad that JonnyT is on the Colts, but i knew they would win this game. Did anyone in the media predict this win?
This is exactly how the bills are gonna get back on top of the afc east, their gonna lose against them next week I'm calling it
If not for that fall away run touchdown, the Patriots might still have the chance at the game and the Colts kicker will get his worst game.
When I saw Jonathan Taylor play at Wisconsin, I  knew right away he would become a star in this league. And he’s still exceeding my expectations!
To hell with New England
I think Johnathan Taylor hit the top 5 running back list. Maybe top 3. Dude is a beast.
JT🔥🔥🔥
Colts vs Chiefs AFC championship game.
The cover photo for the highlight was lit 🔥😭😍😍
The throw from Mac at 8:26 is by far one of the best throws I've seen this year. Damn son, you got some balls.
Carson wentz for 58 yards in whole game? I never see any QB went less than 100 yards before.
Such a disrespectful thumbnail.....        I love it
Why yall attacking Wentz he has only threw 6 ints  this yall don't talk about how he passed better passing rating then mosts of qbs rn so out a lil respect On he was the reason the eagles got to the super bowl even tho he got injured I'm not a wents fan by no means but come on man
Pats lose with just 5 passes from Wentz
Thank you colts! Man I never thought I’d say that…
Jonathon Taylor = Daddy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Haha this is what happens when you play a real team. Pats have been getting free wins from the Texans panthers jets ect. Dink and dunk Jones couldn't ride the defence this time 😂 overrated 🤡
Colts end the Pats winning streak with a tactical running game and great defence.....
Pendejo leading w his head smh 🤦‍♂️ teach this man how to tackle
Patriots’ defense man, idk what was going on there
CHIEEEEFFSS
Colts gave the Pats a taste of their own medicine from what the pats did to the Bills last week. Bad news is that Pats will steal a few of these running plays in the playoffs bc Mac Jones cant win on his own slinging the ball - TBD. Bc MAc Jones basically has the velocity of a HS girl when throwing the ball. Its like slow motion when the Colts intercepted the pass to the Flats but sadly its Not. Oh its true, its True!
Almost blew that game. But they were smart enough to take the ball out of Wentz's hands and put it in JT's.
No one is saying it so I will. Were all forgetting about how we jumped OFFSIDE when the kicker missed his field goal. The game potentially goes too OT.
Im not a patriots fan by any means but that second or third to last drive by Mac Jones was kinda icy for how he was playing in the first half.
Brian Burns "  HOWS THE PAIN MAC? CANT BREAK THEIR ANKLES MAC? lol
It is so rare to see Patriots beat themselves! But Taylor is a beast!
The thumbnail is top of the line disrespectful
GG Colts. The NFL is a game of inches and the Colts made the big plays this time. Excited for the Bills-Patriots game next week
12:59 "Will they have enough to finish this game?"..... "Taylors gonna finish it!"
What what won the game for Indianapolis was when the running back for the colts got a touchdown that ended the game with only 2 minutes left it was too late that's what happened and that was good
Patriots look better when they throw it 3 times a game
Weren't the best INTs but Mac showed his mental strength tonight. Easily could've folded but came back & made it a game. Love the chemistry he has with Henry.
Fraud Jones showed all we needy to see 😂😂
Pat's defense better get better! lol
Mac only looked at one receiver and all of the sudden became inaccurate?
Can't come out that flat vs a team in a must win game. Shocking how sloppy NE was coming off a bye. Handed IND the game.
colts played hard tonight and really gave the patriots a wake up call to their run defense, and mistakes with penalties, their running game is insane and they exposed the patriots defensive weakness, props to mac jones tho for being out there as a rookie and fighting until the clock hit zero, pats need better playcalling as well, they have the best rookie qb and only let him have 10 attempts in the first half
Colts defense played well.
How in the Hell is the Colts coming into this Game 7-6 when their playing this Good u would think they be at least a 10-3 team the Colts are really Dangerous that O line arguibly the best O line in the league
That thumbnail is dirty. That man has a family y'all.
1:05 Taylor in the wild cat and makes the big block for Hines
Some really hot games in the past week. As cold weather kicks in the NFL's only getting hotter n hotter 🔥
wow jonathan taylor 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Haha Mac Jones is a bum let's go colts shut down the over hyped Pats Go Bucs
How ironic, the Patriots won their last game with Mac completing only 2 or 3 passes and then they proceed to loose their next game against a QB that only completed only 5 passes, yikes.
Defense was lights out, JT grinded out yards. Let's see how ppl spin this in to a Carson Wentz win
This game was a pre playoff environment.- that's why it turned out the way it did.
I wanna see titans v colts playoff if Henry is back
Damn it Pittman only picked up 1.7 points for me in fantasy lol
The way the colts are playing they could be in the superbowl
It's a shame the colts have this great defense but no QB. Imagine if luck was still playing? We talking bout SB contender here
haha nothings better than slapping the patriots
Will Wentz ever be given a reliable elite deep ball receiver? Six years in and neither team he's been with has had that for him.Campbell.....gone almost all the time.When he was with the Eagles it was the same thing.He had DeSean Jackson for only about one game and threw him two 50+ yd TD's.Colts do need to do what they're doing now because of that... they're mostly running ball or playing very balanced pass/run
4:25 Darius Leonard intercepts and stiff arms Myers. Colts were the physical team
MaC JOneS iS tHE NexT TOm BrADY! - absolute morons
Pats will finish 10-7 and Mac Jones is going to get embarrassed in the one road playoff game they will play. Bill is nothing without Tom. Bill will never win a superbowl as a HC without Tom. TB12  is the Patriot way. That's facts and nobody can argue it
Bottom line, don't get down 2 scores against the Colts. They can run the damn ball. Now, if you get up 2 scores on them, and you avoid their excellent punt block schemes, they have to rely on Wentz and passing.
That’s crazy that punt/fumble was good cause the kicker got Laid out 😭😂…
Thank you colts for beating the pats to give the chiefs that 1 seed!! 😍
Bill may make it back to the Super Bowl someday without Master Brady. But not this year, & the clock is tickin.
I have to admit I didn't know the Colts had such a running game like they did tonight in their play book. The AFC is anybody's this year. I'm not sold on the Chief's at all not that I like them because I don't. This season has been crazy.
Now we see why belicheck runs the ball soo much 😂😂.
Mac Jones has a weak arm lol I guess it gets the job done but watch him throw
The colts r my second favorite team. Mainly because of Jonathan Taylor and I also really like Kenny Moore
They damn near killed the patriots
Anybody remember them Nintendo 64 Madden games???  John Madden- "You keep running the football and it wears down the defense and then BAM you knock'em out late in the game with a long touchdown run" The Colts ain't no joke. That defense has been tops in the league for a couple years now and JT and Wentz are both solid players that can more than fulfill their roles at their position.
JT is undeniably the best RB in the NFL.  BUT…is Indy leaning on the RB wayyyy too much??
Give the Colts credit they are good.  You gotta love Mac Jones though. He is already great as a rookie. Pretty amazing that once again Chicago passed on another future Hall of famer.
Look at all the chiefs comments 😂 daddy's coming
HYPE
I feel like that punter took 1 too many steps
I hope colts v pats can become a heated rivalry again
I just don’t get the Colts play calling, when you have a star who could pound the ball why do you keep throwing on 1st and 2nd down geesh. Give Taylor the freaking ball.
Sorry to be a downer... but if anything this game proved the Pats were overrated with a quality D and the Colts are extremely flawed with Wentz at QB. I don't see either team making past the wildcard round of the playoffs (if they even make it to the playoffs).
Being a life long Patriots fan, I wasn't one on hype going around lately that the Pats are the team to beat in the AFC. They have limitations and were exposed by the Colts tonight. I still think it's the Chiefs to beat in the AFC. I am happy though that we're back as competitive team though
and people thought the patriots were sooo good😂
Just ruined my FanDuel 🤦🏿‍♂️
Carson wentz that dude
Colts on defense channeling bob sanders boys can hit
Pats had 99 consec games where they scored in the first half lead the nfl.. Now back to 0 love it.
I’m gonna have to buy a Jonathan Taylor jersey pretty soon the way he’s carrying me in fantasy rn
Stop the patriots win streak
N.F.L stands for national fixed league.
Pats took smth of their own medicine. Good special teams an physical run game by the colts.
Kc fan thanks colts jt so beast 💪
we beat both of them laaaaa la lol
Love with the cheaters get roughed up .. always
How many Colt's fans said quietly to themselves before the game... “I don't give a fk about Christmas, the playoffs, just beat the fkn Pats!”?  😅
That thumbnail disrespectful 😂
BRUH just when I thought we was on to something we lose stilll #NEFL
Yeah New England is no threat
New England Who?
Not Mac Jones best game
Having Jonathan Taylor and Derrick Henry in the league is so fun. The absolute domination they bring to a game is a site to see. Athletes making other world class athletes look like children.
JONATHAN TAYLOR!
Haha Belichick
Colts swept tha east go indy
This hurts the Bills surprisingly, but glad to see the division leader lose.
Why the hell did the Pats kick a field goal down 14 with less than 10 min on the clock from inside the 10 when you know Taylor and Wentz can grind the clock? Dumb.
YOU CANT HIDE YOUR QUARTERBACK NEW ENGLAND!
these two teams are bound to give u problems any given week
Colts nation 💪🏾🔵⚪️ respect us! But damn if only we could start our seasons like this instead of making last minute playoff pushes lol
Jonathan Taylor is a monster 👹.  Something about Wisconsin RBs..
GGs. Colts. Ya'll deserved that game more than us. That was a game that represented all the struggles the other Rookie QBs we're having. Mac hasn't been having those problems because he's on a team who knows how to use them, doesn't have him play hero right away, has a good D and keeps a lead. When New England was down early most of it wasn't Mac's fault. But then when they had to lean on him he threw 2 picks. But unlucky the other Rookie QBs, he did everything in his power to bring the team back and nearly succeeded.
Patriots fans said their defense will stop the colts running gaming 😂😂😂
Bill Burr went to the game Lmao
Lmao this was the colts Super Bowl. Let’s be real guys. Colts will be second in the afc south and when they travel to Foxborough the outcome will be different. Carson wentz completed 5 passes in a dome . Imagine in a cold out weather. Not to mention the playbook is easy when it comes to the colts. Just ask manning against pats in Foxborough
I’m not one to normally have animosity towards an organization but umm… Hold this L pats, for all the pain my childhood has endured due to you guys and Tom brady, hold this L and wear it proud. Colts nation baby!
Just once I'd like to know a team can maintain a blowout against Brady or Belicheck. It's like you just know they're going to come back no matter what the score is.
Now all the shows analyst gonna talk bad about the Patriots what's wrong with them, thay gonna talk bad about them, after winning7 straight
Seeing the pats lose does put a smile on my face
I love ❤️ it I hate the Patriots .yeah!!!!!!!
Tua's backup had a good game minus the 2 interceptions...
Wish Hightower didn’t overrun the gap on that JT 67 yard TD 🤦🏾‍♂️ @13:00
That stiff arm 💪😳
Patriots are frauds
What ever happen to the Brady way.,, I mean patriot way
It's me or the next play off will be the best in a long time? 🤔
Pats got beat by they owm game running the ball
I feel like I was the olny 1 who knew the colts were going to win
Pats needed this L…. On to Buffalo! Let’s go!!!! #PatsNation
Patriots lost to a team that completed 5 passes…in a dome.  228 yards rushing by the Colts, 57 yards passing.  Just got dominated physically and couldn’t stop the Colts from running it.  this sounds oddly familiar.
13:17 that lone Patriots fan LMAO
Jonathan Taylor already better than  PPP (Privileges Playing with Peyton)undeserving Hall of Famer Edgerin James. I said what I said.
Good thing Madden Uktimate Team player of the week is on hold. JT would be getting his 3rd card
This is the type of energy Joe buck needs to bring. I will celebrate his retirement. It’s a crime he announces for the MLB as well.
Fire Belichik tonight!
What we've learned the last couple weeks... Anyone can beat anyone. NFC or AFC. This year is all over the board. Only things we know for sure. Don't bet against Rogers, don't count out the 49ers, get your popcorn ready for any remaining cheifs games and Jones is one hellova rookie.
Mac did not fold in a tough environment.  He will learn from this.
Patriots are about to hand the the Bills the Division on a silver platter.
Flight finna flip
That should’ve been a TD. But what a COKTS OL!!!!!!!
Gotta give credit to Indy , they played phenomenal game, JT is a great back 💯 next week gonna be very important vs Buffalo #letsgopats
JT for MVP
Dont worry pats fan.  Brady will let you banwagon the Bucs :)
Colts jammed the ball down NE throat
As a Patriots fan, the Colts are going to be dangerous come playoff time.
That’s my team let’s go colts !
The colts are better than their record shows
The Colts used the same formula the Patriots did against the Bills.  Run it down their throats.  Wentz was just a manager and hand the ball off.  Colts fans get worry when he throws because he just might throw the game away.
U need a strong running game in December
Good.  Always glad to see belicheck lose.
Good game plan going in today but we can’t rely on beating team with Carson wentz not being able to make some throws
give the colts their props!! nelson is a damn monster!
Damn Colts did well. Props to them from a Rams fan. Would be surprised if they go all the way.
Great defense by Indy! And JT is still putting every other RB on notice and challenging any defense in front of him. This dude will run full speed straight through ANYONE! Best back in the NFL 🤷‍♂️ No bias here, obviously
Jonathan Taylor, just turned it on when it mattered most
Sad offensive lineman get no love Quentin Nelson was an absolute stud this game. I think he's the best pick from his draft class.
...is Tom Brady not playing...?
Anyone else notice adds are getting horrendous again?
The Patriots finally woke up in 4th quarter lol
funny how teams are #1 D until they play the colts lol
Wentz is holding the Colts back, total scrub imho
JT the real deal man
The colts literally tried giving this game away XD
Hey Bill 1800tombrady
...Ball Hawks were out...for real...
Now the sport Networks taking heads can stop praising the cheater Bill, as coaching genius  just like they keep doing with Brady, they want everyone to forget, how those two and the Patriots cheated to win championships when Brady was there.
JT is rightfully getting the praise, but his o line are complete dogs. Maul everyone.
49.7 qbr for Carson Wentz in this game. Not the best, lol.
My mouth dropped when I saw that Taylor was taken in the second round, if you watched him in college you would’ve thought this dude was gonna be a early 1st rounder, definitely a steal so glad to see him prove himself.
Colts never disappoint us
Can't wait for Flight's reaction.
NFL turning players from tight end to wide receivers.
Without Brady, Belichick has 1 ring. He will never win another SB, mark my words.
No Damien Harris is the reason for the loss but I like the way we fought back. Next game won’t be the same result. I promise you.
Good! F the pats!!
Colts defense came hard!
Alot of people compare mac jones to brady but if you realy look at how he moves and throws the ball looks alot like peyton manning
Chiefs kingdom
Ohhh great now I get to go in to work on Monday and listen to the delusional Patriots fans make every excuse under the sun on why they lost. I still to this day have yet to run into a realistic Pat's fan that will just say " We Just Got Beat. That's all there is to it".. Instead I will hear something stupid like the temperature was set to 80 degrees inside the colts dome and that why they lost.
If you can’t stop the run you can’t win.
Isn't Belichick's trademark to take away the opponent's best offensive player ?? Rough night for the hoodie
cant stop JT, just ask the Pats! MVP 100%
Johnathan Taylor = MVP
I just got an inkling Patriots fans, and I'm an unbiased source by the way, that Mac Jones ain't your next Tom Brady.  You guys are gonna be off that high horse real quick buddy.
As a Chiefs fan I just want to give a shout out to the Colts and send a THANK YOU!
This Kid is an absolute Work Horse of a back!!!! I’m an Eagles fan and I didn’t want to see Carson go but I hope he takes them deep into the playoffs. He’s really had a rough go of it. If my Eagles don’t get in the dance I’m rooting for the Packers and in the AFC the Colts and Browns. Great Win Indy!!!
Anyone going to talk about how Casrson Wentz was just TRYING to lose the game?
Chiefs fan here, I know I should be happy, and I kinda am, but dang, I am also kinda afraid of the Colts XD how about we meet in the playoffs, guys? I'd love to see Jonathan Taylor test our defense, dude is amazing
“How many penalties”  The Patriots : yes
Patriots were not ready.  Too conservative on offense.  Lost in the trenches.  Bill B did not get his team ready.  Not ready for the big time yet.  Time will tell but if I had to bet it would not be on the Patriots.  Chiefs, Colts, even the Bills in front of the Pats.
WEEK 1  THE DOLPHINS DID THE SAME THING TO THIS TEAM
Neutral viewer here but the Patriots really competed in the 4th quarter. Once this team can clean up their mistakes they will definitely be haunting the AFC for years to come. Not to mention staring down a potential division win with a rookie quarterback. Colts just had the tailwinds this game, congrats to them.
just imagine if andrew luck had this team too bad he retired early
The better team won. Period. New England isn't going to the Super Bowl.
They are running him into the ground
Taylor is the second toughest RB to tackle in the NFL this year. What a beast!
The Pat's looked like they did in the first 6 games of the season during this game. Sloppy play and poor execution in all 3 phases of the game. As a Pat's fan this was a tough loss.
Still get that feeling of Patriots always going to come back somehow even though tom brady isn't there anymore
I'm so happy for Indianapolis! I just wish the Colts had WRs and TEs that made some noise. Will they be able to win down the stretch and in the playoffs w/out them?
Jonathan Taylor is a beast! He ran over the Patriots all night!
Patriots run D looked worse than I thought they were because Colts OLine is so good. Mac Jones made some rookie mistakes and also has a few good plays. Patriots looked exactly as I expected, good team but not as good as their record indicates they are a playoff level team just not Super Bowl level yet, give Mac Jones 1-2 more years and give him 1 really good receiver and maybe.
I see that Referee somewhere every week, he calls Holding on every other play, offense & defense, he calls Holding on the Holder for Holding the ball for Field Goals  ... that guy is out of control
If colts get the chiefs rd 2 I would not be shocked to see the colts take them out.
Lol where's all this pats superbowl talk now. Just a team that played a weak schedule and overachieved. KC still the team to beat
New England PATRIOTS 17 vs 27 Indianapolis COLTS
JT carried the team and It was  great to beat the patriots especially since we haven’t beat them since 2009 .
I rewatched every play to see what Quentin Nelson did for the colts. If an offensive lineman ever wins the nfl top 100 it should be him
Amazing game. On a totally different subject, these colt uniforms are so lame; need a redesign asap imo
The Patriots got out played and out hustled in this game. You could tell the colts wanted it more. I will say even with the interceptions, Mac Jones still put his team in position to win it and played an awesome second half. The defense just couldn't do anything with Jonathon Taylor
I don’t know what the colts would’ve been this year with out JT! But man this dudes been an absolute animal this year
This guy reminds me of  L.T.
only thing more id like to see from the colts is the fake to taylor and an attempt at a deep ball to extend the defense. This will open the middle running lanes even further for Taylor.
What a game by the Colts defense! This was great to watch.
I always loved the coaching staff of the colts. Their head coach play in the 35 to zero comeback of buffalo is historic too. Great coaching tonight.
Words cant explain how happy i am right now. We finally beat those jackwagons. JT is unstoppable
Mac Jones getting carried by patriots defense….
Trent brown warned his team that colts weren't a joke told you so
Pats thought they were gonna make a last minute comeback 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Taylor was such a beast. Just watching as a Packer fan but man that dude can find a hole
Pats fans: the game actually close   Patriots defense : are you sure about that release Jonathan Taylor!!!
Justice...   #SpyGate  #DeflateGate   .... never forgor....
Gawd damn Indy RB cost us the AFC.
The Refs Helped the Colts in this game BIG TIME
GG Colts. JT is special! We’re onto Buffalo
The colts were physical af. Everyone on the patriots was limping by the end of the game.
0:43 wtf was that noise 😂🥴
One run with three minutes left in the game made me $200 AND got me an extra 13 fantasy points!!!
Andy Reid has already sent the barbecue to Indy, with a bite missing of course
Wow, Indy
Tbh without Taylor I don’t know if we would be a playoff team
How the cults not beat the bucs. Oh that’s right refs were bought by Tom Brady.
The Patriot fan at 13:15 reaction 😂 priceless.
Imagine how many games that Indy lost that they could have won if they utilized Taylor like they did tonight. The guy is without a doubt in the top 5 best RBs in the game right now.
The Colts just need to keep Wentz under 35 pass attempts a game (8-1)because they are 0-5 when he has 35+ attempts in a game
Wow, they almost let the Pats come back and win.
This game proves the chiefs the best team in the AFC
Wentz such a good little boy, putting his mask on for after the game. Weak.  Taylor and the O line is the heart of that team imo. Wentz downhill vision is just not that good and his accuracy is questionable. They should create alot of short pass plays for him to build his confidence.
Why was this game today it’s Saturday
Wentz needs to clean up, he's doing way too much again. Bad game, but if Dak gets excuses Im giving him another chance.
13:23 haha🤣🤣
J.T. MVP this Year!
Watching the Patriots lose is good, but it's not watching the Cowboys lose level good
Patriots made too many mistakes and the Colts capitalized. Taylor ran over them like a train. That's all that needs to be said. The Patriots regained a little bit of life at the end but it was too late. Also, the Patriots should have gone for it on that 4th and goal at the end instead of kicking the field goal...
I'm a Pats fan but I've been saying for a while now this Colts team is the scariest team in the AFC. Since the Titans don't have Henry and the Ravens have been losing key players since the preseason I think the Colts are better than both of them and as for the other possible playoff teams I give a slight edge to the Colts in a h2h matchup against the Chiefs, Pats, Bills, Chargers, Bengals, and Browns (so all of them)
Spectacular game by Jonathan Taylor! I did not like how much they ran it though. Seemed like Wentz couldn’t make a throw all night. They should definitely mix in a couple more throws , but great game by Taylor. He carried them.
Thank you Colts for making the Patriots loss  -Bills fan
Man that was a good W vs a great team! Colts D was great! Glad to see the Colts having a physical O line and a great rb dominating the game! Gg to the patriots fans! Hopefully this W reignites the rivalry and leads to more interesting matchups in the future. Y’all have a great team and a good Qb with a promising future. Much respect to BB!They will definitely rebound after this loss. Good luck on the rest of the season! Now on to the Cardinals.
Colts looking tough this season
Good game
I love Jonathan Taylor and I hope that he wins the MVP, but the Colts have to stop over-using him. He gets like 25+ carries per game. He’s gonna be injured before u know it from all those carries.
Darn good game.
This game just shows that if this Colts team can get their consistency under control, they can and will beat anyone.
*UGH! WE WERE SUPPOSE TO FEAST ON CARSON WENTZ! FOR ALL YOU MORONS SAYING MY PATS GOT MOLESTED BY THE COLTS DEFENSE, SEE YOU HATERS IN THE SUPER BOWL! C'MON GUYS, YEAH!!!*
As a Patriots fan I called if there was gonna be a game we are going to lose after our streak it was gonna be the Colts.
Gotta admit that JT is a game changer. I’m a Browns fan BTW
taylor coming in clutch for my fantasy team rn
This man really be thinking he Brady😂😂😂😂😂😂
If there was ever a game I thought the colts would definitely lose this season, it was this one. I feel like we won the super bowl tonight.
Thanks Colts. Complete dismantling of the patriots!!!! Love it!
Good job, Indy! Now hopefully the Steelers can win tomorrow so that my Chiefs can stay as the #1 seed in the AFC
Meyers need to know the first down
Gg
Mac Jones was hot plain garbage this game not even gonna lie he really threw the ball away on 4th and 1 with an open gap they shoulda had a mobile backup like cam Newton
Been waiting for us to beat New England since the 4th and 2 game! GG Pats
Been trying to tell people patriots schedule was kinda Sketchy
The AFC is a blood bath.
Patriots really need to go back to the other uniforms
This loss ended the Pats 7 game win streak. Hopefully, this isn't a sign of the Pats fading, as it would be the worst time with the Bills and the streaking Dolphins coming up.
Thank you -chiefs
Pats fan here.Great game to all the Colts fans out there and I hope for a rematch in the playoffs (hopefully without Taylor having 160 yards though)Also the Colts defense is a great unit
The blocking looks phenomenal for the colts. To see pulling guards like that is a pleasant thing to watch , like a well oiled machine.
Let's go!!!! #INDIANAPOLIS
My prediction going into the night was Patriots would win because the Colts would commit more penalties and turn the ball over at key spots. I ended up predicting how the game would go, just the wrong team. Very uncharacteristic mistakes that added up as the night went on.
6:16 that's been tough WHAT now?
This Years Offensive MVP Jonathan Taylor!
If the Colts can continue this strong momentum , teams gotta watch out for them cause they will make some big time noise and no one in the AFC wants to see these guys
You know what is crazy? People always talk about protocol typical QBs like Elway did not complete 56% of his passes...... You cannot convince me, NE and IND would not be better with Lamar or prime Vick..... Those 2 teams are being held back by the QB You can @me if you want, but it does not change the fact, their teams win, when they do less.
Kinda ironic how the Pats beat the Bills with the run game and the Bills couldn’t stop them, and now the Colts just spams the run game against the Patriots and the pats also couldn’t stop it lol.
America has, as a people, through their elected and appointed representatives, said to Christ, “Go away. We would not have you rule over us.” The shambles of a civilization that we are looking to pass on to our grandchildren are therefore a shambles created by the godless, for the godless. And what is the destiny of any town, nation, culture, or civilization that rejects Christ? What is their future?
If Donta Hightower doesn’t missed that tackle we ultimately come back to win this game
Just when I thought the Patriots were going to make a comeback JT comes to save the day. GG
Didn’t like the lose but kept it in there til the end but like i said we went to Super Bowl with a 12-5 record and won plus colts got some hard games coming so take in this win cause afc wild card and hunt teams are hungry and y’all almost blew a 20 -0 lead in just 1 quarter let’s regroup and move on to next game and finish off with a  12-5 record fighting til season over.
Patriots' offense ain't too creative. If they can't run it down your throat and have to pass to win it, opponents can beat them.
Can’t feel sorry for my team when we had a slow ass start onto next week 💯
Patriots aren't the best in the AFC as everyone says so.
The Colts have swept the AFC East for the first time since 2006
Can't always win with Brady's system, Bill.
Sorry ass patriots yall are cursed will not win another superbowl till next life time how did yall let the goat of all team sports go just like that,,yall will see
Leonard has as many turnovers as Trevon Diggs this year. Both at 9 just sayin..
I’ve seen clearly that it is so hard to play with a lead. The Colts tried everything to keep the Patriots off balance but we still give up chunks when teams have to pass to get back in the game. The difference in this game was we went to Taylor and stayed with him and it paid off at the very end. Huge win for Indy
Jonathan Taylor absolutely saved the Colts season , yeah Carson Wentz had his moments but for sure JT saved their season cause the colts were dead in the water like prior to week 6-7 , but their season is saved because of JT
Why ejecting Michael Pittman jr he did nothing wrong
Looks like Mac Jones noodle arm finally came back to bite him.
I feel bad for the colts wrs they got no chances
That one was for baby Kelly may she rest it peace
Colts used the Patriots gameplan against the Bills in week 13 to win tonight…how the tables have turned
This just proves No one wants to see the Indianapolis Colts in the postseason and I mean NO ONE . Jonathan Taylor deserves the game ball for sure , the NE Patriots were NOT RDY tonight . What a win Colts
JT the best back in the league.
GG colts. On to Buffalo
Truly excited for when playoff kicksoff, especially when AFC Conference has been  most intriguing this year. Can't really go on the Limp and say this particular team will represent the AFC in the Superbowl. Its going to be a dogfight in the AFC come postseason 😂
If Andrew Luck was playing behind this Colts offense, this team would be absolutely insane.
Colts thank you honestly I hope we meet in the AFC Championship to make the best game ever Henry and Taylor combine for 400 rush yards.
Nice it's Kevin Burkhardt!  NE and IND on the FOX scoreboard layout!
Calling it like a video game lmao…you run into the back of your Oline as a RB in any madden game you’re being tackled not dancing around😅
Brady 9-0 vs The Colts last 9 starts/ Belichick 0-1 without Brady
JT is a beast I just hope the colts don’t run him in the ground like the rams did to Gurley
EJ Speed doens't have an avatar LOL
Now we own the AFC East Something the Titans can’t do  Go Colts!
Thank you Colts! - Chiefs fans
Matt Eberflus taking McDaniels to the wood shed for doing him like that
I love you Indianapolis colts 😘
I want either Taylor or Kupp to win MVP kinda annoyed with how QBs always get it.
Oh and to the Bills community who are happy right now, See you next weekend in Foxborough!
Tough loss, but this makes me hopeful in the Pats sweeping the Bills
It’s sad to say but I’m starting to give up hope on Carson wentz. He is just way to inconsistent to be a great qb. We can’t just always rely on JT to win us every game. GG pats
And they said patriots would shut Taylor down 😂😂😂 HA
Honestly have to tip my hat to the Colts here. The Patriots made to many mistakes and didn't look good for majority of the game. Also Jonathan Taylor is a BEAST!
This was the Colts first win against the Patriots in 12 years.
Great win for the Colts. Because of hard knocks I’ve grown to like this team lol AFC is really a toss up right now. Really no dominate teams gonna be interesting to see who meets in the AFC Championship game.
If JT reaches 2k rushing yards, 25 total TDs, and the Colts win out then he should definitely win MVP
I refuse to leave this game believing the Colts are better than the patriots
The Colts really have turned their season around I really started to realize they were better than their record said they were after the Raven game. hope they can make some noise if they get to the playoffs
I can't believe Jonathan Taylor is NOT on IR after this game. He had to carry the entire team on his back throughout the game! MVP candidate for sure!!!
How to beat a team with a good running game??    Be better at it!!
Prove it in the playoffs when it really matters
7
And people were saying the Patriots would be a challenge for the chiefs 😂🤣
Go colts!
Great game on the Colts you did your job and won like I predicted. New England Patriots learn from your mistakes and weaknesses.and lfg Pat Nation.
Let’s just say, wentz’s best plays are when he hands the ball off to JT
I thought belichick was gonna shut down the run 🏃‍♂️ Johnathan Taylor 170rush yards lol
got too far down
Great win by the Colts. I always thought they were better than their record
MVP!!!!!
J.T.!!
Jonathan Taylor is mvp, idc what anyone says
Sorry rip me if you want, but I dont think the colts are that good. This game looked more about the patriots crapping down their pant leg in a way I've never seen before more than anything lol
I definitely see Jonathan Taylor being MVP
I just love it when I get that pop up saying "Someone has liked your comment" or "Someone has subscribed!" 🎄Merry Christmas!!🎄 And Happy New Year!🎡🎢🌅🌄🌇🌇🌇
What a amazing season for the Patriots. That was a great game, and having a rookie QB you’re going to have games like this.
As a Dolphins fan, Thank you Colts 😊😊😊😊😊
Good game Pats
Patriots fan here. Great game Colts community! Patriots went on a 2 week vacation and finally realized they were playing a football game in the 4th quarter. Colts definitely played a better game. (And this is how Patriots fans accept a loss without blaming the other team)
The Colts went undefeated against the AFC East this year
Let’s Go Colts!!!
Josh Allen is smiling in his sleep right now
peep mac jones wearing the glove like tom 👀
So satisfying
Jesus Christ loves you guys and he died for ours sins so that we can be saved by grace through faith. Ask me about Jesus if you want to.
As a Cardinals fan, it's safe to assume that I am very nervous about next week's meeting with the Colts. These Colts are dangerous. Based on the Cardinals inconsistency at home this year, they're going to have a long day if they don't fix that.
The playoffs are going to be insane. This game proved that anyone can beat anyone in the afc
Colts are playoff serious
Patriots were exposed and outclassed by a far superior team. Utterly demoralized, complete with temper tantrums because they got out physicaled the whole game. Patriots have an oversized defense that can't stop the run to save their lives, no playmakers on offense, and whatever the f Mac Jones is supposed to be. Poor man's Kirk Cousins I guess.   Sorry to all the pats fans who bought the snake oil on this guy from the knee jerk media. The pats were clearly scheming to hide their QB. Yeah gl with that. He isn't going to win you games, he's more likely to get your WR's killed. Pats are realistically the 4th or 5th best team in their conference.   And Belichek got utterly out coached coming out of a bye week. 😂
Colts enjoy for now for now
Mac Jones just played his best worst game
Bet they talk about how bad Wentz played even though Mac threw 3 completions when the Pats beat the Bills
That thumbnail is epic
If Tua had a game like Mac Jones was having right now, ESPN would break into programming
Titans vs Colts rivals in the AFC Championship game that will be amazing something different I don't want to see the Chiefs in the Superbowl again
Jonathan Taylor had a nice performance for the Indy offense and the Colts defense slowed down the Pats just enough to stop the Patriots win streak.
Give Taylor the MVP already.
#28 the J-Train! 🚂🏈
Sendejo was trying to hurt Pats players, karma finally got it. Pats defense was too soft.
Imagine winning
when patriots gives up 20 or more points, they are in danger of losing games. Note that down.
Bill Belichick is going to pulverize his team and coaching staff over the fact that they’re overrated
Pats suck
Brady : 10-3 Belichick : 9-5  Brady still winning.
JT!!!
This guy Taylor saved my matchup w that late touchdown wishing best of luck to the don dada
The colts are extremely underrated! But man JT makes this team scary
Mac Jones gets praised for the things Tua gets slandered for
As a bills fan, thank you so much Colts.
Give Jonathan Taylor MVP already man.
So are people gonna give this colts team credit for their great defensive effort or are they just gonna say “it’s all Jonathan Taylor” just like the Tennessee Titans. They’re a legitimate playoff team for further games. I wouldn’t be surprised if they bring it on the Cardinals
Lets go horseshoe fellas boo massholes
JT MVP !!!!
Jonathan Taylor is the Colts’ alpha dog. When he gets into an open hole, he explodes through it and it’s game over from there
as a chiefs fan i’m so glad the patriots lost. good game though
Hello, Giants fan here👋🏾 The patriots won against the bills and their QB only threw 3 passes. The Colts beat the Patriots and their QB only threw _12_ passes. I don't want to hear anything about Wentz being unreliable or that "Yeah well, Jones is a rookie" if they didnt say anything about Mac Jones and they both won
GO COLTS LFGGGGGGG
Give Jonathon Taylor the MVP. A RB winning is something we all want, its long overdue.
JT might actually be the MVP
Are going to ignore the fact that wentz only threw 5/12 tonight against a QB, who threw 3 completions last week.
6-TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMPION NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS LOSE TO 2-TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMPION INDIANAPOLIS COLTS 14:00 14:01
Go Colts. 😀
Jonathan Taylor for president
Patriots are the most well coached team in the league yet they make the most baffling decisions in the biggest moments and it has cost them all year long
This was def a wake up call for the pats. Taylor just ran em over
Firsssttt
WHERE ALL THE COCKY PATS FANS AT? 🤣🤣🤣
FTP!!
Number 28 is an mvp candidate
Interesting
Patriots: Real Madrid!  Colts: Ajax!
What took so long to upload jeez
Jonathan Taylor was a beast in this game. He's got a bright future ahead of him.
GO COLTS!!!
FIRST
GG Colts, you've earned this win! The Patriots were not in it today. We're onto Buffalo!
Fact: Jonathan Taylor is the colts offense
