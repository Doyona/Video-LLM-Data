Wasn't expecting this like I do with another of other rappers
BLM, where you at
Divide and conquer is the name of the game. Mass Confusion is the tool being used herd the masses. If you want a Medical second opinion you now have to leave the country. When you go into the doctors office and give  them your birthday and social security number two things happen. First of all your medical records pop up because now they're on a central database. So whether you went to a quack or not everything is there. The second thing that happens is how  much money you owe and your credit score popps up.. So your medical treatment is basced on your credit score.  You can thank Hillary and Obama and  that bunch for that.  Hillary & Michelle Obama parents paid their bills(of course saints in their eyes). So they feel that this gives them the right to use the medical system to kill people who don't or can't pay their bills. If a white man gave all the black people a free cell phones they would have been suspicious especially when all the pay phones started disappearing. (Try and find one) Check out what's going on in China.... that's where we're being herded like cattle  They gave all the poor health insurance not to help them, but so the medical industry can  make money off of them. This was their answer to high medical costs...   New World Order here we come. Now if we can just get rid of that pesky cash. This is why I'm a registered independent. The right in the left are in bed together their just trying to decide who's going to be on top. Trump wasn't trying to drain the swamp. He was simply redecorating. If you want to drain the swamp you have to do it from the bottom. Our forefathers when they wrote the Constitution. They wrote it in such a way that this country can be ruled from the bottom up. If every state passes the same law then it is the law of the land. And the only people who can override that law is the Supreme Court. They and their families has to live among us. If every state passes the same law then it is a Unity law. The first Unity law that should be passed is attendance requirements for Congress. A couple of thousand students go to Washington every year to see our  government in action. Congress is in session and nobody's there. Senators and representatives should be required to meet a 90% attendance rate. These people are not important enough to be impeached. They should get R&R. Recalled and Replaced.  Every States has the right replace certain restrictions on their senators and representatives just as corporations have the right you have a moral clause. The second Unity law that should be passed is Lobby restrictions. If someone wants to Lobby Congress it should only be allowed to be done on the floor Congress. You want the lobby representative you do it on the floor of the house. If you want the lobbyists senator you do it on the floor of the Senate. This makes it easier you get rid of crooked politicians. With multi media this campaign can easily go Nationwide.    .... A man who picks his banner up and gets these Unity laws passed. Will be the next president because the people will be behind him..

Why do these people all have such idiotic names?
May he be at peace. Seems like this life wasn’t so peaceful.

play dumb games win dumb prizes, this is what happens when try to be a gangster.
Another blood sacrifice by the evil ones.
Rest in peace ❤ 🙏🏽
*_RIP 🪦 Adolph “Young Dolph” Thornton Jr.._* 🙏
Never heard of him
Who?
People like this are still idolized? Tf?
Who?
Why haven’t BLM picked this up??🤔 oh yeah he got killed by another black guy
literally who cares lol
Never understood that whole "Let's go shoot a rapper" thing.
It’s a mentality. Hurt people hurt people. You can’t be loved if you can’t love yourself. Loving yourself has no room for jealousy and hip-hop will always trigger hatred upon the unloved. The flash, arrogance, appeal & success is too much for them to accept. It will always turn out this way. A hip-hop artist is the most dangerous career in America. May you all be blessed and move precisely.
Who cares
His songs were all about peace and love. Why did this happen! He was such a good role model for children!   Lmao
WHO AGREES WHO EVER KILLED DOLPH. SHALL BE KILLED THE SAME WAY IDC HOW LONG IT TAKES KILL THAT FÚCKING PERSOn (sorry I'm just mad and sad) R.i.p young dolph

Blacks are been hunted down by White supremacists so sad

Hmm.. Maybe the artistry of saying and doing all that is evil and terrible catches up with you sooner or later? Maybe we continue to make excuses for not accepting what poison is instilled in our own people?  Music can motivate; whether it be for the good or the bad, those who create it and those who hear it.
TIL: Don't stand there all blinged out in your home town unless you want the homies that drive by to get jealous. Is the only hope for these dudes to die a martyr for their bling? Like, what are you dying for? Blend in, stay humble.
Turns out it's actually you who can't stop fighting, you can't even blame "racists" for your crappy lives. It's all on you as it should be.
Jealousy making your people scared to stand on the street. This a cultural problem. and still not my problem, but damn sad.
Why did the racist cops have to do him like that?!
Blood moon ritual
Who?
https://youtu.be/h28jKlrQs5c
This is so sad it's terrible how people kill off one another.RIP Dolph😔
Where did BLM go?
Blame it on white privilege or the Rona 🙄
I'M JUST SEEING I'M AM A OG THIS HALF TO STOP WE HALF TO GET OUR SOULS TOGETHER AS ONE AND COME AS ONE WE ARE OUR WORST ENEMIES NOT THE OPPOSITE NOW BUT BASICALLY WE ARE AND SO ANGRY WHERE IS THE CRIES AND THE MEDIA WHEN THIS HAPPENS I'M WAITED WE PROTESTED CONSTANTLY BUT WHAT ABOUT US WITH THIS SOCIAL MEDIA THIS IS DESIGN
Sending much prayer to his family , it truly hurts my heart this black on black crime 😢
Exodus 20:13 “Thou shalt not kill.”
Rip to a talented soul. Prayers out to his family.
The 🐘 in the room- What type of life was this guy living off stage to gets shot at three different times...?.... Rip Young Brother
Another shot dead rapper.....and in other news.....
They like to kill eachother it seems. This is the longest I have seen a slain rapper live before being cut down by his own people.
IDK HOW RAPPERS GET KILLED IN SOMEWAY THERE IS NO LOVE IN THE WORLD PLZ BE ALL CAREFUL, R.I.P DOLPH😭😭😭😭🤧🤧🤧
RIP young dolph 😞😞 I used to vibe with his music back in high school
All these musicians need to get together and donate money to a reward fund I think for $1 million or more whoever did this would turn their own damn selves in time to get the thugs to turn on each other.  you know the cops ain’t gonna give two shits.
Who are all these dying rappers?
Why are all these punks kid, baby, young, boy, lil etc. Wake the hell up!!!! No damned warrior class left in this community! Sad!!
Why is the death of an unknown rapper on yahoo news feed?  Oh that's right, yahoo reports on anything.
Another sacrifice rapper... 36 is a Illuminati number to get sacrificed.
Why are so many of our great rappers dying so young man , rest in paradise
Why they shot him?
Isn’t this a part of the lifestyle? Shouldn’t we praise his death? Getting shot is an inherent part of the culture he chose to live in?
Oh well  no lost
I'm not here to be disrespectful but come on people, quit the cognitive dissonance. The energy you put out is what you will get back. You can't make your whole career off of raping about murder and violence and not expect it to come back to you.
We all know it was Yo Gotti or Blaque. Memphis is real stupid.
Never heard of him
R.I.P Dolph smh too too soon. Prayers for his family
https://youtu.be/Xi0oxxn8aG4

My heart goes 💔out to your family! Bless you!
Bless your family, and my je a rt goes
R.I.P in Boi !!! I just Found this out Now Wow !!! GOD Bless you're Mother and Family!!! BRO
Pretty lame these dudes go for guns instead of fighting , I rather give my respect and love to a motherfucker who can fight and is fearless with his hands and can rap about kicking someone's ass and not going for the gun , anybody can shoot anybody its not Manley , being good with your hands and fucking someone up snd letting them bleed is better than taking someones life over dumb shit , but there's reason why to kill somebody i just don't think its appropriate for the slightest disrespect  , its really lame  there is so many cowards out there shooting people , start using your hands guns are played out.....
Young brother was doing everything right ,shame we keep killing us ,question is why do we hate each other when we  all look the same , Yesterday a wife lost a husband a mother lost a son kids lost a father . A father lost a son grandparents lost a grandson,  The world lost a talented young man , and for me I lost another brother that look like me by the hands of brothers that look like me tomorrow is another day I'll turn on the TV and the first thing I'll probably see is a brother killed by the hands of a brother that look like me when will we love us enough to stop killing us , young brothers I love you enough to say I love you but love is an action word show me you love me and us by not killing us
He was self made, record labels worst fear, so they had 2 get rid of him, think about it,  he was putting on so many other go getters like him,  they don't want that,  sad #rip
The black inner city under a curse by God for rejecting God of the bible and I am from the hood homie. Inner city worshipping rappers like idols and not God Wake up! We are in the Apocalypse "Then he said to me, “This is the curse that goes out over the face of the whole earth: ‘Every thief shall be expelled,’ according to this side of the scroll; and, ‘Every perjurer shall be expelled,’ according to that side of it.” “I will send out the curse,” says the Lord of hosts; “It shall enter the house of the thief And the house of the one who swears falsely by My name. It shall remain in the midst of his house And consume it, with its timber and stones.”Zechariah 5:3‭-‬4 NKJV

My condolences. Sorry for being late.
REALLY SAD. CAN'T UNDERESTIMATED THESE STREETS 💞🙏💞 R.I.P.
My tribute to this fallen angel. Mind Body & Sound will miss you bro.
One of the problems with the death of hip artists is simply their performances do not seem to appeal to a great big audience. No matter the color of the face not everyone hears the radical message formere destruction from what was created in the Ghetto of the 1050$ by Democrats while the Black man remains enslaved to the Democrat Plantation. As far as Dolph is concerned I am sad he is dead.  He was out there with his message.   Right or wrong it was ended.  What was he doing that caused his death. Is question that may respond with the word "Nothing." . .. We both know that might not be exact truth.
WHO

RIP DOLPH 🐬#LEGEND
My condolences to the families and friends God bless all you

Rip young Dolph
Bitches was waiting n hating
Cookie Munster wanted for questioning! Fookin Adolf!
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Why the same old same old, never ending killings, sick of it all
No one in uk ever heard of him
*Young black men ages 15-35 are the only demographic in America, of all other ages, sexes, and races, whose leading cause of preventable death is being murdered… not by racists, white folks, or cops, nope. They are overwhelmingly murdered by other black men. Which is how you get young black men (3% of USA pop) committing more murders/being murdered more than the other 97% of America COMBINED. And unless you’re a famous young black man, the media and activists and politicians and artists clearly do not think your “lives matter”, since they habitually ignore these cases in preference to the 10-20 unarmed black Americans killed by cops annually. It’s as if they don’t actually care about black peoples lives at all, and only pretend to care about a handful of cases which they can use politically.* Dolph is now just another statistic that no one gives a shit about.
👏🤣
Good evening y'all Rip young King God got u now my Condolences to your family and friends 🕊️🙏❤️🌹

WHATS YO FAVORITE DOLPH SONG
"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me." John 14:6 Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior, all of us must choose between Life, and Death... Life is found in Jesus, and through belief in him as your Lord and Savior, you shall be saved from Death, and receive Eternal Life. If you reject Jesus while here on Earth, you choose death, and death for Eternity is known as Hell, it is separation from God and his Love for us. Please, choose Life thru belief in Jesus. God Bless you all
Another good hearted brother taken way to soon.  I bump Dolph in the work truck daily !!!!! SMFH rip
Pretending to be a gangsta when you aren't is dangerous to one's health.
His music was shit.. he talked soo much trash.. he had it coming.. grow up people he thought he was invincible... 👎🏻
Name me 3 songs from this person
"Furthermore, the mass lockout in the world due to Corona has made the major countries know that the global warming did not happen because of factories but because of another reason which they hide from the world, and I know that they are guessing blindly that there is a planet approaching the Earth even though they have not seen it directly due to its different colours; to illustrate, white like the sun, red, and black so how are they going to see a planet that is covered with fire that is darker than a new moon, can you see a new moon despite its closeness to the Earth? It is the same case for planet Saqar when it is covered with intense black fire. But they will know about its coming from scientific theories through its effect on all the planets of the solar system, the sun, and the moon. And the sun has caught up with the moon due to the approach of Planet Saqar, so the full moon occurs ahead of its time before the night of the middle of the lunar month as a repetitive warning in the sky of humans but did not cause them any remembrance Moreover, consecutive climatic disasters are going to befall you and I do not think that it will cause you any remembrance as those fools who do not reason, think, nor believe but what NASA announced, ignoring what Allah's caliph Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani has stated of news that are the truest Words of Allah Lord of the worlds, but NASA and others hide this truth from the worlds and NASA the so-called protector of planet Earth from the dangers of the meteors of planetoids will not benefit you, and I swear by Allah they could not protect themselves from the Planetoid of the first Rajefah (quake). Indeed, Allah will target with the Planetoid of torment the United States of America and they would not be able to protect themselves and it will strike in the speed of light in the land behind the Atlantic Ocean in the USA, in line with the Word of Allah the Exalted: {And Our command is but one, like a glance of the eye. (50) And We have already destroyed your kinds, so is there any who will remember? (51) Al-Qamar -Chapter: 54 -Verses: 50-51" Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yamani 08 - Rabi Awwal - 1443 AH 14 - October - 2021 AD 08:58 am (According to the official time of [Mecca] Mother of towns) ______________________   https://awaited-mahdi.com/showthread.php?p=362934 3 #بدر_ربيع_الثاني_لكافه_الدول PMBoFR
"Perhaps a questioner would like to say: "Yes, Coronavirus has come by the end of 2019 and the whole world has been quarantined at the beginning of 2020, and we said it is a blessing in disguise thinking that Coronavirus has solved the issue of global warming which the Paris climate agreement conference could not find a solution for since it has suspended the work of factories, vehicular traffic, trains, planes and vessels We were also sure it will reduce climate disasters due to the reduction of carbon dioxide exhausts thinking that Coronavirus shall solve a problem which the Paris climate agreement could not ,while it (the agreement) used to call for reducing 50% of these exhausts; however, it was not applied because countries were afraid on their economy to be hit hard but corona came and stopped the carbonic emissions by 100% for many months, and we thought that climate disasters shall be reduced. But we were shocked as the complete opposite happened! Instead of reducing the climate disasters the intensity of the climatic war causing floods and hurricanes has increased all around the world like never before so Coronavirus has destroyed the global warming theory since the Paris climate agreement was not applied ;given that they have agreed upon reducing 50% of factories exhausts, but Coronavirus has reduced them by 100% for many months due to the quarantine and mass lockdown; on the other hand, the intensity of climatic disasters unprecedentedly increased since 2020 till now; hence the global warming theory has failed O Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani, your statements about different matters are verified on actual reality, and those who follow them know this as you have been denying and disbelieving in the global warming theory for more than 16 years, and said that the planet of fire, Saqar, is approaching the Earth and affecting it from a distant place and you have written many statements concerning this matter but we still have not believed you and we believed the global warming theory that then has failed! So could you extract from the Great Quran what proofs that virus corona was sent by Allah to verify your fatwa to demolish the global warming theory as it will force us to stop our factories and wheel of carbonic life for many months, then, it raises the intensity of the unprecedented climate war to destroy the global warming theory?" Then, I reply to the questioners and say: you shall find the news in the word of Allah the Exalted: {But those who deny Our signs - We will progressively lead them [to destruction] from where they do not know. (182) And I will give them time. Indeed, my plan is firm. (183) Then do they not give thought? There is in their companion no madness. He is not but a clear warner.

this is why it is so important to not only spot the warning signs of jealousy but to take swift action and totally cut out any and all jealous people from your life and loved ones, jealousy is a sickness and is completely unacceptable to allow around.
I have absolutely no idea who that person is
That’s major
O shit whatever
👏🏻👏🏻🔥
RIP Young Dolph
I is an alcoholic pls donate to my address in About section

Push thug culture, get thug results. Then one someone gets shot *surprised Pikachu face*
I’m still sitting here just not wanting to accept that I’d never hear this dudes music again no lie 1 hell of a life by young dolph is in my opinion one of the best songs to come out in a while rip  he was a another legend gone to soon
RIP Dolph. What cowards. Smh. Nobody values life anymore. Period. My 🙏 go out to his kids and family.
Why are we killing each other. Black brothers need to stop shooting each other.
You got shot at with over 100 bullets lucky it was in a bulletproof car that was god giving you a second chance  ..RIP YD
Everybody and their mother knows who's involved in it not going to @ no rapper but it rhymes with botti

But does anyone notice the homeless that died last night on the street?
Who?
Hello video good

Live by the sword, die by the sword.  No disrespect Never heard his music before. But if he never deserved it. My bad then.
Jesus is your way to heaven Believe in him and you will have life after death. He shed his blood for your sins to be forgiven

Lol
Why does this video say its shocking news no its not this is the new norm in rap culture its sad to say but it is
Im sick and tired of all this black on black crime especially those who have influence on the young generation.This is very sad and needs to stop and rise above the hate....
Never heard of this guy but not surprised. He fits the demographic.
Omg 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
A vehicle drives by at 1pm broad daylight stops and shoots him and no one sees anything or knows anything about the driver or make/model okay really ??? But people can stand around take a video showing the glass shattered windows to the bakery and talk about his arm hanging out but who witnessed it??? No one gets a tag number nothing SMDH
Take this as a lesson, if you make it big, specially with rap, get the f*ck out of your Hood and never come back
Thumps UP
In Jesus name  "(Hate Me Now) Nas ft. Puff Daddy"  People give judges a bad rep Slam Dunk Competition is my justification that judges don't always have to have this mean personification YouTube "Every 50-Point Dunk In NBA Dunk Contest History (1984-2019)!" Unless you're terrible at everything This should excite you If you see yourself getting no higher than an 8 out of 10 from every judge You're gonna hate the people getting 9s & 10s "My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you? Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too" Hate when I'm the winner but you give the loser more petty attention Leave me in the sun Here's my Cristiano Ronaldo impression & my Brock Lesnar's Keep me out of the sun Like Deion Sanders Bo Jackson Michael Jordan Multisports players Baseball ⚾️ Basketball 🏀  Football ⚽️ /🏉 You guys have never been a hybrid in your damn life That's what you can't understand (P.diddy voice) White society & Latin world 🌎 I score perfect in both worlds Wearing mismatched Jordans ✝️ In Jesus name amen
Never heard of the thug
Dam smh. Thought it was a dream but I guess not.

GOD IS TIRED OF RAPPERS AND THESE IMAGINES THESE PEOPLE ARE PUTTING IN OUR SOCIETY.ONE LESS FOOLISH PERSON TO USE THEIR MUSIC TO ALLURE OF YOUTH.DONT HATE IF I DON'T LIKE MY COMMENT BECAUSE GOD DID
Hi, but i am unverified
And when white rappers get shot, there is no news. Racism.
I’m still sitting here just not wanting to accept that I’d never hear this dudes music again no lie 1 hell of a life by young dolph is in my opinion one of the best songs to come out in a while rip  he was a another legend gone to soon
May your soul RIP. God bless your family. I’ll pray for your justice. Very sad, very sad to hear the news. Senseless craziness.
Why can’t these rappers just work together! Share the pie and go home!!! Envy/jealous😡RIP brother! Let’s pray there won’t be retaliation!! Memphis got enough crime for the state!!!!😡😷
R.I.P. Young Dolph 🙏😞 I've never actually listened to any of his music until today. We have to stop killing each other. This is really sad & seems to only be getting worse. I pray for black white yellow brown Green purple whatever. This really does need to stop. 36 years old? Unfortunately for the black male that's an eternity. Most black youths barely see 25 smh. Stay Up Dolph
Rip to young Dolph
Young Dolph was murdered today and ppl need to realize Mark 8:36 what profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul, shout out to all the true churches and ministries that do more than preach in the four walls, and actually go into the hood and the streets and witness the seeds must be at least planted in these young ppl and all ppl, in the background of this song he is in hell and says if i sacfice my soul will i go to hell, his music like all the others is full of killing dope, drugs, derogatory terms of women. The Bible says the truth- Pro 18:21 KJV Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. When all u rap and talk about is killing and shooting and u will kill a nigga this and that u are doing nothing but speaking curses on your own life by your own mouth #youngdolph praying for his mom his wife kids and family members sad situation
Be sure to watch my short video
If richard porter made it out the trap type shii.... 💙💙🥺... rest up Dolph you definitely my Elvis
Who?

Love you little bro rest in peace!
Even in pop culture we show respect thru comments and posts...what we become is low
Jesus Christ of Nazareth is the only way to salvation and forgiveness of sins.   Believe in Him.
Who?
Saying rip ain't gonna do shit. Blks, ya all gotta start calling each other out man. You don't see this level of violence from any other group in America. Ya all need to put fathers back in the home. Whites too, but ESP blks. By FAR.
Yo I Been Trynna Stay Off The Internet For A While And Somebody Jus Came Thru My Job And Was Like “yO yOu hEaRd BoUt YoUnG dOlPh?”  I Truly Wasnt Expecting To Hear That Today Man💔

*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Rip dolph

"Shocking" news? Really?
DEATH OF YOUNG DOLPH IS A TRAP TO LISTEN TO HIS LAST TOXIC ☢ALBUM
I can't believe it. I wanna say a lot, about how his music helped me, but all I'll say is I'm with everyone rightnow in their grief. RIP Dolph. I wish you weren't taken from us. I don't wanna believe it.
Am sorry to hear that 😔  Rest easy mate  🎉 👏 🙌
Video of dolf up close https://youtu.be/XkQ-QuP1Ct4
I can’t imagine how Key Glock is taking this right now, damn R.I.P to Dolph
Rest in peace
Damn they shot him at a cookie store? Zero respect or honor among these people.
Ridiculous.  Why is the rap world so aggressive toward their fellow artists?  Great job killing each other, idiots.
WTF is this video.. RIP brother
You’re more likely to die being a rapper than a shark attack
Its part of the game.
:(
👍👍👍👍👍👍
If these rapers just had one white friend to direct them with certain decicions.You made your money now move to Colorado, buy a few thousand acres and a beautiful house..don't  hang out where young punks are trying to make a name off of shooting you
Everybody fuks with you when you dead its the sad truth
He was good,  he was different.
BLM right?
That's funny😂😂
Fucken haters !!!! 😡
Was set up who ever was knew that he was gonna be there. Rip
Wait are you fr!!!!
Who gives a shit!!!!!!!
Died just like nipsey and many others ..in his own hood....I worry about kodak black ..hope he takes note and stays out of his old hood
This really truly hurts man, after Travis let folks get hurt and killed at his show, I really feel like humanity is struggling on the edge. Why can't we just love one another. Dolph was speaking truth for people to find a message in his words. Another Marley, sharing love but taken only by hate. This world didn't deserve a soul like dolph
This most definitely hurt. Prayers for his family.
https://youtu.be/H3JrdCtB7Rk
All you folks saying how shocked you are. Well do something about this violence. Open your mouth and stand against it.
Rich slave was an absolute masterpiece album. You were the absolute king, rip young sir, you have earned your wings 🙏 ❤
Maybe it’s the chubby part of me making me so sad. I mean the man died wanting a cookie. RIP and here’s hoping 🤞 heaven has cookie stores.
Rip young Dolph
Damn man why all the killing.
R.I.P
Damn I hope they gave him cookies when he got to heaven or wherever he went
The devil is taking hey souls that sold out! He knows it’s war time for him. He is going to kill them all! Just the truth that no one wants to hear!
Lost my job 2day but there are worse things. Enjoy your life & loved ones while you can people. Condolences to Young Dolph's family.

The devil collecting on his debt
Rip peace OG your music cheered me up when I was all alone.
Part of life in the streets. And the rap game still holds true to that fact. Losing people every week it seems now. People just got so much hate. RIP.
He really changed my life for the better before I met Mr Steve Hopkins, I had to worry about student loans and credit card debts and now I've been able to pay up and even buy my own house with the help of Mr Steve Hopkins.
That’s the problem when having a car with a wrap like his. People knew it was him
RIP DOLPH
Let me guess now y’all gonna start calling him a legend
DAMMM THEY GOT EM
Rest In Peace 🙏🏾
Just got into him and Glock in the past few months...helped a lot with depression and the best one to listen to high. The only rapper death I actually cared about man this fucking blows I deserve to die more than him why
No!😢😭
I am from Memphis we are not happy this happened
Man they gotta just let people live.. black people gotta have a change to live with out all this violence. Pussy or not this is why black people cant help each other to many wanna see us down an not enough wanna see us up. Dam man just work together eat build a empire and keep it moving. Can’t even go back to your own city when u up cause u gotta be afraid of haters taking u out. Why be worried about the next man. That’s the reason your shit ain’t moving forward. They ain’t worried about you that why they got it. Sad story but it’s clearly a continuous story. That will never stop long as people envy the next man 🤦‍♂️... R.I.P dolph but who’s next what I’m asking when I pray.
Ya already know who order the hit !!
So sad
All these rappers saying all this , but still they keep glorifying all the violence which the youth keeps picking  up.this is stupidity at it's worse nobody gonna learn shit from his death this shit is going to keep on and on
like what tha hell dawg maaaaaane ts fuckin sad afawk! how i jus move tf on yo?
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 he will be back We sprout like seeds
- Gotti or moneybag yo they can’t plane for a hit like this one, it’s a clean fast hit RIP a true OG he been in the streets for awhile sad to see him gone in his own city !!
Who cares
You will live on though the motivation you give in every damn song I Love my homie Young Dolph
Rest Up Young Dolph 🙏  https://youtube.com/shorts/hL8NyJyv2T8?feature=share 💔 May the 🌞 shine on you and your loved ones 💔⚘
The streets dont love ya,remember circumstances put u in it. Rip dolph
It be your own people....damn 💔
all these rappers saying they cant believe it! rap literally praises and promotes violence and destructive lifestyles. saying you cant believe it is like saying you cant believe the guy soak and wet running around outside with a metal pole on his head got struck by lightning! i dont think they necesarly are trying to make shit like this the outcome of their music and promotion of thuggery, but it is the outcome! maybe they should reevaluate the things they promote so theres not another young dolph next week, but we all know they wont and more rappers will be killed! i pray for him and his family and for god to use his death to open more peoples eyes!
Damn that 💩 was major
Gucci was the one to put dolph on. I know Gucci probably really hurtin right now
Black Lives Matter
Rappers getting clap should not surprise anybody. So the moral of the story anybody can die , so talking tough is useless
Smh.. mad af
We are being hated on because of our skin color and we still choose to kill each other instead of working together bruh, this is what they want, they want to see us dead or in jail and we are giving them what they want, we gotta make change bruh 😕 stop the violence
This is deeply tragic and upsetting. He didn't deserve this he was just minding his own business
Damn man not another one! I understand people love their hometowns but it's way to dangerous! I would be covered in a armed car that doesnt stand out, with a huge team of security, only getting out to go where I absolutely need to go! People always think they are invincible smh! Wish he would have stayed far away! Such a shame! Rip Dolph! 💔🙏e/

(Lil peep fentyal) (juice world pill reason he didn't want get caught by the police  when leaving plane)  (mac miller suicide) astroworld  125 victims  tf fuck? Yall don't think this is sketch  its a fucking pattern. If the fact  of selling your soul to be famous.  These are sacrifices  these people get famous for a little bit then kill you collect there debt.  Call me crazy. R.I.P man to all of them

Rapper lives matter.
R.I.p we got to do better.
Rest in Love. The People's Champ☝🏾🙏🏽😭
Rest Easy My G
Young Dolph was in debt with the Kingpin Big 8.  https://youtu.be/ygGQ-V6NHJ0
Mainstream reporting on it is cringe. Look how they immediately go to other celebrity reactions like anyone should gaf what they think. RIP Young Dolph. Most solid one that was out there unlike these lames reacting to your passing...
That music that you rap about can catch up to you. Get your money and move to the surburbs. Im a hip hop fan and I went out a few weeks ago and I had to ask myself why am I even in this club. You listen to some of the words that we party to and it really makes you think. I can not be in that type of environment anymore. Another young Dolph is being created right now, it's just a revolving door but some of these dudes that make it and get a little money in the industry don't understand. I see them as puppets being paid to promote negativity into the air waves and to many of us love to promote it.  People act shocked when this happens. Gotta be smart out here. RIP 🙏
Rest in peace 🙏🙏
You know what they say rappers get killed in they’re own city 😒 Rest Up Dolph
I was just listening to the old homies talk about how rap is being stolen right before our eyes….  “Take that shit,  & everything that comes with it”. This is way out of hand.  It’s time to create something new. Rip
This shit hurt me and i don’t even no dat man R.I.H 🙏🏾🤦‍♂️
SMMFFHH … fukd me up wit dis one .. made a lot of money running up n down da beltway.. I’m talkn bout trappin out da mansion I been fuckin wit u Bro …   DOE B.. BANKROLL…NIPSEY… VON…CHINX…NOW MY NIGGA DOLPH …yall fuckn up  RIP DOLPH
Shi krazy dolph was never in the miss of any  bs and he did his shi independent 🙏🕊 RIP

When you taunt and make fun of death…..
Lets hope this doesn't because another unsolved case! Even though I have never heard of him I definitely will send my condolences to his family
I don't get why yell wanna keep killing each other.
Damn I've been rocking with dolph since his mixtapes days! It sucks cause he always had a target on him. He truly was legend and prayers to his family. Rest in peace and fuck yo gotti!
Bro wtf was coi Leray wearing smfh 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
LORD BLESS HIS YOUNG HEART ❤️ AND SOUL! MAN I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW OUR PEOPLE ARE GETTING KILLED AT A RAPID RATE OF 100! AND NOBODY SEEMS TO CARE BUT US THAT ARE TRULY TRUE AT HEART ❤️….NOW WHY WOULD YOU JUST SET OUT AND FIRE 🔥 ON THIS MAN… SO IT WAS A DRIVE BY SHOOTING EVIDENTLY! OUR BLACK PEOPLE! NEEDS TO STOP 🛑 AND COME TOGETHER AND PULL TOGETHER!! NOT BE ALL SCATTERED ABOUT EITHER YOU’RE TRYING TO KILL OR HURT SOMEBODY ESPECIALLY OUR LIL KIDS WHO GETS CAUGHT UP IN THE CROSSFIRE! WE NEEDS A NATIONAL HOLIDAY FOR STOP 🛑 THE VIOLENCE! IT IS TO MUCH AND IT IS OUTTA HAND! IT HAS BEEN OUTTA HANDS FOR YEARS! AND NOBODY LIKE POLITICIANS SEEMS TO CARE! WHEN THINGS START HITTING THEIR 🏡 HOUSEHOLDS! THEN THEY ARE GONNA WANNA DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! OTHER THAN THAT…WE THE PEOPLE OUR PEOPLE ARE ALL WE GOT! REAL TALK! MY CONDOLENCES GOES OUT TO THIS YOUNG MAN AND HIS ENTIRE CHURCH ⛪️, FAMILY, FRIENDS, CLASSMATES, HIS CHILDREN, HIS COWORKERS, NEIGHBORS, NEIGHBORHOOD AND ASSOCIATES FAR NEAR AND WIDE…I PRAY TO THE LORD THAT YOU MAY REST IN SWEET PEACE WITH THE LORD OUR GOD OUR HEAVENLY FATHER…🌹🌹🌹🌷🌷🌷💐💐💐🪴🪴🪴

Damn😤 This one a hurt peace I was just listening to 3way. Rest up Dolph. Long time fan everyone stay safe out there P.R.E 💯gang
All these celebs tweeting apart of the system. Sacrificing their family for money.   Seems Dolph recently exposed the system with his latest album, seems most of you still sleeping though. Learn to read between the lines.   His first post on Instagram about his new album,   “You can’t provide for your FAMILY without MONEY, and you can’t make MONEY without making SACRIFICES”   He put emphasis on this because to gain fame, success and massive amounts of money in the industry, you have to sacrifice close family and friends. Not rocket science when your not sleeping and distracted.   THEY WILL PAY SOMEONE FROM THEIR CITY TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE BLACK ON BLACK HATE CRIME. THIS ONLY EVER WORKS IN FAVOUR OF THE SYSTEM. I BET PEOPLE HAVE DIED ALREADY BECAUSE OF THIS EVENT.   MAY GOD REST HIS SOUL AND PROTECT HIS CHILDREN 😤
RIP… thank God I’m not a rapper or famous 🙏🏽
I'm sorry just another n...a dead this one had money tho
Damn man this happened to fast 💨💔🩸😭😭
It was his fault but RIP
Big fan RIP Dolph you will be missed dearly
It’s crazy to think that the unavoidable truth of this world is how so many ppl perish. Things like this definitely and should be avoided if and when necessary
Yo Gotti anybody????
Damn man, not Dolph

RIP DOLPH

Cant be real!!!
Just listened to his music for the first time.  What a bunch of amoral and depraved bullshit that was.  He seems to have embodied everything that is wrong with the black community, and met the same fate that so many young black men do because of that culture.  I see no big loss here.
this is really heart breaking because i’m from memphis
Rip
Behold a pale horse
Where was he Security @

I always thought he had a BEAUTIFUL family. I swear it hurts my heart when I see these young black men being killed like this. 💔 Prayers to his fans, loved ones, and most importantly his children. May God comfort them all.   And just like Safaree said in a tweet in regards to this incident, the streets/hood is PATHETIC. Taking out your own will never be the wave. Rest in Power, Dolph.
Rest Easy King gone to early
Want be too many like you DOLPH REST EASY MY GUY
Sorry but when u make it sorry going back to the hood we came from there that’s it u can give back without going back
He always felt like someone would set him up if you listen to 100 shots he knew
RIP dolph you will be missed. But you should have stayed out of Memphis bro you made it big you didnt have to go back to that God forsaken city of evil
I’ve never heard them say a word about him before
Wow

Rip Dolph 🎶🎶🎶
Media: You have any thought BLM: Nawl he wasn't white I don't care  🤣🤣🤣
R.I.P He was Juice Wrlds Cousin I know their family is hurting I pray for them
Same way they want us to beleive Nipsey got killed in his own city on his own block. Lol this wasn't a gang hit or about a robbery. They were gods in their home cities no matter which colors they rocked. This was something deeper that has been going on in the industry for a long time.
I wish I get support like this before I die  y’all be safe out here❣️❣️
How is he dead but rappers like lil pump still kicking just fine.R.I.P  Dolph
Right before thanksgiving no respect for CMG
Making millions and can't keep they ass out the streets, period, that's why he died. Damn shame, another one.
Damn damn daammmnn
If it ain’t one thing it’s a mf nother‼️‼️‼️ Condolences to your family and everyone in your life💐 R.I.P DOLPH 🐬 RUN IT BACK TO BACK TO BACK UP ⬆️ THERE‼️‼️
What?!! This is un-real! I really liked him, his music...Rest in Peace, Dolph.
Right I’m sick asf I can’t even listen to his music
Bad thing  about killing the body...you can't repent...so that mightve been it for him
Rest in peace
💔this one really did hurt smh that’s so sick I’m still hurting.
Dam Dolph !!!!
May his soul find peace.  Like he said in his verse, his kids kids will be set for life.  They will not be wanted for nothing.
MAKAVELI SHITT...
Glock going crazy 😞🤦
just dont understand it, people quote the most violent, shoot-em-up-bang-bang lyrics when they're in their car or in the club, the fans make songs that preach genocide #1 on the charts but when someone gets killed these same fans are in complete disbelief. How? Every day you listen to music that glorifies murder. Literally every time a song is playing in your vicinity, there's at least 1 reference to murder. We have to stop this. RIP to the man but why do people front like they just cant understand whats going on. These days a hip hop artist cant even be relevant without consistently glorifying murder in his music..Battle rappers constantly trade lines about how they're going to kill each other, it might be artistically delivered, but its still the same. We live in a murder death culture and we call the spirits everyday, but when they come we act surprised.
Wow R.I.P😩❤️
36 isn't that 666?
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🇯🇲
Noooo
woooow smh
This can't be real his music inspired me so much.
Rip cousin
Gotti got some young shooter to do it , jealous of his success.
🙏🏼 Rest In Power Dolph! 🐬
They been trying to get bro for the longest, Smh rip
Will there be a Black Lives Matter protest for his murder?
He was sacrificed
Rap Culture and homicide go together like cookies and cream boy I tell you SMH
Here after watching this video on Joseph Morris Channel. Why..R.I.P
Man you was a Boss R.I.P ITs DOLPH ‼️‼️‼️

WHAT'S WRONG WITH BLACK PEOPLE
Smh
3rd times the charm. Dude knew his ops/haters were gunning for him, so why would you let yourself be caught lacking driving around in a vehicle EVERYONE knows you're in, and casually stopping to a local store as if you don't have to be looking over your shoulder🤦🏽‍♂️. Smh all this senseless killing has to stop and most these artist  need to realise that when you're at a certain level if fame,  you need to move different and not drop your gaurd.
*Keep it real with yo-self no matter what*  *Preach*  *RIP*
Rip dolph
Bruh WHAT

He shouldn't beef with Soulja Boy
Damn. ...down goes another one...
Fuck the streets bruh, they don’t love you at all, smh, bruh been doing his shit too, “that’s a damn shame”

Gone too soon 😖. Rest Peacefully Dolph🖤💔
Listened to him everyday…this one hurt…
They hate to see a winner😔rip another legend
REST IN POWER... HE DID HIS JOB
I'm truly heartbroken 😭😭😭
Ripppppp
“Fuck it” hit so different, 100 shots was the anthem, and on the river was a certified classic…another legend gone to silly beef and dispute over money and status…R.I.P to Dolph
😂😂😂
Dam homie...R.I.P.  may karma catches up with the perpetrator who did this!!!   🤞💪🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
People really need to get real about the violence we do to ourselves in black communities. Theres a toxic mentality we don't like to address. Man got killed in his own city like Nipsey. And they ain't the only ones either. Dude spent his life grinding to make it big. Only to finally succeed and die to nonsense like this.
May your soul find peace king ✌🏾💜
We smoking on dat dolph pack tonight bois!
Tf where is key glock statement
RIP Dolph😇
Aaaa dayum  RIP Dolph ❤️🙏🙏🙏
I have no words. RIP King Dolph 👑

Really Sad
Black and Black don't love each other and then they wonder why other people can't relate... let that sink in for you people. Rip Dolph.
Dolph aint dead he transformed to sum but ion kno wat. He not DEAD tho
Rip bro
Why do we keep glorifying this gangsta shit in our community, only to put in hard work to get out the hood and get gunned down. We gotta start spreading positivity to our youth because it will be an endless cycle. Honestly Why are we fighting each other Bruhh
We all need to follow Jesus, our life is as a vapor one minute we here than next we gone forever .
OMG ! RIP Dolph🥺 Another talented black man gone too soon! 🕊🕊🤍🤍🤍🤍
Rip dolph
You get money it's like don't show love to your home town you always got some hater in the cut waiting I hope that shooters go too fucking hell 😥😥😥😥

RIP a sacrifice period https://youtube.com/shorts/qJ1Z3enjuMU?feature=share
Mfs be mad cause they didnt make it in the world. haters everywhere!🙏🙏🙏
I keep telling people no amount of fame can save you when there's still people in the streets that's hungry for what you got.
This one definitely hurts RIP 🐬 😢
I know souja boy and Yo Gotti happy asl right right now
Take some advice from the ogs once you get that money and fame get out of your hometown
Nearly every other week I go online I hear of another rapper being killed. It's like people are trying to bring the music to an end. These rappers need to hire armed guards.
*NO SUPRISE BOTTOM FEEDERS HATE RIP* for those who did it you get *NO CRED*
Ball in Paradise Dolph Gabana  another real one gone
If you become very successful leave your neighborhood and never return. Jealousy and Envy is real and it's dangerous.  The same community that you're trying to help is plotting against you.
No lie am fuckin sad he was a star RIP YOUNG DOLHP
So black folks? You still think cops are the problem in this world when it's your own peoples

It’s been many moons since I’ve heard of folk getting out and actually having a one on one round(fight) ! Now days it’s hating, shooting and internet beef ….Smh RIP to the young man and may healing energy find his family.
