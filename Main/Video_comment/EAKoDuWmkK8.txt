Peter cake
2:32 😂
That fail so cringe
Ksi got fouled how did the ref miss that lol
Well well well 🤔🤔🤔
well well well
Bro got cooked and youtube recommended me this 💀
ksi standing INSIDE the goal is what makes me angry 😂 yall trash x but doesnt ksi have soccer in their life for very long. how can u stand IN the goal lil bro, if speed wouldve shot directly in his hands its still a goal if he stand IN the goal 😂😂😂
They invited bro for 2025 and he's hitting the double digits this around, Skeleton Yashin isn't here to play
When is the next match???
5:34 bro is on 999 ping
😂 the goalkeeper from YTAS like a goalkeeper from women's footballs club   🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If you take one step forward , your chances of saving that goes up by 90% -Gianluigi Buffon
curving top net ball lmao
Wonder what triggered it
I mean the defense seamed just as lacking as xqc. Many of the guys on defence just started walking whenever the ball got past a certain point.
Clown laughing at Kai offside as if he did not drop the worst rating of 0.3
xQc should learn how to dive and he will actually be decent at goaler lol
Reading his chats awful ball knowledge is so funny
Brother, don't justify yourself or make excuses, we all saw what happened
ur awful in nets bro
Bro was born whith negative status, its not HIS fault. Jidion is literally a woman on a mans body 🤭
JUst admit it bro youre shittttt at football thats it
Ive had 4 knee surgeries, and 2 hip surgeries. and still can play better goalie than x.
them anime knees😂😂
simon said he would bring back xqc if he trains he would be in the 2024 match
nah this guy sucks
Lol Xqc didn't have a good game, but his defense didn't help him much tbh. Jdion was hell bound on selling lmao
Xqc suck bro
Must be hard to watch😢
why would u go to goalkeeper its 1 of the hardest positions in soccer and doesn't help when you're inexperienced
"will xqc have xqses" xd
"he reverse suiiiiied him" 💀
My question is why does he look like he got shot everytime sidemen scores?
Bro the Red team Defence is dogshit ... awful team play
chris md is a fcking footballer as a profession HE IS LITERALLY GOOD
ricky berwick would have made a better keeper
to be fair, xqc's defender's were garbo
eu ppl aren’t real just drones
To be fair xQc defenders were terrible in this game
Am surprised that XQC knows the backpass rule,penalty and offside rules.Hope we can see him again next year and he will be manuel neuer by then.
also chonks also chonks
0.3 bro nahh
xqc (excuse see)
I feel like I am watching in 2× 😂
You can tell how young sidemen fans are by the way ksi was acting here. Trying so hard to get speed a goal and scoring own goals
"Xqc more like Xqses" is crazy💀
Love u keep pushing
One of funniest videos ever😂
nah man the chat thinking they could save the harry shot is funny..how they're saying lag like that ball was slow
Tariq goals: 1 Ishowspeeds goals:0 Tariq on top Calma Calma🤫🤫🤫🤫
so bad omegalul
X and Jidion combo for the worst combo ever.
I love how he calls it a goaler😂
bro someone get xQc out he is so god damn annoying and is really irrelevant, irritating and just god awfully annoying to watch
Worst goalkeeper humanity has ever witnessed.
0.3 💀
26:48 I spend 30 minutes triming this part, it was worth all lotions and tissues 😭
xQc training montage with Ben foster let’s get it done
dont let minecraft skeleton be goalie
xquses
15:51 WTF? That was offside as fuck! WTF happened there with the referies?
Bro did great and had even better excuses
To be honest, your defense was terrible. More than half the goals were because defense mistakes.
Excuses...
idk all the rules but wtf is that offside shit like bro your going at the goal ... off what side? can he not just kick it like i woulda been like kai aswell confused when they told me offsides like brother i hit no side..
HE CAN PICK IT UP IN A DANGEROUS PLAY. he played pretty well for his first performance. Legit, it was so much fun to watch
That blue goalkeeper has high ping
For a guy that’s never really played soccer/football and spend most of his time streaming video games, I think he had a solid effort and I’d like to see him come back in 2024 with some improvement to his game. Fair play Xqc not bad at all.
xQc, you can use your legs to block the shots
Bruh just admit you're Shit at Football and Fifa
My little sister wouldve done better
Did you make a single save???
You are straight trash
Keeper diff
bro cant catch SKILLL ISSSUEEEE BUTTER FINGERS
I still remember the day he was ROASTING pie and calthedragon for their goalkeeping skills and somehow he became a bigger clown than both of them
2:30 he’s actually right, mad
I did not expect xqc to actually understand football but I'm glad to say I'm pleasantly surprised.
To be honest, most of the shots that he didn't catch are pretty hard to react to. The one at the 8:11 is literaly a penalty shot which pro goalkeepers just guess mostly.
Bros the worst goalie I have ever seen XQC don't touch another football
I never laughed so much. Brilliant.
not my streamer 💀look at that femboy gameplay
For someone that clearly hasn’t ever played football, it was a very brave move for you to go in for the full game at goalkeeper. You had to do a lot more than JJ and didn’t make some of the mistakes that even he made as a Brit! Great analysis of your performance and decent understanding of the game. Hope you get the call to be gk again next year and you’ve gained a fan from this vid
21:21 you’re right again, would have been a pass back
At 20:55 you say “hugging the left wall”. Thats correct as a goalkeeper! You can not concede on your near post, you were both right to do that
That’s true for the 4th goal, it would be a pass back and a direct free kick, you’re right to not pick up the ball
I’ve never seen this guy before this charity match but his excuse for the first goal, not realising the ref would play the advantage does make sense and at least it does show that he’s done his research on the game! Fair play to the lad, obviously not familiar with English sports but cares enough to spot the mistakes in his game
Harry scored a banger btw
How was Simon not off-sides🤣
You did fine for someone with no experience. You covered the corners good. Its a agility problem
18:15 :))
Honestly, I commend him for coming out and giving it his best try for charity.
Bro was talking about how bad Memo Ochoa is well look at him in the charity match
so bad
Chat does not know the back pass rule smh🤦‍♂️
XQC actually if he practices he'll be absolutely amazing! He has been by far the goalie yet and as Simon has said you don't want the goalie to be really good.
i find it so funny that he tries to make excuses for how poor he played. at 9 30 alone bro is where he realistically shouldve just owned up to it and said that okay, he shouldve really been able to catch the ball but didnt. him saying its hard to catch the ball, its not really. take it from someone who doesnt play football but has been in goal before for little kickabouts in the past, catching the ball is actually quite easier than reaching for the ball. even diving for the ball is far easier. i do understand his lack in sport is why he played so poorly here but at the same time, catching, punching the ball away, tryna kick it away, sending it out for the corner or diving into it are all better options here. yet again from someone whos rarely ever played football them selves and has been in goal before, i even no what to do in goal. on one hand yes theres alot of pressure as ur the last defense and comes down on u realistically to save the shots being made but on the other hand if u dont put enough into it and not properly attempt saves, then ur going to let alot in which showed here.
I remember when he said gk was easy last charity match now he lets in 8 goals😂😂😂😂
Seeing his entire chat constantly telling him all the wrong information is so painful to watch….
I used to play substitute keeper, I know how hard it is. But that 3rd goal... you need to move to stop the ball... ;) ;)
Bro honestly, i think you did alright for your first time. Hopefully they will get you again next year and it can be the redemption of XQC
He didnt even do that bad considering it was his first time
The whole defense literally only consisted of X. His whole team was just afk...
iShowMeat has the kick power of a toddler, wtf
you need to play again next fkn year!💀
For a guy that don't play ill give you 10/10 for effort keep your head up and go again
Your chat has no idea what's it's like to stand in that goal. They only see the direction of the ball not every other variable. Like other people running on the opposite side so you have to think "Ok will he pass and the other guy will shoot or will he shoot." As soon as you make a decision it might be over. It's not as simple as they make it out to be, they are a bunch of Fifa players it's not the same.  I hope they invite you again, you should practice in time if they do.
Someone please teach XQC direct and indirect passes!
0.3
Excuse no more excuses
Anyone criticizing xqc i would fucking love to see you morons even try to comprehend how football is supposed to be played nevermind actually playing it
Oh god so this is what XQC look and sounds like these days.... kids.. don't do drugs.
XQC you were amazing, please come back next year!
U did good for first time better next year 👏
bro shut up with all this exqces 😂how did you even get a 0.3 its should be 0.0 or -0.3
He only was to blame twice, when he spitted the ball to Manny and then when he didn't communicate with Jidion and passed it to Tobi 2/8 isn't that bad
Honestly, if xqc saved 1 many 2 of the goals, he would be the "perfect" amount of good for a charity match like this
Excuses 😂
Will XQC have XQses
Thank you for participating although you didn't do great you raised a lot for charity. Secondly although it's clear you haven't played much soccer/football you did what was to your abilities.  Thirdly ask to come back, do so practise and show every one.  But thank you XQC for playing
You so noob ,,team lose
it wasnt that you did bad, just that you gave the guys from last year a time.
xQc got hated but he did good actual. We need him back for 2024 💯. Gotta do some legs💪and get that agility up📈
his explinations for everything is hilarious, bro said the enemy team 💀
You did just fine for a beginner
That Harry goal he is not expected to save at all. If he got a hand to that it’d be incredible
xQc will allways have excuses
I just watched the least athletic person on the planet play goalie in a soccer game lol. My god man. That was brutal to watch. What’s even more brutal is that my guy doesn’t realize it 😂😂😂😂
Celebrating because you scored on a person that’s never been goalie before or played soccer in his life is CRAZY to me tho 😭😂😂
Celebrating because you scored on a person that’s never been goalie before or played soccer in his life is CRAZY to me tho 😭😂😂
Ik he’s probably dealing with shit in his personal life from the whale but I’m glad he can find comfort in streaming and completely selling as a goalie 🫶🏻 xqcL
Excuses
KSI veyyyy athletic 😮‍💨
holy shit,      I didnt know that xQc was so,          shit at football.
Fat guy got xqc fkedup 😂
Coach of his team definitely does not want him back in goals. Said as much. 😂😂
Speeds misses were absolute gold 😂 his face after xqc conceded on the counter attack 😂
That penalty should be retaken because KSI wasn't staying on the goal line.
The people who were clowning on him in the chat most likely would't even fare as good as he did as a goalkeeper also probably don't know anything about football
FUCK THE HATERS🖕🖕 Good game brotha!
bro Jidion just threw the entire game
wasnt he talking bad about the previous goalkeepers lol?. its what he deserves
Bro keeps trying to explain we all know he is just shite
Imagine if x goes on a gym arc for real this time and builds godlike muscle and also trains as a goalie as a side quest for a whole year.        Yeah that wouldnt happen 💀
Watching this felt like half an hour learning about football with xQc. You should definitely be back next year, with a bit of practice you'll be better then cal the dragon and pieface combined!
For a goblin who barely breathes fresh air i think he did well.
my respect for x after this event has gone up soooooo much
Next year the number on his shirt ought to be 0.3 and we better see a comeback
❤ you did us proud X, football is hard
The only case you cannot pick up the ball is when a team mate is passing or throwing (if the ball left the field) the ball in a controlled and intentional way towards the own keeper. Otherwise you did well xQcW
BAWLLLL WUZZ CURVINNNN'
Him calling teammates friends and the adversary enemies 😂😂
Being a goalkeeper is the hardest position on the pitch and any mistake means its a goal. X tried and thats what matters considering it was a bit of fun.
XQC YOU DID VERY GOOD.... IM PROUD OF THE SAVES YOU MADE
Never watched him livestream but he got my respect for playing that well for someone who have never kicked the ball. I'd blamed the team for not having enough good defenders and none of the good players wanting to play in the backline.
Why chat is very bad tho. I think he's doing great job for charity match keeper
EXCUSE C WHO EVER CAME UP WITH THAT IS FUCKING brilliant
Lol XQC brought SO much to the match. Was great seeing him out there despite having barely any experience, ready to have memes made about any mess ups. But bro you did well. The whole point was charity and you brought so much! Also loved seeing a relaxed down to earth X on Side+. Some of those guys you played with and the Sidemen are a great influence and though you’re killing it, obviously, the human side of it…. People like the sidemen are a good influence in that sense dud. Thanks for bringing so much entertainment and for putting yourself out there. Major kudos
For a person who haven't played football before as a goalie and just learned some of the rules in a hurry he played as expected from him and even better, hence he tried his best not to break the rules he just learned and tried  jumping to the ball, not getting scared
too hard on himself honestly, i'd say 5 goals out of 8 are impossible for him to stop (and for any other youtuber turned goalie for the first time , goals 3/4/5 should be saved ), was fun to watch tho, hope he's going back next year
is he playing again?
JJ and xQc in goal made the whole match a lot more fun
Jidion was too funny even tho he didn’t mean to 😂 bro was out there like a cartoon character that got lost and ended up on the pitch
Wqc footy is fun to play so glad you got to get a chance too on such an insane stage as well!!
Xqc sucks
I actually wanna see an 12 month transformation for the juicer. If 12 months can turn speed into a finesse demon than I think it can make X a brick wall.
props to him for going out of his comfort zone
XQC played quite well. When comparing two goal keepers JJ had the support of good defence players. Harry , Cal , ginge . But there wasn’t a good support like that to XQC.
For the first time playing the hardest role in soccer/football X did pretty damn well.  I played goalie for a couple mobths and i can confirm that the balls come way faster than you think.
really hope he plays again
with all due respect, he wasn't that bad, it should've been a 0.6 rating
Redemption arc now for next year?
Hopefully xqc realises soon he should go epstein
Bout time he used to diss all the keepers and say they suck but guess what it one of the hardest roles to play in the sport is keeper lol
XQC needs to come back next year
From 8 shots on the net, x saved 0
Look at the defenders on the second goal, half of them just stop and the others have terrible positioning and offer no pressure
Chat really has no idea how football works, I’m confident 90% of them have never actually played in a proper 11 aside game before
xqc is better than callthedragon call stinks xqc way better and xqc had bad defenders
xQc performed above expectations, to be real i never dove after a ball in my life and this guy actually gave it a proper effort. Respect for that.  And as for the back-pass rule "a goalie may not handle the ball after an intentional pass from a teammate" so in the situation where it was on the goal line that was a save and not a pass so i assume it would be safe to pick it up.
for a Canadian you held your own pretty well against a few lads that play a lot of football you could have done a lot worse
We gonna ignore the fact speed just gets drenched tryna have a drink 😂😂😂😂
XQC ? More like x-cuses
I want to see XQC again next year with Improvement and training
You did good, you went all in thats what matters.
Don't get why some of these people in the comments taking this shit seriously, they talking shit like "XQC Deserved this!!!! >:(" When it's literally a charity match. They don't care bout winning or loosing all that much it was literally for pure fun. XQC doesn't care that much if he did shit nor does Cal the dragon when XQC insulted the last years goal keepers. Like you lot taking this shit personally and speaking for the other goalies when they literally couldn't be bothered either lmao
Nah though fr he was literally playing against actual pros. Their team literally really only had Chrismd who could hit shots and Theo sort of. Their team had Manny, Tobi and Simon, They have been playing that sport their entire lives and are literally known for being good at football
Bro reacted as if he wasn’t there during the whole match 😂😂😂
His bad saves are only some time into the last half aside him dropping the ball, im pretty sure his rating is for jokes. He's right about speed too, many players agree speed had a good game aside from his strikes. Also i don't think they should've kept manny in there when theo got injured it was a pretty terrible decision against allstars, it was because manny obviously needed to be in there as a og  sidemen football player but they should've replaced him with tobi and go back and forth. Jidion was also most definitely wrong for running into the goal keeper like that 😂
Best part of this entire video was the person in chat who said EXCUSE C's
Xcusie out here like “my controller disconnected!”
They could all be 20% as good and it would still be really entertaining!
Its ur first game, infront of a live british crowd!! U did way better than u give urself credit for dude
To be fair, where's the defence? And the amount of balls that was hit by the Allstars that bounced off them to their goal...
15:50 morons in chat calling this offside😂
I think you should play PRO CLUBS on fifa 23 and you should be a keeper
Makes a 15 min vid into a 30 min reaction 😂
Nah cause it actually is just perspective. I thought he was TRASH and then I watched WillNE’s GoPro POV and it changed everything
Xqc explaining football when he doesnt even understand football is hilarious
Not a single save 💀
Laughing at kai so hard, trash ass goalie 😂😅
L’hockey est meilleur! Lol
The fact you called the opposing team the "enemy" whilst explaining the pass back rule makes you such a gamer 😂😂 ❤ big respect to you man, was a very entertaining game of football.. And takes huge balls to go in goal in front of 60000+ people in an English football ground..
tbh you did good job for the newbie. you did your best. not a fan of yours,  but hopefully see you next year at charity match.
People who hate on xQc's ability as a goalie clearly haven't seen Cal the dragon last year lmao. xQc was way better.
Its nice to see xqc being physically active😂
8:36
2:40 in a real match that’s not for charity they would have stopped play.. also I’m from the UK and watch a lot of football and most of your chat would of saved most of them shots so don’t stress
i love how he takes every criticism seriously because he doesn't know football. for example there was no way he was saving harry's shot but chat blames him to troll hahahah
Bro doesn't have to be so hard on himself, Manny is practically a semi-pro. Simon is a technical genius and Tobi is a goat. Hope they have him next year again, everyone really seemed to enjoy each other vibes.
xqc did good nonetheless  better than I expected
I just subscribed to your chanel, hope to see you back next year 💯
idk who was worse xqc or speed 😭😭😭😭
XQC SUCKS HE THREW
Loved that you went through with it in the end. 👏👏👏
I don't know if you have ever played soccer irl, but I thought you did a great job!!! You don't need to explain yourself to anyone, you were great!!! :)
To be fair. Xqc was not that good. But he really wasn’t bad either. Manny goals nobody would’ve saved it tbf
holy shit chat does NOT know what offside is
when you realise the skill of the sidemen team and the skill of the YouTube all-stars keepers, its always going to be a mismatch, qxc did fine for his ability tbh
1st Manny goal was right at him and also the goal Tobi scored was avoidable. The rest aren't on him tbf.
My guy didnt commit to any dive in the first half
Big ups for everything xqc you did your ting my man be proud of urself
Is it or Does xqc got some autism?
He has to come back next year😂😂
13:09 when you dont have coonfidence in your defence stuff like this happens
Oh no.....
Very few people would save the shots from Harry, Chris, Simon, and Manny. Could close the space down better in the 1v1 tho
Last year Xqc was making fun of goal keepers so karma finally got him 😂
XQC MORE LIKE XQ CESS 🤓☠️💀💀
Ngl I thought i Kai was average height but nahhh why is he so small 😅😅 he legit looks like a teenager in front of the others 💀
It was actually fun seeing xQc playing in the match. Amazing selection. Fair play x. Hope to see you in the next charity match.
you did beter than alot of your viewers would have done. sidemen play alot of football there not bad so to even save one is good
so badddd
xqc and jidion overall iq -21
Big ups Xqc for showing up and trying, Goalie in any sport is hard especially when you’ve never even played that sport. Doing it infront of 60 thousand is even harder so w X for his not so good performance still helped put on a show. 😭
omg the chat is so supportive
.
xqc is so ass
why didnt that first goal count
Imagine an xQc and Ben Foster collab, training our boy up!
xQc actually didnt do that bad considering it was his first time keeping in a proper game
Bro you need to come back again! You were great! Especially for a person who is playing in goal for the first time!
He lied as always, so never take any life advice from this tool.
only if his teammate PASS it back  with purpose than he can not pick up
watching a streamer who knows very little about football explain rules to a chat that has clearly never played the game will never not be funny
The chat bullying him tho, i can't 😂 when jidion hit the ball tho xqc wasn't allowed to pick it up he's right
0.3/10 and people are saying " you did great ". How about we start telling the truth instead of pandering like sheep? That was god awful in every way. 4 or 5 would have been a great effort, 0.3 is abysmal.
I like how everyone wants to shit on Americans for not knowing soccer (football). That's why the US is 11th in the world now. Everyone just want to hate on Americans cause we basically own every sport and we're slowly taking over soccer as well. I hope the US wins a World Cup soon just to stick a middle finger up to the rest of the world for winning a sport we don't give a shit about
ngl u didn't even play that bad
cosmetic goalie
You and Jidion were playing for the other team for sure.
Try to be in the next game aswell, it's fun to watch you play, but if cal the dragon is the gk maybe you can be the sub.
I don't know why everyone is complaining about xqc, he did pretty well for someone who's never done this before
You should really just take the year, get a goalkeeping coach and practice for 12 months. Surprise everyone at the next one. That'd be dope
it was a joy to watch you play :)
Goat keeper  😂
XQC is a tragedy to watch 🤣🤣💀💀. Why tf was he even in this match let alone in goal. Made his team’s chances go from not great to bad
xQc couldn't save a word document
id love to see you do some work with goalkeepers over the next year and have some of the american team mates take shots against you and then come back next year as a whole new goaler.
Xqc had horrible defense a lot of good keepers would’ve struggled. I would say he needs to close the distance in 1v1s and work on his positioning but other than that solid performance. Never saw him give up on a dive and just let it go through. Props
As a fan of both the UK Youtube scene and xQc, I find him giving shout-outs to some of his teammates cute af
I think he should take the blame fully for 2 or 3 goals but can't fault him too much for the other ones.
Everyone trashing xQc for doing bad, but big shout to him for even going out to play with the lads anyways!
would love to see xqc irl stream himself training and trying to improve his football skills for the next match, he did okay for someone who spends his whole time streaming xqcL
lmao right after he says he would have saved the deflection he sees himself miss a shot right at him priceless
Bro finally touched grass....... hope you play again
This here is XQC having ExCuSes! HAHAHAHA Stephen you fckn goat
To be honest, considering you had no real practice and the fact most goals came from the better players, I would say you did okay, with Manny/Harry top bins, you cannot really stop them... you didn't need to make an excuse, just give them props on being really good... I doubt anyone saying you did poorly could do much better against, Tobi, Simon, Manny and Harry (when he gets a shot) All of them score against Ben Foster and he used to be in Premier league...   You did okay in perspective, but you didn't really do well 🤣
Was his rating for the game actually 0.3?
yo x actually knows ball all the thishis say is exactly right speed did take alot od pressure off there defence and for you Xqc please just get a few lessons and practice in and prove everyone wrong you have the abiluty all you needis to learn your positionin and diving a bit and you will do bits bro ipromise
Lol
XQC PLAYING WAS WAS THE MOST W’s in yt shit was fire
I know he conceded 8 but a few goals were just really good and also his defence did not help at all
We needed Mr baker- xqc
Tbf the majority of shots were spot on and I think a 0.3 was hella harsh
respect for participating at all
Bro you tried your best 😂😂 @xQc
Im so gassed that xQc and the english youtube lot have crossed paths. What a link up.
the people in chat dont know how goalie works and it shows
People who don't play football,  just keep your mouth shut. He played well as a person playing for first time.
You know what, His positioning was actually really good and some of his dives but it is his first time in net what's so suprising. If you're going to call him bad call the defence terrible. Half of these runs shouldn't get through
when are you gonna apologise to cal the dragon
You actually did really well considering you've never played before, was against a really strong team AND considering how hot it was.
Decent
tbh X was decent in goal considering its his first.
I still think xqc would have done better than most of his audience😂 his chats so goofy 90% of the time
nah if it wasn't for manny which he actually plays football, it's unfair for him to be on sidemen
W was actually better than I thought he’d be 😂
It is still ok. This was your first match. The pressure between a real match and a practice match is massive.
Boss, you did well as for someone who don’t play. It was for great reason.
People always exaggerating. You did good, in terms of commitment, likewise Speed, people are too quick to call someone shit and then oversee the positives
Not ppl saying he did WELL for no experience, lmao he couldn’t have done worse 🤣🤣
I hope he plays next year, of course with a lot more time to train, maybe even a GK coach?
Lazer was patting josh's back during that ethans goal celebration lol.
21:42 coca cola
X needs to give himself more credit he did a great job for the amout of practice he had
It takes heart to watch that again.. goalkeeping is the hardest position to play in.. one mistake and it's game over..  you did well
i dont get a word that he is saying
if felix plays again in the charity hes gonna carry TRUST ME
for xqcs first time he did decent just a tip is that you can pick up the ball if your teammate touches it unless they directly pass to you. Example: your teammate kicks it incorrectly and it goes to you, as long as your teammates dont pass to you on purpose you can pick it up. Only time you cant pick it up is if your teammates pass to you on purpose unless its a header, if a teammate headers the ball to you on purpose you can still pick it up
Didn't block a single shot 😂
"Will Xqc have Xqses?" HAHAHAH
you fkin sucked bro looool
bro is talking like he could play football :) hahahah ^^
the people in chat who are unironically clowning on him have never played or seen a football match in their life and would not even do half as good as him if they played.       like xqc when he clowned on cal the dragon
To be fair, 80% of shots this year were better than anything from last year, xQc did a great job considering what he was up against. The 0.3 rating is an absolute crime honestly, anyone with two good eyes could see that his positioning and reflexes were still miles better than whatever the hell Callum or Pieface managed last year.
Literally ExcuseC
Rewind to last year when you was laughing your ass off about the goalkeeper 😂😂😂😂
For your first sidemen game you did great looking forward to the next one will you come back again 👍🏻
the timing of Stephen amazing commentary was phenomenal. 3:41
I really don't understand why he's trying so hard to explain himself in front of his twitch chat, that is pretty much filled with underage kids or with teenagers that just stay in their house all the time and either watch twitch or play games all day.
why does he sound like he knows what hes saying
That chat is cancer
XQC should try and attend as goalie for next years match and add in a few more training days. He’ll be a lot better and more confident
26:52 GYATTTT
You have the right build and natural movement to make q good keeper, imagine if u trained and come back next year
The question is, did you fell in love with the sport yet?
Great video mate, i rate it a 0.3/10
ur js bad cuzzo
You need to learn the details of the backpass rule. 1. No penalty if you pick it up from a backpass, it will be an indirect free kick at the spot you pivked it up (or outside the 6 yard box if it was in). 2. You can pick up a loose ball if your teammate touched it last, only INTENTIONAL backpasses can not be picked up.
good to see the youtube comments section has bigger brains than the chat
One thing to note is that you can still pick up the ball if your teamate has touched if first, the rule only applies if it is an intended pass back to the goaler. For example, if an opponent is running through on goal and your defender slide tackles them and wins the ball, the goaler can go and pick the ball up, provided it is in the box. If your teamate directly passes it to you, then you are not allowed etc.
Huge respect for you to goalkeep with absolutely no game experience at all its the hardest thing to do. You were in the completely correct position for the first goal and 5/8 goals weren't your fault.
These comments are wild all of you saying x should’ve did better because of his athletic background have never played a sport or done anything impressive outside of a video game in your lives. It’s kinda sad how much y’all yappin
@2:35 you should have attacked the challenger and come towards him , actually on all the goals taken XQC was always too back in his net he didnt have any positioning
Fosh went frenkie de jong
You played great given your experience X. Literally you positioning was fine, just need experience.
to be fair tho yt defense was shit, like what was duke doing just standing around while manny cut in and scored
ex cu se is my favorite football player
xQses
I want to see a rematch so bad when he actually trains, would be so fun🔥
all jokes aside lets be honest... xqc was ass 🤣
so bad
New sub here
Excuse C
xQc's knowledge that the backpass rule exists but not knowing the full rule was a bigger issue than just not knowing it existed at all. I mean, he should still have picked the ball up for Tobi's goal, why on earth would anyone kick the ball that hard towards their own goalkeeper, even if you couldn't remember who kicked it?
Should be really proud of yourself X. You showed up having never really played football before, played the most unforgiving and difficult position on the pitch, did it all to the best of your ability and most of all helped raise millions for charity. You've certainly earned a new fan here my friend. Well done you!
His mouth speaks to much thn his game play 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
To be fair, XQC reacted well and was diving the correct way majority of the time.  I'd take him over Cal the Dragon again.
yeah but its calm honestly bro hes literally never played football ever and still did better than cal the dragon, he saved everything he could save except that one miss collection, least he didnt give 3 free goals like cal no offense to cal. Fairs to xqc ngl
As a first time goalee without prior experience, it's not bad, the Backline ould have done better to help, but still a good performance. Good Game
Bro stop caring what the trolls say. You actually had a good game with limited training or understanding of the game. Learn the rules more and maybe keep at it cause you definitely have talent and maybe next year you might get another invite
He’s tall, he needs to learn how to use his legs. Most of those low driven shots could have been saved by simply sticking his leg out (+better positioning ofc)
So bad
xqc actual imposter
Bro xQc must stop worrying about it. Yes, he wasn't amazing but it's his first time in Goal playing in front of like 60 000 people. It's not like JJ was much better and at least xQc didn't roll over the line with the ball.
Man everyone knows you don'T sub in a player just for the penalty. Even most pro players can't handle the pressure.
Bro was ass
As much as i want to make fun of him, most of these shots were very hard to save. You don't get it if you never played football. The goal is way bigger than it looks like and a decently placed shot with the right speed is very hard to save.
Im gonna call this guy qvc
Most people saying xQc was terrible actually have no idea how football works, yes he was pretty bad and gave away a couple of goals for free, but most of the shots wouldn't have been saved by the best goal keepers in the world. People need to realize that if there is a 1v1 between a player and a goal keeper, that is basically a free goal, and the only way it isn't is if the player fucks up. There is basically nothing xQc could do to save most of those goals, and the blame goes to the defenders.
Go agane next year, X. Would be interesting to see how you would do if you trained longer
Honestly if xQc trained goalie and his fitness for next year, as well as speed, it would be some crazy redemption arc if they could beat Sidemen
oh no hes even got a 0.3 emote
Big up for X for not ditching them and actually he came to play as goalie! well done X!
Jidion played worse than xqc 😂
Tbf some saves yeah he could’ve maybe saved but watch a pro game, it’s the defense that does it, if the d is terrible 1v1s are always bad for keepers
i think waterboy may be the play next year
Lil bro havent go outside the door even once
sideman have a skills vs non skill player maybe some have played at school actively, it was fun anyway. If everybody have time to train it will be alot different even goalies. Weird is why Mr beast was at sidemen :D
All new emotes would be so funny omE
Just give him Harry Pinero or anyone to help Fosh anchor the defense. Jidion was definitely not it and WillNE regressed so hard from last year.
Bro sleep on that door lmao
L fans
In all honesty, he tried his best but his team's defense gave up on helping like 80% of the times the opposition got possession close to the net
Considering you committed to save every shot thrown at you and didn't blame your team, you're already a step above CalTheDragon and Hughwizzy in terms of All Star goalkeepers, would love to see you back next year, welcome those bitches to the jungle!
No the biggest problem was that sidemen team are pretty much the same every year and they all play football occasionaly
😂😂😂😂, ur face cracks me up....lol....but to fair, first time! Give it a couple more game and ul will have better grip.
what is it with all the hate tho? for someone that doesnt know football and play for 60 k ppl and 2 mil online its decent if there were another charity next year bring him back
I want xQc back next year! You were fabulous for content and considering it’s your first time playing in something like this you weren’t the worst we’ve ever seen. You were alot of fun!
I think xQc was let down by his defence a little bit. Sidemen had a solid defensive game. Youtube allstars were not good defensively.
I dont know why yall flaming him so hard. You people are probably some fat ass bitches that doesnt go out. If you have ever played football you would know he didnt do that bad for his first time. And the defenders were trash no pressure on the fcking attacker. Almost all of it was a fcking 1v1. And the other goals were accurate shots. And he was playing with peop,e that has 20 fcking experience in football. Get off your high horse
To be fair, even if he's a pretty horrible goalie, having Jidion on defense is like
Guess xQc still has xqces
As far as I’m concerned X played to his best. There was t really much he could do for most of the goals, some weren’t even his fault. Being a keeper ain’t easy😅
You did well x 2 days of playing football and this was one of them hope to see you next year
You did well x 2 days of playing football and this was one of them hope to see you next year
ExCuse C
It was cool that XQC was a part of it!! ❤
To be fair, almost all of the goals were due to horrible defending. You did great.
I feel like Chunks caused half the goals against XQC's team by being a bad defender. Almost running against XQC, blocking another ball by running towards their own goal, stuff like that.
I'm sorry bro but they really need to bring in a better keeper next year. It's like the Sidemen purposely handicap the YouTube Allstars by giving them goalkeepers that have never played! As a goalkeeper myself, its entertaining and rage inducing to watch all at the same time.   KSI wasn't much better either to be honest.
as xQc’s *lawyer i would like to defend each goal he let in  Ethan’s goal: Jidion fucked up, and the defence let Ethan all the way up to the goal. Ethan never misses from that close  Simon’s goal: no one is even close to scoring as much as Simon in these matches, and it was a perfect play from Manny. no keeper saves that  Manny’s goal (1): theres no defending Felix, that should have been saved  Manny’s goal (2): he saved the more difficult shot but none of his defenders were there to pick him up and get the ball. Felix did nothing wrong  Tobi’s goal: should have been a Jidion own goal cause that was horrendous from him. you going out to get the ball wasnt the problem, and kicking it was the right choice even if you could pick it up, because you had teammates to pass to quickly  Manny’s goal (3): the fact Felix even got a finger on the ball was insane. great attempt  Harry’s goal: absolutely amazing finish. he played the defenders, he struck the ball perfectly. just a great goal. basically Filly’s goal in last years match, just not saveable  Tariq’s goal: Chunkz and Will fucked up, just a tough position. might be saveable but that late in the game it wasnt the end of the world, the game was going to be a loss anyways
Chat chat, not that I need to save the ball
Dude , practice , make videos of it, be the van der sar of next year
I saw everyone clowning XQC for fumbling the ball and letting goals in, but most of the goals weren't his fault as he hasn't trained and Jidion is a fkn clown. Only the ball spill was "his fault"
Great effort bro. That's one hell of a game to pick for your first game. Brave. Well done and be proud of the achievement
ethan looks so good man, what a journey from him
Only up from here, If he’ plays in next years match
That was a fun match to watch. One thing  I learned from this match is XQc is scared of Ball. Bro wasn't trying to protect the goal. He was just "don't hit me with the ball", "ahh the ball is coming to me qucik cover myself from the ball", *the ball hit him "ahhhh go away shooo shooo". ROFL
The worst defenders in the history of defenders, maybe ever.
X and Jidion kekw
How is bro laughing at others when he was the worst player on the pitch?
it aint even most his faults . most of the goals are mis communication and deflections that made it
21:25 u can pick it up because the touch wasnt deliberate.. if its a deliberate pass to u by foot then u cant touch by ur hand
Speed is fast like demon fast but his reactions are like dead horse.
what happened to castro?
"will xqc have excuses?" a few moments later. "xqc just being xqc"
Bro is worse than Kai 😂
Bros autistic goalie himself
Bro made every excuse under the sun
Also no harry panero for good defense why wasn’t he there 😞☹️
It would be amazing if he would train and come back next year to be a good goalkeeper
I have to give a big shout out to xQc here. Takes a lot of guts to play in front of so many people, in a sport you don't normally play, and specially as a goalkeeper.
I honestly respect the effort you gave XQC, big props!
They needa do basketball next year bro i wanna see x be the center
That 0.3 rating though.
Did you know max fosh (number 5) plays or played football in a team with prince William
Allstars defence was full of Harry Maguire's
you have a misconception about picking up the ball. A keeper can pick it up anytime within the penalty box during the play. Doesn't matter which team touched the ball beforehand.
I’m just proud of x for doing it. Also something he’s never done before it’s a w in my eyes. Commentators kept bashing him
I generally found the whole sidemen vs YouTube unfair, Sidemen have been doing footy content for years and play often, half of the YouTube team prepped for the game just days or weeks before the event for their first ever footy event. Mad ting, but for the content it’s good I suppose
Hope to see X in the next one! Maybe as an outfield player tho lol
For his experience, I think I would only expect him to save goals 3, 4 & 5
i love how they’ve just changed the name goalkeeper to goaler and everyone’s rocking w it
excuse c
xQc has the build of a goalkeeper he just needs to train xQcL
Xqc the best ❤ He will destory 2024 charity
would be cool to not have the offside rule for this event, would mean more goals and make things even more exciting lol
Being a keeper is hard but I think you did well pal
0.3 META
I mean, i would suck as a gk too as i never been in net. Its really hard being a goalkeeper, but im positive i would still save more goals than xqx
Cal the dragon walmart = xqc
So ass
What language does this guy speak?
dont worry bro.. you did good!! entertaining!!
ngl 0.3 is harsh he was fucking shit but not that bad😭
I think to be fair for your first game ever to be in front of 60,000 is rough and a lot of the goals,  while they look bad,  he didn't have much chance.   Most of Manny's you can't do much about.  When a guy who is more or less semi pro and gets a free shot from 8 yards,  no matter how much experience you're kind of fucked,  a 3 on none  fucked,  and lose balls bouncing around off players landing at opponents feet in the box also fucked.  Also if you're gonna watch a game with shitty players I think you kind of want the score to be high.
Xqc you are dog shit stick to talking shit behind a screen ur ass
Felix was covering the net and playing more like a Hockey goalie. He displayed his Canadian roots proudly in this game.
waaaaait what??? speed was bad??? ahahahaha these juicers are so dumb, speed was actually good compared to everyone else he was relentless but he lacked the confidence to finish, these juicers are so braindead lol but then again what did i expect from them.
NGL u were shit in the match
Chat saying thats Jidion's fault have never watched football. He did what you're supposed to do track the ball and stand where it is so no attacker can go around and nip it. Tobi was pressing. Thats 100% XQC's fault. Pick up the ball genius instead of kicking it on Jidion who's been standing right there for the last 5 seconds lmao. PICK UP THE BALL
23:37 lmao the way karl protected it from going in with his head was a good save
son mas malos que pegarle a una vieja
"I wanna see him grind and lift more than TYler1, grind in chess and win pogchamps, grind in football and see him play better", he ain't doing anything that's for sure.
13:30 my brother in Christ the ball traveled 75 yards what do you mean you didn't remember who kicked it last, why would a teammate kick the ball from that far at you😂😂😂😂
The fact that X remembered the back pass rule for someone that never play GK before and only touch a football days before the match, it quite commendable.
Nah tbf I play football (CAM/LW) and I’ve tried playing “goaler” before and those side shots you need a good dive and you’re not gonna get it from someone who’s never played sports before 😂😂😂
He played amazing even for a new goalie. Considering he was also against his team's defenders and midfielders.
Bro X convinced himself his performance was awful?! Football fans will see the ability you demonstrated under the pressure 10/10 times don’t listen to your chat.
he wasnt even that bad
You did good, you literally had no defence in front of you, they went missing for every goal ❤
bro all jokes and clowning aside, this guy had like 3 days of training and has never played football before. he saved a few aswell, he did good in my book, cant wait to see him train and give it another shot next time!
His defence let him down seriously. They never protected him.
as @drdisrespect would say "unathletic and weak"
Still feels so weird to see him interacting with all these uk YouTubers 😂 xqc and yung filly is an unexpected duo
WHO IS THIS GOALER
Really trash goal keeper 😂😂😂
you were so trash bro
Wholesome video
It would be cool if he trained and plays again next year
XQC a W for this
Carry on practising....you'll get there....
8:37 is pretty normal, even pro gk done that too
I honestly don't think X played that bad. I play keeper and there is a lot of stuff you need to learn that can't be taught in 2 days. WE NEED XQC REDEMPTION ARC 2024
I know xQc wasn't that good, but that defence was horrible. KSI would have looked as bad if they didn't have better defence. Also Speed not being able to finish anything didn't help.
Guy says "i didnt know" like it's gonna make him sound better, bro, you didnt know BECAUSE YOURE SHIT
Karma came back hard, laughing at Cal The Dragon and you did 10x Worse LMFAO
Sidemen weren’t even trying cuz they know had bad he was  in goal and the Gideon lol. They could’ve kicked from anywhere could’ve been 16-5 😂
Chunks is too selfish with the ball, keeping the ball too long
In football if you lose or not you cant blame it on goalkeeper you just cant
Reading this chat is one of the worst things ever.
So can some soccer (football) fans explain how the first 2 shots, Kai is kicking "In the box" but on the shot against X it's not considered the same??
And lil bro tryna roast cal💀💀
Unpopular opinion: The shots scored against XQC were much harder as compared to Cal the dragon
600sm in the chat 😭
nah some of those goals were defo the defense fault. ksi wasnt even in the goal and someone stopped speeds ball like cmon xqc out here alone as a newbie
XQC played well tbh, people forget this is his first ever football match and it was in front of 60k people. A lot of goals conceded were hard to catch. Please bring xQc back next year.
Ngl tho. Props to XQC putting in effort to defend every goal.
Honestly this is an outplay from X. He set the bar so low so that when he comes back next year, anything he does will be seen as improvement.(Hes probably still gonna shit the bed)
I've played keeper for over 10 years it's not easy. xQc had some really bad plays, but his defense was even worse.  Not that he'll read this, but knowing when to come off your line to cut off the angle will really help narrow the striker's chances of scoring.
You did good.i hope i see next time as a goalkeeper again with some improvement💪
0.3
Bro trying so hard to defend how ass checks he is on goal
that tobi goal was more because of jidion
xQs really was bad, but only one save
Best react ever
5:40 offsides no? doesnt count
Mod ban xqc for selling the game
Congrats in being a part of a huge charity event mate.. massive respect for doing it 2.5 mill raised i hope you enjoyed it and had a great day
It makes sense that xQc thought the Ethan play was over since jidion touched the ball, I would've thought the same thing tbh😂
X WENT TO LONDON AND PLAYED FOOTBALL WITH 60K FANS AMAZING THINK ABOUT THAT
Dude they both are the worst goalies they were better off with nobody protecting the net 😂
its so funny that most of his chat is fat and couldnt run 10 steps let alone dive for a ball LMAO🤠
We ain’t making it out the hood with xQc in goal
You should've not laugh at cal the dragon
He gotta run it back
21:20 you can pick the ball because it's not a back pass
Some of XQC’s audience doesn’t understand how hard it is to play goalkeeper when you haven’t played before, let alone against mainly YouTubers that practice shooting regularly, even players that don’t play. It’s not easy
Man was with the whale for so long, acting like he dont know about wide nets... bruh.
Glad you got to participate in the Charity match Felix ❤!
for the people that wanna see actual keepers and shi go watch a pro game this is a charity match it’s supposed to be entertaining, really enjoyed the match , I feel like the defense let him down bad tho
I hope he plays again for the next match
16:39 chat spamming offside say a lot about they don't know how offside works at all 😂
0:58 Lmao, who added this emote xQc 0.3 Rating match
For basically no experience, he did alright. Had a few saves. Got very unlucky on two of the goals as well. I think it was just nice to see him out there enjoying the moment.
...
why does he talk slower now
Right now he's just another version of Loris Karius, but i believe in the next year he will be another version of Oliver Kahn
the hate on speed is insane. Yeah he missed shots...that does not mean X couldn't have saved more goals
Yea Joshua is hella smart😊
Mad respect from me for putting your hand up to actually go in goal. GK is super difficult, especially when you've never played before.
Lakaka threw on defense. Didn’t help XQC at all.
the sidemen defiantly got him in goal to show him its not easy as he thought previously this really humbled him as you see with the many fumbles
speed was so bad same lvl as xqc
😅 surprised he knows enough about football to appreciate how ridiculously off side kai was... I literally face palmed when i saw it the first time, the american players really stood out.
why didn't they show xqc saving the corner
0.3 . get in the fucking gym
Hello guys welcome to my tutorial on how to spot 12 year olds:  Step 1.) Look for comments that say “don’t bring him back he is ass” in a charity game   Thanks for watching
At Least he didn't get scored on by Vik..
Ngl, Harry's goal is the least saveable one right there. Best goal of the match
8:36 ain’t no way he couldn’t catch that😂😂😭
nah man he tried his best going against manny, tobi, and simon while never playing the sport, id do pretty bad as well (i play football just not keeper)
Wtf bro !  You were laughing at dragon and now telling goal keeping is not easy😡🤬
the fact that chat is always saying COPEGE when x says its really hard to save a ball and not just watch, proves that chat doesn't ever go outside lmao
13:09 got me weak af ngl lmao the way he slid down his chair in shame 💀 Also, Jidion should never have been a defender, he would have done better in the center, or the bench 💀
Atleast he was better than cal, cal was missing rollers they eent in rolling like a walk in park, while most xqc ones were bangers
0.3 emoji is crazy
Bro.... maybe if you train to be a goalie, I think you would be a great one.
We NEED you back again next year hahaha
tbf x's defense was doing absolutely nothing. x is bad, but so are his defensive players
I really wanted you to have xQc on your jersey. I would have bought it on amazon in a heartbeat... lol Lyngel is fine but xQc is worth the money!!
Actually worse than cal OMEGALUL
I think the next step is having women sidemen vs women YouTube all stars
I just realized Duke was complete ass and absolutely sold on defense everytime but XqC took the blame 😂
Red team defense was horrible... not all your fault X
Guys the ball was curving tho
0:23 every twitch streamer tbh
that fact that x's chat talking all this shit and never touch a ball in there lives😭😭
Im pretty sure xQc couldve saved most of those goals if he had pro goalie reaction time and dive techniques 💀 Not athletic enough to handle longer dives 💀
XQC now finally understands how hard it is to explain football to Americans lol
Why bro diving like a lego 💀
legit maybe the best thing X has done. good shit haha
I actually think X could be a great goalie if given the time and he committed to training for it
XQC, big ups for having the fortitude to play goal. Your performance isn't the important part.  You showed up, helped raise alot of money for a great cause. Hopefully had some fun. Hope to see you back.
Pure karma you are not going to be invited next year like calthedragon lol
to everyone shitting on xqc 1- he did exceptionally well for his first real match in a new sport, one that people play at childhood to be decent at 2- he had no defence, almost every attack they make it is a penalty shot cause they just have an attack and xqc has to defend that somehow 3-most NA people will shit on him here because they dont understand football, even his reactions werent bad some of those were just not blockable, and some he blocked but fumbled by dropping the ball which is hard to hold onto in keeper gloves and u wouldnt understand how hard it is to learn to hold the ball as a keeper unless if u played as one if he had better defence, and didnt do a couple of goofy mistakes, his team would win this easy, look how many shots on target both teams had and posession then blame xqc lmao
His chat knows nothing about football, he tried his best and I know he had more balls than anyone in his chat to step on the pitch.
jidion cant control his fatass 😂
this is like watching a 100 year old grand grand grandma who never used a computer trying to play a shooter game, walking against a wall and saring at the ground
After watching and shitting on him so many times. I finally understand... the defence was ass too! The boy tried really good with what he was given. The defence never came in were mostly on the opp side leaving the goal just with a cardboard cutout 😂😂
excuse after excuse😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
you did good man
differentiate the goal from the other side and xqc’s, they got defenders while xqc defends alone 😢
bro i am a main goalkeeper and i live in a country where everyone plays football and that shit isnt easy and he did 1000% percent good for his first pro match with a goal that wide, also his defence was not existent lmao
Speed got exposed with his fruity ass nigga couldn’t even make 1 goal Ronaldo would be disappointed asf I hope speed never plays or talk about ⚽️ ever again.
Xqc sold his team, they possibly could have won if they had a goalie
3:41 perfectly timed moment' 😂😂
i love how ppl make fun of kai for not knowing the offside rule and then comment that the manny goal was offside XD
You did great bruv. All love ❤👏🏼
Genuinely did better than Cal last year. X didn’t claim to be a keeper and honestly half the goals he couldn’t do anything about especially as someone new to keeping. You can keep your head high 1000%
6:21 W Xqc
2.5m BIG W.
Honestly Jidion was the worst unnoticed player
I FUCKIN CAAN'T LULULULU
😂❤
Bro u shit stop making excuses
i've waited for this. ill enjoy it with all my bones
I've known of you for a long time and i never really watched, but your participation in the Charity Match earned tons of respect. I shall be subscribe now.
LIL BRO REALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE BOUTTA PLAY ON A CHILDRENS GOAL
Honestly it wasn't much of Xqc's fault, most goals he ate were 1v1s
xqc's chat is so annoying bro
Dude, the goaler is soo important on football idk why they put him to be a goaler, he could have been a player and maybe the could have won the game if he wasn't the goaler but at least he tried!
🤣🤣🤣
that was a good react
Like xqc once said about all the goales in the previous sidemen Chartiy match: SOOO BAAAD
xQuses is crazy
Bro got -1 stamina
Jidion is the worst player I have ever seen in my life
Xqc ur chat sucks, good job for putting yourself out there and getting involved. Thought u were a good addition to the YouTube roster and great for content 👌🏻
Bro doesn't have to be so hard on himself, Manny is practically a semi-pro. Simon is a technical genius and Tobi is a goat. Hope they have him next year again, everyone really seemed to enjoy each other vibes.
IM REALLY GLAD X WENT EVEN THO HE WASENT GREAT, IT WAS NICE TO SEE HIM PLAY AND I REALLY HOPE TO SEE HIM AGAIN NEXT TIME :) XQCL
xQses... love that commentator lol  Huge respect for xQc all jokes aside.
I think if you work on your reaction time and practice some more, that would really help with the improvement. It also didn’t help that the defense wasn’t great either but I honestly think that you did well for someone who played for the first time, especially with the pressure and nerves.
It’s more just so funny because of how much he shit on the keepers last year
the announcers cringy jokes were nonstop during this match
I don't know, if the ball easily gets past everyone and straight to the goalie maybe its not the goalie's entire fault on why the team lost. Seeing how the coach kept yapping on twitter and youtube about X being the root cause led me to believe that blud is tryna cover up his shortcomings as a coach cause blaming the supposed "common enemy" is the easiest way to divert attention away from the fact that the defenders were not told what to do as they were afk the whole time and speed being hyperfocused into making a goal and look what happened omegalul. Offside andy and wasted penalty shot incident
SPEED AND XQC SOOOOO BADDDDD MANNNN
Bro you're waffling 😂😂
idk why everyone seems to think being a goalie is easy. especially when he NEVER played before. he did well for having little to no experience
Almost all goals were penalties basically, he didnt do terrible
they did u dirty with defense. Shouldve had harry pinero with u
Jam a Keeper
HELLO XQC I CAN PUT YOU IN CONTACT WITH THE GOALIE FOR TEAM CANADA IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS SERIOUS
I actually wanna see an 12 month transformation for the juicer. If 12 months can turn speed into a finesse demon than I think it can make X a brick wall.
for people saying the sixth goal is an offside, the offside doesn't happen unless the attacker is beyond the last defender.... or the ball by the time Tobi last touched the ball. i'm not very sure from the camera angle but to me the ball looked a bit ahead of Manny which excludes him from being off side. however if the pass reached Vik then (maybe) it would be an offside.
It is a bit of a shame that he didn't have the back pass rule properly explained to him. In a charity match like that it would almost be better if he didn't know the rule at all and just always tried to pick it up (because who was going to purposefully pass the ball back to him).
next time when you play as a goalie try to go towards the player and just block with your body, staying in your position is the worst thing you could do you won't be able to react in time
Worst goalie ever
Next year XQC is gonna be the Neuer, Casillas & Buffon hybrid that stops everything
2:43 yeah that’s called playing advantage or “advantage played”
If xqc was a dialogue options in a game, it would like calling out a level 69 character with an intimidating roll and failing. Or just constantly using manipulation roll  lmao, rogue lookin ass, pick that lock for me
As a Brazilian this hurts my eyes
kekw
0.3 🐍🐍
Kai miles offside😂😂😂
Bro had the audacity to criticise Cal the dragon the last goalkeeper💀😂
Yo
Keep mocking him with the 0.3
Idk why people are acting like this is a real game 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 it was for charity and people are giving in depth review playoff contender no longer going to championship reviews
Whoever invited xQc to be the goaler is a genius (think it was Zerkaa)
To be honest he did not have that much practice
Fresh content. Pog
You did well.
Nice thumbnail
Stickman in goal? No wonder they lost
