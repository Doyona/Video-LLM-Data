Maybe if they hadn't made the two movies this might have been okay but after watching and loving the movie's this just pales in comparison. I think it's the actors who just can't compare to Logan Lerman, Alexandra Daddario, and Brandon T. Jackson.
Still a great show to this day! Can't wait for season 2!
Nice. It's a shame it has the same storyline as the movie tho.
I will NOT be watching this or any other piece of Disney media. I have canceled my Disney+ subscription, my Hulu subscription, and I will never visit a Disney property or knowingly watch a piece of Disney media or purchase Disney products again. You have supported a fascist and traded the US Constitution for money and greed - not the beliefs I uphold. I will boycott you to the end of my time.

wait why isn't annabeth blonde?
is that riptide i hear!??

W0KE
That's just trying hard for representation. I'm sorry, but a black Annabeth just won't fit. I'm okay if any of the other characters are chosen as black, as long as their appearances aren't described otherwise. But Annabeth is a blonde with tanned skin. The fact that she's blonde has shaped who she was: a girl trying hard to be noticed and tries to escape the 'dumb american blonde' stereotype.  Pls fix it Disney, it is not too late to use a bit of hair dye and Adobe to give an authentic California tan a white blonde would have.   P.S.: you already have Zeus black so why not make Thalia black instead of Annabeth is beyond me. No one would really object to that but you chose to mess with the wrong character. Leah does an ok job like any other pro actress aged 15 would, just let her play Thalia and find a proper actress for Annabeth we all grew up with.   Or just use the hair dye and Adobe to match the book skin color, Annabeth can never be pitch black this is just racism in itself to race swap an officially white girl for the sake of representation while the books ARE LITERALLY FULL OF GREAT BLACK CHARACTERS that do not need any swapping.   Please save Annabeth Disney and Rick. You’re crushing kids dreams right now (coming from someone who grew up reading the books in 2010s and shopping Percabeth for nearly a decade, I will never see Leah as Annabeth), it’s just blunt humiliation of the fans and Rick’s heritage.   Hope you fix it sooner than later, 20th century fox did dye the actress blonde in the 2nd film although Alexandra Daddario was already near perfect looking for the role. If they could do it you can do it Disney.

Can't wait for season 2!
The first season of Percy Jackson and the Olympians premiered on Disney+ on December 19, 2023. It consists of eight episodes and adapts the events of the first book in Rick Riordan's novel series, The Lightning Thief.  The season introduces Percy Jackson, a 12-year-old demigod who discovers his true heritage as the son of Poseidon. He is wrongly accused by Zeus of stealing his Master Bolt, a powerful thunderbolt. Percy embarks on a quest with his friends Annabeth Chase (daughter of Athena) and Grover Underwood (a satyr) to clear his name, locate the true thief, and avert a war between the gods. Their journey takes them across America, encountering various figures from Greek mythology and navigating treacherous situations. Along the way, Percy seeks to save his mother from the Underworld.

Perfect trailer
I absolutely LOVE THIS VERSION OF RIPTIDE ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
i thought this the continue from before, and then ahhhhh this just remake 🥱
Riptide
MY NAME IS PERCY JACKSON. AM I A…TROUBLED KID? YEAH I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THAT
Greece's Trumpet.🎺🏰🎺.
You people have hope for nothing, they will race and gender swap everyone and then add pronouns, all the white people will be evil and the black people will be innocent, all the men will be saved by super women. Stop hoping so much
Oh Percy is cute boy❤
Does anyone know when the second season will be ?
Does anyone notice that Percy and Annabeth’s hair colour got swap? 😭
you know. I can totally see this kid that plays Percy Jackson play Link in the upcoming Legend of Zelda movie.
I keep comind back to this trailer and every single time it makes me cry 😭 This means everything to me. Reading this books as a kid/teen made me feel not only less lonely but also so much happier than i ever was. I truly think they shaped me as a person in a lot of ways and now i get to share this world that became my safe place with my little brother (who's around the age i started reading these books), i hope these series can give him everything they gave me, he deserves to have something like that ❤
imagine morgan freeman as a centaur
They done turned Ares to a greaser 😭🙏
literally watching the show for the 6th time i love it so much
Well at least it's better than the others percy Jackson
THEY LITERALLY ADDED THE SONG RIPTIDE!!!!!! THEY LISTENED TO US!!!!!!
Well, the series is written very badly especially the dialogues and the characters are just way too young for roles you should have either taken it towards comedy or should have kept characters in teen not kids. Instead of keeping the story completely mythical, the story revolves more around personal dialogues (that is already poorly written) and instead of becoming either multi characters story or single character it looses in both regards. Movie was way better than this. Are story writers have  completely lost the sense of writing. Producers should hire better ones.
Why is this sooo good?!
oh my gosh it still gives me chills.
Who sings this song?
RIPTIDE
Doesn't he have black hair on the books?
Cool
Riptide was always the unofficial Percy Jackson fan-song, so I’m so glad it’s officially in the show into
Like each actor and actress in the main three characters are like all River Phoenix good for sure
I think the actor for Grover is really good.
Dude this got really good fast after the first two episodes and those were already fine.
Alexandra Daddario is number one. Annabeth.
Still waiting for Disney to release this version of riptide PLEASE
I know I can read the books now, but god damn, how I wish I had read them when I was a child or a teenager, I really needed them ba k then
Using Riptide for this promo was a touch of genius👌🏽Good show
Disney live Adaptation., Little Mermaid = black, Snow White = brown., Anabeth = black 🤦🤦🤦👎 another garbage! Pls., stick to the Book and the original story!!!

THE SONG OH MY GODS ITS SO DAM GOOD
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHO SINGS THIS VERSION OF THE SONG????? CAUSE I STILL CANT FIND IT AND NO HATE TO THE ORIGINAL BUT IT SOUNDS SO AMAZING!!!!
Disney only wants every legend to become black.👎
I wish annabeth had golden hair😢😢
Do not tell me that the black man is Zues
I am so pumped bc I’ll be watching this for my birthday OMGGGGG 🔱🌊
Bok gibi olmuş
Испортили фильм слишком много негров, в оригинальном фильме кентавр был белым, и Зевс тоже, потом подруга перси тоже, я не расист но бесит когда меняют всеми известных персонажей на черных лишь бы угодить всяким направлениям, я не удивлюсь если перси влюбится в своего друга, это же Дисней
Nah did i see edge/adam copland or im tripping
The only thing I hate is that Chiron didn't said the full dialouge that Poseidon Earthshaker,Strombringer,Father of Horses.Hail Perseus Jackson,the son of sea god.
I read the books and I’m kinda disappointed with Grover’s design

I am back here after seeing the season 2 announcement teaser today and Walker's voice now 😭😭 He grew up so much. He sounds so different there.
Anyone here after the season 2 teaser? Walkers voice is so different!!
WATCHING THIS BACK WHEN WE GOT THE SEASON 2 TEASER OMG 😭😭💕💕
*LOOK I DIDN’T WANT TO BE A HALF BLOOD*
I thought Alexandra was just 16-17y here but she was 24.  She looks young for her age.  This one doesn't need a reboot.  Many other stories to tell instead.
I am all gender for real for real. I was at one time just trans gender female to male.
And we are done after this I am between the ages of 18-25 for real for real.
And the for real for real John isn’t a boomer of the boomer, he is the for real for real John tho and is also an over 18.
Ah what isn’t that the opening scene for 50 shades of Grey.
Biggest flop flop flop! The Worst Adaptation of all time! Disney+ is worst at picking best suited characters and making adaptations, always a disappointment and flop! No one can replace the Original best casting movies specially anabeth portrayed by Alexandra daddario., Netflix is better in making adaptations like for example Avatar., the casting is on point and effects are superb that’s why always a big success and popular.., unlike this flop adaptation of Disney+ where all characters are worst and an opposite from the book.

Oh man It's amazing I don't have Disney plus I didn't even knew about this series but I'm intensely reading Percy Jackson by Rick Riordan It's just like my imagination how it would look like Maybe that's why people read first then see the movies I get it now  Harry Potter I watched first then read It took away the experience by 50%  Listen learned
What a downgrade for annabeth
Goosebumps
THIS WITH RIPTIDE OH MY GOD, THE PERSON WHO CHOSE RIPTIDE FOR THIS NEEDS A GRAMMY😭
the fact that they changed anna beth's race to match their agenda is bullshit. Daddario in Percy Jackson was what Meghan fox in transformers for me..

I know how this tv show will end..     With the og actor being the last olympian alive because of apocalypse from the last movie and he will travel back in time somehow and save the world against kronus
I recall when the first Percy Jackson movie was released there was another fantasy film Eragon based on book series by christopher paolini. I hope Disney can make a series about these books just like shadow hunters movies had a 3 season series.

The book:🗿             themovie: a joke
I like the movie better. Didn't really see much significant changes in the series. Most are negligible. Maybe just Ares. But the action scenes sucked. Most were short and lacked danger. I couldn't feel the sense of urgency in most scenes. There were too much talking. Only got better in the last 2 episodes. Also Luke's fight was better than Ares's lol. Acting was kinda mid.
This is going to be close to the book The other one I watched was nothing to write home about
Poseidon's Replied ♎ 📜 Hermes' Scroll 📜.
Que manía con poner personajes negros donde no toca.. La inclusión forzada ya es molesta. Que les cuesta hacer una serie/película ceñida a la historia y con los actores con las mismas características físicas del personajes al que interpretan...   -Si el personaje es negro que el actor sea negro.  -Si el personaje es asiático que el actor sea asiático!  No es tan difícil...

Yeah so I'm incredibly sad I can't watch this because I don't have Disney+ 😭😭😭I desperately need it. Btw Walker is my fav actor I'm so happy he's Percy.
I love this movie
1 นาที 83 วินาที

1 นาที 60 วินาที
If i wasnt already a fan of pjo seeing this would make me want to watch it
I want this version of riptide on Spotify I watch this video bc it literally gives me butterflies I love it and THIS SHOW mg it’s exceeded my expectations by 100000 times
Duh the movies were better. so bad it got discontinued. I don't think Disney will do anything Good. It will destroy Percy Jackson like it destroyed Star Wars.
I'm just here to see Edge :>
This is an actual remake of the og book not the movies as they were a bit different this will be a hundred percent accurate
Phim đáng xem hay không... Thì chưa nghe ai nói gì về vấn đề đó cả.  Chắc lại là phim rác rưởi... 1/10 :))))
This is probably the modern harry potter but id rather harry potter more
I thought this was the greatest trailer ever, and then the show came out and was nothing like the books
They're using the books lines❤❤ The trailers freakin' awesome! I know this show will be good now~ 🤩
Link for full series please
I pray that this finally does the books justice.... But its disney so my hopes are lower than rock bottom
The fact that they used riptide as a trailer song is ✨
The Greek gods (and thereby to an extent Percy & friends) were closely related so the racial diversity makes no sense whatsoever. I have never ever seen one single depiction of Zeus with sub-Saharan African features, but maybe my university wasn’t woke enough?
Why is Annabeth black
why is annabeth black😂
What’s the song underneath riptide? The instrumental song
My name is Ellie Jackson do not quite
Bro I like LOVE riptide it’s one of my favorite songs 😂❤
Where is Annabeth?
OMG RIPTIDE AND PERCY JACKSON
bruh annabeth is black!?
I’m not gonna lie I have this trailer memorized and I full out recite it every time I hear the song riptide
I thought Annabeth was blond?
IS THAT ADAM COPELAND AKA EDGE???? 1:05
ive watched the show 7 times and this trailer is the main reason dont get me wrong i love pjo but the movies gave me ptsd
So much for Grover being the oldest looking 6th grader percy has ever seen 🙄  He just looks like he's 12, no facial hair
this looks so much like the first movie
Disney+... let me guess, percy is they/them, his best friend is gay and the girl is non-binary.... get the **** out of here 😂
Lol the song is perfekt
Can’t believe riptide was used
nice lab
Disney can you please let another channel stream this! I don’t have an account nor a subscription!
I think Denim Richards might be a good replacement for Lance Reddick in next season, and if anyone questions why he looks different, can just say he has the ability to shape-shifting, cause Zeus has been known to do this in mythology
ıt didn't give me the vibe .... first main Percy and other actors much better
Remember when the fan crying because Annabeth dont have blond hair in the first og movie? Huge shit-storm,the producer and director do apologies and in the second movie she was blonde... now we have that 😂😂 bro she is black!! wtf is this shit,its litteraly a troll
I’m only watching this for Edge
So now all Disney makes are shitty reboots? Wow the creativity in this company really doesn't exist anymore 😂
Boycott Hollywood
Hope Netflix would remake this to have the best fit casts for the character! The book is soo good, they just ruined this the reason it became flop!
A flop series, 2006 movies is so so much better! This is just for kinder garten!
Garbage!
Was this good or successful?
Annabeth is black.. it’s fine, but I really hoped that she would be white with blonde hair..
In what world is Zeus black??
this was pretty good i heard its way better then the movie
I had such high hopes for this, until Disney got a hold of it.  I guess we won't be having any Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard movies.
OH, IM SOBBING
This show was absolutely beautiful and incredible
I like the other ones more lmao
La manera en la que debo de volver al trailer, para caer en cuenta que POR FIN TENEMOS UNA HERMOSA ADAPTACIÓN DE PERCY JACKSON, CON UN ELENCO INCREIBLE. Ahhhh, que hermoso
YESSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!!!
Not up to the previous movie
WHY THE ANNABETH IS BLACK?
looks fun but I cant get into this Percy he ain't no Logan...
why annabeth is black??in the book she has blonde hair😢😢😢
this looks childish
Why the annabeth is Black? In books she had bright grey hairs why they do that 😭😭😭😭
Bro the 20th century studio movie was far better than this series
Gerçekten izlemeye değer muazzam bir film 👌
Neden kimse Annabeth hakkında yorum yapmıyor? İlla siyahi mi olması gerekiyor? Zaten Kıvırcık siyahiydi. Annabeth de sarışın! Aghenanın kızı nasıl siyahi olur?? Ayrıca Ares yaşlı değil kaslı orta yaşlı biri. Kherion bedeni beyaz. Yapmayın ama..
😮😮😮
