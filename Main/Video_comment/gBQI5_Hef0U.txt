I feel like the pre season determines the regular season
Collinsworth needs to stfu just runs his mouth the whole time and tells stories doesn't talk about the game at all
Every first nfl pre season game comments every year: “I don’t care who’s playing or who won I’m just happy football is back”  🤣
They could had Ramsey
Glad I didn't have to sit through all those vacuous interviews.
Wow, that video was amazing! I'm not sure if the players are trying to make a good impression or a bad one. I saved almost 90% on my airfare purchases using Mighty 🤝🏻 Travels 🤛🏿 Premium.
Love it
Incredible video!
Liked and subscribed
So good
Wish I would have seen this earlier.
Bliss!
When will the next video drop?
Awesome video!
Made my day!
Great video
Can you make more videos please

Looks like a Jaguars are still going to suck. Number 1 pick again?
I know it’s backups but sheesh Jags look horrible.
finally football is back
Football is back ! Lets go
I didn't even know preseason was starting. Don't care either. Like most Amerikan's we gave up on pro sports when they went all WOKE/Cupcake/Pro cry baby.
JAGUARS WHERE'S YOUR DEFENSE?
Worse two teams In football  Hand me the remote please
u no ur addicted to fb when u came to watch this clip
Raiders are gonna make a deep run!
3:33 HE DID A SANJI KICK
3:35 the best taunting touch down😎
Mullens was lucky he played against a team that competes with the Lions for most losses in a season. When he was a Niner he cost us the game every time he played. so glad we got rid of him 👍
football is back baby
Int?
Raiders going to win the Super Bowl this year 1000% !!!!
IT THE BENGLAS IN THE RAIDERS AFC CHAMPIONSHIP 20 TO 23 BENGLAS GOING BACK TO THE SUPERBOWL

JESUS/YAHASHUA CHRIST is LORD repent and be baptized. Except HIM today. Amen
Football is Back Baby 🏈
I'm glad football is back and I'm a niners fan and I'm really looking foward to this friday night when the niners play greenbay. I know preseason isn't important but it's still fun to watch. I'm looking foward to what Trey Lance has to offer and the rest of what the newbies have to offer on the niners squad. Good game raiders and niners play them this upcoming season. #footballisback #goniners.
I thought Collinsworth retired wtf?
Finally. It's trash, but it's still football.
Getting ready for Derek Carr to start saying Alpha go & Mic 20 set hut at the line of scrimmage
Bro are we actually going back to 2015 nfl game thumbnails
Jacob’s looks good
RAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIDDDDDDDDDEEEEEERRRRRRRSSSSSSSSS 🤜🤛🛡️
This Game doesn't really Gauge How Good The Los Angeles Raiders and Jacksonville Jaguars can be
Jags isn't even an NFL team anymore. Anyone who plays jags will look like a Champ. It has become a group that only  make others look good 😆 . cant even call it a team . sad
TAE ADAMS I MISS U ON PACKERS😭😭😭🥺
Josh Jacobs JINKLE HEIMER SCHMIDT!!! His name is my name TOO
I still want to see Cole win.
Where's John G .😉
Even if Jacksonville didn't win the running play and touchdown they did  was actually really great against a team like the raiders
Jags will get better
Go Vegas Raiders!!!
oline still looks bad for the raiders lol they can pass protect for nothing
Pretty much a hall of shame
The raiders  are doing good 👍👏
These same to teams going to play in super bowl book it.
If your team suffers a loss like this make them boys suffer in practice. It looks like the jags have some discipline issues on offense
WTF THE HOF GAME ALREADY????? USUALLY MID AUG ANYWAY THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU LEAST THERE IS HOPE NOW COOLER TEMPS FOOTBALL THE HOLIDAYS YES YES YES
Something just feels so right seeing football back in action
Its great watching NFL again!!
EMONEYTREE made the team?
Even Jacksonville backups trash... Good God...
zamir white is the reason UGA got the natty. dude is going to be a stud
Is it just me or does football seem less exciting than back in the day? Don't get me wrong I love football.
https://youtu.be/_ZIfiZUqheI
He said josh gay jacobs ?
It's pretty sad when your opponent is so bad that you have keep yourself from running up the score in a pre-season game.
Chargers ⚡️
*RAIDERS ☠️*
Thanks for giving me random videos YouTube but I told you 7 years ago I ain't watching this crap no more. When they started kneeling I said no to football and I meant it. They won't buy my amazing golf carts there a bunch of corporate jerks. My golf carts are amazing and high class and high-end and they don't care. The worldwide NFL billionaire billionaire and they don't care about the best stuff they're looking for something for nothing and they've got their marketing genius corporate dudes that they hire to save the money getting on the phone looking for a deal from me. The billionaire NFL is wanting me to just pop them out some football helmet golf carts. They go to these trade shows and stand in line for Rubbermaid trash cans for their offices and the trash cans are 462 retail $462 and these dudes in suits who don't love football they just have a job at a football corporate office stand in line for an hour to talk to the guy that sells the Rubbermaid high-end office waste baskets are you kidding me
I'm a Doug Pederson fan, so I'm rooting for the Jaguars to do well.
It’s time for raiders to take over the AFC WEST,,, chief’s had a good run ,   But it’s time to step aside and let the raiders take over and handle,,,,
Raiders baby,Raiders

Football?  Now the idiot Americans have something to cheer other than their leader, Biden.🙄
Walter happy birthday to you 8:18
Oh yea it’s gonna be a good year
Pass incomplete
Jake can really zip that ball just needs the accuracy a little bit to be better but he threw some absolute dots
Touchdown Las Vegas
Field Goal is good
Yessssss
Never thought I would get tired of football.
These were the most boring "highlights" ever.  😴
How did I miss this game ?
we're back
Football is back baby!!!!
In honor of football season starting back
I like how the players put a lot of effort into this game to bring back football. What exciting start to a new season

Vacation begins when Dad says, "I know a short cut."   Perhaps the world's most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
FOOTBALL BABY!!!
Come on jags 3-peat the tank bowl
The NFL is fake. Staged.
Raiders going to superbowl
Trayvon walker looked alright all things considered.
I bet Jesper Horsted #80 is going to help a lot the Raiders, can't believe the Bears didn't keep him😡.
*Pretty People Privilege*  Pretty People Privilege aka PPP is the advantage that attractive people have to get what they want.
Preseason or regular season, dolphins looked good in this one... I'm glad football is back🏈
One big bang!! Raiders! Till I die.
Jaguars slot Def bought his gloves from 99 cents 💀💀
I’m from duval it’s going to be another long year for those guys.
I hate NBC. I miss Al Michaels & Cris Collinsworth broadcasting together. NBC the same network that canned Jay Leno.
The roundhouse kick is sick though
2 of the least likable teams 😂
https://youtu.be/tjbWPLj9cBc
Look at zay man 😭0:13
That boy jacobs a beast
Trevor Lawrence career is already over....
Doctor you've got to help me, I'm addicted to Twitter. Doctor: I don't follow you.
I like the Raiders. I just wish they move back to California. They have brought so much crime and bad people to my lovely city of Las Vegas. Go Riders,  UT to California.
Nice mortal kombat combo by abdullah.
Wish there were more games like it used to be instead of spacing them out like this
Abdullah was a fumble machine while with the Lions.
Al Michaels will be missed.
Jesus loves y’all ❤️
Football is back 🔥🔥🔥🔥
3:15 that run was gross 🤮 . Raiders run game looks strong!
my mom is a jaguars fan and my dad is a raiders fan so this was fun to watch with them
Every since the Jaguars gave up Fournette and Jalen, they have been ass and cheeks so...
May be early pre-season, but Raiders looked very good. In sync, motivated to play.
Can’t believe Texans fans saw this game and said they were taking the south…. HOW?? Texans ain’t been good in a long time, not to mention the colts and titans are some monsters!!! Didn’t even play their preseason game yet and Texans fans talking bout some taking the division
Jacksonville sucks as usual
YESSSS FOOTBALL. BEEN WAITING SO LONG
For everyone here, I hope you embrace Jesus for when you are at the gates of heaven, if you reject him during life he will reject you after.
Are you ready for some 🏈
Someone took away a doubt from me. What is the distance from the extra point?
Why wasn’t Ruggs playing?
glad to see Lawrence will still only have 1 contract in the NFL. "I'm drafted #1, and now I'm selling cars"
Why run jacobs so much
"Hey lets choose the two most boring teams to open the season up"

Raiders played great.
with another HOF game in the books, the countdown starts NOW 🏈

WooHooW, football is back !!! So excited for the new season to start 🥳
You should draft me
Muy bien servicio
I am excited football is back! The raiders look really good this year. The team has a lot of potential this season.
I’m trying to see longer videos when the season started not no 9-10 minutes
The NFL should let Refs play a game 7 on 7 at Pro Bowl.
If men can figure how to be wide square Body shaped they will sweat it spiritually Be fat and short Never lady size  Hinduism weakness Jesus might  Indians are bad daddy’s
Jags got Slotter'd
Aye! I didn't know the Jaguars signed my man sloter! Nice to see him back in the league! Prediction: the raiders are gonna be a good team in a tough division. The only question mark is the o-line and if they're top 2 backs can stay healthy. The jaguars on the other hand, are probably gonna struggle on offense but I think their defense will be better than last year. Also they need to find a kicker lol
Why is Josh Jacobss playing in the HOF game? That’s really dumb.
Jax Defense is improving and the Offense is, as i said the defense is improving.
WHO ELSE MISSED FOOTBALL 😭 FELT LIKE IT BEEN 10 YEARS
Im just watching this cause there is nothing better to do  but josh Jacobs is a beast of a runner
Hall of fame game would be better...... if it had actual physically able HoF players playing for each team. Just saying.
Stidham and Mullins I think showed not many but just a few flashes of their potential. More practice and years experience and I think they could really be top 10 qbs. Maybe. With how the league works I don’t think that’ll happen.
Let’s go Raiders!
I'm really happy football is back. I wish they'd add more games. It's so awesome.
Good Luck Raiders..Yes to see Football game even preseason  ave a  good Football evening everyone....
Thank goodness football is back

Jags need to draft or get someone to stop the run
“For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. (John 3:16) The bible says the wages of sin is death. Man has broken Gods moral law and has gotten the death penalty. However due to Gods mercy Jesus lived a perfect life and died on the cross for our sins to make us right with God. “Go and sin no more”-Jesus. trust in what Jesus did for you…because He loves you.
So everyone was trying to hype this up but it’s just a bunch of guys going through the motions. No stakes, no effort, no willingness to play good football. Boring.

That karate kick by abdullah was underrated
Matthew 8:20 And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
I'm happy for Zamir White, that look he had at the Draft and this play at 1:36 speaks volumes, this is Our YEAR!
The Jacksonville defense looked good in this game.
The Jags stink smh
These comments prove how long football takes to come back every year :/ Too long.
Woke ball is back. Who cares.
https://youtube.com/shorts/O2KCAA3Wziw?feature=share
Walker is going to shine
I know it’s Jacksonville and all, but the Raiders played like they had to get something off their chest!
Is it just me, or did both of these O-lines get slaughtered most the game? Both teams had some good runs, but that pass protection looked like band aids holding glass together.
Football sucks now
Ok I see you Stidham!!!!! #WarEagle 🐯
I missed the pre season because I can’t watch football at my dads
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Anyone who reading this, I pray that whatever is hurting  or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. May the dark throughts, The overthinking, the doubt exist your mind right now. May replace confusion. May peace and calmness fill in your life.❤️

Remember when Trump tried to get all his racist buddies to stop watching football? And even tried to turn on NASCAR? What a moron.
La famine est sur le point d'arrivée en Europe et partout dans le monde et ils complet bientôt cette paroles (il y aura de grands tremblements de terre, et, en divers lieux, des pestes et des famines; il y aura des phénomènes terribles, et de grands signes dans le ciel. LUC 21:11), seul le Nom de Jésus-Christ sauve Rom 10.13 "Car quiconque invoquera le nom du Seigneur sera sauvé". Dieu vous aime, il vous aime tellement, et il a payer un prix très très grand pour vous, il vous a donné la vie et tout ce quelle renferme, chercher le de la manière que vous le souhaitée, parler lui il vous donneras, chercher le vous le trouverez, demandez et il vous donneras, il a donné son fils unique Jésus Christ en sacrifice pour que vous accéder a sa présence (Jean 14.16) et il ne souhaite que vous rencontre, il vous connait et il sait qui vous étiez, il est avec vous pour l'éternité, vous serait le plus heureux du monde si vous trouvé Dieu dans votre vie, je souhaite vraiment que vous le découvrir et qu'il comble votre cœur tout entier, par son unique Fils Jésus-Christ, mort pour nous, que l'amour de Dieu vous inonde, et il ne veux que personne périssent dans son péché, sa désobéissances envers Dieu car cela vous fera porter la peines de vos crimes devant Dieu alors que Jésus-Christ a porter toute la peines de toutes vos faute Passer, Présent et Futur, car son sang innocent verser par les hommes a effacée pour nous ABSOLUMENT TOUTES FAUTE, et si vous n'avez pas crue et accepter ce pardon donné gratuitement a tous, alors la colères de Dieu vous sera remis a la fin de votre vie et vous aurez pour salaire, le rejet de Dieu et de son royaume pour l'éternité et vous n'aurez plus de par a la vie dans l'au delà car votre esprit ne sera pas bon a cause de toute vos faute commise sur terre, elle régiront et vous serait souillée et en horreur a Dieu, et ce, peut importe vos faute, ne vous y trompé pas Dieu existe et toute c'est œuvre son visible sur terre (la justice, l'amour, la paix, le plaisir, et la création, etc...). Si vous avez compris ce message, demander a Dieu de vous sortir du pécher dans le quel vous êtes (la convoitise, le sexe hors mariage, l'impudicité, le vole, la violence, la haine, l'amour du monde, l'ignorance de Dieu, l 'avortement, les idolâtre de marie mère de jésus, les faux Dieu, et d'autre ...), il vous pardonnera de tout péché si vous le lui confesser. Dieu à laisser ses paroles dans la Bible et tout ce qui est de Dieu est écrit dedans. SEUL le Nom de son fils qui a fait faire mourir sur terre, que Dieu ce révèle a vous et que vous puissiez recevoir son Salut gratuit et éternel, et contempler avec tout ca l’Amour que Dieu a pour le monde entier. Que Dieu ce révèle a vous, dans le Nom de Jésus Christ notre Sauveur et Seigneur...............
Raiders seem to be deep at the running back position.
Why would they think these two teams are the ones that are going to make us excited
It's time for Carr to drive us to a SB victory, or else we riot, RN4L

Ohhh yesss.... so goog factory....
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life 12
Didnt see much Jacksonville offense in these highlights just. Little at the end
I'd kick Daniel Thomas for hitting Keelan Cole like that.
So we not going to talk about a 65 YARD FIELD GOAL THIS KICKER JUST MADE calmly 😳😳😳😳
Raiders. Kneeling, then screw the fans moving….again!
Thanks for the early football.
Why is Josh Jacobs playing like he’s not that dude??? 🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾
and no mention of the Raiders player Ruggs wtf did that not make the script  or the hype   yeah he killed someone this off season last season these same announcers all but  got on there knees and blew Ruggs  for 2 hrs  today  crickets  but another  player to blow
🏴‍☠️⚔️🛡️RAIDERS🛡️⚔️🏴‍☠️
noone said it wasnt going to be an uphill battle for the jags, but honestly, they look better overall, get down the depth chart and its pretty horrendous. But from what I could tell, the starting D line is looking pretty solid, and we didnt really see much of the starting offence, i just know i hope our main guys dont get injured. Tbf Snoop was looking alright... mostly.

Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                                     ./,,./,./,./,/.,/.,/,/.

Let's get ready for some football!!!
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.  May God Bless you all! ♥️
I’m Glad football is back but damn can’t they at least run the starters ONE SERIES FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!
the only time yall will hear Arden Keys name, in Preseason 😂😂 LETS GO RAIDERS!!
Abdullah with the kick. lol
I can't wait for Waller and Jacobs to tear it up this year.
My Raiders are a way better team without curl up Carr! 💯
Jags are the Jags 😂
Play calling by McDaniel's was solid with that rb screen game to keep the defense off balance. Will be helpful keeping pressure off Carr.
All the other sports are great but it's nothing like some football lfg#Falcons
Give your life to Jesus Christ before it's too late!   Here's how you can pray: Lord Jesus Christ, I've lived my life so far as if you didn't exist at all.  Now I have recognized you and turn to you in prayer. I now know that there is a heaven, but also a hell.  Please save me from Hell, this place I deserve to come to as a result of all my sins, mostly because of my unbelief.  I want to ask you to be with you in heaven for all eternity.  I understand that I cannot get to heaven on my own merits, but only by believing in You.  Because you love me, you died for me on the cross and took on my debts and paid for them in my place.  I thank you from the bottom of my heart.  You see all my transgressions, even those of my youth.  You know all the sins I've committed, not just the ones I remember, but all the ones I've long forgotten.  You know everything about me.  Every movement of my heart is known to you, be it joy, sadness, happiness or despair.  I am before you like an open book.  Because I cannot stand up to you and God the Father with my guilty past, access to heaven is closed to me.  That's why I ask you to forgive me for all my sins, all of which I feel sorry for.Amen.
HALL OF FAME GAME?????? WHERE? LOL

Go Stiddy go!
This is pre season but they look good
Football season babyyy
Im glad Raiders won 🏆
The most exciting play of the game was the punt return for a Jacksonville touchdown.  That would have made the score 20-10, but it was called back by the referees.  I get that the penalty made it a non-play, but I still would have included it purely for entertainment purposes.  Wondering how the rest of you feel about that.
Every time football is back, I look back how fast the year has flown by. But I'm glad football is back.
Should honestly just release the entire game. It's pre season and it's with the Jaguars.
More like the Vegas raiders highlights And some jags lowlights
Jags suck like really Bigly!
Lt number 75 for the raiders gonna get his qb kilt out there
https://youtu.be/ntjcQhEN6eQ
Everyone saying Jacobs is done why? He looked great. Mostly on Leatherwoods side.
Hope some of these kids make the roster. Go Chargers!!!

Battle of the screen passes
jags in mid season form
That o line for raiders looking good
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE #nbayoungboy #trippieredd
A boring ass preseason NFL game be getting more views than the WNBA finals. 💀💀
7:10 "you told us the other day that you feel like you can let it rip"...well the editing team had fun with that transition.
Let’s go Raiders! From all of the unprecedented adversity last year and still making the playoffs to all of the big name additions on both sides of the ball, the Raider Nation is set to make a huge leap forward this season.
All the losers here in the comment section: i'M JuSt GlAd fOoTbAlL iS bAcK! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Woo I’m just happy football is back 🏈
Love seeing the guys working hard to try and get their spot on the final roster!

Football is back, let's get it boys
The first win when the nfl is back!
oh how I missed you beautiful 😍🤣
I missed football so much that I was happy to watch this game lol
Football and the Raiders are back!
3:34 Abdullah with the question mark kick for a celebration 🤣🔥🔥🔥🔥
Looking like the raiders got some good prospects.
Where’s adams💀
Nice video Bliss Clicks & Colors 🎨 https://youtube.com/channel/UCZLCNgZZyGXG2OeOtSDOOFw
“HAPPY BIRTHDAY GRANNY I LOVE YOU” 😹💯
Nevada is a gay state
If the raiders stick with, Carr Their not going anywhere
Jacksonville got a good ass kicker shout to that man🏆🔥
Dad lost the bet on the jaguars
Adams didn’t have a single catch, good thing packers traded him, he’s washed………. (Still trying to cope)
I loved the spin kick celebration by Abdullah
Preseason or not great job by Travon Walker doing his thing. Always going to be a healthy rivalry between Hutchinson, Thibodeaux, & Walker. Why can't they all be special?
Josh Jacobs looks good glad i picked him on my fantasy team
Jaguars look to be in mid season form already, offensively and defensively.  😭😭😭😭
Time to start betting and losing money!
Jags can't even win a practice game🤪
Jacobs looks explosive out there
that ameer abdullah td celly just earned him more redzone touches lol
*I have been boycotting the NFL since people started kneeling.*  #MoneyTalks *I think only cowards kneel.*
Raiiiiiiddddderrrrrrs
Feels good to have football back baby!
Wow the jags are good I can see them being Super Bowl contenders for the next 5 yrs
Football is back guys!!!!
Jax horrible
Yeah football is back
The McDaniels story was a coaches dream. From player in that stadium to HC of the Raiders hosting the HOF game. However no team that played in this game has ever won the NFL Championship or Super Bowl.
I thought the first “raider like play” was gonna be a interception lol
It didn’t take long for the Jaguars to be the Jaguars again
football baby
Why is Jacobs playing In a preseason game?
Please stop doing interviews in the middle of the game, can we please stop doing this???
This is more exciting then the pro bowl
Football is back 🔥🔥🔥
Travon walker looking like the #1 pick that he is !
NFL is back babes!
Best sport is finally back
Football is back
Ight can’t wait for Seattle to beat the broncos
I feel this season,  we may witness a new super bowl winner.
We bak
I’m hoping josh jacobs stays healthy
Fools in the comments acting like the USFL did not exist. And we had had football a month and half ago lol.
Love the Run game.. Raider Nation for life!
Regardless what string they're playing at the NFL level, though it was the Jags the Radiers looked great and Stidham looked like a stud tonight. Mullins always great to see him show out when on the field.
I know it's a preseason game and I'm a Raiders fan. the Raiders looked Sharp, they looked like they were confident and prepared. I'm so excited for this Season. And hey, the jags actually did not look bad, compared to last year
Football is back!!!!

THE GOSPEL SIMPLY REQUIRES YOU TO PLACE ALL OF YOUR FAITH IN THE DEATH, BURIAL & RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST AND THE BLOOD HE SHED ON THE CROSS  FOR YOUR SALVATION  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the GOSPEL which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; by which also ye are SAVED, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that…  CHRIST DIED FOR OUR SINS  according to the scriptures; and that he was BURIED, and that he ROSE AGAIN the third day according to the scriptures: (1 Corinthians 15:1-4)  …In whom ye also TRUSTED, after that ye heard the word of truth,  the gospel of your salvation: in whom also  AFTER that ye BELIEVED, ye were SEALED  with that holy Spirit of promise.  (Ephesians 1:12-13)  For by GRACE are ye SAVED through FAITH;   (Ephesians 2:8)  …that the promise by FAITH of Jesus Christ might be GIVEN to them that BELIEVE. (Galatians 3:22)  …to them which should hereafter BELIEVE on him to life everlasting.  (1 Timothy 1:16)  …to whom it shall be IMPUTED, if we BELIEVE on him that raised up  Jesus our Lord from the dead; Who was DELIVERED FOR OUR OFFENCES,  and was RAISED AGAIN FOR OUR JUSTIFICATION. (Romans 4:24-25)  For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven,  whereof ye heard before in the WORD of the TRUTH of the GOSPEL; Which is come unto you, as it is in ALL the world;  and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye HEARD of it, and KNEW the GRACE of God in TRUTH:  (Colossians 1:5-6)  For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God  which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.  (1 Thessalonians 2:13)  …grace be to you and peace from God the Father,  and from our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins,  that he might deliver us from this present evil world,  according to the will of God and our Father:  to whom be glory for ever and ever.  Amen.  (Galatians 1:3)  JESUS PAID FOR EVERY ONE OF YOUR SINS …PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE… BUT YOU MUST TRUST HIM AND WHAT HE DID FOR YOU TO BE FORGIVEN!
A preseason game being number 5 on trending shows how far ahead the nfl is from other sports
The run blocking for the raiders is damn good

I know it's preseason and I'm glad football is bad, but the Jags had 10 seconds' worth of highlights in this game lol.
Chris Collinsworth said he was going to finish his story, and then it got cut off?  Great start to my morning.
offensive line was looking a little porish for the raiders. They gotta tighten that up, but overall not a bad showing from the young guys
Not a bad game just to be preseason.
Football is back boys
Football is back boys
Zamir white poppin off
I’m so happy football is back! raiders look good, hope that screen pass play calling works for them like it did for the Patriots… Football is back baby!
WE HOPE YOU ENJOY OUR VIDEO AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE USEFUL FOR YOUR LIFE.
Just the preseason but I really think the Raiders are gonna be a playoff team man! Only thing stopping them is their INSANE division
NFL IS BACK BABY!
Jags don’t front four look good
Nfl is back baby
#15
Man football is boring now
Dude at 4:23 straight up held that dude
trevon looks good man he was gettin pressure alot and zeus was great to go dawg
Love how it's preseason and these fools straight up hitting each other hard
Am I hearing things or is it Cris Collinsworth on commentary? What were the farewells for last season?
No big hits boys.  Don’t want penalty s.   And no hitting the QBs
let’s go baby football’s back finally
The last time the Raiders won a Super Bowl 39 years ago
The highlight video posted on the NFL website is JUST Jaguar highlights.  What filthy noobs is the NFL hiring these days?  18 Billion dollars of industry each year and they can't even post the right video?  Then what they do post is 1080p and not 4k because they've never upgraded the stadium infrastructure enough?  What the hell is the NFL doing with all of its money?
dang nice to hear a Husker is playing in the NFL, GO AMEER ABDULLAH, may have spelled his name wrong tho
This shows the raiders rookies got sum special going on
We made it y’all 🤩
Every first nfl pre season game comments every year: “I don’t care who’s playing or who won I’m just happy football is back”    indeed!
#RavensNation 🟣🟣🟣⚫️🏈🏈🔥
Football is football
Football is BACK!
8:28 check the delay.  The Ref in the Bengals game blew that whistle early, Raiders should have won that game. SMH. They just moved on like it was nothing.
I'll be when use the throwback lar n jag abbreviation
if y’all see davante adams reply wit a timestamp please
Jags already is mid season form
Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless him! Jesus died for our sins, rose from the dead, and gives salvation to everyone who has faith in him! True faith in Jesus will have you bear good fruit and *drastically* change for the better!  Have a blessed day, everyone! ❤
Football is back!! Congratulations Raiders 👏👏👏🏈
Why is it called the hof game. I’ve never watched it so I don’t really know
Fall and football 😁 Best time of the year!
Ahh football 🥰
https://youtu.be/0OqEPSROAsk HONEST OPINIONS ONLY
Bro Raiders Have a good ass rb room👀
Football is a dying sport
I cant wait to take all of your money in fantasy football.  Any leagues available?
FOOTBALL IS BACk!!!!!
Thats some good practice
doug pedersen offense is pure vanilla hope jags fans are ready for dissapointing season. 📉📉📉📉
McDaniels system looks sharp asf!! That’s the difference. Watch out for these raiders. Still have questions on D tho
Why was Josh Jacobs and Foster Moreau playing in this game?
Finally glad football is back 😀
Jesus is lord and savior

Welcome the 2022 NFL.🏉
Good to see football again, but I hope this is not the real Jacksonville run defense
Jacksonville's going to be disastrous this year there's season looks like it's going to be horrible again. The only other team that makes the browns look good is Jacksonville. They're so bad the browns will be better than them and that's hard to be for the browns cuz the browns are usually in the basement every year
What was the spinning kick from lol
Walker looked pretty good.
Nfl is back can't wait for the rest of the season.
Gonna be a long season for Jag fans.
@BarstoolSports Hall of Fame broadcast?
I'm not surprised the raiders won. I mean I would be surprised if they would of beaten the chiefs. Or cinci.
Does this count as a pre-season game or is this a throw away game?
3:38 I don't know if anyone else is into the small details like I am, but you can see the graphic for the touchdown at this timestamp still has the Bengals logo outline left over from the Super Bowl. Guess the production truck wasn't prepared lol.
"""one of the best thing about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves something .he always respect us , the audience and his team , and he is polite in all his videos .we congratulations ourselves on this achievement . more to come 💗
Footballs back baby
Football is back I’m so happy
FOOTBALL IS BAACCCKKKKKKK
Jaguars will own the top pick again.
Looking good, see some things that need work on , but a good showing
These teams both suck.
Tyron Johnson looked great he will probably be a starting WR with davante and renfrow
I like how the players put a lot of effort into this game to bring back football. What exciting start to a new season
zeussss
Jags offense needs to tighten up
We want Peterman
Nice to see the jags already in mid season form
It’s crazy how Trevon Walker’s first game he got three sacks just get ready for Trevon Walker to play other teams
Raiders pass sweeping Jacksonville to death .lol.🏈🏈
Football back
The NFL Commissioner needs to have a sit down with Jacksonville like "Hey, ya can't be good at everything... maybe you try soccer, badminton, golf?" Let's leave football to TB12 in Florida.
Football is backkkkk
That why preseason game important
I don't put too much into preseason but the Raiders looked crisp, Looking forward to this season. RN4LF 🏴‍☠️
Would love to see Grant Morgan do well in the league. Can't beat his character and work ethic.
I fell asleep in the 4th considering this game was dogshit. Also I use Jacksonville Jaguars toilet paper to wipe my ass.
Treavon was looking good out there
The oline will be much improved this year then the last. Parker thank god ain’t gonna he playing LT. I’m excited for the season ahead and next week we will be seeing some starters. 💪🏽💪🏽🏴‍☠️🏴
Jaguars already in mid season form
InConclusion the raiders can run the football or the jags still suck on dline the draft pic not t enough
Just win baby go Raiderssssssssss 🍻💯
JARRED STIDHAM GO BACK TO NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS NO ONE WANT YOU WITH THE RAIDERS
Backups or not the jaguars are still the jaguars🤷‍♂️
Feels so good to have football back
Sorta Boring.
FOOTBALL IS BACK 💓🙂
Football back🤪🤪🤪
Get use to this Jacksonville fans! With Trent Baalke as your team's GM, you will always lose and be among the worst in the league! 💯
Woo-Hoo football.....JAX defense looked pretty good...
I didnt even know there was a game 💀
That Jacksonville defense was 🔥 they’re offense was atrocious tho, stidham played really good too
Don’t sleep on the raiders this year
W
So, Jags last in AFC south???
Wait football started?
Raiders looked good even though it was their rank-and-file players
them new helmets trash to me
We all so down bad for watching this
Thanks #NFL for the free replies! It’s unfortunate you wouldn’t let anyone watch a freaking preseason game without signing up to pay for NFL game pass or whatever lol…. #Greed #FireRoger
The AFC west is not to be messed with.
Jags looked better with Meyer as a coach
LV has a nice RB group , Jacobs+Abdullah+White+ Kenyan Drake (when he comes back)
Man I missed football 🥹.
Glad football is back can't wait to see how my eagles look
I wish they would take those stupid"woke" phrases off the back of the helmets
NFL FOOTBALL IS BACK! LETS GO!!! 😄
I love how the jags and refs are already in midseason form!
Bro, my score prediction was so close. I guessed 27 - 18 with a LV W.
It might look like the USFL. But it's football baby. And it's back
MAC JONES TAKING THE PATS TO THE SUPER BOWL JUST KNOW I CALLED IT
Go Broncos!
Travolta walker first sack of pre-season 😀 of to a good start
Why were their 2 players with 31 on the Jags, can players on the same team have the same number now?
RaiderNation! Josh McDaniels scheme works baby!!
Yay
Raiders are lucky they got Josh McDaniels to coach his offense &  Stidham to back up   Carr and teach the Offense!
More proof that Brandon Parker is 🗑️
The NFL is back
So is jacobs out? Is that why they had him playing?
Football is Back 🏈
Leatherwood has improved a lot
Let's say goodbye permanently to Brandon Parker I also think they set Kenyan Drake up to fail by constantly running him right up the gut instead of any toss sweep or off tackle and that's not what he is designed to do so he's gone. Tyrone Johnson if he does not learn to catch I don't care how fast he is he fell down on the first drive which would have been close to a touchdown and he dropped a beautifully placed ball at the goal line
FOOTBALL SEASON IS HERE
Football is back
Football is back and your team plays the first game preseason or not is a blessing. AND WINS!
Football back whoo hoo
@58 sec “on second and 8 and Carr….stidham” 😂😂
The Jaguars looking solid! I give them a higher expectation then what I thought, they'll finish 5 and 12
Trevor Lawrence needs to be playing imo
Jags in mid season form 😂
Calm down everyone. It was the Jaguars...
Preseason count for them it count for us think they playing to lose that's dumb
Who didn't even know that they had preseaon already?!?!
“Football is BACK”
Footballs back babyy
Safe to say The Jags will suck this year
Everyone is underestimating the Raiders this year. Everyone thinks their getting last in their division. I get it, it’s a tough division, but their definitely better than the Broncos.
Is it just me or when you see a starting rb in preseason about to get tackled and you hold your breath.
It's  great to have football back
Football is back!!!!😍😀😁
RN4L 🏴‍☠️
Jags D-line has some real talent. The rest of the D....pshht.
Ima charger fan, screw Raiders and I'm happy football back
FOOTBALL IS BACK BABYYYYY
LETS GOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
Let's go raider nation let's beat the chiefs at least once this year
That new riddell helmet is ugly af. They need to change the face mask options. Looks like a kicker helmet
This might have been merely a preseason game, but I watched every single play, and let me tell you, those boys were hitting.  It had regular season intensity, if not playoffs.  People were getting lit up!  Hemet to helmet all night.  No calls.  Blew my mind.
Interesting Zay and Keelan having a chat. 😁
“You know i had to dig deep down inside”
The jags are trash
Our offense is going to be unstoppable I can see it already
We have 5 good running backs what  do should we trade Jacobs
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDERS!
Our running back tandem is going to be crazy
RAIDERS ALWAYS HAS A TRASH ASS QUARTERBACK
Omg idc if it’s preseason I missed football
NEITHER ONE OF THESE TEAMS SEEING THE PLAYOFFS.😂😂😂
Loving the way the raiders looked out there it’s that time of the year boys! Footballs back!!
Don't care if it's preseason football. I am real happy that football is back, especially after that insane off-season we just witnessed! Raiders looked a bit promising here. Can't wait to see how they do in the coming weeks.
Can’t wait to see this with the starters. McDaniels did it right this time. Lol. Tim Tebow
I thought i was watching marcus allen highlights 9:14 i see yiu zahir white!!!!
both georgia bulldogs showed out last night. zamir white for the raiders and travon walker for the the jags.
There's 9 minutes of highlights?  The only highlight for the Jaguars was 4 seconds which was the travon walker sack.
is it just me but the rookie RB Zamir White for the raiders looked amazing in that game!
Even though it's the jags&raiders....football is back
We are all jus here IN THE NAME OF FOOTBALL
Austin Walter is turning heads😱
As a Pats fan I hope the Raiders really excell, McDaniels has given us a ton and I hope he serves you guys just as well ^w^/. Just means I gotta tack on another team to root for, what's that, 3 teams now? xD
Chad Muma looked really bad.
Go Raiders!!!!
FOOTBALL BACK BABBBYYYYY
#45 for Jags Oman hes a problem 😎😎
The backup QBs are looking really solid.
Those new helmets without the top bar sucks trash
8:34 makes it seem like mike and Chris are laughing at the guy for wishing his grandma a happy birthday lol. I know it’s just the editing
Football is baaaaaaaaaaaaaack!!! LFG!!
I'm from the UK so I'm not very knowledgeable about the NFL but why do the players celebrate EVERYTHING, regardless of the score?
NFL is finally back. Now can't wait for season 2 for the Manning broadcast going wild.
That raiders O line already looking suspect. Lol
Was there any woke stuff?
Finally 🏈🙌🏾🙏🏾🏈
My boy Stiddy !!
Everyone can look good against the jags lmao, except the bills and colts of course.
Not suprised by who won. A good team vs a lolcow team.
-bell hooks (1952-2021 , Planet Earth) "Violence is boyhood socialization. We pull them away from their own expressiveness, from their feelings, from sensitivity to others. The very phrase ‘Be a man’ means suck it up and keep going." "La violencia es la socialización de la niñez. Los alejamos de su propia expresividad, de sus sentimientos, de la sensibilidad hacia los demás. La misma frase 'Sé un hombre' significa aguantar y seguir adelante".
LB 50 is being targeted by Raiders again and again. I can imagine how much he is in the tough situtation.
Cole out here killin it with that sick power rangers lookin helmet on!
Glad to see Josh McDaniels is doing good with the Raiders. As a Patriots fan, I will genuinely miss having him as our play caller.
Whelp, jags still suck
I  missed  the  1st  Preseason  game  again 3RD  year in a row   Lol   but  I'm absolutely loving that the   NFL  IS  FINALLY  BACK   !  ! L E T S   G O   💪  👍
Zamir white is definitely having a break out game in the near future...Jacob's and white 2 headed monster excited for the raiders ready to see the outcome 💯🦾
EVERYTIME THE RAIDERS SCORED THEY PLAYED RAIDER MUSIC... HELL-YEAH!!!
This was a boring game  Just has boring as watching my Chicago Bears play
RAIDER NATION!!!
I love seeing Jarrett Stidham starting a game. I’m still a pats fan but I loved Stidham
Yes football is back
Football is here🙏🏾 thank god
I Watched the whole game fellas even put a lil sumthn on the grill.  Football is Back Boyz its goin Dahnn
It's been like 10 years since football who misses football
RAIDERS!!!!!
more like a raiders highlights
I see you G Money!
Raiders O Line and backs look pretty good
FOOTBALL !!!!!!!
Ahhh man footballs bac babyyy best sport🔥
Idc if it preseason I got my fav sport back
Damn that Jaguars backup QB has a fricken cannon for an arm.
As i titans fan I really every year feel bad for the jags
Raiders looking well coached
Damn felt like watching the Pats vs Jaguars 😂 lol I love it
I love the amount of defensive plays you put in these highlights!
What about Bo?
So happy football is back
Beasack
Weak, watered down and starless NFL games. Why does the NFL need them? College does not need them. Why can't the NFL hit the ground running? If need be add these exhibition games to the season.
Let’s go.
so glad to have this back
It's the nfl, who gives a f...?
jesus, the raiders run game is gonna be vicious
ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALLLLLLL!!!!!
Fell asleep during these highlights.. weak
Football is back baby!! Fins up!!!
Hopefully Josh Jacobs can stay healthy this year because he is perfect fit in Josh Allens Offense. The Patriots always drafted Alabama running backs and used them in run and screen game packages.
look better than Carr
Football is back!!!!
I hope this is the new thumbnail template
That Jags defense ain't no slouch though
Raiders aren’t good, it’d their qb
Football is back 🔥❤️🏈
Loved the early Josh Jacobs usage! 🔥
*RAIDERS!*
Glad to be able to watch the Goat Sport Football again
2:36 "You know I really had the d!ck deep down inside" 😂
Feels good that the only sport worth watching is finally back.
Good to have Football back this season will be nuts!
Football!
Breaking News .....Jaguars still suck.
wtf?  We hear all the players and play by play for Raider highlights, and we don't hear anything but pieces of some feel good story or other BS when the Jags have the ball.  Obvious who the NFL wants to showcase.  NFL Highlight Films are definitely in pre-season form.
I’m just here because FOOTBALL IS BACK BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! By the way, My Steelers are winning the bowl this year 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Ahh the nfl is vack
Yeahhhhh Raiders 😤🐐
As far as I'm concerned, Trevor Lawrence hasn't earned the privilege of sitting out an entire preseason game. He was garbage last year.
Kneelers, no one cares about woke crybabies
USFL being represented by a TD pass!
Preseason or not jags are the same lmao
Ahhh football is back y’all 😍🤩🥳
well that game was depressing lol
I know it’s Jags and preseason and rookies and all, but the Raiders are lookin GOOOOODDD
Ahhhh good to be back 🙂
Raider Fan In The House: "It's Great To See These Guys Having So Much Fun On The Field."
It looks like the raiders have 3 decent qbs. Very good qb room
Why is it that raider's games always have some weird ass score? lol
The Jaguar’s need to sign a better QB back up because every since they drafted Jake the flake Luton he look like dumpster juice on a hot day smdh Trevor still have to prove he’s the man.
That was refreshing, preseason or not.
Smh same ol Jags. Move this team to London already. Raiders came into this game with some smoove play calling and ready to go. Jags stepped on the field looking lost.
NFL regular season is bout to be back. Were going back to back #rams
FOOTBALL IS BACK BABY
8:51 I coulda sworn this was about to be a pick 6 😂
Good to see some football 💪🏾💪🏾
You know it's football season when the jaguars gets blown out
Was this the dink and dunk (as shannon and skip say) to the RB game? Lol
I swear it seemed like the raiders were on offense this whole game lmaoo
Tre walker didn’t really do nun tbh
Why are the raiders tackling like that
Welcome back football!  Woohoo!!!!!!!
Its so good footballs back who ready
Football betting is back lol...LV -3.5 was money!
O line getting shredded 😔
*Trevor Lawrence is NOT an NFL QB !!! Fact !!!✅*
It's amazing that football is back this fast.
Football is back
Not a good sign for Josh Jacobs starting at RB in the preseason opener
The refs were calling the play dead so early!!!please don’t turn football Sunday into the pro bowl
The Raiders are garbage no matter which city they infest.
Pretty soon Jags fans will be crying to bring back Urban Meyer
So many fantastic guys on the Raiders tonight! I hope those who are unfortunately cut end up playing somewhere else, NFL or elsewhere. Phenomenal performance!
FOOTBALL IS BACK BABY ! SKOL !!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
preseason nfl is back & college football is back of the end of the month … im so happy i felt like i was about to lose my mind after the nba finals ended
Welcome back football...😀
Bro Jackson’s defense lookin nice. But that offense idk
Tis the season.
Raiders
My boy Benjie 🗜🔒
I want real football back
Another year of terrible defense and sucking dicks as usual jaguars always disappoints. I guess I’ll wait 10 more years..
Lucky nobody passed to a referee with all that black and white
Football is officially back
Josh Jacobs was out there way too long .
With the first pick of the 2023 NFL draft, the Jacksonville Jaguars select, Will Anderson, defensive end, Alabama.
The New England School of Run Game
Not tryna be funny but Lawrence need to play every damn snap the way he played last year preseason or not why is he sitting like he a probowler 😂🤣🤣🤣😭
Walter is nice :). nice footwork!!!
Austin Walter keeps playing like that. He’s gonna play for somebody if he ends up on the practice squad.
Jaguars had only defense offense is too suck
Yes Yes RaiderNation here we COME !!!!! Why some of the starters out there ://
Even in preseason, they still celebrate while down 20-0.  This is why I call them the Jacksonville jagoffs.
Wooo! So glad that we are now 6?weekends away from football!! I’m a Bronco fan, so I’m very excited to see how we do! There was sooo many changes for all the AFC West teams, curious how Pat does without Hill, who was the best deep threat, a top 5 WR, and a true #1. How Carr does with the best WR, and a true #1 for the first time in like 4 years. How Herbert does since the chargers won’t have to score 35+ every week just to win with Mack & JC Jackson being added! Finally how the Broncos do with Russ since we had several games last year that we lost by one score and two possessions, we go from having a bottom 5 QB to a top 5/6 QB! Shame Tim Patrick is out, because him, Sutton, Jeudy were one of the better WR trios in the league, but that just puts more pressure on Jeudy & Hamler to do good! Excited for the Bills, Dolphins, Rams, Lions, Packers, Cowboys, Bucs, Saints, Vikings, Colts, Eagles, Panthers, Bengals, Ravens, Titans & the entire AFC West! Going to be an amazing season!!
Bryce Crosby
Yea! Football. I can't believe it's almost football season. Fall is just around the corner!
dude that first hit on Stidham wasn't roughing the passer come on lmao. he still have the ball on his hand.
I know it’s preseason but this felt amazing lol
🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
What is this? Why are we not playing starters
Football is back thank you
Finally football is back
Was not the greatest of HOF games, but it is only preseason. The Raiders look to be on fire tonight, and the Jags need to work a little bit more on there team. #NFLISBACK!
Etienne didn't play?
Dude told his granny happy birthday after scoring a touchdown on national tv 👏🏿👏🏿💯💪🏿
zamir white lookin good, idk if jacobs will be in LV after this year
Who's ready to be fat a@# this season???
It's going to be a LONG Season for the Jaguars!!! 😝😆😆😆😆
who else missed football felt like It been 10 years  hi  the name is the ragereek   ragereek almarnio                  ragereek nicholson
Nick Mullens's first start was against the Raiders and he wrecked them 34-3. He looked like a freakin star but he didn't shine bright for very long. Now he's a backup for the Raiders if he can manage to make the 53.
I am not a Raiders or Jaguars fan  I just happy football season is back . Any Raiders or Jaguars fans on YouTube?  Props to the 2022 hall of famers 🏈
Remember guys, the preseason is important for rookies to make it to the roster spot.
Why is josh jacobs playing preseason with that injury history?
Las Vegas got a underrated RB group there. Jacobs, Abdullah is a solid backup, Zamir White was great in Georgia and it seems like Austin Walter can play too. And they also have Drake
Wow, still newish to the game but you learn something new every day. Had no idea there was anything like a HOF game. SO glad football is back, what a welcome surprise!!
You know summer is beginning to end, when the NFL’s Hall of Fame game is played. Training camps and other preseason games galore, all for the regular season to begin in about a month.  Welcome to 2022 football, America!
The fact that football is around the corner... Oh yeah 🏴‍☠️
Josh jacobs still looks like a beast
Darien butler finna be the snag of the year
That Riders Oline looks God Damn scary, I am kinda sorry for Carr and Jacobs i hope they will survive this year 🙏
02:38 "the -" what?
Hab soo krass Bock hilfe
Stidham is looking really good so far. Gonna be a solid backup for Carr
FOOTBALL IS BACK BABY! WOOOOOO #broncoscountry
Woot woot footballs bacc 😎🏈
FB is back, crazy to think I'm a bball player but I like watching Fball more and all this thanks to Undisputed, wish I could play it in my country.
Still haven't figured out how to properly edit an audio track lmao.
I've missed football, ot actual feels like ots been eons.
Football time ⏲️ 🙌🏼
Raiders look good,they really not hittin qb's
🏈🏉🏈🏉🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈  I'm ready for Some Football Go Seahawks
There's like 1 white dude on defense
Jaguars sucking as always
Football is back! 😀 Here is my latest episode from MAdden 22 Franchise https://youtu.be/bus6O819DO8
How patriots would it be if Stidham turns out to be a stud
Man Zamir white and Abdullah looked really good watching this game promising rb room for raiders to take pressure off jacobs
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🖤🖤🖤
It’s great to see football again, I’ve been craving football action since Last January. #TitanUp⚔️
Tired of seeing comments like "These games are meaningless". No they're not. The definition of meaningless is "Having no purpose" or "Meaning".  These Preseason games have meaning. They give the coaching staff a taste of what their offensive or defensive systems got in a live setting. And how their players respond to the change.  You can always tell if the system being implemented is a solid one if the chains are consistently moving on offense. The Raiders were moving the ball very well. They were keeping the defense on their heels all game.  Jacksonville looked lost on both offense and defense. That's not great to see moving forward towards regular season when the competition is tougher.  As fans you should want to see production moving the ball offensively. Defensively you want to see players fly around and always be in position to make plays and not miss tackles in the open field.  Also these preseason games are to show what the back-ups are capable of. If your back-ups cannot get it together in preseason what makes you believe they will in the regular season? Just saying.  Great effort out their Raiders. On to the next week.
Raiders runningback room looks stacked
NFL 🤑 🤑 🤑 million
Was that a hurricane kick?
Football is back LFGOOOOOOO
That upfront for the jags gone be deadly but gonna go untoticed cause lack of offensive scoring
The third year running back out of Rice Austin Walter look real good tonight,one thing about him he runs hard,and never quits churning them legs
Great true story-book title-"Cowboy Mafia "
3:34 Abdullah has to be up there for best TD celebration after this 😂
Louis Vuitton will be a super bowl contender this season
Ahhh New Highlight 🥹😍🤩
Being from Ohio and I still haven't been to one of these games makes me angry with myself 😂
Jacobs is faster
I know this was a HOF game, but damn they talked too much.  Good job #3. Lots of things to clean up tho! Love it
Everyone needs to use those new helmets. Keelan Coles brain would be mush after that hit. The slowmo of the helmet absorbing the hit is insane.
3:22 he put a visor onna a kicker helmet
GRANT MORGAN ON THE  SACK!! (WPS)
Finally. Football ist back! ❤️🏈
Football back I don’t care what 2 teams it is lol
#RiseUp Atlanta is going to shock yall this year. Expect us to make the playoffs.
Same I'm happy football here jaxs better win a game
They lost already he mad I seen this whole half game at restaurant cool davante mad
Finally, something to talk about at work
I really don't understand the point of putting Jacobs in pre season. Let Zamir and Abdullah get the touches.
RAIDERS!!$!
Let’s go PATRIOTS!
Jaguars in mid season form I see
Even if it wasn't a meaningful game, I was soooo happy to see some football and hear Collinsworth! Can't wait for the season to start up soon!
FOOTBALL!!!!!!!
Ayo, where is the first fg? Suddenly it‘s 3-0 after a Jacobs run?
God I missed football
OMG football is back Let's Go Raiders! 🙌🏴‍☠️
Crazy. My man Abdullah is now a Raider.
Football is back! 🔥💪🏿
Wow can’t believe football is back already. Still seemed like yesterday my pats got massacred by the bills.
Some impressions: I think White is Jacobs replacement. Drake is going to get traded as he just isn't impressive.
The Pros and Cons of preseason: Pro: Football is back! Cons: They're all nobodies and the football is ugly
I say Stidham wins the QB2 battle, and Raiders are looking good on offense and defense
Jags making Raiders look elite
Raiders will disappoint their fans once again.
yes sir football!
FOOTBALL IS BACK BABY
They both need to work on the offensive line and pocket pressure
LETSSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It sucks imma be in boot camp for the first 3 months of the season 😓hopefully when I come back my cards are doing great
Seems like Raiders offense could do whatever they wished most of the time - did the waterboy even run one in? But at least the Jags have a kicker.
Alternate title: NFL Commentary Out of Context
does anyone else hate those new helmets? the one that keelan cole was wearing? it just doesn’t look right to me.
Football is back baby yea
Football seems boring to me lately. Maybe because I've seen it all a million times. Or maybe it's the modern "dump it off, short pass, and yards after the catch game" with an occasional run or deep pass. Same with the NBA, bunch of 3's and one-on-one isolation stuff. I enjoy the sports talk videos more than the games themselves anymore.
I have a feeling the pats are gonna regret letting siddam go
And the crowd goes mild!  Was it just the broadcast's audio setup or was no-one there?
Just realized the girl interviewing Carr and Adams said at end: "I'm sure Jaguar fans are happy to hear that" 😂 dummy you mean us Raaaiidderrr fans
I’m glad my Raiders won this game. I’m glad football is back. 💯 #RaiderNation
Normally I like the Raiders but I can't root for them as long as they have that snake as head coach.
The Jags backups are trying to keep the tradition alive. They let Travon Walker play a few rounds and he was already putting on the pressure. When we get our starters out their in the regular season, it's going to be a different story this year.
Why in the world did they play Josh Jacob’s playing in pre season
Austin Walter looked nice out there!
Nothing like pro football
Football is back baby! 🏈
Football is back baby!!!
Yes! Football is back!!!
Raiders running back’s looked great tonight
DEREK CAR is a f*king joke.
We look good!!!! Love the depth in RB’s and they all performed
Just got off work and feeling hella better with the football highlights
#45 Chaisson gotta go
I can't wait for the January 1st game.
Yawn 🥱
FOOTBALL IS BACK!!! Gonna be a good season.
raiders speed should be a 99
How can you not show the first field goal in the highlights? What complete idiot is doing the editing?
So so happy ur back old friend 😭😭😭😭
ITS BACK BABY
What the heck is up with all these non-playing action interviews interrupting one two three plays in a row sometimes. Seriously?  ‘You faced poverty through it all…’ Really? Oh come on just call the game!
Finalmente un po' di sano football. Quanto mi è mancato!
Raiders looking GOOD!
zamir white looks gewdd
the raiders had some weird helmets
Raiders
Lmfao raiders are absolutely trash.
Mullins throwing darts and stidahm was slinging
I know it’s just pre season but damn the Raider RB’s look legit. Not sure I like seeing Jacobs in there that much but everyone was running the ball good tonight. If we can be multi dimensional with our running backs on top of having an elite WR core that offense could be seriously scary.
Had to stop by to give props to that spinning roundhouse from Abdullah though!
So even during preseason jags are trash? 😆
Is carr in the halifame  or what?
I’m hoping for at least one USFL player to make a 53 man roster
EVERY KEEP CALM, FOOTBALL SEASON IS BACK BABY!!!!
Ah yes the Jags looking like they are in mid season form already
Fall temps right around the corner, football is here, waking up on sundays and getting game day ready watching the 12-3:30 game highlights, waiting for your team to start at 3:25, the broadcasts switching over games cuz one of the 12 o’clock games is lopsided late in the 4th, family members and friends meeting at the game day spot and everybody bringing something whether it’s leftover beer from the night before or something to throw on the grill, fall smell is in the air, throw the football during halftime, life is good.
Leatherwood's pass blocking is still suspect, but looks much improved in the run game. Seems McDaniels understands he needs help and gives it to him.
NFL IS BACKKK
Jaguars d is Swiss cheese and will be all season
Ngl I got done with this game cause I kept getting alerts so that was nice. But overall I did enjoy some parts, but can’t wait to see the regular season.
DJ TURNER
Yall like tirico? I'm digging him with colinsworth
Her: How do you satisfy a woman  Me: 2:37
Zamir lookin ite
Would you just shut up?
FOOTBALL IS BACK BABY
Well Jags backups suck…hopefully starters are atleast some what good…lol
They were killing me playing Josh Jacobs 😬 hes a 3rd round fantasy steal every year but always gets banged up and McDaniels got him out there running draws my nerves are fried
Ik the raiders did their thing but the jags defense was lookin pretty good but there offense was horrible
Ik it’s preseason but I miss NFL I can’t believe it’s back time to enjoy games again
Better get ready for week 1 ⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️
Raiders running backs lookin good right now
Offensive line good  pro style run pass defense schemes
Just glad football is back
This just proves how bad the jags will be this season.
OAKLAND! 🏈💯
Good to see the jaguars in mid season form
Raiders are looking good this season
Raiders played really good on both sides of the ball I’m so glad Football is back !
Still way way way better than Pro Bowl games
Loving the new offensive playcalling go raiders!!
3:25 look at the slot receivers stance on first and 10 can you say RUN any louder 🤣😭🤣
Even though it was a boring game I’m so glad football is back 😊
Raiders O Line is deep
RaiderNation💪🏿🇺🇸💯🤣✌🏾
Be on the lookout for Austin Walter…I know it’s preseason, but if you watched him run he has the speed and the vision.
Every first nfl pre season game comments every year: “I don’t care who’s playing or who won I’m just happy football is back”  🤣 🤣
Thank God for football
So the legend begins JM the new John Madden Spooked let’s gooooooo Just win baby

*RAIIIDERS!!!!* *Football* is BACK, Y’All!!!!  🙏🙏🙏🙏 *PRAYING FOR AN UNFORGETTABLE SEASON!!!!*   *If I could ONLY PICK, 4 GAMES, to Win, this year, I’d pick, the 49ers, the Rams, the Patriots, and the Jags again.*  *But,* I’m hoping we can win *ALL OF THOSE GAMES PLUS MORE!!!!*  *GO RAIDERS!!!!*

Please don't judge them off this game guys there saving the real plays for the regular season
Zamir White gonna be nice
FOOTBALL!!!!!!🤟🏿😤
Do the Jaguars not know what defence is
#watchfootballlikeaman #stopwatchinghighlitesgoofy @rest of season
I'm so glad football is back I have not felt the same since the season ended last year cant wait to see what every team is gonna do especially my saints
HELLO FOOTBALL MY OLD FRIEND😭😭
3:33 Leg kick, roundhouse kick, jump spinning crescent kick. You don't usually see that in football!
So happy that football is back
As a Panther fan, Abdullah is gonna be a great RB to come in and give Jacob's a Breather. Really solid. Raiders look really competitive on all levels
I'm so freaking excited man, football is back 🔥🔥🔥
Fear Ameer!!!
I know we had backups in but jesus christ we gotta do something about the offensive line we gave up like 6 sacks. gotta have good depth.
Well my Jaguars suck as usual all right with the world
I know we had backups in but jesus christ we gotta do something about the offensive line we gave up like 6 sacks. gotta have good depth.
I didn't even realize it was preseason already
Die Hard #RAIDERS Till Eternity IV Life
so when's NFL top 100 players 2022 release?
Now only if I could afford espn
This off-season has felt so long lol glad football is back!
Raiders run game was good tonight all the RB played well
Football Is back 🤘
Solid run game by the Raiders
Jaguars already in midseason form
Screen game on point and HB toss play was solid to see as a raider fan gruden never ran these plays.
#justwinbaby
Let’s go Raiders! From all of the unprecedented adversity last year and still making the playoffs to all of the big name additions on both sides of the ball, the Raider Nation is set to make a huge leap forward this season.
Jags in mid-season form
I don't care if it is Raiders Vs Jaguars, I am just happy and excited for this NFL season
Jags already on form.
I was searching failarmy vids and this was in the search results. Wth dude
Can’t believe it’s football again 😭 let’s go
Finally the seasons back can’t wait for the patriots to play
Al Michaels gone to soon
The one aspect I've always admired about the Patriots offense was their screen game. Past Raider offenses seem to have only ran 1-2 screens or when it's 3rd and forever. I hope it's an effective weapon this year.
Josh Jacob looks pretty good.
Stidham can ball🔥
Boy it's good to have football back ‼️‼️
Football is BSCK
Jags are mid szn form already 😅
The teams Las Vegas and Jacksonville have really upgraded in head coaches from 1 year ago at this time. Coaches Josh McDaniels and Doug Pederson are so much better human beings compared to John Gruden and Urban Meyer. I hope neither team has to go through the off the field drama Gruden and Meyer heaped on the teams.
Im Most hyped for this season ever, its almost here!
Who here thinks that the jaguars would be doing a bit better on defense if they got aidan Hutchinson istead of travon walker
I thought the jags would be much improved
Jags picking up right where they left off last year 🔥
Yessir football is back
Man, this is going to be a great season! Raider nation looked alright today. Give the jags a few more seasons and hopefully they’ll have it together. A lot of teams got sharper this off season and I personally this is going to be an intense  #RaiderNation
Our O Line is gonna need help. RN4L.
Jacobs had a couple of good runs. Football is back baby ! Just win baby!
So glad The Raiders got the W for Cliff and Seymour. 4-0 in the HOF game. And the win for Josh Mcdaniels.Returning to his childhood stadium. #Raiders
Can’t wait to see my Chiefs play
Football is back baby
Don’t it just wanna make you cry that football is back
Were they alternating Stidham and Mullens?
Missed most of the game because I was at varsity football practice lol.  Glad football is back
Wow the raiders already look like a top tier Super Bowl contending team already should be a good season
Season back baby! Raiders win felt good too.
Wow can't believe football is back already 🙌🙌
Please for the love of God. Don't make me watch Brady in the Superbowl this year. That's all I want from this season.
Why did Devante sit out???
Always can count on my Raiders going undefeated in preseason.
#RaiderNation
It may be the first game of the preseason but it already seems like it’s going to be a long season for the jags…
Raiders Nation 🔥
So, what, if anything about this game was "Hall of Fame" worthy?? Looked like a normal ass game to me... ?
Finally
Jags are going to suck
Thank God Football season is back, it felt like forever!!!!
raiders play calling and execution looked well
Dang, Jacksonville's kicker almost hit a 60 yard field goal
LETS GOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! FOOTBALLL BABYYYYY LETS GO BUFFALO
Didn’t get to watch it but  Glad for highlights
I was so hoping the NFL would update the intro, to something like what they had in 2016, shame they're still using the 2017 outdated one. 😮‍💨
FOOTBALL IS BACK!!!
Wow can’t believe football is really back
Davi Belfort future Brazilian quarterback in the NFL 🇧🇷❤

Luv the Raider fans. Spat my face. Wearing  silver and black. Thanks! A non-game vs. a non-opponent. Woopdy!!!
Jags getting a head start on their losing streak.
Raiders killed it, plus it was awesome seeing a former usfl player actually being able to compete in the nfl. Sad thing is, he has had no breaks. Also the number one pick did not look too hot.
Finally we are back !!!!!!! Was getting tired of hearing which team KD is going to and is Lebron better than MJ arguments smh
NOOOOOOOO this means summer is coming to an end😫
I hope this scoreboard isn't used for the regular season
Raiders RBs looking nice
Raiders are not only gonna have a great run game due to scheme and improvement on the offensive line already but they will have the best pass catcher trio in the nfl
I was at this game and I had a blast. Even as a Jaguar fan!
Cowboys gonna be and underdog this year just watch y’all🤫
I'm so glad football is back. I'm gonna be watching every game highlights this year.
I Know It’s Preseason 🏈 Is BACK!!!!
Let's hear the bankrupt prison franchise Raiders fans hype up their team after their 2s and 3s beat the worst team in the league's 2s and 3s in an irrelevant forgotten preseason game.
Why can’t Madden have scoreboards like this?
LETS GOoOoOooOoOoo FOOTBALL IS BACK
And this is when a overzealous Raiders fan says... "This is our yeearrr daaawwgg"
Wow can't belive I posted a longer highlight reel of the game BEFORE the NFL did!!!!
Really liking the Raiders offensive play calling. Not watching shotgun formations almost every play is a relief.
Football i missed you!!😫😭🥺
Why is this called hall of fame game?
Jags in mid season form
Is anybody feels great that we have football back?
Travon walker is gonna be problem for lines
Read my name
Jaguars in mid season form
I'm glad Sloter got a TD this game! First player from the USFL to get a TD in the NFL.
There’s only two seasons: football season and waiting for football season. We’re back, folks.
Football is finally back baby
FOOTBALLS BACK
I know it's preseason but the Jaguars seems to get it much worse when it's come regular season starts. 🤔
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDERS
Why they playing Jacobs? 🤨
Carr and Adams are reunited!
Fooooootball
it's been months since the new NBC scoreboard aired for the Super Bowl....and I still hate it
Zamir White had some nice looking runs. ZEUS!
Best game of the year so far
Football Baby !!!

Raiders running those Patriots screens
This is the typical play style for the Jags.
Football is not back yet! This is just the Preseason and I don't really watch the Preseason because that's not important for me! Football will be back on September 8th!
Is there a other one?
Looks like the raiders are going 17-0
Football is Back! Yes Sir!
The Raiders are gonna be so much better than they were last year, and the Jaguars are gonna have some growing pains to start the season, but they are going to improve as the season wears on. I can simply say that football is officially back!!!!
