100k? Those r cheaper then normal cars on auction
LET ME SEE YOUR ID!!!!
bad acting
I figured he was gonna tell him he had a warrant.
I think I missed whatever point this video was trying to make. I'd like a refund on the 20 seconds of my life this wasted.
"Are you Daniel Mac?" "Yeah" "Okay get in the car you're getting arrested for asking a cop what does he do for a living"
"I am the man who arrests people who asks stupid questions" - says a cop silently
From the thumbnail I deadass thought it was Gordon Ramsey for a sec.
This is the first time I didn’t hear him say “your cars awesome”
Love this interview he sure didn’t say much tho
Man in police uniform    Stupid frauditor what do you do for a living.  His is a chef moron.
*”HEY, SCUSE ME!!!!!”* 🗣️🗣️🗣️ “Woah Woah Woah…. Stop yelling in my face bud.”
He's a corporate tax collector...

$100K? You think cops pay retail prices or something?
That cop almost ended what you do for a living he felt threatened
"Yo you wanna go for a ride? Hop in the back seat bro"
Imagine being black and trying this shit
Daniel Mac in prison: “hey what do you do for a living?”  Inmate: *I rape new inmates*  Daniel Mac: 😰

"Get over here. You're fuxking getting arrested"

Is being a prick with attitude a requirement to be a police officer?
Imagine a black guy do this :)

….needless to say, this was staged.  Anyways, since that clown was wearing the dark costume w/ a “badge”…how would anybody know if that’s legit or what kinda profession he’s into.
You can't park there..

Gordon ramseys younger brother lol
🐷
You guys really think this video is really you guys are a fucking idiots

Cop acting like a asshole. Nothing new then
Are you I heard you deal coke
That's Gordon Ramsay in his prime years before someone pissed him off.
He sounds like goofy from Mickey Mouse , “what you do for a living HUH HuH”
Gay officer ?
This video would have been more believable if you said that was Gordon Ramsay’s son. Your stuff is so unbelievable it’s cringe-worthy. Like people really know who you are. 😂
wha do u wha wha are u on crack
Gordan ramsis 😂
FAAAAKKKEEE!
When the police said "bro" I knew he was a fake police.

Skit
Fcking lame
“How fake do you want this?” “Ye”
Gordon Ramsay became a Police Officer?
hHaha
He was about to get arrested😂😂
I hate people who do this
You still do for living? Or just living for doing
This guy tries to make himself feel popular channel by staging people to recognize him. How are people fooled, everyone he talks to apparently knows his channel
Gówno
How come the cops are always in a terrible mood lol
The officer is just cool
Lol
Why stage this
I didn't know Gordon Ramsay had a side gig as a cop
All his videos are fake now smh
100,000? I thought they were only like 30k because departments buy them in bulk
Somehow every single person he comes across know that he's daniel mac and and does weird stuff. MAYBE it's because he stages his videos for money
100k/ year ? WTF ?
Look like Gordon Ramsay
That cop was a little harsh
He's a cosplayer
How's he got such a nice watch
Hahaha, good one.

Rolex Submariner
Clearly this isn’t real, but the sad things is that there are plenty of twats out there who do stuff like this. Stick a camera in a strangers face and act like they are acting normally, desperate for a reaction.
It’s just me who thinks this guys is annoying?
Shitty fake videos
How Abouts U...?? Mac
He looks like Peter Quill from the Guardians of the Galaxy game

You went to a cop car and asked what they do for a living...
In court  What do you for a living
😂
ACAB
This feels like something you did after a night drinking with your freinds
I know this is fake, but theres actually dckhead police officers that would reply like this. Makes me o sick seeing people that just cause they put a badge on think they tough.
He's Johnny Bravo for a living that's what. "Hu-Hu-Yah"
Totally not scripted 🙄
😂😂
😅😅😅
Lol
In Prison: Hey, What did you do for a living?
Harassment
Stop thr staged shit
Youre under arrest for too many tik toks
The valor tho 💀🥵
Gordon Ramsey lost son.
"Are you Daniel Mac? We have a warrant for your arrest."
He's a brain surgeon dumbass
Last milisecond: WHOO... 😂
Chef Ramsey 😂😂
What a waste of tax money
Ew cop and typically cop
Nice 👍🏿
Why does "Danial Mac" sound hammered af?
Nice staged video
🥰😅🤣🥰🤣💞
Fake
He barely off the baby 🍼.
Daniel Mac sounds like he’s smoked to many joints.
Obviously a librarian😑😐😑😐🙄🙄
Ford Police Interceptor Utility*  There's two types of Ford police Interceptor, this is the explorer 2018 version and the other one is based off the Ford Taurus and is called a Ford Police Interceptor Sedan, or FPIS.
Joe biden. Wo wo wo 😆 😆 🤣

Y is he laughing every 5seconds
Wild asl for running up on him like that fr

Gordon Ramsay
I am the only one who can tell his cities are fake
Staged.
Imagine if this was a black man.
I like the policeman!!!
this is so fakr
Those pussys makes 250 at year plus overtime
That stupid f**kin laugh - I can’t
all u had to do was follow the damn train,daniel...
I liked the officers reaction to being asked. Then he knew the Daniel mac name. I thought the officer was nice looking too.  No one should be asking on duty police officers for you tube. They need to be there for community safety. Ask them when they're off duty.
Accept we paid for those cruisers. Not him
He tells these people to pretend like they know him 🤣🤣
Lmao at anyone that thinks this wasn't set up ahead of time. Try running up on a cop at night while shining a light in their eyes. See how well that works out for you.
He gotta be drunk 🤣🤣
Hey why that cop look high
Thought it was Gordon Ramsey in the thumbnail
You’re videos are so fake and set up now they make me wanna fuckin barf
He is the archetype of a Yuppie Police Officer.   Reared in an Upper-middle-class environment.  Unsure what he wanted to be in life.  Not a Doctor or Lawyer or a Stockbroker.  And one day while sitting on the couch and strolling the TV stations.  He came upon an episode of COPS!  His reaction was this:🤔🤔🤔hum. And a few years later...Voilà, he's on candid camera 😁😁😁
God this is so cringe and fake!!
my guy has a rolex submariner thats worth 11k👀
gordon hamsey
Rip punitt rajkumar

My respect for the man and the cop 📈
2 stripes, he’s a bargent.
Arsewipe cop.
"What do you mean what do I do for a living, I'm about to violate your rights..."
Wow he was one rude son of a gun lol
God I hate you
He sells pizzas for a living.
I thought that was Gordon Ramsey
Cop with a good taste In watches 😏
Dangerous thing to do , bro . I wouldn’t be surprised if cop pulled his weapon on u for startling him . Know I would!!
Halloween costume 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Once do with Indian police 😂😂😂😂😂
He should do a video in cook county jail where he asks all the vice lords and black p stones what they do for a living
Anyone know what features these cars got that make them a hundred grand?
He beats innocent victims for a living.
$100k without college, what a bunch of bull crap. Pay them what an LA county social worker makes, what maybe 65-75k with a grad degree.
Handsome man police officer
You can not ask a question like this in Iraq  🥺😩😞
Dude should get an Oscar for this magnificent acting 👏🏽👏🏽
Is he Gordon Ramsay the american state jajajaj
The policeman nearly forgot what does he do for living 😄
bordy the mopar guy driving a ford??
This guys getting pathetic
what do i do for a living? im an arrogant chef on cooking channels
Did you hear that bro he said " woooooo " he happy :))
Poor acting
What are u doing fr living? Obviously he is in his uniform 🙄🙄.
100k For a interceptor??
Watching this video a few times that's a real laugh 😂.
You do get some intelligence people asking  real good questions!
Daniel? Firstly. Out of all Love. I want you to know that I'm not disrespecting you as a person in any way when I say this: "Don't disrespect or belittle a person of any profession because it is their job". At this point in your life,  you could be a big time executive working for a firm or  own your firm as a CEO, but? That does not mean your job is more important than a janitor job. Do you see my point. It is a job, no matter the salary difference. If you do this to offend another person with discriminating Job levels in society due to school difference,  your not respected, your only questioned. This is the real world, everyone is respected if they have a Job; Remember that! Also? Remember: "A rich Man was not always rich, he started from somewhere, or? His family heritage started from somewhere".   Thank you for understanding Daniel.
You are just getting content from this ppl
Trollll
Bro..that shit stupid
Another kid that got bullied in school. It takes about 5 seconds for me to tell this dude shouldn't be a cop like 95% of em'

Bro no one knows your name
Who the fuck is Denail Mak?
That’s one handsome police officer
he sounded drunk or high the way he was comstantly laughing like a bozo 🤡🤡
I'm more upset that police vehicles are now 100,000 per yet are only in service for ~4 years. What an enormous waste of taxpayer money just so they can justify an inflated budget.
I'm guessing Daniel Mac isn't black.
For a minute there i thought that was gordon ramsay.
Ftp
Its gordon ramsey
The cop should've asked him for info on all the drug dealers this guy supposedly randomly runs into
Fakest cop ever
Gordon ramsay

How much for a police car 🚓 100k 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ not true
Is that staged?
Can't wait for daniel to ask a cool van what he does for a living... instead he gets kidnapped while recording.
Darn he is so high on something, no wonder why he hides behind a camera.
👎
For a second he looked like Gordon Ramsay.
Yeah walk up to an officer aggressively with the flash light on your phone, it's really chill
one of the best ones so far
i thought it was gordon ramsay
Don't mess up Gordon Ramsay police at night, chef at daytime

This is a cop
"I beat my wife for a living"
Gordon ramsey its fucking cops
No black person can walk up on a cop like that .
He's not a real cop. I know that for a fact
I thought he asked: "are you down on crack?" Cause he kept laughing while pushing lights and camera on his face
ACAB
He seems like he's staring blankly
How staged do you want this to be?                  Sometimes
Does that look like a super ocean or  rolex sub on the cops wrist?
Wow what a loser
That cop is wearing make up
STOP THE IDIOT WHO MAKE FUN FROM OFFICER! IF THE MAN IS SO BRAVE TO MAKE STUPID JOKE SEND HIM TO WORK FOR ARMY OR POLICE !

Hahahaha
He looks like gordon Ramsay
GORDON RAMSAY'S LITTLE BROTHER
Honestly when I'm growing up first I'ma join the police force and then later join the military
daniel sounds high
Id shoot someone if then ran up on me like that
Love the vids but if you or any other color you'd be shot for doing that or beat and jailed or jailed I know it's way too real for the rest of y'all but half the country wakes up every morning and goes to sleep having to deal with that 24/7 365 I guess it's only a problem for those of us who see it
This is clearly fake.
The guys in the Ford make 100k. Nice
My response would have been "I beat the s*** out of civilians, yeah that's how I pay the bills and rent is due"
I actually know this police officer . He’s a cool cop , for sure he was clowning around lol 👮‍♂️ 😎
Goes to jail and when he's in the shower he's asking the guys there what they do for a living
Even dont know, who the fck is he
How fake do you want this to be? DanialMac: yes
I thought Gordon Ramsay is a Chef
omg why does every body that started off real and interesting turn fucking fake and annoying
I didn't know ford's were that expensive.
Never wall up unsuspecting to a cop if you are of the wrong color.
Fake
Anybody else see that big ass gun in the back?
He robs people. That's why he carries a gun.
bit staged... dahhhh
Daniel sounds hammered
For real 100k??? Nfw dude. I gotta look that one up wow

don’t go up so fast and don’t put the camera in their face especially in the night it could look like ur pulling a gun
Hey look, it's sober Michael Rappaport.
No city or state logos on car or shirt… you can buy a badge online🤔🤔🤔
Please be more careful when approaching an officer or anyone else in their car.
What does he do for a living though?
Interesting
So no one is going to talk about the cops rolex submariner…
Dannymac even getting the cops to stop bein pricks this guy a mufukin legend loooooool
He really intended to let the officer kiss his camera
This is staged 😂😂😂😂
Those videos are not natural. Guests/owners are informed and just play a role
Ummmmmm at least the cop is a fan
Cute
Fuck that police act like who is he.
If Bro was black he would’ve been dead walking up to the car like that.. smh the world we living in.🤦🏽‍♂️🙏🏽💯

Daniel just can't contain himself while laughing uncontrollably, the cop face, he feels like he is going crazy
Maybe the cop was just trying to ask him for an autograph
Mopar baby

The cop is wearing damn makeup 😂
Hahahahaha great vibe the police officer

Not sure who needs to hear this but if you’re reading this I hope things get better for you and your family. I know things probably have been really hard for some of you lately, but I assure you that things will get better. I’m just speaking that into existence for you. I feel like we gotta go through bad times to see the good times. If you woke up today you’re winning 🥇   I used to have 5 brain tumors but now I only have 2 left to go. I lost my hearing and also have seizures sometimes but just to be alive is a blessing amen? Amen 🙏 keep your head up and have a great day.
🤔what do I do for a living? NOT A FUQIN THING! Kidding.. I❤️Police!..I was talking about you Daniel! PS.. nice YACHT! Permission to board?.. ya, nevermind!🤣

You are under arrest for asking me what i do for living
Cop have been Mac-ed
Gordan Ramsay?!..
The Hair !
ACAB
Geus you famous now
😹😹
“What do you do for a living” “I’m a really bad actor”
Do Police there too takes bribe in return of a favor?
Comming up, daniel will ask the tank driver whom is an army, "what do you do for living?"
I thought he was gonna give him a ride in the car. 😁
That's not a cop.... Real one would have went proper beat down
El  cocinero Gordon Ramsés
seargent wasnt happy about Daniel
Why do sum white police officers  say the word bro.that racists&prejudices.😎
Is he still alive 🤔 Thought that I had all cops xD
😅😅😅😅😅😅
He's on duty  I think
This is stupid.
if he gets arrested he would start saying " hi what did you do to get arrested"
Wait, why can’t he just make real videos and actually ask people what they do for a living? At first I thought it was cool but the whole coming up to people from the side as if it’s real is so cringe. How can anyone enjoy videos that are all staged. It maybe is entertainment the first few videos but he’ll get his likes and he’s a cool dude so it’s whatever
DM got arrested for being DM 🤣
i love your prison room what di you do for living
Every vid he does is scripted because they all some how know someone who doesn’t even have 1 mill subs yet like wyf
Don't be their friends they're dirty
Swear that officer has something to hide
This is literally the most staged video i’ve ever seen in my life
I thought that was gordon ramsey for a second
These are so cringey and fake bro who watches this crap
That cop looks like a young offbeat Gordon Ramsey
Say my name, say my name, lalala
Cop wearing make up 👀
Too easy
When did Gordon Ramsey become a cop!?!
Ithokke kanumpozha ividathe policene okke eduth kinattil idaan thonnunnath⚰️
thought that was micheal rapaport
Still can't catch me on my bike
🤣👍🏻💯
"i arrest ppl"
Daniel Mac to Cop : What do you do for a living. Cop : We give tickets. You want one. Daniel Mac : Never Mind.
Gordon Ramsay Is still being such a douche... Ugh
Gordon? Is that you?
Love how he asks cops what they do and their answer is some smart ass comment with aggression or annoyance
how come this officer has a rolex submariner
License and registration pls🤣
So fake 😂
interceptors are like 9 grand used...
Damn they getting fake now 🤦🏻
...“I’m a stripper.”
Whow what how did you know,? What about my side hustle?
I thought he was gonna say we've got a warrant for your arrest.
These videos are shit why are they in my feed so much
Why do all his videos seem so fake and yet people watch them?
nice and funny dude inside of the car 😁
That’s nowhere near the price of that car lol
How an idiot content!!!
Cooking!
That's really funny🥰
That's a fake badge
Hey Kanye, what do you do for a living?  Kanye: NO WAY, IS THAT DANIEL MAC? I THOUGHT I RECOGNISED YOU
Easy .. lie, steal and incriminate citizens to meet their quota . All police do this
Daniel got lit and nearly f up
I swear I thought this was GORDON RAMSAY
It's all fun and games unless you are black
😂 he was messing around. Probably like you got warrants bud 😂
Don't get him wrong, he's trying to get arrested so he can go to prison and ask them what they do for a living.
Didn’t know Gordon had a part time job
What do you mean what do I do,I'm a body double for Gordon Ramsey😉
You can be runnin up on people, especially in the middle of the night man.
What the Officer meant to ask is are you high?
Cop looks like Jonny Bravo
Gordon blooming Ramsey you know 🤣🤣
Man he really stopped putting effort into these skits.
Gordon Ramsey when he was younger!!!
A cop with a Rolex submariner? How much are they getting paid
When he’s drunk
How do all these people know who he is? Something doesn’t add up
Why the fuck does he laugh like that
Another fake fake fake f****** fake repeat of somebody else doing this get some new s***
Daniel Mack: "What do you do for a living?" Cop: "I steal money from people by accusing them of things and if they dont pay, I threaten them and throw them in jail!"  Fuck cops!
funi
🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏👏
He looks like a multiverse version of Gordon Ramsey
Wht da fq.. hahaha bruv u seriously asking the cops??
Taxpayers are always asking what these sponges do for a living. Mostly drink coffee and act pissed.
$100.000 blue oval exploded pig interceptor
Get over her lmao
Does this dude only say  Yo  Bro What do you do for a living?
Total.bs YouTube need to removed these trash videos
Uuugh
Fuck the police
Well, it’s good he’s a Police Officer, because he’s a terrible actor.
Too fake...
This eyes 👁👄👁
This is fake
Man that cop was Tiny
How staged you want? Daniel gay: star trek
Fake ass shit.
Is he good at acting dumb or he is who will know
A police interpreter is not even close to a 100,000. They get those for like 30,000 bought in bulk. They're fleet vehicles
You must be afraid of police now 😂😂
And DM is obviously not black I don't know if a black man can walk up on a cop like that with a camera and some lights his life would be at risk 🤷🏿‍♀️
Who else thought that was Gordon Ramsey
I hate people who prank on-duty cops.
His laugh is very annoying
A question cops never get asked, caught him off guard it seems
I lock up people like U and off we go. Just loving it
Are you Daniel? No my name is : ‘what’s you do for a living?’
Why would he be wearing a rolex on duty. Lol
Fck cops
Gotta be the shortest cop in history
He puts innocent people in a cage and takes money in trade
He harassed black people for a living.
Gays
The cop looks like Michael Rapaport 🤣
America is so rich, they ask cops what they do for a living.
Okerrrrr
L.A.P.D
Acab
Moment of silence to people who think this is real
nice rolex officer!
supreme with out the patty
You asked the wrong person lol you should've backed up a little more that's invasion of privacy and you could've been arrested at that point
Cop has a Rolex submariner on so nice job
🌈🙄
Lmao these are just too staged, and you even remembers this guys name lmao he literally just films others
Corny both of them
I think it's better to respect the law and our officers from such vlogs especially when on duty. If this continues and encouraged it may set a wrong example in society. Let avoid to respect law enforcing team as their support has been immense during the pandemic...Good Luck Man👍
Maybe he doing something else. Investing in stocks
This is funny  Edit: thanks for the likes
The police officer called him bro hahaha
The cop is rocking a submariner...
Hilarious 😂
He kinda look like jake paul
basically daniel now introduces himself to people like ,"hey, I'am what do you do for living?"
As he steps down, out of the cop car. (Pocket cop)
Bro got the shotty and AR ready
His vids may be ok, but seriously he's now made probably a fortune from just being a nosey fuck??.......hope everyone with a normal day job realises how bent over you all are right now....
Hmm cop’s got a Rolex Submariner. Do police officers get payed more now?
These feel fake
Daniel Mac is a jerk. He has no respect for police
What kind of hairstyle is at on a cop head
This is obnoxious
Why did he do that?? Plus it’s an Explorer
I just get curious thinking the fact that how every single person who does something for living knows Daniel Mac ?🌝🌝 All hail god Daniel 🌝
And the emmy goes to.....
Is that a trick question asking police officer what they do for a living I’ll tell you fuck all they’re the most corrupt pricks in the world  American cops are useless mostly steroid filled arseholes
Officer Ramsay
I'm confused by that last part
Police officers do not make 100k
MAC , WHAT YOU DO FOR  LIVING ?🤣🤛
Nice Respect
Daniel mac lols
Dude waxes his eye brows for a living.
Im almost 100% sure that these are scripted
Im not hating on this video i love this channel . i build ex cop cars that car is not 100k its more like 70k .
🤦🏻‍♂️
A cop car is 100k wtf
Always assholes
$100k ? I guess it’s possible. Interceptors have different cooling packages and modified drivetrains in some cases.  Then there is the body protection, push bar, racks, computer, custom rear seat, lights and the communication hardware.  It’s definitely possible, especially if it’s a Tahoe.
Is that Gordon Ramsay?🤨🤣 that's so cool!
Lol
A gordan ramsey with no eye brows
Cop with Rolex!!!! Damnn
I don’t think those explorers go for a 100k maybe 40-50k
Fake
Stop with the laughing already, I wanna slap people who act cute when someone is obviously not having it.
If this was black man walking upon a cop this would be a different story...
This guy 100% checks himself in the mirror
How does the cop afford a $12,000 watch?
The police man looks like niketa mazpin but also is fake as he’s a fake driver
Who wants to be in the race for the most fake video? Dan Mac : I’m in !
Too easy
Too easy
100k eh? “While there is some variability in how much a Police Interceptor Utility may cost, according to Autotrader, a brand-new 2021 Police Interceptor Utility may start at about $42,000. For comparison, a regular Explorer will cost about $32,000, which means that the cop version will be about $10,000 more expensive.”
Thats no cop, he's a bosley hair club model.
Rip to this channel as well
Most annoying form of tiktok.
Looks kinda like Mopar Brody
FAKE VIDEO
"ok so I need you to ask me 'are you danielmac'"
Gordon Ramsay is a cop?
Cringe.  Not funny
These videos r getting worse n worse more an more cheesy an too obvious that it’s scripted
The cops brother works at a dodge dealership lol
But never wanted to be on social media while I was there
The badge should be clue on what he does. It's just another gang patch. Murder, corruption. Fire them all and start over!
One time of those when you ask cops you'll get arrested
This is not $100,000 this is one of my cars don’t lie
Imagine getting arrested or handcuffed by this cop looking the way he does with that hair 😂 would be the most embarrassing thing ever lol.
I actually have an old mate and his name is Daniel Mac and no body knows who he really is...just like you
I refuse to believe anyone would recognise this guy
😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡👻👻 clown 🤡 got clowned!😂😂😅
He turned to Goofy really quick
#sanctionpakistan #saveafghannationals #savetheworldfromterrorisexportingcountry
Ayyyyy police impersonation, nice
Jesus was crucified , bore our sins in his body, he rose from the dead in 3 days, trust in him and gain eternal life. Without him we are lost
Fake ash
As soon as he said “are you Daniel Mac?” I knew it was 🧢 no one with a even a halfway decent life knows by name some jackass who asks strangers what they do for a living for a living
Cops wearing a submariner on patrol, fake
Fake
FORD CROWN VIC IS BETTER
Beats the guy behind the camera
Bro Stop Irritating Or Troubling Th Police its not Good
Yo Mac you lucky you ain’t Mexican or Black bro Kuz that cop would have smoked you. Shit I would have to , I ain’t gonna lie
Stop with theses random fakes...
Ain’t no way this many people know who this dude is
running up to a cop car with something in your hands, yelling, then practically reaching into their window. Seems unsafe. Def staged.
thought that was gordon ramsay
This channel is a huge joke
A ford explorer ain't 100k even after they put all the lights and equipment in it.
Young Gordon Ramsay
I think he is a stripper
Wtf i thought it was chef gordon
the police got a rolex😨
Too easy
Cop got out of the car and got shorter🤣
Anyways... he has a rolex sub
Your videos were better before all the scripted bs
Не опасно так резко к ним подходить, когда он ослеплён?
We still don't know hat he does for a living though
Dude this cop is the owner of Drivela on IG haha
It's almost like he was sitting outside his house and was getting ready to knock on his door with a warrant for arrest . 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
“How fake should we make this?”  “Yes.”  Edit: holy cow you guys! I bet you were expecting one of those “this blew up” edits....nah son, miss me w that g*y sh*t. *dabs violently, skateboards away*
Part time cop, fulltime hair model.... 😆😆😆😆
So fake...
Why tf is this shit trending
Yeah thats probably real..
Is that cop wearing make up?
The cop was so close.bdamn.
Those Explorer Interceptors are not $100,000 ... maybe 40 grand a piece
i think the cop is a very funny person  nice to see police i us joke around in sted of shooting around
"Wait, are you Daniel Mac?"
https://youtu.be/Q9TZBv65gdY
ITS FUCKING RAWWW *weeewoooweeeewoooo
Can't imagine the police calling some random a bro
So I get Daniel Mac is a douche bag. ? That’s my take
Arranged as usual. The videos are quite fun to watch though
Those things do not cost $100k
bro in your country the officer isn't frendly
How fake do you... Yes
Idk man seems kinda sus with the rolex on the officer. Then again, it could be a gift, or family heirloom
Nice watch officer🔥
Gordon Ramsay

Sheeesh that was too easy
😎✌️
This guy needs to stop seriously it's enough !

Next up: visiting inmate cells and asking the same question staring at Grumpy faces 😠
Imagine a black guy doing that on an officer. 🙏
His eyes are pointed outwards. I would hate my life if i was him 🤣🤣🤣😂😂
God these are so fake it actually hurts
How fake do you want this to be ? YES please
I assume this is campus police with that nice ass temper lol
To be honest we need more positive police interactions like this going around that could be the medicine to our sick society
I thought it was Gordon Ramsay🤣
He doesnt even own the car, thats county property
100k for police car ?
Too easy
That cop was litt you can see it in his eyes

When the police will tell to his friend and his friends call their big boss . Then their wanna open bottle and cheers up 🥂

I thought that cop was Gordon Ramsay at first glimpse! Lol
That’s hilarious!!
Cops playing it like it's call of duty next minuet ten people have been dropped with a renneti

I love this police who understand humor
He quickly hit the donut
Since when did cops wear Rolex subs?
Yeah don’t fuck with police officers
He looked like Gordon Ramsay.
His “HEY! EXCUSE ME” sounds so Scottish
This is so fake ☠️
Man went crazy to ask the ops what they do for living
I so jealous because i live  in iran   with a shitty police...
So rude bro..
How fake do you want this to be   Daniel: YES
Damn that police officer was probably gonna go Scorpion on him after he said that
He looks like young michael rapaport
This is going to be the most fake video yet that cop is such a bad actor acting like he didn't even know he was coming and approaching him 🤔
There is a 98% chance Mr.Mac is intoxicated 🤣
Too many cops playing around and need to be patrolling the streets. This guy's trying to look too Hollywood. Do your damn job. No wonder people want to defund them.
Good on the cop for not even jokingly say "you're under arrest" as much as he said is as much as he can say.
He sounded fuckin plastered right here
Police with Rolex?
aRe YoU dAnIeL mAcK?!? Fake af
Not so funny like you think about. Hello from ProPolice channel subscriber.  Watch some content of those and then try to laugh on your joke with on-night flashes for officer's face.
Michael Rapport son
Get over here
See that officer face man does are one of them, that like to harass people.Daniel you lucky you white:)
If you already know he's police, why still asked what do you do for living 😑😑
Cringe pill 💊
That police officer looks like stuntman from neutral drop 😂😂 especially when he said get over here
Dmac shocking the officer whit his loudly voice😂😂
LAPD doesn't chill in the squad car with the windows down. I don't think any officer does. That's academy 101. I've seen since do it, like in nice suburb areas. Nvr IN the city though
If only that was a black man, I can't imagine 🤣😂
What's that song that u use at the end of your videos that u post on snapchat as episodes..that sounds very cool n I want to know what song it is!
Daniel was drunk 100%XD
Come on man this is staged. Lol
Acting
Lol for a moment there I thought Gordan Ramsey finally fulfilled his childhood dream of being an Officer.
Dude!!!! YOU SHOULD COME TO TEXAS. I’m the woodlands there is a car show that has so many good cars and sometimes a Bugatti shows up!
What you do for living? Me: breathing 💔
Omg.
these are the ones that make me almost certain their all fake now
100k lol
Wkwk 😂
When the officer knows Daniel mac 🤣🤣

Daniel love from india
He got pulled over by Mac 😂
In germany Cops dont Call me Bro 😔
LAPD don’t like cameras 😂
Bro he was coming out to arrest you😂😂
When the officer said ''get over here'' did he mean it as he's going to arrest him or take a picture with him?
He was stoned while filming this 😂
😂😂
Its like asking a millionaire how much money they have
Were you high that time ? 🤣
And then he wrote you up for .....something.
Cool
😂😂😂
Why are you staging videos now? The past few have been porn level acting...
First
