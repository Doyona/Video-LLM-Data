I like how the story was told. Can't deny Tyga been in his bag since day one, but that HIPVIEWS DAWT CAWM boost is on another level! Dude’s literally unstoppable now. 🔥💥
First time hearing & seeing.   White Chicks got these ninjas being beechy & I love it.  They ugly though.😂😂🤣🤣😂😂 YG, BIA, & 21 slimed this song.  "Have no time to drop tears bc I hop in liers."  "Fuck me in the car Im in a rush, u know I'm busy." (that's how I got preg with a son)  And did to both.💪🏻
BIA was cold on this 21 dog walked it too

No Cap but, YG ruined the song. This production style fits BIA, Tyga, & 21 so well.   They had that bouncey flow. YG sounded like he couldn’t keep up with the production lol

So YG and Tyga got trough their humiliation ritual eh?
Sad music
YG finally got to be himself. Blud was on set brushing his blonde hair. Bro, has that bad bish attitude. Tyga, Is from the suburbs and has a better flow than misses YG 400, RIP Slim 400  was a real one. YG failed blud he was too busy picking out wigs with tyga to have his homies back. 😢 weirdo behavior
These Grown men, dressed up like women.
You're all brainwashed - TIME TO WAKE UP!!!
Plain Jane Rollie cost a whole half a ticket (facts) Worth eight figures, ain't no such thing as trickin' (21) Should've been a farmer, I be chasin' after chicken (21) Focused on the money, that shit come along with bitches (21) No love for the opps, they get knocked out their britches (pussy) Jump inside the box, spin the block 'til I'm dizzy (pussy) Fat transfer, if you ain't right, I get your titties (fat) Fuck me in the car, I'm in a rush, you know I'm busy (21) Drove out, fuck a superstar and made that bitch part of my rollout Rappin' all that tough shit done got his ass hoe'd out You can't buy no ticket to my show 'cause they be sold out Security wanna search us at the door when we got poles out (21) Bad bitch got her ass out You ain't really, "Gang, gang," nigga, you a mascot (pussy) Check my bank statements, you a pass out You need people like me to point and call the bad guy
Reduced his Patna to a hype man damn
This gay

Searched for this to understand the difference between Tyga and 21!
low-key everyday vibes
Wonderful, $@#&%*!!
Tyga was with kylie when she was a minor and yall still celebtate him. Yall make me sicc.
so no one noticed that the first notes are exactly the same as the emotional naruto ost?
fire
This is what they have the true descendants of Jacob AKA Israel worshipping loosening everyone who listens to this music and worships this music Straight to Hell. There is not one real woman in the music industry and there's not one real woman in Hollywood there's never been a woman as a first lady they're all transgender a drowsiness every single one of them from the beginning of time there's never been a real woman in Hollywood or the music industry never ever never was never will be there's never been a real woman in the White House never was never will be these people are fuel for the Hellfire that has yet to be created because it's made out of Flesh and Bone. And when your flesh Burns off is replaced over and over and over and over and over is replaced over and over and over and over for eternity so does that make you feel all warm and tingly inside evil entities are going to burn forever and when their flesh Burns off it'll be it will be replaced forever so they can feel it forever or when is coming real soon
God 🙏 is good blessings to everyone
I’m really crazy

WE KNOW THE TRUTH‼️
They’re all awesome with this collaboration of artists. However, YG is my dude. When I went to his show last year, his performance was bad ass…PERIOD. Like he has that swagger and talent. Loved how he kept it real and played his old stuff and new…and still shows up to feature with new artists… underrated rapper y’all
They don't have God
YG

“Shoulda been a farmer I been chasing after chicken”.      21 Savage

Man the agenda is REAL!!!!
I wasn't a 21 fan at first but this man gets better and better after each album and feature. This is definitely a summer slapper
Dave Chappelle was right! They will take the most masculine black man and put him in drag.  Director be like "it's okay because it's only a disguise"
🤩🤩🤩
21 said I'm worth 800k it ain't tricking, I don't give af how much money you have if you paid to play you ah lame. Bought ah 👜 or shoes traded anything😂

#DIAMONDLIFE #FOCUS ON THE MONEY THAT WILL COME ALONG WITH BITCHES
Wack Long live ruler
LLTR WKTT
Tyga & YG the new calabasas sisters 😂
Seems like an ad hominem , being the, as usual, result of a generic inadequacy to form any sort of coherent argumentation against my points. Cannot say i am surprised.   Quit trolling girl, I am the superior one here .  Who you like or do not like is hardly relevant for intelligence . Because you simply are offended by me , and therefore do not like me, when in reality my erudition far exceeds your own , if you indeed had any at all , which is not the case .  and Hahahaha , yeah , it's hard being pointed out on your hypocrisy, isn't it, girl? Moreover , this pathetic attempt at superior condescension does not impress me . We both know both my grammar my maturity is quite a bit more grandiloquent . After all , you are vexed by a simple internet discussion , as your rejoinders evidently prove . Such wrath is the symptom of a depressed soul , a soul struggling with an inferiority complex , as you are .
21 went hard
💚💓🌐
Long live drako this shit is wack!
North west south east go north Sacramento California apostolic devil and the god Jesus Christ name amen

Turn this shit off and dislike immediately
21 hits different
yg looked like khloe kardashian
Yeah the old good Yg! I can hear from his voice that found himself,so glad
21 🔥🔥
Humiliation ritual
Banger
The marketing build up to this song is a so amazing. YG and Tyga are so American dope. BIA is in her own lane 🔥 How’s 21 Savage gonna have the dopest verse? We gotta import 21 Savage stateside!
Nahhhhh mannnn this video it s crazyyyyy🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
They turned into the kardashians with those masks 😂

Is this a Scott Storch Beat? 🤔
Another all immigrant alliance. BIA is a white woman and can not say the N word. These people are non FBA/ADOS/Freedmen. They are not Native Black Americans.
🔴🔵🔴🔵🔴🔵💪🏾😘💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💯💸💸💸💸

I'm glad SIM 400 wasn't here to see what Y g's doing oh no that got me thinking that maybe he was YG sacrifice to get into that next level
Imagine being a big time blood gangster and I guess tyga now starting to try to be a crip although for the longest time he was trying to be a blood so I guess it makes sense Tygas always been a lil confused but yg smh how u gonna explain that 2 the streets an expect 2 be taken seriously!
Imagine what YG and tyga would do behind closed doors for some 💰 if they're willing to get dressed up in dragg just cus the music label 🏷 wanted them to!
Bro they must have deleted all the comments about these guys really dressing up I understand putting on a wig and a coat but they got a full fledged makeover if that aint tell u who these niggas really is I don't know what will!
You know lil Boosie about to lose it.
3:25 “FACTS 💸” that was fire as fuck
21 Savage the NERD Boy

@yungdoe @bayboyplayboy #YungDoeNewCali #TheDorianSF #TheDorian 👌🏼

Dam yg really fell off .
POT FARMER DANCE SONG $ I got out my pipe stuffed it with pot You better believe it held a whole lot. I whipped out a lighter thumbed up a flame Sucked down that smoke which comforts my brain.  I tried alcohol smoked cigarettes They did nothing but give me regrets. My mom had arthritis could not walk around I rolled her a joint she danced on the ground.  I thought I was losing my lovemaking knack After I smoked some to me it came back. Soon I decided prices were high I searched for some ground I wouldn't have to buy.  I bargained for seeds from smokers all around  Got in my truck and drove out of town. I walked through the woods where wild birds nest  Found me the meadow I thought was the best.  I dug up the ground sowed all my seeds Said a small prayer for strong, healthy weeds. I watered at night with a five-gallon pail  Mosquitoes went hungry for I wore a veil.  Seven months went by; I thought I would die Till the Halloween moon was high in the sky. At night I went out, in a camouflage suit  Used my corn knife to chop down the loot.  I hung it up to dry where it couldn’t be found. Came back and got it, when it had turned brown. I trimmed off the buds, stuffed them in bags Called all my friends and passed out free drags.  In less than a week my crop was gone  I flew to St. Thomas with a love hungry blonde!!  By Kansas City Poet Tom Zart Google = Most Published Poet On The Web Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share! Google = George Bush Tom Zart Google = Pot Farmer Poem

Isn’t that the Initiation
Love tyga ❤️❤️

First of all, whenever I hear "bia bia" I know I'm about to watch that shit 20 times in a row at least. She's infectious. Also, exactly how long did 21 start sounding like this bruh? Feels like every Ft I hear with him nowadays is heat.

Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life3

tyga's verse was better than i expected
both tyga and 21 savage nailed it
❤️❤️❤️❤️‍🔥
Why didn't they just get Terry crews to play his character from white chicks?
Why does tyga still rap with those high-school bars
Need to put G-Eazy on this asap!
Definitely Kim and Kylie
Damn 21 bad
Don't Promote tyga, he a chomo
Для русский заблокировали но русские всё равно тут)
This a whole banger 🔥 they came in with the 2022! This is far the best song of the year, my top 1!
We know the truth
I know some dont want to hear this but it needs to be said..For the rapper, drug dealer, prostitute, homosexual, partier, fornicator, drinker, drug user..Jesus is willing to accept you just the way you are.. Jesus died for all those and every sin and all a person has to do is believe he died or all your sins (past present and future) and you are justified in the eyes of God and will have a relationship with him forever
Nobody in the world loves gay people more than Jesus Christ. He is willing to accept you just the way you are. All you have to do is believe Jesus died on the cross for all your sins (past present and future) and you will go to heaven; no matter what sin u do it is still forgiven
Literalmente  el 99% de la persona ignoran este mensaje: Dios te guarde a ti  y a tu familia de toda enfermedad
Who here after watching 5150 Show? 😂😂😂😂
Gheeeee loved the story 🤍😭
I see 21 didn't put that wig on
HAHAHAHA to the people who said YG and Tyga were going through their embarrassment ritual by dressing as women.. See, it was just a film clip.
Run by YG @t
Lost a ton of respect for Tyga and yg frfr can't believe they did that (they not from West Coast no more)
<333
Look for them Symphony Dance with ums  juliard think of me
Luke fold um sim fa knees
21 $avage to the Bia was fantastic
These men are weak af
21
Can't stop listening this banger 🔥 BIA slaying as always ❤️🇧🇷
21 don’t disappoint
Tyga 🌊🌊🌊🌊
💚💚💚💚
nigga real life
Ngl I thought that was Khloe and Kim…
Khloe and Kourtney Kardshian 😭😂😂
The Scarface references🤌🏾🔥
Are they trying to tell us something...???    It’s ok
I ain't say shit
YG real nigga, always got love for Tyga
Very impressive how Tyga got dropped from Young Money , reinvented himself... And now he's literally a sound .. damn
Everybody trying to be some white woman.
Sounds like something G eazy would be on.
Who thout dressing ass a women was a good idea
Wow my niggas take they hood pass
Blueface should have been on this
these the 'girls' from white chicks?
Killer Mike did it better
now thats hiphop
Tyga is whack
BANGA🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Maaaaa mannnnnn
Tyga went in I take that back, they all went in 🔥
Bia and 21 go so crazy together
We know the truth 🙄
Bia verse was not needed.  Keep these 304 in the kitchen
21 actually hit well on this, starting to actually become a fan lol BIA WAS LIT
🦾🇨🇻https://youtu.be/HSav9Wa7Jj0
Why YG look like khloe kardashian
Show some love guys https://youtu.be/xW0uhxcHjQ4 👈🏻🙌🏻💯
I live for these funny as s music videos 😂
21 never disappoints!! Bia killed it, per usual. I'm loving watching her come up
Ain’t no way I just found this song
21 on a roll
Yes sir shit Tight that's West Up yayyay
21 said I ain’t wearing that shit 😂😂😂
21 savage🔥🔥🔥
man people acting like they dressed  in drag for a ritual man im so sick of the internet trolls these guys was shooting a video smh these people will never understand art
Wow so crazy
rUn tHe bAnDs uP
AND the song trash
That drag shit and this gay agenda need to stop.
I just want to say this, this music video was fire! There’s never a storyline anymore with these videos, nothing that makes me say “oh shit 😳”. This video gives that shock value. It’s gives “White Chicks takes on Calabasas”, Hulu give them a season 😎
The irony. This was SUPER creative. Can anybody guess why they robbed the bank as white women? I bet that was YGs idea. Dude is brilliant
21 at it again!!!!
love that westcoast vibe👌🏼
Just another Hollywood humiliation ritual on the black man, it's the price to pay if you want to stay relevant in the industry.
Is that cardi b robbing the bank lmao
I would expect tyga to dress up like a woman not yg sad what people will do for money and fame smh
Bia biaaaaa🥰
Tyga ta de blood, mas esse beat é pra fazer C Walk
Funny how killer Mike also just dropped a track called run
Dam! You niggas got played! I know this wasn't your idea dressing in drag don't matter what it was for!
GTA V ONLINE OwO
21 had the best verse just saying
GOD please bring TUPAC back.
Run it YG
Trash
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
So Bia is not fully opposed to getting backdoor?
Bia killed this, go cath them my orange queen✨
LMFAOOOOOO
21Savage ft Bia seria um hit🔥
21 and Bia snapped
Bia canta bien ricooo! 😋
🇧🇷🔥🔥🔥
We know the truth.
Heeee yes is lite
yg nice scn bayb nice goodjob team/best Always
If I see 21 I'm in
B I A  💜
Tyga really came back like his hairline tho... props to the kid for staying relevant for so long.
So yall done with the whole "black men in dresses" thing... because they didn't have on dresses... they are disguised as women... which is done alot... to get away with shit
dope 🔥
as branquelas do crime kkkkkkkkkkkk
Wonder how long they been wanning to come out like dat 🤪👯‍♀️
FOOS GGAAYY ASSFKKKK FOR DOING THAT😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow🤦🏾‍♂️
Tyga that’s my favourite rapper of all time🤘🏼🔥💯✔️
I don’t know what me and the distance between me is the rap industry is but I want a lot of kids and after I get hip hop money I want to create multiple Fortune 500 businesses
Money not all.
its just tyga
These men are satanic you guys need to stop falling for it they dressed as females and them driving away with the license plate run was a message that we all should run because its getting darker and darker to the point so called gangsters can dress in drag and nothing happens to them and y’all say its dope and its art And its hard smh 🙏🏿 The Most High is coming and I’m sure y’all wont play this song in front of him then so don’t do it now repent because the kingdom of Heaven is at Hand
Definitely here for it .. u did that video.. ayyy #NoScaredMoney YG 💯
Real  💣💣💣💣🇩🇴🇩🇴
YG and Tyga go in soo hard on this right here, straight up BANGER! He aint like all them goofies and opppas who just be usin dat *AU* *THEN* *TICVIE* *WS* dawwwt cawwwm jawwwn to go HAM... SMH seem like anyone can go big these days...
Bars were on point but, they're emasculating our hue/blk males.  Why are they in drag?  Could've did a million different scenarios than tht.  Da 🌈 agenda is real! smh
21 made this song 10x better
HONESTLY JUST CAME BECAUSE I SAW 21 SAVAGE THIS IS A HARD TUNE - GOOD OLD SCHOOL THROW BACK
The highland park shooter was dressed as a woman to evade police.. way to help society gangster rap! #theCULTure

2.2 M in 10 days WTF?? !! NO NO NOOO I NEED 100 M !!  Respect and Brettings from México.
Why does the blonde look like Khloe
If this isn’t the biggest collection of mediocre rappers possible! YG’s flow is stuck somewhere in 1993, Tyga (or maybe Tyra) looking like a thugged out Arab, the girl looks like any crack fiend possible and 21 Savage is just awful as always.
Tyga stay 🔥🔥🔥
YG. && 21. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
STAND WITH UKRAINE 🇺🇦 https://youtu.be/C8gi_yqO9Nk
This song is ass. Have a great day

Just to sum this up video is about being broken down in parking lots with hot rods, robbing banks,gang banging and guns per basic rap video rules and to top it off taking money baths? Shouldn't have a negative impact on your culture at all.. 🤣 Imagine if "rappers" made music supporting there people/culture, glorifying success and installing respect in the youth and there community. Man wouldn't that be crazy 🤔🤔🤔
Yg absolutely bodied thisss
tyga makes the best club music when it drops!!!!
tyga in the bank lookin like lil kim (yall bitches on some following shit)
21 savage on a feature= a hit🔥🔥
Deuteronomy 22:5
Did anyone realise that they were dressed as Khloe and Kim kardashian? At the beginning of the vid the reporter called them the calabasas sisters 🤣🤣 I really don’t like the way they had bia pushing garbage at the start of her verse. Her orange fit looked hot af but the hobo scn was weird
BIA featured Cole and now she's spitting 🔥💯

This shit fu*kin wack!! Tyga and YG looking like some real industry bitches who sold out,  dressing up like women, like most do when sell they soul to the industry, they start getting folk dresisng like women and doing some weirdo sh*t, is this why slim died or shall i say sacrificed as these sell outs do, I hear a lot of it going on in the industry  Glad 21 didn't do none this dress up bs, shame he even even got on this project, he still killed it though as always. Sad to see yg do this shit tbh,  never of thought he would sell his soul to thr industry, seriously some weirdo shi*t going on, out of all you could do you dress up like some  white women, that shit ain't bool to me

Cops are not that stupid in real life! I now lost respect for YG. He's gonna ruin his rap career for post videos like this. He can get in legal trouble for this shit because the government will track his every post. I hope he goes to prison for life.
Why is it "featuring Bia" instead of "YG, Tyga, 21 Savage, and Bia"???

Songs dope. Video is wack
Wow 😃 WTF
See this is what they did to Eddie Murphy and made him dress like a female. YG you sold your soul for money, they promised you fame and richness. SLIM 400 would NEVER have done this. See black men are Strong and Dominant by nature and you let them make you do this. Lost all respect for you big bro.   Never listening to your music again. As a MAN you have live your life with morals and principles they cannot be compromised for anything.
This video is sr8 SUS son!

This is a hit song. This radio station 106 KMEL in the Bay Area, California is always playing this new song from YG, Tyga, 21 Savage, and Bia during every day now, ever since one week ago. Everyone did their thing in this song. Everyone brought their own unique styles, flows, lyrics, and cadences. This is great music for motivation and this song has a great instrumental with excellent bass. Well done, everyone. 🎧🎶🚀

Wake up zombies.....
This song is weak BIA part was the only eye opener the rest was trash.

Eddie Murphy, Tyler Perry, robin Williams, Martin ect dress in "drag" for entertainment so what's the difference. People are cry babies lol.
This a motherfuckin banger.. YG + Tyga is instant swag. True inspirations. I just released my first music video , don't like to self-promote but it's hard to get heard nowadays so I figured I'd share. To anyone that shows love and takes the time to check it, i appreciate you forever!!!  Love <3

They fooled them cops with ease! Love the whole music video, and the song smacks, everyone shows up on this track! 21 stay putting out perfect verses this year 10/10! He just keeps getting better, Savage album this year would be a gift to the game!

Yg looks like Khloe Kardashian😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tyga like always rapping off topic lol
This is fire 💪🏿💪🏿💯💥♨️⚠️⚠️
Idk how artists can be in the studio in 2022 and think “run them bands up” is a bar that’s worth structuring a song around.
와 21savage파트에서 역시는 역시다 하고 감탄했다 진심

MAMIBIAAAA:P
This song is SUPER NOT 🔥🔥🔥🔥
You folks need to stop mentioning Nipsey, he definitely wouldn't have been down for this qay isssh
Wow its evident Drakeo surpassed yall and influenced your sound in a way. You were so bitter had to get your competition knocked off and you still not really buzzin like in your prime. We know the truth.
Tyga 🐐
So they showing us they gay ritual and it's all ok cause the beat hard? Got it, keep taking L's black men. Could have did this robbery scene shit with a body suit as whitemen but they said naw let's dress up as women in the open instead of in secret like we normally do. White men doing amazing as usual, plans go so smooth cause black men will do anything for money or to be as close to white zaddy as they can.
Blind leading the blind😴Great work🔥🧢
S
The beat is dope 🔥💨
How y’all rapping about bitches but dressed like bitches?   How y’all let them motherfuckers talk y’all into that shit.  Manhood come first my G  This ain’t cool at all!  I guess that bag is more important to y’all.
Honeyy❤️❤️❤️❤️🍯🍯🍯🍯
Dope beat dope song as usual. They didn’t have to dress like women but they wanted to
Ok all the ogs is here
This shit dope everyone haten for no reason
This is call dumb police 😁😂
I only want 21 part of the song. The rest is ass in comparison😂
Why these 2 niggas still making music for... It was only a matter of time before they did some sus shit like this SMDH 🤣
Bish a** n***** smdh
Wait they dressed up like bitches and nobody seems to give a fuck. 21 was like, “naw, I’ll pass on dat”
Sad to see men dressing like women smh could have worn any mask but chose women smh
🏃🏼‍♀️💰💰
Man , it's like a movie 🎥 wow always on point ❤️💯
this is what we talkin
I'm fucking dead w they masks and wigs. 😂😂😂 Ygs shit always always hits.. bia killin it for the ladies. Everyone did an amazing job here... The visuals are remarkable. 21 is very consistent, his songs always do well.

Shii garbage fr
Will you be ready when Jesus Christ returns? If not confess your sins and ask Jesus to come to you. Praise the Most High for his son acting as a sacrificial lamb, so that your sins can be forgiven (KJV Romans 5:6-11). Confess your sins to the Most High (KJV1 John 1:9) and Repent (KJV Acts 3:19) now while you have time before it's too late, Many people in this world will not see tomorrow(KJV Proverbs 27:1).   To repent means you will not do any of the sins you've done in the past. You will be a renewed person. What is sin? Sin is a transgression of the laws of the Most High (KJV 1 John 3:4). Learning the Ten Commandments is a good start (KJV Exodus 20:1-17).

21s beat verse ever spit
I like 21 but yall trippin  he is consistent ??? hell to the no ! why he does only feature ? because he know he have only one flow who people really like he takes no risk by always using the same flow.  Cmon man this guy is an impostor i hate this type shit.  Young Thug he consistent, Yb he consistent !! His last album dates back 2 and a half years. He drop only featuring and yall said he consistent ? man im tired of this new generation.
21 killed this trackkkk 🔥
😴💤 Talkin gang talkin again. Same beat. Same verses. I take morning dumps harder than the culture. 💤😴  you got money? drop an address...
White chicks 2 😂
From a Nigga who made toote it n boot it she still some sht
Sus as hell.  The record companies really be pushing this agenda extra hard.
Nice video like a movie
A couple of dudes lose their man card for dressing up as women, good/thug my ass. Just for views
People so dramatic it's just humor fun" we all know they're not like that" Great Song "
I jus want to  say that put respect on tygas s name he been consistent ever since he still here going strong 👌🏿

Ooh dark night dark road dark music car light off oooh feeling so dark this all think this country to gether.... Oh dark heart same way go
Lol 🤨
Lol, they’re really using all of LA aesthetics. The homeless girl slowing traffic to take all her junk across the street is dead on.
I wonder what would happen to a real person like Bia's character in an actual high speed chase.
They are almost finished with the 6 street viaduct and people already filming at it. Gonna see a lot of more of that bridge in movies and videos.
Didn't Tyga and 21 used to have beef?
♫♫ <3
Daaamn😤😤😤21 😱yg💪 traw💯 In one song
Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.   (Matthew 18:14) - Repent. The LORD Jesus is coming soon.

@YG do you got a new album in the mix, if so when's the release?
Long live the ruler

Didn't need to dress up as wmn for this
I was wondering how 21 gon do on this type beat but he slid nonetheless
Yo I'd forgeten we had 21on this one... He came late😂
this what happens when men go to these 'SUSPECT' Paris/Rome fashion show events 👀🏳️‍🌈🤔🤷🏿‍♂️🤐
21 better
21
21 out there owning tracks🔥
No one is gonna talk about bros dressed in drag. I guess it's just part of the culture now.  🤔
They need to make a movie
Banger for sure
21 And YG went crazy video weak tho
This is a masterpiece.  👏👏
god daaaaamn❤
Kim and klo scene funny
we know the truth
we know the truth
Something weird about Tyga dressing up as Kylie but its just me. Not the dressing up but "the famous Calabasas sisters" was a bit on the nose.
Bia #ATE 🔥
At this point, YG and Tyga might as well do a collab project.
You all was stealing my songs bro at least put me on it 🫂
Rip drakeo
YG & Tyga collab fire as always
Bia was spitting, 21 killed it
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dope vibes certified.  Africa watching. Loud and clear in Nairobi, Kenya.
21 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Such a bad song lmao
Imma say the same shit when YG posted this shit on his IG. He ain’t Blood 🩸 He lost his street credit trying to dress up like a woman. He really sold his soul. Fk YG and Tyga song was trash
LLDTR YG LAME AND TYGA GAYY
Look nothing like slim on that portrait.everything bout this is trash
Shout out to BIA she did her thang...But what the yg & tyga looking like white chicks r we watching here🤪😂🤣😂
YG KEEPS THE WEST COAST ALIVE
Lol wack 100 tried to say that they are cross dressing but robbing banks dressing as females is genius
trash 🗑 🚮
This is a go! 🔥
live hip hop
🔥🔥🔥
No cap…. This video was lit af 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
21 & T- Raw killed it 🔥
Kim and khloe lol
Am I the only one that thought YG mask look like Khloé Kardashian?
😂😂😂😂😂 they tried to make gay be gangster bad
It's the Invasion...🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.the collab is outstanding #fireeeeeeee
Staying dangerous with a wig huh
YG’s delivery is always on point the man needs his flowers
Yg gotta be the corniest rapper out
SMH..it's just paper money
Never really liked 21, but he actually went 🔥
You can tell if something feels special. But there are so many moving parts involved in making the song a hit. The radio has to deliver, the management has to deliver in terms of booking the right promotions... just being a good song isn't enough
Yg gets better every year progress 💪🏽
YG a fuckin burger we know the truth
⚡⚡⚡⚡21 goes
Somebody need to choke out wack 100 he steady talking ish about them dressing like women....i know somwbody fifteen years ago that dressed like a white woman and hit a bank for "an undisclosed amount of cash"  so i knew exactly what it was this ish 🔥 🔥 always somebody hating from within our own..smh
400🩸🚩
This beat is out of this World
He who has an ear, let him  Jesus is coming back a lot of people have been ignoring the warnings since 2020 and the only person you’re hurting by doing that is yourself and you’re family   God is doing so much and has done so much for you to wake up and understand the times and season you’re living in so you can repent and be saved   it’s like the days of noah. God sending his servants in love because God loves you to warn you before judgment comes and yes of course human nature   Human beings ignoring God just like the days Noah mockers and scoffers laughing at the preaching of the word  scoffing at the preachers and persecuting those that come in love and share in love   scoffing at the word of God and all this scoffing and mocking even after all that you’ve seen since 2020 and have experienced  Yet everyday life continuing people oblivious to the coming judgement upon this world like the days of noah and ignoring everything that they’ve seen and are seeing   ignoring the fact that there’s a war happening in Ukraine which could potentially lead to nuclear war also ignoring the fact that Israel is about to go to war with Iran and China is about to go to war with Twain   Ignoring the fact that food prices are rising aswell as fuel prices there’s talks of worldwide famines by 2023 new diseases monkeypox after we just had a virus cause havoc on this world for two years and now we have a new one   yet people are choosing to ignore all this signs when the bible told you that this would happen in the last days  A time prophesied by Jesus - a time worser then anything that’s happened  in this world yet you can still be saved out of that time and out of the tribulation and it’s only through Jesus that you can be saved from the wrath to come and from hell and from eternal Separation from God because of you’re sins for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus   you’re in the middle of a spiritual warfare light - against -darkness and you have no idea how great or wicked that darkness is nor what that darkness is doing or planning for you   the Lord Jesus Christ is coming back to judge this world and to put everything right  God’s will is for all to be saved and for none to perish but time is running out this is not the time to be running away from God but rather to God and for my brothers and sisters in Christ   my fellow Christians don’t play church you’re either with Christ or you’re not beloved. Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.  you’re either in the light or in the darkness you’re either on Gods side or Satan’s side beloved Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.  Beloved You have to pick up you’re cross and follow Jesus and deny yourself daily and crucify your flesh daily and be holy because God is holy offer you’re body as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing unto God beloved strive i repeat strive ! to enter through the narrow gate for many will try but will not be able too   This message is shared out of love to everyone so you can be saved   So Repent and give you’re life to Jesus accept him as you’re Lord and saviour and receive forgiveness and salvation through Christ Jesus    Acts 4.12  And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved   John 14:6 6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me  God bless
I’ll see you guys in Milwaukee July 18th, 2023.

Regardless of what picture is being painted here. It wasn’t the correct time to come out as women with hair ….with all that’s happening in the world you would think you rappers would be making something that contributes to the necular family . Bio would have never put a wig on y’all niggas are wimps! All that gangsta shit just stop it you put on a wig!

Yg and Tyga dress as female robbers..🤔..sold they soul
So Cool man So Cool dog😉👍✌🔥
Was praying for you YG.. Guess you set on being hell bound...  I don't care how good this song is, the fact that you allowed then to dress you as a female.... I'm done supporting you.   Tyga, I expect this from, you can tell he goes both ways, but it's disappointing to see you do this.
BIA sounds like card B
YG and Tyga still got that west coast sound...
I liked how they dressed up as Sasquatch and Kim Kardashian
This shit is bangin' 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

21 snapped yo
I’m a HUGE supporter of YG & TYGA & 21……..BUT I NOTICE THAT reading these comments Sis didn’t get hardly any recognition in a lot of them? I respect the hell outta BIA Bc she worked her ass off to get here & she’s been fire since she appeared on season 1 of Sisterhood of Hip Hop & has only gotten colder! These rappers obviously RESPECT ONE ANOTHER to be doing a project like this & im tired of folks comparing versus amongst the artist who ALL ATE THAT BEAT UP! Folks always tryna pin these artists together & it ain’t always cool, this was A hit Bc THEY ALL BRANG THEIR UNIQUE ENERGY!    No “Negativity” in my comment towards ANYONES OPINIONS, just sayin BIA actually GOES Hard & NEVER EVER Will you catch her bouncing her ass if fb  df ñb   Fmff t GIFs in every video like every other chick out there it’s rapping right now don’t give me wrong she is mad sexy and super chill I just love the way she carries her self the way she flows t hat’s whBy I respect BIA! PUT SOME ON HER NAME! Love jewww BIA BIA!!
YG fucking goat 🐐
21 is 10/10💯💯
Damn 21 savage is a fucking goat

There’s simply no polite way to tell people they’ve dedicated their lives to an illusion.  Daniel Dennett
Yg🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🇧🇷🇧🇷
Smh evil industry 🤦 it was time for them to pay they dues
BIA did well, her voice got more matured, nice.
Like I said. They better be robbing a bank dressed like that.
Fayaaaaaaaaaa
Tyga is the boss
Mad beat 🔥🔥 21 Savage understood the assignment.....ate it and left no crumbs 💯
#karanaujla fan is here  Love from India  After gangsta I’m listening to yg
This just slaps! 🔥
🔥
Garbage man late today, they never picked up this trash.
Man, before watching this video I watched a few podcasters talking about how Tyga and YG were paying homage to the film “White Chicks”. And they acted like Tyga and YG were all femmed out and wearing stilettos and twerking and sh*t. This “Black man wearing dresses is a form of castration or emasculation” topic is so divisive and understandably so but sometimes it’s just not that deep, in my opinion.🤷🏽‍♂️
STINC TEAM COULD NEVER #RIPSLIM400
Beautiful art
YG and Tyga weird af for that
Tyga went hard in the paint 🔥 🔥 🔥
Something about bia's verse just sits so well
21 and Tyga in a same song 🧐

21 savage is the King 👑👑
Holy shit, we are not worthy 🥵
GTA IN REAL LIFE LMAOOOOOOO
21 is the kind of success story that encourages me as a underground artist with a small following. Seeing how he’s developed his skills and slowly blown up after seizing each and every opportunity he’s been giving has been inspirational! Mans has quickly become a mainstay in the industry and for good reason. Dude is too nice! I know if I put in the work, I can reach a larger audience some day too, but for now, I’m happy being a supporter. My turn will come too. Salute to 21 he never misses on a feature🔥
Identifying as a different gender to get away with criminal activity? Wow, much creative, much fictional(!)
the 'Scarface' reference by 21😭🔥🔥🔥🔥
50 Cent luck he wasn't shot by YG. 🙌🏾😭
