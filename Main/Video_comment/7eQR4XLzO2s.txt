Why any boxing purist even payed 4 the live event tells me all i need 2 know.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I missed it !...I only came across this vid now after it's all over. 🙁
Oh, there’s a rematch?
You did not lose you won

Fight starts in 35 minutes. Thanks TDUK! 😊
Are you gonna show the fight ?
Just another one full of crap giving fake information just to boost his comments and make money 🤦🏼‍♂️
Who wants to pay for this pathetic circus. 2 idiots beating each other. I rather watch 2 chicks fighting
cap
These channels aren’t showing the right buddy, they are showing themselves commenting on the fight live 🙄
Rapid streamz got it on
More WWE than boxing, boxing for the snowflakes

OK you just talked shit for minutes there, didn't answer how to watch it.. Click bate bollox
I'm using live net.
I hope Jack Paul get TKO lol. Weak PPV results.
Thanks for sharing.  Much appreciated.  Keep the content coming.  Hope you have an incredible night.  Much love and RESPECT
Thanks you are awesome!
Thanks TDUK
It's not 7pm GMT when the ring walks start, that will be around 9:30pm GMT. Just a heads up, but thanks for the info and links. It's gunna be a make or break situation . On one hand if Jake wins he will get even more respect from all sides. If he looses he will be laughed at, but he can go back to fighting. If Tommy wins or looses he is going to get alot of money. If he doesn't win, he has the most to loose in it all.
they are not showing the fights
Guessing this won't say using Pluto with a m3u file lol.
Its pay per view just cause they are couple of youtubers doesn't mean its a free stream, links to chad watch alongs, timewaster ! iptv is your best chance.

I don't think you can watch it on YouTube I look like it's just a bunch of people who just do a podcast during the fight.  That's what I think.
