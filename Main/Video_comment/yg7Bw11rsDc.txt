Just not funny.
7:53 Eddie / Andrex @ , I see an Andrex add !  "Possibly! The world's strongest toilet paper ? " Page me !
Eddie has to be one of the only people who almost shits himself on camera and actually shows it like a proud dad
10:02 I wonder if his wife kicked him in the nuts when he went home? 😂😂🤣🤣
[7:45] _"Worst.. ring sting.. OF MY LIFE!"_
You should consider a colab video with Fish with Carl channel. Hes from UK too
With the limitations of the pole taken into account. This is impressive!!
And then he died
Only Eddie can make a near 15lbs fish look almost minuscule
😂💪😀😂😅😮😂
Imagine if he mastered the pendulum cast. Danny moeskop will have a new contender
Nice video 👍👍👍🥰🥰🥰 Best world record cast 248m Samyy energiee
You know what i would like to know... What muscle groups you need to train to improve your casting distance
7
Would be amazing to see Eddie fish here in Hawaii onshore
Was the net really necessary lol
Eddie get a rematch with that prick borris,and destroy him.
Not me only being able to cast my lil rod about 100 meters
More fishing content! Go to the states for some giants
Go out crabbing you would be great at pulling traps!
Lächerlich 🤣🤣🤣🤣
it's not so much about strength. anyone with a good pole and a little knowledge could achieve the same distance.
You should see these guys in Hawaii throw!
"fuck that currys sitting a bit iffy" 😂
Let us know if you ever wanted your own set of rods!  You were using some products we make so we can defiantly set you up!
Hello, can you please show me a link for the cooler bag? Greetings Stefan
They must use og reel snot. Line conditioner/friction modifier, rod eye/guide friction modifier, and quick lube for  reel internals. Slickens up everything
Don't know about competitive fishing but I definitely see a future for you in competitive toilet dashing 😂😂
That's 1 heavy waight on there I'm used to doing that with a 9ft pole and a 2 oz sinker. Well done sir!.
I never eat when I fish for that exact reason😭
I like that you kept changing the yards to meters when putting it on the screen😂
🎣🎣🎣🎣🎣🎣🎣🐟🐟🐟
éclater au sol
hey eddie next time dont be lazzy to reel it back after cast :D
My man heard protein powder and decided to eat fish bait, that's something else
Good casts for a beginner. Like me, in a photo you make a big fish look small!
beautiful fish
He took that boilie like a champ🤣🤣🤣
watching this was exactly like fishing with my mate who is a power lifter,  especially all the food, farting and ridiculous casting distances 😅
put your finger in the mouth of carp next time, you will calm the carp from stress. Nice Video i stay here for a while :P
I hope you do a lot more fishing Eddie, it suits you
snack????!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
I carp fish myself brilliant video with Spooner and Dovey mate 👌👍 I have to see you with a 50 pounder in your hands 👀😂
Thanks Eddie, ive always been afraid to fully send it with my carp rods, now i know that they dont break instantly
I was genuinely hoping that when he came out of the outhouse that all star would start playing
the fart got me dead 💀
I'm dying when he was just munching on the curry looking happy saying "right after this curry we will get back too it" then it just goes to him not being able to move cause of the curry 😭
Eddie seems like a great guy
3:29 "thats 140 Yards..." Eddie 5 secs later:  "144m"      💪👁👄👁💪
Eddie Hall the powerfish get the glory holes and get the dog only Australians would understand
😂😂😂 the trot to the toilet was hilarious
Another day, another world record by Eddie Hall. What's not to like 😂👍
Omg oops 😬 🤣🤣🤣
Would like to see how far you could cast with sea fishing gear and a 5 oz lead.
curry and rice hits different
Who brave enough to tell Eddie not to take a dump in the bushes  Lmao 🤣 😂
Should’ve just launched the rod as well
"slight competitve person" proceed to lift 500kg too prove his the best 😆
i came here from the korda video
You need to meet up with Blacktip and go Goliath Grouper fishing. I want to see how easy you make it look!
7:45 NOW THIS IS CONTENT !!! YESSSSS
Without fail, a massive shit is needed as soon as the rods are in the water 😂😂
Reeling in is the most entertaining thing to watch and it got cut :c
That small
Where can I get the lunch box 😊
Haha mini karp
Mans dropped his pants before he even opened the door 🤣🤣 I’m fucking dead
Wheres Ali?
Big up the boys from Korda, fair play
Hahaha with spooner its always gun.
Eddies lunchbox is the size the my rucksack🤣
That’s funny Eddie gotta go gotta go.
Hes almost as strong as brad castleberry wow!
💪💪💪
Great... 💪💪💪Look my italian carpfishing channel 😉😉🎣🎣🎣
How about "eddie hall does the cheese rolling contest" ?  Midget throwing? Dodgeball?
You should do a fishing tour Eddie, I'd love to watch the series! If you go up north in Australia you can take on some Giant Trevally with the gear you're distance casting with, they will put up a hell of a fight and test your grip strength 💪
I feel like he just heard wait there is a world record for fishing yeah I'll go hahah
I’m from Texas. They don’t make line long enough or mountains high enough that I can’t cast over, but there ain’t no need to cast that far. Just imagine me next to you roping a fish… not a net, a freakin lasso my dude. That would put a yee in your haw wouldn’t it?🤣   Mr. Hall you are a legend, I love watching you interact with others and trying new things! Especially your lifting. You never fail to impress. Thank you!
I would like to try to so this
Poor Rod
Loving the exit music, can’t remember who it is, but it’s firmly in my playlist 👌 Also, watched both of these vids now, great content, genuine laughs from my belly! All good stuff!!
Man we need to see Eddie going out into the seas to catch even bigger fishes. Maybe invite Devon Larratt too
Record îs 67kg crap în spain
If you wanna catch world record carp you should come to hungary :)
Never thought I'd see your dad fishing he hated it when I worked with him.
Klick bait
Fishing video let’s goo
Really scraping for content huh?
You should go try to catch goliath grouper they’re one of the strongest fighting fish on rod and reel
Love the fishing video! Please fish more! Haha
Makes a 15lb carp look like a fish finger. True beast casting 140 yards with no technique
Please try giant grouper fishing 😁👍🏼
Great video, going fishing with the best in the business there!!
Bro thats what im talking about. Deep casting it all the way to the other shore. Holy carp. Beasting it
Who's the guy in the camo hat and grey t-shirt?? Richard Hammond?
Lmao Eddie thats why I try to eat before fishing otherwise instead of getting a world or state record I'd be to busy taking a world record poo 🤣 like you experienced in the video but great record also for u bud
Geest affort  mate 👌👌🙏🏻🙏🏻
If ur form gets better you will destroy the record
ماجمل قصبات الصيد التي عندك اتمنه لو كان هنا بل العراق مثله
carp fishing must have been so ZZZ especially those size XD
Soft haha
So where is the tattoo after the boxing match? I thought Eddie was a man of his words
Common sense to not bring spicy food
The thing is when you become a carp fisherman you start measuring everything in rod lengths... 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Hutch all day is winning this... can't believe you like carp fishing  bro  👍🤙🙏✌👊🤘
Nice two mirrors n common absolutely miss carp fishing
You should try it with a alvey
How’s it going Eddie? I’m a lifetime fisherman and have almost gotten a state record for a brook trout. I’ve never considered a casting record or any other record. On a different subject right now there’s a-lot of discussion about if anyone in the world can beat Levan Saginashvili, now the number one professional arm wrestler in the world!!you obviously know who Devon Larratt is, he just went up against him and many thought he may have a chance but lost. Now it’s widely believed there’s no one who can beat him!! Not only me but others have said maybe someone like you or Brian Shaw might be able to do it if given the time and proper training. You both have the size and weight just lack the particular skills that an arm wrestler needs. The world would pay to see someone like you or Brian take on this challenge to dethrone this current giant of a man, the Georgian Hulk, Levan Saginashvili!! One of you if you were to accept the challenge could be the world’s best arm wrestler!! If you truly want a challenge and believe you can do this. Please! Please! Prove it and take on this monumental challenge and shock the arm wrestling world!! If you decide to do this please mention I told you about this. I’ve already mentioned it to many YouTubers in the arm wrestling world, Larry wheels and others who also think there’s no one who can do it. This would be huge in many ways for either of you. Please consider!!
Danny Moeskops holds the longest cast... he was a unit aswell ! Would like to the beast have ago at that ..
Thats why i generally dont like carp fishing, wayyyy too much of not doing anything!
Bloke must shit for England eating all that stuff
Eddy you trying to be terry Edmonds?
Lol you seen the sea fishing guys cast, 3 times that.
You holding that 15lb carp looks like a normal sized man holding an ipad
You want a fight go to Florida and fish for Goliath grouper
I reckon if Eddie accidently hooked one of them other dudes while casting they would get launched out as live bait no problem 😆
Eddie makes all the fishing gear look like kids rods and Spods 😂😂😂 even the bed chair looks tiny with Eddie on it
That carp looked tiny with Eddie holding it 😂
Be careful Eddie don’t snag your bits
Ehre, Eddie Hall fischt an der anderen Seite vom See XD
Not to sound like a dick. But a tall dude who has any experience casting a rod would out cast u anyway. Leverage from long arms seems like it would be more affective. Ok after watching this I take that statement back. Dude is a animal
From the us I love carp fishing 🎣 gold eddies took it on
@Eddie Hall The Beast .......😂😂😂😂😂💩💩💩💩😂😂😂😂that close call had me dying my man ....i literally could not stop laughing ....thanks for that it was very much needed...great vid
You want to try lure fishing on freshwater, totally different ball game.
Class.. just brought that 15lb mirror in like I'd bring in a roach  😂 one handed weigh in the scales lol
Hi Ed just wondering if your planning another fight or is boxing on hold for now
Top bunch of lads, well done Eddie, TIGHTLINES MATE!!!!!!!!!
You didn't even mention "Korda" Danny will be pissed I can see a fight coming on 😂😂
How's it Eddie. I must say did some proper casts for a first timer. Hope to see more fishing videos in the future. I'm a big fiasherman and I fish many disciplines. Saltwater ,freshwater , boat , basically anywhere there's water I try to fish.
Whilst fishing I always carry a loo roll and usually have a shit in the woods can't control my bowel movements if I need to go I am going end of haha
wicked video Eddie hope to see you on the bank in the future mate
This was really good
Loving it
I love how in the UK they give so much care for carp... while in the US we shoot them with bows and club them on the head to get rid of them.
as a longtime carp fisherman from canada and also a longtime follower of yours, this video really pleased me
This is so good. First Rick Shiels and now this, I’m so glad you’re getting involved in different stuff
Creased at how small a mid double looks in Eddie's mitts 😂
not clickbeat
That 15lber looks tiny in Eddie's hands
Why was he sat on the bed chair with a spod rod in hand?
Thats a small carp 🤣 utah has carp like you
guys of the Korda Team?😁😀😏
Looked like a Mirror Carp.
Never seen a 15lb carp look so small compared to the person holding it 😂
Eddie Hall is starting to look more comparable to regular men again in size again.
Bro am 16 i cast 175 m
Love the fun videos but are you still lifting and boxing?
its a 144 yards into wind..... not metres, also after the cast there was so much excess line from the reel before the bail arm was flipped over and line clipped, but good effort
you should do stuff with the sidemen
I love how a 15 pound carp is a very respectable fish but Eddie makes it look like its a 2 pounder lol
Eddy. Come to America, Washington State,  well put you onto catching a 40lb+ King Salmon out of our Famous Cowlitz River located in East Lewis County Washington State! (Or bigger,  up to 53 pounds)
world record amount of commercials for sure...
its crazy a bodybuilder has alot more muscle than eddie hall but he is still stronger
A record of the worlds,,, love it, I am actually carp fishing now, hopefully see you on the bank sometime you beast 👍👍👍
Great vid !!
Shoulda tried a taste of the Cell, you’d have swallowed that no problem, at 12£ a kilo though, you’ll probably stick with your sponsors protein 🤣💪
120 yards as a first ever cast??? BOOM!!
Now that’s THE sport mucca!!! 🎣💪🎣💪🎣💪🤣
Awsome video . Love when do stuff eddie like this venture in to other people worlds
Nice video, imagine if Eddie actually knew how to cast :)
Good video Eddie
Who here wants a BlacktipH collab see if Eddie can do the Goliath Grouper gunnel challenge.
The world record for the longest surfcasting is held by Danny Moeskops who cast a bewildering 313-325 yards.
WTF is this shit???
Fishing AND strongman? Sensory overload AUUUUGHHH
As long as you don’t try boxing again 😂😂
Happy 6th anniversary for the 500kg deadlift
Plenty of fishing down here in florida, be happy to recommend some of our best charters on the coast or take you out fishing as well!
Don't need strength for a long reel.. You need good technique..
Eddie Hauling
Please bring back the series where you try different sports it’s really fun to watch
i love c&r
Should of taken them to bridgets for the day
Eddie you have to go and do shark fishing. Man Vs great white with a rod and reel. That would be so cool to see
cares more about the fame than the welfare of the fish
You Had been sleeping in the Couch haven't you
Hi Eddie, what charity Hafthor has choosen?
It would of been hilarious if they'd of thrown water over eddie for achieving a pb
The way Eddie just lift the everything with one hand with such ease 🤣 that was crazy impressive, but he is the beast so I’m not that surprised 😂🦾
My 2 favourite things eddie/ gym stuff and fishing
😂🤣Does a Beast, 💩 in the woods? Very nearly 😂🤣
Omg his casting technique is awful, can tell he's not a carp angler.
What episode is it
Watt wors tat tat is a recort of the world is wat tat is😄
8:18 that the norm in Trinidad g , u just didn't walk with 🥃.🤣🤣
You got the technique, just don't think you've got the power 😄😄😄😄
Why have you're videos gone to shit since you lost the fight?
Fuckin A bud! I was a competitive powerlifter (I actually hold the Canadian RAW bench press record) and was disappointed that I wasnt fishing as much as I used to. In 2019 I suffered a horrible pec tear that ended my career... months later I started up my YouTube finishing channel. Cheers from 🇨🇦!!!
There's me thinking I was the heavy weight lifter of carping 🤣 match Eddie? 🤣
144m is exactly the furthest ive ever cast, using a 3lb 12ft rod and 3oz lead. Completely wind still that is.
Your farther seems like a really cool chill guy.
try going grouper fishing with blacktip fishing :P
I like how dovey got left hanging at the end lol
Awesome 😎
UK let you keep fishing poles that big?
As a fisherman in the US I just don't get carp fishing. I love all types of fishing but carp fishing is just really weird to me. I know it's massive in the UK I just don't know if I could do it. It's like surf fishing but on a lake I suppose.
7:49 SomeBODY once told me of his world record!
Would love to see the strongman get together in the US for some bass fishing
Spooner and dovey are good anglers.
I'm a carp angler it's not about size for casting distance im 265lb and  for casting it's technical .
Cool video Eddie you’ll always be an inspiration for me when I’m working out 💪
As a avid carp fishermen this is a awsome vid. Eddie if you want to catch some real monster carp that at 30+ pounds hit me up bud
Im almost certain i saw you at the Cat and Fiddle inn the other week on the motorbike. Sick bike!
Was that fish named Collin ? Or is it Giants Live ?
Turn around backwards and cast it over your head.  You'll get alot farther.
Can we just appreciate the fact that Eddie casually tossed one the balls up, and caught on the first try?
Ah nice awesome content as usual. Would love to see you fish in Hawaii. If you ever come down let me know I’ll take you out fishing.
Eddie hall teaming up with guiness records just smashing  world records
@eddiehall where's Hannah, Patrick and the tripod?
Hey Eddie , you need to come back to America to catch big game fish with Oberst and Brian. That would be an Epic battle. Just to see who can handle these Giant fish till the end . Just think the worlds strongest men reeling  in a 1000 Pond or 453 KG fish in record time.
Hafthor trows it a lot further. He's better than you.
awesome! next, hand line catch a tuna!
Ed running down the trail to the toilet has got me in stitches 😂
My guy you gotta go to south Florida and tie up with a Goliath grouper makes these things look like goldfish. You literally use baits as big as these carp for Goliath
The best video you done .
The dove from above 👆
08:00 think that was the fish bait man.
Can you please make a full day of eating on non training days. And explain any details if you lower your carb intake etc.
Eddie, you have done your thing, gone as far as you can go with regard to social media. Time to quietly go do something else.
Awesome ! Its Yards not meters 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Sound ill Eddie, hope you get better soon!

Lol that’s not Indian music playing that’s the curry going through in the restroom   AaaaaaaAaaaaaah xD  just a joke form a comedian named John pinet xD
Lesson of the day, don't eat fish bait.........
Made that 15 look like a 5 pounder you absolute unit
Couple of real fan boy brown noses!
Great video Eddie funny and entertaining.I was really impressed with your casting as well considering your limited experience at fishing. I love the Korda boys they are top blokes. I still reckon you could have a run in WWE. After all there is now a gap in the roster for a strong man after Mark Henry and more recently Braun Strowman.
Splinters 😉💛😉
You should have kicked the door open like Shrek lol
7:49 Somebody once told me...
good on ya beast , nothing like a good lot of poopage to go with your footage for the camera ,,thats what i like about u beasty is your pure honesty most people would have gone no cut , cut , cut aaaand , welll , boring !!but not the beast , he goes make sure this goes on please , now u can cut coz i'm going home to bed ....
Would love to see you and Alex doing paddle boarding. Great for the whole family. Please try it.
Eddie you are the man i was laughing so hard.
💯👍🏻
Do not not still have all the guys that used to help ya at the home gym and where the hell is Hanna
What's up with Eddie's voice?
@THE BEAST: Great to see you having fun and relaxing out in nature Eddie...and it WAS the bait you sampled...not the curry that gave your system a nasty surprise no doubt. Great vid. 😀💪💪👍
Someone definitely pre caught that, played it then handed him the rod. 🤣🤣
Where's Hannah, Patty, and Tripod?
They don’t fight very much dissapointing for anybody strong 😂
Next video- strongman watched paint dry ffs.
Looks like a tench next to Eddie
cool
It’s called fishing not casting……:
He’s fishing in this pond and in another one located 30 miles away.
I just had myself a, barely made it moment. I sweated way more than Eddie. I guess that makes me the winner! Lol
Cringe name. You're eddie hall don't need to tell everyone you're "the beast" your accomplishments should speak your title for you.
What I'll always love about Eddie is how down to earth he is. Like all the time.
Did anyone else expect allstar to start playing when he came out of the outhouse?
You have to fish for dome goliath grouper you should do a video with blacktip
Im so glad these type of videos are back, they were always entertaining.
The balls on him to say "you may be WSM but just not strong enough" after casting further than him 🤣🤣
Used to love going fishing here into U.K. with my friends when I was younger. Haven't been in years though.
Great cast..no bait left on the hook after pulling all those "G 's" . But who needs bait ...crap I jumped on the " worlds record longest cast" hook as soon as it hit my internet pond
Another World Record to my collection.
lucky he didn't let go of the rod xD
Came here for a fishing video ending up buying a spiffy lunch box....still cheaper than actual fishing ;-)
@BlacktipH get him on the boat battling the Goliath Groupers 🦈🐋💪
Reckon you vs other strongmen on a boat battling big Goliaths would be a good video to see
Fishing looks really boring. I don’t see the point unless that’s your dinner or you really don’t like your wife.
I saw Brian fishing. Maybe he can take you fishing in Colorado.
Next video: strongman tries to lift the  world record deadlift 501kg
hope u r doing well Eddie you are still the greatest
Nothing like refreshing hot half day old curry in the hot summer sun aye
Go and lift that 500kg turtle i think it was in Dubi cant remember
This guy really changed his YouTube Channel name to the cringe name he gave himself. 🤣🤣
splendid lol.
the world record casting distance is 939 feet or 313 yards.
The most boring thing to do but you made it entertaining
Carp can fight hard and whatnot but u should come to the states and fish some big flathead
All those trees to lean against and you chose to run 200 yards???   Be a man just use some leaves
Come on state site we can break that record boss.  We can teach ya how to get the whip going.....   you were just lobbing it out there you need to get the whip so that tip does more work
Great little video Eddie nice to see different from the norm!! Nice to see you out with your dad!! But are you looking not to be fed again calling the fish your wife 🤔👏🏻😂
144 meters or yards?
ey you changed your name :) love fishing man good stuff
The secret quote to summon a wsm. there is a world record!
Not personally an angler but I love seeing you relax and enjoy England losing the American colonies!
7:49 really missed the opportunity to play All Star by Smashmouth.
When Eddie came out of the toilet they should've done a shrek scene when he boots the door open lol
Nice to see you try fishing. I wouldnt mind if you made more content about it in the future 🤩
Eddie you really was in good hands with Dovey n spooner they are best in the carp world glad you enjoyed it fishing is a great way to relax and unwind its been keeping me sane for years now lol
You brian should go for groupers in florida there the strongman of the sea
Would love to see the results after you spending a few days with Terry Edmonds
That guy you’re trying to hit on the head! Is me 😂 😂
I'm not gunna tel him to kneal down Danny will 😂
Eddie "Covid Voice"  Hall 😂
Cracking video. Loved the casting. First time 140 metres. A true beast lol. The boys are quality as well. Love watching monster carp.
No thing he'll be going for the world record for how many Fish and rice cakes he can eat
Carp: Blub, blub, blub **[aggressive fish cursing and insults]**  Eddie: At last, a worthy opponent! Out battle shall be LEGENDARY!
This is my sport long distance casting but competitive casting usually do it over grass for accurate measurement. Yep some carp guys have done 262 odd metres but 230m a very very good cast for competitive casters with carp gear  With beach rods close to 300yards/274m or more is achieveable with 100, 125 150 and 175g leads but anything over 240m(on beach rods) is pretty good amongst top distance casters. Even with beach rods a 200yd(183m) cast still a very good benchmark and achievable by most with a plain lead and bit of practice.  If you ever over northern ireland hit me up would be awesome to a collab!! I show you some long distance techniques with beach rods and you show me how to improve my overhead pressing! Would be great to meet The Beast!  Lol. PS  your technique is not bad, snappier pull in with left arm at the end would be good and keep left higher and straighter before you hit it!
Somthing about this is fishy is river (beast and people (beast
He says, I want to fish the other side of the lake, but I don't go all the way over there. YEET!!! Just run into the lake and chum the water.
As the WSM, to fish with Spooner and Dove is a responsibility!!! These guys are the Strongman of Fishing!!
A 12lb common that looked like gudgeon in eddies hands 🤣🤣🤣 fins up 🎣
Pliz trainingvids
Curry and rice,👂sounds good😳
Incredible...

Arm Wrestling?
7:50, man, you had damn forest all around
Very very beautiful video and brushes. You always have new, advanced and wonderful content and amazing ideas. I always learn a lot from you. I love you, my legend❤🤞🏻🙏🏻
Little goliath grouper fishing? 😱 Had been awesome!
Caught a 46 inch carp on the snake river don't know if that's a monster actually kinda small compared to what I was catching
This is the Eddie Hall we like stay happy and humble brother 🙏 🙌
A very nice video from Eddie in a very calm and beautiful fishing method. A new video and a wonderful and new idea from Eddie. Thank you for this very beautiful video. I always look forward to watching your videos. It is always the first to me. It is wonderful and very beautiful. It deserves support. I love you from the bottom of my heart, always the first in everything❤🥇🐟
I know fellas who have been fishing 20-30 years and could only dream about casting that far eddie 😂 unbelievable really
Best fishing hook ever Eddie has an amazing iron hand Big Love Eddie💪🏻❤🐟
A record of the World???????
Clearly never watched the goofy movie to learn the perfect cast
Comic curry comedy.
Thinking carp fishing is the only thing were i can compete with eddie and a chance to win 😂.carp fishing for near 21 years now great hobby and even more than that 💚.best luck and thigt lines 👊
Beast 🔥
you need to go catfishing they fight very strong! and up to 100lbs!
9:51 you make a 15lb mirror look like an f1 i bet the carp was impressed
Should try a heavier rod
Fishermen are so competitive. Doesn’t matter who you are, you ain’t getting this record on your first try. Period
I’m so bad at fishing
is that a world record? thats a world record. gather around boys gather around. listen to the story of the world record
8.19 didn't think you could fish braid mainline at Norton 😂
New channel name
World record. Brian doesn't have a world record
W00t W00t these types of videos are one of my favourites, I'm not talking about fishing but overall like the Golfing videos you've done before.
When my algorithms collide
Eddie has to make everything a competition loll
i love carp fishing i do every few weeks  hope you and family do well take care bro

Hi
The BEAST is a fisherman
its not keg throwing why you so violent with that rod 😆
Cast across the whole thing!🤯🤣
eddie, you've said you've had the dream of achieving the title of world's strongest man since about age 5, i was wondering what were your inspirations throughout your journey?
U da man Eddie 🌞  Best thoughts   Copenhagen support
