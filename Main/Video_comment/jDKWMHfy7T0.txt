I would take the Apple as well, since it actually is healthier than the banana. First of all, it’s more hydrating than the banana. At the least for me, I always feel like I’m thirsty after eating a banana. Second of all, a banana has a lot more carbs than an apple. Carbs are very good for you, but if you just ate a piece of toast you don’t necessarily need the excess carbs.

Apple is indeed healthy. It has great vitamins and a decent amount of sugar. On the other hand is a banana. Very high dosage of sugar, no efficient nutrients except vitamin B and problems with the toilette (diarrhoea) if you eat more than one at once.  This is why I say: I take the apple, because it’s healthy.

I shall take the apple because of its distinguished being. The skin of the tasty treat is absolutely scrumptious and has a delicious crunch to it. The innards of the fruit are crunchy, yet soft and has a taste and touch to you tongue that is consistent in most occasions, a nice snack for neurodiverse individuals. It tastes nice to the mouth and has more fiber than the banana. That is why I have selected the apple.

I’ll take the banana as I have a crown which prevents me from biting into an apple. I could cut the apple but that would take too much time for a simple snack, if it was being used in another meal than apple is preferred but when taken alone the banana works much better. Not to mention the fact that I find bananas more enjoyable both by itself and as an additive to my smoothie.

This actually works. I recently applied to Loyola and my grades weren’t so good. So I told them why they weren’t good and what was stopping me from getting good grades I also showed them my improvement. And when I went there for the tour before it we had an interview which they said my essay was why they accepted me because I showed i how I got better.   So if you’re going to college remember this could be one of the best topics

𝙄𝙏'𝙎 𝙈𝙔 𝙏𝙄𝙈𝙀 𝙏𝙊 𝙎𝙃𝙄𝙉𝙀..   I believe why I should have the Apple is because, Apples have a lower sugar level than bananas, Red apples are high dietary fiber and which contains vitamin c.  Green apples have 95 Calories that aren't to low or high, Green apples are most likely healthier than red apples Beacause Green apples are a better source of vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin E and vitamin K.    I will edit this on another day or something bc my hands hurt- 💀

Homie am I meant to respond with, “I’ll take the banana to monopolize the opportunity to eat one in the present day as bananas are currently endangered from an infectious disease. Over thousands of years of cultivation we have whittled down the amount of species bananas to make them more desirable for consumption and healthier against disease. However because of this, we have been left with genetically similar bananas, none of which have the correct genetic structure to combat the infection currently spreading through the plantations they’re growing in.”

I would take the apple because of its flavor. I tend to choose foods that are sweet and juicy.        Not only that but I'm not exactly fond of bananas. I have had some moments where bananas have had seeds that I choked on. Although apples do have seeds, you know that you should expect to find at least one seed in them. Its unusual for a banana to have seeds.         This is not the only feature of bananas that i dislike. I am very picky about bananas. They must not be too ripe but they can't be too unripe. Apples are the opposite. I could feast on any type of apple with ease.        Then you have bruises. An apples bruise to me, don't really affect taste, but a bananas bruises affect not only the skin and the looks, but the taste. It gives out an unpleasant taste and even though some people prefer it like that, I cannot bring myself to consume it.         Lastly, an apple is just easier to eat. You can't eat the skin of a banana but you can eat the skin of an apple. There are many ways that you can eat the main form of an apple. You can peel its skin off, cut it into slices, or enjoy it with salt.          In my opinion apples are way better than bananas, from their looks to their flavor.
Easy: I throw up if I eat the banana while the apple is my favorite fruit

I’ll take the banana because I want the banana.
I'll take the apple because I don't have the chew it in my mouth for 3 seconds after biting a piece off before swallowing just to taste it's flavor
Here's my reasoning, apples are crunchier and have a unique sweet taste. Most people eat apples because they are that quick, less effort, sweet but not sugary snack.  Bananas are so sweet but they take more effort to make. Although sweet and very nice to eat, they can also be difficult to eat overtime because of the slimy texture. But they are more versatile and can easily be put into more smoothie recipes and actual dinner recipes with ease.

Honestly apples are just so much better i mean they are red and red is my favorite color i would take the apple over the banana any day of the week also they are just so so so so so so so good, i mean like apples are just way more iconic then some goofy banana I mean take apple the phone brand as an example they could have used a CHERRY a BANANA a ORANGE but no the apple is just way way way more iconic then any of those just an orange is pretty damn iconic.  I mean when your walking in the woods behide your house or in your local park you are gonna find them in trees or on the ground unlike banana's you got to go all the way to the rain forest sure if you living in the rain forest right now that might not be a issue for you but lol you're internet connection sucks.  ok I'm coming to the end of this short little essay and uh it's been nice also if you like banana's you are a baby  cuz they are really really chewy unlike apples they are super duper crunchy but the fact of the matter is that this isn't a opinion it's a fact and if you dare disagree with me there will be problems.  anyways have a great rest of your life.

I will take the banana because it is softer on my teeth and therefore gives me a much more satisfying feeling than that of biting into an apple. Admittedly biting into an apple makes a nice crunching noise, but the skin of the apple occasionally finds its way between my teeth.

My first answer: I like the flavour
I shall take the apple Why? I want the apple because i like the crunch and the flavor of it. To me it takes much sweeter than a banana, which is why i like it more. I also haven’t eaten a solid apple in about five years so the different sweetness and flavor brighten my mood and make me feel better about eating it. I am also very much allergic to bananas, i could maybe eat half of one with much worry but if i eat more than half i might become sick from it.

Banana is 💩
I would choose the apple because the apple has a nice crunch on the skin, the flavor of the apple tops above all. I personally don’t like chewy things as much as I do soft things. The apple has the perfect flavor and texture to me and it always creates such a satisfying crunch. The red skin looks more appetizing to me than the banana’s.(e) though I do personally love both, o would go for the apple. The apple also gives apple juice when biting into it so it does make the flavor better. Overall, I would choose the apple.

I'll take the apple because it actually helps keep one up like coffee dose however it's healthy.

Therefore I will take the apple over the banana.

I actually don't like apples because of how it feels in my mouth. It has a weird texture I do not enjoy. The taste is also not my favorite since it's not only sweet but a little sour.  I like the banana because it's really sweet and soft. And it has a refreshing feeling.  I know this all sounds weird but sometimes you can't describe something that has a single easy word.

Oh, so the reason I gave was a part of the reason I got accepted. So I decided to shoot for the best engineering school in my country, because it had a course on game development.  Basically a part of my essay went: "I want to go here because the combination of the fact that this university has a course that teaches game development, it's also the best engineering school in the country. If I cannot get the course in this school, I will find another." Yada yada yada.  And I got in! It is in fact my dream school, and I'm pretty proud of myself for getting into my dream school AND dream course.

Me: Apple, to keep the doctors away.
Honestly, I prefer apples over bananas. Sure they have their own different tastes and flavours when it comes to genetics, but I prefer apples over bananas because it doesn't get boring and disgusting when you keep eating an apple. It's juicy and more fragrant than a banana and it doesn't kill you if you have too much of it, as long as you don't eat the seeds. And so that is why I prefer apples over bananas.

THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION: Will you go to Heaven when you die? Have you lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain, lusted (Which Jesus said was adultery in Mt. 5-28)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there’s good news, Though we broke God’s law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross. “God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes (trusts) in Him should not perish but have everlasting life” (Jn. 3-16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses.  if you’ve made it this far, please, repent (turn from sin) and trust in Jesus and what he did for you on the cross.

My answer was banana cuz the banana is tastier. That’s a good answer. You can’t tell me what I find tasty is wrong. This is a bad metaphor. Bye.

Yeah If my mentor asked me which one do I like, I'm pretty sure she's expecting something like   "I prefer apple because even tho Bananas wins more in the nitritious content comparison rather than apple, but the difference aren't that big. And unlike apple, banana's sugar amount increases overtime as the rippening of the banana progresses, while apples are rich of vitamin K which is involved in the process of coagulation and bone development."
I were to be asked this I would say cause of texture like bananas are mushy and if you bet the right apple they can be crunchy

I picked the banana, because I’m allergic to apples
I’ll take the Apple, my reason is I have hated bananas since I was about three. I actually used to love them so much, when I was a baby. However, I grew up, and matured. I noticed all of the flaws in the seemingly perfect fruit. It’s mushy texture is disgusting, it tastes bad, and it smells bad. Soon after my epiphany, I cut all contact, and most of my exposure with bananas. However, apples are quite different. They taste and smell pleasant, and I have fond memories with the fruit. I remember, the first pie I ever made for thanksgiving by myself was an apple pie. It was so delicious, and I was so proud of myself. My dad is very passionate about pies and making them. He took a bite of my apple pie, and told me it was perfect. Now when I bite into an apple, it brings back that memories of my father’s approval, and making something I was very proud of. So, yes I will choose the apple, due to the sheer juxtaposition of my memories with apples, versus my memories with bananas.
In general I’d rather take the apple bc 1. I just don’t really like the taste of bananas 2. Apple’s are usually crunchy, though some are soft/mushy, and I just don’t like soft/mushy apples  (though for some reason I keep thinking “banana”)

Keep strong. Dont forget that despite the struggles in this world, God is full of justice, mercy and love.   Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world's previous perfection to be destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don't think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God's perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says "the soul that sins shall die" - if we break one in thought/word/deed it's as if we're guilty of all of them. Quite simply, living by the law (which is doing everything perfectly) is impossible for sinful humans   . The law shows us that 1. We will die in Hell if we fail to follow it and 2. We cannot save ourselves BUT, 3. God's perfect, immovable law points us to Christ, who followed and fulfilled the law in thought, word and deed perfectly in our place. He did what we couldn't and did it on our behalf. He was then sentenced to death on a cross, and took our personal punishment for our sin, paying our penalty (like paying our fine) completely FOR us, and has given us freedom.   If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life. He will help us through the struggle, the stress, and anything we experience in the world. It's about letting Christ in to guide and teach you and obeying Him through His power (not ourselves, we need Him to help us as it's impossible without depending on His power and instruction).   He is our substitute in His life, death and resurrection. He essentially rewrote history in our place so that, if you believe in Him, it will be as if you had never sinned if you accept Christ's death as our own in our place.   He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it.   He doesn't want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. Hes giving EVERYONE a chance, He wants everyone to take the free gift of salvation from Hell. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through His power and abiding (staying) with Him. So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to follow His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and let Him lead in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the ultimate victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, pray for Jesus to come in and He will do what we can't. Give us The Holy Spirit who will guide us in the right way.   NOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus. EVER. Regardless of what you've done or what you're going through you CAN make it through Jesus.   If you have any questions let me know.

apple because the eye-catching red color of the apple is more gorgeous than the velcro color of the banana.

I want the Apple because, the Apple is tart and sweet a juice that I love from the Apple with a Big Crunch, bananas won’t give me the same crunch cause of the soft inside of the peel. A ban an will not give that same juice it will give a taste not the same juice with the food. A Apple  is a amazing fruit it has over 2000 different types and all are different  and bananas only have half of that amount. A Apple with out fake sugar taste like it does maybe a banana does but a Apple could be tart but sweet and sweet but tart and eating it again has free no singer Apple juice that doesn’t take any extra step all you need is to take a bite unlike a banana while you’ll need to take the peel off and  take even if a just a second take more time.

Ill take the apple because one time back in primary school i had a banana. The banana was very ripe and i hated the texture and taste of it. I then cried. I cried because banana's were my favourite and this banana sucked. My banana's now need to sit for a few days if im going to eat it, but, it needs to be with something. This banana has no browning and is by itself. I also really like apples and their my favourite food.

“I’ll take the banana” “Why” Well,I would prefer the banana because it is rich in potassium, fiber and natural sugars. The vitamin C, potassium and other vitamins and minerals bananas contain help to maintain overall good health. Because the fruit's sugar content is balanced with fiber, it helps maintain a healthy blood glucose level.Bananas are also one of the best fruit sources of vitamin B6. It helps the body to produce red blood cells, metabolize carbohydrates and fats, metabolize amino acids, remove unwanted chemicals from your liver and kidneys, and maintain a healthy nervous system
Don’t forget the Apple takes the doctor away

Wow. I feel much better about my essays now; cause i was doing this since i was at first grade. I write complicated words because I feel "smart" and wanted attention. But it became my staple ever since just to fill the "100" word essays.
"I'll take the apple" "Why" "Because apples contain a high amount of vitamin C. This is a powerful natural antioxidant that can help boost your body’s resistance to both infectious agents and damage caused by free radicals. Each time you eat an apple, you’ll get a healthy dose of this important vitamin.  B-complex vitamins are also found in apples. This includes riboflavin, thiamin and vitamin B-6, all of which are essential in maintaining red blood cells and keeping your nervous system strong and healthy.  Apples include vitamin K as well. This vitamin helps to make proteins, which strengthens your bones and encourages normal blood clotting.   Vitamin E is found in smaller amounts in apples compared to these other vitamins. However, this vitamin does contribute to healthier skin and a stronger immune system.  Nutrients Your Body Needs  Besides vitamins, apples are filled with lots of healthy nutrients. Here are some of the other nutritional benefits you get from eating apples:  Dietary fiber: Dietary fiber is a key component of apples and is actually a type of carbohydrate. Best known for helping to prevent and relieve constipation, dietary fiber is great for keeping you “regular.” However, it offers a number of other important health benefits. It helps you to maintain a healthy weight, lowers cholesterols levels and can reduce your risk of heart disease, diabetes and some types of cancer. Keep in mind that most of the fiber is found in the apple peel, so leave the peel on to enjoy these health benefits.  Phytonutrients: Apples also include lots of phytonutrients. These polyphenolic compounds function as antioxidants that can protect against damage from free radicals. In addition, they can provide anti-inflammatory effects and enhance your immune system.   Minerals: When you eat apples, you’ll get a boost of important minerals like calcium, potassium and phosphorus. These minerals are required by the body in order to perform various functions, like strengthening your bones (calcium), building muscle (potassium) and filtering out waste (phosphorus)."

"Apple"  "Why" "Because with an apple, when i eat it THERE'S JUICE! Bananas have juices but not the crisp refreshing kind.

Have you ever tried a barely over ripe banana? No, well it unpleasent. The taste is banana but dry and takes the moisture from your mouth.....etc etc etc. Apples are better than bananas!"

"Because this university's education can help me improve my skill" "So like university B" "Students who graduated from this university have good jobs." "So like university C"  But the right answer that will improve chances to pass is. "Tell them why you must study at this university "I'm interesting in XYZ program but the other universities have only ABC program and the XYZ program can help me to finish --- project and can help me to ====." This is what the video realy meant

Can I please have the Banana. I'd rather have the Banana cause it's yellow, which is a color that I am very found of because it reminds me of happy times. The banana contains healthy vitamins such as potassium that help fight against depression, and I suffer from depression, so it would help me to not cry. On top of all that, Bananas are faster to eat because they are softer, and I have a cavity that bothers me if I have to chew.

“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”      We all deserve to go to hell because we have sinned. But God loved us and gave us His Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross in our place to pay the punishment of all of our sins for us when he died on the cross. Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and yet God the Son also.  God the Father (God)has raised Jesus his son from the dead. JESUS IS COMING AGAIN!!!! Repent of your sins,turn from them towards Jesus Christ, and believe in who He is and what He did for you and that God the Father has raised Him from the dead and you WILL BE SAVED FROM THE LAKE OF FIRE(hell).       Sinner’s prayer           Lord, I know I’m a sinner, I believe that you died on the cross in my place of burning in hell forever so I wouldn’t have to go to hell. I accept your sacrifice for me. Please save me from the lake of fire and forgive my sins. Thank you for the gift of eternal life!                               Amen.        Now turn from your wicked ways towards Jesus Christ and surrender your life to Him!          If anyone has any questions please ask me!             God bless you!😊♥️♥️♥️

Bananas help with preventing cramps, The choice is easy. By preparing myself with a food that won't impead on my exercise I can work out without worrying about accidentally straining my body. While the old adage of "an apple a day keeps the doctor away" is lazy and reliant on an instantaneous solution that in truth requires hard work and dedication. With that being said, I will choose the banana. Thank you - Steven Glendale.

I'll take the apple.  Why? Because I hate bananas. The sound of biting/breaking a banana actually sounds like sh%t. The smell literally makes me wretch. The taste does the same. This makes the apple the best choice for me. If the apple is a Honeycrisp, it is my favorite type of apple. The texture is lovely the meat of the apple is sweet and a lot more flavorful than a "Red Delicious" such is mealy and bland, built only for pies where the flavor comes from other ingredients.   Did I get in?😅
"It's crunchy." ... *"SO IS THE BANANA-"*

The particular reason to this circumstance is that I am very educated on the certain essential nutrients my body needs as of rn.  I need more potassium in my diet to enhance my performance at future practices, therefore contributing to my overall winnings at my tournament this upcoming weekend. The well known crescent shaped yellow berry is the only healthy option that satisfies my chemically accepted needs for my snack of the day; and since I have to lose 4 more pounds to make weight the banana, in addition, provides a much better choice since it will stick causing me not to be hungry for a while, while on the other hand an apple will travel through my digestive system fairly quick and be out and then I assume to be quiet unexquisitely hungry afterwards. 😐 Man I hate this language that's y I always ace English class 🤡

For me. I go for the Apple, because bananas are the only fruit that contain radiation, contain human dna, eating 400 bananas can kill you from potassium poisoning, a chemical contained in apples causes necrosis of calculus and reapplies the protective membrane on our teeth
Because it's red, because it's long
I want a banana, because it contains potassium which eases muscle cramps. Also it's known for being slightly radioactive, which makes it the most interesting fruit in my opinion.

I'll take the apple because the calcium in bananas gives me a headache. I'm not sure why because calcium from any other food/drink doesn't. But also because an apple a day keeps the doctor away; And I'm nowhere near able to afford a doctors visit because of my financial situation at this time as I have been eating 2 slices of bread with nothing else for about 3 weeks while I try making ends meet.  I also prefer apples over bananas because of the texture, taste, and crunchy feeling when you bite into it. I'm not one for squishy textured food such as bananas, that are mushy all the way down aside from the peel.  Aside from my pick, I'm also a messy guy, so I'd forget to throw the banana peel away and end up stepping on it one day. Slipping on it and most probably, most likely, and the greater instance will be I end up cracking my skull on the table/ground. Which would either give me a concussion, or have me draw my last breath before my forever sleep.  I believe when that happens I will be spirited away into a void of darkness and bananas because I fear the thing that ends my life will haunt me in my afterlife. To conclude, I would rather go with the apple.
Banana.  Why?  Because I like it Gives me the banana because you know it’s going to get eaten.

And I'm just failed...

People decide most things based on feels or hopes, which are not strictly related to any one logical reason. Fundamentally, most things are worth the same: why go to university A instead of university B? Most people will not give you a rational reason why they chose one over the other, because the traits that make most universities (since this is the example I’m going for) “unique” from one another are irrelevant, since they aren’t, in fact, unique in a practical sense, but may be unique for some indeterminate subjective reason, which isn’t something you can justify: it just is what it is.

Or maybe school could just teach us what we need to know for our jobs and how to function like an adult. You know, like they're supposed to.  But instead they require you to take generals again and that'll cost you thousands of more dollars that'll be dumped into the shitty sports system. There's so much wrong with the shit education system that I don't even know where to begin. It's complete bullshit.
You can thank the board of education for taking critical thinking out of our youth

Lol don't be so deep man essays are supposed to be from your own mind and idea and what do you mean by generic? "Sweet" have its own meaning by different people sweet fruits isn't the same as sweet sugar just as banana and apple have different sweetness. And are you sure that people who like apples more is because it's more crunchy and not because of its taste? At this point you're teaching us to write ideas that isn't even from our own idea but the thing that is so called "non generic" just for the sake of how will the essay will look more deep. When the professor says make a honest essay with your own idea deep or not just be it as long as it came from your mind and you wrote the essay in a correct form it's all that matters, it's the test of what's inside of mind.

And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, Jesus said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.

I want banana 🍌 cause of its FLAVOR and Potassium. But mostly cause I'm returning to monke🙊🙉/Becoming.
what the fuck, I answered all those in the exact order- what
I would prefer the banana for multiple reasons. While both fruits are healthy, bananas are significantly less sweet and contain more potassium. Not only that but they have a softer texture than an apple, making consumption an easier process. You may be thinking, “well why can you just prepare the apple to make it easier to eat?” You’re very right, we could do some preparation to make the apple softer. But the banana is a quick easy fruit to grab, especially if you have difficulty eating. This is because unlike the apple, it doesn’t require as much prep. All you need to do is peel and go
"I just really hate the texture and the feeling of peeling all the other school, sir"
“I’ll take the apple”  “Why”  “Cuz i like apples”
Ill get you a good answer "Ill take the banana because it has potassium and I like the taste of them better then red apples, however in the case of it being a green apple i'd prefer that because the sour crispness is super delicious in my opinion" how that?
Apple can be thrown at someone you dislike.

Banana because sometimes it can taste like it should be on a dessert
Bananas can be used as a scale to compare radioactivity. This is a very interesting fact even without mentioning the other note-worthy characteristics of your average banana joe. In this paragraph, I will layout possible personal preferences and situations that might allow you to compare and pick the better fruit, wether it be a banana or an apple. Firstly, a banana is sweeter than an apple, although some certain bananas are not as sweet as an apple, while being soft and relatively easy to chew. It's also easier to peel a banana; You might prefer to eat unpeeled Apples out of convinience but that is a considerable risk is certain countries, like the one I'm currently in, even with a vigorous rinse. Secondly, with a very biased and ill-informed view, we could see that apples are usually associated with academia and pompous pricks walking while reading a book in campus. Compare that to the relatability of Bananas. Due to the invention of refrigiration, bananas could now be enjoyed throughout the lands and all aspects of society. It's history and affordability as paved way to a banana loving world. From a dock worker in the 1800's, to the certain pompous pricks that has become a business pseudo-para mitilaristic cunt taking advantage of the dock workers, we can all enjoy a quick snack that is healthy and filled with blistering nutrition. Finally, bananas are great for assasinations. Imagine this: Let's say that you wanted to kill a business man. Well, all you need to do is to discreetly hide a banana peel by the docks and wait for that little devil, with his head up high with pride, chewing down his bitter red ball, to fail to see his yellow doom, leading him to slip, fall, and bash his skull open. You can finally leave your insufferable work and travel the carribean with his wife, which bed you've made warm after years of callous but compassionate sex. Together, you shall ride the waves as banana pirates. That ends my paragraph essay thing.

Kindve hard to to when there is always going to be someone with any trait the you personally have there will always be someone better and worse than you in one way or another but the mixture of all of your traits, how well you perform in different tasks, the life experiences you've had, the friends you've made, and your genetic predispositions is what makes you unique  Boiling all of it down to fit on a sheet of paper while retaining all of that information is impossible and institutions are uncaring of what actually makes you unique they only want the buzzwords in the combination they want  So what if through my choices I've escaped the abject poverty of Appalachia their dicks won't get hard unless I say I'm a good leader and am well spoken and have a big gpa   Also I'd pick the banana bc the apple skin irritates me when it's stuck in my teeth

“I’ll take the apple.” “Why?” “GIVE ME THE APPLE JERRY, AND STOP ASKING ME SO MANY QUESTIONS!”
I would choose the apple. Do to the fact that I enjoy the sadisfying crunch I get from biting down on it's bright red skin, and the sweet juices the follow soon after that makes you have to go back to the same spot to drink the liquid golden juices from it. Also because unlike bananas, I would have a much easier time planting a apple tree in a back yard than a tree that grows bananas. Yes the work we'll be long and hard, but in the end I well have my on little apple tree that I can eat the apples that I had upon worked so hard on. And every time I bite down on that big, crunchy apple full of those delicious juices inside. And it well taste ten times sweeter. I also like apples over bananas, is do to the color state of said fruits For example: If I was to ask for a red banana, people would think I'm crazy. But if I was to ask for a red apple, it would be common. But even if I was to ask about a yellow banana, people would say, "Aren't bananas normally yellow". Do to the fact that they are indeed normally yellow, but you are still able to upon ask for a yellow apple, it would also be normal since apples come in yellow as well and is commonly known for that as well.
Banana cause it taste better and its soft. It'll be funny if the kid said cause i like it long and thick.

Banana please! The apple skin gets stuck in my teeth
"Because I feel like to eat apple today"
"Id like the apple please" "Why?" "Ahem. Well you see, Me personally, I prefer the taste and texture of an apple over that of a Banana. You see, in my experience I've had quite a few bananas, most of which have had squishy parts to it. Now it's fair to say I could've avoided eaten said parts, but I am incredibly stupid, so I eat them anyways. That is most more rare in an apple, as most apples are nice, juicy and hard. It's pretty obvious to see what condition an Apple is in, usually squishy parts are brown or easily recognized, where it can sometimes be harder with a Banana. Besides, as I am a lazy bitch, having to go through the work and peel the banana, is simply too much for me. I like the ability to get straight into my snack, and eat it all, which you can with apples, with the exception of a stem, which isn't much. Apples tend to have more juice in them, hence the popular existence of apple juice, while Banana juice is rather unorthodox and different. Having a more juicy and wet snack is ideal in a fruit, as it give them a more natural and fresh feel to them, at least to me. Now I'm aware there are tons of variety when it comes to Banana kind and taste, but nothing is quite as wide as Apples. You can go from candy sweet, to nice and sour. It quite frankly amazing. It can help satisfy any sort of craving I might have, when it concerns fruit. One pro for Bananas, are how they are closely related to Monke, a clear superior species to us pathetic humans. On the contrary, Bananas are also closely related to dicks. However I've found sticking a banana up your ass is much more difficult then say, a cucumber, meaning Bananas would symbolize a dick being sucked, but I can't do that, that's Gay as fuck. Although don't have much if any relation to dick or sex, they are a nice snack to enjoy while being penetrated by a cucumber.  In Conclusion, for me personally, I find apples have more positives in terms of taste, texture and variety than Bananas do. Although this might be different for  other people this is my own response."         "oh, okay cool"

I want the apple   Why    I love apples, They are tasty, juicy and healthy for you although you can’t have to many.

The last statement to which I would prefer to receive the apple is because I am allergic to bananas. Both options are fairly healthy but only one can kill me and the other will make me enjoy having the doctors away.Thank you for Reading/listening to my statement.  :) have a nice day

Teaching critical thinking skills to the general population.  Good man.      The problem is most students just want to just pass the class and whatever lets them do that, they take advantage of.       Finding a person who wants to better humanity by contributing to the knowledge pool whilst paying for it out of pocket is quite rare but it is also the original spirit of education.

Good advice, I find people tend to fall back on generic terms and easy statements when they aren't sure of themselves though. My public speaking professor worked us around this by putting us into debates and making us discuss things in a personal sense. One of the best examples of this was our communist vs democratic debate. Most students wanted to fall into the trap of "its better for everyone" but when posed with points of argument like loss of personal property and individual possessions the discussion became a more in depth look where we were forced to analyze the actual fundamentals of both ideologies and which worked and in what situations.

So its better to appreciate the food we have right now. Also the banana when its more ripped via more black spots is more healthier due to it producing nutrients that are naturally helping our body fight off cancer when consumed.

Pro tip college essays are actually bullshit they'll try to dry you out of money and then let you keep coming back so long as you're willing to take out a loan real take on it go to a community college take classes that may have to do with the major you're actually interested in then transfer to the college you actually want to go to acceptance rate is usually about 100% the only downside to this is that you'll be essentially a freshman going into your sophomore year ask me how I know also 100% ensure that your advisor is actually advising you if they're not go directly to the dean of students do not wait around advisors are bullshit they need to get their fucking shit together

Ah yes, the “unique recourses you won’t find anywhere else.” The reality is that picking a college is a popularity contest, or picking what’s closest to you.

Me: I'll take the apple because it's lower in potassium, which helps the body retain iron. I have abnormally high iron so it'd be more beneficial for me to avoid high potassium foods like bananas.   Everyone Else: Why are you like this?  Me over analyzing: Because I have a combination of rare traits that fuel this behavior. A rare blood type, lack of a very common viral disease, knowledge that these two things make me an ideal blood donor for infants, and a combination of rare diagnosable personality traits and temperament that compel me to help others for the good of the whole. Thus, I need to keep my blood in good condition in order to best help others.  Everyone Else: what?  Me: I mean, I guess I like apples.
I’ll take the banana  Why I want the banana

At quick glance, this and my other video may seem contradictory, but they aren't. Here's why:  Mentioning a school's programs/professors/courses is acceptable and how most students *should* go about their "Why us?" college essays. The lesson from the other video is simple: don't be superficial. Don't say, "Oh, this part about your college is cool" or "Oh, your school has tons of Nobel laureates." As I say in the other video, "Don't tell colleges you like them because of the fancy stuff they have."  Instead, acknowledge the *fit* between you and a school's programs. Yes, mention what the school has, BUT THEN DRAW A CONNECTION to your interests, prior work, or future goals. For example, a great way to create this connection could be to say, "I'd love to be part of XYZ Program TO FURTHER MY WORK IN _____."  If you look at the "good" examples both in this video and the other one, I touch upon the school's resources but connect them to *my* research goals.  To summarize:  1. Other video: don't be superficial. Anyone can merely *point out* the fancy facilities a school has. Your goal is to *draw a meaningful, personal connection* between a school's resources and your goals.  2. This video: don't be generic. A statement like, "Your school has world-renowned professors," could apply to *any* college. Mention details that are unique to the college the essay is for.
