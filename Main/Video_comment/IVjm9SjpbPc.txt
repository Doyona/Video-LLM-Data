Why did chael sonnen say ksi won ? (Or was that someone else)
This is where KSI got cracked. The loss crushed his ego.
KSI won the fight for me honestly fk tommy fury the judges were freaking dumb stupid
This was so well thought out.
I admire your creativity.
This was fun AND informative.
Could this be the best upload yet?
I’m sharing this with friends.
This deserves a million views.
The pacing was perfect.
This video cured my boredom.
this type of judging should be unfair at this point.
This was exactly what I needed.
Don’t trust compubox, they just press buttons
Is it bad I want more of this?
legacy baby - legacy
Big thumbs up for this one.
10/10 would watch again.
U definitely lost
This video was so relaxing.
Yeah honestly it’s clear JJ needed to be knocked down a peg.
It's coz your stance was shit for boxing that's why you lost
JJ. Ksi. Lots. Tommy fights with boxing. Ok
This video has great replay value.
Since this video, Tommy Fury fought once then broke his hand twice or something. Hilarious how things play out
Bro why do you have a big forehead
JJ.  Fight. Tommy. I’m sure you have. Good. Lots sorry ksi
Ksi. You. Love. You. Missing. I’m sorry. Lots Tommy  and. Fighting
Great job, keep it up.
KSI after being a fan for a long time, you did well fam but I can't be a fan when you say we should berate him in public. Not a good trait I wanted to learn from you Fam.
The irony that Jake also fought an old Mike Tyson 5:36
It was a bad fight man, just bouncing around doing nothing isn't a boxing match.
Really enjoyed the music choice.
U won that fight and the judge was paid by fury
My attention span actually survived this one.
Insufferable. Narcissist.
Fire fire
Dis is what being broken by somebody feels like, Ksi know he lost but he just couldn’t except it…he wanted to do what Jake Paul couldn’t and he failed and that’s what really fucked him up
Nah you lost
The cope is strong with this clown 🤡 even his annoying stupid laugh is full of cope. This guy is so unlikeable.
This dude has the most fake and annoying laugh. I never liked this KSI dude but holy shit he just showed how much of an egomaniac is really is.
T
i been looking at old videos of u and this one came up, i decided to read some comments and some of them are honestly so flippen dramatic to the point tht they should write a book of how much stupidty there comments is. i woke up at half 6 today for some reason and wanted to be on violence, nice day everyone😎😎
JJ omo Olatunji, na won pa daku lojomi!!! Forget all the advantages he had and that you are a youtuber. OMO YORUBA, NAWON PA DAKU!!!!  SHOW THIS TO YOUR PARENTS TO TRANSLATE
Tommy fk u up😂😂
Im such a huge fan and you get me through on a day to day basis. But you lost the fight mate
You won that fight more clearly than your flight against Logan. Think they just didn't want a youtuber beating an "Boxer"
Don’t think for a single moment that Tommy really cares about people saying you won and he lost on his Instagram or any other social media account. He probably doesn’t care at all. He’s a celebrity just like you, and he gets so many notifications that he doesn’t even have time to read them all. So no matter how many times people comment to remind him that he lost the fight, he couldn’t care less.
4:06 throwback to deji on the freebies and not changed since 😂
Ohhhh
Remember when ksi laughed at logan for the appeal, man karma is a bitch fr
It should’ve been a draw. Worst fight I’ve ever seen. All hugging. I stopped watching influencer boxing after Misfits 12. I stopped watching KSI and The Sidemen after this fight
You clown 🤡
Even if you didn’t win Ksi you are still great at boxing
Rewatched the fight and ksi definitely lost. It was a flawed game plan of stay on the out side blitz and clinch. He clinched way too much And ate a lot of shots on the outside some uppercuts coming in. Boring fight but fury won 100%
KSI WON RE WATCH IT GUYS
People who say Tommy won clearly dont know anything
KSI is a hard-working motherfucker in the planet. He inspires me to try harder and not give up, but the reaction after losing to a fellow Love Island star Tommy Fury is kinda egotistic. He hates losing but sometimes you need to accept defeat bro. Tommy also doesn’t win Love Island, despite never losing any boxing matches. He also loses his girlfriend as well. Everybody has to lose somehow, it’s impossible to win all the time. JJ, you need to take the L like a champ next time.
You won tottaly ksi you won urs just the judges was being unfairly you won furry didn't do anything I rewatched the fight he kept on hitting the back of your head but you won for sure
He’s right tho 5:44
Bro,you lost admit it bruh.....
I mean look at this I'm still a virgin yet you have millions with a girlfriend.
Fury won comfortably
All you did was hugs 🤗
Reply to this ya big wimp, im seventeen and ill whoop yo butt easy 😂 Not in the ring in the octagon or on the street. Keep being a sore loser though, i mean i would be angry too if i lost to tommy fury.
Sewer king brought me here 😂
Ksi ksi ksi ksi ksi
U won that fight and the judge was paid by fury
This single video is more embarrassing than all of Deji’s L’s combined.
So fking immature, you’re not a man
Yeah I remembered how much of a little bitch JJ was after he lost that fight lol
I've never seen someone say so much yet so little
The this video aged pretty well tommy got cocky and lost his girl and his stock has fallen alot
Yes, you did
Bro cleaaaaarly lost 😂😂😂😂😂😂
JJ u were really going through a tough time "huh"? and we see how this fight has damaged u (menally and pysicly) ,maybe its best if u just don't fight Jake Paul ye? (BUT STILL F JAKE PAUL RIGHT🎉)
jesus christ you are delusional. This hurts to watch.
Honestly, I seriously feel his pain and I'm not even a boxer, I could care less about any of the fury's
He definitely won , sucks that he got robbed
7:21
turns out tommy was cheating on his missus😬
this title aged well
Tommy ❤
Well said jj well said
us true boxing fans seen it coming and warned you over and over again but we just got called "haters" and told to shut up. Tommy out classed you in every way in the lead up to the fight, during the fight and after the fight - which is why you lost. Tommy made you look like the amateur you were in the ring, you were all over the place, trying some dynamic fighting style that just worked against you. Tommy done what he said, he delivered, Well done Tommy.  Trying to use your fanbase to send hate to the Furys...and tommys kid... is next level SAD, PATHETIC behaviours and plays another part in why you LOST and why you are so hated
Dear Ksi, i know you probably wont see this, but I want to inform you that a score of 57-57 and 57-56 that the judges scored this contest, is simply not possible if you do the math. I don't know how anyone have not seen this, but if both fighters won 3 rounds it would be 57-57 and as we know, Tommy got a point taken, wich means he can not end on a even score or win by one point. If he won 4 rounds -1 point he would have 58, wich means you would get 56 wich none of the judges scored it, and if he won 3 rounds -1 point he would get 56 and you would get 57. Even if you lost a round so bad you would get 8 points, the total amount of point to give would be 118, wich means a maximum score on a draw could be 56-56. So none of the three judges scored the fight correctly, wich means 3 judges gave incorrect scorecards. Either by forgetting taking a point from Tommy or just miscalculated. Just wanted you to know or maybe make a complain or demand a reevaluation.
I dont know why people are saying that KSI Hugged the whole time, it was Tommy Fury that was doing the hugging
Take that L nga
the upbeat music kills me. i just know he was salty the entire time while talking
Some egotistical people needs a humbling experience but surely you can make an argument KSI should have won. Some judges will score fights based on biases and favoritism.
Who cares it was wank
2:29 Ksi got his ahh knocked down he put his left hand on the canvas 😂
0:38 life is fair bc it’s unfair for everyone
Ksi got robbed he won the fight
I honestly don't see his perspective as wrong. It was a very close fight and imo a draw was the best outcome
From the screen to the ring to the pen to the king
.*
Guys of course he lost but it was close and arguably Ksi could have won
Womp Womp 4head
GET BACK OUT THEIR FURYVSKSI 2
Just accept your L’s and come back stronger and better that all we want to see
Is this guy talking about tommy collabing with bad people????? Pretty ironic huh
So is this where it all started going down hill?
Because a bunch of randoms say u won means u won ? While the actual judges who still took the point away from fury and u still lost , he was landing more punches , jj was just throwing more punches completely different
U lost fair and square and you needed it
The amount of times Tommy fury hit bro in the back of the head 😂😂😂
Can't wait till that appeal is process and comes back saying KSI is the winner.
If he never lost he would've not been in the thick of it  ☠☠
Literally from here on forward it feels like he changed for the worst
even the commentators said they thought you won
ksi got mopped
The fight  should of been a draw because with that point reduction tommy should not of won that
What a prat
This guy can’t take a single loss like a man. Even with his recent song…talent takes you to the top, character brings you back down.
looking back Tommy must have hit you HARDDD
Anyone who think he's trolling when he got all bitchy that people dont like his music clearly never seen this video before
this lil fuckin kid has integrity tatted on him but acts the way he does lmaooo
damn meat riders go hard lmfao pipe tf down you were never a boxer just a dirty street fighter go crazy thats who you are lol. who tf trained  you my guy xDDDD
Yes…you did
So this was the turning point for Mister Knowledge (lacking), Strength (also lacking), and Integrity (None)
You lost, so yes you are a loser or you thought losing makes you a winner?
First bro bitches about losing now getting cooked by The Diamond Minecart. What a man👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
Some people say ksi won , some say tommy won.  At the end of the day the only opinion that matters is the judges decision, they say tommy won and on record its there forever.  But I lost alot of respect for ksi , the way he reacted to his loss was so disappointing and hard to watch.
Obviously eddie hearn will talk shh about a fury suprised david haye aint got a clip of him saying same sh
John fury would beat you too 😂
u lost nga quit cryin
2:50 shut the f* up man you are rich and are earning so much money who wouldnt have motivation to train?
ksi a fraud hahahha
Lee Scott Johnson Cynthia White Robert
Amount of salt in this video , just accept your lost
Man just accept it you’ve done a good job
Now ksi knows how Joe Weller feels know it took 5 years from 2018 to 2023
Tommy won easy! Ksi you’re trash. I could beat you.
With the way you fight I’m 90% sure a amateur boxer like myself could take you out bro . I support you but u can’t be egotistical your style is really bad you need a new fighting style
I love JJ loads, I've been a fan for years, but jesus his ego is MAD, just accept the loss bro, you can't win everything
This age well , Tommy got caught lacking 😂
JJ acually called it at 7:01 8 months before anybody. This aged like fine wine after the announcement
7:01 JJ called it
Nah tommy won
You were training hard but you didn’t fight well during Tommy fight.   You weren’t keeping your hands up during the fight and this was the shittiest thing that you have done in the fight you weren’t using your jab enough jj you were only using your right hand he was using his jab and the over hand hooks and uppercut the whole fight and that’s why Tommy won
Do not get me wrong jj you worked hard for the fight but you didn’t win this one because Tommy was the one who was fighting in the right way he was fighting like  pro boxer he was using his jab correctly the whole fight when he used his jab you were clinching I am your fan jj but sorry I am saying the truth 🤍
And you lost to this guy😂
He deserved to win
You lost
In a 9 minute video, 5 minutes are only him telling what he has done that we know he has. Yeah, he didn't knock you out, and you STILL lost. He is schooling Tommy about his fatherhood? What? Wtf does that have to do with the boxing? That's his life, let him have it. The world ofc isn't gonna matter in this match, because the rules of the game say that the judges have to decide a winner, so that's what matters. And by the sight of it, they chose Tommy, Tommy won. Easy. If you lost, you lost. Move on. Let's go on. Yes you can do whatever you want to do in life, but don't become a sore loser. Calling yourself a 13 y/o FIFA player who 'beat' a professional boxer, is just a sore way of trying to get sympathy. Didn't like this video at all. Not a good reply.
JJ....props to your fight, you probably should have won, you fought well. The Instagram post was spot on too.  He is awkward and a bit of a bellend. But leave the smack talk out a bit, its mad disrespectful to speak of another mans kids like that bro. Learn to do better my guy ✌🏼
I think these comments are stupid. There are NO fans in these comments and NO idea on how close ksi was to winning that fight. It was either a draw or a win on ksi. Even JAKE said it and everyone else in the beginning clips😂
So at last, he acknowledged that he lost against Tommy. Took some time...
I have supported KSI for a long time and that’s not gonna change because of this incident but he definitely gotta do some more self reflection. We all make mistakes and his are just broadcast to millions of people so I’m not gonna get down on him for this but JJ you better then this.
Well many people are saying he won bro so why are everyone hating on ksi bro everyone is more supportive towards ksi then tommy furry so i think ksi won
KSI needs to lose again to get humbled completely.
The robbery of the fight was that it was even a split decision 😂
Why you moving like a pathetic loser... I once respected you so ironic you becoming what you once hated..
Bro was hugging Tommy more than his father
What about you repeatedly hugging tommy and not boxing could have led to tge loss
0:10
Sorry bro you got cooked
ksi thank you for staying chill you right you won him love you man good jobe keep up ill sub
Biggest copium hit ever for. kSI
thats hilarious cuz adesanya 2 seconds after that clip said that ksi def lost
Man he needed this humbling but not accepting so hope he loses again
Man m so sad for your loss, i want to give you a kangaroo hug
You lost, foo.
KSI you're embarrassing.
We love you honestly, you’re a champ in my views. Everyday and probably always will be. Just remember that God knows your strength s and nobody not even the devil himself can manipulate that from you King
Really sick of Tommy Furry fans in comments acting like KSI told his fans to harass Tommy and his family when all he really did is make good arguments of why he should have won and told his fans to tell Tommy Furry he lost, thats that, he never said "Go and harass his family" or anything like that.
You needed that L bro somebody had to humble that giant ego of yours
That last round alone for me is why I give it to KSI the other rounds were close to tie because of the deductions but Fury got away with a lot 😂😂 a lot
Eddie Hearn hates the Furys, True Georgie is team KSI and has beef with Tyson Fury, Adesanya is Nigerian and is sponsored by prime, Ariel Helwani is a golddigger and runs with the A side, aight fair with DJ and Chael. I know it's been 6 months since the fight took place, but haven't watched the video until now.
bro lost 😂
😂😂
“Remind Tommy I won” bro what an L honestly
It's gonna be a long comment probably you ain't gonna read it. It's fine I'm JUST ONE OF OVER 20M subs of yours.   Sorry for only watching now, I'm sad coz of it, because I was disappointed not because you lost, because how you reacted afterwards. From my part it WAS an overreaction to not care about you, but at that time I felt like my hero/my idol betrayed me. Thought me to be determined and dare to dream big, but when the first obstacle came you left not with your head held up and and ready for more like you teach, the opposite. Sorry for not being here with you for half a year. I AM PROUD OF YOU AND I ALWAYS WILL BE BECAUSE YOU ARE MY INSPIRATION
Bro you were hugging the whole time, you deserve to lose lmao
Clown, you did all that “I’m different” talk to hug him like a long lost relative and cry at the end when you lost  No amount of money and fame will allow you to look yourself in the mirror and be proud of that wack performance 😂
We're JJ's real fans as we're hating on him for the right reasons
End of the day you still have millions of fans that love you and your videos
“Hop like a kangaroo hug like a bear”-KSI
One of the worst videos in jj career frr
I feel like the judges were biased because of your YouTube background. Split decision, of course they are going to side with the guy who isn't a youtuber. Absolute nonsense. You deserved better JJ
that's a mistake
take it down man not cool its gonna come back for you in the future remove it
Ksi vs Jake paul we gotta see it
Fight Jake Paul stop ducking it broskie we all want to see it
Duck duck goseeeeeee
Fight jake
Fight jake
This was so hard to watch  Its like a kid trying desperately to have the last laugh after getting punished.  Imagine jjs reaction if deji made a similar video after losing oh my god, he would go crazy . I wish i could dislike something twice on YouTube
So,...you lost... tommy furry winner💪😄
JUST QUIT THAT FUCKING JUMPING JACKS “TECHNIQUE” OF YOURS FFS JJ. IT’S THE REASON WHY YOU GASED OUT IN THE FIGHT.
U lost 😂😂😂
Im cringing i cant believe i was a fan years ago.
Ksi your disgusting mate
Cry about it lil man you lost. Deal with it
In this era of youtube I'm finding out the real meaning of "What goes around comes around"JJ was once mocking Logan Paul for being a sore closer and now people be smokin that KSI pack
KSI ❌ S ✅
Why did you work so hard to not even throw punches you was flapping about and hugging so much. It was so awful to watch so if you do fight again id love you to prove me wrong because i know you must put the work in.
Ksi shouldn't have done what he did but he should have won and people fail to realise that everyone is a human and our worst enemy is our own emotions
Sorry you fought a REAL BOXER and you lost by decision.. Please stop trying to PROVE that you won.. Stop trying to be a boxer and just be what you are which is a YouTuber..i mean your telling your fans to attack him on social media.. This proves that you're not a good sport... When a real boxer loses a fight they take the loss and move on they don't go to the boxing commission and appeal it.. Be what you are a YouTuber.. Nothing wrong with that be the best YouTuber you can be and let the real boxers .. BOX!!
I had the fight as a draw
Honestly KSI I used to like you but now I realize you just suck at boxing no offense I still fw some of your old videos
Maybe KSI shouldn't have faced Jake in a fight too because since he's making excuses about his loss with Tommy, I have a feeling he might lose to Jake too, so if you choose to fight with Jake you'll probably gonna end up regretting this KSI
KSI is a loser that’s all.
Bro just accept that you lost the fight with Tommy Fury and move on. Getting angry and sad isn't gonna change a single thing. If you lose, get back up and keep trying, you'll be successful one day. Stop worrying over little things. And the fact you're telling people to berate Tommy is not ok
He won’t let his ego lose to grow and take the respectable path. I’ve liked KSI for a long time but that respect was seeing a chill dude becoming something amazing and bigger while still being true to himself.  He’s just not been the same. Excuses, lies, avoiding his fans opinions. Disappointing.
I wish youtube bring back dislike button 😂😂😂
bluds never lost
hardly anything all you did was hug. i swear if i didn't know any better id say you were trying to kiss him
Well well well, and he laughed at logan pauls video on losing
You lost, just admit you’re a sore loser just like Logan Paul, take the L move on you’re not the greatest to ever live, handle it and move forward damn 🤷🏽‍♂️💯
attacking his family and telling your fans to harass him is a bit too far ngl
I dont care if you lost or won but JJ the fight was so trash. Just hugging eachother
Why you whining, if it was such pathetic boxing that nobody considers it a valid fight why are you breaking down and begging for a recount on this, its like you got 5 less kills on zombies and cant accept it with this
holy shit the cope
hahaha, egotistical here, egotistical that. And saying such an unpleasant words but do not know why JJ is mad😂. HE was supposed to win. He outlanded tommy in 3 rounds With a 1 point deduction. He was supposed to win😂. Y'all saying words like "sore loser", even "master manipulator" is a living proof of y'alls ignorance😂😂
Jake Paul handled a loss better than you💀
Just as cringe and pathetic as when I first watched it
Your ego is bigger than your fore head
sore loser
The fight was definitely unfair go cry bout it
Womp womp
Remember how Khabib humbled and humiliated Connor the same way fury and his father humbled and humiliated KSI and sent him back to his regular Sidmen Sundays 💯  Glad all of us are on the same page and we will not get manipulated by him to bully fury.
w
Wouldnt ksi vs jake be the most logical match ever being YouTubers and out of all the boxing youtubers probably the best. Although ksi isnt even that great and jake is average compared to pros.
P.s I’m gonna wait for people to call me a dickrider for what I’m about to say lol   Now This Is In My Personal Opinion On Who Won This Fight I Know It’s Been Awhile Since The Fight Happened But I Can’t Stand The Amount Of People In Here Who Aren’t Even Boxing Viewers And Probably Just Hating On This Guy For Standing Up For His Loss I Watch The Fight Live And At First I Did Think That It Was A Draw But Rewatching Again I Personally Think That KSI Won This Fight Barely 6 Rounds I Saw It 3-3 But -1 point In The Second Round In A 6 Round Fight Loses So I Don’t Blame Him For Being Upset And Pissed Off And Kicking Shit Lol But He Did Get Robbed Last Year Was Boxing Biggest Robbery’s Loma VS Haney Fury VS Negganu idk How To Spell His Name Sorry Rolly VS Barroso And Even Davis VS Garcia Was Gonna Be A Robbery With One Of The Judges Scoring 10-9 and 10-10 In The Second Round.  But At The Same Time What He Did Saying To His Fans To Harass Fury Is Not Alright Again I Do Get It He’s Mad But You Can’t Just Tell Your Fans To Attack Someone Just Because Of The Controversial Decision Because Now What You Are Doing Is Wrong But Its Months Later And He Still Hasn’t Been Selected As The Winner Which Sucks But At The End Of The Day It’s Boxing. Boxing Is Considered Unfortunately Rigged By People Even By Some Boxing Fans That Is Why People Say Anything Can Happen Because Literally Anything Can Happen.   But Yeah That’s My Personal Opinion The Whole Topic 👍
Get over it fight was shite but at least Tommy made up for all the hugs you’ve been craving for
You fight like you lose. Poor.
Your  fans  think you  but  You  trash  in  ring
Noooo lots of people said you lost... only KSI bummers in the comments say you win lol
You were indeed robbed, but it doesn't make it right to harass Fury.
WE LOVE YOU JJ :]
Embarrassment, grow up and be humble
When you hug the guy for the entire fight, I think you deserved the loss my dude.
Ksi deff won if you watched
You should have had multiple points deducted as well cause there were multiple shots to the back of Tommy’s head as well that somehow everybody missed. If they actually deducted those points accordingly Tommy would have absolutely slaughtered you just based on that alone. But he didn’t cry when you hit him the back of the head like you did.
Jj you have gone insane
The old Ksi will never be topped and when you fight tommy fury your gonna get dropped!!
they hoed you ngl
Lmao he thought he won the fight because "how could I lose? I transformed!"
He is LITERALLY went from lv 1 noob to lv 1000 boss
bro stop tryna justify the loss u lost and that’s that, i couldn’t find no clips in this fight of you possibly beating tommy. maybe dedicate yourself to a hugging career?
im american but this guy is a nonce
Should've added the elbow incident when he said "Life isn't fair, am I right?"
I unsubbed the minute i seen him cry live. I knew hed be a sore loser when he made this video so i never watched until now and well...i was right lol. Just stop being so overly cocky man and nobody would hate on you
Goes after his family and his character for losing while sending his goons after him. Pathetic man Deji was kinda right
Sore loser 😂
its been quite a while since the fight i can say this what ever you say about jj hes a sore loser this and that, you gotta give him props for being a way better competitor then jake paul, jake was legit getting slapped by tommy, and even if u complain about ksi's fighting style he only did that to confuse tommy and its smart he did that to minimise tommys jabs
You've gone mad mate..take the L and come out better..
Bro really? that’s how you deal with losing, by putting your opponent down cause he won?!!!, you should never put down your opponent even if you think he didn’t win, you should’ve said he won I lost and that’s it, only god knows how much I would’ve respected you at that moment.
I'm so late to this party BUT this video is clear that KSI is trying to keep the 'tension' so that there's enough hype & interest for a rematch. These things he's saying is less harsh than the crap he was way saying about Logan. Its all marketing to keep people interested.
Dont let it to the judges next time excuse boy
greetings from coffeezilla
This video is embarrassing 😂😂😂
How far you have fallen
LSI
Ego is definitely not your friend..he will look back at this and shake his head😢
bro u deserved this loss ure fucking ego is the reason u lost anyways u were just huggin tommy he mauled u tbh
Conducted himself poorly in the build up the the fight and showed a complete lack of class when Tommy was announced as the winner and is still showing a lack of class, awful role model for kids. There is also nothing in the boxing rule book to suggest jumping on the spot and lunging wildly at your opponent scores you points and the constant turning of your back on your opponent makes the fight unwatchable. Ksi represents everything that is wrong with kids in today’s society
So we're going after someone's family now? Wow what a class act man.🤝
This was flat out pathetic jj… damn… As someone who enjoyed your content since 2014, 2015 it is really sad to see you turned into this egomaniac weirdo
either a draw at most or win for you in my opinion but don't stop fella keep it up :)
Yea
Buddy sounds like 2018 Logan Paul 😭
Late comment: at the end of the day ksi lost to me personally he should have won see this as motivation that your levels about all influences and keep going
I’ve never wished I had someone else’s problems before. I wish I had JJs problems man. Haha. Love ya JJ 👊✌️
You lost, foo.
I think KSI is bad because he lost the fight
bro still has a ego, bro still cries about to this day lol
A wise man once said watch carefully at others  Body language   You will be able 2 see all just by their laugh     This guy thought its funny  too laugh  At the question about what he thought about gaza    We noticed his laugh said it all  Boycott this KSI
Sore looser. Embarrasing
dude idk man 🗿
A lot of fake fans here claiming to be disappointed. It’s a boxing match and purely for entertainment. Funny how everyone treated this so seriously
Dude just sounds salty man like you lost… tommy is your dad
Man took it personal...
Honestly , I think it’s time to just focus on yourself and bettering yourself away from boxing. Forgive the situation and push forward.
its been 2 months and you seem to still think u won
Y’all hug a lot
You are actually insane dude lol. Everyone respected you for the fight but this video feels like a second L for you…
Just take ur L we will forget after a month or 2
this is how brutal combat sports is yes it's great to see a legend knock out and brutally beat some guys   but did we even think on what the dude who lost feels they should've been into hell of depression and life questions after months of inhumane training they'll end up being on the highlight being knocked out and lose for me that would be depressing
They took nothing from you. You never had it, and you weren't good enough.   Believing you won that fight proves how disconnected from reality you are, and how little you know about boxing.  Quit.  Go back to making youtube videos for children.
🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂
LSI
even months after the fight he still is a sore loser
Konishiwa💀💀💀
I know amateur boxers who weigh half of you, that would box your head off🤡
Obnoxious
Nigga was talking bout him being an absent father 😂
Well if tommy is that shit why couldn't you knock him out ?
This is the moment i stopped watching KSI:(
LOGAN PAUL is still Scamming from watch coffeezilla
You are a loser here. You did nothing but dive to his shirts. And those who supported you, they just tried to keep contact with money and fame. Big L for being dissatisfied and angry
You didn’t win simple
I love him for this😂
L
It sounds like bro is reading from a script tbh
I never thought I'd ever think this but...seeing him talk about his timeline of success. Makes me seem like I've achieved nothing ksi's family is amazing even if they went on one holiday the positivity and success is such a blessing most couldn't dream of or comprehend.. cheers mate to good years to come
I don’t anyone is surprised he tried to over turn the decision he just can’t take an L
What an asshole, money corrupted his brain. This guy needs to be humbled alot more.
JJ... i expected better man, take the loss like a man.
how did he move that fast what the fu-
If you compete you risk the loss there has to be a loser and a winner
U never lose if you make millions of dollars👍
Bro we’re we watching the same fight?? Tommy didn’t even box like wtf am I seeing in these comments 🤣🤣🤣
Looking at this from an objective standpoint, this is way worse than Logan after the ksi 2 fight
This was wholesome thanks g 💯 you should have won. You are taking it like a chanpion 🏆
Hahaha what an embarrassment. You can tell he hasn't gotten over shit
Gonna “shock the world” again JJ?
People in the comments are being weird for no reason if KSI had a rematch, he wins, Tommy was horrible in that fight to be a “prodigy”
YOU WON THE FIGHT JJ YOU ARE A BETTER BOXER THAN TOMMY FURY AND JAKE COMBINED
Young ksi wouldn’t be proud. Achieved so much yet lost most respect from the OG fans such as myself. It’s sad to see.
We all need to realise that boxing is rigged and that fight def was just like the fight that Tyson fury had with Francis , exact same thing happend there that happend here
loooooser geek
Man this is just too salty for me to take in... and I'd say it's kind of a bad idea to talk about Tommy's Child considering that you've... nevermind, have a blessed day
nah bro harassing someone w your fans is wild and i think you won 😂
If you didn’t hold every five seconds and just took the shots like a man people would be less disappointed in you
Does anyone know the like-dislike ratio? my extension isn't working for some reason
A lot of snowflakes in here 💀.It’s crazy to think so many people look up to celebrities as role models & don’t focus on themselves 😒.Tommy did bad as professional boxer & BARELY won 😭.I see nothing but negativity in these comments & they’re calling ksi a bad person 💀.If you’re gonna provide feedback do it a professional manner.Don’t just write negative stuff & call yourself a fan 😒
Your ego grows every year, it's sad...
Nah. Tommy won that fight easy. Ya got outboxed and you got to live with that. The cope is stronh with this one.
I love u but wtf don’t collab with dazns ever again they’re literally scamming people I’m a college student and now I have to paid a full year subscription which is €140 after only using it to watch the ksi fight like that’s so upsetting
laughing at someone not managing to knock someone out when you haven't been able to knock out a single person without an elbow, shit even swarmz who had been training for like 1 nanosecond danced around in the ring and you couldn't corner him at all  bro's laughing and venting hate trying to seem like it's funny or he's laughing at shit but he's just trying to insult and let out his rage without seeming pathetic and petty when he's super angry still lol. bro needed more than a loss, i don't think ksi lost but christ, at this point i rather he actually just got the win so he'd stfu and quit being a baby, bro's like twice my age acting like a baby, why are most popular youtubers all so below everyone mentally and have only 1 good thing and that's content?
took bro like 2-3 months to get over this but no not actually, he decided to make a video on how he should've won :/ eh
Dude, you were an inspiration years back, but a few successes and millions of dollars later has made you become what you hated, its so sad to see for all KSI fans. You need to accept that people lose, its just what happens in life, not just the fight game. Also the 'woe is me, life is hard'  rant is very condescending as you are quite literally set for your life while a lot of us graft 60+ hours working hard. This isnt me bashing you, im just saying you need to be more appreciative of what you have, despite your loss, you won.
Ahhh the cocky asshole is mad ye lost ahhhh🤣🤣
KSI has fallen so far. I knew of this way before back when he boxed swarmz and stuff he bacame less and less likable, having easy fights to artifically boost his ego messed him up.  Not even that the fact everyone ignores that hes partnered with logan paul with prime. Even though logan paul has scammed so many people and robbed their money nobody blames KSI for partnering with a conartist.
This is why jake paul is more likable then KSI
i diss agrry with you in that point but it is what it is اخوكم ممن الحوطة
Your a sore loser !!!! Straight hater win is a win hahahahahaha
So much copium...
How embarrassing man
5:23 🤮🤮🤮 how did he think this was ok to say on a public YouTube video?
Just remember you lost
I see people saying KSI should take his L but what about all those actual real fighters saying he should have won? I’d be thinking man all these pro fighter dudes that are actively fighting said I should have definitely won that I would have been thinking the same.
Do a rematch,the comeback
L
I wouldve got you ready, pay me the ko bonus
Insecure little kid
You came out better? Your strategy was to clenched him the entire fight? Come on have some dignity.
you're so embarrassing to even watch
Im on your side JJ. You won the fight, get some rest and enjoy life. Tommy is a joke, 7:00 😂😂😂😂
K.S.I. take the L on the chin and keep it moving no need to tryin assassinate someone's character you fought a professional fighter you lost it is what it is be the bigger person and accept defeat and learn from it tommy is a professional boxer he should have won the fury brothers can fight anyone and the ppv sales will go crazy same with any other high level boxer with a track record like the fury brothers it is what it is.... I think this is the first time ive ever seen someone appeal a decision in a fight 🤣🤣🤣
This dude calls himself the best YouTube boxer bro if your a boxer you would take the loss like a man
He didnt knock u out and struggled to jab u because all u did was duck and hug him so he had no room 😂
Yes u did, for most the fight you were doing jumping jacks from a mile away, blatantly looking to jab and throw a wild right hand and whenever that missed you just hugged tommy. The amount of times you clinched on was stupid u showed little to no boxing ability unlike Tommy. I thought Tommy could of done more to get out of your clinches but he still was the aggressor in the fight so yes u didnt deserve to win that
Lmao JJ what did you do this comment section is malding
This video is the proof of tommy destroyed KSI not physically but mentally as well
man is on the Trump juice. thinking “he’s right” and “he won” because his fans tell him he did. pretty pathetic for a guy who’s trying to come across as strong.
it was 50/50 tbh but I could tell Tommy was the better boxer you saw how you kept clinching when he tried coming inside
bro why are  you guys  angry at him for not taking the loss he clearly should have won
I don’t get the hate to his response. He’s human and he thought he won (granted the fight was debatable but that’s besides the point) so it’s natural to complain. You fans put the expectations on him and how he should act and then be angry when he doesn’t? Actually go outside and do something with your life. Boxing is a personal sport and intimate so it’s natural to dislike your opponent. But you fans are the problem, it’s ignorant to expect someone as successful as ksi to take a debatable loss quietly. Ksi fans need to grow up so much by the looks of it
The fact that this video is still up is crazy 😂
15,072 people are disappointed in you yet
Bro cried after he turned off the camera 💀
Ego as big as his forehead 😑
Ngl this is a super disappointing response.   Making a post of "this nerdy boy was able to fight blah blah"  no, your just arnt that nerdy person anymore through and through.   And going after fury as a husband? Brother its not your relationship, it aint your place to speak on. You have no idea what theyre relationship dynamic is like.   Youve disappointed a lot of people and i highly doubt you see that due to your ignorance growing alongside your ego.
And this is what the kids are watching...  God help us all
Haha get good.
Jj im going to be real with you, the fight was close , I think it could’ve went either way , personally I think Tommy is a more knowledgeable and experienced boxer for obvious reasons, that doesn’t mean you don’t have natural talent, however I also believe they way u preformed in the ring was not the way people want to see boxing done , it doesn’t mean it’s bad and I can see u are going for a unique approach but I think if u had boxed him in a more relaxed manner like u did against swarms and Pineda I think u could’ve just out boxed him because your naturally more powerful and probably more durable and it would’ve looked cooler. I’m no expert and I do box, I also have my own personal techniques that look strange to others but haven’t failed me yet 😂 I would love to spar u sometime (obviously won’t happen for a bit) but you will see me in the boxing world one day I promise. 😂 I have a dream anyways don’t give up lol I haven’t even finished the video I just started it
makes me a little happier every day that i remember every night before this guy goes to bed he has to remember that he lost
Ksi hug that man so much it was like he loved him .smh
You truly are not worth of your fan base
Bro saying bad shit about him that aint even related to boxing
Why are people hating on this video? I don't understand why other youtubers are using this video for content, if I was in his shoes I'd probably do the same, his presence on social media is too large to not do a video about this, and all the sore loser stuff is weird, and going so far as to say he's not a man for not taking a loss, what boxer in history took a loss and was actually fine with just losing, losses should hurt and they should frustrate you, and yeah there's a phase right after where you can't stop thinking about it, and a response video is valid, because, well not ride rooster, he for sure rocked fury. I feel bad for the guy, but fury ain't got it like he does so you know at the end of the day, this man is just venting his feelings like a good man should
Sore loser 😂
Hey your prime so good
Been subbed to you for 15 years since your fifa days. Money and ego has got to you. Win or lose the way you handled the situation is childish and pathetic. Unsubbed
Holy shit this was pathetic. Cope harder bro
I couldn't imagine being such a sore loser even if I was ACTUALLY robbed of winning. You need to grow up and become a man before you start boxing. The fact that Tommy already humbled you and you are still this narcissistic, arrogant, entitled, and pathetic is insane.
KSI really asked his audience to harass a man(both on and off line) after he lost a fight months ago
idk man. i started watching you since u beat logan. i dont like logan before so i feel like you humbled him. then, you start going big and bigger inspiring people that people can win with hardwork. but seeing you know is like a completely different person. its like you becoming more like the previous logan and he is becoming the you before.  after you tasted victory or success, you always feel like you never lose or CANNOT lose. come on man. this is not the ksi that we all know.   i feel like you needed this lose. your ego is going wild now. you started from zero, so what is the big deal for a lose? please listen to your fans jj. if you keep like this, this is the route of downfall. stop bragging about your prime. you dont realize what actually the fans can do to effect you. stop acting so up and high, if you cannot deal the height.
Cry more
Trash grifter
"Life isn't fair" says the multimillionaire. You are more deluded than Ty from AFTV
This guy is as real as his staged fights  Stfu stop taking advantage of your viewers who are children lol
They just didn't want ksi to win ksi actually one that
Who are you going to fight next
7:51 let’s keep reminding you that you did this as a way to deflect your pitty loss
Wow this is lame. Be a man, own the loss and move on!
"Winners don't make excuses when the other side plays the game" ~ Harvey Specter
Crybaby the forehead is to big for pro fighter😂
This video is hard to watch
He's coping...give him time but dont yall think you're being a bit too harsh on JJ
Stuff aside, did you guys notice the robbery with Ngannou against Fury? Brother knew he won brother left as a winner.   I don’t know what to make of KSI. But I do know Ngannou is a G.
I've always been a KSI fan but he's teamed up with a piece of trash to make money off of bad hydration
Cringe asf your ego doesn’t let you see that you lost and you say u “feel a lot better” and then be so salty to tell ur own fans to literally berate the man on social media and in person then after that having audacity talking about his wife and kid you have no idea what he’s doing with his family and kid so instead of trying to embarrass the man that embarrassed you maybe take some accountability.
this how delusional i am
I think publicly stating in a video for your fan base to go spread hate because you lost is mad!. You got a fat ass check but your ego hurts so badly you can't see the positives. No one was upset with you, your fans love you and would of thought you won, until you started trying to use them to spread hate. This is petty and not a good look.
I watched the fight a couple times over, I am really confused. If Furry was supposed to be a lot better better. And KSI was doing really well, like I am so confused. And Furry was doing on the clinching be leaning his weight on him, like why on Earth did KSI lose?
man this is HARD COPE ngl
I think KSI is going to start bringing the Sidemen popularity down due to his ego.
Damn dude your petty
The clip of you swinging the sledgehammer was evidence enough to see you didn't dig deep enough in your training, just going thru the motions, weak as piss. You can't make up a style and think you can best a proven style 😂😂 ridiculous 😂😂
i mean it wasnt like tommy destroyed him, ksi should be hapy he performed way better than jake, and it could have easily been a draw and in my opnion should have.
Honestly I was on board with everything you said except the bashing your brother. Uncalled for and not cool. Even if what you said is true, your goal STILL should always be to lift your little brother up and help and support him.
I don’t give a flying fuck y’all can call me a KSI meat rider but he got robbed. Tommy fury looked like a fucking child and fought like a bitch. The ref wallet way too much fly
Me personally i think you did win the fight, it’s just the reaction afterwards. I mainly just think that people are on tommy’s side because they’re a little delusional, but you still shouldn’t berate the “official” winner. Just take it 👍
He’s our workhorse
Everyone has good times, everyone has bad times, this will go on for a smol while of ppl not respecting u anymore, but to get that respect back man u just gotta be real, u thought u would win and u lost, it happens yk, just dont look back at it and try to be a good dude then ppl might forgive u
Fancy having a ego so fragile. You tell your immature fans to berate  Tommy for no reason what so ever. Childish
they probly playin faves to be honest
yall need to chill..its understandable why he may LOOK salty but its also very understandable why he thinks like this after a first loss .I don't want any hate for anyone ..not even KSI or Tomy .:c
Womp womp
Im still dead after the lambo entrance
I am getting real strong “i woke up and coughed 3 times “ vibes
Just take the L man
Who did you sacrifice when you sold your soul
wtf are you doing
Ksi, it would have been a bit worse if you won. Your ego would be going high that you would not have proper control over it, and then that would lead to worse situations later.
What the 😳
Loser
We all know that you should of win that bro
I mean he is wrong for this shit but Tommy fury is damn near doing the same thing so it’s both of them tbh
Sooky baba, uh oh stinky.
L fight and bigger L response. At least you didn't get rocked on ppv but that match was pain to witness, damn near had more holds than punches landed
A wise man once said “ You absolutely suck “
you're such a baby lmao
Bro cmon, you jumped around like a starfish for 6rnds and expected to win.
Kinda dissapointed with this vid. Being a sore loser isn't the way
Look as much as I love ksi this is a cry me a river moment like no one wants to accept a lost but if you lose you have to that's the proper way of doing it take it learn from it and improve not do this there is no excuse
Yeah, you lost. Take the L like a grown man and move on with your life
He's acting like logan paul after the fight
JJ, you're a youtuber, not a professional boxer, you did well in all the other fights.
Okay. All u guys in the comments are so oblivious to what he's going through. When u have a mindset like JJ's its hard to take a loss that u know u won. None of of u know or can comprehend that and when one of u says "What kind of role model are u?" everyone follows. I bet half of u don't know what your saying. We all know that jj performed better and how he took the loss would be like how any of you would have taken it. SH IT. Don't try and lie either. - Also all of u are gonna give me hate but again only half of u will look into the replies and not read any of this and even after u read it most of you still wont understand. So just read it and if u dont understand just SHUSH
Delusional man baby. What's shameful are your actions following the fight as well as in this video. You can see the desperation as you try to disparage Fury's character to somehow repair your broken ego. You have embarrassed yourself sorely and the comments on this video show that.
Damm u really hate your opponents lol
It wasn't as obvious as your stating the fight was so absurdly close it's ridiculous and it truly depends on what of the 4 scoring criteria was considered most important by those judges in your fight to act as if u won all 4 criteria by far is in my mind delusional u won 2 and he won 2 and one was mixed depending on angles I'd give it to u considering main damage and aggression should be the strongest main criteria but ring generalship and defense does count as well and u Def lost those two especially defense so you were VERY close no matter what anyone says but outright u won no matter what disagree
crazy how his whole fanbase just switches up when he cops an L.
Shame haha
This is the first time I've seen jj fuming this bad on a fight. do better
Remember when he dissed logan 😂 for appealing!? 😂😂 ..
I feel the way you handled stuff was a bit inappropriate. Take the loss, argue your case, make a good public impression, and people will agree with you.   At the same time, I do agree. I’ve watched the fight many times. 18 times, he breaks the rules by bashing you over the back of the head. And in terms of who won what round: I’d give 1, 2, and 3 to you; 4 and 5 were a bit divided; 6 was a solid one for Tommy. But the points deduction and decisions feel like it should’ve swayed in your favour.
This is why we love ksi
this is the most hate I have seen on a JJ's video
I just hate being on the other side. Listen if u say "i didnt want to make this video" just dont do it. Media is a hostile reality
Berate him? Seriously JJ, just take the loss.✋
He isn't an "untalented nerd". He's grown up and worked hard and became a man. Too bad this man also happens to be a child at heart.  He is trying to pain this picture of "Oh I'm so talentless and i did this much" while at the same time saying "I'm more talented i should have won", and its only working against him. This must be the LEGACY he's so proud of.
ksi is just embarrassing at this point
Just take the L whining wont change anything. Keep it up bro.
Maaaaaaajor major insecurity my guy
I absolutely love seeing these comments DRAG KSI 😂😂
jj used the darvo response because he: D-denied that he lost this fight A-he attacked tomy furry R-he reversed victim offender V-he became the victim in hes argument O-then made it seem that tomy furry is the offender this response is commonly used in narcissists
It sucks to see what for person ksi have become. He lost not only in boxing but he also lost his pride and his manhood
Ksi won that fight  I stayed home to watch it with my brother and I don't Tommy and I watch it and every round maybe 1 round and the 1 point deduction should have done it so lsi wins Tommy furry loses
Honestly.. You didn’t fight, you were like a clown jumping around trying to get a lucky shot. And you must be blind because you didn’t see how many times you gave tommy back hits, and how much you took advantage of that stupid refinery, bunching while clinching.  Tommy deserve the win because he was boxing.  You weren’t.. Be a man and take your loss and say I’ll be better next time.
Bro JJ, stop trying to make Tommy look bad so u look better, it’s kinda sad and manipulative :/
This is what happens when your (fore)head becomes to big.
No way he was lecturing Deji about being humble in defeat lmao
Still lost 😂
This is crazy. I still remember when JJ made fun of Logan for the exact same thing... Now he's doing it..
Laughing At: KSI
Cøcåine is one hell of a drug. You should just congratulate Tommy and move on with your life and promote your next fight. Idk why you you can't just be a good guy about it, I know it's not the easy path but its the one we wanted.
What a big baby
nah this video was fine up untill you just dissed tommy fury about the pregnancy's and telling us to hate on him more its one of the pettiest things ive seen from ksi since wade plem.
just take the L and move on blud him making a video after months just to complain and fuel his ego ugh. m not a hater but am not oblivious to a person who is ego centric and only cares when things go their way.
JJ took an L with the loss. But he took an even bigger L with this video.
gg bro
Its okay . Take the L and just delete this video. Not a good take.
Nah uploading videos to this channel wasn't a part of your life for the past year you just come every few weeks opens reddit and leave so YouTube isn't a part of your life anymore.
JJ i think you might now realize by looking at your comment section that this ain't it man. Even if the call seems unfair or actually is, at some point you gotta move on man. I've been a fan since 2013 so I honestly wish you understand you being a prick rn.
Jj this Ain't it
It’s always your own people that want to see you down and kick you down to your low self. Which is disgusting to me. This is Reason why y’all don’t have nothing going for yourselves now. Spreading negativity always goes around to bite you on the ass one day. You did Good KSI. I know you won. It’s negative ppl don’t want you to won but hate you that’s all.
I love jj but his ego is so large that he cant accept a defeat. It was a close match but dont be a sore loser just take the loss and learn from it and get even better than you are
I’m gonna shock the world
Whether he won or lost, being this salty, bringing up family, and then pushing his audience to berate Tommy as a reaction to losing one fight is so terribly petty. You said it yourself, you hung with him, you were able to match him, why isn’t that enough? Why do you then have to go and bring up personal matters which you most likely know nothing about and push your audience to harass him? It’s one loss, take it as a lesson and move forward, you’re 30 years old ffs.
Absolute cringe, looks like you got that bandanna a little too tight 😂😂
sounds like bro wants a rematch ngtl
Bruhhh 😂😂😂 the Copium is of the charts
You lost. Take it as a lesson and act like an actual adult
This is pathetic
This loss was way overdue, needed to be humbled and obviously still isn’t. He’s crushed finally, hard to believe he had so many fans to begin with, definitely all chavs
Why does ksi have fans that don’t like him it’s all confusing me can someone just explain it all to me
you both lost
Don't be a pussy okay fight again round 2 or fight  jake paul
KSI wants to be taken seriously yet keeps referring to himself as a “nerd”, hate the victim mentality
What a baby
Youve been boxing this long and still throw punches like that?. Lol. 😅
I respect KSIs come up from the fifa days but the salt is real 🧂
JJ don’t be a little a bitch and accept the loss
JJ you just went after a mans kid and wife, and asked your fans to harass him. Whatever respect you think anyone with a brain has after watching this video, is gone.
Success often leads to arrogance, and arrogance to failure. Don't be arrogant, drop the ego, be objective
It was staged i could feel it
Disliked 👎 Unsubscribed 🚫 Do not recommend channel ❌
A video about boxing but you are criticizing his personal life? this is a new low.
I understand the hate, but holy shit, the man has some decent freaking points. There's a lot of money behind these corporations and families that can't lose their prestige. What a laughing stock Tommy AND Tyson AAAND their father would be if he hadn't won. You don't think after he didn't get to knock him out, they didn't have a backup plan?
If you can’t support him then go watch someone else you don’t deserve to watch him if you can’t support him I want to see you lot try and do what ksi did
Ksi u think I can fight you am 14 ND 6,5
You are pathetic in every category.
idk what these guys are saying, been watching sidemen for like 10 years and JJ is still the same person, idk what these guys are on about roasting the way he acted to losing lmao
to all the people who are saying KSI was their idol and how they were a fan, just remember that we shouldn't be idolizing anyone but Allah (God) [or if you don't believe in God then that's fine, i can't control that, but it's still not good to idolize anyone bc they could turn out to be egotistical narcs like KSI]
honestly I only just watched this video now bc of all that backlash, and don't think what he said is that bad tbh. like only the fans going after tommy stuff is actually really bad the rest is valid
Well after watching this video I’m unsubscribing. You don’t tell your fans to harass someone because of a loss. I’m just tired of watching an immature 30 year old man child complain.
Ksi won he threw more jabs
I used to like KSI when he was doing his own thing before all this YouTube boxing started but after I saw how much ego he has developed after his first win against JW, I started to not like him as much, KSI you’re 31 and going into 32 this upcoming year, stop thinking you’re on the same level as a professional fighter, you’re not man
Yeah I'm out. I appreciate the laughs, JJ, but this is some petty bullshittery right here. Oy vey.
LSI
Hahahahahhaahahaha
i thought he meant he lost nnn lol
FUN FACT: having your own team tell you to clinch on purpose isnt the same as boxing dont call urself a boxer until you learn the basics
Womp womp.
jesus stop crying already, u think ur fight is the only close fight to ever happend? take the L and shut tf up
I notice you didnt show any clips of you hugging for 95%  of the match or wild swinging digs. Clown
Sometimes you do everything right and still loose
Y'all people can go cry about it. You dont have to actually do it. Its not like he's paying you. Dudes upset and he said something
You are close to 30yrs bro grow the F up already! This is Fckin embarrassing.
Fuck you all! Just because he believes in himself and his potential you guys are being shit to him?? He is accepting the loss like a true man. So don't be like this. Everyone is hating ksi for absolutely no fucking reason man. You people need help man. Also, go watch that fight once more to see who really won. He is the real winner. He was robbed just as ngannu in his fight with tyson fury.
Wow. I thought he was a bad winner after he was so obsessed with bashing Weller after the fight (but weirdly licking Logan's arse ring), but i never imagined what a shit loser he'd be lol.
womp womp
I don't know what you're all talking about wtf. I would also be mad if even my Worse enemy thought I won the fight then being announced as a lost. This man has every right to be pissed
Used to watch ksi a lot a few years ago, came back to see this. Its honestly so sad to see how much money and fame has corrupted our JJ
yes ,you lost. Moved on.
Nah I understand that JJ “handled it like a baby”. I mean like come on though he did try so fucking hard, he felt like he deserved it. But back to the main part people criticising him have these cringy ahh anime pfp or some other shit. In conclusion, JJ does not give a shit what you have commented, good day.
7:00 🕖  That’s when he loses.
So much for dissing deji😂😂 waste man waffle don't worry there is still OF. Bro
Ksi is the biggest sellout of the 21st century
Now I’m older, I understand what Deji was saying about KSI being egoistical, he’s also a master manipulator to twist his fans opinions.
Tommy did roast KSI before the fight so he does deserve this
He made actual good pints about Tommy’s life once you have a kid your career shouldn’t end but it dies down because your travelling a lot so Tommy until he is done travelling will be there worst celebrity parent ever because he ain’t even being a parent
You loss man just accept the L  don't be another asshole
Maybe if you didn’t hug so much you might of won might but hold this loser L
This is painful to watch. Just accept the loss.
deserved the loss, now lose the ego.
To jumpy and hug to much dont think your good enough that fight was an embarrasement . Better of watching girla fight
Yes you lost lol💀
This was lame
You still talking shit about Tommy is crazy.
You Definitely had the fight Bagged bro. Tough break man. Set up a Rematch.
Nah no way he actually told his fans to go after Tommy. Thats not ok.   Its one thing to say, I don't think I lost, please review it, and give me a break down of why I did.  Its another to attack the guy personally and professionally, and ask your fans to do it too.  Thats gross.
Ksi. You lost, you talk about tommy fury hitting the back of your head but what about your grappling. It doesnt sound like this was some real reflection it sounds like some weird cope of how hard you worked and how much you think you deserved it. Get over it. You lost fair and square. It was close tho so take it like a man and improve
maybe you should start reading the comments on your own posts instead of reading Tommy Fury’s.
Hey man.
Take the L u baby or in ur case take the P
Blame the judges all you want but why come after Tommy fury because he won. Childish and unprofessional and I love JJ
Sad to see one of my favorite youtubers acting like this, childish af
Cope
I mean he lost against jake of all people ksi probably feels like a bitch losing to tommy  Which no one besides sport fans knew before the ksi fight   Tommy fury is supposedly a real fighter   But any real fighter wouldn't have fought an amateur
I bet most of you commenting on how jj has been kicked off of his pedestal   But what you guys don't realize is that this is his first loss in something he thought he was the best in   He won against the paul and he lost against someone less famous than him   To someone like ksi that is hard to deal with   People like us who can't or don't have time for such things we wouldn't understand
Man couldn't accept getting humbled hahah
What a sore loser
Jake Paul on that Olympic level
Daimn, this just confirms you've turned into a petty little bish. Even asking your fans to harrass him... Congratz on you new low🎉
Yikes..... 😬😬
Yeah, you lost, that's what happened. You're a loser and you suck at boxing.  You can not claim that you "won" that fight, that the judges "stole" it from you. Other people who claim that after a loss have at least one or two things theu did inside the ring to help back up their claims. You did nothing. You spent the entire fight desperately diving in for the clinch and holding on dear life. All this while fighting someone who would have been a nobody if it weren't for his last name.  You did nothing in that fight that makes you deserve to win it. Training hard does not mean you deserve to win. You can train as hard as you want, but of you're a terrible boxer then you're a terrible boxer, period. "Feeling" like you won the fight means nothing to anybody. I can mot believe this needs to be explained to a man who apparently had enough balls to get in to a professional boxing ring, but competitions don't care about your feelings, little girl.
I know KSI is a good man but goddamn, take your loss with grace. Atleast welcome a hit to your ego.
Ego got hurt😂 it was a draw, both yall suck
Disappointed
Good to see u back JJ you should have 100% won that fight biggest rob since gib
This 30yo man still acting childish and crying about the loss, man up fool
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into the kingdom of God."
Jj, didn't you have your children aborted? You have very little room to critique Father's on how they should raise their children. Just take the loss and move on.
That fucking fake laugh make everything worse. How the tables turned. I started hating this man. Encouraging your fanbase to harass him, who the fuck you think you are?
as a fan of JJ for many years, I was rooting for him to lose because JJ needed to be humbled. But i was NOT expecting him to take the loss like a pussy. Oh my. So disappointing. JJ should not be a role model. Take the loss as a MAN and keep it stepping. Win the next fight, just stop complaining ffs.
Been ages since the fight yet you are still upset about it and telling people to go hate on him
Yeah tommy hit u pretty hard in the head JJ if ur talking like this
Thats what happens when u tweet "iam going to shock the world"😅
K Soreloser I
u stink in boxing bro.
Damn it sucks to see how you turned out personality wise, crazy how much of a sore loser you’ve become
Haha !
tommy destroy your knowledge strength and integrity
Why did you stop saying *"Astagfirrula"*😂❤
sore loser
Listen up JJ, this whole nonsense isn’t about being robbed. Sure, you most indefinitely didn’t lose but to go after a man’s family like that isn’t cool bro. Stop trying to get the result overturned. If they’re not going to change the result, So be it, after that there is only one option left: rematch. They’ve told you to do it over and over but you don’t listen, get back nigga, I said get back! Bro, you said you were doing this for legacy but now with this one video you’ve gone ahead and just stained it, remember why you did all of this, you didn’t have to get up every day in the morning and train and handle everything going on with Misfits but you chose to, for legacy. Remember why you started
KSI dude, I really do love your content. Your content has made a lot of people laugh and in my view made a lot of people happy.  However as much as I did want you to win if you lost, you lost. The way you acted after the fight was petty, and even now you’re in denial and still going at it.  You’re even asking your fans to harass Tommy. As much as I don’t like him no one deserves to be harassed.  It’s clear he won and it’s clear he was more of a man than you were here.  You need to do better, you really do. I’m sorry dude but I can’t support your actions in this case. I know my comment isn’t that big, I am still a fan of you but I feel my trust and stuff about you have shifted heavily after the fight.  It’s kind of upsetting this. I wanted you to win but as the result stands this is the way it has to be.  Take the loss, grow from it, train harder and be smarter and fight him again in the future if he allows it. The way you’re acting you won’t even get a chance to fight him again.  I always got your back JJ but please use this as a way to learn and grow if you can.  Much love. ❤
Just unsubscribed
Yeah… JJ I ain’t gonna lie man… I’ll be a fan of you still… because this is your first offense… and yeah, I PERSONALLY DO think you won the fight… But come on man…  That’s a bad move…  I’m not for harassment like that.  I’m sorry.  You got to know that’s a horrendous move.
Ksi i drink the red prime
JJ took being pathetic to a new level…he even involved his family because he LOST. The FACT he even wants his fans to harass Tommy is just….oh my- he has truly took his downfall, looks like it’ll begin now..Deji was always right.
This is a truly embarrassing video. Commenting on a man's family matters just cos you can't take the L. Smh.
This isn’t a good look man. When all of your fans are here in the comments pretty much having the same opinion that this video makes you look like a narcissist and a sore loser. I get that you worked hard to win that fight but in the end you didn’t win, you can’t always win. It might be time to take a good hard look in the mirror because this video just wasn’t it.
Ksi, you’ve got the money, you’ve got the success. You’ve probably now realised that money doesn’t bring happiness. It’s now time to focus on losing your ego.
At this point I believe little kids are complaining about Ksi in the comments cause no one who claims to be here from the beginning would be acting up over something so stupid, we all have shit on Jake, Dax, Logan, wassabi, rice gum, joe, and back then y’all never cared if y’all took it too far with the harass, or if their families and personal lives got exposed, but when this guy has been looked down on by friends, fanbase, and social media about him having no chance against Tommy, and he some how’s made Tommy look like shit, did probably more than what Tommy did, for some reason he loses when at the very least should’ve been a draw, and all he says it’s to remind Tommy he did not won that fight,  and y’all acting like this guy it’s Hitler or something… are y’all good? This guy does so much to make sure to give his best on all he does, his a human who granted will not be perfect but for y’all to be crying like little girls over this it’s stupid specially when he just said it partially cause he saw people was alr letting Tommy know he didn’t win, it’s like y’all okay with harassing but when y’all are told to keep the trolling y’all get offended, zero logic
JJ, I’ve been a fan of you for years. You are funny, you work hard, you keep us entertained, but you took an L here man. And you handled it like a complete wuss. Tommy beat you man, take the loss like a man. Squash the beef, do better.
The entitlement he has to say life isn’t fair when this guy hit to jackpot on life and he loses a fight and then he starts throwing a massive tantrum thinking his feelings determine the win. I’ve watched him for 4 years coming up to 5, but this past year I felt he’s really degraded a ton as a person
When Jake Paul loses: don’t judge me by wins judge me by my loses When KSI loses:The judges man I got robbed this was bs like you did not win you lost take it like a champ 😂🤣
U should make Muhammad Ali prime..m
Yes you lost.....After fight, did you heard judges verdict ?!?!
Ive lost my respect for you jj grow up u lost low blows man low blows
This is pathetic
Ksi go back to harassing 11 year old girls
Yeah. Unsubscribe from me.
Damn, not even a "Merry Christmas" 😂 bro mad 💀
boringgggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
How can this guy think he won? Such a clown jumping around like a 🐵
One word to describe this video “cope”
Every influencer meets their day where they’re stuck in a situation and have the choice to be the example for good morals and personality, or to just be emotional and display their narcissism
You lost accept it
Even though the fight between ksi and tommy fury was ass and I believe that it should've been a draw, he was still viewed as a winner by a lot of people. This video is literally just him bawling like a child. Ksi if you do read this, this video is a shit-stain on your legacy, if anything you owe fury an apology for telling your fanbase to outwardly harass him whenever they see him. What an absolute L.
Bros never gonna fight Jake Paul
Ksi can u make a 2L glow berry bottle
L
Crybaby
yes i believe ksi won, but i dont think jj should have posted this video, yes you can post a video about your mental health but focusing on what he's talking about it comes off egotistical and arrogant now i dont think its time to pull out the pitchforks or anything and unsubscribe but just give JJ criticism not hate, this video wasnt gonna change anybody's outlook on the fight most of us would still think you won or tommy won it happened and is in the past it shouldve been left there and not have had a rant about how everybody thinks you won the fight or how you're better than tommy fury, you're one of my favorite youtubers ksi and as i aint harsh as most other commenters tbh this wasnt the right move bro.  hope you can take some time too get in a better headspace JJ ❤  i now finished the full video, ksi its not ok to tell people to attack tommy fury and berate him if you seem him in real life its very dishonorable, i thought we were better than this bro
You and Tommy suck
Good to have u back bro
Cringe
When you harrassed Logan, it was funny and justified because Logan was, and continues to be, a massive prick (Nice job on the partnership btw xo).  What did Tommy do to deserve this? His mission was to show people that YouTube boxers are frauds and a waste of time. Looks to me, and a lot of your former fans, that he did that regardless of his boxing. To quote you in a previous chapter of your life ''You're making a mockery of this sport''.
Is this a joke bro
stay mad, u lost, stop crying abt it
I bet if you and Jake Paul had fought right after your 2nd fight with Logan shit would be going better right now, win or loss.
i always knew he was kinda a dickhead but damn this was a hard watch
so i thought about something why does ksi kinda looks like ambutukam?
Before watching I read the comments and thought "Why so much hate?" Half way through I was still wondering why it just seemed like he was explaining why he was on break and the appeal. Honestly watching the fight I still thought JJ won. HOWEVER, I assume all the hate if from him going too far on Tommy? Attacking him for not being there for the baby being born and being at the club without the Ms? Gotta agree he may have went a little far, and we all should humble JJ on that part. Is there something else I missed tho? Seems like y'all wanna cancel him or sum. If I put myself in JJ's shoes I'd be talking about how I should've won too. I dont think he should get hate for that.
hahahahahha
JJ just let it slide man, you lost, it doesnt matter if you think you didnt, it doesnt matter if we think you didnt, at the end of the day its the judges who ruled the match as a loss for you and that's it. ALOT of us have been watching you since the beginning and i think i can speak for most of us that we are done with all this ego tripping, abnoxious, big mouthing crap you have been displaying eversince you won against Weller. You proved you can hang in the sport but for the love of all that's good... your elbow knockout loss was the beginning of the end. I'm in no position to tell you what to do or what not to do but if i could give you some advice, just let it slide. Take a break, focus on rebuilding yourself and your content, focus on Prime and let the boxing thing go man. You are losing waaaay more than just a match with this bs...
This was embarrassing. Very immature.
does anyone know the dislikes on this video?
All his 2019 talks from beating logan coming to him now huh petty mf
JJ dont be baby
Now I’m older, I understand what Deji was saying about KSI being egoistical, he’s also a master manipulator to twist his fans opinions.
It sucks when you realize one of your idols turn out to just be a narcissistic pathetic asshole, I’ve been watching you since I was 13, whenever someone mentioned abt my heroes you were always on the list. You were the one that taught me when we are close to giving up, think of a word to keep striving for like LEGACY,I feel like such a massive L now, but the most important
am so glad you guys finally have opened your eyes to see how much he changed after selling out.
Hahaha you lost. Laa huu za her
In the bible in proverbs it talks about being careful of who you surround yourself with. JJ becoming more like Logan. Shits sad.
It's not about winning or losing a boxing match, it's all about winning life. And huge respect to KSI for fulfilling this. Congratulations KSI...
tommy said he was gonna knockout ksi ksi said he was gonna knockout tommy neither of them did what they said so they both should hold the L
Allowing your ego to consume you can lead to destructive consequences. It blinds you to your own faults and prevents you from learning and growing. It's important to remember that losing doesn't justify attacking others, as it only perpetuates a cycle of negativity. Instead, focus on self-reflection, empathy, and fostering a culture of constructive dialogue. You can rise above your ego and create a more compassionate and understanding world, you claim your name stands for Knowledge, Strength, and Integrity, you’re showing none of these qualities, I’m an og follower of yours, followed you since fifa days, seeing what you’ve become is disappointing I can’t say I have any respect for you and what you’ve become, I wish I was in your position, not the money part but that would be nice but if I had the following you had, I know for a fact I wouldn’t act like this, rather teach my followers that it is what is and you gotta take it on the chin and move on, you’re a fully grown man, you can’t be doing this shit on the internet especially when majority of your followers are children, like I said in the start of this comment, what you’re doing can and will lead to destructive consequences.
Just take the L man stop wiping
Im here to follow ksi advice....  KSI....you lost, you didnt win the fight. Remember when you lost against tommy fury and then acted like a child? You continue to ruin every video you are in. I cant even watch sidemen because i dont want to watch a really good video of you crying. You lost the fight almost as bad as you lost your hairline. Youre a joke in everything you do this fight was a perfect metaphor of this  you are a loser.  This is what you want us to say to tommy so i hope your able to hear it yourself
This is what happens when you dont face any real difficulty in life.  You have no humility and rage like a kid at the old age of 30
Dam jj 😮
at least tommy kept his kids
Fuckin’ manchild.
Wow bad looser and salty .
Not watching this loser anymore
Jj please fight jake paul
Felt u won jj
KSI should have won that game was rigged
🤣🤣🤣🤣 What a joke of a video this was hahahaha
Bro, all those punches to the back of the head must have shaken something lose up there. This response was a big yikes from me dawg. The fight wasn't what shocked the world, this response did. Whoever approved for you to upload this video really should have told you off because this came off as incredibly petty and egocentric. Be better. I know you can do that.
P.s. Saw your spar with IshowSpeed and it was pathetic, holding and punching without someone observing to warn or break you from it is really cheap, you were clearly trying to hurt and knock him down, I'm one to talk, but learn how to outbox properly and keep the spar technical so you both learn something
You lost cause you weren't engaging in the fight, you tried and failed to rack up points, learn basic boxing before you try anything unorthodox
Holy shit lost so much respect for KSI. True test of a man is to see how one reacts when they lose. That is when you see their true colors hiding underneath. What a horrible person you are KSI. To advocate the idea of using your influence to annoy, hurt, embarass, and invalidate someone because you lost by rules you and him both agreed upon. You are quick to say you "won" against Logan Paul even though judges decided that, but all of a sudden who "cares" about the judges? Get out of here.
I don't understand why the comments are so crazy. You didn't say anything out of pocket
When will we see ksi again? he's been crying since november, its time to move on
bro nah come on
JJ come on man, a loss is a loss.
KSI bringing up Tommy Fury's family is pathetic asf
JJ showed weakness, he is famous, people see his childish reaction and made fun, etc, that’s not surprising if we think about it, don’t embarrass yourself again man….that’s sad😕
Damn i thought he was gon accept it
Bro really needs to get away from Logan Paul. This is a bad look.
Bro is getting violated in the YouTube comment section😂
Its so tragic that you're being so salty
I thought you lost. You grabbed ever 5 seconds. In a professional match, you would of had a point a deduction, and if you continued after that you would of been DQ. You fight like a chihuahua. You are all bark. Its always an excuse with you.
Sack your publicist team 😂 The fact he filmed this and his team just said yeah its great lets upload it is just crazy.
This is embarrassing man. You don’t have a single ounce of humility in your body. Learn how to take a loss.
Hey Siri play the rainbow prime
I hope that YouTube demonetize all his channels until he calms down and acts like a man. His ego is so fragile because sideman has truly become a Yesman crew for him.
Damn
“Tommy is fighting a retired old boxer” how bout go fight Jake Paul then Ksi? Stop talking about who people are fighting if you can’t even man up and fight someone yourself lmao
I mean I thought he won fuck the haters
What's this? Organized bullying provocateur?
Hard work and self belief, and then u ruin it by being a whining egotistical person, all things that the skinny nerd Jj wasn’t, when he was actually likeable.
Ksi thinks he’s really above everyone else he’s so deluded and only has yes men around him.
I’ve been watching u since race to division 1 and tbh ur ego is ruining your legacy u lost take the L. In my opinion the Logan decision was a lot more iffy compared to tommys win so the fact ur crying this much when u clowned on Logan for appealing the decision is extremely hypocritical.
bla bla excuses.
Yo KSI i just had the opportunity to get some prime finally I bought 4 different kinds and wow I didn't expect it to be so sweet good job it's to sweet for me so I added water and I like it so much I will be buying a lot more
Damn man, so much hate😧
Even seeing this video, I’m still your long lasting fan ❤  This is just a very tough time, but it will pass.  Love from America 🇺🇸
Grow up and take the loss like a man. So what? Wow you lost a boxing match to a pro boxer. Just stop whining, all this time you've spent winging, you could've been at the gym, you could've been training, you coulda been boxing. If you wanna take a break, then fine, thats your choice. But you cannot ask your fans to harass a guy because you can't handle a loss.
Im done with this guy
Lost? Lost your cred?
Its alr because you better lookin than him
Yo, South Park just roasted your ass
You become a just youtuber When you lose. And a A professional boxer when you win. What a hypocrite you are
Sore a$$ loser bruv, cringe on another lvl
You lost man up
https://youtu.be/4Zk0Y9Esg4k?si=XXKenKK5CfxrU1Mh
U Neva win u know that.
Deji is the more respectable brother
Hello. I write to inform you, (unless you already know), the American Hip-Hop artist Dave East was pepper sprayed by french supremacist Montreal police officers because he spoke to them in English. I urge you to look into this. There is a long history of English speaking Black Canadians/Afro-Carribean Canadians living in Quebec being assaulted by white french speaking Montreal police officers. Again, there exists a long, ugly history where many English speaking black-Canadians/Afro-Carribean Canadians have suffered similar police brutality at the hands of french supremacist Montreal/Quebec police. This is a case where an innocent English speaking African American artist was assaulted by white french speaking Montreal police officers. These white, french speaking police officers exhibited an open, aggressive french supremacist bias against English speaking black people. These cases have been documented for decades n Canada. Once again, I hope you respond. Regards.
Sorry KSI, recently I have joked about your forehead. (Now my forehead feels a little bigger than before)
Black Epic Sax Guy
yeah but tommys the goat tho
Bro it’s not that serious cuz you are NOT a boxer 😭 you are not a real boxer. You are not highly skilled yet. Nothing to bring yourself down about , cuz you are not a boxer and you are not a pro boxer. You lost to someone who is a boxer how can you feel bad 😂 even if you won lowkey means nothing cuz this isn’t real boxing big dawg. The guys you fight before tommy weren’t real boxers either so you can’t hype yourself up that much like your Mike Tyson or Ali. You haven’t fought a real opponent yet. Tommy is a real boxer but even he isn’t elite
Sorry sir, you forgot to wear your 🤡 mask
bro narcissist and rage like a kid😂😂😂 grow up bro
DOSENT MATTER ! If you lose . You tried your best 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Tommy Retired this guy
just got the glowberry prime from a morrisons daily
ay bro just take this loss and do better bro cuz what im hearing is egoist mentality. like please dont act like a bich bro
Well reading through the comment section its pretty clear everyones mad about ksi telling his fans to make fun of tommy but imo he was just foolin around  Also the fight was realistically a draw. I understand ksi trained hard and I believe him sometimes its best to just take a step backwards to keep movin forward (Hasbulla is goated doe 🐐)
Your ego is bigger than your forehead man..
Has anyone seen south park (not suitable for children)😂
Ksi i want more videos remember you are not just a boxer
If ksi was white yall wouldn't be on his ass like this
Its great that you are spending time with family , you will treasure it for life
Petition for JJ to show us more of Buu his cat because we have never seen a lot of Neo and Morpheus his hamsters so petition for JJ to show us more of Buu
This video should be EXCUSES of a sore Loser.
This man sounds like he’s sold his sold
Ksi is bald?
Its so nice to see you strong:)cannot wait for your new ideas.to see you happy is my happines
Enjoy your life and dont cry
You do nothing you was only crying dont be a bitch😂😂😂
Ksi dont be a fucking bitch it is sad 🤡🤡🤡😂
Cope
It’s one thing to complain about the judges call to an extent, but when he started whining about how much this emotionally hurtled him, started insulting Tommy Fury’s career, for just being himself, and his personal life that JJ knows jack shit about. And then egg on his fans to berate and hate spam Tommy’s socials, That’s when all sympathy went out the window.   May KSI’s have many more Ls to come
It’s a shame I don’t see ksi boxing ability as much as I hate to say it he’s not technically orientated watching him fight looks out of place kinda not coming from a bad place it’s just kinda hard to watch let’s take Francis iguanu when he fought Tyson fury he was way more technically advanced and he doesn’t fight boxing switching stances and from southpaw to orthodox and shit also coming from the MMA doesn’t help but he’s only had months to train in an area where is taxing and different to how u usually fight in a cage and outboxes Tyson the change here is ksi doesn’t have that for the sport and he thinks he does who’s gonna tell him
yes you did loses don.t be a bitch ok
Ksi is now becoming young logan Paul
UPLOAD MAN
Noooo jj… don’t trash ur opponents… don’t be sore
Why does Ksi fight like a bitch, the guy hopping around like he is doing some belly dancing 💃
Damn mn you’ve changed bro 😢
Jj, i know you didnt
this fight was a needed loss for his future
Please please fight Jake Paul
that fight was arse
“So I lost” lost everyone’s respect
your "biggest hater"  is your business partner soo.. that`s obviosly also an overstatement.
you`ve lost from a better boxer, voted by the judges you guys paid for. I`m glad your career is over, finally stopped taking money from real boxers.
wow, where is the dislike button when you need it.
From an ego person to idk what
How can someone say that they are getting off yt and treating their self and feel much better and then come back and still be salty .
Crazy attack video 😂😂 who cares both y’all say gg and wait for appeal 😂😂
The comments💀
so.... yeah
This guy is at the max level of coping
sore lser
KSI I usually like your stuff but this is sad coping.
Hold this L real quick you deserve it lmao
He’s talking about all the amazing things he’s done, quit focusing on something you gave you 100% on but came out on bottom. You tried and it failed, that sucks but just own it and move on.
Always thought you were a twat, looks like i was right
The boxing world needs a refresh on how it’s scored
stop crying bro you lost
Imagine 😂😂😂😂😂
i would have still seen you as the winner if you just took the fucking L and said that youll try even harder from now on but no instead you send your audience to target harass someone and by definition start cyberbullying the other guy on a grand scale. you maybe didnt lose the fight ksi, but you LOST. big time.
This man really just spoke about another man's child and family structure just because he lost a boxing match,  then gets his fans (who are probably immature kids) to harass the guy and his family...what a weirdo
😂😂😂😂
The wound is still fresh he was proud of what he did. Let him hurt. Not a good response but im sure he can understand everyones point of view. In reality he doesnt need to care im sure we all know that.
Dd
Want us to produce sidemen soap bars? Hit us up champ! Peace!
You definitely won it, end of!
U lost Ksi u don’t want it to come down to the judges then be a better boxer and end it before
I love you JJ but you gotta learn when to accept a loss
Sad to see this
Soo you’re just gonna ignore the majority of people who actually watch boxing say you lost
Even when u lost JJ I still supported you but this is horrible I don’t know what happend to u the JJ I used to like was the one who inspired millions I was feelings depressed when u lost for u and claimed it was robbery and said it was robbery until the real scores came out Tommy one fair and square and for you to tell people to harass him is beyond sad I’m praying u come back from this but for now I cannot support u
I like how the most liked comments on this video are from the KSI mob and not actual KSI fans.
Doing star jumps around the ring isn't boxing. You didn't come to fight and you lost.
I think I remember a question on some sort of media platform after the Ksi Logan fight. It asked “Who would take a loss better, KSI or Logan?” I was very surprised to see KSI as the person people chose, cause this man is immature as shit
Shut jake up then retire. Viddal v Jake would be too mean against Jake lol. You both are the same in levels. Do it
Damn you taking this loss like a serious bitch 😂
Cope
And he is gone again
L Ksi
Just upload again we dont want your excuses
PLAY DBL
Urrr gay
bro talking about how much he has trained etc and then he says tommy beat a useless youtuber THIS GUY IS MAD
i liked KSI a lot but i think he sold his soul to the devil. all his views are clouded and biased and i get why but its sad
jj making fun of jake paul and logan for crying after losing a fight and now jj doing the same >D lost a lot of respect tbh
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAGAHAHAHA
Not trying to defend the “being a sore loser” thing but I saw the fight with my dad we both tought KSI won that. However, I would have just low key accepted the decision as it wasn’t like a full domination, they were really close. It could’ve been better to just stay as the people’s champ.
Prime sauer
Damn it JJ, I literally just came here from X after defending you to some dweeb. Turns out I had to apologize because that dweeb was right. To be clear, I also thought you won but hey I’m not judge so my opinion is irrelevant. But damn it, you had to mention his wife and child? Regardless of what he’s doing in those clips his children and wife have nothing to do with you or the fight? Grow tf up. Now what if he turned around and said some things about your family. The rest of world knows your family issues because you put them online for views. Now your doing the same thing with someone else’s family. This is disgraceful. Take another multiple month break and maybe goto some therapy and learn to control the words coming out of your mouth. The even worst part is, either you or your editor watched this back in editing and still thought this was okay. Either that person needs fired or you need help. ✌🏼
LSI
Youre the winner in the eyes of your real fans jj.
Cry
How about you check your own comments.
The end of my respect for you and not to mention, I think you just put a foot in the grave. I truly expected that you'd be a better man than this.
Take the L like a real man ffs.
L VIDEO , L MOVE KSI .. not cool of you to Encourage others   Harassing tommy online … L KSI
Dawg I lost mad respect for u I get that u trained hard but u literally were doin a huggin match(none of y’all boxed very well in my opinion)
"Life isn't fair" - said the man who simply lost a small game. Ever think of what cancer patient families have to go through? I know how much effort he put in, but damn, I've really lost a ton of respect for JJ. The game's the game man..
People telling him to accept defeat is ridiculous 😂😂  Let him say his mind No one should be bent to agree to your opinion   If he thinks he won let him be.
Subscribe for eafc mobile highlights
Bro Ksi you won. If he does not rematch then he’s scared
Bro's scared to post more videos
Wait this was a boxing match? I thought it was sensual pron video? 🤷‍♂️...
Box more bro, dont hate bro bro
If you had taken the loss like a real man you mightve been viewed as a winner still. This is wild man
I’m so glad JJ’s fans aren’t willing to sugar coat things. Reading the comments and seeing how no one wants to stand with him in this situation is so heart warming. This weaponization is absolutely vile and honestly JJ if you read this you should take note you lost more than the fight, but you’ve lost the trust of many fans
Big up JJ! These comments kinda ruthless and I get where some of em are coming from, but I loved this vid. Thought you kept it real like you always do with ur fans. Glad u took some time for urself. Been watching since highschool and Imma keep watching
You can't win it all just ask your forehead
Should of been a draw at the worst
Its a shame truly. Years of being a subscriber just to have it end like that
W ksi
We still need an Anne Marie try not to laugh
TO be honest, its not a fight to argue about the result. It was garbage all around.
Dude don’t ever leave like that anymore
ofc the mma guys are gonna pick ksi
these fake fans are being annoying asf, i’m true British and over here we stay loyal and instead of nit picking a video, support KSI because he obviously won, you saw how scared Tyson looked at the end
Honestly just fight Jake paul mate where are you waiting for
You lost you bum HAHAHAHAHAHA
i cannot lose but i lost my boxing so whack i was soft dont tell me he's better he's not i spar with demons yeah what
You a true Hero JJ,fcuk what these haters say,you a true inspiration. Keep that great legacy running high
Bro fell off
Come on man 🤌
Why is JJ such a sore loser oh my
#Dejisbrother
Just take the loss like a man. And stop crying
Coz you was in his home town bro you was never gonna win on points unless it was clear you had to ko him to win simple 🤷🏾
my man disappeared again.
Everyone in this comment section clearly hasn’t seen the video and are just hating like seriously wtf
Why do you laugh like that after every sentence ?   The cope in this video is insane.
KSI S.T.F.U YOU AINT WIN SH*T
Ksi is a sore loser and should just accept that he really didn't beat Tommy fury
Nahh i love you Brother k s i ❤
Lowkey I still think he got robbed but that’s just me
Look at the comments!! no one thought you won
You're a poor mans Jake Paul
You lost little boy lol stop crying
copium
ksi More like (joke) ky-
Why is he attacked by his own fans. One loss showed you who you really are, snakes.
Dude you actually didn't show anything special in the fight. That fight sucked. Loss or win whatever the opinion is, the fight sucked. Never buying another YouTube fighter. 😂😂😂
REMATCH WHOSE WITH ME
This guy was born on the same day as mine *19/06/12* ksi i love u ❤ btw not in that way
Wtf is bitch saying it’s a clear win to Tommy 😂
Let it go bruh it's over
always remember three words, man.  knowledge, strength, integrity.
Honestly can't believe the amount of haters taking this video the wrong way, honestly JJ was bang on about everything pretty much and isn't salty at all. Stay safe JJ and don;t listen to these dumbasses as they're probably all Tommy Fury fans anyway
Do yall remember when JJ was laughing at Logan Paul coping...
Ego got the best of him its really unfortunate
W reply from KSI honestly idc if he sends hate, i aint even know tommy fury so
Jake Paul didn’t think Ksi won 😂😂😂
i love u jj but u didnt deserve it u were very cocky
every time when I go to the comments all I see negative comments, I see one comment saying “you a sore loser, this man delusional” but you guys not fighting so I don’t know why guys saying that wtf it’s actually insane 💀😂
Integrity
Dude is fucking delusional
It amazes me how in other sports when teams get robbed by poor officiating they take the lost and find a way to do better. But here he isn’t talking about how to do better he is insulting the opposition. Like why direct so much hate towards the opposition if you really didn’t like something talk about the refs.
Prime for ass kicking, You Can't box m8
Yeah you are a boy.
u didnt only lost u lost like a coward
We can all agree this should of been a draw cant belive i almost spent 52$
How does this video portray sore loser, and or saltiness? He felt like he won, Stated why. and mentioned the others who support this belief. He handled it like an adult.
KSI IS A LOSER , FACE IT YOU LOST, SORE LOSER , JUST ACCEPT YOUR LOSS LIKE MAN AND MOVE FORWARD
Is KSi ducking Jake Paul? What do we think Ya"ll?
Well at least we can say that Alex isn't a clown anymore
You lost big deal, you can't always win at everything JJ, you think you're invincible, but you're not, there's a very famous saying "there's always someone bigger around the corner". At least Deji wasn't being a bitch when he lost, take a leaf from his book and grow up mate please
What a cry baby 😂😂😂 This kid is embarrassing
Well jj let my say it straight to you your becoming the thing you hate one fight has sent you backwards icl you need a longer break just to think of your actions and to try to get into tommys personal life is crazy your literally becoming jake paul before youtube boxing your drifting ib the wrong direction. We were sad that you lost but the way you reacted was just childish some shit alex wasabi would do i swr everyone you slander your becoming them and look its come back to bite you. I was and still now but  let me be real you need to pattern tf up cause your looking like the younger brother rn
You're so deluded it's embarrassing 😂
U won the fight the fight, bbc taking your win the same way they took my life, the queen is not dead, all make sense, Everything around is around the bbc news,  #freeleslie&queenelizabeth
So I've seen how much hate you've gotten since uploading this video. And I just want to say that there are those of us that still support you JJ. Dont lose heart. And If no one else has told you yet, even though you have no idea who I am, I believe in you JJ. I look forward to seeing what you do next. 💪🔥
Funniest shit I've seen all year. TY KSI. Get cancelled in peace ✌️
Deji is a far better sportsman than his brother.
You weak as hell if you can't handle a fair loss and breaking down crying over it
You ain’t won at all lol Tommy had more hits😂😂
If you were a man you wouldnt cover up your head every chance you get
Happy to just see you. Be proud of you. ❤❤❤
Fight Jake Paul now
Man got an ego from the beginning, hope this ends after this videos comment
Funny how youre in dejis place now😂
Hes become logans bitch now. Live long enough to become the thing you once hated.
If y’all was in his place I bet you’d feel the same
this i actually sad
Two weeks later and this is still the worst take I've ever seen. Acting like this as a 30 year old man is embarrassing and what respect I had is gone
this kid is still crying over it. grow tf up kid
This guy has lost his mind
You lost.
what a loser
I thought ksi won.. but, jake knocking august out proves he’s just better.
pathetic, disgusting, despicable move
Can I get a prime with my main order of COPE !
That’s what fake YouTube fame does to you. You become so delusional that you think you are the best boxer… if it was hug competition you would have got unanimous decision on that…  That wasn’t a boxing match bud get over yourself…. Also that sparring match between you and speed was cringe as fuck.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
kis ive been a fan for a long time but why you calling tommy out and his kids its not fair at all he won suck it up. Its not the end unless u make it the end.
This video is a huge L
My bro got robbed get back
Your delusional mate good job putting shit on your reputation
Would be really interesting to see the dislike counter on this video if it still existed. That’s the kind of feed back JJ needs to get humbled.
Two Africans against the world
What a BABY
Damn, didn't thought that KSI would be even worse at loosing then Logan Paul back in the day. Where is your dignity man.
What a cry baby lmao
He just had to say its time to shock the world
Lsi
nice intelligent gamer great awsome
Rematch
bro dont give up
KSI said in this video ‘I don’t care about the opinion of 3 random people’ … if he didn’t have care why did he appeal?! also they aren’t random people these are the professional judges he’s talking about… it’s just sad he can’t accept the loss & move on, can he just box Jake & then we can all finally be done with the pretend boxing lark
KSI gets robbed vs Tommy Fury then Ngannou was robbed vs Tyson Fury. Furys are over rated fighters that could never be close to any of the greats. Sadly an entire generation of boxers will have to improve in every way before we can find and test another great. There won't be any thriller in manillas or rumble in the jungles again for a long time and that's even if we even get it at all. If you brought back people like Sonny Liston or Joe Frazier they would have NO contest today.
This guy is such a sook jesus
3:53 that's so cute
i loved this dude but why is he like this he feels like the best but bro u lost to him u need to take it cmon now if u dont change it im bout to unsubscribe
Bro acting like his life is hard..
KSI chill fam, we know you worked hard but whatever it is we all knew you as a YouTuber first before any boxing. This boxing shiz was good entertainment, but don’t stop making videos cause of that fam. You’ve went from playing without a ball to making music videos. Head up brother! 😁 we all still behind you even tho you kinda lost that fight hahahah
KSI, you lost that fight my man, fair and square. That's all there is to it.
Tommy didn’t even fight like a pro that’s been boxing since he was a kid
After you second half of video , I understood who is the real loser, shame JJ shame.
We love you man, I love you, shrug it off man, thug it out, move on, you need a woman to slap you out of it or something
Used to be a fan of this guy. I’ve lost tons of respect for him and I can’t believe how low he has stooped lately especially with boxing. I unsubscribed ages ago and tbh I think most wise people should. Why would you want to support a disguisting man like this who slates people for losing.
I was afraid the weak ksi was gonna show up when you didn't upload for months, cmon man you'll be ight get it together
The difference between you and pros is professionalism, give up boxing forever if you can't take an L like a professional. It's a sport
What did canelo do when losing his 50+ streak to floyd? Not what you're doing and he had kids and family to go back to handling right after. Pretend you got a kid you gotta show an example to or something bro. Handle your ish don't let it handle you, mr. good life. You'll be ight
You care about tommy too much, move on bruh, you'll be ight.
It was definitely a close fight but Ksi obviously won
JJ is really dedicated to whatever it is he does I respect this man’s work ethic
stop being a baby and sign the contract to jake bro
Still a dub bro! I’ve been boxing for years you were robbed clear as day!  but all u can do is take it on the chin get back at it! Respect brotha big ups and big dubz 💪
They both embarrassed themselves, they both keep emberassing themselves, truly a match made in heaven, both massive ego's, both shit boxers.
This guy is 30 and stalking Tommy, basically. KSI really said, "if you see Tommy in public, berate him." and thought it was okay. Hope everyone starts realizing soon just how much of a bum KSI is.
Yo just saying, respect and all, the part where you guide hate towards Tommy’s posts and stuff is against TOS, other than that you won mate we all know it.
Lost and then threw a fit like a little kid!
I have never disliked a video before but this is just shameful. I’ve been a fan for years but this just makes it so hard to continue following you. Take some time off the internet and humble yourself please JJ.
LOGAN PAUL FRIEND ......
Fake ass fans😂
just fight jake paul already sign the contract
i feel u ma boi. u definitely should have won that fight for sure. i watched the whole fight live and i didnt see any sign of tommy fury winning. it was unfair and im sorry for your loss. u deserve that win. and please dont let these comments tell you anything. u won and tommy fury lost. no one can tell me otherwise
Copium hard
0:33 guy said he broke down and started crying 😂😂😂😂 why would you even post this? Cause later in the vidoe he said he didn't care what 3 random people said 😂😂😂 then why were you crying 😂😂😂
How tf does this video have a 100k more likes than dislikes? All the comments are roasting him for being a sore loser, are these just fans who follow blindly or did he buy likes? 😂
You lost, foo.
U CANT DO AND SAY WHAT U SAY AND KNOW BEING QUIET. FIGHT JAKE PAUL AND SHOW THAT U ARE A MAN OF YODUR WORD. OTHERWISE THE HISTORY WILL JUDGED YOU.
My god, they were right, you can either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain😂
3 years? Ksi you’ve been boxing since 2016, yeesh, he really has lost his knowledge😂

Bro why jj trying so hard to get a w
How long are you going to keep ducking Jake?
He is gone again
COME HERE BOY
ITS DADDY
I SEE U
ITS YOUR BOY FOREHEAD     KSI👴
You lost JJ stop it.
Nah cause these comments talking as much shit possible but haven’t even looked at the judge score cards yeah no💀
you lost get over yourself
All this hugging and all these star jumps that he did with Tommy Fury made KSI more delusional than ever.
Big ego + money + fame = disgusting human being. Congratulations Tom Furry after this video i can see that you deserved the win much more
😅😅😅
How untalented is tomy fury? That mf been Training his whole life with the best trainers and Professional coaches. and the fact that theres even a debate if he won or lost against a youtuber who startet training a few years ago and startet from scratch is so emberassing for tomy
Been real quiet sense the appeal came back even less in your favor 😅
Who else think jj Should do that thing he used to do where he paid fans if they made him laugh with amazon giftcards i miss that man
He get so angry cause he lost then try to get his fan to go on his Instagram and say he lost he a sore loser get humble jj glad you lost 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jj is sore loser 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro's ego is bigger than his forehead
Things were going well until the harassing part man that’s low tbh… coming from a ksi fan
Even if the battle comes as a loss on a piece of paper, we all know you’re the winner in our eyes. Keep fighting and inspiring people like me.
Hey jj I was a fan of you since a kid but as the years went on I grew up and now I am ashamed of the person you became I am embarrassed to say I looked up to you the 19 year old jj would be disgusted in the person you are today
So much hate in your comment section hahaha man just needed a break...
Perfect representation of a sore loser
I’ve just watched this video it’s disgusting. Stop attacking his character you coward you lost accept it I think you have genuinely convinced yourself that you won you fool sort your head out.
Leave these haters
You lost because he was better that’s it rematch if you want he’s been doing it his whole life mate he has WAY more miles in boxing than you and wanted it more simple as. Take your loss with dignity and stop being a sore loser. Tommy has been sparring Tyson fury since childhood you can’t get better sparring partners than that
Ksi did not lose the fight
KSL
Yall are some major haters oml🤦🏾‍♂️ you can come back bigger and better JJ
Ksi has been an L since he partnered with that scum bag scammer logan Paul 😂
Why would you post this man 😕
You don’t deserve to win when you  hug the guy to avoid a beatdown which is what Logan did vs Mayweather. It’s that simple
your not talented
loser
Ksi needs a break from YouTube. The man needs a little therapy. His ego got stabbed and now he's showing his true colours. I think it's hilarious because I always knew he would lose like a loser. Jake just fought a cab driver? ( he said this in another clip while sparring) You took that from him when he said you fought a cab driver when you fought joe fournier. You had to clip him hard with an elbow. The day he humbles himself will be the beginning for him. But right now he's got to be the biggest man baby in the influencer boxing scene. Ksi bro stop filling that big forehead of yours with total bs and denial. Win like a man and lose like a man.
JJ, a man surrounded by yes-men, denying that he lost in his own event, by the referees that he knew, by throwing hugs instead of punches. He should do better, even though I never expect from him. Man has become so egotistical its crazy.
shut up ninja
Ksi and Ngannou got robbed
You lost a long time sub bro your ego just too big and cant be humbled
Bro just take the damn loss, you win some lose some but you making yourself look like a arse Fr
Can I have some prime
Knowledge Strength Integrity    More like KRY S I
why wasnt this recommended to me for 13 days? i have watched literally every single one of your videos for 10 years. the algorithm really is ruthless.
This is genuinely embarrassing he is so butthurt over this lost grow some balls and accept it and move on like a real man
Do these comments keep you up at night mate?
Wtf happened to you
Win or lose dude, you have gone mentally insane at this point bruh, 😅literally yapping, after your ego broke
It’s not even a question. You lost 😂
ksi man... hes fallen off so hard i cant lie
Let's not forget he got the dub one hundred percent , not the actual way to take your first L of your life(in books obv) . He lost in the faceoffs w tommy , but having the fury legacy and getting fuked like that didn't deserve that praise. Took him this much time cause he wasn't over it ,clearly still isn't. If you compare tommy's fight w jake paul tommy didn't know how to get near JJ soo you give him that
KSI becomer boxer
Lsi doesn’t know how to lose
Delusional clown
HAHA YOU ARE FORCED TO TAKE THE LLLLLLLLLL LITTLE BOY 😂😂😂😂 YOU LITTLE INBRED RAT
Mocks disabled person - okay  Incites berating - evil.   You all laughed at a video where he mocks a disabled person and the comments went off knowing that person might see the video. You all liberal heathens !! You no better than this sell out fool.
Biggest downfall in Youtube history
If you're gonna have an ego, atleast back it up and don't tell your fans to attack your opponent, I love this man for all the good things he's done but this is so insanely delusional
Somone who laughs out after talking is utterly a failed person
yea bro you won the fight, but tbh your talent is being wasted boxing we miss you here on Youtube for real bro. Needed to hear you talking the good talk bro.
Well, my man, jake has done something you couldn't even with PINEDA. It's time to stop ducking and running. You do so much ducking im surprised you haven't started quacking 😂
🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅
ksi your actually a loser
If he thinks he’s a good boxer and Jake Paul said he lost is because of point deduction. They both should do bare knuckle fighting or backyard fighting with less rules and see how they actually do with little to no rules.
Nah.. so the legacy hes talking about is personal attacks and encourage his viewers to berate someone. Good job JJ. Thats one legacy right there.
You honestly change to much man I’m going to have to unsubscribe. Your lost your ego is cloud you and I can’t be apart of this type of shenanigans, mature KSI grown don’t tell your audience to harass someone because you lost
it reminds me the last scene from interview with the vampire when Tom cruise says: "oh jj...jj you still whining jj" :D
You lost bro…
Salty asf! Hugging guy
Come to qatar man!
Your a proper sausage you lad
why u still crying bro get over it you lost He is a professional boxer, your a YouTube stick to that bud no hate
Jake beat another boxer while you were trying to clown him on the same day. If you’re not going to fight him, then just stop talking about boxing. Give up.
He is saying the EXACT same thing he laughed at Logan, and Jake Paul for. “Tommy couldn’t knock out a YouTuber” “I’m appealing for the back of the head” Nah man, you talked shit then and it came around, time to man up.
Keep doing what u are doing and we are so proud of u
You lost
Really thought this guy was the opposite of Logan Paul. I guess being friends with him taught KSI how to be just as scummy.
Fight Jake Paul. Get knocked out and retire.
You were running the whole time. You can't win a fight like that.
jeez
yikes
We’ll see JJ in a few years make a new energy drink with Tommy fury dw
Yikes
bro has an ego bigger than the Great Wall of china
What an asshole… didn’t like Tommy and wanted you to win… COMPLETELY done a turn around here… what ashame.
Love how going into the fight the (YouTubers) are calling themselves pros even gods get after the loss jj is like oh your a boxer you should of beat me I’m just a YouTuber, also you can’t talk on someone who has a kid if you don’t have one bro don’t judge when you have no experience on shit, you are a just a delusional kid who acts the best then when it all goes wrong you talk down on yourself and act as if it’s all unfair and everyone’s against you. Sad sad human being 😂   Also don’t tell fans to go hate on someone else your a very influential YouTuber and people look up to you for some reason never the less you should be an idol and your a awful one hate the fact I bet used to be a fan 😮
This video should make people unsubscribe to KSI
Probably because Fury was expecting you to actually box, not do a Wonderboy impression and try and win on excuses. It's time to move forward now, Fury OFFICIALLY won.
How does this man child still have fans his delusion is wild
Star jumping champ of the world.
Ksi im starting to lose mad respect for u.  All the bocing promotors who hate each other. Dont theow ahows onthe same weekend. The fact u did some stupid spar to take views from jake is such a disappointment diet bag tactic. Beat him inthe ring but dont sabataoge ur business oartners brothers income he aint doing shows on top of ur prime card he even thought u beat fury but youre gonna do him dirty and throw a fight with speed who had no chance to take views from jakes card . Juts a dort bag move u fighting jake the drama its still build up for both yalls income if i were him id not even give u that money just for this dirt bag move. Do better ksi u owe jake an apology that was a dirty dirty move to do to someone u want to make money with. Punch him inthe face to get ur revenge dont hit his pockets hes doing big things for the sport as are. Lets let everyone get rich and not make influencer scene more corrupt than regular boxing already is.  you
This video is making Jake Paul look better than KSI🤣🤣 Jake Paul took L like a WINNER.. Meanwhile KSI took L like literally LOSER and like already the L is the end for him🤣🤣
HE IS CALLING HIS ARMY OF 12 YEAR OLD TEENAGERS TO REVOLT LMAO
GG's man
This is a perfect example of why Youtubers aren't regarded as real celebrities by anyone over 16....No conversation skills, no talent, no humility, no growth, no commitment. He comes across as a petulant fool.
You didn't win the fight mate
Yes
The hypocrisy here is laughable...take the loss and be humble not act like a spoilt narcissist....Real men have pride in keeping quiet
Love how everyone hates on Ksi for this video even though NOBODY handles loss lightly, Everybody’s so fucking sensitive and does not look back upon themselves.
This is so low. KSI is obviously a very sour like looser. This communication is just overall diagusting.
Time to unsubrscirbe I guess. My KSI era has just ended.
Just accept the loss bro
Bro stop crying u lost
He didn’t the judges redid the math and it was jj
Bros deep diving in an Egyptian River. Can't remember which one is is though 🤔
u won
Yes you did
A fight is a fight and you can’t go back on that, really sad to see someone I looked up to behaving like this😢
You're nothing without your fans man you're stuckup ashell take a chillpill.
Used to watch him a long time ago as a kid but growing up I realized this man doesn't have any kind of substance, he'll for sure act mature mr know everything but really the more he speaks the more he projects his insecurities looks like he made a castle of glass now it can't take a single rock being thrown at it,his whole reality is wrong
Leave tommys FAMILY alone.
Take the L your ego needs it bigtime
Next time just box lad im not hating at all but learn actual boxing with actual boxing stances and youll be good 👍
Mans still flaming tommy, this video should have been like "i lost, I'll train to be better. Ggs tommy"
The fact you bounce and float your arms like you did instantly lost you the fight.... the judges wanted to judge boxing and sorry but you didn't do that
You don't bring someone's kid into your loss that's disrespectful
Are you serious? It was the worst hugging match I've ever seen  😂.And what was you stupid bouncy thing you were doing😅
All of y’all are delusional in the comments KSI won the fight and Tommy Fury should go back to his country cuz he looks like Mexican Lmfaoooo
Low down trash human being is what this video screams take some more time lol you clearly need it you lost jj its on your record forever……forever….. might as well get over it now
Yh you won this one, this mf tommy fury done payed the judges
How do you manage to take an even bigger L after the fight….
You just made your loss even worse. Bad attitude. What a shame mate.
if you call this man a Loser who scared speed ....  and turned hem puppy ...  you are not a true KSI fan
Bruh, not even Deji who take an L more than KSI could be this salty and tell his fans to harrasing his opponent verbally 🤣 he should learn from his younger brother to manage his emotion, I guess the joke about his forehead is bigger because of his ego turn out to be true.
Bro is such a sore loser this is crazy
Maybe you lost because Tommy was actually boxing  and you were jumping around swinging your arms about like a chimpanzee
Ksi don’t listen to these people
You did something for speed your the Goat 🐐 ❤
Bruh you lost, big ass ego
Asking your followers to mess with travellers is irresponsible.  Nothing bad ever happens when a grown ass man attempts to weaponise children.
Wish we could still dislikes on this one
Nobody actually cares when JJ says he's been working hard, because the projects aren't really interesting to anyone or even beneficial to the world at large in any way...  Boxing? Noone cares really, you're not a professional level boxer.  Music? Your music lacks any and all substance and is really just meh, the existence of your music career is entirely reliant on your youtube fans going and spamming listens. You are not an artist.  Prime? There are so many awful things about Prime, but in particular it's predatory marketing stands out as well as its general inefficacy in regards to being a sports drink. Youtube? You're successful, sure, but that's it. Of course it isn't easy to be successful, but ultimately you have no soul, no passion, nothing. You don't make good videos. You have nothing. You are nothing. That's it.
Bro stop pls, I dont know how much I can take
I think we a owe Deji an apology
KSI, will you speak with Logan Paul about all the scams he's ran in the past? Since you're friends and all :/
ksi u so kinda with speed god bless u
Ksi is a whole bitch and after seeing jake knock out august i bet my whole life that ksi would lose in a heart beat. Ksi would come up with every excuse not to fight him. After today ksi would never be on a A side facing jake.
This is pathetic on so many levels lol
Jake won by 1st round knockout 😂
You waited this long and somehow got saltier…. Disappointing
Deji >>>
you need to shut up Jake Paul honestly bro
take the L
Hell nah, do the right thing and apologise
Y'all are so weird, y'all want him to be a robot as if he's not allowed to feel defeat or feel anything for that matter, he's human we've all had moments where we felt we deserve something and it was taken it whichever wether it's true in another person eyes or hit who are y'all to tell him to not feel that way???
This hurts to watch as someone who has followed you for half my life
there is a saying in my hometown : A real man appears in times of adversity and your lost JJ is one of them, so your response is to send your army to attack the guy who defeated you in social media ??? Is that a response from a Man who always talks about motivation and self improvement and take full responsibility of his life ?!! I AM DISAPPOINTED Really. Losing is ok or whatever, BUT There is nothing worse than of losing your respect
Huggies
I am a KSI fan and I think he did win the fight, I am no expert though.  It was close and any time it goes to the judges anything can happen.  I have to say JJ saying Tommy Fury is letting his family down because he went out clubbing is too far.   Training for a fight can take months of dieting and hard training in the gym/sparring, then the fight itself.   If someone wants to go out and have some fun after all that hard work that is ok.   What really disappointed me is KSI telling fans to harass Tommy Fury in public.  That is very low.   Come on KSI you know you are better then that.
Delete this video at this point. seriously jj take the L and move on you are telling your whole millions of fanbase to abuse a person who gave you a L makes it even big L
Yo JJ is getting cooked in this section💀
Nah you won fam, judges bribed. Every fighter on social media confusion on the result speaks for itself
KSI K: Knowledge S: I:   Gonna have to come up with something else
Best hugging content I’ve seen in 2023 🔥
Bro let’s 1v1 on legends
Bad look. You lost. The appeal itself was bad enough. Take the loss, move on.
Bro will i get my 15$ bet back if you win this case.  I need that money man im in loss
Just take the L. Try again it might go differently
I swear this youtuber is. An example of what money and Fame can do to you i respected him for Long but he has become a such a delusianal person its just sad to see
MORE LIKE LSI 😂 HOLD THAT L
SORE LOSER CLOWN 😂
SORE LOSER
Bro lost and is still talking about it months later LMAO
Salty 😂 Hold that L because you got whooped
This is fked
He's weak!
I like how all the comments are his own fans calling him out on his bs 😂 Bro is the definition of a sore loser
Bro accept you lost don’t be petty about it  It’s sports you win some you lose some
KSI vs fury = 6 rounds  Paul vs fury = 10 rounds  There is  no comparing   Until KSI vs someone for more then 6 rounds, we can’t even evaluate if he is any good. Go the distance
Those jumping jacks were A1 tho
You are a complete muppet ksi !!!! I really Hope this is the start of many losses for you and i really mean that
Waiting for the apology tweet “I made a lapse of judgement”
JJ,  I'm mad too, I know how much you wanted that win and I wanted that for you. I didn't watch but if you say you should have won, I believe you, undoubtedly! I'm proud of everything you have accomplished and you will ALWAYS, have my support. You're one of my favorite YouTubers, and your "Try Not to laugh"  vids are by far the best. You have accomplished much, and you'll always have a supporter in me. Much love ❤. Keep being awesome!
I used to watch you.. Started when I was maybe 12 and stopped when your ego got ridiculously out of control, I'm only suprised people are noticing this now.. But I'm glad they are, watching this as an OG fan was absolutely embarrassing.. Grow up
KSI has became a hack
Bro you lost get over it. Stop pretending like his a proper boxer. You wouldnt last 1 min against a real proffesional boxer.  The fight is done stop asking people to push your agenda and send comments to him. Well done you managed to have a boxing career in this new world of youtube stop being so salty. No one else cares about this legacy crap like you do. Get over yourself you have become unbearable to watch.
He didn't lose though, did he.  "Integrity" laughable.
LSI is finally back at it...
I always laughed when youve been pretending yoi're boxer. Mate, youre delusional. Youve lost like preticted and thats it.
You know what i find funny? the fact that everyone online wants to act like they hold the moral compass and know whats best for everyone and do nothing wrong, none of you have any right to criticize something as silly as this when your whole entertainment comes from making fun of ksi to begin with, stop acting like you are responsible for holding others online accountable when im sure 99% of you are guilty of similar or if not worse things, its pathetic to read and the fact you all think you change anything by doing this is laughable
Keep hugging bro 😂 💀
Aint you the one who fckin won with a fckin elbow smack and brag about it???
What’s crazy is Ksi is a known boxer now and also is the YouTuber that shows bare ass to his sidemen 😂
Boys were in Yap town
be bald
I love when these famous YouTubers  mask fell off 😂  so you can see how toxic they are hidden.
Look JJ we love you but this is a lil too much... the level of toxicity that you're giving is absurd...quite frankly using your influence to ask your young impressionable fans to harass Tommy is just wrong...there is a reason why you go by Knowledge Strength Integrity...so start to prove it by your actions
As lame as the fight was, KSI takes that one. Undeniable
you did win KSI and i say the fight was rigged and they had to put a couple of more points just to save him, also when is your next champ because im looking forward to know where and when and again YOU WON!!! AND YOUR THE CHAMP!
Hi so nice to see you back;)
This video is just a full out ego blast and absolutely painful to watch. 😢😢😢 This is like when somebody makes an excuse when they couldn't take a loss. But ksi has outdone himself by taking it to a new level, uploading a video rambling about how he was robbed etc. What's worse is that he doesn't hesitate to criticise Tommy to cover up his insecurities, even though their fight was like a month ago, and sending fans to harass him does not speak well with him either
You lost. It's clear as day
Your legacy is done you lost :D
Bro you should've change your gameplan per rounds not just jumping around the ring
Yes
Bro fought Tommy and thinks he accomplished sommat💀
I'm so happy your delusions have been put to bed.
Why is everyone talking about wanting KSI getting humbled, me personally I feel like the fury’s deserves the humbling.
Bro take that mf
Cry about it
crazy how at minimum u and an editor seen this and decided to still upload it
KSI lost the fight and he just keeps losing what a fkn delusional baby
Damn Ksi is dying W about time
Loooooser
fight Jake Paul
Love how people are just now realising what KSI has always been. Bros a 30 year old man trying to ridicule a 24 year old father and get people to Harass him and his family because you clearly lost a fight. You work and publicly defend scammers, where’s the integrity in any of this?
shouldnt be called ksi anymore he has no integrity
ksi became the very thing he made fun of in 2019 against logan. never thought as a ksi fan that i am rooting for jake to humble him
I get that losing sucks but man why would you tell your fans to harass someone my guy if you meant it as a joke it sure as hell didnt sound like it
I get that losing sucks but man why would you tell your fans to harass someone my guy if you meant it as a joke it sure as hell didnt sound like it
Nah bro, i know his ego is huge but ive never seen him stoop this low. You lost JJ, and you need to learn how to humble yourself and take it like a man. Personally, if i was KSI in this situation i'd be sad that i lost but that would just give me all the reason to keep on grinding to keep on winning, just like what he should've done.
Damn JJ you lost the battle and also lost the war this is just sad bro… a real man takes a loss and respects his opponent, from one 30 year old to another, I’m disappointed dawg find peace.
You won! Get it straight. On to the next challenge.
Man coming back to this video to see everyone else is pulling him up on his behaviour is just amazing. I've watched this guy since I was 11. Now 25. That's a lot off years. I called him out on twitter that he will be his own downfall. Then the video got posted and exactly what I said will happen. Has happened. I've lost respect for him. The dude I grew to respect and love is gone.  P.s Mo, the fact you let this go past your editing. Not saying something. -50 respect. Stop being a yes men. People like JJ do not need yes men. Put his ego in check. That's what real friends do.
Why do you feel the need to attack tommy personally?
Why is this big forehead megamind Laughs after anything he sais? Cringe af
You are not a boxer lil bro
A lot of KSI fans have been fans for years and now we're older. I started watching when I was 10 and now I'm 20... I'd love to keep watching JJ but as a fan that grew up, it's kinda impossible to watch him as it's clear he still hasn't. It's sad. I've felt this way for a long time and really thought the loss would be good for him, but it seems to have had no effect on humbling his insane ego.  Cmon bro.
What I got from this video:  1. LSI in denial that he lost. 2. Blames the judges even though he’s laughed at people who blamed the judges before. 3. Trying to use his 12 year old fanbase as a weapon to cope.
its hard to take a loss sometimes but weaponizing your fans to go harass him is absolutely insane 😭😭😭😭
This whole video was just a rant . You didn’t go into why he won or why he shouldn’t have won . You are just coping .This is weak.
By the way to people who are experts on this . Was jj boxing well ?Cause to me who doesn’t know much he looked really bad.
JJ u are just sad at this point.
This video should put you in the same category as the island boys in terms of cringe levels..
You laugh like a cayote.. wohohohooooooo
Dont really get why you had to make such a big deal of this man, but It doesn't really matter now does it? Just wanna say that you did great in that fight and you should not take that loss as hard as it was, but look at it as an improvement. It was a great fight ksi!
As you were working so hard,Tommy Fury was sleeping on his couch right?
Just move on, no point ruminating and revising history. Outside this little fake world of social media, no one gives a sht about who fought or who won.
The re-hydration clause did rub me the wrong way, and Tommy was I feel far too demanding with what he asked for. I also think that neither Tommy or KSI performed very well in the actual match and I would agree that a draw would have made sense. But… I mean KSI is talk smack about how Tommy’s been acting after the fight, but KSI’s just a hypocrite by hiding behind a screen and telling his predominantly underage fan base to harass Tommy when numerous examples in the past of similar internet dog piles always end up with death threats and the instigator (KSI) looking worse overall. If you’re gonna criticise someone for their actions, you can’t just turn around and act in a similar manner, you’d just be a hypocrite. It’s disappointing, but Sidemen still slaps regardless, hopefully KSI reflects and acts his age rather than behaving like a spiteful child putting ice on his bruised ego.
These comments are clapped lol
You’re showing videos of random people who have no bearing on boxing as reasons you should’ve won
Yo respect for keeping this video up.
That laugh. Combined with that forehead. Jesus.
His laugh and his big ego... so annoying
Everytime u lose, r u gonna tell ur fans to harrass them?   U can’t lose 1 fight, what happens when u lose the next ones? R u gonna make another compilation and beg ur fans?
Honestly he rly is a loser for bringing up his life timeline. Like nobody cares what u did b4, during, or after the fight.   He’s trying to make excuses for y he lost by mentioning everything he did.
That’s y I always liked deji better. He at least has humility and is a nice genuine person.
But you lost.....
If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.😊😊🎉
KSI Was Robbed
JJ what has happened to you famous fortune has changed you for the worst. You used to be about building people up now you are sending people to bully others because you lost a match your ego my gosh take a good look in the mirror and ask yourself if you like what you see because what we are seeing is very scary and appalling.
This is gonna be a long comment but yeah KSI right now is acting extremely egotistical and he’s being a very sore loser this show what being a celebrity can do to a person. He never in his head ever thought about the fact that he can loose and when it doesn’t go his way he gets mad like a little kid, I understand being mad if you trained a lot for this, but if you go out of  your way to slander him just for winning that’s just taking advantage of all the fame you have. I used to think KSI was a good sport but clearly he isn’t. He just developed an enormous ego because he’s used to winning and cherry on top is that straight up told his audience that are mostly kids and teenagers that look up to him, to go and harass Tommy both online and irl. And knowing children they’re gonna do it I hope he apologizes because at this point the entire Internet is against him.   Sorry, for my terrible grammar😂
"Hey my fans go harsh this guy! Also he wasn't around for his wife cuz he was beating my ass!"
Even after a L this guy is still Delusional
This is really pathetic, a true narcissist
Unfortunately, you lost mate stop being a sore loser and move on
You did jumping jacks the whole time and think you won
First of all, True Geordie and Eddie don’t like Tyson Fury and they just want Tommy to lose because of him, Adesanya is a proven racist and Eubank Jr was forced to give his take on the fight right in front of you, just moments after leaving the ring. Take the L like a man and move on
You lost
This is embarrassing going personal too smh
Either you die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain
If you see this JJ you are my inspiration to work harder everyday I love you with all my heart I wish you the best and hope you succeed in everything you want to succeed in ❤️❤️
Surrounded by yes man, ego out of control, sore loser
Heard.
Absolutely immoral.
This is just sad. KSI’s evil side has been revealed.
This video is soo cringe (coming from a KSI fan btw )
I see this as a tie and another rematch but fury won ? That’s crazy af
He should go back to music tbh, I think that era of KSI I kinda liked
You narcisstic man, that's why you go along with Logan so well
I believe u won jj
This dude is such a L
KSI is a great example of how badly money can corrupt people. I’d rather be just well off and a decent person w/ morals than be a rich douchebag w/ a massively inflated ego.
here before the " downfall of ksi " expose video by turkey tom in a few years.
This is just sad 😢
Chael said the commentators were swaying people for ksi but when he rewatched it he said ksi lost
Look at your comment section, bro does this comment section look like someone’s that lost? No it doesn’t. You’re self centered and delusional
Bruh you lost, and you made that embarrassing dragon ball z threat style video. Tommy didn’t do that, you should be more devastated that you put that video out than the loss honestly.
People who hate JJ for the things he is saying should know he is just being real he doesn't care how you gonna hate him he is not going to fall
Did he even rewatch the fight, bro looked horrible. Honestly looked worse in the fury fight then his first fight against Joe. Not to mention bro just told millions of people to harass fury online and in public about the decision that wasn’t even his, fury just showed up to a fight and the decision from the judges still stands at the end of the day. Someone needs to scratch out the “I” in KSI. 💀
never saw someone who can not accept a loss like him.
You did and your the sorest of losers
Me reading theses comments of the fans 😳😳😳
JJ bro, whatever happens I am always in debt for the happiness you brought to my life thank you king 👑
Your pathetic… see ya ✌🏾
That's what happen to you when you hang out with logan paul
I don’t give a shitte
Aaaaaannnndddd now he's doing his disappearing act again because he's getting hate for making a dumbass video.
The troops need to talk our king. We love you JJ and losing sucks. This is not the right attitude though. Spend some time with your boys and your family. Relax a bit more and you will see that this fight means nothing to your success , your fame or your legacy. What could change your legacy is weird rants like this. You are killing it my guy and I think we would all love to see you come back to the ring with a different game plan and dominate - since the plan didnt work this time. The boys seem so excited to have you out of camp and chilling with them again and making content more regularly - enjoy the ride for a bit. All the best man :)
As a fan.. I was kinda disappointed man about your comment. Please bro accept a lose HUMBLY.  Don’t make the emotions  take over you man 💔
Let's be honest he couldn't took his family on a holiday due to the beef with him and his brother and yeah he's being too much I can't handle to watch his ego. Mf thinks he's Mayweather up on confronting some of bum ass boxers throughout his boxing career. BRO LIKE WTF IS THISS BRUV LIKE AAAAAUURRGHHH it such a pain that he still can't move on from the fight. Clearly he just needs to accept the fact and move the fuck on I hope he does btw but its him in the end(i kinda love his ego at some angle it kinda times well) but this is too much and ffs, it's just bad to see him be like this after taking a loss I mean like tbh why even fight a fighter/boxer that has a deep connection within the boxing industry, THERE'S FUCKING JAKE PAUL bro manage to have a mindset where he thinks he believes he'll beat that mf when he beats Tyson fuck man just give us both y'all bro or give us Mayweather vs. Kai Cenat bruv ill be gladly entertained im just fooling around it is just saddens me how much he pushes to the limit where it personally drives him insane just idk bruv. Still rooting on him first saw him tbh 2015 and been there since I was a fucking kid. Love you bro hope you heal and grow for the betterment for yourself peace ✌️.
Take that bandana off
It sucks when you realize one of your idols turn out to just be a narcissistic pathetic asshole, I’ve been watching you since I was 13, whenever someone mentioned abt my heroes you were always on the list. You were the one that taught me when we are close to giving up, think of a word to keep striving for like LEGACY,I feel like such a massive L now, but the most important thing you taught me is right here, how to NOT handle a loss, Do better JJ ❤
JJ czz fm wtf 1 Upload every Month or something???
Next time so Euro training with Terry Crews you'll never lose
Move on
JJ + LOGAN PAUL= SHIT !
KSI over the years has just turned into a bellend.
Yes jj... Yes u did
6:50 bro is just enjoying his break after fighting just like you bro  cool your tits you are no different And btw that is 2 clips It’s his kids aswell what do you know about his family and his private life For all you know he probs is with them right now
My black nephew asked me why KSI was crying after his lost fight..i just said not every black superhero men cry after a lost...just believe in the right one..... and i also told him to be a MAN ...respectfully
It was a draw tbh as Tommy had 1 more point than you without the deduction so if he got 1 removed then he has the same as you it is a draw
Sore loser
Stop hanging out with Logan
This video is a proof JJ never turned into a man .He is just 30 year old child.
You lost 😂😂😂😂
You should honestly take this down
U lost bro just accept it the 3 random people where judges
Bro has lost it
Jumping around.like a clown
Ksi is a heavy clown u fought like a clown u won nth
Tommy won that fight hands down Delusional guy LMAO
Ksi: "Struggled to jab me" sure with all your hugging, it is difficult to jab someone if they hug you 24/7 to cover up their lack of skill
Why does everyone say he lost I thought it was a tie fr.
KSI has surpassed Jake Paul in terms of delulu and ego. Sad to see it man.
JJ you said you'd ne posting posy broooo
He still thinks he did well in the fight
Literally a 30 year old toddler 😭😭😭
Y’all’s logic makes 0 sense, Ksi won the fight😭 tommy fury is garbage
You couldn’t score a knock down on a man who been boxing their whole life. I genuinely think that is hilarious
Listen ksi, stop being weak and you will win. Ok mate ? You have to.
i dont know how people can like him, Bros becoming Logan Olatunji LOL.
Broo c'mon man you just lost acept it and don't humiliate Fury like that be humble
Absolute melt. Cannot believe he's using his platform and position to harass another person just because he lost a boxing fight. Never liked KSI but now man.. This is a whole new level of pathetic
This is crazy. But be like deji, don’t be like jj.
lol that wasn't a fight that was a dancing mockery
The way we know JJ he will grow out of this and see his wrong behavior
KSI: publicly bullies his bro after losing a boxing match KSI after losing a boxing match:
Honestly I’m not mad that you lost not even disappointed what you tried to do was a lot and you put up a good fight and I do agree that it looked like a draw or it should have even been a win for you
I had a 250 dollar bet on Tommy and I swear I lost when they fought. But turns out I won cus judges trolled . Game is game Tommy lowkey trash tho
Love and support man dont lose your self always pray to god when you think you lose no man you didn't lose but you almost losses your self just pray bro love support
Dude thing is…. You aren’t really a good fighter or boxer. Sorry, you just aren’t, footwork isn’t there and hands rely on the right overhand. HOWEVER, your stamina and endurance makes you tough. That is scary and I feel like you just won’t go down, that you have much vigor and heart.
Yo JJ u won’t slide 10k to a fellow legends player who happens to be f2p and got shafted of all my hard earned 100k cc
All the best qualities of Logan paul rubb off on ksi ig lol
Once he started talking about Tommy’s post win fun it takes a sharp turn , disappointing attitude JJ
Sad display
They teach you to clinch with that training? You clinched tommy 49 times in just 6 rounds is that a world record? It has to be. You can't box. So fuckin goofy lmfao
That because they give fury auto win , any fury who fight thry give an auto win
tommy straight up turned jj into karen dayum bro chill out
bro is absolutely broken 💀
That’s what you get for laughing at Logan Paul for a appeal in 2019
Yes, you did.
Excuses.
You may be rich but you are a loser a slave to money and success, this is why we need more people like pewdiepie and saviour 3.0
Win or lose, the fact that KSI was able to hang with Tommy says a lot, whether it be about KSI or Tommy
You're actually a muppet these days mate
Na bro you hugged the whole time punch clinched
Now he need a response video for his response video
#takethatL 😂😂😂
Yes, you lost.
Literally mate, so many people thought you lost, people thought you won, so what the scoreboard said YOU lost, yes you may have worked hard and done many things with the lead up to the big moment, opinions don’t matter at the end of the day. Just because you didn’t win doesn’t mean you can’t do other things and make yourself better. Accept it and move on be better and make a difference between now and the next time. Stop trying to make excuses, and be somewhat be more like Joe Weller, accept it and move forward. A lesson learnt, no matter how hard you work sometimes it just isn’t enough.
Bro needs a 2nd loss to humble himself w
Comment section full of a bunch of pussies W ksi
Wtf was this half of the video going after the guy like that....
Your ego is like your hair line. It’s massive. You aren’t showing any true sportsmanship. Just take the L bro. It’s not that deep fr.
Bro take the L. It’s not that deep. You win at everything life.  Just not one fight.
Dufes a perfectionist. Nout wrong in that. Humilty settles in sooner or later. Still winning in life
You lost, foo.
Of course people feed his ego, figures
Do you want some chips with your salt JJ?
A sad manifesto of an unaware narcissist. All that “GrInD” and “hArD wOrK” and yet you haven’t done the main work and it cought up to ya. Fix the narcissistic traits ASAP I understand it’s hard to deal with but it’s possible to control that inner rage and not project it onto others to then appear disgustingly unlikeable. U can do it JJ, trust me I’m speaking from experience 😂😂
Tommy won
Loser
Why are we still talking about this
U guys just watch from 8:30 , trust!
Evsn his own brother knew he wasn’t the winner 😂😂😂😂
You lost fair and square
KSI was cool until he started hanging out with the wrong people. Logan Paul and his gang I believe have been feeding his ego
Good come back to YouTube to prove everyone who called Ksi a baby and a man who can’t take losses without throwing a fit right well done Ksi and not only that you’re telling your own fan base to harass Tommy over him winning honestly impressive how much of a baby a 30 year old man with so much success and so much talent can be well done Ksi you proved all the haters right with this video instead of taking it like a man and moving on.
There's gonna be a rematch
Ksi lost the fight and lost the fans lmaoo
Is Tommy even still thinking about KSI? I dont think he is.
Hahahaha
we really hyped this man up so much he became delusional
Did tommy hit him in the head too much or something, this is not sportsmanship.
Dang. The world moves though.  Loved this guy’s content, kinda disappointed. YouTube as a platform is changing as classic faces get older and evolve (or regress) and viewers grow as well. This is shameful, but it’s time for a new generation of YouTubers for a new generation of viewers. I for one will be largely leaving the site and touching grass.
I thought this was gonna be a retirement video 😂
I loved KSI and watched him for years but fuck this guy, bro you lost and youre true colours have shown, how can you still shit talk the guy who beat you ...  Unsubscribed mate 😂
Notice he was laughing when he said it
To everyone hating in the comments it was a joke
disgusting behaviour, really setting a bad example
Hahhahahahahah sore loser
Ngl i get jj, if yall had drive like him and lost an important fight, 99% of yall would do what jj did and say what jj did, tbh in my opinion he didnt make any bad points in the video
Wallllmaaaarttt
Ngl JJ makes it hard to like him I mean the ego is just crazy 🫥
You clearly lost that fight
Kunichiwa😂😂
Great to have a solid reminder of why I unsubscribed from this clown
Damn bro so much hate on here 😭😭 yall acting like yall wouldn’t do the same bruh grow up
“I don’t care if 3 random people thought you won” them 3 people being qualified, experienced professional boxing judges, but the world (majority who aren’t qualified , experienced professional boxing judges, especially the large majority of his fanbase) they’re the ones he agrees with. Had he won and Tommy was saying this he’d be calling him a sore looser. Your ego is massive. You needed to be humbled.
So, when 3 random judges say KSI wins, then it's no issue and should be taken seriously. But when 3 random judges say KSI wins, all of a sudden the opinion of said judges don't matter? Make your mind up.
You're just toxic. Rioting people up to "remind him that he lost" as a big youtuber is the dumbest thing you can do and is a criminal act. Also, as a first time mom, i can tell you that talking about his wife and kid in this video is the lowest of the lowest, you don't know anything about his life. You also don't have a little kid, so you don't know how important it is to take a break sometimes, and some people need it more, some don't. But don't ever judge a first time parent.  Nobody cares about that fight anymore. Everyone here tells you the same, but you are acting like a crazy person right now. Move on or stop making videos before you make it even worse for yourself.
Bruh fight jake paul already and stop crying we don't care about Tommy fight jake paul!!!!!!!!!
Bros arrogance shot to his head, JJ you need to take a pause because wtf is that?
I'm surprised this video is still up
He’s 30 and this is his response to a loss. I am sensing the start of a downfall
Ive a suggestion Challenge tommy fury to star jumps you will win that
i like you jj but no one relevant ever said that you won, let alone the internet. just look at your comment section...and despite that i really feel that tomy fought better than you on many instances during the fight you're just showing what's convenient to make your point. at the end of the day you lost but it's no big deal try to accept it and grow past that that's how you inspire ppl. it doesn't matter that you lost, what does is if you've learned from it
Take the L
Nah a lot of people thought KSI won it is VERY understandable to how he is feeling right now. You can’t complain how he is when everyone in this chat would do the same if they got robbed off a win…. A you can argue that no he was hugging etc but in this sport you can see that was his game plan and there was a video of his trainer explaining how to nullify Tommy’s Jab since he leads with that. An in most of the clinches at crucial moments KSI was beating him in the clinch. But unfortunately an apparently who ever has the pressure in the middle of the ring wins even though he wasn’t landing any shots when he had pressure and had a point deducted. So in a fair opinion it should have been a draw or SD(this because of the point deduction.
9 minutes, 13 seconds of yapping
I am so glad you guys finally have opened your eyes to see how much he changed after selling out.
he 'struggled to jab you' because all you did was dance around like a muppet. if you stood like a man and actually boxed it would be impressive.
You're a narcissist ksi
Ksi was roasting logan for appealing now, he has appealed lol 😂
Hi JJ just wanna let you know you inspire me to become a YouTuber I'm starting my channel because I wanna be like you. From your biggest fan
Come to Jesus , man.
What
He list the fight and he is also lost after the fight 😂😂
Bro i am your best fan from Ethiopia
Ok let's be real. It is undeniable that we are proud of how far you have come but this is just wrong KSI. Harassing a man over a boxing match seems just wrong. Don't take this as a loss, but as a lesson. Stay Humble, brudda.
I don’t understand how the boys let him keep this video up, let alone upload it.
Should’ve kept it classy man
JJ what are you doing man I thought you were better than this
JJ is just immature , even if he thinks he won he should accept the refs opinion and stop acting childish.
My man fans are dumb kids and he is thinking they are smart of thinking ksi should have won that game
Andrew Tate was right about these "influencer"
NOT accepting L is more disgrace than losing the match.
Y’all act like he didn’t take the L better than jake which is crazy y’all all have some dick riding personality which is crazy my suggestion get off the internet and stop judging other people’s life whenever your no better 😬
L
The only people to lose in this fight was the fans that paid for the fight 😂
Whats the saying.. pride comes before the fall. I've been watching JJ since day one all I can say is I'm astonished by his lack of emotional discipline I get you're disappointed, take the L and move on don't ask your fans to harass anybody, don't bring another mans kid into the conversation either. Wtf is wrong with you man. I've lost all respect for you dude.
I don’t get why everyone’s going off at JJ. Nothing he said in this vid is wrong, if you watched the fight you would’ve seen it was a clear robbery.
he was just better lil bro
Peace JJ (unsubscribe)
What a cry baby, man has a terrible ego problem and always has had it.
Ok we all agree that’s tommy didn’t deserve that win and you earned the respect from the people but why are you telling your fans wich most of them are kids to harras someone who didn’t have anything with that decision he just a boxer and don’t forget he will be a father , jj YOUR F 30 YEARS OLD GROW TF UP
Bro I still don’t know what to make of the way you handled the Logan Paul scam situation which is still muddy, but this might be a new low. I’ve watched you since 2010 and never thought I would be commenting this. I just wanted to see what you would do with the reach and platform you have. I thought maybe it was just me not understanding the “bigger picture” but  now I’m just lost. I don’t even think you the same person anymore who would call people out on their bullshit. You just another one of them now. Using your fans this way, not accepting reality, and just total disconnect from the people that actually watched and supported you from way back. I promise you that you would be laughing at yourself with the way you laughed at the wasabi kid or one of the tiktokers. I was gonna say I hope this comment section is a reality check but you don’t even read these, probably not even Mo. it’s cool tho, it is what it is
Ksi this is you good heart test for this Christmas, crypto gift, my cryptmas gift , 0x2776eba8c269b401746303861b3f7ae4bd64ddab
Yo ksi , if you lost it, let me fine it, where you lost it, this Christmas send me crypto, My ksi Christmas gift test,  ksi, ksi ksi ksi what is ur crypto wallet look, make video about ur crypto and give away this Christmas,  but send me my cryptmas first 😂😂😂😂😂 my wallet is 0x2776eba8c269b401746303861b3f7ae4bd64ddab  A couple Ethereum or bnb please
Take your loses man... If the new orlean saints were able live through the worst no call ever you can easily just move on and take this L
Sore loser
In terms of ego, Jake and JJ arent too different.
i dont care you lost 😂
Wtf are you saying
RIP iShowSpeed💀
I think you need to realise some not all of your fans are not good people and realise that reacting like this does and it’s okay to act like this no matter what and it doesn’t make you look good either
This man really needs to be humbled. Your ego needs to be checked. I think losing to Jake will do to him what he did to Logan's ego.
Close fights aren’t robberies, the only people who were robbed were the ones that paid PPV
I don’t care what anybody thinks, Tommy Fury and JJ did great in a ring and the entire journey up to the fight was entertaining. I’m glad JJ has taken a time off to relax and spend time with his family and friends, he definitely needed it.
7:55 are you for real? Yeah no I'm done with JJ
All you guys made him the way he is! All his success is because of you!
Finally people see him for what he truly is!
Wow man just wow  This is textbook witch hunting and it’s pretty close to the scummiest thing you can do as a big creator.   I just unsubbed best of luck to those that do the same.
No Way😱 Your appeal got denied! Oh my god! I Did not see this coming. I *really* thought that your appeal, would get through. But nah, the commission laughed in your face 😂 and told you to go _Fuck yourself_ and now look at you. 😂🫵
Your acting like Logan when he lost to you with your appeals even Jake took it like a man you never won the fight all you did was swing and hug so shut up ksi and grow up
As a father myself, you don't talk about another man's kids or family.
Everybody got robbed LOL.
Boohoo you lost get over it
ive missed you
Tommy Fury Won .  Take The L
Like this comment if you lost your faith in KSI, I'm sorry bro you've changed😔
If ksi loses to jake paul he would off himself thats why its not happening
JJ 😢
You're not a boxer. You've never been good at fighting and Tommy showed that whether you like it or not.
ksi got smocked
So lost
i knew ksi was egotistical but damn
WE MAKING IT BACK TO THE BEDROOM Q&ASWITH THIS ONE🔥🔥🔥🗑️
Love you but you cant Box don’t see any improvement to your first fight
Ayyy all the clown ass fans finally leaving W
Well if anything this video is him on a sly trying to organise another fight without saying so. May have came across distasteful to some but, in the fight a lot of things to actual boxing fans did. I’d see it again fuck it
your hairline? yeah bro we already knew
SPEED VS STRENGTH UP NEXT L's happen dude. :3 like one your gonna get from speed
You deserve to lose when you treat boxing like a hugging contest
your ego is insane lol, cope
Man child
Ignore the positive comments
Bro u fucking loss
L
Wow. Prick.
Blud said I'm back and hasn't posted in 9 days 😂
mad levels of copuim
Unlucky he is more experienced and his uncle is Tyson fury worlds best boxer but you won
Bro just get over it, literally nobody cares and forgotten about this until u came back
Clown
So much Vegeta energy here.😂😂😂
don’t let this video disregard the fact that KSI’s music sucks
Yeah JJs doing too much
Bro you guys saying ksi is toxic are just a bunch of bitchess
It goes to show that at this point boxing is just rigged.
Damn the comments are roasting
What are you guys on about? He literally won the fight. They couldn’t let a YouTuber win. ❤
womp womp
wow no one can take a joke in 2023. leave my guy alone, he hasn’t change, the world’s just become so soft
fragile ego
strength and integrity has left the chat.
Such a tiny man you are
Booooo KSI 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
To be honest Ksi’s fanbase is the worst they got too soft over the years his fan base, then was so much better than today’s their literally the most toxic to be honest, this is the only reason for him to quit and the best too.
Dragon ball Legends content when? 🤔
Bro is mad cause he lost💀
I just wanna say this to all these ppl hating on ksi  Why so serious?  Its a game i dont even know about tommy or ksi (music) i dont know much about boxing But getting so much hate for losing some boxing match is weird to me
I think y’all might be severely dumb. KSI won that no doubt and he is right about what he is saying. Sure maybe he was wrong about mfs attacking Tommy but still , KSI won that either way. He worked hard just for it to be unfair. Stop idk riding Tommy furry and stop saying shit like “I looked up to you and it’s sad to see you like this”.   because if you were a true fan you would know he won and he is the one in right at this moment.
Title of this video should be "Narcissist man child still coping over defeat"
Damn that's pretty crappy to tell your supporters to go clown a man  because he lost something
You lost. And I've lost my last shreds of respect for you.
Eyy I'm from Botswana in Africa and I just tasted prime nd prime energy it slaps😮
Embarrassing
Dude you need to be more humbe. You lost plain and simple and should show respect to tommy. This is coming from a huge fan of yours
Bro raged like a kid 😂
I think KSI needs a reality check. It's ok to feel like you shouldn't have lost, and deal with the emotions that come with that. But it's not ok to deal with it like this.  You don't tell your subscribers or fans to go harass someone because your feelings got hurt.   You have been blessed phenomenally with what you have in your life and the opportunities you've been given. And you blow it in the face of everyone when you act like this.
Your definition of hard work is so pathetic.
"Life isn't fair" yeah buddy and that's why your rich for literally having no skill and get the opportunity to have a sook over things that have no meaning. "Hard work" 😂😂😂. You're a joke.
My man the match was embarrassing,you took one shot to the face and completely spaced out and tried to keep hugging and throwing wild overhands, my god stop,the fury fight was an insult to boxing,and to now being a sore loser is just crazy,why in the world are you bringing up the kid and mom? What did they do?
You’re making it hard to support you after all this controversy, remember you have integrity written on your back, you should try live up to those words.
You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain
do try not to laugh
Bruh alright… I get it. attack his boxing skills and how he acts… but don’t attack a persons personal life man
Bro you lost fair and square, just take the loss and bounce back. There’s no need to talk down on another man that has a kid and a wife. Stop letting arrogance get to you and be better.
Being fr if jake paul did this alot of people would vlown on him but no one clowning ksi for being a sore loser and telling his fans to harass tommy furry your just manipulating your fanbase and your abusing your power
So u was all talk
You want people to publicly berate tommy fury? You've completly lost it, no digginity left.
honestly this is just pathetic, just take the loss like a man
Why do you care. You have fucking everything. Go cry cuz you lost a match. Who cares if you won or lost. It’s really. It doesn’t matter
Bro can't lie your mum's Hella pretty 💯.. love that woman 😂❤
Spoiled brat
No one cares.
Every time Tommy tried to throw a punch you would hug him or your awkward style made it so you would always hug him. It was not a clean fight and your stance didn't allow it to be a clean fight. Here's what you did... You jumped on the spot and then you would commit to a jab and then back out and wait. Then Tommy would come forward, try to jab and then you would just hug him. Repeat this whole fight. How do you think you won that fight? You weren't even allowing Tommy to have a proper fight. YOU were the one point fighting. If you wanted to knock him out you would swing without hugging.
You’re complaining about living a life that not even 1 percent will ever get? Boohoo
You didn’t win
egoSI
You have a great talent for communicating ideas effectively.
Childish
I used to be a fan, even watched you back in the fifa days. But not after this behaviour. Nice one JJ, just unsubbed.
Big dog, big fan of you and a huge supporter in your team and i think you are skilled and have had major well deserved success in so many parts of your life… but this just ain’t it man. Idk if you’ll even see this comment… but tbh we all thought you won, but i think a lot of us are left wondering maybe Tommy did deserve this more if this is the kind of mentality you have. Threw a tantrum when you lost… and then are telling everyone to go berate Tommy because you want to feel better about yourself and like maybe you actually did win. The thing is dude, you trained fucking hard and have been crushing the game.. but take the fucking loss and move on like a man. The fight was shit on both sides….
This is how money and power can turn someone into a PR**K, what a dick!
You lost against tommy. Stop crying 😂 maybe fight harder stop whining and do something. Like fight jake Paul. We don’t care about the tommy fight anymore
Stop boxing bro, more money on try not to laugh videos let's gooooooooooooo
KSI bro please we all still support you and we know that you are the true winner here Tommy cheated to win with his back shots but you fought him fairly I saw the fight too we will always support you bro we don't care of your loss you fought as a man stand proud
Im a big fan of u bro and i have been for a while but come on im only a teenager and i know what your doing is just petty yes the score may have been rigged but telling your impressionable fanbase full of little kids to harrass tommy is just childish bro i thought u were better than this  I also wanna add that I'm glad your fans are calling you out on this good to know that there are still people with logic your brother has lost many times but he never attacked his opponents and their families over a sport and yet you believe that your the better brother
That’s a big fat L for him… I hope he is reading the comments here…
Love jj, knew he didn't like losing, but I never imagined he would handle losing like such a bitch. Im so shocked. Attacking tommy, his kid, and telling people to bother him publicly? He hates when people do similar stuff like that to him😂
Everyone in the comments taking this way to seriously out of everything in this video you all took 10 sec out of him jokingly saying something bad.😑
hoping that KSI may reconsider his actions and words in the future, especially when he receives feedback or criticism from fans and the broader community.
edge streak lost
Okay, so I’ve been a bit of a fan of KSI for a while, when I heard he did something as people called out as a very bad idea, that’s scary. KSI, please do better. I understand you’re angry, you lost which isn’t fun but sometimes the loss helps you get better and it helps you push through the problem. Do better and maybe apologize and just be more aware of what you do and you should have a plan for the future. No hate to you but do better
It's clear yu lost the fight get over it
i wanna see the cat more often
KSI is not in his right mind
Jake   is the Goat
Wanker. Humbled🤣🤣🤣🤣💯ahahaha he started crying😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
L KSI
Loser
Knowledge, strength and integrity my ass 😂
A YTer losing to a boxer... wow, such a surprise. Cry more.
thought u was gonna knock tommy out ahahahah ur a joke
‘Pissed off scouser from Fifa 12’ is loving this rn
… yup he and Logan work perfectly together
KSI is not the man anymore. Siding with cringe Logan Paul. He forgot the reason why we supported him.
It wasn't a good fight, just a bunch of hugging. No one is a winner, it just wasn't an entertaining fight with little action from both fighters. Ksi is not helping himself with this video where he's just being sore
Learn how to swing first 🤖
Dude desperately explaining why he hasn’t “fallen off” yet being such an obsessed weirdo talking about random clips of Tommy? n then talking about his child and gf trying to stir some agenda like there’s some domestic neglect🤣 if I know any female I know she was 100% there to see Chris brown too ahahahaha, fallen off or not this is pathetic, man up move on wet wipe
Mate you just need a break. Like a long break with the family and get over the outcome of Fury. Life is way more than that, nothing makes me feel better knowing you're well rested after 6 years of hustling. Don't go that path of overworking that you ain't got time for your own mental health and family. You're a good person don't forget that, You matter too.
You literally won that fight
Not gonna miss ksi, but gonna miss jj olatunji
L
Yeah just alot of excuses and him making a big embarrassment to himself. So delusional and pathetic human being. Use to love this guy but I really cannot stand him anymore. He just physically makes me sick now. Such a big hard man thinking he's tough and likes to just bully people around. We see right through you ksi and you've lost our respect.
Thank god u lost
Dude really got that Dillon Danis in him
He really did shock the world.
Nah the insulting him as a father is just as bad tbh and straight hating on him for hanging with Chris brown jj is actually weird deji was right about everything he said about him during there beef from his ego and all dat
Just admit the loss
everyone tripping in these comments, first half of the video proved his point, man did lose that fight
I will fight ksi. Just to lose ((i know I would)) just so I can beat him at handling defeat.  Now that's a sneaky w
Man jj. There's no "it's not me it's the ksi persona" excuce anymore it's you  this is you. You have a ego problem. Your acting less like a youtuber and more of a egotistical celeb.  You've singlehandedly made Jake pual look 10X better than you through your ego alone. It's self destructing and it'll end up being your downfall. The side men's downfall as well.
Most embarrassing video you’ve ever made man. Let it go faaakinnn el
Tuff
fuck ksi. i was a fan since 2018
Pathetic
Ksi got robbed
A 30 year old man telling young impressionable kids to go and berate another man over losing FAIRLY on paper is something I did not expect to see. I genuinely thought, like many, that you matured over the years but if this is how you act then clearly you've been online too much and have not lived real life. Shocking behaviour. I am 25.. Shocking.
Bro I get you lost I was rooting for Tommy but this happened 2 months ago take the l and fight someone else and improve
Sidemen ❌❌ YES MEN ✔✔
I've always respected the hard work KSI puts into everything he does. He definitely deserves everything that he has earned. But this is just toxic. At age 30 he has already achieved more than most of us will in our entire lives. That's respectable. But being this toxic to Tommy and telling his audience to harass him over a boxing match is way too much. His young audience is impressionable, and KSI's inability to show strength and humility in a loss is a bad look. I hope he does some introspecting and realizes that this is not it.
He literally keeps digging holes for him self. no he didn’t win the fight, and he needs to just mature and accept failure. The judges judged the fight mainly off raw boxing skill “as it is boxing after all” which Ksi didn’t bring to the table, jumping around with star jumps won’t impress the judges and most of Ksis strikes came from in the clinch anyways as he would attack then clinch then throw hits with in the clinch which there for made it difficult for Tommy to actually stand up and box. Little bit delusional as ksi hyped him self up leading up to the fight, which made him believe he already won the fight before he even stood in the ring. this is why he’s struggling to bite and chew the loss, For 30 years old there’s no need to act like this man am half his age and I know this, I wish he comes to his senses soon.
This was honestly a tough watch, tommy really broke this man mentally
i can get arguing over a fight before hand to get under there skin but when u say go after his family u just think ur better than him because people tell you things ur ego needed this check or u would be some rich spoilt twat who has got everything in life by luck no hard work
he’s not being a sore looser he was robbed and is obviously gonna feel like this he deserved to win
You lost to a guy with no rhythm
I feel like Logan Paul is rubbing off on him 😮
His ego got to him🤦‍♂️ what a bitch
ha ha you lost you are no G.O.A.T because even the actual G.O.A.Ts of boxing can admit they lost a fight here and there because a true G.O.A.T knows how to swallow the hardest pill to swallow pride when they lost
Fakest laugh. Must be hard to laugh properly when you are so butt hurt
Aye at least when ksi was a nerd he was real and didn’t carry an ego 🥺
Damm so i guss am i hater been a fan since 2014 am fucking old now 31 but damn unsubscribe
Plz plz plz plz
That fight was garbage....you both are losers, most of the fight was just 🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂 But KSI should have won in my opinion, i felt he got the most hits in, but i couldn't tell because the whole fight was  🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂
You're 30. Attacking a mans child and family. A man whos younger than you. Encouraging your fans to push hate his way. Scumbag behavior.
Just accept the loss. Needed a humbling anyway...
Your forehead can probably fight better than you
We all knew you were going to lose. You don’t even know how to be a real boxer. Learn how to put your hands up and actually defend and maybe trade some punches and not  trying to jump around like a hyper add kid that can’t focus on one thing. And we all know you’re only doing it for the bag because your not a real fighter. I tried giving you and Jake Paul a chance, and at this point Jake Paul would slap you around like nothing.
Bro probably bang himself. His ego is so huge
What a loser lol
just accept your loss, you arrogant loser
INSTANT DISLIKE
You got humbled 😂😂
This is sad
Its just a fight bro, why you crying? 🤨
Ksi can u make dbl videos pls
“Go to his comment section and remind him that he lost cus this hurt my ego bad 🥺”
Typical sore loser
This guy needs to be humbled like Logan Paul was from the forest situation, dude needs to understand he’s not who he thinks he is
Ayo JJ ya shouldve won and tbh i woulda done the same, call me a kid or a glazer in the comments i acc dont care, and  ik you are so sym in advance
He really is just a darker logan paul. Both are delusional
You're   clapped.
Disappointed. Nerd
Just take the L and move on
Im so glad hes getting so much hate, hes delusional , and everyone sees it, havent seen a coment section like this in so long thats negative! its good! hopefully he sees it cuz he sounds like an absolute idiot
We rate you KSI.   But now you know, most of tbe crowd are just waiting for you to stumble. Thats what this comment section is, haters getting their 2cents in.  Get back on that horse and win some more blud. Youre still an inspiration, still a beast, get up champ. Fucking get on!
It would have been better if he came back and reacted to GTA 6, said nothing while reacting (like xQc) and called it a day than this peace of shit video. Major L
This is embarrassing
work hard to be an engineer. being a boxer is useless
Living proof of hardwork and dedication’s existence
lil bro thinks he is beerus 💀💀
Stop telling your fans to harass this guy, that shits immature as fuck. You cant be named "KSI" if you lack the integrity part...
اول مره اشوف ksi يستنقص من نفسه ويقلل من نفسه عشان ضايق تومي وغير كذا عشان ماقدر ياثر عليه فالحلبه صار يتكلم عن حياة تومي الشخصيه ويحاول يسمم حياته عشان يبي يضره بأي طريقة  مؤسف انك ksi صار كذا
you lost.
Tommy broke you
You won that. Head up.
Imagine he was like yeah I lost bc I’m black 💀
YOU LOST BUD 💀💀💀💀💀
Lol Ksi getting cancelled for this shit
L
This is so embarrassing jsut take the loss bud
You’re 30 years old and you have better things to do in life. Accept your loss and grow up
KSI is such a ego maniac. Bro needs to he humbled bad. He lost thats it!
Typical ksi ego bigger than his forehead
This was straight up petty you even insulated him and made it personal
Pathetic
Look. I still don’t agree with the decision. You gotta move on though, people will hate no matter what. Love KSI.
This guy is legit 30 years old and he’s acting like a 5 year old.  Grow up.
You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain
30 years of age
This poor excuse for a man just showed his true colors
Its the biggest robbery of all time of course ksi is mad he got robbed of winning every round but 5 + point deduction
Imagine in the same video telling your fanbase to hate on someone, and bringing up their parenting skills. Shame on you KSI. We always knew you were an idiot but at age 30 we thought we might see progress, but if anything you’re going backwards.
I've been watching Sidemen and MoreSidemen for a long time, and I've noticed something off about JJ. I have no idea, but he looks just tired of all this. JJ, honestly, take a break or something because it's tearing you down and making you do bad decisions.
😂😂Ksi surrounds himself with yes men
Nobody is going to do that JJ. how could you ask this to your fans?? You are still the Nerd in that picture you have never grown into a man. legacy......lol
JJ, you honestly made a big mistake. You should have waited for the result of the appeal before posting this video.
Trained so hard to do star jumps
KSI really lost his way after corporatism has swallow him with all the Prime deals and collabs that have been happening. Really fell off in the recent year after being consumed by successes that one loss made him go nuts
https://youtube.com/shorts/Qpd_ESAWodg?si=sqUtGkMF7ehskDpv
accept the loss already
Damm is hard to watch 😂 cringe asf JJ  for some reason cant accept a loss
bro i dont know man maybe fury used some naughty money power cuz he knew he would loose cuz like there is no way that he won fury is an asshole man
Dude for real you lost as someone that done boxing under an ex champion it wasn’t good and I hate saying that cause I don’t like tommy but he handled the fight a lot better then you I noticed way to many issues from dropping the hands the punching after all the talk you weren’t touching hits that landed   And then you try use your history against his like Jesus man he put fought you it sucked work hard go again but sitting there going your a boxer….. isn’t that what you are mate you trained with specialist camps wit food made diet handled and you say ohh my life was in the way…. Most boxers have normal jobs mate we have to work a 9-5 yet we don’t earn millions a year from it   Grow up this is how your gonna loss support stop acting like your showing us we can do anything like nah you have more support them most guys in there first few years six years my diet wasn’t handled I was just suggested foods and I still had to go to school   Be humble you lost move on before you become logan
I’m not going to lie, this was hilarious 😭💀
Ah the comment section full of people not understanding what its like to take a big loss. Especially in cases where you should have won.
Deduction for too many star jumps.
The man is a chump. Learn some respect for the sport and for yourself. Give an unknown a chance to beat you. Ksi v Windmill 04/23
Just the fact that he put a “?” at the end of this title speaks volumes about his delusion
Such an L vid. He really shows his true colors on this one.
Just realized how immature Ksi is Little crybaby
I thought jake Paul was a 100% idiot, and he might be, but at least he took a loss like a man and didn’t try to abuse his influence among children. Lost a lot of respect for JJ after this video, and you’ve lost a long term fan
For an experienced  boxer, Tommy isn't that good. KSI exposed that.
To be fair,  neither one of you won the "fight" which in reality was an embarrassment to the sport
You had your 1st loss and your crying like a child, lost a bit of respext for you man wont lie
Leave his kid out of your mouth, bigot
Love the fake laugh… pathetic
Never say you’re gonna shock the world lol
The judges can’t bare to tarnish the fury family name, that’s why tommy won lol
ksi your the gayest guy
Seriously
It’s a shame he is this salty I think a lot of people were proud of his performance and many did view him as the winner There was no need to be this butthurt and he is just sullying the respect he had
Probably the first time I’ve looked at Ksi and thought…”maybe quadeca was on to something”
Speed is gonna kick your ass
This was painful to watch, this is the KSI i feared he'd become once he lost for the first time and honestly its even worse than I expected, telling your fans to harass someone I mean wtf man. You lost because of refs sure that sucks but you're attacking your opponent for it? That's like blaming a player for a penalty not given instead of the ref during a football match and then attacking that player for "being a bad father" and enjoying his life, and then telling the fans of your team to harass, insult and berate that player rather than directing your anger towards the ref who is the one that made the decision not to award a penalty, see how stupid that sounds? That's exactly what you've just done with this video
Man you deserve the break, youve earned it and i hope they decide that you won the fight
KSI fucking humble yourself, jesus
Where the fuck did my jj go? He’s acting like he used to when he lost a pink slips. Seriously man wtf
Really dude
Guys stop being so mean I cant like every comment 💀
You guys gotta remember this video has been edited. I imagine he said worse stuff than this
Jesus is Lord, accept Him today because He loves younajd died for you❤
Imagin this comment section if Jj's appeal goes through. 😂
Keep hugging bro
Definition of a sore loser
Man uploading his coping session to the internet
wtf is he doing?
At first I forsure thought u got robbed of the win but now it just seems like u lost the way your acting
I like Ksi but dude seems butt hurt
Not to mention, you punched man in the back of the head just as much and hugged him the entire time!
Bro, you needed the ego to be bruised, your god complex is insane! I was a massive fan for years but your ego has become too much to watch. Its cringe how shameful this video is, wake up
I ain't gonna try and defend you on this one, sorry fam
This is hard to watch, almost childish.
To be honest ksi win
KSI man Just get well soon
Millions thought you lost, post those videos you 🤡
Jj 'big baby' olatunji
Bro getting cooked in these comments
“Nerdy FIFA player”? Man you haven’t been that person for more than I’d say 8 years. Since then you just became more narcissistic and can’t even accept that you put a lot of effort for this fight. Stop acting like you didn’t train for the fight, he won, get over it. It was your event, it wasn’t rigged in any way and it was just the two of you in the ring. You can’t claim to be a Nerdy FIFA player when at the same time you call yourself a beast and in another level. He’s done with you and was just doing his job. You really sound delusional. I didn’t care for who won the fight but seeing you act like this, you had that loss coming. Nerdy FIFA player who’s just actually a narcissistic millionaire, you’re not who you were 8+ years ago.
I guess KSI here is mentally gone 😂😂😂
Now fight a real fighter not a amateur
You lost, stick to boxing nobodies and youtubers don't fight against real boxers and you can keep your ego intact
Izzy’s opinion doesn’t even matter
Well yeah so u lost. So what? Win the next one. Be big, Be great. Be humble. You keep forgetting the humble part.
Nigga learn to take an L and move on. It’s just one fight you lost 😂
Bro is a sore loser 😂
So many ksi meatriders in chat crazy
Felt like Logan ego has transferred to KSI when he won their boxing match
The dude acts like my little sis when she’s told to put what she wants back on shelf when I shop with her 😂
deji is a bigger man than you, learn a thing or two from your own blood and accept the lost with some humility, until then you aint a man
This whole video is like an ego shield
The judges didn't take shit from a nigga, you were a joke in there.
LSI
Jj whether there’s a conspiracy or whatever it may be you lost a fight. You need To get over it now you’re incredibly salty as everyone can tell but you’re doing yourself no favours by saying I should’ve won because people will just keep coming back to you saying well you lost that’s the end of it get over it it’s embarrassing
Tommy beat you fair and square weak pissssy
My goodness even your own Prime partner took his L against you better than you took your L against Tommy Fury….. Ouch🫢
if chael sonnen and DJ are saying KSI won, KSI won
You was grabbing him the whole time maybe if you was not swinging wild and clinching you would have won take the L like a man and be humble!
Just because people thought you won the actual judges did their job and that's what you need to accept
U used to hate the Paul brothers. And u ended up becoming what u hated. Asking ppl to harass another man because he beat u in a fair fight is something that not even the Paul brothers have ever done. U sold your authenticity for money and fame and don’t even produce entertaining content anymore. Frankly the signs were always there,from the days u used to bully Dax but at least then u had the benefit of the doubt because u could argue he came at u first. Truly ashamed I ever considered myself your fan
Judges scored it, as a loss man. It was a boxing match. In terms of wins.... look at what you've achieved in your life. In terms of 'Legacy'.... Jesus, please don't let this completely taint your success and character. Suck it up.
For the first time EVER I don't agree with you jj  JJ you just told your millions of fans to go and berate someone else. That phrase only turned YOUR FANS  against you.
What KSI Did wrong here: told fans to critisize other person who he lost to and brought in the "Family" Card which is none of his business.  What did he do right: justified moves/reviewed the fight and stated his and most of the peoples vision on the fight, he shown what type of person Tommy is (like he did with Jake and everyone respected it) and raised the appeal. Dont forget how much of a scam was Gib vs Holden fight (Said it was a draw after Gib threw almost twice more punches)  To Summarise: Yes it hurts him that he lost and it is difficult to get over it (especially after post vid with "im gonna shock the world" curse) but he is trying his best. If something really meant for someone and person lost it then the person will need to go through 3 stages: sorrow, anger and acceptance and it seems he is midway anger and acceptance as he smiles but still cannot accept the outcome. This is normal in human life and like KSI said "Life is Unfair" but it really take time to recover or regenerate from something really meaningful. You might be right that he was attacked "mentally" but in life dont we all get this?   KSI, If you reading this, be better or bigger man and take time. You worked 10 years on yourself to get where you are now, and it can take 10 second to loose this. I wish you best.
You lost the fight man. U lost me after this video to.
I thought JJ losing would at least humble him a little but I guess I was wrong
Ksi calls out Andrew Tate - https://youtube.com/shorts/5yNxAvXnRas?si=TG1rVwxM1EGl07t8
🤡
Clown just take the loss like a man
Yea man, you’re trippin
Yeah you lost. Accept it dude.
Whether you deserved the win or not, let it go. You’ve got ‘LEGACY’ tatted across your back but do shit like this😂🤡
‘You don’t neeed this as much as I do!!’
This guy is terrible. Doesn’t matter how you cut it, just terrible. If you look up to him, you’re a dummy.
People forget. It isn’t just this. It’s also the fact that literally the fight before this he elbowed a man into oblivion and never even bothered to check up on him after, or even acknowledge later that he did accidentally elbow him.
Waited all this time and then still said he won the fight 😂😂😂😂
Bro I love JJ but it’s true what Andrew Tate once said “you know your friends say a lot about you Aiden” KSI is turning to Logan Paul 😭😭😭 please don’t go this route JJ
I’m 16 years old and yet I never have tought I would consider myself more mature than 30 year old…but well here I am…I know I sound as egotistical now as JJ but I have never in my life have considered to bring in my enemy’s private life because of game that I lost. That’s just too childish. I even remember when I was like 8-13 years old I used to do that but I had other very personal reasons for that and it wasn’t because of losing game it was because my enemy actually bullied me and threatened me for years to point where it actually effected my life and I needed to seek therapy afterwards. But if this man can’t handle simple loss I can’t imagine how he would handle someone’s passing. Honestly this video just showcases his true nature (wich I saw pretty long time ago) but just hoped it was other way around my thoughts.  Buddy just lost subscriber. Like this comment if you unsubscribed.
KSI needs to learn how to cope. He can believe he won if he wants to, but fucking move on from it.
Who cares tbh it was a shit fight anyway
Ksi is delulu
Always thought collabing with Logan Paul was odd, but after watching this I get it.
You win some you lose some.
Why is everyone hating on him? He’s speaking his mind leave him alone
Absolutely embarrassing 😂😂
Disgraceful
Remember when everyone got mad for calling out Deji for going against his brother ego, but now they see ksi ego become a huge rollercoaster going downhill😭😭 lol
To the people calling JJ "NARCISSIST", cannot be more wrong! JJ have been helping alot of people, and with no "content" made out of it!
Videos/reactions like this make me really appreciate the growth and development you have by starting a sport young and riding the waves with Ws and Ls young. Boxers usually have hundreds of amateur fights and go through these emotions. Usually finding some sort of professionalism and maturity, especially in taking losses.  I think it’s a good example how these YouTube boxers can be detrimental to the sport. No that there is a ‘right or wrong’. No fans want to see shit like this. Run it back and get the W if you’re that motivated. To literally tell your fans to berate your opponent when all they did was get the decision is insane. Also, getting into his personal life… cmon.
This was honestly a tough watch.
blud needa cope harder just take your loss like a man 💀
Very poor taste.... A true man learns to take defeat graciously even if you don't believe the result yourself. KSI telling his fans to berate another person is just sad.   Move on...
NGL Tommy wanting to fight Roy Jones JR is actually shameful like KSI said😂
LMAO dude cant get over his loss, not a good look man, when fighters lose theyre world championship they dont pull this lol they get back in the gym n work harder  plus he  just hugged him the whole fight idk how that could warrant a win sparring "demons doesnt = sympathy W and his comments are full of comments of saying he lost because all ur fans are 10 year olds who barley know what boxing is lol
Bro always keep looking forward
Video by Tyler Cooke  https://youtu.be/r7wV8YvFhac?feature=shared
Take the loss as a man bro
Absolute loser 😂
Seriously? A 30 year old man still crying about this loss. This makes me respect Jake Paul more as he not a lil man baby like KSI.
I worked hard is such a lame and childish excuse, acting as if Tommy didn't work hard too.  KSI is so pathetic.
Bum
KSI Try not to have an EGO bigger than his Forehead Challenge *(NIGGMPOSSIBLE)*  Oh btw just a reminder that this Man(child) is *30+ YEARS OLD*
What a tool.
People were saying that he needs to lose to get humbled. No he needs to get knocked the f out otherwise if he loses on points he will always think that he won. That's how big his ego is at this point
Life isn't fair my man
Wow this man deserves a better community turning their back on him like this
Im trying to figure out why people like this clown!
Win or lose ksi learn from ur mistakes and keep going don't let ego control u. BTW u should do mma
JJ I’ve been a huge fan of you but you lost and fair or not that’s that. Telling your fans to berate a grown man is crazy. Your ego is on another level. Where is the old JJ?
I’ve been a ksi fan 4 years. Years… but I’ll admit he lost the fight fair n square the man’s completely blinded by his ego
Can someone explain the controversy with KSI's ego?
Its crazy, he could've fixed his image if he just humbled himself and was gracious in defeat. But he couldn't put his ego aside and is now whining like a child.🤦‍♂️
Either you die a hero or live long enough to become the villain. I was a ksi fan for years, but I don’t think I can support him anymore.
He did star jumps, he hugged. Of course he won the huggie star-jumpy competition thingy.  They were boxing? Oh. Then he lost pretty emphatically.
Jeez man, this is disgusting. How warped has fame and money made your mind? Look at yourself objectively and be better.
The cope 😭 what an L
This is not the JJ ik🥲👍🏻
KSI ignore all the haters in the world and in your YT comment section I do believe you did get robbed and I hope that the fucking appeal doesn’t take too long hope your doing all better now you did won that fight it’s just the postcards and the judges are racist and complete assholes for not paying attention. #KSIGOTROBBED #KSISHOULDHAVEWONAGAINSTTOMMY FURRY I love you Jj never quit YT man, and your right life is unfair but we move on. That’s what being referred to me aswell. Never quit goat 👑 I still believe you did won the fight against Tommy matter fact you did win but the judges just couldn’t let it happen 😭 love u man forever I’m your biggest fan ❤️ keep doing what you doing peace ✌️
coping much?
Respect for fighting but don't be sour about a loss Adversity is the greatest of virtues You might discover that one day   What ever you do be humble
Crazy to me how people are now noticing how much of a tool he is, I said this when he beat Logan that he if he lost he wouldve moaned a million times more than Logan did but all his bumboys are too blinded to see how arrogant he is.
The fact Francis Ngannou took his loss like a champ (even tho most people would be FURIOUS if they were him) and JJ lost fair and square and is coping unbelievably hard, even tho he literally has had more than 2 months to accept it, is just the saddest thing ever man
What a shit video couldn’t just take the loss lmao nice to know people can see ur true colours tho 😂
Ffs 😮‍💨
You can critique JJs response including the fans but to call him a sore loser is unfair. Shots landed were the same going 3-3. That with a negative takeaway on Tommy should be an objective JJ win. Criticisms on going to fans, fair play. Sore loser comments or hypocrite comments for what he said about Logan are totally unfair. Leaves out the context that JJ actually got shafted on this scorecard. Kinda negates the sore loser thing to me as he should’ve won. Definitely shouldn’t send the fan patrol. That’s wrong, but the scorecard is also wrong, two things can be true at once😂😂
This guy’s personality came out of its shell after this loss…how can someone be this delusional???? Spending time with Logan Paul doesn’t doing well thing to you JJ
Makes perfect sense watch t he fight running and hugging all fight
Clearly refs should of deducted a point from all the hugging you did they did is the fight befor
JJ, there was no need to go for his personal life mann. What you've done sucks.
No worry.. you’re a winner.. and slim is still a looser.. that’s how it works sometimes… you unfortunately lost 😢
sore loser man, fan since 2015 never thought that I would see you this way ever. GROW UP MAN!
This sad 💀💀💀💀
pity
Accept the L, congratz the official winner even if you think you should've won, call for a rematch, work on your weak spots... ...That's at least what a real sportsman would do.  But this pathetic reaction? After couple of weeks time to cope and be a man about it? Nah you're embarassing yourself.  You lost a fan lil' brother! Glad to see some sanity here in the comment section, too! 👏
Acting like a little child bro  weren’t you clowning on jake for appealing his fight? Look at you now, just take the lost and move on , 30 year old can’t handle a loss lmao
You lost. Take the L like a man not like a little loser. If you fought him again youd lose again.
Deji accepted defeat every time he lost. I think it’s ridiculous how JJ can’t do the same. Sure, it’s okay to think you won and that you were robbed by the judges. But targeting your opponent and being a sore loser isn’t good sportsmanship at all.
Just do a rematch
i feel bad for ksi cause end off he won that fight or was at least a draw so just shows how rigged boxing is is disgusting
The amount of pettynes in this video is astounding. This kid deserves to become an absolute papuer just to learn some humility.
Man, I thought he was a respectful man and good man, sad to see how kiddish he is
Even the slaves accepted the fact
such a manchild grow up
I have a feeling that this video is going to be used against him later on.
When he wins he’s a MONSTER, a NIGHTMARE, HE JUST BUILT DIFFERENT. But when he loses he’s just a nerd YouTuber, how could he win if he’s just a YouTuber?
Goofy clown he looks like black IT
This should be your most disliked video and for good reason, this is ridiculous
Cope harder you absolute melt 🤡
ksi so lucky the dislike button is no more
How does this manchild have any fans
L
Birds of a feather flock together. Logan & JJ could use some better people around them.
Dam yall on his ass but i still fuck w bro
I would have gained so much respect for ksi if he took the loss on the chin and got back on his horse but nah he behaved like a fucking 7 year old
Ksi, this is pathetic, disgusting and very disrespectful, win or lose, you shouldnt be telling your fans to verbally attack a man, what is happening to you?
Ksi thinks he’s above people he doesn’t take his fans seriously he joins with a know scammer and promote a unhealthy drink to kids non the less and know he’s getting karma This Will Be His Downfall KARMA
There are a lot of softies in the comments over exaggerating and blowing things out of proportion. KSI and Fury are gonna be fine. You want to talk about internet harassment, look at the comments you posted. On top of that I see nothing wrong with trying to correct something you find error in. Hopefully the appeal goes his way
Ksi I still fuck with you pal don’t worry ahahaha
These comments are brain dead he literally said there’s people already in tommy fury’s comments and to keep it up. Yall acting he brought them there. And cmon YA MUST NOT SEEN THE FIGHT
These comments are high-key reality checks for KSI it seems. He’s been arrogant and cocky and not humble it seems like to all of y’all!?
CHILD OF A MAN LMAOOO
Your petty
A bunch of peeps saying KSI asked his viewers to bash Tommy. Could you guys point to that section in the video?
Comment section sponsored by Tommy Fury gang 🤡
You are not my boy, so shut up.
i wish i could see diss likes
This guy is a proper sore loser
A lot of people in this comment section can’t see he was clearly joking laughing about people berating tommy and a lot of the things he said are true he only had 3 years to train he is mainly a YouTuber and tommy didn’t knock him out and it is embarrassing for Tommy 😂
Well guys just report the video as hateful .....we don't want a bunch of kids to go and harasses another person for no reason . Hopefully YouTube can do something about it
I feel like comments are getting too personal with videos that KSI posts. If he entertains you he entertains you, keep supporting if he entertains and if he doesn’t just don’t.
You say you’re the best boxer and no one can beat you. But you then say Tommy couldn’t finish a YouTuber who has been boxing for 5 years. You like to change the narrative so it fits your agenda. Lost all my respect and honestly you’re just a massive bellend now
Tommy Fury managed to do what Eminem did to MGK. Completely and utterly destroyed him mentally and spiritually to the point of humiliation and I honestly feel bad for JJ. I hope one day he self reflects and finally find God.
Nah bruh wheres the sportsmansip in this... if you truly respect and love the sport you should know what sportsmanship is.The true definition of what being a narscisistic sore loser. asking your fanbase to attack someone you lost to is not cool bro instead of respecting him and giving him the props of him winning he asks his viewers to harass him. Its not competetiveness anymore...
Ksi, your 30 year old man act your age , who with me. And a other thing never ever talk about Tommy child, family or even Legacy.
KSI has turned into such a narc
this guy is so delusional its insane
KSI seeking validation
This is shocking from KSI. Encouraging fans to keep posting on tommys insta and even harass him in public saying he didn’t win the fight.   It was a very close fight and KSI - you were not good and didn’t look anything close to a boxer.  Sore loser. You’d never see this from a proper sportsman.
You lost mate
dont know how people didnt see how narcisistic KSI really is
as a wise man once said, being a sore loser is even worse than being a loser
Stage 1: Denial
bro you lost and it sucks move on
Finally people realising how deluded and egoistic this mf is. I prayed for times like this 🤣🤣🔥🔥
Joe Weller dancing in his room ahahah
Fight me you mug, i challenge you!!
I dont think it is shamefull for Tommy fury that he didnt get the knock out, after all he was fighting someone with the only goal of lasting through the fight by hugging him.
Why are people hating on KSI? Because he is successful. Tommy Fury must be reminded that he lost to a YouTuber.
KSI won that fight! KSI was robbed!
Bro just remember the days you were a beta bum playin fifa going crazy on emelie hesky long shots. To making millions, success and takin care of ur family. Get over yourself and your ego. Humble yourself before GOD gives you something for real to cry about. Watched you occasionally for 10 years and this is a sad sight from a man who has everything sorted in life.
JJ you will win vs jake paul
he really said that he came out better after the fight than Tommy did. yea jj i dont think Tommy broke down and cried after the fight😂
Nah bro this is a huge L. Never thought you would go this low 😔
The biggest sore loser 😂😂😂😂
What a guy. If you can’t win in the ring just beat the guys moral on social media. 😂😂
Return to cotton business and you will make it far
really loves ksi reddit fanbase rather "kSi aRmy" or whatever braindead teenager fans called it
This is proof that Ksi is stuck in buble of his supporters and doesn’t dare look at the other side which is why he seems so delusional here
tf happened to jj? Did he go back to his 2016 self or just hanging out with logan he slowly became trashy or maybe just the facade is disappearing
So u lost lad that’s life grow up and accept u didn’t win, I was inspired by u to be a better person get in shape and try get a better state of mind but after watching this video I don’t think I can support u anymore blud, u are a influencer u are suppose to be a role model but no u petty and acting like a spoilt brat
2:58 3:00
Is not about doing it yourself, its figuring out the process and most things we expect to come with an instruction manual so blindly walking into a potential mine field no smart person will do
CLOWN!

You can’t fight bro just stop crying to your fans😂
https://youtu.be/lPBELvObIDc?si=91uReWWPnV5YeGuF
this is just coping
Some of the worst music ever released
Can’t believe i was a fan of you
Seeing you lose makes me happy, never felt such happiness seeing you lose, you losing gives me nourishment
Should’ve just took the L like a grown man , disappointed
Might be the most embarrassing person to walk the earth
Loser
Eish, Acceptance is something that can allow you to grow. Big ups JJ
Ksi is a grown as man probably 30 or so of age and is acting like a todler who can't get their way.
hella childish. dissapointed in JJ
Fell off hard
Unsubbed
Wyf is that awkward ass laugh
I don’t think you nor Tommy won, if anything it should have been a draw.
yo shupt up dude now you posing as a youtuber with 3 years of boxing experience and a fifa player. you didnt have to talk about his kid and judging him. you are evil man
You should make a dragon ball legends vid since your back on the game or do a collab with the dragon ball legends youtubers like nanogenix or goresh
KSI YOU LOST 😂😂😂
take the loss.
Mr kfc
Man ksi has fallen down to this.
Take out the ? From the video title
this guys become an absolute joker what a video
good shit jj, u dont have to make fun of him either. both of you did really well! obviously I think you won jj cuz tommy is an actual boxer and w ur 3 yrs training you  have achieved so much. but at the same time it isnt his fault he won, its the judges who decided. end of the day you take the W but no hate for tommy.
Look its logan paul twin😂 clowns 🤡
its ok jj stop cry. you are better than him <3
Video back fired haha
Stop buying likes
Started out think he was just a sore loser but as it went on I just lost bare respect for him. He's 30 years old, his fans are kids and he's telling his fans to harass Tommy. Plus talking about his Mrs and kid.....nah Fury boxed poorly but Ksi was a joke and really showed the other side to him here
Ksi: Stil depressing about the fight   Tommy; literally move on from it
Salt
Ahh I see why so many people dont like this narcissist.
Thank god he didn’t pull the race card and say Tommy won because he’s white 🤣
LSI
You didn’t win it was close tho
Can I just say JJ hasn’t changed at all he’s just going back to who he is as his ego got in the way and you can’t blame him with all the attention and money he gets just because he is being himself so why everyone hating?  I get why people annoyed but clearly you guys aren’t real fans to begin with and yeah he did win coz the point deduction from a pro boxer whose been playing this sport most his life is embarrassing but so is JJ meltdown but I can’t blame him and neither should you! Yes he overrated but it’s called an ego death it happens and all these people saying he’s telling kids to harass a grown man is stupid he’s expressing he’s opinion and he’s clearly joking! REAL fans will understand
MAN GOT DEPRESSED YALL RLLY LOOK UP TO THIS GUY JAKE TOOK THE L LIKE A MAN KSI KICKED A SCREEN AND WAS WHINING 😂😂😭I’m not a hater I’m just saying he didn’t take the L like a man
This guy is such melt he even bothers with the melts all melts speed and fucking Logan Paul the side chicks as well just boring now u ask me clearly just recycling same shit for money
“Boxing for about 3 years” but was training for weller 6 years ago
Omg KSI...
The old KSI is what made us all fans…
brother... your fighting style is jumping jacks and hugging.... that does not win fights, and you didnt win this fight
This is why Jake Paul is better than you in everything😂
JJ remember this  "  not every day will be your day. " You seriously need to find faith through god because you clearly don't know how to behave when you're losing.   i will unsubscribe for a while, until you  actually come up and use your brain for a second i will be back but i can't watch you anymore, i can't take you seriously anymore.
This is why no one likes u anymore
You where robbed hope you get the win on the appeal
This is disgusting of u KSI
He’s changed..  😢
Ksi just wants a rematch
U was hugging and most of your punch didn’t land mostly its draw
People acting like its surprising KSI is a bellend is funny as fuck to me.
mate youve fucking lost accept it and move on. Talking about tommy fury's family was too far. I lost all the respect i had for you. You really did reveal your true colours after you lost huh.
Yeah i mean i been watching JJ for like 7-8 years, back when playing Fifa 96 was a thing and Lamborghini had like 10mil views, and it is clear he has some maturing to do if he wants to be respected, cause alot of what he says nowadays does at the very least give off bratty, immature energy that any self-respecting person won't want to induce themselves to. Like okay you're frustrated at the loss, and i think more people than not will agree if you said " i feel its not representative of the true result and i feel it was a harsh decision" but to bring up parenting and shit in a video in an attempt to deminish someone's character after you physically fought, and then say to people go shame him is just in itself shameful. People are quick to judge and form opinions, so i would say he isnt necessarily a bad guy, cause he's got good qualities, but he needs to do some thinking if he wants to continue to be loved by the masses. The ego shadows over the light of his character.
Ksi is right he shouldve won by unanimous hugs 🙏🏼
Look, I had watched most of the video and I had paused it and came to the comments. I was disappointed. I, as a big fan of JJ (KSI), was completely on his side this entire video and was confused about these hate comments. However, after choosing to finish the video I have gained understanding of the situation and why people are hating on what he said. I hate to admit it, but I have to agree. Telling your fanbase to berate, disturb, and harass someone (No matter the circumstance) is childish and wrong.  I understand that you are angry and confused about your lost, but this is when you need to show people the most that you have the sell-control to have sportsmanship.  And I agree that you won the fight, but you barley won. You both did quite terrible in all honestly. I hope you take some more time to reflect not just on your fight, but also this video. Understand that telling kids to harass someone for beating you, which btw is their JOB to do, is embarrassing to say the least.  Love you JJ, but you need to grow up.
Tommy hit you so hard in the head you’ve lost the plot because what is this? Disgusting, even with this strong belief that “you won” bringing his wife and kid into it is stooping really low. Disappointed
He's really got to get his head out of his arse. I've said it once and I'll say it again, he's displaying serious Logan Paul behavior. Surrounding himself with yes men, hug the entire fight, acting like a sore loser by trying to appeal the fight. He's also a giant hypocrite man.
When are u fighting Jake I thought you were fighting him this year
Lmfao stay mad, u still lost bro
You lost bro, you know nothing about boxing, put ur ego to the side. You lost…simple as that
IS THIS DUDE STILL TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED A MONTH AGO? I CANT 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tommy definitely whooped ur ass bro 😂
It’s okay to lose, but what’s most important is how you carry yourself when you lose. And this ain’t it JJ
This honestly aint it, been watching JJ and the sidemen since yr6/7 which was 10+ years ago and it was inspiring watch him grow but ever since his stepped back into boxing its been getting really sour and its hard to support someone that behaves this way. If your friends wont tell you then your audience will. Do better man
Just take the L and move on, man. Stop with the excuses
"holy shitttt there is a black guy on the screeen!!!!!!!!"   loooooool
Can yours all piss of ksi won tommy fury was doing back of head shout he never won bye points he was ment to come and win ment to show up he not on level of YouTube even YouTubers are on better level and him and ksi shoved Tommy fury ksi out land it him and got point of is well wish mean he won the fight like yours just guessing Tommy won fight watch the high lights and you see in first Round and round 2 ksi out lands him in both round he says he going to knock him out he not beat them properly they where both sliped decisions so he has right to file an appeal you can’t tell him what he can do or not at end of day it’s his choice and he can decide what you can do with a choice it’s not up to yours ok he did win fight I watch hall thing and saw tommy punched in back of head the hall time ksi was trying to Tommy of him and he kpet hold in on ksi was trying to let go dick heads jj won the fight air up is shit
Logan paul Effect
I think this fight could go ether way it could be draw I don’t know but ski you got to forget about this move on get better get stronger and become a better boxer that’s all I gotta say
my dog got into my prime and died, thanks...
You did Win That Fight
This is cringe. Couldn't finish watching. Sore losers are the worst.
Finally he agreed
You can see his fanbase CRUMBLING rn, it’s good that his fans are actually calling him out for this shit
We all knew we could never beat tommy, but this is just pathetic.
I genuinely believed that you were robbed and it was an unfair victory for Tommy before this vid, but all of that genuinely goes to waste by how you couldn’t accept a loss for once and had to talk about his fkn personal life and harassing him online/in-person just because of your sore ego. it’s acc crazy how a 30 yr old guy is telling an impressionable audience to go harass a 24 yr old dude and his private life over a fkn boxing match. Pathetic.
Ahahah highlights from you only hugging en jumping around as a idiot 😂
You couldn't knock him out. Simple
Nah man i see too much bs comments i really dont care that much im not fan to either of them i just like KSI fifa and funny videos "dont laught" and that type of content but yes this man has big ego its true but also its something he was really looking up to that match and he should have at least walked away with a draw so for everyone who is saying "accept it you lose" its very bad atitude towards the life i found all this comments instantly as people with lossers mentality. I agree he didnt have to go talking in this video about Tommy personal life and wife but i can also understand his frustration that profesional boxer and big favorite in this fight have to win on robbery. Heads up man lets hope decision will be overturned 💪💪💪
The guy should learn lesson from khabib
The guy is ego maniac from what I've seen
This is pathetic
Ksi wants punishment for this video its time youtube grew some balls and start acting when videos like this are posted. Discusting when tommy fury is a decent family man done no harm to nobody. It was the judges who made the call not fury.
Video by Dumpy   https://youtu.be/RuL6emINbrM?feature=shared
I can understand KSI not liking tommy and acting in the moment and see himself as the winner, he doesn't have to like Tommy but going out of his way to encurage his fans to keep going after tommy is just stupid and inmature, if tommy is not importent why even keep bringin him upp in the first place leave the guy be and let him live his life, KSI should move on and leav this be regardles if he lost, won or drew.
bro's on his sssniperwolf era
You lost... just learn more about boxing and how points are made and then rewatch your fight, you'll see why you lost
Bro everyone stop hating on KSI
You’ve let the ego get to your head. God, your team around you have made you feel invincible like you can’t lose or do wrong. You need a reality check and a new team who won’t suck you off and tell you you’re amazing for a subpar performance where whether you won or not? You had nothing exemplary to show your “dedication” to the sport. How can you as an egotistical man child believe that complaining about a win is more worth your time than focusing on your lackluster performance? You’ve got your priorities backward, and if you really wanted to beat Tommy fury? You wouldn’t have fallen under the delusion that you’re somehow like Deontay wilder and actually learned how to fight instead of aiming for one big shot every single time. You don’t have it in you, learn to box, stop whining, and come back when you actually have something to show for your “dedication”
huge win for tommy
the amount of likes on this video is seriously concerning.
He should be happy you cant see the dislike button anymore
Really man are you 30 fr lol 😂😂
After watching this, i respect Jake more for taking it like a man. It's not only Tommy who talked the big game, ksi also talked big and didn't back it up.
I saw the fight I thought you won this makes it an L
This guy is so petty lol
It’s incredible how Tommy destroyed Ksi mentally doing so little. Tommy not only won the fight, he took every ounce of sanity Ksi used to have when he was always winning
Ah yes, the guy who has been harassing Joe weller since their fight has picked a new target!
Ksi has lost his mind 😂😂
wow ...never knew ksi was such a sore loser... like , it doesnt matter if he won or not , but to just attack tommy fury seem such a shameful thing to do..
Tough watch JJ you’re a grown man take the loss and call for a rematch. Don’t be a little pussy.
You can’t box, odd footwork.
It probably would've been better if you just said you were kinda sad or whatever after you lost and that's why you haven't uploaded, which is natural, but to berating his personal life and telling your fans to do the same is kinda 😬😬... I'm a huge  fan but man that was really low.
Unsubscribed JJ, this was embarrassing
What is this? What’s going on here ? So this whole video is on dissing Tommy fury and pointing out that you’re better than him this is just pathetic
Still being a sore loser huh lol
make a try not to laugh challange but u lose 10k each time u laugh seems fair to me
Why not show the cringe clips where you promised to knock Tommy out and shock the world
Next time actually practice the sport of  🥊 instead of jumping and hugging the opponent. You’re a disgrace in and out the ring.
I've been watching u since I was 5 but now I'm 13, ur kind of annoying I understand the haters now.
Bro, you lost ONCE and this is how pathetic/petty you get. Just get over it JJ, you’re painting yourself as an immature man at 30 years of age.
What a disappointing performance I hope you do better next time
You’re not a good boxer and you lost. Pipe down
Okay now fight Jake and get it over with
you've became the very thing you've mocked 4 years ago
You just keep jumping stop jumping
7:31 telling your fans to riad someone because you lost a fight  2  months after you lost is super petty 😂
Him and jake Paul have actually switched places and Ksi is a sore losing bitch who lost
Bro YOU CANT BOX let it go bruv
Reminder. KSI shouldve been DQ after he did Rabbit punching , an illegal move in boxing. He shouldve been greatful for not getting bigger L before this video
Embarassing.... loser💯
Nah this vid aint it bruv. You need to heal brother
you didnt just loose bro. you didnt even box, you flapped your arms and clinched. you are actually so delusional to think you even came close to a victory. granted tommy was shit on the night but to win a boxing match you have to box... as an avid boxing fan i was legit embarrassed for you on your own behalf and that was before you opened your mouth crying about how you think you won... just watch the fight back bro. what you did in there was not boxing and what you are doing after honestly makes me not want to watch your content (including sidemen) which is honestly a shame because every other sidemen member is pretty cool apart from you. always complaining in every single video, complaining about loosing when it looks like you didnt even try. idk how you still have a fanbase if it wasnt for prime youd be washed up fr.
the thing is tho is you watched the fight all jj did was make the fight boring by clinching the whole time and throwing wack haymakers also claims he’s been boxing for three years but ksi vs joe weller was 2018
Wow. You screwed up pretty bad this time dude.
Szia Ksi, a barátaim azt gondolják rólam hogy rasszista vagyok mert vannak rasszista nagyon humoros megnyilvánulásaim és mert skinhead vagyok de ellenben szeretem a videóidat és egyáltalán nem zavar hogy koszos vagy! kérlek megmondanád a buta barátaimnak hogy nem vagyok rasszista? Puszi, anya!
Good to see you back JJ, hope you get better and enjoy your time.  Just don't forget about us that need to hear your laugh to make our dark lives a little brighter.
30 year old cry baby
You lost you tool
That horrible, "Duhuhuhuhuhuh" donkey laugh of yours is truly the cherry on top of the hatred cake I have for you.
You are all overreacting, re fucking lax
And this guy was standing against Andrew Tate, y’all know now what kind of crybaby he is 🤷🏼‍♂️
Seriously who likes this guy, he’s irritating asf.. go awayyy you lost get over it 🙆🏻‍♂️
Ksi weaponising his stupid fanbase shows a guy who is immature, spoilt and a massive ego. He is the same as logan paul.
Lol, Tommy burning all his match winnings on paid youtube comments and likes spamming this page. No one cares this much to be this invested in the result anymore.
Whomp whomp
JJ your the goat man
30 year old grown toddler/sumo wrestler crying over losing a boxing match due to excessive hugging.
He should just delete this vid
U lost kid
jj ive been watching you since i was 12 now im gonna be 18 a fully grown man but man im so dissapointed in you men  i thought you’d know better  i thought you’d never do something like this but here we are i hope you can accept the loss and move on from this or else this is the beginning of the end for you wish you all the best ❤
If the video ended at 2:30 it would have been okay..
Geez JJ I love you bro but this is some embarrassing shit. Don’t get me wrong, I know the feeling of losing but geez this is just whiney.
this is kinda embarrassing
You lost all my respect jj. Unsubscribed
Ksi cant just respectfully accept an L, so fucking sad
bro just realized he lost
😂 bro should've elbowed tommy...
This video is disgusting! Fking ego showing! Do something about it...
Ever since he started boxing his ego has made him less watchable, its sad to see one of my favorite youtubers shoot themselves in the foot this bad 🤦‍♂️
L
I can’t lie, I just lost all the respect for KSI. Guess the I in KSI doesn’t sound for Integrity. I’ve always thought you were better than this.
If you had taken the loss like a real man you mightve been viewed as a winner still. This is wild man
Who edits this? no one wants to hear 10 min of horrific fake laughing. my dog is traumatised just having to listen to this trash.
That's laughing at Alex Wassabi caliber. 😂
Yes u did 😂
No wonder god didn’t let him grow a beard
Its been a while and people forget but remember that that fight was trash. Embarassing on both ends, the least you could do to save some face is to accept the loss
You have let us all down with this video and you have embarrassed your self immensely icl I’ve definitely lost some respect for you after the way you’ve approached this loss did you forget the meaning “integrity” that you literally have tattooed on your body ?😐
Whoops, looks like he done a stoopid
Remember that time Logan made an identical video bitching about his loss to you? Blaming the judges, whining about “all he did was hit me in the back of the head.”  Good times. Nice to see you keeping the tradition alive
Yes you lost. Remember how you lost? Like that time TF beat you? Then you cried? Cuz he beat you?  Handed you a big juicy L KSL amiright
You guys need to harass this guy that I lost to 2 months ago because I’m butt hurt
This ain't it fam, just take the L and move on
This video is like his boxing... All clinching. After two months he just can't let go that he lost. LMFAO.

It’s odd how this is the first time in probably half a decade that he has said anything about how he was a nerd, and it’s odd how he’s tried to simultaneously put himself down while also making himself seem pitiable, and try to make people feel empathetic towards him, just to make tommy fury look worse. Definitely not a good move to try do that when for the past five years you’ve constantly shouted the opposite
Also hasn’t tommy only been pro boxing for like a year? And also why is jj insulting this man so much? It’s just pathetic to see. I mean “you needed the judges to save you!” No, he wasn’t saved, anytime the judges decide the victor of the fight it doesn’t mean he actually lost. And this guy is insulting his parenting like mate, 5 abortions and several sti’s want to come-a-knocking!
Your pride will be your down fall , you need a reality check you are not all that , Mr beast has 200 million subs but he is so humble , you with you 16 million subs act like you are the best thing in the world you need to relax buddy
Bro said “I have had THREE fights this year”…like neat? Pro boxers used to box every other week mate, that means nothing, actually it’s rather pathetic that that counts as ‘so much work’
yes you lost and took it in the worst way possible  just embarrasing
JJ your turning into a madman making you're fan's to harass someone you lost to accept it be better you're actually turning into a fame hungry madman i have been sub for 2017 and this is a new account your better than this
Bitter man
No one thought you won the fight, you hugged the man more than you punched him you clown
Even the fury family knew KSI won because of the look on there faces lol
L
Yes you lost get over it.  This is not what a man does, a man takes it on the chin my friend, and gets on with life.
What the hell..its enough.. u lost *full stop*
These couple of years, my respect for JJ has gone down significantly. He has been so egotistical and been in so much trouble for no good reason - from using P*** on a Sidemen game show, and fighting with Wade just because of difference in opinion, to not admitting how poor his performance has been in boxing (let's be honest, no person coming out of that PPV event liked the main event). For some reason, I do not even like his presence as much on the Sidemen channel anymore - the other members are so much more grounded and know how to have fun.  As Quadeca said, he is insecure.
Man you don't need therapy Ur billionaire and 30  Go start making children left and right And stop with the bullshit bro
Kind of obvious you are on the sauce, should change your nickname to Juicy J 🤔. This video makes you look bad, you should be respectable in victory and defeat.
They were not three "random" people. They were the judges of your fight. God tommy really broke this man mentally.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA YOU GOT SMASHED BOY ONLY CHILDREN WATCH YOUR VIDEOS
Its like hugging your brother whole night😂
Ksi is just salty that he had his 1st loss
Bro has more hugs with Tommy than his dad 😂
guy even doubled down on harassment on sidecast lmao, and all of the yes men in sidemen stayed silent except harry
Ok so fight Jake now because this is getting drag out…….
Video by sensitive soci3ty  https://youtu.be/eB9QxMuaVWI?feature=shared
This absolute legend has grinded all these years, balancing work and personal life and enjoying making content for us, and we are enjoying this journey with you JJ
Prime makes sense now...just 2 dickheads
This is the same as the logan paul fight jj was ripping on logan for not accepting the loss yet now we give him sympathy nah bro
I don’t think JJ should’ve lost but the fact remains, he did. It takes a real man to accept defeat and move forward to become bigger and better. Not accepting defeat is one of the most childish things imaginable. Again, I don’t believe he should’ve lost, but he should accept the decision that he did
I have been a fan of you for years. I am truly proud of you Ksi. Keep up the hard work.
🤡🤡🤡
KSI has no integrity he hasn’t for years good to see people are waking up to his true colours
Listen my boi KSI I was a big fan, you need to move on. This is the worst reaction to an influencer losing i've ever seen. Logan probably still thinks he won against you but he ain't doing this. Jake probably thinks he beat Tommy... but he ain't doing anything as embarrassing as this. Let's get a grip, be a man, take the L, and grow the fuck up.
I wouldn't call what you did boxing. Tommy won get over yourself
Ksi you won 🥇 don’t ever analyze yourself and see how you lost, because truth is objective and you won!! 👏👏👏
no way this guys still complaining about this. bro has been studying the fight this entire time XD.
You lost on your own promotion, cry hard you sore loser 😂
Rare Ksi L, this video was super embarrassing to watch dawg and I'm a fan of your work do better dawg...
Ah stop Moaning !
Damn man just accept the loss, you're looking worse then what logan did after his loss. Just be humble & get better.
Your success story was never about the destination but the journey. You lost, take the L and move on. i've been watching you since 2009 and i really don't wanna see you turn into this shadow of yourself.
I’m an og im 20 but seeing someone with such an ego and such a sore loser is actually impressive like 😮 get a grip
This is ksi trying to claw his way to a rematch
Fury beat you like a drum….
Nugget
I have never seen someone cope so badly with a loss. You’ve become delusional, bitter, and childish.   1. ‘Keep sending Tommy hate and remind him that he lost’ this man is 30 years of age.  2. ‘I’ve only been boxing for 3 years, I’m a YouTuber’ stop hiding behind this YouTuber excuse. You’ve been boxing since 2017 (6 years) with some breaks.   3. Talking about Tommy’s personal life after the fight, about him being a dad and his personal business just shows how poorly you’ve taken the loss.  4. The people around you are a bad influence (primarily Logan). You’ve quite literally become the thing you’ve hated
Okay, so you are telling your fanbase to harass a previous opponent coming up to a month after the fight, and you are still hiding behind the ‘im just a YouTuber’ excuse. You also claimed you nearly beat him with ‘3 years of training’ You quite literally said yourself in THIS video, you started boxing in 2017 for Joe Weller. That’s 6 years mate. After that you fought Logan twice, had a break and came back.
Ugh this is sad both of their performences were actually crap in the match neither diserved the win but just from ksis reaction he dosnt
delusional, Tommy clearly won the fight
f FRANKLINNNN
Nahh bro as much as i love but this vid is a big L
This guy’s so whiny bro istg
We take losses my guy to become a stronger version 😤😤 we need that sometimes to feel something you know like pain because we’re still human
L
Hahahaha foeking baby hehehhe BIG L
Nothing is wrong with losing but the bad sportsmanship after the event left a bad taste in peoples mouths. When Jake Paul acts more humble in defeat you need to get it together.
I knew ksi would make himself look like a bigger fool sooner rather than later.
Has anybody in this comment section actually watched the video or the fight or just clips from TikTok
Im struggling to find 1 comment that agrees with u everone is clowing u😂🤡🤡🤡
You didn't win 😂
He hurt his ego sooooo bad god damn he is on the verge of crying
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
U got ur ahh whooped your just a wierdo doin karate style in boxing makin it a hug fest go cry in the corner
Big ups on my man Ksi. Dudes a real man and is able to take a loss. Overall, I too believe he was absolutely robbed but it was still nice to see JJ take this as a stepping stone for his boxing career.
Big ups on my man Ksi. Dudes a real man and is able to take a loss. Overall, I too believe he was absolutely robbed but it was still nice to see JJ take this as a stepping stone for his boxing career.
damn why go after his personal life 😂
Jj really needed this loss, his ego is absolutely insane. The man is delusional.
JJ accept defeat and move on , its completely fine , no human being is perfect . But the fact you are looking for reasons to satisfy your ego is mad.
Guys just a fucking weirdo
Shame on you for using your platform to encourage people to harass someone else
hahahaha JJ is a clown, maybe it was that clown haircut you had and it made you take the L Hard
Really hate KSI not taking any responsibility for the loss always been a fan but even when he loses he talks of how embarassing tommy fury is instead of being humble and accepting the loss even calling out his parenting embarassing for him
Pity af
Broski said life isn’t fair when he’s almost a billionaire
KSI I am sorry, but you can not box. I do not know why people are trying to hype you up. It was hard to watch you and Tommy fight. Tommy was just as bad too.
This man is a child
This is just so pathetic to watch……
you should have just stayed quiet. this is worse than the fight. embarrassing
KSI dont get me wrong but most of your fans are teenagers, you are basically being like bad big adult spreading and teaching hate. Its not a good lesson to advice them and go after Tommy Fury and also, with the personal attacks to Tommy. You are bigger than that.
Bro you kept ducking you were so scared to get hit
No one cares anymore bro 👊🏿 just do ur thing
Ksi so pathetic
Loser
This dude really used a picture from years ago and acted like that version of him was the one who fought tommy fury lol how down bad do you have to be to try and push that narrative of an untalented nerd lol you should’ve used a current picture of yourself and how much money and resources you gave to train for that fight lol
Well kids, you've finally seen your false idol's true colours.
I respect the honesty and I still think you won that fight
Duuude, you lost against TF, and yet, you're still trying to make fun of him... YOU are embarrassing. Get over it, move on. Humbly accept defeat, ditch all the arrogant behavior, and mostly, DITCH LOGAN PAUL from your entourage. By associating with him, you indirectly support all his scams and his awful behavior...  I've been following you and laughing with you for years JJ, but I'm so disapointed right now...
Lets be honest, people who truly care would wake KSI up before he does anything more stupid. We aint gonna be supporting him and lay in ignorance after everything just happen. If you truly care youd still want to guide him cause we are part of the reason we got ksi to this point in 2023.  We all are.
If ur seeing this then that’s mental I’m 14 yes old I’ve been watching u for 7 yrs now, you’ve come so far and you should be proud to be where u are now
Oh jj
Ah
So you couldn't embrace the loss and take time to understand/build yourself like a normal person, but then had influence millions of people to harass somebody and their private life just because your huge ego couldn't handle the idea of defeat. JJ's becoming the thing he hated, the integrity which he holds so dear is burning into insecurity right before our eyes, this video just goes to show it...
Rematch but UFC fight next 😂
Boxing was his passion and motivation yes you lost the fight don't beat yourself up over it you did your best and thats all you can do in this situation and you should be proud of your accomplishments but you need to take the time to accept defeat on this match and move on. The supporters don't care you lost they were proud of you for trying your best don't beat yourself up over it, its not worth hurting your mental health over, read the supportive comments here we are trying to tell you its okay and we don't care you lost you have a lot of love/support around you don't push them away over something that is not worth the tears you are a great boxer don't let this bring you down, i know this will get ignored and lost in millions of comments.
And this is why I unsubscribed and stopped watching jj complete prick now
“In spite of what you’ve done for them, eventually they will hate you” - Green Goblin, but it was his fault he got hated. Much like you JJ right now. Take the time to think things over
Jake will win and he will appeal
He won the hugging
To be honest,I feel like you shouldn't have brought up his family at all,which everyone knows is always out of bounds,OR tell your fans to harass him. I believe you won that fight,I'll still be watching your videos because  you make me laugh and I love you,Your TRUE fans won't care about your so called loss. YOU DID GREAT. Focus on healing physically,emotionally and mentally.
Please let’s cancel this guy
Fight took a toll on him aye?
Now you know how Gib felt when he lost Jake, and instead of complaining, he made the biggest comeback. Don't be the guy you said  gib was going to be . You know a boring content creator that focuses on boxing
Mate no one thought you won. you fucking lost😭 all you did was star jumps💀
its mad how much KSI has fallen off with the OG viewers, the only moment I smiled during this video was from the 2017 clip. just sad to see how much KSI over estimates himself and how much of a pick-me he has become.
You lost.
Bro this is not the old ksi, he is crying about fight for more than 1 month now like why
Bro your acting like the whole fucking world doesn’t live pay check to pay check… I think everyone wants a break
this man ego is thru the roof 😂
This is it boys, the downfall of KSI
You lost, words won't change facts
Ksi : The hugger
Yikes
Where is tou guard what african street fighting style is this
Be more aggressive with combos is the only thing someone could probably say, but that’s a W for you ☹️
bro ksi what r u on
Nobody ever saw you as a real boxer so losing aint a real big deal. But being a sore loser is just strange
Finally humbled.
Hmmm wouldn't have the same energy if u won more like "Laughing At Tommy fury " kinda thing
Cry about it
Ksi made a whole video of him crying. You can see KSI has changed even his laugh 🤣🤣 Hes been humbled. This is embarrassing KSI
Next video: i made a server and continuous lapse in my judgement.
JJ, I grew up watching you. I’m about to be a fully grown man. I appreciate how hard you’ve worked over your career and the path you’ve paved for so many people. But this isn’t a good look bro, take the loss on the chin and take it in stride. This doesn’t define you my man. Cheers from the US.
Pleease ksi accept your loss and leave tommy fury alone, apoligize sincerely to tommy fury and his family for weaponizing your fanbase against him,please you know better and don't let your ego take control of you and we'll always support you, but this isn't you.😢😢
Yeh you definitely win 100 plus jumps is amazing 🤌🏼  Pathetic man child, go pro boxing then ohh wait he can't 🥹 coz all he has is ego and complain
Your embarrassing and acted like a baby
Time to unsubscribe
These comments lmao. Yall weird asl😂😂 and nun of yall stand on bidness its so easy to tell.
Awhhh ksi needs a hug
Bro KSI play dragon ball legends so many good characters you can summon on bro
you are delusional still thinking you won   KSI was beaten on points by Fury in Manchester in October with the result initially announced as a split-decision victory before being changed to a unanimous one when one of the judge's scorecards was revealed to have been added up wrongly."  Rafael Ramos scored the fight a 57-57 draw, but the round-by-round tally on his scorecard shows that he only awarded 56 points in total to KSI and 57 points to Fury, meaning that Fury should have technically won by unanimous decision.   ksi is a delusional  🤡🤡🤡  you threw 3 jabs the full fight LMAO obviously shittin it
Why is everyone having a go at jj for ‘taking his L like a child’?!?? His deserved moment was taken away from him unfairly. He won the fight. Cmon 🤦‍♂️
Grow up JJ youre embarassing yourself now, cant handle a loss in a fight that literally only you cares about. Move on, go pro, youre only interested in money anyway, but your ego took a wallop and now youre having a breakdown.
I get you are frustrated and angry you lost, we dont care, we will still support you but asking us to harass fury is not the way to go bro, please don't harass him and next time dont do this ever again. Take care bro 🙏
the "legacy" is pree dead bro lmao
biggest crybaby in the game rn, take me back when little youtubers didn't make a mockery of boxing bro pls
clear LOSS.
Pride is a sin 😊
I get it you're tired however you're deciding to do all does extra side quests so the only one to be blamed is you not the work.
It's very refreshing to see most of the comments are trying to hold this sore loser accountable. Go watch the videos he made when Logan lost and tried to appeal, straight hypocrite..
Nice video, could you now do one without crying please?
Imagine having that much money saying life isn’t fair and still being a sore loser. Grow up.
Hold the L
YOU HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE THE REMATCH CHICKEN SH%T
yes you lost, all of your true fans.
Bro tatted legacy on his back thinking he was gonna win 💀💀
This video is quite embarrassing talking about Tommy's family and accusing him of cheating to encouraging people and your fans to harass him.    Honestly you're just starting to lose your fans bit by bit
the fight was so horrible to watch. They were just hugging the whole time. He didn't demonstrate any progress in his boxing skills. Take your L and move on. Biggest sore loser I ever seen. Be more like Ngannou
What a way to end a “legacy” with this video
Ksi, stop being delusional! Use this LOSS as a way to win the next fight. Making excuses is pointless.
JJ you became what you hated. You became petty, You became delusional and the fact that you have to have your fans berate another man just cause he beat you is embarrassing man. YOU LOST!
You can just tell he’s burning from the fight. Take the loss like a man and move on mate.
Love you JJ but this really Isn't you, instead of being the bigger man and accepting your defeat you let your Ego control you and here you are, mentally low and telling your fans to harass Tommy. This comment section says a lot about your closest fans think about this. Instead of you coming back stronger from a loss, you're loosing your mind over It. Slow down and look around to see where you're standing otherwise you'll go off track. Stay safe G <3
I'm sorry, JJ has now become a car crash that I can't look away from. I loved his and the sidemen's content for years but the way JJ's handling this is just not the right way. And this is coming from a fellow sore loser, Ive legit messaged 24 odd people over the last two weeks while playing FIFA/FC 24 cos I'm that much of a competitive person/sore loser. I'm a 25 year old man, I can admit to that. But JJ, at 30 telling his fans to berate Tommy on everything, even in public is actually fucking shameful. His mates really need to start having actual chats with him to stop his ego getting any worse. This, to me, is only proving more that he lost that he has to remind himself of how he thinks Tommy's not doing well or whatever.
lets go jj released a video🎉
KSI is coping this is sad
People can be on the wrong end of tight affairs in sports, however you can never blame this solely for coming up short. This is because if you are evidently superior it won’t come down to tight margins and there will be no doubt who the winner is. Use this as an avenue for self-improvement rather than remaining whiny about it. Doing the latter is just ego defence mechanisms at play and downright disrespectful to the people in sports who have plied their trade for many many years.
Even Joe Weller took his loss better than JJ now that's sad given how much hate Joe got for the loss...
Dude is prolly doing this to promote for a rematch
Loooserrrrr pusssiiiooooooo
Everybody seems to not realise how Hard it is for a man to admit they cried let alone say it to the world
WSI ! Glad to have u back !!!!!
your all talk man, no one gives a f about your camps and who you spar.
Clown
YOU LOST,  MOVE ON!!!
Fuck's sake bro. You lost. Take the L. This shit's just getting embarrassing now.
rlly embarrasing how you trashtalk tommy even tho u lost to him, idk rlly sad
Trained hard to jump around like a monkey, went back to your roots
You just lost all my respect. Jesus christ…
Can You Do The Rape Face Bruv
I’ve always wanted him to lose just once so it would humble him. It didn’t work.
Ksi😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You asked for the appeal and that sealed your fate. Shutup fam, you're a hugger not a boxer. This reality check was well needed.
Why can’t ksi just learn to understand losing is normal. Just think how Deji did.
Man this is what KSI separates from other YouTubers he really stamps “hard work” into your brain and motivates others to do better in life. But KSI you win some you lose some but you live to fight another day bro.
U lost accept the fact lil p
my google is acting up. its says that ur 30?
23k dislikes
Im fine about your justification why you didn’t Post a video or How upset you are for not winning while the result shows that you have to  win but at the end of the video you start talking about someone else personal life lmoa that was so embarrassing
🤡🤡🤡🤡🫵🫵🫵🫵
I have been a KSI fan for years but i'm afraid i can't take this man seriously anymore after this video
KSI NEVER WENT FROM “RAGS TO RICHES” - He went to private school and his parents are fucking loaded
It's not too late to delete this video bro
Maybe try fighting next time and not trying to cuddle your opponent to death
I’m a JJ fan and have been for the last 10+ years, but I’m on Jake Paul’s side when it comes to the boxing shit and that is not for that you last to Tommy it’s because how you unprofessionally handled this whole situation.
‘Life isn’t fair’he says sat in a 10m pound house with multiple million pound in his bank😂 shut up mate you haven’t got a clue
We all glad to have you back and don’t get me a wrong I’m a huge fan of like 5 years but I didn’t like all the tommy hate in the vid just constant trash talk and bullshit is coming from a jealous place so yeah
Jj, it's not who youtubers thought won or Eddie hearn or random boxing commenters, its the three judges, and they thought you lost. Take the L and move on. Your sounding like a spoilt brat that's just realised he's not the center of the universe!
Ksi sounds like crusty the clown
Ur a winner JJ those refs had no idea what they were doing and probably were untrained
oh wow what a tough watch
Dude that was like last year your still talking about this shit god damn
This dude is such a baby. He clearly lost and fought horribly. You a grown man stop crying
Confidence is quiet. Insecurities are loud.
“Tommy Fury has been pretty embarrassing”    My mans, you’re EMBARRASSING YOURSELF.
You lost. You deserved to lose.
Just accept your defeat and move on
just keep making music you are not a boxer we love your music ksi
I’m sorry but u did not win that at all take it from someone who has bin boxing his hole life only 12 years but it’s still more than u. All u did was grab him a buntch and sink your punches thru that method. If u want to do that join mama. And did u not say tomy furi was trash so what dose that make u. Don’t get me wrong I love your videos and what u have done for boxing but I’m also not blind or stupid and my opinion is not made out of love for u or tomy. The fact that you guys think your pro boxers is far from the truth. You might be fighting in professional boxing doesn’t make u a pro boxer. I can play in the nba and have no basket ball experience and tecnacly play in pro baseball. But don’t get discouraged. What’s the saying you don’t learn anything from winning you know the rest. Also I have dyslexia
WSI
Reading these comments make me happy. The fact that this 30 year old “man” is crying over a loss to a better man on the night according to the judges. Neglects everything he stands for, knowledge strength and integrity this man has none, complete embarrassment. Also commenting on one’s parenting skills is a no go, especially when you’ve aborted multiple…
Blud about to cry i can tell
What a coward
Laughing on KSI vedio when?
Just saying tommy didn't have any power on the decision of the fight so why do you want your fans to keep hating on him you're 30 years old jj I don't think you Lost the fight just don't do that. much love man keep fighting ❤
Seems like u want tht rematch dude and this time don't jump around like an idiot.who are you to talk about being a father you've no idea
You didn’t hang with Tommy though you tried your hardest to avoid an actual fight, the back of the head punches, look how you went off in the ring after a tap in the head from a position you put him in from hugging him. It was embarrassing after you claimed you’re the “nightmare” then get personal speaking on Tommy as a dad. Followed you since I was a kid and I actually despise you now you’re so salty it’s embarrassing.
Now you see KSI real face, egocentric, and can't except lose
love u bro !
still won in our eyes, jj. we love you!
really disappointed, kinda sounds like logan paul in 2019🤷‍♂️
Cry baby 😢
Ksi literally telling people to go and berate Tommy in public if they see him is so sad, KSI fell off big time.
Sucked himself off the first half of the video and then tells his fans to  go berate someone😂 He takes a couple week break from posting to go on holiday every year but he always gives the spiel that he’s been nonstop working since 2017.😂 Actual clown behavior
Tommy vs ksi winner should be Jake Paul
Disgraceful, shameful and immature.   The limited respect that your fan base has is probably shattered right now. Hubris.  I hope youtube makes the right decision here and gives you some sort of penalty.  Grow  Up
Beta male KSI
I think we can all agree the fight was fucking dogshit regardless of who won.
Bro Jake Paul is more respectable
Why is everyone hating so much. 💀 great video, good message. He was clearly joking about berating him in person lol
I think Ksi won personally
Instead of acting like this why don't you go and get a proper trainer and acualy learn how to box if you want to talk to the talk, fight was a draw at best and that isn't because it was close it was more because there was nothing to acualy socre the fight with complete shambles
You guys need to chill out a bit on JJ… he is clearly upset, and although it 100% was NOT cool of him to send his fan base to attack Tommy fury, his mental health and everything he said in the first 90% of the video was still valid and real. We love you JJ, keep up the hard work!
Lsi, lost all respect for you man, disapointing , losing is a part of sport
Nah I’m mad as much as ksi is I was rooting for bro he was beating the fuck out of furry cuaghting him with jab the whole fight and judges played him
I don’t like him anymore, encouraging hate is actually sad. Separately JJ should start a business and make Tommy Fury Co owner just like what Logan did. Logan won that fight and they gave it to jj, so it’s come full circle.
To say thay was a fight is a disgrace to boxing.
KSI VS SPEED🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ksi's fall from grace has been crazy. He used to be a funny fifa youtuber, now hes been consumed by his own ego and cant accept a defeat. The guys a 30 year old millionaire having a mental breakdown. So sad
Bro he won, move on
Shame JJ. Shame. My heart pumps custard for you. Shame.
L
sorest looser in action….just accept the L…..LSI
Ksi is digging himself into an even bigger whole😢
Bro we moved on. KSI should to
Ksi should just move
Oh this guy is having a breakdown….
I feel like the end bit was a joke not meant to actually attack Tommy
He loves crying
Stop crying and stop bringing he being in club nothing to do with he being a bad dad
What a noob you lost
Ksi we watched the fight at most you guys had a draw . You got into the shady boxing game man . Im still a fan man but nut up and go harder if boxing is what you want .
You lost your a cry baby stick to YouTube 😢 wasn’t that like 6 months ago 😂😂?
Jj please bro I use to love your videos, I remember when you beat Logan Paul I was probably more happy than you were. This isn’t you. Take a long break and come back with an apology for your behavior following this loss, that’s the only way I see you restoring the respect we used to have for you. I’m not trying to be mean bro I promise, I want to see you succeed. We all fuck up sometimes bro, I still have hope you’ll turn this around
Why the hell are you going after his family, how old are you, your 30 and you think this is acceptable  You are just making Tommy’s kid’s life’s harder with all this shit your giving to her family  Absolutely embarrassing
been a fan for 8 years and still am till this day but I'm disappointed of this video of JJ, it just seems like he's digging himself down a hole even more
Holy fuck this is embarrassing...
I believe it was either a tie or you won, but telling your fanbase to slander this man a month after the fight is the definition of a sore loser. I dont blame you but this is not a good look bro
Loseeeeer😂
Your so weak that my cat can beat you 😆😆😆😆
What a shame...
You don't care .yet u made 9 min video.
Wow.. these comments.. never seen JJ’s fan base react like this before .. hope he doesn’t fall off, it’s hard to stay relevant and at the top.. good luck JJ!
Loser
Tommy fury is a shite boxer though if you thought a real pro like canelo or gervonta davis   you would of been out with in one round the whole youtube boxing circus for the past couple of years has been a disgrace to boxing and is just plane embarssing to see these spoilt rich kids act like they are the world greatest boxer after 2 fights 😂 im glad its looking like the youtube vs pro boxers is coming to an end anyway stick to fifa jj
BOSS Russki
This is the most I’ve seen people not dick ride there favorite YouTuber, people are actually seeing bro for who he his
Silly and petty grown man. One of the hardest things is to learn how to lose and accept it. Uninspiring really
What a sore loser 😂
Knowledge Strengthless Integrity-less
LET IT GO KSI!
KSI how do I tell you that I love you bro you made me a gym guy thanks for making me apart of your team
Ego bigger than your forhead
Tommy really made LSI cry what a pathetic man child
Dang, Big Sore loser vibes. Honestly, he destroyed you mentally. As much as you are laughing, you are hurt. Its ok Bro. Can't win them all.
This version of ksi is not the version we had saw in the ring. I think we all saw your true colours that day. Your behaviour was terrible.   We had a good run but unfortunately Im unsubscribing.  ✌️
KSI continues to prove himself as a joke. Seemingly right after he became friends with Logan he adopted his personality
Trained hard but the outcome was the same 😂😂
Think you need to move on from boxing now, get back to doing things with your family and friends!
He needs to humble himself and learn to contol his ego. He fought well but no need for this
ksi fell off
This N lost the fight and his hairline 😂
Damn his ego has taken a massive beating! Didn't think he would be such a sore loser..
what a sore loser
Lmaoooo you still can’t take yo L 🤣, he  physically and mentally destroyed you 😭
shameless ksi
feels bad man
LLLLLLLLLLLLL😂😂😂
Ape
*I have called out JJ’s ego, ignorance and hypocrisy for years and no one believed me; I’m glad people are waking up.* I can’t believe I used to follow this guy for 9+ years. He’s absolutely delusional. He’s pulling the wool over his young impressionable fans who aren’t educated about combat sports. Tommy very clearly won this fight, and JJ kept clinching. Stop blindly following this guy. Stop looking to him as an idol or role model, he’s not. JJ was hitting Tommy in the back of the head numerous times too. JJs “three fights” were a joke except Tommy, and he lost. Tommy barely got out of 2nd gear, he was waiting to counter and all JJ did was initiate the clinch.
I have been the biggest KSI fan for  10 years but this is embarrassing. You have evolved into a man child and none can defend you anymore.
Bounce overhand miss clinch and repeat , that’s all you did. You can’t handle a loss , your so wrapped up in your own ego.
you are so petty , lol
KSI, you did not lose. You are a winner. Hopefully, in the future, we will get a new KSI music album. Missing some new KSI music.
Fight Jake Paul and when you lose retire because you're terrible.
People in Thier 70s who been working 9 to 5 since they was 13 for literally nothing complain less then jj.
u deffo lost, take it like a man.
call out ethan if you’re calling out tom
I hope you destroy speed in this fight. Please do it for you fan since day #1.
This man has lost all shame, lyimg blatantly, showing a set of his supporters that said "ksi really won the fight" ok what about the 100s that said you lost? Tommy's performance was terrible but so was yours. Be a man buddy you're not who you think you are, stop pretending and learn to be humble instead of acting to be humble
Fork that fight now Jake can Fight you an Lets See Who's Champ With You 2
Bruh just dont throw a fit after losing look at ngannou vs fury with way more lagacy on the line francis won the fight but didn’t get the decision yet he acted very humble in defeat even though i know it meant more to him to win that fight then for you to beat an unestablished boxer with a big name😂
Run it back
You lost
YOU LOST THE FIGHT YOU EGO MANIAC HAAAAAA
What a joke of a man
Can we get a loser has been in the comments please.
i wish JJ could see this you are being so pathetic and acting so childish grow up be a good sport and get back to it it’s embarrassing to be around this how you acted i bet for the sidemen too get over it your boxing was shit no matter how well you did against tommy move on and fix up you and the sidemen are falling to bits mate ur making the image worse for urself
Was t there a statistic he clinched 70+ times in 6 rounds? He was hugging tommy. Also his work is different no rest for 6 years?? So every person that works extremely long hours physically demanding for 30+ years where are all of their excuses?
I don’t think you want tru geordie as a back up w
Ratio
We all know you won don’t be sad
i thought jj won after the fight but understood it would look bad for boxing so I understood the loss but if DEMTRIUS JOHNSON said KSI won Ksi won simple as that
LMAAAOOOOO
You sold out.
Fight Andrew tate
Fight jake paul
Fight Andrew Tate
Cry bout it
Heart warming to see that hard work pays off
Hold on. Who are any of you lot in the comments to tell another grown man how to cope with a loss? Telling him to deal with it but you’re all up in a comment section on a YouTube video crying like a bunch of idiots over some words. Jesus lord above.
Been a fan for many years to see you slowly go into this man today, selfish, jealous, egotistical, narcissistic, delusional and not a boxer 😂such a shame honestly. You still could of been a good man but you let it change you. Enjoy the loss you needed it my dude
Bro just let it go move on or you will just dig your own grave
Bro acting like he was fighting for the heavy weight championship of the world. To get this salty over a YouTube boxing event is crazy
You lost, take it like a man you 🐱
Well said JJ 👏
You made Jake look like a mature adult after his loss compared to yourself lmao
Jj this is by far the cringiest video you’ve ever made the delusion and victim mindset is to much goodbye😂
Bear oil plus Walmart beard oil
L
Jj all them clips show that those people are not judges and don’t really know what they’re talking about
shoutout ksi reddit for berating him instead of tommy, let this continue for like a year loool
Please relax with the editing
Bro can’t take a loss
Na u didn't win just jumping tbh
This is embarrassing…
Nah icl that’s mad what he asked us to do😭
I mean I think it was probably a draw but… it was a sh*t fight lmao he doesn’t even mention all the hugging
A black loser
Embarrassing on so many levels. Sore loser and diss fury for how he is as a dad. Least Tommy stepped up to being a dad rather than paying off abortions
This comment section has been specially curated. He is getting hate from some spheres of people.
Bro’s butt-hurt
You lost, Get over it
Saw a legendary fighter once say, “You can’t be mad at the judges when you left the fight in their hands.” Fights like this are 50 - 50, if you don’t want the judges to flip a coin then finish your opponent🤷‍♂️
Pathetic, take your L and settle down Princess......
Cringe
you fight good brother but taking a loss makes you stronger but yor are acting like a sore loser!
Just hold ur horse😮😮😮😮😮
Tommy hurt your ego man let it go
This is sad, video slowly devolved into pure salt and delusion.
Lost more outside the ring than in it
the retirement begins heheheh 😈😈😈
acting like this at 30 years old is crazy.
Only took him one month to upload this ...
Sore loser
U lost 100%
Seeing this last fight I’m confident Jake Paul will beat jj
Sour 😂😂😂😂😂
U lost, get over it
I just hope you start uploading 😢
Part of me thinks this is part of the 5 stages of grief. First is denial. Then comes anger which we are seeing now with a mixture of depression. Sooner than later we will see acceptance.   This is a hard video to watch. From being called fat neek, to the numerous insults, this what breaks him and I can’t blame him.  When you put something you trained so hard for, you sacrifice so much for, only for you to lose in front of friends, fans, and family, it’s logical to not take the lost at hand. I’ve been there.  The way you get stronger from that point is to move forward. Show people this isn’t the end. In ksi, he should keep fight different pro boxers if he 100% cares about boxing. Stop being fixated on tommy furry anymore. Go back to YouTube to help him “forget” the lost.   The last thing Ksi needs is to lose his fanbase and if he keeps going down this path, I’m afraid the worse is yet to come.
This was really hard to watch a sore loser
good job on making things even worse for yourself and tommy. sure people would already be up on tommy, but you saying to go after him and harass him just makes it so much worse. get over yourself dude, you lost. get it through your head that you lost and move the hell on.
This is the oldest child I’ve ever seen
In the end no matter who win or lost, telling your audience to harass people that are not apart the mindless Ksi won train, or harass Tommy Fury, is really wrong and extremely immature. I hope ksi that you will look yourself in the mirror and see what kind of a man you are truly becoming.
You loss,And that’s okay but that doesn’t mean downplay yourself, pick your head up and keep fighting king. But I’ll say ,”you need more practice! I feel like you forgot why you started fighting in the first place. You became overly cocky and not humble enough. You hug too much and we well I know your weakness, when you get tired you put your guard down and start jumping back and forth. You need to go back and watch old fights. Tyson and more. Or have a conversation with Mike Tyson if you can. Keep pushing!
KSI just shut up mate. First off your not a Pro Boxer and secondly there have been plenty of actual Pro Boxer throughout history that lost by decision that believe they should have won it. But they never told their fans to harass the winner everyday? 🤦🏾‍♂️
Face it, bro. YOU CAN'T BOX.
Do you know telling you subscribers to harass someone in real life is against YouTube policy.
Only thing that sucked was the whole fight no one payed for it and the fans still were the ones that ended up losing get over it mate
You got your ass whooped mate get over it 😂
All of you stop approaching this man from a place of understanding or compassion, he’s a piece of shit and this video proved it
Ksi still crying about losing , your shit mate stick to YouTube
Ngl i like you ksi but im not like a die hard fan, we all know who won that fight! U did
Bro, I've been following you for years, love your growth and you crack me up... but damn you're being immature, be a man, accept your loss, and move on.
You should delete this video mate... pretty petty and childish
Constantly ignoring the countless times you hit Tommy on the back of the head
What a clown 🤡 😂😂😂 got what he deserved Loser SI. Where was his bs drama when he won by point shit with logan paul no sympathy video at that time oohhhh LSI
Brother jj one minute we become old brother I remember you in your family house in your room making the videos ohhhhhhh it’s been a while brother
You did no fights in 2020-2021 Its 4 years
Great guy and have always been a fan but desperately needs to remove a few “yes men” from around him. It’s holding him back and not letting him focus on things he’s actually good at. Boxing and music aren’t them things. On to better things.
I bet Lilmaxkid would now want to harass Tommy Fury publicly and online, because his master said so. 🤦‍♂️
3:54 bro even woke the child up with that
You lost KSI except it mate
Grow up babe. You deserve the lost
Just stop JJ You’ve lost, take what u can from it  continue to make content and stfu, honestly telling people to insult a guy and disrespect him just because you lost is low af, especially for you… a guy who’s been taking hate and shit for years and didn’t give a f
Bro u cant tell ur fans to goon up on tommy fury thats mad immature 🤣 u r 30 like come on
Tommy destroyed you mentally lol
Such a shame this guys such a bad role model. This isn’t how to take a loss, asking your kid fans to go after the guy that beat you months after. Sad to see. To think this guys 30 and us this immature and entitled, it’s tough to see.
You starjumped for the whole fight. You deserved to lose.
No way bro actually asked his d riders to harass tommy 💀💀💀 JJ i get it, you loss and stuff but that shouldn't mean you should harass the guy you lost to (or robbed you for the win)
L
When Debi loss you tore him a new one. Showed him no love. You should watch those videos and understand you’re taking to yourself
Cry more Ksi
All these SIMPS in the comments 😂
Try to say my name.
Even though your ungodly rich why you still acting like kid your 30 years old still acting like child
I'ma be real Ksi just told you to remind tommy that he didn't win not to spread hate 😂 ksi also didn't tell anyone to harrass the guys kid he told Tommy to spend more time with his family - all ksi said give him a reminder not go jump him - Ksi would have accepted the loss if it really was one
Youll break TOS and get away with it
Such a sore loser
Such a hard life
Completely forgot about this lol who cares now? Remember KSI nobody cares about your loss as much as you do…move on
My boy you lost. Take the L. We are still fans and it was a super close match.
You can do better KSI.  Dont send your subscribers after TF. Thats just sad.  Apart from that, im glad youre back, just be better.
He won the hugging contest not boxing!
This guy is an actual melt. Period
Im waiting for the penguinz0 video
You didn't lose, Fury had those judges in his pocket.
wtf ksi? You pretty mutch started this whole youtube boxing thing, you were the face of it and i thought youre the last person who would be this petty and sore loser. Do you really want to be remembered as this guy? Damnn youre hitting low on this one
The fact you guys are going toe to toe and not getting knocked out says a lot. He’s suppose to be a pro and he looks so trash
Can Deji talk down to him yet
You're a muppet. Acting like it was a championship bout 😂. You spent the night hugging him, and he weren't much better.
Honestly just leave it alone now what’s done is done leave the man and his wife and kid alone let him live his life stop harassing him with this sore loser cocky mindset honestly your just trying to make up for the fact that YOU lost accept it
Bro you are a very bad looser
Let's be honest, bros going to release a new song and everyone is going to forget this period.
I’m an old fan. But no more. You seemed to me like money has changed you for the worse and this proves it. You definitely aren’t the same man I was watching. I guess hardships show true colors. And who you keep as your friends. You’ve scammed billions into buying your drink. I won’t be surprised if we get a crypto related scam from you too
Loads of people could see how Tommy won, he actually came to fight, not to dance,hug,grab and hit in the back of the head like your corner man told you to, the dirty man. YOU LOST.
Never thought he would be this much of a sore loser 😂
bro lost the hugging battle and dipped
Take the L like a Man, this is just embarrassing to watch 😂
KSI, I know you won't see this but I know how you feel about losing and i would dare to say is normal to act out, but take it as a learning experience and move on. You can never fully grow without making some mistakes. Even if the match is judged unfairly, you should be the better person and stay calm. Acting out wouldn't make it any better and just making yourself a fool or look like a child. You performed well even when you lost. Don't focus on what you lost, but on what you gain from it. Be a better example and stay strong in heart. Remember rage shows that you have a weak heart. The comments posted here can be pride-shattering, but it is for the best. Nevertheless, i hope you had a good break and stay safe. I will still support you and so will the others❤
Its funny his switch up before the fight his ego was so out of control nobody could beat him now he talking like Tommy should have beaten him cause he only been training for three years. This is the true ksi hes angry he lost and cant accept it so he has to bash tommy with every sentence he spills. He has to tell the fans to try and do something he couldnt dude what scumbag
I've been a huge fan of yours for a few years now but this fight and how you're reacting is sad man. All the boxing YouTuber scene want accolades and to make good impressions by winning fights and say "See? I'm not just a YouTuber" but hide behind that same curtain when they don't have things go their way by saying "it's embarrassing the other guy didn't do better". Either credit yourself as a real fighter or as a joke but stop hopping back and forth.
This entire video is a huge L
Bro just stop it, so sad what you have become, accepting defeat maybe hard but it isn't impossible.
Your bouncing about that style was embarrassing
delusional
Cope harder bro!
the I in KSI should be changed from integrity cause this is just sad now; integrity is the quality of being honest and being morally right. Sending fans to harass Tommy just because you lost is really low
mate you lost. stfu and take the L
L
L
Man just accept the defeat  Y r u in denial Honestly its just embarrassing
What a crybaby. 😂😂 you hugged him most of the fight. Accept the lose and move on.
Honestly man pretty pathetic video
Sure you lost, but GTA 6 is coming out, so not much of a loss
Yup we made the wrong guy famous💀
"Yeah but ksi is the goat tho" virus is spreading as we speak
This is a definite LSI moment
TF was that😂
Put in the hard work and you literally .....can lose a fight
🧂🧂🧂🧂
From him telling people to say "But KSI is the goat tho" if he had won, to him still telling people to attack on people's social media after the lost, shows that he still hasn't accepted reality. Disappointed in KSI tbh.
KSI sucks
Acc saddest shit ive ever heard its a loss get over it why even appeal its just an ego flex
I hope this video gets mass reported
lol this guy is about to have a downfall if he don’t chill and learn how to handle an L properly
copium
Lil bro is still coping after 2 months.
I believe in Islam, the blood of the holy people
Your going to be fighting AJ, FK HIM UP
You won the fight bro everyone needs a brake glad you took it.
We going back to the stone ages with this one
Rematch him 3 years then FUCK HIM UP
They paid off the referees before the match
still salty, huh? pathetic
This is the most pathetic thing I have ever seen, you lost, the judges didn't take anything away from you, you lost. You lost an appeal, take the fucking loss and move on.
Bro imagine how he will be if the jake Paul fight happens and he looses….that would genuinely destroy him and his ego
Logan took his lost well, Jake took his lost well, Why can't you mate? As a long time fan Im disappointed, telling your fans to harass Tommy in public is just a new low. I didn't expect you to go down that kind of level. Glad to see the fans calling out JJ for his mistakes.
Get over it, take it like a man. The little tantrum u has after the fight was embarrassing
I like ksi but i feel like this is very unhuman like and it's a shame because he has the ability and kindness but this just isn't the right way of doing it
Dude. Get over it
You should release the full song of white and black. Got reminded of it when scrolling through reels n found it hilarious
This is a poor response. Everyone (including KSI) had a go at Deji for not being humble in defeat when he lost his fights, yet KSI is doing the same thing if not worse which is kinda hypocritical to me. Jake Paul did make a few excuses when he lost but at least he was a bit more humble in his defeat and gave Tommy respect. You could argue the KSI Tommy fight should have been a draw but at the end of the day the judges gave it Tommy. This stuff happens all the time in boxing, just take the loss like a man, get better and come back stronger. It really ain't that deep.
Take the L 🤡
Bro, even if you won, that fight was embarrassing.
Bro u didn't win and no were not going to berate tommy. I've been a fan for 6 years and this is literally the lowest I've seen you go.
8:54 i mean its mainly thanks to us.. but okay jj. joke its 70% us and 30% YOU HAHAHAHAHHAH Joke... XD.... lets make it fifty fifty....
why tf do you want me to harrass someone....
Not a good look trying to slander tommys name like that after losing. Talking about his wife and kid like that. makes you look buthurt. I thought ksi would have more class in losing then jake but its pretty similar sadly.
been a fan of his channel for so long but this video ain't a good look for him. he should've just taken the L maturely.
Tf man i looked up to u jj,,plz delete this video this is embarrassing
Jj brags about boxing for 6 years straight, then says he only been boxing for essentially 3 years...
U got beat man up u sausage
The editor needs to chill
We watched Francis Ngannou get robbed of an obvious victory over Tyson Fury. The Fury family is protected for whatever reason.
What lost???
Embarrassing
KSI= Haaland 2023
I hope u r joking
Embarassing video
That was a boring fight, the only losers are the one who paid the ppv
I admit you won the fight. But it would be better if you'd destroyed him and make him look like a fool. How are you gonna be the best fighter of all time if you did the performance you did that day?
KSI You're a true hero and all the hate on you is outrageous, that fight was yours! And the fact people are hating on you so much is crazy. You have been the my main source of entertaining since i was 14 im now 23. Everything you said in this video is the truth, the only downside as you have to deal with idiots that don't want the truth and jump on the tommy fury bandwagon. Much respect for you and everything you have done you are a man of many talents and deserve everything you've got. I'ma a fan till the end and just hoping this comment reaches you well. Youre a hero in my eyes keep up the amazing work. Much love, drink prime, until next time.
Who gives a fuck rockstar released the GTA 6 TRAILER
Remember when you told Deji to be humble in defeat after he lost to Alex Wassabi? Here's a suggestion for you: Take your own advice.
Ksi weakass give reason after loss strong one work hard
Womp womp.
The fight should have been or a Win for KSI because of the deduction or At Max a draw.
loser mentality
In my opinion he did lose he got beat by Tommy fury with a Majority decision
Prime ksi is the best
fought like the grinch
hugging doesnt win fights mate
Why are people still hating on this guy what have I missed. JJ is still the same guy I knew when I was a kid
Seeing how the toxic Tommy Fury fans insult JJ is heartbreaking to me. JJ may have done something bad and lost many fans, but I will remain a proud non-delusional KSI fan. Seeing how people downgrades, you pissed me off. Love for JJ.
LSI excuses Prolonging Jake Fight  -Gib  -Money -Covid -no rush -Album -Tour -A Side -Weight -Home - warm up -Wants Wembly -MVP is untrustworthy  -contracted fighter  -ring rust  -claims it will end all YT boxing -enjoying too much  -ring Size -building misfit  -I need a break  -sparring Speed
Not a good look telling your fans to harass another person mate
this is the guy that i subscribed to... welcome back fitneek!!
The only thing embarrassing here is you JJ. I've loved and followed you for several years now, since the "I'm on a horse" era, and all I can say is just take the fucking L and move on man. No need to throw shade on someone for nothing and no need to resort to copium for your loss.
You did not win stop using excuses the only thing holding u down is ego mate just throw that away and stay motivated as always u gonna lose fans if u keep doing this matter of fact even jake is gaining popularity back in social media despite all the videos he makes previously
A lot of hate comments but I just wanna know who tf the people who thinks he won are. Are they credible?
I defiantly think you won that fight to be honest.
L
I don’t think Ksi realises this video is completely identical to “congrats Ksi” by Logan Paul
Bad loser
This guy is still on the denial phase lmao
This is what happens when you are a 30 year old sore loser with a  god complex 🤣🤣
Hit a new low with this video. Makes me realise you’ve always been a man-baby
Say what you want about Tommy you lost buddy you lost 😂😂😂 and you cried you smelly fool
I’ve never seen someone blatantly delusional and narcissistic. Blud is coping unreasonably hard.
This man's ego is so outrageous. You lost, you didn't win nor did you deserve to win. You're 30 mate go start a family or at least grow up and take the loss like a man because this video is pathetic.
its pathetic how jj is acting like a bitch. And his "fans" are constantly dick riding him is pathetic. There is no way he should act this shit after being gone so long coping. The rationally neutral people who give their opinions are berated smh.
Bro can't cope with a loss 💀 This video is a big L
And I just saw Ksi v Speed  is coming up🤣😂.
Jezus Christ i have been a subscriber of yours for like 10 years now! This level of ego and delusion is literally unacceptable! Stay humble man! This is just sad
All those who agree to ksi in this video are 9 year old
Absolutely disgusting and disgraceful. You should accept your loss like a true man and move on, not cry like a 30 year old baby.
This man can't stop taking L's
If JJ keeps acting like this, he’s not gonna have the fanbase and love he once had. JJ take the L like a grown man and stop acting like a child.
Dont know what videos more jaw dropping, this or the new GTA 6 trailer. Wow JJ wow.
You lost, stop embarrassing yourself
Always been your fan and always will be but come on KSI lets take a loss like a man and dont downgrade ourselves to petty reasons or lose moral control 🙏🏻 Focus on the next goal, it is what it is
what a scumbag
listen, i understand we want to be genuine with ksi and not delude him, but im being absolutely serious and unbiased when i say the truth is ksi did in fact win or draw that fight. i understand it seems heavily pretentious to pretend like my opinion is better than a judge, however the world all watched that fight, and we all saw ksi dominate. tommy won purely because he’s more experienced and has a better form, leading the judges to believe his strikes were more powerful, despite much less strikes landed. listen, id love for ksi to be humbled and his ego to tone down, and i truly believe the title of a loss did that, however i truly don’t think he lost that fight, i have absolutely no care in the world if he did or didn’t win, i can just sympathize with a man who prides himself on his hard work, shows up, fights a more confident version of jake paul’s opponent, and to many that have no reason to favour ksi, admittedly thought ksi won. you can’t ignore that point deduction, even without it then i can see it being tommy’s win or even a slim chance of a draw, but with a point deduction tommy wins? not at all man, a tie at the very most for him. Any person that puts in hard work and has seen their hardwork not be appreciated the way they know it should should be fully aware of how ksi feels, when even tommy’s brother thought ksi won, i mean, the justification is all there, ksi rightfully did not lose that fight, and he’s a man with many supporters, but many haters as well, and it feels so good to show a person with a hateful mentality that their hate is wrongly based. i know this is a bit of an essay, just read many comments and wanted to address what i recognize as a deluded sense of wanting better for ksi. the one comment i can agree with is that he does pride himself far too much on being a “winner”, a loss shouldn’t get him down so much, however because of the facts of the situation, i feel this statement doesn’t hold, i think a proper humbling experience where there’s no doubt he’s wrong is what he needs, but this situation was not it, this fight was not a loss any human being would accept and move on from, you fight a man that was completely shitting on your abilities as a boxer, you very clearly keep up with them and are dictating a good portion of the fight, you wouldn’t accept a loss so easily when you know they didn’t outdo you.
Big l lol
Sore loser
Bro is so salty
in my eyes u won brodie
7:57 Inciting public harassment on Tommy to your 16 million fans is nothong short of pathetic and highly illegal. Bro needs to stop acting like a child and take the L
Ksi needs to retire
Playing the victim card, great.
Did he just say Chris Brown has no rhythm?
Washed.
You are such a hypocrite telling him to take care of his kids while you tell your 11yo fanbase to harass him in public. Do you think they will leave his kid and family alone? What if they get harassed cause of your ego? The fact this is not even a live and fully recorded and edited video is beyond me.
the amount of times you punched while clinching isn’t real boxing, you lost, grow up and good night
KSI should have a rematch with Tommy Fury
KSI needs to invoke a rematch with Tommy Fury
Oof
Ngl only showing clips of people glazing you and saying you won- despite a lot of them not knowing anything about boxing or being your close friends/fans- and completely ignoring the fact that you also hit Tommy in the back of the head just as much if not more is embarrassing. The only reason Tommy got the point deduction and you didn't also get one was because you complained like a baby the whole time and Tommy just took it as it was and kept going. Not to mention the fact that the ref literally works for you and was 100% biased towards you. And you were dancing around the ring the entire time doing jumping jacks and giving out hugs instead of actually BOXING. The fact that you did all that and had all of those odds in your favor and yet Tommy still beat you is insane. Tommy absolutely won that fight and he absolutely deserved that win. I am not even a hater and I genuinely enjoy your content but the fact of the matter is that Tommy won, you lost. Take it on the chin, and move on.
KSI some of us cant defend this...
2 months after the Fight and JJ is still salty about losing. It ain't Tommy's fault thst you under performed. Especially after all that trashtalk and bragging about knocking him down. The most annoying part about all of this is he is trying to use his young, impressionable fans to attack a Man who had nothing to do with the decision other than fight like He did. All that training and throwing punches but still can't take a loss like a grown ass Man. The fight is over and here Jj is, still calling out the Man who defeated him. Salty as the Ocean, Shallow as a Puddle and disgusting as an Africal Canal.
JJ has lost it, he lost the fight and lost it mentally, that or he's always been this 30 y/o child, this aint even salty, this is pure ugandan cope going after a person's private life. Either way i hope this loss will be beneficial for him in the long run, sometimes some people just need to be humbled before they can be their best self. Big L of a video
Just quit mate you can’t box
Keep working hard to
I’m a big supporter and Ik it hurts but there’s a time you might get revenge I believe in you I look up to you and your a big inspiration to people keep it up
kinda cringe to tell your fans to harass a guy you had public beef with. obviously fans will take it too far and justify it with this video
How pathetic. You had the chance to gracefully accept the lost and gain respect. Wow
just becuase you lost a fight dosent mean you have to try and ruin his life, you lost just take it.
still yapping bout this
Nah I can't see how KSI is seen as a loser in any respect
Jj Bruv, accept the positives from the fight. You lasted, you didn’t look like a loser you looked like a fighter. You didn’t get embarrassed for example like Logan’s fight. You proved everything tommy said he’d do to you wrong. You’re training was worth every second. So just accept that. Look at the bright side of things. You were a winner regardless of the scoring. You shouldn’t have posted this because now it looks like you were the loser in the fight.  Winning isn’t about the opinions of the judges. Winning is the facts of what you did out there and just getting in the ring alone.
And of course YouTube won’t punish him for telling 16 million people to go harass someone on the internet and in real life. YouTube is so corrupt @youtube
You lost because of the “It’s Time To Shock The World”
This dude is so out of touch hahaha your crying about your life as a 100 millionaire whose family’s family’s family is set for life. Telling all the viewers who are struggling paycheck to paycheck that you’re depressed and hate your life?????? GTFO of here you delusional narcissistic 😂😂😂
LSI
I support you
Worried that he would go to the asylum like the guy deji beat
King 👑
WSI
i think ksi does not know how to count
Ksi: i was training for joe weller in 2017. Also, Ksi: ive only been training for 3 years!
Hey JJ OR ANYONE in this vid hopefully he reads this my dad passed away if anyone can repost or donate pls
I share your belief, I don’t believe you lost that fight neither, but you are not being yourself, right now, Knowledge. Maybe take another week or two off. You feel better than you were about the “loss”, but you are not *being* better. You have not lost my support, I don’t think you’ve quite lost anybody’s in these comments quite yet, but we know you, and you are nothing like this. Please, JJ, consider taking just a pinch more time.  Edit: fixed a little detail
bros in denial
Jj going out sad with this one:/
Maybe you should try therapy instead of harassing people?
This is a very weird response ngl. Never weaponize your audience.
lol won the fight? you having a laugh
Bru you lost. Take your L stop this nonsense. It's embarrassing
anyone know a good tattoo remover hit up ksi
Yh I hope no one listens to the harass Tommy, he weren’t the judge.
Crazy how many people are hating on jj nowadays. I dont look at comments much, but all i ever see in his comments is love. At the end of the day jj is a human and is gunna do shit wrong. If any of you (or i) was in the spotlight im pretty sure you wouldnt be as perfect as you act when u write all these comments. Hes literally smashing life, trying his hardest to spread positivity and motivation and not to mention hes actually real, Most  people are just acting nowadays. I recon he did win the fight. And yeah he did act very chikdish when he lost. Understandably as it was his whole life at the time and our boys never off camera. At somepoint ur gunna make a dick if yourself in front of the whole world. He said that you can remind him he lost. That is not harrasment. If you see tommy fury in the street it isnt harrasment to say that he lost a fight. People will do that anyway hes a famous boxer 😂 and people will do that to jj.  your all fried 🤯
Jumping up down and hugging your opponent does not constitute a win......
You should by now JJ, everyone who says they’re gonna shock the world loses
Immature bros 30
Bro threw a fit
Im proud of you even though you lost🎉😢😂😊
Somehow you have taken two L's from one fight. Not a good look brother.
How does this video have over 150,000 likes, should only be 15,000 likes with the 1.8 million views this video has, he don’t deserve an applause. Hit the dislike instead it’s just as easy
Im always a fan of you and i will always support you😢🎉🎉😊
Ksi is a absolute half Witt
KSI you were never a sore loser. What happened?
He is a sore loser
JJ you loosing does not matter to us all we care about is you succeeding , how far you have come , how hard working you are ,  who you are , how you always keep you fans entertained and who you are is what makes you special so you lossing dose not matter 🎉🎉🎉and i want you to focus on your dreams and go higher🎉🎉🎉🎉....lossing is a part of the journey in life if you lose just move on ....go KSI go higher and achieve more
Someone else commented this but just to reiterate: you are now known as a crybaby and a sore loser, which has overruled the narrative that you lost a fight to Fury. Losers can become winners, and you would have won and lost many more fights in the future. But now, you have an entire character cleanup you need to do. Good-luck scrubbing the image you’ve made for yourself (10x worse than just having lost a meaningless fight) I know your a narcissist and will work hard to fool people into thinking you’ve changed your character!!
KSIL  Knowledge Strength Integrity Legacy (Losing)
The lot in the comments complaining are so clowns bruv.
Lmao this is even more funny you deserve thus loss hold that L
Shaun jones should be in a misfits card, anyone else here watch him?
Big L JJ
I'm sorry but being a professional boxer was never your dream.... how can this affect you soo much? You made all this money play fighting
Brother I think you pried in too hard into his personal life there was no need to mention his relationship. Also telling people to publicly bother him isn’t a good idea. Please correct what you said 👍
Backing yourself beforehand then excusing yourself for being a “nerdy YouTuber” is a bit mad…
Nan man, Win or lose, you don't tell your fans to harass someone.
In the words of ETIKA “NO BITCH NIGGAS”….sorry all these soft people are whining about your vid.  We all know you won and no creature gets to tell you how to voice it. Trash talk is apart of the game “all is fair in love and war” who knows maybe Tommy mans up for a rematch which I know JJ is down unless he’s retired
Think you should get done for harassment
Hypocrisy KSI, you can’t go saying that you some how won the fight and then harass tommy fury for ‘losing’, mate the judges told you you lost, and you are acting exactly, if not worse than Logan Paul after your fight with him. Mate I had an English essay I wasn’t proud with, thought i’d been hard done by, but i just had to accept the result.    KSI, now you’re just acting like a baby in rapper’s clothing.
Stop begging it mr knowledge
This dude is so lost in his own delusion
Ksi is a pathetic child. The fact that he has a fanbase is genuinely concerning.
This guy’s time management is crazy!! Props to him
"You just couldn't take the L, could you?"  - KSI (Logan Paul Is A Sore Loser)
Hopefully in a year or 2 he will make one of those salty compilation videos n use clips from this video😂
Of course life isn’t fair you make millions while some random doctor in Uganda can’t afford to pay for food
You lost fair in square, stop complaining
Childish…
chill out bro.
are people really this dumb of course hes not telling people to harass him in public he's joking he was laughing
Delusional ksi
Absolutely cowardly telling your fans to go bully Tommy after the appeal didn’t go your way. You lost a lot of people’s respect today JJ, do better.
stop acting like a kid ure literally 30
Logan was salty after losing to you and now you do the exact same thing except much worse...
Dude has such an ego doesn’t realize he just exposed himself for meat watching Tommy for a whole month after losing 😂
We love you JJ, icl people in the comments are getting pressed. Like why u taking life so seriously get over it about "oh hes telling people to berate tommy" like ok so its just bants. JJ your true fans,supporters know that you didnt lose and you should be proud of what you have achieved in these past years!!! Dont take this loss to heart,you are always my inspiration
yeah u lost bye
ok people of YouTube, lets define KSI's boxing style...
I’m no fury or ksi fan but ‘Everybody go harass a man with a family’ is a joke.
What a sore loser.  Sure you did not get destroyed like Paul, but all you did was clinch.  No significant punches or damage to Fury.  Did not initiate any of the action.  You are a bad boxer.  This is pure cope.  Lost the match, lost the appeal, and crying still.
title is a bummer, we know u won jj, ppl believed it till the scorecards were even posted -340/365
How did you end up being a worse person than Tommy Fury.
common ksi L
I spent the last 6 years trying not to kill myself
Speed bout to beat yo ass too
Ego
More vids plsssssssssssssss
You lost. This is weird. Imagine being so outta touch with reality. Also, telling people to harass him!? Yeah,... Weird Champ. You can put that trophy next to the Huge Egg Shaped head, and WHACK ASS hair line trophies you already have.. And to be honest, NO ONE could beat you in those. Lean into your strengths. FAM.... <insert awkward random laugh for no reason here>
Not saying exactly for this video but for all of ksi's videos, video editing is always on point. I wonder if ksi contributes to the editing nowadays  P.S I know this is off topic and I don't know if this is the best time to bring it up but it's a point that's been in my head for ages
How are you able to accuse someone of being shameful when you can't even firm an L and take it like a man? Throwing your toys out of the pram like a child.
i was disappointed you didn't get the dub, but from how you've been acting since the loss and from what you've said in this video, I'm glad you got humbled.
Yeah, but Tommy's the goat though.
At least you will win the fight against IShowSpeed!
Love to see you back
People need to report this guy for encouraging harrasment and cyberbullying.
Learn to take a lost loser
Are you going to take a tantrum again Cry S I 😂
Hearing you cry about how unfair life is like you barley found out cuz everything In life goes your way cuz everyone sucks you off and your a millonaire is pathetic
You lost just take it like a man and stop crying
Why did you make this video
Me: I honestly think KSI won the fight. Random: Get out of here, you stupid fanboy!
This is how I always saw KSI and surprised people are now just noticing.
Just really disappointed in the way you are handling this. Harassing a guy's family who won while you lost. I thought you were a okay guy but you just had to let your fame and money get to your head and hanging out with Jake doesn't help either. Just disappointed.
Holy shit, JJ got infected with brainworms. How in the santa fuck did you think this was a good idea? And also, that shoot boxing trying to be venom page aint gonna get you anywhere with a fury, even tommy.
Never give up bro❤
u didnt lose and also the actual professional boxing account said u won and i know u can take a lost but we will find out one day if u can cause rn u havent lost anything
You lost Megamind, get over it. Time to get back to making terrible music with Rudolph.
Bro is doing everything he mocked jake Paul about, grow up
apology video is gonna be the next one this was such a L for you dude. lost me as a fan fr and been there since you and deji played in the same room together
Is this the meme guy on Warthunder video's?
What a loser
Kind of a KSI “L” ngl
What a baby.
amazing video ksi keep it up
Don’t care gta 6 trailer dropped
Media industry is hard i mean even some really successful people do stupid shit like exhibit A being this video
Stop acting like a child...you lost.  move on...your not special that you'll always win neither are you perfect..you lost everyone loses so get a move on. Stop being a crybaby and man up. Damn.
This reaction is completely typical of the kind of a guy KSI is.
Too much hugging to tell who won
we will do as you command lord KSI
So go for next fight that's what you have been doing despite the result
wow so jj showed hos true colours after this loss and what a big L you are a man child jj and a sore loser we all saw the match u did nothing bro u threw two to three punches every round and was dancing and hugging the entire time u clearly lost he fight bro so get over it and telling your fans who are probably 15 years and below to berrate another mans life and insulting another mans parenting skills  is a Big L that shows how big of a coward and immature u are u jist lost a fan
Cringe. You did lose. Those 3 random people were judges. If that’s the case, every fight in the world doesn’t matter. None of your “wins” matter either. And “just a fifa YouTuber” embarrassing your falling back on that now. Humble your self, you’re horrible at boxing.
I think it's good that you had an L even if it was just for a little, even so you had time to reflect. Don't even think about his business or your ego just go forward❤
I usually really like watching your videos, but that you can't accept your loss in the fight and still claim that you are the winner is just embarrassing and sad. Grow up, accept your loss and move on..
KSI, the other guy is clearly a weasel.
Is this the real KSI?
💯💯💯
You didnt lose have you seen the score card it was wrong
Happy to see You back bro❤
Ksi when are u doing a try not to laugh money challenge 🙃
It’s was fair you lost
Really? Even this long after the fight you’re still sour about it? You’re in a professional sport, it’s about time you start acting professional and take the loss on the chest and move on instead of encouraging your fans to keep ‘reminding’ Tommy that he lost, which is an idea that’ll go as well as the fight itself did
This whole video was just embarrassing.  I can finally see how KSI and Logan is so alike, just how everyone has been saying for so long.  When Logan lost, he was delusional and thought he won, and tried appealing the fight. When Ksi lost, he became so delusional, he tries to appeal the fight, get his fans to harass the winner, aswell as push his progressive narrative in every possible turn he can, to try and prove to everyone else but himself, that he won. But he didn't win! No KSI, Tommy Fury did not fight that ugly nerdy dude from 2012, Tommy Fury fought a 30 yr old delusional crybaby, and frankly I don't know which of the choices would be more embarrasing of a match to Tommy. I will here completly agree with KSI that it is embarrassing to watch this fight, as Tommy could have done a much better challange. KSI's narrative, is to tell everyone that he has come very far, but is really just based off him bullying his past self, and using manipulative tactics to trick his fans to his side. Just look at this with a different perspective, KSI would have laughed either way, if he hadn't lost, he would have used the same image from 2012 and say "Tommy really lost to this guy!?", but since he lost, he is trying to reverse this effect, but making it an embarrassment, for Tommy, to have struggeled against guy. He will try to use his past as an excuse when he loses, and will use his progress as a proving point when he wins. If you are not alerted at all by this video, you have to wake up. Don't be like KSI, it doesn't matter how many years you go training, gym or boxing or whatever skill you are working on, if you don't improve, you have not come very far at all. The point where you go wrong, is when you start to shame others, or think of yourself higher than the people who surpassed you, or did the thing you couldn't achieve yourself. Thats a road thats gonna lead to you being bitter, become bitter for every mistake in your life. It is better to improve and convice others by being better, walk the walk, than to spill your imperfections, delusion and issues all over the table, to not improve, and to only talk. Say whatever you want ab Tommy, he has at least the integrity to move on. KSI has been lashing on Jake Paul ever since 2019, and even before that, and based his entire legacy on saying he is better than Jake Paul, and has finally lost, and will probably never get over it.   Don't fall for his nonsense and progressive narrative.  But thank you KSI, for letting me know that I can start as a humble man and become and do everything that I want, like go to a boxing match, embarrass myself, and STILL think that I am better than everyone else. That is progression.
Accepting defeat is like wearing a 👑 but sad to hear these words from you. I am happy that you lost bro. Get some good influence I want that good KSI. Maybe get away from Logan Paul this might help you
Dude tried to use his non-existant reach
Used to be a fan up until now KSL🎉
Bro IDC you lost GTA 6 trailer dropped!!!!
stop crying just accept the loss
Waiting on ur try not to laugh jj
What s loser seriously
Don’t get me wrong I’m team KSI all the way but I’m so glad he lost, he still claiming he won being a complete sore loser. He still has some growing up to do.
You proved yourself to everyone and everyone including Tommy fury fans know you were robbed
Cope harder loser. Hug harder next time 😂
illegal elbow and clinch after every 'shot' slipped ur mind?
My guy is doing what logan paul did after thier fight 😂😂
The fucking ego and narcissism on this freak.
Even Deji wasn’t this salty and that dude took so much shit from losing
Kinda obvious that u were gonna lose
I wanted ksi to lose to see how he dealt with the loss, and this video showed me he can't take one
Nah you lost bro sadly
Idk why u make a mountain out of a mole hill this is bad influencing sorry pal u needed this get on ur feet and forget it
Months later and he's still moaning about his loss nobody cares it's been and gone. Fury hasn't got a loss on his record but you always will so stop crying
I am a fan of your channel jj don’t get me wrong. But you were talking a lot of shit about how you were going to knock out Tommy fury so in my opinion it’s kinda deserved that you didn’t.
Nobody thought ksi won. He did better than expected, he didnt win
Don’t you just hate KSI nowadays🤣
You’re going the jake Paul route. Stop trying to fight like you need a win for your career. You don’t needs win, you need to entertain people.  Your trainers are training you to fight like you want a title even if it’s boring, you don’t have that type of skill. You do have enough skill to entertain the people that love you while taking favorable fights. Crying about a loss is silly man
Ffs YouTubers just cannot lose with grace.
KSI became S. Besides that, he still makes us laugh with his contagious cackle, and I’m still a fan
You go explain taya
Hahahaha bro thought he won 🤣🤣
Taking the L significantly worse than Jake Paul did fr..
You lost, get over it. You have one of the easiest lives anyone could ask for.
This is pathetic 😂
Bro don't worry it's just a fight all you need to practice  more for your next fight keep up the work love your prime btw good luck 💯🙏❤️‍🔥
KSI is a sore loser.
Lol you loss just take it
You may or may not have been robbed on that win. but one thing's for sure, you were robbed of your heart on that ring... You've became heartless, jj. To attack a person after losing is one thing, but to include their family is a different issue. If you really want to leave a legacy to be remembered, stop acting like a child and accept the loss then change for the better. Don't let your ego take control of you
karma 👁️
Your legacy is tarnished JJ. This video is now one of the things I'll remember when I hear your name. This is not inspiring, this is embarrasing.
If Dream or a more hated youtuber said what you said they’d be eaten alive
stinky video..
This video should go down as a 2ND loss on KSI’s record
You lost dude. Take it like a man.
https://youtu.be/BGn28-TxmDE?si=UpAtWMV1Cl_P9d5N
Fallen from grace..bro even jake took his loss like a camp nobody cares you lost you did win in our eyes but now you taking it weird
Nobody in this comment section knows boxing, he committed and deserved the Win and him accepting that would make him a loser, Fury lost.
KSI lecturing Tommy to be a good father is out of context, did he brain-damaged you that much?
After you die this is how we’re gonna remember you
After this video I’m glad jj didn’t win
Gotta firm the L and move on.
this video shows how much tommys win got to your head lol you whining so much
🤡🤡 bad looser
“See where I came from” you went to private school ffs
Man jjs salty. Be humble bro
Yeah let’s tell my viewers to publicly harass someone that makes sense. You are 30 years old
bro no one gives a fuck if you win or lose we just love going through this journey with you
U done star jumps the whole time 😂😂
Why you gotta bring him being a father into this. Has nothing to do with your loss bro. Low blow. Dont get why you have to go there. Immature.
Two words “wet wipe”
Listen to what he says..then start commenting..stupid idiots
Now that was a knockout of a video👑
For all KSI "FANS" What the fuck are the comments on about. After watching the video the comments make no sense.  Are we watching the same video? Ksi is genuinely one of the best human beings i have followed.   If even a single person who commented watched the full fight you will know why there are fans who support Ksi genuinely  The fight was a Draw, to give the win to Tommy was a ROBBERY even with a point deduction. So this message is for Ksi, bro there are people out there who know the truth, fk these so called fans
The absolute delusion
Hey KSI, here's a tip from someone with 130 communicative IQ: Do not laugh after everything you say, no one will take you seriously. Next tip: Quit crying. You're an embarrassment to the sport. You did the one thing you DONT DO, you made enemies of the judges. You threw a tantrum, took your loss like a complete child. I seriously hope you never lace up the gloves again. We know it was YOUR promotion, and you felt betrayed like a true cheater.
Expected better from you mate, couldve made an awareness post ab the genocide in Palestine and instead you’re telling your fans to harass Tommy. 😢
your true colours are showing now, no idea how you still have a fanbase after acting like this.
Glad you cried, you lost simple as that big head
This man is exploring new depths of a human being. You lost the fight, you also lost the mental battle. You were talking mad sht prefight about how you would knock him out, you didn't but you did great overall, the least you could do was to accept the loss gracefully. Here you are, still salty, still throwing shades at Tommy, belittling him for things not even boxing related, even telling fans to harass him is beyond pathetic. I know it's irritating to lose but being vocal about it in this manner really shows your massive yet fragile ego.  I used to be a pretty big fan back in 2017-2018, it's honestly disappointing seeing how you turned out.
You lost buddy. You didin't even stand a chance. ALl you can do now, is reflect on it. You sound like one of those boxers who can't take an L after a loss.
Embarrassment
KSI soft as babyshit
This isn't a good look
JJ even if you lost for the majority part of your Fans you clearly won instead but honestly you actually let your Ego overtake you as always like you did in your previous fights and you should have never made that video where you were going to shock the world because that created a huge curse on you just like it previously did on Deji but yeah still you did very well against Tommy but unfortunately this is how life is and you have to take an L at a certain point however that should never stop you from boxing because take your little brother as an example, he lost 3 fights and could have chosen to give up and quit boxing but he didn’t and kept going forward and eventually he finally managed to win and even twice. So yeah keep it up bro and stay always strong but especially spend your time as much as you can with your family. ❤
Bro Boxing changed him,,,,,
RIP KSI
At the end of the day it’s the judges decision not yours, it was a close fight and you lost .Despite how hard you may have trained it’s no excuse to be a crybaby and conduct yourself in this manner,this type of behaviour is the reason people don’t respect influencer boxing and never will.After a loss you should accept it and move on not stagnate and linger on it:trying to insult the man who beat you and his family isn’t gonna make your loss seem any better it just shows how immature you are. I used to be a fan of you but after this video I can’t support you anymore
fatherless behavior
🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒
Delete this video, its an embarrassment. You're acting  like a child here. You're openly calling on your fanbase to harass someone because you lost. Bruh. Imagine being such a sore loser just because you put in graft and lost.
yo quit yapping ab what he’s telling his fan base to do it’s not gunna change jack either way so stfu
Respect Ksi
Bro maybe Tommy punched you in the back of your head but seriously you can’t mean that you didn’t do anything wrong when you constantly hugged him every time he was about to start throwing punches. Stop playing the victim…  tbh you’re seriously the one who is embarrassing, instead of blaming everyone else etc take responsibility for your own actions and fighting. We all know how you would have reacted if Tommy did a video like this blaming everyone else but himself
Yeah this isnt the JJ i subscribed to, bye.
What an absolute tosspot
this is the issue with influencer boxing. you got ksi in the ring turning his head so he gets hit there and crying about it and then losing and having to appeal. boxers get hit in the back of the head all the time and rarely complain about it because they realize it is a fight and shit is gonna happen especially when you are turning your head like that.
man is high on COPIUM
You might really want to think about taking this video down cuz you can serious trouble by gaslighting telling your supporters to go after him if something was to happen to either one of your supporters reliable and he could sue you the definition of character and saying lies
fam jus take the L and move on bro cus lowkey ur lookin like a wasteman when ur allowing this man to have a whole condo in ur head 😂💀 clearly ur still butthurt if ur still cryin about it brother like
I'm tired of spoiled ass YouTubers crying when they don't get their way that's lazy take some self accountability you lost if you don't want to lose don't put it in the judge's hands knock him out you can't be mad if it goes to a judge's scorecard when you have all fight to do something and you didn't get it done even if the fight got a return to would not have been the winner it would have been a tie there is no scenario where you won the fight are the people who took Tommy at his word and said if he didn't knock you out then he lost the fight that still doesn't matter technical loss and you want to talk about hitting in the back of the head you have not yet where you haven't hit someone in the back of the head so don't cry about that stupid shit and make yourself look weak and look at his family and look at your family your dad did a shity ass job at being a dad that's why you and your brother are still the Way You Are
JJ you made all of us proud of you true fans know u got the W in there and To be honest we are proud whichever way this goes ! So so proud of you ! So glad you spent some great times with your family ! Stay safe bro ❤❤
Coping and capping 🫣
Lol the comment section back at it😂
You either a die a hero or become the villain, everything he hated.. he turned into. Sad.
You just keep making it worse
Grown ass man telling kids to comment hate on another person’s posts. 💀
the cope
Stop skipping like a girl in the ring its awful
Bro you put in the work when others just put in half the work and get carried by the judges so don’t worry about others criticizing you. You’ll always be the best and you should’ve deserve the win 💯💯💯
Ksi is a great entertainer but a big sore loser. Big L
So now KSI is also a liar trying to say he's only been boxing for 3 years he don't know how to count or he's lying it's been 7 years and that's not an excuse anymore
What a sad amount of cope. Tommy is garbage and if they swapped how long they had been training boxing, ksi would win.  But Tommy won, get over it, maybe if ksi keeps fake laughing after every sentence it will change but that's unlikely 😂
You are still so mad, lol!
i really wanted you to win, but this is fucking embarrassing, like disgustingly embarrassing
THE KING IS BACK!!!!!!!
Nothing is worse than seeing the true colour of someone you been supporting for the longest finally come to light. Disgusting and pathetic, be a fucking man and take your loss and move forward.
Back when me and my mates used to lose at goldeneye we reacted like this. I mean we were kids but I can see where he’s coming from. Wouldn’t do it at 30 though.
I pray one of his friends calls him out on his behaviour soon
Who cares that you lost the fight,I'm just glud that JJ is finally back.🎉🎉🎉
yall defending ksi dont realize he lost by unanimous decision if it was split decision it would be debatable who won but UD?? cmon bruh accept LSI
😂😂😂 everyone that doesn’t know boxing
yeah u lost, and that was a good decision by the judges, u didnt deserve the win
And you still keep losing even a month after the fight. Coming after his personal life and family is beyond stupid. Lots of your 13 y.o. stans are literally harassing him all over social media for winning a fight against you I guess? This is so fu.cking low from you man. Take a break please, reflect and come back stronger. No need for this petty nonsense.
Japan holiday was legendary scaring deji 😂😂😂
KSI bro keep yo head up in my eyes you won get in the ring and fight again
He doesn't have to post,
Tbh he lost and he should accept that fact and move on.
How did this guy think he won 😂😂😂  This whole video just seems like he’s coping
If i ever see Tommy in public i will congratulate him. You lost.
You’re a rich 30 year old yet you still think the world owes you something?  You fought like shit that night, cuddling and crying your way to distance. How can you even be happy with that performance as a boxer let alone think you won?  Also Tommy gave you an opportunity so be grateful to him.
You lost JJ, just gotta accept it. Telling ur fans to go berate another is not a good look
Telling your young impressionable audience to go bully someone is just not it JJ must be hanging out with logan way too much
ksi only won once 💀
yeah u did
Lmao these comments are an L, boxing is a competitive sceene, youre not enforcing harassment you're just refusing to take an L, and i respect that. Being humble is for losers.
I knew his cockiness wasnt just him bein confident/a front to sell PPV He's a sore loser n whether he deserved this specific loss or not he definitely needed to lose n look how he's reacting Wish i was wrong bout him but he's straight up not humble, noticed it when he was pushing his music a lot more ngl
i’m confused why is everyone surprised this is literally classic ksi when has he not talked like this
The starting of the era with the ending of an era for (ksi) he is the YouTube GOAT
Sore loser
i will always love you baby
Ksi please give speed mercy 😂
now just fight jake paul and retire after that 2nd loss which is gonna come for u
You were robbed just like haaland and Francis but we move , everyone takes Ls except Floyd .
KSI definitely won that fight not by a mile, but definitely won the fight. Worst case scenario should’ve been a draw. And I feel like anyone would be rightfully pissed at what happened that night. I mean we are all human and are allowed to have emotions so the fact that you guys are calling him a child because he didn’t like the results of the fight that is also highly contested between the world. I feel like he has some leniency to be angry after the fight.
Who’s also here form Kavos
Yep ksi is washed. And those comments were paid off
Haha still hurting off thw L Tommy has broke him R.I.P KSI
Glad your back but a shame you cant just take the L and accept your loss. Move on bro move on...
OK but when are we getting baldski
Welcome back KSI
L
Yeah you did and the fight was total dog shit lmao
I mean tbh you and Tommy Furry love to hug alot. So theres rarely any fights happing lol. But you tried and thats all it matters
He trained so hard to give him a hug.
you lost take the L
KARMA IS REAL, HE GOT SLAPED BACK LIKE WHAT HE DID TO LOGAN PAUL {POINT LOSS}
and for that reason i am unsubscribing from you after 9 years of watching you, you have gone too far these last 2 years JJ, your ego is too high and your succsses has overruled your values as a human being
This video confirms that KSI has Narcissistic personality disorder
second half of the video reminds me of how i handle losses and now i wanna kms🤣
FINNALY GOT HUMBLED
KSI FANS DONT FALL FOR HIS WORDS  IF YOU TRY TO BERATE A FURY TO THEIR FACE YOU WILL PROBABLY REGRET IT LOL
TOMMY WON TOMMY WON TOMMY WON TOMMY WON    I GUESS LIFE NOT FAIR FOR YOU.
grown ass man bro this is embarassing
You cant even handle a loss, let alone a win. You didnt win. You arent a winner, your a child.
Omg dude quit with all the boxing talk. Nobody cares! Accept that you lose and move on ffs.
KSI, ur yapping I was expecting a Reddit video with the fanbase roasting u for loss 😂 Take ur L and make content bro
to be honest JJ yes tommy fury should have knocked you out considering ha boxed his whole life as you said, but you have spent so long preparing and boxing the last years and i was quite dissapointed in how you boxed, i know nothing about boxing but the form was not good... but too be so confident that you won the fight and pointing out he did no significant blows to you is just wrong... so i feel like you are finding excuses instead of embracing it tho i know it is hard to deal with it after training long days, just my opinion so please dont hate because of it, love your content :)
All bro did was dance 💀
KSI has the audacity to say that he came out better from the fight while being this salty, Imagine giving Tommy some relationship advice whilst having a history streak of abortions? This guy is so out of touch with everything and he's 30 years old as well, I repeat, 30 years of age! he's become a certified bellend, I really hope he leaves the Sidemen because I really like them and he's gonna take them down with him for sure, it's inevitable.
Millions 🤣💀💀🫵🏼u clearly lost
Tommy fury played dirty and lost that fight fair and square. People keep saying he won. But I know 70% know ksi won. Mate don’t let a body builder who can’t box mentally impact you. Now Let’s focus for the Jake Paul fight. It’s time now to prove and end all of this once and for all.
Ksi you should  be humble in victory and defeat....stop acting like a sour loser....this is not the same guy i grew up on.....stop being so petty.....man up.....dont feel sorry for yourself and mature the fuck up.....this is comng from a  subscriber and fan 😢
He a ManChild
You’re  30 😂😂
Grow up and take the L
Rare KSI L
You get unlucky in life JJ. Keep your head high, enjoy your break and hope you are doing well
Come on JJ! Man listen to us. Ive been on your channel for so long and ive been by your side through all of it but this seriously isnt you. Coming for a man talking about his wife and child? Thats cold man. Cold as fuck. You know better. Were here for you but you need to shape up. We see the Strength fam. Show us the Knowledge and Intergrity. This video is an L. Please do better.
So many fucking whiners in this comment section. I applaud JJ’s refusal to back down about Tommy not actually winning
Do i think jj won? Yes mainly cuz tommy lost a point and the fight was hugging, awakward and it just wasnt a good look for either fighters. Now that being said jj losing and doing everything logan paul did when he lost is crazy. Furthermore JJ just needs to be humble hold his L and move on. Not attack tommy and his lifestyle after losing. JJ either needs to retire or fight jake. Like the masses dont care for any more ksi fights unless its against jake. If you're not going to fight jake move on and do you.
The insecurity weeps!
7:15 Says the man who killed 4 children
All that training for a fight but never trained for growing tf up
bro you lost  stop making excuses 😂😂
With you ksi 🙌,sometimes it's hard to move on from something when you're working ass off day and night thinking about winning only these some piece of shit people don't understand that and just saying its just a lose take l and move on lmao they never been in a place like you be well brother.
a bit late mate
This video is just how is life is so difficult and shit as a millionare
ngl it's probably bias that tommy won cause that shit was rigged as fuck
Yo you went too far near the end JJ where’s ya wisdom man can feel the saltiness oozing bro
3:22 ohh didums
30 year old child loses fight, loses the appeal to overturn the decision then tells his audience to harass the man he lost to is outrageously pathetic
You need to let it go and try grow up a bit JJ. You lost bro, get over it and stop putting your energies into beating up yourself & telling others to "berate" this man in public if they see him. Take the L on the chin and move on - Probs best not to box at all if this is how u take an L.
Anyone who actually knows boxing thinks tommy won. Absolutely mental that KSI is dragging it on this long. He named eddie hearn and adesanya as people that think he won lmao that should tell you everything you need to know.
You haven't made a video because you threw a tantrum because your ego was damaged, if you trained so hard to win why did you go out and start dancing 🤡
KSI you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
This is what happens when you surround yourself with yes men who never challenge a thing you say. This video is embarrassing, your outlook on the fight is shameful, especially bringing a man’s wife and kid into it is just low. You’ve been gone for almost 2 months and your still this hurt over a fight you didn’t perform well in? Get over it I don’t care and no one should care about this fight anymore
These comments really show how many of u have actually dedicated and poured your heart out for something and watched it get taken from u lol
All these people switching up on jj cause hes pursuing something in which he feel like he didnt lose is insane to me, you all would react the same way
of course I get this recommended 2 days later
It was an embarrassment to boxing. This YouTube crossover thing has to stop. It was a hugging match, so bad  that people paid for it😂
This video makes me never wanna watch ksi box again lmaooo
ksi bro shut up 😂
Mate, you're 30. Do you hear yourself? What the fuck are you on about? You've taken a bigger L by saying what you've said in this video than from the fight itself.
Ya win some ya lose some. Ur still amazing ❤
Whole video is just sore tbh we all know you won and he’s not the boxer he thinks he is clearly so why lol
Dont promote your "LEGACY" if you dont know how to take a L.
Bro mustve forgotten all the shit he gave deji for losing and how Deji wasnt humble after losing to Alex 😂
U lost u lost no excuses learn to take a L like a man
KSI Came back to his family. SDMN. I and all your supports love you and will always. You have all my respect. Stay humble and be as awesome as you are
Ksi you’re so immature man. Absolutely appalling behaviour from a 30 year old.
Way to be the bigger mature person. Getting your followers to jump on any post Tommy does. I’m not even a Tommy fan but that’s just bitter. Get over it bro 😂
The fight was horrendous should’ve been a draw at most. Seeing how you reacted is sad. Losing and defeat are the best teachers. Telling your fan base to attack another man and then you coming at his family shows what kind of person you are supporters.
tf bruh is just defamin tony
Pathetic bro
u def won  just based of the score card not only that he hot u behind the head so many times and they ignored it wrd
All you did was hug him the entire fight. How much of a sore loser can you be?
smh ive been watching boxing since a child and even i knew you lost im disapointed at how much of a sore loser you are being about this lost
You are a horrible human being KSI
KSI is beginning to act like Logan Poul, we basically lost KSI. This man can't see the truth anymore he's delusional just like Logan.  Next up is probably scamming he's followers.
just take the L bro 💀
lol talked all that shit, lost, went home and cried.
Ksi you are just a sore loser
Mate you are 30 yo talking about someones role as a father and telling an audience of kids to harass him in the internet... embarrassing. You lost bro that style is not boxing dont expect to win fights if you dont score jabs or punches
he’s so jarring accept the loss
I don’t get the hate for this tbh 😭 not even a dickrider and sure it’s unnecessary, but I mean ngannou posted for weeks after his fight with fury on how he won and what on Tyson fury even though he technically “lost.” Lot of people including professionals like Mighty Mouse and adesanya thought ksi won so I see how he’s entitled to feel like he won even though I personally thought it was a tie. He still dislikes tommy and that’s clear but I don’t get how that’s an issue. He doesn’t have to start liking him just because their fight ended. And he didn’t really say anything disrespectful about Tommy’s family, just about how tommy interacts with his family. And the berating tommy in public bit was immature but it just seemed moreso like a joke to me? And telling fans to troll under Tommy’s post don’t seem that crazy. It’s just social media anyways. The only bad part could be the berating in public but I guess maybe I’m wrong but I thought it was said in jest or as a joke 💀
L
This is pretty embarrassing. Took one loss and he now asks his fans to berate a man just doing his job and putting on a show for the people.
Bro always trying to find something to cry about 🤣😂😂🤣😂😂
Finally you have shocked the world.
It is not Tommy Furies fault that the JUDGES may or may not have fucked you over mate
niga delete your channel 😭👍
KSI has become Logan's long last brother A complete ego testicle Man Child he himself won his tough fights by some Anonymous decision but blames others if they one .I used to look upto himbefore his wade situation but now he has become like every other scumbag influencer who misuse his influence.       "You either die hero or live long enough to see yourself to become Villain "
Bro really won     In hugging.
Classic KSI W
seems like the whole legacy thing is down the gutter!🎉🎉
Next Reddit video gonna be interesting 😂😬
dude this breaks my 10yr old heart bro, i been a fan since then and hearing you ask people to attack him is a bit too much. he has a wife and a kid man.
Ok man look jj this is a L man I hope your know yes it's true a lot of people thought you won. Or at least drawed and fair enough your doing a appeal but the whole go berate him on everything come on man that pretty petty and not something I would expect from you at this point man either fight jake or just be done with boxing take the W of a lot of people saying you didnt really lose and leave this behind but the go berhate him thing is a big L and definitely a loss of respect
they overreacting I couldn’t care what ksi says or does as long as he’s still funny
🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂
okay so Tommy didn’t win- KSI just lost. Point deduction’s kinda :/ but gotta make it real obvious if you wanna cement your win in a fight like that. It was too dead.
You weren't boxing rather star jumping throughout the whole fight
C’mon dude. I love and support you but this ain’t it. You lost bro. There’s nothing wrong with losing. Losses are actually lessons and this was one you desperately needed. It’s how you handle it and come back is what makes you different. But bashing Fury and his family isn’t cool man. It makes you look horrible. Resorting to personal levels because you can’t handle a loss is unacceptable dude. Take the L and move on and stop crying and complaining bro. This isn’t a good look for you.
omg why are people getting on to ksi honestly if your not his fan just say so stop pretending. him telling his fans to say he won and support him is not tormenting someone stop bitching its embarrassing.They already robbed him of being a winner in public eyes . tommy needs to see himself for who he is in the boxing world
Why r u attacking his parenting skills, I’m a fan of u but that’s a bit 😬😬
Yeah you lost.
people show their true colors at their lowest..
You train harder and faster than you perform
Dont understand all the hate, sure you might have not fully accepted the Loss, but it seems the other dude was kinda a B and also it sounds like it was an even fight so hey maybe it was unfair in the end. no worries brudda
The man really went after Wade for mentioning the Jake Paul tweet in his live stream and then him simply forgetting! Like do you seriously expect him to remember every single little detail of what happened in his THIRTY HOUR live stream?? Like that’s just so wack man.
yea you lost me as a fan jj.. but i think you’re saying all these things just to get a rematch with tommy.
I don’t really need to summarize how salty ksi is after the loss, because it looks like everyone else has. But one thing I will say that tweet from Jake Paul isn’t deleted. It’s still there so that’s another lie lol.
Such a crappy response. This dude is bitter as hell. He really thinks he did something.
LLLLLLLLLLLL
To be honest, after your match with Tommy, I stopped watching your videos mate. Just boxing has this habit of showing your true character and the amount of fake shit that went on during that time was unbelievable and you are still talking about it. Don't fool us bruv.
This is quality documentary of a man’s ego turning into a little girl he’s finished
And yer even bringing the mans misses and kid into it, nowt to do with them, that he won, it was a boxing fight not a fukin family feud fight, this is the worst ksi videos i have ever watched
nothing was wrong with this vid yall crying for no reason in these comments. unsub if you want to watch someone who fakes being humble
I lost 1,000 gambling i cried too
everyone berate ksi in public tell him he lost fair and square
Grow up man, the judges decided the outcome not Tommy, so to tell your fans to harass him is not acceptable, ye get knocked down ye get up again, that's life JJ, deal with it
Bro the biggest hugger ever and then crying because he lost 😂 just shut up loser and move on.
the fact that you won the first 3 in everyones eyes, plus a point deduction, means you win.... but hes a fury, the boxing name, and they "dont want to bring shame to the sport of boxing"
Wow ditching on Tommy, yeah okay , move on man it's over.
Is what it is, win some lose some life isn't always about winning if it was you'd never learn anything.
This is an L. Take the loss, move on.
This is probably the worst video I've seen from KSI man, its just sad how he can't move on from the loss. I get that he feels like he got robbed but honestly as he said, life is unfair, but we move on
The whole event was a disgrace to combat sports. You should be ashamed. Everyone involved should be ashamed.
Come on, JJ. You’re better than this. Or at least you used to be. Disappointed in your reaction here.
how is there 1.4 million views and 13 million likes
I sort of always knew this was who you were deep down, we just haven’t seen it because you haven’t lost. Now that you have, you’re clearly a lot more insecure and hurt than you care to admit. You can chase after as much success as you want, but it won’t change you. Win or loss. So I recommend you do some real soul searching, and get some real mental health guidance. Doing all of this work will only put a bandaid on the issue. Emotional issues need emotional solutions and you can’t solve it with boxing matches, prime, dropping albums, or through YouTube. You need to seek out help and prioritize that.
His reaction to losing a YouTube boxing fight is an absolute disgrace.
JJ you’re lit and you’ve come a long way we are all proud, but please stop showing off the elbow ko, you landed a crisp overhand, show that instead.
YOU DID NOT BOX! You hugged. In a boxing a match, you must box. It doesn't matter if you won "the fight" it's not a fight. It's a boxing match. Tommy won, by default. Tommy didn't even win, you just didn't engage in the sport.
Ksi you’re a hard working athlete I’ll give you that but in boxing man , you’re so erratic and can’t fight for your life . I love you bro but to box you gotta know how to  actually BOX . You throw random wild punches . Tommy deserved it for his composure . You got strength but no skill .
Probably the dumbest video ive seen in a while bro violating Tommy's family cause he lost a boxing match and telling his 11 year old fans to harass tommy. I think he got hit in the head or something because his taking too much copium.
I’ve been waiting I thought he might have lost his mind I’m happy you’re okay and comeback stronger like canelo
Bro u lost me after this one, ur insecure and it clearly shows. You took the loss like a child.
Congrats, you just sank lower than Jake Paul by sicking your fans on a guy for getting declared the winner in a boxing match.  And for the record, I too believed you won that fight...doesn't justify being the PoS you're portraying yourself as right now.
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain
This video is just sad and you can’t even take that loss.
i've always wanted him to lose because it feels quite deserving for him because of his ego and how arrogant he has acted throughout his boxing career
JJ we stand with you and support you everytime broo..    love you Man ❤
JJ acting younger than the average cocomelon viewer in the second half of this
Ian gon lie gang I can’t speak fa everyone eles but ima tru supporter and ion care datchu lost fam but u did lose doe dat doesn’t change till u do sum ab it den da people who fw u fr gon be dar to see it but till den u lose bruh do something about it boi
Even Jake thought you won, L Tommy.
You’re acting like a child
Bro you lost, the copious you’re huffing is insane, you’re just upset you lost after so much shit talking and you made an entire video laughing at people who told you you were too confident, you deserve this loss
Least Jj's a good hugger lol
I don’t know anything about boxing but I do know that you should have won. But at the end of the day it doesn’t matter to me if you win or lose I will always be one of your supporters!❤ Luv u JJ
Always been a KSI fan, and wanted him to win, but after seein the way he has reacted to losing, I'm disappointed he lost.
This IS NOT what boxing is about! Telling your minions to go after a man on the street just because he got the decision is WEAK! Wtf ru thinking?? It’s irrelevant now but I had the fight a draw, so could have gone either way anyway.
Seeing how the toxic Tommy Fury fans insult JJ is heartbreaking to me. JJ may have done something bad and lost many fans, but I will remain a proud non-delusional KSI fan. Seeing how people downgrades, you pissed me off. Love for JJ.
7:59 I like ksi but this is just words of a sore loser who cant accept a loss smh
You have a L
You got rekt by Tommy Fury tbh.
Actual manchild. Cry more. Go sit in your corner and stay there.
grow up bro
BRUH GTA 6 TRAILER NGA
true character is shown in loss not victory, and you have clearly shown your true colors, accept the L and move on man, no need for this childish shit of sending your fans after him, get a grip bro
Man is named KSI but in this video he lost the I...  The integrity is gone so do we just call him KS?
looks like CTE to me
I say it was a draw at least but if it you should’ve won
I’m a KSI fan. That being said. How was Tommy supposed to fight? If all JJ did was throw a huge sloppy overhand and once it missed jump into a clinch?
The amount of hypocrisy displayed in this video is mind blowing.
I lost state champs in high school it happens to the best of us man. See where you went wrong. learn from it. Keep moving forward.
JJ man there is only so many times you can pull these personal attacks before God has enough of your BS and opens your blind fanbase minds to your BS. Take the L and move on.
jake honestly fought tommy better lets be honest and stop the meat riding i’m not a jake or ksi or tommy fan but the way jake fought tommy was more of a professional fight and ksi only jumped around and hugged and fought in a clinch which are not that power of a punch. Final verdict should’ve been a draw and rematch should happened but again I honestly dont wanna see ksi fight all he does is hug and jump around
Ksi you lost simple as that. You didnt do anything convincing in the fight. Lets be real all those non boxers saying you won dont know shit abt boxing, its not their field. You didn't win you lost. We still love you, your still the man, i still believe you have more potential and you could win more fights, but you're not a pro boxer not like the real dudes that be fighting with actual skill and technique. Be humble and take the L, its just disappointing that your telling your 10 year old fan boys to go tell a grown man ,who beat you, "you lost the fight, ksi is better" grow up you're like 30 acting like a middle schooler telling the elementary school boys to say stupid shit cause they think your cool. Congratulate the man who beat you and get over it, your still rich, fit, strong, handsome and got life in the palm of your hands just let this 1 thing slide
Take the loss like a champ humble your self and move forward don’t need to be a sore loser
tommy son
finally your humble 🙏🏻
nah man is this guy delusional? jake never said you won the fight, he said that you both were trash
Just lose humbly the decision went against no need to be a bitch about Fr just charge it and keep it stepping
its funny ksi thinks dancing in the ring and throwing and missing an overhand right should make him win a fight. This guy is a child
Deserved Loss
This guys ego is too big
30 yr old guy btw, telling his 15 yr old fans to berate another man
bruh I thought the loss would make him humble . But this guy just has no sportsmanship whatsoever. Pathetic!
Ksi won fair and square you all can hate all you want but everyone saying tommy won aint got shit to back it up😂
Jake Paul got a convincing defeat from Fury, he got his ass handed to him in ways he did not see from the old MMA fighters he was fighting. Nobody was backing him like they were backing you, because it was clear as day he lost. He got a compliment from Fury being “For 3 years of experience, you did amazing. I’ve been doing this for 12.”   Then he completely used that and shoved it in his face by berating him on his brother’s podcast.  Yet that was no where nearly as bad as whatever the hell this is
Bros salty ash😭
Only came here to dislike
Fck all these haters
Drop the ego and move on
You won big brother hope you get that appeal your amazing hardworking and fair and by the actions ya did you’re a winner for me
KSI is acting like a child bruh😂
Pull your diaper up and own up to the loss like the crypto zoo guy
As much as I like KSI, I hate to say he’s basically coping right now. He’s acting the same way Logan Paul did when he lost. “ there’s no way I lost a fight. The judge is messed up. I want to appeal.”
You've come a long way, you've changed in good ways and some bad, I'm glad you're slowing down and enjoying things, you seem happier now, but just remember one very important thing, I told you so
Yo he can bitch about it if he wants to… seems like he does a shit ton of other shit in his daily life everyone thinks you won and you did in my eyes g
How weird to mention the stuff about his kid
Immature and dishonourable broski. Do better 🙏
When jj who is millionare and a successful person himself says life is not fair, then what about us living poor and in several bad conditions!!😢
You know it happens
Can every1 stop glazing he has to stop being salty and acting like a baby
Lets go ksi. Don't let the other fucks say anything that gets to your head
Holy shit this is embarrassing
holy shit just let go
Ur finished.
30 years old and asking your fanbase to harrass a 24 year old both on social media and in real life. You are an asshole mate. I could understand you not dealing well with the loss initially when you didn't have much time to think things through, but this is just pathetic.
I’ve watched your videos, listened to your music and rooted for you in boxing matches but don’t think I wanna support you anymore after what I just watched, I have lost all respect for you JJ please do better.   P.S.  At least Logan took it like a champ after losing to you in 2019.
Ive been supporing this guy since i discovered him, but after the fight when i saw his reaction and especially after watching this vid, this guy needs to shut his ass up smh
dw ksi. We all know u got robbed
I agree KSI shoulda won, but seeing his reaction to the loss makes me think it was necessary for him.   He did not handle this loss very well. Even Logan handled his loss better which is something I never thought I'd say.
w
L
Bro if only we could still see dislikes ... Jj man I'm disappointed
Logan pauls influence is so horrible for you.
Guysguysguys i promise u he is not going to read all these individual paragraphs abt how ur disappointed he has millions of fans like lets be frl hes gonna stay egotistical
Whos here after the kavos video
A fight till the end ❤
The only loss is thr fan fan who paid for that hugging match
love to see it jj hope that appeal comes back with a yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqjJbQFA7XY&ab_channel=Pranavraii
Hey dont listen to the fair weather fans i definitely think you have every right to be upset its a bs outcome you should take a rematch knock him out and leave no doubt the fat neek is the goat of youtube boxers
The cope is unreal 😂😂 I mean be proud of what you came to b as a influencer boxer. HOWEVER telling the fanbase to harass another man in public because you’re still butthurt af ain’t chill fam.
Yeah but Tommy Fury the GOAT though
Come on jj this ain’t right
Deal with it in a humble way JJ. Whatever happened happened does not give you any right to command your fans to harass him. Go for a rematch if you really deep in your heart thought you won you will be surprised how a boxer adapts.
been watching everyday since 2017 i just knew u would always be the best, i saw ur will
BUCK BROKEN
You still lost
Clown behavior
no one is going to comment negative things on others people's posts to stroke your ego bro that was a weird ask. learn from this and become a better fighter and BETTER PERSON.
Christ. What a video.   Enjoy the fallout from this one :)
much needed loss and ego reset
Bruh the amount of drama JJ has had with his own family, and he’s chatting shit about Tommy lmao. JJ a 🤡
2023 is such a bad year for ksi, he lost himself genuinely
Waffling
This shouldn't be about winning or losing a fight. It should be about how you grew up from the result. However, it seems you haven't JJ... it's sad to see because you seemed more chill and humble in the sidemen sundays but this video ruins it all.  I was waiting for you, as a fan, to become more humble, more comprehensive and more mature but instead you act childishly by relentlessly mocking and pulling down Fury. It's exactly how other YouTubers act. You're better than them don't become your worst enemy, hate is useless.  Keep in mind JJ that we'll be there for you although.
Yikes.. why did you make this video
In writing, you lost.
Nah man, im out. Harssing Tommy cause you lost? What happened to you man? You used to be somebody. Now youre just everything you hate. You wanna be? Be gone?
Someone is a bit salty they lost lol.
KSI - the biggest cry baby to ever live and a sore loser respect the LOSER
Unfortunately, whether you won the fight or not, its obvious the WBA wont have a outsider embarrass the professional sport by beating on of their own professionals. Which to me is even more embarrassing.
One thing that life has taught me is that its not about your actions but your reactions to the things that life has to throw at you that truly matter. When you keep winning in life, you feel like you're the shit. You feel untouchable. Its when you loose in life that truly brings your honest character out. You learn about who you are as a  person. You learn and you grow and you get back up after understanding humility. I feel sad while saying this (because I've been an OG fan, literally grew up into an adult whilst watching all your content) but your true colors are very evident now. You are so egotistical, so full of yourself and I honestly believe now that you needed to be humbled. But I guess  you chose to be a pathetic sore loser instead. You just lost an OG fan JJ.
7:50 pathetic
You had all this time to process your loss and this is what you come up with?  Encouraging harassment to your young impressionable audience, attacking a person's family and straight-up denial just because he won a decision over you? JJ, as a long time supporter and an observer of your journey, my disappointment is immeasurable and I can not believe I've been supporting a sore loser and a bitter crybaby all this time.  Learn to take stuff on the chin, learn to be a true fighter and maybe your long-time fans will support you again.  Sorry, I'll cherish the memories of the good old days and good old FIFA KSI and try to forget this sour and bitter one that can't take a loss like a man.  Goodbye.
funny how like a lot of people i see saying that fury on even with the Point deduction..
Could this be the much needed revival of the reddit?
Leave him alone all of a sudden everyones tommy fury fanboyz. Ksi won get over it, hes right in this video and tommy has slagged ksi for months.
Ksi 👑
meh, as a person.. meh people are meh. and you sir are eh..
That's why he sides with a big Scammer like Logan!   You need more humbling! Pathetic looser.  What a tag team:  - Logan THE SCAMMER Paul - KSI THE DEFEATED SORE LOOSER
Take your loss like a man and shut up about Tommy fury now
Coming after him not being around his child is VILE but ay 🤷
i was pissed when you lost but wtaf dawg
Fuck me respect to your effort but you need a different editor 😂
Petition for KSI to change his nickname from “The Nightmare” to “Tommy’s Nightmare”
Knowledge, strength, i̶n̶t̶e̶g̶r̶i̶t̶y̶
KSI do GTA6 trailer
How can he forget his beef with his brother in 2019-2020??
I love JJ but you took a break which is understandable but you're still coming back whining about it just that the loss like a adult and use it as a learning experience and move on
W
Fair play to u brother u have accomplished so many things
He lost because he getting punched in the head only and that can cause a concussions for him so he shouldn’t won if Tommy didn’t punch his head but still tommy. actually win fair and square
5:43 man this is just straight cope. You’ve went from calling yourself the goat to now demeaning yourself in order to insult the guy who beat you. What the fuck are you doing?
This was very nicely played response from after the fight - TRUE, HILARIOUS, TRUE, HILARIOUS. It’s crazy how this guy makes anything funny 😂
KSI clowns on every opponent in general tho. It’s not even that deep.
Unsubbed.
Where is lilmaxkidd i miss him already 😂
We need the reddit Roast on the fight video. Come on jj, we missed you bro.
There’s no shame in loosing, even if it was a BS loss. The fact of  the matter a YOUTUBE BOXER, fought a PRO BOXER, and it went to split decision. You did the best you could.
Nah nah, your training was ok but your form didn't look like training you. That was a draw at most, but for him to put up a good fight against a supposed professional,  hats off. They will never let ksi win against a "pro" boxer and the brother of Tyson
Finally your back JJ
Surely this guy can't lack this much self-awareness, that he's utterly blind to how much of a hypocrite dude is... Dude laughed at Logan for appealing, then man goes on to appeal himself under arguably a just as close fight. - Going as far to involve a King's Counsel... LOL  Man just stick to doing what you're actually passionate about and steer away from something that involves competition and the risk of losing to another human being with an actual pulse, because it's clear -- As much as you wanna try and delude yourself otherwise -- That you have a clear inability to tolerate losing without acting like a child about it..  Man started the video on a fairly decent tune by reflecting, then man goes to try and go all private life on a guy he lost to, and then subsequently 'weaponizes' his community against another individual.. Literally can't make it up LOL  Actually used to be a fan up until 4-5 months ago, but at this point your ego is writing cheques your body can't cash, by a long shot.
What a helmet
Bro u a big ass baby
repeat after me, "im a sore loser so i made this video" 😐
Y’all soft
Yeah… you lost me at the “harass him” part
It was funny seeing JJ cry like a baby after losing against Tommy. Spitting his dummy out because the decision didn't go his way... 😂
When hugging doesn’t win you the fight. jj: 😮😮😮😮
We love you jj
Sore loser
Worked so hard to dance about and grapple 😂😂😂😂😂
Answer; Yes, you lost and first of to yourself. You talking about legacy and acting like a spoilt child is just immature
Bro take a break go on a holiday u deserve it bro
Really disappointed that youve actively asked your followers to harass someone else online... You've had a month to think all this through and this is the oath you chose? I think you may need to re evaluate those around you if you're making decisions like this as this isnt the KSI that ive watched from day 1
so the result of the appeal hasn't yet been decided or?
A real fighter would’ve took the L
The PBA took so long that we don’t even care anymore. But I’m glad you went back to consistent Sidemen content because that’s honestly where you’re best
OK, OK, OK. Yes, we all have our own opinions on YouTube,  twitter and on reddit. We all have the same sort of emotions about the way JJ is acting in this video. But, lets not judge JJ for these things. Instead of cussing and putting him down, we should encourage better behaviour.  JJ, u are inspiration to Many, u will conttinue to be an inspiration to many. U have fallen below par and are disappointing many fans. The ksi i have grown to love for over 10 years, is..... an inspiration!! After this video, u come across as someone who is childish, has no sportmanshipish and noninspirational. The ksi i thought i knew, would have shrugged off this loss and came back 100 times stronger and harder! Asking fans to berate tommy in public is just childish, irresponsible and immoral!  Please just take this loss, retract ur video statements and take up tommy fury in a rematch, if there is a rematch clause! U can and will beat tommh fury, i know u can. Show the world that u r the number 1 youtube boxer, who can fight anyonne on youtube or the professional boxing competitors that are out there. Show us the ksi that inspiers his fan base and takes the L for us all! 😊
I agree with Jj he definitely won
KSI is so two faced man. This is just making me like Jake Paul even more.
You done nothing to win. Deluded still in defeat. Sidemen on the decline with their takes lately
Mate just because you done better than Tommy in the fight doesn’t mean ur a good boxer ygm so if u wanna fight better get better coaches and do a fuck ton of sparring
Nah bro, take the L.
LSI😂😂😂😂
I hope we can see more boxing!!! Truly feels like the nightmare
I clicking on this video, expecting the post reflection humble ksi but I can see that he has not returned. Not only has he not recognised the mistakes he made from tantroming and kicking a screen, to overly disrespecting his opponent and his opponents supports before the fight. But although maybe he should have won and he also believes he should have won, he is still relentlessly hung up on his loss. It is truly sad to see how negatively he has progressed, without the integrity in ksi I will now unsub from KS...
Love you KSI but I’m gonna keep it 100%, the way you handled this loss is completely unacceptable. Going after Tommy’s family is such a low blow and genuinely the lowest you’ve ever stooped to. You’re always about Knowledge, Strength, and Integrity but this time you were an absolute manchild and an immature pussy. Do better. As a long time fan, I am completely disappointed in you.
Honestly the most pathetic video I have ever seen. Just full of excuses for the fight going as far as attacking Tommy Fury for his dance moves and blaming him for "not taking care of his child"? Its none of your business man. Its not connected to the fight at all. Claiming that you "gave him a competitive match"? What was competitive from your way of playing? It was not boxing it was a mocking the viewers. Never once did you admit defeat like a man ( even Jake Paul did ) and going as far as saying "keep reminding Tommy that I won in the comments of his posts" purposely making your viewers attack Tommy and send hate. Shame on you man. I though you were better than this. Really really pathetic.
Been a fan,since legit the start and just u really became what u hated  and mocked others for doing
I have been watching ksi for a long time. Telling your fans to harass him is really low tho. Not a fan of this mate. You have this platform and you use it to slander someone for 5 minutes. 😢😢.
Be humble
I was really hoping this shmutz would just stop with the immaturity and accept his loss. Not “wahhhh everyone thought I won I tried so hard I should’ve won I came out better than Tommy he’s an L he couldn’t knock out a YouTuber” and then criticising him enjoying life. Telling your fans to go after him and harass him in public. Straight embarrassing.
Remember when you laughed at Logan for trying to appeal? You sound pretty petty and hypocritical, and encouraging people to harrass him? That's wild 🤣Have some grace and grow up, damn
I’ve been a fan for a long time now, seeing you fight Joe Weller changed me. You taught me that you can do anything if you work hard.  You’ve been my hero for years. But this isn’t the way. Knowledge, Strength and Integrity stand for something. To people like me, to a lot of your fans. This isn’t you JJ, you have to be better. Accept the loss. Move on! You’re still our champion. It’s okay to lose. We all lose. No one is above losing. Sometimes you put the work in and you come up short…that’s just life.   I hope you see that you’re wrong to go after his family and apologize. Go take time for yourself. I rather not watch your videos and know you’re happy than watch you and see you miserable..   Do better JJ. We love you.

sore loser. he was making fun of logan pauls appeal lol. The irony
Can't wait until the sidemen turn this into a funny joke
going after his family is crazy. common ksi L
So so you made a 9 minute video crying and complaining after long come on man grow up
But he still beat you and got a point taken away so like👀
i’m stance is neutral in this situation but ksi don’t tell your fans to harass someone after you lost
0:35 I’ve never cried so much ever at one sentence
Keep spreeding the positive energy
bro one thing you got robbed asf
Think I'm officially done with you jj man, even jake had more grace in defeat than you, plus the arrogance you've shown over the years lately, it's a far cry from fifa ksi.... I understand you change with the times but you've changed in the worst way... I'm sad but, unsubscribing... bye man
more like hugging not boxing🤪
When Volk lost to Islam, 99% of the mma world thought Volk won, but did he cry and complain non stop when it didn’t go his way? No. He said he thought he won, but then got back into camp and went on with it. You need to do that as well.
Take the L man.
God, seeing this comment section really showed me how pathetic and weak society is lmfaooooo.
Just take your loss
Tommy fury lost
Everyone knows it’s fucked JJ even all the fury’s know boxing is rigged man look at Tyson fury’s fight, he lost too but apparently won. Glad you’re back
JJ, it’s time to get hyper
Hii Ksi I look up to you so much your mum idol your such a hard worker and motivation make me wanna work hard like you all I wanna say is thank you so much for being a great role model I'm so happy you uploadeddd❤
Ur boxing was awful and u lost because u have no technique wake up ur not good and the fact ur still delusional after this long off makes me question your character. I have had mates of mine where they believe they won as well but they accept it and move on, u should to.
Immature asf, like 2 of those ppl said you actually should’ve one lol.
This is the pettiest behavour i ever seen as us fans  we understand that your lost and its oke to admit it but crying like baby about it and bitching is the worst thing you can do and you briging tommy s family in this wich is so bizaare and that just shows your real true colors man
You claim to be a professional boxer, but mentioning Tommy's child? That's WAY outta line bro. Like what if tommy said something about Ethan's child? You would probably get pissed. Leave Tommy's kid out of this bro, he had nothing to do with the fight. Also, YOU. FUCKING. LOST. Deal with it. Learn from it. Embrace it. You can't win them all man. You're not Mayweather. I've been watching you since 2016 man. I thought you were better then this. Don't let ONE loss predict your future as a boxer. But like you say "I'm a professional boxer". Okay? SO START FUCKING ACTING LIKE ONE and learn from it to better yourself!
Bro is coping incredibly hard.
Seems alot like a video logan paul made
Take the L and keep it pushing. It’s Not that deeo
Doubling down on his obnoxious prideful arc I see. Instead of justifying himself as better than in boxing he scrambles to say he's better than cuz he's rich famous musician etc...who cares? Conflating competence with pride is a losing formula, but we'll see....
Immature
I’ve lost so much respect for you JJ
I hope we get jj back into music next year!!!!
Guys ksi got robbed what would u guys do if u guys got robbed literally stats doesn’t lie ksi won because he done alot more than Tommy he got point deduction for 6 illegal shots jj honestly how far he came from gaming to boxing Tommy fury to stay n with tommy embarrassing for fury family KSI true winner!!!!!!
The start of this was the Legacy tatt, we gotta lose these egos bro,should of remembered that fate loves irony
Bro it took you 1 month to say that you lost 😂😂😂😂
lol bro will look at Tommy’s comments but not his, telling him HE LOST
this is honestly the most embarrassing thing i’ve ever seen.
Ksi, your getting hate that you do or do not deserve...just accept the defeat its not the end of the world
Can we finally see the Jake Paul fight now 🙏
It’s sad that boxing is seen as such a respectful sport but to see KSI show such lack of respect for his opponent was disappointing. Be a good sport, accept the loss and don’t be a sore loser. The lowest thing you can be below a loser is a sore one 😬 embarassing.
If you lose you lose no need to get your fans to target your opponent if you feel like you lost show the judges why you shouldve won with dedication no need to be super petty and be a sore loser your being alot more embarrassing then the guy your talking about.
bro is so immature
His ego is bigger then his forehead
Bros ego is his curse lmao.  That’s what happens when you grow up completely spoiled and never face true adversity in life. Bro made hundreds of millions playing video games and messing around with his friends. No real life experience or humility.  Some people are so poor, the only thing they have is money
L sympathy
Blud says he doesn't care then gets his fans to harass tommy LSI
JJ don‘t listen to these other fools in the comment section, the Jury was bought by the Fury-Lobby, you‘re not a sore loser you‘re just right. People love to see you lose, f them and keep going, be yourself and keep winning
L
You let yourself down big time with this video. You lost, suck it up.
Waiting for the laughing at: KSI video.😆
Stop filtering the comments
womp womp
This ain't it chief
7:50 bro is wildin'
KSI man just take the L and move on bro
What is bro talking about
I knew he wasn't gonna do a reddit tho lmao
L on jj part
Bro Dej took the losses better than you. This is embarrassing behaviour.
Im one of KSI "haters" People called me a hater because whenever KSI attacks someone like the Pauls, I defended them. I was called Jake fanboy or Logan Fanboy from KSI fanboys. Now the tables had turned. KSI is dealing with Karma. He's human. Human and humanity growth doesn't has an age. I don't care if he was 100 years old. People only grow by experience not by age so stop saying stupid sh#t like "He's old n acting like this" Maturity doesn't have an age. It's only developed by experience. Half of the people who's attacking him are hypocrites. For some reason, as flaw humans, we expect other humans to be perfect. KSI clearly needs more time. Not to calm down But to heal and forgive and accept his lost.  Maybe he needs to chill with Jake taking some of that spiritual earth medicine Ayawaska or something. But KSI, he's ok. If he looses fans, that's ok. You find your real fans when you're rock bottom. Im becoming a fan because lm interested in his growth. And I like the YouTubers who are human, flawed and outcast. Because I am flawed and hated by many so I tend to follow the people everyone is going against.
What a loser
Bro gotta cut ties with logan. Hes changing him... prime shit changed him
say what you will about the Tommy Fury fight, but I've not seen one YouTuber who works harder than KSI. Not one.
-KSI expecting the comments to agree with him "😏😂" -KSI reading the actual comments: "🙁😰"
This is disgusting, how he is a role model to young kids is beyond me,
biggest L
If you stand in a corner every round bouncing up and down like your on a trampoline then move in and hug you will never win as technically that is not "boxing"
brother u threw an overhand and hugged for the entire match
Ksi just proved he's a man child and his teenage fan base are showing more maturity than him. I have no clue how people can see this guy as their role model...
Tommy won the fight. Doing jumping jacks doesn't win fights
Yikes.
Oh my God I didn’t even finish the video before just came back after the Kavos video and can’t that I’m disappointed but I am.
Why’s bro making a video a month or 2 after the fight lmao , We already know you lost so do you.. twice! 1st on the night when the decision was made and 2nd The way you conducted yourself after acting like one sore loser🤦‍♂️ then your manager mams saying he’s gonna do the 2nd of 3 stages of an appeal lmfao Bro just accept the fact you lost .. icl you needed humbling and it happened! Ksi literally thought he was the goat the best ever better than Tyson Ali and he got humbled 🤷🏽‍♂️
JJ just gave himself another L with this video
As an og fan who’s been there from the start you’ve become the thing that you feared I’m sorry jj but the money and fame has gone to your head you used to be likeable and now you’re not I compete in powerlifting and sometimes you win and sometimes you lose but THE one thing you don’t do is tell your followers to go and harass someone especially when you’re fans are young and impressionable. JJ I’m sorry but you’ve changed and it’s not good and it’s sad but you’ve changed for the worst and it’s not good especially with the ages of your newer fans please jj we want the old you not the egotistical one who can’t take a loss I’m sorry but Jake has more respect than you and it shows especially when he lost. I used to think that you were a good person and now I think the worst
When you just accept ups and down and part of life, life becomes somewhat easy to deal with
Can't lie your all are bunch of delusional and completely and ridiculous type of  wrong people,the only bad and unacceptable JJ did was involving Tommy fury and his dad apart from that no, nothing JJ was not "evil" per say!
My man has just told his fans its green light to get tommy on site💀
Embarrassing video
Wtf JJ. This is heartbreaking, I’ve looked up to you for years mate. Mainly because you were the type of guy that would never say or do stuff like this. Yeah you lost, that’s life. Telling your millions of fans to berate him for winning is disgusting. Sorry man, you’ve lost a fan with me.
woop woop!!
gta 6 reaction?
All blud did was hug him the whole time😭💀💀
We respect you
Gg
Lsi
Rematch
In all of the highlights I saw JJ missed the majority of his throws and Tommy landed the majority of his. Either way both should be embarrassed.
This man salty!!!😅😅😅🤡 🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂
Logan has really rubbed off on you...
Very immature. I don't know of any child who would act this way. Nevermind a grown man. Grow a pair of balls. Stop being delsuional and wake up. You lost. Noone actually cares. I was willing to forget about this fight and call it terrible by both sides but JJ is handing Tommy the W by behaving like a prepubescent boy. You owe one to Tommy for these comments. He made you a load of money, at least show some respect.
Bro no one gives a fuck- do a reddit video 💀
this is cringe
ksi just needs to except the defeat and say he wants to reach match to knock him out say it don’t go to judges decision
JJ you should’ve won  and it’s very disappointing that this W was stolen from you. Also, fuck DAZN. I just realized that they are going to charge me for an entire year when I only meant to sign up for the monthly plan. Their website and app are so trash and in the heat of the moment I guess I picked the wrong one and they won’t refund or allow me to cancel early. CRAZY.
KSI definitely won but it would’ve been a shitty win because there is video footage where his corner left their mics on and they’re telling him to clench so Tommy hit him in the back of the head and will get point deductions. It’ll be easier to win.
L
Way to take that loss like a pro JJ, defiantly an extremely mature take especially the part where you talked about the mans family and encouraged your fan base to harass him. Honestly im not sure who's worse you or Logan Paul at this point.
As a fan, I'm not going to sit here and say I think harassing his posts is a good idea. It's childish... It's done, move on. You've done well to get where you are, don't ruin it.
Not even mad about the loss mad you left us out of the loop
Bruh, homie completely got broken by this fair loss, even PBA broke him twice now. The dude is even asking for his fans to go harass Tommy in public, this is complete madness😂😂
The amount of damage control that goes on after boxing matches is so cringe
sore loser
I knew he was gonna turn out like this ages ago man. Glad I stopped watching him years ago but fr hope he gets humbled and turned out better.
Tommy won
shame on you KSI. Why are you going about tommy fury's personal life my guy. You lost and you dont like , just move on but attacking the guy personal life is so low
I don’t care that you lost and finally I won’t go Insane watching your old videos on repeat. Thank goodness your back
Telling your fans to harrass him is a shit move man. Respect-- JJ 😕
Wow! How did this video even make it past the final stages of editing? Why would you ask your fans to harass/berate another person when he has not done anything to harm you personally.  Mo - You are a YES man for not letting JJ know that this was not a good look (mainly the berate Tommy Fury part)
Made this way more personal then it needs to be, so unprofessional and honestly disappointing from you especially since all your fans including me would not have changed even though you lost, please just accept the L and move on instead of being a sore loser
Among everything else wrong with this video, keep this in mind. When Deji lost his boxing match and was coping hard, KSI told him to take the L with grace. This was a truly horrendous year for JJ, many many Ls on his part due to his own incompetence. Im so happy more of his fanbase is turning on him, cause he is now a real villain. The "king of drama" literally cried due to losing a boxing match after unfairly winning the one before
This is actually pathetic, you’re buzzin if you think that will be tommys biggest fight. I don’t even like Tommy but I have to say that man is floating around in your head, let it go… you lost.
JJ no matter how much you hate losing, you don't ask your gigantic fanbase to harass someone online just because you lost.
Where’s that salt bae emoji
Honesty... From a fan. You deserved the loss.  You didn't swing. You held him longer than your dad held you .  Your "shots" although powerful ... no no accuracy
Dunno why everybody’s so mad, this is obviously just marketing for the new flavour of prime: KSI Salt Extract
Suck it up. Proof. Hard work doesn’t always pay off. Reality. Fxck all the bullshxt
How many times is jj gonna mess up before you goofy fan boys see him for the l0ser he is
Well this was embarrassing 💀💀
I see why ksi is scared to fight Jake now.
delusional
What an idiot...
Salty loser
Take your loss as a lesson. Dont be a sore loser man. Gotta lose some of that ego brother.
You definitely didn’t win cry more nerd
Nah this is actually trash, take the L  Another thing is the sidemen video’s without you have actually been better Your pettiness and maybe the money has overcome you…
Ksi criticizing anyone for hitting in the back of the head is purely ironic
3 of the 6 rounds you out landed him lol
Allow it jj man you lost you don’t have to make a salty video attacking the judges and Tommy telling fans to hate in Tommy’s comments section your a sore loser bum
He keeps saying "its embarrassing" KSI was embarrassing.. Acted like a sore looser.
ville jj
How about you stop being a sore loser, even if you got "robbed" and just fight Tommy again? Or accept defeat and move on. Life is not all W's, sometimes we take L's and the most important thing is to learn and grow from it. Which you have certainly not, after seeing this video. Rest up brother and reflect again.
Honestly I thought the only fight that was disrespectful to boxing was the ksi tommy fight, its like jj turned up to training everyday and asked his trainer to only pick 1 pad up and practice superman punches, I honestly expected some slick boxing skills from jj but it was apauling, alot of misplaced effort as I do belive  he put alot of effort into this fight just not alot of effort into learning how to actually box, vidals reaction after the fight said it all, please scrap the mma trainers and get a boxing coach if your ever going to get in the ring again to box
I got too much respect for you to not say this. You’ve gotta grow up. You threw a tantrum after losing. You’re so salty that you brought up Tommy’s family, and you told your fans to harass him. Not everything is going to go your way. You’ve come way too far to be acting a damn fool like this.
Bro you’ve been regularly uploading elsewhere, the whole “break” shit is a load of bullshit
Bruh..
I also lost nnn it’s alright KSI! I’ve been there done that
The judges are on crack ksi won he dealt more damage it's stupid
Ksi the goat
"You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.'
Basically a video to show how salty he is lol. I get that he worked hard but cmon you don’t need to go that far in his private life. It’s done.
cmon jj wtf. Even Logan took the loss better than this. It doesnt matter if you got robbed or not but you gotta take a loss like a man. I lost enough to know what it means and I just accepted it. I got beat up enough and I have accepted it.
You need help KSI. You have tried your best, but have reached to limit of your abilities. Watch this video back objectively when you've calmed down.
Why is bro crying and complaining about all of his own choices? He can choose to do literally anything, so him training and physically working is his choice to, no one is forcing him. Dude can react to a random video and everyone would still watch, shut up 🙄 I love you and hope to see more vids 😂❤
I dont think any of us really care about the "loss" we're here for you and that loss doesnt mean anything
fight jake pual shut him up!!!
Dude youre 30. Start acting like it
take the L mate
what a petty little man ksi has turned out to be. a bad winner and a terrible loser
KSI, you wanna talk about Tommy being embarrassing, but your behavior post fight was way more embarrassing than anything Tommy has ever done. Also, way to go encouraging your viewers to harass Tommy. Absolutely pathetic.
I could not believe that Tommy got aeay with this fight...he payed the referees...😂
The first half of the video I thought, “maybe JJ did get humbled enough that he could take his one big L and bounce back stronger than ever.” And then the second half immediately made me rethink that. Just a reminder that this is the same guy that trolled Logan Paul for having his appeal rejected when they had their second fight and he took it in stride. JJ, you’re unlikely to see this, but as a fan of your work, of your content, and your hustle and mentality to want to be better than the levels you’re at now, you MUST understand that you’re going about this the wrong way. You lost to Tommy Fury. It was your first loss in boxing in general and it was a big fight. Alright. You’re in your feelings at the time and you need time to collect your thoughts and figure out how to go about it and address your fans about it. Telling your fans to harass Tommy Fury, online or even in public of all things, isn’t the right way to do it. Even going after his family was pretty low even for you. You just shown your own fans and the world you can’t take losses well at all. You’ll smile and laugh a lot and say you don’t care, but deep down, you’re hurting.
Tommy is probs watching this laughing at you, this video is honestly embarrassing at this point Jake is more of a man than you are, he took his L great and your crying about it and your older and less mature 😭😭
Holy shit, this is painful to watch…
Yes you lost. Is what it is 😂😂 accept it because it’s what happened. Logan thought he won the fight against you and you laughed at him. It’s the same scenario. Also showing true Geordie (who hates the fury’s) showing Eubanks who’s ksi’s boyfriend, showing Ariel Helwani who can bring in views from ksi’s name. Show John fury’s response or Tyson’s response? You won’t. Why? Because they will defend Tommy just like these defended you. But the main reason he won was because you done a warm up pretending to be fighting. You done star jumps all fight. Whilst he actually boxed. It was a boxing fight not let’s see who can do the most star jumps. Stupid technique and that’s what lost you.
Such a bad fight I’ve seen better scraps in alleyways
Took the loss worse than Jake Paul.
I’m sorry this was very spiritual for me. this behaviour JJ is choosing to display is very demonic. this is how you are operating over a lose like seriously? with all the accolades, fame, wealth you have acquired over the years. let’s note you have a loving family & people around you that genuinely care. This was very telling of KSI. be careful who you choose to support, these celebrities/influencers nowadays are not even good remodels. trying to fill a void and chasing the next best thing has now become an addiction. you should be seeking God you’ll find more peace and fulfilment.
I expect this reaction from someone like Jake Paul, not you.
this clown is so sad look how desperate he is no you lost.
im so happy helst now after seeing this video WTF. this is 13 year old behavior...
its alright being a sore loser... atleast hes open to how he actually feel... if you think you could have won but you thought youve been rigged... i think you will feel the same... hes probably be ok losing if he knows his opponent deserves it... oh well... let him rant... hes not perfect... maybe being a sore loser is how he really is
bro you lost your 0 deal with it. So salty
The ego on this guy bigger than my forehead
You ran the entire fight none stop on the back foot. Also you kept tucking your head into his neck and turning it to the side so he would hit the back of your head. P.S you literally elbowed your last guy on purpose knocked him out then pretended like you didn't see what about that......smell your fingers but you know what that is your own a##
Holy crap JJ has stooped extremly low. His whole take on this ironically goes against knowledge, integrity and strength.
"The old ksi will never be topped"
Ksi knows why he’s saying what he’s saying … rematch … more money … that’s it
LSI, cope with your forehead hold the L
tbh i dont care if he won lost or got knocket out i never want to not see him in youtube believe me i had no entertainment without this legend.
why r u getting so personal bruh just take the L
That was a dead fight it could have gone either way so stop being a sore loser and move on
Shows all the comments of people saying KSI was robbed but doesn’t seem to want to show the absolute abundance of comments saying that he hugged Tommy the whole fight… rare KSI L.
How has bro not made a clothing brand about how you can go anywhere in life ?
Sore loser. As a 30 year old, your mentality is very childish. Telling your fans to 'berate' Tommy in public and commenting on how he is as a father is proof of that. The second half of this video just made you look really bad. Just take the L, and move on, just like Jake did. Losing is not the end of the world.
this is so cringe what an absolutely embarrassing shambolic man
Big fan of you JJ and I look up to you but this is just not it man. I think though that people are quick to criticise but we all should know that we all say things and act like this sometimes so in my opinion you did wrong but I understand it’s a human mistake. I hope JJ apologises and takes the L with chest and like a real man. He’s a good dude but he acted on his emotions.
Sorry but can't really enjoy your video while a genocide is going on. #freepalestine🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Take the L
Results at the bottom, sorry if this is incorrect spelling or me using the wrong words, I'm staying up nearly 12:00am to type it out because I can see how much it might mean to him or his fans. I can understand when people work hard and don't get the results they want, but I know JJ has a lot more things to worry about then boxing, but me personally I just get up from my losses and train harder. Round 1:  Close fight but either KSI or fury could of got the round. I reckon KSI because he forced fury to the ropes more but judges could always give it to the other person because I don't know how pro boxing judges could allocate rounds ( meaning how they judge who won the round based off of certain categories; Technique, footwork, ring-craft, defence, punches landed and how the boxer controlled the fight overall).  Round 2:  I believe that KSI won the round because he landed more punches and controlled the fight more often. Tommy wasn't doing much, but punching while grappling ( same as KSI), but he wasn't able to land too many punches as KSI was coming in and out of Tommy's range (whether in the clinch or jumping in with jabs and a right-cross).  Round 3: It was a close round but I could see how judges could of given it to Tommy. Because of the fact that Tommy landed more punches then KSI (in the clinch and KSI trying to get out of the clinch or even just jabs to the face), they might not be much, but both boxers were just grabbing constantly and to be fair for the judges that's hard to score, a whole 3 minute round with very little to work with. That's why I gave KSI the first two because he threw and landed more straight punches then Tommy (being more appealing to the judges when deciding who won the round). Although Tommy did not land much on KSI, he did land more clean punches. I'm not saying KSI did not throw punches ( not having a high work rate), but the punches I saw grazed and rolled of Tommy's shoulder when watching it from the naked eye and in slow-motion.  Round 4:  I believe it was Tommy's again, simply for the fact that KSI wasn't landing clean enough punches. From the Point of view of watching  the fight on YouTube DAZN Boxing channel, both boxers were throwing punches, but I saw KSI land the less effective punches, because his body and head was given more feedback from Tommy's punches (head snapping back, body jerking from the body shots etc.), where as Tommy seems less affected by KSI's blows to the body and head in the clinch. EXPLAINED MORE IN ROUND 5  Round 5:  I'd have to give it to Tommy again, Tommy started timing KSI on the way out of the clinch, landing punches that would snap his head back. The body language a Boxer conveys is important for the judges decision, 2 people who trade straight rights - with the same power, the boxer who had his head snap back because of external factors, chin not tucked it, off-balance, what ever. Sways the judges decision for the boxer whose head didn't snap back. He would look more in control, plus landing the "cleaner" and more "powerful" punch. Making it seem like it was done on purpose as a "calculated shot" ( counterpunch, or "take one to give one").  Round 6:  I reckon it could of gone both ways ( which is how I could see how one of the judges could of scored it as a draw). I believe Tommy edged it out because KSI wasn't doing enough in the fight to convince the judges he had control of Tommy. Yes, he might of bounced around the ring and had his hands down, but judges ignore those sort of things. If either boxer is landing good, clean punches and is using their defence to counter or avoid punches getting thrown back at them then it doesn't matter. But the reason why I believe KSI didn't land enough punches to edge him the round was because, the first 75%  of the round he would back up constantly ( whether doing it straight out of a clinch or after an "out-of-range jab), and jump back in - leaning forward and falling forward, resulting in him ramming into Tommy with his head down and his arms rapped around his back to avoid getting hit when he's off balance, due to his poor choice of footwork. That or he would constantly wrap his left-arm around Tommy's back ( on his right side), and proceed to exchange nonsensical punches that are difficult for judges to see, making it difficult for judges to score. KSI's overhand was REALLY NICE, ( which is why I think it could of gone both ways), but he didn't follow up on that. If he had done a little more he would of won that round convincingly.  Conclusion: Whereas Here's how I scored it (btw the winner is declared the one with the most points and you get 10 points for winning a round and the other person 9 for losing it, in KSI's case he would of gotten a 10-8 round because Tommy lost a point for punching him in the head and because I thought KSI won the round).  Note: sometimes judges can give 10-8 round by themself if they've truly dominated a round (uncommon) or knock them down ( not uncommon).

I've been doing Boxing for a while now and this is just my opinion.
C’mon ksi this isn’t you bro, be better.
You lost it is what it is make a come back from it and learn from it will make you a better person at the end bro I've been watching you since the Logan Paul fight you came far just push harder and you will be whoever you want to be
I like JJ alot but this is terrible. This is the video of a sore loser who is telling his fans to berate his opponent in public because they won.  It's interesting he didn't do a Reddit video because the Reddit is full of supporters who agree with the judges that he didn't win.  Hope he can move past this.
The gypsys own YouTube boxing stay mad
Sir you're 30. Need I say more?
Jj your so childish man seriously just told your fans to comment under tommys post that he lost your an absolute muppet
Jake Paul was right......ksi your regressing in maturity, I can't stand to watch jj anymore his ego is so fragile it's pathetic he behaves like my 1 yr old child when he wants food and throws a tantrum, hes become one of those egomaniac cringe Hollywood actors who thinks the world revolvs around them.
Take the L like a champ mate. Attacking Tommy isn't going to prove your fans that ur loss was a win. For everyone sake mate, be the man people once look up to.
Tommy is actually shit at fighting 💀
Everyone is trying to hate on you man all your real fans are still here for you don’t listen to these fake ass “fans” he’s not crying or weaponizing his fans he’s just telling his side what’s wrong with that? Not aloud to have opinion’s anymore
sore loser.
Np. You're back. Sheeeesh I love you
JJ you are the winner in our eyes❤
Dude… he’s still being sore about it?!? I assume this was filmed before his appeal got officially rejected. But geez, not showing proof of jake Paul saying he won, getting his fans to try and raid Tommy’s comment section and to yell at him in public that he lost. This dude is a massive manipulator. glad he lost. He needed this
So cringe, you were punching him on the back of the head as well, you landed less punches and hugged constantly, you are a terrible boxer as is Tommy Fury
womp womp
There's only one direction to go once you hit the top and that's backdl diwn again awww poor racist can't take the L
Yea but, Tommy Fury is the goat tho
Telling a fanbase to "attack" well just send up comments on Tommy's social medias but when it comes to a public sphere is very bad. JJ you're no warrior if you CAN'T accept DEFEAT. If you feel like you lost, RESPECTFULLY VOICE YOUR OPINION. And If the appeal doesn't get accepted you have every right to feel angry but shape your words correctly. Which is very possible.
I feel like u should just move yes u did lose but in your mind u know u won focus on your future and not the past
We know you won but damn the yap is crazyyy
It’s not fair, it’s okay pookie do you want some prime??
im a fans of u mate, but this........ you are people champ, what more do you need?
You know the guy who went against Logan Paul was the real winner, cuz honesty that’s when I got entertained so that guy is the real winner
How does someone gather their thoughts for weeks and still come with this utterly childish statement
You sat and picked on Tommy’s kid while you and your brother bent each other over it’s mad😂😂😂😂😂
This isn’t new behavior from KSI. Whatever Fans he has left (down 75% in viewership in the past year) need to wake up.   He did this to Wade, he did this to Wassabi, he did this to Logan, and he really did this to Weller. I’m sure theres more people im missing, but this guy has constantly used his fans to shift narratives and attack people online. It’s borderline evil man.
i think it’s clear that JJ has some unresolved trauma, when it comes to being the ‘loser’ or losing in general that in order to mature needs to be resolved real quick.
Are you sure about this JJ?
He had to grab all celebrities clips your so shite man lost respect.
imagine how respected he would be if he had just included the first half of this video, and it ended there, yeah sure he’d have those thoughts in private but it’s not like we’d ever know. but no, it’s like he couldn’t resist.
I would never believe that i would unfollow and unsubscribe to ksi!! If someone told me that i would ever do that i'd say that he is mental and unstable, but here we are........ I have been watching KSI since 2015, i cant explain how happy i was when he became a boxer and gained even more popularity. I was watching him grow and was very very proud of him succeeding in life, but what he said and did is beyond disgraceful . His yes-man close circle and success have turned him into an egoistic narcissist who believes that can say anything to anyone and that the sky is the limit. Wake up JJ! Where is your humility? Where is your gratitude?? Where Is the kid that used to play fifa in his room screaming when he would pack a decent player ??? Look what you have turned into brother , you insult people, you embrace hate, you dont know how to lose, you are so full of yourself that it cant be compared to anything else!!!! Im hurt so much and i talk to you like i would have talked to my own brother. Those are not words of hate in any way, those are the words of true disappointment.......
JJ, the comments you made about Tommy were unnecessary.
Yeah, your late bro 💀
Everyone should stop I know jj is acting like a bit of a sore loser but he deserves that win everyone knows so he’s trying to get what he deserves there is nothing wrong with that
i loved jj but that shit hugfest of a fight was no fight at all. jj is just delusional at this point and is surrounded by yes men that keep feeding him his ego and delusion
You’d think KSI is younger than Tommy, but no. JJ is a 30 year old man instructing his audience to harass a 24 year old. Clown.
am i the only one that chuckled at the konichiwa part
2023 has being a hell of a year. I went from hating Jake to loving Jake. Can't say the same for JJ.
Jesus this guy still believes he won the fight after hugging the whole time, what an absolute ego maniac fkn hell
KSI weaponizing his fanbase is just insane, childish, and immature. Not to mention him questioning and insulting Tommy Fury as a father. Cant believe the man is 30, because he acts like a 12 year old. What an embarassment.
That was not Tommy win ,just wanted to see Ksi stand and fight in different style he would win that
Making a video is you re-opening that wound. 🤡🤡
Slp
Sore loser.
Bro stop being such a sore loser.
ksi can never be logan
The result was fair, no one really landed clean at all, and if no one is landing clean, you judge off of who’s the aggressor, you weren’t making the fight at all, Tommy Fury was pushing the action and you were initiating the clinches most of the time, on top of that you were hitting behind the back of the head just as much if not more than he was, to call it a robbery is ludicrous, that’s term is reserved for when someone clearly won, I wouldn’t’ve complained if you got the decision, but felt that Tommy Fury edged it. How you’re acting towards Tommy Fury is just pathetic and petty, still trashing him after you lost, downing him by saying he’s been training all his life and how ‘you’re just a YouTuber’, saying it’s better to be in your position than his, and getting personal by telling him how to father his child? What’s the need? You’re coming across as very bitter and arrogant.
The wait was worth it bro, glad to see you looking after the most important people in your life.
This is so petty and childish man, just move on with your life and own the loss. Would look a million times better than whatever this was.
kinda unnecessary jj
I still feel like KSI won and it was stolen. I don't care what anyone says. the whole arena was saying ksi won. Bro even  tyson was surprised. It was robbed 100%. But I don't like how ksi has given up. I want a rematch and just don't even want the shit talk. just pure proving the point. Even goku takes a beating and gets up 2x strong.
just take the L
For me it lookes like draw. Either way Im grateful to JJ for all the jorney he came through and for inspiring me to start combat sports.
Bro is still in denial month later
"Better than I was before, I feel much better now" He said but judging by watching this video fully.. He's not.
Shitting 9n what t9mmy doing rn and his problem with Molly atm was not right
Ffs, 9 minutes and 13 seconds of just pure excuses
He is such a sore loser
Loser
KSI’s downfall is coming from the fact that his fans are maturing, but he is not.
I can't stand the Fury's. Tyson and his hypeman Tommy but this video is lame. You lost. Grow up and take the L. I wanted nothing more than for KSI to win but this is painful to watch
such a crybaby
You need to get rid of these yes men around you im sorry sidemen are literal sidemen. You out "friends" before family its.so hard.for me personally because ive been round the same thing before. I really care about you man these people your surrounding yourself with aren't it. I put my life on that.
You lost and appealed still lost. Unfortunately the better man beat you. Don't need to be going to Molly and his kid etc
been a fan for a few years and tbh, there have been many hints of the ego, money and success getting to him but not at this level.... things he has said in this video are outrageous.... I expected him to take the L well, but turns out he is just an immature bitch. GROW TF UP AND MAN UP TO THE SITUATION INSTEAD OF CRYING AT HOME
FIGHT JAKE PAUL
Whatever u say...U cant defeat the"Its time to shock the world"curse...
you lose man.. it is what it is
All that shi talking about Jake losing to making a video like this. Sad
I was in shock when they said u lost this. It all seems so fixed these days. Especially this one. If there is a close match going on, now we all know that Fury is going to win. Much respect man🔥
what an L vid man.
Womp womp
None of you are actual fans y’all know he’s right y’all just like meat riding winners shut up you all sit behind your phones and act like you can judge when most of you are terrible people
you lost...
The loss was good for you. You needed to be humbled.
listen jj. i thought you won too. let’s be honest, you probably did win. i agree with almost everything you said in this video but 1 thing is not okay. you can‘t openly ask your fans to harass tommy. ik how you meant it but you can’t say that. i have been with you for 10 years and that won’t change for anything but you have to understand that everything that happens to you in life was meant to happen. god makes everything happen the way it has to happen. this loss was supposed to happen to teach you something. don’t be ignorant to it, learn the lesson and move on. ik it’s fuck tommy but that has nothing to do with you anymore. things happen, life ain’t fair. keep moving forward champ
Maybe it’s best KSI doesn’t face Jake. Because if he were to lose to Jake, my mans might have the mental breakdown of a lifetime.
LSI
No one cares anymore
nah this guy has to learn how to lose  its normal you cant always win + he needed this lose bcz his ego was growing too big                        just take the defeat, learn from your misstakes and just move on and be better next time
Hey KSI you din't lose the fight i thought you won or a least a draw but the way your taking this loss  is making you look like a loser. going after someone's family is low  just saying.  i would say  take this loss like a man like the beast KSI  we all know  you got nothing to prove. you are still a winner. be like the great boxer Muhammad Ali he lost but was still the  greatest. don't be the man who destroys himself your thinking with anger and on your mind.
You're actually terrified to fight jake man it's so pathetic. you're killing the hype for the biggest fight on the internet just because you don't want  to lose to Jake. we all know he's levels above you, and you're stalling to get as much practice as you can so you can work on a game plan to try beathim. you'd rather wait 3-4 years from now to prep for jake and that's how scared you are
honestly it donesnt even matter who won the fight because it was such a shit fight.
Jake paul next
Wow looks like this grown ass man need more humbling
Still threw the elbow tho😂
if only you had had your hands up
Sore loser.
KSI Lost; cope with it. this is like trump losing to biden all over again. his fanbase will not accept he lost lol. i love the tears from these sidemen kids.
Cant  win them all 😁
Look i don't get the hate Tommy fury is getting, he seems like a nice guy, yes his boxing is not really good and he needs to work on that. But what really bothered me is the fact that you encouraged your fans to harass Tommy fury online and in public all because you couldn't take the loss. You're disgusting and and you should be ashamed of yourself.
Are the judges racist
KSI sounds like a woman gossiping about Tommies relationship and his private life. It's just weird
Ksi is laughing but it’s so obvious inside he’s actually dying, forced laugh to mask his real feelings
Tommy won end off stop f*cking saying u won. Jumping up and down like a whoopa Loopa
Yeh not a fan of this guy, hold that L
Choose humility, kids.
LSI
we all know u won jj either way we are proud of how far you’ve come
This video is a bigger L than the loss... As a wise man once said, being a sore loser is even worse than being a loser
This video is definitely getting deleted 😂😂😂
Seems like you haven't even got over it ffs 😂🤡🤦🏻😂🥱🥱🎻🎻
Box properly then 😂 stop jumping around like a fool trying to one bomb him
Jj you are making it really hard to support you with a video like this, you must know this isn't okay asking people to berate another man for winning a fight. Don't be a bitch, apologise, don't do it again, get back on the grind
What happens when you're a racist , you got slapped and took an even bigger L than the L itself 🤪
Used to enjoy his content before. He was much more humble and interesting before. Now he's just egotistical and is genuinely spiralling down a dark path. This guy doesn't deserve to win, because winners reflect on their failures and work harder next time round. Don't entertain this guy by being a fan. Soulless - the money went straight to his head.   This is a lesson to everyone of you reading this comment. Never sell your soul; be a genuinely positive force for this world. Don't be a clown for clout, and always uplift others, no matter what they do to you.
I love you mate but you don’t go after a man’s personal life because you have problems with him in a ring.
Except the L and move on if you thought you won then take a rematch
LSI
Claims he's in a better place but promotes people to approach and further harass Tommy. You're no longer known for losing against tommy, you're more known for not being able to grow up and take a loss.
Respect for your hard work
This shit staged it’s all a setup for Jake vs KSI
you lost. so what ? better fighters than you lost too it happens in combat sports grow up and man tf up you can't always be the manchild in the sidemen
W
Bro really behaves like a sore loser smh
“If you don’t fail, it means that you’re not even trying” happy return JJ 🤗
Nah this is wrong man understand your influence big fan base your telling them to go harass the man. Sore loser bruv it’s been how long sit down and review the fight from an unbiased veiw point. If you’re arguing the back of the head shots then mention yours too🤷🏽 all credit to ksi he did very well but don’t be a sore loser man go trash talk when you’re going for ksi Tommy 2? I don’t respect this tho take the l like a man and avenge it
this is very embarrassing
Money def can’t buy maturity and class that’s for sure
Common KSI L. Delete this, bro
Draw at least  W for Tommy at max You lost, get over it
why do people care so much about what he says, hes just saying how he's feeling and ofc he's gonna feel like its the robbery of the year because for him it is, sure hes whining but people are over overreacting so much
Loser
Tommy is pure dog shite tbh🤣shocking that he couldn’t knock either ksi or Jake paul down..madness🤣
You wish the world agreed with you but in reality you’re the only one bro 😂. Tommy won and everyone knows buddy
What is KSI on trying to pull up vids of Tommy before the fight? 😂😂😂 has he seen his? he made himself into the biggest meme and he clinched the entire fight what is KSI on I’m glad yall aren’t tip riding him through this like yall always do
Nobody cares that you lost, it’s how you handled that loss.
Imagine a world where KSI complains about hits to the back of the head 😂😂😂😂
Stop right there Mr. Olatunji, You have chosen the wrong path of being a sore loser. Think again Mr. Olatunji!
As someone who has watched you from the very beginning, this just comes across as salty.  You lost. I watched the fight live, I watch combat sports every week, you definitely lost. Move on, grow. Stop acting like a child at your big age JJ.  You have such a following you are meant to show what it's like to bounce back from a loss and go on to do better, but instead you come on YouTube to whine and cry. Just a shame, honestly.
Eish the day finally came😣
L vid ngl…
hate from czechia <3
Weaponizing your fans you should get sniper wolf treatment then attacking tommy family even though he hasn't said nothing to you shoes how badly you were raised your ego is bad
what a shame
Acting like a child ngl
Sad video… pretty low he attacks someone who won regardless of what he thinks Dogshit return video
This is bad...
Nice to see Kavos trying to make themselves relevant again, by dragging up old KSI beef
Jesus this is messed up you’ve hit a new low, you’re mad at a result so you attack the opponent family and then tell your fans harass him online and in real life. I always wondered why you could work with Logan a man that lacks empathy completely but after this response I can now see your ego and greed has pulled you to the same low level. You gotta hope YouTube don’t punish your channels for breaking TOS
Just accept you lost. You wanted to win but you didn't. It's okay. This proves that you can have all the money and fame in the world but doesn't bring you peace of mind.
My friend your ego is out of control, take the L. Stop being a b*tch about it and sending your teenage fans to attack Tommy. It’s just sad mate. You lost that’s it. Move on.
lol nice
Logan and KSI will be the death of Prime with how unlikeable and egotistical they are becoming in the publics eye
Didn't even come close to winning that one lmfao.
He wasn't always like this, or i just grew up?
Take it like a man. Jake did...
Se struggled to jab you cause you kept initiating the clinch not allowing him to
But you can’t complain bout getting hit behind the head when you rewatch the fight you also were hitting him behind the head a bunch
Okay, so i can understand why hes bummed. I mean, the fight was close af, a draw imo. Everyone around Tommy is probably reminding him. And its justified why he needed a break... But mate, telling your fans to harass Tommy to in public is too much init? I thinks its weird that people do it online, but thats the thing: its online. People are gonna do it regardless if you tell them dont. Not the right move mate.   I would say, coming at him and calling him a bad father and all is not it, but he did just fight him in a ring and had a controversial lost. 😅 i wouldnt do it but people aren't me 😂
L video lmaoooo, u lost bro and most people that said you won is cuz they hate furys or cuz prime sponsors them aha
Get over it fam I forgot you guys even fought
Dude’s actions contribute to being a sore loser. Like we’re not calling you a loser, the problem is you’re exhibiting traits of a sore loser. I truly respect and love you brother, been following you since a child. Seeing you act this way is ridiculous. It’s kinda painfully embarrassing.
You legit just told your fans to go harass Tommy in public because you can't accept the fact that you lost. I Hope you read all the comments under this video you are slowly becoming unlikable smh.
The biggest L you had in your career or legacy or whatever u wanna call it is this video 👍🏻 accept the loss and move on jj telling ur supporters to insult someone is not u and this video is an absolute L and I'd like to remember u Simon's words "when is it going to be ksus and not ksi " been subbed for 5 years or more and this is absolutely fucking disgraceful
This really ain't a good look. To bring up a man's kid is crazy.
Ksi won, 3 grown men (judges) say you lost doesn’t mean you lost lol
this whole video is a massive L
love u ksi
You’re a disgrace. Going after someone’s family just because they got the decision? All the respect you earned for hanging in there with Tommy, is being diminished by your own attitude. Grow up
Did a 3 year old title this video? Edit: Way too much credit sorry JJ, 1 year old?
bro cried for 9 minutes who asked for a video like this?
trurly disgusting behaviour here. This should be pulled down asap to stop any further harassment of tommie's family.
Love you JJ❤️stay strong Take care and comeback soon
Grow up Ksi, grow up
*yikes*
Congrats JJ  The meaning of knowledge strength and iNtEgRiTy died along with your entire last years performance.  An entire year of L's.  Rest easy, 🤡
#32 on trending for being a baby back loser
Not how you should react to a loss
Manchild bahahahaha
You're Tommys son now
Despite the "you maybe should have been the winner" stuff because the word maybe doesn't matter here in reality, nobody who wasn't already gonna ditch you if you lost to Tommy, were all exactly where we were before you made this video, by your side and your fans. The decision possibly being wrong DOES not and SHOULD not have any sway on reality. Win or Lose, we were here. For you to take all of that time, which means this was very calculated, you thought out any possible repercussions, and yet you still decided to bring up the decision constantly, bring his family and child into it [despite your entire career being RIDDLED with family drama that you beg people to let go], and you end up completely shattering your own hard fought REPUTATION, not a boxing career.  Congrats JJ, you are officially a fool.
You lost end credits
This ain’t right man
JJ, you need to understand that you have a massive influence on people, especially on your younger viewers. You're weaponisng children to hate on someone. I dont really like Tommy Fury, but after seeing this, I stand with him because Tommy, Molly, and even their young child doesn’t deserve hate. Shame on you for getting your fans to oppress against another human being. Fix yourself because this knowledge and integrity you say, there's no integrity, and not really any knowledge.
Welcome back brotha!
Can't wait for the 30 min Patrick cc video
Might as well wear a diaper with the amount of crying you've been doing.
A whole year of JJ taking L's. Knowledge, strength and integrity goes straight out the window when things don't go his way. His "Legacy" will be JJ the "Manchild" if he doesn't get his ego under control. Used to be a fan but money, ego and fame have made him so unlikable
Jake Paul was referring to u when he said doesn’t win without deductions. He’s referencing Logan fight
I love jj but this wasnt it, take the loss like a G not sore loser😵‍💫
So embarrassing just take the loss
What is the dislike count?
:)
You could be watching Dawson's Creek rn 🤷
You took the L like a bit**
No sh×t sherlock😂
You cant win em all. I feel bad for you for getting clowned but thats the risk of being cocky. Ive liked your videos for a long time but i genuinely dont get why you're coping by trying to tear down tommy after the fight is ovet. Its cringe.
Nahh cmon jj this is kinda cheap fam. I respected his high morale and integrity, now he’s just complaining and asking people to bully Him… nah Man U are better than that
humbled him😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
LOOOOSSSERRR L goof
This is what happens in competition. Sometimes you win sometimes you lose, it’s not like you lost a world tittle fight. It’s part of the sport, literally everyone loses except 1% of the elite and that’s only in boxing. Muay thai, MMA, bjj, wrestling, Judo. EVERYONE loses, even the goats. Just take it on chin and move on
This is not good,grow up dude
I’m a fan of yours but at this point you needed humbling. This video is embarrassing bro
theses comments make me sad but most of it is true…
If you’re mad about a decision it’s your fault, you left it to the judges.
Funny how life works, you laughed at Logan for appealing to commission and they denying it, now the same thing happened to you
Nah lads stfu. He can think what he thinks and frankly he deserves the win or atleast a draw. Yeah he coulda said Congratz but fuckin stfu lmao
u lost
I like the fact that his fans are finally realising this guys a dick, but just to clarify, he's always been a dick. When he's ordering his fans to fuel online hate towards someone, when he's coming out with racial slurs and offensive stuff on a basis way too regular for someone his age and has a genuine god complex, is the man you are seeing now that far of a reach from the "nerdy Fifa player" who was making jokes about rape and sexual harassment in his early days? "Where he's come from" wasn't a good place to start with and he hasn't made nearly as much distance as he should have or as much as he brags
Damn man I used to be such a Ksi fan but JJ you’re actually such a little man child. Grow TF UP !! If you had any sense you would take this vid down to protect Tommys baby daughter and rest his family against your now millions of young fans who will be going after them not just on the internet but IN REAL LIFE under your command. I would also start working on a massive apology to Tommy and his family before you loose any more fans. Disgraceful TBH
I agree with a lot in the video but damn don't just yk go for personal attacks against Fury (family stuff) and weaponize your fans against him just because you "lost". You said it yourself, many many people agree on you drawing or winning against him. You better make another video soon on this channel and in its INTRO telling your fans to stop the attacks. Plus there's the appeal still going on so even from that perspective it's not a good idea. And as a general piece of advice, take a good look at yourself. Now you don't seem like you're 100%, judging by your actions.
Stop being a sore loser those judges didn’t take anything from you. You got beaten by the Better man on the night grow up stop being a little kid making excuses if a bunch of judges viewed it and decided you still lost them you lost
This is literally a “oh hey guys, look at all the things I’ve achieved and done throughout the years! Please do because I need validation from y’all! And fuck the loss! I still won that shit!” video. Come on, KSI. Stop being a manchild.
My guy I don’t give a fuck if you “lost” I understand/am proud that you put in all the time and hard work I’ve been in the same situation but I can’t lie I’m a bit disappointed in you I feel like you needed this to show you that sometimes life ain’t fair, you could have been a lot more mature and took your own advice in the video when Logan’s appeal got denied but still talking shit to Tommy after you lost is childish asf. You’re not invincible and sometimes we just need to accept the L. Regardless keep doing you JJ I wish you luck in whatever you do in the future.
Mf tattooed angry, disappointed and Brokedown on himself this video
Yikes, this is so ironic and cringe its almost comical
I think you won the fight but I didn’t enjoy it and I think you clinched too much and imo it was really boring.
If you lost you lost. Whining about it just makes the I in KSI look useless. You lost jj, accept it. In the end it was all talk, perhaps if he had concentrated more on his boxing techniques or boxing in general he would've gotten the win. Shame. How the mighty have fallen. Just take the L jj.
It’s not about the times u get knocked down, bro it’s about the times u get back up so stay up KING 👑
You lost, get over it. Jake Paul took the L a lot better than you. You’re obviously not “feeling better” about it
So your message was a loser nerd a few years ago with sheer will and hard work can go toe to toe with a professional boxer but have you ever realized that they also do hard work and not born as a professional boxer from their mother?
Kinda ironic that jj became the ricegum of boxing who whould have thought   Maybe take the L if you could even pronounce it
What a loser 😭 take the L ego through the roof
Wasn’t even a fight.
Ksi you're a decent lad, but encouraging people to harass tommy is total abuse of your influence as an Internet celebrity and its quite unacceptable mate. It would be much more respectable of you to take the loss as a fighter and move on to further ventures. Like it or not tommy won, it was close but he got the decision and that's that
Really learning a lesson from this video people are not like you see them they show you how they want you to see themselves. L Ksi
Brada… JJ wtf? Your hugging match wasn’t anything to brag about, thats just facts. I am so sad that I wasn’t able to see your training come into fruition 🤷🏼‍♂️ But telling your followers to haras Tommy for winning because you’re butthurt bro, thats too much… I honestly hoped you had accepted the loss, Said fk it, lived life and enjoyed your blessed life with your family, gf, friends and what not but it honestly doesn’t Seem as if you’ve been enjoying anything? I hope you have people in your life that Can support and help you to get over this negativity
Ksi W
You lost deal with it
Bro is the definition of “can’t take the L”. Move on loser.
I’m so glad JJ’s fans aren’t willing to sugar coat things. Reading the comments and seeing how no one wants to stand with him in this situation is so heart warming. This weaponization is absolutely vile and honestly JJ if you read this you should take note you lost more than the fight, but you’ve lost the trust of many fans
Guessing it took so long to make this video cause you needed to learn how to play the worlds smallest violin
Yes.
KSI just accept defeat and rematch
damn what’s with all the hate? he didn’t say anything wrong ??
I follow you since 12 years but oh man I hate to see what has become of you. You're a sore loser. Accept the defeat and move on. You're 30 years old for crying out loud, stop whining and just accept the loss - the fans won't love you any less for it.
Tommys nuts still in the mouth I see
I'm a fan of KSI but defo not a fan of this 🙁
I hate that you became a fighter only cause we missed out on YOU
Ur so hurt about the fight hop off tommys meat now its about time😂
Hey atleast your healthy and good and have a chance to play GTA 6 😃
Get rid of the flappy bird style, you have a higher chance winning boxing how you did against logan with the haymakers
Bro take the fucking L and move on. You’re complaining way too much.
It’s because you were born in a Rooster 🐓 1993 and this year is a Cat 🐈 year 2023 oh and Tommy was born in a Cat year 1999 🐈   Astrology baby!
At the end of a day it was a shit fight, clinching whole time, your coach telling you to clinch se he will lose another point by punching you in the back of the head? The fuck, whole tactic around him losing point, hotible fight, not entertaining at al, which I thought this whole thing is about, fun fights, now its turning into cating about record and grinding out close decisions, thats not why people like influencer boxing, this whole thing is going into wrong direction.
Nice vid
Never really thought I’d get bored of KSI videos but I genuinely couldn’t care less anymore, time to unsubscribe.
You won mentally brother
so this is the ‘Legacy’ you’ve built for yourself? congratulations, hope you’re future children are proud
Just take the L like a man. You lost you cant change the outcome. It's kinda sad. You really let him get you physically and mentally. Dont give him another W.
Sending your legion of 11 year olds to harass a father in public because you lost . Real sportsman like
You are a very hard worker man, but dont think of it as a loss. This was handled terribly tho bro.
KSI’s backfires:   -Made fun of Jake Paul losing to Tommy, then lost to Tommy  -Made fun of Logan appealing (which got denied) , proceeded to appeal his fight with Tommy (which also got denied)   -Tried to cover up his Illegal shot against Joe, complained about Tommy hitting him at the back of the head.    Just take the L it’s been months and you’re still crying. God is literally sending you a message to put down your ego especially that everything I mentioned above literally happened all at once. Deal with, it wasn’t a robbery at all, you lost fair & square, Tommy really punched the crying baby out of you.
Damn.. He really spent all these weeks to compose himself to properly deliver a message yet decides to become a deplorable man child. And here I was supporting you.. I’m genuinely just disappointed
Finally
bro allow it and take the L fr
adult baby
No way he just told his fans to harass Tommy just because he beat him
Fight jake paul jj u both lost to tommy so jake paul v ksi
Sending your young fans to harass a man in public is revolting.
L
U need to accept it like a man, instead you're telling ur fans to harass another man
That ego grows bigger day by day🤦🏽‍♂️
Grow up you big 30 year old
How does KSI not realise how bad the idea of telling his viewers to harass someone in public is. Like it's obviously bad morally, but does he have no awareness of what that would do to his image?
What a sore loser. Tommy fury really broke you haha
like if jj's account should get deleted
Bro is delusional imagine paying to watch that shit. Tbh none of them deserve to win. But you wanna win like this ? Look at your performance mate
JJ I think you should take a step back and lower your ego. it'll help you get over the loss better
He had us in the first half
Ya know back in high-school i kinda always liked you and logan, but over the years you two have been corrupted and ruined by greed and you show it A LOT more now, with logan scamming his audience and doing nothing about it and you doing literally sending your audience to spread hate, like ima be real jj i truly hope you and logans careers dont last much longer, anyone who is willing to manipulate fans doesnt deserve a platform here, and quite frankly you and logan have a younger audience and know that and still do this shit regardless, you guys have become scum and i genuinely hope you see that soon Edit: he said in the sideman podcast he doesnt care pretty much straight up, i really truly believe you dont deserve a job in the public eye like youtube or twitch anymore, its against youtubes tos to do this and i hope youtube takes appropriate action against you soon or you do the realization yourself(doubt you will tho)
all these npcs hating on ksi, smd
The real losers were the fans one of the worst fights ever 6 round hugfest neither man should’ve been confident they won that fight
Honestly, this is kinda pathetic JJ.  Win or lose , you should move on. But you're here crying and calling out your fans to harass your opponent on social media? That's kinda disgusting. Good thing you lost.
Enciting violence against another person. Wow. Your ego is bigger than I thought. Grow up
Common L
what a sook
JJ - you probably did deserve to win the fight, but that’s no reason to bring his family into this and tell your fanbase to attack him. You’re happy to disapprove of Dilon Danis bringing in Logan’s fiancé, but then the rules changed for you I guess.
Sore loser take the loss like a man!!
Love your video brother, the way you talk is clear, inspiring, and interesting. Keep vibing👍
Leave the fkin man, his wife and kids alone. You losing to him doesn't mean you can antagonize him and his family, while also encouraging your fans to do so. I don't need this toxic content on my youtube feed anymore, the absolute lowest of the low.
That creepy forced laugh after every insecure insult you throw is so off-putting. Goodbye ksi, sidemen, etc from my YouTube as of now. Don't need this toxic content in my life any more. God bless
The hate on Tommy Fury... You really been watching his every single move after the fight, JJ?
I don’t really think in like 3 or 4 months anyone will care if the decision gets overturned or not people have already moved on
Dude that fight was ass
bro stop the excuses
Boxing has lost respect from up and coming fans of Boxing . KSI won the fight . Blackeye on Boxing for that
Showing clips of people feeding you bullshit you wanna hear. You're not a fighter JJ, never was, hugging almost 80 times during a boxing match doesn't win. You're clearly a lover.
LLLLLLLLLLLL
sad
So butt hurt 😂
Nope that's low . I should of un followed you ages ago  when you started on wade but now Sending your mob to give Tommy shit is well out of order no wonder joe Weller hit rock bottom cause of you . Not a good MAN
It was a hugfest tf did you think people didn’t watch the fight?
shoulda taken the L and moved on, this copium is a little distasteful.
JJ you lost man, your legacy would have been alot better if you were alot more humble in defeat.
People are so fucking snowflakes nowadays. To watch this video and the ONLY THING you’re thinking of after is «omg his TELLING PEOPLE TO HURT TOMMY, please REPOOOORT!!» are actually making me lose my mind. He’s joking with that part, ofcourse he doesn’t want people to harass Tommy. And for people saying «I wanted him to win, but now after seing his reaction after a loss, I’m glad he lost» has no winner mentality what so ever. You’ve never been working your ass of for something, and then lose on a controversial call (not saying ksi was robbed, i’m saying controversial:) ). It’s okay to be sad, frustrated, angry or pissed after a loss. Not all people react the same. The way you react ain’t the only right way, stop thinking you’re the fucking center of attention.   I’m proud of you, JJ.
hanging out with logan too much.
coping
That's crazy. I don't even know what to say. Jesus.
You're a sick puppy, that's for sure.
Yes you did
Now logan will try to right tommy fury
That creepy forced laugh after every insecure insult you throw is so off-putting. Goodbye ksi, sidemen, etc from my YouTube as of now. Don't need this toxic content in my life any more. God bless
Lol
Bro was hugging all the time ...he did not prove properly....good to see you back loserr😂
Just take the L man. It was fully deserved, you immature turtle
the beef died down so all the trash talk kinda seems pointless,  though i do agree tommy embarrassed himself with that fight.
Dudes current mind set is a bigger L than his last fight and the KSI show put together... geezer is a joke now and needs some serious help with his delusions... dude is screamimg 1st world problems
You forgot to apoligize for the most boring fight of all time. Neither of you won. Clinchfest...
At this point just do a rematch then
These comments are so dramatic 😂
You did your best, you gave your 100% and more❤ that’s all it matters and that’s what’s in your control. Thank you for the amazing lessons
i love your content but got to be honest you lost that fight
Wow....what a sore loser
i love your content but got to be honest you lost that fight
This is toxic honestly. Take your L like a champ, from a former fan
The fact is hat you lost to Tommy fury makes you even more of a loser.
Even after months of thought and reflection, he decides to put out this garbabe. KSI is such a sore loser. He cannot admit that he lost and when the roles were reversed, we all saw how he acted (KSI vs Logan). He is a hypocrite. He needs to learn to take a loss and im kinda dissapointed that KSI didnt lose by a big margin so he could not make any excuses. But knowing him, even if he got knocked out he would somehow make an excuse and his meatriding fans would eat it all up.
The thing is you people are right...he shouldnt encourage hate in the community and advise people to berate him publicly but one thing I must say not supporting him or anything...he is the only YouTuber bold enoigh to tell that..please cyber bully him and I dont give a f attitude and not going back on his word. See
still in your prime
Sore loser
What a sorry guy
Jj delete this
This aint it
BRO HONESTLY JUST SHUT UP AND  ACCEPT U LOST. Thats the best thing u can do
This guy is a sore loser, ruined your whole “legacy” as soon as you got it tatted.
Fuck your fight it was atrocity, i dont like the awkward barfighting Style of the furys, whats even more menacing was the fight ngannu vs tyson!  tyson was fighting for his Life but still won on points by the shit Jury!!!!!🤦‍♂️ what was that!? they clearly have some of the judges on a payroll and we all know by now that those are dirty cheaters they been caught numerous times! P.s.  i finally Could get a Prime bottle after years and i have to say it Taste like shit its waaaaaaay to sweet next to other brands of "hydration beverages" i better Drink water again then.🤣
I’m not gonna lie, I would’ve much rathered that JJ kept processing through the event on his own or even waited for the appeal before he made a video. I understand hating losing but at least be graceful about it whether you really and truly believe you won or not, because this is honestly embarrassing to watch
fck all of this bro lost and gotta move on simple as that - anyway GTA trailer is out man that after 10 years of suffering!!!!
Just take the L. No need to be sour and shit on him coz the decision didn't go ur way
I enjoyed JJ coming back… in the first half of the video, the second half made me really disappointed. I thought he had enough time off and was finally at piece with the decision. But apparently not, I don’t know if he needs more time off or something else. But I hope he figures it out.
That silence before konnichiwa is hilarious 🤣🤣
sending hate to the guy you lost to is crazyy
Damn you’re good at boxing JJ but you lost,that humbles a man and makes them beyyer
Sore loser🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Respected you a lot regardless, but even if you lose take the chance to reflect honestly, don’t be going against TOS and having fans attack someone, you better than that, and just bounce back and come back stronger. We respect and love you but this isn’t fam. Look deep within yourself and you def know that this isn’t the real you. And I know I’ve been supporting you for the longest. I don’t respect someone who doesn’t know when to stop, and be humble. Regardless we love you a lot but definitely do not turn like this.
you can tell some people in the comments have never played a competitive sport
People really think ksi won ?? No hate just a genuine question
i thought this wasnt personal? and now a 30 year old man is telling his fans to harass a 24 year old man bc he cant take a loss? this is beyond embarrassing, truly sucks bc i've seen him grow as a person throughout many years and all that was thrown away in this video.
This dude making millions and complaining that life ain’t fair smh lol
you lost bro
It’s completely understandable to be upset about losing but calling on your fans to berate Tommy in public is not okay. It’s crazy that there are KSI glazers that can’t see that. Some saying “oh he was joking” whether he’s joking or not, it’s still not okay. There can always be that one crazy fan that would listen and do it.
Speaking of Legacy, I think that this is quite possibly the most embarrassing video you could’ve made. Talking about his personal life when he’s just trying to have fun and casually making jabs and insinuating that he’s being a shitty dad is not the KSI that I grew up to know and love. And I know many people in the comments can agree to say that because of this ugly side that has come out of you, you definitely deserved to lose and I for one am glad that you did.   It may not mean a lot to you due to your successes but you lost a fan today, and as someone who grew up watching your videos and become this incredible person, I wish you the best in your endeavours. But I hope that you deal with that pride along the way
I’m surprise there’s no hate comments here
No no no why are you sending your fans to harass/berate Tommy 😳. Grow up man!!
No no no why are you sending your fans to harass/berate Tommy 😳. Grow up man!!
Tommy came to fight, JJ came to catch up on the hugs his daddy didn’t give him 😭😭😭
Truly is embarrassing for him to have all this time to think and reflect on the loss to make a response video for his channel all to show he’s in denial. Glad to see most comments are are being real with how much of a sore loser he is
remember this is the same guy who was laughing at Logan for the same exact thing he’s trying to do now😭😭 tommy needs to drop that Laughing at KSI video rq😂😂😂😂
did JJ really think we all forgot all he did was jump around throw 2 right hands a rnd then hug tommy to death 😂😂😂? catching up on the hugs his dad wasn’t giving him lol
Totally out of order to call out tommy's fam and telling your fans to berate him. Shameful
THIS IS THE REAL KSI/JJ. He is just rude, narcissistic, egotistic and completely detached from reality human. That's why Harry's disstrack showed up out of nowhere and the disstrack was highlighting many great qualities of KSI/JJ. Imagine telling your 20M fanbase to harass someone and making comments about how a family should run.  ... and people saying "I've followed your journey, this is not you", it's only the content creator persona we are familiar with, with bad parts edited out, storyboarding the hero journey to latch you on.  He has done wayyy too many times to ignore. He is a shit human being who made great content at his peak.  It even explains why he is not even bothered by going into business with a Crypto Scammer.
I've been a fan of yours for a while but for the love of god just let the f-ing fight go and take the L, you massive manchild. I know you said that you hate losing but... so does everyone on this planet and in all of history. The act of losing doesn't make you a loser. It's the way that you handle the loss that makes you a loser and JJ from what I'm seeing right now.... you are acting like the biggest f-ing loser in the history of losers. I sincerely hope that you stop this behavior and I hope that you stop allowing this fight or, what you obviously see it as, this loss to continue to define your boxing career because honestly, nobody cares. go change it by winning some more fights.
ksi is 🐐
this guy is still crying? 😂 30yr old man
This video sucked. You went down the route of attacking your opponent’s personal life and encouraging harassing the guy just because you lost your fight and had your appeal rejected. This just makes you look so much worse, man.
boxing is corrupt man.
not the best way to grapple with losing
But KSI still the goat tho
bro made his L even bigger smh
Bro tryna cope😂
I’m glad these comments aren’t blindly following KSI opinions and statements. This video wasn’t it. This is a immature sore loser talking. Huge disappointing video.
I actually forgot about that fight 😅
Sore loser, cop the L you hypocrite 🤣
Tommy fury dancing with Chris brown, can’t beat Jake and Ksi, about fight 54 year old roy jones and probably lose to him… Tommy fury is a disgrace to the fury family but so is Tyson after losing to Francis and mma legend and so is his dad so they fit well together they all a disgrace to their names
bro got the flappy bird style
Yeah acting like this just basically spells out that you deserved to lose.
He was completely coping for the entire video but the amount of respect i lost in those last few minutes will never be surpassed. Calling for harassment is one of the 3 biggest sins online next to doxxing and swatting, completely embarrassing behavior from a 30 year old YouTube OG, i really expected better from one of my all time favorite creators
LOSER!
What a poor response to the whole situation, build some character bud.
another cringe take lets see how his white knights defend him this time
Good to have you back man 😇
attacking his parenting is so crazy 😂
KSI man to man from the bottom of my heart! YOU ARE A MAN OF WEAK CHARACTER! and will forever and always be what you always said you where, a SIDEMAN! no amount of money will change that.  I don't even really like tommy fury but i respect him! you are the company you keep, chilling with Logan is really rubbing off on you, this video right here, is that of a scumbag!
MANCHILD
its because your black
We will be there to witness the downfall of ksi
actual man child rant, I was a huge fan for years but this is laughable 😂😂😂😂
grow up and let him live his life
Came to see him react to gta 6 but didnt expect this. Damn sorry to hear that man
Oh get over it. Baby.
Sore loser just retire
Sore loser.
You really need to just take the loss, be a man and accept that you lost, I'm a fan of you and never even really liked Tommy but you have to accept the fact that you lost and leave the man alone, you clearly can not get it out of your head even a month after the loss lmao.
Shameful behavior as usual.
Honestly man just stick to YouTube and reacting  You're entertaining as a content creator but you are NOT a boxer  It's not even boxing you guys are doing, it's like watching a street fight with rules
I don't think he gets it. The fact of the matter is that he did not do enough in that fight to take the win convincingly. AND even is he does feel like he did, trying to weaponize your fanbase against your opponent I think is the worst possible way to go about this. Have some class bro you inspire so many people with how far you've come. He thinks losing the fight will hurt his legacy but his reaction to losing is destroying it more. He doesn't even have to be nice to Tommy just don't abuse the power the fans gave you dude
Knowledge = NONE Strength = DEFINITELY NONE Integrity = UNEQUIVOCALLY NONE!!!!
Yeah, you lost  Get over it and improve.
You may have meant to win the fight but at the end of the day, you didn't. Appealing or whatnot is fine (even though you made fun of Logan for doing the exact thing), but the way you're going about this isn't class. Yes everyone is proud of u for how far you have come! You have put in the work and it paid off! However, your fans are just disappointed in how you dealt with this situation with such a lack of maturity.
What should we call you now? Because you have none of what your name stands for lmao
Stfu enough…. what was tht boxing mate ?
To the kids who are watching this video. Don’t listen to him, he’s not a good role model. You can do better
UNSUBSCRIBED
Genuinely disappointing, unsubscribing. A sore loser to someone who doesn't call out his business partner for scamming millions, you had heart but now your rotten. I find it impossible not to find some kind of fault with you if you have been watching for at least a year. Full of greed ignorance etc. Laughable
We really live in a world where Jake Paul copes better with a loss than this guy
The world finally opening their eyes to KSI’s crimes
Jj sorry bro but doing star jumps then wildly swinging into a clinch because you haven’t connected is never going to get you a points win… the judges would have been watching thinking what’s this guy doing
JJ it does not really matter to us if you won or lost... Would we have preferred if you would have won, sure yeah why not ! But does it really matter if you did not. No not at all !
You threw an overhead right into the clinch for six rounds and thought you won your right about people not caring after paying money to watch that atrocity 😂
Coming off like a sore looser 😂
Damn, y'all are soft
Wow, what a sore loser. Imagine blaming your opponent for a verdict that he didn't decide, and then encouraging your fan base to harass this man online and in-person.  This is disgraceful and shameful.
Great video bro. Finally you're back.
Tommy is a proper boxer since a kid why’s he fighting YouTubers
Tommy: Actually boxes in the match Ksi: jumping jacks, Huggies and kisses at regular intervals, complains about back of the head shots(Kinda ironic ain’t it?)…etc
Take the L
No one likes a sore loser
🤡
I love that you're enjoying Boxing. But i still miss the old KSI. you're becoming Logan Paul, which everyone hates. Still your supporter!
Not the jj i know
No, you lost😂
Tommy Fury hasn't tweeted since the fight or even mention you (at least to my knowledge) and you're out here having sleepless nights over the fact that you lost a boxing match and than you ask your fans to continue harassing Tommy and you start bringing up his kid into this.  You complain about Dillon bringing Logans wife into it, now you do it with Tommys kid. You complain about Jake being a sore loser, now you are one. You complain about Logan being a sore loser, now you are one.
You should take your own advice from a few years back and just accept the L, honourably.
Clown 🤡
Respect
KSI take trip you earn it❤👍
This ma goat fr
There are bots GLAZING Ksi
Bro he's just joking no one has this much time to go and do such bs and all 😂
you said if you lose you go bald can you actually
God being a sore loser is pathetic lmao you expect it from these folk though. Endless victims
you are 30 bro
You're a disgrace bro. Take the loss like a man and move on. You can tell you don't hang around the boys anymore. You spend to much time with Logan and have taken the worst parts of him into yourself.  Your ego is out of control and this behaviour is shameful. You're an adult, act like it.
You both boxed like shit and all you did was hug, maybe come back to YouTube bro
Proud of youuu
meat riders are crazy ngl.
We can build up from a lost don’t worry man!
You deserve the break jj even if they say you lost but you won big time brother
stop embarrasin yourself more just move on you lost its not that big of a deal and we should not remind tommy he didnt win we should remind u, you lost
Saw the reddit post about this video and came to watch and honestly, they were pretty much spot on, the second half of this video is quit embarrassing to say the least, to attack a guy's personal life just because you lost a fight (even if you think you didn't) is just sad to see, I mean if you did it mockingly without that egotistical tone it would've looked better, still embarrassing nonetheless
Ksi is an egotistical maniac
You got beat, it wasn’t really close either lol
I am glad that you guys call him out for asking his fans to harrast the guy, bro that move was not it. Not trying to be a hater but that was a childish move literally, just accept the decision man the fight was over move on, set a new goal, learn from your mistakes, and get better not dwelling on the past and making petty moves.
Hey KSI, just watched your latest video and I've gotta say, it's disappointing to see you act like a child, refusing to take the L gracefully. Going after Tommy's family, especially bringing up his newborn child, is just crossing the line. It's crystal clear how horribly lacking KSI is in sportsmanship and basic human decency. It's quite disappointing to see KSI stoop to such levels. Maybe Tommy, with six fewer years of life experience, can still teach KSI a thing or two about class, maturity, and treating others with respect.
Honestly shocked for the the fan base this man has to be that much of a sore lozer is actually embarrassing just take the loss jj you do t have to  violate a guy that literally doing his fucking job
egos almost as big as that underbite
maybe if you actually did something instead of spamming the fucking "overhead right into a hug"
You lost. Take it and learn.
He needs to stay away from Logan Paul . That scammer is turning jj into his previous version when he lost against JJ like a sore loser .
Dawg your 30…. This shit is fucking embarrassing.. just take the loss and move on
Bruhhh.... It's time to say yes .yes....yes...yes.... Finally and there won't be no...no...noo...f*...s*hit.... c*...balls anymore😂❤
KSI GOT WRECKED!!! You can't box, that's why you lost a boxing match and looked like a scrub in there
I get the frustration, but insulting him as a father and sending your audience to attack others blatantly is a bit much. I support you, but not this video or what you said here. Hope you apologize and take this down or edit it further😊
Definition of thuggin it out😭
Pathetic tbh. Hold the L and quit telling your fanbase to attack someone, even in person. 😂
Bro just accept the fact that you lost
sore loser
Using Adesanya as an example is terrible, hes notoriously garbage at calling a winner in fights despite being a fighter himself. You didn't win bro, move on, its pathetic.
JJ, I love you with my whole heart but your so much bigger then him. I loved this vid  till the personal attacks. No need man. Love you take care
Clown show
You could have accepted the loss and used the fact that it was close to angle for redemption in a rematch. Instead you've chosen to throw a prolonged fit.   You're setting a poor example of sportsmanship for your young fans.
Sore loser wow
I’ve said it once, and I’ll say it every time:  You’ve earned the right to not have to apologize to literally ANYBODY.  You f**king won.  You’ll always make us proud and the anger that you feel is always going to resonate with us.  We’re always proud of you, JJ…
Get help
Get help
what a weirdo, you lost, accept it
Couldn’t knock you out because you kept hugging😂 the logic is crazy
Proper sore loser attitude  Proper embarrassing you’ve even made this video let alone the remarks you’ve made   Get over it you lost, move on   Logans personality rubbing off on ya
Embarrassing
first half of the video: 😃  second half of the video: 🫣
.
In all fairness, I didn't think it was impossible to throw 2 punches and proceed to hug someone. You guy's really set the standard low for "Impossible" huh, you refused to push the action in almost every round, landing one good overhand in the first. You're looking at this from a youtube boxing perspective, if this where real boxing, no one would've cared that you lost, and it's the fact that all that preparing to quite literally clinch 3/4's of every round was a horrible showing. Take you're loss like a man, and improve, instead of calling it a robbery and whining about it.
JJ I've been watching your content for years, and I have always been a huge fan and had a great deal of respect for you. But this is just getting pathetic now. You lost. Fucking get over it. Regardless of whether or not you were robbed, the verdict was made and that's just that. Be a man and take your loss like a real champ, not like a whiny, insecure man-child.
" bro ive been a fan since..." No one cares lil bro just spit out what u wonna say.
Many people get pissed over KSI telling people to berate tommy in public. . .  why? Who gives a shit XD
Lol you lost
this comment section is full of weirdos trying to preach to a person online lol
Bro sound like my average  8 grade presentation
Bruh we love you and your big head.
The comment section is cooking
Breaking terms of service by telling your fan base including myself to harass a person for your gain sorry that is to far. Please go back to your old self like In the fifa days.
As an og fan from back when you first started i have watched you and grown up with you as an idol, both of us the same age i even celebrate my birthday one day before your brothers.  I grew up watching you enjoying the content i never played fifa but i loved the series the openings and the skits i watched all the lets plays with you and your bro and all the making my parents watch such and such videos.  I even enjoyed all the Q and A sundays, you was weird and crazy but you was also funny and made me laugh.  You talk about your legacy and how you want to be remembered, well thats how i want to remember you, the guy who i grew up with and saw your fan base expand from being in the hundreds to the thousands and then millions, the sidemen, youtube red series, your book the audio books and the sidmen house with racka racka even tgf,  you have had so many generations look up to you from your content or your music or the boxing. But seeing you go off like this and telling your fans man little kids to go harass someone either online or in person because you lost that is fucked bro, you was supposed to be the hero the kid in his bedroom making dumbass videos to this household name on the radio even tv shows on the bbc. Dont ruin your legacy with your ego man, we are and will always be proud of you for what you have done, we do not care you lost. You only truly lost that fight when you made this video.  You probably wont even read this but if you do, we love you JJ be better and be what weve always seen you as and dont become an asshole because you lost
Child
GTA 6
L video getting your 50 million fans to harrass a man and his family. Thought you were better than this JJ
Just focus on your self brother. fuck all the hating and just be proud of what you acieved.
jj why did you feel the need to explain yourself? You’re good bro. Loss shouldn’t have been but it is what it is. Keep your chin up. You need a break don’t need to explain yourself. Your life. We enjoy your videos when you post that’s all you need to know.
I need some pasta, with all this Salt 🤤😂😂
Male Sssniperwolf
Pretty shameful response.
yikes
The cope is real.
U lost homie get over it bro its sucks just stay positive
The only thing that was robbed from anybody was people’s money for that joke of an event. Absolutely trash.
Bros 30 being this immature
This is so shameful, you’re 30 years old mate. Going from “it isn’t personal” to mentioning his wife, talking about his child to then encourage your millions of fans to harass him wherever he goes all because you lost.
Thank you God not a Reddit video cause they suck IMO old KSI please come back
Regardless win or lose take it as it is
This guys a dick. What fame can do to someone is scary.
This guys ego is so disgraceful lmao this dude just salty and needs to grow some balls and stop hating on Tommy. What’s done is done jj needs to mov won and continue with his yt stuff
Take the L mate, this is poor.
Bro get over you lost you’re clapped, finished and you’re still in the first stage of grief, denial lmao. Just stick to making YouTube videos, if I’m being honest he hasn’t improved in his form and style tbh. He’s just a joke boxing just isn’t his thing.
LSI
logan rubbing off on u
Wow, dude, how old are you? This was embarrassing to watch. Take your lumps and move on.
For all you clowns talking nonsense in this comment section. There is ab easy escape route for you if you don't like what he said. Unsub and f off, not hard
Basically sending a hate wave army of fans to harrass someone is WILD
DANGER: STRONG AMOUNTS EVEN DEADLY OF COPIUM ARE INCOMING.
Yes you lost. Easily you lost. You also kicked and cried like a child
This aged well👍
yall fr cryin, jj is in the right here like its not so deep, "im dissapointed in you jj" like hnstly stfu no one cares, let the world know he won thjat fucking fight
All down hill after he said “ I’m the one who can see John CENA”
KSI I’ve followed you forever but man ur so salty
What a shameful video, take the L and learn from it instead of attacking someone’s personal life. It looks like you lived long enough as the hero to actually become the villain…sad
The fight was terrible
YES U DID LOSE, I hate Tommy too. U lost and lowered YOURSELF BY BEING SUCH A POOR SPORT. U lost and AT BEST WAS A DRAW. Cry more billionaire
the sidemen have been so supportive of you during this , and in the past , have been so good at keeping you grounded, it seems like your starting to drift  yes you have had amazing success , but remember so much has come from fans who support you , as you were , someone who made mistakes , could laugh at their mistakes and move on,   your still someone they look up to , but your not a role model , at the moment. part of life is accepting your mistakes , not blaming people , and remembering your only human ,  your so caught up in the mentality of nightmare , your living in a dream,  don't become Icarus  , money and success are fleeting what will be your legacy
Embarrassing
JJ UR FANS DONT GIVE AF ABOUT YOUR FIGHT! Ofc we’re sad you lost, but I’m very sure we care, and have been caring, more about your videos with this channel and the Sidemen far more than this one fight. You are KSI aka JJ Olatunji the YouTuber AND boxer, influencer, rapper, singer, etc. not vice versa
You lost
Professional coping. Bro made a whole video trying to validate his feelings.
You lost lil bro
Loser
Ksi smh delete this bro it’s bad who let you upload this … 🪦
Jesus Christ now that you’re back and over the loss can you just understand most of us didn’t start watching for me at least in 2012 because you were fighting oh boo-hoo you lost a fight OK can we get back to what we care about they try not to laugh’s in the Reddit videos who cares of 10% of the comments are going to be Jake Paul’s fanboys trying to laugh at you. He also lost so they’re just as dumb.
WSI
JJ why are talking shit?  You lost…
Well hey at least the OG fans understand how gross this is. Ksi just has this young impressionable fanbase that fuels his ego and enables this kind of behavior. He needs a break from the internet or something
We know you wouldve lost against jake paul 😆 🤣
YOU LOST HAHAHAHAHA
This is sad man
TRU SHI
This man is not a role model.
No way youre sending your fans to attack Tommy online and irl because he beat you in a boxing match... then getting personal about his family is a no no.
You sure didn't lie about the baby talk. Tommy aint NEVER with his daughter lol
You’ve become what you once hated. People who don’t step up, be the bigger man,  and accept responsibility/ defeat. The man you once were is slowly leaving, you’re becoming like all the rest. What have you become JJ. You’ve become exactly what you once hated. It’s over JJ, it’s all over. The untouchable status you once had is gone. You’re not invulnerable anymore, you’ll slip away like all of the others. Catch yourself JJ or this might be the end. Remember we’re always there though
Pathetic
https://youtube.com/shorts/M9Bt_t1G-WY?si=nxEimJwERGVIU1NB
Get back in the ring and keep fighting .
tommy fury a little sh!t anyways
You need some NO MEN in your circle . Ksi you didn't win the fight . Tommy won on points
This is disgusting from ksi
U lost. Move on. Be better
trained so hard, but you still don't take this sport seriously, you need to get out of your delusion and accept you lost and you should stop training with that MMA gym this ain't ufc, it's boxing, learn to box, I suggest training with Daley (Deji and KingKenny's trainer) because hard work does pay off, you can't half-arse boxing, so actually learn how to box, you don't have a real passion for the sport and all it's intracicies
I can smell all the younger KSI fans rushing over to aid JJ by harassing Tommy and I'm not for it. JJ, you are a grown-ass man. Stop with the high school bs because some of us will call you out for it.   A loss is a loss and you can improve behind that loss but the way how you're doing it isn't the way.
Judging from this video and how he took the loss on the night, JJs therapist must be rubbish at their job
I am so happy that you lost
KS
This is embarrassing from you JJ, it just shows that you cannot deal with your pride being hit, be humble like you used to be and take the loss like a man, please
Ksi is a sore loser and I like it 😂
I’m still proud of you JJ. Loss or win!
Clown 🤡 stop whining and take the L
What a waste of oxygen. All that wait just to act like a child 😂😂😂 I blame us for giving you this ego, don’t make youtube again
Ksi is a clown
You're embarrassing bro😂😂🤣
grow up bro u lost accept it move on
Encouraging children to harass a man for winning a fight… disgusting 🤢🤮 …. This can’t go unchecked… this channel should have a strike or be demonetised for how even long sniper wolf was… no double standards!
Grow up man
being a long term fan of yours, its sad to see that you cant even fully accept defeat when its blaring in your face. The loss isn't even that bad, you're just turning it into a big thing because you can't accept that you've failed at something. Nothing wrong with failure, the way you handle it is what matters, and you're handling it horribly.
Laughing at Logan lost age poorly
There's a whole lot of anger in this video towards that man. Almost obsessive like
Bro just cant take an L
54 year old Roy Jones Jr is way better than you
Your new name should be I am a bitch
Embarrassing
Dang it took u awhile 😂😂
Look at the way you shii on Logan after he appealed. Bruh you're doing the same thing.
It just PERFECTLY SETS UP for KSI vs Jake Paul. It has to happen there's too much at stake for it not to happen!
30 years old? Grow up, bro. You lost a hugging contest. Why attack his family and use your fans to harass him. You can see in your demeanour, you aint over the result of the match. I suppose you have a younger generation of fans watching you now. Set them an examole of how to get back up from major setbacks. Your business partner knows how to do this the best
Jake Paul handled a loss better than you
Terrible boxer
L
Bell piece you are
The “Boxing” was nothing more than a money making scheme. It’s all about making everyone even more money whilst ripping everyone else off 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ Embarrassing
Boo hoo bro excuse after excuse
W
KSI this is disgusting telling your fans to berate Tommy furry online and in real life maybe take the L and take Logan Paul’s line “I made a severe and continuous lapse of my judgement”
Keep going brother your a real champion. looking back you’ve accomplished great things and great things are bound to happen to you
Cool fight Jake now. That’s the big reason why you came back to boxing😐
So low from you for hating on Tommy fury for not be with his daughter, what does that have to do with you, do you know them?? I was expecting something else from you man, I’m so disappointed
KSI, lost that fight only his fans will think he won. What did he do ? He jumped with his arms out to avoid Tommy from getting close which was stupid there are other ways to keep the distance but even then Tommy is the bigger man. Back of the head punches KSI also threw many himself. Punches landed Tommy landed more KSI landed a couple more power punches. KSI didn’t want to initiate any kind of fight wasted his fans money who actually paid to go. Tommy wanted to box he wanted to fight. Also if the PBA reject your appeal must be a very valid reason as to why.
Rematch him.
Let's see how long it's going to take for him to make an apology video for sending his fans to attack Tommy Fury  Cmon JJ bringing his wife and kid into this really? that's low maybe Deji should tell you to be humble in defeat   You are better than this
The old Ksi would wreck the 2023 Ksi
i used to love JJ but he has lost his way and needs to be put underground now
you won
Lost respect for JJ after this
You just ruined the message at the end of the video by acting like a sore loser.  Cope all the way through this video with you being petty slagging Tommy on how he is as a Dad, then even acts like a scumbag and try to weaponise your fan base to harris Tommy.  After all this time, this video is just embrassing.  Grow up.  Many fighters lose when they shouldn't have and handle it better.
✌🏻✌🏻
you’re a trash boxer
Also encouraging harassment isn’t good
Ya a fraud   And got no boxing skills
Sore loser 😂
yo someone get this man a bra and a tampon rq
This is sad. Even for a YouTuber
telling fans to harass someone because you cant get over your blistering ego, insulting how he parents his child, grow up and get a life outside of other peoples skin, weirdo.
Bro is still in denial 😂💀
L
Now go fight jake and take that ass beating😂
are you not embarrassed
JJ, I enjoy your content, and I’m a fan, but you are way out of line. I understand it’s hard to feel like a let down when you don’t reach impossible standards, but attacking him, calling him a bad father, and telling us to harass him? All because you lost? No, you did not win that fight, and no, we aren’t going to harass him. You really need a reality check man. You’re being a crybaby sore loser over losing ONE boxing match. Get over yourself
KSI, you lost because you didn't box and you didn't box because you aren't a boxer. Hopping, lunging, skipping, and star jumping around the ring whilst wildly throwing your arms unfortunately isn't boxing.
The egotistic guy, who's been living on easy street since he was a kid,  can't handle losing, throws a temper tantrum 🤣Is anyone really surprised?  Take the L, loser, and move on like everyone else.
You are my biggest role model after my dad
New element discovered. Copium
your ego is taken hold of you man telling people to harass tommy and his family is insane won’t be watching you anymore till you sort your self out
You need a reality check mate. The last couple of years ive started seeing a different side of you, which made me doubt if you playing an arrogant prick for fun was just a joke. The worst moment was when you were trying to cancel Wade for being slightly critical. I think training hasnt humbled you enough and i would recommend you taking a good look at yourself
If it was a hugging competition, you definitely won.
L KSI
I do not think you won but it definitely was a draw
"Jack of all trades, master of none."   Can't say I'm looking forward to all the Reddit reacts and Try Not To Laugh videos for the next couple years. 🥱
Cant win a fight when u just throw a wild punch then hug and then cry after like u got robbed 😂 bro u looked like shit 😂 u were suppost to knock him out like u said which u were not even remotely close to doing that u gotta actually fight to do that lmao the guy lost a point and still beat you , you can't talk smack after that
yeh jj you needed a reailty check, i feel you hanging with logan and your mindset is so not what we like if you do come back to do a reddit video you will get slaughterd
Such a sore looser
Not a good look
Reality is that neither of ypu should have won. Embarrassing display of boxing.
What a bitter little joke!! Dude you are such a baby and you not having any kids can’t say anything.
KSI, I used to love watching your content and funny videos, but like you gotta just have some good sportsmanship.  It's not the end of the world if you lose against Tommy Fury; ppl are not going to be talking about it forever and even I didn't remember about the fight for the decision until recently when this was brought up.
your still a winner dunno why ypur depressed over a loss
Everybody in this comment section who talks crap about KSI and hating should now know that Tommy Fury win should be put in to question after the same thing happened to Francis Ngannou. And Tyson didn’t even get a point deducted after the elbow!!!
I’m glad you’re back
Bro is coping
We knew you lost since the fight what are you talking about,  you cant win by hugging
💀💀💀
Ksi bro i think jake next to fight soon i think so and btw no punches  both weeird normally sidemen  there random bad blood with both them two 😢🎉 😅 tommy ur a bitch and ksi string him up 😮 boy😅
Bro, YOU DIDN'T  WON ....YOU LOST THIS ONE. GET IT OVER ...YOU A SORE LOOSER
You lot actually think berating him is not normal? Lads he ....... def shouldn't have won...so I see it as fair
Needs to find himself here 😂😂🙃👋
woah! This is a new low. Just proves youtube misfit boxing is not a sport. If you behave like this, you are not a sportsman, saying the things you did about Tom T partying, you have no idea their circumstance, as a father, we are entitled to nights out occasionally. Once you are a father you will realise this. Shame on you! Grow up.
Sore loser
irrespective of whether people think he won or he lost, telling viewers to harass someone's social media and even harass them IRL if opportunity strikes is absolutely wild.  bro took one loss and is bitching about it profusely  also, as boxing goes, i don't think ksi won at all. i'm not a boxing expert but bro was flailing around the ring all 6 rounds and only threw insanely overboard overhand hits. reminded me of ksi v logan paul 2 windmill strat. i like ksi more than tommy but i don't believe i'm under any illusions about how he performed. given how many strikes he landed + tommy's point deduction, should've been a draw IMO
Sore loser….
You should be very proud of what you’ve achieved, but this is not a win. This video is poor, learn to lose and move on, don’t keep attacking Tommy, be a better sportsman instead of one of those embarrassing egotistical idiots who have to put others down to feel better about themselves. You have a lot of young lads who look up to you and need to see better.
Ksi has nothing to talk about being a good father. Hasn't ksi had so many abortions?? Lmao so sad ksi..
well, it took this guy nearly two months to come out with a video sayin, "i lost"
https://youtu.be/Z1jrEn6Vejw?si=57uEefptyzEbhzsK
We know the truth KSI beat that man 😂
He hit you in the back of the head... That's some p*ssy sh*t
JJ you lost mate it is what it is. Do I think you should’ve lost? Yes, do I think Tommy shouldve won? No. It was an extremely poor fight and shouldnt have been a winner at all. However take what you know and love about boxing, keep it humble and most definitely do not be a sore loser. Move on
Bro, it was a hugging match. I don’t know what else to say. It was a hugging match.
So no appeal?
you lost man
Telling your fans to harass someone and criticising Tommy as a parent is truly pathetic. You lost and can't box for sh*t. Move on.
Bro hasnt read his ig comments, EVERYBODY think you lost
You won for us jj
You lost your legacy by being a sore loser.
Everybody forgot the fight ever happened and bro is out here still in denial that he lost 2 months later 💀
*Fuckkkk the Furys*  I am confident, based on the evidence at hand, that the outcome was in your favor.   There appears to be a questionable pattern of influence from the Fury family, reminiscent of the Nnganou match. I believe it would amplify our message if you were to state,   *'I am convinced of my victory and appreciate your continued support. It's unfortunate that the integrity of boxing appears to be compromised, as suggested by Dana. This incident further substantiates that claim. Despite the shared predicament of Nnganou and myself, I remain hopeful. The appeal process is still underway, and there's a possibility that the ruling could be revised to a draw. Regardless of the outcome, my resolve remains unshaken, and I stand stronger than ever, unfazed.'*
Bad taste this brother and immature. Grow up
Ksi has finally been humbled
Man out here like Ippo post-Date  Edit: man should have taken 3 months out  Edit 2: make that a year
Bro just let it go you lost, the winner wasn’t you, just take it man damn we’re suppose to be cheering you on but you making it damn hard tommy won that fight it’s wraps, let the ego go bro
JJ, get redemption by beating Jake.
Stop complaining you are a billionaire

Dude became so desperate he resorted to sending his brainless fans to harass tommy lmfao
Still a sore loser
TBH it was actually a Tie and we all know KSI will still remain the G.O.A.T even with everyone saying KSI won
You ain't Mayweather
Why are you sending your fans on his posts to hate on him tho? Not cool
Thanks for the video got kind of worried about you and you definitely won that fight
Everyone commenting that he reacted badly about the loss😭 even though you would act the same if you genuinely believed you had won. Think about how much time and effort he put into this fight. If you say you would act any differently you are lying to yourself smh
Swaying your audience into harassing Tommy irl is very disappointing bro. I know you're way better than this JJ, take the lose like a champ and don't let it ruin your character. ❤ All love bro
What you on ksi I see dem eyes
look how francis handled the lose to tyson compared to ksi vs tommy and now you want your fans to harass tommy who did nothing this ain’t the ksi we use to enjoy
This was cringe and just a salty video...... used to wait for jj videos but now it just too toxic to have a good time.... instead of moving on jj is stuck and trying to convince himself that he diid good which he didn't and implementing these ideas on others....... jj have surrounded himself with people who would say things to make him happy or feel special..... cause jj is an insecure person..... people dream of the success he had but still he's this much insecure..... INSECURITY IS THE BIGGEST DISEASE and jj just proved that
Why does this kooky, mouth breathing, big-lipped ooga-booga laugh after every sentence?
How can Tommy cheat when it was your event
Just keep training JJ! Even if Tommy Fury "won" you shouldn't give up. Youre an amazing boxer with a bright career ahead of you. Don't let anyone stop you.
at 7:50 you ask your audience to attack another individual. crazyyyy
Can we stop with the narrative that: I'm just a YouTuber blah blah blah No, in the press conferences, you were an unbeatable God and now you are just a YouTuber? It doesn't work like that I love you man but keep the narrative the same
u didn't win for shi
Been of fan of Ksi for years. But I was disappointed to see his reaction he seemed like a sore loser and petty. Yes he maybe should of won against Tommy but to go after Tommy’s fanbase and personal life is unnecessary. I hope he realises that it's ok to be disappointed but he needs to take it on the chin and move on its done now
Bro my family owns a boxing gym been boxing my entire life and you lost wasn't an impressive win but he won give it up the tantrum after and all this whinging is just embarrassing.
Don’t worry ksi I also lost nnn watching your videos so I guess we both lost something
Ksi yes you should have won that fight but as they say shit happens. But don’t be a child and bring his personal life into this and don’t encourage kids and others to harass Tommy online. Yes losing hurts but acting like a child makes you the worst loser even if u should’ve won. This is a hard watch
He is where he is because of his so called “delusion” and if y’all are so in touch with reality and not “delusional” then stay where tf you are and keep being “real”…. And unsuccessful in life 😂
Aint no way KSI is acting like this after all the times in the past where he has hated prople who acted like this
bro is so bitter
Jj needs to learn from logan. Terrible attitude from jj.
There Is one fighter who will beat Tommy and that's usyk
Delete this video lil bro 😂
Yes!
Take the LOSS mate ffs such a crybaby move on with life instead of telling your fans to harass him man wtf you making yourself look a right tit KSI more like KSL
I really really hate that KSI is attacking Tommy and not giving the prep for having a good fight against him. But I will vouch for him and say that you guys are acting like he's pressed over a simple loss, where if this is proven right it could actually be massive. Especially with all the people saying that he basically won. I'll just say that I don't like his blatant attacks on Tommy or how he possibly is (but not certain) justifying all his work for why he be better that he lost more than say Logan Paul (which he might have mocked Tommy if he lost). Like Connor McGregor doesn't work as hard if not more and still loses here and there and doesn't brag about his work ethic 24/7. But I think the hate in these comments might be overreacting a little for the allegations being made. KSI, just take a break more and let yourself rest; don't need to keep fighting time after time to prove we all love you.
Stop bitching like logan
This video is a no from me chief. You lost, accept it and move on. No need to critique his family life nor encourage fans to harass him anywhere.
Grow up BE HAPPY ❤,, YOU ALL NEED TO GET A LIFE ,, TRY BEING A REAL PERSON,, AND TELL PEOPLE WHAT U THINK ,, IF THEY CARE AND RESPECT YOU,, THEY SHOULD BE TELLING YOU THE TRUTH,,, IF NOT THEN JUST WALK AWAY ,,, BECAUSE THAT PERSON WILL ALWAYS FIND FAULT WITH YOU ,,, EVEN IF YOU WAS DIEING,,, IF YOU FEEL ITS WRONG THEN ,,LOOK YOUSELF IN THE MIRROR, AND JUST ASK YOURSELF,, IF YOUR HAPPY ,,,IF NOT THE FRONT DOOR IS ALWAYS THERE ,, PLZ DONT LISTEN TO ALL THE SAD STORIES,, WE HAVE ALL BEEN THERE ,,, BUT FOR SOME IT WAS THERE FIRST TIME,,, 55 AND CANT TELL THE TRUTH, GOD BLESS AND MERRY CHRISTMAS ❤❤❤❤
Been watching you since I was a 13, im 23 now and still get excited to watch your content. You’re the winner in our eyes, keep up the great work!!
We proud because u did well, and tbh i thought fury would actually put up a fight but he did shiet 🤣, KSI you did great trust dawg
Brother, move on! 😂😂  Win lose or draw, we still come to watch you, not your boxing record
Jj your coping.
Jj took his dad to dubai and i bet he still didnt get a hug
KSI, we know your work. We know who you are, keep up the good work brother. ❤❤
Grow up.
9.2 dislikes it’s getting thumbed down
Bro you need to sit down, reflect and accept that u lost smh
still waiting for the jake paul fight
JJ you won that fight and everyone knows it, but we need to stop this issue, Ngl I want you guys to have a rematch
so low of you to go after tommys kid
Its like every time you would a big jab, you'd step back immediatley losing so much power doing so..
KSI im a huge fan but you lost let it go bro..  stop being delulu 😂
100% couldn’t agree more salah is a goat
The only thing that won was that big ass 10x  head
🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏 whataJack *
Well the consensus of the comment section seems to be "you lost, get over it"
Nah bro, you just a sore loser thats it. You finally lost and there is nothing you can do about it😂😂😂  Go fight Speed idk. Atleast then you can act like you are Canelo
You lost bro
No need to explain your reasons for taking a break - you have given us 10-13 years or joy on YouTube and you can take a few weeks when you need. All the rest of us certainly can and do!
Bro ... Let him do whatever he wants ..
JJ this wasn't it man. If you wanted to make a video you could've gone over where you thought you were robbed, what areas you feel they got wrong etc. Telling your fans to harass and invade Tommy's personal life simply because you lost is extremely immature. It's not funny nor is it Tommy's fault that the judges scored against you. Whether you, or any fans for that matter, feel like you scored a draw or even won, encouraging your fans to harass an opposing fighter is about as unprofessional as you can get in boxing. I understand you're frustrated with the result, but I expected better man.
and i lost in fifa against a 11 years old kid.  i cursed fifa and tell the kid iam his unknown father then i go offline and cried
GRAPES ARE SOUR
What a sore loser.
New low for u bro. Be humble. Learn. If your smart you’ll learn your mistakes and flaws. This loss was a big ego check. So butthurt about a first loss. Be better.
it’s so funny how big of a hypocrite jj is, made fun of logan for appealing the fight yet he does the same and acted even worse than tommy after the loss, he’s still bashing tommy’s name whilst tommy is living his life, and even had the audacity to be like “this nerdy kid went up against you” take your loss like a man and shut up
Yeaaaaaaaahhh naaaaahhh this video ain’t it
You also need to understand that clinching is not boxing
His ego is HURTTTTTTT
not enough laugh, need more to convince me
Bro you lost, just deal with it. And if you have any dignity, just take the L and come back stronger. Stop whining about it ffs😂
Mate, ive been watching you for over a decade now and I cant help but think this video was made in poor taste.  This is not the way to take a loss, and does not reflect well on you either
JJ, as an OG fan, I have witnessed your long journey to become who you are. You remind us constantly about your rags-to-riches story as if we've already forgotten about it. But the question is - who have you become? Your dire need for success has turned into an addiction It is that matters more to you than anything You said it yourself: even the Sidemen shoots, which were very good since you came back, don't really make up for it Sure, losing is depressing, especially when you have a competitive nature, but it no way does it justify inciting the hate towards another human being Nothing can justify it, really This is just not humanlike behaviour We get it, you work really really hard, but don't we all? Don't we all grind for the better of us and our people? Look at your peers, you friends - they work a lot too Do they gain the power to incite hate against someone? Absolutely not.  Be better, JJ, be better.
Cmon Ksi it’s it’s boxing you win some and loose some you don’t go off crying and try appeal your decision in my opinion I don’t think you should box again or fight jake Paul because if you loose it would crush your mental state your clearly broken after this loss so In my opinion u shouldn’t box again and stick do what u do best entertainment👍
Im sad
Jj you lost, thats life. Sometimes you win, sometimes you have to take Ls. Learn how to lose sometimes. Nobody is gonna hate you just because you lost one time
Ideally I would Honestly say I wanna see you move on from the whole boxing craze and venture into something simpler so you can just enjoy life.. but its a tough pill to swallow that tommy fury will be the cement to this boxing journey especially with how uncertain the results were ideally the appeal should come back as a draw although i think you won and if that happens tommy undoubtedly will refuse a rematch to settle things and you and jake finally clash to see who is the actual best influencer boxer and yous shake hands in respect of the sport and put this debate to bed
You’re a 30 year old man holding a needless grudge while encouraging your fans to continue harassing someone. That’s incredibly pathetic.  For a man so concerned with his legacy, you’re certainly doing a great job sullying it. Move on.
JJ what’re you doing man?  Hypocrisy for appealing the fight when you made fun of Logan for the same.  Making a video to exposing what tommy is doing.  Like dude just take the L and move on.  You can’t say you needed a break, when after the break you haven’t changed at all.  All love man but think it through
Dam this was emotional I almost wanted a cuddle 😂
Never seen baldski hurt so much
Wow u dont really realize this until someone says it damn
i thought this wasnt personal? and now a 30 year old man is telling his fans to harass a 24 year old man bc he cant take a loss? this is beyond embarrassing, truly sucks bc i've seen him grow as a person throughout many years and all that was thrown away in this video.
always supporting you
You've taken this loss horribly bro
Tbh I'm just here for YouTube not for the boxing
This comment is childish. But anyway, I really don’t care if you win or lose; just accept the loss and continue moving on. I'm still a fan, but, tbh, karma got you because you were too busy saying "I’m going to win" and being bitter by talking crap about Tommy and other people in general. Next time, stop lacking on the internet and focus on training better.🤷🏾‍♀️
You lost
Why should we hate Tommy fury just because you suck at boxing ?
I love the fact that you can tell who the true fans of JJ are. There are people here blaming him for being upset when realistically, he has every reason to be. He explains his upset very well. Someone can make a mistake and still mean well. The people who actually care about him are pointing out what he's doing wrong while also showing support, not just bringing him down for making a silly mistake. Best of luck JJ, keep pushing fella.   Edit: Tbh with you I honestly think you guys are overreacting, it was a stupid thing to say, but its obvious he's joking regardless.

very low of u telling people to harass him in public let’s be real man up and move on you lost and it is what it is  it shows ur still butthurt by you assuming he dosent spend time with his family and trying to attack him in every way u can, ur still hiding behind the youtuber vs professional argument stop that bullshit  ur very rich with access to some of the best coaches and been training boxing for 5 years which is plent of time to get decent and when u say Tommy did boxing his whole life he’s a great athlete but he’s young and still has a lot to learn I believe if their were more rounds in the fight he would’ve fucked u which is why you forced a 6 round and kept hugging him   not a hater just came to spit some facts
Salty much
Bro didn’t admit he was hugging Tommy half the time. You still lost buddy
Just because you lose a fight doesn’t mean you’re bad or that you have to quit. Regular athletes don’t win every time and thats all they do. You should be proud.
tommy fury all the way
Definitely a KSI W in my mind
This guys still crying about Tommy even after losing the appeal…. Bro this is just getting sad…. Used to love this guy too
JJ as much as we love you we all saw the same footage and you lost not only that you cant act like your not salty when you try to throw insults and attack tommy even after the fight.
I think you won 🏆 that fight because of hitting back the head but you did good ksi
❤❤❤
JJ stop this madness, you lost man. We're still here for you. Losing is just a part of life. You need to be humble, accept it and move on. Please
Sign lando norris to prime
Always been a KSI fan, and wanted him to win, but after seeing the way he has reacted to losing, I’m happy he lost
Just take the L bro😊
prime dodgers is missing in the back
Dude what is this rubbish, It's been over a month and you out here hating on Tommy and commenting  about his wife and kid personal life etc and even worse encouraging fans to 'berate'- hate on him FOR WHAT??? Who do think you are? You really should quit being a spoilt baby and get over it...
L ksi
It was a clear draw, u didn’t deserve the win Ksi let’s be honest (neither tommy)
We love you bro, you did and still have our respect!, you won that fight everyone knows that. So does tommy pussy fury.
Can you just ditch the boxing stuff and go back to playing road to ranked please? Or playing scary games with Deji? This boxing stuff is so so so boring now
All you did was hug bro
Bro, in a MMA fight you would have probably won but this was boxing. All you did all night long was throw an overhand, crash the distance and hold while throwing wild slaps😂 so in all honesty, you didn't do enough for the fury win. However it's great to see you're back, everyone breaks at some point, but you came back stronger and that's all that matters 😜 so respect bro, you've earned it💪
Jake was talking about Tommy not you bro 💀
This video is another big fat L. Never been so dissapointed in you as I am right now. Smh
JJ doesn’t realize this but Logan is his personal Yes Man. I think we can all see this except him lol
Training so hard to hug the whole fight.
Honestly i like jj but he definitly didnt won that fight
I've said it before and I'll say it again. Strikes me very suspicious that both of the fury Brothers "won" their fights by only a single point. Both you, JJ, and Francis, were robbed of your victories by a powerful family with high status, simply because they see you as a newcomer, an outsider, someone who doesn't belong. But you and Francis both proved to millions of people and to those judges who aren't corrupted by nepotism and greed, that if anybody truly belongs in this scene, it's you guys.
Take that L up your 🍑 and feel it
I love how the comment section are world tier boxing professionals and trying to tell JJ that he lost.
So you’re not going to be boxing anymore more room for me to knock Jake Paul’s lights out for you bro. I’ve believed in you the whole time since day one it’ll be an honor.
No one actually thought you won the fight. You’re just surrounded by yesmen
It’s about how you come back from the loss no matter what that loss is boxing music YouTube just life in general it’s how you come back
KSI really drinking his own kool aid these days, man's a professional clencher with arguably reduced technique over time. Rip anybody who actually paid for that garbage lol
HAHAHA YOU LOST! LSI GOT HUMBLED 😂
Shots fired 🥂
Public opinion is useless anyways, people like judging, I try my best to not care and you all should too.   Even if you frame KSI as a sore loser, if it helps you move on just allow these man and do whatever. Would say don't berate Tommy cuz mans looks like his mental health is spiralling downwards and you should never try to cause ill health to others, similarly with KSI, mans clearly gone through it and he don't need some hate to make the rest of the year any worse.  It's crazy how many people as well are actively engaged in boxing politics, celebrity politics, kpop politics, meanwhile you got countries bombing each other and people being stripped of human rights. Love how old people are in power now and none of us in the younger generation care. But at the same time it's hard to care because I don't think anyone feels like they have any say in our "Democracies".   If America decides to flatten Iraq, realistically we aint gonna do nothing, then we gonna forget about it a couple months later. If Bangladeshi's and Indian's are cheap labour for making clothes for say Primark and Adidas, that's calm. If China don't bother to feed their people, if Japan overwork their people, if Russia bomb Ukraine, if UKs BAE create bombs to sell to saudi to bomb yemen with, if America and Russia fund their own little battle using a Syria civil war, if Global entities fund Israel to further displace more Palestinians (in defence ofc), list is longer but this getting too long. IF ANY of these happen, we gonna throw a tiktok dance, take a dump, and go sleep, cuz nobody cares, I dont know if I do, and maybe thats okay because whats anyone gonna do, the worlds too big and were too busy dealing with whether or not KSI is a sore loser.   Big tangent ngl.
Sore loser 🤣🤣🤣
Clown thought he was that guy 🤡  Collaborating  with scammers and defending them. Being a prick to Tommy because he lost a fight. This is KSI's new legacy.
Hold that L like a pro not a child
Mann really wished this video was different i was patiently waiting for it and tbh jj this is not it man, being a long time fan is starting to feel embarrassing if your going to act like this.
JJ YOUR THE GOAT 🐐  REGARDLESS the result your the worlds winner. You've inspired millions of us to go for our dreams & push ourselves to our limits. Your amazing and we all love you ❤
Cant you say "hey guys true that i lost but i did well and let's move on" i think it will be better than going after tommy and his family for no reason.
Big L 🥳🥳🥳
You have a much bigger fan base, so ofcourse when you lose and dont admit it they will harass the opponent and you will feel like you didnt lose. It is fair to be upset JJ but telling the fans to harass him in the comments and in person is not acceptable, this us essentially what sore losers do. You have a huge fan base, many of which are impressionable young teens. This should give you kore responsibility as a public figure to show your good character and not attack others. What you just did at the end is low.
Damn this took a while
Keep going mate no matter what
dude fuck you for not posting sooner . im proud of everything . but this was some real bullshit
You did win mate so keep going if I see him I will tell him he lost and  paid the ref at least 5k just to beat a YouTuber he is that bad don’t give up
Tbh i dont even care that you lost you didnt disopoint any fans bevause i watched you for youtube and not boxing so i am happy you are back again dont give up fuck tommy en fuck everyone who says you didnt win because you did win in yhe hearts of the fans enjpy yoire day brother
JJ why you attacking a man and his family? You lost mate… telling your following to berate him? You just hit a new low
The way you handled the loss shows what a sore loser you are JJ
Take your KSI, your ego is through the roof
ego = fucked
LSI
Nobody thought ksi won
You lost. You move on. That’s that.
And the curse continues 😂he did shock the world
ksi a hater
Slow down, and enjoy the ride man. You’re killing it
maaaaaaaaaaaaaan, why act like a sore loser, this is a sad video
WOA, bro said “countless sidemen videos this year” while missing half of them LMAOOOO
Ksi got his ass kicked lol
Ofcourse it would have been great if you won and you should have won, however not everything goes as it should in life we just glad you back
come on now this is just tapped, why would you tell ur fans to send hate, and trash talk him as being a shit dad, which isn’t ur business. that’s just low, take the loss gracefully
Bro, take it like a man. The way you fought was very very sloppy. Take this moment and grow, and train your technique.
Lsi
This is the end result of surrounding yourself with yes men for too long, you lose touch with reality
do us all a fav stop trying to make eveything about yourself the whole world does not invored about u
true ones know that even though jj was robbed, he achieved what he wanted and showed all of the world that no matter where you come from, you can go far ❤
Honestly KSI this “loss” shouldn’t define you. Your true fans don’t care if u “loss” we love u dawg for who u r. We don’t care about the wins or loss we care about the person u have become. The hard working passionate person you are. We honestly love the way u r and don’t take u for granted
My man took skill issue to the next level💀
The world if you won: 🌎  The world even if you lost: 🌎. Nothing changes, just train a different mindset and come back up quick.
Ksi is back !!!   I think you should of one ksi
JJ... I love your videos and everything you do, hell I started watching the Sidemen because of you... But as of late, since you started boxing again, I have not enjoyed watching your videos at all even with the inconsistent uploads... You've become the very thing you said you would never become... You said you would always stay humble but if this is what humble means to you then you're gonna get your eyes opened one of these days.... Damn man, I enjoy watching the other boys alot more now... I almost clicked off this video because it was just you whining and whining about your loss and trying to bash Tommy just cause you're bitter about your loss... Please man, stop... STOP! You're better than this! Please!
Yea… this one didn’t hit Harassing ain’t cool man
Yeahhhhhhh we backkk
KSI legend
Obviously you did. Duh  Time to take a break and work on that hairline
The KSI meat-riding in the comment section is crazy
So many people in your echo chamber feeding your delusional ego.
Just to be clear I am a huge fan, but I can't believe I actually watched this till the end
Yo ma man its been a long time since you lost even if you got robbed but keep your head up bro
Sometimes youtubers grow THROUGH the videos they make. I dont blame him how hes responding to the fight here. It took a month to even come up with any words, so of course the first one will be with hurt hanging on to them. That L got him fked up, he trained so hard constantly and set up expectation of dominating. His perspective will most likely change as time goes on and be more humble. Remember gratitude and humbleness my guy were proud of how much youve accomplished and not just the wins.
We all know you won and you were robbed it’s more embarrassing for Tommy that he won something he didn’t deserve 🤣🤣
U GOT DONE MATE, UR POO
Quit living in the past
KSI died? oh no him lose oh ok  dat part
How is this not getting dislike bombed is beyond me. With this many likes, JJ is NEVER going to get the reality check he so deserves.
Yeah, no shit
Such a sore loser 😂😂😂, berating him bc u got humbled
I have been waiting so long for this video (but we all know you were robbed)
JJ, coming from a fan, be a man and stop being emotional. You lost, move on.
I agree, worst case scenario they should've said it's too close to call let's do a rematch, and given it a draw.
“Life isn’t fair” bro has the easiest life
Tommy saying stuff was just promotion. Like u saying u were gonna knock him out. What happened there? U lost. No good in harassing Tommy. U lost fair and square. If you really won the gap in points should have been bigger. Very sad to appeal judge’s decision.
How many adds do u want in this vid fack me
You lost bro, shut up and take that L.
legacy
Round 1 2 6 KSI 1 1 Point JJ Wins 57 56
7:05 I don’t think a person that has struggled with his own family drama of MANY years should comment on a man being a first time father
Bro broke u and owns u
Bruh, it isn't hard to outland somebody when you punch and hug them for 6 rounds. We could tell you were scared and just still can not box
no way people don't see how big of a moron JJ is
Tommy fury is a horrible fighter 😂
Bro I’m a fan but goddammn bro is a sore loser. Just move one. Don’t make a video telling us to harass the guy cuz he mad u sad
Cry baby
A whole ass month later and still this mf can’t accept the lost still talking shit about Tommy I’m glad the loss really humbled this man
I dont give a shit about anything that ksi does i love him and ill support anything that he does i have been watching him for like 10 years i feel like i have grew up with him lol
JJ bro u gotta just accept it like ur 30 years old and don’t know how to handle a loss
So many more people knew you lost. cry baby.
We love u man ...but it still itches .... everything was good when u started talking about his life ....i knew u r still not over it
Haven't seen the fight so I can't judge. But as an outsider this video seems like a massive cope. 😂 Either way your personal growth over the years is highly respectable and inspirational. 💪
I say a rematch
Was not prepared for this
Didn’t you pay/forced 16 year oldgirl to have abortion ?? Ur embarrassing man Just take it you lost
It seemed like there was an agenda to get JJ to finally have a Loss registered to his record. I think it was clear KSI won that fight, but it seems that the judges didn’t want that. Keep your head up JJ, your incredible work won’t go to waste
My G is crying about his loss after s month
You jumped around for 6 rounds and hugged him. Just admit that maybe this wasn’t your best performance, and move on with your life. This is going out sad.
grow up you lost a fight so have a millions of other people in the world😂
Telling your fans to harass the guy online and in real life only proves you deserved that L. You're 30 years old. Grow up.
Damn bro quit being a sore loser already. its been a lot of time bruh. Forget about it and dont be a baby.
Whats with the jumping jacks? It honestly was the most frustrating fight to watch man😅
the comments switched from "glad i didnt pay for the fight" and " it was a hugging competition" to sympathizing him after he posts a video...? weird
money might have changed him but he still the same nerdy insecure guy on the inside
JJ's fake laughing is so cringe.
Crazy to talk about parenting skills, when bro literally aborted one of his kids...bit mad innit🤔
L JJ
Tommy lost
Toxic
Tommy Furys legal team panicking rn
Love you JJ! Honestly I and probably a lot of others couldn't care less about the so called "loss" because we aren't here for anyone or anything else except you. Without you who would've kept us so entertained for all these years? Wether it was videos here on Youtube, music, boxing or the thousand other things you've done in the past 10+ years, it was always you, who kept us entertained and motivated us to keep pushing through no matter what we had ahead of us. YOU always were and always will be our reminder that anything is possible if you truly want it and put the work in. Thank you for everything you've done for us over the years and I can't wait to see all the things you have in store for us in the future. We love you JJ and always will ❤
That he says he needed time off is just fine but other than that. But other then that even though I am (was) a Fan, this video says a lot about your personality. I know it’s sort of a joke to say but I really do think Money really changes somebody in a very negative way and I think your portrayal of ego shows that pretty well.
Sure, you won. Now post something fun 👍🏼
Awhh, you poor thing, that's so unfortunate you didn't dominate like you claimed you were going to. That's just too bad. I know no one would dare say you were being egotistical and self-indulgent prior to the fight. Because, like you said, you WERE FOR A FACT GONNA KNOCK HIM OUT. But yeesh man thats just too bad you lost and didn't do anything you worked so hard for. That is so not fair . You are absolutely right. Those millions of dollars might as well be millions of pebbles because of the disgrace those boxing judges made you endure. The way you think you are superior to everyone around you is something i can only dream of doing one day. You are a true Testament to an ego being chased more than anything else
Love JJ, but you don't win fights by throwing an overhand right and initiating a clinch 🤷🏽‍♂️ Not a good look for KSI this video.
Second hand embarrassment watching this
How can someone support that 🤡, such a grow up child, throwing tantrum and obnoxious behavior, he is a sore looser. LSI
The win has definitely dropped the ego and brought the old KSI back
Don’t be telling people to harass him and his family. That’s just wrong. You should know better than that.
People's champion
KSI just hugged and didn´t want to fight, so please, you didn´t win, just run the whole fight.
This isn’t how you handle this JJ. Bringing Tommy’s kids into this and telling your fans to harass him in public is really low for you and can lead to dangerous things if the wrong person hears that message. You used to call people sore losers after they lost fights and now you’re just doing the same. Take the loss as a mistake in your head and move on to using it as motivation. No reason to keep dwelling on it and making you a more spiteful person. You’re better than this man, don’t let your ego take over
you've come so far and you have accomplished you goals. you have been inspiring me to do the same and hopefully I achieve my goals someday. I'm proud of u 😁
Hanging out with Logan Paul actually changed JJ. He literally turned into a twat, ngl. A loss is a loss. He lost his appeal as well, so now he did lose officially. But it gives him no right to suggest to a bunch of kids to go after Tommy Fury for winning. If you, little wankers, want to go at someone, it should be JJ, who didn't manage to win convincingly after talking all of the shit he's been talking, being, in the meantime, constantly dominated by Fury in every press conference and in every face off. JJ's ego is as big as UK and, while claiming to have a lot of self-confidence, he can't handle a simple loss. Grow up.
Can’t take an L
So insecure 😂
PAIN BUILDS CHARACTER
he hast to keep his guard up when boxing
Lol this is pathetic😂
Did the guy, who just bought a 10 million pound house and gets chauffeured around the country in an S Class, say life isn't fair.
It took you 1 month to do this vod
I’ve been watching you sense I was probably11-12 being 19 now and growing with you seeing you lose like that and coming back bro you inspire me and I got so much respect for your soul keep doing this shut you amaze me
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ you deserve a break!
Bro you had a point deduction in favor and you still lost lol, don’t put excuses
Bro finally posted after the lose🎉
as long as you’re good bro & we’re glad to see you back🫂
Dude, a 54 year old Roy Jones Jr is STILL Roy Jones Jr. I mean, Mike Tyson wanted to fight him because he's still Roy F**KING Jones Jr.
You fought like shit mate, it was bad to watch. Take the loss like a man and move on
you lost bro get over it its pretty simple
i just see the 'berate' comments everywhere ,literally not even a big deal if jj said that. everyone's out here acting like jj asked his fanbase to kill tommy in a way.....this is coming from a Jake Paul fan as well
JJ. You lost the fight. Bro you have to get over it
Agreeing with most of the comments down here. I agree with you, the fight should've been yours, but other than through the official ways, you should not just claim your opponent lost unless you've actually won something. Take the L with class and go on, you've got strength, talent and ability, so the W will just come in due time.  asking fans to berate your opp, no matter who they are, is just a little-man move.
When are u doing botox?
the respect i have for this guy...... TOP TIER....
JJ you’re not helping yourself with this, the younger fans are already annoying without you telling them to go after Tommy. Coming from one of your older fans, just stop 😅 The ones really don’t make us look good.
The integrity in knowledge, strength and integrity after he loses once:
I'll probably still a fan after all of this, but I don't think this is the best path to take, feels like you'll just lose more than gain from any of this.
Health is the first! It's time to heal ourselves ❤
If you cant tank the L you dont deserve the W
Brother as a true fan of you as a content creator since the Road to D1 days, just accept you lost… in your head you think you are the best at boxing but it’s time to come down to reality. We still like you even when you lose, but these attitudes… come on
Ngl chill with the edits. Especially in the beginning
https://youtu.be/rMS_fymeV6Q?si=K-pnphpamqtiowWt hahahahahha
Love ya bud. Seeya soon❤
Rather u get back to being u instead of boxing anyway
How are yall saying I love ksi but he still on the same topic crying about a fight that happened almost 2 months ago in where he clearly lost he can't box at all even say papi would whoop him
It was a boxing match not a star jump match.
Yeah this aint the mindset to have after you lose.
Mong
As much as anyone may think jj won the fight why does this mean tommy has to hear it under every post of his , it isn’t his fault the judges gave it his way , it’s childish from jj to want his fans to keep nagging him about it
This is not it bro. I'm a huge fan of yours since almost 10 years now... but you're kinda of a sore loser in this video. Still much love for you. But this is not it.
bro worked for 6 year straight my dad worked for 35years straight
"So.. I lost?" Yes. You lost.
Legend FR <3
bro just admit it u lost stop being a salty sore loser lmao all the boxing true pros know that tommy won. even daley said it and bugzy malone also thought so. people need to stop riding the bandwagon and actually see who won objectively and there is only one answer which is tommy. so suck it up and move on. u lost and jake is better anyway so no point crying now.
I think anyone who has watched you before 2016 will be proud of what you’ve done. The fact the opportunities even opened up in the first place to the same nerd that played games in his room is impressive enough.
Goofy ah nga
Go watch your oldest videos and realize how upgraded you’ve become broski
Sorry JJ, but a huge L on your end mate. Telling your overzealous fanbase who would do anything for you, to clown and berate Tommy online as well as in REAL LIFE is a real low! Disappointing to see ngl
As long as u beat Logan as a fan I'm satisfied. A win is a win .
Love youuu❤❤
As a wise man once said, being a sore loser is even worse than being a loser
Man sometimes its so hard to support this dude.. bro you are fucking 30 act like it Absolute man child
I am sorry for the judges but also cant blame them for doing their job. I'd say the fight way enjoyable either way (because fk perfornance, legit just for the heartless) and had fun watching it. Im happy you took a Break right after a major blow instead of lashing out on it, im also kinda happy that you saw what a Loss feels like (kinda because it was too big of a Loss tbh. Small losses on sidemen is enough and even tho you act on sidemen, it is clear that it hurts sometimes and i respect your work GREATLY) but the thing im most happy about is that you IN PERSON can back down and show that giving up isnt losing, which is the ONLY WAY to get stronger. Keep it up, warrior ✊!
'Everything in his favour' KSI even believes his own lies 🤣
Ksi you kinda asking people to harass Tommy fury in public and online, that’s kinda fucked up.
king
It was a bad fight, i know you didn't do enough to win, so didn't tommy, draw at best, but the way you're speaking about winning sounds pechulent and winning like a baby, grow some balls take the L and come back stronger, thats what you should be doing, I've been watching you for a long time,  this time   I'm going to desegree
The falloff is real to real.
Bringing a mans personal life into it after losing to.him.(weather you agree with the decision or not) just comes of terribly telling your fans to berate him is shocking even your reaction after the fight throwing a tantrum you preach your hard work but really your just a big kid who doesnt like it when things dont go his way
Honestly I believe you tied, I could see how you could have won it but it is what it is.
Loser
You lost.
😂😂😂.
We just want to see you happy with the sidemen your friends ❤❤
No matter what you think of him, from the outside looking in JJ is the hardest grafter in the scene. With all the things hes involved with, with youtube, prime, boxing, music, misfits along with all the other sidemen brads etc man has a crazy work ethic fair play to him
🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱
Lil bro still cant go to sleep without thinking about tommy fury 😂
I miss you bro😉
I love seeing someone lose so badly, they can't move on like his other opponents. Real mature for a 30 year old...
you lost 😂😂🤣🤣
Yes, yes you did 😂
love you JJ regardless
Man took the loss and is losing some more. Literally stopped watching you guys when you guys started to think you were kings. Making fans pay for porn and shit on people who pay for OF, all of you are hypocrites. Get mad when someone slays a self called ‘king’ when you’re truly just some guy who got lucky and made and now is exploiting the same thing they called shit years ago. It’s truly astonishing how far and you’ve come and fallen.
Excuses, Excuses, Excuses... still cant accept he lost, telling people to attack him onlone. So pathetic. Grown ass child
I mean JJ  you won against tommy as a youtuber I mean tommy is lucky that you didnt train for 1 more year because he would have been destoyed
Where’s the “laughing at ksi” video
bro dont become ConnorMcGregor, just move on, it doesnt really matter
You’re a legend jj thank you for everything
I swear to god seeing this man who is a millionaire and still grinds way more than most of us is just an Inspiration
So he waits a month, you'd think he'd reflect and grow up a bit. But still refusing to admit he lost and telling people to attack Tommy online. He is a grown child, who cant accept things. Pathetic idiot
Hey look we all take Ls eventually you handled it well and have a positive response to it so don't let it hang over your head mate take care
I thought KSI won, but regardless, this shows that he is capable of beating jake paul. Not long ago, a lot of people acted like KSI had no chance vs Jake. Now, nobody knows. Well, I know. KSI would slump jake paul.
Bro, you lost. Get over it. You keep crying and it’s not gonna change it lol
❤❤❤❤
Honestly the video came out to late for people to make jokes about you lol
I get the video is to spark the notion of another fight, and to get a bite from Tommy, but like... I don't think anyone cares really, that's why they all watch totally legal streaming services.
Doesn't matter if you lost, I still look up to you, and still believe in you. I also wanted to ask whether you can post a sparring footage so people can actually see how good you are, probably outside the london shootfighter gym becuase, of their rules.
Nah going after his family is LOW. He's living in KSI's mind
You lost.. Man up and move on, no need of excuses.. Unless you want hug..Or hugss
Didn’t lose in 9/10 peoples opinion
So he’s not gonna mention him kicking a TV screen like a child?
Tommy won, cope more. Don’t attack him as a parent.
Oh shut up already. You want a bo'tle of wa'er
I thought i was gonna see a good vid , but it turned out to be an ego vid , well ig tommy hasn't knocked out his fat ego so lets hope jake will do it
You won jj we all know that 🙌🏼🙌🏼
it's seriously not about the fight...you tried and you are satisfied with yourself. that's All it must be.
I never lose didn't age well............bruhh😂😂
You didn’t get your hand raised, let it go, learn from it & move on, you should never leave the fight in the ref’s hands anyway. This sounds cringe man, be a man, take the loss & comeback stronger. Maybe hire boxing coaches who’s not yes men 🤷🏾‍♂️
Banna u was taking real breaks from 2017 to 2023
We don't care JJ we here to Support and hope to see u back in the Ring
Look ksi you did what exactly swarmz did against you running around the whole ring. Fury did throw many illegal punches but his points were deducted right. It wasn't that the referee didn't penalize fury for it. That doesn't mean you deserve to win the match. It should've been a draw because both of you didn't deliver your best in that ring.
Look I got nun but respect for jj and his work ethic but u lost tht fight it was a shit show
So many ppl thought u won? No lol u lost bruv
Man’s has no accountability he’s like a toxic ex
JJ ur better than this……😢
You reduced tommy fury to a youtube fighter, consider yourself a success for having a controversial loss, it speaks volumes compared to what people were predicting
This shit is chalked bro I don’t even care bout yt boxing but damn this shit is boring now end it all fight Jake we not gonna care in 2024
You should think twice before criticising a father for focusing on working and providing for his daughter. Not everyone can afford the luxury of staying home all day making millions off of reacting to Reddit and starting a business with a scammer.
Welcome back bro❤
The fact you got THAT close vs a guy thats been doing it a long while says how bad Tony truly was lmfao
You hit Tommy at the back of the head probably as much as he did. You should have got points deducted. As for the winner, too boring to watch.
Keep hugging you melt
You lost, get over it
L
Sore loser, just accept the defeat and move on
I’ve been watching KSI for so long but it is hard to watch what he has become. Honestly i think he is really a good person but. But these past few years with his boxing career etc.. It feels he surrounded himself with yes man. I do compete in amateur and for him to boast how he improved and came back with the same technique no footwork just hail makers. And it’s always the same thing he uses “Oh i’m just youtuber doing boxing” as excuse but then he switches “ Haha youtuber just beat you” is so shameless in so many ways. Hey I get it game is the game but I thought KSI would have some morals if you are competing in PROFESSIONAL stop bringing you are a youtuber and your past to that argument. Connor Mcgregor never laugh at anyone that they got beaten up by a plumber that’s not what this is about.  Also mentioning Tommy punching back of his head is so petty considering how many times KSI did that in that fight and didn’t mention it and all over his career as well. I think KSI shouldnt compete not because he doesn’t got power but it’s dangerous for the others. He doesn’t qualify as a boxer with his technique. The fact that he is crying over the back of his head which Furry got deducted for so i don’t get why he is mentioning it cuz it got punished despite he got away with his. He fight before that elbowed someone which is very serious he pass it off as nothing happened and i’m telling you if you are in clinch you are probably not that tense and don’t expect a hard blow into your chin. Unexpected hit is way more dangerous than expected one and strong at that.
ksi man.. just move on man , tommy deep down knows wtf happened in the ring , you don't need to belittle yourself by ''proving'' to the world or to tommy that you won , everybody knows wtf happened. Even if you CLEARLY lost the match which you haven't , the fact that you went against a fury in a boxing match is spectacular achievement by itself . Be proud of yourself and move on to bigger and better things. Peace out
ksi be like "Guys yeah i lost but look  he dances funny"😂 no hate
wtf was that. I don't care how long i been watching ur videos I aint gonna say or do nothing to some stranger cuz u encouraged me to, bruh whats happening man
0:00-4:00 just excuses
Bro Tommy won what are you talking about he beat u physically and mentally if your old self could see u, he would of clowned you
Lmaooooo Jake Paul own you.
You lost and cried about it and now lost the appeal and now look worse than jake lol
You keep talking about "legacy" and setting the right example and you are doing this. This is going to be your legacy, 30 years old and still acting like a child telling your fans to attack someone . Money can't buy class. 🤡🤡
Ultimately it doesnt matter if you win or lose you got in the ring and did work that's more than most people can do
Proud of u JJ
you took this long to post a vid shittin on tommy? this comin off so salty
Yes. Not even bothering to watch the vid. Train harder and be actually better. Stay focused and stop crying
Super proud of you JJ ❤🐐
grow up
I used to watch KSI a lot but slowed down past couple of years. I gotta say, you are a sore loser. You tried your best, everyone knows you did, if the outcome was not what you wanted that's fine, life goes on. You are still KSI. No need to go after Tommy's personal life, you dont know the details of his life, only Tommy himself does and even if some of it is true then you shouldn't have to go down to that level (especially telling your fans to berate his socials), it seems very low of you to do so and its disappointing to see that. Makes you look worse than the performance you pulled in that fight. Your ego was soo high and I can see why but damn I guess this was a wake up call and hopefully in the next fight you are a more humble fighter, win or lose.
If you ever see the backlash, don’t make a video saying you made a mistake, we already know you did.
You tried ur best bro
Why do you even care u lost, u fight under misfits ur not a real boxer and will never be in rankings for an actual belt like wbc.. makes no difference u lost to anything
Hard watch this JJ. Long time fan of yours but try show some integrity and accept that you lost. The fight was a whole month ago now and you’re still gunning for Tommy. Show a little respect to him and yourself and move on, you’re better than this mate.
embarassing
Well you lost 💀
Did his appeal get rejected?
Atleast you are in shape now 😂, just kidding
The lack of sportsmanship and respect is just wild
Burnout is a thing, if you truly wanted YOU could take time off to reflect on your accomplishments. Think of all the things you have learned about people and arts. Hang in there man, and enjoy yourself. Influencers deal with all the drama and BS but its time for a real vacation and some you time.
december just brings them back lol
The fact that he really believes he won its very delusional and very embarrassing
Allow it fam, you lost 😂😂😂
Heres a 9 minutes and 13 seconds video tutorial on how to be a sore loser.
These "true supporters" would still side with jj even if he beat up a disable person for no reason. Here we see a man with God complex forced to face reality and lose still trying to stroke his huge ego. The "real fans" don't understand that he's in it for the fame and money. He lost and it hurt his ego and reputation hence the video. Unfortunately jj understands that his fans are 9y olds and they will support his no matter what hence even though Prime being such a bad product none of his fans care and he still makes loads of money from it, well them.
Mate let it go 😂
Your growth arc isn’t finished yet my man. You’ve come so far and you’re not even half way. Keep it up, chin up and know we’re all going to be here through and through.
JJ, you lost lad. Hold your chin up though you did better than the majority of people expected, but you looked so messy and un organised in there, the constant hugging, circle out, throw one punch, hug routine is awful to watch and has never been a good tactic to win the judges favour or any fans. And the fact you're so salty about losing a fight to a younger man, that your asking your fans to do your dirty work and go after him is embarrassing
I Dont Care  My Fav Youtuber Win Or Lose You are Still The Best I Just Love The Way You Laugh Love Your Work Keep Up The Good Work ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
L
Bro just came back from the sleepover
Stop whining... When will you come to India and when is prime coming to India
Ksi shut upp you lost by just hugging and avoid real fighting and tommy did his job so show respect and eccept it come on grow upp
JP hade much better chance to win agains Tommy Furry he still lost he even KO him still lost, Tommy agains JJ was close call but I dont see Tommy did any thing spacial to win, I thing both JJ and JP should win agains Tommy
no one cares that you lost to a pro boxer, like you said it was all in his favour. stop stressing and trying to prove to people how cool you are, a loss is a loss deal with it stop whining about it being rigged when its your event. im not looking at this thinking hes the true winner im thinking hes a sore loser
Legend just a legend
Ksi the hugger
You went toe to toe with a bro boxer with pro boxer barely landing any punches that's a W
KSI Won
Who cares you lost we don't it's u are the real goat of YouTube we love u u inspired all of uss we don't care we already forget about fight ❤❤
Tommy broke you mentally and physically.
Brother shows his true colors. I'm unsubbing
Yo, why did JJ say that he was at that Weakest Link Sidemen video and in the same time there was a footage of Folabi? Are they the same person? :////
Only children think KSI won. Watch the fight, KSI just did star jumps, threw a wild punch, missed, then clinched... KSI was trash.
Just don't do the Jake Paul fight end it at this
Bruh you lost man just take the punch and move on and dont ask you're fans to fight you're battles
The Fury's do dirty business, robbed Ngannou weeks later.
tbh, watching the fight back, you performed so well based on your history and he performed so bad based on his as well. At worse, it should have been a draw and at best it should have been a draw as well. Him winning is bad af but listen, you should not care about that at all ! MOVE ON BRO ! You achieved great things and you should be proud of yourself and not care about the outcome, a loss is not something you tattoo on your back nor a win, you fought him and you showed your guts and he showed his, and he didn't dominate like he said he was going to and you did exactly what you said you were going to do and you landed clean hits and boxed really well. But move on ! Don't stay on this, move forward for your own good.
u definitly won bro
KSI vs Jake Paul..plz?
Bro moving like Joe Weller
https://youtube.com/@Loadingv6?si=H-xwh2858BhNqi1k
Happy for ksi but he doesn’t really have the right to question his fathering when he’s got no right
Honestly bro, for my you lost the fight… who cares? YOU ARE THE BEST FIGHTER OF YOUTUBE… Just get back up, and don’t not spread hatred, just move on…
L
Personally I think you paid people off to say that you won when you didn’t, that way it’s a win win situation. Tommy didn’t lose so he can continue in his boxing career and you’re made out to look like you won so you’re technically still on top
JJ can u post more on youtube plz🙏🏼
GG,But Tommy took it 🙌
Bro made a video with complete honest context. Respect.
Ksi 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐❤️❤️❤️❤️
. KSI , YOU ARE THE GOAT 🤟🏾
ig Its time for KSI to get a girl and marry and settle down
Bro is literally a child
Now that the “if I beat Tommy, no reason to fight Jake” is out the window… KSI is scared af to lose again, especially to Jake Paul lol.  That’s going to be one hell of a fight if it ever happens.
This is really rough. For shame.
we're there with you no matter what🖤
KSI!! I’ve been watching you since 2012. I know you won’t read this but bro.. take this loss. We want to see you grow from the loss, that’s the best way to get your final form💪🏽💪🏽
And this is what a broken man looks like.
You know.. it’s coo you brought us a long way to the top🥲
lol
KSI big ups
It's alright king, keep ya head up❤️‍🔥
star jumps dont win
We love you JJ
Did not see this coming
New editing style ?
u didn't improve as a fighter in the fight, tommy did win the fight imo pretty clearly and at best a draw.
I dang near forgot this happen lmao .
Wins and losses happen jj. It's all good
Bro….what’s up with the second half of the video..
Yes, we care more about the journey you craved rather than the loss you took from a boxing match. We appreciate the bigger picture
Ready for JJ's baby arc
awww keep crying weasel
So you lost go and cry 😂 LSI 😂😂
Yeah this is not the way to go about your loss mate. It just isn't. Leave that man, his girl and kid alone and focus on you. Accept the loss, it won't change. Have it teach you something and grow from it and just do you. Imagine Tommy calling out his fans to harass Yinka or something? That's just dumb JJ. Support will always be here, but make sure you actually learn, grow and develop from your time off.
judges were on crack when they were scoring that fight and jj (shave the pubes off your face)
bro still crying like a child
Its a draw and tommy fury got lucky and doesnt matter u tried and u won dont care about the judges
This is the biggest cope
KSI you are a good singer  and a good YouTuber and also maybe a good boxer but you're a shit actor. Stop doing that fake laughs and actually cheer up. Tommy fury is ass no one cares about him. All we care about is you. It's your legacy and wouldn't it be boring if no one ever tried to put you down?
The real fans know you won!
You know that tommy fury is tyson furys brother right....  You lost to the brother of one of the best heavyweight champion in the world, while being a youtuber....   It's crazy you reacted that bad.   Things were great you spoiled it by over reacting
Now yall saying he lost? Wtf. Just watching the fight u can see ksi win without the point deduction. So with the point deduction it shouldnt even be a question. If u feel like u were obviously robbered of a fight u know for a fact u won then their is no winning. You voice ur opionion and people think ur a sore loser. Dont say shit and you let them roll over u.
can we change the name to SLC or something now?  Sore Loser Crybaby or whatever what's this personal attacks on tommy fury? like to think jake paul of all people handled a L way way better than KSI is just crazy
Sore loser end of
You had no highlights in that fight bro
Ego has swallowed him whole
"Says a lot about your legacy" interesting choice of words... You reaction to losing this fight, and you did lose, says a lot about yours. If you can't get your way or something isn't to your satisfaction then you throw your toys out the pram. Grow up. You're 30, mate, act like it
I never understood this concept of “oh I’m just a YouTuber” what’s a YouTuber? It’s just a person who uploads videos to YouTube, mate you’ve been boxing for over 5 years and had “professional” fights. You can’t use the oh I’m just a YouTuber excuse cause it doesn’t mean anything, and also you knew Tommy’s boxing background when you took this fight so saying it’s embarrassing for Tommy cause he’s been training his whole life is nonsense due to the fact that once you get in the ring your only objective is to win rather than to “embarrass” your opponent. Discussing what Tommy does in his personal life and telling your fans to belittle  him in public is beyond cringe G your 30 years old learn to take a L and grow and y’all needa stop being yesmen cause y’all be acting like he wasn’t hugging bro the whole match 😂
He really became what he hated
Bad loser, you hugged throughout, did some star jumps, and threw a few haymakers, was the most boring fight ever yet you still believe you had a great fight. You need to learn to fight properly 👍
I can lose
Oh THIS VIDEO WONT AGE WELL.
I’ve followed this nerd since his tiny room days 😂 never stopped supporting him but bro telling us to harass the man ain’t it 😅😂
bapak loser ko ni adoi
who remembers  "JAKE PAUL TRASH, TIOMMY FURY TRASH" 😭
Yapster at work
Brother i follow you since the beginning and im happy you take a step back just to get more energy.  Keep it calm we will be there for you ❤
Cope
.                                                                                    .                                                                                                                .                                                                                            .
Deplorable behaviour. Bringing up Tommy Fury's family, calling for fans to harass him, why on earth does KSI think any of that is a good idea?
This is the pettiest video I've ever seen. Wasteman
I can't see such a great guy like JJ become anymore of an egomaniac, it's just painful, man. I'm just gonna unsubscribe. Peace ✌️
he is broken
Yeah, and we don’t care, get over it and move on
Spent all fight hugging and over reacting on the back of the head shots trying to BS a point deduction. He's not a true competitor....
lol this response is wack asf bro got deep and personal with it rather then just taking it, big ass L 😭
stop lying yourself and accept loss ,,its the only way to move forward ,,you lost that fight i watched it several times and count points ,,you lost that fight even if at first look it lookes you won ,,you didnt,,and saying it doesnt make sense to you ,,only making things worse,,,you lost on points fair
KSI literally hugged him the entire time
Yes YOU LOST AND IT FEELS SO GOOD HAHAAHAHAHHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
Hugger thinks he won 😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉
Tommy if he's a true fighter will be annoyed by all of the doubters and hate to offer a rematch to settle it once and for all. Ksi shouldn't be asking people to berate him especially now he has a child under his care. Fans get out of hand and are unpredictable so Tommys child is at risk now youve said that. I think you won the fight but you can't do a sniperwolf (similar sort of thing although not revealing his address). You're asking for people to let him know he lost which can have a negative impact on his family and also you. I think because of this video it will backfire in favour of Tommy.  Sometimes shiff happens. Tyson Fury lost his fight against Ngannou in my opinion which just shows how judges decisions go.  Blood sweat and tears show with your frustration but you need to open your eyes JJ that we're in the age of snowflakes and theres always someone out there that is unhinged and could do something stupid. Think carefully about his family and the side effects.
L after L after L for Ksi
Love jj your a king we all know the result fuck Tommy he’s life will fall apart with out molly in it she’s the big name not him Tyson makes him walk at the back off the fury family cos his embarrassment to the fury name that he couldn’t KO to YouTubes up the YouTube uk family were fucking massive and can’t be topped!!!!!!!
KSI VS LOGAN PAUL 2, KSI receives a deduction point and Won The Fight. btw JJ you also landed tommy in the back of the head but the difference was tommy didnt complain. Also, you in many of your fights punched your opponents in the back of their head and didnt receive a deduction point.
Its so sad, this guy is a grown man btw, how many excuses you are going to make. Keep Hugging :)
JJ you beat Logan Paul by a deduction point so that means Logan was robbed? No, because you boxed better & that's the reason why tommy won, he came to boxed & not like you were you throwed 2 shots and then hide and grabbed tommy.   If you think you won by a deduction point then you lost to logan paul in the rematch because you also received a deduction point.  If we are talking who tried to box it was tommy, you lost mate but cheer up.
Stop Crying and make sure you never lose again! Turn losses into lessons
bro your fight doesnt we love you brudah and we will always support you jj
First time I disliked a ksi video
I knew it, if it got overturned and he won that’s how he was gonna come back laughing, what a joke, couldn’t firm the decision
Telling your young impressionable fans to go publicly berate Tommy Fury sure seems like a fantastic way to get a bunch of kids weighed in by a group of travellers.  Think about what your promoting with these kind of statements
this loss is a W in disguise
So that boxer you knocked out with your elbow won ?
The editing is clapped
he finally uploaded
Yoo JJ I think you need to try not to laugh with your gf
KING🫡👌🏻
.                             .
its so immature move ksi, grow up
Hug some more people 🐈
You didn't pay the referee enough
honestly JJ, you’re such a sore loser. You lost, nearly 2 months ago and you’re still talking about Tommy and attacking his personal life. Grow the hell up and just move on with your life, it’s pathetic that you as a 30 year old man is still whining and telling your fans to harass Tommy in public because you can’t just accept the loss. Push past this and move on, come back better and show the world what you were meant to do.
Life Is fair. I've been here for 9 years and I've come to like you, i rly do, but it's not because you're ksi that life is gonna go your way. not even here to insult. you ain't God, on any subject so, lose, learn, and get better.
Bro knew he would not win in the back of his mind because why else would he tweet "it's time to shock the world"😂😂😂😂
Bro man im unsubscribing for ever. This is it, judging parenting, telling your fans shit. You my friend have fallen. Egotistical maniac
Got nothing but love and respect for this man….a true inspiration to everyone who knows him or knows about him 🖤head up bro yk you won that fight
Hope the appeal comes though love you man
We don't care about the loss jj. We need new try not to laugh vedios.
ksi is that crazy ex that never gets over getting dumped
ly
yes you lost
You can't always win sometimes you gotta lose
So this is what video YouTubers make when they lose a boxing match.
12 months ago I was on the brink of working at Mcdonald's, I took JJ as my inspiration and after a tough year, I've taken a huge risk to interview for my dream job tomorrow. From once a geeky little virgin to another, thank you.
Lolllll you lost stop crying and get over it
Can we just take a moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into his videos.
Oh stop it...... u kept hugging that's y u loss😂
honestly i was expecting this video to be about his future plans or something since he uploaded like after 6 weeks, not to still talk about the loss and attacking tommy's personal life.
You lost, accept it, stop with the excuses
you didnt win
Man child still crying
KSI didn't lose the fight, but he definitely didn't win. He says he trained for hard, and thats all he's got to show for it ? Fair play for getting into the ring with Fury. Neither fighters looked good.
Point deduction, hit in the back of the head. How the tables turn, just stop crying already you sore loser! Learnt nothing
PBA needs to overturn that shit. I need my money
we love you jj , dont let that loss get u , keeep uploading videos and we are here for u my G
such a bad loser
It was more than fair, stop crying already bro
This is the boxing 🥊 world 🌎, sometimes you win and You loose. You’re not the only one who has felt this. You just got to pick your self up and move on. 💥💥
This is just sad. Going after Tommy’s wife and kid. Telling his fans to berate him. He should delete this video and maybe go on another break. Think about what he’s saying. It’s fine to clown Tommy a little bit about the dancing with Chris brown but to go after his family and telling your fans to harass him is just plain sad. Your 30 years old man.
disgusting bro
hahahaha loser
Such a cry baby - mans 30 years old😂 am a KSI fan but doesn’t make him look great - think he’s upset he has to fight Jake now😂
Could’ve acknowledged how Poor his own performance was
no way ppl rly think jj lost
Got whooped
Lmao he now going to go personal with it cause he hates crying and being a sore loser
only your meat gobblers thought you won
KSI THE FOAT!
Talking about his kid and telling your fans to harass him is disgusting.
Cool story bro.. but you still lost
Honestly, no one deserved to win that fight. Disgraceful performance from both fighters. You deserve this L, and Timmy will get his soon
No 6 0 That Fight Wasn’t 58 56 With No Point deduction
Right well now can we cut the boxing thing and just be a YOUTUBER.
The fatneek is coming back. He is bulking up like crazy. Look at his face
KSI's performance shows that he'll beat Jake with ease.
dont care, more try not to laughs and among us on moresidemen pls i beg
I forgot about that terrible event 😂😂😂😂😂    So Long ago
Oh god. As. KSI fan. It hurts to see what he has become.  This is tragic.  Going after tommy’s wife, kid, telling his HUGE fan base to berate him in internet and social media.  I hated jake, but even he. He was not this disgraceful in defeat.  Utterly tragic.
My man is coping hard
Yeah man, ur definitely “over it”, he says while asking his viewers to harass Tommy in comments.
Should have came up humbled. Showing up after months of not speaking then saying "I should have won" it just shows you have no personality and no backbone. Honestly jj I'm disappointed in how you're speaking about this situation. Even if it wasn't fair you should have played it better.
I'm a realist and i say: You lost. I saw the fight. It was so much hugging.  I was interested in the first half until the marathon hugging began. I skipped to the end. I was super excited to see what you could do,  but it only shined for a couple minutes. I agree with the hard work portion, however, there is no point in putting in hard work if your just going to do the miniumum.  Take this message as constructive.
Sit down little man, take the L and move on like a man.
LSI
KSI has officially lost the plot
You became crazy. Telling your fans to harass the guy who beat you damn
No shit we know you lost
You need stoicism.
Wasnt the points set wrong ??
Well he lost and played the 'a youtuber who has been boxing for 3 years' And if he did won he would have played 'a youtuber who has been boxing for 3 years'
Broo ... we'll be your fans to death
Bro. Dont take this to ur heart and leave this. We need the old ksi back dude. Dont make this get under ur skin. U have been an inspiration for me ever since. I cant see u not able to take an l. Love u man.
You definitely deserved to win that fight, we all know deep down u won❤️all that hard work u put in just to lose is tough. #TeamKsi❤
Lets be honest guys, Real reason of posting? Running out of money or some shi
KSI i love you bro but you gotta move on. We all take L's here and there but you gotta overcome that and come back stronger. Happy to see you back tho 🤙
Lots of hugs jj..keep growing
I genuinely wonder if he thinks it was only he who worked so hard. I'm sure Tommy put in a lot of work as well for this fight. Also he's become a sore loser.
Your last video made me laugh when I first saw it.. now it’s even funnier 😂
love u jj
get over it ....we know it takes time jj<3
goood job taking the L......
❤
JJ you know nothing about Tommy and Mollys life. Don't judge or talk things you don't know about. You lost, deal with it, come back stronger. While you're at it, get some people in your life who actually challenge you, not just "yes" men
only youtuber that i regard as an inspiration after all the things he’s been thru and the hard work he’s put in. Lots of respect and you inspire me to do great things too JJ ❤
You changed JJ
All humans need a break, brother you’ve been killing it with videos and fights, hope u had enough time to relax g!
So now, Ksi's encouraging his fans to publicly harass people he doesn't like? Wow
JJ WON THE FIGHT💯💯
Honestly felt like u should have won
You lost overcome that and come back bigger and stronger
Pathetic
Bro don’t even stress bout the loss, just look at the journey yg besides u got fighters sayin u won. N remember doe even if ur haters wanna talk shit bout the loss let em talk cuz they ain’t gonna hop in the ring or do what u do so until then what they say don’t mean shit they lookin for relevance in they meaningless life u been killin it bro💯💯
Win or lose, we still love you mate ❤️ Keep doing you JJ
He turned into what he mocked, its easy to be a gracious winner. This loss showed that your ego has gone too far and you’re a sore loser. Grow up, you’re a 30 year old man.
Wait this means we get baldski right????!!!!!!
Who cares about judges' decision we know that you won from that lil b*tch
❤❤❤
"Go harrass Tommy online" "You're bad at parenting" "I didnt lose even tho I did" Man I hope Reddit humbles him. This man's still coping
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
you Lose or whatever Happen , we are fan of you nothing can change youre best ...... Take Game As Game
🤡
Take the L, you cheated with an elbow in a previous fight and didn't complain did you?
what a big forhead now i understand the bandana and no one think you won the fight
So where is the fight against Jake?
I can understand if you think that you should of won the fight and I even support you a bit there but throwing hate and actively telling your fans to go to Tommy’s socials and criticise him/give him hate is a dick move
This dude is so one sided omfg.  You fell off bro
Hahahahha Lmao how the table turns. 4 years ago u clowned Logan for basically doing the same video and sayin the same things. But now when u lost, are u not the sore loser?💀
Just take the l bro there's no shame in losing
KSI is really salty with how petty and spiteful he is being talking about Tommy's legacy, family and how people should basically bully him, still the same ego maniac.
Jake "Yeah I lost that's fair I'll work very hard next time it wont happen again" KSI "I cried and I got mad and sad and I screamed"
You defo won, even the undefeated undisputed peoples champ world champ greatest of all time Chael Sonnen said so
did you kiss your mom properly in dhubai
Please do a live for the GTA 6 TRAILER
Well deserved loss.
Judges got graduation at McDonald's
What'up boi!! Glad you are back
Thankyou for the amazing content this year❤️ Glad to have you back❤️
Whether you won or lost doesn't matter me, been a long-time follower since day 1. However, you said the decision from the PBA is taking ages, but they declined your appeal on the 1st December? So it's already been decided? Am I missing something?
Stand proud...  You are strong
KSI you also did the samething htting Fury behind his head, now shut up, take the Loss, move on..!!!
should have taken a longer break hes clearly not over this
Except ya loss and move on. This is why you are not a Real boxer.
I’m so proud
😂😂😂😂😂😂
NAH BRO U WON JJ IT DOSENT MATTER U WILL ALWAYS WIN NO MATTER WHAT AND WE ALL LOVE U AND U WON NO MATTER WHAT ❤️❤️
Damn, telling your fans to troll someone online and offline. Bro dealing with the side effects of Copium
Jj wtf are you doing man this behaviour is disappointing. Someone ive looked up to for a while and someone ive been a fan of since 2013 and now your attacking someknes personal life and telling fans to go harrass tommy on social media n whatnot. Some people your/hes working with are a bad influence  Ive been waiting for jj to upload been missing his content was so happy to finally see the notification and this is how it goes. Such a shit feeling
Take that question mark out of the title mate 😂
2:26 dude you hit him as well, hell have you forgotten about pineda LMAO
Thank you for your hard work JJ. We know you do a lot because of us and hopefully everything you’re doing is making you happy as well. That’s what’s most important.
I get its a joke but prompting people to hate on tommy fury is kinda low😂
ksi GROW TF UP
Imagine asking your fans to harass another guy wtf
ahaha finally our fat neek gets humbled
Still cant believe this guy is my top artist on wrapped
Jake Paul’s tweet was very neutral. You lost and still can’t get humbled bro.
I’m a big KSI supporter but man just accept it bro. He should have been eating something w the amount of salt this videos has.
Hitting you back of the because that was your plan. You don’t go to a fight and rely on them fouling.
Over hand hug repeat was definitely not the best strategy either my friend 😭
Professional hugger lol
KSI the art of winning: How to win a fight without fighting
Ksi your a legend weather you won or lost it doesn’t matter you are always a winner in the whole worlds eyes ❤we are all proud of how much you have accomplished and achieved through out these years you should be extremely proud of yourself your story is really inspiring and we appreciate you posting❤🔥❤️‍🔥🫡
Good to see you my G
Bro ive been watching and supporting you for YEARS. And I’ve never been let down by you until now… not bc u lost the fight. But bc ur being a lame sore loser rn. “Everyone go comment on his ig that he lost bla bla”. Cmon bro. Accept the loss. U were never a boxer
Grow up jj
You didn’t loose
Thanks jj, i needed some salt for my dinner
this a self promo video?
That same illegal hit, if like what has Colon how he is.   SMH
I love this guy
Lets all watch real boxing now. N be done with this shit 🙃
The irony of KSI doing the exact same thing he was laughing at Logan Paul for doing when he lost 🤦‍♂️ even if the appeal goes through, he fought terribly. Hardly showcasing any ‘skills’. I like this guy but come on 😂
Hi JJ, just here to remind you that you lost tommy 😃
Technically only 2 random dudes thought u lost
whomp whomp
Ksi the goat though
Still a sore loser after all this time to think?
It's possible for judges to be racists. They don't have to say it
I mean u won by hugging him though. Like no one truly won .. Tommy Fury is a disgrace to boxing & KSI is champion of hugging
Ngl everything was fine but you shouldn't have attacked him abt his personal life saying you are a father  or only the mother is taking care of the kid(until and unless he has gone personal) it was a poor move man
30 years of age btw
You did not lose ksi. But either way.. I liked to see you guys fight.
very nice video
I love u JJ. Your one & only fans from Indonesia since 2015❤
i even forget about the fight lol
Bro took a month about talking about his lost month
JJ you are coming off as a sore loser who can't accept the loss. You should be humble and just focus on moving forward towards your next goal.
Never really gave a shit about the boxing just something jj wanted to do and its so cringe now, subbed for youtube content  not music. Not boxing. Not prime. Not shilling products. Just youtube.
You lost get over it 😂
Tommy won get over it 😂
JJ looking for rematch I think ksi would win
There he is
I’m happy to see this video, because in the Sidemen videos, i could feel something was on the back of your mind. Happy to see you back and it’s comforting to see such a strong, successful man be in tune with his feelings. You’re a strong man.  - random man from the internet
forgot you lost lwk dont take it too harsh bro🙌🙌
I watched it again, tried to be as unbiased as possible. I don't think you were "robbed" per se, but I don't see what Tommy did to win. I personally think it should've been a draw. You threw some funny looking combos, but that doesn't give Tommy points. He didn't do anything special either.
Honestly i think we all know you won that fight and seeing u lose was shocking for me but i'm glad u took a break to get ur mind out of things. Glad to see you back
Fuck boxing it's rigged we all know u beat tommy
JJ i am not trying to hate on you have been ur fan since 2015. Ur style is a problem man u have power so relying on wild punches isnt doing u any favors. Look at the basics man look at what some of the old timers were doing. Get better at conserving energy get better at positioning your opponents.
rematch?
Cry More 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
og Ksi fan here( been there since him and goujondaniel were friends), safe to say I have known this man for more than 70 percent of my life, this video kind of left a bad taste for me (askin his fans to berade tommy) I would have much rather he had shown the same level of maturity as Francis did. To all the new immature Ksi fans whos gonna hate on this comment, shove a thick veiny dick in your mouth and stfu( let the adults talk here), to the og fans, lemme know if im trippin
First half of this video was JJ, the second half attacking Tommy was KSI.
he sneezed 3 times that's how he lost lol
Ksi didn’t u hear the the reff did a math error that is why u lost the fight if the reff was good in match u would have won
Fight was pretty ass bro being real … too much hugging… all that shit talking .. to get in a ring and hug … I didn’t even pay for it but I want my money back …. But I did think u won the fight … but still 👎🏽👎🏽
does not matter who won that fight was ass
❤
Nah bro to me you won
don't be a sore loser man, we still back you  stop shitting bout his life, family etc  that chapter is done, move on
Really came across like a baby in this dude. You don’t need to defend yourself so hard😂 would have been so much cooler for you to just deny it and be chill while everyone else argues for you. Not beg beg beg and throw shade on camera lol
Of course you think you won it with how much hard work you put in. It was a draw at best. I think what stood out more above your average boxing was that someone who is meant to be a "professional boxer" did so poorly against you
You hugged him constantly? 😂 And didnt show up for a fight 😂
Dickhead😂😂😂 welcome
AHHH I LOVE YOU JJ
he's still salty, bro everyone loves you. get over it.
Yes… you lost 😂😂😂
Holy shit this is bad on so many levels like saying “oh I still think i won that fight” is ok many fighters do that but wtf is up with bringing up his child and his personal life and even advocating his fans to harass tommy ,this is insane we all thought jj was over that fight but nope
Good to see you back, but i think it would be better to take your loss on the chin rather than whine and complain about how you "never lost".
the second half was absolutely shameful. And I must say the upset fans are not cuz you lost but how you handled that. I dont know how you ever thought this video was in any way right to upload.
Shots fired lol
If he’s handling this loss like that, I could only imagine what would happen if he were to fight Jake Paul and lose
Mission: Remind Tommy Fury That He Didn't Really Win.  Got It !!!!!
So when you lose its just three random people who gave the wrong decision and the world knows you won but when you win those three people are not random anymore and you take their decision as the final one and not the one the world thinks is right. Its just hipocrisy there is something called sportsmans spirit you lost you should take it. You have fallen from grace and i am not even a hater i have genuinely enjoyed your content over the years and supported you in every fight.
Nice to see KSI again laughing...it doesn't matter if you lose...at tue end of the day there's always people will acknowledge you and accept you as you are...
We r proud of u fam u lost or not we are proud for you
Go make another brand out this
There is strength in humility. The judges have already made their minds and no amount of complaining will change that. You are not the first boxer to dispute the scorecards. You are sounding a lot like Logan Paul.
My goat
He’s seeming like how Joe Weller was when he lost he’s really not enjoying himself right he’s suffering from it I think he will probably pack everything in now
you needed you be humbled you were too confident
Well… judges gave the results and that is what it is. Can’t change it anyway. Its sports
Who cares about these useless fights anyway, do some reddit react videos or smth fun, rich people boxing is just whack
Building kindha pillar akshay gadu chillar😊
I’m glad to see you back but dude please just take it on the chin man
Used to be a fan but i think its so sad that this is genuinely the first time ive ever seen someone calling on their fans to carry on hating on someone because they arent personally happy with them, legit what has tommy even done to jj he signed a professional boxing bout against him and fought him, jj ud argue has been the biggest embarrassment after losing a fight, francis just lost a much closer fight and acted like a true boss, jjs done nothing but throw tantrums, make excuses and talk shit about someones family life and then called for his fans to keep hating on the guy, as i said uses to be a fan but this is mental
Dayum  im the one who commented "kane_samba4 : you lost to a youtuber tho" hahahaha glad you are happy and i made you laugh 😂😂 . Thanks for putting my comment on your video ❤ #TeamKsiforlife
You lost. Suck it up and get better instead of complaining like a *****. You could have shown great sportsmanship if you took this loss on a chin, instead of asking your fast to go after Tommy.   YOU LOST KSI AND ILL MAKE SURE TO ALEAYS REMIND YOU THAT
Taking the L like a man even though he deserved to win. Much respect
All the idiots in the comments talking about “good sport” you ain’t gunna be a good sport after putting in all that work being the dominant the whole fight landing more shots more power punch’s then losing like how u expect him too be a good sport after clearly getting robbed from his win like you’re all mad dumb and mad stupid and if you didn’t think he won get your eyes tested fr, and tell me why Tyson fury beat Francis because of punch stats but ksi nooo his punch stats don’t matter it’s clearly rigged he got robbed you’re all going at ksi for nothing muppets the lot of you
Fight Jake so he can knock you out already 😂😂 maybe then you will learn to be humble
Now fight jake, thats the only influencer fight i want to see.
OMG HE ACTUALLY POSTED
FUCK JJ WAS IN DUBAI AND I DIDN'T SEE HIM FUCKKK
Pussy bet u don’t fight him again nd get the win tho 😂
Fella we appreciate all the Shi u do, the break is well deserved, but you gotta take losses better bud
This is lame
Very horrendous sportsmanship and character from you regardless. But the "honest" fanbase will not answer this directly
JJ You are just walking toxicity. Encouraging your fans to berate the guy, NEEDLESSLY criticising him as a husband and father without knowing anything about his home life... Bruv grow tf up who even are you? 30 year old man behaving like some bitter little bitch teenager who didn't get his way. Just disappointing. Your loss against him doesn't define you, this god awful behaviour does.
Only reason you “lost” was because you said “I’m gonna shock the world”
This loss got to him so much lol.
So bitter, let it go. You officially lost.
It should've been a draw
Bruv this guy busy saying he’s okay, but still chatting absolute shit about Tommy is crazy. Let the man be, you don’t see him crying about this shit. Stop being a sore loser & move on
is ksi vs jake paul fight still happening.
Bro lost🤦
You just hugged him all the time.
Lol was fucking embarrassing, quit the sport of boxing. Its becoming a cringe mess.
🧂
Why the hell are you having a go at his family life??
Everyone here in the comments be like _"I love KSI BUT (Some hate or reasoning) but still props to JJ"_
Ok imma say this cause no one else is. If anyone reads they read if not that’s ok. JJ I personally think u won the fight..but mate what’s with all these personal shots at Fury? If you had just said”I think I won or I won” that would have been fine and accepted. But unless Tommy did something irl to u first then JJ u are taking it to personal(beyond boxing/professionalism). This was just highly unprofessional. JJ isn’t taking it as bad as Dillon but it’s just not right to attack someone’s personal life or character no matter what they did. U talking about him as a parent or bringing Molly into this when there was NO need to and etc THATS where u lost me. It was uncalled for and straight downright petty. No other way to say it. You attacking him as a husband and parent when you yourself have no kids are even KNOW Mollys true feelings or the situation is genuinely stupid. Like how Dillon brought Logan wife into it is basically what u did here, now yes in no way or u attacking her or the child but still. Most KSI fans will just meat ride to whatever u say but because I am a fan myself I will say when u are out of pocket and at least see if others feel the same. You wanna insult Tommy for the boxing match that’s fine ig, but the whole parent thing was low JJ and an even lower blow. If ur using that as a “superiority” thing then it’s just a no. Or using it to explain why your better then him that has NOTHING to do with the fight itself.
Thank god I can now eat my food
You think when GGG lost to Canelo , did he bring families into the equation?
You would act like a pro fighter but your unsportmanship makes you look like a child and a loser. The fight is over, you still tell your followers to go under Fury posts, mate you are NOT a fighter
You aint win that shit
I feel bad for this guy, he worked so hard
you had no defence, you were jumping about like an idiot even if you did win do you really think boxing player will be given a loss to a guy  who isn't a boxer and jumps about like a idiot with his hands down lucky tomy fury isn't a good boxer a good boxer would maul you any other youtube boxing wannabe in the ring. But still mad respect regardless takes lot of strength and will to step into the ring and fight and it isn't easy. gotta remember boxing is rigged asf you think they gonna allow a non boxer to beat a real boxer in their competition lol hell no unless you knock them clean outthey'll rig it.
Ur obsessed. No need to bring his family into it mate
Everyone’s mad like tommy actually won like bruh you’re all stupid re watch the fight ksi was the dominant the whole time judged clearly robbed him meanwhile on Reddit everyone’s crying saying why’s he not accepting it like bruh u not gunna accept it if you clearly won
Why is bro so invested in Tommy’s life😭
Bro literally grabbed on his opponent for like 5 rounds and did some atar jumps and thinks he won lol
My man’s back ❤❤❤❤
yes fatneek will be back becoz of tour and sidemen food videos :)
I like JJ but bringing Molly mae and tommys kid into it is unnecessarily deep and it shows how bad tommy got to him
🔥
Why you taking shots at his kid and wife though?
wdym bro after first round u were just jumping around doing nothing hugging tommy, overall he fucked u
This is sad
bro said he won 💀
stop crying big men
Yeah all that hopping around 😂
now fight IShowSpeed
embarassing video
take another break from social media and re-think your comeback, this aint it
https://youtube.com/shorts/x4kgdhZrKnk?si=8reSMgu8c7fiUKPK
Still denying it. Just let it go bruh it's over, just accept it you're only hurting yourself
Man aren't you gonna address the clinching??
Aint noway this man thinks he can go to a boxing match, not box, hug for 6 rounds and WIN ???
Listen man, I'm a long time fan and admire you to bits but your problem is one that is shared by many successful people like yourself, you're surrounded by yes-men. You did really well in the fight, but you still lost, legitimately. Look into how a boxing fight is scored and the metrics judges look for and you'll see why you lost. You can quote all the fight stats you like but fights aren't scored based on those stats.
Sipped kid sparing ???
Not joking but u were jumping around bro.
Maybe if you guys didn't hug for the entire fight you would have won fight 72   TIMES COME ON you hugged him more than your dad
It was more of a like hugging competition 🎉🎉
7:00 you’re almost crying over the loss like a little girl
Ahh the shock the world curse 🥲
the fight was months ago and this clown is still butthurt and salty 💀💀
30 years old yet has the mentality of a toddler. There seems to be a correlation between your fans and your mental age.
You lost man accept it. Bad sportsmanship
👑
Yeah, NNN was crazy.
Bro we all know he didn't win anything
i was there and everyone next to me though you won people were going nuts
I can't believe you're still crying about your loss, you look like a crybaby in this video. The fact your still taking shots at Tommy after you lost is actually pathetic. And the way you showed ignorance to everyone saying that you actually did lose but you tried and made it out like everyone thought you won was also disingenuous. I cant tell if it's your ego that did that or your just turning a blind eye, L video.
This video was a pretty sad L to be honest. Took a lot of time off, but showing no growth. Bringing up family, openly calling for harassment. Sad and weak KSI L.
What a great role model. I can already see how toxic his fans are gonna be to Tommy after this 🤮
You "Offically" lost the match, but really should have been a win or draw by the slightest. But is what it is mans done so much to accomplish a lot.  The same cannot be said for Tommy Furry.
It’s always in loss or defeat when you see a person’s true character. Not when he’s winning.
How ksi still has fans over the age of 15 is crazy to me
He knows how much it effected him mentally when he got online abuse and awful comments underneath his posts so for him to promote that towards Tommy is out of order. Twat
These comments want him to be a saint 🤣 I wonder if they ever think how they’d feel and act in his position. I don’t agree with every single thing he’s done but I respect that he’s genuine and real and if we’re all being honest we’re not all 100% perfect all the time.
Your sportsmanship was terrible. you cried like a baby on screen too we saw it dont worry. you made fun of logan for appealing. Everything you did. just imagine if jake did it. if jake did push ups againsts his opponents in the ring. that whole twitter thing you had going on too. with anesongib too. youve been on a downwards spiral. its sad to see. im glad you took time off and spent it with your family. i hope you take it easy and reflect on how you could be coming across. take accountability like you always did before. You lost. majority of people know you lost. its okay jj. youve won the battle of your life already. 10 years ago. enjoy the W.
Mate u have become too cringe. You can’t box, please just move on
Brudda I hope my message gets to you. You are basically my childhood and man so far you’ve come. The fight the judge were unfair true but what goes around come around. But man I’m proud of your fatneek a**
Haha lol
"And if you see him out in public  you can berate him as well"  Upload first video after that long and already telling your fan to harass people.
Love KSI, super inspirational.
Wdym the appeal has come in yes you lost fair and square
If you want to win the fight don't leave it to the judges
Seems like your hurt a lot more then tommy 😂😂😂. He doesnt give a dame but you seems to cry,cry and even more cry'ing. Never thought my respect for you could sink any lower. You where humbeld in the ring and outside by tommy😂 that is what you just proved in this video
yikes JJ.
just the L , to call and harass him like this is unnecessary
Hurry up and vs Jake Paul
Ksiiiii won either way a boxer who has been training all his life literally lot to a youtuberrrrr so tommy fury fans need to shut up and face reality and the proffesional boxers reaction tyson fury had a reaction which clearly portrayed how he thought ksi had won peace ✌️
Appeal verdict in……….you still lost
No one is denying KSI is one of the hardest working YouTubers, I’m glad you’re able to take a break for once. Rest longer if you have to.
Dang that’s crazy I bet he payed them off to say he won against ksi
Buddy, you lost. Just admit it at this point. Your ego overshadows ALL of your sense of logic. Besides, it's not like you were landing clean shots either. It was all hugging.
The difference in loss with Logan and KSI speaks volumes. Logan, although hes still a piece of sh*t, at least took his loss as a man.
This guy is a absalute man child, he still cant admit to taking a L
You spent 10 minutes making up excuses and trying to belittle Tommy. Accept you dont always win and move on. Poor sportsman
Finally he speaks
Maan leave Tommy alone he didnt score the thing... would have been much more respectable if you let your performance talk instead of attacking his personal life... you tatted Legacy on your back thats why it is KSIL now
The fact that ksi was able to get over 24 million subscribers on his first channel and have 16 million subscribers on his second shows how much of a legend he is. He's helped the sidemen out a lot over the years,he has businesses like prime,misfits,etc. He does boxing and music. This guy is an icon.
how the F did you think you won that???
Bro going out sad
You just hugged him the whole time bro.
It wasnt a good fight just stop complaining and stick to youtube mate.
take the L and go on
Tommy won on name sake alone that's it
Ffs he’s actually such a horrible person now
KSI won in our hearts!!
5:19  you can hear that he doesn’t believe this sentence. Been watching you for over a decade JJ, but you could have been a lot more mature and respectful in this video
30-year-old man sending his "fans" to "harass" Tommy Fury is just sad bro.
berating him is just childish. bit dissapointed ksi cant lie
Bro even the announcer said he won before they said Tommy won. so much bull happened that it's crazy
Really hard to watch. The good times dont last forever, not for anyone. When life goes against you, there is two ways to react.   Take the L, accept it, humble yourself and try to learn and grow.  Or do whatever this is.   Yours sincerely, someone who catches multiple Ls daily 😂
Your biggest L will always be your facial hair, dont worry man.
yea sore loser from the beginning of the video....confirms a sore loser towards the end of the video also...sad to see someone soo deticated be soooo cringe about loosing.....give it up man
Take the loss and move on brother, it is what it is. You’re winning at life who gives a fuck about a boxing match. You did better than people thought you would and made millions in the process. Just accept it like a man and set an example for your younger audience on how to handle loss, that’s the people your reaction reaches the most as they hang on your every word. This idea of “I can’t lose” is a bad example to set.
0:46 and even more people thought you lost bro
All the people crying in the comments really upset about what he said its not that deep tommy had daid plenty about jj after the fight but you haters wanna cry as soon as jj says something stfu you fake ass little nerds
This man’s a cry baby bro fr
YOU WON MY MAN
Definitely spend peaceful time with ur family bro since 2017 is madness I know u gotta grind for the paycheck I’m  the same myself but I’m older and have regrets at points not spending loving time with my genuine family missed many holidays ect.. funerals deaths in the family that I wish I got to spend atleast a few moments with before there time life itself is a blessing and luxury don’t waste ur downtime u never know when time may come for you or others u may cherish and love god bless u brother 🙏🏾🙏🏾
You lost KSI, they humbled you. Acknowledge the facts and dont let your yesmen get the worst out of you. Still, there's nothing wrong with losing, especially since you gave a hard time to a proffessional boxer; you should be proud of that. So, stop pretending like you did not and stop acting childish (telling us to shit on Tommy ¿? low af). Even if you win the appeal, you have nothing to shit on Tommy bc 1. the fight was bad 2. it was VERY close. Tbh, this behavior is dissapointing your fans.
I dont think that appeal is gonna be taken serious mate, the boxing world is kind of careful about its public perception, I fear they just said Fury won to protect the sport from influencers who they think are taking the piss out of it.  Also, might wanna take out the part in the video where you try to send your fanbase after him, it's 1) not gonna help the appeal if they somehow see it before the decision is made, 2) can get you banned on YT for incitement of violence/hate. Careful dude.
jj just mad that he have to fight jake paul now
But you didn't won stop whining 😂😂😂😂
luv u jj
UR BACK IN THE SIDE CHANNEL
JJ
I was shocked by the judges .. You are undefeated for me bro. Keep up! 💪
I love ksi, but his arrogance is reaching heights that overshadow his other positive attributes.  You lost, squarely.  And made yourself look a spoilt child after the fact. Its all very well and good saying it's an act, but its all you ever do these days.  I think you needed this loss. Amd i hope you learn from it.
https://youtu.be/Wsj79-QeDBk?si=mdZFPuP8_lutxqM4
Now say that without the 😭
this is your biggest L video, following you since 2011 since road to DIV 1 days and you basically turned into what you were mocking some years ago. If Boxing is just a hobby you shouldn't mind taking the L. You looked shambolic in that fight take the L on the chin, improve your boxing skills and move on with your life this is just embarassing
Some should use this video on a " reacting to salty compilations "
Wow.. your lack of sportmanship really disappoints me. Your ego is getting way to big, what has happened to you JJ?
Now stop ducking jake
No shish you lost wtf
3:11 Burned Out is a bad enemy
Glad to have you back KSI! I don’t think anyone cares about the boxing match “loss” I think we’re all just glad to see another positive video from you. You’re awesome
I could've told you that
looks like nothing’s changed
Majority of these comments are not it..
WHAT A CLOWWWWWWN
dont think this is a good take, asking people to spam that he lost isnt the way to do things. Seems like tommy is too "in your head" and you need to let go. have some sportsmanship and take the L. yes the fight had some pro's and cons, and tommy was far worse than we were expecting, but the fact of the matter is, you still lost, and thats okay.
I think you won that fight too because you just did more but tbh you actually didnt improve much, like you threw the same aimless punches as always, pointless and uncoordinated overhand strikes, and dude, you talking about how he hit you multiple times in the back of the head, but you did the same shit, even more often. You just had no control and underneath you are still the same amateur as ever. You said: "Nobody knows what Im capable off, nobody knows how I fight." And now we know, and it changed nothing. This video began kinda mature and deeply thought off but in the end, you dissapoint with your infinite immaturity.
Welp finally a youtuber realises what the boxing world is all about, nothing is fair
You’ve won in the eyes of the world❤
Cringe, just cringe. Ego too big, maybe one day you will look back on this and realise how deluded you behaved. Maybe, probably not.
""YEAH BUT TOMMY FURY IS THE GOAT THOUGH""
Too much hugging doesn't win you fights 😂
""YEAH BUT KSI IS ""NOT"" THE GOAT THOUGH""
What an embarrassing loss that was. Tommy is a legacy fighter...you're a YouTuber. You don't belong in pro boxing. The fact that you couldn't knock him out proves you don't have it in you. Besides based on your performance you were on the cusp of a shitty victory. You should be embarrassed.
what a loser this guy has became . he is just a black version of logan paul now.
JJ won 100%
Always been a big fan JJ. Didn’t care whether you won or lost, but grow the fuck up JJ. You’re a 30 year old man telling people to harass Tommy Fury. Just move on
honestly i feel like the judges were payed to make Tommy win cuz they knew Tommy would lose. i watched the game and from my POV, Tommy was cheating and somehow he WINS? no way. there had to be something else.
This vid is pretty pathetic. How can you keep regressing?
KSI clearly won that fight. He got completely screwed by that controversial result. But now we must move on and turn things around.
Thanks to you we had the opportunity to see Tommy Fury's real power and years of training...what a joke...and also Dillon Dannis 😂😂😂...you are still KSI and he is still somebody who got a bit o fame because of you.
HAHA GORILLA LOST
Bruh KSI has no sportsmanship, regardless of whether he believes he won or not he should be able to shake hands and say fair enough, not attack his opponent because he believes he won, it’s childish and sore loser ish 😂
Only took a whole month for him to feel less awkward about making a video. I used to be a massive JJ fan.
Bro let that sh!t go ,it been a agessss why you still crying over that.
I need KSI and R-Truth interactions in WWE 😂
Honestly this is cringe. Your ego cannot handle a single L. I’m done. Unsubscribed.
I mean…at least you shocked the world like you said you will😂
U keep on taking Ls mans worse then old deji
Bro obviously if the appeal wasn’t accepted it’s because ksi clearly lost. Its been a few months already since the fight and if JJ did win it would’ve already been appealed over to him🤦‍♂️. Clearly Tommy won
professional cuddler asks fans to berate Tommy Fury
I mean you are still very successful so its all good
I bet he has one of those "laughing at Tommy Fury" vids in his archives he thought he was gonna post lmao
Yes you did. Suck it up buddy
Spoilt little sore loser…  You can take the geek out of private school but you can’t take the private school out the geek. 😂☠️
This is soo embarrassing,JUST ACCEPT YOU SUCK,stop whining
Nah, i’d win…
This video is a bad look imo. That whole bit with Tommy not looking after his kid, was just unnecessary and gives off "bad loser" vibes
Y'all calling it rigged are hilarious. Tommy looked like shit in that fight, but KSI was awful.   Hilarious hearing talk about how he thinks he won that when all he did was hold on to Tommy for dear life.
You didn't lost... you've learned a lot of things...and I think it should have been a draw...but for us you are still a winner
Bruv they made "Ngannou" the loser, just think about it. These furys are some ultra rich dudes who can buy any referee.  But JJ , I gotta say, it was not it. The technique was a$$. The punches you were throwing. And everything. The movement.... I think we need a rematch with proper technique.
Jj you don‘t need to explain why you took a break, just take one when you feel like it
Tommy may or may not have beaten you in the ring but he sure as hell beat you mentally. JJ's ego has taken the worst hit. Bro has turned salty and has shifted to calling himself a youtuber again, he considered himself a boxer before.
KSI we are soo proud of where you have come and and definitely deserve a break. We all know that you won that fight
you’re so bitter. this is the same stuff you ripped into logan etc for. embarrassing
Racism man
Your delutional KSI, just move on. You lost so what. No need to hate on Tommy after the fight. Your acting like a kid
I don’t care about the loss, I care KSI is acting like an awful loser. It’s shows awful character.
Well done KSI, great role model and inspiration for everyone to start chasing their dreams an know that it is possible.
Insulting a man's ability as a father is about as low as you can go especially when you're a 30 year old man child. Truly and utterly pathetic.
It is so childish of a man to attack another man’s family business like bro you lost and except it don’t go around fucking attacking the man like stop
I'm sure the judges got paid under the table to give Tommy the win
record more music
Love you JJ but don't think I will watch the video not to hate not to jump ship but you aren't selling the fight anymore so it isnt justified to tear Tommy down to big yourself up that's called ego. Ripping at him and his parenthood just for the cause and encouraging fans to hate on is poor from you. You may hate to hear this but you are proving Jake right by becoming all you made fun of Logan for. It's easy to be a gracious winner but strength of character shows when you lose and youve become too fixated on the tattoo on your back to be the ones you stand for on your arms and chest.
Yes you did...
Yeah bro, I think most of the people think you didn't win the fight objectively, it is not only 3 random as you claim it is.
Leave all the hate. You are a W
I nearly pissed myself laughing when i read up on the appeal yesterday😂 the fact the the scorecards were added wrong IN TOMMYS FAVOR makes all this more embarrassing for you 😂 next time instead of the Embarrassment accept the loss like A MAN
What a disappointing reaction to a loss smh, yikes
Honestly JJ, mad fking respect The fact that you were a bald kid playing fifa and now fighting tommy fury and winning the fight according to everyone is just a different level of dedication Love you JJ
You lost, be a man and accept it.
Yes the fight was an L (by the judges standards) but this is honestly a really tasteful response and I’m glad you managed to get a nice little holiday. I have nothing but respect for you JJ and you’ve been a real inspiration for me.
Absolutely no need to justify  why you are tired or the way you feel. Your journey and the fight itself are there for people to see and judge for themselves. But in regards to the loss.... Is this really how you make yourself feel better? Comparing with him, making fun of him and talking about his personal life after losing to him.... If you truly believe you "came out better" act like it. The nightmare persona of a kid that grew into himself weirdly conditioned you to never lose hence the childish anger after the fight.
The only thing i remember from that day is how pathetic the Logan Paul fight was.
jesus salty KSI still trash talking Tommy Fury
"forgot to box?"
Even though its unrelated, when I saw the fight my mind immediately went to Atom vs Zeus in the real steel movie. Its uncanny how close the 2 are alike.   So I think its one of those "lost the fight but won the war" type of scenarios
KSI lost, really lost, Tommy is better, you couldn't beat him after sparring demons.... whatever, just get over it. Your sportsmanship is awful, Tommy doesn't claim to be world class, he claims to be a young boxer who is trying to get better with every fight, he trashed talked on the lead up to the fight like you're meant too, he hasn't run you down after the fight, you feel the need to run him down now?? it's a bit pathetic and isn't telling people to berate someone in public inciting violence???? you've gone way too far. he did win, he knows he did and he's moved on. You haven't moved on, you lost and you're still trying to make yourself feel better about it by running him down. Kids should not be using this man as a role model.
You lost jeez!!!! Get over it!! You cry baby
‘Depressed :D’ that was funny my g x
the king, the goat, the nightmare, the KSI...  what's bigger? JJ Olatunji.
JJ becoming more and more pathetic
geeks bruvs
Cut the bullsh!t. You sound super salty, finding excuses to validate your win and clown on Tommy for no reason. This isnt you KSI.
take a year of mate
bro is actually crying inside
God this reaction to a loss is just pathetic..
Let it go bro.. we all take Ls.
you're so bitter. "be sure to keep commenting on his posts & berate him in person if you see him" that's such sour behavior XD. think you need to grow up...
Bro waited 2 months to say he lost 💀
NO shit LOL AHAHAH   bro did the same thing logan paul did after he lost
I wasn't expecting that but you won in my eyes KSI just glad that you are back 😘 PS loving the prime drinks by the way you also deserve a break love you KSI
such a sore looser lmfao
My man made a whole essay on his loss 😂😂
Ksi might actually be a bad person
Bro wants all of his children fans to harass Tommy😂, Ik bros hurting
Nothing made me more happy to see you get humbled at last !! all those yes men telling you won is a joke get some sportsmanship You are a grown adult acting like a kid 🤡
Narcissistic behavior, little corny for a grown man.
Womp Womp Womp sore loser weak ahh boxer
Yeah this is an L
bro you still lost, act like a man
damn, i actually almost cried at the end of this video :')
Man, Tommy didn’t half humble you. Still salty 😂
Delete this Ksi you gotta show sportsmanship
You both hug in a fight and sit here debating who won the fight... you did not have a fight, you both had a hug it out in the ring.
Broo stay strong me and potentially million others are proud of you and you are such an inspiration for the youth. Just the problem was that your ego became bigger than your forehead 😂😂
The first stage of grief is denial and we can see it clear as day in this video
You hardly engage and clinch for dear life. Also, are u doing karate or boxing?
Bro. He didn’t choose to win, he just did
C’mon JJ why are you still crying? It has been over a month.   Leave the father alone. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Kai on demon time👹
Comments gone soft
You are in a sport where everyone will Win and lose at some point. We respect you regardless
❤
can you and jake fight please
jj got robbed (make this top comment so he knows that we all know he shoulda won that)
KSI:   "Nah, i'd win."
You fight like a clown lol hhahahah
Wasnt even close to winning the fight
Noob
Bro, if that’s the energy you’re coming back with then I highly recommend you to go back to your holiday.   Very disappointed in you.
Ya he needs to be at home with his fiancé and daughter!!
The fight should have been a draw, ksi you just hugged him all fight. Take the L will grace
im a ksi fan but this video is kinda pathetic
Honestly... this video is worse than the Logan Paul appeal video from a couple of years ago on JJ. The fact that JJ tells everyone here to HARASS TOMMY FURY, is insane and so out of line for JJ. He is just the fighter you currently lost to JJ, fair or not. Doesn't mean you have to send the hate of your fanbase that is 20-30 times bigger than Tommy's to harass him and his family. This is not Sportmanship, and I believed and hoped you would've been the better man.
U lost end of move on
Also i've heard nothing but excuses here "i was fighting tough ass people man" i've done so much "i've done this" "i've done that" stop with these excuses cause the old ksi wouldn't be making these excuses even had he lost
Didnt matter if you won or lost i mean yoh did win but dont matter to us well done
Ksi is a straight 🤡 telling your very immature young fanbase to go after someone just cause you lost is crazy 🤣
Man been supporting you for so many years but this is just disgusting delusional behavior on your part
Sooooooo db legends?
JJ my man we respect you no matter what. Take your time my friend and god speed
kinda sad ngl
Delete the video man
I think the fight was a draw
No loses just lessons..u won tho
No need for the personal jabs about him being a father JJ.
Ahhh baba take that L like a real man 😂😂JAKE PAUL can beat your ass
What a sore loser.
we all disagree with the nonsense you said about berating tommy in public and to comment on his posts etc, but us true fans don’t care wether you won or lost, all that matters is that you did your best and showed the world anything is possible through hard work and dedication. all we ask is for you to just take the lost and move on similar to what logan did it hurts we all know but you can’t always be number one and everyone agrees on that.
u lost..so? idc what u do..just keep on doing😌never give up😁
You gonna get rid of that legacy tattoo then
You got chael on there big up unc chael 👿
There were no winners in that fight...
You deserved to win scam
we struggled to find your highlights to see ifyou won
was a fan but no longer am, learn how to take an L
You won, we all know it. It's just that the little boys in your comments would rather see their representation claim the win, regardless! Sad truth.
stop complaining bro that fight was embarassing and i thinks its honestly a draw
Damn I forgot you got that tat aswell yikes 😬
❤
We are all beyond proud of you man, biggest inspiration going 🤙🏼❤️
Wheres the integrity in ksi?
I feel for you KSI. Obviously your purse didn't have enough 100 dollar bills to dry your tears on. I will pray for you my man. So oppressed
ksi fans are so soft...ayoo ur still our fatneek
you are not a boxer dude give it up and get over your cringe tbh
KSI talking about tommys family and his baby, and missus shit is so low, ksi just proving to be the narcissist we all know he is, no way should he be talking like that about his family to millions of people, this is why people.hate ksi nowadays
yes yes u did your pish
He won that's it and he's right! But regardless we love him and we want to see him continue to do amazing
You did great !
Shoulve been a draw imho but oh well you lost jj, but barely
telling everyone to shame him at whatever chance they get is kinda not what i wanted you to say but eh beside that, mad respect t you.
JJ, it's good to see that you're back and you had a great break. About the fight, whether you win or not, it was a terrible fight (including Logan v Dillon) - I'm sure you and Tommy are tougher than that. But, it looks like no one wants to engage in a full-on fight and just want to hit a "lucky punch" and go home with the bag. It was my first time paying for PPV, and thank Deen, Slim, Bdave, Pineda for saving that night. Just my 2 cents, don't bother trying to fight Jake - if you'll be doing the same thing, it will be embarassing.
Respect
bruh take the L and move on
Bro even idris Elba said you got robbed
Losser stop making excuses...just accept it... You fight well but he fight better
The curse continues
Bruh I don’t like u anymore you act immature 😢
Man pulled a logan paul video😂
We all know that right now the only fighting sport that is not fake and a big scam is MMA!
Bro confessing for what lol you won bro and still winning🎉
JJ, as an OG fan, I have witnessed your long journey to become who you are. You remind us constantly about your rags-to-riches story as if we've already forgotten about it. But the question is - who have you become? Your dire need for success has turned into an addiction It is that matters more to you than anything You said it yourself: even the Sidemen shoots, which were very good since you came back, don't really make up for it Sure, losing is depressing, especially when you have a competitive nature, but it no way does it justify inciting the hate towards another human being Nothing can justify it, really This is just not humanlike behaviour We get it, you work really really hard, but don't we all? Don't we all grind for the better of us and our people? Look at your peers, you friends - they work a lot too Do they gain the power to incite hate against someone? Absolutely not.  Be better, JJ, be better.
Good to have I’m back
Love u JJ. Love u loads🎉 Just wished the new guys on ksi reddit to keep their opinions to themselves.  A lot of the comments recently just hatin. You mad bitch??😂
love you JJ but this is some hard copium brother, you dont gotta get into your past n shit to justify losing, it is what it is
All u did was hug him and shit
I swear bro... If ksi and tommy fury had to run it back.. I swear KSI would have beaten tommy fury ass
No need to go after him and his family bro.
JJ we still Love you, for us you won!
next video after this has got to be LAUGHING AT: KSI
this is dogshit man. dont tell people to berate him. thats petty and pathetic. sure you may not agree with the decision. but thats also not tommys fault the judges called it the "wrong way" in your opinion
You had the chance to show all your kid fans you shill prime to how to lose with class and dignity. Instead you showed them that you are out of touch and so used to getting your own way you can’t handle it when you don’t.
So ksi tells his meat riders to attack Tommy on instagram and still proceeds to shit on him, what great sportsmanship🤡 ksi 1-1 Tommy fury 10-0
JJ: "You're a terrible father not looking after your kid"  Meanwhile you JJ are on your 4th abortion (5th?) At least he's not murdering his children you sicko
Acting like Tommy killed his mum
Just stop crying noww
Try not to laugh money
Does anyone know if there is going to be any new music. Just wondering because I couldn't post on the reddit
Dude makes a video weeks after 😂 had a cry then tried to play it off 💀 already damaged your reputation from that mate 🤙
it's better if you accept the loss and wtf is that stance?
ksi > lommy lury
Bruh really waited until Tommy slipped up to bash him and make himself feel like he’s the better man like bruh your ego was broken and your exposing how big of a man child you are sad I watched you while I was growing up I was hoping for a Reddit video in hopes to laugh with you and get passed this but now I’m just disappointed and I know I ain’t the only one but best believe the 10-14 years old will follow you and follow your order but us fans who’s been with you since fifa 12 days are just disappointed honestly
This video meant a lot to me personally  Forever love ❤❤
Spam legends we will never stop
He said that Tommy should be ashamed of how he fought in the fight. The 2 of them should be ashamed and embarrassed, the fight was awful, it’s was a clinching match more than anything, there was never any real boxing, neither guy really went for it, KSI was crying at one stage for a tap on the back of the head, Tommy rarely threw his best punch (jab) and just overall it was a dreadful fight to watch, in my opinion, you both fuckin lost, and so did all the fans friends and family that watched the shockin thing.
who edited this? jeez
Man, you are clear, you dont have to explain yourself, you needed a break, and thats completely understandable, you work a lot! You need to recharge and thats fine... we will still be here, every time you go away, we will be here waiting, and i am 28 yrs old now😅, been watching you since 2012... keep up Man! Dont loose it! We will keep supporting you, If you want to continue!❤
Konichiwa🙏
The level of disrespect and lack of sportsmanship is already appalling, but to verbally go after tommy when the decision had been made? HE’S NOT A FUCKIN JUDGE!!!!!!! HE’S THE GUY YOU’RE FIGHTING FFS!!!!! It really pisses me off when a fighter gets mad at their opponent when the decision doesn’t go their way.
Jj we've said not to make that video laughing at Tommy before and you didnt listen, we said to chill on Wade and didnt listen, to calm down and didnt listen and now you do this, I dont understand why we cant just stop. We are a pretty big and devoted fanbase but as you should know we aint Yes man if you dont drop the act and chill out a lot of people are gonna just fet fed up, just stop. No need for this, or to keep talking about Tommy, attack his parenthood or incit you millions of fans to artack him online, wich is against both Youtube and Instagram policies if not illegal. Noone asked you to act so proud, you can drop things, leave them be and still be KSI
Not sure if KSI is starting to build up hype for a rematch or not, but if he's not, then this is seriously immature of him to tell his fans to go and harass Tommy because he can't take an L. Even worse is KSI getting personal by talking shit about Tommy's role as a father. Not cool, man. You're clearly influenced by Logan Paul. I don't remember you being this childish.
Bro still didn't open Reddit. The true nightmare tbh, that shit scares a professional boxer 💀💀💀
they both parent and son are corrupted.. look how his daddy took the win from ngannou.. its clear that tyson lost the fight but well he " won " ..same goes to his son's fight... corrupted blood guess..and for you.. you done great so far.. cant compare you to a pro boxer..tommy supposely be a pro boxer but you better than him.. i mean you do great job so far.. and keep moving and move on.. love the content love the pure soul and that honest
they both parent and son are corrupted.. look how his daddy took the win from ngannou.. its clear that tyson lost the fight but well he " won " ..same goes to his son's fight... corrupted blood guess
wait so the appeal failed?
I’m sorry but there’s being a sore loser and then there’s just being a dick. Telling his fans to spam tommy with “you lost the fight”, that’s just fuckin childish and sad, shows a hell of a lot of insecurity. I’m disappointed JJ.
W KSI
They should have a rematch though, I don’t care if it costs £100 ppv, I’ll be watching
big up JJ 🤍
As a long time fan (from fifa days) its sad to see what you re doing. You fell off big time man. Not only can't take the L but sending people to harass Tommy? Are you mad?
Bro you harsh
Rematch tom fury
Rematch
Rematch
Rematch it
That Japan clip killed me😂😂.
Nothing on DAZN scamming everyone into a year long subscription despite cancelling in time? This best be in areddit video
JJ deserve that 🏆
Yeah man  Good way to get sympathy I thought this video is about u loosing But it's not  It's about ur journey and gaining sympathy
Man u  didnt even talk about how u started hugging tommy nearly all of the time and instead of owning up to it and admitting u lost u are still crying and unleashing ur fandom after tommy fury childish behavior tbh.
At the end of the day i didn't really care too much about the fight but all he had to do at the end was show a little bit of respect, humility and sportsmanship when the fight was over. There was very little need to speak more on the fight as it was gonna come up in conversations over the next few months regardless.
You r a bum ksi
You got beat mate. grow up and get on with it
Sore loser
Man even if you did take back what you said berating Tom or about him being a husband the fact still stands that you did that because you were being a sore loser about the whole thing instead of taking it like a champ to compensate all of the mad talk you did before the fight.
BASED
So glad you lost, you’re so arrogant
This is the final nail in the coffin for me JJ been watching  you since a long time and even when you were 'problematic' you did not seem as desperate or not genuine but this entire year time and time again you have stooped lower and lower, not addressing issues with Prime, keeping ties with Logan even after he ruined lives, lashing out on people for having opinions, saying racial slurs and now this whole thing, why not gravefully disagree if you feel it was unfair, why go fot Tommy and not the judges and why go for his personal life JJ,all of this desperacy to satisfy your ego and prove to the world that you are better somehow I have always looked up to you because you are a hard worker but nah man  I just cannot watch you anymore, wish you have a really good boxing and YT career mate, Good Luck with it
KSI is the most genuine boxer.
Ksi bro we don't care u loss u did better boxing is unjustice sport
That Was more jumping jack then boxing you Was doing 😅😅
Still got robbed
Tommy is crying that Logan retired from boxing because he wanted that fight next so badly and now his so hungry for another pay day he wants to fight a 54 year old jake and Ksi agree on one thing TOMMY FURY IS A FRAUD BIG TIME
KSI really needed to be humbled, and this video shows his ego is still too big for his own good… really disappointing that he cant accept he lost, its ok to lose bro he’s a “pro” boxer and you nearly beat him just be proud
Wow this is embarrassing. Telling people to publicly berate the man because he beat you. Just take the L and move on man.
JJ, you lost. Get over it and learn to box without star jumps
U trained so hard for what hugging Tommy furry
True Geordie thought you won!? Omg shock horror
Bro was not sparing he was dancing lol
We need baldski now
Jj looking like pineda with the back head shots
Love the content and any music in the works take the time you need but can’t wait for the new bangers
tbh they both lost that was dog shit performance
Bro ksi is such a sore loser for telling people to hate on tommy fury just except the loss, what an embarrassing time to be a ksi fan
bros doing a jake paul ting, jus take the loss bro
if you didn't hug him that much you would've won
Guess what, you will always have that lost by your record  keep crying 😂
https://youtube.com/shorts/AgW4U8QjvrE?si=121_y7xLxYZgx_li
he ran away for weeks so people can forget his outrageous behaviour and hugging meanwhile he made videos the next day when jake lost lol
Comments passed the vibe check
‘Life isn’t fair. Am i right?’ JJ u have no rights. (Obv its a joke)
Don’t worry you didn’t lose, you made millions. Meanwhile we spent like 60$ or something on 2 shitty ass fights. So you didn’t lose. We all lost
Look, every professional athlete will go through a loss or hard time Accept the reality that you lost (even though it was close) and move on This was a weird video to watch
KSI I love you man but take the L
that awkward konichiwa will always be one of the funniest moments imo
Jesus, I consider myself a KSI fan, but you lost, it was a close match, maybe even unfair, but just take a loss as a man... You can't always win, just because you trained hard, probably harder than Tommy, doesn't make you a winner automatically. You say that it's pathetic that Tommy couldn't beat you easily, since you are just a youtuber who barely started boxing, yet you still think about yourself in your head as the biggest boxing talent the world has ever seen.  And the fact that you want to ask your fanbase to shame Tommy online and in person because he didn't beat your ass as he said he would??? You didn't do anything to him either... and you were saying the same bullshit before the fight that you are going to drop him. You are missing modesty and sportsmanlike, maybe with a clearer mindset you could have won.  As I see it, that's a low point of your career, not because you lost, but because the way you handle it.
They did Tommy a huge disservice by handing him the fight. The fact that a majority said you won the fight means you won. That's all that matters. Keep going man. You're incredibly talented.
L
L
LOOOOOOOOSERRRRRRR
Ksi L
It doesn’t matter if you lost I mean look back a few years you  were a ‘fat neek’ and how much you changed is amazing. You lost 20Kg, be proud of yourself
Jake paul was on your side because fury beat his ass too lmfao
Stop Taking your loss like a pussy move on. It’s making me not wanna be your fan LOL. Holy bro u shud be on to the next one
Spreading more hate telling people to harass a person bc you are a sore loser. That is low even for you. You've got so many kids that are watching your videos. You are shameful.. But when people gives you hate, you consider yourself a victim, but I believe some people who are consumed by hatred tends to attract others like him.
7:50 words of a true loser
Congratulations 🖤👑
The fury legacy is in ruins and "we are here for it"
No issue mate ur comeback will be epic  Remember " its not over yet "
“You have the right to work, but for the work's sake only. You have no right to the fruits of work..." It's okay to feel frustrated after hard work, you're human and did what most people can't do. However its clear you're motivated by the outcome. "They who work selfishly for results are miserable.”  At 30 years old go a little deeper. Firstly you've been boxing since 2018 thats 5 years. Secondly Tommy is 24 years old. He seems to act more mature than you. The fact that you're talking about his family is low. Life on earth is never fair, so count your blessing and be happy how far you've come and how fortunate you are.
U did (lost)? Okay
It was about time you lost im sorry but you’re too delusional when it comes to boxing
Now this where a champion actually starts.Get up from your loss JJ.We with you all the way
Bro still think he won💀
Should have shown Andrew Schultz opinion on the fight
Massive respect to KSI for his unshattered ego!.
Sorry dude, but going after someone’s personal life, under the guise of caring, just because you didn’t get the outcome you wanted from the fight is childish. None of us live with him, so what if he tried to have some fun by being in a club or two, or literally anything else? Just stick to what you’re good at, as boxing clearly isn’t it, nor is taking losses like an adult. It’s one thing to be upset, it’s another to show it.
Youve been robbed man we're still love you brada
KSI didnt want the fight, he was Holding on for dear life. I have been a huge fan for many years, but it sucks to see him clinch so much.
You don’t have to go this low
Good to see you back bro
Give up you lost everyone’s respect
Jj even though I love you and ive been a fan since the beginning but I think that talking about his personnel life and him being father and especially about continuing to respond to his posts and even in public is an L and a childish action
Weak.
Fragile ego
This video is embarrassing
you on par with salt papi and below slim, embrace it as adult
People who actually know boxing (and don’t just pretend to know it because of influencer boxing ) and consistently watch it know that JJ won . Say what you want about the way he fought, doesn’t change the fact he won
you clearly lost the fight stop crying
Imagine being 1-1 then quitting when things get tough 😂 L mentality
Boring. This channel mid asf. The old KSI will never be topped. And everyone thought that you won because they were biased towards you because youre way more popular than tommy fury and everyone was just going for you.
1:58 'racially motivated'
HES back im so happy ❤
He truly has a great message about not giving up, no matter who you are, especially when you're doubted. However, it is completely overshadowed and contradicted when he can't just accept defeat like a true fighter. It's appauling how much ego this man has even when he lost fair and square. At this point it seems like his message about never giving up is more of a justification for losing, rather than an inspirational way to keep pushing forward. The man he despises the most, Jake, had more humility in defeat and it speaks volumes to the type of man JJ truly is. The only reason I say all of this is because the last thing I was expecting from this video was him telling his supporters to basically harass Tommy and not to mention JJ trashing him and his family (I guess I shouldn't be surprised since this isn't the first time he's gotten his supporters to do exactly that). More of a low blow than the hits to the back of the head in my opinion. It doesn't matter what the rest of the world thinks, we have professional-unbiased judges for a reason and the appeal got rejected. You lost. Take the L like a true champion, because you ARE an inspiration to many younger individuals who look up to you. But this ain't it bro.
Bro cried after losing and now wants his audience to bully Tommy??
It doesn't matter bro We love you❤ Keep it up 💪
Legend JJ!! You work so hard !!fuck everyone else’s opinion
Jake Paul, the pussio wants to fight you after his pro fight, bun that guy, the guy that gave luck to Real Madrid when facing Liverpool in 2022. Hyprocrite, Logan is clear. KSI pay that Fury guy a lesson in 2024 Wembley after you do Jake in January. Train @ComedyShortsGamer as well, work with him. Team 🇬🇧
Jj grow up
Dude. You lost, let that go away, stop commenting about Tommy Fury. Just stop complaining.   I love you man, but your ego is way higher than I thought. I'm glad you lost, because you can now lower your ego.
Dude you tried your best and you lost. Even though it was not a clear loss because I watched the fight live it was not a clear win as well. But that doesn't matter. The thing I always admired most about you is not how you continuously win is how you handle criticism. I would have respected you more if you came the next day saying "Welp I lost, haha". Sometimes you can train your hardest and honestly your workout routines and dedication is the true W here. Don't let a single fight stop you from being great. Be proud of everything you achieved. Take the L proudly and continue being awesome. That's my two cents at least.
Copium
Bro u have zero technique💀 all u do is throw this wild overhand right and when it doesn’t land, u end up clinching. Quit being a sore loser and take the L, and if we’re being honest u kinda deserved to lose after the awful display of sportsmanship by you getting personal about the father bs😂😂
Fight was a hug fest simple as that. It was shite
Soooooooo petty and Soooooooo cheap my nigga ksi to go for the family 😢
Will fatneek come back ....
JJ if you are reading this weaponizing your fans against someone is so low. You worked hard but lost, it must hurt but it's been 2 months already. Grow up and get over it like a mature adult. You don't need to get Tommy's kid into it and say he's a bad father just because you lost at boxing. If you cannot take an L you don't deserve the W. You know you have a lot of influence and you know how dangerous fan harrasment can get especially in public. Openly asking your fans to harras him could also get your video banned or worse - it could cause actual harm to his family.
Regardless of the result “you make it look easy” oh and you were 2nd on my Spotify wrapped . The vid was jokes 🎉🎉 . Rest up . 2024 be different 😊
was 9 minutes over so quickly???
Unfortunately you are just providing excuses and trying to say tommy is super embarrassing now when he won and is celebrating and you have to take digs at how he handles his family🤦‍♀️couldn’t beat him in the ring so your still trying to find comfort in tormenting him online. You should have just shaken the man’s hand and moved on like jake Paul did. This has proven Jake is a better man than you
You clearly lost the fight mate.
The GOAT
That's how professional boxing world works. Just look at Ngannou vs Fury.
Next time, stop hugging your opponent and actually throw some punches
I thought you won the star jump competition
Just take the L bro poor response video
U don’t know how to box. U throw wild Haymakers and call it a day. Idk wtf is u training for.
Nah bruv watch the video you made on Logan Paul after you won the fight. The past you is talking to the current you.
Omg! Thats a loooot of copium 😂
KSI: What do you think of Tommy. CROWD: "SHIT".  KSI: What do you think of shit.  CROWD: "TommyFury". KSI: Thankyou. CROWD: That's all right. We hate Tommy. We hate Tommy. We hate Tommy. We hate Tommy .......... 😂😂😂
Bruv, i thought this was as a reacts
STILL LOVE FROM INDIA..❤
Bro JJ really so insecure that hes going after Tommys personal life. This shit wouldve worked like 6 years ago when his fanbase was entirely kids but his audience is growing up now.
I love how jj, takes major problems above his head and still managed to post....😊❤ keep posting king ❤🫂
Damn Ksi i thought this fight was going to humble you and you were going to move on. But how wrong i was 😔  Tommy beat you physically and mentally
Missed you bro. I hope you never stop posting. Love you
over conifidence
dudes talking about being exhausted but makes millions. mate almost everyone works full-time jobs 9/5 and struggle to get by day/by day. they don't complain but move forward unlike you. this video just shows how self entitled you are man
It’s all good KSI we still proud of you but that match was a shitfest😭
Ur the best JJ!!
What a sore loser
Sore loser
who remembers when he called Logan Paul a "sore-loser"😂
Play fornite
Play fortnite
Ok  you lost no one will judge you and you need to come back stronger
KSI you lost that fight and you was hugging dude so much You got punched up in your forehead just take the slice of humble pie and move on
KSI !!! I was about to say that I miss your video HAHA… hope u doing well and keep positive bro.. We all behind you. Keep going forward and make us happy HAHAHA that’s all from me lol..
Ksi has always had a fragile ego
Tommy gonna live in this guys head for a while
No worry brother u fight well  Who are about win or loss  Your our winner dude  Respect 🔥🔥🔥
Iam being honest man, you only tried to knock out Tommy . But I am fan of you always ❤🎉
Ksi talks about the back of the head shots but forgets to mention his own corner was saying to him stay in the clinch so tommy hits back of the head and he loses another point ksi was planning to win this fight on point deductions and ppl still say he’s better than Jake 😂😂 if ksi wasn’t who he was he wouldn’t even be top 5 a lot of those misfit fighters would beat him bro didn’t wanna post because he didn’t wanna get memed he wanted to it die over I’m not surprised this ain’t a Reddit vid absolute joke of a fighter
Bit late mate - your fans waited for ages to hear, yet you have been filming and doing other stuff so clearly not important to you
Bruhh go rematch
JJ, everyone fails in life. It’s about just keeping on and getting back on the horse. But accepting defeat is key and you don’t seem like you ready to do that yet. If you get back in the gym and grind who says you don’t meet Tommy again at some stage, or Jake? A win over either would render this L in the rear view mirror. But just move on
JJ OLATUNJI!!!! STOP MAKING EXCUSES  YOU SHOULDVE HAD DISCIPLINE IN YOURSELF YET YOU TOOK L🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️💀💀💀💀
You lost bro just aceept it lmao
See tbh i never saw any of your matches (except the clip with logan paul). I thought why isn't he uploading then got to know about you're fighting tommy fury, saw the fight. I personally think you won cause there were rarely any sights of Tommy landing hits on you.  But still hope you win your next one. BTW have been waiting long for your videos bro, But tbh it was all good cause of the sidemen vids. Folabi did a great job. "I'm back, back again" 🤣🤣Loved it.
So basically this video is an excuse for not uploading got it
your the champ g! the fans know you won the fight! You will get tommy one day 🫡
Mate, take the L like a man. Enough whining
u won bro
😂😂😂😂  lol. Doing star jumps and having the boxing skill of a turd. Dude give it up.
Yeah you lost and quite sore loser.
The glazing is crazy
No hate but none of the two can really claim to be a winner of that goofy ahh bout.  However good to see KSI doin well. Hoping for some killer tunes next year!
You needed a humbling
KSL
“yes”, but who cares
Ur a winner bro. Ur a winner.❤
It’s better losing knowing you won  Then winning knowing you lost  . . . (This sounded better in my head)
KSI is the goat of YT he started all this shit 😤joe weller 2 no one would be doing all this shit without them both you don’t got like it but you got respect it 😈😈
Crying and not knowing how to lose at the age of 30 is crazy. Get over it. Can’t win in everything. He’s thinks he won when he LOST. Doesn’t matter if you last all rounds. 😂
Ksi talking about the fight was normal but when he switched to Tommy’s personal life that was a bit personal.
Poor response from JJ, really disappointing the lack of sportsmanship present here. I hope in future he will process this properly and just have a bit of humility, maturity and class like a true boxer. You lost mate your fans will still love you no matter how much your ego says you won.
And this is exactly why i stopped being a fan after 7+ years i don't have to explain myself this video speaks for itself.
This dude really just made a 9 min video claiming he won even tho he didn’t 😂😂
damn, this reminded me of those 2019 videos you did clowning on certain people
Embarrassing sore loser, just accept the loss like a man
Womp wompy...
Ksi becoming more disappointing by day
You lost 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I dont like you and honestly im sure you won the fight
I wishhh I fucking wishhh jj used the Nganou and Tyson fury fight as solid evidence that furys ain’t shit but riggers
Learning how to lose, and building yourself back up is one of the most important aspects of becoming great. You’ll be fine JJ. Good man💪🏼
Tbh jj i now hoe you feel bec once dreamed big playing football  I cried allot wnd fought allot with ny parents and shit was tuff at school But i never gave up And the day when i had ti let it go was very tuff but now im actually being more happy and playing rugby again To let stuff go is hard its really hard  But i think to let it go will help you allot to get close to your fam snd spend nore time eith the fam and friends  In my opinion you are very good  But i truly think you shoukd do you tube and music honestly ❤❤❤❤  Big love and i know you guys from 2013 so im not new  And i really want to see the old sideman again (2015) sideman  Just now and then bec most of the fans is OG Big love ❤❤
why the heck is this guy still going on about the fight? wasteman.
Pretty petty to encourage your fanbase to harass/berate tommy
Actually messed up telling the crazy 12 year old KSI stans to berate Tommy in public... As a fighter myself I understand that a loss can get under your skin. That sh*t really hurts your ego and it makes it seem like your months (years) of hard work were all for nothing. But to be a fighter you have to take a defeat and get back up again. You have to respect the people that step in the ring with you... When everything is all said and done you don't have to like your opponent but you have to show some kind of respect towards them. JJ's fanbase is huge, telling them to harass someone in public is actually mad. And judging someone you simply do not know for how they parent their kid/ spend time with their parter is also wild to me. Grow tf up JJ.
this editing is super distracting and annoying
Just love Jj's honesty
bro got robbed fr
L
But you lost to be fair
no reason too say allat bout his family lmaooo, idgaf tho ride or die wit ksi
KSI u know u won we know u won the world knows uve won so dont feeel down were proud of how far uve come
I know your to big to sit there replying to messages but bro you know you won we all know you won the deffs new you won but can’t give it to you because he’s meant to be the pro boxer. It’s rigged and the same thing happened in the Francis and Tyson fight.. is what it is
first half of video is jj just flexing about how great he is and how many things he did this year. Nobody cares dude make some contenet.   edit: i commented this after watching first half. I was wrong, the whole video is him flexing and saying how great he is and how much better than tommy he is. Like fr dude, ego through the rooff
SO DID YOU LOSE OR WIN I NEED AN ANSWER
This fight feels like ancient history now
You took a bigger L with your lack of sportsmanship in this video than by actually losing the fight JJ..  didn’t expect this from you
You lost
took way too long for this to come out. you lost the fight bro its clear
When this coming idk what to say but tried lacking that thing because you need that thas why you need to work harder because you aint hard enough I’m done yapping thanks😊
You Lost . You’re 30 sounding like a Fortnite kid when he doesn’t win.
welcome back
You sore loser bum! (Said with Tommy Fury accent)
I forgot he fought 😂😂😂
Good to see you back mate 💪💪
I fuck with KSI but you can’t say you don’t care and make vid about the situation lol. Stop hating on dude having a good time just cus you’re upset dawg you too successful for that lol
I just thought it was a poor fight in general
KSI dub
Bro just straight up acts like a 10 yr old who lost a game ☠️ take the loss like a man
wah wah wah wah 😭😭😭😭😭
is the rematch a thing?
Bro move on you clearly lost the fight, get over it. You were never going to win.
confirmation bias much? what a terrible loser and person he has become
You still lost lil bro 🐿️
Come on man, trash Tommy's performance that night all you want (as he rightfully should, that night wasn't a pro boxer performance) but don't trash his personal life. That just shows that you are petty. Just keep doing what you want, boxing, music, YouTube, Sidemen.
Man give it up
King ksi ❤
Now I know why I stopped watching Ksi mf weird and fake
Welcome back fatneek😂
You just come across as a salty prick in this video. Taking a dig at Tommy and his kid? That's a low blow, thought you were better than that...
gone from a legend to a true flop
Lol
Look i still don't think Tommy fury won, judges robbed you
Konichiwa 🎉
Hahah funny I love u but u a hug bear when u fight
Wtf is this shit?
The cope is amazing, ksi needs to get over it😂😂😂what a man child
I forgot he lost tbh 😂
I’m glad you’re back man 🙂
My god grow up you are 30! This is ridiculous!
You lost. This video was pointless take the loss like a man and move on
Tommy lost
We still love u
After all the ways you could have handled this, this aint it champ getting your viewers to harrass him is a 🤡 move
I've loved JJ since I was a young teen and I've never seen him like this. I know what it's like to lose something that has so much meaning to you. And you think you did everything you could, or you did nothing wrong. But the worst end scenario comes to fruition no matter how hard you tried to stop it. It put me in a sad, lonely miserable place for many years. I only recently started feeling different. like days recently.
KSI if we’re being honest, your true supporters don’t really care about the “loss”. We are proud of you & how far you’ve come anyway
Man this guy is a goat
You lost. You mentioning to your fans to berate Tommy if they see him in public proves that Tommy did more than beat you. He humbled & destroyed your ego. You did better than anyone thought you would. Give it up and keep your grind, we all fail at several points in life.
Listen , he made entertaining videos at one point and still does to some extent today , but we can all agree that the fight was nothing like a fight should be, it was a hugfest....i know its natural to try and defend oneself but put a cork in it...nobody watched him for boxing content...just move along Plus the whole harass him in public and shit is just pure brainrot....he will probably say that it was joke and shit...but cmon , he should know what that would make some fans do...pure mental retardation and showing how out of touch he really is...sad
Na you lost take the L like a man and stop crying about it
Why are you mentioning the guy's baby for? Huge L JJ
This is a lot of “I did this, I did that, so that means I win…..”   Get the fuck out of here we all saw that shit. As you play clips you saved of Tommy 🤦🏻‍♂️ This video’s pathetic, you lost KSI… so do we believe professional judges or a random YouTuber.. yeaaaaa
Was waiting for this vid :)
See, i dont think KSI lost the fight, but he didnt win either. The performances between him & Fury were atrocious. Fury's disappointing cuddle parties ruined the fight & the fact that KSI fell for it EVERY time is just as bad.
bro even the judges at the end of the fight said ''i think KSI won the fight'' honest opinion i think fury got lucky with the score or ksi got robbed god knows KSI performed very well anyway
Bro worked so hard just to jump on the ring and hug tommy what a chad
As true fan of KIS, we don't really care he loss but the fact that he doesn't want to move on is what we fans are angry about. Sometime you have to accept the defeat, accepting that and moving is what most important. And from this Video i don't think he has accepted that. Hope he can have somemore time to get out of this.❤
Madd that rhey added the clip of THE ELBOW😂😂
😂😂😂
Bro made a video after a whole month.  If You lost the fight, the world is not going to end. So cheer up, everyone learns from their mistakes.
Bros 30 acting like this 😂😂
He didnt cover the hugging tho lmao
Love you man ❤️
What a loser
Bro Finally posted man!!!!
bro needs to learn that no one really cares you lost bro
i feel like you should just be self satisfied knowing that you did better than him
My inspiration ❤️
It's to get Hyper !!! Do it proper
W
such a bad look on ksi, still can’t take the loss. he has to shit talk his opponent for other random things to make himself feel better 🤣
KSI actually can’t lose. He has somehow managed to turn this “loss” into a win.
Whether you won or lost it was a lame performance
Tommy furry love island season one..dude can't cook
Whether you won or lost it was a lame performance
Bro it’s been 50 days, no one care who won. Just move on to make videos or not
You 100000% lost that ‘fight’ fair and square. Abysmal performance from the two of you!
Love ya, jj.
He beat you 😂😂
ksi needs to tell us whats next wif the boxing. jakey booooooi
THATS WHY HES THE GOAT… THE GOOAAAT
and this is where the fame goes to youtubers heads.... the money the ego...
don’t worry abt the loss man get back on ur feet and work hard bro ur my inspiration 😊
You didn’t win…. Point blank.
damn straight tommy u need to rematch this man. the world believes you lost
KSI won the hugging contest! Well done champ!
Agreed
Cry
Them star jumps defo should have got you the win 😂😂😂
yea u won man . dont sweat it bruv
ksi be honest with yourself, you didn't win it, you clearly lost
Ksi win or lose I still care about you my guy 👍
Look KSI, You gave a decent attempt.. but Tommy Fury did win.. it was close tho.. but he did definetly win.
it's not that you lost  we don't care about results it just was a shitt show performance from both  not entertaining at all and not on the level of training you both got
The real loser is Tommy who almost lost to a youtuber
Bro shut up. You lost, get over it
We are SO proud of you no matter what the appeal says. You came such a long way and I cant wait to see your fight with Jake Paul. You got this 💪🏽
Very good video minus the saltiness abt Tommy at the end. Still crazy how far JJ has come.
No more hate needed for others now, jj...have peace...❤
❤❤❤❤
Honestly I needed this video today, you really showed me no matter who I am or where I came from, I can make it and do what I want in life, these past couple days been hell but ima keep pushing, thank you ❤️🙏
Tommy humbled you and still you cry about it
I’m glad the commission upheld the decision it was the right call JJ. It was not a robbery.
Hey it's alright, you can't have the wins without the losses.
KSI will forever be known as a low budget illuminati industry plant society takes seriously
its ok ksi we still i love you
You lost bro, no offence but that starjump shit you were doing was awesome for round 1 but then that being the only thing you did was hard to pick you as the winner.
When egos are broken the real true person in themselves comes out I fw you Ksi but this is not a good way to take a L no excuses bounce back don’t cry don’t complain come back better
7:56 you lost me at this point, I think this is gonna come back to haunt you
No shit.
❤❤
ayo why is he still salty about the loss? why does he need to diss his child and stuff?
It is more of tommy fury lost the fight than ksi winning
To be fair JJ does have a point, Tommy is just making a fool of himself out in public, go look after your kid! It’s embarrassing that he even calls himself a professional boxer. Let’s shame and berate this cuck! We got your orders Chief 🫡🫡🫡
At least the not delusional ones who watched the fight knows what the true outcome was, and just like they did Francis they also robbed u.
Fuck me that man literally mentally broke you 🤣
Dont say u shook the world bro. 🥰
Yeah many people thought you won the fight because eveybody in social media is your friend JJ
Still in denial after losing. Big L
You lost. Clean and Simple. Just move on without making excuses. Tommy was always gonna be the favourite against you. But you pinched above your weight. Be proud of it. No need to whine about the result now. You will always have the support of your millions of loyal fans in whatever you do. It was just one fight.
your are a king❤
Thank you for coming out with the video. But it's time..... not for your legacy but for the legacy of YouTube boxing. You versus Jake Paul ASAP
W KS-US
Bruh adesaniya is prime ambassador
I'll give it to you G, I also think you won the fight but I can clearly see you are losing the warriors spirit your mental was better when you fought logan even if ur skills r better now you have lost that killer. I can see it in your eyes you have gone soft, If you had the same spirit I'm sure you would have KO'd him and this wouldn't be a thing but Still come back stronger G.
Tbh bro u did lose, and even if you did we dont care just work hard and keep fighting
This is your “im moving on from the fight” video
Can we just appreciate how JJ keeps trying to remind us that hard work is the only answer, and that innate talent isn’t necessary for success. He could’ve been like other influencers who are talented but egotistic, yet he chooses to show that he can afford to have an ego because he puts in the work. It’s really impressive to see someone like him in the spotlight.
Embarrassing
i wouldve appreciated it if he just took the loss on the chin and set an example for people that you can come back from a loss, but this childish shit makes him seem entitled
So are u done fighting??
Just take the "L". 👀. And pursue a rematch, if it means that much to you. 🤦‍♂️. No one really cares, BUT you. Why bring attention to Fury, otherwise.? 🤔.
He broke you homie, delusional af.
To those calling him a clown for how he acted post-fight with his sportsmanship. . .   He had a mic shoved into his face 3 times (and put onto a stage for 2 of them) directly after a controversial loss where months of hard work seemingly went down the drain to an arsehole like Tommy Fury. KSI believed that he'd won that fight with every fiber of his being. To get that turned upside down, especially so controversially? that's f-d.   What some r calling child behavior is also just the passion of a competitor.  I dare you to not act out in frustration after seeing something you've worked so hard towards get pissed away. Don't lie; everyone acts out in some way or another, under extreme circumstances. The difference being, you get to act out that frustration in the luxury of privacy. He didn't get that. As the headlining promotor, main card competitor, and misfits/youtube influencer, he had no privacy in those moments after the fight.    Don't wonder why he acted the way he did then, or crucify the guy for being human and being in denial of the loss.  Tho it is dumb for him to say to clown on tommy still after 3 months.
Ksi promoting cyber bullying
Love ya man stay safe!
Great Vid. BTW i got ur spotify wrapped message
bro you lost. take it. all you did was hug
Ksi, you didn't win the fight either. You barely did well that entire fight. At best, it should have been a draw and if you're pushing it, maybe a win for you. I like your content JJ, but that was the most boring fight I've ever watched from you and that's saying about you being "the best version" of yourself at the time. This is my honest opinions
Bro just except your loss💀
Mate you lost, get over it. Plastering loads of clips of people saying you should’ve won doesn’t change anything, the decision is final. This shit is embarrassing, you have to put someone else down to make yourself feel better. Take the loss like a man and move on.
🥛
Bro ksi you got your shit FOLDED
You lost fair and square. All you did the entire fight was hug tommy fury. If you count that as a win then you need to retire from boxing forever.
WE WANT TO SEE U FIGHT JAKE BUT WE LOVE U MAN the “loss” didn’t mean shit we proud of u for what u have done   And the memories u gave us as kids man w ksi but again we really wanna see u beat jake brother love from the USA 🇺🇸
i mean jj has been playing fifa for years and is still trash at the game 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️ same situation with tommy in boxing 🤣
I really dislike KSI. I wanted him to lose to Tommy bad. I was excited for it even. What I watched tho was in my opinion, KSI definitely won, and there’s no way I can see how he lost considering the point deduction. So congratulations on the win KSI even if they didn’t give it to you it’s obvious you put in the work.
Man fuck them everybody want you to man up man up its just a loss bro but they wasnt in there they dont know that u really won that fight i would bash tommy fury boxing and talk my shit because u did beat the fuck outta tommy fury $WillYear12
I love JJ but just let it go
Pfff win or lose there was only one thing crystal clear.... Both of you aren't boxers. Both of you were a joke. At least you aren't claiming to be an actual boxer, Tommy on the other hand does. He's not. Him claiming you should go back to YouTube was a laugh. He should stay on shows like love island or whatever braindead show he came from and never be associated with boxing ever again.
I kinda wish he got knocked out. Now it’s the same thing as jake where “he’s boxed since he was 5 and i’m a YoUtUbeR and he couldn’t knock me out” grow tf up
To the kids whining about him not getting over it. You didnt watch the video, he is extremely humble and understanding in this video.
As a Man you should Stop whining. You lost you lost Simple
bro y tf u getting into someone's personal life just cause u lost a fight with him. damn bro grow up
you need to delete this vid brothaman
nah bruv you lost
This is just sad , just move on bro
Waiting for the follow up video of him admitting he took an L already.
As I suspected the snowflakes have rushed to the comments.
😂❤
Proud of JJ regardless. Win or lose you gave it your all and that’s why your fans love you. 👏
Bro you are the winner and we sll know that.. That's it. Doesn’t metter what the judges said they are son's of bi*ches😜
Man should just accept his bad at boxing.
Jj always makes anything funny even a lost
The untouchable god KSI now relies on his teenager fans to harass someone to make him feel better. You're acting pathetic. take a loss
Find Solitude JJ
I am proud of you champ ❤ You are an inspiration
Much love from the Philippines JJ, we  will always be proud of you, WIN or LOSE you're always a winner in our eyes, much love brother.
took you long enough!
Ngl.. The result was kind of like the manny pacman vs may weather fight
shame on you, publicly asking your audience to harass someone
Let it go this is embarrassing
bro waited this long to say ''i lost'' bvro we knowww!
The fight you had with Tommy kinda reminded me of the Tyson Fury decision win. Your main advantage in boxing is speed, whereas Ngannou's is power. Francis trained his absolute heart out, and should've won the fight, but because it was a close fight the judges just decide to give it to the "more traditional boxer", which I find stupid.
Ngl frogot u lost unit now
You are a winner JJ that's for sure.  I feel you it's so fucking hard to accept defeat especially you know in yourself that you've won but that's life.  Life humbles you in the ways you don't like.  Much Respect for you JJ.
maybe boxing just isn’t your thing bro, you lost fair and square
Maybe you need to rewatch the fight....😮
L bro you lost
Hey jj get ur head right man i think the loss really messed you up i think u need to take some time away from all this shit regardless of if u won or lost i think u should just move on instead of taking shots at Tommy i mean its his life u shouldn't be talking about his parenting and telling ur fans to blast him off on social media i hope you snap out of this and come back stronger 💪❤
Sollallahu 'ala Muhammad. Bismillah
Next video: laughing at KSI
Oh, hey, is it August already?
Ghurl, stop glazing. You've already have four insecurities on your body, don't add an external one
asking your fanbase to go after tommy and clowning social media posts is a bit petty
just dont quit boxing until you’ve fought jake paul, cuz if u stop boxing now without fighting jake its basically a slap in the face to fans
Hahahaha loser😂😂😂😂😂😂
L
You won 🎉
Fury bought those judges because he knew that was the ONLY way he could win. #Furysucksdonkeyballs
This was just long over due Man U need it broski 🙏🏽🙏🏽
I don't even think off ski robbed and judges cucked him I see ksi as the winner still undefeated, ksi won its fucking clear
All love here ksi I don't think you deserve all of the hate that childish people are giving you I think you won you don't need to stress your self for us have a good day. Fatneek
Bruised ego
bro i want to watch some fucking reddit videos
Take the L fam. We were never invested in you because of boxing maybe even in spite of boxing ❤
<3
Sore loser.
WHATEVER HAPPENS IM ALWAYS SUPPORT U JJ! U INSPIRED ME A LOT! MY LIFE BECOME BETTER AND BETTER BECAUSE OF UR POSITIVE SPREADNESS AND YOUR WORK ETHIC IS CRAZY AMAZING!!
Take your time to recover, but don't get too comfortable. Train like you are still in camp, because Jake will be, and that fight between you two was written in the stars
I know that this video is supposedly saying you're taking the loss, but if you truly had come to peace with it you wouldn't start this video with a compilation video. Your true fans are still gonna be here for you man, losing is a part of being human. Sorry if this comment comes across as overly negative, and i don't know if it's your editor's idea to stitch clips together, but you do not come across as sincere, and it's absolutely poor sportsmanship. What Tommy's doing shouldn't concern you, the fights over.
lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
Bro took a whole month and a half to stop crying about it I was expecting this video the day right after the fight but it's good to see that he's in good spirits now
this comment section turning into twitter is sad lmao, if you got time out of your day to hate then you really just must have a pretty garbage life. I think jj won and that's about it what he said in this video is done don't care about it too much
Let's be real both cant box lmao
Ya i was hoping he would just accept the loss at this point, but dude is literally doing what Logan did against him. sad to see
lmao I am a fan but this amount of crying and whining... and telling fans to harrass him? dude he won get over it you sore loser
Yeah we know.
Finally, damn J, was waiting for you to post. Happy to see you back on my guy! 🤞🏼
Nah he won look at the stats
Yea so u got shit on buddy 😭
Be a man, accept that you lost
JJ time to face the truth. Don’t be petty & a sore loser, you lost to the better boxer. Pay your respects and move on to the next challenge.
Nuh Tommy probably paid the judges that fight was bogus and u won its a straight clear shot that was easily proven that you had won
Loooooooser
all the haters in these comments are jake paul fan girls who get hard at the mention of jakes name so lmao this loss aint shit.
Love JJ, but keep the kid and baby momma out of it. Coming off a little Dillon Dannis
tommy fury should retire or he should man up and go fight viddal riley
Nahhh we will love you anyway tho😂
Fight Jake you both lost to the same person there’s no excuse anymore
Only a delusional person would say u won it 😂
KSI posted before GTA 6
jj saying the fathering stuff like he was preparing himself
Everyone will complain about how JJ can't accept this or whatever but why should he accept a decision that wasn't real. JJ at least got a draw.
🧂
I love bro but I think he needed this lowkey, glad to see Ksi still doing great though mentally
why is bro still shit talking tommy
what a legend.
so weak
Very lame to see you stoop down to this level. You lost or you didn't, doesn't matter. You can't send people to berate others on the internet, ESPECIALLY if said person has a child.
“I feel like I’ve come out of it better” 🤓 Blud is obsessed about it about a month later 💀
KSI MY IDOLO 🔥 🐐
Just accept the loss bro. It was a loss, clear as day
🤔why is ksi worried about another man after losing and saying he doesn’t care. Get his meat outta your mouth sir😂
So proud of you JJ, keep doing you KING
Bros so mad
You’ve come so far man, win or lose you are the champion in our eyes ❤
No matter the outcome you still lost
Yo bro I’ve been a fan since god knows when. we still support you if it’s a win or lose and we’ll still support through anything and enjoy your content . I thought you won but if u handled that a more classy way Tommy’s a family man I don’t think he deserves to be attacked. Don’t let it get you down JJ
sore loser
Another day  another victory for jj
JJ, forget all that... TIME FOR REDDIT REACTS !!!!
Ready to see James Earle with Misfits 🥊
BOXING IS LAME NOW TIME TO MOVE ON BRUDDA WE DONT WANT ANOTHER ONE !!!
This a yap session right here
Jj welcome back! We're very proud of you! And I'm really glad you had a good break but damn I missed you and I'm sure I'm not the only one!
Yes... you lost 😅 why you even appealed that is beyond me. Wasted people's time and money to even think you won that fight lol.
So we can agree Jake is the better boxer? He has more wins and has versed better opponents ksi's only argument was he's undefeated
Winner Celebrating Loser Explaining   LMFAO
Take some Ls but walk around like you was undefeated
Bruda !!!! Where is the memes ????
JJ, imma keep it a buck with you. Attacking a man’s character after losing unanimously is outright immature. Not to mention sending your fans to harass him. Your lack of sportsmanship is crazy. A lot of fans will genuinely lose respect for you if you keep acting in this manner.
Took your time
Now I understand why you and Logan are such Best friend.... What a shame
There is nothing wrong with ksi and his team believing he won, but this video is a disgrace.  Like please JJ grow up and control your ego for 5 minutes. You still can be confident in yourself and the things you have done while also being humble and rational. You lost me when you started telling us to harass Tommy. I'm not a fan of Tommy, but he doesn't deserve that.  You really took a month off to come here and be a c**t
🔥🔥🔥
For fucks sake jj. Your abysmal sportsmanship will be the end of your career. Just accept the loss dude.
KSI, you truly did deserve that win, but that fight was ultimately HORRIBLE to watch. You can blame Tommy, and he can blame you, but in reality - it’s on both of you guys for that performance. Shame you were robbed from that win though.
Your boxing style shit, JJ. Those who say isn't, are your Yes Men circles. You can't do long shot punch all the time. Where the close range combination ? ... none. Your style worked against non-pro-boxer because you can launch quick & strong punches. But against pro-boxer, even low reputation like Tommy Fury, you'll exposed cause they train to defending such punches. No need try to sh-t on Tommy Fury, he's never been a good boxer, his brother are. Take the L and learn proper boxing, JJ.
Bro I dont even care about the match anymore I’m just happy you’re back
Bro cant even take a lose, bro you are humbled by tommy
win or lost does not matter anyway , the fight was shit and the event a huge dissapointment
Tommy pumped you, get over it
The video with Tommy fury and Chris brown looks so photoshopped 😂😂😂
lmao you were mad confident for what.
Bro needs to get a reality check FAST. You lost the fight and need to learn from that, but using your big influence to harass Tommy isn’t gonna cut it man😔
❤
Ngl, you've lost but you're just coping at this point, the reason I subscribed to you was because you took shit like a man, now you clearly don't. Chill and move on with life...
You lost buddy
I guess he shocked the world in a way
Bro KSI get over it real fighters lose and get better
I’m surprised you didn’t use the clip of him smoking weed with chris brown even tho he wants a fight with Roy jones jr even tho it takes anywhere up to 6 months to leave your system 🤔😂
Well if mighty gaming said it. Might be true. But Tommy was good too
Love you man. Always with you 💪🏼
❤❤
Love you bro bro but take the L with grace, calm the ego down.
Stop being salty bruh
You lost ?
L
You got robbed don’t worry anyways love you
Bro it was your event and promotion how did tommy get saved by the judges you handpicked them and you still didn't win you just mostly hug your a sore loser needing to berate a person you lost too kind of sad coming from a person with a bunch of excuses
Lmaooo you lost fair and square
USA Pro Boxer here. 8-1, 10th fight in February. Stop making fuc*in excuses and get over it. Move on. Continue your journey for health and mind, not clout. You need friends who are real like this with you, so go find some.   Other than that, good seeing you back on Youtube.
Your a fucking legend JJ
❤
After all these days u learned nothing... Still the same crybaby . Take the L and move on.. take it like a man... God jake is more matured than u . Like bruhh get back to old content. Miss those vids man... Just dont be a soy boy smh 🤦
Ahhhh finally jj don't worry bro sometimes we win sometimes we lose...you already won our heart man you are the champ..
I love KSI but this is the man who laughed at Logan for appealing and losing but even Logan accepted his loss better than this. Atleast he didn't tell his fans to berate JJ in the public.
I mean he said “it’s time to shock the world” what did he expect, but fr, to see he lost and how he took it was shocking
I mean you was hugging a bunch so that’s the only reason you got past every round
probably the worst fight i have ever witnessed, all you both did was to hug eachother. total shitfest
fr he needs to be around his kid more
tommy is ur daddy
u lost haha
You’re still good bro keep your head up. You still good in the eyes of me and your other true fans. Eventually, I want to see that anger in the Ksi vs Jake Paul fight.
This ain’t it lil bro
The result while perhaps unfair is still the result. Proud of what you've achieved regardless of result but harden up and be the bigger man bro
I prefer the loss because you have come back down to earth
LEGACY
KSI L 🤡
KSI ROBBED FR ITS ALL GOOD BRUDDA GET HIS ASS FROM BEHIND
You won that all day..
Lets go jj 😂
Get humbled wanna be boxer 🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡
He doesn’t even ask for a rematch in the video man all you’re doing is crying Tommy broke you and you don’t even think you can beat him
Bro is salty af
Im just glad he's posting again
Why you make A video of this I don’t care bro just make video regular video,win or lose I don’t care man
🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉
When is appeal gonna happen
I literally just searched up ksi and he is finally back
Lilmaxkid is retiring😢
6:20 beat you jj cmon
WSI
He won bro
win or lose you are our fatneek 💗
KSI u were the real winner that night
Bro u lost and the same shit that Logan did back in ur guys fight is the same thing ur doing now man just take the L and stop stalking him
You lost last 3 rounds
Why is jj ignoring all the comments people have made about him hugging the whole time and acting like “the whole world knows I won”
so last august 🙄
What a sore loser 😂
Lol he went after TF's personal Life for no reason.. yeah KSI is still tilted lmfaoooooo
Truly showing his “integrity” with this one telling his fans to berate tommy.
Only the fans lost.
You lost, they didn't take anything away from you 😂
Stop bitching man I miss the old ksi from 2016 to 2019
Diss track season again?
No bro you lost for real .
Tommy won
JJ ik u know u won bru 😂🤣shu dumb af but ykk
ksi goat
KSI you won 100%  Cheers to you !! All the best deserved
lol Tommy really broke KSI mentally. Stop thinking about him and move on with your life. And really childish to tell your fans it's OK to bother Tommy. lol grow up and accept your defeat
Who’s Tommy fury? 🤷🏻‍♀️
Bro i just love you and dont even care about the fight but there's just one thing I'd like to say bro Whenever you have these kinds of encounter Act like a God damn devil not like an Anime Character just this one thing and also Learn Mike tysons way of boxing it will help you end fights More faster  peace ✌️
R.I.P Lilmaxkid's career
Who the fuck edited this video. Way too much going on in the background.
You did shock the world,shocked the world with how much hugging could happen in a boxing match
Crazy bro u still smashed it
bro decided to come back
we still love you, you embarrased tommy, you are the goat
Don't be a sore loser. No need to comment on Tommy's post
Use the like button just for make sure Tommy Fury knows how trash he is: || || v
I like you jj, but maybe don't tell your fans to keep attacking tommy on his insta pics, irl, etc... That doens't paint a good picture
Ksi won but hey
7:06 - 8:01 Damn that's just low.
aye, even tho ksi lost and cried and kicked a tv, he has absolutely all of my respect, good shit champ
have always loved kai’s videos. but just leave tommy fury alone now 🤣 it’s becoming a bit boring now
jj b standing on bidness, still no respect towards tommy -338/365
He didn't win but neither did you
Maybe he paid the judges
You can’t rip on Tommy your technique in the fight was shit your like 30 years old still crying about loosing a month after
Take all the breaks u want king. U are him and u help so many people. Thank you
i dont think you can talk about him being a bad father , you lost but in trying to derail tommy only use his boxing records and related things , please dont talk about family .
Most people that thought you won were your fans and mma fans/fighters. You did good but just take the L and improve
Bro's been grinding for 7 years, we dont mind if u take a little break
KSI won the match (in terms of respect and motivation)
He’s got to let Tommy go, he can’t ask us to bully Tommy, be the better man, say his peace and chill after his hard work. We know he should have won’t but bullying Tommy will achieve nothing. If it was to gear a rematch, cool I guess but no need to bully.
It was a shit fight no one won
Whether you won, lose, or draw... the impact you gave all the fans, the haters, even with the people who don't know much about you is already huge. You are an inspiration to most people, you are a living testament and have proved that hard work, grindset, and a balanced time with family and friends is the perfect mix to achieve a hell of a dream... kudos bro
JJ I have been watching you since your fifa videos, been watching you and the Sidemen for years but bro bringing up his personal life and telling your fans to attack him is just low man. All over a boxing match bro you'll be over it in a year is it really that deep for you to do and say the stuff you have? And to call Tommy embarrassing yet you were shouting 'i hate losing' and kicking the wall when you lost 😂 you took it too far when it wasn't even needed you need to chill
He shook the world Just in a different way.
YouTube era coming soon 🔥🔥🔥
Y’all can go against him about Tommy, for me I just wanna see drama😈😈😂
ahh i love you jj
bro finally, lowk needed that humble you were becoming so corny 😊
KSI beat Tommy Fury VIA hugging
Damn jj really kinda turned into a whiney woo woo at the end there
Bro you hard lost lol 2 more rounds and your knocked out
sore loser😭
Tommy is being a REAL NIGHTMARE for this guy
Honestly this guys boxing style sucks to watch. Tommy also sucks but I really just want to see KSI lose at this point because of how boring your fighting style is on top of your saltiness
Will you box again
Why people so mad? Like this video wasn’t even bad, so what did he say to berate Tommy like that’s nothing 💀
Lmao
Use as a proud of JJ button
You should sue and take PPA to court
Myyy G is backk aiyoooooooo
Dude just cannot take his loss like a man, give it up buddy and accept it.
I didn't even know who Tommy furry was until you and jake
You still rock dude.
The return of the king!!
#ksi jake said that because he is scared😂he don’t want to fight you but I believe you won
You have got robbed JJ you won 😢😢
ass editing
all these sensitive sally's in the comments lmfao so triggered over the smallest stuff, it was just a passing comment jeez. what's happened to the world
You lost cry abt it
Bruh I see people complaining about this video on Reddit and shit. I finally watch it and see they either were blowing it out of proportion or straight up lying lmao. There is nothing wrong with this video
Thats my winner right there!!!
Nah, you'd win.
The wait is real 😭
Honest it was an ass performance mate, the confidence was way too much. Put your hands up
I mean I was rooting for you brother, but I just didn’t get the game plan. You should have won the fight but I really think if you box again especially for like a fight against like Jake, you should get back with viddal and start working the basics.
i hope the fight between jake and ksi happens in 2024
It wasn’t a close fight Ksi, u got embarrassed
brudda ive been wating u since u and i was kids and u was a teen, the things youve accomplished, trust me brother dust urself up cause in all our eyes u truly won and honestly we dont care u took the L OFF DECISION, u could retire right now and be forever goated and live on for centuries
His cope level is over 9000!
Man is still so salty it’s unbelievable. Going after his kid is bad enough, now sending his ‘fans’ to harass him online and irl. Dude, grow up. It doesn’t matter if you think you won or lost, it’s how you have acted since that makes people dislike you. I’m a fan of Sidemen KSI. But this KSI is unbearable.
I think it's pretty obvious that judges didn't let you win. It would have put a huge shadow over pro boxers if an entertainer beat the actual fighter. If only you could knock him out they wouldn't have a leg to stay in their decision.
Attacking his personal life and weaponizing your audience is a huge L tbh
I thought he took the loss well, but now I see hes still super triggered over it. That last bit was unnecessary . Clearly tommy is still in his head since hes been keeping up w everything hes been doing publicly. Dissapointed jj.
Proper L video. It takes a man to accept a loss gracefully and this was not it.
failure is also an important part in the journey towards excellence and success
Copium at its best
Chill beo
Cmon jj I support you and been watching you forever now but just let it go.. he doesn’t have to ko you to still be a winner no matter the experience, it’s not embarrassing.. just move on and work for Jake Paul that’s all you can do cause I want his career ended and you can end your boxing career happily after that w😂
🗿
Konnichiwa to you as well 😂
where's the baldski
you can’t win a boxing fight clinching after every punch u throw, you looked like a scared little boy Ksi. Jake Paul stood toe to toe and countered tommy multiple times. And Jake knocked tommy down. You got out boxed, maybe don’t clinch 70 times in ur next fight bozo
This video seems way more like you trying to convince yourself that you losing doesnt burn you inside. Random digs at Tommy as a parent and telling your fans to harrass him in public.....you need therapy bro.
Win or lose we still proud of u jj. You are doing things most people would only think or talk about doing
Life isnt about winning beleive it or not.
I forgot about that fight lmao bro disappeared cause he didn’t want to get roasted
U got robbed my bro
YOU LOST CLEARLY
Cope
I found one of your'e videos about 2 years ago and i was drawn to your'e worth ethic, your'e humor, and personality. You got me into boxing and gave me a new perspective on life. Thank you for never giving up on music and boxing and youtube. Your an inspiration to us all and maybe i'll get to meet you one day . Were proud of what you have accomplished and can't wait for the years to come. Thank you KSI
U keep losing
He looks broke tbh
Like how everyone was roasting him now the comments like Win or lose true fans wont care proper lick arses
I’ve always loved Jj and I’m a Ksi fan but this is not cool to attack him like that ksi is cool but what he says sometimes isnt
Im just happy that you gonna make more videos 🩷
We know you loss bruh 😂😂 stick to YouTube
jj your energy was missing for so long bro just bring the fatneek back he has the jj energy 😁
big fan but no one is going to write on his shit that he lost apart from salty teenagers, tommy won its okay
I don't get it! KSI looks like a fuckin BEAST in training and in sparring but when he steps into the square, all that goes out the window and his stance just changes. Dude turns into a fuckin wet noodle, hopping all over the place. No wonder you're gassed well into the 3rd or 4th round. Mans wasting a lot of energy hopping in place like he's a character in a select screen and throwing heavy hits hoping at least one will connect. An opponent that knows what they're doing isn't going to open themselves up to any hits when you keep trying to throw slugs at them every time you throw a punch. I get this is mainly for a bag, but why not go into a fight looking like an actual fighter. JJ has heart 100% no doubt, but that won't get you far if you aren't coming with the knowledge needed. But he still did better than Tommy, who's a "professional" boxer by the way.
Honestly we don't really care that you "lost" that fight JJ, all I know is that I'm on of your biggest fans and supporters and regardless your still one of my favorite youtubers cus of all the amazing and entertaining videos you make with the sidemen 🙏
Win or loose as most the comments are saying true KSI fans don’t care but obvsly all that hard work to get that result its normal to be upset etc but again your living proof this ‘nerdy fifa kid’ gets back to grinding and leaving the legacy u have been and continue to do. You have accomplished a lot of things in life and proud of your journey and giving us living proof u can do Anything. Truly Inspirational. Peace and blessing to one the and only JJ KSI! What a 🐐
FAM ALL YOU DID WAS HUGGING...GTFO
I've loved JJ since I was a young teen and I've never seen him like this. I know what it's like to lose something that has so much meaning to you. And you think you did everything you could, or you did nothing wrong. But the worst end scenario comes to fruition no matter how hard you tried to stop it. It put me in a sad, lonely miserable place for many years. I only recently started feeling different. like days recently.
Like if you know who Lilmaxkid is?
This guy is embarrassing… keep crying and making excuses about your clear loss like a little sore loser
Your hardwork is enough for you to inspire anyone who watches you :)
Why should we feel bad for you? Weren't you paid like 10m to essentially just hug a guy for 6 rounds?
About time
Come on man JJ, I get that you are angry, but why bring up personal shit? Especially calling him a shitty dad? You are better than this. I swear to God, handing around LA fuck boys completely cooked JJ's brain and morals.
This is really pathetic to be telling your fans to Harrass him and criticising him  as a parent, grow up, and handle your loss like a man
Get over it
JJ still hasn’t gotten over the loss (which was not rigged btw), Why would a fight on misfits which KSI himself owns be rigged against him? Also it wasn’t a robbery. It was too close a call to be considered a robbery. And he’s wanting people to berate Tommy fury in public?  Accept the loss and move on JJ, sometimes appealing is just wasting your own time. Life isn’t meant to be fair and it’s true in all sports. Tommy Fury has moved on at this point.  If you’re continuing your boxing into 2024 then good luck against Jake Paul or whoever. If you lose again, don’t send your fan base to attack your opponents online. That is just plain childish. Plus how do you think the other person (that you send your fanbase after) will respond? Your appeal was denied, move on, don’t waste any more time trying to appeal.  On the one hand I’m glad JJ’s uploading again but he handled the loss poorly and it’s been only a month but one month should be enough to process how things went down. And he’s 30 years old (a couple years older than I am) and yet he’s having a tantrum over losing a boxing match one to two months on. No one likes losing but try not to act like a child. And telling people to harass Tommy online is too far and the comments about Tommy’s fatherhood and general personal life, why should you bring that up? One more thing JJ, please keep your ego in check. I still like watching you but people are getting turned off of you, because of the way you’re handling the loss and your ego.  I know people will bash me for this but I don’t care. Someone (and I’m not the only one thankfully) needed to point out what JJ’s doing wrong.
You’re so salty bro lmao grow up
Love you JJ glad you took a break, you should do it more often for your mental health. But also glad to see you <3
HUMBLED
What a sore loser. Imagine that. Maybe you’re more like Jake Paul than you think
please db legends opening
Ok everyone stop the meat riding for 5 seconds. We all support JJ but going into Tommy's personal life, calling him a shitty father, unfaithful and sending the fanbase to harass his socials is something I just absolutely cannot approve of, and neither should you.  I think JJ got robbed too but throwing a tantrum and acting bitter is NOT the way. Please be level headed with how you approach things going forward JJ and take a break if you need it because from where I'm standing this isn't you.
Blud gained some weight 💀
couldn’t care less if ya lost tbh😂
He’s finally back on his own chanel. Just gotta say we all see what happened with ngannou. You’re just a part of the fury robbery timeline. But for you it’s just your time to create your own. Big up to you
you didnrt win guy  edit: did he just say life aint fair wtf lmao
Oo Im sad, my dad hates me, I won, where’s the content bruv?
Bruh it’s been so long I forgot he lost
At the end of the day regardless of result you proved what you needed to prove that night. Anyone who says different has never been in a position where they had to fight tooth and nail for something.
Sorry jj the fight was shit and thats the truth no one won both hugged earned money and went home so pls stopping sobbing the only ones who lost were the audience and their money
Mate you did lose I feel this vid was all about excuses
Tommy really broke this man mentality and still can’t take the L.  Rough
You lost stay mad LSI
Look how far he have come
3:48.   8:04
Yo fans... he is saying he had a bad time and you talking shit. Show some respect for jj, we own him at least that for all the time he is making us laugh and give him a break
tattooed legacy on his back just to lose 🤣🤣🤣
love you brother
"Coonichiwa"
With all that hard-core training and sparring with tough ass people u still don't know how to box lol💀,  wtf was that match.
yea you lost.....move on. you mates may say you won but we all know the truth. sorry you lost stop clownin. god whats with all these youtube boxers that win and LOVE IT "yea you appeal you clown" type attitude. yet when they lose they start almost becoming lawyers. giving reasons and excuses. shows a sensitive these guys really are as a stronger man would say "well it was close i disagree on a few point but respect the decision......my next fight the will be no numbers or maths to know who won."  the fury comment are peak weakness  i think logan paul, your crew ect  are surrounding yourselves with a bunch of asskissin yes men. you both seem to be doing similar sensitive reactions.  you fought good, be proud not bitter and do better
Attacking Tommy’s personal family life? How is that related to the theme of this video Mr Knowledge?
Boxing ain’t the thing g stick with music
JJ you're the man ❤
You did sooo well in that fight jj the judges clearly don't know what they were doing
Agree with EVERYTHING JJ has just said, only idiots and losers would take this defeat with grace and just accept the fact they’ve been robbed. Why would he lie down like a bitch and accept the fact they’ve stolen such an amazing accomplishment from him? You’re handling this perfectly, don’t listen to anyone else saying otherwise because they clearly don’t know the feeling of working hard for something and having it taken from them but one day they will and then they’ll understand your pain. 🐐
good to have you back JJ
You lost jj take it is as a man❤😂
Look if I’m being honest neither of you did well, not saying this to hate you, I’m a big fan but you both didn’t do well
lol. Run it back then.
You aint nothing either 😂 you hugged and tried to win via point deduction 😂 cmon that isnt a good legacy pathetic
After watching this video, it displays your character and shows that you will never become a champion in boxing. You'll always be known as a joke in the fighting community.
He needs to forget about boxing honestly. I'll never watch another fight because favouritsm always wins. He should release more music and work on the YouTube stuff.
This was a pathetic video
Giant pity video
well, you did say you were going to shock the world
Jj you are deluded. There are many more people that thought you lost the fight. Judging Tommy' s personal life because you can't cope with a loss is immature and childish. Grow up a bit...
L get humbled
Don’t care about the result really, but that was poor sportsmanship. And I don’t like that boxers when they lose can appeal after the fact. You don’t see that in other sports like football. You accept the decision however unfair, and you move on. I can’t respect the decision to appeal
Look JJ, Win or lose man. We don’t care, we’re proud of you Regardless. On how far you’ve came, your older then Tommy, your 30 man. You need to accept a Loss, Now get ur ass to fight Jake Paul. We believe in you!❤️
Bro, you clearly lost. Cant even support you on this bro cooked you it's okay bro was an actual boxer.
bro just spent 8 out of 9 minutes roasting tommy fury😂😂 quite funny tbf but all you needed to say was he hung out with chris brown, chilling with a woman beater is embarassing enough
Every fighter atleast has to have 1 loss bro keep putting smile on our faces keep posting
Just take the L KSI pls stop talking about it 😂
People saying he needs to move on. He needs to accept his loss. Those people don't know what it's like to lose to favourism.If I felt like I won, i wouldn't shut up about it either. It should've been a draw at best but boxing's never fair, they'll never want a YouTuber winning against a pro boxer who's a fury
Don't care about the loss at all tbh, you've by far been my favorite youtuber since 2017 and the hardest working youtuber on earth bro you've earned that title and all the others as well. you deserve a break bruv 🖤🖤 See you in 2024 ? Love bro
Bro Tommy won the fight stop crying and move on.
We already forgot you lost
bros starting to put up them calories
KSI won 110% JJ you won don't let these stupid ass judges and commissions put that on you in all our hearts you beat Tommy Fury this is a comfort to no one but the fury family because Tommy is ass and we all know it
You are the true definition of a man who's not humble.. accept the L, hold it, wear it.. its crazy to think that your ego is so huge that you created this reality in where you won. wake. up.
Change the title to “Reacting to my loss to Tommy Fury”
If you spend a little less time hugging and star jumping like a 6 year old girl with special needs, you could redeem yourself
yes you lost boi
Apparently in ksi’s mind, the regular people who think ksi won are better / know better than the judges 😂😂😂
I should have won, so dumb that the judges couldn’t see that u were the better fighter in the match. Even if u lost, we will still support u man, and that is ur first loss ever, and that is pretty amazing
sore loser, take the L on the chin
So much hard work for what? It was a trashy boring HUG FEST, you didn't even went there to fight, all the hype for that shit? Lame asf
KSI won that
JJ, I know KSI stands for Knowledge, Strength and Integrity, but I think you're also showing Kindness, Sincerity and Inspiring at the same time. Big up, still undefeated imo.
Jake thought you won because it was your event and the fight have absolutely no action but only holding on for dear live and illegal punches from both of you. Where only Tommy got a point deducted even though you arguably hit Tommy in the back of the head more than he did to you. Including one moment where you hit him like 6 times in the back of the head back to back to back.  So it makes sense it being your event and very low action that a close fight would go your way. Thankfully the judges didn't give a shit and gave the UD to Tommy.
7:58 wow, being a sore loser is one thing, but blackmailing him? Seriously?
Why is he acting like he wasn't trying to get hit in the back of the head, theres literally a video of his corner telling him to, and then to talk about "fair" you're rich, you can do anything you want, pathetic
Tommy couldn’t beat 2 youtubers without it going to judges…
2:57 tough fights? Only challenge was Tommy Fury, who he lost to...
Hope you retire from boxing. It’s so much effort for just one fight.
Ur so up ur self
I love how he shows irrelevant people saying that he won as "proof" that he is right
ok. now go bald. a deal is a deal
Just stop being a sore loser
W KSI
Just because you trained hard doesn’t mean you’ll win no matter what just accept the lost. Game is game
get rid of your yes men jj. it's really a bad look
I believe you showed such bad sportsmanship do better
Bro your 30 and you said “I broke down” TAKE IT LIKE A MAN OMG
Bro can not take an L to save his life
JJ man, you gotta stop being bitter about outcome of the fight and move on.
Making a video chatting shit about the guy who won fair and square? Kinda seems like you’re just trying to make yourself feel better about the loss. Don’t be a sore loser, you talked the most and didn’t show up on the day. Respect for working hard but you definitely lost, move on, entertain your fans and grow up.
Bro you fighting Jake next year or what
WHAT LOSE JJ, WDC ABOUT YOUR LOSE.... YOU'RE SPECIAL TO ALL OF US
You lost deal whit it.
It's funny how JJ called Logan a sore loser after the fight in 2019, yet he's been acting twice as bad after his loss to Tommy 😆.
Buddy ran around the entire ring and just clinched the entire fight, he can’t even get over it a whole month later💀
*jj don't get cocky pineda finna come after u gang*
ksi you ain’t win get that through yo head, you need alot of work
It was just hugging bro and it was really close so I thought either could win
ego too high. L
Telling millions to attack a father cuz your a sore loser is truly pathetic
KSI still salty bro just be humble you lost
See, JJ, we don't really mind you losing. We got to see you fight and that's what we actually wanted to see. Ofcourse we will have fun on reddit but I know you're aware that it's just for fun and no real hate. Thanks JJ❤️
Loved the hugging match
No matter what people think at the end of the day you lost the fight. Have a bit of respect and sportsmanship and accept the loss instead of telling people to hassle another person on social media and in person.
Mental should always come first.
THERE HE ISSSS
Dude, chin up.. even muhammad ali and tyson lost.
Ksi is so hurt 😂
Telling millons of people to scold and harrass tommy cuz you cant handle a loss is pathetic
Bout time.
I don’t care if you lose, You still the greatest in my book.
will you box again?
You won that fight stay strong stay tuff and keep up the hard work JJ
Bro you got in the ring with Tommy and survived. We are all our own biggest critics. You smashed it bro. Be proud of yourself. The only thing I can say is, you have to throw more punches to win dude.
can no one take a joke anymore 💀
You lost because you were too busy looking at John Cena.
JJ lost swear
Showing you boxed in 2017 and them say you only boxed 3 years
not it man. your losing yourself over this.
your boxing style alone was the reason you lost lol
Losing after all that talk is so crazy to me
W fam you blow our mind out in that fight and made us proud
Tbh, Tommy will never run it back with you coz he wouldn’t wanna take a L and have the story written differently in the end.   There’s no doubt he’s pro boxer and has more experience than you. But let’s not forget YOU have just as good of a opportunity to become a great boxer and hang with proffesional boxers because you have the funds and connections and time to do so..
❤
I scored it for Tommy but it was really close. But for ksi to make such a big thing about a close decision is also not right. If you leave it to the judges than that's on you. You called other people out for having yes men and now you have fallen for it yourself.
I love you ksi but this aint it man being kind of an immature and a sore loser here
womp womp lil bro
As a fan, you're so far from over this JJ. Look at how long you spent in this video comparing yourself to Fury. Searching so hard, so desperately for Ws in this L. It's pretty insecure.
L S I what a baby you are unsubscribing and it hurts tbh.
Mad innit
I appreciate this video ksi but if only my 200$ ksi win and 100$ round 6 ko, went through. But I don't regret supporting you man.
nah man
Smh so it really has been ego this whole time…🤦🏾‍♂️. You lost bro it is what it is
Bro is stright up spreading hate, and will physically harm him saying what he said. That's just sad bro.
Is it just or does KSI JUST HAVE “56” likes
damn, really going after the mans family?
Boxing style is stupid
While I do believe that JJ is right about Tommy being a trash boxer despite his experience, youth and family, this mentality of saying "I've come this far, I was just a nerdy kid playing fifa in his bedroom to a boxer" after losing is embarrassing. His message posted on ig is how losers think, and KSI is no loser. Winners accept their lose, don't blame anyone, and don't look for other people's validation. Just improve and make sure the next time the judges have no choice but to give you the win in the most objective decisions.   Also, taking a jab at Tommy's personal life, him enjoying his life, and apparently not being their for "his family" was pointless and irrelevant.
Now you know how Logan feels! 😢😂
honestly tommy dont got you in his head its you that got tommy in your head for the past 3 weeks or so he dont care you do whats dones done we're proud of you
I Love Ksi❤                                Waiting for jake paulers to type glazing.
rename the video so... re loser
HA, YOU LOST!
jj you should take a break till or after new year
Don't care what judges say, you won, Tommy is shit.
LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
8:06 asking your viewers to go after someone just cause you lost is a L move. I personally don’t think you lost but it’s still f’d up
bro's still salty about the loss
U gotta stop dergrading Tommy Fury to make u feel better JJ, its just toxic bro.
It’s kinda disappointing to see JJ being so encouraging and toxic within a span of a few seconds. Talking about his family was going too far, and encouraging his fans, many of whom are dumb, impressionable kids that aren’t even teenagers, to verbally attack him online and in public is something I didn’t expect from someone who talked so much about their growth as a person. Especially knowing that kids don’t know the line, they might do some really idiotic stuff like physically attack him or go after his family.
❤❤❤❤❤
Why would your trainers risk massive potential injury to pay your sparring partners to knock you out for tougher sparring sessions.. sounds backwards.. why would you want the fighter to be potentially injured before a fight? That’s a big risk.. sounds backwards.
I understand JJ, you’re always winning and to take an L especially undeserved, i understand why you can’t move past this. I don’t blame him.
It’s kinda humble that jj is apologizing even though he’s been doing stuff and providing us content. Keep it up❤ you won that anyway, he said you were easy but then it went to decision and when he heard it he was screaming like it was so tough that means he didn’t know if he was gonna “win” after he said all of that
Lol
As fans of ksi i think we can all agree that the whole "ksi tryna get fans to attack fury verbally, and also ksi bringing furys family into it" is a low move, but as fans i feel we can understand that this is unfortunately ksi's way of dealing with a real loss (wich yes is his mistake) but we all need time to understand our mistakes and learn from them so if were true fans, maybe help him through it rather than throw shade his way and do exactly what hes doing himself 🤷👍👌 hope u learn well and heal mentally ksi
Lsi being a sore loser is so funny, claiming he went toe to toe with a professional even tho lil bro kept hugging tommy. No one thinks u won other than ur delusional ass fan base, but do whatever helps u sleep at night 💀

KSI is a unit 💪

🥩🚴
You uploaded this shit after this long, shameful
WSI ❤
Rematch
Thank god. The way he was building it up in the end made it look like a retirement announcement.
my guyyyy
Ksi won I’ve watch the whole shit fk boxing in general and corrupt judges
You’re salty 😂 fight Jake
this is copium
After all the ways you could have handled this, this aint it champ getting your viewers to harrass him is a 🤡 move
ksi won the fight lol
I like ksi but he needed the humbling
Tommy knows deep down he isn’t high level. He’s lightly mentioned it in multiple interviews.  Tommy Fury has only 1 more fight then KSI as a pro. TF with 7 and KSI with 6. Tommy had 12 amatuer  bouts which is quite low compared to champions who’ve had 50+   Tommy is building ring experience against these you tubers and it’s making him $$$ at the same time - which is something he’s said plenty of times.
Lookie who it isssssss??!!!!!!??!????? 😂😂😂😂
Even now ksi is being a sore loser. Saying to his fans to berate tommy in public is just .... Pathetic. Ksi lost more than this fight. He lost his dignity
He won the fight        Pathetically      Shit fight
shameless guy
I believe you won the fight however just relax and stay true to yourself
It is embarrassing on him claiming to be world class and not knocking out a YouTuber but same time don’t take back your words now. You are saying he’s embarrassing but you were clearly confident he wasn’t levels above you and that you were super high level
Wow you lost me as a fan, and hopefully many others. Thinking you lost is fine, but going after Tommy as a parent, and even advocating your fans to harass him is just scummy behavior. Jake is way more mature than you nowadays smh
Baba Tunde is back 😂
😭
So there’s an appeal….
L
It’s just rigged with the fury’s period if I was anyone I wouldn’t bother with em that sucks dog nuts and hang of daddy doodles fuck the fury’s enough said.
Sore loser
Man I’m just glad you’re back
We don’t care that u lost thank you
This is embarrassing of JJ. To commenting on tommys private life and telling people to harass him etc. I rate ksi waaaay more than Jake Paul but Jake handled his loss way better.
Great👍🏾 that you back
People are being cunts about jake being more mature and saying he took the loss better to ksi but the thing is jake v tommy was a fair loss as jake was overal shit and even with tommys breaks jake couldnt defeat him but with ksi he trained like a fucking machine to the point of passing out for the fight where he threw more punches and with all the back of head hits with only 1 point deducted for like 7 hits would make anyone pissed off and the fact that it was 1 point split ksi should've won or even better a draw as another point should've been deducted to tommy for all the head hits and being tommy is a "pro." he shouldn't be doing that stupid shit. Another thing tommy chose the venue so he could of paid the judges or some shit but i aint butt hurt but i do feel bad for ksi.
Owe me 20 quid icl 😂😂😂
I just realised ksi had a rocky situation, only in this case they have switched race
Okay ishowspeed next
lol loser
John Fury Owes YOU £200K
Impressive
Bro you can't climb up stairs without stumbling few ones but even with that keep climbing to the top
The king is BAAACK
Sore loser and bad sportsmanship. Stop the bullshit. I’ve been a fan of you since fifa 12 race to division 1, been following you all this time and you’ve had your Ls and moments I disagree with how you’ve handled things but how you’ve reacted to this clear loss is just off putting. Like a child and is pushing me towards supporting Jake if you two ever fight (he accepted his loss to Tommy far more gracefully), and that’s saying something because I think Jake is a top tier twat.
He edged you
Everyone knows you really won that fight.
We dont care. You've come so far, we're proud of you❤
You lost G, just take your L
You have some personality issues brother. Fix them before you bury your own career.
Honestly I don't think anyone cares about the results of that fight now  We all know Tommy lost
What a truly awful man KSI can be! Honestly, I’ve watched him since Fifa Funnies but to attack Tommy like that, mentioning Molly& his kid is honestly disgusting. I genuinely want to see Jake beat you now
Refunds bro
We all know you won, thank you for the inspiration! Was good to meet you at the 1B event. 😊
KSI, Honestly you have already win our hearts, that is more than enough for us to be proud of you. We are all happy and proud of your performance. It is what it is, in my opinion you have already won and surely that has to count for something right. By the way you appeared in my spotify for my wrapped 2023, can you imagine how happy i was because you had not posted for so long, i thought you were gone bro but then you appeared on my spotify so yeah. Be happy for yourself that you have true fans that have supported through all this years man. Im really proud of you JJ from one older brother to another
Attacking his family and personal life is some major f*cking weirdo shit, I dont even know anything about Tommy but this makes you look like a coward.
Bro wiped his tears with £50 notes
A lot of people agree that you won that fight but don’t send an army of violent fans at him because of the result. He didn’t call the final result the refs did and it was slightly your fault for letting it get to the end. all boxers know don’t let it get to the judges because it never plays out well when it’s a controversial fight.
Fuck the fight bring try not laugh back
You shocked the world JJ😂
Bro just take the L
Tommy Fury boxed Jake Paul, Ksi then backed out cos he scared to rematch these 2 influence boxers
calling jake paul your biggest hater is wild, grow tf up lil bro youre his biggest hater, he just thinks youre a clown
Such a sore loser honestly, terrible role model
bro needed that win tho jj woulda fked him up . bro got lucky
It's good to cope but the fight was really close. JJ you can't just say Tommy didn't do anything
LSI
I used to enjoy his content but when you start attacking someone's personal life is where the line is drawn. What makes you different from Dillon Danis when you start bringing Tommy's wife and kid into this? I dont doubt that he worked hard but nothing good comes out of bringing someone's personal life into anything.
if im being honest. You are not the best boxer ever. The more work you put in the better you will be. You need to train your defense more and how to get away from situations. Train even when you dont have a fight coming up. The clinches hurt th fight.
Regardless of what's happened I'm glad to see ksi back
JJ lost so many fans because of this, it was sad to see but well deserved for your fragile ego. U lost, take it like a man
You realise no one really cares that you lost to tommy right bro. Ofc we are gonna give you shit simply because thats what we do with our fit neek but in saying that I will still watch and follow everything you do because we like you JJ not because we like that you box
It's clear some of you guys don't understand the mindset required to fight professionally. Look at what happened to Mike Tyson when he lost. Or Muhammad Ali when he lost to Frazier. Or Lennox Lewis. To reach those levels, it requires a very high competetive drive. And when they lose, they pretty much crumble because it destroys their egos. Their entire self worth just crumbles.  I don't agree with how he's making it all public. This seems more like something that should be written in a journal or told to a therapist. Although I do agree that Tommy should probably quit going out to parties and clubs since he's a father now and he's got bigger responsibilities than just boxing now, it's not something that should be public. Tell Tommy or don't say it at all. So JJ, please, quit using the internet as your personal journal. It won't end well since your words will get twisted, or they will directly quote something stupid you say. Gotta be careful on the internet
“Don’t judge a man by how he enjoys victory, judge him by how he endures defeat.” - House of Cards  My estimation of you has dropped quite dramatically JJ. Clearly nobody ever taught you that sometimes it’s better to just shut your mouth.
Tommy didn’t just win the fight. He broke ksi mentally to the point where every fundamental ethos that ksi stood for was lost !!
KSI as a fan, this is honestly such a bad look for you. You are literally BEYOND pushing 30, and yet you are still acting egotistical and immature.
As someone who can't stand ksi i agree with him saying it was embarrassing for Tommy not being able to win dominantly against a YouTuber but y'all should both be embarrassed for y'all performance and thinking that main event was ppv worthy
8:20 bro says you can do anything with hard work but didn’t work hard enough to beat some shit boxer. You should’ve won but didn’t man we love you just be humble man.
JJ are you proud to mobilise your underage fanbase to harass the guy who beat you?
Pretty rough seeing this video. You didn’t take this well. Telling your fans to harass someone really shows a lot about you.
bit a bad taste going after his missus, saying he doesnt see his baby enough. and telling your fans to barraide him online
You did hug Tommy fury for most of the fight? Not sure what fight you thought you fought. Also this video is complete non sense, your acting like Jake Paul and encouraging harassment and abuse his way? Embarrassing.
Man I wish Ksi won that fight wanted to see Jj on top of the world !!
Rare ksi L
love you KSI
don’t think he shld be telling ppl to go at tommy or ‘berate’ him, but still glad he’s taken some time to reflect and some time to himself, considering all the work he’s done he deserves it. it’s better that he’s made this video now rather than straight after the fight and everyone thinks he won the fight anyway
Ksi will never be the same again 😔
Bro, leave Tommy alone 😂😂. Just because he beat you doesn't mean you try to make fun of him now. Either way tommy isn't even giving you attention
Nah fuck that man real supporters would tell him he didn’t work hard enough to knock out Tommy. He didn’t earn a break he lost. Tommy is nothing man you should’ve beat him. Sweat in training so you don’t bleed in battle. Brother take the loss as a lesson and never let it happen again. Don’t get comfortable and complacent die for what you built and the lives you helped.
Grow up jj
Wow… not the JJ I was expecting after his first loss. Would’ve thought you were more mature than publicly “shaming” him.  Chin up man, show your fans how you handle a loss. This ain’t the way.
Bro can’t take an L
7:36 that’s a bit of a mad statement when those three people are the only three you need to impress🤔 feel like this video was a lil unneeded
He did beat tommy in that fight but his fighting style is still aotp he looks kinda crazy
Tommy Fury is so deep in ksi heads it’s funny to watch Lsi cry’s every night
Let's be honest  We like it better when he's just being a "YouTuber". 🗣️💯
Took you long enough to process something that never happen in your life, my advice is Train your mental more JJ.
😂man bro
This video is so petty and childish 😂😂 dude reallly can’t accept that he’s just worse than ksi… this video just shows how much Tommy is in his head
now you and jake are humbled its time for the fight no more being in denial ya lost
We all thought you won
Ksi trying to get any sort of W against Tommy is so funny all ksi has is words because he couldn’t win in the fight 😂😂
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha L O S E R
But why personally attack him
We don't care bro
Man I like jj but just accept you lose excuses on excuses very hard to watch the fact he’s going through multiple ways to appeal it is crazy you would gain more respect being humble in defeat
Telling your little fan girls to go harass Tommy fury in public just because he’s better than you is embarrassing Lsi seriously EMBARRASSING 🤡
That laugh carries a certain cringe-ness that is unmatched...
This video is a L just like your boxing match just accept you ain’t that good
i like KSI but its pretty obvious he lost that one
Over a month later and KSI still in denial.
Yep you lost on 14th October pretty clearly Tommy Fury landed more than you he threw more than you he pushes the pace more than you and that’s it , you lost. The judges didn’t take the moment away from you Tommy took it away from you. He’s just better than you.
u gave a sht fight, all u did was clench for 20 mins
bro you need to box, not fucking throw one punch over and over
yapper
e
boohoo bro you won the most star jumps in a ring.
That was an embarrassment of a fight. Hopefully he fights properly instead of clitching
I feel very bad that the match results was ridiculous 😅
Fight was garbage. Don’t care.
love u bro
You could had kept it classy but you decided to attack his character has a father. That shit is weak.
based on from what I saw, looks like you won... but who else thought he meant nnn?
https://youtu.be/fqHiF6I-i8M?si=HaSCsz1pP7_VSZk-
The end of LilMaxKid
You won ksi
Win or lose, we are together on this 🎉
I like ksi but this video isnt ksi, its just a crybaby that couldnt take an L, props to him cuz he was able to hang with tyson fury's little brother, but bro just because tommy fury didnt do what he was supposed to do to you (dominate the fight) as a pro boxer, doesnt mean you won.
Still an experience broo!! No need to apologize we understand how you really feel, hope you go start making contents again
KSI  its pathetic to listen to you, trying to undermine the judges...you might have fans that wish you would have won..but "claming" to have won, when 3 out of 3 judges claimed the opposite..thats just beneath you dude. Attacking Fury on a personal level, after the fight (his kid and his wife), how low is that ?  Man up, stop acting like a sore loser, and move one.
Laughing at ksi
We stand with KSI
JJ we don't care, you make our day. Thats all we need
You might have the athleticism of an athlete but not the mental
8:32 we Love you regardless jj we know the real💪🏾
Sounds hurt
“You win some and you lose some but you live… you live to fight another day”- Craig’s Daddy
Bro if we are being honest, you didnt win either- all you did was hug him and your team was literally telling you to bait him to hit you at the back of the head. You should be ashamed at your performance. The real losers are those who paid for the fight.  Its also pretty distasteful for you to go after his character and parenting. Stay on track and talk about the fight, why attack the mans character? We dont know what he is going through. Come on man
All i see is a sore loser
Bro got no views 😭
It took 2 months for this guy to see that he lost!! What part of getting your cheeks clapped by Tommy fury did you not understand!!
This is sad
You should be proud jj no one has accomplish what you have accomplished, losing this fight is like an ant shit.
"Trained so hard nd overtime" Bro hugged nd had never his guard up.. This guy a proper clown.. I lost respect to him tbh Being delusional to being partners with a blatant scammer.  You changed jj
I say this as respectfully as possible.  Logan paul showed more modesty in his video about his loss to you after yall's  fight.  You loss the fight. You lost the appeal.  At the end of the day if you couldnt go 12 rounds(a whole actual boxing match) where is the real credibility.  I wanted you to win!!! But this didnt go your way. Take the loss and move forward.
What a guy. Keep it real brother 👍🏻
*Finally come out of hiding have you?* 😂😂😂😂😂 *Also sure Tommy will never be as good as his brother (The Gypsy King himself) but he sure as sh1t doesn’t deserve this. I am honestly ashamed to call myself your fan and I have been watching you for 10 years now.* 😔😔😔😔😔
Take the loss
Your still a loser, but i still support you and where you come from. I don’t believe you won the fight and should move on. I believe you can still be a great boxer if you change and fix the flaws from your last fight.
Relax with my family, and show them a good time? What is JJ tryna say
Except there wasn’t anything wrong with the decision you did nothing but clinch and jump around like a disabled kid for the whole fight
My dad had same thing suggest this to anyone who has worked so hard take break off phones and work helps the brain to swinch off
Attacking tommy like that is pathetic
Since the fight I have been waiting and waiting for a video just to see that you were doing okay. I was watching the fight with a Tommy fan and tbh he didn’t like you at all. Even HE thought you won the fight. Glad to see your head is held high. I have looked up to you since 2017 and still you have proven time and time again why you are the best. Thanks for your work JJ. ❤
Asking to attack someone is pathetic
W video
Bro you’re almost doing more then Jake did and looking like a really sore loser here 😂
This video was just straight facts we all love you Ksi u got robbed but there will be a come back and you will knock out anyone who stands in front of you from now.❤❤❤
tbh you lost and here's why, you didnt even wanna box tommy, you just clinched every 10 seconds and hit him in the back of the head so many times and if none of you guys believe me look it up yourselfs, there's a video about it when he hits tommy in the back of the head for over 2 minutes , im a big fan of yours and im very sad you lost, I really did wanted you to win
Honestly one of the biggest sore losers. What a joke this “man” is😭
Fella is such a sore loser 😪
KSI, please accept that you lost. On the night, you lost. Even the appeal, you lost that too. You have probably been the most saltiest person to lose out of everyone in YouTube boxing. Instead of saying, 'Fair play Tommy, you won.', you're now going out of your way to harass his social media by your fans, just because you couldn't take the loss well. Even going into his personal life as well, why? It's so unnecessary, honestly.  Not just that though, you even said in a couple of videos before your fight with Tommy,  that 'when you win', you would harass people on the internet for saying that Tommy would win. It's just so fucking pathetic. I wish you actually realised how toxic you really are.  You would be a lot happier if you moved on, tbh with you, rather than constantly saying 'I won' when you didn't anymore. You never did. You lost on the night, and you lost on the appeal too.  Anyway, look on the bright side of this loss. You can always film a documentary, and call it 'Can't Win'.
Ksi won , till this day !
Kinda embarrassing that you're still hung up on this after so much time. Grow up, take a loss. Been a huge fan but this is just disappointing to me. You fought well, I believe you won the fight as well but ur actions after are just straight up disrespectful. Drop the ego JJ.
Loser!
Bro i think u could gone for him a bit more and he was initiating the clinch more. But jj we know u won  brother.
ur buns
Love you KSI
Bro sounds so salty and jealous take it on the chin lil bro man up
You sound kinda bitchmade for speaking on his wife and kids. And i think dude is corny, but you could've just kept it boxing.
If we be real you guys were hust hugging and you were cringe to watch jumping like that I personally feel sorry for those guys who actually paid to watch that shit I'm your big fan btw
Honestly, what happened to you?  You used to make really good content and seemed like a fun guy in general, but all this loss has shown is that you're a child and have barely grown. All your fans who are praising you saying they're proud aren't being real with you, because as your long time fans are saying this response and attitude in general has been hugely disappointing. "I hate losing" Yeah, welcome to the club with the rest of the world.
Bit late to the party lol
It was the shock the world curse. Judges saw it and made an example out of you.
there’s also no real highlights of you winning either
Ksi’s next song should be called “bruised ego”
Just get more confidence in throwing both hands you landed alot. You depended on the same right over or straight hand while doing jumping jacks the entire fight. The reason you lost is because they wanted to see combinations at least once a round fam...
I don’t care about no appeal your the real winner and always will be for me 👏👏👏
JJ ignore the loss bruv we love you
He deserves to be rich. I don't do anything and I'm poor. Well done for all your hard work KSI
I’m sorry to say you washed 😔
bro finally got humbled
Who would have thought Jake Paul to be more mature and level headed than Ksi
Cope
POV. Watching this during basic training
The appeal better come back as a draw. I can understand anyone who says KSI lost, it wasn't his best performance, but I can't believe people think Tommy Fury actually won that.
Yo KSI are you gonna fight Speed?
KSI
Realistically we think you should have won. But it wasn’t Tommy’s fault the judges scored it his favour. Sending people to spam him isn’t right, man’s enjoying his life just like you where on your break too.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Pulled a Logan and got the L
I can't be the only one who thinks, if he'd actually keeps boxing, get new trainers. That's messed up beyond if your trainers, the guys you are suppose to trust and help you get better, are paying other people if they can knock you out. For a smart guy like JJ(when he wants to be), that's a stupid thing to have happening in your camp.
Look in the comments. Your fans are even saying you lost 😂 can't respawn? Life isn't a game, huh? Take the L like a man and cut the bs excuses and lies. Look inward for once.
The copium is wild, dudes ego is so hurt and i love it
Take the L
Bro you lost I’m sorry, you were hugging him the whole way through. You should be proud whether you won or not
the fury family has taken over boxing with cheating examples like KSI vs tommy fury and francis vs tyson fury the whole family is known for cheating😂😂😂
To me it looked like a draw
"Sorry I haven't uploaded I  a while. I lost and my ego lied to me. I shall not accept it and the kids in the comments will back me and build it back up"  You lost. You're crap at boxing. You're not ard.
KSI threw a childish unprofessional  tantrum right after he lost and now he wants to start a harassment campaign. Yikes
remember jj there's no pressure for you  to post. you started posting on this channel mainly because you could do so whenever you wanted
1:53 THIS IS WHY THEY CALL HIM FAKE PAUL
With the fight being so close I think it should be a draw and there should be a rematch late 2024
Dad's back from his milk run! Hype!!!
nah bruv u lost stop doin jumping jacks and hugging
This videos still hasn’t got 1 mil in 5 hours that’s crazy
Win, lose, draw, it doesn't matter JJ. We're all still proud of you 👏
I’ve been waiting for this
Let's not encourage millions of people to 'publicly berate' someone
I dont know if ksi shouldve won this fight but he definitely acts like a looser
Lol we don't care if you lost. You are the man! Just keep showing up, that's all that's needed. Can't win em all.  Your ego will heal. Part of life.
It was as rigged as the 2020 US election
When you going back to boxing in 2024 JJ ?
Look man to man you did lose. You acted immaturely and still havnt accepted it. You swung for the fences and then clinched to avoid punches. It eas a miracle the fight wasnt stopped as its eas aeful to watch and any traditional boxing event wouldnt have called off the fight. Tommy also dodnt gain anything from the fight. Im not hating on you im just telling you what you need to hear. Its very veru commendable how much work ethic you have shown but sometimes you gotta take the L with grace my dude. This is coming from a place of loce and hoping it helps you grow, not a place of malice.
You should be proud of yourself, at least I am! However I do disagree with the personal attacks on Tommy. Not the right path to take and hopefully you’ll take it back in the next video. Nice to see you again on this channel❤
am i the only ksi fan that can comprehend the fact that he lost?
I fully believe you won but the way you behaved right after the fight was absolutely embarrassing. You threw a childish tantrum. IDK if you came out of it looking as good as you thought due to that. Especially with your call to action in this video to harass him.
His brother lost as well to Francis
Your sooo pathetic going after a man's family just because you lost...your soo salty! 😂😂
AYO JJ IS BACK LETS GOOOOO  I’m just happy that ya are back
The ego this man has is laughable. Just accept the  fucking loss like a true man. It's not like you're a professional boxer, 🙄.
These comments make me sick the difference is KSI - should have won - Jake lost - the judges were sucking Tommy off and Tommy was a more professional boxer bollocks - KSI we are proud of you
BOTH FURYS 'PRO BOXERS' ARE COMING OFF HUGE ROBBERY LOSES DONT FORGET THAT ALL FACTS
Mr cuddle monster taking about he beat Tommy?
If you actually boxed then u could’ve won
😂😂😂 he cares so much we've all moved on 😂😂😂 and he lost 😢😂😂
I’m a ksi fan but I think this is a little selfish I don’t really think asking people to keep commenting saying you lost bla bla bla is respectful in any way. I think he’s still mad about the loss. ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️no hate⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️
When privately educated kids don't get their own way.. they throw a strop....
Took u 2 months to notice💀💀
G is back
Guess he’s back, let’s go 😂 try not to laugh next please
It's really not that deep the fight was garbage both didn't win in my opinion doesn't matter
No matter what happened or happens we still love you, Been watching you since 2012 and you’ve come a long way since then. What a legend 🐐🙌🏼💯
JJ We are all glad that you are back. Thank God you didn't quit YouTube. In your next fight if you have one, please just don't hug so much as in the Tommy fight
Bro lost a fight and cried what a puss 😭
I thought he was done YouTube after that L. Glad to see he hasn’t quit on us.
in common sense, even without the point deduction it should be a draw
You can legit see ksi holding back tears 😂
I’ll be honest mate it should have been a draw. Maybe a win by point deduction. But you know what that’s ok. You did what you set out to do and went the distance. More than anyone who can say it. You did it. You did way better than anyone could. And as someone who has followed you since FIFA Funnies you have knocked it out the park.
Tommy was always going to win on points because his family name, people fear the name "fury" cause of how big Tyson made it.  But you will bounce back and go bigger and better
He FINNALLY UPLOADEDD
I glad your back Jj we miss you bro I’m proud of your legacy you still the king it’s not over yet 🐐🔥💯
Real loyal supporters don’t care if u won or not, as long as u had fun and did what u did we are still proud.
Meh, I wouldn’t go at someone’s family.
this guy is done lol. 30 years old btw
What a bum. Cant even accept the loss.
I think your a couple months late m8
Tommy is a L
Naaaaah you don’t say JJ.. hold it and move on .. seriously man you’re ego is out of control 😴
Your scum for saying to harass Tommy. Tommy is really in your head 😮
Ksi sucks but so does tommy fury. It wasnt as if JJ was robbed he didnt do anything either. The only losers were the audience.
Haaaaa u took a llllllllll 😂😂😂😂 u tought u was goood
these overedits dont fit these styles of videos, it looks so ass
Sore loser😂
Finally it’s literally been months after the fight
9 mins yap session
We don’t care if you lost or not, we love you so much❤️. Of course you worked so hard to win but don’t forget all the accomplishments you have done et all you will do ❤️❤️❤️
Losing is crazy
You won that fight KSI. Everybody knows it
The king has returned
Should’ve won like but the actual fighting display was shite from both men but ye keep ye head up la
Point noted. Your hard work is examplary. Fuel for the fire. Thank you brother. Glad you got a rest and time with your fam.
I love JJ, but you know if the situation was reversed he would be trash talking tommy and saying he was just coping. He only cherry picks when it's convenient for him, and honestly came off like a sore loser. Lost respect there, but hopefully he will come back better after all this.
This video is way to bias bro?
Proud of you ❤‍🔥
I get don’t attack someone’s personal life but it’s true, bro had a kid and then is there 10% of the time
LSI man the fuxk up. You got your head boxed of of you
I think i speak for the majority of your audience when i say nobody cares you lost, we're proud of you for stepping into the ring and doing your absolute best once again, it's not about losing, keep up the content and come back greater than ever.
i want you to try the danish version of prime, it is actually so bad
big W four KSI  thank you fout thees words
take the L buddy, shut up, you're making it worst
The pba is the worst fucking thing some of them are fucking blind
4:20 Why does it sound like the Ronaldo speech👀???🥹 “its been fun” then starts reminiscing on his recent accomplishments 🥹🥹
30 years old man who can’t take an L, hugging and jumping doesn’t win boxing. Get over it, stop crying and accept you’re not that guy
Just take the L man
finally
Here before JJ takes the video down
We see right through the trying to laugh through all the pain JJ
Wow what a embarrising video. I don't want to argue who won because it doesn't really matter in this context. What matters is how you act after a loss and this ain't it. "I don't care what 3 random people think" Why are you lying you do care that's why you had a breakdown on the stage when you lost and that's why you are apealing. It is also embarrising going after Tommy and his parenting/life. You don't know anytihng about his private life and just because he is seen partying a couple of times it doesn't mean he don't take care of his family.
Delusional, go fight Jake and stop dodging
Hahah finally
This video is a clear example of how much of a hater and loser ksi is, he’s hatin on Tommy for living life who are u to tell him on what to do, that’s how you know he’s still butthurt about how he lost what a loser smh
His fans are all kids now. Us OG fans hate what he has become. He is an egotistical maniac. I am lowkey ashamed to once call myself a KSI fan.. but I was a kid back then so idk what to think. RIP pre-reddit, EA ranting, MMOGA -- LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION, Deji horror game, Heskey time, Virgin KSI. You will be missed.
Took you long enough
Y’all gon look goofy when the appeal comes out LMAO
This 30 year old really can’t accept that he lost 😂🤦‍♂️ going as far as to set his fan base on someone because it didn’t go his way.. this man is DELUSIONAL because of his massive ego, honestly grow up
Ksi, you cant be humble. Too much ego. Life will teach you more lessons if you keep your egos high like this. Its “Me”, “Me”, “Me” and “Me”
stop crying you lost get over it, Tommy out boxed you
Did he say he wants us to berate tommy, that is kind of grimm, also talking about his parental skills and absence as a father is tasteless, unless you want to fight the guy again don’t say unnecessarily hurtful stuff I would think to myself. I actually like JJ this doesn’t sound like him at all… ego bruised fr
Before i get hated by ksi stans, i was a ksi fan aswell, but his ego got out of hand and being such a sore loser is crazy. He should take an example of ngannou, who hae a wayyyy closer fight and actually boxed his opponent, and still said it was an honor to fight with you tyson next time i‘ll get you
Finally waiting for this response
You had me till you started attacking his family 😂 Take the L KSI 😂😂 this nerdy FIFA player lost 😂
Just don’t dodge Jake
H-U-M-B-L-E-D
Well, I gave you another chance. Seeing the title, I thought you’d finally taken the loss like a man. But no. Telling your impressionable dickrider fanboys to berate and harass him online and irl is flat out disgusting. You lost. Accept it and move on.
Yes u lost u bum stay mad
Bro finally had the courage to make a video like a year later!! We already forgot about the fight 😅 train get better in the shadows do better next time is all you can do. Keep moving forward
This video was a bigger L than the fight bro. I love JJ but cmon bro be better.
You didn’t win anything, you hugged him to death 😂
Have you paid John Fury or are you running from that too. Was a fan of you but for that lost respect. A DEBT MUST BE PAID
Honestly after all the talk, this just sounds like one huge excuse for loosing.
That was not needed at all
sad to see you lose bro!
Ksi vs Tommy/ Tommy fury won fury vs ngannou/ Tyson fury won All two fury won even when they didn’t land much punches🤷🏻‍♂️ Boxing is Rigged because of Saudi peoples😂
We got u jj  brk we were troll this guy I don't think anyone gonna say shit to Tommy's face tho 😂
Wtf man.  Still a sore loser even months later
man is sooo. bitter🤣
I love how JJ took half of the video to justify the break he had… you deserve a break more than most🤣everyone respects that
I love KSI 😂
Your finally back hoping for more videos 🫶
Sore loser
I don’t think Tommy lost but I don’t think KSI won either
KSI is disgraceful for taking shots at Tommy and his family life. Zero context was provided about those clips of Tommy… The one with him dancing was in a gym , the others were maybe after the fight or after Fury beat Francis so that would explain why he’d be at those clubs  Regardless , to take shots and start saying he’s a shit father this and that is offside. Complete bullshit
Well, no matter what happens, I will always got your back.
Heh massive L like the forehead.
Ksi sounds so salty that he lost 😭😭😭
Imagine saying Jake Paul isn’t a boxer and nothing but a fake; yet quote him 😅 was a fan of ksi since I was a kid. He fell off super 😂, training hard doesn’t mean you automatically win wtf? You danced and didn’t put any pressure on him lmao, if you genuinely think you’ve won then please just exile yourself.
not a fan of all the editor's subtitles in the background style
Cope😭
This was honestly a tough watch, tommy really broke this man mentally
sore loser lmao. far more people said you lost than won.
Yall always use that "he didn't knock out a youtuber" as an excuse you still lost get over it 😂 Floyd is a pro & he didn't knock out logan so does that mean he isn't a pro? No take your L like a man 😂
Thank you for being an inspiration to me KSI. I will become a drug addict and grind my way to the top of the industry through hardwork and dedication to become a drug lord one day.   STAY HARD! - David gogs
you won us and importantly u won in life my G
Literally no need to justify taking a break completely understandable.
Jj gonna hold that l for long
We proud of you🤝🏼🤲🏼 Break from YouTube deserved
You jus can’t box
been waiting for a reddit video 🌚🌚
Bro i am your fan but you had L and your ego is not accepting it. You said you had 3 fights this year but only fury fight is though.
Proud of you g, we all are <3
pathetic is took this long for this video and the fact you even tried to get it overturned after what happened with logan just makes it worse.
no big deal, Deji lost a couple times
I agree with JJ no matter what u follow the dream and the rewards of opportunities come ur way I’m seeing that now more than ever so I want to thank KSI ❤ been a supporter since 2020 and have loved his journey
What an egotistical fool. Sending fans to harass a man after he beat you? Still can’t accept the loss like a man? Name calling? Calling the world unfair. You’re acting like a middle schooler, change your surroundings, all you have right now are yes man and you’re not growing as a man. Your legacy that you find so important is always going to be stained by this, and the behaviour you showed the world after your fight. Grow up, you’re 30 smt now. It doesn’t matter if Tommy didn’t knock you out, you still lost. Everyone praising you on Twitter or even here on YouTube are simply hoping to be sent money or to be in the next video. They aren’t your real friends, nor are they fans. You’re true fans are the ones telling you the cold and harsh truth. Listen to the words you’ve said years ago. The old you would’ve hated what you’ve become today. Let’s just hope that the future you will also hate the you of today.
Thank you KSI for inspiring me to unsubscribe from your channel. I'm afraid that If i continue to follow you I might turn into one of your dickriders who has lost grasp of reality. I've been your fan for over 10 years. Back then being yes men was frowned upon, but now it seems like the majority of your fans are all yes men, the people surrounding you are yes men as well, which is why you're still friends with Logan after all of the scandals. You've changed a lot, I've changed as well, so, goodbye.   P.S please dont attend sidemen shoots, the videos are better without you, thanks.
Damn. Tommy got to him for real - it’s sad to see. KSI fan everyday but Jake handled his loss far better than this
You can do anything? Yeah you can lose a boxing match that you clearly did. But you still unable to handle it! L.S.I 👈
That fight was all you my man, we all know!
You lost. You mentioning to your fans to berate Tommy if they see him in public proves that Tommy did more than beat you. He humbled & destroyed your ego. You did better than anyone thought you would. Give it up and keep your grind, we all fail at several points in life.
ngl u both fought shit and everyone hated and didnt care for the fight the second you had ur 5th clinch the whole event was a shit show
You’re a legend my guy❤                 but telling your fanbase to harass someone is dipsh!t thing to do.
Lil max has gone silent now😂
KSI I'm proud of you
Relax fight Jake
I like JJ but it literally seems he can't accept that he lost. Just get over it, you have people who will love you. Never matters when you meet the top.
No Shit!!
No one gives af
That fight is a draw at best but the judges might've think you looked weaker because you always initiated the clinches.
KSI is still pressed he lost 😂
tommy was pshing pace you was hugging
Watched every minute of that fight saying u won still think u did !!!
im ending this right now tommy looked garbage in the fight but he beat you bro
This is fucking sad. Probably would’ve been better off not posting at all
You hugged the whole fight hold this L 😂
You’re a legend my friend ❤         These nuts
Commenting on tomy's family choices is low ksi, keep families out of your bs
You’re telling your fanbase to harass someone in public because you lost a boxing fight fair and square. It’s pathetic that your fanbase will continue to give you a pass on some of the things you say.
It’s crazy bc now people are saying how he shouldn’t be talking about another man’s family, but if it was announced on Twitter (probably was), everyone would be on Tommy for being a bad parent. Even if it was KSI who lost to Tommy, it can be looked as him being bitter, but it’s true. It happened. Just like how Jake Paul calls out content creators, but since he’s the bad guy, he can’t be in the right necessarily bc of the shit he’s done. Even if KSI called this shit out months after, ppl would say he has pride bc of his fight with him. Even if you say “you shouldn’t talk about family no matter what,” someone is going to eventually say it regardless on their opinion of Tommy. Just bc JJ said this in the context of losing to Tommy doesn’t make JJ the prideful person necessarily. Initiating online/in person harassment isn’t a good thing either, but it’s not far off from something Tommy would do himself. Nobody should be defending either in this vid anyways and let them handle their problems. And that’s why the people you dislike are on a different level than all of us. You spreading your feelings for them online only boosts them.
Salty ? Embarrising
You won, 100 % brother
Crazy how time flies. Keep going My G
Only YouTuber I'd watch even though he hasn't posted in a while.
I cant believe only the boxing referee organizations think tommy wins😂..joke
You are the best!(:
yes u lost
You deserve a break man spend some time with your fam.
🧔🏽‍♀️
Clown
I was just disappointed by how boring the fight was really hell i didn't even pay to watch it and i still feel like i got ripped off like don't get me wrong i support you and thats exactly why i won't lie to you and say it was a good fight I've seen you fight i know you can do better
the king is back!!!
Bruh that fight was sh1t.
Stupid video. Take the L's as they come, don't tell your audience to harass someone, thats fucked up. His personal life also has nothing to do with your fight. JJ fucked up with this.
But that was a horrible boxing skills from ksi that was not boxing
the way you took the lost was the actually lost.  It was a bad fight in general and i will never buy an event again !You still a beast and a good dude you should fight mike perry
Welcome back sore loser😂
But tommy fury the goat tho
He didnt make a  "I lost" title "So...i lost? Tactical video title
Disappointed in JJ. What he said about Tommy wasn’t acceptable. Love him or hate him as a boxer, Tommy is still a great lad outside the ring and very mature for his age. No reason to come at him personally or bring up his family almost 2 months after the fight. We should be expressive just like the wade situation. This is a new low from JJ.
JJ needs his ego in check. Asking fans to berate Tommy in public is tragic, especially when he’ll most likely be with his partner and young child. He knows there’s people in his fan base crazy enough to do something stupid. Threw a massive tantrum after the fight and still after weeks of reflection still behaving like a child. You’re 30 years old
Seems he cant live peacefully in a world where tommy is still the winner. 😅😂 mans still waiting on the appeal talking about dudes personal life. And telling people to harras him irl dead
Except ur defeat humbly this is embarrassing 😂. You can’t keep saying oh “he’s a boxer he couldn’t even knock me out” when the whole reason u fought him was to say “u beat a boxer” 😂😂
It's a disgusting thing to encourage people to berate him in public.. also to comment on his parenting just shows you haven't gotten over the loss
Chin up pal, you won! Don't worry about it
JJ, I’ve been watching since 2014 if I’m honest I’ve watched you succeed over and over again, and what I’ve learned at the ripe age of 19, I think I’m why your doc was called “can’t lose” because you can’t lose, there’s only winning and learning, you definitely won the fight in my opinion but regardless we’re all proud of where you’ve been and where you are going, head up JJ, love🙌🙌🙌🙌
The Fury family bought the Match. thats the only reason JJ :/ this is the down side of boxing. bitches. btw we don't care about that fake ass loss, we love you, I love you.... and thats sus, am happy u back, breh. i missed you.
What's more embarrassing is that you lost in your own event with the same "commissioner" that has been ruling all of your events... damn
Still can't accept the lost. Bruh...
Yes men thought you won
streets know who really won #king
JJ u also forgot about the times u hit tommy on the back of the head like u do with all ur opponents
Bros still crying, get over it loser
The bandana has grown
L😂
U know what I love that jj can be petty and u can say na it ain’t right to bring up his kid and all that but that’s real he’s bitching and we all do it so u can’t say nothing
You s ck at boxing 😂
Bro, we see the pain
❤️❤️
You lost, you reacted like a child... hahahahaaaaa  unlucky , you boxing is terrible, swinging your arms everywhere 🤣🤣🤣
Ksi wins no matter what in my book
Took long enough
It’s crazy I mean Tommy absolutely stealing this and then his brother absolutely stealing his fight against ngannou where everyone thought ngannou won, surely that shows that there is something more going on here. Boxing is notoriously corrupt and if anyone’s going to be the most corrupt it’s gonna be the fury’s
Lets be honest, the fight was close and could have gone either way so no guy can complain of the result, either way.
4t
Accept that you lost!!! Because you can't change the past but the future! So move on
Thank god you got your ego checked. Cause you need it badly
This thing de pain him
I dont like you nearly as much as logan and jake but you won that fight by a mile
Major respect to you JJ you always got my support!
I high key don’t care if you won or lost. I’m just here because you were one of the first black YouTubers and you are constantly an inspiration to us all. And you’re still going. Showing us that we can all achieve anything we can put our mind too.
The fucking goat
So will you be back to making music next year
Tommy made this guy depressed 😂😂😂
Welp, this is what happens when you say your gonna shock the world m8. I still love you tho ❤
in all honesty though the fight wasn’t worth the hype and i felt it was a draw. had you of punched more you probably would’ve got the win.
....
Sorry KSI mate but I think you need to accept your loss and move on.
Thanks you jj you are awesome for life
W either way!
JJ, stop talking about Tommy. It doesn't make him look worse, it makes you look extremely petty. You lost, move on.
Happy you're trying to progress from this, but publicly telling your fans to keep on insulting him, berate him in public and mentioning his parenting situation was a bit too far over the line.
Seriously man jj..... missed you and this.
jj had nothing to do in the next year he worked so hard for everything bro had everything. get the same rest as my g  ❤
Berate him in public? That’s a terrible way to use your clout
Saying to berate him in public is disgusting and saying something about someone’s parenting is disgusting… shows that this loss didn’t make you loose your ego. This will one day backfire on you 🤦🏻‍♀️
Friendly reminder that you did lose the fight and you did all that hard work for nothing, then you cried about it like a man, proceeded to insult and ridicule your opponent after losing and talk about his personal life and also gloated about your achievements. This video was very cringe ngl. No hate, but humble yourself a little bit bro
At this point you’d think that jj would have matured and learned to move on from the situation like and adult but he’s still salty and disrespectful. Says a lot about him as a person 🤷🏻‍♂️
U didn’t lose the judges cappin
Lol keep doing your starjumps kid 😂😂
😂
wants his fans to harass tommy cause he lost. WOW
Damn bro, you can’t just take your L and move on, why are you telling your fans to berate Tommy, just move on from the lost bro
Big up fam
Ngl saying that the community should remind Tommy that he "lost" is a childish sucky thing to do. You said it yourself, it sucks to lose in such way, we get it; but there's really no need to make your own community go after him just because your sense of pride and ego got hurt. In the end it was a match in which either of boxer could've won, it's about being respectful afterwards.
Bro. All you did was hug the man.
Are you still waiting for them to get back to you with the results
And you didn’t beat Tommy fury talking shit about Jake Paul😢😂😂😂😂
But if you do not forgive others, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions. (Matthew 6:15, NASB)🙌
JJ still mad.   Roasted Logan for appealing a fight. Goes and appeals it, even cried about it 😂  Then got personal bringing molly mae and his kid up.   Salty if you tell me 😂😂😂😂😂
If I am honest that fight was a double L not even a draw. It was a hugging match. There was no boxing both sides are absurd for thinking the fight went one way or another.
Sore loser behavior. Expected a video where you reflected on the loss more humbly but to tell your fans, USE your fans to berate and harass Tommy?? That’s so low. And it’s so disappointing coming from you KSI, after calling out Jake/Logan for being sore losers in the past, what you are doing now is ten times worse. I was excited to see a new humbled KSI but looks like that ain’t happening. Disappointed.
First non cringe video
This was a really embarrassing video, maybe be humble in your clear loss instead of bashing a man and his family. Disgusting as usual KSI
Don't let all the haters get to you, keep your head up. Just focus on moving on with youtube and music. There is no need to continue any kind of beef with tommy a rematch would be a waste of time, just let him fade into irrelevancy again. I understand being emotional about the situation but it's best to keep that private, there has been enough controversy this year personally I don't want to see a back and forth with the fury's.
Sorry mate you can't box
Mofuckas really be thinking jj is serious when he says berate tommy irl😂
Bro you are mates with logan the original rebound master rub some fkin dirty on it and walk it off
It would serve you and those who are influenced by you to be more real and a lot harder on yourself after how you behaved in the ring. Zero boxing displayed, all clinch, forcing fouls, and worst of all the complaining. Take some responsibility for your actions, toe to toe never happened, you were trying to win by forcing fouls rather than box.  It was no doubt embarrassing for the undercard fighters who actually tried their hardest, Fighting in the ring for your event, risking their health.
Honestly its understandable being upset about your 1st loss but you shoulda left out dudes kid.. thats goin a lil too deep..
Nah this is so wrong from you jj. Losing respect for you by the minute. Believe you won all you want but attacking his personl life, calling him a bad parent and telling your fans to berate him is so not on. Expected better from you
this is now a stop boxing or fight jake and then its done.. unless you make a competition like football with standings and points.
JJ I love you so much it’s unreal. I definitely think you won that fight and  I’ve cried so much realising that life is so unfair because someone is pri and your “not” but it’s so unfair and I’m so glad you posted to realise how you acctualy feel❤
No matter what we love you jj❤ I miss you man😅
This was kind of cringe, your obviously still furious at Tommy and not handling it well. Wouldve been so much better if you gave Tommy props and didn't roast him like you said... at the end of the day hes a father
jj supporting bullying  10/10. love it! XD
Sounds like ksi is a mug and can’t accept he lost and he should stick to YouTube glad too see thus cocky tarts downfall
whatever
You lost accept it and move on
We love you bro.
Mate you lost, end of. Stop taking it to heart and get on with being the best person you can be
You def lost that fight bro lol
Jake Paul?
Humble ksi😊
no1 won u both lost
Sometimes you need to take an L to ascend even higher
You talked smack as well before the fight. so.... Should've just made a try not to laugh instead of this.
People like JJ that don’t have kids can’t criticise other peoples parenting skills 💯 I get that he’s bitter about losing the fight and the appeal but bruh this just a new low massive L
take the L alrdy
Bro is a pure egomaniac. Needs to get seriously hurt by a more dangerous fighter.
If you want to box again and you want to be prepared mentally and physically search Rico Verhoeven and ask him for advice
bro it’s youtube boxing relax
u got a w for sure tommy is trash i would knock him out he will never beat you and he never did
Whether you won or lost, your sportsmanship was abysmal.
Stay crying forehead
KSI u won bro maybe not by points but the fact u went up against a professional boxer, the brother of a world champion who on top of that had every single physical advantage aswell is a BIG W. Also lets noy forget ur fight with him was wayyyy closer then jakes fight so thats another W.. Ur ambition amd work ethic is inspiring brother keep it up
Honestly as a big KSI fan, this is NOT how you should've responded, especially with 2 month planning.
you a salty HATER hahahhaahaha you LOST
I think JJ need to change his style. His style is basically spray and pray. Use some couple feint and follow up with a heavy strike. Yes JJ can throw heavy strikes, yes JJ has the best cardio. But, doesn't matter how long and how exhausting it is if many punches are missed the judge will not imppres
Goats back
Did better than Jake.  Idk how more don’t see that
it was a shit fight overal, you lost, lets move on we dont need to weak excuses or salt, gimme a try not to laugh or something
ksi is an entertainer, bro hugged the entire mf fight. Boring ahh fight and he expects a w too. What a clown. grow up
😂
Bro should just accept the fucking loss already. It just makes you look bad still whining about it.
The tantrum thia man had so extremely embarrassing
Embarrassing to still be going on about it lmao, everyone stopped caring about it weeks ago
He says this when ethan did the same thing to faith hes such a hypocrite 😭😭😭
crybaby you LOST!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
hi
Whos hyped for GTA 6?
Where’s the laughing at Tommy fury video lol 😂
Tommy on top
JJ you wouldve won the fight easily if you werent bouncing around and acting like a starfish keeping yourself so open and throwing the exact same punch 50 times in a row
Both of them lost. Some fucking shit boxing technique on display. What a disappointing card.  We have juniors that fight better at my gym.
Omg 6minutes of excuses
Your own corner was saying carry on hugging him and let him hit you in the back of the head you lost.
Love you bro
My man just came back to smear campaign tommy, if he was that shit, then why bother?
Yooo... JJ bring back the savage moments in sports
Bro is patting his back so hard here.
6:56 They're in the Aston Martin garage
Yes u lost, u talked so much sh*t and all you did is hugging and throwing overhands in the air, NO WAY you won that, you trained hard for that sh*t performance?!?! Maybe a drow but no way that was a W, karma got you, next time be humble
Proud of you JJ keep going man!
Bro only knew one word of Japanese and said it like he knew Japanese
Some sportsmanship would have been nice, every one of your opponents you beat congratulated you regardless of if they thought they won or not. The moment you lose you encourage your audience to berate Tommy. Been watching you since I was a kid and I don’t like the person you’ve become and it’s a bit upsetting cos you were such a funny and entertaining person who helped me stay positive and be confident in yourself.
Just take the L man. Nobody cares anymore its been 2 months
You’re the real winner of that fight we all know, you’re the real champ man. We’re always here for you JJ. Btw I’m your biggest fan from Pakistan 💚🤍
We all still love you still KSI, ksi you did well still
whats up with the cringe editing and words popping up behind his back lmao
dude became such a trashcan its crazy
Just take the loss as a man, even if they officially change it to a win it ain’t gunna feel the same
Crazy that you use being a YouTuber as an excuse for you experience there a dudes in boxing who’s start later in life and beat dudes who have been doing it for a long time that’s how the sport works loser for brining his wife and kids up
Honestly bro the fact that you were on equal ground with a “professional fighter” shows your actually pretty good if you were bad at boxing you would’ve got knocked down like Jake Paul
damn its not taking too long and i already miss your content JJ, u are the real Champ for me bro
Sore loser
After the first 3 minutes the rest is just cope lol. nice that hes back tho
I feel the fight was a draw but no matter we’re all proud of jj regardless
We need a rematch !!!
Finally 😂
L
JJ you're embarrassing yourself telling your fans to bomb Tommy´s comments that he didn't win because "three random people" said so. If the judges stick with their decision even after the appeal you have to respect it. You ain't the law, and being salty over a loss with personal attacks against someone's family isn't honourable.
You should make a teddy bear toy… you know cause it would be so much huggable
You and Jake fucked around and found out. Go back to fighting YouTubers
Jit
And you
Nop
Nop
🧢
You indeed SHOCKED the world 😂😂
ngl this is a huge KSI L, just glazing over the issues with his own form, then making so many excuses. Then to go in on tommy like that purely because hes salty. Poor from him
ksi actively advocating for his fans to harass tommy fury is the biggest cope i've ever seen
Tbh bro I thought ksi won bro
WB Champ
your still the greatest crossover boxer of all time🙌
The editing is really annoying
Idk if was just me, but frames on vid were bit sketch, but all that aside which doesn't mean much tbh, to me ksi represents the UK in boxing far more than Tommy fury, and that he's been working so hard to do everything he has and is doing, major respect 👏👏👏
W KSI!!
Shout out to Tommy Fury for humbling both KSI and Jake Paul. YouTube boxing is wrapped up now
Boss you really didn't win get over it...... it's time to be a YouTuber again
bro is publicly telling ppl to hate Tommy😂. kids are looking up to this
ksi definitely won that fight, his legacy will still live on forever, because this is all about immortality, about his name being known and remembered till the end of time✨🙌
I will say it’s pretty embarrassing that you were so dead set on an appeal you don’t see decisions overturned in boxing so it’s a joke that you think a fight of this caliber should be overturned in ur favor it was a close fight. Happens all the time
bro came back to be a sore loser💀
People’s champion KSI
Talking about his personal life is kinda shitty Icl mocking his dancing and lack of rhythm but that part wasn’t needed
Is it just me or jj looking sexy lately
Rehydration clause is fucking crazy
That bouncing BS made you lose
This video is embarrassing. Boxing match aside, he just did a whole segment criticising Tommy's personal life. And used his platform to tell the public to berate Tommy.
cut the second half of the video bro. Sure doesnt look like he got over the loss lol
Im not saying this as a hater, but it was probably the worst boxing match I have ever seen. Tommy had a decently entertaining match with Jake who was actually boxing. That means the fault is on you JJ.   Your style of just trying to rush in and land a big power shot and if you dont, clinch, wait to be separated and try again is what made this fight so shit.  You deserve the loss because the way you were fighting made it impossible for a boxing match to even happen.
what a strange video. literally just stop crying and accept the loss holy fuck
W grind tho am I right or am I right? Some people are couch potatoes. So w u man.
Proud of you and I think you should’ve won, but it is a low blow attacking how he is as a father and husband especially after the fight
I agree man you were robbed
the humble will be exalted and the prideful will fall
Bro posted a 9 min video of him crying begging for sympathy. lol you’re a bad boxer end of story.
The man is back
Almost 40 acting like this… really embarrassing
ksi best
Trained hard to hug the entire match just quit dude even Jake Paul got some moves here and there but you’re just a complete embarrassment to the sport fr. The only people who thought u won the fight are kids who know nothing ab boxing and meat riders
JJ is the definition of BEASTTTTTTTT!!!
legend
Both of you talked all the talk knockouts blablabla and it was a hug fest and people paid for that? Bro move on you lost.
Idk what's more embarrassing Tommy being horrible in that fight, the way you handled it like a child (you're 30) or the fact that 2 months later you're still talking shit and telling fans to go annoy Tommy in public etc. Move on with your life.
Proud of you bro never give up
We get you’re mad but all you’re talking about is how you almost won instead of just owning the loss… take it like a man and move on
Tommy Fury wants to be like his big brother so bad
The boxing match was a farce. Neither of you actually boxed. Very disappointing
Do you know what sucks you can’t take Logan there?😂😂
You lost fool.
L
Ksi still can’t accept he lost. Continues to try to brain wash his fans that he won it’s honestly laughable at this point. You’re a bad boxer and you will continue to duck jake forever.
I don’t give a damn u lost I need a video
Noone kares about the lossss anyway,  move on bruh.  This is youtube boxing, not Hajime no Ippo, relax.  tommy tryna be like floyd and get them exhibition fights. anyway, When is the simpson sequel gonna be out, bruh.
This has to be the biggest self jerk in the history of YouTube.
Man like ksi
YES 😂
you didnt win ether should do a laughing at ksi   get over the L
Bros really complaining about having a blessed busy fruitful life. Nobody asked for your rap music you wanted to have more money/fame lol.
Bro I feel like if anyone was in your place they would fall at the first place. After everything the stress and the the fact that you get bullied etc and still show a smile everywhere is something not a lot of people can do, We are proud of you
All of you that paid for that PPV i feel sorry for you,hug fest.
At the end of the day tommy was the one there willing to actually box and still proved he was the better fighter despite the outcome. Im not a ksi nor am I a tommy fan but regardless how many people (KSI dick riders) are trying to bully tommy in his comments:..tommy deserved the win and ksi should take this opportunity to humble his fragile ego and come back better next time. Nonetheless, KSI fanboy tears have never tasted so sweet 😩
Bro thinks he won
Kids this is what delusion gets you in life
train hard to hug a man for 6 rounds💀
😂
Went into boxing as a joke come out dangerous pretty mad everyone respects
We all know that KSI is gonna fuck around behind the back of whoever he happens to impregnate by accident...so he shouldn't really talk about how anyone else is acting as a father
All that talk before the fight, bragging saying you were gonna do this and that, just to not even phase tommy fury. Stop with all these excuses you mor0n. You lost.
Time to see how this appeal turns out
REMATCH
Sore loser
asking his fans to harass Tommy, this man is 30 btw
There are 3 judges in boxing, 3 people, "professionals" but people and their opinions can be wrong sometimes. People need to realise that. It's fully up to the majority. If everyone is saying you won the fight then you did. And who's judgement do you trust better than those dearest to you. If you truly believe you won you did.
keep hugginh
It was a trash fight either way, neither of u guys won lmao
Eh
We are proud of you fam💪🏻 we love your videos just rise up again just like always were still here for you👊🏻
I had the draw felt like i was robbed ngl
Lmao
Bruh he’s a human, all of saying your disappointed in his reaction to the loss, u would react the exact same if u worked as hard as he did, the fact that ur mid 30s and are commenting this is sad itself, get a job or smth. He’s human, just because he’s in the public eye doesn’t force him to act like superman
Why is everything music
Lemme lol a bit “LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL” I knew this would happen. You shocked the world brother ❤
The irony of you complaining about the back of the head shots lol
5:08
Just take the L like a man and move on. Fair play ksi but u a sore loser
Jj you didnt win. If could of gone either way, but stop being deluded, its clearly affecting you
youre late homie
It’s fine bro just don’t give up
bro still thinks he shouldve won 💀
You’re washed ksi
You were hugging him all the time. You weren't robbed ffs...
But u still lost
Maybe you shouldn't have hugged him the entire time
JJ, we don't want you to be the best in the world, but we only want from you the best that you can do because in our eyes win, lose or draw your amazing and will still be the most amazing thing that youtube/internet gave us.
Bro made fun of Logan for appealing and he did the same thing lmao
Chin up dont give up keep it going, first proper set back come back harder
goodshit brother Tom did lose
Cmon Ksi accept defeat and stop getting personal😂
He also took long so the hype of his L and the memes calmed down
I think it’s really embarrassing to see what Misfits has become; the fact that you guys literally had a porn site as the main sponsor for the event knowing full well your audience is primarily children is despicable.
Now fight jake the fight people actually want to see
lol
As someone who was a KSI fan a few years back, this is honestly embarrassing to watch. This video was just taking jabs towards Tommy as a person over a fight that has been finished for a while. And his tantrum he threw post fight where he kicked a screen and cried is something I’d expect from a grade schooler after losing a game of four square. Y’all are adults and acting like this. JJ’s ego is honestly really getting to him and it’s sad to see. Hope one day he sees that and reevaluates how he acts and what he says.
L
fight jake lose then retire then go back and stay on youtube
See, it's one thing to know how to fight and it's another thing to not be arrogant. No hate on JJ but he did alot of trash talking in fact too much trash talking before the fight. The loss doesn't suprise me to be honest, well I hope he changes that side about him.
Hugging doesn’t win fights sadly
Ego bigger than that forehead
lol
yo got your ass whooped. started off like a grinch bouncing around lol
Tommy beat you.
Silly to trash Tommy, it’s not his fault. I expect more from you… unless you are pushing for the rematch, then I get it.
How can you even claim to be so great but handle a loss like a 🐱? EVEN if you got outright ROBBED, the attitude and unsportsmanlike behavior is insane. All you think about is him? Telling people to outright HATE on him and encourage it? Kids look up to you, and you’re going to promote bullying because you don’t like someone? This is just constant proof to me and others that you aren’t a true man, and your built on shakey foundations as a man and an athlete. Never seen such sore losing and un-sportsmanship in my life
Bro if you can already tell he is a shit pro boxer then fight a good one ffs. Since you have come so far with boxing don’t fucking end it here man. Not seeing you realise so much potential would be the real shame. But at the end of the day you do you innit.
LOSER
This new editing style is too much, so extra! I couldn’t watch more then an minute
Coming from me as a fresh parent, you telling your fans to berate him publicly, a fresh parent, if someone sees him is just as low.. didnt think you could sink there champ.. think of your fanbase and what lengths they actually go for you, before you actually say something like that..
This is so embarrassing coming from ksi. No respect
Bro said that he did WWE like if he was wrestling
Damn , you lost…. Accept it and stop crying and making excuses! Lol
Almost 2 months later, he still can’t take a loss. The egoism is crazy AND BROTHER the way you sneaked into his personal life is crazy + telling viewers to humiliate him in the public IS CRAZY! What are you thinking and what happened to you? You went from a kind soul to an egoistic 12 year old who can’t even take a loss? Im disappointed and im not gonna support anyone with this kind of toxic behaviour. 😐
ITS REWIND TIME!! KSI EDITION
Honestly big L for Lsi not just for the match but how he handled it
what about the appeal tho? has it come out yet?
Man none of us care that you lost, we been here since 2011 and we will always love you. Never in a million years did I ever think the guy who made fifa funnies and race to division 1 would ever box a professional fighter from the Fury family and almost beat him. You’re the goat, now go and fuck up Jake Paul
Dude, watching over the years watching the progression, your evolution, you need more time to yourself and family. Relax, keep positive, stay strong 💪
This is a common trend with the fury family. This fight and his scammer of his brother robbed all off fights
Ksi the people’s champ!!
You’re trying to make this video motivational whilst sneaking in a childish rant?
Why bring up Tommy's private life like that? Was that a very professional thing to do?
Hahaha mate, you lost. Get over it. It happens, and it was completely fair, yes it was close but he did out point you. End of story Jake knocked him down and you didn’t let’s run you and Jake hahaha
You can’t say that a “Little untalented nerd” held up against Tommy Fury, because that’s clearly not you anymore. Don’t try to blow this out of proportion, you’ve been training for years and still can’t handle a loss.
just please change your boxing style JJ... Karate stance isn't for boxing watch all the great boxers and im sure there's a style that suits for you in one of them.. im a big fan of yours and i hate seeing you lose!! come on JJ !!
Bro ksi your calm down you one every one knows it its just for money
Even if you did lose, the road to greatness is about the journey, not only the result. You did great and it can only make you stronger.
well well well look who just uploaded
A girl I rly liked at work rejected me today so I feel the pain brother (prob not on same scale)
Man a lot of these comments are sensitive as hell😭😭😭 if yall are shocked about JJ talking negatively about Tommy then get off his channel bc what do yall expect? JJ has always been this way with people he doesn’t like
So he's chosen to be deluded still. That's a shame. Only guy who took the W away was you. Refused to engage, constant clinching and throwing less punches. Silver spoon kids can't take no
Tommy won only because of the cheeky hit and hug tekkers. I think the judges saw the cheap tactics that was being used. I feel if you actually boxed and not be cheap then you would of had a better chance. This ain’t a diss it’s just self realisation. We respect both fighters and hope you guys run it back but yeah Tommy was the better boxer unfortunately
Jj, we are so proud of you!!!❤️
Bro it was Obvious u were gonna lose.
nah mate you lost that fight
That video is so unnecessary saw a lot of people clowing him after the loss for the way he acted even  tho i totally  get it,when you put yall into  something and you feel like you got robbed aint gonna be an easy thing to control but telling people to harass him on the streets its so stupid specially to an easily impressionable audience
Proud of you KSI.
Bros still making excuses on the fight
Love that you’re back and I wish you all the best❤️ but judging someone’s parenting is never the way to go imo, you’re better than that.
We were proud before and after he fight of you man, real inspiration and proof how far very hard work can take you!
Dont matter we know u won that fight even tommy know inside he lost 😂😂😂
Ok , now take the L like a champ , and let’s all of us move on
you look young for 30
We are proud of you regardless of whatever those judges were sniffing
Even if you deserved to win why bring up Tommy’s parenting and tell your fans to harass him. Just move on man like come on your better than this.
Proud of you JJ❤️
Bro it’s been like 2 months
The result was changed to ksi winning after the judges made the error saying that fury won by mistake
Thing is, they can't really have a YouTuber beat a pro boxer since it woulda kinda ruin the reputation of the sport. Just rigged really.
L
no one cares, fight jake paul and stop crying
Pathetic response
I did wrestle mania 😂😂😂😂 brother that was several months before the fight 😂😂
bro's talking about tommy's family like he should be the one raising molly mae's kid with her not tommy.
I really dont see how ksi is so sure he won after that performance. You were holding so damn much dude. You did well against a quote on quote professional. But man you didn't come to fight, you came for a hug fest
so proud of you man
If KSI think he won, he won. The judges obviously didn't want him to win. If you think you won in your head and lost officially then use it as a positive
You hugged him for the entire fight lol
Lets be Proud that ksi posted video 🎉❤
This is pathetic.  You lost.  You cried about it.  Now you’re telling us to harass your opponent because you can’t get over it.  I’d hoped this loss would humble you and make you reflect on your ego, but it looks like you need to get knocked clean out for that to sink in. Sad.
So you lost, your ego was shat on, took u over a month to come back, made a YT video addressing it and you still believe you won ?💀 like seriously dude you need a reality check that u aint some kind of a Mohammed Ali, you just a YTuber swimming in money, leave it as is💀
Yes
You lost mate let it go LLLLLL
https://m.twitch.tv/mcslimmyjim go watch:)
jj no matter what we're all so proud of you
This man won.   U cant have blind people judge sport, much like u cant polish a turd
Eh if you would you would have made a video the next day. At least you were a little honest
bro just take the loss getting into his personal life is pretty low. sure maybe he’s not the greatest guy but you look bad making this video.
Trained hard in hugging or what? Lmao
KSI finally got humbled
No one felt like you won the fight, you clinched and did sweet fk all. Embarrassing mate
❤️
you got closer to beating him then jake paul, youre winning in life with all these businesses and it is better than any “normal” individual
Pretty pointless video jj you lost you beat him at dancing and hugging take the L and move on, used to love your videos but of late you've become far to full of yourself it's an unsub good luck for the future
dudes tryna milk it so hard on the night the judges thought tommy was better so it is what it is.
Help me pls jj
People who was watching know you won KSI
simple answer, yes.
JJ won so it’s fine. Anyone who says otherwise didn’t watch.
Does this mean fatneek is coming back
Biggest cope
Boxing is just rigged for the Fury's
tommy's in his head man
Brotha brotha, you said you had time to think about this... To be frank this isnt the way to handle the situation, stop trying to harrass Tommy and be the bigger man
Hahahahahaaa you lost 🤣
I really thought he wasn't going to post
Shitting on a man’s personal life after he rightfully won against you. What a great person ksi is.
i jus miss ksi
It takes two men to tango🤔star jumps don't cut it as "hanging with a pro boxer."
0:38 "life isn't fair" coming from a millionare with a music, boxing and youtube career he can keep set with
Common JJ 9 min clip it kind of made me happy but it was not heart filling i need more of you man keep posting those funny videos you are a entertainer thats what you are thats what you do best thats why we love you
KSL
all the bumlickers in the comments man, not acknowldgeing how weird this guy has been handling the loss, and how bad his ego has been these last couple of years, ive supported JJ for many years now man, but ngl, to send your fans to harrass a guy jus cause u lost is a new low man. jus let it go, and its sad cause your fans are probably gonna ignore that weird shit, and say "we are so proud of you" not acknowledging all your wrong-doings recently.
Taking personal shots at Tommy and asking your fans to harass him was honestly quite disappointing from you. You had a whole month to cool down and yet here you are, being salty as all hell.
Liverpool for life!!!!!
this is so cringe
If I’m being honest you lost jj. And it was deserved because you were being a melon n the buildup
JJ just take it like a man doing all of that nonsense dissing tommy fury personal life is not needed and it’s kinda sad
it doesn't matter if it's labelled as a loss if the majority of the public believe that KSI won. That itself has more weight than 3 judges and some committee
Broooo.. really came back to cry about the loss and tell he’s been spying on tommy  Just move on JJ no point in directing hate to him anymore
Lol
love you jj
I don’t necessarily agree with you saying people should berate him in public, especially cause he’s a father, nor do I agree with you coming at him as a parent but i do think you won and I hope you keep coming out on top regardless. Don’t lose sight of the goal you have, we all know how important legacy is to you. Much love jj 💜
Nah bruv ngl this video is extremely sad. You seriously need a reality check. Your ego is so over inflated at this point over a loss it's becoming worrying. Jake Paul handled losing to Tommy Fury better then you. The fight was nearly 2 months ago and your still talking about it while talking rubbish about Tommy Fury (and how he is as a father etc) and telling your audience to go and berate him in public if you see him. Do you not know how big your audience is? They aint gonna go berate him. They will insight violence on sight. The twitter replies said from fans against fury is bad enough as is after the match in october until now. I don't like either Tommy or Jake but they seemingly handle similar things way better then you while your still holding a nearly 2 month grudge.
tbh this loss is more of a w than a L a youtuber that started boxing a few years ago made a fight competitive with someone who’s been boxing since he could talk
JJ for me you won no doubt, don't let that get to you even if you lost you are still KSI get back up and go knock out that Jake Paul
Everyone point and laugh at jj he lost if anyone of us in the comment were in the ring we would’ve seen red and that bozo would’ve been cooked all I’m saying 😏
they didn't take it away from you just get over it
What is your technique LOL
Ksi vs Tommy 2
daddy KSi
Pathetic. Telling your fans to harass a man who rightfully won against you and then attacking him on being a father. If you were a “boxer” like you claim, you don’t carry the shit talking after the fight, especially when you already didn’t prove it in the ring.
KSI WON BRO THESE JUDGES DONT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING
Don't care if you lose bro, you've come far from this journey don't ever stop man
Bro didn't post for like a month. No one cares that you lost hes one of thebest boxers in the world bro.
Mannn i wish you just took this one, and left it there. You're not gaining any sympathy and asking to barade him.. come on man what we doin?
Jj you need to just understand that you lost. Losing can happen sometimes. Even Mike Tyson has lost a few fights. But he got over them and moved on. The games the game mate
what a cringe egoistical manchild
I think most of us would rather people thinking we won the fight then thinking we should of lost!!!..... You did us all proud and thats the main thing... WHAT A LEGEND!!!🤝
This has humbled you, its what was needed
JJ WE LOVE YOU ‼️‼️‼️ DW JUST MAKE SURE YOU DOIN GOOD ND WE GON B IGH🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
This video felt waaaay over edited to the point its hard to watch, it doesn't need a fucking zoom-in filter change every time he giggles
you lost so man up, shut up, and get over it.
lol he lost
This guy still crying about the loss should be crying how terrible his boxing is
❤❤❤❤
Mate its good that you like to win but take this loss on the chin and come back stronger.
That ego doesn’t look good on you
bro it isn't that deep
Waiting nearly a month and still sticking to the opinion that he won the fight.... Then shitting on fury still a sore loser.
How can you shit on Logan for being a sore loser then do this? After the appeal he congratulated you and took his loss like a man, you’ve sat here and told your fans to harass the person you lost against.
Such an L of a video, it's utterly biased with no self reflection whatsoever. Give Tommy his dues and move on, it's a better look than all this salty sniding bullsh#t.
Rematch
wonder how much money the fury family paid the judges for this smh
konichiwa :D
Nah you lost the fight twice. Once when Tommy was crowned victor. Twice when you threw a tantrum like a child
KSI lost fairly tell me I’m wrong
JJ you must realize that you boxed very poorly and i'd bet you know deep down you can do  better. The holding is what cost you the win.  Tbh both of you were awful and it was a draw.   I know we all love JJ but we owe it to him to be brutally honest.
YOU LOST!!!!!!!
🙌🙌👏👏
Hugging king why you hugged him so much is the question
In my opinion, you won that fight and yes we miss you, I'm glad you are back, we also miss Mo.
Unnecessary video. You lost the fight, but your ego seems to still win... Im happy u got your vacation and all that, but damn! Why tell your fans to keep reminding Tommy that he lost a fight he actually won? The three "random people" weren't random people, they were the judges g.
Hi JJ. Its cool to see you finally uploaded and yes, i agree with you. Tommy shouldn't of won. Its should've been a draw or a W for you cause of the point deduction.   However, telling people to go out in public and "berate" Tommy is not cool and too far. There are a lot of messed up people out there who have no chill and dgaf. Especially if if Tommy's child was with him. The fight is over, there doesn't need to be drama anymore. Just focus on your life and let Tommy focus on his
Take the loss, all this whining is so cringy wtf. The fight was terrible anyway this video is embarrassing honestly.
Bro you should have just come back and left it, Its past and done now, we didnt need to hear anything about tommy fury, Tommy fury was dead until you did this video, Should just let the whole thing die and move on, And the fact is no one is even looking at you like you lost that fight, seriously, You've come out of it like Nagannou in the fury fight, Yes you lost but no ones looking at it like that. Tommy Fury is irellivent now, Let it go and dont even think of a rematch.
You clearly lost
stop crying already shit is months old.
Zzz
I Don't understand how Jj saw doing starjumps, hugging and punching wildly to tommy's back of the head as a win? Dude you lost, and your fight wasn't clean. Admit it already
When Deji was on his losing spree you told him to be humble in defeat, now you’re making videos judging Tommy’s parenting and telling your fans to harass him publicly and on social media.. you lost and none of that will change that fact bro.. you can have all the deluded people in the world telling you that you won but it is written in stone that you lost and that’s what it is
Encouraging people to berate Tommy is not a good idea. Whilst I am personally inspired by your journey. You've lost respect from me for that, we should only encourage the best out of each other. Tommy at the end of the day is still a kid at only 24. He'll learn. Whilst you for sure didn't lose, you didn't win so don't be a sore loser.
Hearing KSI talk about the fight is like if Goku at the end of the saiyan saga about Vegeta. "you were hanging with a low-class warrior." type energy.
5:48 the whole video he cried about how hard he worked and then he goes on to discredit himself just to feel better abt himself how sad
Wow he waited a while for this
what's the point in directing hate towards tommy now?
That’s pretty fucked up and delusional telling your fans to pretty much torment Tommy fury. Every pro boxing fan thinks you lost only YouTubers ufc and wwe fans think you won but they don’t know boxing fam. Ksi I love you but that was just unnecessary taking digs about his family
Bro toke 1month to put together a videos of people saying that win as a excuse to how he was rob not performing as how u planned LMAOOOOO do better 🤣😂💯
I usually support the actions you take. But this video was just pity tbh. Very classless and unlike you
So ksi loses which sets up the perfect fight for ksi vs jake and jake says he wants the fight right away but ksi runs away and says hes taking a break. Yeah ok its clear ksi is running from jake yet again
Nobody cares about the loss JJ we all know you won thanks for going out there and making us proud ❤
In fairness the older brother couldn’t do it either both got handled imo
You’re petty, unsubscribed
You’re giving off jake Paul energy man. Telling people to harass him or going after him on a personal level
I can’t believe he said with a straight face “all my yes man said I won!“ Ksi lost because he wasn’t good enough to beat him! If your hard work wasn’t enough! Sorry to say that, but that’s life! Humble yourself, you look like a sore loser! You said that it’s hilarious that he couldn’t knock you out, just speaks more about you, he was in bad shape! And you couldn’t finish the job, in a way that made it clear you won no doubt, that fact that there is no clear winner, despite all your hard work, speaks volumes! and the fact that you said you hate losing, should tell you how you clearly seeing things from that perspective of I hate losing so there is no way I lost after all that hard work!
Cl now your just being childish
WJJ
JJ I want you to know that your behavior after the fight made me mad and sad You have to learn how to accept a defeat like a man and like a real athlete We still all love you
That fight was a tie both sucked
Ayooo!
Nah you’re going after him personally now man. The Reddit is right that’s too far nah
The amount of hugging you did during the fight was crazy lmao
more excuses and delusion sad to see i hoped he would be humbled but he is a manchild
Clearly he hasn't got over the fight since he just told everyone to harass Tommy...that's a pretty shit thing to say even if you're just a random persom let alone being big on social media. Also he's commenting on Tommy leaving the kid alone and shit like that like that's none of anyones business and he's just putting it out there...so childish...I used to love seeing you post and be yourself but this kind of behaviour pushed me away not that you or anyone cares...just be better...you will earn a lot more respect from people if you change your attitude
JJ this is not it...
I guess ksi doesn’t believe in being humble in defeat sorry you lost but low blow attacking Tommy’s character in this video like yes he should have finished u off but seriously this is petty af.
chin up and stay humble
took a loss like a child it was pathetic kicking the advertising board like a child isnt how to handle an L
Best boxing response video on the net
Miss this boy❤
JJ that tweet from Jake wasn't him saying you won... he was taking the piss out the whole event lol
I’d say Ksi probably would’ve won if he was a boxer, the appeal was never going to overturn the result, really and truly he needed to win against Tommy more convincingly
Well lets forget it n laugh it off..
Bright side you can fight jake paul
both KSI and Ngannou were robbed... are the judges just RACIST??
Men don't kick and cry bc they lost infront of the world
you lost, shows the kind of person you are still holding a grudge about it.
We love you man, doesn't matter if you lost...We've been seeing you for years and we know your hardwork and everything...🥊You won and your fans and world knows that...@ksi
JJ u lost bro, take it like a man, telling your fan base to berate him is under you.  Move forward and keep getting better. grow from this and move on
well
Bro just move on. We all know you won that fight. Its difficult to accept it but that's life. You win some and you lose some. Just keep working hard and entertaining us ❤️
I mean i get your angry but beginning to talk about him as a father and stuff is kind of low. Just take the loss like a man and btw the world doesnt think u won.
LOL
u still the goat brudda
Turns out you wernt the guy who could see John cena or knew Victoria’s Secret
30 year old man right here, sending out his brainwashed 14-year old fans to harass the guy who beat him fair and square. These youtubers will never become full grown men, they will remain scummy little children for the rest of their lives.
I don't think Tommy is thinkin' about you as much as you're thinkin' about him.
Ksi is the Goat 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
It was an awful, scrappy fight. And I thought u won 57/56, but either way… Fury is embarrassing and will get found out eventually
KSI STILL DA GOAT THOUGH
The copping of this man is on another level 🤦 and the d glazers in the comments are just as pathetic as he is. Take the L and move on
👑
Keep your head up Jj. We all know you won, You mad all of us fans proud. Take a break and when it’s time go finish what you stated, and fuck up Jake Paul. 😈
Idk whats more embarrassing Tommy being horrible in that fight, the way you handled it like a child (you're 30) or the fact that 2 months later you're still talking shit and telling fans to go annoy Tommy in public etc. Move on with your life.
KSI standin on buidness
Buddy is scrapping for any bit of W he scrap together from this situation is sad AF
Bro, I'm not going to lie this is such an L video. You just highlighted all the people on your side, and didn't give Tommy any credit. We all know on points you lost, get over it please. Set up the rematch give Tommy his dues and let it go, it's so sad to see you strung up on this phantom "robbery". It was an awful fight
Ksi got robbed
You lost little man get over it!
Bro coping so hard
Oh no. KSI is in his Jimmy Butler Emo phase
Bro got humbled and still cant accept the L
You’ve proved everyone that you can accomplish anything in your life if you put enough hard work and determination into the things you are passionate about. I love your energy talking about these things, which proves how every person can learn and improve even after unfortunate events like these. Learn from KSI.
You’ve boxing for 6 years, not 3
Ksi endorsing harassment cause he lost? Crazy man relax.
6:29 is cringe
Aw man 😢,but it's not over yet Remember that music KSI  Why do you gotta Tear my heart out leave me  in the rain why do I always tell myself  it's not over yet
Yes you lost, no appeal can change that boy 😂
You are amazing bro. Keep that head up it is so impressive what you have managed to do in everything you touched.
6:39 weirdo
In my books you win that fight, no way tommy won that
Only disappointed you doing business with Logan. He is a scamming parasite that don’t deserve anything in this world.
Rip Lilmaxkid he will be missed
Don't stress yourself. Imho,, you won.
him talking about Tommy's personal life, judging him and shitting on him as a father shows how much of a sad sore loser he really is , i mean why would u go that far lol , the fight is done
Aaaaah don't mind me, just smoking on that ksi pack hahahahah TRASH performance, can't even handle the loss like a man, hugging the whole fight and pretending like those back of the head shots actually hurt you,  what a P 🐈🤣
Finally a tittle I would never see, he put it in his video :) you lost, just congrats tommy and stop being a soar loser
Come on jj, I understand why you're disappointed but life ain't fair. With this, you just look like you are making excuses and just crying over spilt milk. If you really want to do something, then just get better to the point where there is a clear difference in skill, instead of blaming the judges 😑. I know my comment is insignificant but I expected more from you for some reason, was kinda let down. Still love you and send my support 😁👍 keep being you.
We know... You were the last person to get that.
Bro sped up his sparring video 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yes you lost. What a pitty video
bro we gotta be serious and understand tommy couldn’t win against someone who didn’t wanna box and clinch the entire time
JJ. You are still King. Let’s just keep Moving Forward.
Hey can we all agree that this seems pretty childish of KSI this feels like something he would have made fun of if it was happening to someone else after he won the fight because he made fun of Joe Weller after he lost the fight he made fun of Logan Paul after he lost the fight he made fun of Andrew Tate and Alex Wassabi for not fighting him and he made fun of swarms after he beat him does genuinely feels like something he would have made fun of if it happened to someone else
KSI you do have talent and this talnet is the ability to put maximum effort into everything you do so that the outcome is success. Yout legacy if proof of this talent.
I feel like this loss was needed foe him to understand what is really important in life. I still think he has a long way to go, but I see he's starting to understand that winning / losing doesn't make his legacy. Hopefully he can let it go and focus on what makes his legacy great again!
Your friends say that you have won. Both Ariel Helwani and Jake didn’t say you won
Big L brudda. You literally have no skill despite "training"
Honestly how much shit fury was talking and he barely touched ksi is sad 💀
Bro didnt lose tho...
U lost bro juss get over it cry baby
JJ we will be always with you!! More power to you❤
Good to see you back G 😎
Such a sore loser man😂😂
What about the elbow?
We love you man so much  And you are the winner.❤
U did not win the fight, anyone that says u did is just trying to cope
KSI we in the middle east we all We all agreed that you were deceived because the referees did not want the YouTuber to win over a boxer. You destroyed Tommy Fury and everyone watched you. Be proud of yourself.
growing up means u stop watching ksi …. been a while since i clicked on his vids
For once, JJ is the definition of "The People's Champ". And i actually was low-key depressed this wasn't a reddit video lol
Ksi handling this loss worse then Logan Paul it’s embarrassing you lost get over it all you did was jump around and hug 😂
U lost
Bro he’s just a sore loser ffs
You lost
as a KSI fan this was a tough watch. a 30 year old man baby telling his young fans to berate tommy in public is disgusting, unprofessional and shows a massive loss in integrity for JJ 😂. KSI is turning into Jke Paul it's sad
Ksi seems salty lol damn 😂
So you waited a month just to say the same excuses about losing. Your a sore loser man, you gotta fix that. You lost.
Put titles on the line when fighting Jake Paul and fight him at 185 or 193  maybe 200
I’m big fan of Ksi but the fight he gave us was just horrible only real people well tell u that wasn’t ur best fight u didn’t keep ur guard up or use any combos or jab just wild and reckless I still don’t believe tommy won just if u would’ve been more cleaner with how yo fight style was it would’ve been a easier decision
He once was a guy who likes to sleep with horses.but now look at him.
Low blow about his kid
No hate bro but...humbled?
Welcome back king 👑👑👑👑👑
Telling your fans to harass him in real life is kinda too far imo 🤨
Honestly just missed a JJ Upload 😂
Bro u lost
Can’t complain really about losing the fight when all you done was hug him so man up stop crying about it and move on
The cope is crazy
So Proud of you Brother ❤ Really. ❤
JJ it really doesn’t matter, you’re the winner in our eyes ❤
so JJ finally makes a video again, brother i thought he would never make a video again, but yeah im really glad to see my best content creator back.
Rematch Tommy please I would love to see you fight him again
The man jj is back still love you no matter what
Sore loser
Bro can’t accept a loss
I hate how everyone is saying “if you’re a true supporter you’d still be proud” I’m a supporter but you acted like a 5 year old after that fight. True supporters call out childish behavior no one should be proud of you after that.
I love everything you do Jj your my idol and I wanna be just like you
Lose is lose dont matter if 1inch or 1mile. It is what it is. Move on lad
Why is he wearing the headphones tho?
Couldn’t careless you lost/robbed whatever all tthe way from Nigeria you are still one of the best humanbeings on Youtube😅
Tbh we don’t care just give us more YouTube vids and this will suffice
Nice huggin match, you definitely should have won that one
sore loser
Just take the loss like a man
Telling your fans to harass a guy just becuase you lost to him is not the way chief. Just accept it and move on and try to be better instead of being salty and encouraging harassment
I think in his weight class he beats every YouTuber an influencer on misfits 🥊
we're all proud of you jj ❤
Bro, you lost. I love you and your videos but come on bro… fix your boxing skills. You look good in training and on pads but in the ring it looks like you have had at most 4 months of training. Trust me just do what everyone does and keep your hands up. I’m a competitive k1 fighter and trust me, everyone I know, and everyone I’ve fought would agree that you are shit in the ring
Love you JJ and always super proud of you ❤
I mean, being angry about the loss is one thing but asking your fans to harass him both publicly and socially is just immature.
I mean the judges have their own opinion . How often do robberies in boxing get overturned ? I’m talking straight robberies. You found yourself in a close fight so I wouldn’t even call it a robbery and you lost . Is what it is .  And if Tommy Got a point reduction , it felt premature honestly . And ksi never got any warning for the excessive clinching , and how fast that ref took a point of Tommy ? One should have came off ksi for sure . And when I say it was premature ? Back of the head shots ? Ksi is literally known for doing so
Bro you've come from so far! We're proud of you JJ 😎💯
NDL
Our winner ❤️🔥
L
Broski still crying 😂
Took you this long to even consider the fact you lost..? Course you lost.
Much love JJ❤
todays my birthday
Been watching you from the very beginning…. Win or lose… We’re soo proud of you… Your the true inspiration
Tommy has ruined him mentally.
No matter who you think won, absolutely every single person that watched it lost. We got Tommy Fury's sloppy ass boxing and KSI doing star jumps in some weird pseudo-karate stance. The whole thing looked stupid. Imagine paying all of that money for training partners, and on the night you come out doing star jumps. And even then, being salty abut it.
L
hubris
Still to this day id say jj won the fight.. "Life isn't fair" 🙂 Anyways we are there for you jj and we're so proud of you g
ngl JJ this video sounded a lot like copium
We are all so proud of you. You fought a professional boxer that's a win even if it's a loss.
win or lose, your still the best, the fact you still kept going forward shows your 10x better than anyone, you didnt give up, all you needed was the love from your friends,family and the love from your supporters because that is what makes you, YOU 🤟
Nobody is disappointed in you jj just the way you handled it wasn't humble and telling your fans to harass another man is petty
We all know who the real winner was and it was you jj I'm so proud of how far you've come and the haters can hate as much as they want but they will never do what u can do they will never gain the success u have in life so proud of u jj
Ksi definetly didnt win, if you actually watched the fight u clearly see that Tommy did best. If not, then it would be a draw, there is no way KSI won it. I think he should focus on what he did wrong and improving it instead of denying his loss. He repeatedly went for big overhands and didnt keep his guard up at all, he just wasnt prepared enough
i wish I was exhausted making millions $$$ instead of being exhausted making 10
proud of you JJ.
U didn’t lose but Alr somehow these judges are rigged
Bro just stop he won period if you cant handle this loss you probably shouldn't continue boxing cause jesus you're petty asf
old news... you lost ages ago
We’re still proud
You lost ksi accept it there's been multiple controversial wins in boxing ufc youre not the only one move forward train  harder the next time you fight Tommy go for the knock out to silence the heaters
You lost take that L, I hate all this bs and slandering. KSI buddy your no boxer and your an amazing YouTuber stick to that, you have kids to back you  loool TOMMY WON move like a true man and take it on the chin lol. You can’t do everything in life and that’s just the truth, you lost and you’re pissed loool simple stop this bs  Peace much love
You lost deal with it
Still very proud of you jj been watching you since fifa 14 and it’s been a long journey and I’m grateful to have seen you grow and become an inspiration.. god bless ❤️
KSI the Goat
Respect JJ, glad your back 🫡
Proud of you Man. You are the one and only KSI. Keep it up Bro!
ksi lost the fight and we lost respect for yt boxing
Give me a ps5
You aren't doing better at all. Still salty, still a cry baby, he beat you, deal with it and move on. Getting your fan boys to attack him is just insanely immature
Bro KSI has taken the loss too much on him.
It’s so obvious your salty when making the digs are Tommy just accept u loss ur trying to say that overall u came out on top and all that which isn’t true ego got way to big
9:13 bro just take the L nothing wrong in that
keep crying mate
This definition of man child and scumbag. 30 year old btw
Judges just sucked tonys fury d bro don't worry😂
Where’s lil max kid at now 🤣🤣
We’re very happy you’re back Ksi🙌🏼
An L is an L man. Just take it and keep it moving. Had 0 investment in the fight and I don't think either pulled up in spectacularly rare form. You trained like you were supposed to, came in an underdog, and you could have chose to leave as the people's champ without any added fuel to the flame. No need to be the guiding hand in the narrative or to be sour at the judges decision. Glad you were able to get the rest you needed and spend some time with the fam. 💯
nooo you Didn't win the fite
Honestly. Kai is the best and most organically popular YouTuber of all time. He is a legend, he has done nothing but good content for his fans and always stays loyal to family and friends. Being a fan since 2013, hes the only YouTuber that I still watch from the golden years
LSI 🍆
Ksi won he got robbed
Living legend i am talking about 3 juges who goes against the world being dumb ❤❤
Fam you won a lot we really don’t care if you lost or won you are a winner to us in our eyes you’re always a winner.
I also think you won that fight even if it was really close, but congrats either way! 5 years ago who would’ve thought you’d be in this position bro
Now you feel what GGG felt 🇰🇿
14 yr old bots in the comments hating on a guy that made a pro boxer look bad.
low blow ...
L
Wallahi KSI is the real top g
JJ I am proud of u each way win lose draw you went toe to toe with a pro boxer dw we all know Tommy fury is a disgrace same as he’s dad such an embarrassment of the sport of boxing but anyway JJ keep doing what u do king ❤️😎
You really can't take a loss and I don't even like Tommy Fury
"Be humble, sit down."           - Kendrick Lamar
JJ I love you and your content but honestly theres no way you won that match, it was a hugging fest, wasn't your usual self there.
That was your problem because realistically you could beat him but you kept putting in your head that it’s so hard for you beating him or “he’s much better than me i gotta train hard” shoulda went in there being who you are just straight confidence and you would’ve destroyed him.
Remach him then if you think you won
It was a bad fight dawg u hugged him the whole time
Fury 3,4,5,6 man I’m sorry. But you did your best
Bullying tommy is pretty wack, jj.. u also didn't do what you promised btw, so you shouldnt speak so bad about him
NO YOU DID NOT LOSE. WE ALL SAW WHAT HAPPENED. WAITED FOR THE APPEAL. AND THEY STILL ROBBED YOU. ITS UNBELIEVABLE HOW MUCH THE FURY NAME IS PROTECTED WE ALL KNOW YOU WON (bare minimum a DRAW)
99% of people think you’re lost. Take it as a sign.
You lost bro
How is any of this Tommy’s fault? Why do you want fans to harass him in public and online when he’s done what he was supposed to do and go box you. It’s the judges that messed up and the commission. Tommy is and was just doing what he was supposed to do and that is box you to his best abilities. The result has nothing to do with him
JJ really needs to stop attacking Tommy Fury. This is embarrasing. JJ is acting like a sore loser
YOU DIDN’T WIN, YOU LOST! 😂 you just threw over hands and hugged the whole fight, COPE more! 😂 why are you obsessed with Tommy lol? Just get over it 😂
damn so humble in defeat, as a fan from the fifa days, this is cringe, u have alot of new gen kiddos following in ur footsteps atleast be humble in defeat and accept the fact that u lost. we will respect u more for accepting defeat and not acting like a lil kid crying, take it as hate if u wanna do it even tho its just honesty
no need to go on tommy like that, its over idk how he will continue his boxing journey but all this shit is in the past now, its a new era for ksi
“If you see him in public, berate him” What kind of sick response is that
Bro move tf on. Go back to being JJ like damn dude.
Bring Q&A back
Either way, at best it would have been a tie or win by single point again. You continually only just win, it's never impressive to watch
You’re still crying after 2 months
we love ya JJ
had solid points until 6:47 ..cheap petty comments here. Just makes you look bitter when you looked well collected otherwise. Head up you'll bounce back, please don't stoop to Jake level.
He does realise he's had a much bigger break between vids than this recently right? 😂
What else did you expect? You hugged 20 times 😂
Happy ksi lost, he needs to get humbled. But hate to see JJ also gets hurt, jj is a wholesome dude
Used to be a fan but the after fight attitude and whining was pathetic. Then the appeal just topped it off. He should have manned up and admitted your elbow in your previous fight.  Fair play for training so hard and trying new things. you just need to be humble in defeat.
You deffo beat Tommy i watched the fight ksi won
Dude is making a lot of excuses to try and make his loss look like it isnt so bad lol. ONLY people who thought you won wasbyour meat rider fans. Tommy boxed, You came to have a hugging contest. Youre not mentioning the negative contest youre getting on your twitter posts as well. Either fight jake or retire
Bro good job and all but you're totally misusing the word graft..... even in the slang context 😂
Idc about the result. Your journey motivated me so much JJ thank you.
Heyyy there you are  Missed you JJ.  GG’s man. I still think it was a tie
Finally this black boy uploaded after all that trash talk
couldnt jj just drop it all and not keep this drama going? the fight was boring and so is the argument between who won
Lets be honest we all knew you were going to lose
ksi i agree with u but it definitely would of been a better look if u would of been more humble even if u felt like u won. its a bad look on how much u are complaining, good job though
you won absolutely
“It’s time to shock the world” should be a curse
Nobody thought you win the fight, they thought that there was no fight
<3
I mean I’m not really knowledgeable when it comes to boxing but even a dumbass like me could see that it was roughly in jj’s favor you know something is up
You lost man
tommy and his whole family are not good boxers, they're pretty much a shame for the boxing community, frauds that pays Judges and a highly tables at the Boxing appeals.
What took you long to notice that you loss....😂 its obvious, just accept it and move on....
That’s why it’s good to stay down to earth or you will fall hard
very toxic message at the end to Tommy Fury... You clearly haven't processed the loss.
This should show as well that mental health is no joke. No matter how much money you can earn every face has a story
KSI you won that fight man! Even within yourself you won! Be proud stay proud and continue to be you and you only! ♥️🌻🦋💛
The salt in this video bro 😂
JJ, it was a match and you lost. This is boxing, this isn’t an anime and you aren’t the main character
Be humble in defeat
Bro works 10× less than a normal person and still says that his life is hard and hess been working and wants a break , bros beeen on a break for the past decade technically, f u
Why would you say if you see him in public berate him and remind him ksi won and comment it on his post can you not get over it you know your fan base will do it don’t try say and it was a joke dude it’s the past just move forward like damn
No one was disappointed in the loss, we were disappointed in the way you handled it.
JJ don’t get me wrong we are still proud of you but my guy you clinched the dude nonstop like 76 clinches or something like that so the performance was very mid and dare i say jake paul did better? Because he actually fought the guy and knocked him down but still it’s still embarrassing for tommy fury that he didn’t knock you out
Big up bro So proud of what you've achieved   I hope to achieve better than that soon
As a fan since way back during the Fifa funnies era, it's incredibly inspiring to see how far JJ has come from those times. It's personally moved me into doing better in my life and to have a better mentality on things.   However, after this loss, I'm truly disappointed not in the fact that JJ lost but how he's been handling it. I mean when you have this large following and platform, I think JJ should be aware that he's setting examples for his fans and people that want to do the same things he's done in his life. And this is an extremely poor example he's setting right now by not taking the Loss on the chin and owning up that he should not have acted the way he did post-fight. I'm sure everybody understands how upset you'd feel after losing but to essentially throw a tantrum and try to start this pity party in front of the MILLIONS of viewers & fans around the world is truly disappointing as a fan because many fans including myself expected better from JJ.   I know JJ won't read this and I don't care about reddit enough to try to get the message across to him but as fan for all these years, all I can say to JJ is to do better than this man. All of this twitter rambling and posting how salty you are after your loss to continue to clown somebody who beat you is NOT who I expected you to be after your first loss. Set a better example to your fans and continue to grow as a person. Otherwise you'll just burn out.
KSI whatever it says about tommy's "legacy" 7:50 you are acting like a sore loser and a bad sport, you complaining and publicly shaming him and trying to spur hate over a loss that happened months ago is so sad and disappointing, thought you would do better but what should I expect from someone who is business partners with logan paul.
KSI >>>> Tommie Furri
jj has lost my respect  he is just being petty  now even if it was not  fair on the judgement and all the boxing u have done up until now is commendable but the kind of boxing showed off wasn't anywhere close to the all regiment he bragged about c'mon man just look at urself telling ppl to go berate tht  guy every where just caue u cant  take a L. it shows allot about u and ur ego tht is being pumped up in u all along. just learn to take a L not be salty and do all ur petty shit just to bring down ur opponent, he was just ur opponent man not ur mortal enemy
We all think you're a winner even your biggest hater Jake Paul  nothing but a Robbery just because his second name is Fury is the reason he robbed you and the reason Tyson robbed NGANNOU
gotta be a rematch
finally posted
Serious question why do u fight like that 😂 just doin star jumps broski
How you gonna say you did what you said you would when the whole lead up you insisted on knocking Tommy out and you never did?
Can't wait for the next video in 2024😂😂😂
Yo I forgot this even happened
Bruh Ian have nun to watch in forever 😐
Head up champ. Take sometime off to decompress and you made us proud our fat and fitneek
So he lost the fight and decides to attack him on things which have nothing to do with the fight and tells people to go harass him? Why on earth do people like this guy?
finally we can get back to try not to laugh
Bro got humbled 😂🤣
Still butthurt, just accept it and move on
Life doesn't always reward us for our efforts the way we hope. Focus on what matters, learn from this then move on. Dwelling on negative thoughts wastes energy anyway
He beat Tommy by a Draw at least
Not a Jake Paul fan, but look at his reaction to losing to Tommy. He didn't chuck a tantrum and didn't make a big deal out of it. Compare to KSI's reaction. Doesn't matter if he thought he won Jake showed a lot more class and gained a lot more respect.
Fight Jake Paul
the greatest of all time
I saw bits and pieces of your training and I thought your training was a bit overkill for tommy fury
JJ we are just proud you reached higher heights I just hope you learned your lesson. Now just take a rest and get ready for another fight.
Didn’t need to SHII on Fury because u lost take it like a man no matter what reason u think and say U LOST take it as a man no need to keep Shitting on fury  you already won in life bro MOVE FORWARD
U can tell he's a lot happier after the break.
Bro to us you won this match, Tommy is a joke of a boxer and honestly, you've proven to everyone that hard work always pays off. rest for a bit bro and we look forward to more great work from ya.
Round of applause for lilmaxkid kid can finally retire now
I just went over there just to verify that KSI lost and come back here to say comforting words but to someone who isn't exactly a pro at knowing boxing stuff, there was just too much hugging to tell. Eitherway, a loss is a loss and it should definitely only be something that makes you stronger.
Win Or Lose JJ You Made Millions Or People Proud ☝🏽☝🏽
Is it me or is Ksi beard looking good asf
L Bozo
We need a laughing at: JJ olatunji video now
This is probably the best comeback vid after a loss. Lots of love JJ ❤!!
L retire
keep your opinions about his parenting to yourself. that’s a low move man. i expected more.
So no jake fight damn that s fucked up😂
The battle with his beard is still not over
What a sore loser 😂
Im a fan so just dont box cause you cant so just do youtube and other business Habibi
Everybody suddenly loves him again the moment he uploads 💀
JJ you should try to stop being bitter, I know you worked hard but at the end of the day you didn't let anyone down
Hardly find anything of tommy fury beating you l?! Bro that whole fight between you 2 was terrible. It seems like both you and Tommy weren't bringing you're A game and this is what we got.
Came here thinking he’d be humble but nope just cried and made excuses
No way bro made a video of people saying he won, own your loss bro
At the end of the day you needed to be humbled lol you even filed an appeal after calling out others clowns for doing the same thing. You lost bro get over it.
Hey! GTA 6 trailer on the 5th😃!
At the end of the day who truly won is ksi
Dude goes after Tommy Fury's personal lifestyle and his family? Shows what sort of person this bloke really is
Was going well but kind of lost it towards the end there JJ💀 Can’t handle a loss by calling for the opponent to get harassed
We've all moved on from your loss..you know there's bigger more concerning things happening in the world - one which you and your mates haven't breathed a word on. We see you...
You lost the fight, but everyone is proud of the work you put in.
You overachieved❤💪
u kept hugging Tommy thats how you lost 🤣🤣
We proud of you g we all know you won so keep your head up we’ll always be here for you bro🤙🤙🔥🔥🔥
Wtf is the editor doing
Bro you have done enough, you have nothing to prove. Its time to move on from boxing and focus on more important things.
Next video is a reddit video 💯
bro deff made this weeks ago. LMAO
To me, it’s *clear* that with your fight vs. Tommy Fury & Ngannou’s fight vs. Tyson Fury… The boxing commission *fears* the image of “Gamers/YouTubers/Non-Boxers” being able to beat their Household Names.
This guy clearly wants a rematch with Tommy so why not go and write this wrong and beat him again?
WELL WELL WELL LOOK WHO FINALLY REMEMBERED US
You lost fair and square. Now go and beat Jake and finish your boxing career in the best way.
"And if you see him out in public you can berate him as well" another class act from JJ...
Just do better next time❤
Bro you lost. Its ok. Its part of life. We win, we lose, we learn, we move on. Respect for doing what you did. I couldn't have done it... Most of us couldn't bro. But that match was trash.. regardless of the outcome.
Yes you lost ! "You lost." That's it
Dude is a loser
Been WAITING TO hear from you.
JJ, you lost because your strategy was shit.  The karate style darting in and out was not it.  If you fought the way you sparred, in the pocket, taking and giving shots, you would have faired much better.  Change up or just retire from boxing
I mean it was mostly romantic dance between two buff dudes
You so deserved your break. You are human and are entitled to take a step back for yourself. But so good to see you back! ❤
Nah im telling u it bc ur black these man are racist u won 💯
what a joke lmao adesanya doesn’t say he won the match he said looking at it as a fight he won either way he didn’t win either
respectfully fury deserved it
Attacking his personal life cause you lost a boxing fight is disgusting do better
Bro you lost dam fight just accept it and move on lmao
Wow this just makes it so much worse bro it's been a month take the loss like a man
lol JJ dont lose next time that was a shit fight
Ksi is goated 😇
Jj u don't need the judges decision nor does it matter when World knows ur a winner glad u had break bro glad ur back
Jj win or lose we are so lucky and proud of you
I don’t even really care if JJ lost the fight, I would still love him regardless, but at least accept the loss as a man. The way JJ shat on Tommy was lowkey uncalled for considering Tommy hasn’t really said anything personal to JJ
JJ we love you the judges thought Tommy won but you won in millions of hearts around the world ❤😊
As I've gotten older, I've realized that not everything needs to be justified. In this world, sometimes things and other people just suck. You're right in saying that this world isn't always fair.
It was a simple hidden explanation: The boxing culture will definitely be wrecked when they know a YOUTUBER can give an actual pro boxer a chance to lose. And the industry just can't have it
Now the real question is when will KSI vs John Fury for the quoted 200k happen?
Big ups jj
Sell
JJ you lost mate
Im ngl i could care less lmao especially since it was a month ago atp like im just happy he uploaded
Haha loser
good to see you back bro
You lost.
KSI is so salty lmao he lost that farir and square
You lost fam. Accept it. Move on. Do better
Fuck that you win our hearts
We are all proud of you JJ happy to see you back again and we wil always support you
Tomy is gonna want to fight you again after this one :)
Only if he had won, the language and attitude would have been through the roof... Nice acting
I liked my own comment
really unnecessary talking about Tommy’s personal life.
You didn't train hard enough. Star jumps is not boxing. I can do Star jumps for 20 minutes and get tired too. Im unsubbing!
Here come the justification and excuses for the loss. Men who need breaks after life teaches them through a loss, such as Izzy.. saying they need time with family which is lies, when theyre just defeated inside and cant take a Loss and surely cant be strong enough to moge on from it.. theyll cry on social media for a couple of days, take their anxiety pills, become less cocky, are humbled quick.....Those fighters arent real men... Theyre soft on the inside, and the fact they disappear after losing by sayiing they needed time off? and they call emselves fighters? forgetting the fact that you learn from your loss, and overcome it. Not sorrow in it. Alot of UFC Fighters bounce right back after a loss and most even demand a rematch asap after losing a Title Fight.... the fact the "athletes" do this shit after losing a petty match shows how mentally weak they are today
Goes home and whines after losing😂bruh man up
Bad fight bad decision
The fact that the win is controversial it’s a W for you JJ
Bro keep your head up. We're not all perfect. Sometimes someone's legacy is also defined by their mistakes.
Really dissapointed in this video from JJ. Started off well but then quickly became bitter about the fight. I put money on the fight for you to win and when it was over I was jumping up adamant you had won. The result is a shame but it is what it is sadly. You know the power you have over people and yet still ask of your audience to essentially try and ruin a man's life, also to degrade his journey through being a new father is pretty shameful of you. Always respected you and love all your content but the ending to this vid wasn't it.
Bruh u wom that fight the judges cheated u
we are proud of you JJ.
He didn’t mention the appeal that can still change the decision
Sending your fans to go to tommyfurys post to and spam you lost forever is just being a sore loser. You cannot and will not admit it. I’m not arsed about Tommy fury because he’s a lunatic however what you doing is straight up not right. No point talking badly on his name as you are now 0-1 against him and made yourself look like a 5 year old on a tantrum but sure
❤❤❤❤❤
LSI😭
We love u jj
This is a shameful display of a loss, man.
You're right brother hard work but only the right thing and what you want you to be, that's what we have to work hard! Thanks man.
It’s a boxing mate not that deep 😂😂😂
In my book KSI win. Stay good bro happy to see you all good
You trained for so many months no blitz and hug Tommy. Not box and beat him
Enjoy the rest bro. You deserve it. You won it by a landslide! 🐐🥊
I'd diss the complaining except you're right. Just don't go on about it otherwise the people who believe you did rightfully lose will just see you as pathetic. Love the content and stay strong❤
ksi is pathetic .
Loses or not your still him and him don't miss you are a beast  my guy
You gotta fight jake now bro
If it was a hugging match, you definitely would of won
Really low for you to suggest that your fans so out of their way to harass another person online
still crying
Copium
I’m also behind you JJ, the fight was an absolute robbery, stay strong 💪👍
Still calling it a fight 😂😂
FIINALLY a video😂
U got beat on points, the movement that you closed down and clinched caused you to lose on points. Boxing isn't just about winning its about fighting and coming back stronger
JJ, you're an incredible and an extremely hardworking person. Nobody is disappointed or upset with you whatsoever. You showed everyone what hardwork and determination can do when it comes to anything. Please take a break and enjoy some quality time with your family and your mates.
Took u all this long and u fought like your brother deji did
THE GOAT
4 words to sum up the video  TOP NOTCH SORE LOSER 😂
True supporters and fans dont care. We're proud and supporting you regardless. Much love jj :)
We dont care if u lost bruh💀 at least u tried and tommy the b*tch robbed u 3 back head shots or more hes a wanna b*tch
Fuck the fight. You are KSI not only for boxing but mainly for YouTube. Love you Bro.
Lsers
LSi just keep clinching
biggest inspiration. istg. W human.
Absolute sore loser.
Bro finally remembered his YouTube password 💀
Ksi you won the fight the pros say it the haters say it because Tommy cheated you deserved the win don’t worry about the scum of Tommy he’s a disgrace to the fury family and will never live to the family’s expectations
you got robbed bro
None of us give a shit that you lost, the fact you can even say you put up a fight against Tommy fury, a professional boxer who’s been in the sport as a child, is a feat in itself. You’ve proven yourself already, win or loss
Robbed
“I was sparring demons.”  Did you hug them too?
it's pretty bad to criticize other people's parenting. be careful to never do it to any member of your family or friend circle. Drama will ensue
Ok! KSI there is no need to send hate to TOMI. Just because the judges did a bad call. Calm that ego.
I am sorry but this whole video felt like a sore loser video
He talks about embarrassing but he has like 20 appeals because he can’t take a loss😂 ksi your 30 grow tf up
KSI you are the man, no matter what happens, you have literally inspired millions of people to pursue their dreams, believe in themselves and that literally everything is possible! Literally, I sometimes think of you (and also jake paul lol), when I need to do the hard work for my goals! 💪🏿
😂😂😂
I didnt start watching your beautiful r*pe face videos and the crazy fifa videos and even the first apartment tour thing over a decade ago now to give a fck about a boxing match hah. We enjoy you KSI.. you. Cuz you are funny. Thats it. Thats always been it. Hell im still supriced nobody on youtube have tried to cancel you over lets be honest a bit of dark humor in the early stages haha but that is what humor was back then, especially online. Now its different and you have adapted very well. Im glad you have succeeded and that you havent gone down some messed up road like so many of the UK youtubers who started in early 2010s ended up doing. Its great to see
Salty
Honestly forgot about that fight. JJ, we are proud of you, and we don’t care that you lost. Don’t be too harsh on yourself.❤
You are a very bad loser,  even after the appeal they decided You lost, grow up you big baby !
Me who was waiting the whole time for the ksi vs jake paul
u lost lmaooooo
love you JJ
is ksi begging his fanbase to harrass tommy now? fall from grace
Love this Guy man ❤️
can you just take the loss on the chin intead of being a fucking baby about it!
LMAOOOOOO
Ksi fans soft ash now woweww😂😂😂
the fight was in october u jokeman move on
Loser 😂😂😂😂
Aye bro ik losing sucks but u made it tho ur still winning who cares ud whoop so many peoples asses who cares just continue enjoying making videos and enjoy life man! True KSI fans will stick around! Stay strong bro 💪🔥
Win or lose I don't think true fans would care. Maybe some of us are even glad because this made you appear in more videos
Just take the L mate. You’re doing what Jake did
bro took a whole month to reply
Nice Gyatt
Welcome back man missed ya
Wholesome video until he started to be a sore loser again. Its nothing criminal to think you won the fight but to start judging what Tommy does in his personal life like he knows how much time he spends with his family and what their relationship and agreements are and then ask his audience to abuse Tommy under every post and even in person is such a low. Im disappointed.
glad ure back fatneek
Bro shutup you lost😂😂😂
After all this i hope we get Youtube and Music JJ  back
Blud,no one cares about that anymore.Lets move on
Ksi you are great at so many things! Take this L with your head held high! It’s not the end of the road for you.   I think you should take dancing lessons to get some rhythm with those feet. Your so stiff and have no natural fluidity. I think it’ll help with your posture and positioning.
NGL....very happy to see that JJ uploaded... otherwise watching today's sidemen Sunday, I thought I would have a boring day
Be the bigger man. The whole berating Tommy thing is just weak.
Tommy Fury is a fraudster and even a nat could beat his ass. His brother bribed the judges, No but as if the establishment could allow a youtuber to beat a so called pro boxer. Never in a month of Sundays unless you punched his lights out. Maybe a rematch?????
Yes KSI...you lost
Does this mean he’s done with boxing???
KSI didn’t fight well at all, the loss was deserved
KSI is HIM
W
Mr Cuddles😂
yea dude you took a BREAK
Regardless of the outcome, I think it was just a bad fight. Too much clinching, if you both let the hands go a bit more you would’ve stood a much better chance in landing one of those bombs. I lost £20 on that fight 😂🤣
Advocating to cyber bully Tommy Fury (even though he had no influence on the decision) while simultaneously stressing the importance of mental health in the same video.   Clown behavior. You're better than this.
bro lost the fight and brought out the “i’m a youtuber” excuse😂😂😭
we know tommy won, dont try to spin it around. you didnt do enough
3:58 Bro said KONICHIWA  and the people was like "tf"
you lost, accept it and move on.
bro finnaly recovred
This fight still ain’t given him the reality check he needed
Time to go bald
U won bro no matter what they say u did win🙌🏻❤🙌🏻
I lost £6500 on that awful shit show of a judging!! Ksi won that fight clear as day and shit those boxing purists on the judging panel simply didn't let him win cos they hated his style of boxing that's the reason why.... The commission cudnt let a boxer with his style win over a traditional boxer and I'm £6500 down
Bro is an absolute clown just accept the loss and be humble for once. No one is unbeatable and the performance mid fight was tragic
Be like manny pacquiao
Love you man
Bros pretending like he didn’t get 95% of his punches in the clinch, and also acting like he didn’t batter the back of Tommy’s head but got no point deduction, the delusion and cope goes on ig
Ngl bro you and Jake gotta happen tbh!!!
Can we have a minute to talk about your forehead?
Proper legend JJ forget the result like you said the world knows, keep doing your thing.❤
I love JJ , you were robbed of that fight frfr.But goddamn tf did tommy do ,for you to slander him on his personal life .....
❤️❤️❤️
ofc eddie will say tyson furys little brother didnt win
You showed no progress. You fought like shit. Just admit it and own it and move on. Tommy was shit too but he was a bit better
Sorry but this is insane cope. You lost. Also your point about "hits to the back of the head" is quite hypocritical. Youve done it to logan paul, pineda, joe fournier etc. almost all your opponents were hit to the back of the head. You also did it to tommy during the fight, difference was tommy didnt cry about it.
End of an era. Welcome to deji 2.0 Channel from now on
Tommy won that fight😭
yeah but KSI won though.
I didnt think you lost but thats what happened, take your L, no need to keep being salty about the other guy
Is JJ going back in to training? I haven't heard anything
You lost.
I love u jj but accept the loss and move on. This is not a good look
the meat riding in the comments is crazy and watch ksi meat riders come at me for speaking facts
My goat
Pls never step in the ring again😭niqqa all u was doing hugging ffs. Bro the clinchmaster9000
🐐
Trust me. After this jj and tommy fury will be a best friend. Take my word.
2023 has been full of W's for you  Heads up champ  You Literally did everything this year.....
KSI and Ngannou were robbed
The way you handled that loss is unbelievably cringe. You regressed about 10 years. Just accept you can’t always win.
Kai please call tommy fury and tell him he’s trash and ass
JJ, I respect you mate & I'm not trying to sound harsh here, but I do think you need to move on & accept the loss. Also, I'm pretty sure parents are allowed to go out with the lads or the girls, like if Molly Mae is happy with Tommy Fury having a lads night out from time to time & vice versa with Tommy happy to allow Molly Mae having a girls night out from time to time, then there's no harm in that.
Bruv where were you.
As i KSI fan i wanted to see him lose because he was too far in his ego and was being very cringe by saying things like"he is the one that can see john Cena" he needed to be humbled abit
Dude you lost the fight. I watched the fight closely. You were just bunny hopping all over the ring. The match was just pitiful and it’s shocking people think you won. Also you find any way to clown people. The guy won and you still clowning him and clowning him on being a father. You don’t have kids so what you are saying is just pathetic. Grow up ksi. Not everything requires you to always clowning people.
Big up ksi 🙌🙌
🤡🤡🤡
The hardworking didn't showed in the match 🙂🙂
we love you bro ❤‍🩹
You lost the fight, Good god, so salty. Real ones can accept a L.
😭bro took this long to make vid on it. Dawg shit was horrendous, crying after is crazy ngl. All u did was hug, shit was a hugging contest 🤦🏻‍♂️Big fan of u Ksi, but fighting/Boxing aint for u(it was a horrible watch)
what a salty video man.   attacking Tommy on a personal level like him being a father? keep in mind Tommy is only 24 years old. i understand criticizing him as a boxer but as a father is too far. last time i remembered Tommy didn't attack you on a personal level. also your 30 and acting like this. ksi gonna keep crying on his loss when Tommy has moved on with his life. disappointing tbh.   also telling ur fans to harrass someone in REAL LIFE is actually pathetic.  of course Tommy fury couldnt knock you out because you kept hugging him every 10 seconds. 😂
stop yapping, fight jake paul now
Just learn to take an L for one time in your life.
Now go bald for the boys, you earned it
JJ is so salty lmao. Telling his fans to berate Tommy....it was KSI's show and the judges picked Tommy. That is not Tommys fault it JJs for not picking good enough  judges.
Before I started actively watching you KSI, I use to hate on you ngl. But getting hooked to the sidemens content brought me closer to your content AND THEN when I saw how fucking hard you were training and the narrative of your mindset. Im nothing less of huge fan. Ive been doing martial arts for 18 years now and it was such a pleasure to watch you use that one two the way you did.
Looooool and now you’ve fully lost😭😭😭
Just so you know most of us never saw you as a "Boxer" it was just something that a person we enjoy watching started to do. I for one dont care that you lost, i sure would prefer you won tho :) Anyways keep your head up brother
Good way to take the loss like a man...
Point of this video: KSI is a sore loser
I l Iove you Jj 😭😭😭                      NO HOMO 😂😂😂
JESUS IS KING 🤴
yeah, but ksi is the goat tho.
You won JJ, the world saw that. Judges score cards don't matter. The Furys are creating a reputation for loosing the match but "winning" on paper. The viewers know the truth.
I can't imagine how sad someone's life must be to hop on Ksis comments section with post notifications to hate 😂
These comments be bouncing up and down on this nga🙏🏿💀💀💀
you lose dude, dont cry
Thy king is back❤❤❤❤❤
Just accept the loss you bum
Ksi can’t box, I’d beat him
I actually feel sorry for the judges bc they had to go back and watch that horror again. I am j j fan btw
Lol neither won tbh
All i see is a 30year old man who cannot accept the loss, urges his kids fans to harrass tommy's social media, and thinks clinching tommy every second means tommy is a terrible boxer that couldnt KO him.
We’re all proud of you no matter what happens. Keep in the grind, you’re bound to reach the top some day!
AND WE WANTED YOU TO STOP GOING SO CONSISTANTLY HARD FOR YOUR JOB BECAUSE YOU CLEARLY HAVE MULTIPLE AVENUES FOR BEING SUCCESSFUL
this dude keeps being beyond delusional. congrats dude it’s hard to be this detached from reality! keep going
Where you been cmon couldn’t of been that bad
the man who lost me 10k nah im jp i still think u won
been there with you since the beginning.. growing up watching you.. loved and trained boxing because of you brother.. you won… you the people champ
Ksi we need you to keep fighting
Damn.....these comments are fully hate
People are getting scammed on dazn because of the fight!
After 7:30 there is everything why his reddit is toxic.  You should take the L and not encourage hate and toxicity within your community.
What a sore looser
Take the L
Damn u sound salty 😂💯 must be a uk thing cuz yo fans a support regardless but u sound like a sore loser take a L like Logan 🤷🏽‍♂️
Jj, I was watching your old videos all the time since you stopped posting. It feels great to have you back ! 🎉
I'd be more proud of you if you would accept the loss
I'm sorry, but it's getting harder and harder to respect you on this matter. You lost the fight and your appeal got rejected, get over it. You did great, you've had one hell of a journey, and it's a bit embarrasing for Tommy to just barely win. However I do believe Tommy won. A lot of the clips showed in the beginning of the video, showcasing people believing "ksi won" didn't actually believe it. If people actually watch those clips fully through not all of them actually believed it to be a win for KSI. Also some of the people who believed you won was friends of yours, obviously they're gonna be biased like a bunch of your audience. You also keep ignoring the fact that there's also MILLIONS of people and pros who didn't think you win.
hardly and highlights of you too
trying to encourage your fans to go and harrass tommy about "losing" to you on his instagram and even in the street is very sad and pathetic, you're 30.. grow up
Welcome back JJ we love you and stand with you 100%. We know who the real winner is we know who's the king. Hold your crown high big man 👑
Ksi we love you but I think you got a little too personal there
you have achived a lot but the best thing is . . . you are IN SHAPE!
It’s alright Ksi your a good fighter and not every great fighter wins their first match and you are only going to get better I believe you can come back and win. Losing is nothing it shows how great you are
Ksi we love you but I think you got a little too personal there
Mist of us r just glad ur back
glad this guy got humbled, got pushed back and clinched the whole fight and cried like a baby - just can’t take the loss what a freak
Who cares about the result. Genuinley, even if you had won it's whatever. The real victory is that you have most likely inspired thousands of people to think better for themselves, gave them hope that hard work beats talent when it comes to making something of yourself. You should be proud.
The amount of meatriders in the comments is crazy 😂 Ksi was jumping and landing hugs and thinks he won. Lmfaoooo
To be honest. This was a bit low? Idk. I just felt like at a certain point you kept pilling on and it just seemed bitter. Which is understandable but a lot of people think you won so idk why this video of 9 minutes of slagging Tommy post-fight was necessary
Win or loss JJ I am glad your more relaxed now and making great content with the sidemen
You’re a goat JJ
You didn't win . Stop it.
I dont condone what KSI said in this video . Up until a year ago , his actions have been becoming weird. Asking fans to berate him / spam comments ( implying h*rr*sment without saying it ). Calling judges 3 random guys , and everything surrounding him is starting to turn a bit off. Been watching and supporting him for years but , idk about how he took the loss
If you think JJ was robbed  like my comment
hard cope
This man clowned Jake for losing and clowned Logan for appealing and look at him now crying. Even encouraging his fans harass Tommy because he’s still salty about losing after all that big talk.  One of the most insecure and childish 30+ year olds I’ve ever seen. Embarrassing lmao.
so proud of you ksi, keep your head up
Proud of you for going as far as you have ❤
big fan of jj but accept ur loss and move on bro
Ight nice                          but whens the jake fight happening?
“I fElT liKe I Won” yea ok buddy, hugging 100 fucking times doesn’t win shit, “haymaker, bounce around or some shit, HUG” combo everytime lmao
Tommy fury need to make “KSI Appeal got Rejected” Video would be the ultimate troll 😂😂
Keep your head up man we learn from our mistakes and even tommy will lose one day
JJ no matter what people think, statistically you lost. Once on the night and twice once the appeal came through. Please don’t be a sore loser
do you need a hug Ksi your good at giving one so it’s my duty to return one to cheer a man up
Life isn’t fair - says the billionaire
Thank you jj for always entertaining us. You deserve the rest you need. All i personally want is to see you happy and entertain us with what you like. You're an inspiration man.
JJ should not have won
Stop crying about it… move on u baby
Bro needs to do a rematch or don’t box again
This is a bit weird no?😂
Although You Ran Your Mouth Alot We're Still proud of You
We missed you always good to take a break! Your a goat!
Hmm am I sensing a possible 2nd fight with him coming from all this 🤔 let’s get it Ksi ❤
Jj u showed in the beginning everyone knew you wom from the mma guys from Eddie Hearn him self your biggest hater Jake Paul everyone knew you won and will always know the truth you inspired everyone keep up the great work 👍
We love you but you’re ass in boxing brother 🤣
Well, duh
womp womp
Are you even going to box again
There were a lot of people who didn’t think Ksi won either though. Gotta make sure you steer clear of confirmation bias.
This isn’t funny
you won
So you’re being a sore loser, what a way to lose credibility
You did amazing ❤
He should have one the judges are absolutely so wrong
we still love you jj
Damn, even after losing he still manage to find a way to shit on people. Atleast it humbled him a tiny bit 😂
30 yr old btw. This guy needs to grow up he’s actually stuck in 2017
Hey give yourself some credit at least you didn’t throw a tantrum
Nah what if tommy paid the ppl 😮
W JJ!! Good to see you back and in a good place mentally. You have such an inspiring journey and we're with you all the way! God bless!
Mate nobody cares that you lost it’s the principle of not losing with grace and decorum. You tried to appeal a 1 point differential which was never getting overturned and it’s the soul fact that it took you this long to finally accept the L is embarrassing JJ you’re an amazing fighter and an awesome entertainer but you have to learn to lose with grace and dignity when it originally happens that call could’ve gone either way we learn from it and we’ll bounce back
big man returns

you did well, continue to stay motivated bro
I am waiting for Reddit video 😊
Even though we'll never be able to know you personally, portraying your most authentic self to us is very admirable.
It was rigged! They can't let a YouTube boxers win against a "real fighters"! You won
Everybody know you lost lmao
I said it once and I will say it again... it was a very close fight that could have went a lot of ways.   Round 1 was without a doubt for KSI.  Rounds 3 and 4 without a doubt for Fury.  But is says everything that there is three judges scoring the fight and one gives round 2 to KSI, the other gives KSI round 5 and the last one gives KSI round 6...
The Tommy fight was the last my dad saw and he thought u won
rq hater perspective, that fight was literally 2 months ago- I don't care what you gotta say now bruh, you had to take a whole 2 months to make this but appeared like it was nothing on sidemen reacts!?      You ksi fans can hate on this comment but just know I aint replying and I don't give a damn what any dick suckers have to say
dude hugged Tommy the whole fight and thought he won?
W
Bro lost and got really salty and started to “roast” Tommy’s personal life LMAOOOO. KSI is such a sore loser and I can’t believe people still support this clown.
“You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain”. I think this saying reigns true for how KSI’s fan base turned on him leading up the to the Tommy fury fight. So many of his “fans” wanted to see him lose. They hated your ego, hated your self belief, and all for what?? Because it made them uncomfortable to see their hero truly believe he could beat a professional boxer??? It was shameful if anything. There’s nothing wrong with believing in yourself. If the judges would’ve announced your name on fight night as the winner, the internet and all those fans would’ve had to eat their words and acknowledge that you truly are great. But because the decision was in the favor of tommy, your “fans” turned on you. You were their Hero until they felt you took it too far and they didn’t believe you could pull it off. I believe you did. I believe you did enough to win that fight. You nullified his game plan, and made him unable to land or take out a YouTuber.  We are all Proud of you JJ. You showed the world that anything is possible. You’ve been doing it for years. So much so that people wanted to see you fall. Nowadays people would rather see the hero fall, than to see him achieve his dreams. They promote the villains. We have people rapping about killing people and murdering other youths in the streets and kids rapping the lyrics words for words. But when a YouTuber wants to dream to achieve his goals, then it’s too much and cringy. That’s the world we live in.  Your Real fans know what you did that night. You solidified yourself in YouTube history as one of the greats.  KSI is Legacy 🔥💯
Imagine telling your fans to harass someone. Honestly thought after a month off and chilling he might gain some humbleness.
That's cool and all, but when's the Dragon Ball Legends content?
Olajide Olayinka Williams Olatunji. my n-word. bruh i legit be looking forward to a rematch. love KSI. win/lose, we still support yah fam.
Literally could’ve told you that weeks ago. You’re just too deluded to accept it.
Fight Jake Paul 🙏
Did Tommy do enough to win? No. Did KSI? Also no.
Salty 😂
We love you JJ no matter what happens we just want to see you happy!
We still love you jj
Gonna be honest here at best you should have one at worst it was a draw Tommy had a terrible performance for a “pro” boxer but even then jj you had a very poor performance too you just didn’t box well there was no guard no real technique it felt like you regressed with this fight it was just a hugging match. The match was bad the only true losers were those who flew out just to watch that fumble of a main event.
No offence KSI but even if you won you still need to fix your style it’s all sloppy making it hard for people to judge
The bashing of Tommy was unnecessary. We all saw what you are capable of and how the fight looked. We are all proud of you JJ, so stop with the BS and move on!
anyone here that doesn’t actually care about any of this boxing shit and just watches JJ for jj? 😂😂
You are one of the most inspirational people on this platform. I've heard you all this years saying this example of your and I'm trying my best to be a better person and do the things that I love no matter what. Keep being great ❤
Glad to see that you’re okay JJ keep making the great videos with the sidemen and your own channel
Power to you! You are a LEGEND. And yes I also felt you won even if it doesn't mean anything to anyone.
Both JJ and Tommy did horribly in that fight lowkey, but we’re still proud of JJ for going through all that for himself and us
KSI/ JJ/ Olajide, however you are called, I have always supported back when you played video games and challenges with your brother Deji. Looking back from then, I knew how much hard work was meant for you. You definitely deserve a break at least from your music tours, collaborations, sidemen, Prime, misfits boxing, and i will say it’s definitely worth a huge break after 6 years. I would know because I’m doing the same hard work and haven’t gone to a vacation the same amount you’ve been going thru. Understand that most of us really support hard work beats talent and you did just that. In terms of the fight, I agree that Tommy should not have won. You were mostly right that the 3 judges did not do well on the scorecards and all 3 scored to him even with the point deduction. He should not have won, and the same time you should not have lost. Ultimately, most of us agreed that you got robbed but the best case for millions of people in this world watching your fight against Tommy is a majority draw. It would not be a complete loss but it would be a very understandable choice by the judges just so that you could have that rematch and finally get your chance to win once your break is finished. From what it’s worth, it also has to come down to the decision to fight against Jake Paul. And ik that one day it’s gonna happen but you keep delaying it due to your world tours and sidemen content and prime promotions, we are still waiting on it because I want this fight over with when you called him out first before mentioning to fighting his brother Logan. I want this fight to be done with so that I can finally say you are obligated to fight any person anytime and anywhere, one person at a time. If those misfits fights were stepping stones to beat Jake Paul, well. This would have been your chance. But I want you to do the best you can to prove yourself that you can beat all of the fighters Jake Paul has fought thru his boxing career all because you called him out first
A close fight doesn't mean you losing was 'not fair', stop focussing on all the things you did right and he did wrong and look at the fight as a whole, you both did fuckall in the fight, you both hit eachother in the back of the head and you both clinched nonstop. It was a close fight and you not winning was not 'not fair' because some people thought you won. There's also a lot of people who thought you lost... also calling fans to comment on every post of tommy to remind him that he didn't win is so childish.
Shit happens if your ego gets to big. Surrounding your Self with scumbags Like the Logan surely didnt help either. I really dont Like how you developed from a nice and humble Boy to a egotistic moneygrabbing Saum. Its just sad. You went from Idol to someone I really dont want to be. Pls Reflect on the past and change. Its Never too late
yo he is back
I’m sorry but you did NOT win even with point deduction, like you just weren’t even fighting except giving and getting all the hugs you didn’t receive when you were younger lol and I’m not a Tommy fan i had no idea who he was until this fight lol
If we manage to keep saying Tommy didn't win and piss him off enough that he demands a rematch with JJ, that would be a great storyline.
7:51 ah yes let’s raid him because I’m a sore loser and still can’t accept the fact that hugging and jumping every 5 seconds doesn’t win me fights
bro was quiet for a minute
Bro a sore loser damn
big respect. Very humble to this day.
We love you JJ...WIN OR LOSE YOU'RE MY GOAT❤
Bro you need to delete the reddit, I'm sick of the haters on there! Makes no sense how people who don't like JJ are so quick to state there opinion where no wants see it
Damn ksi and logan have alot in common
finally JJ !! Missed you man
He has turned into what he hated.
“It wasn’t fair”, maybe next time don’t land 6 punches a round.. smfh
You win some, you lose some. Keep your head up high
its only right you vs jake now
You fought good brother
Muppet
I won’t lie mate. Before you lost but you won because you made it a lot closer than anyone expected.    Then all this happened on Twitter and it’s just made the loss worse ngl
Actually the 🐐 you inspire us all king 👑
He literally titled he's last vid "time to shock the world". I'm sorry jj but u cursed yourself bro
Hug like a bear  Jump like a kangaroo   - KSI
you lost shush move on LSI aka tommy's bitch
JJ you did your thing. the fact mans been boxing his whole life you had him struggling. We got your back always fr
Well well well look who it is finally a flippen video...ffs
https://www.youtube.com/@WasantsirinamSirinam-wv8te
Don’t care mate, you still lost. Keep coping loser
You didn't really lose but you didn't win either. The whole match wasn't even boxing. It should of been a draw at best for KSI. You didn't pull a Francis Ngannou and that's ok.  Even if the judges did say you win I wouldn't think of you as a better boxer than Tommy because you just showed yourself as a 1 trick pony on the ring than learning the art of boxing
another video of crying . Jesus
Andrew Tate called it, on the Fellas Podcast! You can’t write this, the boxing judges are bias and don’t want to admit defeat!
It was harsh but a loss is a loss and ashame he probably won't let you try rectify that result! But to tell your fans to keep berating him is so fucking low bro you know better than this!! Hard enough to be a man in this world and you bloody know that, Man has a young family and doesn't need your fans trying to tip him over the edge and that could actually happen then next minute we have another male suicide and a child without a father! Chill the fuck out man so incredibly low regardless of that shitty result do better man!
Tgr goat respect my g
i will always love you jj
KSI ❤️💯
You won JJ definatli
In the immortal words of Ryomen Sukuna, “Stand proud. You’re strong.”
you did not win the fight and never did to begin with
U lost I never thought u was a boxer not a surprise come down n give me a hug
no need to live this fuking life bro, just die and u will like actually end it all. Literally thats the concept! Other than the trends or whatever materialist life, u dont really have to do anything in life, like dying is best.. You dont need to live a toxic stupid life and all around most toxic mentally manipulative physically harassing people as well. In this its better to die and say dont harm!
The People's Champ 👑
Was waiting for this video for soo long win or lose it doesn't matter our fatneek should be happy that's all that matters
We all know you're the real winner JJ
We don't care about your loss all we want to see is you streaming
Tommy probably wouldn’t want a rematch😂😂😂. KSI we proud of you
KSI didn’t lose that fight but he definitely didn’t win. That in itself is a W for KSI
This vid took u so long that i even forgot about the loss
dawg we know full well you’d make fun of anyone else if they were in your situation. sending out your minions to go attack tommy because you’re salty is wild. i hope they turn on you so you can learn how to take an L.
bro still delusional.
KSI i know dang well you won that fight don,t listen to the haters
😂😂😂
yaaaaay he's back (:
Starjumping and hugging isn't fighting 😂😂
Not sure this video was needed JJ - fair enough to say you thought you won but we didn’t need to go that deep with Fury
Missed you man
I had faith you would come back stronger. It's nice to hear you're doing better. Missed you man. Your legacy is still going strong!
Tommy hit u back off the head 5 times
Jj I love you, but tbh you are not MVP he has that stance because he has kicks and has better head movement. In general having your hands always low isn’t the best for your style because you are a brawler you aren’t a distance fighter like MVP who is mainly a kicker. All in all I am honest and I’m disappointed in your performance JJ. You looked like a constipated kangaroo in there no kidding
Imma be honest this vid was kinda immature and was full of copium, and passive aggressiveness
Ofc u lost 😂😂😂
La Lamborghini
W in comments for jj cuz he did win regardless of what the judges say
The return❤
Don't worry KSI, you not as bad as cory😭😭😭😭
thought this was a reddit video, and that he was just doing one of those long intro rants
8:33 goosebumps man
nice to finally see some real editing in one of these videos instead of those half ass edits Mo usually shits out for us
Early 💜
IT is What it IS..........
Please don't encourage your audience, who are a large majority children, to harass Tommy Fury. the dude lost the fight, but that's no excuse to harass him on the Internet. Let's be bigger people here.
That fight was trash
love you jj, the whole world can see that you won, it’s 3 judges against millions.
Yea you did and you put on an embarrassing ass performance. All the hype just for you to throw a sloppy overhand right the whole fight. You deserve the lost bro.
It's good you lost. You needed to come back down to earth. Yeah people say you won yeah more people say you lost. Still your number one fan tho. Dont keep it up. Just relax. And enjoy life. 🎉
why you tryna clown the man, you lost, just move on
Why did you wear headphones for this video lol
thats some sore loser stuff bro , this aint it
That’s crazy though
Heads up nightmare we love you forever❤️❤️
Can I touch you?
CRINGE, take your loss. Jake took his loss like a champ and you’re still crying
You lost the fight ksi
Will you fight again after this?
Bro you could take fkn 12L's, we dont care bro. We flocked to this channel years ago before boxing and there is a reason for that.
People say anything glazin nowadays
SO HAPPY BRO LOST 😂😂
Bro nobody gives a fuck, the day goes on its dramatic if you wait a month after the fight to talk about it. We love you even if you decided to do Only Fans. Just keep staying to true to yourself for your friends, family,  and fans
JJ u won that fight dont give up on yourself we're all here wi 1:14 th u brother
Yes you got destroyed.  In the ring and appeals court.  You're so bad its not even funny, the fact you thought you won and then challenge the result is truly disgusting.
Your pathetic ksi
Why are you so salty dude? The world knows that you lost
Little late don’t you think ? You lost fairly you bum
Could have gone either way it was close, jj if you won, would you have been happy with that? Run it back
All you did was hug and run away and try to win via point deduction
We don’t care who won jj. We love u
It really should have been a draw, and as a fan of KSI (critical of his boxing potential, being a boxer myself lol).  He has nothing to be ashame of and should be proud and even more hungry for more.
No stres fam
Imagine having this much fame and money and you still have to stroke your ego and put other people down to make yourself feel better. Just hold your loss broski nobody cares 😂 🤦🏾‍♂️
Nah still mad WE WANT THE DAMN WIN
Lets go JJ! Respect for getting in the ring and giving it a go ❤
KSI needs to refund the ppl who bought the PPV. Both main events were garbage and everyone can agree on that
This was the biggest cope of all time
its ok JJ. Youre still our favorite fat neek
Yes you did lmao.
No matter the result you ain’t lose in our hearts G. We’re proud of the fight you put up you left it all in the ring like a champ.
Tommy destroyed this dudes ego 😂
Bro come on don’t tell your fans to harass Tommy at best that fight was a draw, for a guy that always goes in for the knockout such as yourself,  you went for a hug festival so pls don’t tell your fans you got robbed.
Tbh. The whole youtube boxing scene is a disgrace to the sport. Stick to making video's.
A month is crazy
L Bozo lost L
Bro, yoir youtube fans might be different to your boxing fans. The youtube fans will be here nonetheless.
man just take the rest of the year off, enjoy your christmas,
boxing is not for cryers, is for people that love to fight and enjoy it whether they win or not... respect for jj though for getting here
Its fine jj win or lose we still make fun of you on reddit
Redit bouta be crazy
you did great buddy
😂naaaaaa, you simply RAN away after "shocking the world "😂 like you did for about 4 years from the other delusional crackhead ,and when you finally grow some balls to show face you use it to send your horde of stans  harass the winner? You are SOMETHING ELSE KSI 😂😂
Ehhhh it made sense lol you lost that fight 100%, still respect you and how far youve come but you DEFINITELY lost that fight lol
Move on bruh
Lol bro had to go into hiding after losing. Man had to put on a show saying stuff he didn’t truly believe in lead up to the fight. Then your appeal got rejected. Now you know how Logan feels. Y’all both suck
You lost
You lost. Just get over it bro.
All these Americans coming over with the word GLAZING…. It’s like they can’t believe people can actually be nice to each other take a step back and look what that says about you or just your country in general…
KSI, the manchild LOST embarrassingly. Tommy Fury made this man have a mental breakdown at home and on live television 😂😂
U lost lil bro
Tommy trained 10 times harder for you than he did for Jake and still didn't beat you 10 times easier than he did Jake so it means you are 10 times better fighter than Jake or even more because his performens against you was even more bad even he worked harder on that. You are hardest fighter in his record so far and maybe thats it. Maybe one day he is back to you begging rematch
Legend 💯
Hold that L
Im glad your back g
In realty you don't have to give a fukiing reason but whatever....
Bruh you lost accept it and move on and stop talking about that random guy
Tommy is not a man of his word
Love youuuuu jj
in the video they cut out the full comment from demetrious johnson, what other videos from other people did he cut out  .  Demetrious johnson said ksi landed more but tommy landed more significant strikes
Lsi
you trained so hard to hug?
This is more of an L for Tommy Fury then it is for KSI
Your a coward ksi
He's back 😊😊😊
U are my favourite idc if u lose or win I will be a Ksi fanboy forever ❤
JJ talking about Tommy fatherhood is really low. That’s very womanly
So salty
This is a 9:13 compilation of pure saltiness
Sore loser
Jake Paul still hanging on to his knockdown like bro you still got whooped and it wasn’t close
Win or lose don’t matter we’re all proud of you!! But you did win tho 😂😂😂
bro i really love you and sorry but you just hugged him
Don’t worry, you’ve had way more wins than losses, no one supports you because you’re perfect though, you’re a legend and you know it, we know it.
You didnt do nothing but hug was pqthetic
somebody is salty
The mystery still remains unsolved between Jake and ksi. JJ for the win Ofc ❤   Keep grinding jj love
This is a shameful display of a loss, man.
Mother fucker, it’s been nearly 2 months since the fight. I think it’s obvious to everyone you lost
man what can i sayyyyyy..... I love This Guyy no matter what..........thats it
The Legacy still goes on
Bro wtf you went ghost mode for 1 month
You didn’t win a damn thing, both you and Tommy looked terrible and you left it up to the judges. Instead of crying saying it’s “unfair” how about you go back and look at the tape and improve to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Stop letting your yes-men influence you
he won the fight its just easy to tell who won the fight
<3
Whatever they say were all proud of you and We know you won the fight❤️
The fury family are honestly just chumps especially the crazy ass dad probably paid them off for tommys win😒
This is not hate I love KSI but maybe he needed to loose once so he could rest and stop grinding just for a moment...
Rematch ?
You didnt win so just stop
❤
Love KSI, but, You didn’t win. Period. It’s not about if you think you did or not……it’s about what the scorecard says. Your form is still bad. The bouncing up and down is dumb, the overreaching is bad, the wild punches is still bad. You really need to clean up your style if you want to continue the boxing. Bc you aren’t winning against Jake, Tommy a second time, etc staying the same  The sheer fact that you continue to say “it’s unfair”, that it took you weeks to feel better. That says you should just retire and move on to other things. That’s not the mindset of fighters. And “sparring” is not a real fight. Who TF cares who you sparred.
Just take the L bro
Should get jordan Gill on a card after his fight lastnight he's proved alot and showed that he's the real deal and here to stay!
You didnt win and give up on it
He is acting like a baby coming after the man's family. Humble yourself!
Yes, you very much did.
What a sore loser 😭  The shots that you “landed” where in clinch. You hug too much those jack rabbit shots are nowhere near solid enough to be considered as a point
You won JJ ..  Don't think low of yourself... You are a star for us. .. All of us here look up to you .. keep posting the vids.  We love you ❣️
L bro
Cl remeber when Tommy said he should be fighting worldclass he would survive
Tbh anything other than a knockout was a loss for Tommy. Bro needs to go and help look after his kid. Bros getting milk with Chris Brown😂
so is he done with boxing or what
It's not the first time judges have 'misjudged' a match. King Kenny winning against Faze Sensei seemed bullshit to me.
L video KSI
it was for your own good 😂
Lost is a Lost, If you really think you won that you should've knock him out like you said Lmao. Funny seeing you upload a video in so long. Respect but Funny asf
Ksi the biggest loser
Glad you’re feeling better and enjoying yourself Jj happy for you ❤
@Ksi you didn't disappoint any of us. I watched the fight and you honestly should have Won via decision or tied. I watched  another boxing analysis YouTuber where he broke down punch for punch for scoring. And yes you should have Won. Not to mention that he said he was a true boxer and was gonna knock you out. He did a terrible showing constantly trying to clutch up. He's gonna call for a rematch if he already didn't it's gonna destroy him the constant digging at his "legacy." The only critic I can make for you to improve one is increase you move list. If this was MK or SF you spammed one move a lot. Just find 2 more combos to surprise the opponent and control your breath. You were gassing out after the 4th round. I've been training all my life in mixed martial arts so I have somewhat of a knowledge of what I'm talking about lol. I don't know all the boxing rules but i know the important parts. Keep training and watch that fight a lot look for the counter opportunities and attack he's a one trick willy and if you counter it at the right time give him the over hand right. You took a loss yes but how you respond now will echo for eternity if you get back up and fight it will prove your integrity. You got this and we all got your back. Much love brother ✌️
lol salty loser
"Losing" a fight you know you won is better than "winning" a fight you know you lost🤲🏾
Tbh, as your fans, I don’t think any of us really care about the result of that fight. You did bits m8 👍🏼💪🏼
Honestly if we don’t get KSI vs Jake in 2024 they’re both bitches
lets be honest jj. that was not a boxing match, it was a hugging contest. Money went down the drain.
It wasn't a win for you or tommy. I think it was a draw, both of you guys boxed well and landed really well.
Just watched the fight again yesterday i had JJ winning 58-56 with the point deduction taken into account even without the point deduction it would be 58-57 to JJ. Keep your head high JJ I believe you are a winner regardless of what everyone else thinks and can’t wait for you beat up Jake Paul. Stay blessed. Much love and respect.  Your biggest fan
KSI got robbed->>>>>>>>>>>>>
We love you JJ ❤! Despite the fact that you lost we appreciate the hard work that you put in to go toe to toe with a pro boxer! Sometimes you can't always be victorious and hopefully this loss will only make you better! Keep doing what you're doing champ!
So no Reddit 🥸it’s been steamin since he lost his fight 😂
tell you what its funny how all the people who kept commenting ksi dick suckers to fans who thought he would win are now commenting "Win or lose, we are still so proud of you JJ"
You lost. Get over it.
Oh shit really????? It’s been so long the whole world knows! Edit1: All love tho I just miss the Reddit reacts
I am a massive fan of you JJ but let's be honest, your technique hasn't improved at all since you started boxing...all you do is jump around and hope to land that 1 hit and that's it. I thought you won the fight, but you've gotta seriously change the way you fight or this is gonna happen again.
You really did lose that fight, bud.
How’s he turned a loss into laughing at Tommy Fury
After so long
Imagine living your best life everyone is jealous of, and still bitch about it. Take this one on the chin and move on.
My heart bleeds for you mate. Must have been awful for you.
Massive fan since way back ! You should’ve thrown some combos maybe
boxing is fukcing rigged i was done with the sport after the fight. Just like the robbed Nganou
You sound like a little girl crying to her mommy bro. Man up and get better.
It's been awhile and I still think you should've won that fight and all of us fans still love and support you man you made us all proud
Tbh JJ accept your defeat no one needs your explanation plzz🫨🫨🫨
:0
We are proud of you👊
You fought well mate but this video is a bit pathetic, no need to encourage your fans to personally attack Tommy. You both did well but have some humility in defeat. Sometimes taking the L is better.
just make sure fury never gets another penny from misfits boxing..hes nothing without misfits.hes nothing....
Ksi won
We love you jj waiting for try not to laugh
Wsi is back
To be honest man is 30 now no matter how long you take to upload we will always be waiting, you sacrificed your younger days making good content for us so it's your time to enjoy your efforts and hard work
HAHAHAH HE CRIED
Yes. You did lose. Get over it.
Ksi is a 30 year old manchild who threw a temper tantrum on live tv 😂😂
Must be feeling real good after letting it all out  Love u brother no matter what ❤
U lost 4 rounds and won 2 rounds u didn't won buddy 😂
KSI the goat <3
blud didnt even fucking fight properly
Roy jones jr would ko and kill Tommy all day
It’s ok JJ you won in my eyes
Coping hard and only first minute of the video 😂
We are not mad because he lost, we are happy because he's back. Our boy is back ladies and gentlemen. We are glad he's ok🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Bro took 2 months to recover 🥷
You a goat jj. The hard work you put in is inspiring. Now go eat and get chubby respectfully.
Ehh KSI this is low from you lol... honestly this is embarrassing for you man stop.
Yes.
ye we never cared that you lost, happy to hear from you
We already know mate 😂
Bro can’t take an L😂
You lost man, stop overreacting.
That is why JJ is the 🐐. The consistency of work he has been doing on YouTube and other ventures is ridiculous
You won JJ
ur inspiring ntgl
You basically were clinching Tommy Fury for most of the fight and you really think you won. You broke down crying 😂.
bro we been saying you lost
I see Ksi making this video just to continue to throw Tommy under the bus over his loss. He just keeps praising himself compared to his family, co workers, competitors, complaining how hard life is….buddy you a millionaire and multi one at that. Stop bitching. Many pple still need growing up to do even when they got money. And this guy needs to be greatful 🙄
Look we dont care about the result but please help the people that are getting scammed by the event publishers
You did win
We all love you jj❤ hope you have a wonderful Christmas
I did think Jj won but if you want real proof just look at how excited Tommy was to beat a “YouTuber”
I agree with everything you said, but it doesn't take away from the fact that the fight was objectively shite. That was barely boxing, it was a hugging competition and you both barely did anything that wasn't from the circus.  Sure it wasn't a win for Tommy, but I genuinely think both of you should have gotten a loss on your record for that fight.
You lost me after you did this kings council business. You called jake paul out for appealing this fight after losing and you do it aswell to an extreme degree. Hypocrite.
Constantly continues to scam the entire fan base of fools with his prime drinks that are bullshit.
U Urr eh man they probably paid eh judges aff yi wur eh clear winner by a mile 😉
Bro you loss, take it on the chin and move on. This whole video is you complaining and saying how all these “big names” said you won. They don’t decide the winner the judges do, and the judges decided you lost. Move on man. Then telling your fans to go and berate tommy is childish.
Stfu jj u lost😊
Awesome job jj .
Scary games with deji🔫
❤🔥
Nan man, Win or lose, you don't tell to your fans to harass someone, that's petty.
you take your time man! get better, we'll wait<3
The amount of 🍆 riders in these comments is sad and pathetic
We love you no matter win or lose
nice to see u back bro u deserve some chill time
I hope next video is not related to boxing
Tbh u just hugged the whole fight yea Tommy was gonna have the bias so u had to do more
THE KING IS BACK!
He don’t know yall. Stop sucking another grown man wtf.
I wanted you to lose and you lost,this was the JJ I wanted to see...
You shocked the world by losing so easily lol  And you make a video after a month to say "no, it was rigged"  Dude, look at how you pose during boxing wtf
You weren’t close to winning. It was fair.
lowkey been checking everyday till u uploaded.
Jj you probably don't know this but it doesn't matter to us if you lost broo we are here to enjoy with you and you're such a inspiring ni*** (it's just  a joke) you have inspired me a lot so thank you and keep posting regularly like before so we can laugh at you again😂😂 and remember you can still do it there is always a second round of life I say go for it and next year show them who ksi is you are great ni**** (again bro just to make people laugh)
It’s time to shock the world…that didn’t age well it’s all a learning experience
I am the kind of fan you would call the silent follower. I dont really post a lot of comments on your YouTube, Reddit or anything. However I have been a fan for quite some years now. And Bro, let me tell you. Massive respect to what you have achieved personally, but mostly what you have meant and still mean for thousands if not millions of fans. Thats your legacy and it always will be. No matter who beats you in a ring, they can never beat you in this. Keep up the good work Champ ❤
bro jj its calm, regardless of the result you still went in there and showed that anything is possible if you work hard enough for it
What I learned through all this. YouTubes CAN box, "Professional" Boxers are overhyped
U lost get over it
Yeah you lost to a Love Island contestant😂😂 you thought doing star jumps and hugging would get you the win.. no you got humbled and outboxed😂😂😂😂 trying to get the appeal was also sad as well accept your defeat🤣 no one thought you won even the judges that you paid.. It was your own event! You lost fair and square😂😂😂
JJ
Shut Up & Hold the L
Hey you got your but kicked be we still rock with you
The curse of "I'm going to shock the world" lives on
Welcome back buddy ❤
Wdym u didn't had proper holiday since 2017 dude u went  to maldives after logan 2 fight 😂
Why bro crying😂
Jj don’t mind the ppl that are saying mean shi they don’t understand clearly they hating for no reason, you did great and won in our eyes take as many breaks you need man🫶🏽🫂❤️
Tommy deserved the win
Yo me and my friend missed you ❤❤❤
Prime it’s bullshit
Hi
IDGAF what anyone says lol, tommy fury a man that's a pro boxer and that's not even that good as a boxer and part of a fighting family that also ain't that good didn't beat JJ a man that's a video gamer/comedian/entertainer. Sorry tommy fury yes men that's just my opinion lol
Took you a fucking while to post this didn’t it 💀
now jj is just being petty
Let it go
ksi i am ur fan, but telling ur fans to hate tommy fury in his comments, irl is just TOXIC, is it to satisfy ur ego?
All that shit talk to Jake and you lost to🫵🤡🤡🤡🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
7:41  ain’t no way
i wanna see an edit of ksi onto the gojo meme "nah i'd win"
Welcome back
Hahahaha nobody even cares bro, just continue do your ting
Where’s the Reddit
still got a big forehead
🔥 I DONT GIVE A SHET 🔥
Sausage
"Life isn't fair" shut up dawg🤣🤣
nah bro lost respect for you on this. men dont make excuses
I lost all respect after your tempter tantrum lol your a grown ass man
ma boy still salty
Just need to learn a proper boxing stance and I promise you will be a force to reckon with. Star ump position makes you vulnerable.
You finally back bro good
heeeeeeeess BACK
It's fine dude, jj lost to fury, for now that's the fact, no need of showing the audience clips of other ppl saying otherwise, but ya fury should've knocked him out, but he didn't ,that shows JJ's hardwork ,it's admirable!! But shitting on fury now is useless jj! Good msg at the end though!!
you didn’t win the fight tho lmao damn own up to it
We love you 4L JJ! Keep inspiring us to do better! Stay up!
I love it when you can shit on the winner about the winner's personal life. Tommy is just  bad influence to his child atp.
Lmao
No worries. We all take an L eventually.
JJ, welcome back ❤
You won, it was a robbery.
bro ur game plan was to flail your arms around of course u lost
Of course people be meat riding in the comments 🤣 reddit gonna keep it real tho
W
WELCOME BACK BRO
Bit late mate
Ksi doesn't realize even if he would have got the win it was not because of anything he did it was because the stupid judge took away a point unfairly from Tommy for suppoesdly hitting ksi in the back of the head when ksi was also hitting Tommy in the back of the head while in the clinch and was not getting any warning or points taken.      Ksi, even if you did end up winning you would have won by crying to the ref and forcing him to take a point off Tommy for supposedly doing the same thing that you were deliberately doing in the same round 😂there are so many clips of ksi clinching Tommy and then aggressively hitting him in the back of the head.       Ksi also did the same to Pineda and Fournier and the same to Logan yet when it's done back to him he complains, gets an unfair point taken from his opponent and then when he loses, cries about it and claims that he should have won because of a point deduction. Complete delusion
Get back In studio Man you was literally dropping bangers then jsut stopped
It's about damn time
You lost bro, jumping like a little kid in the ring
You took this liss horribly. Let's call a spade a spade here mate
LMAO I absolutely love how KSI is still trying to prove he won. Brudda u hugged through the whole match. U started a "combo", didnt land, and u hugged him. I love u as a youtuber, but as a boxer, you are a bum maneee
You lost bro please just take it on the chin please
WWWWWW
Lol nihha
Stop excusing lsi u lost now stfu and cry more 😂
3:23 damn
The Judges only said you lost the fight because of what you titled your last vid.
Ksi you won it the juge got is wrong he hit you at the back of the head but I got prime I need ksi prime grape and   Lemonade
JJ you are the best you’ve won the fight keep going hard work pays off
U won it in our eyes brother
No one gives a shit ? He's a fury. You didn't stand a chance  anyway tyson probably gave them a tip 😂😂  You won in our by just putting on a nother fanastic  event
We love you JJ but leave the personal attacks with Tommy to the side, you’re bigger than that❤
Twat why did it took this long to comeback . Fakin Yt was useless and the fakin sidemen among us new episode not come .
Brudda win or lose your supporters will still be here! We just wondering where you been at fam!!
Regardless of the outcome, we’re all proud of you JJ. You proved that with hard work and dedication , you can achieve anything you set your mind to🙏🏽
I don’t care if you loose, you were a kid playing FIFA in your basement and now you went pound for pound with a professional boxer. Much respect JJ Although I still think it was a draw 😅
U lost bro. U act like a kid who lost in a game. Grow up. U r a 30 year old guy 🤡
Stop trying to cope, do a reddit video
the amount of copium here is unsettling
jj i love u man u come a long way
the overly edited subtitles hurt my head lol
Yeah KSI won I hate watching the fight to tell you the truth I also don’t understand why JJ was even really upset like he has so many talents to Music Content  Etc so In all honesty 🤬Tommy 🤦🏻‍♂️
When’s the new album @jjolatunji
Anyone who genuinely thinks that KSI lost should get their heads checked because I don't get what mental gymnastics you have to do to be that delusional
Sore loser. Take the L and move on.
Glad you're back, but telling your fans to harass tommy is weird. It was a good fight, welcome back
"I was sparring demons"  *shows idris virgo
The Music career needs a comeback again
Anyone know where the tee is from?
Hold the L turn it into a W
Won the fight, didn’t win decision. Win or lose, I’m still going to be supporting you.
cmon you dindt even box him you were dancing the whole time
We love you JJ. Keep up the hard work!! ❤
I dont care about win or loss. I dont care about boxing. Can you give us some content like the old days please. No more boxing please?
JJ YOU ARE THE GOAT REGARDLESS
You got robbed
I think u won. But i still want u to fight jake. Its gotta happen.
We love you JJ ❤
Tommy fury 😂 is a funny man tbh like why can’t he take of his kid but aye Ksi still a champion man
We love you JJ Proud of you 🙌❤
You're Goat Keep up. Ain't No rest for the wicked.
you've won that fight
you are a winner man just respect and love for you
Ksi the only man in boxing history to go into the ring to hug instead of throw punches
We are proud of you
It was a draw at best so dw man you didn’t lose
You lost why try convincing that you won
This was cringier than Logan's Japan apology video. Take the loss on the chin, you're 30 years old, how are you still going to send a fan hate train towards someone, lie to your audience and leave out all the facts to protect your ego and legacy. You lost fair and square and will be on your death bed not able to accept it. That's the difference between you and the pauls, they know how to take L's. You've been so lucky that you never had to, outside your own mistakes.
ngl ksi I like you and your content, but bro keep it real with yourself you have shit form. respectfully you may have power but man any person can clearly see you are not a well trained boxer. I mean its reasonable your a YouTuber; but Jesus man sometimes I think you need to lower your ego a lil bit like stop being delusional. I wanted you to win, but if anything that "fight" was a draw at best, man you were hugging him the entire time. And sorry bro but if you bring this type of fighting form against Jake he's knocking your ass out. And bro Im not even a Jake fan, if anything Im yours. Just keeping it 100
Hahaha take the L
Bros laughing but you can tell he’s still pissed off,,,,even after the fight he’s talking about Tommy private life wife family etc…..give it rest 😂🤦‍♂️
This is start of rematch beef
I’m liking this guy more and more. Great to see someone able to showcase their true self to the world. Btw, somehow you were my top artist on Spotify this year. Got that video you made for all of us👍🏻
Come on man.. If in some world you have won, it's in Hugging competition, not boxing.
Even though you lost, we’re still proud of how long you lasted in NNN.
W KSI
This nerd beat a professional boxer and did way better.he got robbed
You did not win, jumping around and hugging someone is not a fight 😂
KSI VS SPEED BIGGER THEN JAKE PAUL
Blud it was a draw at best both shit at the sport🤣
In my eyes you won the fight but you lost everything when you spat your dummy out and started whining and kicking monitors etc. That's the test of a man, how to handle a loss. There was respect for you when Tommy's hands were lifted and then lost it when you spat out your dummy, it's sad when Jake paul looks like the more mature man after taking a loss and you look like the child... Its supposed to be the other way round. Either way you definitely won the fight just sucks it ended like it did
You did not lose that fight, even if the appeal doesn’t work the whole world knows you won. We are proud of you and ur an inspiration to all of us💪
Dear JJ KSI Olatunji, I challenge you to dragon ball legends. Accept by liking or replying.
Yes bro you lost stop being delusional
Bro u lost.
lol
L bozo+dont care+Jesus is King not you
To me you won. Well done jj❤🔥💯🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿. I hope you have more family time now. Actually  spend time with your girl. Keep well jj. Health is so important without health what use is money. Well done mate you deserve all you have just keep well dude.❤
Copium
We love you JJ, in my opinion I thought you won but don’t let this hold you down bro. You fought a pro boxer, lasted 6 rounds and only “lost” by 1 point you did amazing we are so proud of how far you came we will always continue to support. Love you JJ and thank you for all you done for us all these days❤
Honest opinions, probably should've been a draw but neither should've won. But regardless, your fighting style was shocking. I was expecting more from all that talk about boxing IQ and how you're different but you can't come out looking like that after all of that pre-talk. Embarrassing for the sport. But respect the work ethic
We’re still proud and inspired by you win or lose
Still proud of you for trying JJ. "KSI the goat tho"  may still apply lmao
This is what happens when you decide to fight a bunch of nobody's claiming they are pros, some fucking youtubers, rappers..... i'm sure that pineda, swarmz, and temper camp were tough 😂😂😂
KSI is The YouTube GOAT, I don't care if you desagree... this man is a legend!!
Nigga Ksi so but hurt just be humble ignore your ego
Man you really don't like to lose do you JJ?
The king is back 💪🏼
You did win ksi we are proud of u ❤❤❤❤
hugging the whole time time and fighting from the clinch doesn’t win fights , tommy fury clearly won this embarrassing so called fight
Still lost though. Tbh
Yeah obviously he couldn’t knock you out every time he tried to punch you would just hug him
GOTTA LOVE THE DECEMBER CPM!!🤑
LSI 😂😂😂😂
I can tell Mo didn't edit this video 👀
Loser. Get over it lad
Good for you, JJ! You definitely needed rest; your laughs were slowly fading, and you were totally burnt out. Take another holiday after 6 months 🙂
JJ has surrounded himself with yes men.
Yes ksi you won end of conversation
Trust me. Mate. You lostt!!
If you have believed you have won. Then you have won. The People have believed u won and everyone!
Cope video
"Youtube" boxing is a farce and a stain on the actual sport. Give it up. And did you really just tell 16 million subscribers to essentially harass him in public 🙄🙄
We still love you bro. Was top 0.05% of your Spotify listeners this year ♡
My Goat Jide Junior 🙌🏻
You won
Finally a video!!!!
Oh well! I'm sure your millions of dollars will ease the pain!  I'm off to pour concrete for 10 hours!
F
Even if you knocked him down or dominated every round theres no way they would let a pro boxer, brother of Tyson Fury lose to a youtuber. We all know boxing judges are frauds
KSI, your the best. My friend is your biggest fan. He went to Toronto downtown.
Bro if some of the greatest minds in combat sports  r saying u won so u def won 🙏
This has got to be the saltiest video I've ever seen you lost the fight because you cuddled to much 😂😂
I don't give a shit about that anymore i am just glad that you are back my G!
Sorry JJ but ur a sore loser my Friend
Jj u barely lose and even when you “lose” you’re still a winner no matter what just keep on making us laugh that’s the biggest win you can ever have ❤
Dang
Its ok jj to lose juat accept it bro now i know how u feel and how much u have worked up soo jj move on bro we as ur fan we will take L with u so just keep ur sportsmanship ❤❤
It was stolen. You won in our eyes
Finally he came back
Big respect to JJ
But disrespectful bringing up how Tommy has been as a father. Insult him about everything else and his boxing is fine
We love you JJ and we're glad to have you back, You'll always be a winner to us ✌🏾
Kudos to jj for taking his time and coming back with a bang💥
sore loser LSI
The outcome never mattered . We’ve rocked w you thru and thru REGARDLESS . I’m just another one of the thousands of voice that will continue to remind you that we are always rocking w you , JJ . We know you’re the true winner and the true champ , regardless of the outcome 🤝🏼
Asking your fans to go someone's socials to promote hate isn't something i expected to come from someone like KSI tbh. Whole video was just coping mechanisms and excuses.
So did you ever pay John Fury though lmao?
I still think the judges shouldn't judge another boxing match again 1:27
cry more
No one cares is you ‘lost’ everyone is proud of how far you have come and how hard you tried
Atleast ksi completed nnn that he lost to this month 👏
You never lost Ksi.. In my eyes you won❤
I think he should revive the reddit. It was amazing content back in the day for pretty much no work at all. What do y'all think.
Tom is so greedy because of the judges just rigged them, they are corrupt clowns
Seeing JJ tell his fans to send hate his way is a shitty thing to do. Stop promoting more negativity! 7:50
JJ you worked hard in my book you did not lose proud of you  thank you showing me anything is possible when you work hard , you are a inspiration to me thank you man
this kid trying to convince us he won...
Ngl u won that but we js talus u doin good mentally 💙
u hugged tommy fury more then u hugged ur dad
We will always love you JJ ❤❤❤❤
LoL lost the fight
Damn..
JJ WHY AINT YOU FIGHTING JAKE YETTTTT
1:33 JJ, i appreciate you or Mo putting DJ’s and Uncle Cheal’s thoughts on the fight too❤😂
😔😔😪
dont worry they can rob you of the win but cant take your fans away
Still the worst fight ever I've ever seen though
9 minutes of KSI being a sore loser
Yes, you lost.
Wow you are a man child. Just because you arguably beat a 24 year old boxer who is still kind of at the start of his career your literally sending all of your fans to harrass him. Wooow
everyone stfu about the loss he didnt lose he won just stfu and stop trying to make him a loser like 90% of you guys
Tommy fury knows deep down..that KSI completely outplayed him.. 😂 we all watched the match it was quite clear who the winner was.. so doesn't matter .. we all saw who won..
Lmao does JJ actually think he could possibly lose with his worth ethic? Dude I grew up watching you and to see that you have an actually grind mindset is all I needed to see. Good stuff 🏆
We are niggas bro
I'm not sure you outboxed Tommy but you certainly outhugged him
We still love u JJ and u know it I believe u won and so do tons of other people that is all that matters u look great btw
Im a huge fan of JJ and all but he sounds real salty this video I can't lie
love you bro
❤
Hmmm I am watching your   for idk 6-7 years coz yeah.. I like your content but to just pointing out the hatred on Fury's post and promoting them I think it's not right  Anyways it's just an opinion
If you all are gonna just hate because of one loss just leave and unsub one fake fan is not gonna hurt jj. He has won more times then he has lost and is a person just like us but you the hating individual can't do what he did..
well you really did "shock the world" 😁
"from tommy fury hitting me repeatedly in the back of the head" just like you were? you did it 5 times in 7 seconds at one point... Guy just can't take a loss, You got out boxed despite trying to hug and dirty box.
The ego is crazy
❤😊❤
Stop being a bad loser it’s not a good look
JJ you deserved that break my guy and honestly, you inspired us all so that's the most important thing in my opinion 🙏❤
Alright when you fighting jake Paul
BOXING IS NOT ABOUT HITTING OTHER PERSON. THATS WRESTLING. AND I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT WWE. THE REAL ONE. EACH AND EVERY GAME HAS A RULE AND POINTS. AND IF U LOVE BOXING, U HAVE TO RESPECT THAT. HONESTLY I DID NOT SEE YOUR MATCH. I AM NOT FAN OF YOUR OPPONENT, I NEVER HEARD OF HIM. BUT POINT IS A LOOSE IS A LOOSE. NO EXCUSE. RESPECT JUDGES. IF U HAVE ANYTHING TO DISAGREE WITH JUDGES, DO APPEAL. WHICH U DID. WHY PERSONAL ATT? U WERE THERE TO WIN THAT BOXING. NOT FOR HANGING THERE.  UR OPPONENT WAS SMART AND PLAYED WITH RULE. I DID CARE U LOSE OR NOT. I DONT CARE HE WON OR NOT. BUT INSTEAD OF POINTING OUT YOUR OPPONENT'S LIFE ISSUE, U COULD SAY "THIS WONT HAPPEN AGAIN" OR "I HAVE TO TRY HARDER MORE." I NEVER BEEN INTO A BOXING MATCH. BUT AS A GAMER, AFTER A FIGHT, EVERYTHING HAS TO BE COOL DOWN. OR CHALLENGE HIM AGAIN. THX
Yo please let mo edit again wtf is this guy with the Indian aahh click click sound on every transition
Get him in the rematch ksi. You can beat him while usyk kicking Tysons ass
JJ👑
You said people were in for a big show but you literally hugged the guy the whole fight…..that was your tactic,,clinch and punch 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
KSI's resolve is tested...      RESOLUTE!
Don’t stop training ✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
"Hey harass the guy that beat me because I'm a 30 year old man child" Bro taking this loss worse than Logan, bro needs to grow up lol I been supporting you since 2019 but this is getting ridiculous
I like KSI but this just sounds so bitter. To add, asking for fans to harass him on socials is just a bit mad. IMO fight was a draw at best.
Ong JJ deserves are break, shit if you want a longer break have a longer one.
JJ wasn't KO ✅ Tommy Didn't even land a good punch he was like if the result was draw he would say I done with this shit so in my view JJ Won And JJ is the winner ❤from India 🇮🇳
How about fight Jake Paul. Stop duckin bruh. Nobody cares about you the other fights
bro you really telling your fans to troll tommy because of that fight
Yes mate you lost
The blessing in disguise with you "losing" the fight is that you finally got to slow down and take a breath.
5:49 Didn't he himself claim to knockout Fury in 4 rounds, 'i only need four.' This guys a hypocrite
We love you jj ❤❤
Honestly I think JJ is a great guy but I think he needed this loss to help him sit back and check himself. If he’s able work on his ego I think it would make him 10 times better. Besides that keep up the good work JJ❤.
Womp Womp lil bro, now chop chop and start entertaining me YouTube boy
The shots fired at the end of the vid are insane😭💀
"Hey harass the guy that beat me because I'm a 30 year old man child" Bro taking this loss worse than Logan, bro needs to grow up lol
an amazing role model...glad ur back
Bro there was no boxing it was a hugging match
Finally he crawld back where ever he was
Cry baby
He didn't win, yeah. But you have to remember that he has the Fury name, the corrupt judges are crazy.
You’re the best man. We love you JJ🤞🏻
Bro wtf you make a video after an appeal saying you lost, I STILL DONT FEEL LIKE I LOST. Bro move on
WSI :D
You have an iron mentality JJ. Keep your head up, you are the absolute best 👑👑👑
Why is this man explaining to us why he needs a rest bro rest you don't owe us an explanation rest brother you deserve it.
I think you won. But ur performance was disappointing. Tommy wasn’t any better but to me it seemed like u just wanted to win on points and that’s why 85% of the fight was just u clinching. Ur a warrior and I respect that. But if Jake Paul vs ksi is happening I ain’t paying for that shit, just to watch u clinch over and over
Still ducking Jake 💀👎
Its ma bday tday
You won in my eyes. i watched from start to finish. That was your win no doubt about it You were robbed keep it up man ❤
LSIII LSI PUSSY
Wow this video was so childish. He’s going backwards
Remember the child you let down ? It never made it because of you
TBH its crazy how you got that far fuck the lost look how far he came guys whatta guy.
It took bro 2 months to realize he lost 😂 all love tho ❤
We love you JJ!❤️❤️❤️
Bro made a video after a long break to to be a sore loser and not accept defeat
Tommy the twat Fury lost against you and you won that fight so clearly
It’s ok JJ. It was a really close one. There are a lot of people who actually feel more disappointed by Tommy’s performance than yours. Considering that he’s a pro boxer, there’s no way it should’ve been that close.
ngl the judges are racist lmao
You hugged and run the whole fight mate
"I felt like I won the fight" but you didn't you cry baby you lost... suck it up and take it like a man.
You're the peoples champion 🏆
This video is just cope 😭😭 hold dat L
KSI you lost because he was better than you. You are acting like a manchild, exactly like Logan after he lost to you. You should be ashamed.
Love you JJ
Jj, we support you, but the game is the game. A loss is a loss, you had a total different reaction with logan and his appeal. Sure the fans were harsh but we’re eating YOUR words. And sure some of the fans can be fake but you cannot make excuses and you have to accept the loss. Even if the appeal goes to your favor, congrats, but your reaction straight after the fight was unbearable to watch because how you were acting. You’re still talking trash to fury even though he beat you, it is ironic and you’re going down the same side with jake paul, let’s hope you change.
Ksi your delusional just admit you losed it was competitive bur you losed. You can't exspect to win a boxing match when your constantly hugging and playing dirty turning your head so he hits the back of it. You losed accept it
It should've been a draw.
That fight was like Cardi B winning 2018 Best Rap Album Grammy
heads up JJ , you were great and always put a smile on my face brother , truly inspiring and motivating ❤
He hugged alot from the fight but rematch time and we learn from our losses trail and error ✔️🙌👌get the rematch 💯 and dont look back
Nigga u lost , accept the reality , all the yapa yapa talking Im him etc etc what happend bro huh
You mean like last month? That was so long ago...
L noob
Bro who cares. Everyone loses at some point, it’s all good! Let’s keep it moving, we just want to see you beat Jake!!! We support you either way.
Annoying how stuck up you are and arrogant you waited for results to come back, good boxers are accountable and know when they are defeated, come back stronger and gain ur followers back
Yes you lost take the L like a man stop complaining stats don’t lie
Nice yap session
JJ you've been an inspiration for many. To witness your journey and to learn from it has been great. Thank you!
hugman who hits at the back of the head complaining about others hitting the back of the head
I find all these wet comments so funny lol, all I’m hearing from this video is a grown man acting like a child, clearly still not over something yet trying so hard to convince himself and others that he is, but hey, you guys stick to being mindless followers. I just say what I see.
still a W
bro you think any of your real fans would care about the loss if anything it looks like Tommy paid the judges ngl you have done so well you have made great progress keep it up bro 👊👊👊
What the fuck
ksi is a joke bruh, dissing tommy in a video just cause he lost to a boxer, accept the loss jj, be mature once in a while and move on, disappointing video.
Soooo good to see him back  ❤🫂
Bro posted on my birthday
Ksi u won that fight belive me, even when I watched it I knew u would win
We love you Ksi
I feel so bad for jj. He won, Tommy should quit
3:53 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂
“so…i lost?” yes bro, 3 judges and an overseeing counsel said so😂. but us your fans don’t care. life goes on. Izzy is a prime athlete i wonder why he thought you won lol.
Poor JJ, this is petty bro. Big Cope.
You won
Tbh I think we have all accepted u won and got robbed and it hasn’t felt weird at all
Jj in the caption : I lost.                         Ksi in video : tell Tommy he lost.           Jj leave it b
bro lost and starts yapping for 10 minutes
you did NOT win that fight sucks to suck
Ksi did win. This is such bs
Ksi lost and that is officially a fact. I love jj but this is definitely not tge way to respond to a loss, if u want to make Tommy look even worse you should just not mention him whatsoever so he doesn't get any view from the public, i stead of trying to put him down every chance u have, it just makes u look bitter
Ksi is like a child that can’t get over a loss lmao… egomaniac
Hold this L
This just in: KSI endorses bullying.
You won the fight.
I really wish he would start playing video games again😍🥰
your ego is just too fuckin big bruv. just take the loss and move on. Dont cry on the internet for the attention.
Bro took a break
Its all cool JJ. The only win we care about is Jake Paul
Brother Pedistes.... ! Ya supéralo!
Saying to berate him if you see him in public is not cool, people have no chill even if hes with his child. Regardless i also think you won, much love, and its great to have you posting again
Denial....Still.
you won the fight tommy lost
I always admire JJs hardwork,  he has manifested greatness... but it's not a pity party 😂 rest up and dry your tears with ur incoming billions 😂
Truth is you both looked terrible in the fight. Neither of you looked like boxer. Tommy was terrible and you did jumping jacks and hugs all fight. not many punches were landed. Terrible fight to watch
we feel u KSI
Let’s be real bro, even though you lost the fight, you did WAY better than Jake
All that talk to cry like a bitch after 😂😂😂😂😂
In the end, you won.
Me and my mate watched the event. I was rooting for you, he was rooting for Tommy. Even at the end we were both like "yeah KSI won". Everyone we spoke to thought you won also. I don't think it was rigged but my opinion is that the judges had a subconscious bias towards the notion that the fight was a YouTuber Vs not only a boxer, but a name known for being top of their league in the ring. Perhaps they assumed the winner from the start. But mate, that fight was absolutely smashing. You put on such a performance. I used to watch you since your QnA Sundays and it's surreal to see what you have achieved. A true inspiration and a testament to the saying "you can do whatever you put your mind to"  That being said, fancy sending me a grand? 😉
Finally yesssssss
Take ur L man
Idc what happens I'm still a fan but stop making those corny ass lines I'm the one that can see John cena
You're the winner ❤️
A great future is waiting for you.. keep grinding bro and keep your lagacy alive 👊
'life isnt fair' - multi millionaire who went to private school
W FANBASE THO
no one cares you lost.... we love you FOR BEING YOU....
And what did Tommy do to KSI that he is still taking personal shots and moaning about Tommy? Grow up you are so fucking sad honestly
To me and the judges you looked like you just hugged him the entire match.
The amount of glazing in this comment section is insane
To be honest I really missed your videos.... And I really appreciate you for always making my days and years in general We love you JJ and we are really proud of you!!
Big proud ! Love you Jj!
Yeah Tommy is not "THAT" guy
Nah I'm sorry but if anything you exposed boxing, as did Ngannou. They don't want the respected names in boxing like the Fury's to lose and i definitely agree with Jake Paul ehen he said the judges know nothing about what's going on in the ring.
OK thats great, but REDDIT VIDEO RN
Here is KSI, taking his family out to DUBAI to spend some quality time together and appreciate the FAMILY LOVE  And then there is Tommy Fury who went out to DUBAI ASWELL and was PARTYING with Chris Brown in a CLUB filled with bunch of half naked girls, neglecting his wife Molly mae and daughter at home even though Tommy was working the same amount as KSI, he chose to party with some degrading women abuser of a man Chris brown.  I can’t believe that sort of low quality man deserves to win. He is wrong on so many levels and has wrong morals.   KSI atleast you have STRONG respectable morals, you won on that my friend 👊🏻
I love this vengeance vibe😄
Fury’s had the judges in their pockets 🙄
Ive missed you daddy
doing a thousand jumping jacks dont make you win fights you dont even know how to throw a simple punch
Carry on your a youtuber not a boxer. Only your clown fanboys will say you win because they delusional af.
you lost my boi hold dat
the fans know how hard you work and the performance you put on speaks for itself, disregard the pointless result
All that training and you still can't even box properly, just bounce around, hug and punch the back of the head or body while clinched, crying about not getting the win you didn't deserve the win and i'm not biased cos neither did Tommy, he is also bad, he has a completely padded record. How are judges supposed to score a boxing match where neither are properly boxing, neither of you won. Though fair play on your work ethic and all you have done, you just suck at boxing haha.
You need to learn how to take a loss gracefully. People will respect  you for that. Thats part of sportsmanship otherwise you are just another influencer boxer.
Jj I’m a fan but y’all were hugging a lot
U have done amazing this year Best YouTuber in the world always will be
he had his own card with his own judges and he's way older than the tommy kid but he still still lost and got humbled now Jjs acting like someones crazy ex lol
Moment i saw the thumbnail i tapped, we've all missed you JJ ❤️
what was deji doing in the family trip
Loser😂😂😂
KSI really has been grinding nonstop for 6 years on various adventures. Respect.👑
the only true L you have is the ksi show
Bro took 7 to 8 business years to accept he lost
legit, no joke like an hour ago i was thinking: -hm i wonder what ksi is doin'?
Doesn't matter if you lost you are still an inspiration for many of us.
KSI is the embodiment of Hard Work, but he is hella salty.
We all know you won jj but don't worry without losing their is no winning
No respect at all, no class in the loss, shut up and take it like a man, come back and prove yourself, jumping jacks mean nothing.
TBH YOU GOT ROBBED
“It’s not about how hard you can hit, it’s about how hard you can get hit”  I ain’t here no bell
Was actually there at the fight on the day and the amount of bullshit smelled from Tommy being announced as the winner was mental lol
Embrace the L my man. You clowned Logan for making an appeal now look at you
Honestly, this video should have been uploaded weeks ago, Everyone respected your decisions, however now you feel just a bit hypocritical. You say Logan was a pussy for appealing against you and now all of a sudden when you appeal its all about mental health and being okay... I respect you so much JJ and I've been watching you and attending literally all of your fights like many other fans, but just take it on the chin, we'll respect and support you no matter what.
JJ at least you didn't get knocked out
Jake Paul just thought your whole fight was trash. He wasn’t supporting you in any way. WTF 😂😂😂
Ksi is the best youtuber in the f*ckin world. We are proud to see you again bro ong.
Womp Womp
My god. He will never change and he is going to willingly gaslight himself in order to feel some superiority  over every LITTLE PERSON he finds annoying...
KSI regardless of the loss keep your head up G, Everyone knows you won. Even Tommy knows it, its quite predictable that Tommy was gonna cheat his way out.We all know his carrier as a boxer. Be safe ❤
❤❤ good to have you back. We love you jj 💪💪
No you're the loser  The record books already says that  So take you're L and move on😅😅😅 Jumping Jack's doesn't win a fight😂😂😂
jj i am a big fans your since 2018 but u need to man up that u lost that fight and u need to tell yourself that u didnt the reach the potential u could have reached i mean it pissing me off that the guy i knew is not maning up like i dont wanna sound like a jake paul fan but jake paul knocked him down u didnt anyways love man
so sore.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. LIL BRO GOT HUMBLED AND CRIED AT HOME
The tantrum after the loss was beyond embarrassing, no excuses for that.
You lost because you was jumping around like a lunatic swinging arms
Tbh,that entire fight was garbage.The least entertaining fight and I've watched the Logan V KSI 2 fight. Honestly,JJ just come back stronger
We are proud of you bro. Dont’t let anything get to you. You will always be our fatneek. You should focus on the future
We human we take Ls but it’s about turning the L’s to W’s gg bro
It’s also the fact Tommy did way worse w Ksi than he did w Jake Paul lol Ksi had a huge chance
Tommy vs jj 2 is coming soon mark my words
My goat ❤
BRUHHHHHHH  MOVE ON YOU ARE  STILL THE F-GOAT INNIT
An Absolute Robbery
Wsi
So proud of u JJ
Still delusional about the clear loss
LSI
Bruh moment
You won bro. Does not matter about the result. The world knows. Take a break and enjoy yourself
Nice to see u back
"Through loss, we uncover the silent strength within, forging a resilience that becomes the backbone of our unwritten victories."
You're a winner man 👏 3 people that sit there and watch the match say you lost while 10s of people that also sat and watch the match say you won 👍
I know you're going to bounce back JJ. Keep it up!
Unfortunately an L but I still love u
Damn didn’t realise how much I missed this man’s words
Wasn’t fair ahahahaha, you were absolutely shite v him
At first I thought JJ won the fight, and that was after I watched the fight and then rewatched it about 2 times. Then the more I rewatched it I thought the fight was a draw and now I still think the fight was a draw. That 5th round was the decider and I feel like both of them did equally enough to win that round so I scored that round 10-10. So with JJ winning rounds 1, 2(point deduction, 10-8), and drew round 5. Tommy winning 3,4, and 6. This fight should've been a draw.
Proud of you JJ, gonna be motivated by your journey and be the best version of me possible cause of this grind
bro made a video this late cause he know he was gonna get clowned so he waited for it to die down
Jj you trained hard yes, but that technique with jumping up and down was stupid. You put all the hard work into the bin.
Ahhhh ha 😂😂😂😂😂 what a fukin joke “it won’t matta it won’t matta”
i think tommy won.
yes
Its crazy how this guy just can’t take a loss. Bro lost and instead of taking it and accepting it he’s over here acting like a 7 year old just complaining and making excuses over and over.
JJ needs to end his boxing career with a match vs Vidal. Vidal would probably win but it would be full circle moment for him.
Typical influencer video saying how hard they work and don’t get no down time my man you have a very easy life
No one cares that you lost, cause you won
you high??
Love ya jide
Someone has to lose. That’s just how the game works. But you tried.
Jj you needed that L so you can become a better version of yourself that loss was your limit breaker keep it up
youre the peoples champ just like ngannou was you inspired millions that night and always have throughout your career your fans will always love and support you ❤
That's one of the worst calls they've ever made they literally screwed you over
You didn't win that fight, and Tommy is embarrassing for boxing
your boxing legacy is exactly like the movie reel steel
الله
u both did nothing, u initiated most of the hugging only people thought u won was because Tommy’s a boxer and realistically should’ve done better, doesn’t mean he didn’t beat you, kicking the board afterwards was pathetic, you also hit him way more in the back of the head
sit down kid
You are a winner already bruvvv
Either way he did better than Jake Paul 😝😂
We all appreciate your dedication and hard work JJ, you deserved the break and we all know you won that fight. Don’t put yourself down. We all support you 🔥💛
delusional looser  tommy fury BETTER Jake paul BETTER
JJ, I’m not a fan of Tommy fury, I honestly think he’s a disgrace to boxing, but suck it up, a loss is a loss, if the judges think you lost that fight, you lost, it was a draw at best, it was neither of your best performances let’s be honest
Wuah wuah wuah Just take the L instead of crying like a baby You've given shit to everyone else that lost before
What was you working on? What overtime was you doing? You didn’t fight, or win? Or dominate? So what was you training?
You truly are an Inspiration
Jesus loves you JJ
Took that long to upload and didn’t even react to the latest result of the appeal wow
You should launch a second appeal can’t let this robbery be allowed to happen you won that fight he didn’t he’s a fraud pro boxer my arse
i have been waiting a while checking all your socials then i checked at one of your socials.. new video is out.. what i checked i was finnaly my life is saved 😅❤
I hate the fact that you're directing your fans to hate on tommy fury, be a bigger man and move on.
I highly doubt its guna get overturned. 3 rounds to 3, lost one point. They aint guna tarnish Tommy's record, the brother of heavyweight champ CANNOT lose to a youtuber. Or what the fook even is boxing..
took you this long? nigga you lost lmao just take it and run with it
Yea you needed to win cus you were hugging him
I just wanted a reddit at this point
I’m sorry, but if you actually boxed instead of bouncing around the ring and continuously clinch, there might’ve been a different result. I mean you did make Tommy Fury look shittier than he was during his fight with Jake 😅
Sore loser man 😂 even after Tommy beat him he’s still chatting shit
Tommy is an embarresment of a boxer feel bad for his family for raising such a pathetic guy and pathetic boxer. You should have won keep your head up keep up the boxing, videos, music everything bro. love
We've missed you bro, welcome back JJ
bro jumped around half the fight and thinks he won lol delusional...fix ur ego bud
My honest opinion the play is the Jake Paul fight. You both lost to Tommy which puts you two on equal grounds in the boxing world. Its the fight everyone your fans, Jake fans, and in-between are waiting for. I think it could be a massive event. Maybe the biggest one yet between you both.
Pay John fury
L
Fck hell just stop crying about it and move on already
Christmas JJ always bangs
lets be hones no one gives a shit about what the judges says, evryone belive and KNOW you won. so dont think about it anymore those judges aginst millions who knew you won at the end of the day it dose not matter what came out of those judges mouth you won adn we all know it
U cry baby why u obsessed with Tommy 😂
I've missed you bro
W
No shit Sherlock
Yea you definitely won that fight but im glad your better on your metal health and other type shit
As one of your fans, your temper tantrum and this near 2 month denial fest has made me lose my respect for you.
i am not using you s hard work, all u did was made soo mouth trash talk and lost in your own event stfu
I mean it doesn't matter if you won or lost that fight because ether way you looked really bad in the fight and tommy fury too I hope that for your next fight you will look better
You lost come on a humble ting
Bro you won Tommy got an point dedicated
Are u really talking about hitting behind the head?😂
At least JJ had tried his hardest
KSI got robbed, but he’s gunna come back bigger and better💯
The haters were praying on your downfall. Guess they were only praying to Satan.
You're inspirational mate. The hard work you put into everything always showed man. True grinder!
Bro took 2 months to make a Video about losing get over it
JJ I don’t care if you won or lost, you put up a great performance. Focus on yourself more. Do music and YouTube more, give yourself a break you earned it.🩵💛
Idk abt the fight,i am just happy that you are back on yt,with the sidemen and finally on your own channel.
Cope
Ngl Tommy hit KSI allot on the back of his head and he only got 1 point off that’s mad
bro no one cares that fight was a whole month ago
Come back home brother we miss you !!come and eat jollof rice in Nigeria
KSI WON IDC WHAT ANYONE SAYS
Don't care about boxing but let's be honest you took the easy way in that fight, Should've swung for his head but you tried to hug him and try to win the decision.
this is just a tommy hate video😭😭😭😭
Take the L like a man
1:51 that honestly might be the best take Jake Paul has ever made. The fight was one of the worst of the night and wasn't really boxing which was so surprising to see especially from Tommy. JJ won three rounds and Tommy won three rounds, so it should've been a JJ win on that point deduction (not a clear win to be proud about, but a win nonetheless). For once, he was speaking straight facts.
JJ your ego is overtaking you and this extreme apathy and crying for a fight that you lost from a professional boxer is not going to take you anywhere. Pick yourself up, dust yourself up and move on.
This video is a few months old huh?
Great to se u back on the channel❤❤
Who’s next?
SaltySI 😂😂😂
JJ I'm a huge fan for a really really long time but you're a sore looser
JJ u won fair and square in my eyes and a lot of peoples eyes they simply couldn’t let that apparent people boxer fraud lose to a YouTuber we all know they’ve the judges have been payed by the fury’s
To all of those people who are Tommy fury fans, talk as much shit as you want because Tommy fury will be the most embarrassing boxer in the history of boxing due to having judges to save him from losing to jj and couldn’t even KO a YouTuber who lasted 6 rounds.
Will we see you box again?  ( i know that we will, but this is for peoples curiosity and know that we will always appreciate you KSI because your a living legend!)
Bro u cried over a loss?? take it like a man, move forward and do better
our goat
thats fucked dont bring his fam in to the beef like ik you won the fight  and you know that so there no point to bring it personal yk ?
It is what it is. Keep making content JJ
KSI, I hope your feeling alreight
In my opinion the fairest should have been a draw.
The "fight" was a snoozer, melatonin is cheaper than that PPV. Both of you lost, you certainly didn't "win" regardless of the cope
the goat, still undefeated
The Youtuber Boxer Paradox - Box terrible boxers, cope that the terrible boxer couldnt knock them out, never fight a solid boxer.
hmmmm. You take so long mannn
You didn’t lose tho, you won
I missed your uploads so much. Whether you won or lost, your real fans will always be proud of your hardwork and how much you accomplished. <3
How about some humility
Hahahah loser.
Someone needs to give him a hug...
Star jump S I
Robbed ? Bullshit ? Yess
WE ARE NOT GOING TO BOTHER TOMMY FURY BECAUSE YOU LOST. MOVE ON AND STOP PULLING A LOGAN PAUL. YOU ARE BETTER THAN THIS KSI, STOP STOOPING DOWN TO THEIR LEVEL.
Yeahhh, couldnt give a shit about the judges. You won, So you won.
I don't know how to feel about this...
BRO U DIDNT WIN
Tbh we all know JJ won that fight but they simply can’t let a pro boxer lose to a YouTuber happen plus hope those judges never judge again Tommy had two fights against two YouTubers ans not one knockout at all plus Tommy kept hittin JJ on the back of the head countless of times pretty sure ya should be docked one point each hit back of the head it seems like they don’t wanna void the result make it a draw atleast
womp womp
The ending was so wholesome, Such a positive message
Yoo JJ, we know you have been busy. We appreciate all the shit you do for the Sidemen, all the content you make for yourself and everything else. Just do your thing and keep rocking brother, we are here to support you!
If he can accept his defeat then it will be nice. Life is cruel so was the fight man I Know both worked hard , And noone can deny it. People have their opinion about who one probably tommy was the lucky one that night if jj can just accept his lost he might success more in future may god bless both in their career. Just saying this but the fight was actually shit really wanted a good one instead of hype promotion. Gl JJ❤
Maybe this was a win overall cause the boxing imo was getting toxic and destroying parts of YouTubers such as their humility…all I saw was egotistical drama and trash fights…just be you man..keep your head high and remember you don’t have to be the best in every category of skills presented to you..relax and live in the present
womp womp
You lost....stop being in Denial
KSI I’ve watched you since forever and I truly rate your movements and what your about! Keep your head and keep Smashing everything which you’ve been doing! Big up the sidemen 👊🏽🫶🏽
u got robbed ok so u get a rematch and show that bitch who is boss
Loser 😂
<3
You know the loss got to ksi when he randomly talks about tommy's family
Ksi fell off
Israel adensaya is signed to prime of course he will agree with you and Eddie Hearn don’t like the fury’s. Hugging and doing jump jack punches don’t win fights take the L and move on
No one cares that you lost but you shouldn't be telling your fan base to hound someone with hate
JJ MAYBE U LOST THE FIGHT BUT U DID WIN OUR HEARTS ,LOTS OF LOVE JJ❤WE ALWAYS HAVE UR BACK
Jj u did better then everyone thought and we are all proud of you..... Ignore all those shitty jake paul or tommy fans u deserve better
Thank you for all the laughing and mental strength that you have given us all these years especially right now that i need it.
Not everyone has the financial backing to drop everything and try something new like you can, utter nonsense
Lmao, okay dude you paying all these bots to say you won. Go look at the main highlight video of the fight. NO ONE IS SAYING YOU WON. Just admit it and move on and get better man cmon.
U did nothing but hug him u shit urself 😂  Edit what’s going on with the eyebrows
You talk too much
Look if your an actual boxing fan Tommy fury won end off this should not even be a debate really 🤷‍♀️ it was just a clear Tommy fury victory and that was a fact 🤷‍♀️ But the fact that JJ was even competing on the same level as Tommy was so respectful and he deserves so much credit for it👏👏
Man u lost fair and square just move on fkin hell what a delusional guy
Thank you for avoiding uploading in november 😁😁😁 would've failed
WWWWWWWW
no matter you lose or win WILL LOVE YOU ALWAYS JJ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥(I STILL BELIEVE YOU WON BTW)
W COMMENT SECTION🥹🥹🥹
JJ now comeback is personal. It should be apologize to your self...
should have been a draw or a win everyone knows u didnt lose
the fight was shit in every way there was no winner but the losers were the audience that paid to watch this
F him jj you won in life
Keep your head up jj like you always do, we always here for you
There’s me expecting a great comeback video. First 2/3 mins going on how unfair it was. Sigh
Exactly the title I expected 😅
Why do we fall, JJ? So we can learn to pick ourselves up
really not even a bad loss, ill always say it could've went both ways, if ksi won ppl would say tommy got robbed
🫡💥
Win or lose idgaf still watching the videos
Big Fan, But your a youtuber not a boxer. The fact you wont take the loss as a loss proves it, just be a man about it and move on.  Sorry for your loss dude.
Ksi you didn't win the fight stop lying to yourself.
stfu KSI was hugging the entire fight.  Tommy Won this!
jj u won man fuck what they say all
You needed humbling tbh, u been making jokes about weller and everyone else whos lost for years on end now u got a taste of ur own medicine
KSI couldn't land a clear punches, he was jumping up and down and hugging Tommy every second. Embarrassing! At least Jake fought like a man and actually engaged with Tommy, KSI kept hugging like a coward
I wish you would've won, but that weird unorthodox style you had was not fun to watch. I still love your content and the amazing things you have achieved though.
Yeah, but KSI the goat tho🐐
Bro went quiet after he lost
This guy needs therapy
we proud of your progression ksi
Ayyy let's welcome our boy back! He's growing up in front of our eyes even behind the scenes. Keep em coming JJ!  Glad to have ya back  <3
❤️
Fury definitely won
so basically this video is him saying what all everybody has BEEN saying, said what all he’s done in his life and telling his fans to harass tommy on his posts and online
Keep your head up JJ
Your my hero man nothing changes that ever, your vidoes give me happiness
LSI 😂😂😂
Pretty ironic how Ksi is talking about another man being a bad dad 🤣🤣
Very salty blacks always have that chip on there shoulder
I don even care I just want uploads lmao
I always wondered what this video would be like
The cope and the EGO from Jj is insane, all he did was doing jumping jacks and hugging throughout the whole six rounds, and then expects to win. For the first time in his life he lost, and the first thing he does is calling it a robbery, embarrassing. At least jake didnt cry and acted like a little girl or a 5 year old while kicking screens and throwing a tantrum after he lost. Jake came back from it, ksi and his team are still coping. Hes gonna be 90 still appealing cause his ego won't accept he lost lmao what a man child
Nice to see you're doing well, however encouraging your viewers to publicly berate Tommy is just evil bro, set an example fgs, stop stooping so low.
biggest fucking baby
could've won more clearly tho so it's still partly your fault
i'm almost crying
Hello so long since your last post
We all knew you would loose. Just not that close 🤷🤣🤣🤣
❤
jake better
good to have u back as a winner
Doesn‘t matter if you won or lost the fight, your display of boxing skills was really sad to watch (Timmy‘s even more so as he’s a supposed „professional“)
Lmao such a loser 😂😂😂😂😢 cryy ksii ur children will definitely know now that their father got a L from furry hahahah and the rest of the generation will know it as well XD
hunbled
JJ we still will support you and this isn't the end ❤🙏🏾but I hope this was a learning experience and hopefully one day you can improve your windmill technique so you can win convincingly and box with better accuracy because JJ your technique is still flawed which is why you couldn't land effective shots and convince the audience.
It's the fact that you're on par with Jake Paul, that makes this a bit of a bad situation more than you just losing to someone.
we love u bosss
I mean Tommy isn't embarrassing you are the way you reacted was embarrassing and obviously he looks after his daughter
Run it back this time killshot
ksi got a question for u will the legend be boxing again
are you gonna retired
nice have a good time and keep it up,  and tbh it was a shit fight from both
Hell yeah you did HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
oh nah how you lose..
It's ok bro. You win some and lose some. Keep your head up.
Tommy won because the PBA would never let a youtuber beat a "real boxer"
all of u need to zip it up when ur done
waittt howww IS KSI HERE WASNT HE JS IN THE SIDEMEN VIDOE THAT WAS UPLOADED LIKE 32 MINUTES AGO
@Lilmaxkid are you here??
whas good
Buddy I mean you said you were so confident that you were gonna knock him out and didn’t. You were even trying to speak into existence,”when I knock Tommy out” and didn’t. You thought you were better than Tommy fury and you lost so don’t pull out the I’m a little nerd kid and went toe to toe with Tommy cause in your eyes you lost to someone worst than you. That’s tuff😂 You are Ben that one sparring partner saying your gonna knock him out and didn’t😂 And you talk about hitting in the back of the head like bud have you watched yourself fight you Always hit in the back of the head and the refs don’t  deduct points from you. And your just hugging the whole time and throwing the same combo and saying you got better😂 literally no difference 😂
yes you lost.
I ain’t gonna dickride like the rest, you definitely lost but still good to see you back.
Your video title should have been My lose excuse finally
So happy your back bro❤️You won the fight but life’s not fair🤷🏾‍♂️
u lost
KSI your dum you DOSSER
Man we really missed you !!! Proud of you, you proved everything you said before ❤❤❤
Bro is such a sore loser lmfao
Your trainers gave you that GSP treatment. Great to have you back!💯
Tommy maybe shouldn’t have won but you also shouldn’t have won. Draw, you both lose because it was the worst fight ever.
Took the lost like a little girl throwing a temper tantrum kicking  walls took you long enough look at you appealing like Logan sore loser
You was hugging him the whole time that fight was horrible
Tommy winning ends the interest in influencer boxing so nobody cares anymore
JJ I don’t care if you won or lost, you put up a great performance. Focus on yourself more. Do music and YouTube more, give yourself a break you earned it.
Let’s go the knowledge strength and integrity man is back🎉🎉🎉
I still look up to KSI no matter what
admit losing its not a bad thing but despite all of things that admit that u won the fight its a just destiny the success is in the journey itself not wining
Win or lose, we are still so proud of you JJ.
king. <3
We all know who the real winner is and that’s you JJ ❤❤
Still goat still best love you brother
are you retiring because i want jake paul vs ksi  2024 summer august 28
So did his appeal get denied??
When I watched this fight live, i thought ksi won this becasue tommy didnt bring anything to the table
❤
Lol this loser came up with an excuse video
Yes you did lose
JJ stop saying ''I cant believe I lost'' because you didnt, you clearly won so take the W and move on.
Its nice to see you manning up and making this video
One record loss means nothing man.
You are an inspiration, you should have atleast got the draw if not the win, but in no capacity did you lose, now it's time to berat tommy
The fact that ksi did way better against Tommy is proof that jake is the one ducking and not jj
Still ducking jake paul
you did all that training to hug then says you won smh you lost because you looked like the loser from the start.
all love to jj
Honestly just from watching the fight, I thought you 100% had that won and I was surprised by the result but you showed what you preach anyway, big ups
Been a long time.
Man's still a g
Humbled ksi nice
YO IT'S THE BOY KSI IS BACKKK!! FINALLY AFTER 3000 YEARS!!
You won robbery
just scrolled throught these comments looking for "lilmaxikid"
Petty ksi what we need 😂😂
are you seriously saying about tommy hitting you in the back of the head? yet you did it aswell and did so much clinching. the fact you wasnt given a point deduction for hitting him in the back of the head or excessive clinching is ridiculous.
You still the man. The better fighter.  Love you
old news mate
love u jj❤
You can’t talk about being a father when you had several abortions
That fight was so obviously you it was genuinely insulting to boxing. Fury can leave in an ambulance and they'll still declare him the winner. Then what happened with his brother like 2 weeks later where Ngannou was also robbed, just makes the Fury's a joke to boxing.
R fat neek lost
The fact you didn’t even need to mention John Fury trying to scam you of 200k when he Infact owes you 200k shows how big of a man you are JJ💪🏼
JJ please stop nagging about Tommy, he was only relevant when he fought you and Jake, now we don't give a damn about him at all!
Jj... you lost, the only thing worse than a loss is not accepting it. You had the chance to grow? You talked equally crazy, only difference is you lost, why do this video? And the vast majority did not believe u won either, you cant be selective of what u see and hear
Most awkward konichiwa😂....ever......  Still better than....
RIGGED
Crying 😂
Tbh no hate but i think the W would have gone to tommy anyway  Tommy played like shit compared to the calibre he expects from his league
wow
Now lilmaxkid can sit in Peace
Just don’t wry mate, Keep it up❤
KSI OG FOR RLY!!!!!!
*_KSI_* keep your head up
9 minutes of coping is crazy
❤
We all know he lost. Get over it
Yeah you lost fam stop being a hoe about it
King 👑
win, lose,   every great out there takes losses. glad you're back 💙
JJ I like you a lot but in no way did you win that fight. It would be embarrasing if you did as well considering you were jumping around like a monkey doing jumping jacks..
This man, may not be the perfect one around, but goddamn he does not give up. Respect. 😎
I knew jj would disappear when he lost
Win or Lose, we're still proud of ya
so ksi just came back so say the judges were wrong?bro was giving hugs his dad couldnt give him and he is here saying he won ??????? lmaooo
🫂
It's okay JJ! You have trained your heart out!!! You deserve so much respect for all the work you've done and there's always another time when you will come back STRONGER!
HE IS BAAAAACK
Love you man and we will always be behind our fatneek i mean fitneek
Did Tommy Fury ruin YouTube boxing?
Jj we all know you won  We are proud of you
He didnt lose the fight. you kept on hugging him. i dont get why you now have to mock him on your platform even after the fight. wtf is your problem? The reason people say you won is beacuse you told your fans that you shouldve won. thats why they obviously is going to say the same. Even after all that your ego just keeps on going. You show 0 respect and just be acting like a dum clown who won't admit your mistakes. I am a clown for even commenting on this trash, but tbh i just had enough. I know no one cares, but i have to get my opinion out.
What a joke Even if tommy didnt win, you really think your performance was a winning one? Dont be a hypocrite
This man is still on about this god damn move on it happened shit sucks
Welcome back JJ
JJ you are still a winner to us. You are such a hard working person. You cannot be stopped
I thought KSI should’ve won but if we’re being honest, it wasn’t a dominating performance. He didn’t show us anything new. and we all know to never leave it up to the judges. I don’t want to sound like a hater, I’ve been the biggest KSI fan since middle school and now I’m 22. But everybody who actually watches boxing and any sort of combat sports, knows that JJ fighting style is garbage. Like he needs someone in his corner, to coach him on the basics of boxing. That fighting style may work on amateurs and other Youtubers with no experience but you’re facing a real boxer. That was never going to really work. I was hoping he was going to come out and show us something new, but was disappointed honestly, all that clinchit doesn’t showcase your boxing ability.
Bro I’ve been waiting a hot second for a vid
Man shut u bich ahhh we love you no matter what!!🤳🙏
We all lost. That was the worst boxing event ever😅
Jjust dont ever inflate your ego to that level again my guy
It dossnt matter if you lost it matters how you accept it and move on
This guy crying over a decision he rightfully lost 😂😂😂😂
Poor Mo must be bankrupt 😭
Take it easy for now you achieved more than many expected. You won in our eyes.
we love you bro no matter what happens
It's kind of funny that people on reddit  said he was going to say a lot of the things he said in this video.   Also, with that said. He lost on judging, a technicality. Which is such a political nonsensical type of way to win or lose. Like- no one won because of strength alone, no one was knocked out. It was all nonsense. So don't even worry about it. I would be more worried if JJ lost by getting the shit beat out of him.
lv u
WSI
Ffs I thought it was gonna be a Reddit video
He wins....we all knew at the moment he entered.
have rematch if u think u can win. but you cant win. you know this
Just wanna hug you bro. I feel bad the L, but it was an outcome that you could not control. You gave everything you can and showed levels, everyone knows that. You are the true winner. Love you and I really hope you recover from it 100%. I look up to you in so many ways I can’t explain. You are goated.
Im so happy he posted, the notification had me smiling
Bro is gaslighting the kids 🤣
THE KING HAS RETURNED
hardly any points where he was beating you? please stop being in denial.
You didn’t take the loss well… you did not win the fight you hugged Tommy more than you punched him, 76 hugs from ksi
Its not about loosing, Its about how you deal with it. Sports is not a movie script where winning is guaranteed. You acted poorly after the loss. But you can still learn and improve. And yes you lost and terrible match.
You’re never going to beat a professional fighter doing star jumps in the ring unfortunately. Doesn’t matter what people say… the judges said you lost. Get over it
"Let's remind Tommy that he didn't win that fight" Who's gonna tell him?
I wanted a ylyl
I love you Jj you a legend in my book and you the reason why I go so hard in life stay bless brother
Mate you didnt win the fight cuz u hugged the entire time
Giving him hate om instagram and actaully telling people to do it, is a bit mad. You should be better than that.
We learned that Tommy can't box for shit lol
ksi vs tommy fury rematch?
JJ won by far robbery mate happy your back also
Does the forehead give you strength?
You're lying to yourself if you keep telling yourself you won. It's called BOXING. BOXING. You can't expect to win if you don't BOX.
fair play jj, i believe you lost the fight fair & square but you definitely surprised a lot of people during the fight including myself
only comeback you’ll have is if you win IShowSpeed
no you won the judge got the score wrong and later admitted it
Welcome back! Number one champiooon🎉
Even all the haters are here to watch the video and give views . I swear the obsession of people with ksi. Yall really need a life check
Bro icl the world forgot that fight even happened like a week later, it was a “YouTube boxing” fight just take the money and be grateful😁👍🏻
"I don't care if 3 random people thought you won" That goes both ways dipshit
First!
Robbed☹
“I haven’t stopped working since 2017”  Bro you’ve been doing sport and music . Try working 40 hours every week
look Jake Pauls knockouts and resume, he way better then you LMAO
You should’ve thrown more punches mate….. I thought you won too but you didn’t try your hardest to take the win
At the end of the day, Tommy Fury was lucky to get the win but tbh neither man deserved to win after that embarrassing fight. We all know that even if JJ won, him and his fans would've been celebrating like crazy even though it was still a boring and uneventful performance 🤷‍♂
U clearly lost bro lmao
NOOO HE POSTED LILMAXKID WONT RESPOND TO COMMENTS ANYMORE
rematch?
THE GOAT IS BACK ❤️
like this if you couldn't care less bout jj's loss
Boohoo you’re getting paid millions
Jumping jacks are impossible??
Thank fuck it isn’t a Reddit video
Its fine, we wake back up to our losses.
Now, you showing off the you hang with him? seriously? Still isn't admitting you lost. This whole video screaming " I'm still Salty".
Remember, even Goku lost against Beerus by alot dispite everything at risk 💪
I hope you’re humble in your loss now
Bro he legit insulting tommy for rematch he ainr changing, i hope jake paul knocks him out so his ego completley shatters and can't talk more shit.
Least you had a crack bro!
Can't beat everyone my guy just keep up the content
Jake Paul better
Ksi 🐐
no matter if you lost, you are a great boxer/youtuber!
It’s crazy how we all collectively know that KSI got the better of Fury in that fight  Whether you like KSI or not, you can’t not acknowledge his awkward style overwhelmed Fury’s casual style
@lilmaxkid your boyfriend is back
Hard work beats talent!
Bro lost 😂 and bro won a fight with a elbow 😂
I stayed up to watch the fight and I was so disappointed that you lost but your hard work will always be appreciated by your fans.
😊👍
Love u and respect u for being a friend a big brother to so many of us❤❤❤
That bandana getting bigger and bigger..
Ksi still salty😂
Focus on beating Jake Paul. KSI vs Jake Paul 2024
loser
Nah he just didn’t wanna get clowned by Reddit
I want to meet you someday and thank you for inspiring me , keeping me out of depression and many more...you don't know bro how much you've impacted my life...I had given up very earlier but your example kept me working hard...love you brother ❤ Hope we'll meet someday...❤
I don’t actually care what anyone says…. Ksi won that fight
you won that
KSI hasn't learnt anything, once I heard the back of the head argument. He may have got you by 2-5 back of the heads, but KSI done like 20 back of the heads to tommy in that fight
NO MORE TALK FOR US KSI IS THE REAL WINNER ❤️‍🩹
Yeah not gonna lie that fight was shit, but ksi still should have won what a robbery even for a shit fight
is it me or its been a long time jj has uploaded. anyways no matter the loss you have taken, we are all proud  of you man keep it going.
just let tommy enjoy his life man
To be honest, you don’t need to be boxing. You already made it. All boxing brings is brain injuries and trauma. People that traditionally boxed did because they had nothing. You are a billionaire and boxing for you is just a hobby and something you don’t need to take a serious especially with the repercussions in later life. You want to live a legacy look at what Jimmy is doing with Mr. Beast that is a real legacy
100% you won the match I don't even keep up with boxing, it's not really my thing but I like your content and took the cliff notes of what happened during the fight so without a doubt you won. He should have been disqualified in my opinion or after the second shift to the back of your head.
Missed you, but can you please tone down the ego tbh
The fight was should’ve been a tie
The fight was never gonna get overturned, it was too close a fight they had to uphold the judges scores. It was just luck on the night and the fury name that meant that Tommy won. That should be worth more than a win to JJ and should defo be a loss for Tommy who just about won against a YouTuber
LLLLLLLLLLLLLL
"nah id win"
Head up, u won that bro! 🥰
jj WHY U SO SALTY BRO
You know whats funny but sad at the same time I used to watch jj eat pasta watching salty videos This is that  THE SALTINESS IS INSANE
Face it JJ, you had the shittiest trainers.
I know you might be super frustrated!! It doesn't matter you win or lose!! Your still a Legacy and we always BELIEVE in that! Missed you laugh very much😂😂
I don't think many care considering boxing isn't exactly your entire career, neither is Music. If we're being honest they're more so side hobbies that were fun.
Regardless of the win, the numbers, and other shit, true fans will acknowledge the fact that you won in our eyes. Yes, it fucking sucks that you have to deal with additional bs on your plate. Yes, you have to deal with bullshit and shit-talking from everyone who has any reason to doubt and hate your progress. Yes, you might not have your way to feeling humbled and now (hopefully lmao) educated you will use your downfall as motivation to come back more virtuously.   In the meantime, while you take your break brother, please use your rest well, become better than just a nightmare, become better than any presence that might hold you back, cherish and honor the support all around you, benefit the skills you’ve learned in and out the ring and simply bounce back. I know you’ve been away focusing on yourself, your friends, your family, and your brand but it shows respect for me that you’ve come a long way for yourself and us to believe we can beat the doubts and expectations so I want to thank you man. 🙏🏾✨  Also if you come back to the ring, NO MORE STAR JUMPS I mean shit I love to see you fight but not while you hopping like Mario and Ryu on the ring lmao.  😂😂😂
Us fans don’t follow or support you just because of Boxing, It’s a fun side quest but we follow you because of YOU!
beerus would be proud
You've entertained us for so long, honestly do what's best for you, we are here to support you
Blud still thinks he won the fight 💀💀💀 JJ is a sore loser
Early😊
Respect JJ
Bro is finally back😂🎉❤
The return of the king
He's back🎉
We missed you JJ, god bless you for your return Mr. Olatunji
After watching this vid with everything Ksi has said its become pretty clear that boxing is just buisness to him at the end of the day, say what you want but he's playing his role well, cant knock the hustle
"its not over yet" - ksi
YOU'RE THE G.O.A.T
Hearing a billionaire complain, he has had to work hard  (Aka touring and marketing PR) never lands well. You are rich, Dont try to relate.
JJ, your true supporters doesn't care if you won / lost. All of us realise you are terrible at boxing (So is Tommy). A motivating career nonetheless
Bet
Love and peace to you my brother 💙💙💙💙
Just go bald man just go bald
You lost
Finally my boy is back. Yeah, win or lose bro we got your back.
3:53
Nah fuck that bro lost all that cocky shit gone now
play dragonball legends please
I’ve watched KSI since fifa 12 and I think this loss is good for him as I was starting to get concerned about his ego. Seems grounded and level headed about the situation and I wish him the best!
7:50 does not look good KSI... asking us to go spam his posts and belittle him public is for sure some grade of emotional harassment and bullying
U did great bro.... appreciate your work 💪💪💪
release all your sparring footage and never box again
I knew this vid was coming
Nah forget all that when fortnite droppin the jj skin the prime skins😭
I thought this was a Gordon Ramsay vid  Fookin hell this guy can cook🗣️
I think you were robbed also to be honest and hope it gets corrected, but to take 3 random clips and basically call someone a crap dad is abit of a p!sstake to be honest.
yo jj looks nice, had to remind myself im straight
Just wait for the appeal guys we all will laugh together at Tommy
Been a while 🗿
The way he reacted after the fight was embarrassing, the fight sucked and was just a hug fest, it always gonna be hard to call when both fighters forgot where their arms were. Idk what made him think he was entitled to a favorable decision.
Still proud of you ksi
still a sore loser and keep crying.
You guys reckon he's done with boxing or will he fight again?
Nobody cares that u lost but u were hugging the entire fight and made it boring for everyone. That’s what turned people off and how u handled the decision. Not the loss itself. I mean how can u cry about a decision when u did nothing to win? U landed 4 punches outside of the clinch? And yes it was KSI who was initiating clinch with his stupid karate style not Tommy that’s y Jake vs Tommy was actually entertaining and this was a snooze fest.
Don't worry, man. You and Francis Ngannou destroyed Furry Brother's
What wasnt fair was you making people pay for a hugging match you gave🤣🤦🏽‍♂️
Sore loser
Even it's over for you with boxing, I'm still proud what did you achieved. I hope now you'll be the more reckognizable in music inddustry, no matter how it goes, you have a massive army behind. 😊
The goat is back 🐐
Mate your real fans and supporters will actually not care about you losing some fight or smth. We'll stay and enjoy your content just the same as before the fight. Maybe just be prepared to be made fun of at reddit fatneek 🤣
Love you JJ <3. Your such an inspiration man. Your my idol. Thank you for everything🐐🙏🙌❤.
Olajide Olatunji
Such Stronzata. You deserved to win that, no you did win that. Man I hope you get over this. You did brilliant. Stay strong bruv. Much love❤
baldski!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bro is salty af after the loss
Welcome back JJ it’s good to see you and your Channel again and hopefully you have a good Christmas for your family and your brother and let’s be fair you should be proud yourself. Hope you enjoy your wonderful day. I will see you next time This is a message from Jack 🎉😊
I was mad cause that was goofy
in our heart u won
deez nuts
Smelly fart head
You lost bro simple, and ur ego needed deflating. You gotta take the L on the chin and move on and do better
What do you mean it wasn't fair? You kept making fun and a mockery of Logan when he thought he beat you, and then now when you've clearly lost. Anyone who reviewed the fight after its happened, who was a boxer, who made a video on it. Thought you lost, anyone whos rewatched the fight thought you lost. I am a KSI fan, but JJ you are delusional, you kept hitting tommy in the back of the head and then claiming he was the one who was doing it originally when it was YOU who started doing it, and kept getting away with it.  Your corner advised you to keep clinching to try and bait tommy into hitting you in the back of the head so he would get another point deducted, frankly I can't blame you. Because you stated your game plan fighting tommy from the start, you said you weren't going to box him you were going to fight him. And frankly you were exactly right. You broke the boxing rules numerous times in an attempt to win, and made the fight so unbelievably boring to watch.  Frankly, I am disappointed in KSI's skill set and the way he boxes, it felt like ever sense the logan fight, he has regressed in boxing ability and not progressed, since he trains with MMA coaches, it appears that hes breaking boxing rules more and more as he boxes, from elbows to back of the head shots to constant clinching  And for anyone who doesn't know, constant clinching will actually decrease your performance in the judges eyes  if you and your opponent both landed 39 punches in a round, but you only got it from the clinch, your opponent wins the round. It doesn't matter if the punches are the same, fighting with a constant clinch style is shamed upon by judges and by fighters  Currently, I think JJ will not improve if he keeps having these ideas that tommy didn't beat him, because he will lose his next fight if that is how he trains  TL:DR I felt that KSI is delusional, he did not win this fight based on boxing scoring, and if he fought tommy fury with a boxing style, i think he would've gotten flatlined out cold
u lost lol
YES YOU DID LMAO
I still think the fight was a Tie to be fair but it was not a loss man xD.
Denial and his dick rider fans are in great denial 😩😭 bruh coping so bad it's sad ☠️ will he ever respond to the absolute roasts he got on his own reddit that they legit shut down his reddit 😂🤣
Hello
yoooo i love you KSI
Finally the balls to upload we stand with you ❤
I guess if you think and others think you won, you would’ve only won by a point deduction. If you are who you say you are and did this for legacy , then you should be defo disappointed that you were gonna win another fight by a one point deduction. Plus that tantrum at the end. So childish. And this is From a og fan
took him long enough
The goat finally upload
Welcome back champ
Don’t worry bro we love you 💙
Bro cant take the L #RentFree #L
Gracefully take the L
My cousin took a shot every time y’all hugged…  He died from alcohol poisoning…
This guy really got no shame....man still has the audacity to trash on Tommy    Talk about delusional
Finally lilmaxkid will stop replying to all the comments
glad youre in a happy place man
rigged bro
Sometimes is good , sometimes is shit. ~Gennaro Gattuso

Easiest harassment lawsuit of Tommy's life
Your fans know that you won the fight
He's backkkk
First 18,000
How much money did you make that night
I'm not even Bothered, we're Just Glad you're Back to put smiles on our faces just as you always do
NO KSI, stop beating a man on the ground! Tommy is down bad, call child protecting services and leave him alone.
Even when he’s taking a break it still feels like he’s giving us a lot
Tommy fury smoked you, get over it, joker
Who's been waiting for this vid.. checking daily when the nest KSI video was coming out and what he was going to say after all his build up
keep your head up We are proud of you Jj
the ''lets keep reminding him'' part was not grown up lol.
The curse of the "gonna shock the world" Continues.
So you lost? No shit
Bro its fine just make us laugh with tntl's and monkwe videos
Idk abt the other ''fans'' but i rlly dont are about your so called loss, you trained hard but he won wich but you shouldnt give up at any cost, we are always gonna be your supporters no matter the situation
yes. you lose
You shocked the world mate
Jj let's be honest, you lost and you are shit at boxing. No hard feeling but you are a hard worker.
Now I know you won’t see this but ever since you dropped that narrative of “Hard work pays off if you grind and don’t stop” ever since then I started grinding I put a lot of hard work into myself and into something I enjoy doing and it’s paid big and I appreciate the motivation you gave me to push you’re a huge inspiration to alot of people JJ keep up with the good work you saved a lot of people physically and mentally from depression
JJ we’ve been here since day 1 ain’t nothing gon’ change our appreciation for you and the entertaining content you bring.
You weren't a man enough to say that you lost until now 😂😂😂😂😂😂 thats why. He probably just needs a hug
Missed u bro don't care if you lost to tommy fumbles just keep entertaining us bro.
Respect for you JJ you won the fight in our eyes brother! Keep making us laugh with your videos bro
Bro you were hugging Fury like every 3 seconds
Still ducks jake Paul
U def won bro dw
Finally uploaded ‼️
Only thing you could do now thats best for you and your psyche is move on, learn from this, promise yourself that you will do better next time around, if you choose to continue boxing. Take it on! Dont want some of it. Take all of it!
We love you JJ!
I’ve been a KSI fan for over 10 years so I’m not biased here, but Tommy did win the fight he kept the pressure on JJ didn’t bring the fight he just cuddled Tommy whenever he got close
When is the Jake paul fight
Just stay strong 💪
It's alright man, we all lose once in a while
Ksi my dude the owners of the boxing sport won't allow a youtuber to win cause that would bring down the boxing imagine
You SHOCKED the world bro!
humbled ksi = likable ksi ??
Tbh, the hype of the fight was nowhere near what we expected,it's more like a hugging competition😂....but props to jj for his work dedication, he really entertained us throughout the years
Head up JJ you won that fight doesn’t matter what the judges or even the appeal says we know you won that fight you did what many thought was the impossible you pulled off the upset. You are the true winner 🐐
Don't worry m'y body your BEST boxer ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😻🥰😻🥰😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻🥰😻😍😍😻😻😍😻🥰😻😻😻😻🥰😻😻🥰🥰😻😻😻😻😘😻😍😍
deadass idc if you lost im just glad you got in that ring and that your back
Pba are corruption
Bro you lost move on 😭
your a garbage fighter, absolute embarassment that night lmao
As much as I believe that jj lost the fight… he is completely right that some lil nerd that shoved his face in the monitor playing fifa was able to go toe to toe with a fury… that says allot about about Tommy tbh
Jj u sore loser 🗣️🔥🗣️🔥🔥🗣️
love u jj
Aye bro on Smackdown, Logan said his next opponent is in for a “nightmare”. Does this mean anything to you 👀
You didn't lose
The ref stop the second round 16 seconds before the end
The outcome was a win win tho either ksi beat Tommy or we get ksi vs Jake so plz make ksi vs Jake now
HES BACKK 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hi
You win some you lose some bro shit happens its tuff, be better be stronger
we don't care about u loosing tbh u did bits lol remember when u fought Joe to go to this is mad
This is what happens when you pretend to be something you ain't.  my advice is stick to what you are good at and enjoy. who cares what others think.
Bro did not break the curse💀
missed the giggles. Also, absolutely lovve the fact that you went on holiday with the fam - great to see you reconnect. you’re a cool dude and you’ve grown so much. Really inspirational ⭐️
Bringing up kids and the lady is out of line.
You definitely shocked the world
My G ❤
Thank you JJ for showing me exactly how not to take a loss. I promise you I will ensure I never let my ego get to my head like you.
He had the confidence, just not the delivery.
good to see you back jj hope you've found clarity ❤
So when is next try not laugh 😂(obviously not the money giving part)
Reality Check Buddy but you did your best
Ksi my guy I don't really give a shit about ur loss? Or win its really confusing
The fight was dogshit it should've been a draw
❤
Nah icl 2k comments in 17mins is crazy
We love u jj glad to see u back
Are you boxing again tho
You lost no worries bro, you still a champ
Broo just deal with it you lost man
after one month you come out and say ur sorry. that's what i feel is annoying. personally i would have said what i want before and keep it at that
yes jj
Stick to your INFLUENCER fighting and leave Boxing to the real men
You hugged him most of the time. You can’t be mad about the result.
W KSI
In islam we wake up at 6 in the morning to pray to god ,we wake up at dawn to pray to god , we fear god and we fear hell and we fear the punishment of god.
We all known, Tommy was the professional, he was supposed to win so they prob had more bias towards him. Simply because he needed to win that fight. He had so much/ waaay more to lose.
THE RETURN OF THE KING!!!!!!!!!!!!
“The judges took that moment away from you” bro they’re your judges. They literally covered up the fact you elbowed Joe Fournier. You lost plain and simple be a man and accept it
welcome back G
Manny Pacman felt the same when this happened to him
Shouldn't have said the cursed words... he played with fire and got burnt cause of it.
It was his tattoos!!! KSI + L Why do this?! :(
takes an L proceeds to diss the man's family life, real classy JJ.
Weak character for you to make comments on his kid and his role as a father.
hard to sympathize with you after all the pre-fight rant
Hey guys!! We all love ksi I get it but how are you supporting this video, like a really man should acknowledge his oppenent and don't just sit and make fun. Isn't he doing the same things as jake. Really I am disappointed 😔
L video wth, 9 minutes of coping and telling people to harass Tommy everywhere
KSI you lost the fight bro just get over it appeal and everything
not the biggest fan on tommy but i dont think you won. wasnt his best performence thats for sure. but id be suprised if the appeal goes thrue
Jj we love you so much man❤
Clinch Merchant
COMMON KSI W honestly just speaking facts take a good break king u deserve it
Bro lost once and went on a soul searching journey
This man will never understand the meaning of humble 🤦‍♂️ I know all of his fans will continue to two hand slurp him, but eventually he and the rest of his fans need to accept the fact that he lost fair and square.
No matter what KSI siyohlezi sikuthanda ❤️
No chance you won the fight. People saying tommy lost is because he didnt knock you out thats why, tommy is trash but he still obviously won, but hey if im wrong im sure your appeal will be overturned... or not 😂😂😂😂
just accept the loss bro and its all good
You was robbed
guy youre gonna lose to ishowmeat
Guess who's back, back again. JJ's back, go tell a friend *creepy follabi laugh*.
FINALLY AFTER 2 MONTHS JJ YOU CAME BACK took you so long🥊
I’ve been watching you for over 9 years now and seeing you succeed makes us smile since you’ve started from making fifa videos to having the biggest fight of Tommy fury’s life and yes it really was RIGGED that you should won but having to see this from the ground was the greatest thing ever made keep grinding jj and yeah the next fight will be better   Stay humble and just do what you’ve been doing
You got robbed   The fury’s robbed 2 people in the span of a month
Your a g man get back into the grind chin up hands up roll on next fight
been waiting for this upload to come every day since
Tbh none of you won the fight. Both of you fought like crap. But at the end of the day what really matters is to know how hard you worked and how you dedicated yourself. And we saw it, you really did. Don’t let loss get to you (you already did but whatever lol).
You won king no matter anyone says your a warrior ❤️
Missed you JJ ❤
we still proud of JJ.❤❤❤❤❤❤
that was the biggest 9 minute yap session i’ve ever witnessed
Being honest here and I really like jj, but for real, jj was just hugging. Cause he’s won his last fights before tommy he can’t take it
But ksi ain’t the goat smh
You know you won when even your biggest opp is saying you won😭
I already forgot, no big deal brother.
You lost bum
This video felt like a throwback to your whole journey basically, the way you have tackled all the hurdles in life and grown massively. We as your fans will always support you no matter what comes. The King Is Back ladies and gentlemen! Stay strong and keep hustling❤
You won forsure the judges couldnt handle a youtube beating a boxer. They did the same thing to Nagannu
Bro there is no way you lost bro, those were illegal shots he took on you to the back of the head. If he wins the case, I’m never watching again.
Not lost battered you L back to the basement
I accept your apology JJ
LAUGHING AT: KSI
when the judges actually judge the fight but its not in his favor.. KSI: This is completely unacceptable
Real ones know who the winner is
This is ur third L First the fight Then the appeal And then this video I hear mams is progressing into ksis 4th L trying to reappeal or something
Tommy fury made you cry pretty much 😂
This mf said I lost 1month ago
your amazing 👊 😎 brother
When we needed him the most, he returned!
After you post I am gonna shock the world. This was inevitable.
Tommy ass all that shit he said about YouTuber yet cant knock ksi out
Lol L, im glad u lost.. someone needed to bring ur ego down a bit and im saying this as a fan
Lol you lost blud
happy you lost lol
Jake Paul took the loss better than you
Idc care what others say. When Mighty Mouse says Ksi won. Ksi won.
Good to see you back champ you didn’t loose that fight
You lost man take it like man and move on
THE RETURN OF THE KING!!!!!!!!!!!!
we love you my G
tommy cant knock out a wank, let alone any opponent
the meat riding is crazy
Tommy fury sent you to a mini retirement 😂
we love you JJ ❤️
God KSI
I can't speak for everyone but i aslo believe jj won that fight was rigged and although jj didn't take it well he did process and as long he has  his supporters  that's better than having a belt to show it that's the best sign of winning ever so my advice to you jj just keep going those my words that i live by and teansfer to you
I love KSI and all but going after how Tommy is parenting is a bit too far just for a meaningless fight, jj really should know where to draw the line, and i dont go at me saying "tOmMy fUrY dIcKrIdEr", i firmly believe that jj won that fight and i never even heard about that bloke until like a week before the fight
16.3 M subscribers in here alone so yea there will be alot of biased glazing. if you were a girl we would call it simping dont let it boost your ego, that's why the loss was as tough as it was compared to if you were just humble about it.
We see you on the sidemen reaction Chanel. idk why it took so long for you to realize
We all knew you one. Like you said , its cosnhes a boxer ,the fight was fixed. YOU WON
❤❤❤
Take your time but tell us about the fight with jake
You won JJ
THE GOOAAAAAT!!! we know you won bro, we don't care abt these random delusional people and I'm so happy to see you happy and healthy again. love you fam.
U finally woke up from ur misery after loosing. Either way (I am the nightmare) Hopefully u don't become a fatneek now
I knew you would lose but still proud of u
it’s that goddamn “SHOCK THE WORLD” video brooo FFFUCKCKKK
Guys I think he might be a sore loser...
Stay strong man, you did your best. We proud of how far you’ve come. ❤
Cry for KSI button 😢   👇
overhand rights into a clinch doesn't mean you won
It's amazing that JJ still can't take the loss with grace. Going so far as to go after Tommy personally and talking shit about his relationship. Fucking dickhead behavior.  There has barely any progression torwards the better in his boxing since LP.  He just didn't deserve the win, a draw at most.
Big proud bro thank you for all the great memories ❤🎉
KSI had a great year he’s done so much in just a single year. The “loss” to Tommy doesn’t tarnish that at all
I'm just glad your back tbh ❤
Im still a fan my boi always will be, and you knew what was coming after you lost😂😂i knew this video would take a min to upload, but my boi i was disappointed in the defense u had that fight i truly felt you didnt do as good as u have in ur past fights
Good to have u back. True supporters will stand by u no matter what we love u jj ❤️
JJ, you are an inspiration❤
L lost bro said i will win 🤣
Yes, you lost.
Pfft. Who cares about the L. This fight gonna be forgotten about after you fight Jake anyway 😂
his event, his judges and he still think he was robbed haha L man did only star jumps and hug. count the number of times u hit someone in the back head vs Logan, Fournier, Swampz and pinata. hypocrite.
My body has never released the amount of dopamine that it did just now. Happy to have you back🫡❤️
He’s been gone for so long I forgot about him 😂
KSI stands now for Klutz, Sucking and Immaturity.  You lost against Chad Fury, you yapping childish Fatneek.
BRO IS WAFFLING ABOUT TOMMY 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
Just be friends ❤
I liked my own comment
LOMMY LURY XD
Finally
dont worry jj u dint lose , everyone who watched the fight did.
Get ksi vs jake paul  on winner get tommy fury rematch
We dont care that you lost jj, you will allways be our winner🥇
Who cares how you feel? You still lost.
the goat posted.
Im glad jj is bring real with us. Some people try to make it seem like nothing actually happened and moved on, but hes showing his frustration and that he needs to take a break. U a real one, JJ. Glad ur back on ur channel
My G! Win, loose or draw I’d always be by your side! As I’m getting older, I’ve realised that we’re all getting older *together*
I feel like he bribed the judges😂😂😂
Don't worry about it JJ. You'll bounce back. By the looks of it, you already have
lil max kid- "wow original"
We'll always be here to support you bro.  Love❤
Glad to have you back mate
4:49 no one telling you to box these other boxers? tho we just wanted you to fight jake pual and you still can’t do 😪
We NEED one more fight, and that fight is You vs Jake Paul 🥊
You won JJ, we all think you did, were alwya shere for you man ❤
‘It wasn’t fair’ 😂 you lost mate. It was a unanimous decision
First fortnite chapter 5 and now jj is posting again... its a good day
You won in our hearts
Ksi bs Jake Paul finna be crazy
He didnt win sh!t all he did was hug and throw them ugly azz hooks 😂 he’s ass fr
At last
Good that you are back bro
Stop the cap
He’s back
Keep ur head Up. And we'll come back better and stronger 💪 ❤
Ksi won. No matter what tommy furry has to live with the fact that he barley made it out with a win by a YouTuber
Tommy fury killed influencer boxing. And that’s a fact
Looking forward to a new album now 💪🏻
Guys I don't think I heard him correctly but ddi he lose ?
A real people's champ💪  I genuinely prayed when I got the notification that he has uploaded😂❤
Good to see JJ back ❤❤❤
Logan glazing
1:47 Wow, I didn’t even know this from Jake Paul. And the fact he deleted it just shows that he’s trying to hide his insecurity. Classic coward.
booo hooo loser
HAHAHAH all the talk no bite.. KEEP TALKING SHIITEEEE
Did he forget h had almost year of rest in lockdown 😂  Anyway he achieved a lot and pushing himself too hard he need to chill and enjoy the game
Yes shit fight. Imo Tommy won but thats whatever. But holy shit JJ is huffing so much copium in this video its embarrassing.
PLAY AMONG US
Ksi you have motivated me so much to accomplish all of my goals and all of my visions in my life, big ups bro 🙏
I understand being pissed about losing but why do you feel the need to tell your fans to remind Tommy Fury that he didn't win and "berate" him? You appealed and you still haven't gotten a response so technically you still lost. Unnecessary in my opinion.
JJ Oliloseji
It's actually shameful how childish you've become.. Even if dozens of people thought you won, theres still dozens that thought you lost. As well as you "Kicking" the wall after you lost acting like a complete child. You didnt win the fight, and for someone that I thought was professional, you sure as hell dont act like it after all these months. Not to mention Tommy actually out-struck you, so you saying you did better than him is just another false lie. Just because all your fans say you "Won" does not mean you won. How do you think fighting would go if we just let everyone vote who won? It would basically be a popularity contest, so that's just a bullshit arguement.
Sending positive energy, much love from Sweden 🇸🇪 ❤
I thought he ll react to some reddit post at last 😗
He’s back 🎉
So glad to see JJ back. You won that fight in most ppls eyes 💪🏾
but you lost tho
Nah bro the fight was shit, one of the worst foghts ive ever seen and u lost for sure
Remember that your a king we don’t care if you lost or won your still Lord-Ksi 😂💪🏽
Ksi but hurt 😂
All u dig was hug mate you lost
aw i miss ksi vids
Imo JJ you’re taking this whole situation the best you can keep your head up because we’re all here for you ❤
You are still the king you were before you “ lost “ the fight 💯
He sounds like deji ahaha WHAT a Big Big L 😂😂😂😂 little cry baby haah
Bro we love you but you being a sore loser right now frfr
we know u won ur better than him .. keep ur head up and keep going bro
keep your head up JJ
Tommy fury what ever he is in South Africa's eyes he is a big poes
tbh the fact that your own fight and the Tyson fury fight were both rigged , I think it says something lmao
Just quit boxing that shyt was embarrassing 😂😂😂
Who remembers when ksi left yt for almost a year
Head up man. You won in our eyes.
Lol 10 mins of cryathlon 😂😂😂😂
getting into the fuckin' ring is a win itself
You won in our eyes jj
Love you JJ keep your head up king
JJ man the fight is in the past, there is no need to keep on mentioning Tommy. You’re better than this
Am just happy to just seeing u 😂 😂
Okay just give us a reddit video
Don't worry KSI men from love island are over confident c#_ts just Knock out the next one instead Lol
I love this video man. You’re actually a nice guy and such a hard working person. The last ten seconds of this video summarise you as a person perfectly. Love from The Netherlands and probably all around the world, JJ!
Love you JJ! Keep kickin' ass!
LSI 😂
It’s been a year daddy I really really miss you mommy said u left with the milk
He sounds like a sore loser
keep going jj as unprofessional boxer you fought better than tomy for sure you got robbed we need a rematch of that game again
Excuse after excuse, that ego f'ed u up
match was rigged, change my mind.
i love gaysi. he need to keep his head up
10 minutes ago and a new Sidemen Sunday? The day has instantly become better
It's good to have you back my man ❤❤
Have a rematch jj
Guyss striaght up, this man is full of himself and all of this is bullshit.
Bro's baaaaaaacccckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk....................🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
Good job on the video Mo
You’ll always be the best regardless of who you beat or dont beat. The Furies just keep leaning towards the Judges and begging them for a win.. well THEY AINT SHIT. Ngannou won, you won, plain and simple.
The entire fight was a big L lol. Would have rather watch paint dry.
Holy crap about time he stop being a pussy and dropping a video!! Love you jj
🤣
Doesn't matter jj we still love you ❤
No bro you earned the time. You're a beast. #tommyfurylost
ksi was clearly robbed
It was hugging contest to be honest
Take the fat L 😂😂😂
Was for sure a loss, karate venon page style isn’t gonna make you win a points decision against a boxer. Fair play for stepping in the ring regardless
You better pay me my 50£ that I lost on you
BROS SO SALTY LOL
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 jit thought he actually won 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
We thank you ❤
Didn’t feel like making a video 😂. Legend
U lost m8 quit crying
It’s just crazy how he finnaly got put down and was humbled, but still didn’t feel how he should feel, it wasn’t he lost, he lost and shouldn’t still be happy, his haters should’ve done more
i missed you pal and i dont care if you lost
Am proud of you FatNeek🎉❤
Keep ur head up jj❤❤
When are u doing one question go
Jj, whether you won or lost, that was the worst display of boxing at that level that I have ever seen. Glad that you're back, you still won that fight and keep your head up 💯
You won
Your boxing is embarrassing and an insult to the sport. It's not impressive in the slightest.
🙌
Ksi won
JJ you slapped Tommy he defo paid the judges you probably could of dropped him
Okay so I’m confused, I saw a tweet from the pba saying they won’t overturn it but ksi basically said the appeal isn’t done yet
We don’t care about the loss. The grind and consistency is all we need don’t push too hard. DON’T LET THIS STOP U FROM BEING COCKY AND CONFIDENT😊
And Francis Nganou emberesed tyson fury and tyson won because of his last name
i dont watch boxing, but I saw that fight, and Tommy did not win at all. It was a 50/50 but thats pushing it at best
Yo yo he finally showed up
Missed you JJ. Tommy probably "won" by 1 point, but we will always be proud. Keep on rockin'. 💪🏿
You won in the worlds eyes jj, judges were on bullshit.
😂😂😂
Just upload man
He was robbed!!
woo
💜
So many excuses
Yo JJ thanks for making me believe in myself. I know you did not get the result you wanted but from where you come from life has been a win for you! I am going to remind myself from time to time that I can believe in myself and do incredible things
Dude FINALLY got the balls to make a video after taking an L. My respect to you has finally returned.
We missed you jj
It's ur boi KSI olajidebt only OGs can like
FUCKING TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH BROOOOOOOOOOOOO
I didn’t even hear about Tommy trying to fight a 54-year old. Shows how no one cares unless he’s fighting a youtuber.
I cant wait for music JJ again.
JJ I just watched it. I really do think that you won. That was BS. I watch all of your fights and this one is the most rigged out of all of them hit you in the back of the head multiple times Tommy fury. It’s just stupid and scared of you
We got JJ taking a L before GTA 6 💀
Damn
Make us laugh bro, you still a legend and we respect that🙋
L Tommy
Doesn't matter win or lose, it's the friends you make, it's the road you choose
yeah king
Jake Paul fight???
It’s nice that KSI hugged Tommy Fury a lot in this fight to make up for the hugs he missed from his dad.
I feel like he's basically telling his whole life as a youtuber lol
something has been fishy about the last few fights from the furys..
Lower Prime prices in Croatia pls I wanna try it its 10euros here
I'm a jj fan but good L I'm glad he lost he got humbled
Lmfao it took you 1 month to realise that you lost? 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
With all due respect jj that wasn't a fight that was a hugging match
Only excuses in the video lol
we missed you jj❤
IF KSI HAS TURNED TO GOD BEFORE THE FIGHT WITH FURY AND AVOIDED TATTOOS AND REPENTED TO ALLAH HE WOULDVE WON! END OF DISCUSSION
You were robbed
Thankgod, this brudh got humbled now, please ksi bring your ego down now, and stop making excuses you lost thats it
Imagine losing 😹😹😹😹
Such a sore loser
Jj lost so hard he has to send targeted harassment towards Tommy. You probably won that fight but everyone knows you’d rather be in tommys shoes rn
I feel like this video was required and people needed to know how much JJ has done non stop over the years with boxing, music, his channels, Sidemen, Prime etc.  A burn out for him is just totally normal and it felt good to see him give all this explanation to us. Keep going JJ! We'll always support you ❤.
JJ i thought this would be a really good stepping stone for u to mentally develop but ur still immature and still trying to bring down others even though they won. Think about this maturly and just move on
Petition to get jj to become fat again
yooo
How much time will it take to get the response?  I want to know if he won
Win or lose the transformation and growth ksi had made is nothing short of inspirational. Ksi is the epitome of taking risks and why in order to succeed in life you need to take risks. People that hate on this are the people who will achieve nothing in life
We love you JJ. You lost the fight but you proved to everyone that you can achieve everything with hard work❤️
Sending hugs like you did with Tommy 🤗
I love how KSI just ignores that he also hit tommy on the back of the head multiple times 💀
Your hard work did show results
WSI
It's alright man, life is all about the ups and downs. You'll get right back up in no time.
bruh just accept the loss
Mo finally getting paid😅
Kai and Logan in WWE tag team belts ❤❤❤❤
Make Tommy Fury fight Viddal Riley.
Sorry JJ but you're boasting. You lost admit it. We love the real KSI. We don't want an immature Youtuber
HUMBELD!
We Honestly forgot about the L dawg 😂😂😂
Work on your form and technique pls bro. All u do are haymakers😭
I don't believe you won, but you did way better than I expected well done
I had forgotten that you fought lol
Even tho you lost, we are proud of you❤
LSI making excuses
2:33 True.
knew it
Love u jj
Its kind of strange especially because Ngannou should also won the fight against Tyson Fury. Boxing is just a dirty sport.
Box Jake Paul my guy
common bro we love u and all but stop giving excuses bruh u lost accept it
Well, as we know Fury's always win.
Brother this video is so toxic man. Need to be humble in defeat. You even told your brother this when he made a diss track AFTER HIS WIN. I also think you won the fight but come on, JJ. This video ain't it.
Bro lost
keep on boxing bruv am sure youll win the next one
Sore loser
Better be careful cuz that bit towards the end could get you in trouble with youtube
Pls make dbl videos😊😊
Stay strong JJ❤
U still the GOAT innit💪🏽 All love JJ❤️
W ksi
OUR CHAMP!
mans ego is so fucked, bro you done more than anyone would have expected. Please be more humble bro, yeah tommy is a bitch tho
We know you worked hard dude will allways support and you deserved a break
KSI You won in our eyes. Stay positive be strong .
Yes you clearly lost All what you did was hug.
Good job Jj, I’m glad you posted ❤ Takes some serious guts and dedication.
L video
It is what it is
KSI You Won Regardless, much love KSI,
JJ, you won in my point of view.
JJ we missed you man
🐐
EEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Bro wants the rematch so bad
Almost forgot about this
Haha ksi targetting tommy's personal life feels like they are gonna have a rematch after the jake paul re
The Boy Is Back!
Did tommy did win tho?
Jj if we think you one you won.  My personal opinion the fury family is probably paying off judges both brothers winning upsets I like 3 weeks time
missed you bro!
No one cares about the loss mein at the end of the day is just a number. U did ur self proud man. The streets know u won.
Pls make db videos😊
Happy JJ is in a good headspace honestly. Great mindset
you lost stop crying
100% robbed for sure
After hearing this my conclusion is.... BINOD😂😅 (Only Indians gonna know)
Still lost
Happy too see ksi on the main channel . I believe that ksi won the fight 🎉 L the judges
Love you JJ❤
Jj the biggest hater and I love it 😂
Shocked the world , he’s been breaking boundaries since he decided to start yt and I respect JJ more than ever after that tommy fight!
The appeal is still ongoing???? What are they even doing?
Bro💀
Don't worry ksi it is written in your legacy to loose the fight against Tommy this sacrifice has to be made to win against Jake
Bruh you ran alot
GOAT
Take ur time g❤
Please fight Jake then take a rest that what everyone wants
This is exactly why I wasn't complaining I was the same when is the next video going to come out when is he going to do this when is he going to do that dude this man since I don't know probably 2012 2010 he's been uploading many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many videos what do you guys complain if he doesn't upload he has uploaded so much videos that it may not interest you but he does it he did it and he's going to keep making videos until the day he stops we love you KSI
Keep ur head up man, everyone knows u won.
Who cares if you loss you went from a nerd in his parents basement to our favourite YouTuber ❤ keep your head up g
That fake laugh from JJ😅
*ask a rematch or accept your lost !*
SO I LOST😅🙃 hopefully fight humble him a bit.
finaly!!!!!!! a video!!!!!
We missed you man
now is the jake paul vs ksi  fight going to happen?
Don't worry JJ, if anything it adds up to your legacy. Just take a good break and stand up even stronger than you were before 💪. it's just the beginning and no matter what happens we are always with you ❤
Finally he’s back, don’t worry if you didn’t win JJ ❤️
Nah m8 that wasnt a fight. That was a hugging match.
you may have lost the battle but you will win the war. Get back in the gym and grind
6 rounds and you bounced on your feet like MVP. This isn't MMA. You didn't box, you can't box.
I LOVE YOU XO
Yes Tommy struggled of course, you wasn’t fucking boxing, he went in there to box a boxer in a boxing match you didn’t box.
Missed u JJ love u a lot ❤We all know the hardwork u did for boxing Sidemen PRIME everything
I've been watching ksi since like 8 years ago we don't care that you lost we are proud of you for training and putting in 100 percent to what you love but I would say and idk really about boxing but the hugging was a lot you hugged and hugged a whole lot that fight but either way win or loss we are proud of you
Yea u did 😬
We still love you champ! ❤
The fight was underwhelming asf ngl
I'D LIKE TO MAKE MYSELF BELIIIIIIIIEEEEEEVE, THAT PLANET EARRRTTHH TURNNNNN SLOOOOOOOWWWLLYYYYYY
Love the comment section here so positive and so much love and support here ❤❤❤
You know it's bad when your biggest hater thinks you should've won the fight the refs was on some bs🤦
Only true ksi can like this video 🤓
Ishowspeed next
This video is kinda sad
He finally remembered his YouTube password
Bro took this long
Oh boy
Even if you lost I still think you are the winner to me
It’s sad that Tommy fury can’t knockout 2 YouTubers even though he was boxing when he was 6 years old
Justice for KSI
Keep strong 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
man fucking hell felt like a year.
7:35 this is really wrong jj 7:55 , u can’t tell ur fans to bully others for ur ego , really dissatisfied and disappointed, ur ego is so high that u start to really beacame so unlikeable 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
And when is he making more music ??
That loss is a small step, all the greats except a few lost and came back better, just continue to work on and improve your boxing.
Boiii the trash talking didn’t stop 😂😂😂
JJ we dont care if u lose I personally dont give a shit we just want our fatneek back making us laugh plz come back full time
We love you JJ Win or lose❤❤❤
If you’ve played any sport especially and individual one like boxing athletics etc, you will know how hard the training is as you go through it alone and the anxiety leading up to the date of competition knowing only u can bail urself out . One way to clear that anxiety feeling in sports especially individual ones is Ego and weather they show it or not on camera every big athlete has an ego and considering JJ is used to sharing everything with us he didn’t hide his ego from us which I like. When it comes to boxing unlike other individual sports like athletics ur faith can be decided by other people and I think it just hit him at one go and he was able or trained on how to control his emotion. Still proud of him cuz it was clear he isn’t athletically gifted and isn’t blessed with high ring IQ he went toe to toe with a ranked boxer based off hard work and I respect that 100 percent
Ksi I think you won
You learn more from the losses than the wins and thats facts 💯
Neither man won. That fight was dead. It was you lunging in with overhands expecting to land, and then clinches happened to stop the action. Instead of trying to argue a point deduction, try to work on your technique, as whatever that style is, it has a ceiling when it comes to the realm of professional boxing. This fight right here showed that that style capped at the certain point.
Yes
Respectfully, even if this somehow gets turned around, you have no reason to be flattered or even happy about the win. Both of you were awful and half the people in the video stated that you’d win via Fury’s point deduction. KSI, I’ve been a diligent fan for years, but you need to own up and take responsibility
ksi vs jake paul 2024 o2 arena london april
I’ve been waiting for this please say he’s back to uploading properly
THE GOAT IS BACK 🔥
We miss you.
Love you man ❤️
u got robbed  but boxing is bullshit anyways cause tommy barely did shit
youre washed up admit it
finally. a video from JJ. it's been 2 months wtf
look who's back
sore loser
Love this maturity from jj
Omg 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Jj will never succeed in boxing with his mentality reacting like he did
Idc if ksi lost. I'm just happy he could have a bit of a break and make sure his mental health is okay
I was worried you were going to go back to the 4 month absence thing 😂 but if you did I’d understand JJ. You’ve worked so hard these past years. But you’re back now… so great 😅❤
YOU ARE THE GOAT 🐐
Ksi should have won but it is what it is so just move on to jake paul we been waiting for it since 2018
Like, just hearing him talk is entertainment. Have we been addicted to him that much? A monologue from him makes me happy than many other things that I've faced throughout the day.
We’re still proud of you JJ, no matter what keep thriving dude!
We know it’s rigged same as the Fury vs Ngannou fight.
Mr. Nightmare has returned to penetrate us profusely with hard bulging content🔥
Head up King we are with you regardless winning or losing ❤
The fury’s ARE JUST ROBBERS bro 😅it’s like they’re r messi BEING niced OR GETTING SUCKED OFF FOR SOME MONEY this year has been tough man and the Tyson fury vs ngannu, and the ballon dor and my sister passed away this year, wow this year has been worst than 2022 and the thousands  of Palestinians dying wow
Bro we missed you😢
U won the match the whole world knows it even his own brother knew it
U can’t box at all, u were hugging him the whole time 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Thought it was fairly close, but you lost. Don't see what you did to win it (either).
❤finally bro remembered us
yo KSI uploaded! Lilmaxkid just came rn      In all seriousness glad your back JJ
Bros ego is so big, it takes him weeks to deal with a loss. Thats wild. Real men get up, brush the dust off, wipe the tears, and get back in.
5:52 fax
"so i lost?" yes...yes you did🤣
Like if you've missed KSI videos
Just do regular boxing n stick to that instead of learning boxing from mma guys n jumping up n down cuz that’s not gone win u the fight even viddal said that if u would switch up ur style u could have knock him out or down so yeah get boxing coaches not mma coaches u would be more than a beast
Have been missing these videos. Jj you still our guy regardless!
5:26 genuinely thou he think he’s a future world champion😂
My goat ❤❤
Jj won the fight
KSI honestly it’s because you were having too much of an ego and didn’t even consider Tommy to be anything but a rock on earth that you had to break, your true supporters don’t care if you lose or win and you almost won, take that as the W.
No need to belittle others. Accept the loss, learn, and grow. Harassing Tommy Fury over the judges' decision won't change anything. Move forward with sportsmanship.
family photos were so nice😭
I've been waiting for this one
I think he won tbh
STILL CRYING
all you did in the fight was hugging ksi, you hit and if you miss you hug him, that`s not real boxing you lost fairly ksi, i wanted you to win honestly
38k in 5mins😮
It’s about damn time
I love you dude<3
You always doing MADNESS!! We’re so proud of you! Making the impossible possible 🙏
I feel you bro
Seeing you along with Francis  Ngannou losing to the Furys goes to show how corrupted boxing is especially the PBA. I'm not trying to fanboy KSI or Frances here, I'm just saying both Tyson and Tommy DO NOT deserve the win and they literally robbed both of you.
Ksi is 30years old but he keeps saying its your boy ksi😂😂
You can’t win against the fury’s all of their hard fights are rigged for them to win
nigga i don’t care that you lost. you win some, you lose some, but, you live, you live to fight another day. get over it lil nigga, keep it pushing
Ksi lost because boxing is a dirty sport, and we clearly see that with Haney vs Lomachenko and Fury vs Ngannou where its so obvious that Lomachenko and Ngannou are the true winners, these promoters run the show clearly when they can
Yes, you did
THERAPY SESSION??????
YOU NEEDED THAT BREAK!  THATS ALSO GOOD FOR THE MINDSET NOT JUST CONSISTENCY
Don't worry jj❤
Good to see you back jj
Second
Just relax man chill with family and your other half have fun get a house with land lol just chill man get a kid lol live your life bro focus on you n family
I thought jj olatunji died
excuses
Womp womp
It was your mission and we supported you on it, you mean more to us man, you are the reason we will always support your wildest dreams, but, man we dont care that you lost, we care about you, be great in whatever you do man. 🥰
you won i dont care about the result you deserve it
I can't lie, I had little faith you would win this fight. I have always been a fan that respects you, but now that was proved to me that I will never doubt you again. You have constantly shown that you shouldn't be doubted and that fight was enough to convince me. I know I'm not near as reputable as any professional, but I also had you winning by 1 point when I scored it live.
🤡🤡🤓
Jake paul is way more mature is than this  30 year old child
This is just hypocritical, you made fun of Logan for losing the same way you did.
While it looks like the final verdict of the fight will still be the same, it just doesn't feel like an L for JJ. The fight was too close, the perception is that it should have been a draw or a win for him and he is still doing bits with Prime and Sidemen.  So keep going JJ, you're still killing it!
Jj did shock the world by kicking the screen after 😂😂
The problem is jj , after training soo much and trying to prove yourself and your ‘legacy’ you let all your boxing skills go to shit . What were those shots? Where was the defense? He landed those shots only because you had zero defense that’s how he won . Come on man after all this hype you only let yourself and your fans down. Hope you keep this in mind next time
🐐
I think we should all respect jj and if he needs his time then let him have his time. At the end of the day we always have those old videos that make us laugh that we can go back and watch
Is the same whit tyson fury ge also lost and won somehow
And the pfa will see that
Just take the L
Unlucky bro
JJ listen we just missed u okay🥺 i know that u won but at other side im  happy that the judges decided to bring you back to Us 😇cause now you can relax And enjoy life🤍 Much love for you, friends and your family
You might've "lost" by decision but you definitely won in our eyes.👏👏❤❤
Seeing the comments on Reddit and Twitter has been such a shame, i get confused where the line is from being a fan and ripping on JJ to being a yes man these days.  Seems like you can't support anyone without getting labeled as a 'yes man'.  But either way, the OGs are still here, you did absolutely amazing! Proud of you and can't wait to see what's next! ✊
Let’s all be honest here. Ksi won round 1, 2 and 6. Which means it was 3-3 plus the point deduction, ksi would’ve won…
u rlly got robbed man, glad you're back
ok loser
No sht.
It’s all good bro we love you
What a sour loser!
This man laughed at Logan, Jake, Wassabi, Deji, Fousey, Bryce and many others. You deserve it. And yes you CLEARLY LOST.
Bro went to a split decision ending with a pro boxer. 👏 we love you JJ
2017 being 5 years ago hurts 🤕
1:40 the American gangster
Konichiwa 😭😭🤣
Ksi I still think ur a great boxer win or lose
YOOO the legend has finally uploaded a video🔥
Is that a weed plant in your closet😮
"Outlanding him 3 of the 6 rounds"
Bro, fuck these judges, for them keeping your boxing posture perfect is more important than actually fighting.So, I think that is why you lost maybe. But very good fight enjoyed it a lot but result was disappointing.
Welcome back my boy
Bro didnt upload just incase the reddit is still cookin him
Wsi people's champion
But ksi won though 😂
Welcome back jj
Say it with me everyone ksi got robbed
HESSSSSSSSS BACK
wers the rage 😤
i think i speak for everyone that we will still appreciate you for what you are even with your loss, it was just weird how you took the L from an outside perspective.
Can’t believe I waited this long to hear you whine again. Why can’t you just be the bigger man and accept that you lost? All that shit you talked about Logan appealing is finally catching up, this is just karma. It’s been 2 months, if you really can’t see where you came up short by now then you will never accept a loss. You are a man who is too used to having yes-men around you, surround yourself with people who will tell you as it is.
be reyt
Lost is an understatement buddy.
Welcome back bro
We love you jj
Not a hater but the famous line of “ I don’t take L’s or I never lose “ is nutty
Yup u lost and here we thought you were gone for eternity, lost and annihilated forever from the existence of this planet.
😊🙌🏻❤️
bro lost cuz he black 💀👀
Failure is the first step to success!💪
Still a win for us 💪❤
You won
It’s only right for a laughing at JJ video 😂
Dillion Danis performance was the biggest robbery of the night towards the viewers, didn't even intend to throw punches, joke of a man.
Dude what are you on about “millions of people think I won” I’m subbed to you dude but that’s what I see, all I see absolutely everywhere is people dunking on you for hugging so much
Tbh if neither of you beat the other it’s a draw I think points are super subjective
Early yunooo
I'm a fan jj but you didn't win, draw at best but I hope you keep your head up despite the result
This vid mans is bein completely real, no matter what you think or how ya feel in the end you just gotta accept and move on when shit don’t go your way
❤️❤️❤️❤️
JJ is back
wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
We don’t care that you lost we just care that you did not upload Glad your back we happy bro
We don't care that you lost, JJ. We're glad that you're back and can't wait for you to dish out some more Ws. Love you, man
Next time bounce back harder! ❤
Finally, a KSI video 😭
We all hope you keep posting videos and make us laugh. Thanks for the show you put on.
NO WAY YOURE STILL CHATTING SHIT BRO JUST ACCEPT THE LOSS
JJ still da goat in my eyes WSI
Still a W in our books JJ, we always support you!
KSI finally back from his loss
We Know your the winner KSI. dont worry about it. . just enjoy what you have. :)
Atleast accept that you lost 🗿
Glad JJ.. Atleast your depression ended..
WASNT CANNCLED FOR THE JAPAN VID😂😂
so humble ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
it isn't u
Peace and Love bro Nothing else matters❤
Should of been a draw 💯 you’re still pretty sloppy bruv, keep it up and get that W. Run it back !!
Bro Got rigged by his Own Referee😂
we love you man keep your head up
Ksi won
Bro its still ok...being honest i kinda bet against you and won 35k. But it was still a great fight.
The real winners of this fight are those who didn't watch it.
I’m not a pro fighter, but one huge problem with your technique was your hands. Simply your hands being down caused lots of problems. If your hands were up you would have had a faster jab etc. If your hands were up you would have made tommy less comfortable with coming in and on the other side, you would have been more comfortable moving in because you had an actual defence. This is what I noticed about the fight... again not a pro so take my words with a grain of salt😅
Yes
missed this guy. its been a while eh man..
What a waste of 9:13 minutes
You definitely won it but you have to move on , beat jake and then happy days. Tyson also robbed ngannou
dis isn't jj fo real
You won that fight. Idc what those corrupt judges say.
Very disappointing fight bro
The fight was rigged
Sore loser ngl
Good job! Glad you’re back! Win or lose you did an amazing job!
finally you got out of your little shell and made a video !!
JJ PLEASEEEEEE RETURN TO BOXING PLEASEEEE fight slim bro wait that might be bad cos of weight… FIGHT JAKE PAUL PLEASE
You won in my eyes JJ, we are so proud of you.
KSI: I'm dead Inside JJ:meh
3:02 no wonder he can see John Cena
Jj you lost go fight Jake now please
Ksi u defenitely won
first
JJ the goat
Konnichiwa
think it’s time to fight jake unless you two are scared of eachother still ?
Your energy has been better in recent Sidemen vids
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bro, just accept the lost man. Im a fan and ima tell you how it is. Stop crying and just accept it. You lost fair and square, its not a robbery. 🤦
Lmaaaaaaoooooo loser 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 hold the l loser lmaaaaaaoooooo
As a KSI fan he acted like a child and a sore loser and did exactly what he clowned logan paul did for losing
We mess with u bro
Both you and Francis lost to the Fury bias by judges.
JJ why are you uploading this 2 minutes ago? I want this shit now! 😡 😤😤
A W or L, doesn't matter when the fight was dogshit. If you get knocked out, so be it. I just want to see 2 people fight in a ring.
Welcome back ksi ❤
Well no offence, but you did lose. Acting like you deserved to win by hugging? smh 🤦‍♂
Finally the big baby comes out of his cradle and doing a video...😅😅😅
JJ you did your best and I'm proud❤
Lol
You definitely won even though u hugged the whole game but the point should have been deducted and you really should’ve done
YOU LOST HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH
He’s back
GREAT TO SEE YOU BACK JJ!
But Tommy is better tho
You were robbed JJ 100%
finally u uploaded
What does it feel like your first lose L L L L
Video we all waited for
Bro this notification was the best thing that happened to me today!
ksi what flavour was the golden prime
Maybe if you were there to BOX and not just clinch and try to “look cool” (even though he looked lame and like an amateur) 😭 you would have won the fight.
Took this a month
You haven't lost in my eyes
damn.
Lmao he waited for his second result to post lmaooooo
Bro finally posted
So the curse wins again  “I will shock the world” 😂😂😢
We will always support you JJ, we love you and no matter what we’ll be by your side.      P.S. you won that fight anyways
Not first 😂
Fun fact:The fury’s are known for controversial wins aka paying off judges:)
It's been like more than a month omg I'd completely forgotten about it by now
Hey JJ! As a one  boxer to another, lemme tell you something. Maybe you shouldn't blame Tommy or blane the judges or blame whatever happened in the boxing ring. I suggest you use this as motivation to come back and knockout your opponent who beat you unfairly. Dont blame the judges, take the L like a man and conquer your limits.   Accept your defeat and move on. Thats what a real stoic man should do.
I think I coulda been the clinches but idk I thought you won or had a draw
IT TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH😅😅
:(
Blud finally gained the pride
Honestly the results dont matter to me. You showed the world that hard work and determination makes you a winner in the eyes of those who love and care about you ❤ 🔥
We love you JJ we missed you stay strong
Broo Really Lost
LMAOOOO YOU LOST 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Finally
Yes you lost
We still love you jj ❤
The YouTube 🐐 is back.
Doing star jumps doesn’t win u a fight
losing is a part of success, keep workin hard king
He's... alive!!
what did he lose i forget
WUZZZZZUPOPP BROOO WELCOME BACKKKK
If i would i get a nickle everytime KSI lost a fight. I would have 1 nickle
We love you JJ,no matter what we will continue to support you.Keep your head up and live life lavishly.❤🙏
Your fight with Tommy sucked bro. You hugged more then box. Fr
Good Thing Folabi replaced you in a Sidemen Video so you could take a break
Welcome back jj 🎉
Missed your fatneek as tho😂🥷🖤💯
It part of the journey in growing and getting stronger, but what matter is how you take the loss will you keep going forward or will you suck and cry over the loss.
Littlemaxkid will still support you don’t worry 😂
Look who finally decided to upload lmao
Wrong comment sorry guys😂
JJ L
Either way KSI showed that man up, I’m a gypsy myself and think ksi won
What matters is that you did your best man... Keep on doing what you are doing and most importantly don't give up 💪💪
It only been a minute and over 16k views and comments
Keep your head up my guy
Hahahahahah you lost you lost 😂😂😂 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
I thought the title of this video would be: "My appeal got denied" 💀💀
Dw ksi u still won to me you’re still undefeated in my books
Yes, you did.
I liked my own comment.
Yo I’m cool
aint no way this guy is still moaning over a month later just hold the L holy
Boxing is a shady business JJ.
Bro just wants that December cpm
you can't win a fight when you're clinching the whole time
At least KSI finally understands that fighting is rigged lol
Bloodclot
Bros ego is still through the roof
KSI keep your head up
No jj I know you try so hard
You need a Mexican coach. Ur uk coaches just sucks uk fighter just suck
U lost

More JJ in sidemen content and JJ taking a break from things to just focus in life is great ❤ We got you bro you deserve a break
I dislike my own comment
I still think KSI won man 😢
Jj, you did win the fight, the judges are just stupid
Noty
GOAT IS BACK ❤
Damn… bro lost nnn. It’s good you came out though. You’ll get them next time.

I’ve been waiting for this “So I lost?” Video for so long🤣 I knew it was bound to happen at some point the way bro was acting
nah a month is poor im sorry just take the L and move on not wait for the fight to fall out of relevancy
You won my man. Good to see you back g
Absolutely outrageous…. Just another example of someone being beaten abut still winning🤦‍♂️
Like this comment , if KSI won Fury ...
Unlucky JJ personally I believe u still won that but can’t do much now
I will say they made hime lost because they were racist

Its ok bro, we know you fight hard.
Unlucky bruv U know, we all know u did well and u deserved that win 😢 But this can be the motivation for you to do ur best no matter what the outcome might be Be proud u made it Much love bruv keep making us laugh😂❤
Ayyy!!! Welcome back JJ. 🙌🏼 we all knew you won that fight.

Your Silence is worst than your Loss bro, Win and loss are part of the game, keep your head up JJ
You done amazing JJ don’t let this bring you down ❤
took you too long jj
I’m glad that you came back, WE MISSED YOU JJ!!!
Shock the world curse continues
bro took his time
Mate. You do star jumps, hug and spam a haymaker all night, and you think you’re actually boxing? The fact that you lost is some form of justice for boxing.
Stay strong bro you won that fight
It was a tie
Lesson of the day don't play it safe and let it go to decision
No excuses  just improvement  to be made  you done well considering tommy boxed since he was 6 years old  apparently
I liked my own comment...🤓
No matter what sir we are all proud of you. You are the real winner. They needed to protect the fury name and was proven again after the ngannou fight. You’re the real champ, king!🐐👑
You lost now take it stop been a baby
Hope you're doing alright JJ, you of all people knows how to work with what they've got and keep going.
aw man, do you want a hug jj? 🫂
Logan went through the same thing karma😂
Jj you did a lot more in my book you won
All the greatest fighters at least lost once (except Floyd) but bounce back and learn from it 👍🏽
Blud you didn’t win
We are proud of you bro
Bro took a big L he decided to not upload 💀
I liked my own comment
L
Never thought I’d see this title
L’s are L’s. We grow from them. It was a robbery, but we can’t do anything about it at this point.
jj no 1 is gonna bully u you beet them just think about it ye we all love u
Can you just make us laugh and keep your personal issues to yourself?
This is what makes me so angry about you man your cocky asf and you just can’t admit it take your loss and move on man you lost you won the hugging/dancing contest you talk about Tommy hitting you in the back of the head but wtf about your elbow man oh don’t remember
not your boy your L taker💀💀 black worker shouldnt find their owners💀 crybaby💀
Finally he is back 🫡
It's ok jj we love you bro❤❤
Its okay JJ , U R our KING
Nah you definitely won, you threw many hug- punches!
In 2023 JJ Olatunji was the least consistent YouTuber on the platform 😁🤣🤣
Finally He has Returned 🎉
We’re proud of u
Missed you buddy always with you ❤no matter what
Jake vs KSI has to happen now 🙏
This isn’t Mo’s editing 🤔 unless he’s changed his style
Your fighting I thought was VALENTINES DAY  all you did was HUG....... fixed all about the REMATCH......
Boxing is rigged
We missed our monkey
took a minute xd
Now we need the fight that we all been waiting for KSI VS JAKE PAUL
Hope u r doing well JJ . I know you will stand up again and stronger Because that's what you have always done. And please don't ever  Comment "i am gonna shock the world" .i know you won't be able to see this under the literal thousand of comments, all wishing greater things to come your way
Use this loss to motivate yourself! Take all the energy and use it when training for Jake
iam so geld u posted agian we missed u
JJ don’t worry bro u won don’t think u lost blame the judges not urself🙌
Bro grow up, stop being a pilushover
You went toe to toe with a professional boxer, that in itself is enough to make us proud jj❤️🫶
Bro posted at the same time as Sidemen Sunday why💀
he’s back
Lol
he is back, fucking BACK! dont give up bro
I was the first viewer
You didn’t Tommy can’t box
Bro, your fight can't be called a fight, it was like 2 mice catching each other.
Yea that shit was fuckin stupid man. You totally won that fight! They robbed you man. Even the announcers thought you won for sure!!!
He didn’t actually do horrible his gameplan was good if he boxed he would’ve lost badly but the way he acted before and after made it bad for him I can’t blame people for hating
Jake Paul performed better, and you’ll easily get knocked out. You clinged the whole fight, and you suck. You let Tommy get a point deduction and still lost🤣🤣
Accept the defeat and stop crying
Bro really crediting the dog molester😂
take the L big boy
FINALLY JJ WELCOME BACK KING ❤
I never thought i woulčd see this day...JJ uploaded again!!
Finnaly bro like????
Only real KSI Fans are allowed to like this comment!  ---->

You need new trainers that style is horrible they gave you and go get real boxing coaches and you'll be a beast
Let’s go KSI
Jj you’ve won your true fans know you won 🙏🏽🙏🏽

Ok but can we still make fun of him regardless?
big ass forehead
He returned before gta 6 has been announced.
You won in our eyes 🎉❤
Wow after a month
Man finally built up the courage to come back 💀
how the fuck you have 106 rounds of sparring only to punch whilst you're in the clinch...why not throw jabs and hooks and fight with the same style you fought against logan rather than jumping in your place and wait for the clinch....you killed the fight with that no wonder why the judges picked tommy
You won that fr
Now Jake Paul vs KSI.. That should be it.
Just a joke
❤❤❤❤❤
It’s ok JJ, at the end the fans know who truly won. Hopefully you get to find peace after things like this, after all you deserve it.
❤❤
You're a beast, JJ❤❤❤
Bs you def won that fight
Whomp whomp cope jj
Wth 500 comments in 30s
