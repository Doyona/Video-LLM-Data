Amazing Apri/Fadia
Why do they allow men to play against women? Aren't there male and female leagues?
Woof woof 🐺
Have you ever heard my music experience i guarantee it is a wonderful experience that you will hardly forget 😘😍
Litteraly the most boring thing called sport. Females who would he beat by a teenage school boy.
Si thinah org india di triakin bhs china trus nick negara ny malay ngakak 😂
at 5:29 sounds like the commentator was yawning? Was he sleepy?
Keren
Good start
I really like the Indonesian pair.   Always smile even if the partner made a mistake
even though the combination of 2 countries has not been able to beat 1 country😂
WD but they play like MD.
Tan, lo tau gue nangis parahhhh😭😭 its so sad.
Awal yang baik semoga diberikan kemudahan dipertandingan selanjutnya... Good luck Siti Apri...
Warbiazah
Amazing play
Si bungsu Siti sdh mulai mantap.  Ini perjuangan yg luar biasa.
The commentator was harsh on the indonesian. I notice this in other matches as well, esp recently in santader wjc. He doesn't give agency to the players he doesn't like.
Set pertama deg degkan alhamdulilah menang, apri fadia semangat
Perlawanan luar biasa, ga nyangka ApFad bs bangkit come back stronger ckp cepat. Lawannya  seeded atas mrk semua semoga mrk bs main lepas tenang ga terburu2 .  Fokus & cerdas 💪
What happened to our Malaysian's Super Girls? SOB.......
Duo R Minionwaty! Ramadhanti often in hurry and Rahayu often wrong observing ball or making decision
permainan siti sudah kembali . Meski banyak poin dari kesalahan lawan tapi secara keseluruhan cukup menjanjikan . Semangat !!!
