Comment below with #Madden23 for a chance to win a Closed Beta Code!
3500+ animations is probably the biggest lie in this trailer lmao and that lie still holds up today...someone please count all the animations for me please
Matthew 5:3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Is this only next gen
Hypermotion xD
imagine being a ps4 player where they just give you madden 20
Fieldsense and hypermotion What more do you need
but after 23 years you still cant get the players joints to look right. offensive blockers are worthless
Im here after seeing more people than usual falling for the madden hype
Is field sense on Xbox series S as well?
This video didn't age well..
Worst catching team in this game is 100% the pats
No MADDEN CURSE THIS TIME CUZ Maddens dead. Wait Did he become the cover b4 or after his death🤨🧐🤔. The curse lives on
when are we getting a new EA rugby game
TO SWITCH PLEASE
ADD MADDEN 23
ID BUY IT PLEASE
ADD IT TO SWITCH PLEASE
ADD IT TO SWITCH
MADDEN ADD IT TO THE SWITCH
If anyone been playing madden long enough then you know that some of these are not new features 😂  they took some out 5 yrs or so ago and put them back as new 😂
Buzzword
Bring classsic teams to madden , lose X factors you shouldn’t need a X factor if u really good
No next gadvertising
Can we like get rid of gaudin and Davis and bring in Nantz and romo ? So I don’t have to mute my tv when I’m playing madden 7 even tho it says madden 23 🤷‍♂️
fieldsense doesnt change the game at all and just makes the game buggy
this game raises my blood pressure the ampunt of times the cpu lags and glitches through defenders, not to mention the amount of times players are running into other players
Did they fix the challenge flag for offline play?
Let's be honest. There really is only so much you can do with games like this. What exactly would you do to make it "fresh"? It's football 😂😆😂
This game sucks! You would think after all these years the interface and graphics would be more advanced by now!!! Same tackling style, cut style and same behavioral patterns!!! 😩😞
Please change the kickoff camera back.
Wasnt skill based passing already a thing in maden 17
Give up your license to make these games , they get worse every year and you expect your customers to pay for your underperforming product at increased prices. Please stop stealing people's money and go back to the basics or let somebody else take over and make an NFL game that is actually a playable game.
TRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASH!!!!
I hope yall fixed all of the glitches.  How is a running back talked three yards behind the line of scrimmage buy still advances for 4 yarsss!
The passing is the same lol. U could already do directional passing nd choosing to lob, back shoulder or throw a bullet.
The Madden Monopoly 😂
This game should just be called Madden Roster Update 23.  You’re a fool in you pay any amount of money 💰for this lazy development of a game with no competition in the marketplace.
EA SPORTS MADDEN IS GARBAGE YEAR AFTER YEAR!!   Save your money 💰 people!
Madden 23 is pure TRASH 🗑
'Madden NFL 23 team says "polish is our top priority"  Senior producer Clint Oldenburg discussed EA's confidence that Madden 23 "is going to be the most polished version of Madden that we've had in a long time."  Lies and manipulations. What a shame... and a sham.
garbage, as always :))
It's just flashes of 2D pictures drawn perspectively to look 3D.  Yeah, it takes talented artists to make it look real but it's never 3D.
Animation after animation after animation..it doesnt matter how good you play..its just all about animations.. your passing gets all over the place when you are facing a strong team in franchise mode..even the easiest of passes go elsewhere even if player is wide open..this is another way of making your opponent look strong for ea i guess
Got it yesterday 👍👌 it's like that solid 🪨💜💪 good 100 💯
Madden Sucks...has for a long time now.  It's not fun.  You can tell it's a money grab every year.
Worlds richest scammers
HOW CAN YOU MAKE A GAME THAT LOOKS WORSE THAN SEVERAL YEARS AGO!???  The developers of this game has to be completely without any sort of talent, except deceit.
Natural Famers Luv.
No next gen features on PC, when its 59.99, AND PC has more power so it means you could even do better than the ps5/series x version. completely unacceptable and this company should refund all PC players!
It would be nice to know that field senses is in old gen
Madden is still trash everyone is gonna go on utube n learn cheese plays from YouTubers
Does this mean they fix the most annoying thing in this game? Tripping on ur own blockers?
Look really good!! Can’t wait to get it
Now bring it to PC
Still have political bulls$it in the game. No thanks.
All I see is a bunch of people whining... You buy the game or you don't. There's a reason Madden games have no competition in creating football games, it isn't as easy to make the physics 100% real like most of you think. Besides, even if they were, then there'd be bunch of you complaining about only being able to score 10 points in a game. I mean, it never ends...
"EA Sports, this time its in the game..."
EA Sports should implement college playbooks into Madden so that QB' can be fun to play with and offenses can be exciting to watch and play with as well
Just give up ea and give 2k a chance

All the precision passing stuff besides free form has already been in the game. All they did was add a meter and a visual indication for ball placement. You could already to lob,touch,bullet  passes and you could also place the ball in certain areas by holding left right or down on the control stick. These are not new features.
This game is about as realistic as my chances of sleeping with Scarlett Johansson. The defense is literally in the backfield before you hike the ball and back up.
Yeah this game is absolutely awful. I’m glad I’m just using my 10 hour trial
This sucks
PC version has no next gen features. Absolutely pathetic EA.
Hey, at least we're getting advancements to Franchise mode.. Gave up on Madden YEARS ago because all they cared about was selling packs for BS mp... so it's a start, maybe..
Oh by the way, field sense is not available on anything but next gen consoles, which aren't really publicly available yet. That was a waste of a preorder!
2 bad field sense is not on PC nice EA
23 Madden games and they still don't get it. 😴 Bring back 2k football or at least College Football EA. We don't like this slow sim style. We want arcade style. Looks pretty but that's about it. They've come a long way since Madden on Sega Genesis 👊
I feel like the mocap does a disservice to the real life ferocity of the game. They're never gonna go full speed during those studio sessions. The hits look like they're hitting with pillows unfortunately. 😢
Its not on pc version
still sucks 😢
Man they need to bring back mini games!! Wr/db 1v1 was lit.
If you told me this is madden 15 I would believe it
If you plan on buying this game for PC please just save your money. Unless you want to give EA 60 bucks for just a roster update
I hope that’s the answer to stop those deep outside and inside crossing routes without sacrificing underneath routes and they need to bring back DB match up for you can put who ever you want on any WR or TE  to stop some of those elite players on offense that are already hard to stop
no effort  for pc as usual
I just hope the mid air tackles aren’t an every time thing. Like sometimes the reciever gets hit and still holds onto the ball
Bring back NFL2k. Until then I am not wasting my money on an NFL game.
I hope all the PC gamers boycott this game.
im still not buying this trash...u say new animations, im literally seeing the same animations from the last 10 years in this trailer
But what the soundtrack soundin like? 🧐
Not going to lie, this Madden looks promising. Definitely a big upgrade from 22.
CREATE A TEAM with CUSTOMIZATION PLEASE
How could they not include the biggest feature of the game on PC, but still charge the same price ?
NFL 2K5 still reigns supreme. Sad.
I really hope I can use field scense on PC with an xbox controller
I’ll look forward to it let Xbox gamepass get it free in like 5 months or weeks after release
How does the PC version, with the most powerful hardware available, NOT have this new physics/animation system?! Most people can’t even get the new consoles still, meanwhile, you can get anything you need to build a monster PC!
Anyone who still buys these are FOOLS
Can’t believe that Travis Kelce can drop a pass from being hit in the legs lmaoooooo
Boycott EA until they bring current gen to PC.
I love football and have $7000 PC. But something tells me that in 2023 I still would be playing Madden 08.
Amazing. A bunch of words that mean nothing🥱🥱🥱🥱
They need to add explosions..and fire coming out of their heels. Lightning and thunder depending if the reciever catches a catch or the db deflects it and streaking.
I just want refs man why did you take them away
So what’s new for people still on PS4
Ça sera aussi en français
So a rebranding of madden 13-25
The physics look soft again. Like just slow pushing animations to knock the ball out the ball carrier goes down like he didn't just get hit by a 300 lbs guy or 2 guys. Like football is violent not this soft gameplay.
The movement of the players looks like it has for the last 10 years. Let someone else make this game instead of you selling a roster update every year.
Game is a joke.  Buying the NFL liscense doesn't give you an excuse to be lazy programmers.  How lazy?  Too lazy to even add the refs.
"Just like Patrick Mahomes", who throws a backshoulder bullet pass to Travis Kelce who then morphs right through the cornerback for a 1st down completion.
This game looks worse than last year, and the year before that, and the year before that
3500 new animations?…ok…NAME THEM AND POINT THEM OUT ALL 3500 of them
They have to put lineman ball swatting and the o-line pushing them down that would be fire
Is this only for Next Gen? Or will PS4 players be able to use some of these features too?
I am excited for this. August 16th can't come soon enough. Really hyped for FieldSENSE. I feel bad for my PC gamers who are getting shafted once again with no new gen features.
ohhhweeee the ability to cut up a hole is a game changer
OK EA this is a step in the right direction I didnt even play Madden 2022 but this one looks promising
Tbh y’all should just make the movement madden 20s
Ah yes, receivers flinging the ball 10 yards during catches because their foot gets touched, I 'member! 🍇
im not messing w the graphics they give me madden 15 vibes
Finally defensive back face of the franchise
This guy's voice is almost cool
Check out the audience at 4:21 That's like mid-90's modelling.
Dear EA, please sell the NFL license so someone else can make a decent football game. You're an embarrassment.                                         With love,                                              90% of gamers
Aye madden if nothing else please atleast give us all time teams this year I wanna play as my favourite all time players without having to pay for them on ultimate team
Have you been listening madden?! Is this the madden I start?! Thank you! Skill based passing yessss!!!!
What about the QB fumbling? Cause I feel like you shouldn’t have to run out of bounds if you having a running qb
Look 1:1 like Madden 22! Copy Paste change the cover and number. Why people still buying this?
This is gonna be one of the worst maddens ever. I’m putting money on it
Bruh do something as simple as put animated refs on the sideline, then we’ll talk
Is field sense only on next gen?
Fans: We're sick of the game being animation dependent, when it should have a focus on actual physics instead.  Madden: So we added more animations...
Hear me out. I’ve been saying this for about 7 years but I think this madden might actually be different.
Showed my dad this and he was really surprised with the photorealistic graphics!!
The 360 cuts and enhanced LB play are welcome additions. Anyway I’ll be in practice mode for a few hours or more; no shame in that.
Not gonna Lie this is the madden ve probably being the most hyped probably in 10 years
Bruh 😂😂 y’all are trying but this ain’t helping one bit
Where the refs
They should add on those tackles where the defensive linemen just grabs the QB by the jersey and slings then to the ground like a rag doll. That would be cool 😎 or the ability to knock the players helmet ⛑️ off like in blitz back in the day.
Lol Yea Yea, What Are The Pursuit Angles Like! 🙄
This is very disrespectful to the legacy of the great John Madden. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
They always do an amazing job getting Madden fans pumped up to play the game but it's gonna be a flop it's football you can only do so much with Madden if they really want to see a big change let 2k takeover and I guarantee you will see amazing results
But why is PC not getting Next Gen features... Thats ridiculous. I wanted to buy Madden so bad this year and reading that just took all the enthusiasm out of me.
I saw all the same animations they’ve been using lol
I feel like people are Being too critical, it’s harder to develop a game, or even a feature than you think
Yooooo, madden 18 looks sick this year! 😱
It's only a video game has never been without flaws just enjoy it
I refuse to buy madden until the ref's are back on the field
I dont understand how NFL can`t share the license. Imagine 2k back or even Konami..
Bring back 2k football
Why don't they fix the injuries there a joke, can't tell what they hurt don't have a cart for a bad injuries,  love real life injuries
Looks the same…………
Skill based passing aka Precision passing🤦🏽‍♂️  Like they’re not even trying to innovate or improve!
This game looks cheeks bro, EA is so trash please give it up. Y’all can’t do anything right , freaking bums man
Passing hasn’t been good since Madden 09 on the PS2 pretty sad 🤷🏾‍♂️ now let’s see if it actually works because they will still have to implement the ratings the correct way a 70 rated Qb shouldn’t pass like a 99 Mahomes
Literally looks like ‘22. For gods sake NFL share the license.
Gave up on madden years ago
Bruh enhance the game make it feel like as if we are in the nfl add commercial breaks an different commentary the games are all the same I see the differences dont get me wrong but y’all clearly don’t have any new ideas an this game should be all out for the legend John madden 🙏👌make the game more nfl like should be atleast 6-10 different stadium commentary like irl I could go on all day what else people like 👍
Blah blah what are you doing to fix the flats, crossers and qb runs
🛑Please update ✈️the 49ers player 🤦🏾‍♂️madden 23!! Debo, Aiyuk, Armstead, Ward, and rookie Danny Grey speed 99 he is fast no smoke💨 These players work hard for they stats. Watch the players before you give them overalls it’s a new Generation💯 The player faces look real but they don’t play like they do in real life😡 come on it’s about to be 2023 Madden let’s go love the game tho 🏈👏🏾
These people got josh Allen tackling y’all know this game bouta be trash
Sucks that their isn't another competitor with madden to give the consumer the best product
How about German language support?
Hope this year they put legends in franchise mode
Is there the griddy
Looks like we’re back to having fumbles all the time again
"You can predict the outcome of a play based on the animation that was triggered..." That is literally the opposite of what fans wanted to hear.
14K Likes 67K Dislikes
Go back to the ignite engine and build off that
So did you guys fix the constant crashing on series x or nah?
This is the first time in a decade or more that the next Madden game is truly a new game and not just a roster update.
People hyping madden 23 I already have madden 25 😂😂
How does this have so many likes?
I feel like most of features have been in past maddens or in ncaa it’s just under new fancy names
Just added more Cheesy ahh stuff
LMAO your player ratings are laughable again! Love how you have people rating players who never played the game of football! only video games.
Madden 23 is gonna be the same ole trash they put out every year…
The highlight from 3:04 was telling. Toting that they've revamped endzone fade throws (impossible to execute in Madden), but cut away to a totally different angle after the catch before the ball was completed in the first angle showing the successful 'climbing the ladder' on the loft. These guys are snake oil salesmen.
You could already do all this in Madden 21... still looking forward to this game but I hope they fix the speed,
I hope of one of those +3500 animations, they actually have the DBs actually play the ball the way you’re taught and have one hand on the hip and reach across with the opposite arm to actually bat a ball down.. but I doubt it.
This looks good! First time I’ll be buying on release in over a decade.
That’s amazing seeing defenders not going for the pick every time
@EA SPORTS MADDEN NFL ; Y’all should consider adding more game types in the Play Now mode (like International games, or Conference Championships) for casual players, people who like to have tournaments w friends, or people who don’t have access to the internet. Ik I’ve personally been wondering why it hasn’t already been a feature for years at this point, although this might just be my opinion.
Couldn't you control where the ball went with the left thumbstick in old Madden/NCAA games already?   I remember holding down on the thumb stick to throw the ball low and behind a WR to make them cut back, or using the thumbstick to lead a WR so they could catch and run.
Idk I’m kind of excited lol
I love using the big hit stick! I get so many fumbles because of that. With that being said, I hope they allow a little more leniency or forgiveness on early hit sticks... in the previous games, the player will stall out if he is not close enough often times missing an easy tackle at the least. If they fix this, even if you don't get the big hit, you can still stop them by a shoelace tackle.
It genuinely looks better, albeit the improvements are subtle. It looks like how 22 was supposed to be - very little clipping and FINALLY with physics-based gameplay.   What’s sad is this is ONLY available on PS5 & XBSX. It’s bad enough that last gen will miss out, but what the hell...PC too?  C’mon now. Y’all are one of the biggest gaming companies and you can’t add this stuff to the most powerful type of systems? SMFH
Madden 12 has this FIELDSENSE *h*t
@2K you up?
Can't believe you gave pc the current gen version instead of next gen. won't be buying after all
It all literally looks the same
Still no tattoos? Waaaaaack.
Wait....Wait....Wait.     They now have two men tackles instead of one man tackles?  Uh Oh EA is stepping up their game.
Madden players when they buy the game every year and wonder why it looks the same :😱😱😱😱
I’ll have faith in this community when the Headlines finally say “Madden NFL receives lowest Sales in years, many unhappy with EA”
I swear if it's the same commentary I'm going to scream
These games never change lol
We need Joe buck and troy  Aikman for the commentary guys
All they have to do is add in the classic teams and I would be happy
All they would have to do is add in the classic teams and I would be happy
This look like the same shi as 22 nun changed but Imma get it anyway 🤷🏾‍♂️
why do pc version not include new features?
I can’t wait to play this for free eventually
So unless I have a xbox series or ps5 - none of this matters. You give the PC players the shaft again..
We had this passing feature in like madden 18 or 19 lol and now they tryna say it’s new 😂
I will say, it’s hard to play defense on madden. It would be cool if lower score games happen more often. Like 14-10. Or 10-7. Almost every game is in the 20s-30s
It seems like they addressed some of the issues from the last game by making them more complicated
It’s so hilarious how they just casually tell us how bad their game is from last year
Imagine All-Pro Football 2k8 gameplay paired with Madden 08's franchise and today's graphics.
I'm still surprised no ones called Madden for their 2004 QB vision being implemented last 2 years like it's brand new lol
Still not sure what’s different about this years game
How about we get realistic injuries. I’ve never laid a good hit and got an injury from it. 99% of the injuries are off ball occasions and 90% of those are linemen
I've been hearing about all these "new features" for the last decade, yet the game has been pretty much the same for the last decade 🤣🤣🤣  Madden 22 was so trash I didn't even get the free version on game pass this year
Love the fact that fieldsense will only be on next gen
cant wait till they fix the challenge system
They literally have had some of these “new features” I’m old games hahaha
They need to just stop releasing the game as a new game.. and just make people pay $15 for a yearly update and if they want to have the physical copy then they can pay the $60.. but it's just an update
Madden 22 is worst most glitched out game I have ever played in madden gaming. Hope sorted it out in Madden 23
This looks horrible lol
Shouldn't these mechanics already been in other maddens past? It's not like yall didn't have the money for it
I’ll wait for NFL2K
60K Dislikes as of now just..... ouch
Can’t wait to get this for $20
When are y’all gonna put ALLTIME/OLD TEAMS like 2k? We wanna play with Deion and Barry.
A lot of new hits and defensive animations were in Madden 05.
Bring back 2k
Field Sense is just marketing speak for, “we took features that were already in the franchise in madden 17 and 18 and renamed them.” EA living up to it’s trash name by taking a dump on Madden’s grave.
Just keep playing madden 21 or 22 and Download new rosters. It’s literally the same. Franchise mode never gets better anyways and face of the franchise is terrible. Like actually awful. It’s like they threw it together in 2 or 3 days.
ea can u move the microtransactions
I LOVE HOW THEY ADD NEW STUFF TO THE GAME N TAKE OUT STUFF WE NEED TO COMPLETE THIS GAME. ITS BEEN OVER 2decades now n we still haven’t had a Madden game worth enjoying without complaints n miscues
None of this will matter. I'll put the ball where it should go and the defender will still jump 12 feet in the air to catch it. Or better yet the plays where a QB could have 99 THP/99 DAC and somehow I'll still underthrow the ball. The mid-air knockout is already a thing and it's rendered spec catch useless for years. Until they move away from Frostbite these games will be garbage.
Can we get possession catches on defense pls!!
Skill base passing has been involved in madden since 2016
Um madden always had that lol. These guys think there slick.
Can we play as a O line In franchise plz:(
NFL 2K5 had these animations, Not as advanced now bc obviously. But they taking 2K5 and just using it new and improved. NFL2K will still do it better
EA Madden it's not in the game, its limited and restricted!
Done buying EA Madden games, EA clearly does not listen to their fans, as an experiment we had 1,000 people message EA before way before the release of Madden 22, what we wanted for improvements in the game or things we wanted to see back in the game, especially customization, EA didn't listen to any of our ideas.  EA cares nothing about their customers, EA wontt get another dime of our money.
Still Trash!! Hurry up with NCAA Football 23!!!!! 🙄
man i wish 2k could make a simulation game. smh. how can red dead 2 have so much detail its to much sometimes, in an entire open world, but ea cant get football right, in a stadium, with 22 players on the field, year after year, after year.
Realistic shoulder pads Atleast
My god fix the faces, they look gross
Add the fantasy points to the stats in the game!!
I play multiple games on my pc and maddens graphics are trash, this is a $20 game.
Madden pc is still old gen, I guess thanks for saving me $90.
Don’t buy this Garbage! They didn’t make any real changes. All they’re doing is taking stuff from old maddens and implementing them into this. They haven’t made any real upgrades and are just selling the same game every year. You’re paying $65 for a roster update and then what ever money you invest into ultimate team. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!
So if my qb have a 67 rating I m going to be able to pass like Brady and make throws I couldn't before 🤔
Wr vs Db.  You can break tackles.  You can tackle.  Really Madden.  I didn't see anything new
If your a true fan you don’t shut up about the problems of the game or call it trash before comes out . You wait for it to come out play the game and then give the appropriate feedback
All i see is an updated NFL 2K5 but the graphics aren't as good ijs. They stole everything except helmet view ijs...
We Need Tats ( Everyone Like this So they can see )
Still made by ea. I won’t be getting it.
Why does everyone run slow as hell
eh I’m on nfl2k23 😂
Hopefully this madden doesn't allow losers to pause the game because they can't beat you forcing you to quit&they get the win
Looks trash... I'm so sick of these companies. Resources comparable to royal families but can't make the best game ever. Wow
Bring back the challenge feature !
Still 🗑
All of these pretty words but will it literally just be a copy and paste like usual? 😑 probably
Still garbage gameplay real legends gave it up long time ago. So many of us that prided off a true game that’s realistic, and truly makes it user vs user isn’t the same. It’s hasn’t been the same since second generation madden that’s when it was the best. The movements are so cheesy same as fifa. They need to revamp the entire mechanics it’s too robotic. Go back and watched all the maddens in second generation.
Tattoos also need to up added an updated to all players that have them come on Ea take notes from all my comments an lets add all this in the game give us fans the best madden this year we deserve it
Also update the player dreads we need new styles added like Richard sherman dreads an also derrick Henry ponytail style dreads
All stadiums need to be super upgraded an they all need to be hostile on big 3 downs
Field sense needs to add field talk to the game on field trash talk like in nfl 2k5 come on add player chatter on the field an show up close clips of the players on the field right before plays
They also need to add bigger hits to wear the players hamlets come off after some big hits
Stop rushing the game an add short clips in the game like after we pick our play an the players walk to the line show up close shots of the players as they walking to the line if will add alot of immerse to the game we need it all
Were are the refs come on Ea add them to the game they need to be on the field ALSO UPDATE THE PRESENTATION AN THE HALFTIME SHOW
EA Sports: We will take your money
Tap In … TerribleTxTelevision like comment subscribe 🙏🏾 Live Ps5 Gameplay   Stop By
Nfl2K5!
Same animations. Don’t fool yourself
……………….. yikes
Another year of them not caring about the PC port. Looks like I'll pass. I can't believe they make all this "new" technology and then only give it to consoles and leave the more powerful systems out of it. Lord knows they don't want to do any actual work like bug fixing
I like the fact they added many animations, better hitting graphics, and better control over the game, but it doesn’t fix the underlying problems. Get rid of the animations! Like real football you get a free stick game. Or the fact Lamar Jackson can run 687 yards a game. Super powers need to be nerfed. Also it looks impossible to run any sort of offense seeing how the tackling was ramped up and the pop out animation for DBs
I’ll stick to 2K5, I’ve been disappointed too many times to fall for the BS this time around
More dropped passes. THANKS..
I can't wait for this Madden 23 game to come out for the PS5. EA made some improvements in this video game and it has superstar X factor on the NFL Players. I'm looking forward to playing this on release day in August.
Stop trying 2k 33 is going to take your job lmao
Wow sad that nobody gonna play it though
All new stuff but they take away grass stains from uniforms
the towel can go on the back instead of on the side
Another year where Franchise is completely ignore again
Not gonna lie, everyone should just boycott this madness until theY put out some legit product. I mean if you know you right ?.... glitch catches, and blind blocks, over -pursuit angles,. Also GLITCH BLOCKS and holes on o-line that are just controller throwing.  I mean everyone  just a true authentic football game, no gimmics , maybe a special talent or two for a uniquely gifted legend or superstar. Thats really it, Maybe a true madden story would help, that doesn't make you cry of repetitiveness.  I mean who comes up with these backhanded my player stories. 2k and and madden are just plain wrong for putting out some of this junk. I bought it because it can be enjoyable, but the hacking and constant infrastructure issues online alone make you want to hate the game. We just want a great madden game it's 2022, give us what we want or watch this product plunge even more.  Again, if you know you know, right?? Madden , we love you but we need and upgraded version top to bottom,  My career, hs college. High-school, NFL retire or unretire. ncaa 14 ish. One of the best games ever still to this day I still own a copy. Franchise, player appearance and styles, better plays. Not the same used and abused plays for a decade now you recycle them every year over and ever again.  Make MADDEN ENJOYABLE AGAIN PLEASE !!! Nope I didn't buy 22 because it's the sake game as madden 21 20 19 and 18. No need to go further it all repetitive. No pre draft workouts meetings fun engagements with fellow talents from players new or old. I could go on but why it'd hurts madden people eyes just reading this because they all know.  Just put out better product please.
Y'all remember Target Passing. Is skilled passing similar
Looks pretty gimmicky
are the dumb… backbreaker football used rag doll physics and it made the game great… animations always ruin the game bro!
YESSS MADDEN 17 let’s go !!!
Will y'all please bring back the zoom in create a player when editing helmet and have options.
Aaaannnndddd still no refs 🤣
Just bring madden 04/05 to next gen and call it a day. Lol. They want 70 for this.
Not enough to warrant the $ lol wait till gamepass and ea play .....heard
EA you all should go to Jail
EA SPORTS: GIVE ME MONEY
Face of the franchise are only adding one position each year just to say they added something new it’s disgusting they need to add almost every position in one year🟥🛑🟥🛑
Cant wait to play this broken shi 😂😂
I can already see a bug where holding up a ballcarrier and forcing a fumble will happen too often
Bro add instant replay back bro
Literally The same game..Every year!  they talk about 3500 new animations I keep seeing the same 5  over and over!
Hey ea i was just gonna say i pulled a legend out of tvp
Lmao terrible company
The game is amazing for the people who haven’t played it yet
2022 fingers still can't grab jerseys
I don't have the current gen....so madden will be the exact same for me
EA now don't remove this in madden 27 and then add it back in madden 32 and call it new
You could have 50,000 animations and it still would not be better than actual real physics.  Time to move on EA!  Your system is outdated.
Same game
Oh man… why am I so skeptical again? Will the end product actually be as good as they say it will be? 🤔
“New field sense” - show some tackling animations from years passed
why are they adding new things instead of improving their old ones?
we mean everything.... yeah
LMFAOOO LOOK AT THE SAFETIES
Legend teams and players? When madden 24? 25
Give up your roster rights already
Every year it’s a new foundation 🙄
It LOOKS like EA is finally doing what they were supposed to, but looks may deceive.
This is sick!!! Looks just like madden 12!!
And this still look like garbage compared to nfl2k5
You been saying that for six years
Hopefully soon they add more to FOTF instead of plying 2 games then making some choices then it’s done and the story aspect is done
True this looks good we need more control on defense we should be able to control our db's  and dive for the ball when it's inches away instead of just taking a dump  the RedZone  or T-baggin
I'll stick to NCAA Football 14....until then let me know when an actual new football game.
They didn't even change the score board overlay like just little things
It look like games gonna be low scoring
Bring back position battles and alot of other things that made franchise mode great from Madden 02-08
Well it sounds good till the game hit the shelves ..broken 🤤🤣
Please don’t have the coach commentary
Oh wow it looks the same as the last 5 years lol
They literally took away ALL dynamic run mechanics and last year and just added them back this year 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this is insanity
We need to boycott this including UT they will never change and I don’t think 2K will be back
360 cuts reminds me of the running game on GameDay 99 I wish they would bring that franchise back. But I will say breaking tackles like Payton or Simpson or Brown running the ball will be so much fun.
If you have Xbox x madden x/s it’s already there lol 🤷🏾‍♂️
Put madden on the switch
This actually looks good
None of this is new... Branching tackles was in like Madden 08-09... Mid air knockouts been in, they just gonna update the frequency of occurrence. Nothin new AT ALL. Still bad reaction by defense. Still horrible blocking.  This may all be great for MUT or arcade players. But for SIM guys and franchise guys. It's just more cheese and exploitation
If it’s not better than APF 2k8 miss me with that I don’t care what you call it
Haven't played madden since 19. That game was trash lol.
so many different controls and all this bs just complicates everything.  Why cant you go back to the tackle button instead of picking between air tackle, conservative tackle, directional tackle, big hit, little hit, one arm tackle, standing tackle
Still no cross platform
do something
I know the game looks better but I feel like there were more features in madden 10 years ago
That seems hard no ?
What I want is more penalties, my players keep getting hit and injured , at least add hit on defenseless recievers
That 360 cut go make lamar Jackson unstoppable
Skill based passing has literally been in the game for 10 years.
Nothing changed in franshihe mode and ultimate team and online mode we want franshihe mode to be like 2k Story
I like the passing Animation by placing the Ball and not just press x or circle or tryangel or square to hope the db dont pick the Ball or the CPU dont messed up the pass
What’s with the jerseys 🤮
Can’t wait
Can I get a closed beta code? 🙏
People still play madden I thought it was just my dad
So all the features we had years ago ?
Oh look another roster update.
So Today is June 18th and there should be Madden 23 trailer so I Have been waiting for like 2 hours and there is nothing from Ea sports. So Please ea sports do the trailer
i despise u EA
Well I don’t know if it’s good but it is steps which is good
Literally looks no different at all
I can’t wAit. Madden is getting so realistic
Looks  the same as the last 5 games
is this only for next gen or is this going to be for pc as well since u dont think my 3080 is better then a peasant console
This control passing didn't work before
Same game past 10 years
Just remake madden 06 new rosters update graphics simple enough
And once again, PC gets screwed on update, and we get stuck with madden 21 roster updated to 23.... EA needs to get their heads removed from their rears.... the PC community have more powerful machines then any new gen consoles, so start giving us the same content! I refunded my order for 23, and i wont buy another EA game until this is addressed.
Plz bring NFL 2K back!
yes, because we want animations, thats we want EA, we want animations… smh
ermmm what about franchise mode, if u guys dont really add anything. Then i just wont buy Madden 23, didnt buy madden 21 so wouldnt affect me.
Hopefully yall put a good amount of songs in the game where all the tracks are available in ALL MODES!!!    THE MUSIC YALL BEEN GIVING US FN SUXXXXXXXXX
I stopped playing madden after 17.  I own every madden since sega, well 17 and down. It’s just not fun anymore I found myself buying a copy every year for 60.00 and getting what should be a 500 mb update not new game
They cannot predict nothing there lying
DONT DO IT TO YOURSELF
They said that last year “more control” and it failed miserably. For anyone with a brain knows that this is bs🤡
Please fix the equipment been the same cleats for years and every other equipment
wait... didnt they introduce the abiltiy to tackle mid air in madden 16 with the play receiver thing?  Am I trippin
We were already able to do all of this in this video
One thing I hope they add back is the opening coin toss. The whole “first selection kick/receive” “second selection with or against wind” is BS and super lazy. The coin toss is in the game for OT. Just include it in the beginning too!
EA has so much money, they could make the best football game in the world if they really wanted to. If I was EA, I would take all of the features that Madden 08 + NFL 2K5 had and make the ultimate football game.
Angry Joe has 440k  views and 28k likes. This videos 540k views and 12k likes. We can than imagine, how the dislike/like ratio is on this video.
I can point out a lot that’s wrong with the game now even tho it’s the beta it still won’t be fixed. Madden honestly sucks, unless there is an  ALL-MADDEN ONLINE GAME PLAY this game will always be for bums. You can have an elite Receiver and you can’t barely catch the ball. No user controls at all.  N O N E.   EVERYTHING IS ALREADY PREDETERMINED  THE LIST IS LONG AND WELL OVER DUE FOR A NEW FRANCHISED NFL FOOTBALL GAME.
And of course like always, all of these features that seem to make the game better are for next-gen. Sorry I don't want to spend $1000 on a ps5 just so I can enjoy madden some more
Looks great but will this be the gameplay we actually get?
These are old mechanics that have always worked before.
They sad the same thing every year
IT LOOKS LIKE THE SAME GAME EVERY YEAR, LOL
Can you change the L2 to adding more moves for ball carry? It’s a waste of a button for celebrations to be honest
We need the bake and shake for ball carry, more animations on juke moves! It’s always the same animations and predictable. Hope we get some action on that running game.
Can't wait to play this for free on game pass 3 months after it's out and has been marked down to 20 bucks lol you Madden fans are chumps lol
I just want to play in the weather rain snow wind That looks realistic
wow another garbage Madden to not buy
IT LOOKS LIKE THE SAME GAME. THEY DID THIS DOUBLE TACKING BS BACK IN MADDEN 09. ITS THE SAME RECYCLE BS. ♻️
Welcome back to tackle battles
For anyone who can't see the dislikes, its already got 51k dislikes compared to there 12k likes😂
So still o towels to the back? I’m already done with this game smh
Could you please bring this game to Nintendo Switch...!?
Madden literal brings out same stuff each year with different names
Ea -$
Unbelievable
I wonder how many of these 51K dislikes will still buy the game day one...because they can't help themselves.
Seems decent. Though where is the first person prospective?
Ea: added so many nee tackle animations  Also ea: shows the same two tackle animations 6 times in a row while explaining “all” the new animations.
how about personalized player animations? im tired of seeing the same 6 throwing animations
This game is still struggling to add refs...what makes you think its going to any better then the year before
Yeah I’ll wait for it to fail and retire on the ea game pass 😒😒😒😒
Yeah. No I’m good same copy and paste game every year only played it for MUT.
Absolutely garage, I'm shocked they even number the games anymore, if it's the same game every year why bother?
Can u show the ps4 version trailer
None of this is in madden 23
I bet the AI still can’t block
Imagine complaining in the comments
Do me a favor and work on franchise mode. Like actually make way better than what it was. Not everyone plays Madden online EA.
I've disliked this video several times now. Youtube keeps removing my dislike? lmao
I'll be back when madden 30 drops
ea needs to stop trying to hit home runs and just focus on trying to get on base. Its the little things. Start with the receivers understanding how to sit down in between the spaces against zone coverage. Then build off of that.
12k likes, 51k dislikes
Haven't bought Madden since '17 because of false promises like the ones shown in this vid. The game is never nearly this good after purchase. If any of you really want this game to be the realistic simulation it's supposed to be, don't buy this game. Hold out for a few more years to make sure EA gets the point & actually makes a game that'll work as well as they say, for once.
I want first person for qb and better my career modes
About time it become realistic...  assuming this will actually be like this in the actual game...
2ksports!
Ohhh god…
Type stuff
What disrespect to Madden. Putting the exact modes into the game Madden himself hated and didnt want in his game. someone take this game from EA. Boycott Madden
Trash...
i didn't watch the full vid BUT THANKYOU BEYOND BROSKI tweaked FOR THE NEW EXPERIENCE❕
3,900 different tackles but only 10 work
Oh look they can put all this new 🥴 stuff in the game yet again they can’t update Brady’s throwing motion which has been the same since 2019. Brady has a very different throwing motion since he got  to Tampa, please update it.
But will it blend????
Trash
Nobody likes you EA
This Madden seem fine and then play it for enjoy it.
I refuse
Tackling looks 🔥 this year
Bro once u have more people on the tackle talk to me same tackles since madden 13 like make it realistic bro what if u have a running back and he is hard to take down not only 2 get atleast 5 players tackling the rb make the game more realistic
Thanks to EA sports, I have not being able to enjoy an NFL game for the greater part of my life. Thanks EA for being so pathetic.
Literally renaming something you had years ago... good job guys
they trying to be like 2k
Haha.. What a joke! Field sense was supposed to be in Last year Madden. So they call Field sense when the screen shakes lol 😆 . Or when the crowd chants right before kickoff and u never hear them again . Give me a break EA . Stop giving us the Same Broken BS every year. 👎🏾
I just hope defense actually moves/plays the zone instead of standing there watching the wr catch the ball behind him or when the ball is thrown my other teammates move or try to make a play on the ball. How about when the AI qb throws the ball to no one but I know I can INT but the game slows my player down or it gives me the wrong player to make a play
Not impressed.  Seems like I will wait until it releases on Gamepass.
🥱 Yawn. Bring back NCAA
Nah this fire EA 😮‍💨
As a game moving forward I really hope they make it so you can’t use the same play the whole game in h2h or squads
dont let x factor corners like jalen ramsey get burnt by a 5 bench wr bro
So basically running the ball is OP and DBs are unstoppable
All you fans do is complain …
no sold at all.. its going to feel new for 2 days.. then overpowered.. then once the patch drops it aint gon work no more lol
Will u make a like a mobile version for madden23 for like the people who don't have a console or the game to get it?
LOOKS SAME AS LAST YEAR LETs be real NOW
Fieldsense 🤣🤣🤣🤣 EA don't stop year after year so new marketing gimmick for broken games
So where is the new stuff this is all normal updates lol 😂
Soooo... Basically what you could in 22
i get that Madden's primarily a console game but please tell me why FieldSENSE is only on ps5 and xbox but not for PC just doesn't make sense to me
What will be the name of the game in 2024/2025 season? 😂
Still going to be trash
cant wait for angry joe
Well thanks for the same game with différents names
This game is a joke
I love how Giants are down 7-20 in the 4th Quarter just to start the video lmao 🤣
Ahhhh, a updated roster, throw in a few changes and bamm!!! We got a new madden! It's hard not to buy it every year though lol
Need to get rid of “Xfactor” that ruined madden 🤧
Madden 94 on sega genesis looks better than this rigged nfl video game.
Can they just add tattoo and bring back the crowd hype stick pre snap
Yea yea that’s cute and all but WHAT ABOUT TTHE FRANCHISE MODE!!!
Man ugh they just need to go back to madden 25,th physics in that game is amazing
John Madden would be so disappointed.
What about new animated dives? Jumps? Pylon dives, end zone leaps??
They need to put special jerseys on players in a real game to simulate the contact perfectly like they did with the dummies in this video
looks the same as the last 6 maddens.
Shut up.
Basically it's the same b******* now it just actually works 😭😭😭😭🤷‍♂️
Ps also start disliking there videos and last but not least we the customers can make a class action lawsuits that ea thats more glitches 🤣🤷‍♂️ but at the end of the day if made ea wait a month they 💩 themselves.
This look like that 2013 madden which had the best control mechanics and was probably the best madden and most competitive 1v1
wow this looks awesome, almost as good as all pro football 2K8
It looks like madden mobile
So field sense Is a new term for non sense? Seems like glitches will be waiting to happen. It's gonna take multiple updates to get this "smooth gameplay" down.
So they show the Texans running over the colts??
Same old. Haven’t played madden In years. And I’m Not returning.
Serious Question: Does EA actually know how to animate running, or do they just intentionally use clunky and stiff looking movement?
Same same lol
no doubt amazing graphics....but the gameplay itself is still akward
And you make no sense at all this is the same game every year
And ppl still gonna find a way to complain
Is the offense going to disappear 🤣 get TF outta here  all tht polished stuff hell won't be any good if you can't play it . I bet the offense disappears .or maybe the defense . EA it's outta touch with sport's
*More Realistic gameplay yea ok 😂
Add create a play and I'll start playing Madden again.
I don't see why they just don't just come out with a update instead of a new game every year at this point.
🤣😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Just say passing is going to be OD
Another 70 dollar roster update. Business as usual.
Hate to be that guy.. but it looks the same. I'll still buy it because ea has the football game in a head lock and is not looking to let go in anytime soon.
This sounds kinda encouraging. Time to get disappointed.
It must be nice to work at EA sports on the madden creators team - A place where they take off 10 months out of the year and use the last two months to update the previous games roster, add a few minor "upgrades", and throw a new number on the cover of the game. Must be nice
If only EA didn't slow down the progression of Franchise Mode to a complete halt by adding that bum game mode "Madden Ultimate Team". That total money grab for slow people and little kids slowed down the improvement of franchise mode by about 7 years and I'm still mad about it. Smh
Does it have rookies from the draft
Could we have weather in games like real life
Wow that’s cool they released madden 17 again
How y’all got madden but don’t got nba live
NFL 2k5 literally still looks like it has better physics LOL
Nah we don't believe you.  Fool me once, shame on you...
😂😂😂😂 imagine buying this
LOL one more thing Madden 23 can y'all please work on  grass features yall never showed a dirt flying up off the cleats when players are power runing I mean we get no dirt we get no mud when it rains in the game that would be nice if yall  add those features 🙏🏿💯💯
Every year they add some non sense to madden
Madden 23 please bring back that future fans would love to see the players hairstyles on  field not only at the coin toss and it would be sweet if y'all really showed  players picking a helmet back up after I get knocked off and putting  it back on💯🙏🏿Ea that'll be sick
I wonder if the helmets going to come off the players on big hits like on Madden 2004💯🙏🏿 and I hope Madden bring back that feature where the grass get stuck in a player's helmet when they get tackled face down now those was real physics 💯🙏🏿please EA
Just Hype! EA does this every year then disappoints 😞 their fans. Nothing to see here!.
I'll wait for the 2k games 🎮. Right now 2k5 and 2k8 are still the best football games ever created this is my opion. Madden is done!.
Still no refs on the field
Madden 22 with dlc
ya looks the same
I just wanna be able to light up a WR running a slant as a MLB and have a crazy hit stick animation (even if I have to risk the hard hit for a potential penalty). Been hoping they’d implement this for years :(
Still looks the same with slightly better graphics. Give me a better Franchise mode.
what are the dance moves are like in madden plz be the giddy  and higher jumping
Dev: brand new high definition features! The bottom text: game engine not real. I’m not buying another madden 19 lol
why it look so slow
The animations based mid air knock outs & gang tackles was in Madden 04 - 08 😂😂😂 oh and 2011-12
Crazy how you see the same tackles/animations over and over, i don’t see how they went physics driven engine in madden 16,17,18 (ignite engine) then when they switch to (frostbite) gameplay goes back arcade
don't buy it
I already hate it things NFL 2k5 had they are just bringing to the table smh and 2k5 still does it better and it still looks controlled by triggering animations
i love the new passing system just like retrobowl
Wil be a buggy mess and reskin of madden 22
this is really cool im going to buy for sure
Seem like the defense gonna be op
Trash
They are literally just showing Madden 22 OJ Howard was in a Bucs uniform even though he is now on the Bills.
Everyone should come play 2k with me l, I used to be a Madden player just like you I'm not even a big basketball fan but the game is FUN yes sometimes you get screwed over but it's not the same 2 plays
Looks the exact same 😂 not buying
New defensive lol all they did was bring back the hit stick 🏒
Lol the animations lol the exact same 😂 giantess you can still run it to the outside everytime 😂
griddy?
Lol @ madden, such a talentless, lazy company. Lololol
If it's anything like 22 it sucks
i haven't bought madden in years but i still watched this
So the update this year is $60+ to remove frostbite? Hopefully the updated roster isn’t DLC 😂
Sorry EA, I don’t trust you. Too many broken Maddens and now Battlefield…I’ll pass.
Mhmm iffy…
Will they have Madden sound clips or announcing?
Looks like the same game I bought 5 years ago lol. Same graphics, same animations, shoot to me that looks like the same old engine 😂😂
Madden should honestly do a every 2 year game 23-24 and focus on making better games
Didn’t see anything about closing speed smh user LBs are everywhere at once smh so fn unrealistic and cheesy
New commentary is needed, New relocation cities needed,New stadiums needed when you rebuild/relocate, Better team names and better uniforms for the the relocation teams better yet let us build up our own team when we relocate,Tattoo’s And Players need too look more realistic, Heated rivalry’s should have been added, Better cutscenes, More stuff is needed but this what I wanna see change
Bet the game is still a copy and paste from last 2 years and will be a complete garbage of a game.
I can already see mid air tackling giving hell 😂😂
So it's a new skin of 22? Lol madden you gotta do better you ain't fooling majority of people's who see thru the lies
great! release your game on PC
Great still no catching n will get pushed out of bounds same game new number lol still going buy it tho 😂😂😂
It’s still the same game will not be buying again playing ultimate is a joke Derrick Henry At QB😂😂🚮
Madden 04-07 is still goated
Stop having a sook. This games looks great. Y'all never happy huh. They could make the greatest game of all time and y'all would still hate
Put 10 years into franchise madden 22 just to have it delete its self mid game ea wouldn’t help me but that’s because there a scam the only way we can positively change the game is SIMPLE , DO NOT BUY THE GAME!!
Will there be new relocation teams
Every buzz word invented but it's a football video instead
Nice lissssssp
Mid air tackling system? lol What a joke.
Drew Lock will win more mvps than ever
I SEE IT NOW & I DON'T EVEN PLAY ONLINE. BUT JUST WAIT TILL SOME GEEK STARTS SPAMMING THAT "HOLD THE BALL CARRIER UP" ANIMATION.
All this focus on the skill positions but blocking still seems to be broken
If this is true WHAT took them so long
TRASH
I love how you guys made the defense better, like the DB isn’t sprinting 30 yards across the field to intercept my ball, I know I didn’t here this man say accurate passes 💀
Wow ! So Insane and awesome to see madden taking the approach for the new animation branching technology so that they can give us the ”gamers”an all realistic gameplay experience in every authentic play ! This year madden is really going to impact the franchise moving forward instead of backwards and empower the true players of the NFL gaming community ! Can’t believe they notice how in madden 22 they lacked gameplay experience for the players and precise that the players didn’t have enough controls for themselves and was more for the gameplay visuals instead…🙂
Let's go!!!
I'm not one to give EA credit but I will say you can tell they are at least making an attempt to fix some of the things the community has been complaining about for years.
🥱🥱🥱 give ESPN the rights back
"mid air tackling" aka - shove
EA can put out anything and the NPCs will still buy
Woah... it's a game...
Thuis is some 🗑
This reminds me how they had a new gameplay system in the last game  And the one before that  And before that one too  ESPECIALLY the one before that as well
Build a new GAME
Madden been the same since Madden 15 or 16
I'll wait for ncaa
NFL, open up the market already.
Did y’all really sit in a conference room and thought “Hit Stick” and “Hit Everything” didn’t sound the exact same.??
Madden developers should really start looking at the YouTube comments or and critical reviews bc they could be making much more effective improvements
For the love of God build a new engine. This one has been ruining the franchise for years.
Really has not been much improvement since 2018. Graphics are still about the same and game play is slightly improved over the last 5 years.
madden is trash dont trust it
Wasn’t this madden 13?
They talk like everything this guy says is awesome but I really don't care what he says.
3500+ new animations but i bet it’ll still be the same ones used throughout the game
this game sucks
Use the NCAA Football 2006 engine. Please.
Madden is trash
What about hit everything on offense teach these people real stick skill
First 10 seconds of the vid is a lie. Madden did not build any new foundation for the upcoming title.
Madden is full of it.  I don't believe them anymore
Lies
Another year where EA tricks the idiots with “new features” to buy their game😂
I just want pressing to mean something. I wonder if they'll finally let you jam tight ends at the line.
Sidelines are STILL embarrassingly naked. No defensive "punch out" animations. No misdirection and/or missed arm-tackle animations. No juke with stiff-arm animations. Awkward tackle physics, angles and combinations. Players will always look like they are on ice and not truly digging their cleats in the turf. Apparel and accessories look like more like extensions of the players' bodies. Lack of diverse player models. Lack of a 1st Person mode. And a lack of manual Draft Combine events. Pray to god they provide us with mid-season DLCs.
stop buying the game
Blah blah blah where is NCAA
Spending more money and time on a trailer than your game! Grow up madden!
Bet you still can’t challenge in franchise mode
This is absolute here last years pass system was too free-form. This hits the spot even the linebackers can round corners now💪☝️🏈
Micro transactions!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This game is trash. EA needs to give up the license
Copy and paste same every year
It’s the same game that came out in 2017 guys ….
lol Josh Allen blasted that dude that was trying to get by his twin.  @0:53
mid-air tackle looks like pass interference lol
New commentators or new scripts?
BOOOOO
TRASH
not buying their trash again.
I haven't played Maddden in years but I love the new things they have added
New animations all the tackles are the same lol
Whoever still buying Madden should be tested for insanity 🥲
i want better franchise mode where it shows you off field things when you get new contract u can upgrade ur house , car, clothes, girlfriend, social status  i wanna go from rookie with basics to win super bowl get big bonus check and drive off in a dream car of my choosing
Hopefully online head to head won’t be laggy for ps5
Sooo when are the franchise updates?
I like how madden accurately depicted the no fly zone, cause ain’t no one gonna catch a ball on this D!   But seriously, I hope they address the “getting stuck behind o-line as a runner” problem
Are you sure your not false advertising?
I’m never playing this game again unless they actually give the 6’5 receiver a chance to catch the ball over a 5’10 corner 😭
1:58 that looks real realistic foooor sure
Dang It's finna be a week and this only has 300 sum views. @EAsports it's time for some major overhaul and rebranding next go around.
Ion know they might be trying do too much
If I’m being as honest as possible…this doesn’t look bad at all. We’ll see tho when the game comes out
DBs sound like they’re going to be overpowered
Looks the same to me. Another year off madden. It’s been 13 years since I play madden. No regrets 😂
Yeah this game will be trash like every year not worth the money
It’s the same game since 2018 Dnt waste money
The animations are exactly the same as last year what a joke
Trash I haven't  played madden in 3 years
Please NFL take the license away!!
Game gonna be exactly the same
None of this stuff is new
The more people keep spending money on points the less they're gonna change their game. This is why they never improve fifa or madden.  Idiots spending grands yearly on a yearly subscription for madden n fifa. Absolutely nothing has changed.
its a trap guys
why can't they just put in one game  ??
Too much talking.
.....*yarn*.....
Madden the only game that will take something out then bring it back 5 games later and make it seem like it was new. Lol   They better hold on to that license cause if 2k ever make a NCAA college basketball or football along with NFL madden will be no more
Man it would be nice if the helmets could come off like in the older games
" Can't wait for Madden 24 trailer  EA will tell you how they improve the mistake's from Madden 23 😂  " EA sports it's not in the game" 😂
Scam
Same game every year
These are old features
Might as well Bring Game Breakers back
This looks sooooo much better than previous titles as far as physics, and animation. It actually looks like a next gen football game. I always get excited for Madden time I truly hope they deliver!
TRASH
NFL 2K5 was a much better game than Madden is TODAY!
Hey look another copy and paste Madden game, exciting
Every year they say they added a new foundation for gameplay and its always the same game
Fark me it's the same lol what bs
When they still treat pc like last gen. 😵‍💫
even john madden is mad in his grave
The animations look no different?
Sure, let’s call it FeelSense instead of DualSense. 😉
🤦🏾‍♂️🤣🚫♻️🚮
“With the goal of giving players the same game they’ve been buying the last decade”
Animation…..animation…..animation. Is this place Pixar now. Passes you couldn’t make before…..like goal line fades which are standard plays in the nfl…. But haven’t been available in madden for years. Want to improve your game EA…….bin ultimate team rubbish.
FieldSense??? Haha. That's just a marketing term. EA are just greed and manipulation. So glad I haven't bought a Madden game in years. Wish another developer would get a shot at an NFL game.
The precision passing already sounds much better, among other things if these are true. Always felt the game didn't feel or look as real as it could.
Plz update the equipment sheeessh make the backplates more noticeable put the skinny towels in the game put it to where we can put the towels in the back stuff like that
how come at 1:38 mahomes looks like he ways more than vince wilfork
The same game but with new rookies and players and it still looks the same this game Is going to be trash
Not fooling me again
Idk about that fumble bs..that's ridiculous..defender holds up the ball runner to cause a fumble
Knowing madden fans they still not gonna b happy with game play even if it's better
2k is getting closer to owning this again and I can’t wait
All EA does with madden is recycle old ideas and rename them into something "COOL" sounded. There used to be qb vision, then actual spot passing which was exactly like this so called field sense thing. Remember TOTAL QB CONTROL? LOCOMOTION? GANG TACKLES? lol Its just the same old thing. Just waiting for a new company to make a football game. Even if it isnt licensed NFL teams.
Madden hasn't really changed that much since 2019. It is basically the same game just updated rosters.
Anybody know if this is for both gens or just next
Something tells me that there is going to be a lot of fumbling and dropped passes
Stop Lying and put legends in the game
even madden 20 aint have this and they had the best juking animation
Thumbs up for at least admitting faults in 22's game.. hopefully a change for the better but we'll see.. servers have always been pretty bad, though
Other than “360” cuts, I see nothing new here.
People actually buy this?
It looks like the same bs madden
Trash. Looks the exact same
The passing mode is simply precision passing from madden 06!!! The problem with madden is that they will forever be stuck with animations. They need to implement physics. That is what made Backbreaker so mind blowing because no hit was the same. If madden could put animations and physics together, then we will truly see a sense of next gen. The problem with watching this trailer is that everything they are talking about is the same things over and over with re-branding. Giving new names to things that were already in the game since madden 06. I wonder if these developers are aware that gamers are aware that we KNOW. Even in this video they talk about shortcomings, yet still try to sell us on these "fresh" ideas. The graphics look the same as always, I just do not see the LEAP, we were all expecting when Xbox and PS5 dropped and honestly, I don't think we will for a long time to come.....Quite disappointing
Same game every year. EA Sports better keep renewing that contract with the NFL, because if 2k sports ever be able to make a game again it's over.
All these animations are old
1:13 Josh Allen and josh Allen tackling josh Allen….
Field sense looks like it’ll make or break madden
I’ve seen hits that in real games are defenseless receiver penalties. Plus bring back the refs. I mean it’s PS5 and that XBox thing
Fix the pass defense 🌚
josh allen and josh allen took down  josh allen
im tired of throwing to recievers and they drop it every time and they're bragging abt it
I find is dumb how the dislike button is literally gone like bro covid did so much damage we cant as a mass pop who wants a difference now can't even show it
LOL this trailer. So you basically took last years game, added 6 more pixels to player models, mo-capped 2 more people, and basically spent more time on this trailer than you did on vastly approving the game from last year.
Just make possible to see my touchdowns while looking at highlights 😭😭
I hope the players actually try to tackle instead of a "tackle" looking like the player tripped and fell. Even had running plays where I tried to dive into the endzone and the player looked to just drop to the ground at the 1 yard line. Even withe issue's in game my biggest gripe was how after playing games that sometimes it would get stuck on the loading screen after the game, causing you to have to reset the game and play again, only for it happen again most times. As bad as other issues were at least I could finish games and go to the next but with Madden 22 on ps5 there was a problem where it would just keep playing thr load screen over and over and I would restart, play the game and have it happen again.
This update for Madden 18 looks good
These boys put in that NFL streets mechanic where you keep tapping the button to break a tackle before a second defender hits you 💀 acting like it’s some new technology
Won’t buy because of that bogus power up bar that shakes your screen. This is a football game. Come on!
2K>Madden
Literally the same game. I stopped buying Madden since 2016.  Bring back NFL 2K!!
Sooo when is the "Next Gen" Madden coming to pc??
All this and NCAA 07 Football is still way better.
it looks the same
And then you realize it’s EA 🤷🏽‍♂️
But will the refs be the field?
Whoever buys this game, are a bunch a fools.
In madden 23, we're gonna try to fix what was broken last year
Change tha scoreboard so it looks different and y’all ah be set.
EA out here talking about new mechanics. 2K5 is almost 20 years old with these mechanics.
Miss 2K
Backbreakers from back in the day had a really fun physics and collision system. A fraction of the budget EA gets. Yet we see the same game year in and year out for madden. Gross
Where Is the Nintendo Switch Version without that it's not in the GAME
Where's the Nintendo Switch Version
FINALLY THAY ARE BRINGING THE GOOD OLD FEATURES BACK
They say the same thing every year and nothing ever changes
Trash
You can now throw fade routes to the back of the end zone... immediately cuts the video. I guess will be like scouting in the last one. Promised. Delayed. And never delivered.
It might just be me but Didnt really see a big difference in the tackling lol madden ant slick lol
Clearly people who make the game aren’t real football fans.
Same thing over and over again. Please put respect on John maddens name and make a decent game for once. I remember when madden was actually exciting. Now it’s like it gets worse every year only thing different is roster updates.
Boycott EA
Do more with franchise then I’ll consider buying it
Hopefully new animations dont have lot glitches
So it’s the same game 😂 lol
Dude I just wanna push y/triangle to jump and catch
Can we talk about , how the Vikings kickoff got sold
cool, I might get it for 17.99 when it’s on sale.
WHY CAN’T THEY SHOW WHAT COLLEGES ARE GOING TO BE IN THE GAME. GOOD LORD EA
Umm still no create a team or legendary teams ?
I can only hope
Ngl this looks like much smoother game with way better tackling animations im surprised lol, hope they add more 2 franchise as well
Game is horrible man
Ok, so it seems that you're making some solid improvements with the movement, but I still think that Madden should move away from the yearly releasing schedule
MADDEN DESPERATELY NEEDS NEW CAMERA ANGLES. PUT US ON THE FIELD. It makes no sense why we still have the same camera options for career/franchise modes as we do the base game. Until you’ve addressed an issue that simple you’re not really trying EA, you can’t fool us
They’re basically giving us features they took out years ago back.
Garbage
that skill based passing is tough im ngl 🔥
But did you actually make “face of the franchise” any good?  2K is SLAUGHTERING you in this department!!!!!!!  You add nothing to this mode because it doesn’t have loot boxes.
Madden 16 hasn’t changed I see
Madden 25 still is the same
Put it on old generation then I’ll buy your broken game
add a lot of face scans to franchise mode and the draft
Wow! There's more dislikes than likes. 41k Dislikes!!!
Precision passing has BEEN in the game. You can control where you throw the ball, you can throw high, throw low... that's not new at all. 360 cuts BEEN in the game. You can cut on a dime in 22. Mid-air tackles been in the game. This is a load of trash.
Ea getting worst like nba live madden will soon be gone because 2k is about to make nfl game so why is the ball in the air so long we’re a person can interception so maddden 23 is going be trash now
Looks like the same BS released every year
where is challenging calls while playing online??
We want career mode revamped
I THOUGHT THEY DID THIS ALREADY WITH PASSING AND TACKLES. ARE WE RECYCLING AND RENAMING
Trash
The same liesssss over n over year after year when is EA’s contract up please someone let me know … I’m tired 🥱 of the same bs
you can knock recievers out of bounds🤯🤯
Is this only next Gen??
Where are the refs?
So you fine tuned the mechanics of the game from last year. Looks way cleaner. An just from this trailer I love the new hit everything, an looks like better press for my backs. But my question did you fix the load/lag time? I'll be in mid pass an it'll lag ever so slightly an I barely make my pass or I'll miss it. An the between screen load times were insane, they took longer than any other Madden game I've played. So we'll see how it goes, then..
It’s still BS, saw a clip where two corners ran into each other on WR crossing routes . That doesn’t happen often . Add field sense to every player all the time and nerf the broken tackles A.I is too OP
I think Madden has reached its max potential. I don't know if it can go any higher. Bring NFL Street back. Stop the simulation and make it more arcade. At least I'll know it'll be fun and I'm not holding the standard so high.
I’ve been a madden fan for a while, and I will say it’s a great game! I would like to see a better interface and more a interactive my player mode rather than just one on one interactions and text messages. Somewhat of 2k theme. The concepts and new features are great but I still feel it’s lacking something
Interesting there are 2K comments.
Stuff that should already have been in the game..
pls tell me yall fixed the dumb stuff like where you tackle someone, and they go down but still get up and run
The offensive line hasn’t changed since 2012
Tried of ea here comes 2k sports I will be buying 2ks arcade football game I am done with ea sports
I see towels moved around
I wish we could have tattoos on madden
Also one small detail i have been asking for that has been a thing since 3-4 years ago. WHY CAN’T WE WEAR T-SHIRTS. I want to be able to play with my shirt partially if not fully untucked. Like jalen ramsey or tae adams when i want to create an identical character. I want to have my hand warmer on the back instead of my front. Sweater slash jerseys i see some players wear in the snow.  I want it to look as close to real life so when I simulate I don’t feel like im playing a game. PLEASE ADD JERSEY UNTUCKED jersey IN A PATCH or add under shirts how almost every db and wr wears when they play. You can see the shirt under their jersey
I like it. But you must add the griddy As well. At least for LSU boys. At least! I would say make it apart of the game because it’s not going nowhere anytime soon.
basically they added more animations
4:12 i want to see more of that because last you weren’t able to hit no stutter step after you left the line of scrimmage, all you could do was hit sharp cuts
This all sounds cool and look but why is there no devante adams hesitation cross.  When he hops off one leg then jukes right or left off the line of scrimmage or while he’s running. I want the wr vs db matchups to be as realistic and skill full as possible
When Is The Release Date
This looks like Madden Mobile...
This was in 2016 now they bring it back ughh
It's still not better than NFL 2K5 !
I think we should all appreciate they finally changed the gameplay since like madden 16 😭
TRASH AS ALWAYS, DONT BUY
Hold up! Mid-Air Tackles? Didn’t NFL 2K5 have that like 18 years ago?!
Is this coming to PC? Not Madden but fieldsense
Have of the things they added has already been on madden for years smh
🥱😴😴😴😴😴😴
I wonder if it's going to be just as bad or worse than the previous games?! I haven't bought madden in 3 years so idk but it was on a steady decline when I left
I hope you all know that all of these “systems” were in ncaa 14 a game that came out 10 years ago
Ok, but will they finally add referees on the field during the game again?? 🤔
Same game for a DECADE!!
I been done with Madden for the last 5 years
Yea na. I'll wait for NCAA or another NFL game
I think sports games should focus on the fun aspect over the sim aspect
I love how this new "FiElD SenSe" is also only available only for xbox series x/s and ps5, and probably not even the pc version. Literally makes 0 sense as to why its done this way. All field sense boils down to is being able to cut with the ball carrier (which should have already been a feature) and more animations. Pathetic
And plz tell my you guys actually put some time in making the face of the franchise story better this year 😂😂😂
What do it look so rough SMH Take me back to 2001  I think that's when Eddie George was on the cover
FIX THE TACKLING AND QB FUMBLE ANIMATIONS!!! Bring back the madden 16 animations. More rag doll effects back then.
EA how about addressing the elephant in the room, your unrealistic arcadish  and overbearing momentum feature, ? over the heads of eligible receivers. Disappearing icons over eligible receivers. Unable to scroll to all plays in certain offensive formations during a game. Momentum tiles overlapping pre-snap adjustments the list goes on and on. Additionally Franchise does not have the ability to disabled these arcade funhouse game stuff off, however the franchise description states total control and what do you mean? I've been in several leagues not one person had anything good to say about your momentum arcade features, not being able to disable or turn them down in franchise is total disservice and disrespect to the your customers.
Only on PlayStation 5 remember that lol
This looks good but I hope EA can make this a great feature, the only problem is a don't have a ps5:(
Field sense what we needed
I hope they bring back the training camp from madden 07
Madden stop being innovative, and continuously improving when nfl 2k football stop being produced. The nfl should give 2k its licenses back, maybe that will put a pep in ea sports step in coming out with a better product. Cause madden is basically copy and paste with minute changes to the graphics, and that’s pushing it.
All I want to is Challenge a bad call!
STILL NO REFEREES! ADD THEM BACK IT'S NOT THAT HARD!!!!
Bring back 2K!!! EA can’t shine 2K’s shoes…
I can already feel the glitches, bugs and broken ness of the game already. Madden 11 is where I will stay
Just getting started huh?
Can't wait to see all you suckers buy this game and then be disappointed with its rehashing of ideas.
Madden 13, player update announce trailer
garbage game
They brought back features and slapped them with a new name. A lot of these features ARE NOT NEXT GEN Features. 😂 some these features have been in NCAA Football games and even older Maddens. Only thing good I can say that madden may finally be DECENT this year.
I hope so because you are doing embarrassing job the last few years
Just call this NFL Defense Backs only. Haha All you play in this game is Safeties and Corners and man defense.
So fumbling the ball is gonna be worse than it already is in madden 22?
Literally looks just like madden 22 with a new roster update I can’t wait til EA’s contract is up with madden
why is the x so small 😂
Trash
They should add an option to make your pants above your knees!
I’ll buy madden again when y’all get a new game engine & new commentators. Oh & Refs back on the field and with the option to play Sim in H2H online & vs friends.
Lol. EA selling "mid-air tackles" like they haven't been around since the dawn of Xbox One. Like c'mon. This has to be one of the top 5 most fraudulent companies on the planet. Such a shame.
Probably still have real life retired numbers programmed in.
I have deleted Madden 22 at least 20 times this year out of frustration, a game should be fun, and it's only Madden that this happens with. it's obvious all your clips for 23 are edited because it's still the same game! FIFA was smart to move on from your greedy company, and y'all act like y'all wanted expand your horizons 😂it doesn't get any better than FIFA, your company is a joke, your product is trash, I can't wait for the day that NFL wakes up and walks away like FIFA did! It's only a matter of time!
might not be half bad..    I mainly play cpu vs cpu in Franchise mode and let my gameplan and roster construction win my games for me...
They finally brought back l2 as a way to juke. What they need to do is make it like it use to be where L2 was the left juke and R2 was the right juke allowing you to be able to combo it up with left right left or right left right juke.
"in madden 22 you could predict the outcome of a play based on the animation"  Omg they admitted it.
will pc be old gen?
It’s 2022-2023 Madden And There’s Not Even Refs On The Field! You Call This A Simulation Game! 😂😂😂😂 Even FIFA Has Refs!
This Game Is Disrespectful To John Madden And His Legacy!
Same game year after year.
Why isn't Madden 23 next gen on PC EA? Thats the dumbest thing I've ever seen
Why did YouTube remove the dislike option. But still have it there
Tony better be calling the games
Will Fieldsense be on PC?
Pro tip buy madden every 3-5 years and it’ll actually feel like a somewhat different game
Until ea sports overhaul the entire game we stuck with trash
Trash as usual(smh)
🗑🗑
Please put madden commentator voice in the game this year. And those new mechanics are great but make the game have realistic running motion please
Am I the only one who noticed how big Daniel Jones jersey number looked
Every single tackle animation has been seen in the past 5 maddens. nothing has changed. Fix Franchise mode and maybe Ill buy it.
I see the same animations that been there for years, they don’t even look athletic. Shoulder pads look way off too
Why can’t any of the upgrades be applied to Pc?
They finally put the Real strip ball mechanics on there , no lie I been wishing for a while now 🤣🤣
My guess is that this is only on next gen
So basically a update of the accuracy light that was on madden back in the day
If video game rentals were still a thing: I'd still feel uncomfortable about shelling EA 5 dollars to deliver a solid game.
W
So you can throw a goaline fade finally after 20 years?
No Refs??? Really ? Cheerleaders ? Looks the Same every year - definitiv Skip this year
Ea “We’ve captured thousands of different animations”  EA: still uses the same animations from madden 21🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
face of the franchise better be dope
Looks good honestly. Lets see how it turns out.
Bet they spent more money and time on this YouTube video than the actual game itself smh
You're dumb if you buy this and complain about it every year, you know it's gonna be trash
Garbage
This is all cool but yet reviews are going to be bad.
Wow hard cuts...I loved those in NCAA Football 14
still absolutely awful ball trajectory on passes 🤣
I’ll wait for this to drop to $24.99 or lower like I always do shoutout to the nuts who pay full price for Madden 🤣🤣
Can you do it for both es please ill enjoy cause I have a ps4 I’m sad that all the new stuff won’t go on both and it’s just unfair
Genuinely looks like some good additions here, looking forward to more.
Will there be more detail for example a NFC or AFC conference championship celebration with hats, t shirts, something. I’m tired of doing a franchise, winning a conference championship and the players walking into the locker room like the game was no big deal. Gameplay matters but also attention to detail matters to.
they literally changed the scoreboard and made that the only sigificant change
Bro ofc when I just got madden 22 🤦🏾‍♂️ bruh just update your game instead of making a new one 😭
Next GEN get everything😭
Still the same game.
Are these features coming to ps4. If not, Im not buying it.
When are we going to get accurate player models? Franchise mode needs to be reset to it's last great point which was probably 2007 ps2 version. Zone on the Hopkins corner TD looks suspect, nobody even acted as Hopkins was a threat to score on that play.
madden will be awful  just like before  the gameplay of finaley there but it's not worth my money  and my time to play
Looks just like madden 16. trash. they have no motivation to be better.  year after year same bugs n same repetitive garbage. blocking still looks horrible. make your games $20 n ill consider buying it.
Ngl if this game sucks ea gotta let someone else takeover they do these same hype videos every year and it’s always the same gameplay😂😂😂😂😂
Graphics are laughable, looks the same like it did in 2014
Uh huh….sure EA
Trasssshhhhh
So it’s exactly the same as madden 22 that’s why 2k will forever be the better franchise
we had 360 cuts with left buttons in the madden 2000s lol
i really like this idea of controlling your passing and tackling. i just hope it’s as great as it seems
Lol you cud pass like that last year it just didn’t have a title
Die hard only game I play and don’t even buy it no more
Just watch it happens every year
There gonna end up ruining the football game sooner or later everyone will hate this type of gameplay just stick to the old style and everything is fine yall tryna do everything BUT improve gameplay just throwing a bunch of different apps on a console and letting it decide how to play the game EA getting lazy
New year, same old garbage
The Jets numbers are too small for the 4th year in a row
I ain't gon lie some of these anamation are trash
Add all time teams EA
So the plan is to continue to pile on animations on top of already broken animations. Sounds like a completely playable game on release with no bugs as usual. Atleast some things will never change.
WR get new open field cuts new animations to create space and separate from the defense. DBs get a new way to press. no stacking a route? does inside and outside leverage even matter? they still look like they are always waiting to the last minute to react and by that time it's always too late.
Add tattoos that we can put on our players add better mouthpieces more equipment options like baggy sleeves
Why do the chinstraps and numbers look sped 💀
Man look madden is trash bring back NFL street.
I will stick with Madden 12 thank you!
Listen people, we will still buy the game and EA knows this.
I wonder how many people are gonna buy the game, then cry about it being the same and claim they'll never buy Madden again before getting it again next year
Mid air tackling is new 😂😂 yeah okay
So basically, the tackling is still animation based. Lol
Ea yall so trash
Is this madden20
Just say you added the 360 cuts for kennerh walkers debut
Trash
0:06 i love how oj howard dosent even play for the bucs anymore lol
MAKE NEW GEN ON PC
bring back mini games🤧
lmao all the animations are exactly the same just on different player models. gtfoh w "3500 new animations" what r they even counting
Free nfl 2k
Looks horrible. PASS.
I hate everything about this
Enter the gameplaying of greatneaa
Hasn’t been good since 2004-05
Mid-air passing hits = mad picks, I can already see it.
3:10  B is left wide open and 3 people are around him and just ignore him! Glad to see defense is still broken.
32k dislikes they might have to reup load this if you could see that
Every year same product different year , On the new generation consoles  there will be new features I'm sure but its the animation for me makes the game so predictable and unrealistic. I only play it because there's no other football game's to play
I noticed a lot of activated players when explaining what changed and works smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
@EA SPORTS MADDEN NFL, LIke Ryan Moody has shown US multiple times you guys are the best liars in the gaming industry. You guys are gonna have people raging out when they fall for your marketing BS & buy Madd23. This is Madd22.5  with more GOOF BALL animations....🙄😅😂🤣! Salute to the lil' kids & naive consumers that still allow you to scam them out their money....LMAO.
THERE BETTER BE TATS COMING THIS YESR
Hey EA SPORTS when will y’all bring NBA LIVE back? Come on nah, y’all not scared huh?
Ugh
Does it come with Watson’s massage training?
lol y’all felt like that?? Wow! We felt like that too!!
Is the video blank on purpose??
The momentum system should be removed though it’s Arcady and adds nothing to realistic value in football. In real life QBs are not immune to pressure once a team gets momentum. If it was authentic then the momentum system wouldn’t be deciding outcomes. Whoever has momentum is guaranteed to win
Lolll boring who is still buying this garbage 🗑 🙄
I actually like this. Nice job ea
Fake News! I'll stick with ESPN NFL 2K5.
This video has more dislike than the likes. Lol!!
It looks like madden mobile
This game will be trash like the past 10 years of madden games I can't wait til yall get real competition
They do all this extra bs. Then don’t have the most basic stuff. Like BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT THE MFING STANDINGS IN CAREER MODE!!!!
23 sounds hecka lit ngl
8K likes 32K dislikes keep letting them know 🤙🏾
🗣we need create team 🤦🏾 smh
1 thing that really bothers me about madden 22 is when I’ll predict where the opposing team is going to throw the ball & I try to switch over to one of my defensive backs but it just switches between the lineman.. I hope they fix it in 23 🤞🏾
Bring back the drafts in madden NFL 2K16 When you can drop anyone who wants
We not gonna talk about how Joe Burrow doesn't have a superstar ability? smh 0:48. But somehow Zeke still has a superstar
How is this new when most stuff were from madden 17/18 but just renamed?
Will players auctally try to pick up the football when they fumble
Does Madden 23 have cross play on all platforms?
0:40 once again..the DB is reacting to the pass but the receiver not??????..so he gets a pick and the receiver just stumbling and doesn't get to make a play?  IM NOT LIKING WHAT IM SEEING
Identical to 22 in every single way. About time EA loses the rights and let a real company make it with genuine passion for american football and making a game for the fans
Pass leading, Mid air tackling, gang tackling? All of that has been in the game for years, but here’s EA trying to showcase it as a new feature LMAO. 90% of those “mid air tackle” animations happen so often in madden 22.
Madden every year but no Fight Night? 🤦🏾‍♂️
false advertising
basically what there saying is we are reusing animations and physics from all the old maddens and pasting them into this madden
copied and pasted madden 22
TRASH
Didn’t you already have target passing in 2018
00:59 3500+ new animations but we’re only gonna see  3 of them
Just repackaged the same features from previous maddens. Way to disrespect John Madden
Madden is so bad. It’s been bad for years. They aren’t even trying anymore. These animations look terrible
Was najee Harris towel in the back ? If so this might be the hardest madden yet
Whenever they focus on the WRs in this video, focus on the DBs. My God they look terrible and are barely even trying to cover.
This is the same stuff. The gameplay looks like the last 5 games, and that's a problem because it's been terrible for the last 5 games.
What about Franchise Mode...? Please note that Madden 08 is still the most complete Madden yet. When is EA returning all the features that were removed since that game?
Does the AI run diagonally for the first down or do they still just run straight?
Hopefully they will finally fix the multiplayer ultimate team mismatches. A 70 team shouldn't have to play someone 95.
Ball animations need to be fixed and corners the slant route has never been covered by man coverage since madden 11
Ea in a nutshell= "Now you can put the ball wherever you want just like PATRICK MAHOMES" I honestly think they all have posters of him in there rooms
When they say new animations they talk about the handshakes the olinemen so instead of blocking
Man can we play DB in the FOF?
Roger Goodell and the rest of the NFL owners have made it very clear that they’re satisfied with this trash dumpster fire of a game every year. We’re never gonna get a good football game again 😔
Going to call BS on this so call technology and it's going be some kind of pay to win mechanic
CAN WE GET A GRIDDY
It’s the same thing for FIFA’s hypermotion technology
Here's a thing how about for like 5 or six games put some tech in real player pads and see all the different type of plays and moment
If we all stop buying madden they won’t have a choice but to fix everything🤷🏾‍♂️
Would ya'll PLEASE stop making the same game year after year, after year, after year.
all im gone say is Lamar jackson devante adams McCaffery and other elite players its gone gone be hard to stop these guys But im up for the challenge it looks good the tackling looks better
Still no refs on the field? Lol.
will the PC release be anything near up to par this year?
Imma be real, this is NCAA 2014 but better graphics bro. Literally what we been asking for. The REAL MADDEN PLAYERS
I love how everybody complaining about the people complaining about it doesn’t really talk about the issues the game has but rather the people complaining… I purchased every med in from 1999 till 2021 most of them on the first day the game came out.  It was my favorite game to play up until about 2015.  It had its ups and downs until that point surely there were a few years where I thought it wasn’t very good but after that it just became trash.  I’m not planning on buying until it improves.  It again if you’re someone who enjoys the game then go enjoy it I’m not telling you you should but if you’re going to attack people for complaining about something they put their hard earned money down on and just attack them and not the points that they’re making I guess go ahead you like complaining too!  I didn’t buy it last year I’m probably not going to buy the game this year at one point Ia few years ago I was ranked  in the top 800.   I have no interest in playing online anymore because I think the game is so trash.
frustrating that 60% of game players don’t own a ps5 or xbox series x(forgot the name) but can’t add features that used to be in the game on the ps4/xbox 1
Madden 23 should have a way where you can warm up maybe practice some routs or plays before games in career mode and you can choose different skills to work on before the game and you can get some boosts for the game depending on what skill you work on.
"3500 new animations"  **Proceed to show same animation since madden 18**
خوب هستند
This game will still be broken 🤷‍♂️
Imagine all these features only being on NextGen🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Why on earth would they use the play at 2:00?? My man got shoved out of bounds and then the animation triggers of him walking back on the field as if nothing happened.  This is just sloppy and embarrassing.
Step in the right direction for the last 10 maddens 😂
Lol they went back to the qb vision in old madden
Same game for the 7th year in a row
Man no lie I still see the same animations from 2 years ago the TE look a lil sus passing the linebackers an going straight to CB, why? an i see madden still disappointing as ever talking about have more control over the passing something we had since 2020 if I’m not mistaken. 2k need to gone step in because EA isn’t getting the picture at all.
It’s simple don’t buy the game
2:38  Ancient nfl 2k5, a game released in 2004 btw, has this feature, it's called LEAD PASSING. The ea devs know this, they are hoping that enough gullible sheep don't know that!
$60 for updates that even other greedy developers give out for free.
I’ll never buy madden on its release date. Always gotta check reviews and gameplay first
S**t EA , you always want to take our money .
Amazing how people still play this game  considering you can go back to a madden game over a decade old and have way more fun than this garbage.
No refs no fix huddle break no buy
20 seconds into video and "animation" has already been mentioned twice
Is that suppose to be Russell Wilson in the the thumbnail? Or are we already behind on player likeness patch lol y’all terrible at this
Now leave fieldsense alone and just add to it...... please 🙏🏾
This still looks fake af. C'mon EA..
They probably added 3500 new animations and removed 3500 old animations lol
I hope its better cause Madden 22 is the worst madden Ive ever played
I hope they fix stuff like WR's ACTUALLY being able to catch, low OVR lineman shutting down top tier rushers, AI defense being god mode, fixing and adding more to franchise mode, and not having low OVR QB's win MVP every year
It looks all the same to me
Rip John Madden 🙏
Another roster update. I’m good…
0:47 nothing changed i see that look so fake how the hell he catch the ball with one hand diving without knowing where the ball at 😂😂😂
I think this yr should be the yr to focus on franchise since madden is on the cover, they could make a overhaul of franchise to honor him. But they'll remove 5 more features and give u ultimate team packs with the super super deluxe mega edition instead
Man a lot of this was or is in the game... features taken out then put back in only to be"rebranded". It's a shame this is my only option for simulation football. They (EA)have no self awareness about their game and the communities frustrations with this franchise still. It's very telling when actual NFL players complain about the games football logic in how it's not replicating it's real life counterpart.
nobody buy this game please lets get nfl to drop their contract with ea
🚮🚮🚮🚮
John Madden is probably rolling in his grave, knowing how awful his beloved game has become
Just came here to say you can use this comment as your dislike button.
How much of this stuff is on current gen?
Just paying for another roster update smh
This Looks dope
I thought this was the year refs were returning to the field…
Is this in only next gen
yeah okay, its the same dumb game and morons will still buy it lmfao.
Let's be real we miss seeing how many dislikes 👎 this video has right now 😂😂😂😂
PASS👎👎👎👎
Just imagine the gameplay innovations visual concepts would’ve achieved by now let alone the visual fidelity would’ve been eons ahead of anything EA could do. Nearly 20 years later and I’m still really mad about that Monopoly EA pulled because they’re afraid of competition
Brooooooo when is 2K doing madden ??? This is ridiculous as a madden fan i am tired of seeing the same game. Im definitely not copping this years madden i mideswell play 22 still . Foh.
Copy & Paste
This looks even worse than before tbh
I know this is small but the fact that you can’t separate players on the field like dress code wise really bothers me that all lineman look the same all receivers look the same everyone doesn’t tuck they jersey in everyone doesn’t have compression sleeves on socks are different on all players undershirts are baggy and are longer than the jerseys towel positions I could go on and on I know it’s small but in the grand scheme of the game if that was involved somehow make the game look 1000000000 times better
Lol here we go again. EA I hate you with a passion.
Madden has held football hostage since 2K 5 they hustled everyone for years from little kids that wanted to play with their favorite NFL players and team to the adults who didn't make it to the pros and video games was a way of still having football in their life what a coincidence that now that 2K is going to come out with a new football game they want to fix all their problems and stop making a repetitive copy with an updated roster and some better graphics their heavyweight in the Video Game World because we put them there we had no other choice if we wanted to play football on a system but now that we do have a choice I for one will not be purchasing Madden
Looking very realistic 🏜💪 I’m preordering soon on ps5 I’m gonna do a full season after I’m done on mlbtheshow 21 dbacks franchise, I wouldn’t say I’m unretired from madden I’m just seeing how things are on madden on ps5 🏈
And here we go everybody’s going to complain about how it sucks and then they’re still going to buy it😂😂😂 myself included
EA doesn’t seem to be rewriting the book here. This is the same engine, the same aesthetic, and the same overarching design philosophy SAME SALAD DIFFERENT DRESSING!!!!
Skill based passing was in previous iterations of Madden. No question about it. Hold-up tackle button, was definitely in previous iterations of Madden. All they are doing is bringing back WHAT THEY REMOVED. smh
This should’ve been in the game for years already. It sucks when the play is over too early just because that’s how the animation plays out
This Madden 23 look hell of fun makes me want to play and the graphics are awesome.
Same game. Same animations. Change your GRAPHICS ENGINE
Why the Jersey look so weird
I wish Madden would come back with classic teams and add classic stadiums but that will never happen
Better be this good or u gonna lose alot of money
2:30 This isn't really anything new mechanically. Only thing different is that you can now visually see where you're placing the ball.
Looks like the same madden with new animations
Hey does anyone know how long it takes to get the 99 ovr all in madden 22
Idk,the engine on NCAA 14 was so smooth and realistic. A football game will never top the dynamics of that one
already 15 seconds in and players legs are going into each other???? wow ea wow
Also like other franchise fans have mentioned, what happened to the ‘22 promised updates? The lack of authenticity in the game each year is depressing. Player face scans are rare, gear hasn’t changed in years (in trailer - Kittle has a “white 1/4 sleeve instead of gray padding for ex), lack of classic player fantasy draft or custom create team options like in NBA2K (fyi: EA, 2K does micro trans also but still offer these features). Can’t wait for the new 2K game so there is actual competition!
This Madden 17 update looks siiiick
Can someone please create a new Madden trailer compilation breakdown video? I’ve become so jaded on the annual groundbreaking  “gameplay INSERT BUZZWORD” updates.
Why doesn’t field sense extend into the end zone. This is going to be another disappointment
THEY SHOWED THE SAME ANIMATION AT LIKE TWELVE TIMES JUST TO SHOW HOW PROUD THEY ARE OF THIS ONE THING
Sick.  Now is PC gonna get a real version of a NEW MADDEN ???!
This game is going to be garbage again. Great way to celebrate John maddens life EA. Should be ashamed of yourselves.
EA Sports sure knows how to market a game. Every year they sell a madden game by uttering a bunch of promises and then once we play it we all see how terrible it is. 2k Football where are you? Madden NEEDS COMPETITION 😤 😩
They still don’t got vicis 02 and vicis trench💀😭😭😭
Thought this was madden 22 the whole time
Thought I was looking at Madden 22 until 4:45
I just want a remaster of NFL 2K5😁
This is LITERALLY the same game and features they've had for YEARS just with new marketing fluff! 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Let’s bring back custom play design, offensive and defensive. Let us create offensive and defensive formations.
Screw This Madden Engine. Go back to the PS2 version EA. Gameplay should not be this complicated adding all these gadgets.
EA has no respect for their customers and for john madden.
Looks great ea are the goat i have played madden since 09 and this one looks the best
lol
Looks awesome!
Fix the franchise mode, it sucks
The amount of money you guys make every year. You think you could create a football game actually worth 70 bucks. I'll buy it at 30 and under when it's on sale
For people who don't know the dislikes are a literal landslide! as of now it is 74K dislikes to 17K likes. LMAO!
Xbox, could I please get one?
why tf did the dude hit the ballcarrier in the back of his leg with a pad that was pointless hahaha
I'd rather buy ESPN NFL 2K5
And we noting getting these features on pc why?
" a new foundation for gameplay" glad they made a point to show clips of some issues from 22 and how they approached it this year.  Hopefully it stays consistent, and gameplay remains the focus. Especially in the trenches
Releasing yearly titles has to be the most dated practice in the industry ea never been more clueless and out of touch
I’m skipping this year
BIG L’s
It literally looks the same. Yawn
If anybody buy this same old Copy And Paste game is BEYOND ME
All I want to know is can you play running back in career mode? I like db control at least you can pick more often.
They should fix the money play mechanics and people doing the same play over and over. This has been a problem since madden 2000's. Bring back the cone and real simulation football.
Don`t be fooled by the trailer, its the same game as last year.  Do not buy this copy and paste job. Lazy EA
It's time for EA to put tattoos on Lamar's avatar like OBJ and Mike Evans
since it's only a next gen feature I'm not gonna get the game since I'm on PS4,
So far beta nice but knowing ea soon as it releases going to be nothing like the beta an be broken
I'll wait too after 3 month release .if I decide too buy. for many years Ea has been promising a enjoyable and playable game. 2016 was the last half way decent Madden. you can find Madden 22 at game exchange for  4.99 that says alot
"We made 3,500 new preset animations"  "The outcomes are based on physics"  Which one is it EA, preset animations that get triggered or real time physics? Con artists
Looks fun
It's crazy. I recently went back and played Madden 2007 and it is SO MUCH BETTER. The mechanics and gameplay are undeniably better. The only thing Madden games have had in the past decade, are graphics, otherwise they are borderline unplayable.
If only all this was available for anyone and not just those who are privileged enough to afford an expensive console
Make a basketball game
They need to fix the challenge play abilities your never  allowed  to challenge any play and they should use that 360 for all players at the position
Can't wait for so many B's plays happening
I want NFL 2k
3:03 it’s kinda sad that they JUST now added fade to the corner route in the end zone . NFL 2K had that feature since 2003. I’m happy that it’s finally coming to Madden, but sheesh.
2K5 is still lightyears ahead of this game lmao
This game has been wack since like 05! =).
WHERE THE STREAMER TOWELLLLLL
what about the glitches and a My Player type mode
We we're able to lead passes in Madden 22 the only thing you added was the little circle showing where the ball will end up. Clowns
My biggest problem with this madden is the lack of cusomization options for trans men. I can only indentify as male in madden and its heartbreaking. 💔
"3500+ Animations" keeps showing the same 2. Smh. EA sucks.
The face of the franchise or career mode is always been broken. Is this the year will it be fix? Just in case your not your aware but On career mode you can never hit the free agency or getting a new contract because when your rookie contract is up, it always force you retire. ALL THE MADDEN GAMES ARE THE SAME OUTCOME WHEN PLAYING THIS CAREER MODE. It's been 3 years that I stop buying this game but because I love playing football games, I'll wait for this one on my xbox live game pass to try it out. I bet yah this part of this game is going to be the same. STOP COPYING AND PASTE ON THIS PART OF THE GAME AND JUST DELETE THIS FEATURE IF YOU GUYS NEVER  INTENT TO FIX IT.

Refs on strike?
Same animations
Where did I see this before oh yea nfl 2k5 madden so far behind
I feel like that mid air tackling gone be a problem…
This game is garbage. The only thing they have is player rating  they use to the inflated ego of an nfl players.
So "fieldsense" is making the ai better basically. Because they had no sense for most things of being a realistic game.   The wr dB battles have been in madden for years. Are you adding a few animations and calling that a new feature??   The tackling at high point catches has been in madden for years. Basically anytime you throw a high ball or dead center ball those animations happen every time.   The rb cuts was perfect few years ago so I guess you are recycling that too  The ONLY new feature is the passing mechanics which looks promising. This should be a proud new feature along with something like gee I don't know,  a halftime show or weekly show like NFL 2K5 was like 20 years ago almost.   If you are putting JOHN MADDEN on the cover as an honor, then make it worth while and actually say "hey this year let's actually change the game to make him proud"    Still almost 20 years later and NFL 2K5 is still decades ahead of EA. It's just outright sad man.
Mid air tackles was already a glitchy thing that has been happening in Madden for three years now . They just took control of the animation and called it something.
Oh look. It is literally the same game as last year and the year before that and the year before that and the year before that and the year before that....
Lmao graphics look the same ever since this series debuted on ps4 😂😂😂😂
dislikes are high... 👍👍👍
4:12 definitely looked realistic!!
Did you put jamo in there
So just more animation based outcomes and bad AI again as always. Thanks EA, just what everyone asked for.
It’s VERY promising to me anyways that they’ve got this new passing system in. Being able to dot dimes where I want them instead of the games engine pre doing the trajectories a huge plus. The defense seemingly playing more realistic is a plus. (You can’t outsmart an AI that isn’t smart and doesn’t play correctly). I will say (and I REALLY hope the devs see this note…) IF THE DEFENDER DOESNT SEE THE BALL, DONT LET THEM REACT TO IT! I’m tired of seeing an open receiver just to have a deep safety who’s head is tracking the opposite side of field and hips not turned to correctly defend the play MAGICALLY FLIP FIELD AND HAVE AN INT OR PASS DEFENSE!
DON’T BUY THIS GAME they showed nothing new. How is it going to be madden 23 and you still can’t have tattoos
i can see all the uncomplete catches mid air tackle
So basically more of the same?
Lol crowd doesn’t react
Something isnt right about those shoulder pads
NICE ANOTHER FLOP GAME WITH MICROTRANSACTIONS!!!! NOT PLANNING TO BUY YOU TRASH EVER!!
Are we going to see 2000 written on the field with this same copy paste game
Just stop buying Madden already! 😂
Ea just give it up smh it pathetic
“Field sense” “Phil sims” madden 23 will be a bad game i can tell from this video already 😭😭 terrible graphics with the weather dynamics in the game, players dnt show awareness really nd the mid air collisions look broke already, and we still need a franchise update. U guys keep forgetting about us and we really play the game for the love of football or from either a players perspective or a coaching perspective. We want real football nd us franchise players are not getting it. madden please sell the license
No Madden 08 Part 2 no buy
EA ITS 2023 where is the PRESENTATION MAKE THIS GAME FEEL LIKE A REAL GAME ALL THIS IS OK BUT WE NEED THIS TO FEEL LIKE REAL FOOTBALL 🏈 GAME HALF TIME SHOW PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THEM AMAZING HIGH LIGHTS FROM FROM THE FIRST HALF OR FRANCHISE MODE COME ON YALL
Basically what NBA 2k18 did and it became one of the worst 2k of all time
the only thing i ever wanted from madden was a created player story mode if its just playing football the same ol same ol i dun want it ill just stick with mlb and nba
STOP FORCING ANIMATIONS AND JUST GIVE TRUE PHYSICS
O-Line still missing blocks or not doing anything *sigh*
NFL 2k better
Still no refs🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Can we get pants above tha knees?
Love how they are downplaying the previous madden to hype this year's madden.  This is when you know your product has nothing left to offer. You begin highlighting cons of the previous installments to make the "newest" one, look and sound better.   Just another roster update.
Same garbage different year
I genuinely struggle to find something good about EA sports
I been doin all dis with my left stick
I bought Madden 22 last year solely because it released for the PS5, and I was obviously extremely disappointed. I feel this franchise is too far gone, to the point where they should just rebuild the game from the ground up. I'd love to enjoy Madden again like I did 15-20 years ago, but I just don't see it happening. EA is just too profit driven. The passion isn't there and hasn't been for quite a long time.
For all we know, this could be Madden 2022 and none of us would be the wiser
They make it look decent but still when you watch ACTUAL gameplay that’s already out, it literally just looks & plays the same. Oh btw. Still no refs lol
these features are 15 years too late.
Game still looks awful 😖. Physics tackles, but yet to show a different tackle. EA is trash
Game is flopping ! Nope I don’t want it
So basically they bringing back target passing from madden 18??
Yo you thought we had dropped passes before wait until this years game.
@1:34 the defenders literally ran into each other on the slants underneath as they would in madden 22 leaving BOTH A and Y open for the first down. the entire game engine needs a revamp
Wish I could see the thousands of dislikes on this video lol
Bring back Legands All the Great NFL players like matt hasselback and brett farve
Is it half a game?
Y’all just admitted to cheating you literally said at the 2:20 mark and 47 second mark you felt the game decided TO MUCH ON THE OUTCOMES !!!! You coded that nobody else
It's cool if it didn't look like the WR is just THROWING THE BALL OUT OF THEIR HAND
madden is a joke 😂
We all know it just sounds good, it’ll be broken when it comes out like madden22,21,20
The ai offense in all madden is gonna be unstoppable😂
Sucks they won’t have this for pc
You should make a virtual video game to realistic it will ruin the game for a lot of people
When is 2k releasing there football game?
Oh this field sense thing looks cool maybe the game will be good *Sees that field sense is only for xbox series x/s* *Me with my xbox one s:*
3:53 db in face of the franchise 😁
For anyone not using the show dislikes extension, this video has 6.7k likes to 18k dislikes lol
Yall should stick to sport games like madden and 2k yall did a horrible job with ufc 4
Where is Create-A-Team?
At least it looks like they’ve listened and are trying to work on some of our complaints. I’m still skeptical tho.
I just don't understand why only release the FieldSENSE for PS5 and XBOX. What's the difficulty to release for PC as well? (Genuine question)
When will we get blitz 23 ? Because madden has shown the same.
Wait a minute here….so it’s the same exact game again? Why does this keep happening? It’s a endless loop and it will never change.
I just want to be able to turn off the momentum BS at the top of the screen.
please don’t just have all this for next gen
Didnt they do this whole throw where you want your reciever to be a few years ago? and took it out the very next game ?
Translation... "Thanks for the money again idiots"
3:09 4:16 proves your game is still broken and that the defense is still broken  REAL FOOTBALL AND MADDEN PLAYERS CAN DISSECT THOSE 2 time sectors and see what I’m talking about 😂😂😂  COMMENT ARE FOOL OF BOTS
Is this gameplay from Madden 22?
You’ve had the same animations for 10 years lmao
People will still buy this broken game
Same game bruh
Madden 18 looks great!
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates  🟥
This is madden 07!!!!!!!
It’s a good step in the right direction
Yea that’s great! … BUT what’s going on with Franshise Mode though! 😄
Ever since Madden 25, the game hasn’t changed. Sports games are hitting their peak
Madden: “We want it be authentic”  Also Madden: Certain players have superpowers
This is Maddens fancy way of saying: Ragdoll Animations. Something older maddens had
It's interesting that you distract the player with a different tackling mechanism while the AI is literally doing the same thing it's been doing year after year.   Linebackers standing still in a zone, cornerbacks getting turned 360 on a stop route, and YOU'RE STILL ANIMATION HEAVY. Physics go out the window when the players feel like they're floating. 'Backbreaker' had the same issue but at least the players had weight and the tackles and impacts felt different every single play.
Is franchise mode getting a rework?
Won’t the mid attack be dpi tho
Madden 22.5
Slightly better graphics with the worst additions. How lazy are you people, hell outta here
If framchise mode doesnt have sufficient updates im just not buying this garbage...fix madden
Can’t wait to hear what soft drink TV has to say I haven’t bought Madden since 2017 stay strong people
I haven’t bought madden since 2015..this actually looks good, it’s not perfect but is anything perfect? I see a lot of improvements, I’m sure there’s more to come but I appreciate their efforts so far.
Lmao still no referees on the field yeah more realistic gameplay
Lmao still no referees on the field yeah more realistic gameplay
Like A wise man said in another madden comment section “Madden 18 looks really good this year”
The most important question is IS THE GRIDDY IN MADDEN 23
3,500 new animations. *3,500!* Imagine if that money and time was used to develop a modern physics engine that would create an almost infinite amount on outcomes with little predictability. They're still going in the right direction, but we've been saying that for years now.
Not one grass stain on a Jersey or pants smh.
It’s a trick hear this every year just in a different way
Still giving out Beta codes?  PS5 here.
Man they playing on simulation ! Put it on competitive and show the real footage
Any new emotes?
Is this gonna be current n next gen?😳  Either way its 🔥 but both gen’z deserves it and ii seen sum mistakes in this clip like when the TE missed his block at 23 ran clean pass him thats bad
Idk man I still need to play it unfortunately.
Ya and all of this is for nexgen
Wonder if the RBs still get stuck on the OL/DL when sent on a short out, then ice skate in place for 3-4 seconds on them?  Its been happening for the past 4 games and It’s EA, so OF COURSE that will still happen. 🤮
Please give me a code
looks like every other madden
Every year we just get “new mechanics” but the game is always the same
This shi hard asf not gone like
Did you guys fix scripted interceptions yet?
Can the o line push the ball carrier in the end zone??
The only thing that I’m genuinely excited for is 360 cuts cause moving in between the line has been terrible
Shut tf up.stray away from our spots.
Add more to franchise mode please. More stories for draft prospects, actual coordinators on teams and no bs game created coordinators.
Send madden 23 beta code ps5
Looks good now add more teams to play now and add customization in franchise
Whoa, EA is still relevant?
meanwhile, PC gets neglected again with the same old game and no next gen anything
we been hearing this for years..
I cant tell if this is a joke or they are being serious
1:52, the ai defender just sitting there with literally no one around staring into the distance O_O
So what im hearing is i can just keep throwing PA Deep Outs and consistently keep hitting deep passes
So yall really used footage of your ai messing up a ton XD
I'm doing this in ESPN 2K5!!!!
it would be amazing to also add depth to the game in franchise mode
I think we need more things in franchise
😂I know they didn’t jus say 3500 animations cmon now WE ALLLL KNOW that’s false
Can we get current gen gameplay 🤓
Looks the same
So does this mean another year of PC players playing the old gen game? Come on...
Okay, now show us the real gameplay
Is this trailer going to get to 70K+ dislikes like your "Madden 23 Official Reveal Trailer | Introducing FieldSENSE"?
what about the dances ? add helmet popping off again please
we don’t care about your new animations just get a physics engine
What about the QB’s high rumble rate
Perfect......
What about current gen are we gonna get the same game play as next gen?
EA going in the right direction but will it be enough?
The whole point of the game is to make it as close to the real nfl as possible. Yet the first thing we see in this video is Marlon Humphrey a top 5 CB also a proven tackler getting destroyed by one Nick Chubb. Don’t get me wrong Nick Chubb is a monster but Marlo will put him on his back every time. Com’on madden y’all gotta do better.
BELIEVE NOTHING... DO NOT PRE ORDER
There's some good things here, but we've all been tricked before
Add ESPN Contract
How about add new commentary. The same commentary from madden 17 is absolutely lazy, and it’s so repetitive.
Can’t wait 😊😊😊
Nice their selling us the same game again…this gotta be the last year EA has madden
OJ Howard isn’t on the Bucs anymore 😂
"3500+ new animations" and we'll see the same 6.  Also, he said "3500+ animations" and "based on physics". Based on the same engine I think we know it's largely animations.  Also heard these features won't be on pc. That's sad.
PLEASE ADD THE GRIDDY TO RHE GAME!!!🤩
Just stop with madden games already
I agree that some of the things need fixing/adding. But i feel like this is already getting too much hate. It deserves some hate, but not a lot. Plus, they can still make it better and add more stuff in the next 4 or 5 months
three josh allen's hitting each other. not realistic. 2/10.
I like this but the graphics need a ton of work
The only thing I worry about is the 360 cuts being too overpowered to where we can’t tackle anybody because they keep breaking our ankles
Forget madden where is college football at?
Do they have towel and handwarmer updates Like towels in rear and middle
I see the PC players get screwed again.
Gotta say havn't played madden in years, but this looks finally like 1 worth playing
Add more customization options
is this available only on new gen consoles or on all?
Bet its only for next Gen consoles haha
I wonder how SDTV feels about this
the cutting in NCAA 14 was the best. Hopefully this year is closer to that
This is madden 21,22 with field sense lmaooo 😒
You aren’t getting my money this year no sir not even a single penny!!!!??
this look worse
Can they be sued for copy and paste tactics at this point?
Nah who was getting blown out 27-0😭
a step above last year so far but madden 22 was a sad excuse of a simulation  game so that isnt saying much
Madden 23 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Y shallow cross is still probably broken
This is great and all but why doesn't Lamar have his tattoos 🤔
2:36 just shows how bad the tackling is
Let’s see, just wait until reliable sources review the gameplay to see if it’s legit
Let’s go!
All I want is draft logic fixed in franchise mode. I’m tired of seeing Kansas City draft a quarterback in the first round. I’m tired of teams with young franchise quarterbacks draft a quarterback in the first round
THIS GAME IS NOT DRIVEN BY PHYSICS LIE AGAIN EA, NOTHING BUT ANIMATIONS HOLDING THIS GAME TOGETHER GO LOOK AT BACKBREAKER FOOTBALL OR HOW ABOUT YOU GO BACK TO MADDEN 25, 17,18 FOR A PHYSICS DIVEN GAME ENGINE, oh I forgot YOU CANT CAUSE YOU SWITCHED ENGINES AFTER 18 FROM IGNITE ENGINE TO TRASH FROSTBITE WHICH TOOK YOU YEARS BACK WHICH ALSO MADE THE GAME ANIMATION DRIVEN YALL ARE THE MOST IGNORANT DEVELOPERS I KNOW
I know I’m not the only one who thinks the numbers and jerseys look goofy. Or maybe it just the new body types they added
WE DONT LIKE ANIMATIONS
Take notes from Backbreaker Football tackling engine
Let’s gooooooo
Ngl this looks .........  Exactly the same as last year
I'll believe it when I see it. I'm happy they acknowledged how animation heavy the game is and are trying to make it more physics based a dynamic, but we'll have to see if it's half baked as usual.
They did all of nothing...Madden 16 is still better than this
Sheesh, I feel like we had all this before and they just took it out and putting it back and calling it NEW
2:23 so there actually aware the passing in their game was awful 😂😂😂
I’d love to play Next Gen on my PC. What a shame.
This games looks like madden 16 7th edition EA ur sad🤦🏾‍♂️
All these new animations but the qb throwing animations still look like 🗑
Stop making games.
Oh 2 men tackles 🤣🤦🤣👌
Someone needs to fire everyone of u
Stop making games
Lmaooo it looks the same as madden 22
That spam X/A feature is gonna be awful, I can already see it, button mashing has no place in a sports game imo
Having played the beta this how potential to be the best madden ever. People complaing without even playing it yet.  I dont always see eye to eye with EA but this game is good.
Will field sense still be on current gen
I really hope they don't forget to include jump ball catch animations for WR's its not too late!!!!!!
I see coverage is still hot garbage though
I hope you can blow up the QB
TRASH, SCREW OFF MADDEN, NEVER TAKING MY MONEY AGAIN.
IN A SIMULATION FOOTBALL GAME, THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS GAMEPLAY AND FRANCHISE MODE! MAKE A TOTALLY SEPARATE GAME FOR ALL OF THESE OTHER ARCADE MODES. YOU CAN MAKE A BLITZ THE LEAGUE TYPE OF GAME THAT HAS A STORY MODE, ECT.
“We’ve added 3500+ new animations” awesome can’t wait to only ever see the same 5 animations like always though.  “360 cuts give you total control” that’s not something you should be bragging about. That should be the bare minimum standard.
This looks nearly identical to Madden 2022. The devs should be ashamed of this hot garbage.
Now that you guys are finally making gameplay dynamic.  You can now add referees so the game is more authentic.  Please continue to make franchise great with controlling concession stand prices  go back to create your own stadium and team. I actually may finally have a reason to buy madden after 4-6 yrs ago.
So two new animations
It’s like madden goes out their way to add things in the game nobody asks for😂
i really hope that with the air tackling cause it already sound like it going to be broken but it also reward receivers who have strong hands and are good at catching the ball in the air and not dropping it
PLEASE BRING BACK CLASSIC ROSTERS THAT WE CAN PLAY IN FRANCHISE MODE! TY!
Y’all used half of these cutscenes in last years reveal… MAKE A GOOD GAME
Madden desperately needs some competition..
Those Commanders Jersey are 🔥
That's cool, but update franchise
When this is all true I will feel so bad for buying 22 as my first Madden
Madden is going to be good now we get fresh new animations
Heard it all before believe it when I see it, also fix the blocking
The jersey numbers look so whack their two big!!!
You can hit wr's wasn't this taken out of the NFL years ago???
only on ps5 and series x/s?????? really bruh
Looks like madden 22 🤦🏽‍♂️, just with a circle around when you pass🗑. Disappointed
1:27 get rid of that fumble animation!
The gameplay looks super clunky and awkward. Nothing looks smooth and the AI acts the same lol
Soooo y’all knew madden 22 was trash with unrealistic game play and pre determine throws if it’s going to be complete or INT and you guys still put it out? That says a lot about y’all.
I think the biggest issue is fixing the safety issues. Mahomes to Tyreke hill or Murray to Hopkins. You can play overtop Cover 3 and they still get behind the safeties… I talk all this stuff but, I still play it…But I won’t enjoy it.
Scary terry has an X factor. Let’s go!
Nothing has changed.
Field sense doesn’t even cover the end & javonte Williams is frozen in place while rolls out kelce warps threw a raiders defender 3 defenders cover grass no awarness on Hopkins same ol BS pay attention ppl you can still see it they can’t even hide this broken game you guys are getting tricked to buy
all this and still couldn’t even get Russ helmet right he wears a Zero2 not a Zero1, ima equipment head i notice all this little stuff
"35000000000000000000000000000000 new animations" then continues to show the same animations we saw last year, and the year before that.
All this just to see an undersized rb stumble 10 yards forward after contact
i hate that ea thinks a gang tackle is two guys hitting the other guy. you rarely see less than 4 guys hitting the ball carrier
Gosh the player molds are bad. PS3 was just better.
This sounds really good and seems like you've made necessary changes, but it's all been said before in previous titles. I'll have to wait and see after release to determine whether this will be the first madden I've bought in 5 years.
Bring back create a fan
Is there all time teams?
How do you not upload this in 60fps? Smh
How are you going to show a play @ 0:23 where the te just runs past 2 blocks?!. You think we aren’t going to notice that??
Mid-Air Tackles & Pass Break-ups was in NFL 2K5 now EA is advertising it as a new feature in 2022. EA need to do the right thing and just put this as a Day 1 Game Pass release. They are gonna make their money back on MUT anyway.
Still looks bad
The fact that it took madden 23 to do what backbreaker football did in 2008 is baffling.  They only doing this cause the player base shrunk like crazy in madden 22
it'll be terrible. nothing will compare to ps2 maddens. can't wait for the 2k game!
Looks like the same game as last year
If you buy this game. You’ve played yourself. Send that $60 to a charity instead. It will be so much better for you & someone else.
😂😂😂Promises Promises just to be let down every year
Love to hear abt the new animations. Just hope it isn't buggy
Still no refs on the field I’m out forget this
Bro y'all gotta stop falling for EA every year
Who miss the days When you could see how many dislikes a madden trailer would get😂😂😞
Still no joe burrow x factor
Wait did madden just admit something they did wrong 2:25
I ain’t falling for it. You are bringing back thinks that used to be in the game
I thought way back madden already had that thing where you could control the wr and do juke moves to get open
Looks exactly the same lol
SO THE WR VS DB IS ONLY GOOD WHEN U HAVE A TOP RECEIVER AGAINST A TOP CORNER...I MEAN A TOP RECEIVER WILL BURN A SCRUBBY CORNER,RIGHT
So basically with tackling they finally caught up to NFL 2K5 and that's a maybe. LOL
Can you actually change the commentators and change the scouting
Wonder if genuinely catching the ball aggressively will work on a db and it doesnt get knocked out everytime
WHAT HAPPENS IF URE LEFT THUMSTICK IS BROKE AND U CANT DO THE PRECISE PASSING....
I smell more bs, shame on you EA sports, can’t even get a real nfl player for animation
Trash
The blocking is still broken, I saw so many missed blocks where Line backers just shed the block and the blocker continues to run to the next person (corner or safety) ... That's cool we have more precise passing, but blocking is literally the backbone of offense if you're going to run the ball, so this whole new system for running will just be useless. I want to back this game so badly but year after year the most important things aren't fixed.
@ 2:36 in a slowed down version it looked like the defensive back legit goes through Travis Kelce 😂
Offensive Lineman still act clueless down the field... BRO DO THEY EVER CHANGE ANYTHING IN THIS GAME
yall are doing too much with that passing shi
What’s crazy is this stuff only going to be for next gen game play not current gen
This new timing based animation system is the opposite of what Madden needed to do
Im never gonna buy a madden game day 1 ever again madden 18 to 22 so far have been awful. We will see if they can redeem themselves
Does this not look like 2k8?
Is this only for P5?
We don’t want more animations!! We want physics!!
So what you’re telling me is…. It’s the same game….
At least their getting somewhere
Why does it feel like all the same features but different names? I dunno why keep buying this. I play less and less every year.  It's like I'm still playing 2017-2018 but prettier graphics.
I hope at 3:10 the coverage reacted like that only to show the skill based passing because I see the safety and corner not recognize a receiver getting into an open zone. Ima just hope it was for teaching purposes.
ima be throwing dimes only ong
Sill not impressed 🥱
When will EA ever care for Madden? Every year it looks more and more like a mobile game. EA pretends like they fixed everything, but in reality they fixed nothing. DON’T BUY THIS GAME!
So we’re just gonna act like we didn’t see the defense barely react to anything? That pass to Kelce against the Raiders was a joke, the corner didn’t even react to him running right next to him.
Josh Allen tackling Josh Allen with the help of Josh Allen
Why they won't use any of the network score bugs is beyond me..
It looks the same
Lol really hate that Youtube hid the dislikes smh
i dont think i saw one new tackle animation
Don’t like the throwing
So madden 18 all over again lmao
This might bring a huge skill gap in passing…..imagine the throws u could make like Aaron Rodgers throws in double coverage on the money…..with practice u could destroy anyone out there but again this prob wont be the case
Sounds good.
Check out 0:05, I don't even need to watch this gameplay trailer from the sorry excuse that is EA. OJ Howard isn't even on the BUCS anymore! He's on the BILLS! Really goes to show how good EA's "Attention to detail is", smh
I ain't gone lie this the first time I've said this in maybe 20 years...  Madden looks FIYA!!
If Stafford doesn’t get abilities than this game has already failed!
This a W
Good to see running backs are still getting bunched up with the O-Line at 2:50
Looks the same
hopefully the animation where the DB jumps 10 feet in the air is gone
1:20 never thought I hear about physics in madden.
So when is my Beta Code coming?
Make franchise great again
4.6k likes to 6.5k dislikes  Good work everyone
I hate how this is only next generation and current generation gets nothing
So they know how bad 22 was in everyway and are just saying hey it got fixed for this game, even when we all know it will be the same as before
Shows they don’t wanna compete. This is due or die for them since 2K is coming out with a game of their own. If they lose money, that’s when they’ll step up!
Yea we gone see mf
all of this sounds good but i don’t trust EA
NEW THROWING ANIMATIONS OR DID YOU FORGET AGAIN
NEW THROWING ANIMATIONS OR DID YOU FORGET AGAIN
NEW THROWING ANIMATIONS OR DID YOU FORGET AGAIN
NEW THROWING ANIMATIONS OR DID YOU FORGET AGAIN
NEW THROWING ANIMATIONS OR DID YOU FORGET AGAIN
But fundamentally this is the same game and your cries have not been heard.
Most of us complaining but still gonna buy the game 😭
On paper this is looking fantastic as far as gameplay goes, however the execution can still and probably will be butchered. Besides that we haven’t seen anything new in the features department, specifically franchise mode, is it functional, have the bugs and glitches been fixed, has it been fleshed out. So much work needs to be done before this franchise can even have a glimpse of promise .
0:04 OJ Howard (80 for the Buccaneers) doesn't even play for us anymore
Ready to throw throw thousands of interceptions ✊
I SEE A LOT OF TGE SAME ANIMATIONS INCLUDING YOUR PATHETIC THROWING ANIMATIONS
Fix the corners and LBs just standing in the endzone and watching opposing players walk in
Please make graphics on pc better. And give pc next gen features
@2:00 players have already been tackling like that in 22
No more escape artist 😢
They were talking about a fade route then cut It off because the ball didn't look like it had enough touch for the route
I won’t say EA has never disappointed me, but I do like what I see. The game is still in beta too so I’m not gonna judge too hard until I try it myself.
Useful
Thank you ea for listening to the issues we had if you keep this up and don’t ruin anything this year this may be the best game ever made
Nick chubb cannot stiff arm marlon humphrey
So still a 2 man tackle game smh
I just don't want to play a Franchise where Drew Lock is rated 97. Can I help you develop a Franchise mode AI where it actually lets the likes of Steve Keim drop Quarterbacks and draft new ones?
I did not see any diving tackles, only players running into each other and dragging each other to the ground. There is no oomph to the tackles.
Playing against running QB's is gonna be hell lmao
All of these “new” features are from previous maddens.  Madden 08 has the tap button to break a tackle.  I care about franchise so how about you show what’s in that.  Probably a copy and paste with a different color tint for the UI
Lol, no refs once again.
Why you lying????  WE ALL KNOW that accurate back-shoulder passes will still get intercepted by a cb jumping 10ft in the air while being nowhere near the wr.
All I heard was animations. Great, more ways for the game to screw us over
I’m not gone lie this looks terrible and like they barely did anything best football game ncaa 14
How we feeling?
they need to tone down abilities like inside stuff and no outsiders to where they don't activate every single play like they do now because it's not realistic that those abilities can dictate people no longer running the ball
I just want to know if there’s new commentary 🥲
Still the same qb animations👌
I hope the defensive knockouts aren’t too OP because every single example they showed honestly would’ve been a td irl
Looks pretty good
3:53 I’m soooooo excited for this 😍😍😍
Let me guess this will all be for the next gen and the past gen will be stuck with the same game
Meanwhile while this is on next gen only on old gen it will be the same as 22
Nahhh bruh they made made the players look like they from madden mobile
no way this is real right now right? lololol please just give the rights up. it's amazing yall are bashing your own game to try and lift this one up. we're like 10 years in from the last decent game. 10 more doesn't seem too far fetched
The commanders is probably the biggest new thing tbh lol
Where the refs, this isn’t football
This looks so promising
defense will be broken
pathetic
Fix the pads on the players make sure running looks authentic players have more mass on the field offense vs defense should have better physics qb needs an authentic animation of throwing the ball lest but not least the players should have awareness and reaction to everything happening on the field
Sooo is no one gonna talk about how Josh Allen is helping Josh Allen taking out Josh Allen??? Maybe this is the future of Madden lol
Here is some constructive criticism.  How about yall stop buying rights to the NFL. Competition breeds innovation,  and your game shows clearly why having the exclusive right is a very bad thing.
Y’all got teambuilder? That’s real power to the players
Same commentators for the 7th in a row I'll pass
Looks good but I don’t expect of any it to work when the game drops
This looks really promising
It looks the same as Madden 22
You can clearly see Travis Kelce glitched through the corner lol
Jerseys and pads look a lot better now
What about FIELDSENSE In the Endzone, it is just horrendous animations and defenders don’t know what they’re doing there. You guys only showed FIELDSENSE on the football field, not retched end zones…
Copy and paste I'm not buying madden 23 it's going to be the same as madden 22 same game play just new features
Looks like they're trying to make a good game!! But that's also what I said last year
So marlon Humphrey just gonna run up to nick Chubb without breaking down to tackle and get stiff armed?
Ive seen the same branch tackle like 4 times already .
The only way EA makes up for same old Madden gameplay. Is by adding more REALISTIC and AUTHENTIC pregame PRESENTATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! @EASPORTS
Ah, great, more animations that aren't actually physics-based, gotta love that fake "simulation" football...
They deadass showed the same tackle animation 8 times
Do players ratings matter? Or can I still throw 50yrds touchdown with a offensive lineman?
Like what I'm seeing so far!
How they coming up with new stuff every year. But it the shi we been asking for years
🤡🤡🤡
Every year madden gets harder and harder
Looks promising but I am very prepared to be let down for the same exact reasons 😏😔
Now I need to see the Defense have some field SENSE
I don’t see anything definitely from older games just rinse and repeat
Why can you only be five positions in face the franchise!!!!
I’m gonna be honest. Have these ads on Competitive game mode, not sim and let’s see how the game will actually play
What’s with the jerseys why they look glitched 💀
the only new accessory is the towel behind? no loose long sleeves? no long undershirt? can we PLEASE get someone dedicated to accessories?? can we change how we wear socks? if not main game then FORSURE on the yard PLEASE.
Trash
Well, still the same thing as every other year. Football
Celebrations after scoring TD’s needs to be re done. Look at FIFA’s goal celebrations, they look so real, they actually have their teammates coming to congratulate them or celebrate with them. I don’t understand how  madden can’t do these small things. I bet Aaron Rodgers doesn’t even have his one strap helmet, something sooo small but bet he doesn’t have it. Get the small things right…
They need to stop focusing on graphics and presentation. We get it guys, you have the best graphics and it looks amazing. How about you work on fundamentals, like physics and controls. Backbreaker had physics based tackling a decade ago. When I control a LB in Madden if feels like I'm fighting with the AI to let me take over. I hope this Madden is a good one.
look at this bs 😂😂you cant hide a trash game EA its not cool
They’re not even hiding it. They’re letting you know the entire game is animation based.
Bring back madden moments, a more creative weather setting, as well the ability to play with classic teams!  Also player intros
Wow I was super duper excited in the first half of the video, with the "Hit Everything" but then the second half of the video looked like all old animation tackles lol...hmmmm suspicious.
Make it crossoksy
Madden 06>Madden 23
2:48 Look Fournette😂
The skilled passing thing looks awfully familiar to something they tried to implement a few years back but didn’t work at all because you can’t be mobile with the Qb while doing It.
4:17-4:21 shows the defense is still broken lol
So this is all Next-Gen?
Also adjustments need to work properly and play challenge needs to be a thing and not be locked out
Last years madden was the least I’ve ever played madden. Imma wait til I hear if it’s good or not.
Until linebackers and other players play as they should and not leave wide open catches on slants or a 20 yd cross route. The madden 22 issues still exist.
I see the same game man…same animations when getting tackled…the player look stiff and still you guys out this out cmon EA
Either y’all are still gonna buy it I might buy it but I’m gonna wait to see how it actually turns out in a month
I see no difference 🤷🏻‍♂️
1:32 you already have defensive players crashing into each other at the middel of the field... you guys dont even care what you show on the gameplay trailer
when a ball gets broken up can it just hit the ground instead of turning into a balloon for 10 seconds
Hit everything= hit stick. It's been in the game forever. Skill based passing=total control passing. Again another feature that was in previous maddens years ago. 360° and cuts disguised as "new mechanics" ? Again they're things that have been implemented in previous Maddens. When's 2k hitting the shelves again?
BRING THE EUPHORIA ENGINE TO MADDEN!!! look at the game called backbreaker. Every single hit is unique and never like another. Euphoria engine is what the GTA v game uses.
Create a team?
I do feel like this game is going to be the best gameplay wise in a while but tackles after the catch look rough still. The mid air knockouts are good but there are no physics or reason for any of the tackling directly after a catch
I mean im looking at an anime based gamed that's a big problem right there i understand there's has to b animated tackles but everything dosnt has to b a animation
Cool story but we still playing NFL 2k5 over this
Stop buying this trash!!
they showed the same double team tackling animation 100 times claiming it was different
Look the same
NOT PLEASED. SO MUCH MISSING FROM THIS GAME, WHERE DO WE START......
Y’all remember target passing??
2 man tackles. So in Madden 24 it will be 3 man tackles? lol
And somehow NFL 2k5 STILL looks better than this lmao
Y’all have 3 months to fix this game man   Do something with the announcers and sleeves   Nobody wants to Listen to the same annoying announcers every year
Cool, this wasn't in Madden 22 lmfao!!
why is Najee Harris so big 😂?
🥱🥱🥱🥱
Lemme catch the code why not
Why are the jerseys so wrinkled get an iron out there
Why is Josh Allen getting stacked by his own players? lol 🗑️
I actually think this game will be pretty good
where is the dislike button when you need it most?
Why do I feel like average NFL DBs still gon play like 2nd string high schoolers? 😂
Now the real question is, is field sense in the pc version or only next gen consoles because ea is a bunch of lazy bitchboys
How did the graphics get worse  And it's way less smooth
why was josh allen tackling josh allen? 😂
Bro it’s the same madden as before 😂😂 man wake me up when the next NFL 2k drops because I’m not wasting my money on another copy and paste game
bring cross plat
THIS IS AWESOME!!!
So it’s just 2k but in madden 😢
2:35 Yes as the DB spins in place and just watches Kelce catches a pass.
Haven’t seen physic in this trailer at all just animations if they on the frost bite engine game gon be weak again
THEY CAN ACTUALLY TACKLE thats a sensible reason to actually buy it!
Can someone please tell me how much is it going to cost what canoles is going to be on and when it's coming out
It looks the exact same but they make the animations that’s already in the game happen more often
EWWW bruh y the movment and ball in the air look so slow and sluggish
I love when a WR gets his legs touched in the air so the ball automatically pops out..
The 369 cuts has some potential
The 369 cuts has some potential
EA being EA, describing features all fancy like to make them sound new, when we all know these features were/should've been in the game YEARS ago. How about updates to franchise? Return of classic teams? Better halftime shows and presentation in general? Can we have new commentators with new dialogue?
Let’s go
360 cuts and passing placement is a good step just hate the reycled stuff.
Okay so another year where aggressive catches aren’t in the game 😂🤦‍♂️
You know. This actually looks pretty good (to me of course) it’s just gonna matter how this game is played once it comes out
This looks awesome ea!! thumbs up from me
bring next gen to pc, thanks
WE NEED MORE RELOCATION TEAMS/CUSTOMIZATION
can’t wait for my ai players to stare down lamar jackson as he runs freely into the endzon😑
Looks the same to me
I need to see the gameplay
2:24 so 1 foot out can still be an interception?
So basically the trailer is just explaining how bad their game last year was?
R.I.P Jon Madden 😭😭😭😭😭😭 Jon we miss you
Thanks Ea
Josh Allen helping Josh Allen tackle Josh Allen
Lmao the older games on PS2 have BEEN doing this without giving it some fancy name. Madden has been trash, just give it up guys.
so basically any qb can be Tom Brady now. just great.... and the 360 cuts were not needed....that definitely will be overpowered and abused
Shouldn't this new stuff already be in.......... Nevermind.
Idk if they already talked about it but I feel you shouldn't have to win a tackle battle against a opposing defender like bobby wagner
PLEASE DO A BETTER JOB WITH FOTF THIS YEAR!!!
Field Sense not in the TouchDown area ?
What about The Yard??????????
“We are just getting started” find out what else we have And stored a year from now and a year from that and the next year after that
This game doesn't get you excited at all. They copy and paste. They never disappoint with disappointing
Fieldsense nonsense
Looks like madden 22 to me😭
Can we have franchises with lineman or fullbacks
All this to be saying they cheating more
If they really felt confident in this system they’d show us a full half of gameplay. No cuts, just raw gameplay of what they have
Yall are forgetting about PC players again
Where is 2k football at?
Yawn 🥱 same trash different year.
Tip interceptions all year
No point getting this game if its next gen only with Fieldsense. PC should have that option as well to pick which version of the game they can get
I like this ngl
Is the Griddy going to be in madden because my friend said it is
I can’t believe people keep falling for this bs every year. I can’t even feel bad for people who scammed by EA every year
MUT squad gonna be lit with the wr cut moves
I’m sticking to madden 07 and any madden on Xbox 360 lol
Only on Xbox and Playstation... sick. So PC players basically get Madden 21 3.0! So cool EA.
Bet it’s gonna have the same main menu as the last 2 years
Marcus Peters has a dope face scan!!! 1:18
Looks like a nice improvement but this isn't $60 worth to buy again.
Thats cool but most of those things are gonna be on next gen only which the only people that have next gen is 30% of the madden community
Ok so you just admitted your game was trash last year and you guys didn't even try to fix it last year
At 3:12, the free safety is still sitting in his deep half flat footed despite the fact that the QB is throwing the ball to the wide open guy on the skinny post! @ryanmoody21 this is garbage!
2:36 the cpu on defense went dumb
NO ONE PRE ORDER. ITS THE ONLY WAY THEY WILL CHANGE. DONT LET THEM FOOL YOU THIS WILL ALL BE RECYCLED BS ONCE THE GAME IS OUT.
My favorite team Washington looking good 🔥❤️💛
pls ea listen to the fans
Madden fans are like a person in a bad relationship.  They wanna leave but lie to themselves because they’re used to bs
I hope PC gets these features
This game been bad 4 yrs let 2 k make this game
Madden loves bringing back old features and claiming they are new 🤣
So are you going to fix the animation where the WR jumps and catches the ball and then the corner back knocks out the ball at the less second
Like how they take old stuff and just re name it and call it new
why do the jersey numbers look so scuffed
Yall talked all that passing but still cant throw a lob fade route...... this been going on since madden 98
Animations have scripted outcomes. We just need physics based gameplay. 3500+ new animations just means 3500+ new scripted outcomes.
Are you kidding me?!!! That could be the best madden ever
Trash
So whats changed? Still looks like the same exact Maddens we have had for years. Ill pass on this one EA.
Soooo the entire first half of this was the exact same tackle being showed over and over and over again. Of the 3500 new animations y’all could show any new animations that differ from madden 2018-2022? Guess not. Also hasn’t that cutting system already been in the game like 2 times in the past 6 years or something? And the new passing mechanics is basically the precision passing that we’ve had since 2006 but the difference is you can actually see the target and the circle. If you gave us realistic pass trajectories we wouldn’t need this.
Welp back to the running game. Passing gonna be impossible this year
Josh Allen helping Josh Allen tackle Josh Allen
Fieldsense give me fifa vibes like they had hypermotion that’s a big W madden
No tattoos, they should add loose jerseys like non tucked, and the Kyler Murray sleeves
Every year they never fail to disappoint me in making this game more trash
So you guys made a whole new Gamplay System for the latest Madden, but it's only going to be on Series X and PS5???  Meanwhile the other 3 systems are left with the same BS from M17-22. Okay.
I do like how they are trying to make it more run heavy bc I feel people were doing one play passing td plays a lot. Sure there are ways to stop it but if you slipped once it’s a td. I hope they fixed the broken d line abuse because a edge rusher breaking a double team faster than I’d last with Megan fox is ridiculous.
Post a 💩 emoji if you think EA is 💩.
Bring Current Generation to PC. 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
EA releases Broken games. They also cater to console gamers. We need EA to go broke. Boycott EA.
Shame on you EA. PC players should get the current Generation Madden. Not last years version. Price is exactly the same. PCs are way more powerful than consoles. Shame on you. Boycott EA until the bring current Generation Madden to PC.
Hey EA when does 2k madden come out!  EA sucks!
My dad’s gonna get a stroke trying to understand all this 💀
How come all the other sports games have refs but Madden can’t? The field looks empty without them
I know yall will never give madden their credit and i dont blame yall madden has been complete garbage since madden 25 but im genuinely hyped for this one tho cause the most frustrating thing in the gameplay for me was the passing game and this new manual passing thing might improve it alot
And still no refs on the field 🤷🏻‍♂️😂
Huge W! Just continue to put more of this type of stuff in the gameplay. Start nailing the small details in football and everyone will fall back in love with madden.
Fix franchise
How about make defenders more used to plays that are spammed over and over. This would help solve spamming scrubs and also make the game more fun
The new jersey models look good
It’s gonna be broken
I’m not buying it until a few weeks pass and if there’s anything like escape artist or broken defense y’all can’t have fun I’m out 💀
They bettwr give us equipment like real nfl
Wait, they have physics and over 3500 animations added but we had to see the same exact two man tackle multiple times in this trailer...something doesn't add up.
Looks cool but the players look so slim and small. So do their numbers
This is gonna be the best game
Stop screwing over PC players
THIS LOOKS AWFUL Every time a pass is thrown Lbs stand still Don't let them fool us anymore
None of these on Xbox ones?
Looking good!
All we need is player ratings
I guess ps4 users have to wing it out  with no new passing mechanics
Not gonna lie. This looks good.
Dislike this video!
all i see is rebranding something you lot took out and now class as new
Hardest job at EA is being the person who has to come up with new names for the same old feature over and over again. True step, real player locomotion, and now 360 cuts.
is it just me or does the in game graphics look horrible? the jerseys make the numbers look so big, bulky & uneven. i hope this isn’t the final look of the graphics.
Running will be meta and broken this madden
Cool, can’t wait
im impresed with the field sense and animation stuff but the graphics and the scoreboard dissapoints me
Not gonna lie it does look like an improvement idk if its gonna be any good but i like what they did
Same like every year
So “field sense” is basically common sense football fundamentals that should have been, and were in the game years ago. Awesome!
This game is just horrible lol
Can I have a code for series x
why Micah bull rush that center?
Fix the players on the line like bosa and other rushers they should be using their moves trying to get the Qb I shouldn’t have to play on AD for him to go sack the Qb be should do it he is a 99 I should feel his presence on the field
Yup games gonna be broken
2:25 BIG DAWG HERNDON
still trash
Wish they would change the in game commentary 😪 its the same for 5 years and use the same words every year
At least we can all say ea is trying for once
1:23 literally the same animation twice 2:34 defense just spun around like "wuh 🥴" 0:23 #80 doesn't know who to block
Need a beta code pls
Well see how repetitive those animations get after a month. I really hope AIs ability to defend its zone or man coverage has been revamped and improved as well. Beyond irritating how one user has to defend left right and center of the field bcuz the AI doesn't move or will blatantly do the wrong play sometimes
Vikings!
3:40 that defender makes absolutely 0 contact with McCaffrey
I’m not completely sold but the cuts look better. I would like to try it. However I don’t know if the changes are enough to compete with the golden era of Madden 2002-2005.
Remember: Dont Preorder! Its EA.
lmao.. some of the stuff they say about madden 22.. is literally NOT what they said in the trailer last year ha. they are low key admitting they were full of it last year..
I don’t lie, 3500 new animations sounds great it really seems like they’re tryna add a skill gap and I love it. On the other hand, if their still isn’t new features of new features added to game modes. Then bleh.
We're is Skate 4 or Need For Speed 2022
Did they just use Josh Allen to demonstrate tackling technique?
Bro the running animations looks terrible
very cool cant waite to play
Physics lmaoo the game is all animation
They showing WR footwork off the line like players jus started doing this in the NFL
Is this the existing engine or a whole new engine because that's why having like because all seemed to be the same. This looks to be different, not visual wise, but gameplay only... I like it, the more  Physx and animations the more I'm interested... when ever play through felt the same I stopped playing...
I swear this was in Madden before lmaooooo .
Why was there 3 josh Allen’s tackling each other
Fieldsense is just Total Control Passing from Madden 18 repackaged. 360 Cuts is just a lighter version of the Highlight Stick from Madden 07 repackaged. These new physics animations and controls seem promising, but they still didn't show an endzone fade or goaline dive situation in the footage. Also, NONE OF THIS WILL MATTER if EA does not give next-gen an ENTIRELY NEW ENGINE for the physics to play out accurately.  And lastly, WE WANT FRANCHISE UPDATED! There better be a REAL updated franchise mode this year, not just cheap talk about an advanced scouting update that never came. I'll believe it when I see it, EA.
i see some little changes about ball carries
This looks awesome! Keep it up EA
None of this matters if franchise is the exact same as the year before
Is there goin to be where we can challenge the play and flags again if not I’m not buying it.
I see one mistake with the game already the 49ers updated their uniforms and they still look the same as last years the uniforms will probably be added later in development but I just wanted to point that out
Dead game.
Yay, new gameplay for the 8th year in a row. It’s not worked he last 8 times but THIS TIME it will work. John Madden made this game by forcing EA to make 11-11 football. Honor his legacy EA, John deserved better. R.I.P to a legend.
Just in the footage you guys showed I see some corners and linebackers still doing things they shouldn't
They still haven’t put tattoos on players after all these dame years like jalen mills been tatted up for 6 years through madden and no tattoos like 2k would have this on lock!
3:10 Look at the safety. That's literally all I needed to see. 😂 rebuild this trash from the ground up and get rid of the frostbite engine or this franchise is doomed to 1 and 2 star reviews forever.
Seems legit but it's ea there gonna screw this up some way or another
The tackling animations are always look so unrealistic in regard of how fast the runner is going because they don’t motion capture in full speed!
I thought we were straying away from animations 🤔
Before yall clammer about how exciting this all sounds, and give the usual "They are heading in the right direction" thing, go back to all the trailers over the last few years. This game will never be what you expect. It is in a forever loop of "Heading in the right direction" While always declining in quality. Which shouldnt even make sense. Aint no way, yall are going to fall for it for the 10th year in a row... lol.
step in the right direction, o line needs love next year tho
this could be the best madden yet
Copy n paste 23
Bum game, with the same animations lmaooo
Bro I been playing the Beta and its def hard to pass on this improved defense and goodluck if you think you can just rely on 1 play TDs
A lot of these features are not new
cuz they look like this is gameplay for 360 and not p5😵‍💫💀
What Bout Franchise mode😢
3:37 that is horrible defence! How do you say you fixed defence when that happens?
is it just me or do the players look weird
Wenn is the full Release of the Game? 360 Cut nice Idea, Looks difficult to defend ;)
I'd look forward to this if PC players weren't arbitrarily left out from the new features.
“Hey you know all those things All Pro Footballl 2k8 did 15 years ago, we finally added physics like 2k. Maybe.”
WOW! MADDEN 16 LOOKS AMAZING!!!!!
I love how you guys don’t even put forth the effort to even make it seem like you changed the dbs cpu. Diggs makes a cut and the chiefs db looks at him, chases the cut for a tenth of a second, and then just stands there and does nothing. Another year of predictable gameplay, how great
🔥🔥🔥
Solid step in the right direction. I will wait and see what's coming to the modes and maybe this will be my first Madden since Madden 11.
Xbox one/ PS4 players watching this: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THERE’S NO FIELDSENSE ON LAST-GEN
I want the Myles Garrett animation where he rips off someone’s helmet and starts swinging on the whole team after a loss.
"You can put the ball exactly where you want"  Haven't they said this same thing for about 10 years now?
This game sucks
Where are the franchise updates this looks cool if you’re on a next gen console and I’m not so I really don’t care
This actually looks promising but I’m expecting to be disappointed regardless
I can almost guarantee you none of this is true
It looks promising potentially, but I don’t think I’m gonna buy it until ppl start giving their genuine reviews on it
Before y’all release the game, add the griddy please.
Game is still going to be trash lol. Look at 2:48 the running back is still getting stuck behind the line and can’t run his route
As someone that only plays as a db I’m very happy
Why not on PC?????
Soooo just QB vision from 06? Gang tackles from 10 and other reused assets ? Y’all hyped for this ? Smh
Great so every quarterback is going to be able to run and throw like on 22 making 100% accurate throw running opposite way...looks the same as it always does I thought madden would've taken a lot more from fifa by now
Also I feel with the in the air tackling will be just as bad. They’ll still hit you in the air and the ball will bounce to a db or safety like 22.
When is madden going to Release most of the players overall
It's almost like they have never watched football
Sound Like Y’all Finally Got This Shid Right🗣 I’m Hyped
Can we get new qb throwing styles and playoff stats pleaseeeee
Still junk until otherwise proven irl. Wait for reviews, don't preorder this stuff.
I will say this. This totally has the right ideas. It’s just how good the execution will be
This is probably gunna be broken asl by the time it gets released And then get a terrible patch with more glitches   EA sports hasn’t convinced me yet
y’all use the most unathletic mfs for the mo cap animation and it’s highly noticeable when my NFL player runs a route like a JV backup
Cant believe im about to say this but this looks like a step in the right direction
Hope they fix the jerseys they look dumb
ps5 code please
Looks like fumbling is going to be overpowered.
To bad it’s only for players that have next generation consoles
The players are from madden mobile…
The beta already haves a nice foundation and I'm looking forward to the full release!
I'm still worried about how unbalanced the run game is gonna be. Either hard cuts are too OP or fumbling will happen too often
Cant wait to play this on PC.... wait a minute
1:31 Bro.... why is pushing a WR supposed to be "good defense"?? Stop making folks believe that's how you play defense. Stuff like that irks me to the core!
I still don't have my madden 23 beta code... @EA SPORTS MADDEN NFL
2:35 watch the corner and 3:35 watch the safety. Same trash different day lmao.
The best part of this video is seeing 2 Josh Allens tackle another Josh Allen
It looks okay, a step forward for sure, but it still looks like it’s lacking compared to madden 07 on the ps2, is there any new modes on this, or is it just new gameplay
Y’all still have the whip in the game 😭
It's probably still gonna be the same on last gen
yall been had this system is past maddens but took it out now yall putting it back in this isn't new lol
Okay but is mut gonna be broken or it takes skill this year
3:43 Get Rid of that Tackle Animation
Ea should bring back where the size and weight of the player dictates if they fall forward or not.
This stuff sound cool, but did i just don't think this stuff will work. The new passing system is cool but did we need it. I would say it more on how the game interacts with animations then the passong itsself. Mid collusions is something that was and should have been in the game , but from what I'm seeing how the way they interact it could be chees.  I glad that ea tiburon is try to clean up the animation work in the game but old maddens even the ps2 ones were  smoother in transitioning from animation to animation. Madden 25 was the best at doing.   360 cuts can add more depth movement and i feel like it will be better, but movment was better . This game is a simcade, even though ea market is a simulation. This game is more arcade. That's not a bad thing but being to much of one for madden is not good.  The next college football game will be based of this game. The gameplay will be better but not by much. Tou will be very disappointed if you played the old NCAA football games. I think there will be a uproar for how bad the games will be. There will be something like get every team in the game but overall it will be bad.
Would have sold us more if you had a 5 second video showing CREATE A TEAM/STADIUM BEING BACK.
Looks like they've made some   significant improvements but I'm still skeptical and definitely won't be buying the game on launch, but I actually might buy this one. I've only bought Madden twice in the last decade
Is this finally a step in the right direction?
Repackaged features with new names
Please ea all I ask is more hit stick animations that’s all I want
Excited for this !
i believe this the year john madden back on the cover plus…2k been hiding a secret football game so yaa
But like where the Griddy at!
Is diving at the pie line more realistic is the griddy in the game ?
Introducing 360 Cut… that was introduced when Gameloft made football games on iOS years ago
It doesnt take a year to make this feature. What else have you done, in particular with franchise mode.
Mid air hit sounds cool, but I hope it’s well balanced.
Yall gettin my money this what i been waitin on  f🏈🏈k the haters…now ncaa football need to be just like it
🗑
Why has 'aggressive' catch now been super nerf'd like for real now no receivers no matter who they are and more importantly no matter what their catch ratings are can't leap in the air to make a reception
FIX MADDEN FRANCHISE
Most of this doesn’t look like new mechanics. For example I remember very well that in Madden 20, the defense could run into a WR and knock out the ball and it happened way too much, to the point of annoyance. Also the gang tackle has been sort of a thing, maybe it’s being improved.
Bruh that’s cool but show franchise
Make sure presentation, immersion and franchise get major love. Still dont see any refs in the game. Your a AAA title and all other AAA sports games have officials in game. Fundamentals EA
I bet the mid air tackles finna be op af and deep passes finna be trash asl. But we'll see
Did y’all fix the mechanical problem when the QB will run and get touch so soft from a DB and it’s automatic fumble? Fix that
I jus want the game to be cross platform
I’m pretty sure football consists of more than 5 positions.
Hear me out, we need new drip in the game, let us have the undershirts, crunched up high socks, baggy long sleeves, and let us see the knees 🙏🏽
It’s 2022 and EA is still bragging about introducing basic football fundamentals into their game lmao.
We just want NCAA 23. Don’t screw it up!!!
And let's take a wild guess franchise will still crash every season of sim, rosters won't work and I can have a reciever 80 percent scouted and not know catching or route running. God I hope its good
Looks actually nice
How much wide receivers can’t mid-air tackle dbacks
Where the refs?
Now we’re talking.
there’s no way they saw 2:35 and said yea this the one 💀
Could you please add these things that Madden NFL should add this year...  • Add Create a Team Mode • Add Create a Stadium Mode  • Add College Teams for Exhibition Mode / maybe XFL / USFL / own teams into Exhibition  • Add Playoff Mode, where gamers can choose their own teams and be for which seed(1 to 7).  • Make Custom Super Bowl Games, where gamers can choose and play at any stadium to host a Super Bowl, in Exhibition Mode.  • Make a Custom League, where gamers can choose under 32 football teams, it can be NFL, College, XFL, or own custom teams.  • Update Primetime games, like if you play a SNF game, the score board in NBC Theme and as seen on TV, same for TNF(Prime Time) & MNF(ESPN/ABC)  • Make our own football schedules for Franchise Mode, gamers can make their own Franchise seasons.  • Add future contact Super Bowl stadiums in Franchise Mode  • Custom Division’s - Explain: Seahawks (NFC West to AFC West) Broncos (AFC West to NFC West).
please release them in the UK spent days trying to get one last year then realised they were US only @/madden23
2:50 Sheesh look at Fournette
So what I’m seeing is only two man gang tackle animations. Not physics based to where every defensive player can get a hit in…great!
I’m glad madden moving in the right direction special on defense, I really love that new tackling system
Please being it to pc! It doesn't make sense that PC is last gen
Very promising. I’m always hesitant when things sound amazing with Madden, as everything has been relatively disappointing for years. But this is the most excited I’ve been.
ZzZ
What about the zones?
Okay so I know this is a cliche in madden reviews, but this actually looks like a step in the right direction. Also it’s a small thing but I’m so glad the shoulder pads aren’t bulky on thinner players anymore
I think Madden went down hill once they added Comp Sim and Arcade mode tbh then added X factors and traits copying 2k takeover system
3:55 Check out #1 on the defense, glad to see slant routes still make your DB's become pylons and get absolutely lost.
and my high end pc cant even get this LOL
Fix the OL man. Same blocks animations, not climbing to the LB on double teams, nor do they even get a block on pull calls. We should also see more pancakes too.
ngl Madden 23 looking like a W rn
Wasn’t precision passing already introduced somewhat in Madden 19?
So no Cross-play?
no shot they left leonard fournette struggling to get out his route because his offensive linemen were blocking him for doing so.   it’s like they didn’t even try to hide that part. they know mfs going to buy the game no matter what, so they’ll show you josh allen tackling a bunch of other josh allen’s. EA funny man.
CAN'T WAIT!!!!
What has been added to franchise? Has blocking been fixed? Are receivers still passive catching instead of attacking the football? Are we still not using modern positional terminology? Are we building on the things added to franchise mode last year? These are the things people want to know
Played the beta and madden is moving in the right direction. If they can polish it, this could be a really good year
The only thing I worry about is the 360 cuts being too overpowered to where we can’t tackle anybody because they keep breaking our ankles
Can’t wait to see absolutely nothing done with franchise again
How does Joe Burrow not have any abilities but Kyler Murry has a X Factor
DB still letting WR run open down field.  Go to the time 3:10 in people will see defenders not covering the WR
Gonna be so many dropped pa$$e$
Trash!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ncaa on ps2 had these features  8😮‍💨😮‍💨
My Xbox won't sign into my Beta, no one knows why this is an issue lol.
“Mid air tackles” been in the game for years
wheel routes are still going to be OP.
What about UFC5 ??????? IM GETTING OLD WAITING FOR IT
hoping this game isn’t terrible for the sake of john madden
The demo in recent years always plays GOOD. Then release day comes, and it’s not the same game. PLEASE EA, don’t mess with this game to much and screw it up on release day to make it unplayable 🙏🙏🙏
Same old game
Where do I put the beta code in at??
I’m excited for the CFB game next year, but this looks better than 22, W progress
It still looks the same
Yessssss DB for Career Mode😁😁😁😁
@ 1:21 what up with Chase’s spat 🙄🫠
So basically no more random animations, everything is user based!!! thank you madden!
I cannot wait for this!
They fixed the animation problem which is good.
Ain't no way they're actually trying to make the game good.  Like literally... there's no way.   I refuse to believe.
Looking good 👍
It all sounds good
So its not coming to nintendo switch? 🤦🏽‍♂️
What abt old gen?
If what you say is true I better not see small running backs get five yards in a cloud of dust after getting tackled at the one
Doesn't EA know that we can actually see the gameplay?
Madden 23
The double tackle and having the ball get punched out im not with! Not even in real life that every RB coughs up that ball on a double tackle so im confused on who wanted to add that feature🤦🏽‍♂️. I only buy madden to play with my team but i see its always sum bs! They yet to set a player movement to that actual player. Instead everyon has to move exactly the same. EA makes no sense
The mid air tackles i feel were already in the game and looks like same tackle animations unless I’m tripping
Sounds like false hope
Watch franchise mode be exactly the same lol
tbh that looks really good
Here comes ryan moody saying this gameplay looks trash witch it does
L GAME IM SO DISAPPOINTED 😭😭😭
EA why haven’t I got the free 99 overall pack yet for preordering madden 23
@ea sports Madden NFL I already preordered 23 all madden edition and signed up for beta but didnt get my code. Let me get an xbox S/X code
Madden 23
Or how about you guys stop making certain features for new gen only. It’s extremely annoying.
RG I see you 👀 madden 23 season
Looking good
Bro how is current gen ?
W
Madden 23
I'm excited for the knew rum cuts
Please send me a code for Xbox series S
When will I get my code?
Looks like we going to get sticky sticky on the run game in 23.
# madden  23
I actually really like the cut idea, but we’re gonna have to see how it plays before we say anything
Madden23!!

The hard cut stuff was in madden 17 just putting it out there
I swear I seen mid air tacking in madden 22
It’s the same game
Can't wait to play. Looks good with a plenty of more player interaction. Would love to try the beta please 🙏
When y’all going speak on career mode
Oj Howard isn’t even on the bucs bro💀
Add more equipment!!
Looks pretty solid!
Very nice mechanic. This will make the game more competitive in H2H or other modes. Thumbs up EA

FieldNONEOFTHISMAKESANYSense
Not bad
Offensive linemen stillll a blaring weakness
Can this game be played PS4?
PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series S 🙏🏿🤞🏿‼️
Is fieldsense only for next gen console or like PS4 and Xbox one as well?
Y’all complain about madden every….😂😂😂😂
Also why is there only two person tackles?
Still no physics. WE DONT WANT MORE ANIMATIONS! We want physic based gameplay. You did this in Madden 25 so there’s no excuse
I hope we get better story lines and be able to play with all positions in the story mode.
PC Please, lets gooo!
Man I so ready for Madden 23 to come out right now. Let's Gooooo
# madden 23 cmon lets go im hyped
Fix defense
Madden 23
PlayStation
Where's my beta code at? I signed up still no code
lemme get a code pleaseeeee xbox series x
Lets goooooooo
I never got my beta code
Gang
WE LOVE YOU RGGGG
Still waiting for my email
It's just gonna be short clips on how the Game is still broken from run,pass and defense 😪
God bless you guys Always keep God first
I just want EA Sports to sell. They'll never do right, they don't even try anymore. Sports gamers have no options. Every sport has one choice to pick
I need a code thanks
So you're saying I have a chance 🤔
For any1 who has the beta, could you tell me if Derek stingley jr and tre’von diggs have their face scan in the game? I’d really appreciate it
Yo who remembers when we were supposed to get create a team/ at least new relocation teams this year? Yeah me too, classic over promise under deliver from ea!
Been playing Madden for a very long time I’d love to get a beta code
Fieldsense better be on PC
Finna show Tom brady with escape artist bruh stop playin bruh😈😈
Man y’all love scamming people y’all show what you want to show then the game is trash that’s why I haven’t purchased madden since 2018 my very last madden
Fix yo game! I was playing and the camera was glitching and shi
Can't wait to check it out 💯🔥🔥🔥
Let’s go for the X
Imagine wanting to play a beta of an awful game 🤣
Make linebackers jump again
Need a code XSX. Help me out!
Fix the defense!!! The defense is the biggest problem in these games year after year. Safeties need to be more aggressive and corners shouldn’t be getting beat by five to ten yards on basic plays
Games gonna be terrible like always, I will go to either Madden 08 or an old 2k football game
please meeee 🎉 always support you ea
Ps5 please I ❤️ EA SPORTS and MADDEN NFL 23 🔵🔴
Can't wait to see the gameplay tomorrow 🥴🥴🥴
I have high hopes
Yolo!
Haven’t bought a madden in years because they’re the same every year
It’s gonna be a disgrace
Madden is a RIPOFF
NEW COMMENTARIES MADDEN 23?? EA WHY YOU GUYS DONT LISTEN TO US SMH IS BEEN 7 YEARS SAME COMMENTARY PLEASEEEE
@EA SPORTS MADDEN NFL I need madden beta code for ps5 plz
@EA SPORTS MADDEN I NEED PS5 BETA CODE
Just remake ncaa 14 it’s better than anything you’re planning to release
I’m going to be very happy for Madden NFL 23 on the Xbox Series X 😀😃🏈
Y’all better fix these animation tackles bc I’m still seeing the same old tackles instead of “physics based” collisions. Please!!
Let’s just say that EA is lucky the dislikes don’t appear
Yeye
Can people ever be happy with a game? Geez
:) yeah
BOOOOOOO! Might as well call this one Madden 18 through 23…we know what to expect EA can’t keep fooling ppl who wake are waking up lol
Yay 43 more hours to go just to see a trailer of a recycled game that won’t even show you all the bad about the game that’s really in it. They wanna show us the sugar then when we buy it it’ll turn into salt..
Where’s our codes
MADDEN NFL 23 IS COMING TO AUGUST 19
I bet they’re gonna show what they want you to see to buy their game, and then have a broken game when it’s out.
Xbox please❤️
xbox codes? 🤔
Xbox please 😩
Xbox series s please
Xbox please
When is the actual madden 23 trailer comeing out
