😍😍😍❤️
I always find myself coming back here. 💞✨️🌿🕊🍃
Simply the best!
Was that her real hair or a wig?  Regardless, thank you Tina Turner for all the wonderful music you gave us and we miss you specially today in which music is not the great thing it used to be.
I think she's the greatest female performer of all time. Her voice was just full of feeling that you just don't get nowadays. Her energy and charisma are unmatched. Amongst all that I think she had such class, such dignity. A real lady.
WHO IS HERE IN 2025?? Tina Turner will ALWAYS be SIMPLY THE BEST.She always had style,charisma and personality.She was a force of nature on stage and there isn’t other women who are walking across narrow platforms to sing to their fans in high heels at age 69. Tina Turner also still holds the Guinness World Record for her Rio show and even as popular as Taylor Swift is she didn’t come close to attracting as large a crowd in one stadium on one night.REST IN PEACE QUEEN TINA TURNER ❤️❤️❤️
God bless you Tina . ..you are singing with the Angels beautiful Lady
Tina is singing for angels now in heavan.   she is divine.    love her soooooooo much
Oldie but goodie
He had without doubt one of the greatest and most respected stars of all time in a rare interview and he had to go back to ikes violence. There's a lot more to her than what she overcame.
So gutted to have not seen Tina live before she passed away what an amazing artist and such an amazing person ❤
She did a book at the beginning of her career where she detailed the abuse with Ike so she could put it out there and move on with her life and not keep talking about it. Unfortunately nobody let her forget it even her last interview before she died they asked her about it. Ike should of been left in the past where he belongs.
8:37 😂
I was lucky enough to see her live twice, 1st time on The Golden Eye tour in 97, the last concert ever to be played at the old Wembley stadium and again in Sheffield on the 24/7 tour, no one will ever come close to being able to power up a crowd the way Tina Could, truly the Queen of Rock, missed greatly but what a legacy she leaves behind xxxxx
Hermosa! La adoro, siempre viva!
They've been asking about Ike for 20+ years and she's always graceful and honest.
She was the GOAT
I was lucky enough to see her in concert three times! What an extraordinary talent! Miss her!
how many times do thay have to ask about ike she has repeated herself about the situation a billion times holy shit....
Miss her soo much. Absolute ICON ❤
We went to see TINA at The Aldwych Theatre last week.  Fabulous evening out.  What a lady.  We salute you, Tina!  Rest (and rock) in peace.
She had cancer too?. Dear me.❤
If I didn't see this,I just don't know how She is real!❤
A huge live wire and so entertaining and energetic
She’s absolutely beautiful and a huge loss to the world
Isn't it Wild that Tina still holds the record for largest paying crowd..182,000 screaming fans in Rio not even Madonna or Beyonce or Taylor can come close
YOU CAN TELL SHE HAD HAD A STROKE (LOOK AT THE RIGHT SIDE OF HER MOUTH).
I am 30 and she is an icon of my time and generation.  Translation - she's TIMELESS!
She was simply the best one extraordinary women!
How did The camera show The audience
I couldn't stand when they asked her about Ike over and over again. It was half a century ago and it brought back so many horrible memories for her when her life was better at last
🎼 I can get emotional watching full interviews with *TINA TURNER* like this one -  for after being a fan since LET'S STAY TOGETHER as a teenager and following her music career and having seen her live in different tours over the decades made it very special that I have been enjoying her expansive body of work that is part of my own life.  I still do not think about her passing, but perhaps that she has now officially retired and rest (in peace and power) for good.  She is truly irreplaceable, incomparable, and inspirational - the indispuable Queen of Rock N Roll, from here to eternity.  We love you ...  🎵🎶
One of the very top best , just like Michael Jackson and both have their own uniqueness.  I listen to her in my car when I'm working , the best feeling .
I ran into Tina in a hotel lobby in Montreal in the 80's. I was a student at McGill University across from the hotel  and she was in the lobby waiting for a ride I guess. OMG! This woman was pure class. Not an ounce of arrogance in her body. Spoke to me like I was the most important person in the world at that moment. There was another time behind hotel where she was entering through a private door. I asked for her autograph and she quickly turned around and reached for my pen and pad but her guard pushed her hand away from me and   put a stop to that. The fact that she actually turned and reached for my pen meant a lot to me. The kindness in her heart was very clear to me at that moment despite the nasty bodyguard.  Bye the way, I saw the Queen Mother in the same lobby that same year. The Four Seasons Hotel  at the time on Sherbrooke Street! Great place to meet celebrities prior to and post concert appearances.
what a force of nature!! a natural woman,,much missed,,RIP
Mooie sterke dame. Zowel de ziel als het lichaam.
Tina my STAR forever! She will never die, her songs, her heart and soul. I ❤ TINA
It upsets me that after all those years they bring up Ike. It's incredibly insensitive to ask survivors of domestic violence about a traumatic event in their life. When they recall the event they are often reliving it in their mind and the event becomes real all over again. This can happen even with years of healing. Before asking a victim you should preface it with are you ok with talking about what happened and if they aren't move on
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Tina blew me away as always.❗️ I miss you so much beautiful lady. R.I.P 🙏🏼😢
2:03 Nutbush city limits 🎵🎶
I grew up with Tina tuner, and she was there all my life, so heartbroken that she left us and she left us so quietly
HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY GODMOTHER THANKYOU  FOR SAVEING ME THAT EVEING AT THE HOWARD  THEATRE AT THE AGE OF 5/6  620 T ST NW WASHINGTON DC 20001❤ I WAS SO HUNGRY AND I HAD TO GO TO THE RESTROOM SHE WALK PASSED ME AND LOOK AT MY FACE AND ASk what is the matter I was so afraid to tell her because Dad would have beaten light out of me,she then said I will never tell Imm you Godmother this will be our secret, so I told her everything about the beaten she then told me to go to the rest room and to hurry,then she went and got snacks  she then said hurry eat before  your Dad come,man did she save my life and I never told our secret, but I did say one day I will be just like her and that is my mother,she is the sweetiest lady sver,she is not dead but a sleep in Jesus and we shall meet again,I learn so much from her won many contests, now I want to show the world  what I learn from the Queen of Rock an Roll by watching her at the age of 5 Love Lanita in DC😢😢😢❤
QUEEN ❤
Icon. Legendary. A beautiful person, inside and out. We will miss you Tina, but you will never be forgotten.
I tear up, watching this.. thank you for sharing this. 🫂❤️🫶🏼.  May our heroes rip. 🙏🏼💕
💛💚
You know… I hate that they kept asking her the same question about being abused by Ike. Like I wish they would’ve let that part of her life go.. she soared on her own, but the abuse with Ike is what they always brought up.
😊
So blessed to have seen the GREAT and LEGENDARY Tina on stage! Have been a fan since I was a kid and all I can say is that NO ONE could rock a kitten-heel like MIss Tina! ;)
I have watched this interview many times and tonight, I find it diffciult to accept that we will not have the privilege to see her again perform on a stage around the world, a TV show, an award ceremony . Sad ...very sad .. but that's life.
She was fantastic wasn’t she ❤️
What an absolutely fabulous lady, courageous & brave.  A great entertainer & classy woman.  RIP Tina Turner
it’s been over a year since you’ve been gone and i’m up late watching videos of you. just like Jonathan said, if anyone deserves to rest, it’s you. Anna Mae may be gone, but Tina Turner will live forever. long live the queen. 💕
The Queen!  The Legend.  The world will never be the same with her not in it.
May you never fade from my broken 💔……rest in peace…….queen.
😊😊
I love her so much she was more than just a music icon to me what an inspiration ❤️🙏
I'm still a "daily" fan. After 40 years now, Tina is still and will always be part of my existence. She guided me by positive example in so many ways. Precious beyond all measure. Best that ever was or will ever be.✌️🐲🕊🌿✨️🔱☄️🌄
If you want to know what Tina was about watch her Wembley Stadium show from 2000. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b4jc9beA0c She was 60 years old at the time and it's an astonishing performance.
I am ann big fun  off Tina!!❤❤❤❤
She looks so beatific and beautiful.
Tina was a real, beautiful, nice soul, her eyes are so clear, God was in her heart. We will never forget this angel, she will never die. WE ALL LOVE YOU TINA, FOREVER AND EVER <3 . The 24 of May 2023, I was outside of your door in Kusnacht (Zurich), crying for you <3. Andrea ... from Italy <3
Watching her gives me goosebumps. What a star
Man when she was young she was beautiful.
It's crazy to miss someone you've never met❤
I will miss her so much rest in peace darling we love you, and she will never be forgotten can't believe even she died, but that's life we all gone die one day but the most important is what our impact is for other people is when we die.
RIP Tina
I love this womam
Can confirm the musical is INCREDIBLE
I bet David said: "how about we make out"
Such a beautiful queen Tina Turner is always will be. Such a professional. RIP Queen Tina.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏿🙏🏿
She had her golden days in the sun for the last 30+ years of her life with the man who truly showed herLove and care and comfort and being able to bask in the fruits of her hard labor of a long career ❤ Always a gentle humble position lady. RiP Tina you were a world class Lady who deserves all the good she ever had 🙏🏾

WHAT A  WOMAN, MORE THAN WOMAN.
Tina Turner's death made me so sad this year. As long as her music lives on, my spirit will live on beside hers. But I'm not deceased I'm still thinking about all icons.
I miss you 🥺🥺🥺
the clinking sound her bracets make is kinda distracting😅
When Tina’s doing proud Mary and she’s asks you know why you scream why you don’t laugh YOU SCREAM WHY
The Way Tina moves etc. There is 20 !!!
Legends never die ❤
6:59  David Bowie and Tina Turner "I  will see you in the sky...."  brings a tear 😢😢❤ They're dancing forever in our memory
she is the best ax
Never to be equalled.  What a woman!
Lovely woman
Ela é a força de uma mulher, que enfrentou batalhas na vida e se transformou nesta mulher incrível e talentosa cantora. A mulher guerreira e de lindas pernas e voz. Será sempre " Diva do Rock rol !
My Queen Tina Turner l Love you so much Tina miss you rest in peace ❤️🙏🌹🥰😢
A true star!
The Iconic and legendary Tina Turner. She was and will always be simply the best. Thank you for all the beautiful memories, RIP Madam Tina . 🙏🏼✝️🕊

This was six years before her passing in 2023
Tina Still Dancing Shimming In Heaven Making Everyone Else Wanna Do It Right Along With Her ❤️‍🔥🥰 12:02
U Definitely Can Tell The Stroke Affected Tina’s Facial Muscles & Speech After Tina Had In 2013 2:16
She is a beautiful woman and she has so much talent it’s amazing how she performed in her late 60s RIP Tina Turner you will be missed but your music lives on forever
Class act
Such a lovely personality ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
That is not Tina turnip
Endings are always sad….this was Tina’s end….not her demise. I just hope he remaining years were wonderful and happy,as she deserved it !
God Bless her…she was a remarkable woman.  One of my first albums when I was a kid. God bless the 80’s !! 💚
Jonathan is an excellent interviewer. How do you interview a legend like Tina?! He did a great job. Tina lives on 🤍💝
I know the feeling; all my icons dying. It's very lonely and I am beginning to feel like a stranger here on earth. We will always have Tina's music so I can comfort myself with that.
What a tremendous loss to the world. You will be missed Queen Tina Turner, may you Rest in Power~
Good to see that she got such a wonderful goodbye, or farewell, on British TV.
RIP Tina!!
Miss Tina you are wonderful
At that age they still bambase her about ike realy ugly😮
My beautiful baby 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Wow, I miss her so much! Just watched two of her concerts last week. Such an incredible performer and singer
My beloved QUEEEN, thanks for your talent and carisma. ❤
Tina Turner is just so positive, vibrant and down to earth. Love her truly.  ♥
I feel these tears in my eyes.
I cannot imagine how sad her husband  Erwin Bach must be and feel. The emptiness in the house without her laughter without her voice and without her live and happiness she felt and gave. It must feel like a deep deep endless fall into the Abyss. We are sorry for his loss as we mourn with him in silence.
She is/was such a lovable person/woman very authentic, talented and beautiful and humble. 💖forever
Her dance moves likely inspired Beyoncé in “All the Single Ladies”! Those incredibly  strong and beautiful thighs, her amazing legs! It was sad to lose her, she was an Icon.  She did earn a happy retirement!
A Music Legend & Icon. *The "Queen of Rock 'n' Roll" Tina Turner.* This was 4yrs after she recovered from her _Stroke, Kidney Transplant, and Stomach Cancer operation._ She may not have been Touring anymore but she came out of Retirement for Tina Turner Musical shows, the Story of her life. She went to see them and would go up on Stage and engage with the Audience & Performers. A few years later she did the 2021 Documentary 'Tina' and did an Interview about the Documentary. Then she was Inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame and gave a beautiful Thank You speech while holding her Award. She was Active in her later years up til' her Death.
I was lucky enough to have sung with Tina. Probably the most incredible memory of my life. She was the warmest kindest woman you could ever meet. She wasn't at all stary. I will cherish the memories I have of Tina and I send my love to her family. She was an icon but more than that she was a woman of incredible strength, and heaven will be rocking now.
Not a great voice, Too raspy
So sweet!  Oh she was a queen and a legend rip sweet mama 😢
Now here was a Goddess, if ever I was to name one. What a beautiful soul. Always remembered and always loved. ❤
Before a Beyonce who's a great stage performer, there was a Tina Turner! Woah her body of work is amazing!
Je découvre sa personnalité.  Humilité, class et force. Rip
i can see her ta-ta's
Why cut out the lip reading segment? that was the best part of the interview.
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
💎💎💎💎💎
💜💜💜💜💜
A wonderful interview by Jonathan. If that was the last one she did in the UK, she went out in style.
I’m sorry, I don’t like the way he asked her about Ike. She has said multiple times that she didn’t like that. I hate peoples disrespecting Black women’s boundaries. RIP legendary Queen Anna Mae Tina Turner. 💙
band missed an opportunity when she stood up to show the PM dance
She looks unrecognizable 😮
Jonathan Ross is the WORST interviewer ever.
What a lady ❤ wow so honest and real. We dont have celebrities like her anymore
Love Tina 🤙🏻💃🏾🙏🏾🙏🏻😊 I wish he focused more on her solo career… I thought it was a bit odd how he focused mainly on the controlled time…
What was the song she said that she sings to herself?
At 77 she simply beautiful ❤inside and out
Jonathan did a great job with this interview. She seemed like an awesome person.
Just 👏 😢🎉
I googled "Most Opposite People in the Universe" and this video appeared.
So sweet ❤❤❤
The perfect image of a Diva! The epítome of resilience and freedom! A truly powerful Woman! A perfect voice, a magic presence, now singing to The stars, I bet!❤️❤️❤️
God bless her soul 🙏
She had it all, great entertainer, beautiful Lady, infectious smile, amazing voice!!! RIP Tina, we'll love you forever!!!❤❤❤❤
Freshness Tina.❤🗝🌍🎶🎵
How classy of J not to ask any details about the abuse, like all the others always did
I'm Iranian. Listened to her songs since I was 10 I guess. Incredibly high positive energy. Rest in peace dear Tina
We've lost a treasure...
What a lovely woman she was ❤️
What an iconic singer ! RIP sweet Tina !

Tina is one of my heroes. May she rest in power. 🙏🏻💙
Such a beautiful soul!
She's so Precious. So Much a Lady. God, we'll miss Y❤U Darling One ❤⚘❤🕊❤🌹❤
What a lovely woman!!! ❤
just watch early performances before the breasts were added....not born female whatsoever.    1978 performance on youtube looked like a drag show.
I get very very upset to think about Ike doing those horrible things to such a kind person as Tina.
She is a beautiful soul, you can see the light in her, it shines so much. Thank you for sharing that light with us
My ex narc said the same thing....'you came with nothing, you leave with nothing'..... after he sat on his arse for 18 years and i worked non stop.
The fact that she's 77 in this interview just blows my mind... Also she has the best hair of any human I've ever seen
Amazing individual a true inspiration.
So Jono Woss will be another man who will turn grey within a couple of weeks once he hits 75, won't he? hahaha, Nice interview!
🙏🌹
She got so wonderfully cutesy in her old age!
A proper superstar ❤
Great show very memorable.
Светлая. Память. Тине. Тенер
ЗВЕЗДА
Покойся. С. Миром !!!! 30. И 05. И 2023 год. Хмао
It’s so sad, you can still see the trauma from her facial expression when they mention Ike. 😢
Must get myself some of those bracelets. R.I.P. Tina - a true great
A kind man and a woman who kept the inner child.
❤❤
😇😇😇😇😇😇🥲😪To U Miss Tina Turner
A great singer and person
Tell me, what does it look like in heaven? Is it peaceful? Is it free like they say? Does the sun shine bright forever? Have your fears and your pain gone away? 'Cause here on Earth it feels like everything Good is missing since you left And here on Earth, everything's different There's an emptiness Oh-oh, I I hope you're dancing in the sky And I hope you're singing in the angel's choir And I hope the angels know what they have I'll bet it's so nice up in Heaven since you arrived So tell me, what do you do up in Heaven? Are your days filled with love and light? Is there music? Is there art and adventure? Tell me are you happy? Are you more alive? 'Cause here on Earth it feels like everything Good is missing since you left And here on Earth everything's different There's an emptiness Oh-oh, I I hope you're dancing in the sky And I hope you're singing in the angel's choir And I hope the angels know what they have I'll bet it's so nice up in Heaven since you arrived Since you arrived Oh, oh (What does it look like in heaven?) Yeah, yeah Oh, oh, oh-oh Oh-oh, oh Oh, oh, I I hope you're dancing in the sky And I hope you're singing in the angel's choir And I hope the angels know what they have I'll bet it's so nice up in Heaven since you arrived Since you arrived.
Pure class, pure talent, pure humility and I've no doubt you saved many women with your story. God bless you Tina, you're one of a kind and we will forever miss you.
Such a incredible lady ❤❤
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
The greatest female voice ever I think. ❤❤❤ love u Tina.
I wish I had met TT earlier, I would loved dancing from her
Tina was dazzling all through. Her huge energy and agility wowed me most.  I so much love this late. She was awesome even in old age.
She was overcoming a recent battle of cancer, a stroke and total kidney failure which resulted in a transplant. What a still powerful woman
"When you leave...you leave like you came". That statement is as narcissistic as it gets. She had her own traumas in her life before meeting Ike...but she never chose to become him. God bless her beautiful soul 🙏💚💌
She was amazing and even at the age she  is here still beautiful and very much sexy. You done it all Tina.  Rest easy hun. X
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
why he start playing IKEs voice 🙄
She has gone . gone to entertain in heaven. Hope we all meet in heaven Bless you lady. RIP We will always sway to your music and lessons you taught us
Such a lovable and charismatic person Tina was. Such a loss to the world. ❤
❤
In 1973 I heard and bought the Nutbush city limits album I was 22 years old and followed her music throughout my life which helped me in good and bad times. In the interview here we never heard her utter a bad word about Ike, she was a lady of humility and compassion and a model for humanity. She will be sadly missed but NEVER forgotten. We love you Tina.
I huess on this interview she is already sick on her kidneys dhe gas moon face maybe related to steroids. She is resting now in heaven.
She was so kind and loving, loved and admired by all - such a massive loss to the world
11:22 Beyonce is heavily indebted to Tina. The movements are uncanny.
Rest in peace beautiful Queen, take your rest now 😢❤
What a woman! RIP
R.I.P Queen💯💖🙏🏾
Rip. Simply the best
Tina found love and peace of life in Switzerland more than in the USA. America might have been a great place to start and expand a career in rock and pop music, but there's something about quality of life across the Atlantic that Tina really loved and appreciated for quite some time before she made her decision to relocate and settle down in Switzerland for good, and she never looked back.   Thank you for your memorable songs, Tina. We'll miss you a lot. ❤
I like the bling's sound
i wanna age like this. but with God's mercies so no diseases like this poor lady battled so bravely. Period
She is and always will be the Queen Of Rock n Roll. A true icon and now sadly a legend. May she rest in eternal peace. Thank you for the music Tina
This was lovely ❤️class act
what a lady!!
Its very hard to imagine a life as TT says on buses planes trains cars etc no time at home....money in the bank sure but i cant imagine how nice it must have been for her to retire and enjoy down time at home.....
I love you Tina. You got a HEART OF GOLD. I truly respect ❤😊 thank you
She's legendary in life and singing.
The world will never be the same!! Give David a huge hug for all of us!!
Roger Davies had a lot to do with her comeback.
Such a beautiful interview. She is so dear. She suffers no more. Amazing Tina, what a legacy.
❤ her
Jonathan Ross always is so respectful of his guests. Wonderful interview. RIP Tina Turner ❤
She was a  beautiful Soul 🌻 She also had great legs, which no one ever seems to mention.
Awww. I love you Tina❤Rip
Tina was such a good sport. RIP Queen.
Even in death she will outlive most of us! Her music & videos of her performances,  legacy will never die ❤
why can't i stop crying😢 rip Miss Turner .

She is awesome.  What an angel ❤🙏Queen of Rock n roll🤘🌎 RIP. TINA TURNER❤ I made a cover of Proud Mary today. 🎸( John Fogerty' s 78 th birthday) you really rocked his song and made it a big hit. 🤘🤘🤘👍

This woman was THE queen.
God bless her ❤❤

Tina Turner ❤️💐👸🏾
Darling, Tina Turner, I love you, the same CUTE AND BEAUTIFUL SMILE, you got there 💞💞💞💞💖💖💖💖🌈🌈🌈🌈🌁🌁🌁🌁⏺️⏺️⏺️
Greatest Show Woman ever!
What a lady listen to her all night , phenomenal & beautiful ❤️
Ich bin traurig 😥
A beautiful lady, great character, immense singer, so sad to know she has gone to the place above.
I'll be always missing you one and only Queen of rock n' roll😢. Thank you for all you gave to us. Rest in peace❤
Simply the best and better than all the rest in peace my dear.
She had such Grace and a quiet dignity, yet at the same time she was this powerhouse. I don’t think we will ever see the likes of Tina again. I’m beyond upset that she has passed away
Ross is a very respectful interviewer I'm glad he got to interview this beautiful sensitive artist.
I think she’s the only celebrity who has died where I have felt a profound loss. I saw her in concert 24 years ago and she blew me away. What a singer, what a performer and what an incredible human being she was after everything she endured. The world is a poorer place without Tina in it.  She was classy right until the end. ❤
Wen was this interview?????
I love Tina Turner ❤
She was diagnosed with Intestinal Cancer a year prior. That year she had kidney transplant from her husband. She's a fighter
❤
“The way out… is through the door”
Unprecedented, unique, unequaled. RIP TT. U deserve to.
David Bowe whispered in Tina's ear to say. "My 🍆 is harder than a pipe right now"...RIP Tina. You're Simply The Best. Thanks for all the great music you made the entire world very,very proud!
Incomparable 🩷
RIP Tina 😔
I wonder what Bowie said to her.
She was incredibly beautiful ❤️
God rest her soul…she deserves it…❤️❤️❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
We will love and miss her forever 😢😢😢 The pioneering rock'n'roll star, the woman who showed that all women have strong power and energy to be herself and create her life and her dream life. ❤  Tina was extremely generous with her fan and people, her energy on stage, her unique voice, her musics, we will miss Tina forever, R.I.P Tina. 😢😢😢
Love, love, love Tina forever!!!!
Madame Tina Turner was one of the most positive people in human history.
So, she was 78 years young here
😓💕😓💕
Rest In Peace David Bowie.
“I will love you till I die, I will see you in the sky…” that’s the soundtrack angels must be chanting tonight and forever!
A highly intelligent, fascinating and brilliant performer. I've watched her interviewed several times, she was a remarkable woman and talented in so many ways, not just as a singer, but as a brilliant speaker as well. Her fight through adversity and how she came through Ike's abuse of her is  legendary. RIP Tina, millions around the world will miss you, your music and what you stood for.
rip tina simpley the best xx   now watching  whats love got to do with it  again   love you miss you xx rip
A month off 78 years old and not a wrinkle in sight....good genes or what.
Quelle tristesse d'apprendre sa disparition...Immense artiste, charismatique et talentueuse, une voix monstrueuse... RIP Tina Turner, les légendes ne meurent jamais 😥
I was also lucky enough to see Tina in concert seated right in front of the stage, she was amazing, she danced & sang around the stage all night...Such a beautiful woman inside & out. RIP Tina Turner 💜💜
She was always smiling just stay herself all the way ❤what a wonderful person
Best woman on earth! Thank you Tina!
I like Jonathan Ross. He was respectful to our gorgeous Marti.
Loved her such an inspiration to many.
She will b truly missed. RIP sweet angel ❤❤
Such graciousness and humility. It moved me. She worked so hard.
Anyone ever earned it you ceratainly earned it
Bowie wasn't sad
OMG. Dancing 🥰
2 people, on a different conscious level, having a conversation
sh*t...now i´m all in the feels...this one hurts :( :( :(
you're going to put good things inside, but that's just information...
I cant stand the rain
Such an inspirational woman . And a legendary talent .there will never be any one quite like her .r.i.p
The best....the best❤👍
You're in my prayers Tina, Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.
We have lost alot famous people in the last 2 years may they all rest in peace now with the lord now we will miss you Tina Turner.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

A legend, and a great lady!  There will never be anyone else like her! Tina, beautiful lady may you rest in peace!  You will be loved always!  Thank you Jonathan for this video! A heart for you Jonathan and a heart for Tina♥♥
This was a great interview. When I saw her dancing with Bowie, I started to cry.
I find her with a lot of energy as old as she is. And she does not even look old. She really took care of herself.
she’s the best
I love you, Tina...always &.forever. ❤❤❤
Wow he put her gifted over the table not even a thank you so sad
She ranked a Ten-nessee
❤️❤️Love ❤️❤️Love ❤️❤️
That brought a tear to my eyes what a legend.
Turner= Class Act. Ross= GROSS Your interview clearly taking advantage of a well know story... Seriously? This is what you had to talk about? So many missed opportunities to interview such a legend but there you are, asking cheap questions about a WELL known and documented time in Turner's life. How sad...
Thank you ❤
Such a remarkable woman she really was so much talent. A shining light has left the stage. You were definitely the best Tina. Thank you for your music and voice and your moves. 🇬🇧
Tina Turner has earned her rest and her wings.  I've loved her all of my life.  What a blessing we have lived in the time of Tina Turner - blessed to have witnessed her musical gifts and loving spirit.
Thank you for sharing this, in her own words but later after retiring. Such an inspirational story!
There will be no one like her ever again. You will be missed Queen.
❤
I felt sad when I read the fabulous Tina Turner died as she has been my favourite female artist through the years. My friend said, she was 83 and she had good innings, but I said, yeah but it's Tina Turner. Apparently, when Tina and David were dancing up close and personal he whispered in her ear " My cock is still sore"
she seems like a very warm caring person and funny too
We are in crazy changing times -  so many icons leaving us we grew up with- wishing everyone the best - simply TT was the best. RIP 🙏
What a great woman
Love her so much.
I'm glad she lives in my head singing.
She's very energetic, electrifying and powerful! RIP Queen of Rock n' Roll, Her Majesty of Rock, Ms. Tina Turner👑👑👑 You are Simply The Best!! You will be forever Missed, Untouchable, Queen, Diva and Queen in World's Music. You're Legacy will Forever live on. Thank You Tina👑👑 Love From The Philippines
She should have taken every penny from him .. which belonged to her ..
Sad shes gone shes funny great voice and she loves her people she sings from the heart.. She 'll be forever missed  RIP Tins 🙏🧚‍♀️🧚‍♂️🥰❤❤⭐⭐
the og beyonce
GB her soul, she is so Beautiful so natural in her own way. She's a fighter and a mighty strong lady she's being Blessed.  Love her attitude and her smile.
The woman was 78 at this interview. She looked very good for her age.
7:35 If you wanna know what David said it’s something like, my knob is really sore after last night 😂
I noticed that this video was uploaded only 1 day ago.   Why wasn't it already on the channel ?? One would think that you'd have all your previous interviews uploaded.
'Wow! How this wonderful person picked herself up is amazing after her abusive relationship with Ike.  Queen of Rock is a title well deserved.  RIP Tina you are sadly missed.
Aloha...RIP Ms.Tina Turner🤍🕯🕊🙏 #legend #respect #life #rip #thankyou #mahalo
Thank you so much for the upload. Beautiful woman. Saw her a few times in concert (Toronto 2x, London). Legend. Off the charts talent. Extraordinary. Unbelievable woman. Wow.   RIP Tina.  You changed the world!
Very Clinking bracelets
This was such a fun and respectful interview with the Queen Miss Tina Turner herself. ❤️
Love forever to sweet Tina, a true LEGEND and Queen.
Such a Beautiful Smile❤️
I love her and all, but why did she leave her children to live with a man in Switzerland where the conditions are better for her fortune?
Such a brilliant talent and what a women. God bless her xxxxx
❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
And them Thighs 😋😋😋😋😋😋😋 What a Woman .......................................
I’m young but I loved this lady so much it makes me so mad when I hear about Ike hurting her she was so beautiful I just don’t see how so one could hurt such a angel
Another irreplaceable icon gone but never forgotten. RIP Tina xx
Her energy will remain... I never met her in person.... I saw her perform live twice.... but her energy came first.... I sensed her, and I still sense her.... Thank you, Anna Mae....
One of the great.
She was a very gracious lady with tons of energy. RIP Tina.
Rest in peace Tina 😢❤🙏
RIP Queen Tina...I still remember when I watched her biography with Angela Bassett for the first time. I mean I always love Tina but after seeing her story I was so encouraged to love me how and who I am. And still when I feel down I am listing to...."you know, every now and then...proud Mary", and it lifts me up! Thanks for the strength and courage you gave me to be myself. Love you, Joachim!!
A true legend. My first real idol when I was a child.
She was simply The Best!
We will miss you Tina, will love you always ❤
Such a lovely powerful talented gracious classy legendary icon!!
Watch Nicholas VeniaminNino Rodriguez funky Prepper
Awwww those lyrics, 'I will see you in the sky.' I can imagine them dancing together and laughing right now. RIP Tina.
We won't forget, dear rock queen! God be with you! 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Rest easy Tina !  …. You set an amazing example of strength and success against all odds for many a generation to come !  #SimplyTheBest !
She is and will always be around💗
How ironic that song she did with David Bowie❤❤ So sad, but she had sheer strength
Rest in Peace Tina ❤️🇺🇸
RIP! Was this her last interview?

I really hope they do a concert in her honour. A queen.
She was a special human being, incredible human being.
God protected this beautiful and talented lady.
Such a beautiful lady and gracious human being.   Just lovely ❤
What a woman. Simply the best ❤take your rest Queen 🕊️
Tina had such a big presence onstage that I never realized what a tiny person she was.  We've truly lost a treasure.
Her kindness ,uniqueness,that smile  📜
REST IN PARADISE...THE ONE AND ONLY...ICONIC & LEGENDARY MS. TINA TURNER...YOU'LL FOREVER BE IN OUR HEARTS...YOU'RE SIMPLY THE BEST...BETTER THAN ALL THE REST!!!❤❤❤...ANGELA BASSETT NEEDS TO GET AN HONORARY OSCAR FOR HER ROLE SHE PORTRAYED OF MS. TINA TURNER IN WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT!!!❤❤❤
❤❤❤😊
The world has now started to be less interesting! 😢
Damn 😢 this one stings. I don't mind admitting.
she's a true queen of rock n roll, a real legend and oozes class. compared to say... M..., Tina ages so gracefully, even beautifully
just crying my eyes out, sitting here and watching her being soooo humble
🌹🌹🌹🌹❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😢
Incredible she was well loved by all.
Beautiful person !
I was ALREADY having a 💩 day yesterday, and then I found out Tina had died. I left work, went home and cried. I can't believe she's gone. 😭
I wish people didn't keep going on about ike. She HATED it.
My mum went to london to see the musical. she doesnt like musicals. She said it was brilliant
Looked like he said ‘Oh my god, you’re so warm’ to me.
This is beautiful to watch and I loved the compliments Jonathan gave her, so beautifully worded and so true. Bittersweet to watch at the same time. So sad she’s no longer with us. RIP Tina. ❤
R.i.p beautiful  lady you were simply  the best! Now you meet up with Bowie, singing away in heaven, God bless you❤❤
That’s the spirit right there ❤️
Tina REMAINED A PURE SOUL, A PURE GEM. So BEAUTIFUL through it all.❣❣❣❣. I don't cry, Tina. You live on........
With all due respect. Ike although a freak of nature. He gave her that name. A black man growing up in the racist South truly did some damage mentally. It doesn't make it right what happened. But his genius was overridden with his short comings in the demanding music business.Tina may her soul rest in peace benefited from meeting Ike.
We love Tina, i never contacted the dead but Tina would be one lady i would love to speak to. God bless
#GOAT 🧡 Rip, dear Tina.🌷
RIP Anna Mae xx
I would not have recognized her like that....but this wasn't a sudden change...this was already 6 years ago....
Tina and David dancing in the stars tonight  ✨️ R.I.P tina ❤
You’ll be with us FORVER Tina ‼️🥲😇❤️😘🙏
What a legend... there won't be another
The world will never be the same without you Tina. 😢
RIP Tina. Thank you!❤
What a great,energetic friendly lady. Rest in piece Mrs Turner ❤
" You will leave the same way as you came"  And boy she changed that around. Tina and some of the brave women where Feminism was not a thing. But became that definition of Power House.
Thank you for this clip….. she was such lovely Lady, a queen❤❤
What an enormous talent. Such respect for the lady! RIP.
Rest in peace Tina, enjoy the serenity. We will miss your energy & your sparkle. Your music & performances will live on forever. 💛🌈🦋
It is a pity America didn’t love her as much as the world did.
RIP MY BEAUTIFUL TINA❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love you Tina❤
Still haven't got over losing David, this hits hard.
What a legend. I feel sad. She was so vibrant and alive on stage. So glad I got to see her concert in 90’s.
Jonathan Ross was quite cringe-worthy in this interview. It's like he did no research and had no awareness of her solo career at all. Everything was about the days with Ike, which isn't a happy memory for her. Then he plays Ike singing Proud Mary and tries to get her to sing along with it. THEN he goes on to play a clip from the days she'd dance with Ike on stage. No mention of her much more successful and amazing solo career. Mr. Ross should have done much better if he was going to invite her on.  RIP Tina! We miss you so very much already, you gave so much to this world! ♥
.I will miss her  very much. RIP Miss Turner
My very first concert memory is of seeing Ike and Tina Turner with my parents. I was two years old. My mother died in 2020 and my father died this year. I feel like a bereft child: all the grown ups are leaving...
Tina Turner was always smiling. Regardless of the topic, good or bad, she always smiled. She appreciated all of the adulation she received and never let it get to her head. She is one of a kind. Distinctive in voice, looks, performance, everything. She is the best.
What a sweet lady. :)
She is a force of nature
A great rock legend and a great human being. Stunningly beautiful and always a lady. May Tina forever Rest In Peace. Many blessings. We love you. 🧡🧡🙏🙏
❤
What a lovey woman.
wow their two voices together was a perfect match!
Nobody earned more than her. What challenging life. She’s the winner who took it all. God bless and keep you in light, Tina. Om ah hum wrahjra guru padme Sid hum/Nam Myoho Rengue Kio 🙏🏻❤️🍀
What a beautiful interview. An amazing lady, Till I get to meet you soon sleep well. John 5:28,29
Danke für deine tolle Musik, atemberaubende Shows 👑👑👑dein Talent kann niemand übertreffen von heute, 100% Power 🌶️das war immer ein schöner Anblick sie zu sehen, Ruhe in Frieden mein Engel 🌟
she must have had recovered from a stroke in this, her right side
Legendary interview. RIP Tina Turner!
rest in peace sweetie
😢 Ms. Tina 💔
Her smile was so beautiful.......she had a pleasing personaility I am so glad she found someone who she could love and have that love recipricated back to her.  If she is anything in heaven as she was here on earth I believe we all have something to look forward to.
I know it was a movie but I'm glad she eventually hit back and got some good shots in that limo. Great video, such a cool lady. RIP
Best top 10 singer of all time. Genre, sex, race or religion...it doesn't matter. We are all human and ultimately want the same thing
Oh miss Ana-Mae❤ you will forever be cherished and loved.
TINA TURNER  R.I.P. QUEEN🙏❤
I expect that the biggest reason she quit performing is that usually by mid to late 60s it becomes pretty hard to sing with the power and range that she sang with in her youth. If you’re singing like Leonard Cohen or something fine, but if you’re trying to sing like her or Robert Plant in his Zeppelin days it would eventually be impossible. Like asking a figure skater to do a quad when their 60s. I prefer to remember her the way she was.
This was a beautiful interview.
Bless her, lovely lady. 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
RIP Tina. I what to thank you for so much good music and entertainment. Also, thank you, Jonathan Ross, for a very classy interview and making her feel at home. She's simply "The Best" and she deserved excellent TV.
So much power and Positive vibes, Talented! Pure energy, gifted from God!  #RipTinaTurner, 🎤👏❤️🙏
That was great 😀
BELOVED! PLEASE DON'T DIE WITHOUT JESUS IN YOUR HEART!  St John 3:16! ❤️  SOULS LIVE FOREVER...WITH OR WITHOUT JESUS!   WITHOUT JESUS, IT CERTAINLY IS SAD. ETERNITY IS LONG AND PAINFUL IN THE LAKE BURNING WITH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE!   BE SAVED AND STAY SAVED! 🙏🏼✝️  NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.
Rip queen.  Luv you 💓
What a genuinely sweet humble human being
Nice extended video
Wow, I never saw this before but what a great interview, Jonathan has a knack for making his guests feel relaxed and comfortable, and she has such an amazing personality.  A life well lived.
Rest in peace our queen of rock and roll 😔
So rude when the dude took the bag and said something abt putting it on eBay! Idiot!!!!🤬🤬🤬😡
Class act ...such poise dignity and  talent...Heaven got a little more lively this week....:)
I refuse to accept that she's gone. She was - is - a beautiful soul. Pure class. She's alive. But in another world. You are loved, Queen.
Jesus christ her bracelets! Bet the sound technician was going mad..
I’m still in a saddened shock but fully understand that we are not eternal, no one. Despise my lack of opportunity to see her perform. I am grateful that her genuine persona and remarkable talent and artistry are ETERNALLY CAPTURED on video for posterity. She will continue to provide humanity with moments of happiness and joy, sprinkled with gems of wisdom. Thank you, Ms. Tina!
Simplesmente A melhor...
I love Tina here
Late tina was obout 78 here and she stil had in her like always and no younger one was able to keep up with the late 👑👑👑👑 💯💯💯💯💯  ICON , LEGEND,VOICE HER TALENT WAS NEXT LEVEL 💯  LATE TINA TURNER 👑
Every interview or recording I watch of this beautiful soul just has me in awe with a smile and happy. R.I.P. Tina.
Amazing! Legend!!
GREAT SINGER, GREAT PERSON YOU WILL ALWAYS BE IN OUR MEMORIES.
All the great ones are dying 😢😢❤
Crazy how every journalist keep asking her about Ike which was so long ago at that time already and never really asked her about her music and her “now”.
And in the span of nearly eight months, two queens have past on into eternity.
Brilliant Tina turnerxalways great performers r I p
Rest peacefully Tina
Tina had the most lovely husband. How many men would give their wife one of their kidneys? I'm sure they're both glad they eventually  married.  Oprah said she married for security. She was one of the biggest (if not the biggest) singer in Europe. She didn't need to marry for security. She loved that man from 1st sight but she was hesitant due to her previous abusive marriage. This was a lovely interview. Jonathan was so kind to her.
What chemistry between David and Tina! That's real love right there. What the world needs.
Given her health issues I truly hope that she was able to enjoy her retirement years at home with her husband. A rest well deserved…RIP 🙏
Wow to think she is just 3 years away from her 80th birthday here is crazy ❤
This was a brilliant interview. The host was in many ways far more respectful and kind than many American TV show hosts.
simply the best
As a LIVE AID PHILLY Vet, can't get enough of T I N A....
Love the audience for giving this fabulous woman all her flowers!👑🎤💐
"RIP" beautiful soul.
Tina always with  tonns of energy and  great  smile. R.I.P Tina.
Rest in peace❤ she is and will always be remembered as a legend!
Are you seriously asking Tina about Ike Turner?! Even after all those years you want her to repeat old ground just to get her to tell the same old tragic story on your channel. It's not like you didnt already know the answer to the question already. It was pretty much known that the woman hated being asked about her abusive past.
Nowadays young people say "legend" every time a person does something they admire.  They have no real concept of what legend really means.  Tina embodies that word as well or better than anyone else.  Rest in Love.  You'll be missed . . .
Legend! <3 RiP Queen of Rock'n Roll <3
Standing ovation just for showing up ❤ icon
RIP Tina❤😪🙏
She came and did what needed to be done
😢😢😢😢❤
Nam Myoho Renge Kyo.  Until we meet in Eagle Peak.

Loved Tina!!!!!
RIP
RIP
I was just telling my work friends the other day how all the major influences in my life are leaving... Betty White recently. So, I made mention that Tina's  leaving would just tear me up along w/ Dolly Parton (had just watched her latest performance @ the CMAs a MUST WATCH) so we all did the roll call of phenomenal women. Ya'll someone bubble wrap Dolly Parton. Dolly, Helen Miren, wait, I better stop mentioning people. We were talking about phenomenal showman Noone could copy and mentioned Bowie & Prince then.... (Good thing I'm not narcissistic to believe I have the power.)
The LIONESS is gone. 😢😢😢
She is one of the most real people of music.....beautiful inside and out. Love her. ❤ RIP TT.
She was an all round class act!
She will deeply be Missing. I feel sad That All our legends, figures and rôles models are leaving 😢😢😢😢   FOREVER in my Heart QUEEN Tina.
Rip darling 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Farewell legendary Queen 😢Thank you for the music and your inspiration...your songs have helped me thru hardships in life. You're loved and terribly missed! You were and always will be the best!
Love, love, love Tina!!!   She will be missed.
She lived her life on her terms. What an icon. Classy, funny, talented, a ray of light. Dancing with Bowie I bet.
She’s an icon. I’m 42 years of age and there aren’t many left. Cher? Kylie? Elton? Madonna? I’m just glad that I’ve been alive to witness them. Popular music these days will never create icons such as these. It’s very sad.
🙏😇😇God whom I would like us person with heart and will make my place distant for her the light that never goes out God that I would like us person with heart and will make my place distant for. she the light that never goes out 💡♥️🙏
RIP Tina Turner 🌹
Together they'll meet in heaven, hugging again 😊❤😇🙏
She was so sweet and inviting Tina will surely be missed.!!!
Tina, you were simply the best.  RIP
Wonderful! Rest, Queen!
She lived her life to the fullest ❤ and she said her happiest moments were after she retired, what more can one ask from life ? She will be missed
Rest in Peace Tina. ❤😢❤
Great tribute to Tina Turner 💕
Fare well Queen of Rock.
Fare well Queen of Rock.

The fabulous Tina Turner, simply the best!
What a amazing lady god bless her soul ameen inspiration
Tina was and will always be "Simply the Best", she really really was an amazing woman.....may she RIP... 💗
I saw Tina Turner live in 1990 in the UK....such a class act! RIP Anna Mae. You were a legend in your own lifetime.
One wonders what was running through Ike's mind as he watched Tina totally eclipse his own performance career. She became a rock queen and he became a...well, you chose the word.
Simply the Best RIP
Such good people who are willing to take Tina under their wings and help her elevate to the stardom she wish to be and deserve to be. The world has a serious empty space now she has departed...for sure she will be welcomed by people familiar to her and live on.
What a beautiful soul! RIP
She's meeting Bowie  How emotional
TINA I LOVE YOU PITER ARTIST FROM POLAND 🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
We love you Tina-what a fabulous, fabulous talent-you really were the best!💝
Love You Tina! Miss you so much.💙🎶💙
R e s t ❤Tina. ty.
Aside from the massive amounts of talent and style, she was always sheer class, on and off stage. She may be gone, but she has legendary status which will never die.
Tina was an absolute superstar and a blueprint for a lot of the girlies of today
I did not know she was such an awesome, unassuming, normal, sweet lady. So authentic. RIP dear Tina
😩 such a lovely tribute Jonathan 😘 an amazing talented lady. Wish I’d of seen her in concert 🥲
2 most of my favorite ppl and now they are both gone.
Rip. Thank you for the music. You will never be forgotten. ❤
There will never be another one like her. Even today's artists can't touch her. Miss you Tina but you're music will live forever ❤
I didn't know Tina had a stroke until yesterday   I know just how hard it is to cope with having a stroke  because I had two of them myself 😢😢😢
Tina: clack rattle clack clack clack clink clonk CLACK CliNK Clak Lovely lady
What a  legend
Wow she looked great there, beyonce stole her whole act. Beyonce owes tina turner everyyhing
I'm at that age where a lot of the icons of my time are dying, it's inevitable but very sad.
RIP Miss Turner, Your Simply the Best!! ❤🌹🙏🏻
