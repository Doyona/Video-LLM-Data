That Guess Who fcking killed me rofl
not even turbo on the miata tsss
The MX5 would love to be lower especially at the front.
Is it wrong to ask, does The Manifold seem to be a good name for a car themed gay club?
I'm sorry but acclera are not good tyres 😂
Rory's exhaust was nice n sophisticated.  Alex's was just full on ADHD spec lmao
Makes me want to live in Scotland…wait…no, MOT, insurance, petrol prices…no Giant Explorers…but at least I thought about it!
Them wheels are absolutely hideous 😂
The Humble Mechanic 👍
Its  in Austria not in Germany where the look yhour groundclearance
What tires on the miata? Nevermind found it: NS2R
All very well as long as Taylor is a big boy I don't mind him charging the usual fortune my E38 costs every couple of months. I'm BB only though
These guys have the best dress sense with the very Best trainers very stylish, especially Alex Look at those shorts, they’re mustard 🫵🫤
How much do you want for that Z4 is it for sale?.
We got everything to give this car a full restoration only for Misha to say it was bad and advice Rory to not drive it himself on the ring 🤣in the end mods can't fix a fucked car.
Taylor saying mine was the best the last trip then proceeding to require a new engine after doing 140mph for about 5 minutes before getting to the track 😅😂
you dont really need to lift engine to change exhaust header in miata, its bit difficult tho
I like that Rory asks really good sensible questions
Could you confirm the colour specs and company you got those Cooper S wheels refurbed at please? They look exactly what I’m looking for
okay, i honesty thought alex's mx5's plates meant something like libido sydney. lmao
It's only you guy's who thinks the video is funny! Try a more serious video these are tedious and unwatchable
Love your show guys! Cheers!
I thought they were dog treats 😂😂
I wish the U.S. had such cheap used car prices. Minus the rust atleast that is.
ear buds work better for highway driving in an NC than a crash helmet.  I know from experience
Having  watched the previous video I do think the MX3's registration plate should be changed to: ID10TNY
Your videos only make me realize I don't have any friends to muck about with on cars!! Love the content blokes, keep it up.
Ohh nooo it sounds like a bag of spanners ☹️
You skipped over the part where those Accelera 651s are the biggest pain in the arse to fit to the rim. The side walls are harder than girders. That being said the set on my car grip very well for amateur track use.
Auto Alex and MCM . . . Please?
5:52 he's a Toorak Cowboy then.
She sniffed the bofi racing package because they always send us sweets with the parts 🤣❤️
To much goofing around filling the video. Used to like this channel
£1500 for a Z4 coupe 😮
legend when he cut anti roll bar i was like dude youre missing the point whe ended up dropping the sub frame 🤣
I want Alex's t-shirt the 205 1 mint as mate
I think 1st dent repair can fix that
Alex is a great friend too Taylor and Rory and it's good too have Taylor as his own personal mechanic too fix their cars.
7:45 HE DID NOT FOLLOW THE CHRISFIX WAY OF DOING IT
I honestly think you should of added Taylor wages for fixing all the cars into his budget seeing how Rory’s budget was blown
Schumacher was and always will be the best F1 driver. Quite ironic the BMW Mini blew up not in France, not in Belgium but in Germany of all countries.
Hi Alex!! Could you do an in depth tutorial on how to drive a manual car?
Errrr..... Mr. AutoAlex; you failed to mention the best AND cheapest performance modification anyone could apply to ANY car.... Us, in the know, like to call it 'the go-faster stripe'........
Really want the mazda now 🤣🤣my offer is £20 and a big mac 🤣
What about wheel alignment and tracking?
13:32 when you drop your Baguette in front of a french person.
no Tylor even in 720p it looked pretty shit :/
Lost respect for that pops n bangs map. Absolute nonce behaviour
Come on Milwaukee sort the lads out making my arms tired just watching 😂
The MX5 may be too loud for the ring haha
Taylor is looking so much thinner
The small alteration on the booooooot gives the BMW better downforce. . . . . .. HONEST!!
Rory, I feel your pain. Having to work alongside such a tool must be hard work.
Chicken nuggets
Watched this video, great stuff, as always! Also, was curious about your partner Tire Streets, thought I'd take a look! Was amazed at the prices, never heard of Accelera tyres, but read lots of reviews and they get pretty good reports (checked the reviews at Black Circles). Anyway, placed an order for my E350d using your promo code, and saved myself £600 vs Pirelli, or about £400 vs Toyo! Even if the tyres are not all that good I'm still happy! Nice one! Keep up the good work!
Nice Blade! Bring it to the channel!
Straight pipe all miatas.!
Bc coilovers are already 1600 I Think , no way within budget
Oh how I wish this was my job!
Been watching Car Throttle and it's not the same without Alex on it
The Z4 has a lot of character now. Just get a quick polish indeed.
With the strict rules in Germany, that MX5 won't even make it to the ring
“Nobody knows you..” that was cold! Why you gotta do Taylor like that?!
man they are really scraping for presenters these days!
Great channel! You have inspired me to start too! I have 4 videos so far 😂
What are the "Jap Car Picks" on the white board? Candidates for projects, just favorites ...?
Made my day meeting you at santapod ..the guy with the stripped out eo focus
The pops and bangs from the mx5 sound like the start of Crazy Frog from back in the day 😅🤣
There are a lot of reasons, but the miata will be the best car
Stop whinging  Everyone knows you have to bend the rules in racing.  Then pay the fine or take the penalty.  F1 Cough😂
8:40 I watch it in 720p on iPhone mini, and it still looks like shit.
So £3000 plus 2 days labour x2 blokes!
You guys are awesome!! I laughed so much. I love your camaraderie. Keep up the great work guys. All the best.
Watching that mangled boot lid made me cringe inside, and those disgustingly beautiful orange piss wheels look perfectly out of place on a miata. Watching your channel is always a guilty pleasure, a lot of cringe and wholesomeness. Keep it up!
Happy birthday Rory 🎉
at @5:18 i honestly thought @autoalexcars said "shall we have a look in your basement"... made the scene so much funnier haha
2 days later no subtitles </3.  I can not watch this without subs.  edit: subs finally added, useful for the deaf subscribers <3
Overall great content though, great work guys just the sponsor bits are a bit much/cringe.
The sponsored segments are reminding me of the Wayne's World scene about sponsors...
I only realised when he was playing air guitar that he had previously starred in Bill and Ted
In france you technically can do no mods (that means be smart about it), and they don't take your car but they give you a date for an inspection for it to be fully stock, and you can't drive it in the meanwhile
I really liked all the swearing, made it feel like I was working with you screwing things up myself
"How good are they in the wet?" ..... "Yes" 🤣
Power flow are awesome man. I needed a exhaust years ago for my Clio 172. I got one custom made and fitted for 190 quid at a reseller. couldn’t believe it lol. Average price back then for the typical, cobra, miltek, scorpion was still around 400 and would still need fitting.
Why do you have a white numberplate in front and a yellow in the back? What is the purpose of this??
Sounds good at idle but gets worse to me as it revs out. Just goes infinitely more rice
Taylor is spot on! All noise and looks with zero power adders that's textbook RiceGod
PBS pads are superb...had them in my 172 cup and Cooper S !!
Pops and bangs - huge big nope from me.  All it takes is one pop and a horse could spook and land through your windscreen. Happened to Coldcroft Shires recently, miraculously horse and occupants of car were OK but car the horse landed is a write off.
Great channel
interesting but too much dicking around... I'm off... cya
We all no Taylor likes the rear he open about good on him .
That aerosol job looked shit in 480p on my phone, no need for a close up or 4K. It makes me feel good about my own aerosol work and that's saying something.
Would’ve gone for a turbo kit secondhand and coilovers 😬
what am i missing, didn't this guy had a chanel with 2 other blokes ? (making fun of the 1 that had 0 car knowledge)
Can I send you an Audi to have 3k of mods fitted as I'm going the ring next year too and it's, well, just not at all ready 😩😅 could be the start of a new fixing a subscribers car 😂
Alex is like the YT, it takes you twice as long to do a job with them 'helping' you.
17:17 oof 🤣
I think you won't be allowed on the ring with an exhaust that loud :D
Have you guys removed the 2 little bits of foam in the airbox? If you haven't, do it. I had a "57" 3.0 Z4 Roadster, induction noise will increase by at least 50%! A little freebie to get more NOISE!
accelera tyres 😬 15 years in the tyre game cheapest crap I've come across
I finally realized why i'm always getting hungry watching videos from Alex.   It's because the logo in the beginning reminds me of the early 00s Pizza Hut with the colors and font.  Great now i'll have to go get some Pizza.
i think you're going to put a v8 in it, innit?
They put the name on the exhaust, so when Alex flips the car and burns horribly, they can still identify the idiot who crashed the car.
23:42 shut him down with RACECAR
Does carvertical works for cars from Italy?
Those wheels and tyres on the z4 are absolute pornography 🤤
8:56 WTF LOL hahaha
The way Alex looks at the bodywork
Chimcken 😂
im pretty sure that rear wheel is put the wrong way round, it's supposed to push water outwards, not inwards XD
Can anyone name that manifold. Drumm n bass track
Must have felt weird saying "opel corsa"
It’s like modifying a mums car
Alex you should spend £3000 on your mx5 fixing the two massive mistakes on your bonnet! Sorry had too😊
Rory's birthday present reaction was equal parts joy and shame.
I feel like you guys should be wearing hard hats all the time haha
Honestly I think I'd still take the mini out of the 3. Those supercharged cooper s have a place in my heart especially in that color
I appreciate the proper application and usage of your safety helmets In this video
Been a z4 boot on eBay for 2 years £650. You got 4 front CSL’s on that Z.
Cool video concept, select a viewer/subscriber to assist in a video making mods and have some fun with you making content. Could be done through a merch sale or through instagram followers, tagged people and shared posts. Would create a massive amount of exposure and increase interest in the ig/TikTok accounts and help the channel grow.
QT Taylor lookin skinnyyyyy
1500 pound with 3-5k in parts worth maybe 2k for sale, maybe 3k if you get someone too innocent to barter.  My rule is for every custom part added that doesn't have a credible builder's invoice included for the work (that I can call and ask about if crucial) then that's possibly a reduction in what I'm willing to pay or at the most stock price.  These I'd be fine with (easy to inspect/check, genuine parts, people I could question and give answers, etc.), but when I see pictures of an engine on a stand at one point, I start to tell them good luck finding a buyer that'll pay what they want.  If it's an RX-8 I might take a second look, I flipped those in high school back in 09/10 doing engine rebuilds/swaps over the weekend start to finish and know my way around the stupidly simple renesis engine and solid chassis that is a rx-8.  I have one original engine at 240k miles now, no problems with basic upkeep.  I treat it like a 2 stroke with premix after yanking the electronic metering pump out, that didn't feed enough oil to begin with (to keep within standards), and it runs fine albeit a little rough on fuel economy as they all are.
It is now a LEGAL REQUIREMENT that Maisie the Dog be in EVERY future video.
AutoAlex can you please offer a tshirt to your fans quoting Taylor's timeless comment "These are serviceable items". 😅
I had a bespoke X pipe exhaust made for my V8 Audi S5, removed all the resonators and silencers, went from a grumbling V8 to a howling V8. Tunnels were epic in it.
First time watching this channel and some very funny content!
That MX5 exhaust is disgusting 😂
For Alex giveth and he breaketh away.
Only had 6 adverts in the first 7mins 30secs. Thanks youtube 😂
Where has the South African mate you had gone?
Taylor’s Herbert impression is spot on 😂
Boring episode. Look forward to seeing the ring though
Taylor spent £3k on a £1500 mini?
Jack McNeils old unit ?
Them wheels are horrid in orange 😂
If the MX5 is from the Ford era, change the engine to the newer Skyactive. Thats the most important upgrade. If consumers and insurance companies do not report the issues, how can car vertical figure the accuracy. Have used carfax and got false and completely inaccurate info.
Can't wait for the full send, hehe
Great Video as always ❤
Alex. I really can’t lie  the way you say some words is extremely irritating. However it makes you you so I can’t judge the content based on that.  As much as when you say vury it honestly makes me so furious, still I cannot stop watching your vids😂.  Good job good sir you have found a great balance in your content, it brings me dopamine every time I watch. Thank you very much
''performance cars''
The rear end comment was gross
Very brave of you lot to put this top notch stuff on them 3 lemons...quality entertainment
and the irony of what happened to the MINI is an absolute kicker for Taylor
Sorry Alex but I have to let you know I've been watching your vids for that long, it now kinda feels like watching old family vids featuring a lovable dodgy uncle😂
Do these sort of exhausts pass an MOT? I know for bike tests the exhaust noise isn't really checked it's just an advisory but is it the same for cars?
Also. you're supposed to tighten the suspension with the coils under load, or retighten after 50 miles of driving, otherwise you'll have that speedboat slant. Ask me how I know...
If you loosen the alternator and pull it against the tensioner you have enough room to pull the header without lifting the engine.
Oh my word Alex’s impression of Taylor cracked me up
is taylor gay ?
That exhaust 😁
It looks shit Rory
Yes those pinch bolts are a pain in the ass mine both snapped after spraying with WD40 for a few days before thinking that would be enough haha
❤the hard work
If they could cut back the excessive horseplay, carthrottle videos would be much more watchable
God I wish  where I live I could get  Z4 Coupe for 1500 pounds.
I love the MX5. Add another couple grand, maybe do a junkyard K swap or just a turbo kit, and you can really get moving. Here in the midwest US you could be all in for like $8k lol. I wanna get one asap when I have room.
rory, that hazing after polishing might be because you didnt clean off the polishing compound properly after ur done. if you leave it sitting with any compound on it hazes up
Wonder if you're meeting Ethan and Jack given they've booked a hotel for Germany in their latest video 👀
that exhaust sounds like shit tbh
8:46 can confirm in 4K it does look shit😂
Wow, I love my MeisterR’s on my mk3 but those BC’s look another level. And the Piper exhaust is 🤤.
Mate.. not sure if you aware of your past but you are the spitting image of my old man .. scary
Oh my goodness, you crashed the car before actually driving it Hahahahaaha!
Alex seems like that annoying friend that everyone wants to slap.
I can't wait to see in the next episode whick car won't break down.
Here comes back the miataaaaa
uhh can you turn my Australian 2018 PX2 Ford Ranger into a race car when you are here next?
I'd love to be a presenter on this show because it hardly looks like work haha. 😂 I'm sure it's a lot of work behind the scenes though. But it looks like you're just working on cars with your mates and having a laugh, which sounds like so much fun you'd hardly call it work.
Why is Taylor wearing a hard. It’s a good look, don’t get me wrong. But a bit, odd.
Did you say Opel or Vauxhall Corsa in the CarVertical ad just there?!
I'm sorry but that impression of Taylor at the end sent me over the edge 😂😂😂
Lol your going to get kicked off the ring for noise 😂😂😂
8:58 best clip EVER.
Both those BMWs are the best cars there.
BC BR series are absolute dog shit 🤣🤣🤣
The 651 sport 100tw are really good! On the rain too. The ns2r are really bad...
Dog was in this video 10/10 (also the mx5  X2 :D)
Still can’t believe how cheap that Z4 was, an absolute bargain
3:25 man's got that helmet out of a cereal box or Christmas cracker or something 😂
was it just me, or are Alex's red Miata has Toyota TOM's Igeta wheels? Great video, you guys!
I've had a mk2 MX-5, it died a horrible rusty death.   Always loved the MK3's when modified, love the video Alex 😁
scamverdicktal ends around 4:54.
@autoalexcars When did you team up with Bob the Builder?
How is Rory 30. I honestly thought he was like 22 or 25 at the absolute most...
18:06 sounding like an F1 car
This is the absolute best car show on YT. Every time I want to get rid of my car, you post another great episode and I get all excited and decide my old R55 is a keeper. Thanks.
What's up with the teenage facial hair?
Don't worry Taylor. You can 'borrow' my 350Z. Then you'd have spent nothing at all
Which one will make it to the destination my moneys on the Mazda MX5
Taylors Herbert impression was spot on. Totally unexpected almost died laughing 3:23
What’s with all the advertising is worse than itv
NC Miata engine doesn't need to be lifted to pull the header. I've done it on two of mine, no issues, just a tight tight fit.
Unfortunately, even with everything youve done to Rorys car, it is still a Z4..............
This channel has easily become one of my favourites. The dynamic with Alex, Rory, and Taylor is only rivalled by Clarkson, Hammond, and may.
This guy next to Alex does not have a clue what an anti rollbar has to do..
14:48 jap car picks.... Easter egg?
Got to rate Taylor on his wealth of knowledge on mechanical side of things, this man literally knows everything about cars and rust buckets 🪣 big up Taylor 🙌
When I had a WRX, I had some BC Racing BR Series ciolovers on it and yes, they were very nice.  Good choice.
Alex giving some major “Bob the Builder” energy during that sponsored segment
Happy birthday Rory, cheers❤️
Alex workout films get on it turn old TH jack into a beast
22:10 dentless paint removal… LMAO😂
Piper exhausts never fail to impress.
I'll be honest I thought rory was like, 23 at most
👍👍
One of the best channels about, down to earth affordable cars with the trio’s entertainment.  Next episode seeing that blue smoke on the Mini, was thinking that’s a usual mini thing to do lol. Great video.
Please Alex can you get some more of the heel and toe “save the manuals” T/shirts in
The z4 new exhaust sounds rubbish. I would be well upset if I bought that system and it sounded like that.
Are the tires for the BMW bullocks, bollocks? I think that means cool? British slang is so different compared to USA, even worse when you compare to Texas! We are horrible LOL!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY RORY !! 🎉🥳🎂🎁🏆
my mans made a mazda sound good with simply an exhaust :D
Taylor in a hard hat.....why the hell did that turn me on slightly? I'm booking a doctors appointment asap
I have Autism and I absolutely love all all things to do with cars and automotive. Your videos are always amazing and entertaining to watch. Keep up the good work 😊
Next time you are doing small paint like that, spray in an old ice cream tub or something. Then use a pinstripe brush and paint the chips with paint from the tub. You do it right, you end up with a layer off paint a bit thicker then the original, with no drip. Sagging you will remove with sandpaper, or prevent by adding paint over time. After dry, use some high grit sandpaper and wet wipe it down to level with the old paint.  Apply clear coat.  What I do on my cars. As long as you get colour coded paint, you will have to study it to see it. Takes time, but worth it if you want it to look good.
More maisey content
now that we know, camp jokes are the best.
Powerflow quoted me £800 for a custom cat back on my mk1 mx5 1.6, is that a lot or is that about the right price.
I think Alex has forgot that he doesn’t live in Dubai or Nevada
@autoalexcars give us a shout at the Zedshed if you need a boot lid, got lots of coupe bits kicking around.
Look at all my free stuff!
Im Hoping the wheels on the mx5 were swapped round as the rear tyre is facing wrong direction on video
I love the mx5 I was gutted when I had to leave my one in the uk when I moved to Spain I had 2.2  gun metal grey which the hard top convertible convertible
Learn and laugh repeatably on every video! Top drawer content
why dont I have a yellow hat?
Did i just say Taylor using a torque wrench as a breaker bar….?
Masie is the real star here. . . .
Alex, you claim Taylor has a hair cut every single week... I'm calling you on this, if this is true, why is Taylor's neck hair so offensive?
definitley not me, 31, Laughing at Taylor saying "Fani Mold"
This channel just gets better and better. Thanks Alex, Taylor and Rory for the hours of entertainment you provide. Proper decent videos. You can tell you all genuinely love doing what you do. Looking forward to the nurburgring video!
Love seeing more people using the nc as a base. Love car with a few mandatory mods. Props on the bcs!! Would love a set of those
Alex, has anyone ever told you that with a goatee you look like Jon Favreau?
I'm going to take a wild stab that the Mini does Mini things (not related to any IG content recently....)
Hey Alex where is your s200?
I hope taylors cooper s wins on time seeing as he hasnt had a chance to modify it 😂
We love Taylor seriously bro u got the perfect character for your channel
Im sorry, but all that stuff is nowhere near 3k😂 that’s about 5k of gear
I used to own the green mini 😂
could have bought 8 other clunkers for that same money.
Im rooting for Rory and the Z4
Really love that mx5, I actually want one now. Great series guys, looking forward to seeing the cars in action 👌🏻❤️
You guys are just an amazing bunch, keep up the fun work! Big Taylor fan btw, he seems to know what he's doing and hilarious lad 🤣
Another brilliant video guys , much love  ❤
Excellent again lads 😂👍
I actually love there chemistry
My guess is that Micha scrapes away that bad paint work for no charge, a little bit at a time, 5 times a lap on the compression bumps of "The Ring" .  Not just the 1 car either, I'm guessing all of you will bottom out on the bump stops, he'll drive em equally hard but smoooooth. Hope for your sake the seats have some padding left guys, most of the English guests he has make the same mistakes,  TOO HARD n TOO LOW. It should be fun watching your faces while you're there
Ooooh if i had time you only would have to pay me the travel to u and the materials i could paint rorys poor bmw❤😂
Having a hot chocolate sat in the garden watching the video 😅
21:33 this sounds like Taylor’s fault for being to tall! 😜
4:38 want that t-shirt
I think Rory should be treated to a carbon fiber hatch (and maybe hood to match)
I am so excited for shed fest
Errr...hold on....I just watched a clip of you being all frownyface cause you had to sell Phil. That was a 3 year old clip and Phil's still there...what the hell happened??!!
I see the 3k on maintaining the MINI were well spent 😬
Rory's camerawork is getting better and better, there were some really nice shots in this one !
I had r32 gtr forged 16" wheels on my nc3 looked amazing , alot of chaps in Japan run these , should of try to get a no pro body kit from japan they look amazing
Get Taylor some BC’s!!!
Where’s the cheap eBay turbo kit for the Mazda
The rims on that z4 my god stunning i need me a pair of those!! ❤ Love the content guys
cant wait to see how misha does in a r53
PDR isn't going to fix that top dent it's nearly cut through 😅
Double check your tyres on the mx5. Last time I went to Just Tyres they managed to put one on backwards...
I also have a haircut every week. At summer I actually get it every 4-5 days 😅
You know that you're in a good video when Alex is working on a car wearing a white t shirt 😂
Those wheels look amazing on the z4
what seats does Taylor have in the mini now?
That MX-5 exhaust with the pops tune sounds like a very badly tuned two stroke :')
Lol poor Rory and happy birthday. However the trio should do their best to increase the value of the vehicles they get not damage it or treat it poorly. At least that's what I like to see.., a bit of love and care for these great vehicles.
10:05 my brother in christ, if you breathed that in on the daily you lost at least a year of ya life dont u worry bout them horsies
5:30 looking for that 10mm?
I'm sorry but the MX5 is just such a dreary car with nothing of note about it
Hurry up and get a 350Z at one point ... sick of watching MX5s lol
3:22 quality meme material
:)))) You are gonna die with those BluePrint brakes on the track. Never had such junks in my life. In about 10 min of Touge i ran out of brakes completely. My father's Blue print clutch desintegrated in 6k km. My BluePrint wiper blades were cracked in few months. Avoid that company no matter what !!!
£1500 for those cars? I was born in the wrong country.. :(
alex been getting buff lately although that is fairly easy for such a small little man
Really really hope you fix the oil leak before going on the ring!
That lip is absolutely useless, best not fitting it at all, it has not structural strength, so will just droop.
Sack the camera person from the first scene. It's like CSI Romsey
6:07 he is not happy
Only certified lunatics wear white t-shirts while working on cars 😂😂
❤❤❤ love it!! The guy who made that piper exhaust I bet he's such a cool mx5 guy 😂
I just love this channel.  Wrenching, racing, f-ing stuff up, fixing your screw-ups... just an all around good time.
Should of turbocharged the mx5 for 3k
Love adding mods to cars
Man, 3k on mods is a cool idea, but man, these cars aren't worth it, maybe except for BMW. It's like putting a supercharger on a bicycle.
3K of mods plus labour cost, Taylor should add up the cost and add it to his Mini.
Come for the cars, stay for the doggo
Ruined the z4
Ayyyy Rory I turn 30 today 🥳
Got those acceleras on my E21
HAHAH LOVE THESE LADS BETTER THAN THE TOP GEEZERS LOL
makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up watching the car body work on this channel as someone who is a qualified car body repairer 😂 gotta love it tho
May the shiniest exhaust system win!!!
That MX-5 sounds like a marching band.
Glad to see Taylor Back 😂
Best mode would be alignment xd
Did you really just say you put acceleras on a performance car that youre taking on a road trip to the Nurburgring? Even if they were free, youre a brave man:P
Looking forward to seeing that! Stay safe on the autobahn

One episode a week is not enough.  Also, please finically ruin Alex, so he has to setup an OnlyFans. 😇🍑
Great content, but need more Maisie content (and bikes) keep up the great work Alex
I reckon Taylor is definitely Gay 😊
you utter bar stewards wrecking rory's bmw!!!!   #treamrory
No ones gonna give u stuff, no one knows you😂😂😢
I hate Thursdays because there is one week difference between each and I have to wait for so long to see next episodes on Autoalex Cars channel.
Mark 3 is naff.... I thought naff was a purely South African word lol
Gonna be epic seeing Alex blow his engine trying to push it. Taylor don't feel bad about the extras Alex got. It's not going to help him, as even Piper covered up their branding on the exhaust, so they're not associated with it.😂😂
Your insurance company would love watching you put unclaimed mods on these cars 😂😂
I have a tuktuk so I’ll get a picture of the anti roll bar 😂
Hi how are you doing
17:15 I used to like you
Mazda MX-Sterrato looks mint in them Lambo colored wheels! 🤣
Advertising at the start an before 2. Minutes car vertical add at 4 minutes 😂
Thank you ! 'Find out how Racecar these Racecars are'.... 🙏🙏
Can’t wait to see the rest !
Taylors sass makes this channel so much better 😅
5 mins of work, 20 mins pissing about, 😅
Even Stevie Wonder says that bodywork is shite! 😂
The only question now is how far into the journey will it be before Alex regrets his choices?
You have found a great balance in this channel, just enough mechanical stuff, just enough arsing about, and lots of personality. The editing is tight and it never gets boring.
It really is MCM copy and paste. Even the musical instruments
I can confirm those 651sports are great in the wet
disappointed, no jokes about whos going to get beaten round the ring.....
It's not an oil leak, its a constant oil change, always got clean oil :)
When is the podcast you mentioned starting again?
BobThe Builder hat on Alex looks gigantic 😂😂😂
Should of tuned that MX5!
Bob The Builder = Taylor ?
Every week lol!! I have one every quarter
18:35 the z4 wheel was spinning freely when he revved the engine... why did that happen?
Is there a reason Taylor looks like Bob the Builder?
I can't believe Taylor did not get a set of coilovers.
Alex blowing into the manifold reminded me of that house robbery scene with Jim carry from “fun with dick and jane”
There is no way Taylor will not "borrow" a set of tyres for the ring
13:27 whyd the rear wheel spin that freely when he revved the engine? Is that normal? Or was it not in gear?
23:55 mods b4 fix . Everybody knows that :D
I swear... With Taylor not even his pipes are straight.
Shave that tash off Alex you bad bad man
Poor Z4 Coupe! It seems Alex isn’t putting it on his clumsiness for the camera! Lol
I sware the tyre they keep showing on Alex's car is the wrong rotation
Watching in 720pand it still looks shit 😂😂
Poor Rory's beemer, you absolute savage cowboys 🤣
Budget tyres!!! PMSL  How much do you save by skidding into a tree in the wet.  Bald premium tyres are better than new budgets.  I know you are on a budget...but tyres and oil personally I would not get the cheap ones.
Really thought you would put the supercharger kit or at least cams kit on the MK3 mx5, to make it a little bit more powerful.
why alex face look like 6 y/o ?
Lost my shit at "Dog treats" lol
I know its not a competition but...... I'm so much more invested in this than Mr Armstrong's Ferrari because of MAISY THE MOST ADORABLE DOGGO! XD
Gotta love a fanimold :D
I thought Rory was about 23 🤣
Can corfirm, 4k makes it look 4000 times worse.
In Germany, if you have parts on your car that are not on the paperwork, or you do not have the official paperwork with you that says those parts can be fitted to your car, then they can impound it, remove the sticker from your rear number plate that signifies that it has a current MOT and you will have to collect it with a trailer. Then you will have to put it right and then re MOT your car. However, they have no jurisdiction to impound a car from another country, as each country has different rules to Germany and no ordinary policeman is going to be aware of what those rules are. However, they could impound it if there is something with the car, mod or fault, that makes the car dangerous to drive on the road.
More dog content pls
This could get messy!! Do 1 ads!!
behind closed doors cut to a shot with the garagedoor open also you knew about the mini upgrades in the last epidsode
wow. Maybe time to unsub.
Singing in the pipes, was that a shot or a shotout at Mighty Car Mods ?
It wasn’t a lot of blue smoke Rory!
I got a Cobra backbox and a BBR manifold on my MK3 MX5, can confirm, sounds epic. No crappy pops and bangs map though 🙈I've owned all three of these cars and have been enjoying these vids a lot 😎
I once reversed into the guy cable for a telegraph pole. Didn’t affect the car and I soon forgot the dent in the tailgate. Peugeot 205 about 27 yrs ago.
Is there ever an episode where Taylor doesn't use a crowbar!
Rory's BMW is the first Bangle era car that I've seen rusting .... hmmm
Ain't nobody gonna deal with that oil leak on the Z? 🙄🤔
Can not wait for the next one
Alex are you sponsored by a very good washing detergent company or do you just have many white T shirts that you insist on working in? 😂
"I spent my money on bodywork"  ... the way he said it 🤣🤣🤣
Goddamn Z4´s looks good
Them orange rims don’t look right
Kool kontent fellas 🤘
I changed the video quality to 144p and that paint job Rory did finally looked half decent
Can’t wait for track day, great job, cheers mates!!
should of done a map.....
How on Earth does Alex get through these videos without being punched repeatedly?
Taylor with the yellow workmans hat on...like a real life LEGO man!
Thats a very pretty FannyMould!
Modifying your car in Germany is ridiculously strictly regulated. At least if you're German. If the exhaust is slightly to loud for example, they shall rain eternal doom upon you. And if police doesn't do it, the TÜV (german MOT equivalent) is gonna rip your wallet and your life apart. Also police here love to go to car meets and randomly pick out people and have their car towed and taken apart to check if they can find something illegal, just to piss them off. And then help themselves to a lot of your money. EVEN if there is nothing wrong with it. Seen this happen too many times. Mostlikely a lot of german rozzers are very jealous. Also the regulations are getting stricter every year. So they basically hate anyone whose car isn't obviously stock.
Looking forward to that e36 estate video for sure
TopGear vibes, Great episode lads, keep at it.
“Yeah yeah you are prehistoric” creased
another shit day at work, this time followed by the perfect content needed to aid it a bit!
Alex don't bully dear Taytay
8:38 - Yes it does :D
i no you wont reply to this , but next month at the british car museum show can i bring my dog along  cant see anything on there site about dogs , japfest allowed him in lol
Glad to see Maisie in good health
Got a supercharged mx5 mk3 and with suspension upgrades its a completely different animal
Is this VILLAGE PEOPLE AUTO
And then Taylor spent probably  another £400 on a new engine
On Taylors comment, I am watching in 4k, and it does in fact look shit.  That being said still prefer the Z4. Cheers 🍺
Man the NC is such an ugly design 🤢
You can change the front ARB on a Mk3.5 Mx-5 without cutting it!  I know, I've done it on my driveway, no lift.  Also, that Mx-5 now needs a tune due to the new exhaust, otherwise there won't be any power gains
nice CBR 900 Fireblade
I hope you get you bike problems solved and you have a better bike track day next time. I am the tramp with the long beard who parked next to you at Snet today
great fun
Cool content! But why are subtitles not available anymore?
I would hate to work with Alex on anything, he can't help but annoy people, I'd have to pick him up and hang him on a coat hook out of my way.
XXIII
Sounds better than Phil
That front anti-roll bar might have well been made of kit kat foil
I've got a soft spot for the MK3, mainly 'cos i'm fairly certain it's the only MX5 i'd be able to fit in.
Please make Taylor wear that yellow hat for every single video from now on. Thank you.

Sorry but taylor in that hard hat all I can hear in my head is YMCA 😂 everyone loves taylor.
4k yes it still looks sh!t
Not gonna lie, your videos have really got me thinking about an R53! That supercharger whine is addictive
The ADHD was strong today, hey Alex?
