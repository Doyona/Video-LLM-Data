They were alway gonna drop points. I’m just surprised their run went on for so long ..
Arsenal are mid table on form
Currently no one will beat city especially on thier home : arsenal is done
How have city played 2 less games than arsenal ?
How  could they lose it in one game out of 38 games?  They would rather be underdogs and win it than be on top and lose.Would u rather be a small fish in a large pond or a big fish in a small pond?.Arsenal are Champions
Yes.
It’s over for arsenal on Wednesday night. Man City is winning the league
Of course we do. But even if we do it’s not going to be easy. We have to beat Newcastle. I think we have unfortunately threw the title since the injuries to both CB and reserve CB.
Arsenal would of already won the league but Pogba let them down. Graham Souness
Haaland will crush Gooners and they know that so they are terrified of him.
even beating City I wouldnt have them favourites... they still have to play Newcastle away and Brighton at home. They wont be easy games the way Arsenal are falling apart
Why is Karen there? Jamie and Neville were just fine on their own she adds nothing
Love all the morons who "saw this coming". Extremely lazy analysis. The fact is the injury to Saliba has had a massive affect - with him we've conceded 0.9 goals per game and had a 78% win percentage. Without him we concede 1.8 goals per game and our win percentage is 40%.  His partnership with Gabriel is key to Arsenal's system, as well as his partnership with Ben White and Thomas Partey. With Saliba, Ben White can push on more but he has to drop deeper with Rob Holding. And Partey's heat map is far deeper without Saliba's pace behind him to cover any counter attacks.  It's not rocket science.
Karen good pundit
The thing is noone wants aresnal to win the league purely because of their fans. Some of the worst fans in football.
they got no hope in hell draw wont be enough
The only way Arsenal are winning against City is if the game goes to penalties.
Not really. It depends how we perform afterwards. If City beat us, then we have to win our last 5 games and hope that City loses some of theirs.
Arsenal lack the depth, maturity and squad rotational management to continue to beat the odds properly. They'll continue to crack under the pressure unless they work on their glaring weaknesses.
No chance
It's too early to be saying Arsenal have to win. City are second for a reason - and they still have 3 away games against teams in the top half of the table, as well as 2 games against teams in a relegation battle.
Going to be a good match
City have potentially 12 games left to Arsenal’s 6. If Arsenal don’t win the league it’ll be the biggest bottle job since Spurs..
If they want it in their hands they have to win, the game does not decide the season though
Let’s take a precedent from the past. City were in a similar situation against Man United in 2011/12 and against Liverpool twice in 2018/19 n 2021/22 respectively. All those teams were more talented and experienced than Arsenal and City still came out on top.  The form City n Arsenal are in, it’s going to be extremely arduous for the gunners to bounce back.   Imo they have bottled it.
The way Arsenal are capitulating thru defending against opponents reminds me how Acmilan  were doing the similar thing when they lost their main French keeper maignan…it’s literally the same thing SALIBA is the backbone of the Arsenal defence and MAIGNAN is the same for Ac.Milan
"Man city will still have tough games" shows upcoming matches against mostly fodder
Arsenal can win the league with out winning against Man City
Definitely a must win for arsenal. If they can do it, the confidence would be priceless. City still in the champions league so Pep will be chopping and changing his players. Big game Thursday but still many games to go. It’s better to chase than to be chased. Can Pep keep his mind clear or will he overthink lineups which could disrupt the way City play?? Exciting end to the season looms
Arsenal have thrown it away already.
That my Grans jacket!
Arsenal won’t win a trophy with a court jester in goal.
Realistically, Arsenal have to win. If they're drawing with half an hour left, Arteta will have to assess things whether it's worth risking pushing for the win and risking the loss. If Arsenal are battering City but just not converting, then they might as well continue, but if it's really tight then he'll have to decide whether or not to gamble. I think he'll look at the upcoming games from both and decide before the game what he wants to go for.
Imagine the pain of winning at city and then dropping points elsewhere
What worry’s me is Neville seems to be siding for Arsenal all of a sudden is he alright
Facts. If city win every game left this season they win the league.
Yes
Everyone knows that's not happening. This is like getting a fat slob to challenge a black belt in judo.
Well obviously it is now is it really  because m city will win all the other games imo but it wouldn't surprise me if arsenal dropped points in other matches even if they do win that match if the last three matches is anything to go by anyway?🤣
Take a shot everytime one of the pundits mentions the word "game!!!".   Good luck!!!, I think you'll need it.👍
People too often think of league titles and run ins in purely mathematical terms. If Arsenal want to have the confidence and motivation to even give themselves a chance of winning the league, they absolutely have to win at Manchester City. And all the signs point to they can’t, and they won’t.
Yes
How come Man C have over 100 criminal charges of cheating and they are still allowed to play? 100!
Gary called it from day one and the arsenal fans behaved like he was completely out of order for giving his opinion. Cant wait to see them bottle it against City on Wednesday.
IT'S STILL IN ARSENAL'S HANDS IF THEY AT LEAST GET A POINT AT THE ETIHAD AND DRAW 3_3 THEN ARSENAL CAN STILL WIN THE LEAGUE
100% per cent yes
Without Saliba Arsenal look like… Arsenal
Ye. Yes they do.
Well, yes, because they will probably drop points to Newcastle and Brighton, at least.
Gotta say Karen karney is the worst pundit on sky
City have an easier run in the league, but also have the FA cup and Champions League too.
Arsenal have had draws against Liverpool West Ham and Southampton recently, 3 very winnable games and now they have to go to the Etihad then St James’s so if they win the league from here fair play to them
Who's the random lady acting like she knows about football 🤨
Technically no. Realistically yes.
I said this 5 6 games ago that arsenal could choke as they’ve not been here before I knew this could happen. I have to be honest they really look nervous and you can see it’s starting to hit them but it’s normal they haven’t been here before.
Man city 5 points behind with 2 games in hand its in city's hands mathematically 😅
I hope MAN CITY win
Yea
Arsenal have to play Jorginho with Partey against city. The midfield goes missing when thet dint have the ball. Holding needs protection to.   City will look ti exploit the left back spot that Zinchenko vacates and they will come with the high presss
were getting thrashed by city
yes
Well they got no choice now they've bottled the last 3 games they've put themselves in this difficult spot there not capable of beating City....  until Arsenal overcome this mental weakness there not gonna win the title.
Not really a fan of man city infact i would love to see them win nothing this season but it's looking like an unstoppable treble and well deserved but there will be drama too come before hand.
Last time we (Chelsea) finished midtable we got the opportunity to take any title hope away from Spurs. And even after that abysmal season that game is my one standout memory of the 15/16 season.  Would love to take away Arsenal's title hopes this season.
Anybody got a Southampton kit with Ramsdale number 7 I can borrow for today?
Why are they all Whyte? Haven’t we moved on from here?
Sucks that Arsenal are dropping points left right and center , was hoping they could see the league out. Aaah bloody city winning it again
We shouldn't be talking about arsenal now, 2 games in hand city are first
Quite simply yes
Choking.
Women are very slowly taking over the men's game.
They won't beat city.
No.
Carragher espousing the mentality of a player that's NEVER won a league title
Agree with Neville here tbf. Secured UCL and not favourites anymore, we have a lot less pressure and we play our best football without pressure. We can get a result at the Etihad despite our recent form.
They’re bottling it. Arsenal can’t stay on top this long without bottling it 😂
Neville has been really on Arsenals side since they started dropping points. He really must not want city to do the unthinkable n 3-peat
Squeaky brain time
Yes
They aren't wobbling, there down. No chance the gooners win the league now.
What did Gary say (and Jamie scoffed). That Arsenal would not last the course, purely due to squad. He was proved right.
Why they asking carra he don’t know how to win a league?
This is just for views as well as talkSPORT pundits .   The sentence you have never seen a title  race like this you’re in for a treat has been said on talkSPORT this season .   No season will top last season’s title race ever .   The last five years has shown that the season is now over and city will win it they have Holland for crying out loud how many goals has he scored 47 lol   Manchester City will get knocked out against Real Madrid  And that will be the end of the season
If Arsenal boss the City midfield then Arsenal would have a good chance of winning. Haaland is nothing and heavily reliant on others.
Yes they have to win against city but also win all the remaining games .. no draws or losses 😅
Everyone mocking Gary a few week ago..    looks likely now he could be right 😂😂😂
Carragher advising Arsenal how to win the league is laughable 😂
The North London bottle factory is now up and running and will continue to function at peak capacity until the end of the season.
I’m loving to see this unfold. Arsenal always were bottlers. And always will be 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Arsenal fans gonna cry Wednesday night haaland gonna score 5 goals 😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂
So true Jamie 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯
arsenal is so hated for doing well, all types of fans want are downfall, We have had a great season and ppl are laughing at us for bottling a league to one of the best teams in europe..we hvae come far yes but are intentions were to get CL.Why everyone getting jealous cuz we finally had a great season is unusual. All rival fans lets hope that man city can win the title for the next 4 yrs or even forever so that no one can have a chance ,,..Arsenal are the only ones critisied when we challenge but the likes of liverpool and man united arent..when we have tried to stop a team from making every team in this league look stupid
He really said away to Everton they don’t wanna admit arsenal have messed it up 😂
For once I agree with Gary.
City have always had 2 different starting 11s that can win the league. Exactly the same as Liverpool always pushing City to the end losing out by a point is down to squad depth. Arsenal have picked up a couple of injuries and it throws everything off. City have such depth and they’re constantly letting top players go and refreshing the squad which always keeps the team eager and hungry to win. Arsenal are literally experiencing what Liverpool experienced year after year. Although I think Liverpool were a better side in 18/19 and 19/20 compared to arsenal now
It’s all over
I still think City will Win the premier league 😅
Yes
The irony of it…Jamie talking about winning premierships 😂😂😂
How is a draw enough at City when Arsenal have dropped 6 points in 3 games. City wont drop points will they no chance
😂😂
It's done it was after the Liverpool game
😂😂😂all talk from arsenal fans all season 😂😂😂😂😂 can't handle pressure
Arsenal will prob lose at least 4 of their last games
Arsenal will get smoked so let’s not waste our time
Arsenal are the biggest bottlers
Assuming City dont drop points ,aint over till its mathematically  over
Men's football is men's football leave it to the men
City will win every game from here on in. Come this time of season they have proved before and once again will be totally relentless. Btw, Haaland to score again on Wednesday😂.
They don’t have to win but they do the. Need Man City to lose 3 of the last 8
City will get the work done! Arsenal won't...
No manager or team in the premier league nowadays goes out for a draw, Dont even know why people bring this up.
We miss Saliba alot. Having Holding come into the team has us just leaking goals and looking shakey at the back
We know they don’t have to. Mathematically. But probabilistically yes.
Man city will NOT win the league. Disgrace all you want. I am confident. Call me arrogant but i know what to expect. Brighton, brentford, Chelsea beat city, Fulham, Everton to draw. Its not over
Makes the City game much more clear now. 3 points or bust. COYG
Not necessarily but this season they have been the best in the league for the majority and there's no guarantee that the next couple of years they will ever had this opportunity within their hands again
Ramsdale had a nightmare.
ARsenal are TOTT-ering
If Arsenal win & City then get a draw next it’s all up in the air
No chance we are leaking too many goals
Tough run of fixtures for Arsenal, need City to drop points to make it go to the last day
They could win against Man City, which most likely won't happen, but still completely bottle it against Chelsea, Newcastle and Brighton
Why is Karen there
Did any1 actually expect anything less except from arsenal fans?
Why is a woman who has no experience waffling on and on about something she doesn't have any experience of?
City will run over everyone at home. Just Brighton away looks 50/50.
the southmapton game was a game they had to win lol they could beat city and still lose the league. Although they wont beat city
Neville was spot on and will have the last laugh out of all the pundits
Another kitchen unattended tonight.
Arsenal have done great but they've bottled it. Simple as that. Plenty teams have done it over the years. They aren't good enough. Must be disappointing getting this far and getting zero
Whose that random bird
What is Carragher wearing? He looks like a right Nancy boy!
Carra just stop talking lad 🤦‍♂️ yeah but no but much
The treble for City is happening like it or not. Madrid will be the toughest, then they will walk through either Milan team. Brighton will take them to the wire aswell, arsenal won’t beat Newcastle or City.
That a trick question or what, course they have to win, media are propa daft
I'm no Carol Vorderman but I think yes, they will need those points as much as city do 🤔
City won't drop points. City probs can't believe their luck right now.
i think it’s a must win for arsenal but not for city. i think arsenal are much more likely to drop points in the other games than city
Yes.
Silly sill carra sour grapes its a must win for Arsenal
Congrats to City for a 3 point win against Arsenal at 93 points nice
They definitely need to beat City. Their form right now would not beat city to the title in previous seasons so they really can’t afford to keep dropping points and hope City do the same. I remember when Liverpool finished as runners up by only one point with both teams winning all of their final thirteen games. It’s not unreasonable to believe that City very well may win all of their remaining games from this point on. I’m not an Arsenal fan but three draws on the bounce, the fact that they were sitting pretty around 11 points clear only a few months back… even if they do beat City it might not be enough.
Even if Arsenal beat City, it only gives them a 2 point cushion over City. That is crazy, because if they had executed and won these last three games (which they should have), they would have a 5 point cushion after beating city, or a 2 point cushion after LOSING to city. It’s mental how badly arsenal have bottled their position. It’s criminal. Arsenal need to realise how badly they’ve blown it in their last three games. City will win the title by about 5-8 points because arsenal will drop far more points. Currently, one of the worst teams at defending in the league. Classic that arsenal becomes this shambolic in the business end of the season. Arsenal fans must be sick to death of their team crumbling every season in April/may. It’s become their heritage.
They've bottled it
Arsenal have bottled it. Absolutely no idea as to why they've suddenly fallen apart. Shocking. Won't get anything at the etihad next week, definitely not if they play 4 at the back with holding.
Women's football is equivalent to pub team levels
Are all the arsenal fans gonna apologise to Gary neville?
I can only see one result at the Eithad, these last 3 games has cost Arsenal the title. Two games losing a 2-0 lead and drawing at home to the bottom team
No Arsenal can still lose at the etihad and go on and win the title 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 sky ye absolute retards
City gonna hammer arsenal by 2 or 3 on Wednesday
Garry said "We" 😂
It tells you everything when people are saying ‘there still in it’ 5 points clear
Depends if City win their 2 games in hand.
3 minute video to say yes
Getting Brendon Rogers Liverpool vibes circa 2014....City are winning every game from here on out.
What people don’t understand is that they’ve dropped points against West Ham and Southampton. Two games that nobody expected them to drop points in. They will 100% drop more points. Brighton Newcastle Chelsea and city all have more quality than those two. They should be worried
Mathematically not necessarily, but in reality yes we do.
Arsenal have lost the league. It was a good run while it lasted.
Arsenal was expected to win the last 3 games. Their form is slipping and the pressure is getting to them.  It's not over till its over but it's not looking good.
Liverpools late equaliser has ruined them
No, and yes. One side is saying City won’t go keep up a 14 game win streak, the other side saying says their recent performances show they can beat anyone and everyone. Still think there’s a couple of twists but Arsenal need to be as close to perfect as possible if we want a chance
Jamie Carragher has never won a League Title, so you probably don't want to take advice from him 😅😅
Yes
Frog face Neville desperately trying to frame this as Arsenal not bottling it
Arsenal is the kind of team that can beat Man City and then lose to Wolverhampton
Yes it’s a must
Can't beat bottom of the league but sure they can beat man c 😂
huddles at 20 minutes and zinchenko and jesus crying, aren't cut out for a title race. Wait till they find out they don't get a title for being top for 6 months, arrogance to the fullest.
Forget city. You saw us crumble today at the hands of Southampton. We don't look fresh.
Saliba killed the title
Yes, they have two chances slim and none, and slim just left..
Arsenal shouldn't have come back but Southampton we're shocking in holding 2 goal lead the best result they could of had all season probably league best and threw it away
Nice jacket on Carra
With rob holding in defence no he should play for someone like Accrington Stanley
We need to play Xhaka at cb with Gabriel because as well as holding has done he can't he's lacking the pace
Believe it or not, and as Jamie said we just have to make sure we don't lose on Wednesday. Ignore all the noise from media outlets and opposition fans...we are still in this. COYG
Also Sky; 'Do plants need water to grow?'
As a city fan I just want to tell everyone that we still have to play go to Brighton, Chelsea and Brentford and two of them have been solid all season so anything can happen still but let’s see. May the best team win but I’d be lying if I said I’m not happy about arsenal fans getting humble pie in their face. It was needed as they’ve been hyping all season and even to the point thinking they’re going to beat us at the etihad comfortably when their record is so bad there and we’ve already beaten you twice this year
It's a wrap! Lol
Arsenal can still lose the title even if they win at the Etihad
Liverpool still the last club to win the league without breaking the Premier league rules
Yes
Yes
Defo need to win. Man City will body Brighton and evet
Karen Carney looks like a Thunderbird.
Karen Carnte commentate nfm
Done blud 😤😤
Does anyone else remember when people were absolutely battering Neville when he said arsenal won't win the league?
These draws are just no good.  2 goals up in their previous 2 matches and they blow it! I've got no sympathy for the Gunners if they fail to win the title.
Yes they have to win it.
As a Liverpool fan I feel for Arsenal, it’s what we’ve been through the last few years, sad to say but City are just an unbelievable side, you can be brilliant, but if you aren’t near perfect it won’t be enough, Arsenal aren’t out of it yet though, the title isn’t done, they just need to take each game as it comes. And if they miss out, at least they competed, all we can ask for as fans is that your side competes, because that’s what creates magic moments
Arsenal don't have to win against man City it's about the games after   They will win the prem title
To be fair, If you'd told me 9, 10, 11 years ago that Arsenal would be 3, 4, 5 points clear with 6, 7, 8 games to go, I'd have bitten your hand off.
went downhill since saliba stopped playing
They obviously do  They're net 1 point behind now - they even need city to slip up once more
They definitely have to win it... And even if they do, City will probably still win the league.
It’s not about nerves it’s about defending properly. Saliba missing and the team has lost its order
I can hear a terrible squeak coming from north London. WD40 anybody. 😂
Nothing changes. For me since anfield arsenal have had to get 3 points at city. If they had won all 3 games recently then a draw would’ve been enough. But now the game is up. If they have any mental bottle or capacity left we will see it on Wednesday.
Ars that's what you lot should be called hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahabhababaabnaananahanana
I’ve said this all season, Arsenal will end the season trophy less! They have never been in the title race!
Yes
City two games in hand Just put city's name on the trophy arsenal have blown it throwing points away against relegation strugglers twice!
All the media luvvies really want City to fold. Looking forward to Wednesday to see if Arsenal can do something not beaten City since 2015 a long time ago.
This video could’ve been a “Yes” and the video be over
Of course they do you plebs if City win all games now they win the league simple.. Arsenal are bricking it and will drop points elsewhere I'm sure. City too maybe will have a wobble somewhere but this is why BPL is the best league 💯
Doesnt matter, titles been gone for a while
Arsenal where smashing it until Liverpool showed up its over now city will b champions 💙
It was arsenals in jan😅
Who will win the race to the title 👇 Arsenal 🔴 or Manchester City 🔵
Arsenal ain't won at city for a longggg time and it isn't happening this season with city's squad like big Steve told yas the big blue sharks coming 🦈🦈
Yes, of course they bloody do
Off course they have to win , City will beat Arsenal and still have two games in hand which they will win and go clear at the top
No of course we don't have to win 🙄
Yes
Ronaldo better
Arsenal are crap 😂😂😂
Both Manchester City and arsenal gonna have really hard away games no matter what...all the teams they play are in good form in this season...
Its game over for Arsenal. They've got inside their own heads. Man City are old pros at this. Arsenal's time will come though if they keep this squad together.
Don’t let any of this distract you from the fact that back in 1998, The Undertaker brutally threw mankind off the top of the cell crashing through the Spanish announcers table to the canvas.
The city game will be irrelevant if they keep dropping points against relegation fodder
10th!
All these man city haters..... We stand  alone 💙💙💙💙
The way Arsenal are playing at the moment... City might not be the only game where they drop points.
Arsenal could go 3 up at the Etihad and still bottle it. No chance
I personally believe even if city lose against arsenal they will still win because arsenal still have newcastle, chelsea and brighton which they can lose all of them
A low IQ question.
I think city’s got this league
Obviously, but they still won't win it
First
Yes and unfortunately that’s not happening and therefore we’ve lost the title 😢!!!
