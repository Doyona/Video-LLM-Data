Like AJ Tracey – live and direc` 🤪
😂 Anthonyyy Joshuaa 😂
Hi AJ, mate you are a tactician and a good roll mode, I would love to see you fight Furry next to get your hands on that WBC Belt. Cheers Eddy from Australia  🙂
Wilder, Fury. Fight.
Deuteronomy28:7 ► The LORD will grant that the enemies who rise up against you will be defeated before you. They will come at you from one direction but flee from you in seven.
Mr. AJ, don't even listen to big mouth he is not funny he is out to hurt you outside and inside the ring. Don't let him affect you keep your emotional door locked and guarded, things only affect you if you pay them attention, keep your eye on the goal and obstacles will not appear. Make sure you lungs and legs are strong the rest will flow. Give him angles every punch coming in one angle and getting out one angle.
Talking his usual crap.Doesn't this big mouth hype job ever take a day off..eeuuchh.CLICK
Lol this fool needs to fight bro when he losses he wants remach right away but when he is the champ he never fights and if he fight he fights chump
Great men Anthony keep going.
💚 Let’s go champ!
A.J the man congratulations on your win!!! P.s don't listen to Fury. He throws things out there saying he has been away from boxing signaling possible defeat. Don't let that comment fool you. Fury doesn't want you to be at 💯% he wants you to think you already won the fight walking in.....then he gives you a surprise. So prepare as best as you can possibly can. Ignore all that Fury says about you and the upcoming fight.

I am boxing 1 yaer and i want too bi laik You
AJ you sure the best that ever happened to boxing especially in the heavyweight
God bless you champ.
So Hot
My sister just lied to me that you were coming to my house ! A J .
AJ if you read this message please be aware of Fury cheating tactics.  1. Check Fury Gloves  2. Don’t drink water fight night until in the Ring. 3. Have your Father in the corner with the water  4. Check your own gloves for strong smell. Could make you tied before time... 5. Look for different things around you that don’t make sense....  6. AJ wins by knockout!!!!!!!!
Seni çok seviyoruz 👑👍👍👍🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷yolun açık olsun
Josh we love you win or lose
SCARED OF FURY
AJ, in your fight against Fury, he would definitely look to slip punches coming to his head..More heavy punches to the body is very important when targeting the head
so good keep it fight I’m big fans I also support you Bro shout out Anthony Joshua 💯❤️❤️
Tyson fury will knock you out
Queremos ver está pelea Tyson fury vs Anthony Joshua
Just been watching one of your old videos and I gotta say Shaun Murphy reminds me of "Brick Top" off Snatch! 😂😂😂
Wieso bist am Karrierende du bist noch zu Jung Karriere zuerst und mit 40 kanns bei dir Losgehen...Jj vielleicht klappt es auch mit deiner Ex. Sie soll ja nicht leiden wenn du einen lebenspartner in deinen leben hast ..wegen Jj er soll wissen das es NUR die Leibliche Mutter im Leben hat und um ehrlich zuseien einen Eigentumwohnung von 500.000,00 sterling konntest du es sparen oder einer Frau die nicht warten konnte und mit anderen jungs ins bett geht und danach ein Kind von dir macht gat es definitiv absolut verdient ...was du ihr auszahlst bezahlst .....!!!👍👍
I truly believe you are the best AJ! I hope to see you win all those belts live one day
AJ plz audition for Black Panther... i think u belong over there too..🙏🙏🙏
I am from Indonesian like you 👍👍👍
You will  win Oleksandr Usyk and Tyson Fury by KO ,. Arrange the both fight this year , you will WIN both.
Can you add Turkish subtitles? English is tiring me
Hi
Chaaaaaamp
Love u AJ, you'r the best, good bless u, best greez from Switzerland ♥️
Booom!! 💪🏽
Dude your biceps are pregnant.great physique. Keep up the good work.
Kate M had the fanny flutters when she met AJ. The hunk of a man left william to feel insecure, the things he done to her because she did not feel like that towards him really hurt him and her. He gave her a beating after this ego crush. The truth should be embraced.He then messed with the nervous system of this man through his fight with ruiz and other things with aston villa this season as he had the anointed power of science. the corrupt system serving the family that assume they own the world and all the people walking on it.
Fight WILDER YOU COWARD
Yo tam me llamo joshua xd
I could batter AJ
https://youtu.be/KKgXqrl5UF4 Though you would find this funny
When’s the new AJ vs Pulev video coming out Champ, we all need a little motivation in our life’s right now 👑
Tyson fury will smash you mush
Am happy for you bro, congrats. pls my advice to you is to be more decipline, focus, more training techniques, want you to be more confident and don't let fury get into your head to divert your focus, want to see you to be undisputed  champion of the world by taking that wbc belt from fury.
Let's go champ!!!
@anthonyjoshua Wrapped in your arms is where I want to be babes. 😚💞
You know who we want you to fight next you gonna do it or what fuck the money fight to be champion@fury.aj
Are you going to post a video about your preparation and training for that fight?
Great job! Just keep fighting those who are willing to step up and fight you. Don’t worry about heresy as we can see the truth always comes out anyway! 😉
happy new year wishing u gud health happiness and success
william not to happy with Kate for slobbering over you when you glazed the smile on her. She had the flutter,messed with the boys ego.. truth is me. remember.
#anthonyjoshua There's just one thing that needs doing to stop this madness that's going on, I'm happy to do it but I need an army, as many men as you can get, can you help? It is time 💜🙏
Hi AJ. You used the uppercut quite effectively in the last fight. Now, for Tyson F, try to practise lateral (sideways movement).
You should fight Tyson F then wilder gets loser then money 💰 fight for you and winner.
I know your ready for that last belt!  Your being patient so I Hope you get it when you're ready for it! Stay humble Be ready!
💪👏Would you like to see Anthony yard vs Jack paul
Epic knockout aj
You mean that we have to be grateful for new each day, and that's right and wise, Because every new day we have is cause God, this superior being, the creator; let us have. Law of biogenesis Definition (1) The principle stating that life arises from pre-existing life, not from nonliving material.
You are such an inspiration!!!, your attitud is at another level.
After you become undisputed.  Please fight deontay wilder. It would be a great  fan fight when you knock him out. And beat pharmacy Miller for pushing you in the presser
Sending you my full gypsy blood blessings 😬😊 sort fury out buddy he’s not exactly a great role model for the sport il be praying for you bud
My dear brother AJ! I'm so much happy to see you out they as a warrior. And i would like to advise you to stay away from your manager Mr Eddie Hearn because he'll be against you in your next fight against Fury. Take care of everything you eat starting from these very moment to avoid losing your stamina. Be warned brother!!! Thank you.
Make sure you tell the ref in dressing room etc to watch for fury rabbit punches as that's gone be his game plan oh yeah get them gloves checked also bro lol he's gone do all he can to cheat as his only way of beating you everyone gassed over one win over Beyonce who fought nobody an was a one trick pony aha an even exposed himself of ducking that 120 mil offer from you on his own tweet the other week 🤣🤦‍♂️ fury knows those upper cuts are on his way to him an cary much more power now an fury goes in chin down boom good night 👊 plus you fought way better oppenents mainly all been top 10 or champions or former world champions etc so you got this one trust me just don't be gun shy lol!!
Expects pre fight tactics from Fury and if you get it going those clubbing swings will target behind your ears. His hands stay down to protect his Achilles heel but getting there would leave you wide open.
🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬  blood
Peaceful knockout 😂🤍💕
You keep getting better and better with every fight, it's a joy to watch

"Abstain from spending money in their shops" anthony joshua 2020 BLM protest.
You are such a great fighter, person, I appreciate you being genuine. You are the boxer I look up to today, and I will always appreciate you being you. Keep up the good work champ.
AJ - SINCE JOE JOYCE STOPPED BEING YOUR MAIN SPARRING PARTNER YOU STARTED TO FIGHT WITH YOUR HANDS DOWN THATS WHY RUIZ CAUGHT YOU - PLZ GO BACK TO THE HIGH GUARD (HANDS LOCKED TO YOUR CHIN) ONE SOLID UNIT LIKE WHEN YOU FOUGHT PARKER - P.S - BRING BACK THE JUGGERNAUT
Bulgarian television said the crown virus was the cause of Kubrat Pulev's loss
I THINK WE NEED TO ALL ADDRESS THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM THE NEW FRET AT LARGE CORONAVIRUS AND FLU I'VE HAD A BABY CALLED MOTHERFUKER AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO AFFECT SPORTS AGAIN SOON LET'S KEEP A EYE ON THAT 😉
Слишком труслив для чемпиона.
Humble, the guy is the complete opposite to humble. He is a condescending prick
love and respect to everybody Gay J!
Got enough respect for you Aj you’ve stayed the same you from day one and ain’t let the fame and paper change you like it does most famous people but if you fight fury next year  in 2021 you’ll have to step you game up for him, no disrespect at all but my opinion is you’re fight style won’t work against fury he’ll pick you apart how you fought pulev last week you’re power uppercuts are lethal but you need to step up  head and body movement. This is everything you’ve worked for can never work too hard for your dreams
0:11 xx
0:40 she is hot girl and sexygirl.
Perfect.
Omg.
1:02c.
I love this movie.
Such a humble and respectful guy. I have no doubts you will go to the top of the boxing game ( you maybe already there 🤔) not just because you are excellent boxer but simply because you’ve got human qualities that 90 % of the boxers doesn’t possess . Good luck big fella and love from Bulgaria 👊💪
Stay away from Ruiz and you'll be fine.
Sei il mio mito
Sir you have been inspire me alot.Thank you so much Sir
Stopped supporting you since your racist rant about not shopping in white owned business's!!
I will love to watch fight beatwean hime an mike tyson😜😜😜
see the king  may GOD bless u may thunder fire all yr enemies
Hola soy tu fan!  Saludos campeón ✌🙂

What happened to Andy Ruiz  he is the only one so far who can chase you all over the ring for 12 rounds.
his fingers look broken
9ja no dey carry last ✌️ we move, much love bro
DIRECT TO YOU MY BRO: TYSON FURY OUT BOXES NO ONE!!! TRUNKS UP AND OVER STOMACH ( ALWAYS PULLING IT UP DURING FIGHTS) TO PREVENT WEAK POINTS RIBS... ( Watch Otto wallin/ chisora/....all) He love to lean and pushing on people...sap your energy but doesn't try it again once you bully him. CLINCHING WHENEVER CLOSE.. HE CHIN IS AS WEAK AS EVER.... USES HIS RANGE WELL( WITH LONG HAND WHAT ELSE DOES HE HAVE. HIS PUNCH IS NOT STRONG( WILDER HAS NEVER RECEIVED A STRONG PUNCH B/4) He pattern of circling the ring is the same.  You are the faster and stronger boxer, the only one that can control a fight and determine the pace in the boxing ring. Your body shots he can not take... Your punching power will send him running..,...  Non of his qualities match yours   In all the top 20 heavy weights in the last 7 years YOU HAVE FOUGHT THE TOUGHEST...,.,.NO OTHER HEAVY WEIGHTS HAS HAD NEAR THE NUMBER OF TOP HEAVY WEIGHTS..,. EVERYBODY KNOW IT!!!! AS the king we always what PERFECTION when perfection is not obtainable..,,... You have laid  the most solid platform in heavyweight boxing for a long time...,   no other has done it  The records are clear..,..... Well not everyone will want the best for you ..., So now don't ......or should I say stop thinking of others......think of yourself....... The greatest satisfaction in life is self satisfaction..,.. Take it easy bro.... 🙏🙏🙏✌️👍
Love to the uk family from America
AJ best of the best all the time
OMG BULGARIA ADORES YOU ❤️
👑🦁❤️
Fury time!
Love u AJ from 🇮🇳 india.. U should fight glory riko.... Next...
Fury will toy with him like he did Klit.
Yang sayang aku like yang cinta allah coment.
When is AJ gonna fight wilder?? He must fight wilder then fury... or else boxing is shlt like everyone says ... "the best hide from the best"
Can’t wait for fury to knock him about 👊🏻💥
Fake as you can get! Won’t forget what you said!!
You have knocked out fury, this I know!! Much respect for world great
Outstanding performance! On to the next one, can’t wait for it! Let’s see AJ v Fury! 🔥🔥🔥
Hes racist shouldn't be on tv anywhere , dont shop in white peoples shops is what he said get shut of racism and him
Harry Schmidt 2 minutes ago (edited) Joshua only beats Fury with a liver hook K o. on the ropes he has to practice that for 6 weeks, kneeling and left liver hook, Fury is simply too big for his uppercut.
Ai da qdej na Rashiq pastichkata
Fight wilder and make him retire
I seeing rol model to me i love youuuuu
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Anthony  Joshua!💪💪💪👑👑👑
for your son to look up to 😌👊
It's Great to see such skill bought back in to boxing, AJ you totally focused and always thinking when you are in the Ring Not just going for the big knock down, Your Country is so Proud of You, WTG Champ.
Make it awkward for Fury, move around like you did against Ruiz too. Delay the fight they know you are getting better
Congrats from Bulgaria, it isn't about favoritism, it's about who is the better man and fighter in the ring. I personally love the new angles and techniques that you used. I saw that Pulev was in better shape than usual but there are levels to this. Kubrat has good boxing skills but his sportsmanship needs developement. We want to be on Kubrat side but his behavior is what making us to turn against him. Congrats Champ!
Stop dodging Fury!
WE WANT AJ VS FURY
Long reign the King.
Respect for you
K
A.J is a real champ 👑 but can he fight Tyson fury 🥊
I love you AJ! You are my favourite one ! <3
Ayee nigga! Come on my nigga, Anthony Joshua is the best, my warriors  No. 1 bro , greetings man , RESPECT 🔥 👌 🙌 ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆
Anthony,  U are amazing..  I have no words to describe how impressed I am.. the way you talk.. the way you move.. the way you look.. you stand very high.. very wise man you are .. even so young.. respect from BULGARIA 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💜💙💚❤🧡💛💜💙💚❤🧡💛👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
AJ vs TF ... it's time!
Урунгел мухар
Fight Tysoe fury 💪
We want to see you against FURY!
its like trash talk goes wrong you showed him stay humble
Lets go aj
RUBBISH
Fury vs josua or wilder va josua pls ++++
Tyson “Gypsy King” Fury
Well done ,can always fight again
Anthony Joshua is such a class act.  You do those belts proud.
The british public, and boxing world are starting to think you are scared of Fury. If you can't get the fight on in a whole year of 2021 - don't bother calling yourself a boxer. I'm one of your fans, if you win, loose or draw not matter. But, it matters if you run from fights.
We wanna see Wilder next
AJ👍👍👍👍
Поздрави и браво шампион. Продължавай все така напред. 👏🤝 Respect
excellent bro.
Wtf were those uppercuts??? So that's definitely a thing now... 🐂🐂
Machallah broer 🤛👊🤜👏👌
Great fight champ. Can't wait for the undisputed fight
If it is the Fury fight next, I'd love the ring walk music to be the Bob  Marley tune "crazy bald head" Its perfect against Tyson and a throwback to Lennox against Holyfield
Love AJ, True Champion....they don’t come often so let’s enjoy him while we have him
Bro you are such an amazing human being like wtf how is that allowed
We want you to fight Tyson
Who ever got the last belt is next. I do want see you take out wilder just for giggles
I love this sexy man ..omg♥️♥️
Nice fight champ, that right hand's really dangerous.
I'm Bulgarian and I want to say the better fighter won. Respect and good luck!
When is fury vs aj
RACIST !!!
Joshua vs Usyk will be amazing match up.
Good fight but hardly a contender for you. Peace.
YOU GO UNCLE
Why does he keep saying you tell me who you want to see me fight next. Im pretty sure he already knows the answer to that its black and white obvious
First fight Wilder, than Fury, so the second one will be more hyped.
Fight Tyson fury pussy! No one wants to see you beat up another 40year old average fighter! You suppose to be a champion fffs
Respect from Bulgaria! This is attitude of a real champion, hope Pulev will learn in the future how to behave.
AJ=ALI
Obviously everyone wants to see Fury next.
call me crazy.. I wanna see A.J vs. Usyk next 🤔
Joshua respect from Bulgaria man! You are amazing :)
Tyson Fury
This is a gentleman speaking. Respect!
Mate you are a true gentleman and great leader in the sport. I felt sorry for Kubrat he was taking so many uppercuts to the face without protecting himself.
You are a true peoples champion Anthony, much respect to you !
you're going to get dropped by Fury
Tyson Fury will demolish you. 😂
Love you A.J
I looooove  him
Ok
am i the only one who wants to see Usyk Vs Joshua first 🤔
💯💯
Pulev years after his prime? Nothing to be proud of.  Stop talking and fight Fury and WIlder.
its not embarassing to loose, embarasing is not knowing how to loose with grace
Rematch with Andy 😍😍😍
A massive role model to any young person looking up to him. Some boxers are total characters but AJ chooses to conduct himself in a dignified and inspiring manor. Somebody for your son to look up to 😌👊
Love this guy brings class back to boxing ..
Stay Hungry, Stay Humble
This was the type of fight people want see. Good 9 rounds of excitement. First one was a bit look but no touch but great fight and great win. Entrance was epic with Rocky tune and finish was balboa style also! Perfect performance. No other boxer beats AJ for entertainment. The slips and uppercuts were brilliant. Can any other heavyweight put on a better show?
Mantap AJ.. Succses full...
Well Done bro but I know who I wanna see next.
Bro douwnloud video 📷📷📷 for more views and subscribe ..... Before any media use it . Iam so happy my big brother. JESUS IS YOUR STRENGTH.
AJ YOU BUM STOP DUCKING RUIZ! YOU ScARED OF GOING TO SLEEP AGAIN?
stop ducking ruiz u bum!
Joshua-Ruiz 3, but you scared.
Hi Aj. You are my inspiration.
I love this movie.
Handsome man
Aj needs to remember in chess there is a time keeper to prevent long overdrawn turns. He should forfeit campion belts for ducking fights.
Next knocked down wil be Tyson Fury
you were GREAT a true champion,for the people you have made boxing a gentlemans sport again,having said that my name is Malik Lgamawi and i would love to spar you ,im 17 but dont worry fam im tough hit me up on malikbxng on ista ,AJ i want to be the best so i would be humbled to get the chance to spar you""promise you this i will be champion of the world"" inshala
I'm bulgarian, but well done for the victory vs Kobrat Pulev. You beat one of the biggest champions.🇧🇬🇬🇧
Fakyou mam
No one remembers anyone for their money or fame. People remember you for one thing and one thing only, humanity. And Anthony Joshua is a great human being. Love this guy
Congratulations to Joshua from Bulgaria!
Are you Muslim?
Welcome back Champ!
XXXXX
Bulgarian here, thanks for beating Pulev's ass,he spoke too big,deserved the L
Congratulations Champ, Humble as always ❤️ Love for you my guy 🍾🎊🎉 Shoutouts to your Team For helpin you prepare for this Fight and the next to come
Who do I think you should fight next? 1. Eddy Hearn 2. Tyson Fury 3. Either Paul brother  🧑🏿‍🎨
You're just so impressive now and smarter. Thank you for a great fight
AJ, my brother... huge fan of you.. but let me be honest... if u are going to gas out throwing few combinations like how it happened in round 3, I’m sorry but ur chances are slim against fury. Fury was throwing bombs on wilder almost every round and still kept going without gazing out. Again, I’m a huge fan, so PLZ PLZ PLZ, work on your stamina bro. Ur technique is very good, but to use it, u need stamina. Again, I’m begging you, PLZ PLZ PLZ, run of few miles everyday if you have to. But plz don’t gas out. I just don’t want u to loose any fight here after. I still couldn’t see ur first fight with Ruiz. That’s how big of a fan I am. I saw this same issue with you while u fought klitschko. Hope you got the point.
I'm a 16 year old Nigerian, and i'll always look up to being a great and Humble  boxer like you
bro u got YouTube.
How Can You Not Like The Guy
As a Bulgarian, thank you for teaching "our" boy a lesson in humility. He could learn a thing or two from you, and I'm not just talking about boxing. Congrats for the win.
Most humble boxer of all time! Fight Fury next! 🥊💥
Let’s get usyk out the way wait a couple of months so we can have a full stadium and international travel and sell out wembley ! That’s the smartest move
Hey man enjoy your 2 fights for your title after Deontay Wilder Knocks Tyson Fury’s ass out and takes his titles back then Tyson Fury will either go back to crack and alcohol or take your title and fight Deontay again so Deontay Wilder can finally becom the undisputed heavyweight champion he deserves to be
❤ I love you ❤😍😍😍
Well done Aj...you are my hero
ANDY RUIZ AGAIN !!!
Tyson Fury let's see who will freak out
You're such a classy young man, stay exactly the same. You're a winner in all counts. Peace out✌.
There should be no more fights apart from Tyson beat the unbeaten! You wanna put your hands in the air and say I’m the man then you have to fight Tyson beating old men ain’t really proving it!
Bro av ya read this?  Remind him of this!  God Bless 🏆https://www.bbc.com/sport/amp/boxing/55308706
I need boy friend
Stop fighting old aged pensioners and fight real boxers for a change. Get the deal done with Tyson Fury!!!
Greetings from Bulgaria right back at you! I am rooting for you in your fight against Fury!
I am from Bulgaria, you not only won but also won the hearts of Bulgarian respect
You are a buffed up mediocre heavy weight . Wait till you fight real contenders ... you won’t last
Your a joke
Joshua has done his part now it’s down to fury to do his ,  he’ll probably do his normal ranting, calling Joshua a bum . I really don’t see fury doing  what’s needed to to make this fight happen, probably scared of of the reality of being beaten by  AJ
Fight fury
Top man excellent fight AJ!
Buzzing for yeah well done fantastic.
Great fight  you really dominate the fight all through out
Id Love The AJ v Fury fight...BUT.....you don't have to prove anything to anyone. You do deserve the Undisputed title and you'll get it. enjoy this victory, Christmas etc and decide afterwards. Not sure Usyk deserves the fight next tbh. Just like Fury never deserved the shot against Wilder before Dillian.
Absolute unit! Solid work AJ.
🥊🤪👍
Great performance AJ 💪 🇬🇧
I'm bulgarian but I can't describe how u impressed me... So humble, good guy , strong fighter, no trash talking and all that....wish u  nothing but the best! :)
this man is too wise and humble for being 31
Ooni Oluwafemi!!
Что не говори ,но румын первый
Congratulations great result. If only you wasn't part of huge protests during times of lockdown I may still respect you
Well done AJ amazing fight👏❤. I want to see you fight Tyson fury 👊
Well done AJ Tyson next I hope u knock that bum out thinks he’s all that !your the best boxer there is

Well done mate
Thank you 👍💪
100% Tyson Fury next!
That final right hand was an exclamation point.
Respect from bulgaria  one day you meet again with Pulev  Remember me 🐍🥊
Титры на русском пустить это проблема да вы не знаете что так можно сделать ? Это же элементарно и тебя будут понимать все ! Давай титры нам
AJ you’ve bought the love excitement I felt when watching the great Ali and all the greats of the 70s when I used to stay up and watch the fights with my dad. I’m in my 50s now ... King your an inspiration to young people and for people who can change their circumstances... I salute you
We all know who we want next year and he doesn’t like Sports Personally of the Year very much! But will the fight be in the UK and will this COVID nightmare have gone away so we can fill Wembley?
Beautiful Gate Church Lugala - Masanafu Uganda wishes you A merry Christmas and a prosperous new year.
you know who they wanna see you fight next a.k.a. Tyson Fury The Gypsy King
Fury fight will never happen why would AJ FIGHT FURY AND END HIS CAREER
Hey Joshua,BULGARIA IS MAD AT YOU LEAVING THAT FOOL ALIVE!!!
Now lets see a Fury Match. Well done , you looked a little  like Ali in the earlier rounds.
Stop ducking fury
Good win
Another very good performance. Good job champ   (   ;
Wilder
Let's go champ ✌
I’m just starting to like AJ, sad Fury is going to smash him
Big man👊👑
He was watching from his changing room got into the venue hour before his fight... 😂
Round 9: uppercut, uppercut, uppercut, 'upperload to YouTube!  Congrats, AJ! 👑🥊
As a bulgarian i am ashamed of Pulev. Congratulations to one of the greatest boxers - AJ!
AJ live and direct
THEY HAVE RE PLANTED THIER OWN NEW STRAIN OF FLU IN LONDON TO LEGITIMISE THEIR SCAMDEMIC,  ELITES ARE PANICKING
Well done AJ! Naija no dey carry last. Shout out from Nigeria. We love you and pray for you always, "Never underestimate the power of prayer". Greater days ahead.
Was a good fight, well done, .... Just hurry up and knock out Tyson Fury!!
AJ well done, great fight, nice to see you back, but not going to lie but looking forward for 2021 AJ vs Tyson Fury
Anthony Joshua VS Tyson Fury. Thats the fight we want to see next. If you claim to be the best you got to fight the best.
I’m from Bulgaria 🇧🇬 I was with you ❤️ lucky 🍀 💋
Fury next
Gypsy king...
Respect from Bulgaria ❤️ respect GOAT
I love u girl
Yo, it's the hyperman set, AJ Joshua live and direct
Well done. Keep walking, Best wishes from Italy and Bulgaria!
Respect to you AJ! You did great show (I`m sure you could have finish it in the beginning of round 4 easily), but even more - Great attitude of a real Champion. I`m sure that you just got some more fans, just cos of it. And I`m one of the new ones. And personally from me (and I believe the rest of Bulgarian people) BIG APOLOGY for his unsportsmanlike actions. We are all ashamed and embarrassed from what Pulev did especially after the fight.  May God help you and protect you!
Joshua is great great always
Brilliant boxer and very humble man. Just like Ali nice guy.
King  🦁 ❤️
What were you saying to Pulev and his team in the corner after the fight?
Is the colour matter when I say I like this guy?
Your the man ,I knew you would do it big guy, now time to shut fury up for good , he said you shit your self at the conference after the fight when asked about him,man is full of it,knock it out of him, love n blessings big man , have a great Christmas.
Poor dog I liked my own commet how sad.
CONGRATULATIONS 🎉 💪🏽🥊🥊✊🏽💯 .... Love from SE DC
I lied I forgot how to play chess
Congratulations with you win against a potato fighter. When are u gonna fight some of the top fighters? or are you really taking in those advices from your friend Money mayweather and ducking them big cannons ?
Ja Rule ft Lloyd Caught up
Well, it seems like we have gotten rid of Pulev, so I guess we would soon be heading to finish Tyson Fury like we finished Pulev, so let's go finish Tyson Fury now like we did to Pulev!
Well done for knocking a 40 year old man out !!! We wanted wilder and aj fight we didn’t get it!!! and now we want aj  fury and your still asking who do we want see next !!!
I’d like to see Wilder vs Andy Ruiz
We love you! Greetings from Bulgaria
AJ, don't concern yourself with Mr. Fury's taunts and bad mouth. Its only a tool for him if his opponents allow it to be. For me I would laugh inside at his insecurity and running off at the mouth. Keep focused and learn your craft, don't be a one beat fighter. Grow in knowledge and confidence and don't open the door to your mind for the running off of the mouth, you hold the key for that door.
AJ was taller and faster. I was hoping that our fellow bulgarian - K.Pulev could win, but it is what it is. 9 rounds, our lion took so many uppercuts, but he did not back down until he was fully out. He gave it his all, but at the end of the day AJ won. It was a great fight overall! AJ, respect from Bulgaria and good look in your future fights!
Respect
Outstanding fight AJ, selective aggression and smart fighter. Damn you got speed too, you're quick. Lightning combos. Blessed, well-done AJ. On to the next one
I’d like to see an Usyk fight. Knock him down then bring on Fury 💪💪
Greetings from Bulgaria mate. Very kind words to Pulev but here we have a bigger problem, everybody on social media is attacking Pulev for his loss against you and it's crazy. You had the better strategy and the perfect "setup". Cheers and let's get The Gypsy King
fight fury you bum
AJ's characteristics is so close to muslims characteristics. This is also the reason why so many muslims love AJ so much. Only if he uses the intellect that Allah has given him. He will surely find the truth. Inshallah Allah guides him. Ameen.
Pulev should have shown more respect and dignity. I am a little bit ashamed of his behaviour. I am glad that AJ "SHOW HIM"
You humbled him AJ
Why are you asking? You know we all want to see you against the best in the world, and that right now (besides you being number 1) is Tyson Fury.
One of the greatest to ever do it.
Fury is the biggest obstacle for you. Waay tougher than Klitchko. Go for it. Will be very fun to watch.  You are a great champion. Very respectable, very humble and well spoken. I am very glad that its you on the top, giving the right example to young children, cuz i'm sick and tired of fake role models like Maywether and Mcgregor.
CONGRATS CHAMP ONCE AGAIN BLESSINGS ...Salaam👊
Allihamdulilahi Allihamdulilahi Allihamdulilahi Allihamdulilahi Allihamdulilahi Allihamdulilahi Allihamdulilahi.  Aj I really thanks  Almighty Allah for your successful boxing  career . Remember those you sterted with which they are  no were to be found ,also, remember those that sterted before you ,where are some them today , also remember  those coming behind you looking upto you may , if Almighty Allah permit them maybe one day, they too can your  successor on the ring .

Ещё один - два поединка и пора уходить!
I felt that punch on my face. How do I sue?
Fight Tyson Fury only after he fights Dillion whyte. Some of you cannot be fighting mandatory fights whilst he sit home and only choose championship fights.
why is everyone sucking up . it was PULEV  lol
COBRRRRRRAAAAAAA FOREVER you was good, but we are BULGARIAN and never giving up. WE WILL BACK FOR THE TITLE. BE SAFE!
We all love you brother! You’re a role model and an inspiration to all the people around the world! Much love❤️❤️
daaamn the jealousy on here's unreal an so is the disrespect. I'm hearing ajs not fought anyone.. Go check the record, there not bums there top 10 ranked heavyweights he's beating constantly. Seriously he was beating world champions at an age when fury n wilder etc were fighting rank 50 opponents. Yeah he messed up against ruiz but lots of previous greats have done that.. Look at tyson, Lewis, Ali etc they all had defeats but aj came back an fixed that. Then I'm hearing he's on roids.. The guys tested so much an never failed so explain that.. An don't say he pays the testers its not the 80s u don't get away with that now. Next he's a racist apparently. Nah the guys just proud of his background an said something that feels right atm. It's not ment as a racist comment altho I will concede these kind of comments need to go it's gota go both ways an if u switch it then it sounds bad so he should fix that comment as he's a role model to many but get a grip we know why he said it. An finally he's born n bred British with Nigerian heritage get behind him both nations he's out there winning things so b proud instead of throwing the stupid hate at him. As for furys better.. We will see, I'm hearing none of this ducking stuff neither aj or fury can b accused of that they both step up. Atm furys the man he's undefeated an he got rid of wilder but ajs growing an improving an when that fight happens it'll b an event!! Well done aj, ignore the hate u did us all an more importantly yourself proud. Keep improving an show the world your greatness 👏 🇬🇧 🇳🇬 🎉
Seek Jesus, stay humble, all you are is because of him, I like you, but your young and need His guidance and the guidance of a Spirit filled church!!!
Keep Humble AJ
I wanna see you on Tyson Fury,.. but I think hes too big and too fast for you.
We love you in America bro!!!
Dear AJ  I am unsubscribing from your youtube channel until the fight between you and Tyson Fury is official. Kind Regards  A Fight Fan
Wilder v Joshua would be a staple
You big Dosser 😟
Fury if your pants don’t fall through
Was is just me that thought Shannon Briggs was gonna come outta nowhere start screaming “ let’s go champ !!” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fight Tyson
You didnt have to hurt him AJ
Oh yeah AJ beware of  Fury's dirty tactics he actually fights dirty, watched how he held Cunninghamwith one hand leaned against him at the rope then release and fire. Beware of his tricks, his grappling and leaning to wear u down, don't give him the chance, work on your speed and multiple combinations. Box your way in, punch the guards if u have too, hit the hand, the wrist, the elbow the arm the shoulder. Move side to side and around, box and move box and move don't stay in front of him, frustrate him box and move box your way in body shots hit him left and right, jab and punch him left and right combinations, box your way hit at anything you can find. .If he charges duck side to side and time your hooks and upper cuts...when he over extends surprise him with quick hooks.If he boxes stay with your complete boxing game, if he comes after you to knock you out, time your counter punches and hit him hard. Oh AJ work on your accuracy as well minimise misses thats why we suggest to box your way in with quick punches before you open them up and able to throw big bombs. Do not over extend too soon, waste of energy. Silent the giant AJ silent the giant.
We want to see you square up against the Gypsy King 👊🏽🇬🇧👊🏽
Humble respect ✊🏼and yea u did great
AJ vs Bob Arum. Set it up, Eddie.
Bring on the Fury it is time to silence all !
I wanna see you fight Tyson Fury champ
Yes josh, 2 years in the making, still going strong, still the reining and defending world heavyweight champion and still the Anthony Joshua we know and love for the sport of boxing and the for the person we see out of the sport. You've showed us your ups and downs through the sport and you've also showed us the sweet science of this sport. A true warrior in the sport of boxing and I can't wait to see you to showcase this again in your fight against fury. The fighting pride of Sheffield, England and the best of the best in the blue ribbon division. Congratulations my friend.
I'M A HUGE AJ FAN BUT WHO WINS BETWEEN AJ & FURY ? NOT JUST BECAUSE I'M TEAM AJ BUT HE WOULD WIN. AJ'S STAMINA & PERFORMANCE OUTPUT IS WAY BETTER. FURY HAS NOTHING AJ CAN'T HANDLE💯💯 🙏🥊🙏🥊🙏🥊🙏🥊🙏🥊THE FIGHT WILL BE  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
AJ you need spawning partners that are faster than you and that can pick you apart  Your punches are being projected and not enough head movement and you need to incorporate yoga for flexibility  Your still too tight in the shoulders
THOSE 3 CONSECUTIVE UPPERCUTS WTF 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊💯❌🙏🙏🙏🙏
You will get smashed by fury
As much as I am trying to hate our opponent (I am Bulgarian), I just cannot. Such a great humble guy! Congratulations!
The #GOAT👊💥https://youtu.be/ipLFlQMa3NY
Hey Champ absolute master performance! Fk the haters saying you let him off in the 3rd & should have finished it! You are in there you know what's to be done. I'm glad you took ur time and left no doubt who's the man!! Total classy performance as always.✌🏾✊🏾👍🏾. Now let's get this Fury dosser. I believe you have the fire power and now skills to do him. Believe bro believe in yourself don't listen to anyone tell that he's too dangerous and wrong for!! Fk that shit. You are the biggest draw, the A side. If you lose so what but you ain't I watched boxing a long time and I see real improvement in you & you seem to have no fear of any man especially that Fury. Infact I think he's really worried about you coz he's been mouthing off. Chin up & on to the next one. Well done Brilliant job👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Poor performance you can't last long with fury... joshua focus on your stamina bcoz i see that is your weakness hahaha
Perfect fight excellent footwork, great headmovement and display of power.
Thanks ,AJ! Regards from Bulgaria ,mate! Love and peace! Cheers!
Well done champ never doubted you for a single second stay humble stay hungry and keep shining 🥊💙

Браво!
Congratulations AJ ❤ God bless

Well done AJ💐❣️🥊🥊🥊
King
You're like the real life Black Panther.
What a performance killer instinct but patient to 1 belt left now you got this
Congratulations from Bulgaria.You were better and you deserve the WIN !!!
Everyone’s on here saying he’s classy and humble etc the guy used to sell drugs that’s not classy, he says boycott white businesses and you still support him because you have no morals just like him. He messaged that guy on insta saying the black race is superior that’s not humble is it that’s racist. Man you lot are puppets and sheep I used to like him and we forgive his past sins like selling the drugs etc but the racist stuff is a no no especially when it was white people who nurtured his talent and believed in him and helped make him who he is yet he says boycott their businesses hit them where it hurts you lost a fan bro.
AJ  boxed smart,  an picked  his shots well , an landed  some wicked  uppercut s , gonna b a great fight AJ v fury 🔥
Arteta...I want to see Arteta next.
I used have so much respect for you as a person and a boxer,then find out you are a racist against white people 85% of your fans were white but not now you’re just a nasty person 🐍
Great fight and a lot of fun too
TYSON FURY LET'S GO AJ PLEASE MAKE IT HAPPEN
A J if you need money fight anyone but the Gypsy king , a smart man knows when to quit , if boxing is a job for you well done son it paid very well , and you have been blessed , better to retire a champ than chump, Eddie hearn is dodgy and it's all about the money for him , us blacks have lined many a white man's pocket and fed the white man's children , I'm not racist just being honest , sack Eddie or retire but if you think you could beat Tyson fury your punch-drunk, he would make you look like an idiot , and that's why I'm advising you to get smart ,
Tyson fury fight!

I saw your confidence and self belief.you are an amazing fighter, I like your humbleness which really impressed me and that is the reason people love you and appreciate you. Congratulations
AJ is honestly too nice for this sport, its insane!
Just from watching this fight, I can see that Fury will out box him the whole fight.
For the Bulgarians: той каза че не се опитва да накаже пулев и респектира българите и каза здрасти.
AJ VS FURY
So many haters just keep doing what your doing 👊🏻

Furys going to box your head off 🤣
Why didn't you have sit down interview with a channel. You told ifl you would answer the questions. What a let down, be a man of ya word, be a people's champion
Fury God dam it just get it done already 🙏
Ever body watching  this and reading comments at the same time  you will always hear good news
Do not give a belt up to fight fury fight usyk first. It don't make sense to relinquish a belt to go after undisputed cuz u won't be.. Tuff decision..
Its like trash talk goes wrong serves pulev right
Allahamdullilah you won
Mashallah your are a good guy
Wilder or Fury next. I want wilder i think its a bigger fight than fury
A lot of people in Bulgaria don't approve  the attitude of Kubrat. He never had respect to his opponents and real assessment of his skills , which is a shame , especially for  a title challenger.  Congrats to AJ - a well deserved win!
Tyson Fury needs to be next for AJ. Fury has literally every nobhead in the country as a fan. It's gonna real nice watching him fall. I wonder how he'll take a loss?
Respect from Bulgaria
AJ is learning just to be himself Infront of camera 📸 top man! Saying what he wants with out fear of dislike.Respect to the real AJ
With the victory!👍👍👍
I’ve heard a lot of Bulgarians joked with Pulev before the fight. They were sure you’ll win. Even though I’ve heard Pulev is not respected in its country because of the way he acts.
Thank you Anthony! 🇬🇧🇧🇬🇬🇧🇧🇬We Bulgarians love you, stay blessed 🥊🥊🏆
Let’s go champ 💪🏻
We all wanna see aj v fury we know aj will win
Over rated! Over hyped
AJ Man congratulations
Yeah because he was a hard fight for you wasn't he 🙄 no interest in boxing anymore unless joshua and fury get it on 🤷‍♂️
You are the best all the time and you are a good man as well كتير فرحت اني شفتك البارحة شخصي في الهلتون قبل المباراة وبعدين حضرتك شخصي ايضا
You big Dosser!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Keep it humble
Well done my man
The fight should have been stopped when Pulev ran and then again when you knocked him down. Fury fight will be massive and so will the rematch(es). I got Fury but Joshua was sneaking them uppercuts in like candy tonight .
NEXT STOP... AJ VS FURY🥊
good fight great finish always gets my heart pumping when you fight ...thanks for a great night and great ko
Dont let the naysayers and haters ever pull you down. Youre improving with every fight. Please shut tyson furys mouth as he talks a lot
Well done mate,you will be undisputed.A class devastating performance.
Think it's obvious we all want the Fury fight and I think you  should to, we don't want another Ruiz situation cause it could happen at any time. And we don't want regrets in our life so make the big fight happen and create History.
Very good tactical performance, showed a better blend of the boxer puncher style, while still having a great finnish, i felt AJ, could of had Pulev out of there sooner but i had a sneaky feeling that AJ, wanted more rounds to teach Pulev a little respect when he is telling the champ he is better boxer etc etc, also gave AJ, more rounds to work of the ring rust and put all the work in training into practise, still a work in progress be he will keep getting better he has the right attitude.
I wanna see wilder inside the ring with you
The man, the myth in the making, the future legend. AJ
Reading from script..  How about you tell us who you actually  want next
hear that fake suck up talk. one big commercial message. like always.  i love the bulgarian fans bla bla bla.
God Bless Anthony Joshua! Congratulations for the victory!
Sad for my guy Pulev, havent seen AJ before as I dont really watch boxing, but may start watching. Nice fight overall and Pulev lasted longer than I expected tbh.
Is it humble to keep telling everyone how humble you are?
Tyson Fury.
Anyone... Doesn't matter you'll win anyway. Nice win KNOCKOUT YAAAAAS!
Big up all the day ones.. n 🔥 too all them that doubt and keep doubting
HUMILITY..
We are Respect you from all somali
Брат виж ся аре бий се с Fury вече че нямам търпение даже и Траян иска
Aj vs fury
Knock them all out fury and wilder and ortiz
Knock out fury next
Gypsy King Where are u?
AJ congratulations l'm happy for you keep dominating you the best of all time good luck A J
Great fight, great performance, AJ! Wishing you all the best, warrior!  You showed Pulev a high class and great boxing!  I have seen your training sessions, and how much effort you put into boxing, so you got what you deserve and fight for - another win! Best wishes from Bulgaria!
Tyson Fury will STOP you!
The amazing AJ why he’s our great champ
give us fury's head
AJ you should thank Ruiz for helping you upgrade your boxing skills..Fury is a much better boxer so you better train extremely hard !!
Respect from Bulgaria
I am Bulgarian. Bulgaria has great history and culture, great battles on the battlefield (read about the Doyran), great athletes and I am proud of that. But I don't know Bulgarian athlete that talk as much as Pulev before the game even after. Look, I was ex table tennis player and I know something about the sports -> train, train, train and respect to the sport, respect to your oponent, no matter you win or lose (that is valid for evrything). The first thing I've learned was: do not talk much, especially "how good I am,  how better then the oponent, I am" etc... instead express yourself. I haven't heared anaything like that AJ, Klitschko or from another big names, maybe that is the different. Most of the time I enjoy to watch clean game, strategy, technique and to watch, read, how respectful people are between eachother. Example: AJ vs Klitschko. Kubrat Pulev had the same manners vs Klitschko and the results was the same. I would be in much better mood, if the Cobra showed some proper manners. AJ congratulation from Bulgaria.
bro F fury. FIGHT Wilder!!   WTF
Fantastic performance , you got the beating of Fury .
Love this guy!! So HUMBLE I hope he rules the world truly! AJ for President!!!
Impressive performance. Great demonstration of boxing skill, never in difficulty and avoided any clean shots from Pulev. Should be very pleased AJ. I guess Tyson Fury is on the agenda for 2021, should be a close contest but certainly winable (is that a word 🤔). Enjoy Christmas champ 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Respect for Joshua, a noble man and a true champion. I am from Bulgaria too, but I do not like Pulev's behavior ... shame
Well done big man, I always look forward to watching your fights but win or lose your always the champ in my eyes,keep up the good work and I’m looking forward to see who your next fight will be with. Once again we’ll done champ. 🥊🥇🏆🥊😃👊👏💪👍
Well done brother. Congrats 👏.
Love bro
Well done. Aj good fight new you could do it loved boxing for years long before you were born don't know about. Tyson. Furry  he talks a good game  let's hope it happens good job last night . Go. Anthony take care best wishes from Glasgow Scotland 👍❤🎄🤶🎅🙏
We wanna see you vs Fury next
You're scared of Deontay Wilder scared to even say his name! Call out a Cheating Champ Tyson Fury ain't shit but a cheater and he needs to honor his contract a 2nd fight he shouldn't have got he cheated the 1st fight but i guess that's how the British role. A bunch of Prejudice idiots like America doomed to death!
I think you look like a fighter in transition. Learning all the time. Becoming a better all round boxer and Imo you needed to do. Good win.
Great fight champ
Joshua I don not like you. You are acting infront of the camera. Is again a plan of your manager to be the champion of the people and to be so humble and playing as a filantrop.. Why don' t you fight with Mihai Nistor  again?.
Well done 🥇👍
Tyson will take your belt
"you tell me who you wanna see next?" - MAN! It's like the people around Joshua cover his ears whenever Fury is even mentioned. Like, 'Ear muffs, Joshua. Put on your ear Muffs'
You looked pretty good, now where's the fight with FURY?. It has to be next ..............surely?.
Fight Tyson Fury next please AJ
Soldier
fake champ. you will lose to Whyte, Fury and Wilder.
Hello Anthony,  First, big congratulations! You showed great game, technic, speed and power!  As a Bulgarian, I can say that a lot of Bulgarians loves you man, you got a big support and a lot of fans. Kubrat has them as well.  Both of you made that great show and boxing in the ring, but in the end of the day i think the most important think is just to be nice and respect each other, like you showed! You are great! May be Kubrat did all those thinks for the show, may be he's that kind of guy,  but as a Bulgarian i can say that he is very proud and a lot of the people  respect him. Both of you did well, but you did better :)  I Used to live in England for a while, so respect for all of you!!!
To much talk from fury look were it got pulev,  well done
YOY ARE THE BEST MEN..THIS IS BOXING. BRAVO.. CHEERS FROM ATHENS.. 🥊😉🇬🇷
You are the best of the best my friend. Keep  up the good work
👍
Ei ohliov ela da sa dunim 1v1 she ta razfasovam ei
I just can't get over the fact how hot he is
All roads right now lead to Fury of course.  However,  it has to be to a packed house and can’t see that happening until the summer at the earliest.  Preferably in the UK.  Therefore I suggest you deal with Usyk and Fury retire Wilder for there to be no questionable doubt, with ALL belts on the line, who will be crowned Undisputed, Lineal and Ring Magazine HW Champion of the World. Not forgetting SPOTY of course. 🤣 I choose this way simply because there will be no other fighter challenging a HW title for at least the next 2 years.  If either yourself of Fury win each of the proposed 2 fight deal, there will ultimately be a third.  And fights of this magnitude will need maximum support.The fans must be present.  Great KO yesterday and good luck with final outcome.
Антоню жешуа
☝️🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜💪👍
Congrats champion !!!
You go showman how's it like being a showman, fight a real fight, or step aside let true fighters out
Мудила!!
Про чо он пиздит то?? Как предпенса бахнул? Пусть лучше Руиса вспомнит, потерялся полностью, а во втором бою велосипед включил... Нормальные боксеры его грохнут легко!

Все равно Поветкин лучшый
You have won congratulations  but why do you always bend your head under people armpits.if you fight fury in that manner he will choke you like he did to wilder.just my view bro.
Pulev time was nap time 😂😂
Top man, well done to you both
Congratulations 👏 on your victory. A great inspiration for our youngster's.
Aj vs fury next 👍👍👍!!! Fight of the decade 👍

Gotta say you and fury gotta get it in now mate! No more bullshit!
iv never seen a boxer in my life beat around a bush the way you did wen u was asked if you wanted the tyson fight believe me people he does not want to fight fury hes not on his level
Thumbs up on this comment if AJ’s next opponent should be Tyson Fury!
Pugilistic poetry, AJ and so sweet to see a man that is true to himself, inspired.
You did the job well now lets see who is A NO 1 BETWEEN YOU AND FURY   aj this will be the biggest fight in british boxing history My advice move your head a bit more more lateral movement Just what i see but i aint in the ring I like you both may best man win
We want you to fuck up Tyson Fury
Brutal ko
Mash dem big mouth opponents. No need to be humble to them. Be humble only to those who are humble to you.
Tyson Fury will put you to bed within 3 rounds
Tyron Fury will tear you a second AH
Now go out there and b even more devastating against fury,I wouldn’t call him a king,he’s all shake rattle an roll, great Elvis impersonater ,but let’s c him get on the dance floor with A.J.
Hoped out the gate to a Bentley Got me feeling like Aj at Wembley  Go get that last strap champ 👊🏽
I supported Kubrat because he represents my country, but honestly he's being a jurk , if you're gonna have a big fucking mouth , be ready to back it up on the ring , and when you get knocked down at least pay respect to your stronger opponent , don't be an asshole ... I love the patriot Kubrat is but I never liked his behaviour , she got what he deserved , that being said ,  Greetings to AJ , mad skills , great sportmanship,  he talks like a world champion should , I'll also support him on his future fight with Fury , congrats champ and  Merry Christmas !
Fight Tyson Fury next.
Win or Lose AJ is the same, a true man,  a true Champion. If u can meet with failure and success and treat those two imposters the same, then u'd be a man my son - Rudyard Kiplin.
Well done AJ..Lets go Champ!!..You are surely an inspiration.
Greetings from Bulgaria ! We admire you AJ
Fantastic show, fantastic undercard and a fantastic finish. AJ #No1
Well done  Anthony  Joshua 👍👍👍👍
Congrats you won the fihgt you battered him less talk more action🏅🥇🥊🥊🥊🥊

BOOM 💥💯too chill young bruh..too chilled..🤦🏻‍♀️😜lol. #MadLove For Kubrat..He paced himself a lot better than i thought..he took a lot of Your hits..He Does Not Say The "P* " word..✊One Love..
Congrats AJ, good luck on Your next event !

Great Fight, well done my man. Love from NW9
Why won't he call fury out?
Hi AJ. We are happy you won.  Now the next fight is either Fury or Usyk. Whoever of the two, we still need a win. Check out the preparations of Micheal Spinks against Larry Holmes. That was a good one. I think that conditioning will prepare you for Tyson. Another person to look at is Lenox Lewis. Listen to his interviews and maybe take advices from him. Bury any hatchet between the two of you.

Respect from Bulgaria
Amazing fight. Very humble. God bless you bro
Wanna see you fighting vs Fury . That guy talking too much . Get it done Aj . We will support you.
Love AJ but Fury is the man
Well done you beat another Old guy and your last fight a Fat Man so congratulations.
Fury smashes you in 6
Cannot believe a devastating boxer like AJ can be so cool  n smiley faced n so down to earth.
Go fight fury and stop running away...coward
bro if i just won a fight i would be buzzing he looks so chill lol. humble king
Bulgaria apologize for the bad attitude of that country boxer Pulev.
uysk then fury makes the most sense keep the belts and then the fury fight can have a full stadium
Well done Anthony,but! Let’s go,let’s go. Tyson Fury next.
Fury is gonna jab your head off
alhamdulillah from indonesia👍👍
Congrats champ. You've improved alot and your stamina was excellent. 🥊🥊🥊
Congratulations AJ bro I wish I could train you in some areas I trained in Olympic Champ Howard Davis gym and have 20 years of martial arts experience and training. The area I would work you on is your jab to cut people up with it, your endurance and develop your power. I believe young Bro you are still not fighting up to your potential. You are the 1st boxer in a long time with tools that you aren’t using I know you’re the Champ  and you’ve done well but this may make you much better. If you are able to check the few comments I’ve made on your your vids you’ll see I’ve seen things you needed to change and said them 1st. I know I’ll probably never hear from you but if you read this and out of curiosity just want to hear add .com to the end of my name or respond to this with a way to contact you. I’m a big fan good success either way
Well done, - for the fight and the moral compass that you project through your engagement with the sport and decency to other people. This is also inspiring and very important.
AJ. I like what he said" his learning everyday" words of a champion ❤️💪🏼💪🏼🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬
Champ💯 That bum fury is getting done
Please fight Tyson Fury next to shut all the people who doubt your boxing skills up.
AJ, make sure you knockout furry next in round 4
Джошуа: Боксът е повече действия и по-малко приказки
Don’t ask us who’s next, you know who’s next
Pure class. Experience is shining through. Well done AJ 🥊
Well done you still are fighting with great caution, that first Andy Ruiz looks to have made you more weary and left some mental scars on you but fair play you got the job done but I think you could of taken pulev out in 4 rounds ! Merry Christmas and a prosperous 2021 🙏
Let's get that Fury match champ. Hell of a fighter and gentlemen. Stay safe.Much love from the US
Good job 👍 bro( And still)
what a guy
And ruiz 3.. box him like you did pulev
Pulev's ringwalk suit was heavy..His water was spiked as well. Not to mention,AJ's gloves were tampered with and one of Pulev's trainers was disloyal..He also broke his arm in sparring😂
God blessed you.
So good yet so humble, much respect man 🔥
AJ you the man. Clinical fight. Respect 🙌🏾
Ma shaa Allah brother keep going ❤️❤️❤️👌👌👌👌🤲🤲
Great fight I knew u would beat him had no doubts. But we all want to see you fight fury now. He’s a great fighter to but I believe u will come out in top of that one also absolute beast👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻
Nice aj bro when is the Tyson fight?
True Champion in and out the ring. Have to be honest. When Joshua fights Fury I kind of want both of them to win. Two incredible talents who both deserve to be undisputed
Everyone keeps saying Tyson is gonna beat AJ. I can tell certainity that AJ has his mind on fight night Tyson Fury is gonna get whoop. He keeps tell us but people don't wanna listen. He is competing with himself. It's mental battle and not a physical one. Am calling it an AJ Win by KO in the 6th round.
Not that great you were blowing if pulev had a punch you would of been out that's as good as it gets fury wilder will destroy him
Excellent finish, shut him right up 😂
Don't think Tyson Fury will be that keen on getting into to the ring anytime soon! He might say out load he wants it, but deep down knows Gypsy King will get dethroned. Really like both fighters who are both class, but that style of AJ is to good.
Supp champ
Good work AJ. F*CK what fury and these deluded overnight boxing experts say. Real champion.
This had to be before the fight! You look like you’ve just come back from a stroll in the park! 🤣
Aj, please get a sound tech guy.
Well done, son.
Get Wilder out of the way!  We want Fury when there’s less Covid around so it’s a packed audience!
Congratulations on the win❤️
Aj is the king been a fan from day one, he smashes fury to pieces
Tyson fury and well done 👍
What a true fighter and humble!
Not very impressive ,, fought a fighter who was well past his sell by date ,, the gypo king would destroy you
Love you and huge congratulations!
The Meat Was Cooked Bro : )
great fight... man you're the best heavyweight rn.. next fight has to be Fury
Joshua 👎!!! Klitschko is the best boxer
Big respect Joshua u boxed well 👍
Well done AJ my African brother 👊🏾
Well done aj but think about go to the body then upercut like how mike tyson did instead of 3 or 4 upercut in a row when had his hands up u should go to the ribs .but well done a win is a win
Top man. Dealt with irritant with dignity and quality.
Aj im from the usa i always wonted to box never had the chance seeing you brother how humble you are when guys talk crap is amazing my guy congrats true champion hash#👀
I see that change of mind after the first knockdown, could have finished him earlier but the look was nah let me box for a bit I haven’t even started yet 👍
Let's settle Tyson Fury NOW. AJ vs Pulve 🥊🥋
You and tyson fury is the fight, wilder didnt want it he pupped out with you and let's hope he drops his shit and tyson can fight. Top win by the way ✊✌
when AJ fights Fury, he needs to be a bit more tactical,  more defensive. He needs to evade Fury's punches more . He should also feint some punches so he could set up the right hand.
Schooled him could of ended it in the 3rd if you wanted
Fury definitely!…people make too much of Fury’s win in the second fight against Wilder. Their first fight told me everything because Wilder couldn’t beat a feeble, rusty Fury. For me the proof is in the resumes...Wilder isn’t that good, he hasn’t fought anybody except Fury. Fury is very good now that he knows how to use his size and weight, but he still lacks big guns...my money is on you champ, you NEVER shirk a challenge, you always fight the best and you’re getting better and better!…great performance last night
it could have ended up earlier with a hook to the liver before upercut, but I say this from my couch ;)
''you tell me who you wanna see next'' ... Well if he is serious he's not been listening much has it
They’re trying to avoid the match because you know what’s going to happen
Well done aj. I'm looking forward to see you fight tyson fury.
fight tyson fury you BUM
AJ here in Bulgaria you have many fans and we love you brother. Respect for the nice words you have a big heart! All the best ✊🏼
Well done champ 👍🏻🔥
Joshua vs fury & wilder vs Usyk for the IBF. Undisputed fight for the winners.
I was impressed, faced with a technician like Pulev, he showed maturity, he took his time (it is often said that an injured animal is the most dangerous), beautiful movement, light on his feet, beautiful performance
Tyson fury ! AJ let’s go!!!!
Thank you, Anthony, for greeting us, the Bulgarians! A worthy champion with humility, it's a streak of his that wins my respect!
🥰😍
Tyson fury next opponent that will be mad
Awesome fight love the footwork, value for money and well done for not finishing him round 3. Let’s hope the WBO see sense and let AJ unite all the belts and he becomes lineal champion in the UK.
What's up A.J congratulations!!! This is great!!! I think A.J should be smart about it and fight Uzik first then Fury. Fury showed that he is afraid of A.J by not being present at the fight! That's even after his brother fought 😊. What kept Tyson Fury away from this fight. It was held in London. He can't say it was due to covid19. So what was it? Was he in his closet begging God so A.j loses so Tyson won't have to fight him? Yup that's chicken for you. A.j shouldn't vaccate any of his belts. He worked way too hard for them. Step by step A.J. Fighting Uzik will only prepare him for snicky Fury. The Speed and Technics that he would use to best Uzik will only help him to beat Fury. King A.J is well on his path to be crown emperor Joshua!!!
AJ vs Fury, the only fight that matters...
Let’s go champ. Hard work pays 💯
I am from Bulgaria! And I want to tell you that you are very strong and intelligent man! Pulev didn't deserve to win because he didn't show you respect!
Class
I bet Pulev to win, because u looked suspicious in the Ruiz Jr fights, but you proved me wrong, well done champ, fully deserved 👊🏿👍🏿👏🏿
AJ Bawonie. Great fight it was last night. I wish you the very best. Piece of advice: to fight Fury, you must lock your ears to his trash talks.
samo kobrata we
Well fought Mr Joshua. Well paced and well executed. I think you’d agree that Pulev has an iron jaw, but after 4 uppercuts in round nine and a straight right .. devastating KO.   To be frank the next fight is upto you. I don’t think there is a heavyweight who you can’t KO. So whether it’s Fury, King Kong or Godzilla.. the world is your oyster.   All I would say Mr Joshua is work your jab more. It’s your greatest tool... also get a bit more lateral .. move left to right a bit more. I am a new fan. First time I’ve watched you fight live. Your a true gentleman and a true warrior. Next fight will be awesome! Have a great evening and a fantastic Christmas.  Stay safe and god bless you sir.
Well done AJ I like you to see Tyson Fury fight
Respect!
AJ YOU WENT FOR IT. Can't wait for you vs Fury. I just done a reaction for this on my channel . LOVE how AJ doesn't hold back and always gives the fans the action they wanna see. VERY entertaining fight.
Come on. Its gotta be fury. No more ducking.  Please give the public what they want 🙏
Great job AJ
I wish to see you knock the f*ck outta Fury! I really need some folks to stfu!
Well done AJ #God is the key 🙏🏽
Great knockout, congratulations. AJ vs Fury next please! Boxing needs that fight as soon as possible!
Tyson Fury next
Respect!!!

The training for AJ Tyson has began now finally. If AJ can fight in a close range with Tyson, he will win him. Just be yourself AJ.
Best regards from Bulgaria! You did a great match although our fighter was arrogant an not even near your level you did treat him with respect. Good luck in future fights !
Great fight. I was going crazy during it all. Put him on a stretcher.
Congratulations on your 9th round KO of Pulev.  Please fight Tyson Fury now AJ... He's calling you a coward dosser! Don't be scared to call out his name too. Please be brave, cause you got this;  *Please don't let us down!*
Respect from Bulgaria man!
Great one bro aj one love from Italy 👍👍
It's gotta be fury
We want to see fury next !!!!
FURY
My Moneys on fury
Good win AJ you getting stronger fight by fight . 🥊
Why would anyone dislike this video ??
the fans have already spoken we wanna see fury vs joshua
Great fight goat
Brilliant fight and masterclass but you and Eddie know who we want u to fight the best vs the best fury vs Joshua make it happen
I pray for you AJ happy your life
Let’s go 🥊
Stop fighting bums.  Never fought a top fighter in their prime yet .   Fury Wilder .  Come on prove yourself to be the champ not a chump .
Good luck A.J.! Great fight.
💪💪💪
FIGHT FURY
Perfect execution of a boxer who can adjust to different fighters. From the 1 L he went away, adjusted and has become a technician for styles. Ruiz he boxed 'hit and don't be hit'. Pulva he boxed 'study and dimantle'  Studied found the weakness dismantled (uppercuts). Different boxer now. Keep it up AJ🥊
People's Champ!! Great fight!! Congratulations from the Portuguese crowd!!
Respect AJ. That bout was awesome. 🤜🏾🤛🏾
Congrats Champ. Guy was made to submit to a determined fighter. I must win...i must win...i must win.
If Tyson fury fight flops. I want to see you fight ruiz one last time. #trilogy #1-1
LIFTOFF FOR AJ !!!!
U became a smart dangerous boxer AJ, keep it up champ!
Lets go king👊🏻✨
Good fight aj 👏 your very clean 👌 but you did look like you was drifting off at some points... but nevertheless all around good performance 🥊🥊🥊  P.s... I would love to see you knock out fury, as he has such a lazy way of boxing, and from what I see from you to night, you should be able to deal with him no problem 😊
AJ this weight u looking sharp BRING on tyson fury
COME ON!!!! Knocked him out innittttt
Thank you AJ to destroy this shame of my country. He is not Bulgarian. He talks much and does nothing. Bulgarians are men like Dan Kolov, not like Pulio. Thak you again. Respect from Bulgaria.
You can’t hate this guy he’s just so humble even when he wins he still remains humble
Excellent work, methodical, clinical, unrushed and a great finish almost comical the knockout when he got back up and then was flattened straight away again . Highlights reel ko for sure 🥋🥋🥋
Boring fight, lennox would have beaten you in his prime .... still could 😏
box fury he is a racist person and too big for his boots
You look good!
Great fight AJ! Respect from Bulgaria!
How you people dont see through his fake humbleness is beyond me
To było piękno tego sportu
All class AJ
What a g
To give greetings to Bulgaria is so classy and shows AJ's humility.
Who we wanna see next? Haha come on dude
Merry Christmas and a safe and prosperous new year to you and your family Champ. Take a deserved break then Dominate 2021. Lessgo!
Congratulations AJ. Really good performance, but we all want to see AJ vs Gypsy King!!!!
You are the best!
We want to see tyson fury
Well done AJ. I respect you a lot for many reasons but mostly because of the positive messages you share. There are always detractors and until we can all unite consciously they are a necessity. Personally I rate that match as your best to date. Still room for improvement but you know this. Peace and love brother 👍
Hi Anthony, I'm from Bulgaria and I absolutely love how you smashed Kubrat Pulev. Charlie Zelenoff has more dignity than him.
Great job as always. Just keep doing your best and you'll always get there, because, in the end, it's about as you say, proving yourself. You can never let yourself down if you do your best always. I would love to see you fight Fuy and Wilder as well.
I'm from Bulgaria,  good fight as usual Joshua was amazing and very respectful... and the better man. Send you all the respect mate , would love to see a clash between you and Fury. Stay healthy,  stay positive
Congratulations.Good job Aj.  Who will be next Fury or Usyk which one?
Congratulations champ!
Saw some really nice footwork and distance control in that fight. Always great too watch!
Jusha Is Big❤️💪
Well done AJ lined up to be undisputed champ next! I normally can't fault you and admire the way u carry yourself but when asked about the Fury fight I was very disappointed with your weak answer and also running out of the ring to Mayweather who I'm a fan of also but you are the HW champ of the world u don't need to be running out like that to anyone let alone Mayweather. Otherwise nuff respect!
Fury - Winner
Racist
THE CHAMP IS BACK💪🏾💯
2020: Usyk / Fury
Much respect from Bulgaria! True champion and great example to everyone!! Much love!
I only came here to unsubscribe. AJ is a sell out who will voice his racist opinions for money and media attention.
Obviously Tyson 🤦🏼‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️great knockout champ!!
Thanks for shutting Pulev up, fury is in big trouble
Stop ducking fury🤭
Good performance but is it enough to beat the main man Gypsie king 👑👑👑
Respect from Bulgaria!
great performens champ! i wane see tyson futy next!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good fight
We wanna see fury v aj fight make it happen
Excellent boxing performance. 1 face, 1 name, 1 champion. He don’t go by the name of Deontay Wilder
It’s the hyper man set.
You could end our boy Kubrat in the 3rd round. There was no way he could win, you are faster, stronger and smater. Congrats Champ! Watch out with Fury tho. This guy is huge and hard to KO. His punches are insanely strong. I'd say play safe and win with points but you know best.  Good luck!
fight fury
Great performance. Would like to see you next against fury. Even though you won't win the fight, you two are going to do a hell of a fight. Love to you and fury ❤️🥊
Nothing but respect champ. Too many people want to hate on a man who wants to grow and improve because they're happy wallowing in their own self-pity and blaming others. One love champ.
Congratulations champ great win on to the next ....
You are the true champion . I 'm bulgarian  and ,of course I would be happy and proud if you were on your back on the flour , but this is not an obstacle  to look at you with much of a respect .  As you said ...it is what it is ,that's the fight game .. Congratulations for the great victory !
This channels like a little pocket money thing 😂
Well done AJ... Love from India ❤️... Want to see you take on Tyson Fury next💪
Tyson fury next please
You are the man AJ! Please fight Tyson fury next. I think Tyson fury would be the slight favorite
Fury will back down and fight wilder, joshua will fight Usyk, one of those champs will lose mark my words. Make the big fight now, get paid and give us paying public what we crave. Best vs the best is not a crazy demand is it.
You co promoted the event and half arsed the media
You were superb tonight, champ, you’ve grown 👌🏼
Absolute master class!!   Aj m8 your on another level!! Anyone who's says anyone other than Anthony Joshua is the king of the division is a delusional fan boy... B4 any of u jumped up fury fans start running up your mouth lets see if he signs to fight b4 we waste our time arguing over who beats who! Talk is cheap! Aj takes on all smoke.. Fury less talk more action sign the contract!
Amazing job 👏👊😎
Great champ and good fight to see! Looks like you really learned from the last fight. Can't wait for Fury.
Pure class
Is this before or After the bout?? Cos you looking clean 😂😂
One love AJ. Respect to you. Stay humble. Train hard.
What a guy AJ back to his old self
Well done AJ. Greetings from Bulgaria!
Amazing fight, you looked great. Absolute uppercut machine. 🙌
Stay nasty people will love you for it
Well done great fight 💯🥊
Congratulations my brother
Brilliant warrior. Brilliant man
Nice fight AJ. Love from Bulgaria!❤️
AJ bro firstly great fight last night 1 year out and I thought it was one of the best performances of you I have seen, you boxed intellectually and spitefully and you were the last man standing!! So it has to be the unification fight with Tyson one winner in the UK bro and let the best man win I love you both I mean that your both exceptionally I want to be there Wembley arena 100,000+ fans once the Covid vaccination is rolled out give us that fight please Fam we have supported you both through your careers this is the only fight the biggest and most lucrative fight in the history of heavyweight boxing!! Peace and respect I hope it happens 2021..!! Fuck Usyk he can wait you will put him to sleep as well..!!
0:31 It looks like you dislocated your right pinky and middle finger Anthony.  Probably on some unfortunate fighter's chin...
Fury vs joshua  Like joshua  Comment fury  👇👇👇👇👇👇👇
Fight Tyson fury that’s the big one
Congrats bro, more blessings coming your way. Let go bro way to the undisputed
Great performance my man humble as always. Yes please fury next!! 🥳
Congratulations and respect. Looking forward for the next fight 👍 💪
Like Pulev said after the match, remember my name. And we sure will, what a chin on that man, what a legend in the game. Keep fighting AJ, love and all support to you!
Also we all want u to knock ✊ Tyson fury out don’t we 🤛🏼💪🏼👍
Huge respect from Bulgaria!An awesome game from you both and keep going forward!
So next one is Tyson Fury and grand finale after easily beating tyson its gonna be Deontay Wilder.. LETS GO A.J.
Well done bruv me and my whole fam support u we all watched u knock him out he got it. Why was he laughing in the second round he’s a Luna tic lol 😂 love bro ❤️🤛🏼💪🏼
Good fight, well played, man! Respect from Bulgaria!
I don’t understand why Aj is asking the fans who they wanna see him fight next that doesn’t sit down well with me.Aj should be vocal about fighting Tyson Fury and not asking fans about who they want him to fight next something is not right there
Now end this debate over who is the greatest. Get your people and Fury’s people to stop the dancing around and get the fight signed. It will be one of the greatest spectacles of boxing the planet has seen and will unify all titles. Go and get your destiny AJ - NOW IS THE TIME!
Stay humble 🥊
Well done aj!! I placed £80 on aj winning by ko in the 9th and gkt myself £220
Looked Sharp bro......
You did wonderful AJ wa se rere excel and conquer Bro 🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬

AJ THE GOAT
You said 'Learning everyday'...  Did stating 'Abstain from buying from their (white) businesses' earlier in the year.......What did you learn from making  that divisive racist remark....?
I wanna see the AJ that beat Ruiz, no distractions just straight in and get the job done! You just need to stop being so friendly with everyone. Good luck to you :)
Wilder or Tyson fury
Great work AJ 👍. Merry Christmas to You and your family from 🇫🇮
Stay humble stay hungry!!!

AJ Respec bro from Bulagaria
Tyson
Greetings from Bulgaria champ!! It was a nice fight, Kubrat is getting a lot of hate right now but still you both fought well!!! Keep it up and never give up!
Kubrat Pulev was a dirty fighter, the only thing he did was rabbit punching.  I never want to see him box again.
Tyson furry has to be next
Congrats bro
You know who we want AJ make it happen
Hello Mr Joshua I would really appreciate if you would fight Deontay Wilder or Tyson Fury.
Love and respect AJ. From Afghanistan
What about Usyk? I don’t think it’s a perfect time for Fury fight yet.
Great fight 👊👊👊
Only one fight we the fans would love to see big man  And thats you vsl fury . Really hard fight to call either way so makes for an exciting fight. Make it happen AJ 🇬🇧🇬🇧
Fury
Dont even ask bruv.. you know who we want to see you fight! Good fight though champ
Yes AJ bad man knockout
It was a great fight. Congrats on Joshua he earned it. I think that there are few things that should be mentioned though. 1. Pulev didn't have a coach on his side to give him tips on what to do. That's why the camera never showed his corner.(the coach is sick with Corona aparantly) 2. Pulev has gone through Corona virus and had 2-3 weeks of no training because of that. 3. 3 years delay = Pulev being 39 years old instead of 36. Quite a difference in my opinion.  Again Joshua won absolutely fair and square. He was the better fighter in the ring. I'm just saying the other stuff for the haters that would hate Pulev for losing without taking into account some important stuff.
Well done, Fury next
I would pay anything to see u vs Tyson fury
Congrats! Role model
You have all my RESPECT, Anthony Joshua!!! Greetings from Bulgaria!
Tyson fury next
believe mate believe
Congrats A.J, I’m a Fury fan but love watching you too. Have a good Christmas and look forward to seeing you next year.
AJ will beat Tyson Fury.  Just make sure Fury's gloves are checked first 💯
Tyson fury is the only fight to be honest
This guy has changed the face of Boxing and its ugliness. He has replaced it with sweetness as a sport with passion..Fury you're next on the canvas👊👊👊💥
You’ll get knocked out of fury you big dosser
Top man AJ!!....smart and humble..England loves you man!!!!..
AJ train harder and smarter coz Tyson Fury is no child's play. Good luck
I got help from cyberadriel on ¡nstagram, he's professional and trusted

Okolies opponent was bambi uncle😂😂😂
An inspiration for so many!! On so many levels we appreciate you! #onelove
It was a great uppercut night
Sky Sports need to do like an epilogue of the build up of the fight like showtime did
Next fight Has to be Tyson Fury PLEASE!!!👍🏾🤜🏾🤛🏾
Tyson Fury we want next
That 1-2 in the 9th after a zillion uppercuts was glorious lol
Tyson fury bring it on 👊
Поздравляю Чемпион!🙌💥💥💥

AJ you the best 👍
I wanna see you fight KSI next
Thank you for the respect to your opponent and Bulgaria.Продължаваме напред!🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬
Weldone Man. Genuis👊
Sadly, I dont see Anthony beating Fury
Fury next. There’s no need for a trilogy with deontay wilder. Make the fury fight happen. The Gypsy King thinks he’s a king so stop duckin and diving this fight. Same with wilder
Joshua vs Mike Tyson(1990's) what do you think?
Boxing isn’t the same without the fans and all this mask wearing sheep and fake crowd noises is t right so bring back the real fans and teal noise and stop all this mask wearing sheep
Champ💪🏾🥊❤️
Brilliant performance I made alot of money putting it on round 9
The landlord!!

I love u man  ❤❤
Well done A.J, look forward to you and Tyson meeting. All British title fight please 💯👍👑
Tyson fury next
Massive congrats, pressure was really on, Pulev really came to fight and was as tough as they come. Brilliant performance, scary power and walked through some flush right hands. Fury moves better but does he really have a better chin than Pulev?
Even i am bulgarian and wanted pulev to win.i admire aj mindset and boxing from the beggining of his carrear.i wish him all the best and next....fury ofcourse
Thank you champ for your update..I never got to see you fight live which was a first miss for me.. On to Tyson fury.. whoohoo.. Tyson..      (undisputed) Wildette.   (woop ass time). Iron Mike   (legacy and Charity?)
Congratulations
YOU THE MAN CHAMP 💚🤍💚
Joshua looser, the very warriors is Tyson fury

What a great night we'll done AJ  it's got to happen now the biggest fight in history may the best man win.
Well done! Iam you fan from NZ. You make us proud🤗
Great performance, AJ! It’s a pleasure to watch your skills! Respect🇧🇬
Good job AJ, next time put the opponent to sleep ok
🙌🏾👊🏾
Great fight, stay great like U are now and we wish you all the best, hope U will be apsolute champion soon, you deserve it 💪💪 Serbia loves you ! 🇷🇸💪
Older and gets wiser.gets humble and hungry.. respect build never break it
Good to see Dillian's crumb make an appearance.
AJ,I really think you can knockout Tyson Fury..
I wanna see you fight fat man fury and knock him out
Come 1vs1 with  me but you must wait 4 years pls wait for me
AJ is a good fighter but he won against an old 40 year old man. He wont being able to do them upper cuts to fury like hes just done fury is a better fighter than that old man
Such a powerful fight AJ, glad to have you back!
You need to make this video every time you fight win or lose
Why’s he saying you tell me who to fight next he nos who we want 😩
Not even a mark on him.
Greetings from Bulgaria, AJ! Last night you showed how an athlete from this level should behave. Proper chap! Respectful, humble and letting his performance in the ring do the talk. Pulev is not a bad fighter, but his personality ruins everything.
Congratulations A.J you are very good in that boxing skills. I'm from Bulgaria and wish you good luck  for the future :)
That's why I respect AJ so much. Such a respectful and humble guy. Cheers from Bulgaria. The better man won last night, deservedly so. Sure, I was hoping it would go the other way around, but being a realist, I knew there would be almost zero chance for Pulev to go out of this match with a win. I'm still proud of him, of course, we don't have many athletes competing at the highest level, but Joshua is really something else.
Anthony Joshua please keep training hard because Tyson Fury wants to break you humiliate you and stomp you into the ground so what you gonna do about it!?   AJ : Him nailing!  Fans: let's do it👊🏽
You bullied him josh i watch it superb champ on to Tyson next please let's get this done
Joshua your a great humble man and respect you for that. You never chat rubbish and your personality is on point. Big for the win last night and hopefully we see you against Tyson fury next. We want to see the top fighters fighting each other like in the good old days. Congratulations 🇦🇱🇦🇱🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
AJ seemed pissed that he won,  as if  irritated perhaps, just another day at the office for him, no big deal...
Congratulations for the victory let's take out usyk next then deal with fury
It amazes me how he is such a gentleman and so humble but yet manages to knock people out. May God keep blessing you AJ
We went Tyson josh # please # knock out Tyson  # we went Tyson  let's go to war josh
He is so humble and nice,i love it how he always talks about other boxers with respect. Keep on doing so AJ 💞
I think he’s scared to fight fury
Great fight, would to see you fight Uysk, my money's on you but I'd like you to shutdown all these up and coming guys so you and Fury can settle this
WE WANNA SEE FURY VS AJ 😂💫👑👑🥊🥊🥊
AJ you're the best. Let's go ahead
Great fight. Congratulations to the Champion :)
Great performance on to the next aj all the way 👌
I really like you josh because when you're fighting you're real happy and you don't fight when you're hungry that is a nice thing I hope you will still do better I hope God will be with you💪💪💪
I am from Bulgaria but i love you AJ you are so good fighter!!!
Thank God we have Joshua in boxing
Türkiye’den selamlar  Geleceğin Muhammed Ali’si 🥊💪
Tyson Fury is a top boxer and AJ need to go extra mile for that fight because it is going to be one of the hardest fight ever. Congratulations on win, it was a double barrel shotgun that hit him to the floor👊
Dear Joshua , we really sorry for the attitude of our Bulgarian boxer , we are proud of you and your proffesionalism after so.much trash talking .Well done for your great performance .
My man your back! What beautiful right hands from yourself and Okolie last night 🥊 Hope everyone had a great weekend ✌
Absolute role model 💯
Junk Fight ! The whole ignorance after and before the match not wanting to speak to press on things, just ignorance. And then shooting off half way through the interview at the end of the fight, fist pumping everyone to get away to stop answering questions was lame,
First, I am Bulgarian.  I want to show my great respect to you AJ.  An amazing boxer and a great person! Role model! Be healthy and your family!❤  I wish you to beat Fury and become an absolute champion, because you deserve it!  In Bulgaria people love you, we will be happy for you to visit our country! 🇧🇬 ❤ AJ
tomorrow I'll show you :D -->  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_SM8uvXSTU
This fight went exactly how I expected. You are great AJ

Good job brother
AJ!!!! People’s champ, my man! Great performance, but even better person with the fans
Mr Joshua, please continue to learn and hone your skills. I enjoyed the fact that your footwork and head movement were far better than before. Very impressive! as you were very illusive. Don't matter who is next, take them all!!!!
Fans💖 from malaysia
🥊🥊🥊
AJ vs FURY is the ONLY fight. Stay safe everyone and great win AJ. Love to anyone reading this ❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿❤️
Love our bro!  he is showing us,different styles! he will fuk Fury up at his own game,he has power,skills attitude to win,now he has learnt how to be patient,how many times has Fury defended his titles?
Fury will kill this clown
Aj if u have balls, fight the real deal fury or wilder, don't keep moving around like a shitty fighter, n fighting baby fighter, n calling himself undisputed, coward Aj just know how to 🏃💨
Tyson fury
Naughty uppercuts.... I didn't think he gave you to much to think about during the fight not sure if that's because you made him look that way or he wasn't quite good enough.  Either way a good performance
Just me or you slim down bro ?
Great personality!! All the way man!
..your fight is ugly.
Let's go videos 😎 you super
Most legendary on boxing history than Muhammed Ali.. Very humble and Respectful than Muhammed Ali
1:40 I can finally now be living a relaxed life because of, *G R E A T E A S Y P  A  Y . C O M*
I wanna see this man win against fury,even if I think that fury is still better but i cheer for joshua
Great fight champ
Tyson Fury next!
There is only one fight people want to see bring on fury
Great fight AJ ✊👏
Brilliant fight! Just brilliant!! Congratulations champ! We love you and thank you ! Have marry Christmas you too!
My inspiration fight in this country no one like this guy 👣
You are the true champion and sportsman.
2 threats to AJ, Wilder with his fast one punch. But If AJ can do as Fury/ Ortiz and Molina. Box him, going forward. Aj got enough skills to beat him, and enough power and a clean cross to put Wilder on his back.  But the Biggest threat will be Fury. But I believe the man to beat Fury is AJ. Either that, Or Fury will give him hell.  Fury can dance, and now he can also go forward. He has the stamina, skills, height and reach advantage, and with age he is beginning to pack a punch too. He is akward and punches from every angle. What a task. But I believe that AJ got the heart, to prepare and figure out before the fight, how to beat Fury.  Let's go champ!!
respect from Bulgaria brother, well fought🤝
Well done AJ.
Stay humble bro your an amazing fighter 👊🏾❤️
GREAT JOB CHAMP. CONGRATS FROM LOS ANGELES.... CANT WAIT FOR YOUR NEXT FIGHT. WHO EVER YOUR NEXT VICTIM WILL BE....
Massif fight to come with fury, I just think Anthony's defence will have to be better to beat him, big question as he got the power to hurt him, wilder didn't.
🤛🤛💪💪💪
Shit pedal
Now that aj won
Well done from Blackpool Anthony, merry Christmas and a happy new year mate.
Perhaps Bob arum can shut his old deluded dementia riddled mouth
Great sportsman
Great fight
Well done, well done A J we are all happy, Pulev was out now thank God, I pray that Almighty  Allah grant you VICTORY over Usky Furry and any other opponents so that your dreams of becoming World number 1 come true  Amin.
I am Bulgarian. You are my favorite because you are a gentleman and you have respect for your opponent. Kubrat is gone. He is impudent.
I don’t know why he keeps saying “you tell me who you wanna see me fight” he knows exactly what fight we want.
I just wanna see Anthony vs fury  Or Anthony vs wilder
Velikan
i love you bro
Great fight and a perfect display of Joshua's technical ability against a real warrior.
That Logan kid needs some ass whooping
And still.....
What a show last night
Even if Pulev try to intimidate and provoke you , you stay calm and ignore him. After the victory , you showed respect and stayed humble , what a class act and amazing character
I wanna see AJ Vs Whyte again
Congragulations ...Champ... Let go to beat Drunk Fury ...
A.J.super.cenpion Boxnig  kral 2020.J.A.cenp. Qarabag Azerbaycandir !
Congratulations AJ no.1 heavyweight in the world!
Gotta be fury next AJ To be the best you gotta beat the best 2021 its gonna be a good year
Respect to AJ
What a fuckin legend 👊
Like the way Joshua assessed the fight and waited for the opportunity to expose Pulev. Pulev showed heart,passion and definitely came to take those belts,so loads of respect to him.  Now all we wanna see is AJ uppercut the hell out of the blood licking mouthy Gypsy King
Respect...
Humble in victory, unfazed in defeat.    You are a great man #AJBoxing
Any man with a brain knows Fury out class’s this man 10 times out of 10, I’ve seen enough to understand how the outcome will be
Антошка модчара,просто умничка!!!!!!!
Respekt Camp..
Asalaamu alaykum brother  Big big congratulations on the win   May you be blessed by many more victories   In sha Allah and always start with bismillah and you will always  Overcome any obstacles
Stay hungry/stay humble  Great night of boxing you did us proud once again Anthony   Did the business and was entertained through out the night  What a win from okolie he looked dangerous its exciting for British boxing  And you did that champ🇬🇧🇳🇬 bless up can’t wait to see you take fury on and unite the division

Big ups to Anthony Joshua the champion
AJ}{ All Day.
Öncelikle tebrikler A.J. seni dövüşürken görmeyi özlemişiz ancak V.Kliçko ile çalışmaya başladıktan sonra stilin çok değişmiş. Umarım en yakın zamanda kendi dövüş stiline dönüş yaparsın. Seviyoruz seni A.J👏👏👏👏👏
I want to see you vs Wilder — Tyson fury is a cheating Loser
Peace
Congrats AJ, awesome human being, humble and professional, you are the Khabib of boxing :)
Not only humility... Joshua is just polished. Simple yet complex
Why is he so cool?
We Love You AJ❤️
Aj everyone can see ur improvements bro!
Congrats AJ! I knew you'd do it
Please just stop all this arse licking bollocks its sad.
He did exactly what i knew he was gonna took a bit to long but works at his on pace so bravo AJ as you gents say across the pond knocked him spark out cuz😂😂😂
Искам като влезете тук да обърнете внимание как се държи един шампион. Човека поздравява публика, отправя послания за Коледа и пожелава здраве- той може да служи за пример на малки и големи. За съжаление поведението на нашия беше срамно, каквато и да му беше идеята - просто не му отива, не е професионално, спортсменско и уважително.
That's a world champ...😚😚😚☺😘😘😘😘
there was zero doubt in my mind CHAMP now on to FURY........ #andstill AJ ALL DAY brap braaaaaaaaaaaap
Ever since you arrived on the boxing platform I have always supported you. I knew one day you would be the pride of this great country & you are proving it day by day. You always give everyone that infectious smile of yours out of the ring, but in the ring you deliver the goods. God bless you Anthony & long may you reign.
AJ, Love and respect from Namibia. I knew you would knock Pulev when he talked trash. He behave with no respect. STAY HUMBLE AND HUNGRY #AnthonyJoshua #AJBXNG
This dude is a beast and he’s humble af and got class

FIGHT FURY NEXT!
Have a good Christmas 🎄 from Ethiopia 🇪🇹 AJ
Kudos
1 Ali 2 lennox 3 Foreman.
Tyson fury next please. I love you man.
Shout out, AJ. I'm a 🇧🇬 and naturally I'm Team Pulev supporter. You won fair and square, congrats and it's about time to see you and Tyson Fury exchanging some big right hands. Make it happen! Also, in the beginning, the BLM gesture was really good. I think you're the first of the boxers to do it.
AJ's humility will surely bring all his wishes to past. It's a life secret. Tyson Fury, we're coming for you.
It has to be fury next.
congrats AJ
God bless you AJ dominant as ever brother! All the best to you and your family over Christmas! Make sure you eat well over Christmas! You deserve it man!
Humble in defect and still humble in victory.
Tyson is garbage.Aj 100% good fight champ...!!!!
Greetings from Bulgaria,  Anthony!  You deserved the victory! Good luck :)
Congratulations AJ
AJ and Tyson Fury 2050 let's go senior citizens 😌😌😌
I am a Vietnamese who loves you AJ ❤️
There is only one TTTyyyyssssooonnnn Furyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!
AJ right from the beginning I was not a boxing fan but your humility, your style, your victory and the grace of God upon your life makes me to love boxing, more strength more victory more success I love AJ God bless you.
I just enjoy your humility...keep eating them up champ!!!
I can't wait to see you fight Tyson Fury and humble his ass.
My champ has done it again, congrats CHAMP.
Merry Christmas from Bulgaria. The best man won.
GREAT FIGHT !! 👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻 CONGRATULATIONS FROM GERMANY AND ALL THE BEST TO YOU !! MUCH LOVE ❤️ KEEP GRINDIN' !! 💪🏻
Good job AJ, you look fitter - don't want to se you get gassed against Fury when it comes, he's gonna be tougher than Pulev and fitter. Your gonna have to be lean and mean.
Congrats on the win AJ. The next fight has to be Tyson Fury.🥊
For Tyson Fury fight u have a lot of time. I hope next u chose Luis Ortiz, becouse for him 2021 is probaly last year of boxing.
Once again we saw different moves from AJ, shows he’s learning all the time, I was loving that lethal rapid fire uppercut, but not only that I noticed other things too, fainting, dodging & more. Well done AJ👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼hats off to you sir, great win!
We all want Fury next!
Brilliant performance AJ, you are a true Champion. Never doubt yourself you belong up with the elites. You will go down in history as the greatest British Heavyweight along with Lennox and Tyson regardless of what happens from here on in. Have a lovely Christmas with your family, you deserve it Champ.
All the way AJ!!!
OLD MAN SLAYER 🐐🐐 Keep this man away from ur grandparents they ain’t safe
Great KO Champ. It’s got to be Fury next. This opportunity cannot be missed.
💯💯
AJ is downright scary! Brutal upper-cuts behind the jab. "Less talk, more action."
Comonnn AJ all the haters can go to bed that guy talked so much bs to u
AJ YOU ARE THE MAN! Bring on Tyson fury!
Congrat AJ (Champ) Pulev you did  your best,  even your Dad can see that. Merry Christmas Guys.
He makes me humble, and just I love him he’s a great!!
Hello brother
Hey champ congratulations stay well god bless can’t wait to watch you fight again
Congrats big man. That was a good night's entertainment from you and young Hughie. Pulev's hard as nails, respect to him. Brits don't really like being centre of attention but all eyes are on us now son.🥊
AJ, a warrior inside the ring and a gentleman outside! 🥊🥊 well done mate!
Just say his name! AJ knows he will get handled by Fury!
Aj tracey live and direct 😎
congrats AJ :D
Мешкобой
You are the boss and I hope you will win all games 😁😉
Let us humble ourselves and wait see who is the real hero
Force a vous 💪💪💪💪💪💪🙏🙏🙏
بارك الله يا اخي
We call it Draughts in England, not chequers, but ok
Fury
AJ congrads on the win, but get rid of that bending down after the clinch habit.Coz people like Fury will capitalise at mistakes, ref might let fight continue and he'll have a crack at you while you are bending down. AJ box and throw more punches to  position the opponent for the big kill. Sometimes you over extended and wasted energy moving in too soon. throw quick efficient combinations to open up your opponent then go for the kill. The last punch you caught Pulev with is exemplary of a clean shot in. We can see you are improving the boxing skills, step up your game u need every trick in the book to beat Fury. Fake your moves, fake you charge for a reaction, play possum if have too. Set traps. Good luck champ.
Let Tyson Fury do his THIRD with his opponent and next fight JOSHUA
Congrats Champ!!! Job well done. Do us a favor and start targeting the body with digging hooks. You have the power to wear down your opponents by mixing it up with this tactic. Just my two cents. Next target has to be Fury for you to seal your legacy, Champ. Stay Blessed!
Congratulations champ
Gues who s back.......who s next
Andy beat ur ass all bad
AJ a great fight and now it’s time to face Tyson fury and have that all British fight everyone wants to see.
I Wana see big baby
Killin It 💪🏾🥊💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🇯🇲
Lets go Champ
A huge congratulations on your win.You're a legend
Man like Aj.
You r the humble version of Wladimir Kilitscko 🙏
Hey man, guys I just upload a vid and I would love if anyone could give me an advise or tell me how to improve
Congrats Champ. I am impressed with your head movement and foot work. He only touched you once. Recover back your upper cut power! Unless the guy had a steel chin to servve 5 upper cuts. Weldone
You are always the best AJ. Moreover you are blessed with words...that makes you different..CHAMPION!!!!
This is what the real champions look like! Greetings from Bulgarian!
We love you too josh❤️
Well done on your W Champ highly respected one Love that's how Champs are made I don't care who's next line them AJ all the way.
Imagine jake wanting to fight Anthony Joshua smh...wouldn't be surprised lmao
AJ a Beast! Don't let them get u Down bruh... Andy Rabbit punched u my g.. u still undefeated my g
Alhamdulillah
Too much bro.
Love you Champ we know that
Time to beat up that untested and unproven Tyson Fury. He can't hide anymore. Can't wait to see Mr Arum's salty face. Anthony Joshua the best. The Face of boxing worldwide. Congrats champ.
A.J. Congratilations from ukrainian fan champ 👆👆👆 . Where is he "I will show you" now...
That's my boy. The Omoluwabi of Yorubaland. Yobuba culture emphasizes respect for everyone an AJ is taking and showing it to the whole world.
Word of advice Lion King the jab is your life line, congrats Champ... But you hesitated on taking him out why? You can't do that against fury and also chin down at all times and hold the phone always. You have an opportunity to silence those doubters but you have to do your part. That part being consistent and confident knowing that although you will have to walk through fire you don't have a problem getting burned... It comes with the territory!!!  Watch round 3 again you were outside of yourself just enjoying the moment and that is all we all have is the moment. You can do it only if you truly believe you can!!!#AJBXNG#JahAllOvah
You STARCHED an HUMBLED pulev tonight now do same with fury hate people who talk to much shi#t man an never consistent with it fury will come in chin down as he does an be greeted with those vicious uppercuts aha 💯🤣👌
I'm bulgarian and I thank you for shitting on this clown who was rude to you during all those interviews and the press-conferrence. I'm not a boxing fan nor do I comment in videos this often but I follow the graham Norton show and I saw you there and you have some class and ethics which Pulev does not and he is literally a clown  I thank you once again for shitting on him and still show him respect after the fight.   Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Champ🥊💪🏾
Congratulations Josh! You the  real champion!
LONG LIVE MY SWEET BROTHER ANTHONY JOSHUA
Well done Aj very pleased for you mate. Respect from Yorkshire
Everyone knows who they wanna see you fight next regardless of who they think will win
I knew your win joshua because joshua is powerful name of holy bible.God Bless congrats fron Sri Lanka 🇱🇰
He don’t want none of Fury. This fake temporary champ is holding Fury’s future belts...
AJ ....IS THE FUTURE....NOT ONLY FOR BOXING BUT BEYOND OF ALL YOUR  EXPECTATION , THIS DUDE WILL CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE YOUNG KIDS ,GIRLS N BOYS ,OF THE NEW GENERATION WORLDWIDE  ...REMEMBER DAT....2021 WILL BE EVEN BIGGER FOR EM..
He won but that was far from impressive, big AJ fan but Fury was a beast against Wilder, not sure if AJ can get the W against Tyson, but who cares, i hope we can finally have an undisputed fight.
If aj vs fury is to happen  It has to be when all fans are allowed back You can’t have a fight like that with only 1000 fans watching in the venue Hopefully that’ll be next year but we never know
Six pack!
Goat 🐐🐐🔥🔥
BELIEVE IN YOU.
AJ vs TF  That is all.
Wilder vs AJ is still the fight to make
Oooooohhhhh ANTHONY JOSHUA!!!!!!! good win champ esp the 3 and 4 uppercut combos 💪🏻👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻
Fuck America, even with a thousand fans, still kicked madison garden
Good Fight Aj BIG knockout Pulev is Strong Fighter 9Runds.

You are the truest gentle man of boxing.
Thank you A.J
Congratulations bro well done bro. God bless you and your family. APADTA.
Good job.  Made Pulev look outlandish.  TYSON FURY #1 though... Go kick Wilders ass please...
Who else is here for Jake Paul vs Anthony Joshua in 2021 LETS GO AJ!!
Big ups from the US. Nice skills.
AJ needs to develop a killer instinct. Nobody fears him as they do Wilder or Tyson fury
Fury will eat this boy for breakfast
Congrats, man! I'm Bulgarian and I really like the way you act in professional and in personal. Well deserved win. Kubrat Pulev is older and you're the man who should teach him how to stand on and outside the ring. UK should be proud with you!
He looked beatable tonight, both Tyson and usyk will beat him imo too slick
No B.S  act Mr J
Class Act! What boxing needs! ✌🏿👊🏿✊🏿👋🏿🇿🇦
GREAT PEOPLE are actually HUMBLE🙏  A.J, more MILESTONES🥇💪
A true legend ❤️
I want you to fight the Chinese boxer HW in macau so I can see you live..

Congrats AJ keep being humble and Allah will take you places. It was a good fight that was displayed.
Wow the man looks like he’s still in his dressing room getting ready for a fight, not coming from one, amazing.
Remember, success doesn't come to those who don't work hard. You can't always be lazy and expect to be rich. You need to embrace every slightest opportunity you have to make money. Some of you here have more than $1,000 but yet you're scared to invest. No one is actually luring you to invest, I'm only trying to let you see good reasons why you should be investing daily. If you have just $1,000 and you don't invest, within 3days it finishes and you have nothing. When you joined this platform, your inner self was happy with you because you're close to being successful, but here you are wasting your time and resources... Every second you waste is enough to make you either rich or poor, you have to choose wisely..  ✅INVEST TODAY.. ✅ENJOY TOMORROW..  START NOW💰💰👉 Aldocentral.com
Yo It’s the hyperman set, Anthony Joshua live and direct
Chúc mừng anthony joshuas
Best Performance yet AJ you showed massive improvement that casuals will not understand, your defensive skills and timing is improving greatly! Congrats champ.
Cari Champion: Was it racist to knock out Pulev? That's the question of the week.

Tyson Fury is a bum knock him out and no one can say anything you will be Undisputed Heavyweight I know you can do it you prove that with pulev. 🥊
Let's go to win AJ love you bro

When aj rocked him in the 3rd round and pulev started laughing I was like wait what am I watching this guy almost got ko and laughed he do be tough
What’s up with Andy Ruiz JR give him his respect and rematch, he is the first guy to knock you out.

Don't worry about the haters, your TRUE supporters are right behind you.
Definitely tyson fury
Nice work man I knew you had it in you now one more piece to the puzzle tyson fury knock him out and your undisputed. Retire comfortably knowing that you where number one Undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the world and you will be remembered as one of the best Heavyweight boxers that ever took up the sport. 🥊
I'd love to see your next opponent being Wilder, would be sweet to see you KO him in the 5th or less.
Good job bro
Good job bro
Nuff love unto u Joshua! Glad u stayed focused and put that ruffneck into wonderland.Keep doing that and u will stay on top.Don't ever let anyone get the best of u again.U r a fine example of an officer and a gentleman.

Eddies stood behind the camera holding signs up with what to say
You know the world wants to see you and fury fight so make it happen
I wanted there to be like a 20 minute video for the training and stuff. The same thing hes done with all his past fights
The Fury fight wont happen.. dont hold your breath. We should all know how this works by now.
This guy is so humble I feel like I know him directly

Жошуа кот
great fight AJ
Hi
Joshua v Fury should only happen with packed Wembley stadium
How can you not like this man, congrats champ, looking forward to your next fight
The Highest Honor comes from a man who walks the walk & does less of the talk. You've learned from your mistakes and the fire in your Belly remains like that of a Gladiator and yet again you remained humble before stepping inside the RING OF WAR and finish the job the way it was intended.You are a TRUE BLESSING , A TRUE INSPIRATION & no-one does AJ better than you. I pay honor to your courage & your spirit but now it's time to seal your legacy as well as sealing your destiny.May the love of GOD guide you & define you, Amen!
The champ is back#1
Class. From BG
AJ will be undisputed champ. by 2021. One thing is sure, they can’t run forever. Let go champ...🤜
Tyson will smash you, dosser.
I want to see 2 fights with Fury first one for no belts and second it’s all on the line. I want to see the 3rd round AJ take Fury head off!
AJ is the best
That is the real deal AJ congratulations 👏 bossman
I think the next is going to be Usyk because Fury is running away from this. If he wasn't why he did not accept the invitation to be at the ringside. Worst of all is that immediately after the fight he calls him out while cowering in his house.
Tyson Fury bears Joshua.. Joshua has made lots of adjustments but it won’t be enough for Fury.. Fury is huge and the reach will be a difference in the fight.. I think Fury will finish Joshua within 5 rounds
AJ mate fantastic fight bruv. I predicted your weight and predicted it would be rounds 7-9. Well done from South London irish. Peace👊
Aj v fury
Bro you vs fury is gonna be crazy! I still think you would win tho! :) AJ gang!
Congrats for the win AJ, wish you all the best from Bulgaria. Can't wait for your fight with Fury !
AJ stay around 17 stone ...for your stamina ...AJ you throw massive combinations and that can gas you out ....so stay around 17 stone
Best heavyweight on the planet 🥊 AJ
Fight Fury or Wilder
Sheesh🤩🤩🤩
You did well, Champ. Your performance was phenomenal!   Go for Fury next, you can do it!
This dude is the best!!!
Brother you are the best ,
Im here from the states watched live good fight looks like ur in between styles of boxin n being inside n bangn...but ur findn ur own becomin a real deal high level elite pro..so big ups aj hope to see fury mext if nt n somethin happens id like to see usyk boxin is bullshit so sometimes u dnt get what u want
Congratulations
This guy is so nice omg
Great fight, aj is an elite boxer!
Good guy fair play but I think Fury will beat you. Should be a good one.
true champ. a gentleman and a very humble joshua and habib great fighters true gentelman
Seriously how can people hate this guy?
My favorite heavyweight
That last right hand was perfect.
Femi, your performance today was clinically outstanding. Bad news for potential opponents is you're getting better by every fight. Proud of you bro 💯
Coward.
Good job bro. !
Nice knockout champ🥊👍
You fought a 40 year old big deal
Eddie Hearn and AJ the money machines, gearing up for the biggest cash grab ever. If you think this fight between the two reputable best heavyweights on the planet will  be in the UK 🇬🇧 then your delusional, this will more likely be sold to the Arabs and your PPV cost will be enormous. British fight fans will be sold down the river again. A fit Tyson fury will show AJ for what he is and humiliate him, Wilder will get fed the leftovers.
Thằng này chỉ to xác,được 3đấm bổ ngang bổ dọc
I hope you beat Fury just like you did Pulev . Well done AJ
Tyson Fury.
great n Classy
#cleanheartswin. Fury next.
I feel like AJ and Viddal would be such great buddies, they both have class, humility and respect. Edit; Didn't know there were buds in RL, that's awesome. Also, I'm not trynna equate them as fighters, it's just two people I happen to watch a lot so *relax*
Respect from Bulgaria
Big love brother ♥️♥️♥️🇳🇬🇳🇬
I am big fan for you
Great money machine scheme. Great job on the win as well. 👍
Deontay vs Joshua. Will give an extra practice fight for Joshua before versing Fury and it will give Deontay a chance to prove he's still a worthwhile champion.
Spoken like true champion! Great execution during the fight. Greetings from Bulgaria. Peace.
you are such an inspiration. Your video about your flat struck me. Seeing how you act when someone such as pulev tells you things and what is the outcome is very inspiring. I will try to learn from you to be better .
On to the next. Good KO.
You are  joke AJ.  I bet you are still scared of Andy Ruiz who beat you up.  You now fight like Mayweather who just runs around the ring.  Everyone will remember how Andy Ruiz  beat you up AJ and KO you.  I bet you are scared of every fat Mexican guys walking down the street.
You know who we want you to fight next!
I don’t don’t know what is wrong with Nigerians all over the continents why aj subscribers still under one million when we are more than 200 million on the planet pls let’s support him to 1 million subscribers
well done AJ. you improve every fight. Best boxing resume in the HW division
You are great fighter respect from🇧🇬
Tyson fury they deyonte wilder
Everyone is building the AJ vs Fury fight. For Fury it's a much easier fight than Wilder.
We really want to see your unfinished business with Wilder. Fury after, (if you win). Don't the the U.K. fans trick you out of a legacy defining matchup! Let's go champ!
Tyson furry must be the next on your KO😴 least.
Congratulations!!! Hard work pays off! Well done!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👑🥊
fury is gonna smash joshua
Box in the US third fight with Andy
Really enjoyed the Fight. Much respect from the U.S. You handled ya business AJ.
Wilder
All praises. Congratulations from the states 🇺🇸 bro! ✊🏾 🕎  12 Tribes Worldwide #Unity
The thing that you are thinking very straight and stay humble is so rare in people who do boxing. You look like a good man. Respect from BULGARIA :)
You toyed with him....gave nothing away...You know you could of taken him out anytime....solid performance
Cheating Fury is next AJ !
Is anyone going to say anyone else's name except Fury?   It's the one everyone has been waiting for. I think we're all happy for you to knock people off your list, but after the Fury fight, not before.   So that's 100% Fury for me (and probably everyone else too)
Congrats brother
Now that wilder is out of the way. Lets see you vs Fury.  We like u, classy in defeat and in victory.
Yes thank very nice job 🇧🇬
The best Heavyweight Combination Puncher Since Holyfield , He has showed that he can do it all Box and also be a lethal finisher !
Usuk top
Absolute inspiration to everyone.. such a humble guy.. congratulations on your win and you are a sporting superstar that people can look up to.. Go on AJ.. Well done fella..
I just can't love your humility less. Pls, stay true to yourself. Almighty GOD will continue to be with you.  AJ to the world
Now time for fury vs Joshua
SHOUT out Bella pizza
Je suis fiere de toi champion Anthony JOSHUA du courage toujours plus fort que James adorable
AJ will nock him out at round 8
I swear if the next fight is not AJ v Fury I’m gonna start losing hype for that fight.
You did it!!
THE ONLY FIGHT OUT THERE IS A TRILOGY WITH RUIZ!! BOTH GOT A WIN BUT RUIZ'S TKO OF JOSHUA MUST BE AVENGED IN TRILOGY or will be stain on Joshua's  career!! Afraid??,
Didint even seem like he's just been in a fight!
Champ I would like to see AJ Wilder. Fury is a cheat and scared. Trust me AJ Wilder is the BIGGEST fight in boxing.  Lets go champ..
Good win champ 🏆 💪
This man apart from being a champ, knows how to win people's hearts. Congrats from Bulgaria, this was a fight I didn't want to happen so I don't have to choose sides but AJ as always with the win.🤛 Much respect for AJ as a fighter and as a person.
I like how you never mentioned furys name lol  Fury is pissing himself
Take on fury or wilder
BIG RESPECT AJ YOU DONE GREAT,I COULD SEE THE NEW THINGS YOUD BEEN WORKING ON AND BEING OUT THE RING FOR A YEAR TRYING TO PUT NEW THINGS TOGETHER AINT EASY,BUT YOU GOT THAT RING RUST OF AND SPARKED OUT THAT MOUTHY FUCKER COZ I BET HE AINT LAUGHING NOW LOL NOW ITS TIME FOR UNDISPUTED OR TO SPARK OUT PULEV FIRST IF FUFY STILL AINT FEELING IT...CHAMPION FOREVER G
Tyson
I can’t explain how inspirational AJ is for me as a person and for my morals. The show was very well structured and was very entertaining. And to see you get the W for everyone today meant so much. Keep it up AJ.
The #GOAT👽#AJ😎👊https://youtu.be/ipLFlQMa3NY
Remember Love Island?  “I’m loyal”  Georgia?  Well that’s what AJ reminds me of from hearing “I’m humble , staying true to myself”  I just don’t buy that this is the real person anymore. Great win and I’ll always back AJ but he has become more of a robot personality saying everything on cue like it’s written for him
AJ is gonna beat Tyson fury fat ass
We wanna see you fight Fury and for once you do all the talking! If u dont, Fury will get under your skin and win before the fight!
Fury next
✌🏾🙏🏾🐜
Great job, your story is nearly complete after that there will be no one to beat.. True master of self knows no defeat.. 👊🏾
Евала. Много ме е срам от държането на Кубрат към вас.
God bless you
ngl im a huge huge huge fan of AJ and Tyson  its gonna be sad and exciting no matter who wins.
The people’s champ
Good man
Jab with Fury! Jab with the jabber; NORTON v Ali, BRUNO v Lewis, MERCER v Lewis. The fight will come to you if you JAB INTO FURY WHEN HE JABS!!! Well done on tonight, great finish

Well done Aj....broke him down perfectly with jabs to the body and then smoked his sorry ass.....punch perfect performance if you ask me....
I wana see you vs fury next along with the rest of the world

Fury let’s go for Undisputed !!!
You fought a bum!!!! Your such a phony!!!! My 13 year old son could knock that bum out. Start fighting the Ortiz/Joyce of the world. Instead you fought this old man bum!!!! Your a disgrace.
Congrats on the amazing performance ! Much love from California !!!
Weldone Champion
AJ is example on how to come back from a defeat and work hard train hard to achieve and regain championship glory

I love this man so much, obviously Fury will duck cos the best don't fight the best. What a shame cos would be an amazing fight
The NEW Undisputed, Undefeated WBC, IBO, IBF, WBA, WBO champion of the world Tyson "Gypsy King" Fury.
Bulgaria thanks you for your attitude and respect ! We also want to apologize for Kubrat’s attitude ....we wish we had a fighter with your mentality and spirit !

Tyson Furry next up champ
STAY HUMBLE
Congrats Champ 💪🏿🥊🔥
Anthony I’ve never been your biggest fan until recently. Got the chance to hear you speak and saw you’re definitely a leader for our community. I hope you all the best in your future fights, I’m no expert but I would to see you work with the Mayweather camp for your defensive movement. I constantly see an improvement in your performances but would love to see you use your athletic superiority in your defence. I know it’s not entertaining to be defensive, but it’s about longevity and your career outside of boxing. I think your achievements can be endless, knowledge is power.
AJ will lose against Fury EVERYONE knows that.
I want you to keep winning man that's it Merry CHRISTMAS from Alabama
Congratulations to you AJ I’m so happy you won the fight with a KO nice one you put those haters united to shame
Thanks for 9th round knockout AJ £850 return from £50 bet on 9th round to win and £70 return from £50 on win either by KO,TKO,DQ bet totalled £920 win thank you very much 🙌🏼✊🏼👊🏼👏🏼 bless!!!!
Stay humble, stay hungry. We keep switching off the lights on all the trash talkers. Cleaning their mouths thoroughly at the end of every fight they are so silent you can't understand what happened. Then you realise... AJ happened. Baptism by AJ. One fight at a time.
Alhamdulilah
Congratulations 🥳 Champ 👑  What a performance stiff long jab, very humble person. I can’t wait for the AJ fight! 👊🏻
Congrats AJ. This was the fight I’ve seen you fight live. Can’t wait to see you beat up Fury 👊🏾

Joshua/Fury 2021 lets fcking get it mosh!!!
Joshua is already getting hearn to sign a rematch clause in the fury fight,  like he did with the first ruiz fight. He has been running from fury for some time, but he has to finally meet the best heavyweight on the planet before long.
THE BEST HEAVY WEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD
I must admit, your journey to undisputed will be hard and you'll have to change your style a bit up to fit fury's, but regardless of the odds, I'll still be supporting you. 💪🙃
Congratulations Bruv when the naysayers doubted you, you came back stronger
He think he can come from nowhere and take the title never.We re waiting Tyson is next
We thank God for bringing you the win man 🙏🏾❤️
Fury destroys AJ
Congratulations on your win tonight.

Sorry AJ but ..fury is much more skilled and talented then you and I am afraid if you take the .arch next year it will be loss for you ..you should do it in 2022
Congratulations big man 💪
Top man. Great performance.   Great skills shown.  Can see the work and progression in the gym.  Respect to all fighters who climb in that ring.
Congrats big man
Congratulations King blessed Jah blessings continually to yuh 👊🏿👊🏿
Firstly well done AJ You've added more tricks to your strategy etc. What a fight mate!! Pulev deserves alot of credit aswell very strong hard man. Undisputed is on. Whats the situation with Usyk as WBO mandatory??? Maybe he step aside thinking he will get a shot at straight undisputed. Or will he be paid off to step aside or do it willingly? Well done man that was a class performance!!!
Congrats champ👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 hard work always pays off 🔥🔥 can't wait to see AJ vs fury
Just joined:) definitely enjoyed it great to see the champ back and being aggressive yet humble
Much love and respect to you and your family, you are a TRUE CHAMP . Pound 4 Pound,..💯💯💯💣💣💣
Like this to tell him we want to see AJ vs Fury next!
Champion always champion
Congrats on the victory AJ! Who do we want to see next? AJFURY2021!!! Who’s with me?!

Fight wilder
That was such a bullshit fight fake as fuck how much did Kubrat get paid to fall disgrace
Why celebreties and athletes are starting youtube channels nowadays? I can't be for the money so for what? The fans already follow them on social media they dont need youtube
Tyson fury vs AJ lfg!
Hey bro.. you did it. You did it again. You are the best
Fake...... Player.......hustler of the crudest kind
Simply the BEST! Better than all the REST!
Another bin man. another old man.
Fury will beat A.j very easily
AJ vs FURY... IT HAS TO BE.. BUT FURY IS THE WINNER IMHO. Hopefully you will take on the fight and if your good enough prove me wrong. But as a poor man compared to AJ I'd even bet Fury wins
Congrats on the win
ANTHONY JOSHUAS NEW STYLE SEEMS PERFECT. HE'S BOXING DEFENSIVELY AROUND THE RING, AND WHEN GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY ATTACKS VICIOUSLY. I PERSONALLY THINK A FIGHT AGAINST FURY IS A 55-45, SIDING WITH FURY, BUT A CLOSE EXCITING FIGHT NONETHELESS.
I love Joshua but fury beats him,no doubt gypsy 👑💪🏼👊🏼🇨🇮✌🏼❤
Congrats     Fury your next
AJ v Wilder 👊🏾
Proper champion this guy.
Great fight tonight, knew he was gonna knock him out at that very moment. Dont know why many dislike him. Great fighter, very humble. Pulev stood longer than I thought, iron chin, iron heart great fight 👍👍👍
yes aj blessed to see u come out safe
Absolute class act mate......love ya to bits, you inspired my love for boxing. Look forward to the next ❤️
LETS GO AJ!!!  Stay Hungry, Stay Humble.
Well Done AJ, should have been over in round 3.
Great victory AJ! But loved to know what he said to you at the end of the match in the ring, you walked away very p*ssed off
AJ Great Performance Tonight Congratulations on your dominant win tonight Blessings from New York 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊

Tyson is going to flat line you, ya big dosser.
Ride on AJ
Fight dillan whyte vs aj 2 🙂🙂🙂
🐐
Tyson fury
Well done AJ 👑
Personally I dont want to see AJ have to vacate any belts so he should take care of Usyk before worrying about Fury. Of course if Usyk can be convinced to step aside then I'm all for the AJ- Fury fight. I'd love you to teach him some manners
AJ baba... Alhaji 2time! Congratulations Bro! I still got the shirt you gave me in Saudi Arabia.   Please beat Fury For undisputed ,  then beat him again for his next biggest pay day and then drop the belt for Joyce. I don’t want to see you fight Joyce. You guys are too super cool and i understand you are friends too.
What a KO, Lets see undisputed next
man like aj
The le't go champ 🔥💪🔥💪🔥💪🦁🦁🦁🦁🦁🦁🦁🔥🦁🔥🦁🔥🦁🔥🦁🔥🦁🔥🦁🔥🦁AJ
Why can’t people be happy for AJ. “NOTHING WORSE THAN A SAD PATHETIC HATER”. The end.
showed skill agression power. it was another master class again
Legend
Outstanding performance AJ ...brilliant jab ...excellent uppercuts and over the top right hand finisher ... Pure class and looked suberb on television!  Respect AJ ...ROLL ON UNDISPUTED 👊👊👊👊
Fight KSI for the bants pls 🤣
I'd give u full marks on that pulev test. Well done mate. Dillian do u in the rematch tho.  Hehehehhehe
and fury will win
time is now for aj and  fury if it doesnt happen bs
I remember when you made a video in nyc after your loss. Congrats on the win champ!
Hello from Bulgaria Aj! Thanks for recognizing our great little country and for respecting Kubrat after all the trash he talked,thats what a true champ does! God bless you and good luck in all your future endeavors!
I want to see Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury
And let's all support black businesses. Despite the fact 85% of country isn't black. Therefore on average when people are paying to see you fight if it was only black people watching you wouldn't be making the money that you do. So bare that in mind ;) just imagine if Tyson Fury said 'support white businesses' would be WW3
WELL DONE AJ 👏 ✔ 👍
Remain Humble 💯 , Count Your Blessings 🙏 Love From Hawaii 808 Waianae 96792 Go Get Uhm Champ 🤙🤙🤙
You are great! Anthony Joshuaaaaaaaa, Round 9 Knockout Love you live from  Chicago.
AJ has punchers chance on Fury and nothing more ! Fury is taller , longer , slicker , faster than any other of AJ's opponents and on top of that his boxing skills are unmatched in the heavyweight division. That's a fact.
LET'S GOOO!!! 🥊💯
Shagamyte!!! Congratulations and God bless you my brother!!! 🙏🙏🙏
Congrats to AJ.
We want Fury
Fury Vs AJ London Wembley stadium
Respect the humbleness
Respect
AJ beating up another 40 year old 😂 that man is embarrassing to the sport of boxing its getting out of hand now
AJ V FURY GIVE IT TO US
Tell US about fighting NeXT you are not actor pr Singer man
AJ v Fury ayy
Respect ✊ champ   An well done to you and Kubrat Pulev 👏
☝️👊🤲🇮🇪🇵🇸
Congrats champ
As expected, KO! 🥊🥊
Got to be fury next
Nothing impress me like your humility, before and after every fight. Stay humble, stay hungry. Great guy.
Take inspiration from the greats float like butterfly sting like..stay blessed.
Am I the only one one who fell it not the right time to go for fury
Even if AJ win in first round , some people will complain about his performance, before the fight nobody wants to watch it and now surprisingly so many negative comments, I bet from people that didn’t watch it 😁, AJ did well in my opinion 💪💪 stop being bitter people and support all the fighters who risking their lives for our entertainment, Let’s go AJ !!!!!💪💪💪 🥊
Fury is going to eat AJ
Has to be Fury.
Congratulations the king  A.J , you was great this night , next target is Fury , love from Turkey 🥊
Well done fella keep up the great work cheers 👍👊
Well done, man! Pulev ate some of those shots but you kept going. Haters still hating but can't wait for you to (hopefully) face Fury. Loved that you didn't call him out by name, think you got under his skin a little there as he rose to that bait already. 😁
Tyson vs aj 2021 let’s go aj
Still think pulev has a good few years in him
I want to see you KO Usyk and one more opponent in devasting fashion before you fight Fury. I believe you were very gun-shy in this fight and need a few more fights to regain your confidence. This fight should have been over shortly after you knocked him down in round 3, but you allowed him back into the fight. Perhaps it was part of the gameplan, but I genuinely believe your killer instinct is one of your greatest strengths and it should be harnessed when you get into the ring with Fury. Therefore I'd like to see you dust off the cobwebs a bit more and fight a few more top 10 heavyweights before you fight Fury. I believe you will ultimately beat Fury as you are a complete fighter with incredible skill and heart. You throw great combination punches and know how to box. I think your power will be too much for Fury and you will stop him later in the fight as you did today. Best of luck with your preparation. #TwoTime
Pulev is a warrior man
He will fight fury in 2021but unfortunately it won't be for undisputed
One love from Wattyyy brother we always gonna be routing for you
RESPECT....NONE BETTER...Humanity at its BEST.
Congratulations champ 💪🏽🙏🏽
a class act
Don't be scared to say Fury's name
Hi AJ I’m from Bulgaria 🇧🇬
Love you man 💪
THERE IS ONLY 1 🔻⬇️🔻
Let’s see fury next opponent and god willing take the win big love from Australia 🇦🇺 ❤️
The true and real king of the HW division,  since 2016 when he won his first title IBF this guy has been collecting belts/titles and defending at the same time unlike Gypsy Queen who has yet to defend any shit coked up not to rematch Wladmir klitshko etc.... I don't understand the amount of hatred and hate towards AJ it's just unreal. AJ has basically done all the work but he's willing to give Gypsy Queen 50/50 for undisputed which I doubt if Gypsy Queen will put pen on paper
Love you, bro. Onto Fury it is.
Great fight. Seem to be holding back when you look like you wanted to just let go. Feel bad that you had to do this promotional video as also the many post interviews ... like you said less talk more action’ hope you learnt to please yourself rather than please your fans. Forward king.
Congrats on the win 👑💘 Big love from Serbia 🇷🇸❤️
Champ!
The goat!
You know who we want to see,  no one has to tell you
Champ! 👊🏽✊🏽🥊
Stay humble, stay hungry.
Congratulations brother may Allah grant you more victories
LEGEND ❤️
I think everyone wants to see Tyson Fury vs Anthony Joshua, 2 biggest super starts at HW Boxing right now imo. Or if that cant happen for some reason, Usyk vs Joshua
Fridge
Fury still beats AJ 🥊
Quality performance. Huge respect to Pulev, very experienced and resilient. 👑🥊🇬🇧 Congrats on the win AJ🥊💯
Congratulations champions 🖒
Want to fight Ruiz again? :)
Didn't call out fury 😴
Congratulations, emphatic win! And great to watch, keep it up champ!!
If you don't fight fury next and soon you are nothing to me!!! I will not watch another fight that boring .I know why youtube boxing has gotten so famous because the professionals only fight once a year and when they do it's boring as h*** I will watch KSI vs Bruce Jenner before I watch AJ fight another guy who can barely speak English and  that I've never heard of then make 4 videos about how grateful he is... we get it you are blessed and you love everyone ....OK now fight fury you pussay
So fucking proud of you AJ. Now finish the job of what your destiny set you!
Pure class is AJ
Another masterclass performance. Monster!
👑👑👑TYSON FURY 👑👑👑                       NO.1 ☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
Didnt expect a video out that quick bro😂 But fr congrats on the win, you can see the improvements you have made and that was a beautiful finish. Regardless of what anyone says, stay true to yourself champ cus thats all any one of us can do👊💚
why should we need to tell you when you said you want all the belts? stop pinning it on the fans, grow a pair and call out Fury for the undisputed
Humble man respectful man have to love him ❤ gentleman
WELL I HOPE ITS EITHER UYSK FURY NOTHING ELSE WILL DO LETS HOPE WILDER DON'T GET REMATCH I'M HEARING ON THA BOXING VOICE HE WILL SO THATS WHY FURY DIDN'T BOTHER COMING 2 FIGHT SO 2021 CUD BE AS LONG AS 2020 WAITING 4 1 NAME 1 FACE WHO AIN'T WILDER LOL

My Best Boxing 🥊 AJ 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻  Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 Follow You Brow 🔥🔥🔥
Aj ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💋💋💋💋💪
Usyk next!
What a performance from AJ! Destructive finish. Can't wait for the AJ vs Fury fight. Anyone who thinks Fury will beat AJ easy or KO him, have absolutely no clue. Fury couldn't KO Wilder who was on his last feet.  AJ will fight anyone, he's fought more top fighters than any of them out there. Fury and Wilder are the only ones ducking.   Fury will have his work cut out with this improved AJ turning up, and he's only going to get better. People will see when the fight happens. Until then it's just Fury fanboys going crazy and hyping him up.
Wilder next!
MashaAllâh well done! ❤️
I love you but Fury Is gonna knock you out!!
Fury!!!
Tyson Furry next!
Haters crying 😂😂😂 knock out
Joshua vs mike tyson
tyson fury
You are always humble and that is a quality you cannot buy... Did us proud bro... I love the fact that at the interview when they asked u whether you are the greatest u said u are not in competition with anyone but yourself... Amazing phrase. Wishing you more health, more blessings, more wins and great legacy like Mohamed Ali, Mike Tyson, Lennox   Lewis and more✌🏽💪🏾🙏🏽 Having said that... I want to see you knock out Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder after these two you can't happily retire😂😂✌🏽✌🏽
My man Aj Will destroy Fury a good clean.Sweet performance took no chances.Im sure Aj, will have his critics always. Good job well done 2 the number 1 heavyweight oh yeah
Respect AJ u beast! So proud of you g. Hope calculate your composure when ur finishing them of in future tho. But still ref shouldve waved him off in the third lol. Have a great 2021 bruda
Love You ma BRO!!!! ❤🔥👊🏾🌱🌳 GOD BLESS!!!
Not impressed fighting a 40 year old at the beginning of your 30s. Fury will defeat you and you know it. Hes a better boxer so you will have to fight him. And gypsies are excellent fighters so I think your going to lose. But I'm well aware that it only takes 1 punch. So I'll hold my head up high no matter what. I was brought up on boxing my whole life. And dont see you as a great boxer im sorry that I don't. I'm just not on the hype train. I think fury beats you within 11 rounds or decision. Either way he's a superior boxer. Casuals who listen to the media will think otherwise. True fans know what I'm talking about. No replies until after judgement day
Fight usyk first then go for fury 🔥🥊
Anthony you did great , 1 wish of mine would be to meet you maybe help me start business up open a garage ? You have a big heart that's why i ask? Reply please
Congratulations champ
Was mad
Champion 👑
Congratulations brother!! Splendid performance tonight!!🥊🥊🙏🏾🙏🏾 These other cats say they want that smoke but actions speak louder than words!!👈🏾🥊🥊
AJ is in daa house mudaa fuckaaaaaaa
Great win AJ, it has to be Fury next !!

Goodnight straight down the pipe 👊🏽💥 Congrats King AJ👑 , I love you so much man 👏🏽👏🏽❤️ Road to Undisputed continues! I want to see you in the big fight next 💪🏽
Good luck to you AJ God bless you champ.

tyson fury mate if you want to know what i think what will happen watch my lastest vid and i cant wait to start boxing again and put some things in my box off toys for boxing in the future bro all  love gg my man
Fight the guy who beat up fury next, Otto wallin 😏
Furry comment
TYSON FURRY GONNA GET KNOCKED OUT👊👊👊
Congrats!
The peoples champ , always humble and respectful
Mandatory challenger Usyk should be next, good experienced operator and a challenge to totally eliminate the ring rust in preparation for Fury. Alternatively just a teaspoon of this daily should do the trick... http://www.chemtech.net.au/cne_rustoff.html
God bless you Champ. I have you in my prayers.
"I respect you". "I show you tomorrow." "No try. I show you." Hmmm. People always talk shit before they fight this man then......yup.
This man will be one of the greatest ever
Awesome performance and knockout AJ! Well done champ now go get undisputed 🥊💥
tyson
Respect AJ  iv been to watch you fight  and wanted to be at this one Champ xx
@Anthony Joshua great win . Fury is calling you a coward for not mentioning his name when asked after the fight. Please fight him next and ko the clown and become #UNDISPUTED.
Master class boxing  from the champ took pulev out in style
My heart race every time you step in the ring but to see those combination shots land I was jumping off the sofa with delight and that 9th round KO was epic AJ such devastating knockout power it's superb to watch all the best champ
Awesome well done 🥳
GypsyQueen over on Instagram chatting like ah gal
Fury an you is the biggest fight of our life time 🙏🏼🔥
U are the champ man 💪🏿
You got this Champ!!
De chile,,,,con amor
Wow. Big respect to you for praising Pulev even after his classless trash talking AFTER the fight and AFTER he already got knocked out (we heard him telling you to "remember who I am!!" etc.).
Top man champ🥊
As fan I want to see Tyson fury next thats who i want.
Fury
Congrats champ. Have a good Christmas and New Year with your boy.

Love for the champ❤️
bruv aj is great and powerful ,but pulev had a iron chin great win tonight
Legend
Why do I feel like he’s planning to bring out a t shirt with “your only competing against yourself” or something like that 😂
Can we please get the biggest fight in British boxing history? 2fighters. The golden boy, Olympic champion and 3 belt Joshua against the lineal champion. Feck wilder. Feck lockdown. This would sell a million tickets in this country alone.
Two time  Congratulations from Australia 🇭🇲
Great Fight Champ
Congrats Champ!
Hope the Fury v Wilder 3 rumors aren’t true and you get the Fury undisputed fight next and smoke him!!
Cmon AJ beat Fury in 2021!!!🔥
Champion❤️1️⃣🏆
Paid for box office! Well worth it! Great win, in my opinion best all round performance well done
I LIKE ANTHONY VERY MUCH ,BUT TYSON WILL BEAT HIM. BUT THEY BOTH WON IN LIFE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART GUYS NEVER GIVE UP ITS ALL IN OUR MIND THE WORST ENEMY MAKE IT YOUR FRIEND.  HOW ?MEDITATE CONTROL LUST EXAMPLE NEVER WATCH PORN AND NEVER TALK TO MUCH TO YOURSELF WHEN YOU EAT DONT WATCH TV  OR TALK OR DAYDREAMING SO YOU LEARN TO  CONCENTRATE IT WATCH SADGURUH THIS GUY IS A G WHEN IT COMES TO CONTROL MIND.
Well done AJ! Prayed for you beforehand, pleased for your victory. 🇳🇬 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Love this guy! Tyson is a tough one rest up! Train and Train hard brother! We gonna get him too! Tough one though! #ajfury
AJ great fight. Big fan from Papua New Guinea 🇵🇬🇵🇬🇵🇬
Fantastic fight, whole night was excellent and ended in style. Much respect. Oh and fury next, pleeeeeeeeeeease.
Congrats champ hopefully fury will be next but I think he's gonna do a wilder and duck you
Favourite AJ fights (top three)  1. AJ VS klitschko   2. Aj VS Pulev  3. Aj VS Ruiz Jr
Tell fury to come get this AJ smoke. #AJUndisputed2021
Definitely true or definitely correct?...you knew AJ would pull off a win.
I love this man aj such a humble and respectful man a role model to young boxers I cant wait for 2021 🥊🥊🥊
Fight FURY.

Not going to lie, I was hoping for a full on call out towards Fury but as long as the management team make an agreement talk is talk and nothing more. Joshua Fury has to be next, surely!
Congratulations on the win I was screaming from my seat a true master class now we gotta see Joshua vs fury and have your name in one of the biggest fights since rumble in the jungle

Yes AJ you’re a beast. Mixed pure boxing IQ with power and brutality. For me the best to grace the ring in the Morden era. Can’t wait for 2021 where you will finally end the debate. And send that fool back to WWE. Paper champ. And the new undisputed champion of the world Anthony AJ Joshua
God bless you champ I love you so much 🙏🏽 I pray GOD continues to strengthen you with more wisdom and wins in Jesus name you are an inspiration to me👑🙏🏽
