Unc jay can I get 100,000  😂im down bad out here I repay by good works and helping people the same way im down bad I can’t cap
Great movie this makes you look at life differently
Movie title: the book of CLEARANCES Main character: CLARENCE  Sensitive, ignorant Christians: that’s not Jesus!  … well, obviously…
The Israelites were slaves of 400 years! Let that sink in America 💁🏾.
Amazing movie, bruh. Please watch if you haven’t already. A perspective we’ve been deprived of for oh, so long
Jesus is king!!! Jay z you will see one day, all you devil worshippers will feel the wrath of Jesus.
First, God covered Adam and Eve with the skins from the shed blood of an innocent animal, most likely lambs. Then, God's angel of death passed over the houses covered by the blood of innocent lambs. Lastly, the lamb of God, without sin, took on every sin that was and would be and shed His own blood so that everyone who would accept and follow Him would have everlasting life. His name is Jesus.
"I would die for you," shameful
Btw I know the prayer. To bless water. :D it's like bringing back coke in coke
Tweencore
Nice EDit btw. Now, can I meet him or you want Vandal to put you on my Epstein acts?
That's why I'm having 6 tooths left, been born white woman and God in calling me per "heyson". Em and Lu trolling hard, don't ask.
This is a mockery. 🐑
Mother f ker  13:13 Samuel L Jackson
Excellent movie about sacrificing selfishness for something greater. They captured a man becoming something greater than himself…. Perfectly
Black people need to reclaim Israel as their true birthright. Go to Israel and breed with their daughters.
12 seconds into this trailer and I scroll down seeing passages of the Bible.. and I’m like hell no, I’m not watching if they are mocking Jesus in some South Park manner and then I watched the whole trailer… I think most of you people commenting bible verses on here are deceiving yourselves
I wish i didnt see this
Yeah no, I’ll be disrespecting God by watching this.
It is a must see movie the best movie ever about Jesus it shows the truth and mass subliminal messages in the movie
The writer of this movie is a genius all movies show truth and it a subliminal messages in this movie. It’s overwhelming if you didn’t see it go watch it three times an excellent movie 10 stars. The best.

Judgment day is coming sooner than they think!
This was a good movie
So people care bout the race rather then the miracles and love shown by a Demi god well we are screwed this movie was actually very entertaining
I love love love  this movie  Jay Z did good on this one
Jay Z should make the book of diddy instead 😂
Delete this video before it's too late.
Blasphemous movie glad it flopped hard 💩🤮
this movie failed in economy. Im glad
Now mock muhammad you cowards.
Lol blacks getting Hollywood to write and promote a black jesus lmao what a JOKE
a mockery of jesus and the 12 apostles
I'm so sick of ethnocentrism🤮 they shove it down our throats any chance they get. Please stop mocking scripture. Why dont you make cheesy low par movies about the false gods like allah, buddah...you cowards!
People are so deaf, dumb and blind it’s actually terrifying. Watch the movie and you’ll see that Yahshua wasn’t mocked. He was celebrated, honored and praised. The story follows a man who wants to be seen in the same likeness as the Messiah but constantly falls short and finds himself in trouble due to his heart not being in the right place. It’s in epic based on mans pursuit of glory over god and how it will ultimately lead to one’s demise unless god becomes mans glory. Yes there is a comedic presence throughout but it’s extremely well balanced with the moral drama necessary to receive the message in a powerful sense. It’s not just some comedy spoof mocking the Messiah like that Jack Black nonsense. In fact, if by the end of the movie, if you don’t feel like you need to strengthen your relationship with the most high, then you simply didn’t watch it.
Jay Z, Diddys bf and right hand man made this movie.
Very good movie was thoroughly impressed well done
Christians always think they know what's best yet still celebrate pegan holidays. Yet the movie is blasphemous? 😂.  I watched it and it was pretty good. It definitely teaches a lesson. No one said that was what happened in the Bible, but there were people imposing as the messiah. Jesus wasn't mocked, nor God. He who without sin cast the first stone.
Great movie! I see most in the comments haven't watched it. It doesn't mock God or Jesus at all.  Clarence is a man who doesnt believe in God, but comes to know him through different trials and tribulations in his life.  Great film. Good message.
ephesians 6 5
I love it all this things coz its show how great our god  love is .
Yall have made me so proud in these comments! Keep it coming with the scriptures! GOD'S WORD WILL NEVER FAIL!
This looks great. I love different takes on Christian mythology
This is blasphemous indeed😂😂😂 I'm gonna watch it now
We wuz Jesus and shiiiiii.
JESUS IS KING
The Book Of Claren
The Book Of Clearance
So we’re just openly mocking religions in Hollywood now?
Great movie. Jesus would've loved it!

My friend said to see this but this shit is blasphemy right?
Aloha , the filmmakers knew that the mass minded people would scream “bloody blue murder “ about this ART😂.   On behalf of us that find this Cinematic opera,  brilliance in every TAKE 🎬🤪😘.  I got to watch it again.  To u we say ..THANK You, Meric ,Mahalo from Hawaii.      🦶🏾🎵✍🏾 Leah Tunkara
I like it at the end where the Star’s dialogue says’ I don’t believe in God ,   I know God. ❤ Leah Tunkara
Big bold black filmmakers of planet 🌎 Earth.    2024 🎵🔥😍I❤love u guys.  One has to make a distinction between what one believes from what one knows ☮️☪️🕉✈️💡.  Leah Tunkara
It’s honestly is a good movie. He had no faith in God but by the end of the movie he believed
It's so funny to come back & see all the comments that this trailer garnered when it was released. Humans are truly interesting.   This was one of the most amazing & thought-provoking films I've witnessed in my lifetime. If you had asked me last year what my all-time favorite film is, I would've said it's a tie between like five different movies. Ask me now and I will tell you that it is easily The Book Of Clarence.
Those who speak blasphemy on this FILM, should know that this BOOK is NOT for you, but for a people who can receive the spiritual message clearly and use to apply wisely.
As Muslim that is disgusting
L can't wait to see this movie
A Shawn "Jay z" Carter film . That means it's a lie
Walk on water 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 get me ehtime
It was a good movie and a beautiful depiction of jesus as a black man. After i watched the movie i was told it was made by Jay z and didnt feel any different. Stop being sheeple.
Did anyone in this comment section go see the movie, or they just going off the trailer. Go watch it remove your ego, and fully watch the movie without your prejudice.
I think more people are upset that this movie doesn't portray Jesus as a white guy...So now we have all the blasphemy comments.. STFU
This is Gospels coming from the more ancient and literal Ge'ez & Gnostic Christian Judaian text...
Wait what? I missed the blasphemy. This movie wasn’t about Jesus, it was about a man finding faith and ultimately the knowledge and belief in a high being. Where is the blasphemy in that 🧐 did I watch a different movie from the majority of people in the comments 🤷🏽‍♀️ maybe I did 🚶🏾‍♂️
I've seen this movie twice. Lakeith is a good actor. I first saw him in Haunted Mansion.
the book of tb joshua lol
I can’t believe that this movie is the most blasphemy movie that I’ve ever seen in my tower life. This movie is more wicked than Freddy Krueger, Chucky, and all the scary movies that man has made this movie is it’s just not right they’re always want to sit there and mock Jesus lol and these people do not even know what they do and they think that is funny especially that rapper Jay Z how sad is going to be whenever it dies Jay Z he’s going to see Jesus for who he is and what he stands for and he’s gonna stand for the judgment seat and Jay Z is not gonna like it because stop dropping and roll does not work in hell
The fim was annoying are kidding this not fear
Scary part is there is 10 millions views- Matthew 10:24 &32,33. May Jesus give us all discernment to seek divine truth. Psalm 139:23&23. Jesus is Lord.
What would a shade of Jesus look like?
There telling U in your face that yahshua is like me a black man wake up read your bible tells you what he looks like in the bible he's not a white man
Last part he realized he fucked up
Ye. That's looking good
I wonder how Christian’s will feel about this
DISGUSTING SHITS!
Blasphemy
Listen I could be wrong but I don’t think there were black people in the Middle East in that time period. And Jesus certainly wasn’t a black man. If you walk into a church any church ⛪️ you can clearly see that.
Satanic shit 🖕
Religion is for week minded people and for dumb too, because otherwise there wouldn't be gold on churches while homeless in the streets 💩
Jesus is king 👑 you are not god 👎🏻
Monkey Movie🤮
People please take my word the commercial was made that way to draw attention I watched the movie today   The man didn’t think god was real   And then he lied and had people believe he was god. But in the end he became a child of god after certain things happend to him. The movie has a powerful message about faith don’t judge a book by its cover you have to read it I promise it is not blasphemy like everyone is thinking the man who is saying and doing  blasphemy things will become a child of god and start spreading the word as a child of god in the end   The commercial is designed to gain attention but when you watch it you will se the beauty in the message it’s positive and powerful I suggest you watch it it DOES NOT goes against your religion I promise ✊🏾
I just watched it the movies is about a man who didn’t believe then he lied and called himself god for his personal gain and while doins so things happend and god showed him that he is real.  And turned a non believer into a child of God I thing everyone who is against the movie should watch it.  Never judge a book by its cover you have to read it man. Humans are small minded as hell I just watched it and it’s awesome with a strong message but to every super duper Christian in the comment sections it does not goes against your religion at all
Positive Movie with the clear message of REPENTANCE So many people talk about it without actually watching the film  I really ❤love it and help me to come back to the church 🛐 since all of us are sinners and REPENTANCE is the real message of this movie 🎬
As a Christian I love the message. Basically it says that ANYONE can be saved once they believe that Jesus is savior.   Those who actually watched it would know what its about.
I loved the film, it has comedy, yes, but it has dramatic parts and series, with a beautiful story about friendship, human value, etc. Furthermore, I consider this film more accurate than dozens of others about "Jesus". Most films show a blond and white Jesus (which is historical manipulation). In this film, Jesus was black, which, according to many historians and archaeologists who analyzed skeletons, coincides with the truth. Jesus was a Palestinian Jew–not white. The other "Jesus white" films never show the miracles, but this film used modern filming techniques and special effects, showed Jesus stopping stones in the air, etc. The black Jesus in this film is very identical to the computerized portrait that British forensic experts and Israeli archaeologists made. I liked. Also the way the Romans erected the cross (in the crucifixion) is the most realistic way, no other film showed it so realistically. The words that Clarence spoke to the humans gave the feeling that Jesus himself spoke through him. The film has beautiful messages and in some parts is historically realistic.
Jay Z spent millions of dollars blackwashing Jews and Jesus.
Contrary to pouplar opinion. I initially thought this movie would be blasphemous and granted some parts are questionable but i actually thought it represented Jesus Himself very well and His nature accurately. I think that at the root of the movie though Clarence is a controversial character, he becames aware of his own blasphemous behavior and repents, becoming a believer.  It is easy to judge him and see him as rebellious, disrespectful etc. etc. but it isn't a complete representation of his character. He is also a lost soul, deeply searching for meaning and to be somebody. We cannot judge those outside the church with the same measurement we use to judge those in the church (1 Cor. 5:12) which is why when Jesus dies He forgives His enemies for not knowing what they were doing (Luke 23:24). Because they were ignorant and so was Clarence, as stated by many if the character, but the movie is about growth. In real life people do ignorant things; practice witchcraft, commit crimes, etc. But what this movie demonstrates to me and possibly to others is that God's love is so deep that He doesn't believe anyone is beyond redemotion and in the movie, He saw Clarence for who He was and not for what He did and I believe that is who Clarence would become after the ending. Just a point to consider.
this is evil
Romans jew-ISH ✡️ ppl took our land. Hebrew Israelites 12 tribes of Israel is physical bloodline. U cant convert into a Isreal. Real jews are in America & are dark skinned. Hebrew Israelites. Proof in bible is Deuteronomy 28- onward.
This movie is a 5 percent nation trojan horse...
Folks where can I find the song Die 4 you from this trailer? Originally it was a Prince one, but this version? rocks! can't find it anywhere! help ;)
Has a black person from the Pacific I'm disappointed in you black Americans.
This looks like a great comedy.
To all your religious people so offended by this FICTITIOUS movie, this is meant to be a satire. Google the definition of satire. No one is trying to convert anyone into not being a Christian. And if you all were such good Christians, you wouldn’t be concerning yourself with such worldly nonsense. The movie has made $4 million to date. More people commented on this video than saw the movie, big brains.
Stop!!!!!! jesus he comes
Um filme muito elaborado pelas histórias 👍🏼
I'll stick with Cabrini
Both my sister and father trying to get me to not to believe in Jesus. They have the antichrist spirit. My father loves this movie and  trying to get me to watch it. I struggle with my faith but I have to be strong in Jesus name.
Do people just not care about how disrespectful this movie is to Christians mocking Jesus is not at all something to laugh at it is so disrespectful and ignorant.
That’s the blue power ranger
The bible is 100% fictional, all of the characters in it, including Jesus are fictional.
COMMENTERS HERE ALL ATE ROTTEN FOODS BEFORE WATCHING THIS TRAILER?
Straight heresy
This the true mystery film about dajjal
I enjoyed this movie. It was thought provoking and creates a great conversation with others. It’s different vantage point of the Jesus story.
Not once did they mock yahusha in this movie ! If you did not watch the movie or want to make your own narrative shut up 🤫 remember  he who is without sin , cast the first stone .
didn't know Jesus lived in Africa
Yall are so damn comical 😂😂😂😂😂
For those who have not seen the film in the end he comes to accept Jesus in the end he realizes his wrong doings and comes to God. For those who are upset with the movie yes he does things he should not, as we all do once you accept the lord and live righteously you shall enter his kingdom. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. Have a blessed night.
MUST SEE
Looks like a funny movie, I'll definitely be seeing it.
Comments show how silly religion is, to take something man made up like religion and put it above all else is surely very silly.
It's okay, vengeance belongs to the one true Living God! They will pay for this.
Jesus is now African...... of course he was 😂
I’m black so I’m pissed at this movie. Bunch of playing around with this movie. If you wanted to be real, be real with this movie
ITS A GREAT MOVIE....AND NO MOVIE CAN EVER DEFEAT MY SPIRITUALITY ONLY THE WEAK ARE AFFECTED ....that is all
This movie flopped 🙌🏽
what a blasphemy
the wrath of God is upon you all who made this movie
If you can look past the bullshit from a christian perspective: you might be able to take some positive stuff from this. I do like thwt they DO acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah in this movie. I dont like at all how they did this ending with him. What could have been a great way to end this was make him the thief that joined Jesus. I was really hoping thats how the ending could have been. But it is unfortunate they didnt.
Blasphemy
Excellent movie, top production quality
This looks just awful!
“Yeshua the way the truth and the life, no one cometh unto the father except through HIM”.  Satan hears the name of Yeshua and trembles, Christianity the ONLY true religion, that is why they can’t stop attacking it.
If you have courage then make a movie on islam and prophet Mohammad like this one
I'm not Christian and this movie looks like so boring not watching.
honest question here. from the poster is this like a black jesus thing or something?
This looks awesome! Any one quoting bible versus in the comments on here must’ve forgot the almighty creator invented laughter, comedy and humor for a reason. It’s not yours to judge. Just to experience. Relax bible thumpers.
The blackification of Jesus goes mainstream 🤦
This shows how much Real Jesus is. They can't get enough of Jesus..Our lord God reigns for ever and ever..🙏.
Someone watched " The Life Of Brian" and decided to rip it off.
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
tbh this movie is actually entertaining & funny 😅
First they whitewashed Jesus. Now they blackwash Jesus.  When will this BS end
sacrilege
Is there going to be a sequel 💪🏾💙💯
Just watched this. Actually has a really strong Christian message
Backed by Jay-z.. a guy who said in his documentary (while making song Lucifer with Kanye), he never read The Bible in his life but calls himself Hov.
What a piece of crap 👎🏾
Juicy Smoooolet loves this! All lies!
Let are a movie about pedo moohammmudd!
The sound in the movie was so loud i had to leave. They said the previews would be loud. I had my ears covered but i wasn't risking breaking an ear drum. Flint west 14
Dat boi got prince masters.
“For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many.” Matthew 24:5
The comments are exposing all the Racist people. Yall Have a problem because they finally depicted Jesus as black lets be real. And Yall cant Stand it, People just cannot take it. Every movie Jesus and the Judeans have to be white. Every Movie. Can we get One movie? Just ONE
If the Clarence like Ben Hur comes to faith in the end being confronted by the Real Jesus, that would possibly give it some redemptive value, but if not then just chalk it up to “a sign of the times.”
This lame-o Five-Percent bs couldn't even make back five percent of its budget.
This movie using comedy in parts would have been better if it was about Simon the black man who helped Jesus carry his cross... The movie follows Simon and his friends around doing goofy things while at times seeing Jesus here and there until Simon helps him carry cross... That would have been better.. ❤
As long as they depict Israel as they were depicted in ancient Israel along with Jesus I'm cool with all praises
Watched this movie and it was amazing, refreshing, exciting and exhilarating ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤.   Ps: We'll find our way back to our God and our home.
The world is a scary place.
the goat n prince in background 😂😂😂😂😂
This is disgusting…
I loved this movie it was good before any of you in the comments pass judgement how about giving the movie a chance and watch it for yourselves
I don't get why all these major stars entertain this foolishness. These are surely the last days and the Bible speaks about these days. People get your soul right. 😢😢😢
“🤣🤣🤣😅🤷‍♂️ “ Balázs 2:21
At least they have “REAL JEWS” playing “REAL JEWS”
i understand this is mockery to the most high but i find it funny how in the white jesus movies if u go to the comments nobody says nun about mockery hypocrites :| people are commedians
Jay z sold his souls to the devil along time ago along with his wife . Now he wants to make movies to spread his devilish lies . No book of clearance even exists .
J don't play when it comes to his films
Wow, awesome movie……………………………………………………………………………………………….Forrr me to poop Oonnnn
This shit ... what is it?
None of yall GONKS read yer Bibles til right now anyway. The movie was GREAT!   Yall hyper religious suckas are the problem and it’s touched on throughout the movie. Ppl who claim to know God but are far from him in your day to day lives. His image not even on you, but you’ll go to church and tell ppl all this stuff but have the worst hearts and Jesus came to save yer mess just as anyone else. Read your Bible and actually live it fam.  YALL have turned so many good ppl away from Gods word due to yer nonsense geez.
So Clarence is a hustler.
This looks so so good. I’m definitely watching this 😁🔥
Looking at the comments👀😂 Christians mock, judge and even demonise other religions all the time but like to get offended by EVERYTHING then they get emotional and start quoting verses out of context to lash out at people who don't share their worldview 😁
Just saw it and it wasnt blasphemous at all... it was really good and it respected the gospel. Im kinda disappointed in people for not even reading the summary... but great movie highely recommend and a lessin of ego, forgiveness and grace.. the way they show Gods love and grace and forgiveness is great and the scripture in no way is altered or disrespected....
The movie is about False Prophet's. Written about from the Bible and no different from most priests, reverend's, minister's, etc.
LETS ABSOLUTELY NOT SUPPORT THIS DECEPTION OF EVIL FROM JZ  PEDOPHILES
This movie showed the true on men using God for profits like most preachers, if you are a true follower of God, you would know this is a reality, they even covered the messiah image to not offend anyone. The Passion was way more a mockery and distaste than anything
How is this mocking jesus? Its SATIRE. Ironically this is commenting on people who want to capitalize on Jesus. Why dont yall troll prosperity preacher channels if you care so much about the message being twisted 😂 If god wants to torture the makers of this movie out of love thats his business lol.
ooooooh i smell antichrist written all over this
Let's do a movie with fake black jewish people mocking Jesus. That'd be a great idea.
I am sick and tired of people trying to rewrite the word of GOD. Making a mockery of the presence of the Father, Son,  and Holy Spirit. Do we have anything left that is sacred.  We don't add to the WORD nor place a twist on it. The word is what it is!!. This is Santantic all the way. We have been living in the last days. What you see, have can change in the blink of an eye.  Whoever orchestra this false book is NOT a believer of anything but self.  Don't be fooled!!!!@
TRASSSHHHHH
This is the BLM version of "Il Ladrone", an Italian movie from the 70's, but that was humorous and had respect towards the things. This is just... BLM, nothing else.
Looks crap.
This movie shows what happens when man mocks God...ppl should watch...its great for ppl who suffer from IMPOSTER SYNDROME  Spoiler he is not the Messiah ...duh
This isn’t blasphemous at all, yall are crazy religious nutjobs
Every person in this movie is black, except the Romans. Romans are white. Romans are evil, so white people are evil. What the hack is going on? Are you totally out of your frigging minds?
Completely blasphemous a waste of time and money. Horrible distasteful movie. I hope it flops and I want my money back!
There is a lot of trashing this movie from a trailer. I suspect Jesus is going to come across really well in the end. Historic? No. But maybe historical fiction that inspires, like “Ben Hur.”
This is BLASPHEMY
This blackwashed  - Jesus mocking movie failed and they'll claim "racism" instead of terrible/sacrilege trash.
Yes stupid as anglophone who like to show racialist interpretation of history. This is prove than the made cultural appropriation against palestians and jews. England is racidt and we all know than because the try to exterminate ireland. They have stop black slavery just to install irish slavery. Its an historical fact but england don't like the truth
It's stupid to show black people in an palestiniens land.
They’re not mocking Jesus have mercy on y’all soul their a lesson to every movie remove Jesus and put ur self in his shoes worship yourself like your own god that’s the magic in every religion
We just out here mocking God, and thinking He’s nothing but a myth, a joke and or not real. I’m afraid of the punishment because I don’t think He’ll find faith on the earth
God will judge accordingly and his wrath awaits the unrepentant.
And all the real Christians said "TRASH" Matthew 7 vs 15-20 Don't support Jay Z or any one he surrounds himself with,he is a hater of Jesus
Satan is so desperate 🙄🙄 😴😴
It's sad I'm truly sorry for him for he knows not what he is doing. God cannot be mocked. Didn't he see what happen to the guy from Brazil that tired to mock God. He had the most gruesome death. May God have mercy on ur soul.🙌🙏
FIRE sound track!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
❤ Please, go see this! Laugh,cry, celebrate, all in one movie!❤
TRASH 🤣🤣🤣
Just came from the theater. This movie is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Its the devil behind it... remember there is only one gospel and one jesus ...the devil knows this and he knows people are religious and think of Jesus highly so the devil will most of the time not try to convince you that jesus existed or that you should follow Him....all he will do is leave Jesus in the equation but change the doctrine of salvation or repentance or anything that makes man open up to jesus ... inotherwards he will tell a half truth...half truth/ half lie...the half truth is to hook you into it and the lie is to deceive you and trap you in a lie....its all about doctrine.. because he knows what you chose to beleive in is what you will live out in your life ...and this 5 percent nation trash is just that trash....number one and the most blasphemous teaching and why you should stay away from this trash false religion is that they beleive they are gods ...human beings beings being gods...and this is literally the original lie that lucifer used on the firsr human beings that if they ate the forbidden fruit in the garden they would be like gods... Its the same lie that brought all of us into sin and the devils kingdom and its the same lie Lucifer is using with the 5 percenters and this trash movie ...go look up all the soo called 5 percenters from jay z to erykah badu and tell me which of them has repented of their wickedness and living a holy lifestyle....none of them ...look at the famous people in this organization and think of the satanic influence they have wielded with thier talents and gifts....these are the whose who of luicfers.satanic entertainment kingdom..people whose message has corrupted young minds especially black American lives .. And on another note isnt it interesting that this blasphemous movie comes out at the same time as the lil  nas x satanic music ?..trust me ..its not a coincidence...the devil is after guallible souls and this is another net to trap peoples souls to drag them to hell using doctrines of demons ..think where this movie is coming from...which camp is it coming from ....its coming from the entertainment industry which if you haven't still yet got it its literally part of  Lucifer's kingdom in these last days
They don’t want JESUS TO BE BLACK. They want to prevent the rise of a (BLACK MESSIAH)key words‼️👀😏
Ridiculous
Is it because he is portrayed black?
Revelations 1:14-15 Hair like wool..feet like burnt bronze..
Give it a fair chance ..not showing in all AMC theatres in NJ.  How do you expect it to top a silly movie like Mean Girls
The problem people have is that the fact that Jesus is black and he was never White that’s the problem they will have. They have to face reality it’s all over the Bible and when God comes back we’ll just have to deal with it or end up with their forefathers.Hollywood screwed people up enough with ws movies about God. I would stay away from anything they produce The only thing probably accurate about this is their skin colour and hair for once as everyone knows except ws and their stupidity.
God forgive this blasphemy.
Awesome movie a big twist at the end please go see it I loved it a good message with laughter and have a tissue for the pouring tears
The government removed Jesus from schools and public also went as far to have FBI illegally monitor catholic churches and individuals now they are the one bringing Jesus back into society only to mock Jesus. When I think of these things what I realized is that family Customs have been removed because inflation means that both parents have to work to support a family leaving the millennial to be influenced by social media influencers that have a agenda to further grasp control of the future. For greed will be their demise. Greed has many faces and greed will attack greed.
Unrelated topic. Jesus is from Jerusalem. Jerusalem is in Africa 110° weather.. A fact is he was never caucasian. Ever. I'll check this movie out at some point
Would have been great for my backyard Bible School✨🕊️✨.
blas·phe·my  the act or offense of speaking sacrilegiously about God or sacred things; profane talk.   from Oxford Languages ·
Revelation 1:14-15 [14]His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; [15]And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.

My adopted father was an Episcopal Minister. Additionally, he was an educator who taught a course called, "The History of the Bible." He'd start his class on day one, standing in front of the students, and he'd begin to tear out pages of the Bible and throw them into a garbage can. Inevitably, a sizable number of students would walk out, but it never failed, His objective was to teach those who were solid in their religion, just as he was; After all, he was a person whom thousands came to to learn the ways of the religion. However, he stated that if you could not stand critique, or controversy, or a challenge to your belief system, or if you could not see past what he termed, "the religiosity" of your belief system, then you would not be able to stand his class. He would reiterate to those strong enough, courageous enough to have withstood the tearing up of the book, that this was not Church, this was a class designed to further develop your knowledge base, and increase your intellectual capacity. And if you cannot get past your personal beliefs, then, you know, you need to leave. That stated, this film is not for those who are so tied to their religion, that they can't even stand the fact that a "movie" and in this case, a "fictional" account of historical events, can be made to entertain, then they/you need to stay home, safely in your religious cocoon, and save yourself some grief. Hopefully, one day, all of the more than (2) Billion human beings in the world will one day agree with you, believe just as you do, attend your church, and follow every guideline you do, but don't hold your breath...
they never make a movie on muhammed only make fun of christians
The devil comes as a angel of light like anyone true believers of god knows he was not paid for healing the sick people and he  did not swear out of his mouth and that’s the god honest truth Jesus which was god in flesh was not a man of sin. Go read the Bible people before you listen to the lies that the devil tells you from Jay-z just remember do not add or take away from gods word or the plagues of the Bible will be added unto you. Reverlation Chapt: 22 Verse: 18
Another black entertainment stain.
I don’t know what’s more funny the trailer or all these random bible quotes
I’m fucking with it
News flash Caucasian people Jesus wasn’t well ya know lol.
Matthew 12:25-26 25 Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. 26 If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
Another woke disaster BOX OFFICE FLOP
I swear Lakeith Stanfield hasn’t been a part of a single bad movie. In fact, it seems like every movie that he’s been a part of has been great.
I came here to say how distasteful this movie is, but reading all the other comments I realize there’s a whole lot more of us standing up for Jesus than not, Im proud to me a member of this bunch, Jesus gave his life for us , we need to now give him ours Bless all of you
🤣😂🤣😂🥲😂🤣🤣I accept that message
Let's watch the movie first before jumping into conclusions. I strongly believe it's a satire on African fake prophets.
All these scripture comments 😂😂 miss us with that! Can't wait to see this movie!🎉
I hope it flops.
Is this supposed to be funny though? I don't get it
🍿🎥🎬
This gone piss a lot of Christians off.   Looks like a good movie though
What sad days we have in these last days. I can only imagine what will be for those who took part in this project.
Now yall worry bout a movie. I name countless movies no matter your intents. Let it go.
Book of Clarence black move teyanna tylor
First I was angry then sad but now I’m smiling thinking wow “ for a man who most don’t believe in it truly shows how scared you all are of him”. Every knee will bow!!! He says. Be ready cause HES COMING…
”This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: “Do not let your prophets and fortune-tellers who are with you in the land of Babylon trick you. Do not listen to their dreams,“ ‭‭Jeremiah‬ ‭29‬:‭8‬ ‭ Their dreams are to brainwash you into their lies and to take you away from Jesus. Hollywood is corrupt; do you see them doing this with any other religion?
You couldn't pay me to see this 😂  Jay-Z and beyonce think they are God's because everyone keeps telling them they are.
just BS spoofing BS? the pool is deep
Well at least they got his color right 😅
If it's half as good as 'The Last Hangover' I'll be impressed
Blasphemy! Jay Z helping produce this movie makes it even worse.
There are many ways I can view this film. As a film enthusiast, the trailer seams confused as to what kind of tone it's trying to proclaim. I mean, is this film a comedy like "Life of Brian", or some sort of historical drama? As a promoter of racial equity, I'm stunned that the population of first century Israel looks more like modern day Uganda. But considering all the Romans still look Caucasian, I'm afraid it may be another attempt by modern Hollywood to paint all white people as evil. As a lover of history, could someone explain where we have an account of a second Messiah? And as a Christian, my question is, "where the heck is Peter and Paul?!!" Both of them delt with men who attempted to use God's Church for personal gain. So why the heck aren't they confronting this guy? In the end, this is the most time I will be giving this film.
This is the biggest L in Black History
Excited to give this a chance and see where it takes me.
Yet more cultural appropriation. Shameless.
Movie hindi version ok  I am from❤ india
So that walk on water scene.....they're just assuming he can't swim?
OMG I never knew it was so many haters..smmh
Ummm this movie will no come out in my town that’s a fact cuz ain’t nobody gonna watch it it’s being boycotted at this very moment
anyone who goes too see this movie is a blasphemer
🤢🤮 movie
black people can't make new stuff, just spiteful.
Since when are middle eastern people black? last time I checked they were arabs
Absolutely ridiculous and blasphemous.
I rebuke the devil in the name of jesus
Omg the mockery in this
Also I'm just so sick of seeing ads for this everywhere. I can't stand all of this ESG DEI shit. It's so transparent.
The revisionist history shit has really gotten out of control. Might as well just make a movie about MLK but cast a white guy to play him. Why not at this point?
Vengeance is mine says the Lord
If Christians want non-believers to stop mocking and blaspheming Jesus in film …stop supporting movies like this.
this is extremely racist. not a single white person! it is obvious that the cast was selected based on race.
I hope this movie flops and the actors punished by rhe almighty! Simply terrible they would mock God !!
You want to become messiah  then you are stupid Clarence
Historical ignorance.

Guys, it’s just Life of Brian with a black cast.
I need the orchestral version of "I would die 4U" in a full version.
Im a devout Muslim and yall Christians better start boycotting these blasphemous blacks.
Wow ridiculous. But not surprised.  Jesus is the truth and the only way to God.  Jesus created these humans in his image and this is the thanks he gets ..
Wake me up when Hollywood does this but for the story of Mohammed.
Interested!
Mark 8:36  King James  36 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
Everything the preacher saids isn't accurate either. Take from the feast that which is good for you all else leave behind. Thank you!
Can't wait to go see it😈
So many things to make fun of in this world and you choose jesus that’s what makes people believe even more in the Bible but all will know very soon what side is the correct side
lmfao, a black jesus.
🔥WOW 😮 dont get deceived, this movie is mocking god it blasphemous is not in KJV bible, i cant believe the actress and actors will films this movie, WOW 🔥
WE
Basically a story about every one who was once lost and got found. If black Jesus is bothering you, ask yourself why.
Same people who hate this movie simply because they have never seen a black Jesus scheduled for a theater release so so quote scriptures out of context to feel justified for hating a movie they haven't seem yet. Self righteousness is blinding some from reading the part that clearly says many wanted the influence Jusus had and this is story about one of those fakers who will probably get saved by the end. Basically a story about every one who was lost and got found.
Is this a comedy?
black jesus lol
Сатанисты
Watch how the Christians will now say its blasphemy after they done ate their pork sandwiches and watched their favorite series on Netflix. They stand on that now cause I guess it's a darker 33AD. Had it been the Book of Tommy ...they would fall in line that it was satire and we should calm down
It's a Damn Shame the Truth is Finally out that the Eygptians were Black, and the Jews, Isralites, and, Jesus was Black and they still want to make a Joke of it.
Is it mocking when they make white movies of Jesus wtf wrong with y’all 😂
Wow Jay Z really exposed how weak he is 😂😂😂 This is what they really look like out here in this world, clowns.
Look at white people mad.....
False Messiah
This is what propaganda looks like, divide and conquer.  Create conflict between race, political party and gender... something is coming 2024-25
What is this trash?! Isn’t this bs by Jay z too?? 😂😂 🤦‍♂️
Dear other Black people, Can we tell our own stories? All our own beautiful historical stories from Africa? How we fought our colonizers? Our incredible history in Kush and Egypt's 25th dynasty? Our beautiful an ancient mythologies? Can we agree to stop inserting American issues into a time that predates racism as we know it today? This story hurts young Black kids by lying to them and making it seem like we always had nothing and needed to emulate others. This film is just another form of a modern minstrel show.
Don't mean to sound harsh, I really don't  ! But the only dpirits this movie is disturbing are those weak azz so- called christians whom are more sheep than meat. And NOW you cry for redemption.
Ooga booga?
These movies that mock Christianity wouldn’t dare mock a false god. The enemy knows his time is short, and is running out. He takes Jesus as a joke, and his followers do too. How come I don’t see Muhammad, Buddha, or Hinduism made out to be a joke? God WILL get the last laugh.
Netflix is remaking Life of Brian?
I’m not Bible savvy enough for this. What is this a retelling of?
Why they always making someone black do the mockery of the Bible smh they want us ruined cause we are the chosen race
Psalms 1:1-6 Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers. The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away. Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous; ...
This is like making a remake of The Color Purple but casting it with all white people.
I love how all the slaves are black and everyone else is white. Yeah, totally very historically accurate of Ancient Rome and the slaves of that time 🙄
More woke black fairytales with "Evil Whitey" as the villian to make them feel good & important.  Hard pass on this BS
Hope this piece of garbage film is boycotted and the director thrown out of Hollywood.
He got more than he bargained for.
Why are people so pressed? This movie looks amazing
What a way to acknowledge Jesus true ethnicity. SMH……
Antisemitism, racism, blackwashing history, and mocking the Bible   Wonderful concept 😒
Father of lies
A rapist
Show me one person that man healed show me one person that man has helped show me one person that man has done good for he is not to be trusted so now he wants to be Jesus 😅😅😅😅 he dint even know if he wants to be a man believe me i know him first hand he argues w all women he likes men in a weird way
Blasphemy
And action packed Life of Brian with a con man as lead character...I'm in!
I don’t get whats blasphemous about this movie? It’s not slandering Jesus and its painting the main character as a fraud for trying to profit off Jesus.
It seems nothing can be held sacred
Woke!
Satanic devil's from hell Hollywood Jay Z Beyonce the entertainment industrial is run by Devils
These comments are so disappointing
It's Clarence Time
Galatians 6:7 [7]Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
i love the bible quotes honestly because this movie might be evil. like how do you make a movie about a con artist pretending to be jesus and the con artist is the one your supposed to root for?
Another film about Jesus made by Jews.
This movie is made because Christians are not violent beasts. The only religion that can take it. Do the movie about jewish faith? Lose funding. Do the movie about islam? Lose hand, head or both.  Stunning and brave.
DAS RITE
'Benedict Cumberbatch' LOL
we wuz yizus
WE
Life of Brian was far more applicable because it was making fun of people who would make a movie like this
Iconoclasm trash propaganda  Now do a black Moses and Mohammad you scumbags.
Certain religious people in Hollywood sure do like making movies trashing Christianity.
Shiiiiiiiiieeeeetttttt

Any movie with these 2 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂just grab some popcorn Can't wait
So…everyone is black except for the evil white man. Yeah, I’ve already seen this played out so many times. No thanks.
"Lord forgive them for they know not what they do" 🙏
Nope! 🙅🏾‍♂️ I play about a lot of shit but ties not one of them.
Can we create some black horror films, fantasy films, fairytale.. animation movies maybe?… but I’m still open to watching this,  maybe it will open my eyes to some things.
It’s kinda blasphemy tho
When the time comes, don’t ask why. You know why.
I'm so watching this, for the first there's no white Jesus... To me Jesus is black. Jesus ain't white. In the era of BC and AC, there are only black people or brown people. There's is no White. The Egyptians are all black. so is people from bethelem and Jerusalem. But the Roman people came and took over and twist the story and made Jesus white...  So this movie tell the real story and background of Jesus.
Not watching any movie from a Luciferian Freemason. God is not mocked.
“Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in your name, and we tried to prevent him because he does not follow us.” Jesus replied, “Do not prevent him. There is no one who performs a mighty deed in my name who can at the same time speak ill of me. For whoever is not against us is for us.” (Mark 9:38-40)
I don’t think they were mocking God, some saw Jesus and tried to be like him, tried to be false, deceiving people he’s Jesus like out today society. False prophets we have a lot of them around and if that’s what it’s about then I’m here for it. But if it’s blaspheming then shame on you
Damn Is Write, don't Add Or delete
This is so ludicrous. Can't waste my time on this.
This looks like Monty Python's Life Of Brian
I don't think this would be liked by God at all. Even if it turns out to be a funny movie, the premise of a guy scamming people out of money by pretending to be Jesus is not good. Even at that alone, Jesus would not be pleased. We're talking about a guy, Jesus, that flipped the tables in the temple because he was overcome with anger at the pharisees. So if this was around that time, I take it that had Jesus seen him, it would not have been nice. Most likely he would've been scolded and rebuked. If any had read the Bible they'd know that Jesus was just, not all loving, but just. He was angry at times, he was forthcoming, and he called out sin all the time.
Amazing
Of course Jesus was Black, why else would the Jews after waiting for his coming for thousands  of years did not accept him? And don't tell me its because he was poor because they were all  relatively poor. Why they would flee to Africa when Herrod was killing the newborn, why Mary gave birth on a stable why the 3 Wise men came from Africa.  Mary and Joseph were descendant from King David, King Solomon and Moses who lived in Africa and married African Princesses, Ethiopian Jews recognized by Israel since 1979. On and on and on...
😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 "The Lord rebuke you! !!!!!!garbage movie !!!
This is disgusting. The Lord will not be mocked!
Everyone’s upset over a movie that’s literally satire and plays on the idea of false prophets… it’s a joke. Apparently some of y’all can’t take one
💎🥳🔥⚡💯
How is this blasphemy this movie is about barjesus acts 13:1 and the Hebrews are black man Rev 1:14-15, rev 4:3, Daniel 7:9-10, Daniel 10:6, Ezekiel 1:16 wow the Bible describes the angels Jesus and God as black man with wooly hair 🤯🤯🤯did you forget the prophet got called a niger in acts 13:1 only one race of people have wool like hair and get called niger… wow so the people that went into slavery in America the African American negros are Gods chosen people no wonder why Deuteronomy 28:68 says that …
I am going to see it. I think it looks entertaining
TO CHRISTIANS :  Clearly we are doing something right if everyone hates on us like the Bible prophesies
Jesus is coming, be prepared
Luke 22:63-65… “And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him. And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? And many other things blasphemously spake they against him”
MARK 15:29-33 was done by those who passed by and hurled insults at him and told him to come down from the cross.
They are portraying Christians as stupid or dumb. But woe to you who doesn’t believe
Havent seen the trailer yet but i hope this isnt actual blasphemy
Some white guy in sun glasses with an account from 2009 and no uploads. "This is stupid" 3 comments latter "its not about race, I just don't like it for reasons" crying on their 2k phones paid for by refinancing their mommy's home. Soft hands and weak spines are ruining this country.
Black people stealing cultures again I’m Jewish there where no N***** in isreal and god was Jewish not black f you
This movie will be hated by Evangelical and Monty Python fans. The former because they would consider it blasphemous, and the latter because they would (correctly) see it as a Life of Brian ripoff.
wow, that ending got me crying....aksing to walk on water and he does it...."Damn is right"
My man look like Jack sparrow  6 protons 6 neutrons 6 electrons think that carbon saw his tattoos  Or the 6th dimension we're the fallen one dwells 6th to 1st Cant be chaos in 7th 8th or 9th Well only Jah know when Best I could say
Some people know what going on today
Their not dissing king their are mocking the return only through the word of the king will he rule From my understanding  in a nut shell no lie it cracked me up😅😂
This is so messed up, from what i see so far the messaging is, ignore Jesus cause you can be your own god, smh the demons really working hard on jay z and beyonce. I am genuinely hurting for blue and their two babies, i hope  god saves them from such evil😭😭😭😭
black people are the true people of the world 💪🏾
This movie going to be awesome; exposing the Prosperity gospel y’all. All the comments missing the mark big time!

I can't wait to see this movie.  Looks awesome!
Hope J-TrashZ   Makes a White black panther movie
Lol  What’s next ?   Black Santa Claus from Germany.
My top concern as a CHRISTIAN  is the blasphemy not the skin color, some of you are exposing whats really in your heart.
Are u mad at the so called "blasphemy" or mad that the cast is 99% blk ? Either way, im just happy u mad 😂
This movie is witchcraft and I don’t like it god is the god of all flesh and people keep disrespecting him how long do you think he is going to let this world get away with this evil behavior
Just don't call it a documentary this time.
More trash....ima have to influence, especially black people on proper film making.
I can’t wait for the Zulu wars movie starring Chris Evans as Cetshwayo. Gonna be lit.
How do Americans tolerate this woke nonsense by turning it into a movie? Are whites afraid of being racist if they call out historically inaccuracy and blackwashing of history?
But it is the hidden messages you should seek in this film.  Everything has a purpose with a decision that comes with consequences ❤
Oh yeah the city of jerusalem in Nigeria
"He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. He went away and hanged himself."  - Matthew 27:5
Euh....
black people killed jesus!
I'm surprised Hollywood is making this a movie, where all the jews are presented as black people, and it's not being called "Anti-Semitic" or "biblically inaccurate". When I first saw this trailer the first time, the thing that came to my mid was: "This is about to be controversial" because not only is this inaccurate, but it's insulting because they rather have black people play a role of people who don't look like us, rather than tell our story. But, knowing Hollywood, they're not doing it because they care, they're are doing it to make it look like they care.
I hope they include the scene with Biggus Dickus too
So it's basically the book 'Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal' by Christopher Moore
Blasphemy at it's finest and Hollywood signed up for a check in exchange for a soul!!!! Stay 🙏 up my people! It's only gonna get worse 😢
This is so Wrong
If Jesus were black, you can't tell me he'd actually be interested in helping anyone.
This is crazy. Black people didn't even exist back then.
Further mockery. Product of the devil. Praying for everyone involved.
holy shit thats gonna be wild. cant wait for that. and butthurt it will follow.
This isn’t blasphemy. It’s a guy trying to con people he is the real messiah. I believe the ending will be him turning to see he was wrong. Just have to wait and see
Y’all mad because there giving a accurate depiction of the ancient Israelites and not fake ones like those fake Hebrews over there in that fake Jerusalem founded in 1948 🤡
I don’t think they are trying to mock Jesus. There’s another trailer that shows a part in the movie where it looks like Jesus shows up to save Clarence and I’m assuming it’s because they find out he is a false prophet and/or professing to be Jesus. It actually seems like it is shedding a light on those who exploit Jesus/Christianity for personal gain and speaks even more to the grace and mercy the Lord extends to all of his children. Some may still call it blasphemous because it may contradict the Bible and they are mixing biblical/Christian themes with secular themes/music. Either way, it looks like a decent movie.
"The Black Jesus"
It’s about time they made a movie showing what the actual Israelites LOOKED like.
if jesus would have lived today, he would have died under the rubble holding Palestinian children under his arm
It looks like the unbelieving narcissist becomes the believing narcissist? Maybe a redemption arc?
Its obvious this movie is getting hate because it portrays a Black Jesus. Its easy to see the racial hate behind this movie. Its Blasphemous sure. But, They dont trip when white ppl portray Jesus. We know what this is about.
Wow nothing but triggered right-wingers and religious nuts in the comments. That must mean this is a film worth seeing 😂😂😂
Not very diverse
It’s always the super religious people that can’t take a joke. Even then this is suppose to be a movie about someone who doesn’t believe in Jesus and does the same things that he’s doing. But he’s doing it to gain followers and become rich and known, even at the end of the trailer you can see that the wannabe starts to believe in Jesus (there were even people who faked to be the Messiah-so what is there to be mad about?) . Also some Christians believe in there fanfic white Jesus and fanfic black Jesus when he was clearly a brown man. He was brown as the common middle eastern man, you’d think it would self explanatory right. Even others in the comments and sub comments are proving he’s a brown man. All in all this movie is suppose to be a fun watch showing how the life if a non believer turning into a believer (the skin color war shouldn’t matter), idk why people are bringing all these notions and even saying, “I’ll pray for you”, “forgive them father for they don’t know what of they do”.
Well THIS doesn't look like it's gonna alienate its audience! :/
This is not a new story it's a very old and ancient story they're just now telling the truth
Every tongue will confess and EVERY KNEE will bow
this is blasphemy. do not be deceived. “Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin.” ‭‭Mark‬ ‭3‬:‭28‬-‭29‬
What? Jesus was black?
So the original  Aramaic  account of yeshua was one page long...the Roman's built a monotheistic  religion from a one page account of a cult leader...it since has branched off to a hundred diff religions faiths and belief systems...and people crying blasphemy...yall don't know the origins and the historically  FACTUAL beginnings please be quiet and let us enjoy a good story we don't come to your cult meetings and drill you about your zombie sky daddy that forgives everyone even child  molesters  and S.A.'ers 😅
“Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.” ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭16‬:‭24‬-‭27‬ ‭KJV‬‬
Whats sad is there's demographic thats going to watch it... its a disgrace..
Definitely want to see this💙
Wow im so excited for this sorry ahh movie💀🙏
"A bold new vision"...They always come after Christianity.  They NEVER attach any other religions.
They gonna be mad about this one 😂😂😂😂
Garbage! Box office flop.
Somebody explain to me who is this man??
Why was the movie made? I think it’s mockery.
Wtf is this shit🤣
Should have called it "Judean Peoples Front".
Calling jesus middle eastern or saying those people in Isreal are real jews is like calling the current population of the US native americans
Its funny how theres such an outrage this is a movie about a jack leg(fake) preacher in it for the money like joel olstein, peter popoff, creflo dollar etc.. That appears to get saved or delivered.
I can’t wait for this ❤
Triggered Christians in the comments section showing why people mock Christianity.   A trailer that clearly shows a conman, awed by the power of Jesus, and deciding to trick people in his own side for profit, has somehow been deemed blasphemy by believers???  Most people just choose religion to hide their absurd levels of idiocy.
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡
Read the Old Testament. Jesus ain’t mentioned anywhere in there. I’m excited to see this movie
Yoooo i see so many mad Catholics out here in the comments section. Y'all be pressed. But what if God sent all of us to save humanity now?? Palestine, Israel, there are no divisions. And the second you be mad at this post, know that Jesus said love one another.   We're the best chance for the world to survive - the change starts with I
SO THE WORLD IS MAD AT A BLACK MAN PLAYING JESUS IN JAY Z'S MOVIE, BUT YOURE OK WITH SATAN BEING BLACK IN THIS MOVIE:" THE DEVIL CONSPIRACY Official Trailer (2023, THE BIBLE SAYS JESUS, GOD , AND THE REAL JEWS ARE BLACK AND YOU CONTINUE WITH THIS WHITE WASHING. THE BOOK OF CLARENCE IS SATANIC BUT ITS DEPICTION OF THE REAL JEWS BEING BLACK IS TRUE
wtf did I just watch
I don’t necessarily see this as mockery , actually I see it as a very potent idea, look how easy it is for a man to claim he’s the messiah and for people to follow him and worship him. Human beings the 85% are very gullible. Am I saying the intent with this movie was all good, probably not. But again, think about preachers, cult leaders, and other religious figures  how their used to manipulate people into thinking you have to die to experience paradise, or that their justified by God to bomb a country. Y’all need to wake up and step out of that religious matrix
Why are people mad about this?
We watch how many horror films "mocking" catholisism, etc and yet this has the "critics" up in arms...when will those movie makers day be coming? Plus there's a Prince vocal in the trailer. Take my money!
All of you so called Christians who are upset... DON'T WATCH IT... but you have to watch it because deep down you know your gonna love it! 😂😂😂
Blasphemous trash from a man who follows demons. Despicable .
LOL!! I cant wait to watch this movie... lol!1 people in the comments... REMINDER.. GOD INVENTED HUMOR...
We wuz Israelis and shit
This movie is yeah. Glory to the most HiGH
Please, get over it. He is mocking all of those fake pastors that claim that if you don't give them money to buy a Rolls or a G7, you don't believe in him and (by association) God and, therefore, you're going to hell. He's mocking all of those priests and pastors that do a little more than just "laying on of hands" to some of their parishoners.  If your faith is that weak and you think that this is is an affront to your religion, then you should rethink the strength of your beliefs and convictions and the power of your religion. The Wizard of Oz might be an affront or maybe The Life of Brian, too.  There have been plenty of movies about religious conmen, one of the best being the excellent movie Elmer Gantry, which was no comedy by any stretch. And at that time it had its share of critics, also. PTL
Nobody has read the book of Thomas I see it's about the missing books of the Bible go read them 😂😂🤷🏽‍♀️
The Back Music Though.......i am something that your never comprehend
Jay Z hates Ye so much.
◄ 2 Peter 3:3 ► know first of all that in the last days scoffers will come
If I had money I'd take them all out puffy Jay all of them sick fu*** Jimmy Kimmel all of them
Matthew 7:15- Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's. clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves
So a bolder blacker “life of brian” blended with “sneaky pete”.  Ill watch it.
I “ pray” on day you losers think for yourself one day. Gods Sheep (literally).
Of course satanic Jayz is associated with this lmao
Jay z your time is coming!you will cry and regret for what are doing.but lemme give apiece of advice you better change now when you still have the chance. No one is proud of you
Huge L 👎🏽
I really don’t think it’ll end up being like what people are assuming it to be . I’ll hold my opinions until I see it myself.
This seems like blasphemy...for a Christian.
I can't wait to watch it , this will be #1 for sure
Ofc they raceswapped The Bible 🙄
This is a blasphemy you don't mock God
One of my favorite film critics, Matt Page saw this at a festival and said some things that make me want to see this more. First, the main character is a con man from the start. I’m not sure whether he learns his lesson or if this is a Breaking Bad situation where the villain is the main character. Page also said that the casting seems to be an artistic choice in order to show how bigoted the Romans were towards Christians and Jewish people. For example, every historical record that we have of Pilate highlights his brutal antisemitism.
Can somebody explain the blasphemy to me im just seeing a dude wanting to be jesus have bad things happen to him thats kinda pointing to there being only one Living God...
Is it based on a true story?
y'all I'm ready for this. 😂😂🔥🔥
People have made productions like this before. This is nothing new. As a Christian, I can easily see that this was not made for us. So, let those for whom is it was made enjoy it. The stuff made by those right wing evangelical studios ain't good either. I'll stick to my classics like The Ten Commandments and Ben-Hur. I have them on Blu-Ray and enjoy them every Easter weekend.
If Family Guy ever did a 90 minute cutaway, it would be this film.
I thought it was funny till I saw JZee as the executive producer... this is not a joke ... this is intentional
😂😂😂 AMAZING!
Looks like Clarence, from AD 33, is running the same scams modern religious charlatans are running😅
FINALLY a melanin accurate biblical movie...I'm here for the rending of clothes & knashing of teeth from the Jewish Carpenter Dude's hypocritical flock
It's a comedy movie guys, none of you had a problem with Life Of Brain. It's not about Jesus, it's about a guy scamming people.
You guys understand comedy is a thing right? They did this for Life Of Brian.
We wuz chozen pipo n shite.
What do you do if your ancestors were too primitive to record their own history?  You steal someone else's history.
playing with god thats a no no
This movie is pure blasphemy
This whole trailer looks like a disrespectful mockery , even the Prince music Is just wrong.
🪽🌬️
I’d probably watch this if it was on Netflix but this isn’t go to theater worthy.
Goona see it just to see what all the hate is about
Hebrews weren't black
This is so old, if you want to be edgy, make a movie about the life of muhammad. After all, he had the sexual strength of 10 men and raped and plundered his way around arabia.
This movie is blasphemous
This straight trash and mockery...The wicked know that Jesus coming very very soon...Israelites look up your redemption is at hand...leave babylon to burn...They using real hebrews for this mess...double slap in face.😒😒😒😩😩😩😭😭😭🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
I don't care what u white folks feel about the truth of black Jesus because in revelation tell the reveal of black Jesus y'all done now
Guys, you haven’t watched this movie. Calm down. It might even be putting Jesus in a positive light. Clarence is not Jesus. Rest.
The Book of Carlton
Black peoples : “We can’t have anything to ourselves”  Also Black People : Making this movie.   Biggest hypocrites 🤷‍♂️ Literally couldn’t even be creative with it at least. Just a black version of The Chosen Tv show with the same scenes and lines. This is gonna bomb lmao
THIS IS BLASPHEMOUS! You must repent!!!
After western culture and history, let's blackwash religion to
It's funny how your own will bring the most hate. Although there is a tad bit of mocking, the false prophet may turn to truth just like in these days. Finally the true likeness and character of "the people" is shown. I definitely see why 2/3 aren't going to make it judging by these comments though 😔
This is a more realistic imagery of what Jerusalem looked like in ancient time. Not full of yt devils
Looks accurate to me... Common sense would tell you that he would be a black man. Just look at that region at that time, he hid amongst the ancient Egyptians, and had hair like wool. He was hanged on a tree, sounds familiar? Moses also passed as an Egyptian. All of the prophets were black, h8te or love it, it is what it is....
Finally the real movie going to come out as it suppose to by the real people and the real time
I’m having a field day in these comments. Some folks big boy mad.
Fake it till you make it..... that's how they should titled this movie.
This looks so good. Judging by the reactions of so many, a lot of souls will be damned. Such hateful people.
Looks accurate to me.
There will be many disappointed people when they have to face the most high and realize he looks like the very black people many hate the most.
I'm ready for this. ❤❤❤
why do they have british, american, and sub saharan accents? LMAO
JESUS AND EVERYONE IN JERUSALEM WAS NEGROS BEFORE THE ROMANS STOLE THE LAND!!!!!
dont get the anger. he probally has a change of heart at the end. this how most these stories go
Jesus is so-called black and everyone in the Bible you people are crazy and soon the return takes place. You think they were white is insane all your people do is War and Violence. Let use logical sense. Jesus could have never been white because white people burn under the Sun which was created by Jesus 🤣
Great film, I recommend to everyone.
ONLY The TRUTH gets MOCKED, because it is THE TRUTH. The others don't have The Truth, therefore not threat. The TRUTH has always been a threat to them. So The TRUTH stays getting MOCKED by them.
Who is the industry run by? Who did Kanye say? Then you will know why these type of movies and mockings are allowed. To them, the Messiah was never on earth, has never come. Blasphemous right? They don't believe in anything written in THE TRUE BOOK, yet there must be something else to it too, because if you don't believe in someone from history existed, then why go so hard at them EVERY CHANCE???
It’s a clear reason Christianity is the most mocked. Respect to ALL religions and beliefs. If something wasn’t a Threat; would u attack it? Entertainment Has NEVER been here to entertain. There is Always a Message.
clarence ? CN CLARENCE
Wait the same western Christian’s in the comment sections that tell other faiths in other to countries to “just calm down it’s just a joke we will live in a free democratic society. Is your religion that weak that you get triggered by free speech”. But when their religion is “mocked” all of a sudden they get triggered? Westerners are one truly confused people 🤦🏾‍♂️😂
Now we are just making up shit.
Hollywood knows who the true children of Israel are.  They’re just mocking us
shame on the director
OMG, Muslim or Islam jeezzzz they could never try this sh*t. Why whyyyyy why is it always the Christians faith and Jesus.
Whoever made this is atheist. The fact that people are mad about the race swapping is the point of this movie they are trolling you. They are showing people how christianity/Judaism was a scam and what it was really used for.  Your all mad and upset for the wrong reasons😂.
This is probably the reality of it and Christians can't stand logic because it forces them to use evidence over feelings. 😂
🤬 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 be ready this will backfire on u
Pisses ignorant Christians off? God loves it! Im watching it!
That’s why they say it a “timeless story” because since Jesus people have been deceiving people to gain money for themselves. It happened then, it happens now. I don’t see this as blasphemous, I see it as a telling of how that scam began
We are at the end this is to prepare us for the truth do not be deceived
You honor deceivers in the pulpit, worship an idol on the day of the sun,forsake the true Sabbath day but will prejudge this movie before seeing it. Hypocrites!See the movie first and then judge it.
There is many truths and lies to movies like for example yes the isrealites were a black race two the messiah was black but they use a black man to go against him yes the Roman’s were white they put truth and lies
Miles Brown as Miles Morales/ Spider-Man live action movie
Everyone wants to ride the Jesus wave but only his children can reap the blessings🙏
All of these comments claiming this movie is mocking Jesus is simply stupid!  They are mocking false prophets.
Song
Ban this movie
Isaiah 53:2 says that the messiah “had neither form nor beauty to attract our attention, nor appearance to excite our love” Joseph being a carpenter we know that Jesus probably worked with his brothers and their father during his youth, he was probably stocky with short hair with an olive skin color typical of 1st century Jews.
More than one black person in a bible film on a big screen with big budget is enough to make some people upset
I Swear, Benedict Cumberbatch Would Appear In Everything I Come Across
So now blacks are claiming Jewish history yall pathetic
A bunch of cowards in here hiding their racism under the guise of piety. You devils know why you’re really upset about this. COWARDS!!!
What a joke of a movie! That literally couldn't possibly happen since the Apostles where around after Jesus came back to the Father to sit at His right side.  They would come to this false Jesus and expose him, as it happened with the sorcerer trying to imitate the Miracles.  Go read the book of Acts dummies, people just like to portray Jesus, as if this is the only thing that happened in the New Testament, bunch of pagan filthy fools!
Judas and the Black Messiah 2: Nutty by nature
Pray to god
Ain't nothing wrong with this. This shows you who is still in the program. If this offends you. You are still a sheep
The end of the world is very very near USA Hollywood,lesbians ,mocking by god, you will get the price like sodom and Gomorrah satan believers 👎👎👎
This movie should of have more indebt truth its cross blend about a false prophet story                                                                                                      Act 13:6  And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus: Act 13:7  Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God. Act 13:8  But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith. Act 13:9  Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him, Act 13:10  And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? Act 13:11  And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.
Absolute Blasphemy
Many are screaming blasphemy when they should be calling out the false prophets. This story simply shed light to it, and it is worse today then it was then.  Matthew 24:24   For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.
Spiritual power only comes from 2 sources. God or Satan. One is the truth and the other is a counterfeit designed to deceive man. Judge for yourselves.
I can see this movie getting a ton of backlash from religious groups, just like every other movie that has religious elements in it.
Should call this the book of Paul
In love with the movie by just seeing it cast❤
Just to clarify, he isn’t portraying “Jesus” so what is the blasphemous part?
This actually looks like a pretty interesting movie, im gonna go check it out.
I'm going to the theater to watch this when it premieres.
Christians are so low intelligence and brainwashed they can’t even tell what the movie is about. It’s not insulting Jesus. It’s about a man who is jealous of him and pretends. If anything it’s legitimizing Jesus.
Blackwash and Blasphemy, They all die early
Can’t wait for this to come out
How come I’ve never seen people like you come at Mel brook’s movies? 🤔 the movie that you are so bent out of shape about is not mocking God. It’s having fun from the stories in the book. We don’t worship books. We use them as guides. Stop it & relax.
This ❤
Darn it ! I got excited to see black Jesus and black people viewed as holy but this let me down
"Father forgive them for they know not what they do"...no truer words have ever been spoken.
A lot of Christians in the comments getting mad saying their religion is being mocked. How do you think people who still believe in Thor feel, seeing him in every major Marvel movie every couple of years? Your criticism means little. Lmao
I like how afro american are being used and they think they are empowered
Sacrilege
Can someone explain how this is blasphemy? Because the characters are black? Or because it’s comedic?
Where does really this world taking as ? 🥺🙃
blasphemous - this is wrong
If Christianity is Alkebulani then distribute it as how it was written for blacks!Same with Islam...All religions enslave blacks!Only our culture and ancestors have our answer(Ask the Chinese how they thrive without religions given to slaves to behave)!
Jesus is King
A con-man trying to pretend to be a prophet, while literal Jesus is still alive, seems like it should be the premise of a comedy poking fun at racial and religious stereotypes. But this seems to be played completely straight? Like if they wanted to do black Jesus, why not just make a movie about the life and times of Jesus himself and cast the same actor? If its about race though wouldn't they all be more middle-eastern than anything?  This is going to be another one of the thousands movies that's not made for me but I still racist for not going to go see. Billion dollar corporations judging people morally when they don't pay to see their crap movies is funnier than anything in this movie I'll bet.
I bet the twist in this movie is that he has a twin. He's a charlatan who probably gets called out and takes one for the team and die. And boom goes the dynamite.
Why bother making the romans white?
People in the comments seem  offended and upset by this trailer. It’s kind of hilarious.
Soon as I seen the A.D. 33 lmao freemasons written all over it...but hey nothing new over here.
The comment section is why people see religious people as ignorant. Nobody attacked you, it’s simply a different perspective on your world view. Someone imagining someone else’s story in the time of Jesus. The fact that stories can’t be told unless they agree with your perspective (or else it’s blasphemous) is insanity
Blasphemy... you will regret it, all of you.
My God show you his holy hand.
Jesus protect our soul and a new generation until the end of time in the name of Jesus of Nasareth Amen
I’m a Muslim and , I’m just sat here wondering how in the world Christian’s are letting their religion be mocked so openly , like seriously stand up for what you believe in and stop letting them make a mockery of it , crazy stuff. This is too far
Bwahahah I ready for it
Repent and accept the REAL Jesus as your personal  Savior  before it is too late! Time is short!
Ok I hope is good
its clear from the comments people do not understand satire
I bet i can guess who is playing Jesus 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 i wont be watching
As a buddhist, reading these comments is funny. If this really bothers so many of you catholic/christian individuals, just steer clear. No need to state bible verses or anything, because this film's target audience doesn't know them and doesn't care for them. I also think it's safe to say the individuals behind this film produced it partly to get a rise out of all of you. Probably won't be seeing it anyway but Lakeith Stanfield is the goat
This SCREAMS ILLUMINATI CLUB. Daaaaam. I bet the cinema versions are going to have so many subliminals in this one for sure.
🤮🤮🤮 mockery
Goddamn i can’t wait for this movie. Its bout time we see black people playing Jesus! ☝🏾🤴🏾
They all want to be gods but unless they turn from their wicked ways they will split hell wide open eternally.
pfff weak and  blasfemy ... stop with woke and ruin all .
Let me guess Benedict Cumberbatch is Jesus cuz he can grow long hair and long curly beard 😑
Where could see this movie on
Lmao all these people saying this film is signaling the end of days must not be aware of Monty Python. Was that film also signaling the end of days half a century ago? 😂
This was absolutely disgusting…
Dude... I'm an atheist and even I know mocking people's religion like this is fucked up
This is what blasphemy looks like
Hahaha. I just saw this trailer and sure didn't have to wait long to see all the pearl-clutching crybabies with the their undies in a twist over their space ghost stories.
Losers complaining about a movie that hasn’t even been released 😂
Never allow our kids to watch this kind of a movie, they will depart from the truth easily,Jesus is irreplaceable
so cant make movie about Son of GOD being blk, but yes blk man being fraud...interesting
This is actually blasphemy 😂
What is this crap? Seriously?
My god the level of Cringe by posting bible quotes by these offended people in the comments 😬
I thought “it didn’t matter what color Jesus was”!!!  Keep that same energy now White America and all other Eurocentric Minded folk! ☝🏾😂
Looks hilarious and the comment section here didnt disappoint either
A curse is on everyone involved with this blasphemous film.
Well, Sony I don’t think this is going to do very well according to all the negative comments. Pure blasphemy! Maranetha Yahshua.
woah this is bad
True, this movie is blasphemy but yall could except all the other blasphemy movies with ⚪️ men pretending to be the messiah! But why not this one.hmm I wonder why😂?
Demonic
im disgusted
this comment section bruh 🤣
{Disapproval meter}
Antichrist schema!!
They didnt learn from Cleopatra as nothing can teach them hence their lowly state, must be a nightmare to an intelligent one amongst them.
Look at all the triggered Christians in the comment section🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Okay listen yeah there were black people in Jerusalem but to say that the entire population  was black is so wrong and disrespectful to the Jews who live there and whose ancestors were driven out. It’s all just a ploy to give black people a sense of entitlement and pride and those who don’t support the movie to be called racists. And common Jay-Z the man who calls himself Hova AKA jehova imo this character Clarence shows how he feels about God
Yeah, this is going to do very bad. Blasphemy against the holy spirit, is a sin that will not be forgiven.
why are some of my fav actors in this movie ? WhYyYyY!?!?
Looks entertaining. Comment section is pretty cringe though.
They really tried making their own Jesus
This is Hollywood aka the “Babylon” of America’s war with God. Don’t be deceived by this.
Why do I feel like the devil literally wispered in Jayz ear to make this blasphemous movie! Sorry but if you love JESUS do not watch this movie!! It is not of the true and living GOD but of his adversary.
This is blasphemy, there is no book of clarence. Do not be deceived.
I want to see the message behind the movie and the catch I see a real messiah who is the true messiah so I hope this falls in favor of the true messiah ❤ y’all so quick to judge but it’s finally good to see the Messiah finally in his true culture and nature as a Black man 😅
For all the people who is mad that there was black people there. YA DO KNOW ISREAL WAS THE BLACK LAND AT SOME POINT BEFORE THEY WAS SEND OUT TO SLAVERY. the 12 tribe. Isreal is part of africa ya neef to do ya research they putting the facts right in front of you and at the same time making fun of the messiah smfh.
nah
Is this a pseudo intellectual comedy ? pseudo intellectual's wrote it .
These comments are rigged asf 😂
All you people complaining are lost
*The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. I have not sent them or appointed them or spoken to them. They are prophesying to you false visions, divinations, idolatries and the delusions of their own minds’” (Jeremiah 14:14; see also **23:21**–33; Zechariah 10:2).*  Jesus warns us about false prophets according to the Bible. Because this movie depicts  a story that is told in the Bible and Jesus' life, I will not judge the people who made it. I see it as a movie depicting JESUS' WARNING AND HOW IT MAY LOOK IN MODERN TIMES....
😂 Can't wait to see it
This movie is going to break all the records! In terms of Oscars, sales, and impact!...Bear witness
I don't understand.... How's this film blasphemy? Can someone make a point Atleast? Is it because of black casts?
The comments are reassurance that God is not mocked. God bless you brothers and sisters
This certainly reeks of the antichrist spirit, but thank God! Because what's been hidden in darkness comes to light in plain sight for anyone to see!
im not against spreading the word of God, i'm not! but calling yourself the new Messiah and walking on water etc? that's blasphemy
“Knowledge is stronger than belief!” What an absolutely disgusting line.
Darkskinned Hebrews ❤!!  The prophet Noble Drew Ali said the pale skinned Europeans was gonna  have to tell the truth eventually.
It’s crazy they had great barbers back then they lines up are crazy 😁😂
can' wait for this one. looks amazing
where is Dave Chappelle dress like an pimp ?
The amount of self righteousness in these comments is why people run from religion just lean on your faith in silence but pointing fingers complaining is not graceful .
Judging from the comments I think you guys aren’t seeing the pov isn’t to mock it’s to give the medicine to the dog wrapped in bacon, I say give it a chance the messages might be weaved with jokes but I highly doubt with that actor there’s not subtext to humanizing people of antiquity.
Another fictional movie lying to the gullible
Another flop waiting to happen, remember the old days when films used to be good???
LOL this movie lacks diversity. no middle easteners?
This looks hilarious, clearly a black hebrew isrealite follower made it, somehow that makes it funnier
I’m a Christian not offended by this. A story about Messiah complex. Intelligible story about a man who wanted to lead men for whatever reason and then found their ego was in the way. Is the characters heart in the right place or not? They probably answer that question… I’ll have to watch and see for myself. It’s a story telling. Let’s have at it, I’m in!
disgusted...
This real identity of real Jews they were black
This movie is showing how people use religion to get money n blind people
I will be watching it, can't wait
But why??🤔
NOTHING TICKLES ME MORE THAN OFF BRAND NEGROS 🤣
WE WUZN'T JUST KANGZ, WE WUZ EVERYTHANG
Please tell me there are black people who thinks this isn't right.
Jews kill their king - a Jew making a comedy 2000 years later.
Y'all need to chill and wait until the movie comes out. They literally call Clarence Blasphemous in the trailer. It is likely a story about redemption and about finding actual faith even for the most selfish, which is a story told many times in the Bible.
"Prince" never fails!!
No one can rewrite the Bible and God true word
The stupidity in the comments is next level
This is blasphemous to the name of the Lord
Just learned Jeymes Samuel is Seal's brother "kiss by a rose" seal whose real name is Seal Henry Olusegun Olumide Adeola Samuel.
May be its the casting that is bordering some people. They were fakers then and fakers now unless you haven't read the Bible cover to cover. Same people had no trouble with Ruselle Crow's monsters fighting Noah movie. What if it turns out to be a movie about Clarence's salvation journey.
The self righteous are here doing what they do best, condemning without seeing the entire picture literally,  leaving no room for grace.
Nooooooope
Is this like Life of Brian or is it going to end up being a religious movie? I'm curious.
Ooh, I like the way they did that with Prince 's music.
Wow I 😊😊 the best movie ever, open those eyes
Im definitely staying clear on this one. This is absolute rubbish
Jesus don’t like black people anyway….I’m seeing this
we wuz romans n shiiieet
Garbage movie
I can’t believe these ppl are  participating in this foolishness
What a complete BS none of the historic characters indulged in this work of travesty were black.
I have an immense amount of fatigue...
synagogue of SATAN
WE WUZ
Is this should be funny or ? Comedy movie ? Black US culture is so weird. If is comedy movie, fuc.. yea, will watch it. But I think it is not and they are going with full retard. 😶
Finally they showing who really are the children of Israel, its not the 1948ters
Wow!!!! Blasphemy is real and Jay Z is a producer on this!!! Wake up people!!!! This is sickening!!
Definitely will be seeing this. It looks so interesting.
Alfre Woodard's in it.  I've been smitten with her ever since I saw her in the John Sayles' film 'Passion Fish' in 1992.
Wonder if this was made to piss black Christians off and spit in their face?
Everything about this is disgusting..  Wonder if Jay Z, read the Bible already.  I doubt it he might break into tears and give his heart to Jesus, when he finds out how much Jesus, loves and gave for him whom is worth no more than the dirt we step on.
I'm suprised they let black people shine in this light, well done@
Umm isn't the erasure of a whole ethnic group (Jews) from their own homeland and history kind of Racist?   Bloody hells Americans, Hollywood and cultural imperialism... 😅
God will judge you accordingly for this😢
It's going to motivate people to be the Antichrist
As a Catholic who watches dark humor, even this managed to offend me.
I don't really get the point.
I liked this movie better when it was called the Life of Brian, tbh.
Yo cancel this garbage this is really messed up. Don’t make fun of peoples religions like this.
Life of Brian 2024 style.
The most High is going to punish hay seed and these actors for this nonsense and blasphemy!! They will never have any good luck. Just ask Chadwick Bozeman what happened after he cursed and blasphemed the most High in ma rainey black bottom. He died from cancer. Lakeith and David are next to feel HIS wrath and Jay z aka hay seed will be brought to utter desolation and poverty. Blue ivy and Beyoncé will also feel HIS WRATH. Selah.
Blasphemy
if people don’t have to respect christianity then i don’t have to respect other religions
Weeze wus Gyptions Izraliatees built da Pyramids could fly was Jezzzus and Sheeeiiit!
May God have mercy upon our souls. This is madness.. Let them release it. It shall be evidence on the judgement day.
AND CLARENCE PARENTS HAD A REAL GOOD MARRIAGE !
I guess Sony had to spend the profits they made on the Super Mario movie somehow.
Y'all didn't learn anything from Cleopatra, eh?
this is sickening. and ofc jayz would be behind something like this.
God what u gonna do about this movie?
This looks so good!!! I can’t wait to see it 😊
we need to vote to stop this movie
What the F am i looking at ???
I’m an attractive  woman.  I dress modestly.  Lately, I’ve had several men approach me in public, in broad daylight and verbally sexually harass me—aggressively.  It’s been emotionally painful and has caused me to stay in my home most of the time.  Some of my female friends have shared similar stories.  Then I look around my city, and teenagers are vandalizing and stealing property right and left.  People all over the country are shooting and killing one another over a disagreement.    What has gotten into people? When was vile  behavior deemed acceptable?  Now is definitely not the time to mock the Lord.  We need Jesus now more than ever.
With the things we deal with everyday, you know the Lord has a sense of humor. I don't see this as blasphemous, but them offering comedic relief to a tragic event. That could open the door for more people to watch it, be receptive and learn something. The movie isn't even out yet and yet everyone is already deciding how it's going to go.
I see what your trying to do Rewrite history. Haha pulling a fast.
I guess the truth can finally be told that Africans were originally white.
There was a rule that race swapping Prophet Mohammad from anything but a ginger would result in death. How about we bring it back but for all the Prophets. Along with slandering them.
Trash
White people are going to flip out and start lighting up movie theaters when this comes out!
wow impressive feat of blasphemy laying my cards on the table radical agnostic (don't care for mine soul so won't join a camp) but damn you guys really went out of your way to commit whole sale sacrelidge jeeze you uh are very brave here's hoping the big man is either feeling merciful or thinks letting you live is worse
Mocking God terrible!
I’m Christian but I am confused on how this is looked at as a mockery of God. People dislike the movie but I think it add a layer of perspective… y’all don’t think people saw the acts of Jesus and what came with it and was like man that’s cap I am going to portray that to my benefit…. In the book of exodus we see Pharaoh uses magicians and tries to minimize Gods powers through Moses ? What’s the difference between the magicians and what clearances represents?   Point being I definitely think things like this probably really took place during biblical times… if not why kill Jesus ?
Lmfao look at all these scared angry Christians in the comments, I know the premise is sacrilegious but it’s a movie can y’all calm down?😂
Wow. This seems to be a Interesting movie. Great cast of actors.
Definitely a must see ❤
Ja, let's just let God intervene. This is pure rwabbish👎👎👎👎
I hope this is something that proves that no man can claim to be God or Jesus but the real Jesus who dead for our sins on the cross of calvary... Won't judge  but pray it helps non believers see God exists... God above all🙏❤
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOL 😂😂😂
Y'all enjoyed Bruce almighty and Evan almighty, but have issues with this???? Anything's right so long as it's white. Blacks, you're your own enemies.  I'm Nigerian, and this is nothing new. We have tons of movies about fake prophets making fake miracles and the finding the light at the end. That's more real than Evan or Chris almighty because things like these do happen. Fake prophets are everywhere. This is a typical redemption movie. Do black people have issues with this because there are lots of blacks here?  Lmao, I can't 😂
Sinners in this comment section, lololol Let he who is without sin be the forst to cast a stone.  Blasphemy where? Its a story about a sinner amd gis journey towards finding God.   Beautiful! I can't wait to watch this. Y'all can enjoy your whitewashed versions.
Won't be watching this. Totally rediculous!
Is Kyrie in this movie? I'd be a little surprised if he isn't, but you just know this is his cup of tea. My first film will be about Malcom X and MLK Jr being white women. I'm sure everyone will love it.
I hope Monty Python sue the crap out of this movie!
White British Mohammad when?
Clarence? The ancestor of the guy from 8 mile? He would be disappointed😂
This movie made me turn to Fallen Archangel Mr. Lucifer for comfort.
His name is Clarence and Clarence’s parents have a real good marriage
Just another movie where black people are trying to claim is theirs. smh. LOL
So ya anyone else know about how over and over we are warned not to change the Bible period! This means do not add or remove! This is adding and altering in so many ways. I refuse to support this clear cash grab! No Jewish person was black this is a false cult started by a black slave in America. It claims that all white people will be damned and that JEsus only came for blacks. The facts are that this is not true. Jesus did not come for skin tone he came for the sin of the heart! So it is not a skin condition but a sin condition!
Blasphemy, blasphemy, blasphemy. It has blasphemy written all over this movie please do not go see this do not be deceived.
So whats next... The holocaust but instead of jews they are swap with black people wtf hollywood
AM GONNA SOOO WATCH DIS
Bruh, L thinks he's Jesus.
Is it racist to say "Jesus in dah house"? or is this movie racist? I'm confused
wow just wow
They did this with Anne Boleyn, they did this with Cleopatra, Now they’re doing it with Jesus and all the Israelites.  This is just more Afrocentric bullshit.
oh wow this looks really good!
Dang... I really like LaKeith Stanfield, too. This is really disappointing to see.
looking forward to this can't wait. I really hope they show Jesus having a black face in this movie! That will definitely piss a lot of people off!
Blasphemous trash
We wuz kangz?
Looks dope very interesting I see alotta butthurt Christians as usual who are afraid of something differnt it's one to worship white Jesus but God forbid you watch a movie about folks who live in the time of Jesus and still had lives to live while he was doing his thing yall goofy in these comments
Imagine being such a victim...
This revisionist BS has to stop.
Instant flop
🤦‍♂️
I'm not even Christian but I'm praying for God to end hollywood
This is such... BULLSHIT! Way to go Hollywood, your garbage producing ability is truly limitless!
Demonic just straight up demonic
Blackwashing 100% this is vile, disgusting & hypocritical
You could have hired Jewish people
😆  nooooo! Now i MUST watch....
Man religion got all these people brainwashed, can’t just enjoy something😂 I for one look forward to it
are they going to make a black prophet Muhammad next?
Blasphemy 🤦🏽‍♀️
Looks ABSOLUTE GARBAGE! A very pretentious divergent take on a story every one knows from Jeymes Samuel who couldn't direct traffic, never mind a movie. But a pretentious film with the black lives matter angle though sheer flatulence won't be a blockbuster but will make some money. I'm going to wait until it is available direct pay per view i.e. they pay me to endure it! The director Jemes Samuel is also the writer, rumour is he wrote the entire script for this movie on the back of a postage stamp in only 27 seconds.
There aint no one elses history these shameless black chauvinists wont blackwash
...ha... ...Haha... AHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHA _takes a deep breath_ AHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHA 🤣🤣🤣
You know what would be cool? Movies about culturally significant figures that were *actually* black.
Hum. Yeah this looks very much like Heresy to me.
as a Christian i must say...this is crap.
Ofcourse Instead of using that huge budget to make a gospel film actually based on Scripture.... lets go with clarence
You know that when Family Guy did this it was meant as a joke, right? Not a script
I expected that people would call it blaspheamous, but I'm surprised that no one has called this anti-Semetic, given the setting.
You know, God does have a sense of humor. That, and there are many like Judas Iscariot out there. He is/was not the only one lol! 😂
Anyone got the dislike count on here?
DAS RITE.
y'all really bending over backwards to defend a COLONIZER WHITE MAN religion lmao
What a racist film. Blacks should stop appropriating other people's cultures and create films about their own nations and stories. This is just blackwashing Jewish people. No way I am watching this racist crap.
This to me looks more like a parody of how fucked and far the woke ways of thought have gone recently, so as blackwashing any historical character for the sake of it. I mean, they are using stereotypical "Wakanda" accent in a movie about Black Jesus. This has to be a parody, this can't be like "Cleopatra was black". Tell me this is a parody. Please.
Racism at its best.
Looks great.  Can't wait!!!❤💛🖤💚
I'm so glad to see those two actors together again....Thid is going to be PHENOMENAL💛
And then that day they shall say to me Lord.... And I will say to them depart from me, I never knew you. One day every knee shall bow and every tongue will confess. Remember these words. So continue mocking, or repent and turn from your ways. Let those who are dirty stay filthy, and those who are clean remain Holy. I guess we will all see one day.
This is blasphemy.
I can’t wait for the sequel about The Prophet Mohammed! …
I hope it's rated PG-13 If it is, I'm interested. If it's rated R, then I'm gonna pass.
I can't tell what this movie is rated.
"Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour."  1 John 2:18
The true depiction of the Jews: 100% Correct.  The narrative of the message: 100% Blasphemy
Hard pass on this one !
Whats so blasphemous about this? Can someone please explain with a logical answer and not emotion. Im genuinely curious
Looks interesting and I’m a fan of the cast, I’m gonna see it
I have to see this.
“This guy’s a gangster? His real name is Clarence!”   - B-Rabbit
Well time to go drop my jaw next to the titanic. Jesus definitely doing a drive by very very soon.
Cultural appropriation.
The comments got me chocked on tea 😂 and it left through my nose. These comments are golden 😂😂
Why is Lakeith the only person speaking in a modern accent? Pathetic and lazy writing choice
Woke dog 💩 and lies…
I can't wait
Jay Z out here taking a piss.
2 seconds in: Lakeith. Me: Here's all my money. Where do I go to watch this?
Looks dreadful and strained
Is this supposed to be some funny ting? Cause the God I serve ain’t no sleeper😢
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
OK
/SPIT
Looks like dumb fun, reminds me of black jesus the show.
Black American: We want representation The world: Sure, make good stories about your culture Black American: Blacks build the Eiffeil tower,  Blacks build Tokyo, Black were the first people to eat an apple.  One day they'll stop rewritting history i'm sure. For now, we have absolutely 0 needs to watch your uneducated movie ... again.
It's well known that White people have been oppressing Black people since before the Jurassic Era.
how is this bold?
I presume this is supposed to be funny. Have you no fear of God?
Chile,.. I don’t even wanna watch the last 30 seconds of this preview. Its offensive. Not funny & highly blasphemous
Repent
This movie is an abomination to Jesus, our Savior. This is absolutely disgusting. The work of the unholy fallen one here.  Do not be deceived. Sony and Jay Z are apostates.
I like how sensitive ppl are. SQUIRM in discomfort
This is not a mockery there has been alot of people envious of Jesus power  and false prophets including the church and the pope
From the trailer, it is up to our own interpretations. At first glance, I see what is going on in these times with preachers stealing their congregations' money, claiming it will bring a miracle. It isn't mocking God or Jesus, to me, it shows how far "Christians"  would go to squeeze the blood out of you and take your soul.   I believe in God and Jesus. But these churches out there look just like "the book of Clarence".
This movie will bomb at the Box office and will not even be viewed on Netflix, so it shall be written so it shall be done.
JayZ on that bull….
Wonderful, brilliant idea.This will be my movie of the year, as expected, my Black Religious people have no sense of humour whatsoever.
Oh yeah, another piece of shit I'll avoid
You know it's some matrix sh* when Jaymes Samuels & Jay-Z are involved.
Christians are gonna be real angry about this one 😅😅
This guy's a gangsta?💀
I was sold when I saw Alfre Woodard 😊
9.5m views 😮but only 6.9 like😂
Y’all are disgusting making fun of this 🤦🏾‍♂️ LORD FORGIVE THEM FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO.   OPEN UR EYES AND STOP BEING PAWNS TO THESE LOW CLASS DEMONS
No just a hard no no no no no!!! 👎👎👎👎👎👎
Why didn’t you name it “The Book of Simon the Magi”? Bc this blasphemous character actually existed already.
I know full WELL y'all didn't make Jesus black. Y'all just LOVE hearing white folks complain😂
God loves you ❤️ ☦️
Definitely have to see this.
Judgement day is coming and many will be deceive in the last days. I want to be ready either way. Many people say we as Christians believe in false hope and a false God. But wouldn’t you want to be ready just incase? I mean once the end comes it will be too late to run and change your sinful ways. Or maybe people just love living on the edge. This movie is very disturbing. As a Christian it makes me very angry. 😡
All the white people so upset it’s hysterical 😂😂
Let there be fear of the Lord.
I'm a Christian but why is everyone worked up about this? Just treat it as a fiction story and don't hype it up. Let them mock God but in the end we all know that one day Judgement Day is waiting and ngl... I'd hate to be Jay-Z on that day lol
LOW KEY.....SATANIC.
Blasphemous is what this is!
Blasphemy at its best, Praise the most high... Father ,forgive them ,for they know not what they do.. Luke 23:34.  and I dont recall John the Baptist , slapping Jesus ,,,, God help us
Absolutely not
Dis One Going To Be One Of My Favorite Lakeith & RJ In The Same Film 🔥🔥🔥🐐🐐
I'm truly excited to see this epic film
Dam lakeith you agreed to do this?
Lord have mercy and grace on thee  help us Lord  for we know not we are doing!
It reminds me of Year One
Why was there absolutely a hustler copying jesus
Abomination!!!!
I'm not at all religious but just might watch this because it will make Christians angry. The comments on this are pretty amusing already. Christians love to think they're the most persecuted when they're the ones doing the persecuting.   Focus less on being aggrieved about some movie and more on ACTUALLY following your supposed god's tenets. Less hate and trying to force people to be exactly like you; more minding your own business.
Black Life of Brian?
The movie seems good but don't you think it's abit too much.... I mean someone wanted to be like Jesus😢 yikes!!
Satan is all over this. Repent and believe the gospel, all who are seeing this.
The chosen is clear of this 😂
This ISNT based off a true story? That’s a twist
Of course Jay Z just had to have sum to do with this
Blasphemy
Looks so good can’t wait to see it
This is the MOST blasphemous movie trailer I’ve ever seen
It’s never a Muslim or Hindu spin off film. It’s always the true faith that’s used as the punching bang of the wicked and damn
LOL! Okay, I'm sold!
This movie is blasphemy
“Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin.” Mark 3:28-29
Omar !!!!
Why do I feel a strong disgust within me... It doesn't sit well at all and this is sickening! An unholy crap!!! I'll pass!!! God is not mocked!
Having jay-z in the sound track is very fitting, its about time the illuminati king joined the mockery 😈
“God sent me to deliver his message” - This Video 1:09  (I also can quote fiction and syntax it like it matters LOL)
Was this necessary?
Blasphemy
nice
So it’s a about a street hustlers attempt to gain fame and fortune by conning people into believing he was like Jesus.
Interesting idea for a film. Might be worth a watch.
The bible is a book someone wrote that got too popular... at least we get movies out of it
i think its a comedy but it would be the wrong group of people making fun of JC. considering what is said  and known about the  hollywood crowd being on the otherside, this might not be the best movie to be making, jus sayin, lol - and Jay Z making a song for it too,  the reaction is going to be priceless
We need more movies like this....all the previous white/Hollywood movie's are just as stupid but most clowns think they're historical 😅..make our own versions the way we want to tell it after all its all make belief 😂😂
Damn! This looks interesting 😃
I will not watch this blasphemous movie. Jesus is the soon coming king and He will reign Forever ❤🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽Hallelujah ❤🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Thanks for fostering racism even more tf
“Don't speak evil against each other, dear brothers and sisters. If you criticize and judge each other, then you are criticizing and judging God's law.”
Jay Z basically did a movie about Matthew 24:5. He showed people at that time and still today that would do this. The Bible said it would be a CLARENCE. Matthew 24:24 is about the same thing. I bet you celebrate Christmas Now thats Blasphemy. look on Youtube " THE TRUTH IF JAY- Z BLASPHEMY IN THE BOOK OF CLARENCE NEW MOVIE" This guy put it down Y'all can learn a lot from him. Y'all have to come out of Christianity, MAN MADE RELIGION and come into the Bible. Y'all always say blasphemy and never go to scripture to point out whats blasphemy. SMH
dayum so u be tellin me we wuz jews n shiet?
You know God gonna watch the movie too. Just saying bc ya know he sees everything. If you don’t wanna watch it cool but don’t tell people their going to hell bc they do. That’s not Christian like. Let people make u their own minds. I’m a child of God and I want to watch it. To me he just taking it a step further than some of these pastors and reverends y’all like to do too every week.
Now l realize art is designed  by the devil  the way this movie  acted it shows  that directors and producers are devil worshipers 😮😮
Cant believe people even agreed to do this.
Why is everybody in Jerusalem black ??😊
This will be the next brazil? Or  revelation's plagues.
💚🌈⏳️ Stoked for this
Looking forward to seeing this. Looks like it will be about false prophets. And YES to this black cast!! 🖤
This is sick.
so they are making a movie of mocking god? WOW
GOD WILL NOT BE MOCKED.
PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!
Still dont see main leading roles being the face of Hollywood movies played by Latino, Hispanic, Native Americans, mexicans, Asians or middle eastern people.  Its given to blacks more then others. As they steal and play the race card taking it all for them self. for many years by now.
OMAR SY❤
I'm not here to debate or critique, because this is not a surprise to me, but expected due to the times we live in now and according to what the scriptures tells us 🎚️
good movie
What a blasphemy! A complete disgrace to the true words of Yahweh!
Blasphemy..
😂 Doesn’t look to be a jab at JC. It’s more like a story about two people who are mesmerised by the adoration of JC and want to emulate that.  I do believe in those times there were people that wanted that piece of fame too and did something like that. It’s not hard to believe. In today’s age people pretend to be who they’re not just for fame. So why would they not have done the same back then. Everything that is done now has been done before.  I’ll give that movie a watch. Hopefully it’s a good movie with good life lessons
Not the bible scriptures 😂😂 yall got them mad
I’m definitely seeing.  Christianity was never the religion of black ppl.  Christianity continues to be used to stifle many if not most black homes, keeps u blacks poor, their women very single and have blacks a sense of high morality while their lives is a complete travesty. Wake the hell up PEOPLE
When do we get the Islamic version where their ridiculing and mock prophet Mohammed? Disgusting
This is disgusting
I'm so hype for this movie! And they're going to betray Jesus accurately. I can't we 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I’m lost , what exactly is this about
waah blasphemy at its best .they moking The Most High 😢😢😢😢
I GOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!
The only thing they got right is the true depiction of the true israelites back in the day.  They were all black and not white like they depict them today.
i’m not a religious person but what’s wrong with this movie?
I'm all for people mocking legendary mortals like MLK, Einstein,  Joe Fraser... But to mock religion is where I draw the line 😞
Looks great but those accents 😖
🤦‍♂️ I Was actually excited to see Jesus,they didn’t show his dark face to prevent controversy. I agree. Then boom 😔 here’s more Clareance. Yashua! Come! Before you lose yet too many
wooow did he just walked on water? am gonna see this movie more than ones i reckon ..... amazing piece of art
God is not mocked Galatians 6:7 whatever you sow you shall reap it continue blaspheming God but know God's time will come .
So, is this a comedy?
They are all black
It's good to see religious lunatics butthurt in the comment section.  Blasphemy should be a birthright.  To hell with all religions.
here we go again black cleopatra netflix is back again. thanks woke
High as hell in my car and i just can't even understand why on earth they keep basing movies one person, this is beyond Blasphemy They are all the devils advocates. Jesus is the One and Only Messiah The Alpha Omega, man is nothing
Be careful of those who see good as evil and see evil as good..... jesus is coming soon
I didn't even have to read the comments to know exactly how the immediate reaction would be ya'll didn't disappoint 😂 keep up the good work 🙌✊😆
God cannot be mocked. That won't stop Hollywood from trying.
It seems like the world is hell bent on mocking my Lord and Savior. Out of all the religions in the world, why is Jesus the only one to get attack as much as he does?🤔
i dont trust black people who are christians
Jerusalem is not mostly black 😂 another propaganda by Hollywood?
blasphemy
weird , did they swap all the race to black? go woke go broke again in Hollywood
Y’all should just let da movie come out first before we judge please
This is tragic, from the very thought to the execution, it's all nothing but tragedy
Why everyone is black?
😂😂😂😂 it looks so funny. I’m here for it
Listen: Im Christian. Yall Christians in the comments tho, yall are why we have the reputation of being stuck up. Wait & watch, then judge.
😮 Hollywood saw the success of The Chosen, got jealous, and thought they would make their own version. 😮  Really, you know that’s what happened.  Someone in a meeting said “the best show in the last five years is from outside our combination!  We gotta’ make some Bible movies!  Someone call the guy who made Noah and ask him his secret!  Get that witchcraft guy, and the pedophile from the Narnia movie, and hire Jay-Z to be spiritual advisor!!” 😅 Seriously.
This Movie Straight blasphemous
This will flop. African-Americans are religiously very conservative. Mocking Christian belief won't get far. Sony messed up again.
What's the actual point of this movie?
For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
This is going to be fire!
Only God almighty will judge those dat blasphem against him the End times is getting closer so the christians needs to get closer to Jehovah and become More united to fight this Antichrist 😢😢😢
Must y'all do everything for money?
i would text what i told hoV...n than go supp🖤Rt...hiz paGE n hiz wife paGE...n go do Da`Research foR Self° n stop hanG off Da`Person woRd...just know i roc' with Da`Carters since original flavorz...dayONE/ONEday..."that pART"...✨🤍✨
I think it's a comedy so why so many people being so serious about this movie
This is ridiculous, dont watch this crap haha
Dislike 👎🏽
This is not good at all 👎🏽
🤣🤣🤣 damn yall know God created a sense of humor as well🤔
Pure Garbage.
Graham Chapman and Terry Jones are smiling from beyond the grave.
10- "And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."  11- "And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them."  12- "And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works."  13- "And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works."  14- "And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death."  15- "And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."  -Revelation 20:10-15
How can it be AD if it's before Jesus's death😳. They didn't even do their research 😒😒 so sad
Jay Z is behind this foolishness. The money wasted to make this garbage could of been used to feed the poor and not to deceive the spiritual poor. Smh
LMAOOO this is gonna be cool idc
Accurate imagery of the jews being “black” though💯
All that money & power Jay z has & he does THIS??? Having a business & hiring his ppl would've suffice OR teaching his ppl how 2 fish 4a lifetime yet again he chooses 2 mock GOD??? Ohh, 2 gain the world's riches & power just 2 lose ur soul is shameful. NO THANKS I won't watch...don't mock the Bible buddy
I wonder how much someone paid for all the fake christian bots in this comment section. I absolutely do not for a second believe this many people saw this trailer and thought it was about Jesus, and even if someone for some strange reason thought that I cannot even begin to comprehend why a movie about something like this would trigger anyone. To all of us seeing this from outside america, it looks and sounds like it was produced by a christian production company trying to make the bible cool again, and I cannot imagine american christians actually being mad at movies like this. Bots really do make the internet impossible to engage with.
Now do Muhammad
John 3:5+acts 2:38=titus 3:5
This comment section tho lol
How are people saying its blasphemy and the main character is literally a fraud who may end up finding the true path of salvation?We had a character in new testament who wanted to do miracles like Jesus and even wanted to buy such kind of powers coz he was only a magician.
Blackwashing, here we go again
All these critiques and you haven't watched the actual thing. Let me sit down n wait for comments on the movies😅
Jesus is king ❤️
The serpent has been extremely busy this decade
I really wanna watch this so bad😎
I can't be the only one who thinks RJ Cyler looks like a live action version of Miles Morales
This is one of the most degrading and despicable acts to mock God. God will not be mocked!! Galatians 6:7
Watch the movie before you judge, there might be a meaningful message there.
There are records of miracle workers from the time of Jesus that don’t seem to have had any connections to Jesus himself. Apollonius of Tyana is a  pretty significant example that comes up among historians.   I have heard some argue that these “miracle workers” were fakes. That might be.  I also can’t help but think about Jesus’ teaching about how a nation against itself cannot stand. Those miracle workers seemed to be helping. Could they have been doing those miracles with God’s blessing?  I don’t know and I’m not sure how I could even begin to know. I like the idea of a movie that explores it though! ☺️
Did y’all complain this much when ‘Year One’ came out? Don’t remember such an uproar back then..
This movie gives South Park vibes.
This is an evil production. Godless people won't agree.
Pure mockery
This shit gonna be FUNNNNU
BLACK JESUS 😂
Wait....jesus is Black?
i’m sorry, i must’ve missed the part where it said sike.
This movie is truly demonic….Just look at the picture at the end of the trailer where Clarence and all his friends are portraying the last supper…this is straight Blasphemy and a mockery of Jesus
Cannot wait to see it looks amazing 😂
Well…it’s all about perception really 🤷🏽‍♀️ The movie is OBVIOUSLY portraying a FALSE PROPHET. Nothing we don’t see at Church today, False prophets EVERYWHERE and all done for MONEY. They lie just like that, perform shows and fake miracles just like that.
The blackwashing is ridiculous 😂 how fragile are these people?
what in the twisted heaven or hell ?! ...it's a no for me...
Black people get a white Jesus for a whole generation and praise him. Someone makes a brown Jesus and it's evil and demonic. Just like most Christians to assume before knowing the entire movie. 😂
lets cancel this guy
Blasphemy 😔😒
blasphemy! they will go after our Lord Jesus! The world does really hate the truth! Lord Jeus I exalt your name and worship you forever, thanks for saving me from this world and every fake blasphemous idea it tries to throw at us!! Thank, you Jesus!!!
WE
👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
this looks great. can’t wait
Sorry being muslim and mocking  Esa/Jesus pbuh is allright disgusting  Sorry I can't see the appeal of this movie  And the only people who would watch this rubbish would be people who don't believe  Why don't people live and let live respect each other ???
I rebuke this movie in JESUS' name. GOD is not to be mocked .
I LOVE this. Cant wait to watch it.
Nah man that aint right
Beware beloved all the prophecies in the Holy Book are being fulfilled The coming of the Son of Man is at hand repent and turn away from you evil ways, Let he who has ears hear and he who has eyes see
Looks good, definitely seeing this!!
Maybe the movie references some of these fake healers and preachers of today. I am a Christian by the way
♥
This is such a dumb idea. I don't even believe in God, but this movie feels offensive from a black person's perspective. Regardless of my position on this garbage movie Hollywood is racist anyway. This is what we get from Hollywood, instead of more black movies with black actors given proper presentations and representation, movies like Creed or Black Panther or Training Day or Set it Off or that Dream Girls movie or Princess and the Frog, we get lazy tired boring repetitive garbage like Clarence. A waste of good black actors like Lakieth and his costars in this very unnecessary movie. We have seen enough boring retellings of this fake story from this book that can't even confirm what specific year Jesus was actually born. Some of his own disciples contradict each other. And we are here in 2023 still making Jesus movies, plus the only movie to feature a black Jesus, and it's a comedy. That's pathetic and disgusting. There is no god, and there is no reason to still be making movies about a Messiah that never existed. Can we as a species fix our planet before we make another movie about a guy who is supposed to do all of our work for us, even dying in our place so we don't have to suffer. On a meta level, God made humans (based on Christianity's fake beliefs) and he created them wrong and sinful, even that Eve would by nature betray God, and so because of all of that he blames us for what's wrong with us even though he made us all this way. And he hates his mistake so much he will allow millions upon billions to burn in hell, while a lucky few get to be zombies to his heavenly matrix of eternity? That's basically what Jesus represents. A god that can't face his own mistakes so it's everyone else's fault. Humans are F'd up, we suck, but we shouldn't believe in a God that would fail us by placing all of his faults on us instead of fixing his mistakes and fixing life for us. It makes no logical sense to believe in God. This Clarence movie is more tired lazy pandering by a film industry that can't respect black people but wants our money and attention for low budget garbage movies with wasted actors.
Wow, America going further and further down the shitter.
So many butthurt Christian’s in this comment section.   y’all really can’t take a joke huh.  This is “oppression” to you privileged Christians?
MMMMNEAAAH
so its about a dude that wants to be jesus (or rather like him) because...why? jesus didint exactly have an enticing life to make poeple jealous.
This is blasphemous
White Jesus is blasphemy, and all images should be taken down of that imposter
When does the shit end  😢why mock our Lord and Prince would be mad that you used his music he loves the Lord  ... what is this  I'm mad very mad....
This guy’s a prophet? His real name is Clarence.
all the bothered christians in the comments...DID YOU WATCH THE TRAILER?! CLARENCE IS THE BAD GUY, PRETENDING TO BE THE MESSIAH.  CALM DOWN, NO ONE IS MOCKING YOUR GOD.
Why are people in the comments getting so bent outta shape about this trailer? There isn't anything mocking or blasphemous about it.  I don't know about the actual MOVIE but in the TRAILER it appears that Jesus's power is REAL and that Clarence is a grifter.  So what's the problem?
Can't believe people in the comments are actually getting triggered over this... What happened to freedom of speech?
I needed more LaKeith Stanfield after Atlanta.. I miss that show.
So dumb lol
Just wow, but really how can I be surprised. Look who it's produced by. They show you who they are in plain sight.
SERIOUSLY … Always mocking Our Creator. Don’t support this trash, and do yourselves a favor and go support  The Sound Of Freedom movie.
A lot of people seem to think works of fiction are blasphemy. Maybe so, but its not sincere. Either way don't take artistic license personally or...spiritually I guess.
shout out satan
well this will be wonderful or terrible.  But it is bold.
Warning Comedy Anead
Interesting. I’d watch it on a movie night. I doubt it’s edifying though. So hopefully no one is watching it to learn about Jesus of Nazareth
The last times and days…
Do you know that Jesus this time comes back and his white linen are soaked in blood? First God will give you what you ask for. Your savior your messiah. The god of this world will reign brings world peace and prosperity everything your heart ask for. Because you rejected his Son he will have you worship this Messiah and you will. You also will take his sigh. And then almighty God will open the pit for you. And what comes out of there is an unspeakable nightmare.  Read it for yourself. Repent and take Gods gift to you for free. He sees you we all sinner he made a way for all of us. And that is through the dead of his Son Jesus. That’s his way of salvation there is no other way nothing that can be done to Recife eternal life then excepting his sacrifice for us. God bless you in Jesus name. Stop playing around God is holy
Jay z is not a believer! We have Blasphemers making Jesus movies now. Smh!🤯😵‍💫🤦🏾‍♀️
This is gonna be stupid. Peace ✌🏻
A.D. 33 . The lord said,   "Forgive them father, for they know not what they are doing."   ... 2025 A.D. the lord says,   "Father, show them no mercy because they knew exactly what they were doing."
Every knee will bow and every tongue confess Jesus is Lord. Don’t be deceived.
You all got to lighten up its a comedy.😅😅😅
Bold move, love it,defy the narrative 💯 by the way,it's More realistic, considering we are in the middle east,than some cultural appropriation from Europe...
This movie clearly has a agenda
If the church can't damage the message of Jesus in 2000 years I doubt Jay Z with have much effect. Movies fashions will come and go but the words of Jesus will endure
Omar Sy depuis Intouchable et son rôle minable pour représenté la France Jurassic World il se sent plus pisser c'est chaud !  Le film, la violence !!
Jesus is not white…..but y’all have a problem with this? Maybe the message in the movie is repentenance. He becomes a true Christian??
Omar Sy le donneur de leçon sur la France depuis sa villa de LA c'est instant dislike
Can’t mock any other religion but Christianity.   Funny how Hollywood and the evil elite only attack one religion  There will be a price to pay for mocking God.    Why is it that black people think they were the actual Jews and Jesus was black  When the Jews have always been a light brown and been around since creation
This is looking to be a solid film. Cant wait!
I cant wait
This is me not letting a minute trailer inform my entire perspective on 2 hour movie.
People Still Gonna Act Like There Isnt A Demonic War Being Waged On Earth??? Jesus is, was and forever will be King!
The devil ignores all other religions but it makes sense he constantly sends his minions to mock the only true one
Praise god. This feels like the end times
Cherokee bill and jim beckworth on this 😂😂😂
Although blasphemous... it may actually be beneficial to those who are following false teaching within churches today... So, pay attention!!!
I saw the premiere of this film. It was so blasphemous that I walked out of the movie. 👎🏽 3 different theater staff asked me, “Is something wrong?” … I said, “Yeah, this movie is blasphemous”, and NONE of them batted an eye. 🤦🏽‍♂️ I’m disappointed.
They could’ve made an interesting biblical era period piece, instead it’s a blasphemous parody of the story of Jesus. Shame on you Sony.
Jesus is Lord 🙏❤️
Cherokee bill and jimmy working together😂
Another crock of woke shit
wtf is this. No thanks! Harder They Fall didn't really do it for me anyway.
Fwak u JAY Z N everyone actn in this movie
I’m on the waiting list for the tickets 🎫 can’t wait 😊
JAY Z is one of the executive producers. He's a very blasphemous Man. He will suffer so much in Hell literally if he didn't change his way before it is too late.
What a stupid movie
The trailer is getting a lot of hate, it goes to show that the subject is way too close to home, people failed to realize that the movie is about a fraud passing off as a messiah. A lot of revelancy in today's time where people worship their churches and priests, and are being taken advantage of. Maybe it's too close, ignorance is bliss, people don't wanna be called out or realized they've been a victim all along 😂
This comment section is awesome don't mock God do better
Totally want to see this fucking movie.
Why is everyone in this African American. Look up middle eastern people on google images they aren’t black 🤷‍♂️. They have an Olive complexion.
😂 BASED IN 33AD MASONIC TIMES OF JAY-Z😂
idk i kinda of took this as no matter how many “clarence’s” try to be God, there is only one true God
Galatians 6:7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
This is an embarrassment
hahaha, what the heck is this crap?
This guy doesn't  want to be a messiah he shook! Cuz there's no such thing as half way crook!
Wight folks...remove books from the bible...white folks mad when movies like this are made
Who approved this lmaooooo
Jay Z telling his life story of wanting to be God nothing to see here.
Black people, they're after your soul.  These people are twisted.
i can't wait for this movie... 🍾🥃 Let's goooo 👀
The Bible does say something about if someone says here is the messiah or there is the messiah, not to believe it, many false messiahs
Bennedict Cumberbatch? I think he'll be Jesus
Black jesus
Comments proving this movie's point lmao.
Great and talented cast. I get this is a comedy. However, 33 AD Israel's population mainly was and still is Jewish/ Middle-Eastern. Jesus was an inspirational Middle-Eastern Jewish healer and ascended teacher. Why the trend to incorrectly depict Jesus and the Jewish people as Africans?? Then the villains all have to be white?! Enough! Stop with the woke race-division. This is disrespectful to the Jews and historically inaccurate. Please make a film embracing racial harmony, unity, tolerance, loving-kindness and friendship. Speaking as a Zimbabwean/African myself.
Sony.....why u so dumb?
tell me u have no film literacy without telling me you don’t have film literacy. The film isn’t mocking Jesus, it’s mocking those that pretend to be him. Snowflakes much
Pure disrespect all that participated in this film should be ashamed. If they truly knew the authority of who they were mocking this movie wouldn’t exist.
Clarence? 😂 Blacks being racist against themselves.... Clarence has to be one of the most stereotypical offensive names for a black man out there 🤭people too deceived to even see that tho... the world is going to BURN very soon. Follow JESUS and be saved from the HELLFIRE that's coming.
Y'all mad 😂😂😂😂
I feel so bad for people related to this movie. Hell is real and I hope you repent!
I just knew right when he said I want to be like him it was not of pure intentions you see he just wanted the fame and the riches sounds allot like someone named satan!!!
Blasphemous on all levels
Mannn 🖕🏽this movie
No puedo esperar por esta pelicula , que se pudran los religiosos y viva el mesiah
Jesus is the King of Kings!! The devil has already lost.
“How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.” ‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭14‬:‭12‬-‭14‬ ‭KJV‬‬
I hold this movie falls flat
Cool. Now when are we getting the Disabled Asian Transgender Martin Luther King movie?
I am not overly religious and can really take satire or religious jokes well, but this really left a bad taste in my mouth. And coming from me, trust me, that's saying something. Nah, I'm good
ISAIAH 55:6-7 🤴🏽🙏🏽
وَلَقَدِ اسْتُهْزِئَ بِرُسُلٍ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ فَحَاقَ بِالَّذِينَ سَخِرُوا مِنْهُمْ مَا كَانُوا بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ * قُلْ سِيرُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ ثُمَّ انْظُرُوا كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ * Indeed (many) Messengers were mocked before you (O Muhammad SAW), but the scoffers were surrounded by that, whereat they used to mock.
GREAT USE OF PRINCE
This comments section is hillarious.  People really are well programmed.
So, Jay Z does a movie with someone pretending to be like Jesus deceiving people, and its blasphemous. But preachers do it in real life and its defending their wrong doing and we have to forgive them. Nothing in this TRAILER shows that this man is being honored for his wrong doing. I don't know how this movie is truly going to be, but if we don't want to fix what's going on in the real world, the last thing you need to worry about is what is being seen on a movie screen.
These clowns are useful idiots for the ones that control Hollywood
Man some of these comments are interesting to say the least. This looks like it will be a good project and I am adding it to the list of movies to watch.
Makes me sick to my stomach.
I watch anything Lakeith is in, but this.
And made it a black movie on top of that, but let it be serious and the Caucasian gone be all over it… IJS
This has to be by far one of the Dumbest movies ever made! Hollywood will you ever learn? Well, you can piss another 100 million or so down the drain.
It’s called expressive freedom. We have that in America. Going to use the tag line y’all do. Don’t like it? Get out
Jesus is king.✝️
sigh christians and their deluded beliefs of trinity and all that rot
L movie
Christians go shhhhh
I will reserve judgement till I get more info.  Historically speaking there were multiple Jewish Sects during this time in history.  That means multiple people at that time were claiming to be the Messiah. This could be a 'dramatic-comedic' telling about one of those sects.  And even after Jesus' sacrifice there were still those who were trying to dilute or reinterpret his Message.  Just look at Corinthians.  That is two whole letters of Paul essentially reading the church of Corinth the riot act.  Lets not forget the Bible is rooted in history, and we can't simply ignore the other aspects of history that were going during that time.  So my thinking is... let's see if he sticks the landing.  And even if he doesn't, I forgive him. ♥
Saw nothing blasphemous in this trailer. So either y’all are trolls or don’t know what blasphemous means
Lord have mercy on the sin in the world
Woe to them who lead my sheep astray!!! and Prince would be upset about his song being in this!!!!!
No.
Here's black people stealing culture again haha
People scream it’s wrong to mock other religions. For ex burning the Quran, imagine if the made a movie mocking Mohammed…
Movies like this were made years ago too. History of the World (Mel Brooks) Ya know back when people understood parody, or comedy. This whole world is becoming the Taliban. Why don't you all let us know what to laugh at, who we can and can't make fun of. Tell us please. Or get TF over it.
Everyone in this movie everyone who watches this movie are wrong
I think it would cool if someone made accurate biblical films containing mostly African American actors and actresses. Kind of like what the producers of the Bible Experience did back in 2008. Honestly, the visual effects for  this trailer is amazing.  But since it's Hollywood, the message will never be about the true Jesus of Nazareth being born of a virgin who lived a sinless life and died a sinners death so that mankind can  receive the Holy Spirit.
I Ont think it’s blasphemy, it’s a made up story about a false prophet. And it’s telling us to beware of them because they cannot be the one true God.
It's a movie what can I say
Lmao bro was smoking a Philly in the commercial I hope this clown gets to redirect the movie roots - imagine  sure every one gunna be wearing Jordan’s and brand name clothes lmao 😂😂😂😂 and when they sing the about the issue it’ll be a rap song with some slave thots twerking to the songs of freedom 😂😂😂 like a will smith music video
im crying no way nkkas made this shi
To hell with this movie and all the people who mocked jesus, our patience has limits and one day they will feel the wrath of the people
Jz has sold his soul as well as his wife .They both are no good.They follow the ruler down here at the moment the devil💯👍.Till Yeshua/ Jesus comes to burn them!!!💯🔥🔥
I finally figured out how to grow my small channel. Its basically growing by itself now
nooo Lakeith😓 one of my favorite actors, but dawg this ain’t it.. Jesus is King🙇🏽‍♂️
Everyone is so quick to judge that nobody wants to make movies about The Bible anymore because it's so hot-button; if y'all had actually read any of the interviews with Jeymes Samuel or Jay-Z, you'd know that they have a lot of reverence for faith and The Bible and aren't intending to tear it down. Maybe wait until the movie is out and see what it has to say? Seems like more people engaging and thinking about The Bible wouldn't be a bad thing.
Why keep making fun of something that's not real ...........................................................Righ!??!?
All the hate and hurt egos in the comments are DELICIOUS. Can't wait to see this!
Gross.
What in the world?
alternative ending for jim and bill
They are playing with God.. very dangerous.
It's astonishing how they consistently include blasphemy in their movies; it's become a common occurrence.
My grandma told me, "I dont care what the people say the people of Jerusalem are black"
Blasphemy
I think y’all may be missing the point. This is satire. It’s not endorsing blasphemy it’s critiquing it. Clarence clearly saw the messiah, had the opportunity to embrace Him and yet, still chose to use his experience for personal gain. A lot of people are like that today and I’m sure were like that back then. This story explores the fallen nature of humanity( and probably has a lot to say about influencer culture) just takes place in biblical times. This is the director of The Harder They Fall- I’m sure he’s telling the story with nuance and purpose.
JUST WAIT FOR JUDGMENT DAY.
DISGUSTING!
People need to relax it's just a movie. 😂😂 Plus, Gods and demons aren't real. They're just made-up stories used to control the masses..
Everyone be screaming “blasphemy” with regards to this trailer. Are you guys kidding or just following “herd mentality” cos I don’t see what is BLASPHEMOUS about this trailer. This is clearly a movie depicting the life of a certain “Clarence” so what is wicked or blasphemous about it? Lack of cognitive reasoning is all I see here. And no, this movie won’t flop.. it’s already got y’all triggered and y’all are def going to watch it 😅 This is certainly a movie I’m gonna enjoy watching.. Good lord 😏
WE WUZ KANGZ AN SHID!
You shouldn't disrespect Christianity like that.. You have fallen so low.. Am a muslim and don't approve of things like this..
I liked the scene where the black messiah walks on water, at this moment the song 50 Cent - P.I.M.P. should be playing.
These people are not Black 😂. Olive skinned wavy hair. Stop Letting these idiots convince you of nonsense.
how is this mocking?💀 there obviously setting up the movie for Clarence to be the bad guy pretending to be the messiah
As a Christian, I find the trailer entertaining versus a mockery towards Jesus and or the Christian faith. In fact, this film is an example of false Christs, prophets and the attempt to capitalize on Christianity.   For example, Simon the sorcerer of Samaria (attempted to purchase the Holy Spirit from Peter), Paul's account with vagabond Jews, exorcists and the seven sons of one Sceva (attempt to cast out evil spirits), 2 Peter 2:1warns the about false teachers etc. Besides, the scriptures provide too many examples of false claimants.   So, there's no mockery here.  To conclude, those interested in a cancel-culture type of tone (don't support this film-blasphemy, pray for them, they've sealed their fate and other remarks) could benefit from revisiting the scriptures to depict thus film in a positive light. I'm excited to see the film.   Besides, I hope the same one's commenting against the film doesn't watch any films with adverse sexual imagery, debauchery or excessive foul language. Maybe speak out towards the many injustices with present-day pastors who sell false promises to people for-profit and more.   Before commenting, I'd suggest read the film's summary. Here's the worst part - the trailer casts a depiction of the real Jesus (although faceless) in light of Clarence's attempt to capitalize on the faith.    I hope this helps because this film provides a comedic perspective of biblical accounts that actually occurred.   PEACE!

People keep saying blasphemy, can somebody explain the blasphemy for me?
Great choice of music!
blacks are the worst in all ages
I don't understand why people are saying this is blasphemous. The story is about someone who saw Jesus' influence and 'power' and decided to con his way to that level of influence. It's not about Jesus himself. Where's the blasphemy please? From my understanding, this movie is as blasphemous as Ben-Hur is. A fictional story with references to real persons / events
Only if you can outshine 'Life of Brian' in wit and genius.
I wanna watch this movie Now!! 👁️ 👀 Let's Gooooooo
Gnostic heresy abounds.
Why are people in this comment section acting like the Life of Brian doesn't exist  and getting their panties in a bunch 🤔.. as they say, 🎶"Alway look on the bright side of life"🎶 🤣😂😂💀
They went back in time and blunt 😅🚬
N just watch a movie and enjoy it? 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️ everyone is making a big deal out of things that arent as serious in the world these days. Its sad
I recommend no one supporting this movie……. Do not watch this movie ….. it you go see it … you are supporting it financially…… demons don’t care
honestly I don't care if Jesus is black or white, but why make another woke movie ?
I love every single one of these “christians” in the comments. Defending their beliefs yet acting so petty about it lmao  You guys are EXACTLY the reason christians have gotten the reputation of hypocrits and you don’t even realize it. I’m no atheist, but get off your fucking high horse or come back with better arguments.
The History of the World. Not sure why all the critical analysis, I saw nothing making fun of Jesus in the brief preview. The judgement from you people is totally against the grain of the Bible. For the record, Hollywood  has made Jesus Caucasian with blue eyes,   get upset about that, put dark makeup on Caucasians and Hispanics following religious tropes. Free speech though.
Wait, so a movie, that is Jesus adjacent, with a cast full of black actors, is making y'all mad? Well color me surprised!
Interesting that is biblical history black people are oppressed by the whyte man 😡
"BOLD" "NEW" vision
This movie is pure blasphemy. It’s jaw dropping the fact it was made an I don’t want to hate man but even Jay z paying for it so much changed visually an in audible to.
Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come Matthew 12:32
I think it would’ve been much more effective to just do the story of Jesus starring the same cast. Since nowadays everything is “woke” anyways why not do a historically accurate version of Jesus? Here like lambs wool feet, like burned brass.
This is so wrong but am so interested in checking it out. I also pray for God's mercy and guidance for them all.
This ain’t it
Garbage movie, hopefully this is a false trailer, what this trailer is supposed address a black messiah
The life of Brian did it first
Yeah that’s a no
wait hold hold on! This is not it to be honest!! Pray for them please
This is mockery. "And Jesus can't save you. Life starts when the church end. -Jay Z" He worships the devil. Plain and simple.
This movie is a joke. There were no black people back then. Literally a fiction. Fake story. Of course they will mock christians because its the realeast story, other than the other religions. Those are fiction religion created around Jesus. Because people wanted to be like Jesus. Im glad that made this movie, open peoples eyes that Jesus is the only way. Not being like Satan towards God.
Hey, other religions, can we come together and all agree that this is garbage of the highest order
Be careful with what you do.
Because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgement of God! ROMANS 2:5 ❤️‍🔥 Jay-Z… smh idk what to say this is such a blasphemous thing to do!
He who sits in the heavens shall laugh; The Lord shall hold them in derision. Psalms 2:4 NKJV  The wicked plots against the just, And gnashes at him with his teeth. The Lord laughs at him, For He sees that his day is coming. Psalms 37:12‭-‬13 NKJV  I pray anyone who laughs at this, gets molly whopped by the fear of the Lord.
so sad and sick 🤢
This is heresy and blasphemy at its finest… God will not be mocked!! I pray for these people in this movie they find God and repent before they answered for what they did…
Nothing blasphemous about a film calling out FALSE PROPHETS. Tell me you're Judgemental without telling us. You supposed "Christians". You all condemn who Jesus would have befriended & introduced the Gospel to. This movie is proof that we are in The Last Days and God is separating the Wheat from The Tares. Everybody has a microphone and a opinion, but "Ye shall know them by their Fruits". "Jesus I know, and PauI I know, but who are you?". ~Acts 19:15
If Jay Z is apart of this film that all you need to know. No need for debating. 1 Love❤️...God Bless Each and Everyone of You😇🙏✌️✝️...
To say this movie or its producers are making fun of Jesus is a judgment not based on facts or knowledge.   Like this fictitious character, Clarence, someone in history may have claimed divinity and messiah. There are many real people since Jesus'' life, death, and resurrection that have claimed to be Jesus, God, the Messiah, etc.   Doing a quick Google search, I found a list of people such as Alan John Miller, Apollo Quiboloy, and Mitsuo Matayoshi who have made such claims.  The premise of this movie reminds me of the Biblical account of Simon the Sorcerer (Acts 8:18-25), who wanted the power of the Holy Spirit for his personal gain.   I hypothesize that this movie isn't a mockery of Jesus but a story of humans who will do anything for power, even if that means impersonating someone.   I hope to see this movie and test if my hypothesis is true or false.
"Knowledge is stronger then belief" Straight up blasphemy.
What in the heck was that?  I won’t be watching that mess!
Apart from blasphemy, why is it that all people of African decent sounds like wakanda...? Next time you want to make an African sound, come to a specific region in Africa that you want a sound to adapt to. Simple
White people are very upset about OUR RELIGION 😂 but let’s not forget his hair was like wool(afro with curls) and skin like bronze(brown) I never seen a ufo and a white person described like this
We're the Italians
AWESOME, THE Romans, Greeks and British created the Jesus Story to accommodate the Political Climate and Change they wanted to see for the times they were living in and 2023 shouldn't be any different. I dont know why so many people think this movie is a mockery when the British King James of England wrote rearranged and revised his own version of the Story Book 2000 years after so called Jesus death.  Jesus didn't write one sentence in the KJV Book of Stories and Jesus is NOT a Hebrew Name.  🧢😅🥴 Also Giving away your money to Corrupt Pastors is a mockery to yourself because the Creator Of All Things doesn't need money to make the world go round. ⛪💸
May God have mercy on the people who made this evil movie
The main character is really Jay-Z's ego.
DOPE 🔥🔥🔥🔥
yeaaa this ain’t it jay-z
WOW!!!!!! Satan's Hollywood casting their spells are usual... Absolute blasphemy. We are living in the End Times! The time to REPENT is now! Jesus is KING and He loves you!!! Flee from spiritual Babylon, before Yahuah begins his judgment on this nation...
Of course the Romans look completely Anglo too. Total bullshit.
The Jew using the black man to undermine Christianity and Western history. Classic!
Cool, now make one about Muhammad. Oh wait, that would be culturally insensitive, wouldn't it?
More black revisionist, anti-white, anti-Christian nonsense. Blasphemy, racism, and fake history all rolled into one. When your culture is garbage, you need to steal from others or make up your own. Brought to you by the satanic powers of Hollywood and ✡️. I hope they all rot!
Why the hell os everyone saying this is blasphemy no one can make a biblical comedy that doesn’t paint Christianity in a bad light and still people would say it’s blasphemy
This might be the first religious movie I see that I actually like.
Shame on you Sony!
Well I'll say this about the movie... They actually got the true depiction of biblical Israelites. However, this is sort of unsettling. Galatians 6:7
I know you would never see a similar movie about Islam....that is pure mockery....pass...too uncomfortable to sit and watch...
This got Hov name all on it but imma check it out anyway
Jesus saves ❤
Lol I can't wait to see this. Christians act like they are the only ones that are mocked.
First the little mermaid now jesus smh
This shit is blasphemy
Bro, wtaf
This makes Life of Brian look like a masterpiece!
Hope is hell is opening soon for this blasphemous
“If the world hates you, know that it has hated Me before it hated you." John 15:18
How is this blasphemous 🤔 they are not mocking God they are just trying to tell a story based on the era Jesus lived in. And the guys in the movie are con artists so technically speaking people like that might have existed in the past trying to be like Jesus. I can't call this movie blasphemous just by the trailer alone because nothing shows it is.
Blasphemy.
For those who,”love not the truth”.  Jay Z has made millions in a musician-less music industry.
The state of this
The song choice is perfect, as is the epic arrangement (I Would Die 4 U by Prince).
I can't wait!!!
Its not blasphemy just because Jesus is in the story. In fact the time setting puts it >before< the church so there would have not been the "mocking" people think of.  In reading up it sounds exactly like the how Jesus spoke of the pharisees in that day saying lord here and lord there and doing things to make themselves more important. Clearance is no different but will (as I'm reading) eventually come to understand he had no need to be like the pharisees in order to find importance in his life.
Dislike button ———————————>
I won't take any of such movies seriously until movie producers restore his Jewish name, which is YESHUA.
Yes because eveyone was black in jerusalem except for the bad white man of course...
I liked when this movie was called “Life of Brian”….
not watching this movie
garbage
BLASPHEMY 100 PERCENT. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS TRASH.
As far as I can tell, Clarence learns about Jesus and sees an opportunity to make money. He tries motivational speaking, fake healing, etc. meh, it's not working so well so he probably follows Jesus around some more and listens to what he is saying and, wait a minute, starts to BELIEVE what he is hearing and just in the knick of time. Clarence is turned in to the authorities for being the swindler that he is and he is forced to prove he is who he says he is by walking on water, guess what, he has the faith the size of a mustard seed and he walks on water! Jesus IS WHO HE SAYS HE IS!!! YOU'RE WELCOME! Everybody relax, it's a fun movie we can all go and see, no blasphemy, sinners can be saved and saints can be saints, it's all good. Enjoy
ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. This is blasphemy. God will not be mocked. God has a special place for people like this. Lake of fire you will go.
Seeing all these angry religious zealots makes me want to watch the movie lmao
Smh. “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Matthew 3:2
Miss me with this one. Jay z is a mocker....definitely not supporting this.
Now do one about the prophet Muhammed...I'm waiting!!!
Still, The Book of Clarence is not a “faith-based” film, according to producer Shawn Carter (aka Jay-Z), nor does it make fun of biblical stories and their believers. Instead, it expands on the narratives within that time and world where faith serves as a “backdrop” to the larger story.  “My fear is that people don’t allow that arc to take place, and are immediately judging,” he told Vanity Fair. “This story is about a young man who finds his faith through love and through wanting to become somebody in the world, which is the story of everybody.
Cowards. When it comes to Islam you people seem to have a taped tongue. Jayz has scored another own goal.
After all this you say bad about Him And want to go to Hell , JESUS LOVES YOU and Forgives you and does not want u go to Hell.. REPENT
Ateist are so borin, they keep telling about God
Lord Forgive them they don’t know what they’re doing
JAY Z WILL BREAK THE DOOR OF HELL WHEN HE IS CAST
What in the ...just....what?????
I like it, I can't wait to see it...
Y'all better repent for your sins! If y'all think this is funny, wait until judgement day comes!!
Dont judge to others if so you will be juded by only and one God almighty!!!!!lets wait everyone our judgment!!!!
That’s bad.
He who sits in heaven laughs !!! Psalm 2:4
All of you that had courage to make this movie your time is coming. just know when this same Jesus you insult come back he ain’t coming back as mr nice anymore you will face judgement and the full wrath of God himself
Listen to the song " Not Guilty" by Mandisa
All the stories that could be told of greatness using black people in movies... and you choose some dumb redundant religious belief story.... I guess it's to prove how it's all fictional 😂 next
Looks like bringing awareness to the false comings of those who are saying to be Jesus through a now generation who will do anything for fame, money and so on that is considered worldly as it is not the correct walk to live a life where we should model our lives after Jesus through Gods word, prayer and obedience. Galatians 6:7 is a great reference.
I haven't seen the movie yet so I won't give my 2 cents, as a filmmaker I am eager to see where this goes...
Jay Z knows he’s going to hell, so why not blaspheme more?   “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.”
lakeith been sold out... hes finished .
These people really don’t believe he’ll is a real place.
This movie is the anti crist movie.J zay hates God. This is to deceive the people
I see the jealousy and envy of Jesus in jay Z . He WANTS TO BE Jesus so bad
Lord protect your people do not have them fooled with this Blasphemy
But but you can’t make fun of Christians it’s blasphemy :(. Christians are bottom of the totem pole in life those who fear the uncertainty of death so they hid behind a religion.
Black People  Are we still hurt that the rest of America sees us as what we are but we don't? Gods DNA pulsates within you. You. Everyone is waiting for us to wake up. By any means necessary. It starts with ALL of us. Get Baptized, study the Bible, find your inner peace. God knows you are not perfect. But start.   Clarence story is his story and relationship in finding God and HIS  walk with Jesus. Pointing the finger. I hope y'all do have moment you can say you tried to walk like my beautiful Savior
Yall think Jesus is a joke right? You think He is a cuddly woomsy woop you can mess with however you want. Dont be decieved He is Lord and He is real. Stop playing with Him. Turn to him and he will show you Grace! Repent
The Movie is like any other movie.  It's about a man trying to follow in the steps of Jesus.  What Bible did he have to go off of. He imitated what he actually saw.  That is beautiful.  He was finding God within his self.   Ps...but y'all thought Evan and Bruce Almighty was the sugar honey.
They tryna replace Jesus now. I won't watch this one
Smh
Looks like a great concept and story - look forward to learning more
Blasphemy
Jesus is king ❤❤❤ God protect us from these ridiculous disrespectful people of Hollywood
Finally Jay-Z showing his true nature, the one of his master Lucifer...
People in the comments never seen South Park and it shows lmao
I’ll go see it, if white people can consume bruce almighty with a smile and mayonnaise idk why this is so hard to take in
Psalms 37:13 But the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming.😂😂
Let's Gooooooooooooooooo  book of clarence 2024 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Blasphemy I fully disapprove and resend this.
“But the lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming.”
Shame.
Looks different
Blasphemous film. Don't watch this garbage
Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about them: ‘See, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones to judge everyone, and to convict all of them of all the ungodly acts they have committed in their ungodliness, and of all the defiant words ungodly sinners have spoken against him.’  Jude 14-15
I'm gone wait to see it b4 I give my feed back
From the trailer it seems like they are trying to get people to understand that if we are created in God's image we can perform the same miracles he can perform. Maybe the God lives within us angle. Atleast I hope that's where they are going with this. But with jay-z being involved in the production who knows.
This would be a good study film to get into the minds of fraud Protestants and usurper sects
Just FYI, there are 12k downvotes on this, with only 4k upvotes.  This movie has already failed.  Edit: This video has 24k dislikes to 8k likes.  This film has failed big time
Bru like why can’t we just respect everyone’s religion this wack and the fact they let it air
Man!! We are at the end times!! There a great falling away !! Jesus will not be mocked 😢
This is blasphemous and they need to repent.
This role will kill this actor you do not mock God

Maybe I’m confused, but why are people mad? isn’t the story showing how Clarence uses Jesus name for self gain and  not that Jesus is a fraud.
Pass
Oooooooof
👎🏽 🗑️ Now y’all keep this same energy with the Beyoncé concert. 👀
Sorry, but i can't support this Jay Z . I never listen to his music again.  I choose GOD first making a film like this is a slap to GOD, but hey, he's a choice. I'm choosing GOD over jay z anytime of the day. I lost my respect and ex fan of jay z.
JAY Z time has officially come to an end - believer of God or Not - y’all KNOW THIS IS WRONG ! GOD CANT BE MOCKED !! Just watch 🩷 JESUS SAVES!!
Nah.. im good.
TRASH AT BEST
Satan must be tired of being in the background
This could have been a meaningful teaching tool but instead you 😢 give us satanic trash 🗑
Wow! That's Demonic nonsense 😒
i rebuke this in the name of jesus
Is that Prince in the background??
Yet more Jewish erasure by a certain segment of Hollywood creators. Israelites were Semitic, ethnically similar to Canaanites, Phoenecians, and other West Semitic peoples. Of course there were Africans present due to migration, but the majority of the population was not black. This is more Netflix Cleopatra style BS, but with a dollop of blasphemy added.
I’m excited to see this!!!
These celebrities find new ways to portray black people in the dumbest ways… not only is this film blasphemous but ignorance at its finest. No historical or biblical context…is the producer even literate? We know Jay Z is functionally illiterate
Horrible... Not what we need right now. Dollar Store Ghetto Monty Python's "Life of Brian"
All these comments show me that christians have 0 media literacy.
Ad 33 wouldn’t that be after Jesus died. If I’m wrong correct me but I always thought ad meant after death?
Blasphemy
Jay-Z, too far. Glad I don't listen to his music.
Why christianity being mocked is so normalized and when you try to mock islam you are islamophobic and racist?
Man Christians in these comments down bad. Calm down y’all 😂😂😂
You can’t mock Jesus
This is disgusting and it's a mockery of God. God have mercy on them. Just sad. 🤦🏽‍♂️✞
I dare Sony Pictures to perform a similar sacrilege for Muslims and Buddhists.
Woke nonsense.
False messiah alert , jay z is a servant of the devil
This is very disrespectful to God and his kingdom.. The more you mock God you will face his wrath
I dont know what to think of this trailer. But i must say, bunch of you are some hypocrites,  you ok with going to beyonce concerts,  watching filth on tv, but when you seecthis trailer, you all act like you are not already part of wordly things. Eating foods that the bible say are filthy,  participating in man made traditions,  doing things that are not approved by Jesus and Jehovah's will.  Smh
I will let God deal with them this is against everything that is good and pure in this world.
A wise bird once asked   " WANNA , SEE MY PECKER"   And tht same bird also said  " Wanna see my pecker again??, look at it"
This movie is a disrespect and a mockery to our Christian Beliefs.
this ain’t cool jay z
Are we racist for seeing this or racist for not seeing this? Or just racist because we're right?🤷‍♂️
Finally, people of color representing the Bible 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
IF YALLL GO WATCH THIS, FIRST WATCH YOUR HEART 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Bless us all
Boy yall funny asf....Everybodys Yelling Blasphemy....Its a Fuckin Comedy movie fam....and this is Far from the First Comedy movie to take Place around the Biblical story.....Yall can watch 1000 Horror movies dealing in evil spirts and Possessed nuns and Magic demons as entertainment but a Comedy movie set in Biblical times is to much? lololol and this is the same crowd that complains people are to sensitive today lol Completely desensitized to the fact dozens if not Hundreds of kids might die in school shootings this school year IN REAL LIFE but this Comedy movie yea that really sets you off 😂😂 just say you're uncomfortable seeing black people in an ancient Biblical setting and you feel like their about to tryn push an agenda( even thoe you haven't seen the movie yet) Because any time a black person pops up in media in a place in  makes uncomfortable it always has to be some "woke" agenda to it......The TV show Supernatural had damn near 20 seasons of taking Biblical stories and flipping Biblical readings and teaching and tieing it with black magic and demons and it was one of the best shows in the history of its network.....NO OUTRAGE no Blasphemy claims cuz it was A FUCKING SHOW and we all understood that.....The DaVinci Code took LITERAL biblical readings and Lied On Jesus and said he had a Bastard Child with Marry Magdalegne and That movie is considered a classic and white people LOVED it and Still love tom hanks......oh but a 100% fictional Comedy movie about some black guy in Biblical times Oh now the worlds goin to Hell in a Hand Basket lolol Gtfoh😂
A comment mentioned Acts 8:18.....I suggest people read Acts 8:9-23.  The Book of Clarence is very similar to Simon. Simon was a Sorcerer and was performering "miracles" in the name of Jesus. And people all across Samaria believed in Simon's powers they were even baptized in such sorcery. BUT when Simon saw the Apostles Peter and John pray for the people and they received the Holy Spirit...he got jealous. Simon then ASKED if he could BUY the Holy Spirit and Peter shut him down saying you can't but the gift of God!..then Peter told Simon to repent.    This movie isnt blasphemous but a true story of false prophets teaching. Be careful...everything that glitters isnt gold.
Wow this is sickening blasphemy
I have no words. Just pray for them.
BLASPHEMY…REPENT MAYNE REAL TALK DAWG
Amazing how everyone is judging this film and yet claim to be a believer. You already judged a film created by melanin people but rush to see one with a white savior. No one was there during the time but claim they know what really happened. You all don’t know the truth story and if you are a light worker, you should know that Yahushua would not walk around giving his energy away like they taught you. Bring on this film because it’s time for something new!
Just because this is a different retelling that’s non religious people and the mass public will hate on this and call this disrespectful 🤷‍♂️
Wtf is this 😂 something ain’t right it very weird
Wow.... Complete blasphemous. Only God can save us.
Looks great! Racist's will hate it of course.
always mocking The Most High. smh
This is pure crap
More revisionist history.
Ima see it just because it's pissing people off.
This movie should not be made
maybe Prince intended the song this way.
Historical revisionism.
Just watch The Chosen! Better than this
Blasphemy…
OMG 😮 cool story line ❤
Look at all these snowflake Christian’s I’m the comments 😂
99.99% of the time, If it's brought to you by Holly Weird, it's blasphemous...
😂
This looks great! Can't wait to see it.
*”Jigga Man, ya heard!?” 🗽 - MELL DUNEY 616*
Trash
straight up blasphemous
I'm done with Jay z
It's really sad to see how Jay-Z is trying to throw dirt on God's name like , what is this ? Smh
GOD MOST HIGH above all other gods. Even Satan himself will bow down and say he is KING of KINGS and LORD of LORDS.   “The Lord laughs at [the wicked], for He sees that their own day [of defeat] is coming.”-Psalm‬ ‭37‬:‭13‬   “And EVERY CREATED THING which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all things in them, I heard saying, “To Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever.”–Rev. 5:13
😄😄😄  not all of you freaking out at a black Jesus story when you cheered Mel Gibson like no one's problem.
Special place in hell for everyone involved in this movie
4.3k likes but 8.4 million views? that’s .0005% yikes!! ✝️
Yall dont see the bigger pic.. being dupped by your own kind on a spiritual level for monetary gains... like yall still dont get it huh
No one complained about Ben Hur. I get it…they’re not white. It is what it is…anti Blackness all up in these comments. I’m going to see it!!
This reeks of ignorance
So... why? Lol...
AYO HOL UP
Mane hell nah what type off bullshit is this mane, yall tweakin who made this ahit
I see all of the comments about blasphemous content from the movie and I can understand that seeing the this trailer. Perhaps this is a movie about false prophet and their desire to be famous and gain power. Matthew 7:15 warns about them and their punishment. They have pseudo power in the church but outside of it they are slaves to their demonic masters. Just a different perspective. Have y’all seen the gentleman begging for help from TD Jakes and they kicked him out of the church?
This movie is Racist. Denying that the Israelite of today are the real Jews.
Wait till someone who has seen the entire film tells you how it ends. What if Clarence   started off with selfish desires but ended up a fisher of men. The trailer clearly stated it's about a faker who wanted to be an influencer like Jesus, why is that hard to digest? They were some fakers then as they are some fakers now. It's like seeing a person who have been to jail and covered in tattoos and you immediately assume he is not saved until you hear his Saul to Paul salvation journey.  If it turns out to be an entire mockery then I will join in to denounce it. Secular artist put out Christian songs all the time, we listen carefully to the entire song for authenticity then praise Him if its sincere but when a secular artist uses a film we immediately denounce it without even seeing its entirety. They are many non Christian cast members in Christian films sometimes even the main characters. Our self righteousness sometimes get in the way of reaching others that are not like us
I want to watch this just to continue to prove that JayZ’s god & father is Satan.
Stupidness by blasphemy and these gonna create huge controversy to my fellow Blk people
Well! The cup of iniquity keeps on increasing.
Blasphemy
Come, Lord Jesus!
My belife in god is stronger than some film. And my belifes will not weaver in the face of this movie.  I hope this movie is funny. I hope its done in a tastefull way.And i hope its ends with clarence becoming the type of man he was pretending to be.
Oh my….
Its all cool....just wait until they make one about Prophet Mohammed 😅
Don’t mock The lord your God!!!, if possible Jay Z should take this down and beg for forgiveness
Don’t mock The lord your God!!!, if possible Jay Z should take this down and beg for forgiveness
Antichrist vs Antisemitic: w/o knowing much about the movie, my guess is, it’s a play on the Antichrist vs Antisemitic…masked w/ color  Prince was very spiritual, that song was likely “chosen” for a reason based on “people” they have dealt with.   People should dig into that “curse of ham” for POV and consider the bias and entitlement written in the beginning by the “chosen”   Genesis 9:25  from prophet to profit  From Ye to KRS-One to Lupe to Kendrick, y’all should be really paying attention
I dont know how Christians are getting offended by this
Is it a spoof?
There's always some buffoonery in our black movies. They'll give us ancestral movies on slavery like roots and movies like Malcom x, especially Tyler Perry buffoonery movies. Even Spike Lee movies aren't meat and potatoes. Where are our black movies like Avatar, Star wars, raiders of the Lost ark, and ect. They won't allow us to make an electrifying black movie. Even Jordan Peele movies are buffoonery.. Why won't they do an ancestral movie on ancient kemet? Movies that's going to grab our black youth.. We rather see Tyler Perry in dress playing Madea. This is a sad broken and evil world...
PASS THIS IMAO HAHAAHAHA
Gotta love all the pearl clutchers in the comments when they thenselves are also not free of sin either.
Jayz , james mcavoy, and everyone involved in this film clearly showed their intention to mock GOD. LORD have mercy
I will pass on this.
What is this mockery??!
Jesus is King dont mock God
Nope
Now the devil is making his Job !!! Imma pass this one, this a 666 movie
And he walked on that water!!!
I'm confused. Its it a comedy? A parody? I don't understand... why the slapstick tone. 🤔
The lord won’t let this slide.
Good to see mlk doing the hood justice with his roles 🖤
❤️🎞️📽️Lovers of movies and series are happy to visit my channel🎥🎬❤️
I don't see how this is any different than Mormons. If this is what they want to believe, it no different than the book of Mormon for white people.
Please someone tell me the movie takes a turn towards the end and he changes or this has some kind of metaphorical meaning like he's representing false teachers or sth cause wtf is this😢
Jay Z probably ain’t even Jay Z he’s probably taken over fully by a demonic spirit. Nobody would do what he does if they weren’t. Let him keep his mansions and money, he will learn quickly after his last breath.
Jay z is evil
Lol 😂 we wuz kangz….err Jesus.
JayZ produced
You what’s funny my name is Clarence
This is going to bomb soooo hard
Bro….yaw really try’n to bust open the gates of hell
No wonder they will show black jesus movie because we are once again being degenerate.  How dare the white media let black people show a film about us in a positive light but if it was about a white savior jesus the film would be hell bent on righteousness
Jesus is Lord!!!!!
The "We Wuzzers" are out in force.  Funny, in a sad, pitiful kinda way.
It’s like there’s nothing in sub Saharan Africa to be proud of n turn into art. let’s speak with our wallets n not show. don’t buy tickets if they wanna blame it on us then f them.
A Straight  Wickedness at its Finest !!
With the world coming to a end this movie is only right
looks like alot of false prophets of today! Jay Z was a part of this?! Praying He can use His talents for the Kingdom of God and repent. maybe this is a start who knows! Jesus(Yahushua) can reach rich people who have made covenenants witht he devil too!  but it seems interesting! Love them showing Our MessiaYAH's true color! people hate that!
But it looks like they’re coming from the angle of the “false profit” which there were many in the Bible. I think this a good flip of your traditional Bible story. Bc the world is full of fakes today, let’s talk about it !
I’m not watching this crap. Don’t disrespect Jesus
whoop there it is, by their fruits you shall know them.
Never mock god
I don't like this
Out of all the great acts Jesus did, the production team decided it'd make perfect sense to put all their efforts into making a movie glorifying a false prophet who mocks Jesus and wants to take his place...lol. Jokes on them.   2 Corinthians 11:15 ..whose end shall be according to their works.
This is amazing. Can’t wait it seems so funny.
Let's face facts going to church in the 21st century is going to be out of style today and years to come.
They not hiding anymore.. reality check Jesus is coming soon 🎉
Shame on Jay Z
Jesus is king
I feel sorry for JV and everyone who took part in this abomination of a movie. When the consequences come be ready!!!
The fact that these Satanist chose to attack Jesus only proves that He is the only true God.
You mock god every time you depict a white Messiah... White Egyptians etc.
Lol, yall are really sleep at the switch. If you are an adult and can't see what he is telling you then maybe, you haven't understood the invention of religion! Yall are too damn old to even think that a human can walk on water, smh! Grow up!
it's funny how the protagonist can change skin colors, but the villain will always stay white. What's even funnier is the little to no effort it takes to pump black folks up. Wakanda, a bltch that lives under the sea, cleoblacka, and now a messiah. Where's the François Duvalier film? or the Joseph Kony? Charles Taylor from liberia? Disney shouldve hired a ratchet looking broad to play snow white's evil queen instead of choosing an intolerable jew.
Jesus is king 👑
They never do satires about Islam,hindu or jewish beliefs...this is beyond disrespectful im offended
This is sickening
pure evil.. one thing i will say is AT LEAST they had one thing right.. the picture of the 12 people at the table in the end represents the 12 tribes of Israel ,and YES they tribes were "black" people. Although there were nations not races in those times, our current vernacular has us confused about meanings of words. It still doesn't stop the fact Jesus was black and so were the originals tribes of Israel.
Good luck with mocking God
This is pure blasphemy and those who made it need to repent and change their heart posture about Jesus. Wow!
😂😂😂😂😂
Can't wait to see this
Which part is Blasphemous in detail? The main character finds the real God even tho he starts as fraud. The Israelites after hundreds of years are being shown in their true form. Paul was KILLING Christians before converting. Which part of this specifically is problematic?
This is blasphemy
All the Christians and bots in the comments crying and throwing fits over this movie. It's incredibly hilarious. 😂
Jerusalem AD 33... yet there are no Jews or Romans. The cast looks like it just came fresh out of the rainforest canopies.
This is suppose to be a comedy? Looks bad.......
I am all for movies and other media which use the biblical stories as the stuff of myth, ripe for re-invention, re-interpretation, and even satire.  So I love the idea of this movie. Whether or not it’s actually good remains to be seen.
I can’t believe how bogus this whole thing looks lmao
Jay z is as satanic as it gets. He sung a song with that witchcraft art women lol forgot her name and now this. Very clear and simple do not be deceived or support this movie it comes from the pit of hell.
The artist Prince would not appreciate his music used in this false story movie
The show The Chosen a real portrayal of Jesus
Wow did they learn nothing from Cleopatra....
I rebuke this movie in Jesus name
Hard miss
When Jesus come, are you prepared? JESUS is coming
I love it already 😂😂😂
Why are they black?
This is showing just how it looks when people say they are Jesus.... there are so many people that even let people to their own deaths saying they are the chosen one. But they can redeem themselves in this movie if they show the Real Jesus and show Him doing something only the real Jesus can do then it will be a good movie showing Jesus Is Really the Son of God.
L
Wow… blasphemous
Jesus is Lord
It looks like Clarence is doing what the Bible said men would do. Trying to imitate Jesus and gain fame and fortune off it.
Wow blasphemy for real… may God have mercy on your soul homie. Jesus is King!
Can’t wait to watch 😊
Give yourself an opportunity to think deeply on the content after you have seen the film, before jumping to conclusions just because this appears different to what you're used to.  The trailer clearly shows that the main character is a false prophet, and clearly shows the character of Jesus in a position of respect.
If anyone didn’t know. This is about Simon the Sorcerer, the man who tried to buy the Hakodesh(Holy Spirit). Definitely dramatized and blasphemous but expected nothing less. Yes the people of that time in the area were all black and brown which is how The messiah who you know as Jesus who’s real name is Yahusha and Moses were able to blend in with the Egyptians. Although it’s not about Race it’s about bloodline people love to bring up color though when it pertains to black folk
I think most people in Hollywood like mocking Christianity because it the only true religion
Marcelo
The Five-Percent Nation, sometimes referred to as the Nation of Gods and Earths (NGE/NOGE) or the Five Percenters, is a Black nationalist movement influenced by Islam that was founded in 1964 in the Harlem section of the borough of Manhattan, New York City, by Allah the Father, who was previously known as Clarence 13X and, before that, Clarence Edward Smith. Members of the group call themselves Allah's Five Percenters, which reflects the concept that ten percent of the people in the world are elites and their agents, who know the truth of existence and opt to keep eighty-five percent of the world in ignorance and under their controlling thumb; the remaining five percent are those who know the truth and are determined to enlighten the eighty-five percent.
They are just making obvious now 🤦🏻‍♂️
Demonic movie jesus is lord.
I don’t feel he’s mocking Jesus at all … it’s a movie … speaking on what your pastor is probably doing …
Damn may God have mercy on his soul Or not. 🤔
A down on his luck Jerusalemite embarks on a misguided attempt to capitalize on the rise of celebrity and influence the Messiah for his own personal gain. The journey leads him on an exploration of faith and an unexpected path.
Written and Directed by: Jeymes Samuel  Jay helped produce it alongside Jeymes Samuel - James Lassiter and Tendo Nagenda and in my thinking helped score it and add some sound tracks. This is NOT a Jay movie he is part of it.
The Blasphemy is unacceptable, I will never support anyone who took part in the creation of this.
Looking forward to seeing this.
This movie is disgusting
I can not believe this is being made. I am sick to my stomach of the mockery of Jesus that’s being created. Making fun of our lord and savior. He shall not be mocked or duplicated *Philippians 4:6-8
God dont come from the sky.  God is a Spirit.
How are we the only nation on earth to disrespect our own GOD and Messiah? Smh. All in all the most High God can still if he chooses to use Jay-Z for his glory the same way he used Saul aka Paul.  All I can do is smh and pray he repent and turn from Satan. If not that's between him and his maker.  The great I AM.
The foolishness of man is that they think they are untouchable because they Got all the money in this world but death soon will come and men will all stand before the great white  thrown to be Judged.
STOP MOCKING JESUS JAY-Z YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOURE IN FOR
Nah fam, this aint it...  Im good on this one.
Lol so y’all gone act like they ain’t showing y’all Jesus ain’t real lol
Mockery
Judgement 🔥 comes swift to the wicked ! Blasphemy! Repent ❗
Youre a joke
HELL YEAH
let's see the the kind of conversations this movie is going to spark. Personally, i'm loving what I see and I'll definitely watch it.  Let's see the white Jesus worshipers be mad at black Jesus even though both depictions are equally inaccurate.🤣
Meh ill only watch it for lakeith and caleb
Feels coonish
Wow, it looks like the writers of Netflix's Cleopatra got a new job. Bravo!
Of course lakeith is the lead role in this mockery of a movie.
So many people whining in the comments. Just don’t see the movie 😂😂 stfu
AYO WHAT IF.... JESUS WUZ.... A BROTHA??
Probably written by AI thanks to the writer's strike, and they were too lazy to consult an archeologist or visit a museum to get the Roman armour right.
Prince must be smiling in his grave
"the book of garbage" produced by a piece of garbage 💀💀💀
Let's not watch this blasphemy please
They were not black
I like how they made all the jewish people African-American because they believe in a crack pot idea that black people are the real jews. Also nice how all the Romans are white men lol, white man bad, black man good. This movie is just antisemitic.
Acts 8:18  Simon wanted to buy the Holy Spirit "When Simon saw that the Spirit was given when the Apostles laid their hands on people, he offered them money to buy this power"
It’s not mocking Jesus, it’s showing a man who tries to abuse and lie to others and he’ll ultimately be caught
Unbelievable!!!😡😡
They always mock Jesus, they always take Jesus name in vain.   Never Shiva, Never Muhammad, Buddah or any others..  "If the world hates you, remember that it hated me first". - Jesus
_Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves_ - Matthew 7:15 Jesus was talking about Paul & Clarence.
It’s funny everyone is calling this blasphemous but y’all were silent asl about Bruce Almighty😒
I'm all in.
Life of Brian with none of the talent or heart
It never ends well for those who mock the Messiah
Ooo, a movie that mocks Christianity, so edgy!! Interesting how nobody makes movies mocking Mohammed, probably because if you insulted the religious of Islam radicals would cut your head off. Ironically these idiot directors probably think they are brave
Guys!!! Its about a guy who was inspired by jesus and wanted to be like him and imitated him and at last he is asked to walk on water which he obviously fails. So, the message of this movie is dont imitate god coz god is the greatest.i don't know why you guys are saying it is mocking jesus.
finally a black Jesus
Jay Z is going to hell if he doesn't repent
Looks like a Matthew 24:24 movie
This is exactly how it happened, I was there.
so many people casting the first stone, js
More plagues, hurricanes, fires, tornadoes, wars & famine are on their way. They laugh now. Corona was nothing compared to what’s coming
Wow jay z really
I just wanna know why? The motive? The reason? The purpose? The “message” they wanna give out with this crap of a film? Because I don’t understand.
QUESTION ARE WE THE NATION OF GODS AND EARTHS BLASPHEMY AS WELL WE NO AND UNDERSTAND THE ORIGINAL MAN THE BLACK MAN IS GOD AND THE ORIGINAL BLACK WOMAN IS EARTH IM DEFINITELY GOING TO BE THE FIRST ONE TO WATCH THIS MOVIE GOOD WORK @JAYZ PEACE TO THE GODS AND EARTH 💯💯💯💯💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
I'm getting more skeptical towards the idea jews were kicked out of 109 countries and it was never their fault.
GOD MADE MAN IN HIS IMAGE /G\
This look 😊
Only Jesus is the Messiah and King
They Always love to Mock Christianity only. You’ll never see movies mocking Mohamed or Buddha, etc. it makes you wonder which religion serves the TRUE living God👀 ✝️
Lol. Good movie I'll watch. Great comedy.
its always respect everyone beliefs and religion until it comes to Christianity
White people lied about the image of Jesus for years because his color wasn’t appropriated for some people aka “white people “ don’t forget
BLASPHEMY
Jayz needs to get a new purpose in life dude is pushing 60 still mad about christianity.
So now they tryna tell people they can become like Jesus if they put their mind to it 😂😂😂 damn i can't breath. Just let me know if it was good or not I'll pass
Blasphemous, Jesus is coming soon
Blasphemous
I love the way we all can discern what wrong this movie is . Just never they put black actors that don’t make write still  Praise Jesus
A movie blasphemous to god this movie shows you how the devil works
At this point … god has tremendous patience with us 😂😂  Will not be seeing this 🤙🏾
The blanton morchry is ridiculous... & to put Princes music for what? This did nothing...
Absolutely disgusting. All this just to spend an eternity in hell, not worth it
This looks so good 😭
Yeah ima pass on this one
Jesus is God and I dont care what Jay Z and his fan girls and fan boys have to say because they hate God.
its only entertainment ppl getting all worked up but you still love some Tyler and his cross dressing way homo movies bet real grandmothers dont approve it either way just pray for the non believer
They are prepping up for the persecution. Stand strong in Jesus and pray always. As Christians lets pray for Jay Z and those in the movies and those who mock God.   Ephesians 5:15-18 15 See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise, 16 redeeming the time, because the days are evil. 17 Therefore do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord is. 18 And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation; but be filled with the Spirit,
is this like that netflix cleopatra show but in some type of comedy form ? if yes it doesn't loo very funny...
Jay Z disrespecting Christians and God as usual. Pray for him. I am ex Buddhist saved by God in my room after I confessed Jesus.
this is sad
So it looks like Stanfield’s character is a pretender who wants to be viewed and revered as Jesus. Definitely not a hero. As long as the movie expresses how wrong his idea is, it may not be blasphemous. But it’s from Jay-Z, so it almost certainly will be.
This has “Blasphemy” written all throughout the movie. 😢
💩 💩 💩
This looks good asf
Everyone in this movie is going straight to hell. When you get there you’ll remember this flick of yours my MAN.
😴 2024 for a tv mini series pushed onto the big screen....no thank you.
Complete mockery and blasphemy of God. Jay Z hell is  going to be hot for you where the worm never dies. Repent and stop this mockery
It's sad, these are sad times, when folks mock Yahweh who saved us, I can barely look at the preview I hope no one support this TRASH
NO!! 🙅‍♂️
Wouldn't want to be in that movie I tell u that
Ain't no black people in Jerusalem 😂
LOLOL. What a joke.
“Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life.” ‭‭Galatians‬ ‭6‬:‭7‬-‭8‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
Every time an actor mocks Jesus, they die. I wonder who in this cast won't make it to see 2024.
Blasphemy... this is straight mockery of the Jesus. And Jay-Z being attached to this film may validate that point. You would never see any of these directors, producers or celebrities mock Muhammad or Buddha or any other major religion... but they delight in mocking the risen savior. Take heed... “God is not mock, for whatsoever a man sows, that he shall reap.”
Bordering on blasphemy.
filthy movie another agenda against the israelites. jay z father might be white., he put this bull crap out
Blasphemy
ofc JAYZ is mocking god
Astaghfirullah what is this 🤦🏻‍♂️
Jesus is the only way
Blasphemous movie.. they have no remorse. They should be ashamed of themselves
Reminds me of a very old indian movie "Guide". Looks like this movie is based on the similar concept
When I thought the secular world couldn't get any more blasphemous towards our Lord and Savior.
Jay Z is a Satanist and this movie is obviously unbiblical................I wish they would stop using us black people as the forefront of such blasphemy. I'm ashamed that Lekeith Stanfield is part of this because I like him in movies.
Hollywood loves mocking religions.   Truly Satanics
THE HELL!!!!!😮😢😮😢
It’s only ok to mock the Christian religion. That’s because it’s the only religion that actually true.
It seems ppl are genuinely stupid. There’s no blasphemy in this film atleast from the trailer
Is this meant to turn people away from believing in Jesus this is sad we are coming to the end
This breaks God's heart💔
So, Black life of Brian...
More historical lies.
Why? 🤦🏾‍♀️ God is not mocked.
omg jews were really black all along
• 23 minutes ago Its fake pastors doing what he doing in trailer now. Some yall gonna see them in 2 days. My faith is strong but the lord didn't make a Fool
Meh, i can almost predict the entire movie
I'm here for Prince!💜💜💜
Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. - Galatians 6:7 KJV
This movie looks funny as hell😂😂
A black version of Life of Brian?
Shouldn’t this be called: Paulianity & the 12 thief’s ?
All the ways the film could have went, and y’all decided to go this way?
This shit is getting downright stupid. Jay z cant stop trying to mock God
Y’all just touched the stove knowing it’s HOT. Get ready for God’s wrath! 🔥🔥🔥
Maranatha 🙏🏽
Ban this movie
Esau knows the Truth and knows who we are
Jay Z IS trolling.... he's mocking Christians and Christianity. DO NOT BE FOOLED. And his wife, Beyonce, is living her last days. Her time on earth is VERY SHORT. They both are wicked in the eyes of God Almighty. They are blatant satanists. Be not deceived!!!
Clarence Wendle
Jesus is king 👑
Ban this movie ❌❌❌❌
Blasphemy !!! JESUS IS KING
We stand with Jesus
Ban this movie
I love Lekeith Stanfield. He is awesome in every movie I've seen him in.
Blasphemy
I’m in
The hate here is secretly about the skin color of Jesus and the Jews being portrayed in this movie. If this were a Seth Rogan production, yall would be calling the man a genius.
Is Benedict Cumberbatch Jesus? 🤔
Who the f*** is Clarence?
Day one!
Won’t be seeing it but I can’t wait to see the reviews😂😂😂
While it's true people in the area were not Caucasian, suggesting that they were black is absolutely absurd... people get mad when anyone especially Jesus looks even slightly Caucasian, but make literally everyone including Jesus super black and that's not pushing a false narrative?   also was homie smoking a blunt at 1:17 ? lmao wtf
Bro wtf 😂😂😂😂😂 uhhhhhhh
Cant wait to see this movie
Everyone involved in making this movie is walking a DANGEROUS path. Repent or face the wrath that awaits !!!
I don't get the hate. It's like a telling of barr Jesus.
Disgusting trash of a movie
Who produced this movie.. BLM ? 😂😂. Smh.  This character is fake.
The Simpsons does a better job telling the truth
I’m just in disbelief and laughing. This is amazing.
I'm not sure what I just watched. 😂
Are we Blackwashing west Asians now!  I thought whitewashing Jesus was such an Issue but here we are!
So it's ok to mock God of the bible but not ok to mock Muhammad or Buddha
Wtf is this?
Y’all just touched the stove knowing it’s HOT. Get ready for God’s wrath! 🔥🔥🔥
I can’t wait for this movie to fail miserably
This is blasphemous garbage.
This is blasphemy!!!!!!!
The Biggest joke I have ever seen if I ever seen one what is wrong with y’all
First of all y’all den lost your mind if u thought this was cool to do
RATED SFF      ST*PID F*CKING F*LM
Movies like this will cause American people to become desensitized to persecuting Christians…
This is nothing but mockery.
Extremely offensive. God help us.
Repent and turn to Jesus all who are watching for he loves u very much, he died for u and the end is coming! STAY BLESSED STAY SAVED
I see why Hell hath enlarged herself...
I think I'll stick with The Chosen.
The blasphemy is sickening
Jesus the true king of king and lord of lords. You blaspheme our Lord
In jay z mind ALL blacks eithrr do, buy or sell drugs even 2000 years ago.
????
“Therefore I say to you, any sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven. Matthew 12:31
Not watching this movie its mocking god plus satanic sell jay z apart of the production dont no part of the devil agenda
it think yall mad they black
Interested in watching this
If it was accurate and biblical this would be a masterpiece, instead it's blasphemous! why can't anyone make  a movie with black actors and depict the TRUE story without their own rendition of it? I was looking forward to a version that, no offense, but wasn't "white-washed" then I come across this trash. God have mercy on their souls. Stick to the bible!!!
Jesus is king
This is the scenario we been talking about for years 🤣 “watch how the white people act when we get a movie where Jesus is black” Ya didn’t think it mattered when he was a hippie but now ya mad?
This is a mockery and blasphemous show of Christianity
1-12-2024  1= I God 1 son, first day, perfection  12= 12 Disciples 12 zodiacs 2024= 8  born again resurrection, new beginning fish.   I see he got the numbers hard with this one
This is movie isnt msking fun of Jesus it is poking fun at those who wanted jesus' influence and power and conned people into believing they were also prophets got way in over thier heads and suffred the consequences
I really hope that there's a special place in hell for America and all of it's people!!!
If Jesus ain’t real y won’t y’all stop talking abt him and mocking him?
the movie clearly shows Jesus and Clarence is trying to be like him by tricking people, he not pretending to be Jesus
Blasphemy
Blasphemous abominations. Blackwashing Cleopatra was not enough....the day of reckoning is coming.
Movie is such blasphemy against Jesus
“Bold new vision of a timeless story”  This is blasphemy straight up
Must see
These people are Heretics
Please do not watch this movie!  This man has no respect for God, Jesus, or the Holy Spirit. This movie will be straight up blasphemy. It will lead you astray.  If anything Jay-Z just wants to be his own “god” himself and I have met enough people in my life to know that a human should never be in charge….  Because the heart is deceitfully wicked and cruel. Professing to be wise they will serve images made to look like god. He is not served by human hands as if He needs anything. Rather He gives everyone life and breath and EVERYTHING💛. Turn to the only one that can save.  Remember John 3:16-18
If that was really Jesus he wouldn’t be THAT ugly
This is such blasphemy. We are definitely in the end times. Pray for the people who made this and the people who believe it.
The more religious movies the more world turmoil because everyone separately thinks their imaginary friend is the only one. Smh
So everyone is just okay with making a mockery of Jesus... got it.
1:17 Smokin that pack since the biblical days
Just an fyi Jesus wasn’t black or white. He wasn’t from Egypt he and people from Israel aren’t black either or white. Jesus look more like your clerk at the gas station
This is hilariously inaccurate 😆🤣
I checked the comments expecting to see angry crackers, but instead I see silly Christian’s making a lot of noise - as per usual- instead of focusing on their bible and daily lashes 😭
Jesus is and will always be King. Every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that He is Lord. Like in the days of Noah, they mocked, the jeered but the flood came and took them away. Again, every knee will bow and every knee will confess that He is indeed Lord
Blaspheme and evil movie this is, jesus was a jew, his followers were jewish, not black smh
Please don’t act like this is some revolutionary moment. This is bound to be filled with foolishness and subliminal messages. Why not just make a movie about Jesus accurately depicted as a black man?
Prince did not approve his song to be used in this movie.
It looks stupid.
So sad. Praying this doesn’t get released.
Repent
ALOT people🙄 are gonna have a problem with A Black Jesus but it’s historically Accurate & I can’t wait ❤to see it✊🏾👏🏾
Terrible. At the end of the day, God will get the last laugh!
Looks like they figured out that if they only spend a million making a movie, then they'll only lose a million in their box office flop.
Wow. Are we now mocking God?
Proverbs 14:9 (KJV) Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous [there is] favour.
THIS IS A MOCKERY OF YAHSHUA HAMASHIACH THAT'S WHAT DEMON'S LIKE JAY FLEA DOES.ANYTHING HE TOUCHES WILL BE SANTANIC AND THIS WILL BE NO DIFFERENT.PEOPLE WITHOUT ANY DISCERNMENT WILL FALL FOR THIS FOOLISHNESS 🤦🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️
In Jesus Christs name we pray amen.
Hello from India🇮🇳 Jesus wasn’t black lol
Nobody can take the place of almighty Jesus.
Jesus can return now this enough, Jay Z betta change before seeing hell
Blasphemy
Blasphemy!
oh Hollywood Maybe the blasphemy of the story will make you seek the truth.
“Played the cards that i was dealt” in jerusalem ad 33, REALLY???
This is going to be a classic. They already have my money
God can not be mocked , christians all over the world, remain strong in faith.
Okay so it's not right to mock the demons they openly worship,but the true lord and savior y'all just openly mock.... Repent. Jesus come quickly. I pray for everyone who think this is funny, your salvation is never funny. Someone literally getting beatened to death, than crucified should never be mocked or made a joke.
The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them; but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming. Psalms 37:12‭-‬13
💣 The ONLY Good Thing I SEE,  About This TRAILER Thus Far,       👇🏿  Is That,  The ISRAELITES/JUDEANS,  Are DEPICTED,  As They SHOULD BE ❗️🤔💭        👇🏾  With TRUTH  Comes EMBEDDED LIES
Love that remix of I Would Die 4 U by Prince, dude's my favorite!
Jesus is Lord & King
Why do you hate Jesus so much!!!!God be with all of you..
It's original, Strong Black cast, Strong concept, Decent enough budget to get it done, YES PLEASE!
Molto molto bello anche perché mi hai fatto partecipare alla preparazione. Non ho individuato Omar Sy, poi me lo rivedo, grazie.
Sooo basically, Clarence is the first person to try and slut out the beautiful Christian Faith for personal gain.. The Creflo Dollar, Eddie Long, Jamal Bryant of his time. Got it! Brilliant!
It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. Hebrews 10:31
We will all die at a point, leave behind the jets, lambos, libraries and mansions. It'l be a time to face God.
When they finally throw ninjas in a biblical movie its gotta be some blasphemy shit
Black film mocks religion  waste of money made i hate this film not out yet
This isn’t funny or cool this is sad. Stay prayed up you guys bc all entertainment isn’t just “entertainment” & yes it’s “that deep” Lord help us ! & forgive our sins 🥲
BLASPHEMY!!!!! Every knee will bow to the ALMIGHTY JESUS!! Lord save the lost, the confused, the devil is putting a spirit of chaos and confusion over everything. Let their eyes be open so they hear the trumpet when you sound them🥰
Galactic Law they have to tell you the truth in many ways  lol.
First a black mermaid and now this shit. Lol its like pandering to children.
The book of a drug dealer Jay Z
The book of Walmart Clearance
Well..Jay Z  sealed his fate 😂😂😂
Incoming flop!
How much did they pay for the Prince Song?.
Woooow smh
boycott!!!!!
Bet they won’t make a movie about Muslim
Now make a major movie about Jesus and have him look like he REALLY looked and not some white guy
more modern blasphemy ...
Is this a joke?
Straight garbage, it's a markery  and ripoff when black people play  people of the Bible! When the israelites are truly who we are!smh
Blasphemy!! Disgusting! 😡😡
EVEN THOUGH I AM ATHEIST I MUST SEE THIS MOVIE IT'S A MUST-SEE
Wow this is really the end times.
You know what else is crazy ..is that half of these people on here complaining will watch 1956 film The Ten Commandments with Charleston Heston and that story is fictional as well.. because of you wanna talk aboit the bible in Exodus Moses didn't meet Queen Nefertiti... and Sephora was his firsy wife and he then Moses married again.. theu made The Ten Commandments a love story actually with Moses being  a messenger of God to free his people... I never seen or  heard any backlash about that.. and Charleston Heston is a gun man... an evil gunmen 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
Why don't Hollywood ever make a movie about mocking Islam Buddhism.. The simple fact they keep mocking  Jesus is a testimony to his Truth.
You black Christians, black Conservative Christians, Conservative Christians, and bible thumpers are so annoying  .... it's just a film... what amazes is the same people who said that religious stuff be the same people doing some shady 💩 in their lives , like cheating, cursing, racist of course, anger and hate... like relax and stfu .. it's just a film...that was written... the whole point of writers is Creativity..which most of you hypocrites don't know anything about.. it will not harm or lose your iob or your damn religion so take a chill pill and stfu please smh 🤦
Book of Clarence? 😂
Revelation Chapter 22  18 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:  19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.
After watching this trailer courtesy of (JAY Z). I no longer detest CLEOPATRA courtesy of (JADA PINKETT) that much.  These is the most powerful blasphemous film I have seen all year. What an absolute mockery towards Christians.
I won’t be watching this blasphemy. We are truly the last days
Idk how i feel about this
Strange 💯🖤⏳
Yeah this a no dog
Too many people offended over a guy that's been dead for over 2,000 years.
Straight crap
Jayz is going to hell👹
2 Peter 3:3 playing out before your very eyes...
Slap him again
smfh
Looks like trying to be a comedy  Poking fun at the Bible and also trying to tell blax  that Jesus is nothing it was a whiat  world back then , and blax are being held back , even back then , but if you believe in your self that you can be a god and do god like things , your own way ,with any kind of bad habits you want to keep too   , because deep down you are good and can be perfect,   It’s also seem like they were sitting back hating on Jesus and wanting  to be him , and hated that he got attention, and they didn’t, and Clarence and his people feel like because their blax living in a whiat world , they not getting a fair shake
" NOW IS THE TIME TO BELIEVE IN JESUS "  Read Revelation 13:16-18 in your Bible Read Revelation 14:9-11 in your Bible Read Revelation 6:12-17 in your Bible  " A prayer to go to HEAVEN " Luke 23:42-43 kjv  Lord I am a sinner and I believe that JESUS died on the cross for my sins. Buried afterwards, the rose from the dead.  Read Romans 10:9-11 in your Bible  JESUS SAVES SINNERS PROJECT 1 Timothy 1:15 kjv  Time is running out ! JAMES 4:14 kjv
".. your eyes will be opened at soon as you eat it, and you will be like God.." (Genesis 3:5) This is the same lie that began in the Garden of Eden and continues to this day. This movie is Demonic Madness. They continue to mock Christianity. Why? Because Jesus is the only way.
Hoo boy... This movie is about to break all-time records for free advertising 🤣🤣🤣
So either this is "black-washing" or it's intended to be an alternate reality in which jews and peoples of the near/middle east were black?   Either way, I guess two wrongs make a right as long as you're on the "right side of history." *Sigh...
I JUST KNOW JESUS IS REAL BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH HATE HE GETS! You don’t hear about Buddha, Krishna, Mohammad NO ONE like you hear about JESUS! You all hate Him and it just proves His existence even more!!! The devil is a liar and the truth will be revealed soon. May God have mercy on this earth..
I'm in on this!!!movie must have some truth to it 🤓
Pray for everyone involved in the making of this movie 🥵
This is blasphemy 🚮🚮🚮🚮
Let’s see if this movie gets canceled 🙄.
This is Stupid,  Sub Saharan Africans in Israel....   yeah ok....
The Devil wanted to be like God too! He mimics the real thing
Black men are 16% more likely to spread an STD than any other race..strap up.
GUYS THIS DO NOT SUPPORT THIS! THIS IS COMPLETE BLASPHEMY! Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath! Exodus 20:4   CURSE WORDS AND COMEDY AND IN A MOVIE DEPICTING THE LIFE OF JESUS IS WRONG AND AGAINST THE BIBLE!
The only way they can show a truly accurate depiction of biblical times in a movie. Is to make it a comedy. The Real Jews are black
Simon the Sorcerer. Acts chapter 8.
So the story of a man that wants to take Jesus place sounds good to y’all? Blasphemy and crazy thing about it most of y’all that want to see it claim to be Christian
What blasphemy.  This should be boycotted.
do not forget we all have to answer to the almighty for our actions toy with the prophets all you want but the ones touched by the loving the giver the teacher no matter the race or religion  know what your doing and the creator will not let you win he has not given up on us but he has set hell fire aside for you may the most feared show you his might and you shall face the truth  you have disrespected Jesus/the believed prophet  enough
🤮👎
I can’t wait to watch it!!
This trailer reminds me of all of the fake pastors and people claiming to have light preaching nonsense about being holy but truly have an obsession with money, power and respect!
Blasphemous movie… SMH!
This man has been booked and busy but he’s playing such a crazy character. It’s kinda evil
I like how the Jews are black not middle eastern, or a mixing pot of ethnicities which it was… also Romans are all white ? Hmm not sly guys … great way to continue division and promote delusions. Soon they’ll  be saying the aliens are black too. Y’all need to stop looking into history to claim your identity and turn to Jesus. He will make you a son or daughter of the most high which is better then anything the world offers.
There was never any disciples named clarence these actors are marked for judgement by the Most high.
Jesus was Middle Eastern tho
A fictional movie made by jay z who promotes the Illuminati, has gotten away with at least 3 murders and is in tie with diabolical things, makes sense to make this crap
The actual Israelites of the Bible are so called negroes
Idc if this is used to later prove a point in the movie, the initial impact is disgusting. The blatant disrespect is despicable.
This trailer is freakin' wild
You gotta be kidding me
Y’all going to hell.
Wow this looks horrible!
this looks like basically black life of brian and im all in for it
Cringe
N-gg- please. Know your music since Reasonable Doubt. You do have life f'd up but that's because you want the here and now. The after is not on your to do list or you couldn't do my Jesus like this. He ain't Tyrone, Marcus, or Pookie. He's the King Of King and Lord Of Lord's. You've been poking the Bear for while now. Just know you literally begged for it. Peace and Love, because I do still love you. But this ain't it family.
Jebus of Wakanda 😂
This is going to be a religious movie that is more than these people can get their heads around.  I'm sure nobody has read in the description "and ultimately discovers that the redemptive power of belief may be his only way out"
Basically he went around performing false miracles for others to believe, there was only one true form of God and that Jesus. the satan yall pray to tried to mamaguy JESUS with bread on top of the mountain HE Created!!! WE ALREADY WON..TAKE YOUR BLASPHEMOUS THEATRE ARTS SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!
😂😂😂 lol this is the best part of the trailer 2:03
This movie should not have been made
Keep playing with the most high and his son ..
Blasphemy...  Psalm 2 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?  2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying,  3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.  4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.  5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.  6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.  7 I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.  8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.  9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.  10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.  11 Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.  12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
Absolutely ATROCIOUS!!!
This will be a waste of time and money; nothing more.
Even as a muslim this is disrespectful, Jesus PBUH was a noble man sent by ALLAH what kind of disrespect is this
The devil will never go after all these other 1000+ religions. Why? Because they’re all dead religions. The devil will only attack Jesus because it’s the truth and He’s real. That’s why you always see hollyweird, tv shows, celebrities etc openly diss Jesus & not any other gods. Anyways, repent & give your life to Jesus before it’s too late. Bible is unfolding right before your eyes.
I think some "Christians" here are being passive agressive for a very specific reason, I can't put my finger ☝🏿on it.
This movie is going to flop so hard at the box office. Not to mention, Yshua wasn’t black. He was Middle Eastern, likely having olive or light to tan skin color.
It’s been awhile since I’ve seen it but is this very close to Life of Brian?
oh wow amazing and accurate
Bruh this is giving me’Monty Python’s Life of Brian’ vibes 😂😂
I’m going to watch this because it will invoke a deeper conversation. I am excited to see the different perspectives on this movie.
Tell me you worship Satan without telling me. this is tragic but ive been saying, Satan been working on OT this century.
Listen to the crashing cymbals. None of you speak of love. None of you. Just a need to be right.
I'm so glad I'm white
Movie clip : "Knowledge is greater than belief" Bible: 1 Cor 1:27 But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
Trash
Samuel really watched Life of Brian once and said “hold my beer”
And this is yet again proof that Jesus exists . Being produced by a man who supports the marina abramovic . I RIBUKE IN JESUS NAME
Producer: Shawn Carter New Music By: Jay Z  Yeah, I’ll stay away from this satanic film.
Can’t wait to see this biblically accurate movie. Sad to see all of satans children in these comments
Can’t wait to see this biblically accurate movie. Sad to see all of satans children in these comments
Of course Jay-Z is involved and this takes place in "AD 33" = Masonic
Hell yeah. Can't wait to see people get mad about this.
The Book of Exodus 20:4-7 says:     4 “You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. 5 You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, 6 but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments. 7 “You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.  Recall the bible, as it's God's word, and read, see, do not only look but truly see the sin of man who attempts to make a fool of contents of the bible.   The book of Revelations 22:18-19 says:    18 I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this scroll. 19 And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are described in this scroll.  Jeremiah 51:18: The objects of mockery are worthless and will perish when their judgment comes.

Carve this upon your mind
Be careful, God knows all and mocking him is not something you want to do 🫢🙏🏼
Y’all worried about race and the color of someone skin??? What in the world is wrong with people? That’s all some of y’all got from this?? Omg I’m done with society.
DAS RITE!
Jay z said he don't even believe in the bible. What he doing touching this?
Disrespectful, maybe even blasphemous in the portrayal of Jesus.
I understand the dislikes, but you can tell this isn't taking itself too seriously, looks decent from a comedy prospective
Wow now that black people have money to make movies and cast black actors in these parts there is a shocking amount of people who think that's an issue. As if this hasn't been how Hollywood has been  since its birth. The race of the financer seems to make its way through the hiring. Capitalism baby don't you love it. Looks like go woke, maybe go broke, or you have enough money that these stupid arguments on the internet don't change anything lmao. Hey, there are classic movies you can watch as you say they are way better than what's being put out these days or pick yourself up by the bootstraps and go make some movies lmao.
YOU PEOPLE ARE SOMETHING ELSE
🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑
Lol we wuz Jesus and sheeeeeit
IF THIS BRINGS THE WORLD CLOSER TO JESUS,ITS A WIN. I was ready to dislike this BUT if in any way it can bring people closer to the Kingdom,it’s a win. A change from demonic Hollywood.
You can tell the racists didn’t even watch the trailer, just saw Black people and got mad.
If they believe the bible characters were black then how the hell do you go from the 12 disciples successfully spreading the word of God throughout the world to becoming slaves from 1AD 20th century? It was the whites who continued to spread christianity for as early as 1AD, and through that faith built the modern civilization, but somehow black wants to take credit? Im not even white but thats a fkin reach.
Blasphemous evil this is not of God. It is demonic and mocks our Christian faith. Jesus is the one who died for the sins of humanity and this is a mockery of Him…
Shouts out to Deacon Sicarii for breaking this trailer down using the bible to give us background on this Clearance character
Didn’t this say 33 ad?
The bots are going crazy on this video.. sooner or later the dislikes will overwhelm it.. it already has more dislikes than likes so far..
Every time i see the world make fun of Jesus it just make me laugh 😂😂😂 and make my faith soooo much stronger real Christians knows what im trying to say, i mean why keep making fun of something that not real right 😂😂
Who made this, black Hebrew Israelites?
At least It’s good to see that somebody finally got the ethnicity of the Israelites correct.
For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? (Mark 8:36-37)  There's 66 books in the Bible & Clarence ain't one of them. The audacity of the trashiest rapper to come out with this and anyone else who is in it will face GOD one day and have to give account of this, just like everyone of us has to give account for what we did. 😤😡
This ngl done went to far!
For people who claim not to believe in Jesus, they sure love to mock him and only him. You never see them doing this to any other religion or religious figure. I find that very telling. It makes me angry that Hollywood continues to mock and demean Jesus all while normalizing and popularizing Satan. I didn’t always believe in Jesus and I can only hope that others will come to change their minds like I did. Jay Z’s arrogance knows no bounds it seems. Repent and come to Jesus. He will forgive you and he loves you. This has to STOP!
Aka “book of a false messiah”
SM Intex Aqua music like Colony beautiful😂😂😂
We wuz jesus and shieeet
Did the people calling this blasphemous actually watch the same trailer?
Another mockery film
Little play on fake prophets with a little hilarity in it. From the trailer it looks pretty good, lets have fun with it. But I'm over the white Jesus shit, we know that man was white washed & looked more like an African. We were the first people on this earth to begin with, the dark skinned man, the African
They really  know who we are  the real Hebrew
God works in mysterious ways.
I hope this movie flops
One word. Blasphemy.
But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: 4 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light KJV — 2Corinthians 4:3 - KJV — 2Corinthians 4:4
Who can deliver you from the judgement of God? We all will have to stand before a Holy God with piercing eyes that knows our heart!
This looks like an SNL skit. I keep waiting for Kate McKinney to jump out dresses as Hillary Clinton.
It’s giving antichrist.
Isn’t this like cultural appropriation using sub Saharan Bantus to play semites.
BLASPHEMY
I see no movies Mocking Buddah. I see no movies mocking Muhammed.  But i find plenty mocking Yahushua
Lakeith of Hell carrying on like this friend!  Accept Jesus as the true words of his life.  He saves us friend!
Why is hollywood so afraid of Christianity? They cant stand the idea of us being right. I dont envy any of the people involved in this sad film, they are going to have a longer conversation with Jesus in the end than they should have had to.   A new take on a "Timeless story"... they spelled "True" wrong.
Can’t they move onto something else to mock instead of God? We get it, Hollywood hates God.
* You know when you see a Jeymes Samuel + Jay-Z movie the white people are going to play the ignorant villains. Datz racism!!! Lol
Blasphemy at its finest. Hell is real. Who ever stands behind’s this better Repent 😢
Blasphemy
Ask yourself this question why are they always mocking Christianity?   We are definitely living in the end times WAKE UP DON'T SUPPORT THIS MOVIE
Wtf is this 🗑?
i’m a simple man, i see lakeith stanfield i click. looks like a funny movie
I've always wanted to be in a movie like this no matter the part😂
God sits on his throne and laughs at the wicked. Man has but a short time on earth. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. God will NOT be mocked. Repent before it's too late
If you're a Christian, you really shouldn't support this movie. It's making a mockery of Jesus. It's just wrong.
Finally, a historically accurate Jesus. And it's not the Whitewashed version!   Ephesians 3:20-21- Glory belongs to God, whose power is at work in us  Don't be deceived by the right, preaching constant white propaganda!
“As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed.” ‭‭Galatians‬ ‭1‬:‭9‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
Bar-Jesus...
They're so desperate to mock Jesus unlike any other faith. They are only intimidated by the truth. Jesus is real. The blood of Jesus saves all from the pits of hell and gives them a new and beautiful spirit.
A bold new movie filled with heresy. LOL
Such a blasphemous film. The Lord surely has immeasurable mercy on the wicked.
As a a Muslim this film is mocking religion
God will not be mocked.
The way they depicted jesus is the total opposite of how he is depicted in the bible. Jesus did not have fly clothes looking dripped out lmao
Funny how they always filter the comments to always show the support comments as the top comments when there are literally over twice as many dislikes as likes. Get this blasphemous junk out of here.
People are bashing this movie already I’m gonna watch it & enjoy it
They will be destroyed for their ignorance 💥💥💥🩸🩸🩸
This seems super downgrading to black people. Thank God white ppl didn’t write it 🤣
To those who are spiritually blind this is just a movie. The Bible says 'Do not be deceived God can not be mocked'....
It really is hard to get a middle eastern Jesus.   I get woke culture,  i get why they gender bend and race swap. NOT to do justice but for catering.  HERE ME EVERYBODY, NO BLACK PERSON ASKED FOR THIS. 😂😂😂😂
I’m good on this …once again mfs don’t believe in God or Jesus then mock them every chance they get in music/movies …jay z & all of em God day of vengeance is coming ..have fun for now
Nicodemus
one of the most blasphemous movies i ever saw…. Sean Carter or whatever your real name is i pray for your soul to repent before ADONAI Tzva’ot comes against you and and your family…..
Notice how Jesus and all his followers are Black and all the soldiers and bad guys are White they're definitely trying to push an agenda here.
lol
anybody whos against this is religious lol we need a black representation of Jesus. If all this movie ever did was get you thinking that the real jews are black, then this movie did its job in my opinion. Yall can keep yall white Jesus, my Jesus is black. And its never a color thing when its a white Jesus but its a color thing when its a black jesus. Yeah.. make it make sense
Bro I hope this movie bombs at the box office because this is blasphemy
BHI: the movie. Going to go about as well as the Cleopatra "documentary."
THIS MOVIE IS A BIG HELL NO.
I'm getting tired of these Christian themed movies this one seems to be a black version of the story, makes it even more twisted.
Why I get the feels of  A Knights Tale
Y’all keep talking about blaspheming Jesus. Y’all need to do your on research. Jesus is an imposter. The church is an imposter. Read the Bible for yourselves. Return to YAH
I will not be seeing this movie.😡 What a mockery this is of the Word of God and the story of Jesus. A Black man claiming to be the new Messiah after Jesus' death and resurrection and ascension to Heaven, absurd and a sin in itself.
Jesus is King. Maranatha. Those of y'all that want to blaspheme will have to pay the price. Repent before it is too late...
NOPE
You should've made the Roman's Asian, now you're just racist
Where are all the white characters? Kinda racist, no?
Black excellence 😂😂😂😂😂
this is probably the most accurate cast hollywood ever put together for a biblical movie
Too bad Jesus wasn’t black. Darker skin sure, but not black. Also Jay-Z and Beyoncé are demonically possessed. Don’t watch this crap.
From slaves to gods...only in hollywood lmao
7k dislikes already lmao. This will be the next Female Ghostbusters flop.
this is a interesting movie, ill be looking forward to it just dont shoot up the movie theater when im there and you know who you are😅
At this point jay z is a moron smelling his own farts
more raceswapps keep putting kangs where they dont belong
More ninjas and more blasphemy thankyou sony
Absolutely not 😂 complete blasphemy. This world is over I don’t care anymore 😂🤦‍♂️
What in the blasphemous!
It's like a black Life of Brian... lol!
Clarence and the  black messiah
And on the 7th day god said “yo nah meeeeeen? They be axxing me where my son be and I just be like do I look like I’m the type that sticks around to raise my kids? Sheeeit that’s for baby momma earff!  ”
I’ll definitely be catching this one. Especially after ‘The Harder They Fall’
Love
Jerusalem, Nigeria
Definitely was a person like that back the no question.
This is a comedy, right? That’s what I’m feeling here.
It's a work of God since Jay-Hova is on the soundtrack
This movie is blasphemous why would anyone wanna watch such stupidity this is ridiculous… and people taking this as a joke
Strange this feels like that that story where a guy is broke and wants to be  famous. He sees the top celeb he  idolizes and copies him. Things go great until he hits rock bottom when find out he his a phony. Then his idol goes to him and tells him that his greed was lead to this and how he can be better, not just to everyone but to himself. Using the bible story of Jesus as the setting would make this old tale more impactful. Clarence may have be bitcg into oblivion before the movie's end before he realizes the: you dont have to be the Son of God to have a better life. If you have love in your heart then even this hateful world could not destroy you.  I doubt this movie would be ground breaking at all, but we just have to see.  In conclusion: Engage the cloaking device.
Samuel Jaymes and j-z movie making is a great team I want Miss    it for the world
Nah but if you think about it… there had to be mad “Clarence’s” in Jesus’ day! 😂
All I see is more cultural appropriation
Judas and the Black Messiah becomes literal.
This is interesting...
No thanks
I think I’ll skip this one 😂
This is a shot at Judaism, Christianity and black history/heritage.
Black Hebrew Israelites... This is the story of Frank Cherry and William Saunders Crowdy
Now this is original
0:00 - 0:05 stop showing us trailer previews at the beginning of a FCKNG trailer!!!!! down vote forever for this bullsht
How dare they this is blasphemy to the fullest
I as a disabled Christian don’t think this movie is woke, at all. Some Christian’s should use discernment when it comes to the woke agenda because not every type of representation is woke. It’s sad to see some Christian’s think that every type of representation  is woke by sayin representation doesn’t matter.  I’m just a white disabled Christian That has intellectual disability that thinks not everything is woke.    Just sayin cause Some of you guys are saying it’s woke  movie when you guys watch the tv show called the chosen which is full of christian representation and representation in general. I don’t watch the show and i’m not interested in the show, but I respect other Christians that like the show, but I noticed that Christians that say that representation doesn’t  matter are the ones that watch the chosen when it’s full of christian representation.
The industry can never let Jesus go, they always have to find a way to mock or blaspheme Jesus
Those barbers in AD33 do nice line ups.
They watched the Chosen and said what if we do it this way.  And I'm game for it, genuinely excited to see this
So Jerusalem is in Africa now? ....hmmm...
Some woke nonsense. The Jews were not black and Jesus wasn’t black either bruh. I like the concept of the movie, but what’s up with the misrepresentation. Have they not learned from the cleopatra situation 🤦🏾‍♂️.
How is this supposed to bastardize Christianity? The movie is about someone who sees the real Jesus, decided to become a false prophet because of greed, and I assume goes through some character development and realize his wrong doings. All the comments I see here are just overly sensitive or just straight up racist
FINALLY BLK PPL IN A BIBLICAL MOVIE AND YES JESUS WAS A BLACK MAN 👍🏾✊🏽
We wuz jezus n shit
We wuz messiah n shiett
🔥🔥🔥
We wuz kangz an sheeeit.
As a non-believer, I hate this.
Middle finger extended.
Boycotting
I'm not a prophet,  but white conservatives and the  sell out 🦝 that shuck and jive to that tune are finna be big mad...its going to be hilarious.
So the Jews in Hollywood are up to it again.
"This guy is Jesus? His real name is Clarence"
Fucking cringe  When are they doing MLK movie with a white or Latino guy?
Now make one where Moses or Abraham are black. And don't forget to trivialize them with comparisons to popstars and the likes.
seeing all the christians be mad at this is hilarious, showed they didnt watch the trailer
No thanks on the black Jesus
so stupid!
Blasphemy of basic of Anthropology. Palestine is not Sub-Sahara
Enimem should be the devil and Dr.dre as god and at the end they should announced their new collab album called the flood
Not going to lie to you. Ppl Don’t be deceived. Just do research n see who’s producing this. Blasphemy and mockery comes in many forms.
Dey tranaa hidin dis shii from blakpipo fr
This is one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen. Hollywood needs to do something different than these black “woke” movies, it’s cheesy and cliche
what is this...
Basically a black Life of Brian!
This film is COMPLETELY blasphemous.
Christians dissing Christianity again I see.
Finally someone is depicting Israelites how they actually looked.  Not Charleton Hestor 😂
Why don’t they make fun of Islam instead Christianity ?
The original inhabitants of the geographical region known as the Holy Land had dark skin before groups known as the Sea Peoples invaded the area. After this invasion occurred, there were intentional efforts to distort and misrepresent the historical record in order to portray these original inhabitants as white, rather than as the black people they actually were. The true history was covered up and falsified.
Hopefully people will FINALLY get the point.....👀👀👀👀
Ok.  They had me with Prince!
They actually can’t make a movie without blasphemy. Incredible
I ain't even mad. I'm just... numb to this bullshit
Totally relatable considering the growing numbers of false pastors and preachers.😅
This looks hilariously amazing! I can't wait!
So he'll actually walk on water , the end
at first they was like o the christian’s gone be mad 😡 😂 now i see it’s only white ppl 😅
God so loved the world that he gave us a scammer…….
Would this movie be made involving Islam rather than Christianity? It's always hollypedoweirdland poking at Christians rather than ny other religious group.
WE WUZ JUICE N SHIET
Jay Has his Favorite Actors don't he lol. I'm definitely tuned in 💯💯💯🖤✔️
How did a Black Hebrew Israelite movie with heavy, “black people were the real Jews, not those imposters in Israel” vibes get green lit in Hollywood
Wow, you guys REALLY ran out of ideas for movies 💩
What is this, a comedy? Felt like I was watching just that.
👑
stupid hollywood,dont make a black version out of everything,IT DOES NOT WORK
Lol this is the life of Brian without the clever historical commentary
We wuz sand people n shieeet.
Black Satires are lit asf
Larry Fink must be rubbing his claw hands. BlackRock/Vangard/OpenSociety/ESG etc... is a real poison, people must be aware of where all of this shit comes from. Spread the word and point out the enemy.
Best movie of the decade !!  Black & brown pride Fr fr
Let me guess, everyone is black except for the Romans, and the Romans are portrayed as tyrannical.
I'm down as long as its not blasphemy and mockery of Jesus. That is going to a major let-down and so damn disrespectful if it is... Because its got a great cast... Always have loved David Oyelowo & LaKeith Stanfield has become one of my fav newish actors (also really like RJ Cyler... absolutely loved them in "The Harder They Fall".) Soooo hopefully its going to be good and not trashy.
I cried when God himself came down and declared with a thundering voice: WAKANDA FOREVER!
They getting real disrespectful nowadays 😢
We wuz da son of god n shieeet
PRINCE song Was perfect for this movie
GOD help us SMH
When did we become so soft? Specially men. Bro chill, it's a satire
why are they african?
Can’t wait to not watch this massive turd.
THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS MOVIE, IS TO POINT OUT THE TRUE PEOPLE OF THE BIBLE ARE NEGROES‼️
I love made-up, completely fictional stories with completely inaccurate people for the time they are depicting. I can't wait to never watch this.
BLACK SUPREMACIST JAY-Z / LAY-Z IS INVOLVED????? COUNT ME OUT.  NO THANKS.
WE
Wait is bro smoking the za? 😂😭 WTF
CRINGE
we wuz jeezus
Pretty sure Palestine didn't look like sub-saharan Africa in terms of demographics back in AD 33.
Does he turn water into Hennessy?
at least they got the real j3w$ in Jerusalem, seem like its going to be a good film
What are all these n doing here?
The world has lost its mind, because they made Hollywood (the baby sacrificing, human trafficking, pedophilic, greedy, immortal, debased, debauched), Babylonians their gods who literally hate us and couldn't care less about us.   They cn Blaspheme the Christian God, but everyone else gets a pass. Then they worship every mass unaliving, vile ,evil, hateful, gods and goddesses in the Bible, rhen tell us that Jesus isn't real. Well, if He isn't real, why soend so much of your time hating Him and mocking Him, and letting every other reliiand their gods slide?   Anyway... I'm not looking for a trite conversation, so don't worry about responding to my comment. I don't check them.
Make fun of muslim religion like this not only Christianity.
There's no way there were so many Sub Saharan black people in Nort Africa. Yet another race swap movie and mockery of Christianity. When can we mock and make jokes about Jews, Muslims or Hinduists without receiving death threats or being canceled while mocking and making jokes about the Christians and christian traditions is a trend and completely normal today?
WE WUZZZZZZZ.......
Along with the Egyptians, congratulations to the Jews! The blacks have taken your history and culture.
Jay z got Old and to Racist
This is demonic!
Movie looks terrible nobody is interested in this …only people who is gonna watch this is blacks people
Bullshit
Why doesn't Sony make a movie about the life of Muhammad portraying him as a black man?
How did these sub-saharan Africans make it to Israel when they hadn't even invented the wheel or written language by the time Europeans arrived?  This is not only blasphemous but deeply Marxist revisionary history meant to destroy people's faith in the Christian religion.
Disgusting tbh with ya. Disrespectful
if that rockefeller rat jay-z cared about blk he be feeding homeless blk ppl
Americans are so silly
LIGHTEN UP People!!! Sheesh
Heretic bullshit trying to spin real life events as just a "story" that they can change how they want.
So the Israelites were black?
Re-writing history is what they want to capitalize on. Don't give them your money.
So it's a story about a conman  pretending to do miracles during Jesus times is what I got from the trailer
This is antisemitism
We wuz Jesus'n shieet
💜🕊️ cant wait !!!
I hate how everybody got shakeup linings like they had clippers smh
More garbage
A movie is a movie, dont try to find any inner justification, have fun with it
Cool... another cook out movie.
I am so happy Omar Sy and James McAvoy to see in this!!!
bixnod muh fuggah
Jesus, everyone here is being a Karen or Ken, eh? Well I got one thing to say, that's like your opinion, man...  Following the Way of The Dude
BLASPHEMY
EPIC
I like how this film and the Director’s last film is entirely full black casts and the only white people are bad guys, and it’s written and produced by a team of only black people. If another race did this they’re canceled. 😂
Une belle chiasse américaine.  Pauvre Jésus, pauvre Prince aussi.
Раб божий) a slave of god
we b jezuz n shiet
all the niggas in one frame.
WE WUZ JUICE N STUFF
Another Token
Bruh wtf is this???
If you know the word this is about Simon the sorcerer......but you would know that if you read the word.
Read about this film a while ago and was excited about the plot but the set design, cinematography, costume and color grading looks weak af unless it's by design
You can’t tell me that Hollywood and the politicians aren’t doing their best to get everyone in a race war and get us focused on dumb shit. They just do this race bait shit to waste our times. lol.
In a dark cave, Jesus is your flashlight. Because he is the way, the truth, and the life, he will lead the way. All your worries will remain, as you are still in the dark cave, but his love for you will shine brightly!
No thanks
2.4 million views, 2,000 likes. 😂 Wtf? It’s also funny that I don’t see any reactions on YouTube for it like other movie trailers. People afraid to get canceled?
The days are coming when they shall mock and say "where is this second coming" ? For since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as normal. They intentionally forget that the world was once flooded
Racebending every character to be black is the perfect recipe for a box office bomb. There needs to be a name for this kind of genre so I can avoid it like the plague
Galatians 6:7 7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
Some people will have a problem with the simple fact of Jesus and the people all around him at the time we’re predominantly black.  The truth can be a hard thing to swallow after a lie has been perpetrated for a few hundred years
2.4 million views and only 2100 likes as of 08/30/23 at 2:45 am eastern. The hate is strong against this one. That can only mean one thing................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................I FULLY SUPPORT THIS MOVIE!
Lakeith Stanfiels, Rj Cyler, Caleb McLaughlin, Teyana Taylor, James FREAKING Macavoy!!!! The cast list alone is enought o get me hype!
*the rise of the AntiChrist*
WE WUZ
Luke 20:46 “Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;”
Das rite, Finally we can see history accurate Jesus, not that one which Ukrainian bigots were feeding us.
Judas had to signal who Jesus was because every person in the place looked Roman. Jesus was Roman. Deal with it.
Blasphemy!  The early life section is strong with this one
If Jesus came to this world to spread the love - then Sony came to this world to spread some hate.. and what a good job they're doing !
Ah yes, the egyptian history has been succesfully stolen now lets do the levant. "bold new vision" ok buddy...
We wuz jews n shiet
WE WUZ JEEZUS AN SHEEEIT
Blasphemy
Why dont they ever disrespect the great Muhammad? Oh right because Muslims dont play that ish.
Reel State was here.
Why you don’t do this in Muslim culture like act black Mohamed and shit
Maranatha! Pure blasphemy. He’ll be back soon.
Hmmmm
I am so watching this 😂
Finally. A biblical movie with the proper depictions of the people of the book. Prince of Egypt is up there too
Blasphemous Hollywood strikes again
WE WUZ HEBREWS N SHEIT
This is a joke, yeah?
This about to be the best movie ever made!
If this film was majority yt actors nobody would say anything smh y’all brainwashed whatever higher power there is damn show wasn’t a yt 😂🤣
This is blasphemy
GARUANTEE MULTIPLE PPL DIE OR GET HURT THAT HELPED MAKE THIS MOVIE!
RESPEKT FÜR DAS THEMA!! Alles Fake💩 und nur Geldmacherei!! Märchen mit Verblödete und SPENDENREICHE Hirnis!! #🖕jesus+kirche+etc💩
now they are tryin to make us racist
Came here hoping they'd have the guts to show Jesus as black. I was disappointed they covered his face.  Then they showed his hands. 😊❤ Can't wait!
Is this Atlanta a few thousand years ago?
I like this but I have a feeling this has far more dislikes than likes.
There’s definitely a space for a movie like this, about copycats and false prophets during and after Jesus’ ministry. Just not sure this is it. Read that religion is “a backdrop” and if that’s true the setting was a poor choice
"there is no agenda, you're just a conspiracy theorist"
Why are they all black???? lmfao
Will someone make a mistborn tv series
@sicarii wtf is this???
Plot twist: Jesus is played by Kanye
This world is a mess like seriously you don’t see Hollywood poke fun at any other religion people really think God is a joke
Can't be blasphemous if god doesn't exist. Lakeith is from my hometown, so I'm supporting despite it's overrated tertiary character.
Looks aweful comments seem full of bots
Can’t wait !
I have, concerns...
Movie should of dropped on netflix
What is this bullshit ?
a movie with an underlying theme about churches and pastors and how the world has attempted to change the faith of ppl . I’m in 🙂
*lul... and people still consume this*
And Jay-Z being involved tells me all i need to know, Illuminati trash 🗑️
This is disgusting, it’s blasphemous, biblically and historically inaccurate, and it’s just plain irresponsible! I will not be supporting this filth!
It should be more serious if it’s biblical they should have the story like he wanna seek or find out who Jesus is.. it’s a low key black Christian comedy but you can’t play with GOD remember skin color matters in this world
This should not be released at a time when writers ask for more money.
What in  Black-Hebrew-Israelites is this? Looks like a good fictional film 😊😊😊😊
Y’all keep Mocking GOD.  I’ll pass!!!!
So we're just going to make a mockery of Prince
Black people go from one system of control to the next lol. Let me guess next the Vikings will be black. We wuz Kangs n sheet lol. At least make the Romans black weirdos. Lol
Well Mall of America theaters here I come and I can hardly wait for opening day✊🏿💯
Why does homie have a blunt in his mouth 2:03 into the trailer 😅?
We wuz the messiah n shiett
Complete garbage. But go ahead and do a movie mocking Islam.
Finally showing how the real people of the Bible look
The industry can never leave Jesus alone they always have to find a way to mock or blaspheme him just goes to show you How real he is
Alright now J and all is well! Let's go! 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Jesus came from the line of the Jews, this is blasphemous.
We wuz the son of God and shit.
Man we have truly entered a phase of 'we wuzzary' the likes of which we haven't seen before 😂
This is a certified Black Hebrew Israelite classic
>"bold new vision" >they were black actually  every time
dna evidence from copper age Israel 6500 years ago done by Harvard already found most samples had light skin and many even had blue eyes, light skin evolved in near East not Europe   “Ancient DNA from Chalcolithic Israel reveals the role of population mixture in cultural transformation”  “We highlight three findings of interest. First, an allele (G) at rs12913832 near the OCA2 gene, with a proven association to blue eye color in individuals of European descent40, has an estimated alternative allele frequency of 49% in the Levant_ChL population, suggesting that the blue-eyed phenotype was common in the Levant_ChL.  Second, an allele at rs1426654 in the SLC24A5 gene which is one of the most important determinants of light pigmentation in West Eurasians41 is fixed for the derived allele (A) in the Levant_ChL population suggesting that a light skinned phenotype may have been common in this population”  Look up dura Europas Jewish frescoes roman era, not a single one has dark skin 😂  Look up oldest Ethiopian bible art, they clearly depicted jews as white   Look up Egyptian tile art of foreigners again near East is clearly lighter than Egypt and Nubian
Absolutely stupid, black people need to learn how to do research the Name Clarence wasnt invented till 1360’s, years after this🤦🏻‍♂️ great movie portraying black folks scamming people since forever great idea😳🤦🏻‍♂️🤡🤡
Ancestor cry
It looks like a jibe at modern so-called religious figureheads that exploits the teachings and ideology and gets rich off of religion. The Christians who are calling this blasphemous clearly don't get the theme and message the movie is trying to convey. These same people are the ones listening to the preachings of these millionaire "Preachers".
About time people knows that Jesus wasn’t white
Another💩from Sony.
Can’t wait to see this its about time somebody black put they money towards some shi these folks gave us and showed us as the people ✌🏾
I can't wait!!!!!!!!
Looks Great, Funny. Not big on Religious Movies. Love this cast( LAKEITH, RJ, JAMES, ETC), Loved The Harder They Fall. Can't wait.
*PATHETIC.*
Every time there's a black movie like this, SOME white people totally misunderstand the genre and start issuing one-dimensional, predictable and rather thoughtless complaints. The cast members of the comedy classic Life of Brian were all Europeans with British accents playing 1st century Middle Easterners. Any complaints from the white anti-SJW/"go woke go broke" types? Not a peep. I wonder why? Do these critics pause to think that the director, undoubtedly a movie buff, is inspired by Life of Brian? Do they interpret the significance of the movie for the writer/director in light of this very real possibility? What about how this teaser trailer already shows that one theme is the way preachers, white and black, pimp the Gospel and con the gullible for fame and profit. Might the director want to get his audience, white and especially black, to think about the negative consequences these preachers have on their community? And before you say, a movie shouldn't have a pertinent critical message, how is this critique of a religious huckster not in the tradition of a beautiful  movies (with an all-white cast) like Elmer Gantry (1960)? These white anti-SJW movie critics and their black imitators don't know how to analyze movies and are so intellectually weak, it's embarrassing.
Looks like culture appropriation to me.
I thought this would be a typical movie that’s being pushed in 2023 if you know what I mean, but I actually like this take.
The blasphemy is absolutely insane
Is this a comedy? 🤨
Can you stop casting baboons as humans please?
What happened to all the middle eastern people?
Holy shhhh😂
Feet like brass is closer to being brown than white. 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
❤️ ❤️❤️❤️❤️.  I’m there
The movie appears to be visually appealing and aesthetically pleasing.
Woke !!!!!
I finally understand why the muslims chimp out. This is utterly vile.
Good news, I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word (Jesus) and believes Him who sent Me (God) has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life. John 5:24 Jesus died for you, all you have to do is believe & repent
No one told me they were in Judea too
A Nubian Jesus.. going for factual events this time eh 😂
So doesn’t The Good Book say.. and I quote “Be Jesus Like?”😂
the troll/ anti woke comments are honestly so high school its kinda disappointing 💀💀 but excited for this movie i was wondering if itd be more serious or not but happy its going with a more comedic vibe
Black-washing Middle Eastern history... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bruh this blasphemy—
Rewriting history to fit a narrative is truly garbage.
Hell Is Hot
Blasphemous!
Lord help us with this Blasphemy 🦶🙏
Black Hebrews indeed, das right.
I can’t front, This shit looks goofy 😂  Like a made for TV film
Imagine If there was a white Jesus....nvm bad example
Us Christians must ban together and not allow this Woke filth in our homes. There's only one God and Lord Trump!  Now let's go Brandon! You're gonna be late for school.  Trump2024ever
I JUST GOT TO SAY JESUS WASNT BLACK NORE WAS HE WHITE ...IM NOT BEING RACIST BUT HE SIMPLY WASNT AND HE WAS TANNED WITH WAVY HAIR ..I JUST WISH PEOPLE WOULD GET THEIR FACTS STRAIGHT..
looks epic. dope trauker
And I thought Netflixs Cleopatra looked awful....
Wow Hollywood is finally telling us the truth.
Blasphemy
Why is it ok to swap black people in over middle eastern people?
🔥
wow lol more small hat funded Afrocentrism   Jesus spent 22 years in his Niger-Congo homeland before returning to the Holy Land
Oh what a surprise Jay Z is on the soundtrack to this blasphemous trash
Ted Kaczynski was right
He better b black 😂😂
Black people have no culture.
This is why when someone tells me about god I ask them not to quote movies. People claim that the Bible is false yet they quote and believe Hollywood movies. It’s truly sad to see how easily people are deceived. Please don’t believe everything you see and hear on tv.
It's all so tiresome
“Blasphemous, BOLD and BLACK ” Glad to see an accurate depiction of the messiah and his people as well as a nice side quest story.
Finally they're telling the truth
Blasphemous movie.
Black skin good white skin bad.....the movie.
Movies like this are long overdue especially among the black communities in America. Keep it up! Do more like this!!!! All power to the people!! All day
Finally a black Messiah!
Prince is rolling in his grave that they would blasphemously use his song… 🙄
Wtf happened to cinema 😭😭
somehow Sony Pictures always knows just how to make everything a little worse than they could be.
jews won’t like this lol. Blackwashing is turning on them now…
To all the Anti-Afrocentrics that will comment and be upset at a all black cast in a biblically influenced movie. Only idiots believe that multiracial societies never existed in west Asia and all over the Mediterranean. You're not a idiot are you😂
There were no black Africans in Jerusalem 2000 years ago. The Israelites were never black Africans. This entire myth is a product of the deranged state of black American psychology and the Antichrist Jays in Hollyweird love capitalizing off of their easily influenced black lapdogs to continue their never ending demonic war against the Messiah they murdered
I'm interested. I kinda see it as a look a the disingenuous spiritual leaders, but that's just my opinion.
Vai flopar com força!
Yikes! Who green Lite this? Its got high school film project vibes.
Why is everybody black? Not a diverse movie, also misrepresenting how jews look, movie should be boycotted and producers arrested for hate speech.
Thanks again, Prince.
Jaymes Samuel... keep your eye on this guy.  👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
This should piss Christians off
bogus.
I can’t take it anymore
LaKeith  on his bag
Life is war, apparently praying & having faith doesn't do much.. the globalist still in power of our home. Fuk the movies im ready for action...TBR 😂💯
This seems… very inappropriate in many many ways.
I don't understand what this is trying to tell me. It's a movie, yeah, but is it a parody or a retranslation?
Money on Cumberbatch being either Jesus or the voice of God.
Finally a realistic depiction of jesus
This is either going to be top class, or just shit. The topic doesn’t give room for middle of the road.
Looks great. I love that LaKeith Stanfield is becoming such a mark of quality. I’m much more likely to see anything if he’s in it.
BLASPHEMY BLASPHEMY BLASPHEMY..........ITS LIKE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GO TO HELL
Your budget and music choice have drawn me in.
Ayo???????????????
I hope he bumps into Brian at some point 😂
Yeah the truth is out Yeshua was a black man king of the Jews we are the Hebrew Israelites Jews All praise Yahweh the God of Israel and Israel is in Africa
Great Prince song 💜🕊
I'm ready for this
This look likes it’s trying to make a mockery of Christians the devil Jay Z is behind this so no figure complete and utter blasphemy. They laugh here on earth but my Lord will have the last laugh on judgement day.
I’m sorry why are they making fun of this movie.I will not be watching this movie at all 🤦🏻‍♂️.Never mock Jesus‼️
So everyone race swapped apart from the bad guys. Who are still white. 😂 ridiculous
It looks like it shaped around when Simon in the Bible asked after seeing the apostles power could he buy the anointing
Very hard pass.
Don’t watch this movie
Skating on thin ice….. God is not to be Mocked..
Watch how THEY are going to try to stop this movie from coming out by labeling it “anti-semitic”!
This world is doomed
Just mocking god at this point
Ayo this is your Life of Brian for tonight, zoomers.
All Christians should just accept that --- 1:26
WE
White people about to be pissed. Oh and 🦝s also😂😂😂
"Everyone who ever existed was originally Black!" It just never ends, does it?
This is blasphemy of the highest order.
More Anti Christian Joooish propaganda remember they hate Jesus
Wtf is this 😅😅
This is probably what Jesus did, if he actually did exist. It was probably a thing people did back in the day. It’s something we still do now on social media.
Present 6 hours
Lakeith and RJ IN ANOTHER MOVIE TOGETHER I LIKE It
Despite them putting some accuracy finally to the people of Israel....they will throw something in there to throw you back off...let's see
Revelation 1:14 His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; Revelation 1:15 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.  Jesus is black, and so are the Israelites! If you have a problem with that it is because God has not revealed the truth to you, and you are his enemy! You hate his people but love him? Jesus looks just like his Father In Heaven! 🤷🏾‍♂️
wocka wocka lmao
So disrespectful, I pray y’all stop mocking GOD. 😮
I'm gonna be in the theater laffN 😂😂😂
A mockery!
Hard pass!
Okay, imma take a stab at this.  Looks like Jesus is already there, and Clarence wants to be like Jesus for his own selfish reasons.  At least that's what i took from it. Perhaps it's not something that's blasphemous, but rather a take on the dangers of being selfish and the "wolves in sheeps clothing"
Oh damn i see angry religious people i mean they don't know how to have fun anyway
❤❤… whoever is reading this … WE Love you … keep going !!!!
🤦🏽‍♂️
Cant wait to watch this
We wuz Jews & Arabs. 😂😅😂😅
I am confused :D But I need to see it :D
shiiiieeetttttt....we wuz kangz 😂
I’m interested becuase it takes place during the biblical times. According to vanity fair, the movie is about  a man who attempts to became one or the messiahs apostles.
i want to watch gran turismo my birthday August 31 AMC Hiram 14
This is so blasphemes it's disgusting. Shame on anybody who had any part in this🤦‍♂
Why do Americans keep rewriting history? Do Arabs no exist?
PURE MADNESS
Can't wait for this one 😂
After seeing Sorry to Bother You, I can't take anything with LaKeith Stanfield seriously 🐴
Looks very good. Very funny too.
Saw this as an ad.
👍🏾👍🏾 can’t wait
Not funny
Hollywood loves to make light of Christianity, but never any other religions! 🤔
me and the homies shall be there
Very interesting
Do haircuts like that existed back then?
I wonder how the FAR FAR FAR OVERT RELIGIOUS RIGHT will view this movie if at all 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jerusalem, the famous capital of Ivory Cost, full of black israelian in 33
This movies shows who are the real Jews are in the Bible
My boy lakeith
Eminem dissed so hard Clarence on 8 mile that he restarted his life
Come through Lakeith❤️ beautiful cast👏🏽👏🏽
Ohhhh this looks good, and VISUALLY ACCURATE.
Low-key offensive. But it tracks for Hollyweird.
Blasphemy against Jesus and the apostles.  Blasphemy against the bible.  A common and sinful man says that he is the messiah ??  How crazy to want to be Jesus.
I only got one question where is Benedict cumberbatch character
So is this a comedy?
Of course the baddies are white
Whats da name of Dat song it fits da lords sacrifice for us
The concept of replacing an entire race, but keeping the baddies as white, is interesting. Let's see how it plays out with audience lol.
God is not mocked
Interesting... definitely a great cast....but I hope they don't go too far with this story, Surrounded by the times of Jesus, they have a fine line to walk before going too far. It is good to see a film with this cast and budget being made around this time frame.
Stop playing with god
It's a good cast... but why is every evil or character with evil intentions mostly white...? 🤔
A story based on fiction and fantasy, lmao!
Black Hur
Lmao they both were in The Harder They Fall
whenever james mcavoy plays a villain, world population increases
A black Jesus ohhh thee uproar that’s about to happen lol but may we open our cinemas to season 1 episode 2 February 15, 1974 “Good Times” Black Jesus lol
SO watching this!!!!
Jesus loves you🩷
Judas and the black messiah part 2
So many people on Facebook are  criticizing this movie already 🤣🤣🤣
Where are the Jewish characters
Yeah yall can keep this. God is not mocked💯
Black Jesus, really. Dark skin like Middle Eastern but not African. This is token bullshjt
This looks awful
Who is playing Jesus? they got the color right this time 😅
"I want to be like that in ten years" 🤣🤣 Don't know why that made me laugh. 🤔
The Harder They Fall was trash and this looks like trash. Jay-Z producing this is a joke when you consider his wife is a witch, he's tight with Marina Abramovich and has a song called Lucifer. Lakeith Stanfield needs to choose better projects.
*Afrocentric revisionism is an affront on history. Africans did not exist in large numbers outside of the Niger Congo region until very recently. Bronze Age haplogroups are entirely Eurasian as opposed to Black African*
This looks amazing 😂
BLASPHEMING
Lakeith Standfield = Great Movie
Lakeith is a STAR
the movie is gonna be released in 4k why the hell is the trailer only in HD wake up it's 2023 Sony
This is not absolutely NOT how Jesus acted....NOPE
People here dont know what a comedy looks like.
I had no idea that there were this many Sub Saharan blacks in Jerusalem at that time. LOL
Love the choice of music for the trailer.
Ayo, Caleb McLaughlin?
The Book Of Clarence ensemble cast is fantastic!
Merapu
First Cleopatra and now this. Are we gonna get a movie about Richard the Lionheart starring Michael B. Jordan next?
Wow so mock Christianity ..please tell me this is some sort of parody and not to be taken serious....and wtf Prince music ....I'm sorry this looks numb
ANNA DIOP LETS GOOOOO
Perfect casting of my new Black Jesus Clarence!!
This is the Jesus movie I was waiting for. Take all my money.
❤
Damn 1:39  😂😂😂😂
It’s so goofy when trailers start with “trailer starts now” yeah no shit I clicked on the video 😂😂😂😂😂
The Book of Ghetto
This basically confirms that’s Benedict Cumberbatch is playing Jesus right? I’m all for it
you guys are mocking Jesus ehh
Is this a parody , ? Looks like a joke
Hmmm...movie mocking the creator..hard no and hard pass
Like 👍🏻 if you think 2024 will be a great year cause venom 3 is coming
Lakeith is such a fun actor to see pop up in movies
This looks like a monty python rip off
Can someone tell me why is Tristar pictures bylineless
PRINCE 👁️ WOULD DIE 4 U
Me waiting for the conservatives to cry about Jesus being black?
Custom Music created by us here at 3db Music. Thanks for bringing us along on this one!
Sighhhh
Witness a bold new vision of story 2024
This is a joke right? Like a spoof movie
The real Judas and the Black Messiah
So this movie has black and white people living in Jerusalem but no actual brown people lol I'm curious to see the response to this from the people who want historical accuracy rather than token rewriting of history.
I wana watch this now !!!!😂
I'm a believer alredy.😊
In related news, Prince Rogers Nelson just rolled over in his grave.
They are faking God also.
Well Sony, that's one way to do charity I guess...
Liked this one
Oh, I'm going to wait for the backlash now. 3, 2, 1 ......
Sony you are warned . God is not mocked . Whatever you sow you shall reap.
This is satanic
What is this nonsense???

BLASPHEMY !!!

டோரா💁‍♀️ புஜ்ஜி🐒  சார்பாக படம் வெற்றி பெற வாழ்த்துக்கள்🎉🎉🎉🎉🥳🥳🥳
Jeymes Samuel really owned on his debut feature, The Harder They Fall. Looks like he's gonna own this movie too. Lakeith is always a win.
ohhh black people??? Original idea 🎉
