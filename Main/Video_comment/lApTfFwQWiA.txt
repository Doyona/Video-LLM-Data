This has to be the most beautiful and bittersweet song about wankin' that I've ever heard.
I told you I like you and unfortunately as usual my thoughts of you seem to cover the bad parts of you. Can I just be loved? I'm tired of waiting
please please play this on your next tour in the roundhouse it means a lot to me :>
God this song popped up in my head and I scoured my favorite songs playlist for it
this feels like being carried to the car
i hope this gets released properly one day its too good
Lyrics nice tune no good
I need to know what type of guitar makes this bass sound
I love all of the wonderful people who have put the way this song makes me feel in the comments. However, I cannot ignore the bedding. I NEED THE KITTY PRINT BEDDING. I MUST HAVE IT. Can you please tell me where it's from? PLS <3
YES FINALLY a song about masturbation, lesbianism, and desire   THE TRIFECTA!
NEED THIS SONG OUTTT
dodie i ugly sobbed to this song and overanalyzed it in my head and it's about WANKING HELP edit: can we re-title this song "crywank"
I always come back to this beautiful song, It's just so soothing for me.
came back to listen to this at 4 am while thoughts of my LETHAL crush consume my brain
does anyone think of their comfort character/person while listening to this or am i just that mentally ill <3
This might be my favorite dodie song, I keep coming back to it
This song to me feels like the pure distilled feeling of closing your eyes, and fantasising, but not about sexy fun times but just about being there with someone, existing side by side with someone and not needing anything else. It's beautiful
alright this video seems old enough now that it would safe to comment a dump of ~emotions~ so...    There's something about this song that makes me long for a connected relationship between sexual and romantic feelings. Sure, I've felt both towards people but when it comes to *ahem* alone time it feels so animalistic in the moment and gross afterwards. I genuinely cannot imagine feeling romantic while having sex. I think I'd just feel focused on the caveman brain of things feeling good so then and it wouldn't feel affectionate or bonded to the other person through it. I don't want it to go down that way but my brain feels so distorted in attractions.   also the lyric of thinking of another person would think or view you differently resonates in my fear of being a sad creep getting off alone to weird/obscure things. would anyone be able to look at me the same after knowing how pathetic and strangely sexually charged I can be? Or maybe I'm just lonely and want a person (in any way) to fill that gap. I don't know.  *Disconnected but beautifully raw* I think is how I dream to one day feel about sex. I'll probably always have these physical desires (even in the heat of the moment) that can be dehumanizing, but hopefully I'll see it as beautiful in a way in its simple vulnerability. Maybe one day I'll see it as an expression of love rather than spastic arousal and urges.  This has been sex thoughts provoked by lovely dodie song or what some may call "posting horny on main" lol
So how inappropriate exactly would it be to send this to my crush  (For clarity purpose, this is a joke, i do not intend on doing that)
what's that quiet, vibrating string instrument in the background of 'hot little hints ...' ?
ITS BEEN A YEAR???? I STILL LISTEN LIKE EVERY DAY
this feels like falling in love with a straight girl i cannot explain it
anyone know the ukulele chords to this
a couple days ago i was in times square at like 9:30 pm and i def didn’t want to be there. i was hardcore dissociating, really tired, was stressed about school, all the fun stuff. and then the demo of this started playing on my playlist and it was such a comfort. i was looking out the car window into manhattan, this song playing in my ears, and me, being the train reck of a human that i am, started sobbing. it was such a mood. it was kinda fun ngl
baritone uke chords anybody?
can someone please explain "rewire a dread" and "if you can't can't cool it down, steam is still steam?" i know this song is about pleasuring yourself but for the life of me, its 1AM and these two lines have me stumped 😭  this song is GORGEOUS, pure artistry!!
I l0vE this song omg please release it on spotify
Didn't plan on crying in the bathroom
someone needs to edit this over the volcano scene of Emily and Sue in Dickinson
God I love this song, I know been it’s been asked so many times but  i’m so desperate for this to be on spotify.
TW SEXUAL ASSAULT      idk if im over stepping but i took this song as like what it feels like to try to recover after a sexual assault and yearning? It feels really relatable to me especially the lines "hot little hints toe a line between sexy to sick" Because it genuinely can feel sickening when your trying to engage in intimacy after something like that. And " poor lonely mind its getting confused" because ya know i still want to be intimate with someone but when i do my mind just races and churns with so many different feelings. anyways this is a super cathartic listen.
akjdhdjsan pls,, spotify
This sounds like something I'd hear from the Beatles' Revolver
i had a durex advert before the video started BAHAHAH
Imogen Heap vibes
❤.
This song is so beautiful :’). I’ve never had a song that makes me feel so calm and relaxed. It’s just so nice to listen to!
I love the song. The recording is exquisite. Lovely images. Thanks!
She's a poetess. ❤️
is this on spotify??? can it please be on spotify????
Such a cruel thing to do to a poor helpless old man....
The lyrics are sexy and heartfelt and sad all at once. I love that.
This song is how it feels to make dream worlds where everything is perfect. Where beautiful landscapes are made and characters can fall in love without stress or sensory overload. Where life is simpler yet so complex. Every person is placed perfectly, and the full control keeps it clicked in place and satisfying.
“if you can’t cool it down, steam is still steam” pLEASE this line is so satisfying
I have now listened to this song 4 times on repeat. I keep telling myself this time is the last time. It will not be the last time. I am weak.
i keep coming backkk
lovely
dodie...I first discovered your music when one of my vocal music students did a presentation on you about 3 yrs ago.. She played a few videos during the presentation including 6/10, which blew..my...mind. I continue to be amazed at your talent, originality and creativity. Please know how much your art means to younger people, but also please know that older folks like me also really appreciate your music. Just saw "Cool Girl" today... wow! So impressive. Please keep this beautiful music coming :)  JD, Ontario Canada
Im no singer but she sings in a difficult tone, lol. I absolutely love her music, I'm gonna wait for her album in March!
this song is beautiful and so is dodie’s side profile😍
YouTube stopped recommending your video for so long and I watched one recently and seeing how much your videos and singing have grown in like a year is so crazy good. You’re doing fantastic!
Dodie  I  have no damn idea how you do this. I start to feel a feeling that is hard to describe and a minute later you post a song  that just IS the feeling. And I suddenly don't feel so weird and lonely in this feeling. You have done it several times I just don't understand.  I just wish some of that feelings felt as beautiful as your music sounds.
i listen to this once or more a day now lol. it encompasses my raw longing for someone FIENVFEVJGVB ilysm dodie
This is beautiful! These lyrics just touch you the right way! Also can you guys subscribe to my channel?
You know when you find a song and connect with it so closely that it feels like something you could have lived? Me rn with this. Absolutely beautiful <3
DODIE IM BEGGING YOU PLEASE RELEASE THIS ON APPLE MUSIC
No es por molestar pero "La gallina turuleca" me parece mucho mejor canción que esto.
Who ever these songs are written about, is a lucky man.
Your voice is incredible!
Did Elliott Smith come back to life?
Can this song be on spotify?
Dodie you are not helping me get over my being in love with you
Lo peor es que nunca sabré qué decía esta canción..
i love this song :)
I need this on Spotify pleeeaase
IITS BAKC UPPPP
I can’t wait for this to be on Spotify- this song is AMAZING
intertwined part 2
So many themes of rewiring and talking about the mind like it’s a disconnected thing (poor lonely mind, *it’s* getting confused; rewire a dread) in dodie’s music. I love it, because it really does feel like the music is an inner dialogue of processing past experiences and current emotions—just like a therapy session.
The lyric about “will you ever lie next to me in the bed I dream of us in”  is just.... :,))))))
listening to this after build a problem has been announced and i cannot WAIT to hear this on the b-side of the album....
Im so hype this is on the album
please i need you to release this on streaming
I’m pretty sure half of these views are from me lol 👁👄👁
This is FINALLY coming on spotify!!
I can't imagine a guy making a video like this.
i'm so freaking lucky to be around in this era of dodie. its so beautiful to take in
"rewire a dread" hmmmmm
Dude those harmonies.
this is like intertwined's older sister
Intertwined, 1.5: solo version. Player Two Optional
This songs not up anywhere huh?
I'm literally in the bed while listening to this and this and this has gotta be one of the most beautiful songs you have written 💜
This song is like intertwined but before intertwined, like the prologue of intertwined
This reminds of a carol ann duffy poem
Please release this song on spotify 🥺
Songs that HAVE to be canon: this one
lowkey reminds me of that song from beauty and the beast when they're out in the snow........for some reason
this felt strangely familiar, like the remain taste of unsweetened coffee. brought me back to february, the last time we spent time together.
will you be putting this on spotify?
I LOVE THIS
I love and admire Dodie so much. She's just looks like and i thinks she is a great person.. I mean, i've never met her but she's cool.
I need this on Spotify because I can't stop replaying this video.
Do you ever hear a song and then listen to it on repeat like 10 times afterwards? Cause that’s me rn
This has an Elliott Smith essence to it... I ❤️ it!
Still creating art i see 💓 I think you shaped the way I saw music in my teen years tbh.
boy did i listen to this at the exact right time, i was putting it off for some reason and now ik why
such an incredible lyricist, every one of her songs contain so much depth and it has me in awe.
*Very Interesting Girl. My kind of girl*
This song gives me adventuring through a video game forest vibes, specifically a zelda game, idk why. Or like the melody played by an old timey band in a tavern
this is giving me call me by your name vibes for some reason. anyone?
you're gorgeous!!!
I'm waiting for the musical ma'am
quite rude.
gorgeous harmonies 80)
Always creative! I love it
good job
Wait what if this is the second part to intertwined...so it would be Intertwined In the Bed 😐😳.  just a thought
I might be tripping but for some reason I thought “drawing the blinds, thinking of you” was “join the blind stinking of youth” idek
Ok pure mind here, before I watch this video....is this showing what she's singing? Cause i don't need to see anybody doing that. No judgement, just really not interested in watching. Help please 🥺
I genuinely adore this song I keep coming back and listening on repeat it’s so beautiful 🥺
i’ve been listening to this song on repeat all day it’s just so good!!
Love love love
i rlly luv dis aaaa
this is a great song but i feel like i wasnt supposed to see/hear this
i listen to you during panic attacks and it’s helped so thank u
wtf
waiting for your broadway musical, i believe you can do it!
dodie in the sky with diamonds
Dodie, you are truly a poet. When I listen to these brilliant lyrics and soft melody, I literally ascend. This is fantastic, thanks for this work of art that I'll be listening to on a nightly basis :)
I'm legit ADDICTED to this song it's so beautiful!!
Isn’t this just the same song is Intertwined?? 🧐
"you dreamt of me?"  "no, i thought of you."
Wow! 1st song I hear from you. LOVED it!  Great songwriting, few artists know how to speak of something without saying it. I loved your soft expressive voice too and captivating videoclip. Great harmonies by the end! Subscribed!
Might I ask what tech you use to record your songs? I absolutely love how you sound...Thank you :)
This feels like the biggest Pining Mood ever holy shit
oh that melody !! kind of elliot smith-y i love
Quirky girl ukulele
Me to myself in the silence after the video ended: "Very good...very good". Ahh
can you do a video on how you mix those background vocals? Theyare literally out of this world
CAN YOU PLEASE PUT THIS ON SPOTIFY :(
I Love It
I NEED THIS ON SPOTFY PLEASE!!!!!!
Somehow this one passed me by, it's a really interesting song. For me it toes the line between intimate and creepy, which I think can only be by design. I'm curious though if this relates to your feelings about the subject matter. Personally I don't think fantasizing about people as that creepy, at least as long as you remember that the person in your mind is not the same as the person out in the world.
Will you go out with me? I love your music and I love you...
joerogan
boli mnie odbyt
you might not see this comment but i'm an artist and i currently have 2 OCs THIS SONG MATCHES THE GIRL P E R F E C T L Y  um     may i make an animatic 😳
This just popped up in my recommendations after I just waved goodbye to my FWB to eventually sleep alone in my bed. Little does she know that I wanted her to stay with me for the night. So we could cuddle and fall asleep. Why is life so harsh sometimes? Why can she give me the love, but not ''the'' love.
We need this on spotifyyyy! Please <3 lova ya dodie : )
if anyone could make a song about masturbation sound like bittersweet yearning itd definitely be dodie lmao
i keep coming back
Thank you, take care, let go and do what you really need to do in this moment. Its not easy. You can do this. You will win the fight. Been there, done that :)
Oh God, I'm trapped in a late-night mental holding pattern. I listen to a song & like it & think that's it, it's past 2am, I'm off to bed, but then I click on the YouTube logo & it shows me another intrigueing Dodie song. *sigh...* *click*
I feel she needs to do a cover of favourite things I think her voice would be perfect
i am LOOKING RESPECTFULLY
This songs melody dances through my thoughts! Twirling so gracefully in my mind! Ah! I’m so obsessed with it! But I can’t find it on Spotify :(
I love your voice sooo much! <3
Ah yes I love a blister plaster advert before a sentimental Dodie song
I noticed the scratching noises in the music and now I can't listen to the song
I know everyone is saying this is like intertwined, and it really is But its like the song grew out of the toxicity of intertwined and now has a crush on a close friend  same song, same
being in a long distance relationship the perspective ive taken from this song hits pretty hard ;-;
this reminds me of intertwined :))))
as someone currently crushing on someone who wont ever like me back, the idea of falling asleep thinking about someone but it feels vaugely wrong is to real.
This is very random and totally irrelevant to the song, but I NEED TO GET OUT OF MY SYSTEM THE FACT THAT I WANT TO LISTEN TO DODIE COVERING "EVERYBODY WANTS TO RULE THE WORLD".  Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.
DODIE PLEASE PLEASE PUT THIS ON APPLE MUSIC IM BEGGING YOU. This song is beautiful I love you
I think of this song daily
im literally addicted to this song
well not from the AIR don’t be so dramatic
The number of times she moves her finger on the guitar strings is the number of times I turn around on my bed each night trying to fall asleep
CHILLS LITERAL CHILLS
hypnotic. beautiful. love.
THIS SONG IS IT
There’s something so Elliot Smith about this. I love it🥺
This song gives me literal chills. How do you write like you do??
This has a very weird Beatles vibe
I musttt know the chords!!!
beautiful :’)
This song is just so pretty,wow. You really inspire me to keep making videos.
Profound.  AND beautifully simple. Like one of those orgasms where you whisper “oh God, OH GOD,” with your outside voice by accident. Dodie, you’re quite lovely, methinks.
Thank you for making me feel.
Omg if you could do a cover of a Maria Mena song that would be phenomenal. I think your voices match so well.
Don’t know if it’s intentional or not but I like the brief musical nod to Glen Miller’s Moonlight serenade. I knew something was familiar the first time I listened but I couldn’t put my finger on it. :-) really nice piece
Ahh I'm really gonna b this person, but if anyone could please check out a cover I did (I only have 1 vid), I'd be grateful for some feedback!
this entire video was so intimate i-  i feel like shouldn't be watching its so GOOD dodie
Question- what microphone do you use To record? Love ya 💝🥺
asmr song
Beautiful song... I like it👍🤩😅
Her songs are the salvation of society
I Remember You From That CBBC Show Your Voice Is Incredible!
The back up vocals starting around 1:50 remind me of the backing vocals in Seal's "Kiss from a Rose".  Also... Hi Dodie! I love your musical creations!
I suggest everyone to lay down so youd be laying down with dodie
your songs inspires me to write a short film 👁👄👁
If i play this for a girl i like and she doesnt like it..... im moving on.... Its that simple
dodie i love you
nigh night
holy shit
this is beautiful but a little hard to follow, i feel like i have to analyze the lyrics like english literature class poetry
when are you going to make more ASMR videos? they’re really good. also this is so pretty.
This reminds me of Coraline
Anyone know if she’s putting this on iTunes?!😍😍
will this be going up on spotify?
only dodie makes masturbation sound complex and meaningful
it's like the beatles somehow had a lovechild with intertwined and it's glorious
Wow, I never heard anything like this before. Thank you for sharing.
this was absolutely beautiful dodie
I love this quite Irish folk sound, it's lovely!
I just keep coming back, I love this so much
when the furry gets “in the bed” *its time to have something demonitized*
Wow
This hit me personally
You should try to add this song on Spotify! Its beautiful
the old sister song of intertwined ♡
helloo dodie fans! please go check out my original song "better days" on my channel! me and my sister decided to make a music video which was a lot of fun. I hope you like it :)
Before tonight I had never heard of Dodie. Now I LOVE Dodie!  I need MORE Dodie!!
Sounds like a sad movie scene. I’m shedding tears over here 😭
awww, upper middle class privileged self pity hour. how cute.
please put this song and version on your next album 😍
Dodders, dammit! If I hadn't been publicly in love with you, I'd've been secretly in love with you. There it is, closed down openly... These chords, though. *sigh* *melt yet again*
Please dodie, stay safe and healthy! You're such a beautiful human being that makes wonderfully amazing songs, so cherish this ability and your personality, because you're absolutely worth it! Take good care of yourself, because you deserve to care the most about yourself and NOT about others. Know that everything starts right by yourself and is the fundament/grounding of your well-being and success ! I hope that you'd take my lovely message with you in your day and beyond, because I *really* care bout you (and so should you), although it's quite hard to express that feeling across the Internet, but don't feel pressed if you don't! :)
the little pdpdppdpdpd in the background reminds me of a wes anderson film :)
sounds like little fall of rain from les mis veeeerrryyy beautiful
sufjan stevens vibes <3
*i’m too ace for this*
She just shared a part of intimacy I never saw anyone share , very inspiring !  for the length of the song I had a major crush on her 🙈
ok but why did youtube decide to tell me this was posted 6 days late
Everyone's talking about the lyrics and rightfully so but can we talk about how when she's talking about a whirring machine she made the strings louder in the mix i-
i cant get enough of this song...i need a loooong version of it
I wish she would put her original songs on spotify! I would love for this to be on my playlist
if this isn't on the next album I'll try.
Such a beautiful quarantine-type lullaby!
So dreamy, your music is magic
love the videography, virtually as good as Kailee Morgue's Medusa, can't wait for Dodie to grow into a producer and director of other talent too!
Whenever I first listen to one of Dodie’s songs, especially when I read the lyrics along with it... I am always astounded that feelings and concepts I feel on a regular basis and would be too frightened to even try and explain to another human are felt by other people.. I know this because Dodie feels it, writes a song about it and then the comment section floods with people that understand it too and then I realise.. I’m not weird!! HOW does she so perfectly describe these feelings that have no existing adjective in the English language and yet here she goes and writes hundreds of words on that feeling and writes music to match that feeling perfectly too. Urgh. This happens to me with nearly every song she has written! Most.Underrated.Songwriter.Of.This.Decade... Dodie just GETS ‘IT’, whatever ‘it’ is.  So in awe.   So done.
love!!!
I need this song in Spotiffy
I'm lonely
you should do a cover of i love you by Billie!! I think it would be cute?
I really enjoyed listening to this. It made me tear up a little.
How does dodie manage to write such specifically relatable songs 🥺🥺🥺
This is the most beautiful song I've ever heard. Literally. I've had it on repeat since it came out and I haven't gotten tired of it once because it somehow perfectly describes THAT feeling that I usually find indescribable. Dodie, thank you so much for blessing our ears with your genius lyrics and beautiful voice 💖💖💖
Real elliott smith vibes here and i'm a fan
What would it look like if dodie made a sont with KSI?
Cutest song about masturbation I ever heard.
Umm...is this about what I think it's about? 🤣🤣'Cause I don't want my mind to be going places, then be totally wrong and look like a fool...;)
please put this on spotify fjebgfhjbyguhienafvbenbnoa
I really, really hope this one, All My Daughters, Let Go, and One Last Time, Please are on an album someday. That would be amazing.
chords?
It’s funny how weirdly specific this is to me cause every single night before I go to bed I always think about one person and I make up stories and scenarios(I know it’s a bit weird) and wonder if they will ever realize how much space they take up in my brain. Beautiful song thanks you :) ❤️
Look what you've done to her Jacob...
Oh my god this is so good.
Such haunting harmonies... dodie introduces and resolves discordant harmony so  beautifully. Painting pictures with sound and words. I've listened to this 4 times in a row; will do so again. Art is rarely so resonant, making me want to bask in it. And then so sticky, so I can't stop remembering and enjoying it.
We love you Dodie! Another masterpiece
lovely song, dodie <3 the audio is soothing, but it sounds like your mouth isn’t moving much so it would be difficult to make out the words without lyrics
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
Ah yes, needed a good cry this morning... Beautiful
Other than - you know, the subject - this song gives real problematic Disney song vibes
This song (and video) is sooo sensual. I can practically feel dodie's voice touching me (that sounds weirder than intended). Its such a beautiful song that has that classic dodie calmness but manages to be sexy in a similar way that being around someone you are crushing on or just starting to date can be sometimes. Nothing explosive, but the way the light hits their hair or the way they smile at you can just set you on fire. I absolutely love this, well done dodie, the lyrics, the harmonies, everything is so excellent, Ive had it stuck in my head since it came out
Hello, Dodie fans!!  I have an ‘ I’m absolutely smitten ’ top from her concert years ago that I’m selling on my Depop so if you’re interested check it out! Jessfashion7
this song doesn’t take me to one specific memory, it takes me to a lot of thoughts ive had about the memories it takes me to, not only is it thoughts of memories it’s like walking into my past but it’s all in black in white, If that makes any sense
please put this on music platforms (only if you wannnna)
replaying this in my mind for the rest of the day
spotify spotify spotify please
omg I love how it sounds on my headphones, i love every single detail and the background space sound
this is gorgeous. i love the lullaby fee this has with such mature and confusing topics, riddles, and metaphors scattered throughout.
there are 69 dislikes and i'm just-
Can you please put this in SPOTIFY PLEASE PLEASE
the chorus kinda hits me, i just went on a date with a girl for the first time yesterday and kinda have many feelings now and have imagined way too much and have very high expectations
bless you for putting the lyrics in the description 😌
Dodie's music always makes me feel like I've been invited to listen in on something very personal. Like I've been let in on a secret. It's such a magical feeling.
there's just so much of this that's beautiful. the silent thrumming of the guitar, the harmonies, the way her voice lifts and falls. the  poetry in the lyrics. i'm gonna come back here a lot.
THE BACKING VOCALS AT "steam is still steam" 2:11 I SCREAMED THAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL
OMG I LOVE YOU
Album when
I don't know how i stumbled upon your channel..but I'm glad I did! :)
oh how i love you
Im in love with this music!! great job ; )
Wow she's like a princess
ugh how is absolutely everything you make so BEAUTIFUL !!
just found out about your music and this is so amazingly beautiful, i can listen to this all day. Thank you!
Your voice and lyrics are asmr
She started singing and I got chills, her voice makes me feel like a person making me feel better and hugging me talking over my shoulder quietly after a anxiety attack or something
this gives mw la la land vibes
What a song to describe how I feel wishing for someone to be there next to me, holding each other as we sleep
hey i’m crying
gamer
in the bed of dodie sounds very good to me *very serious face*  or is it "from" dodie? such a difficult language... *cough*
I love how you can TELL this is written about a woman.
Some of the harmonies remind me of a foo fighters song but I'm not entirely sure which
Does anyone know the chords?
My saturday morning is Rick and Morty anime with quarantine Dodie songs. Nice huh.
this song is giving me major Intertwined vibes
So much sexuality in this song
Intertwined is all grown up 😳
This video was in my top recommended so I clicked. “A quarter to 4” Looks at clock. 3:45am... what a coincidence!! 🤭
I can’t get over the harmonies from 2:05 - 2:14
this is so different... i love it
Yeah
Is it weird that I’ve heard this song before? In the form of thoughts, in my head? Late at night?
This song describes how I feel about Fiona 😔
this makes me so emotional and sad but also just like calm idk. i hate that this makes me think of someone i wish i wasnt in luv :|
It puzzles me how dodie can make all of her songs sound so beautifully familiar. Almost like I know this song as soon as I hear it.? I absolutely love it
Put it on da itune 🥺
SPOTIFY! NOW!
I love how in the first chorus she split her voice and you have two dodies singing, one in each ear. She literally puts you inside her song
Genius as always madame but this time you’ve blown my mind completely x
this is so sOft
omg a whole cinematic experiencee <333 amazing
me waiting for it to be on spotify so i can listen to it as i play games: 👁️👄👁️
Oh, my... that tickled so many sensitive areas. What a glorious arrangement, what a storming song, thank you!
songs about sex that arent sexual are elite
this sounds kind of beatles-y!! keep coming back to listen more :)
I love this🥺
OH I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT I LIKE THAT I LIKE THAT A LOT
You’re one of the very best people I know who’s wonderfully talented at writing songs I didn’t know I wanted to hear. Always so pleasant hearing something from you Dodie!
i don't mind have ALOSIA twice a year every year... just saying
yo i forgot to watch this because when it came out i got a notif and i was like "OKAY OKAY I KNOW I NEED AN EARLY NIGHT IM GOING TO BED GRGRGRRG" but i LOVE THISSS
you help me so much with my anxiety and clinical paranoia. during attacks, and in general, also you help me fall asleep every single night. I don’t know what it is about your voice and the way you write your songs but they are one of the only things that calm me down. I don’t know how I can ever thank you. thank you for supporting me, and in return you will always have my support in all you do <3
i keep coming back to this🥺
You inspired me a lot, even though you were younger than me
i subscribed :p
wow! amazing!
Those harmonies literally made me cry .. haha😭
that made me feel so lesbian and I am not even a girl

“torn between sexy and sick” victorians romanticizing the plague: 👁👄👁

Don’t sacrifice yourself too much, because if you sacrifice too much there’s nothing else you can give and nobody will care for you.

I need a tutorial of how to play this guitar,  my hearing loss makes figuring these things out 10 times harder 😭😂
can you please show how you do that little fluttering ukulele in the back?
Wait...  No sudden spasms that kick you into high gear, assuring that you'll not fall asleep this year? I guess this as it is will have to do, even if I can't fully relate to it too. But maybe it's better to remain unseen? Or maybe I just need to lay off the caffeine...
HARMONIES YES!!!
GORGEOUSSSS gorgeous gorgeous
Can someone PLEASE get me a chord list for this I HAVE BEEN DYING
Serious Elliot Smith vibes with the harmonies and the guitar scratches. Amazing !
Me: no one knows what it is like to be addicted to this oddly specific dirty thing that hurts but also is great. Dodie: hold my ukulele
please let this be in the album! :( so so beautiful
Geez Louise.
gaaaay
Someone tell me how did she achieve such a lighting Also great song
This is such a lovely song
The scratch on the guitar on every chord loll ..good lyrcis by the way
oOpsie insert my painfully awkward crush on Rick Astley
these HARMONIES omg I love how her music is evolving so much these new songs are ethereal and unique like I’ve never heard before
This number 9814467227 Call me whatsapp me koi problm ya dikat ho ya Setalmenat  karni ho vhi call kare faltu ke mssg call na kare vehle ae jo samjhae,, ae,a
im obsessed. i make music because of you.
WHERE ARE YOUR SHEETS FROM I NEED THEM Also the song is excellent too <3
Is it just me or does this give Beatles vibes?
Can you do a "how to play"? LOVE THIS SONG!!
So relatable and so beautiful🥰
It sounds like she's singing while she's laying beside me. I'm not okay.
this feels like intertwined but a lil more lonely
those aggressive chord changes are all I can think about. I vibe with them.
on repeat all day
Did this remind anyone else of sissy and vanya from umbrella academy?
LOVE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
beautiful😍
In the space of an hour, i went from finding this song ok to deciding I want it played at my wedding and funeral and every minute of every goddamn day
this feels like it could be a spring awakening song
this song gives me such normal people vibes
This is honestly a love song like the beatles have made plenty of. Sounds beautiful and sweet, love it!!
This reminds me of the first time I ever sent noods, I felt so scandalous and vulnerable AHAAHA
This sounds straight from La La Land
I like the song and melody. I thought the finger drags across the strings was a bit distracting though
If a voice could be a fairy tale, it would be yours. ❤️
Dodie really decided to write a song that perfectly echos my current thoughts and im not mad, just feeling attacked. (In all seriousness though this is so beautiful and it'll probably be the song I cry to for a few nights loolololol)
I feel clickbaited :D
:(  All I can do is dream for now. Maybe one day 'we'll get to lie in bed together'.
I absolutely love this song.
This song is so beautiful and your voice is so bitter-sweet sounding  plus you're so so gorgeous.
damn, dodie just giving us gifts
Beatles Mix on the vocals, ah feck now I have to go listen to Lucy In The Sky, oh woe, oh misery!!!  Amazing track, love love love it!!!!!
angelic
I think of my crush that will never like me back  :( she said that she would get with me if she didnt have a bf, she doesnt have one but she has a crush on another girl.. worst thing is we're best friends and I have 0 clue how to ask her out. sad times
Beautiful melody. dodie, Where and how do u record your stuff?
عععظمممةةةةةة
The melody for "Will you ever lie next to me" is so beautiful, ethereal, and difficult to sing. I love it, and the close harmonies.
how can my friend be this hot
The Lovelyiest Lullabye on YouTube <3
this was posted on my bday ❤❤
Dodie you did it again. You wrote a song so beautifully specific yet so many people can relate to. The guitar and harmonies so simple yet so perfect. I love you
Amazing song Dodie!! Kinda reminds me of 'I Could Be In Love With Someone Like You' from The Last Five Years 😄💚
This song makes me feel every emotion that exists and I love it
This and 'Air so sweet' should be in an Album or EP called "Home"
this is so beautiful aaaaa
Wowowowow
I love how it's 98% just her voice. It demands all our attention. It says "listen to what I have to say, not just the way I say it".
I want these on spotty so bad Dodie😭
I just love the sound of hearing your fingers run across the guitar, it fits so well
please put this in Spotify i am begging uuuuuu 😭❤️❤️
Needs more minge.
New strings?
lol its basically the same as intertwined
Your channel reminds me of one person...she loves your song " Would you be so kind "....Wish I could have gather courage at that time .....Now we are stranger ...😐
(even) better than usual
i have no idea why but the harmonies/lyrics give me a really subtle beatles vibe,, they sound so timeless
Sexy 😳
I love how ASMR-y this song is!! <3
this is like intertwined but sexy and sad
beautiful!
I usually have a cup of tea at a quarter to four, if we're talking PM
WAP acoustic version
*ends*, me, still in shock at this perfectly designed song, *replay*
dodie your timing is magnificent because this is exactly how i feel about my new bf!!!
this is giving me christmassy vibes idk why
oh please help this is so nice
💜
This is ssooo beautifulll
This song makes me feel entranced, and also slightly anxious.
I relate to this too much
Dodie exscuse me I did not ask to be called out of my feelings this early in the morning 😭😭
This is so soft and it also hurts if you have lost someone, but it feels like loving your body tenderly like you imagine your lover would.
WAIT I'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE how have i heard dodie sing this before please help
Massive Kiss from a Rose vibes and I live for it
i didn't want this to end !! the doUbLe tracking and hard panning and the production quality *chefs kiss*
I am in love with this song!
intertwined vibes
All of the songs I’ve heard recently always bring up my emotions. This is no exception. Gorgeous song dodie.
“will you ever know of this image of you that can soothe me to sleep?” please this line is my life these past few months help
The twin voices are the best tingliest asmr ive heard in a while
I'm getting Intertwined mixed with Please Listen Closely vibes from this
it reminds me of so many other songs.. i dunno why... I think the verses are to blame😂
Syd Barrett reminiscence...
dodie songs are great crying songs
I saw a comment on all my daughters that said that song sounded like the older more mature sister of burned out. Well this feels to me like the more mature and less hopeful older sister of intertwined.
Dodie is a miracle worker✨ I mean her lyrics, just WOW!! Love you❤️💕
“Will you ever lay in the bed I dream of us in” reminds me of how I try to fall asleep thinking of my boyfriend so that he can be with me in my dreams even though we can’t be around each other because there’s a ✨pandemic✨. We mention how quarantine would’ve been better had we been stuck in it together but we’re 19 and living with our families
this feels like intertwined but written through the lens of personal experience
This song is just Dimly lit cosy late night ruminations So atmospheric it transports the soul to another time and mindset that you've already lived a few nights ago, a few months ago Gentle and soft and alluring and wistful and sleepy I've never found any other artist with Dodie's ability to paint and transport and connect and hit you right to the core of your identity and insecurities and passions
The melody reminds me a lot of Alice Schach and the Magic Orchestra. Major, but somehow still sad (edit: typo)
Gorgeous, that’s all I can say.
This has a Mitski energy
Excellent
Almost a B-Side yo Intertwined 🤷🏼‍♂️
dang this is good im lost for words—
I'm in love with yet another Dodie song 😌✌
oooooooooooh what a cool song i love it aaaa
Holy. Crap. GET OUT OF MY HEAD!!! Seriously, those are the thoughts that have helped me go to sleep the last couple months.
i’m guessing we might be in an intertwined situation where it all sounds perfectly chill but some specific lyrics hint at the fact that not everything is chill??
This song is bitterly tragically beautiful.
I love this one ❤️
Honestly, I don't really like your songs but this one is beautiful. I love this. Thank you for writing this.
Ay dodie! cuanto me encantas!
even if you dont release these into a alosia album which I would direly love, thank you for sharing your creativity and joy. you make the world a better place to be in for awhile and that in itself is worth every thing
"Will you ever know of this image of you that can soothe me to sleep" fucking got me
Okay so knocking one out except it's a coming of age to Rom-Com !
I was literally watching this at a quarter to four what the heck
Ah yes time to cry again
This is one of the most beautifully vulnerable song's I've ever heard. Like damn dude who need to be in an actual intimate relationship when you could just listen to dodie lol
Its hard not to think of her, but I dont allow myself because she has another... I do sometimes wonder if ever she'll get to know this image of her in my mind
I pray Whoever Likes This Comment Becomes A Billionaire Someday.
The raw want and mild guilt is EXACTLY what it feels to suddenly wank about someone you know personally for the first time lmao
oh god how desperately i want the chords to this
Oh how I’ve missed dodies beautiful soft harmonies 🥺😭✨
dodie ! dodie ! dodie ! ahhhh this is so godamn pretty 💙💙💙💙
PLEASE release this
I WONDER IF I CAN GET AN ALL CAPS REPLY FROM DODIE
wowoowowowwow dodies so PRETTY
Dude this song sounds so soft, almost as if she was actually singing it cuddled up in her bed, her voice is so beautiful.
Such a whimsical yet somber song, striking a delicate and perfect balance between both. It's amazing, thank you Dodie 😊.
This is straight up poetry holy crap I'm in love
The musical and lyrical structure of this one is SO interesting Dodie
Some serious Andrew Bird vibes and I dig it
This song is just what i needed. How is it that every new song of yours, I relate so heavily.
How does a song manage so easily to be sexy, sweet, and heartbreaking at the same time? DODIE YOU GENIUS.
finally some1 making music about wanking and threesomes that i can enjoy
Your songs have such raw emotion and you blow me away.
It’s 5am and I can’t sleep. Thank god you exist dodie ;-;
ok but is this song about wankin cause I'm getting those vibes
it sounds like something the beatles would make; great lyrics, too
I'm in love with this song!!!
SPOTIFY?????
Dodie makes me smile every time ...
gorgeous! as always :)
I understand how you feel, to sit and cry not only think about how much I relate to this. But to hear you sing this with such passion makes me cry for you. You are so strong and its amazing to see this is still alive in the world today, people who can convey such a powerful feeling with such grace.
i feel like i shouldn't be watching this. Like- it feels so intimate
This song broke me and put me back together again. Damn dodie.
i was not ready for how much i liked this, holy crap
You always have the most beautiful way with words. I can never properly express myself out loud so to hear your lyrics I'm always so blown away by how accurately you portray things in song. Brilliant as always. 💛🌻
this video is so intimate and sensual omg my heart
Beautiful 💕  Listened to this in bed as I woke my wife up with it.  She loves your music.  Thank you for sharing your art
DAMNIT DODIE I WAS ALREADY CONFLICTED WITH MY SEXUALITY AND NOW YOU DROP THIS MASTERPIECE😤
I can't sleep. So I listen to this and maybe I'll sleep later.
i still havent gotten over my ex even though its been a long time so this song is really bittersweet to me
me: *clicks on video*  video: *plays ad* me: *likes video before it even starts*
i’m literally in love with you dodie
Me dreaming of a guy I havent talked to in a year 😔👊🏻👊🏻
I wish I could explain how much this song urks me. Not because of the song, it is beautiful and obviously hits me raw. A few weeks ago I went on the craziest journey of my life and in the mist of it, sitting on the edge of the abyss, was just looking for her. To be at the most beautiful moment of my life and to not know her face frustrated me. So I just watched over the others who were vulnerable and in the thick of their own self discovery. I'm really just a simple person looking for that deal me and the universe made so long ago. I was sitting there going through every crazy adventures I've been through and all I wanted was to see her. Beautiful song dodie. Ohh what it would feel like to not be half a soul.
what a beaut
Everything about Dodie feels like laying under a freshly washed weighted quilt
this is absolutely beautiful an aaaghh i may have shed a tear or two at how pretty this is
this alosia is going really great
motherfucking lovely
Every day awake or asleep feels like a dream to me? So what should I do know..
A nice song. It reminds me of a Beatles's tune in many ways. Another winner IMO!
"Will you ever know Of this image Of you That can soothe me to sleep?"  This is one of my favorite lines from this song, its nice and beautifully written (人*´∀｀)｡*ﾟ+
“will you ever lie next to me in the bed that i dream of us in”  me, thinking of all the fictional characters i love: ouch 🥺
Really hoping this (as well as all your other ALOSIA songs) will come out on Spotify soon :D but like seriously, you are a total genius! Your songs have so much emotion and beautiful words that have been more amazing meanings. Keep on creating Dodie!! You’re doing great!
Soooooo, when's this coming out on Spotify? 👀
345?
I need chords/tabs/tutorial for this immediately and my sad heart is too lazy to do it
PLEASE POST A TUTORIAL! This song is the most relatable song I’ve ever heard 😭😭
I LOVE her songs!! They are so clever and true, and have incredible turns of phrase!❤️❤️
I see ur Beatles influence girlie nice
My heart strings keep pulling over this song but I love it
beautiful
Reminds me of when you have a good idea right before falling asleep and hope you remember it in the morning.
this is so beautiful
M- my HEART
Pure and raw music... Dodie is such a true authentic artist who shares powerful messages through her creations!
Dude wtf my feelings
this is giving me Beatles vibes *heart eyes*
How are you so poetic?
SO GOOD
Wow this is such a quarantine mood. Beautiful song
so its basically same topic of in the middle but solo
OMG OMG OMG, I got big round eyes!
I'm trapped in a glass case of emotion
the HARMONIES give me serious sgt peppers lonely hearts club band vibes
reading these comments and it’s so beautiful that one song can give so many different images
All I have to say is, wow, I'm gay
I am beyond in love with this
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Quit making me feel shit🥺
THE LITTLE TEDDY BEARR!!!
You did fantastic! The soothing background music didn't overpower the tone i assume you were going for,  awesome harmony overlays btw
This is Gold! <3
when paint and dodie release music 🥳🥳🥳✨👁👄👁✨

“Toeing a line between sexy and sick” I know she means something different but wow what a lyric for chronically ill people. Makes me think about the strangeness of finding and maintaining relationships while being sick. Also Stevie
this is like simon and garfunkel meets regina spektor in the best way possible
She don't miss.
To be honest Justin Minh will probably never know that I think of him softly dragging his fingers through my hair and reading to me to send me to sleep and it's probably for the best he doesn't
I never thought anything would beat “the bitch of living” and “touch me” from spring awakening but I have been sorely mistaken. “Will you ever know of this image of you that can soothe me to sleep” ugggh so perfect!!!
What if I’m bi sexual?
this is amazing!!! all the harmonies and minors and i really love it. Maybe upload it to Spotify? Idk
That's my problems,  all of them right now (04:15)
Your gentleness is so powerfully incredible.
I love you
you create such a great wide sound scape with your voice and your yuke/guitar. Very f-ing awesome
I want Deedee Magno Hall to cover this so bad
wow this sounds like a beatles song, sick!
when horny and yearning intersect at *just* the right spot
I love this s o m u c h
It's like, the more grown version of intertwined. Or like the sequel where the two people break up and it's been months and one of the people feels they should be over it but they aren't and they hope the other still thinks of them.
I’m kind of torn. One piece of me wants this to be about an entanglement that she wants more from and the other thinks it’s about her creepily didiling her pickle 😂
wow. just wow. this is such a gorgeous song. you're such a talented artist and somehow always manage to release songs just when I'm feeling the same way.
very, very pretty. i think you would really like helena deland.
I was having a really rough day, and then I saw dodie released a new song....
I need to listen to music to fall asleep and your songs are some of the best for that, you have such a beautiful voice.
Resonant lyrics.  Good stuff.  Thank you for sharing your work with us all.
That chromatic line on "steam is still steam" — hot damn!
Queen
Please, someone, anyone, I need a tab, or the chords bc I'm dying not learning this song, not just the lyrics
her voiceeeeee. every time
Can we get this on Spotify please?!?
i missed you dodie.
YES
pleaseee spotifyy
mesmerizing .......
Dodie, are we going through the same thing right now? I was literally holding a guitar trying to put words to these feelings, are you joking?
intertwined vibes
this has such a soft Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds vibe..
What happened to her more joyful songs
Dodie you always manage to describe exactly what I'm feeling with your music thank you so much
Can’t help but think hazel is in the next room.
Si hablo inglés y todo, pero quiero decir en español que noooo mames, eres hermosa ♥️
Am I the only one who things Dodie and Ben Platt would sound incredible together ?   Just me ??
Dodie i need chords asap this song is gorgeous
If only I was also a lyrical genius
I absolutely love your voice Dodie and I love all the beautiful lyrics!!
this made me realize how much i miss making love with someone. in the purest way. ugh it hurts
best 20th bday pressie. thank you :)
I love this because it’s amazing and crafted so so well,  dodie did it again, but my asexual brain is struggling because I can’t I think about the pinned comment 😂
dodie this is so beautiful omfg
The thumbnail is absolutely beautiful and fits this amazing song perfectly. Do I need any more proof that dodie is just magic?   Win Xx
The harmonies in this were very Beatles. I like.
So beautiful and comes across so honestly. A feeling captured perfectly in a song!
I see this song as the last strings of a failing marriage, trying to find a way to keep it from falling apart, but not knowing how. Absolutely beautiful
Okay excuse me damn???? Why did that hit me harder than I anticipated???? Yes, I'm using too many question marks right now, I know????? but damn it dodie??????!!
If songs like these never get put on a full album I'd love for her to release a Z-Sides album like Tom Rosenthal because the energy in this song is so blissfully calming
um i’m loving the ambiance of this shot, it’s so cute and cozy. reminds me of my grandma’s ^^
This has such manifesting a girlfriend at 3am vibes
This reminds me of some story you had years ago where you kept dreaming of a man in a suit and your conflicted relationship with that image.This is the melancholy "I'm horny in quarantine" song you needed to write.
This is on repeat rn like I’m on my 20th time watching it
YOUR MELODIESS I'M OBSESSED WITH EVERYTHING YOU'VE PUT OUT THIS YEAR
tHE DISSONANCE IN THE HARMONIES IS GORGEOUS AHSJFK AND “STEAM IS STILL STEAM” IS SO SIMPLE BUT SUCH A G O O D LYRIC THIS IS A NEW FAV
This was beautiful
i love the strings making that creaky sound; it’s so pretty and natural
I wish this was fully released on Spotify and stuff it’s so beautiful 😭
I need the chords so I can sing it to my gf 😭 so beautiful
😭😭😭
this song genuinely sounds so familiar but i cant quite tell why
YOUR SONGWRITING NEVER DISAPPOINTS AHHHHH HOW DO U KNOW HOW I FEEL MORE THAN I DO
the up-close voices in both ears makes me miss dodie asmr
This was beautifully soothing and perfect timing for someone struggling to sleep cos of the fcking storm outside
when you posted a piece of this on instagram, i had been trying to write a poem about this feeling, then i opened my phone and found THIS so🙃 couldn’t write something that describes it more perfectly.
My gosh this is such a beautiful song?!? It perfectly describes that feeling of having slept with someone for the first time but you're not dating and you can't stop thinking about them 😭😍
Stopitstopitstopitokokurtheprettiestpersonintheworld🥺🥺🥺
Beautiful as always...
This song is beautiful, and the video looks amazing. Such cozy lighting! The whole vibe is like sexy, but in a comforting way.
creepy intertwined
cool
“WILL YOU EVER KNOW OF THIS IMAGE OF YOU THAT CAN SOATHE ME TO SLEEP”? DODIE I JUST WROTE ABOUT THIS CONCEPT LIKE A DAY AGO I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT SO LONG HOW DID U GET INSIDE MI MIND?
dodie's songs sound how blankets feel during a thunderstorm
listen with headphones, you’ll thank me later
This has to be the most beautiful and bittersweet song about wankin' that I've ever heard.
THAT WAS SO GOOD😍
Honest raw music like this is part of the reason I ADORE you
This is just so pretty to me
i tried to learn this song by ear when it was first posted on your instagram, i fell in LOVE. this is so meticulous and intense and delicate and beautiful. might be a new favorite, really.
THIS IS MMMMM AH AH AH YA KNOW?
Turns out dodie is also very good in bed too.
Wow that was gorgeous.  Love.
This gave me serious Elliott Smith vibes!
intertwined's wife
the harmoniiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssssssss
still not convinced that ur secretly an angel
Umbrella academy season 2, if you know you know ;_;
dodie you’re amazingly talented
this is my favorite song you've ever written
I'm getting Intertwined vibes with a bit of She thrown in for luck
I love you dodie! This is incredible.
Your voice is so beautiful. I could literally listen to this all day. My heart can’t handle your amazingness 💖
steam is still steam, i adore that line
your music has been the soundtrack to so many of my memories 💜 and you always release a beautiful new song when i need it most 🥺
Hello! I’ve just started putting original tunes on my page, I am sixteen and would mean the world if people could please have a look :)
every Dodie's video is such a piece of art! visuals, lyrics, harmonies, little details .. I am soo in love ♥
okay but the harmonies are so pretty ?? like they're so ghostly and nice and just <3 <3 <3
Me watching this in bed 😶
God this is ridiculously beautiful
I just had to end my relationship, it ended on good terms but I swear its like shes singin my soul. This sad vibey music is gonna be what gets me through it lol.
Why does she always make me cry with her songs when I hear them the first time ..   How can she always predict how I feel an speak that beautifully to the emotions
That was like a angel licking the inside of my ear      Did you get that dan and Phil reference?
this is what brings me joy in this world. so beautiful. your voice, the song, just you. everything is wonderful❤️
Lovely
Gosh this reminds me so much of intertwined
The harmonies were soooo fucking good
This is so indescribably soothing, it just made me feel so comfortable after a rough day
The harmonies in the second chorus make me cry.
dodie how are you so incredible i love this song so much
i saw the thumbnail and thought it was nicole haught im still shaking
Dodie listening to you literally cures my headache idk how you do it but I love u and ur music so much
Opened my phone.   Got the notifs.   Ignored notifs as usual.  Saw the the letters d o d i e.   Clicked instantly.
Dodie’s over here making everyone’s quarantine so much better, I love ur music 🥰
This is SOOO pretty!!!
I felt this
this song is BEYOND beautiful dodie :(
ahh this is so beautiful and has a nostalgic beatles-y feel to it while still being so YOU. i'm hitting replay again. <3
❤️
This kind of feels like "Intertwined" but grown up; am I the only one?
No matter how long I've been following you, your art always has and always will take my breath away.
Listening to this while my room flashes and thunder shakes the world is so amazing , life can be beautiful
This is so gentle but so powerful.
This reminds me of The Beatles, for some reason. Lovely lovely.
I love this so much❤️ one of my favourites of the recent songs (tho they've all been wonderful)
i already want this playing on constant loop in my head, its magical
A soul shard.
I’ve been feeling really low and disconnected in lockdown, but I saw my friends this weekend and I was so incredibly present and happy, more than I have been in soooo long, and since then I’ve been trying to look after myself more and actively look for the positives and engage myself in life more, because they helped my remember how fun it can be to be alive again, and how incredible amazing the world can be <3 so thank you friends
This is so beautiful, as an artist I imagined such vivid and real love that this song could have. As a hopeless romantic I thought of my crush and blush grew over my face. You always know what whats on my mind and know how to make ne confront it. Thank you dodge this is beautiful
WHEN I TELL YOU I GASPED-
what is alosia? :o
dodie, i love you
i need this song on spotify ♥️
A beautiful storm and a beautiful song, what a beautiful night :)
Absolutely WONDERFUL !!
Hearing her fingers slide across the strings sounds really rough in such a soft song. I can't unheard it.
Perfect
:-))
Listening to this with a thunderstorm in the background gives off such a vibe.
very much indie film soundtrack vibe
👏👏👏👏👏👏 Bravo
the vibes are in fact immaculate
That was surprisingly intimate even for you dodie. I mean in a good way. Butb waow,
This song makes me think of the time when I fell in love with someone but he didn’t feel the same way! 🥺😭 Damn unrequited love SUCKS! 🙋🏽😂 what a gorgeous song, your voice is so dreamy 💭 🌈 beautiful melody! It’s stuck in my head already! 😍💖✨✨✨
I can see this song playing in a movie one day.Beautiful song.❤️👏
After a while I get so bored with peoples voices it's almost always the same, but Dodie, never fails to surprise me <3  her voice is the same but different every time and she gives me goosebumps always, never will i get tired of you Dodie
Could you cover Neck Deep heavy lies please
why is this literally me :'(
🥺💓❤💓❤💓
this is so unbelievably beautiful
💫💫🔊
Your voice is so beautiful 😭😍
I love the whole seductive whispery vibe! Especially with the guitar strumming and dodie’s little caressing movements and the crispness of her consonants 😍
ahhhh i'm always so surprised by your lyricism. You have such a particular style that is so comforting. Every song you make becomes my obsession for the next few weeks. i love it here😌ily dodie
this is the most beautiful video of yours i think ive ever seen
This song is pure art! Reminds of me of the beautiful and intimate times I had with my ex girlfriend ❤️
Reminds me of the Beatles so much 😍
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
God, everything dodie puts out just connects with me at such a raw and real level ☺️💕 I love this so much
I love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I've read your book more times then I can count I love all your songs and stuff
Amazing. You are amazing ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Do you mind me asking how long before it’s going to be on Spotify?
thank you, I just finished a really really sad show. and this is really comforting.
How ever are you so softly sublime
This song is so pretty 😍
OH MY GOD THIS IS SOOOO GOOD
So. So. Gorgeous
God this feels so warm
i feel ✨comfy✨
This has made my day/month/year infinitely better oh my god
One of my FAVORITE lyrics you've ever written!
Lyrics (I know they’re in the video, but in case you’re down here in the comments, so can’t see 💙)   Big round eyes Like a child, with a magic to match Show a shoulder, naked skin on the side Like a crack in a door on a latch Hot little hints  Toe a line between sexy and sick  What’s the deal? How much to feel?  Will you think of me differently?   Drawing the blinds, thinking of you  Poor lonely mind, it’s getting confused  Will you ever lie next to me in the bed That I dream of us in?  Rewire a dread, this whirring machine  If you can’t cool it down Steam is still steam Will you ever know of this image of you That can sooth me to sleep?   What in the world Do we have at a quarter to four?  Such a still, but perfectly real Disconnected, but perfectly raw?   So ask me again  In a suit with a tie and a drink And find outright, in half light  And you’ll think of me differently...  Drawing the blinds, thinking of you  Poor lonely mind, it’s getting confused  Will you ever lie next to me in the bed That I dream of us in?  Rewire a dread, this whirring machine  If you can’t cool it down Steam is still steam Will you ever know of this image of you That can sooth me to sleep?    I apologise if I got anything wrong! I’m pretty sure I didn’t, but if I did, please please let me know so I can fix it. 💙
Incredible melodies and the words are just so real...beautiful
I love this so much. gonna come back to it every damn night Dodie
Dodie! This is awesome! You are such an inspiration
THIS IS SO AMAZING
Could never get tired of dodie’s voice 😌
God it’s so cozy and cute and I just wanna lay next to her and listen to her sing
i’ll never get tired of her voice
The sounds of the guitar creaking fit so well with the vibes and your performance is absolutely enchanting, I'm completely mesmerized by you dodie.
So I wanted to go to sleep, but somehow I checked my phone once more and I'm soo happy I did. Perfect timing, the best bed time story.
Woah I’m early, I fr love this song now
This is amazing and I love u WHOLEHEARTEDLY
funny story i was watching old dodie videos in the shower {naughty dodie) and then i got a notification for this !! lol  🥺🥺 im so obsessed with the kitty sheets i love the sound of this song...soft but real and raw lyrics
dodie, what a stunning song and what a wonderfully intimate video
Getting strong Beatles vibes.
Why am I getting Coraline vibes? That creepy claymation movie? Anyone else?
when she said "will you ever know of this image of you that can soothe me to sleep?" I felt that
I always think I’m ready to hear you again, but those lyrics and your voice always just sweep me off of my feet
Wow
Me: I am strong, I will not be shook. Me after watching this vid: I am shook
DODIE THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL
Lovely harmonies 💕
i love how dodies voice is like a soft whisper. Her voice and songs are so comforting in a chaotic world
Watching this while lying on my side in bed was a 4D experience.
Closing your eyes and listening to it makes it so much more ✨perfect✨
😍😍😍😍
“will you ever know of this image of you that can soothe me to sleep?” how is that so specific and so beautiful ugh dodie power
I like how this was shot, this one's beautiful dodie
I cannot begin to describe how well this  video correlates with the song. The song is brilliantly written, yet so mellow-sounding that your tone of singing alone in this song can reduce one to tears. In my mind, your video is showing the perspective of the person whom is singing’s lover. It makes the video so personal, as if we are lying in bed with you, listening to you intently as you think out loud. The lighting is another example of the overall vibe of the song: on the inside, fluffy and soft; on the outside, at the same time, the softness of the light can radiate feelings of regret and sadness. The creative liberties you take ahold of never fail to impress me, Dodie. We love you so much!!!!
oh wow
It gives me nighttime in Italy vibes
Oh yes!
lyrics even though they’re in the video mostly so we can copy paste :)  big round eyes like a child with a magic to match show a shoulder, naked skin on the side like a crack in a door on a latch  hot little hints toe a line between sexy and sick what’s the deal, how much to feel will you think of me differently? drawing the blinds, thinking of you poor lonely mind, it’s getting confused will you ever lie next to me in the bed that i dream of us in? rewire a dread, this whirring machine, if you can’t cool it down stream is still steam will you ever know of this image of you that can soothe me to sleep? what in the world do we have at a quarter to four? such a still, but so real disconnected but beautifully raw? so ask me again in a suit and a tie with a drink and find outright, in half light and you’ll think of me differently... drawing the blinds, thinking of you poor lonely mind, it’s getting confused will you ever lie next to me in the bed that i dream of us in? rewire a dread, this whirring machine, if you can’t cool it down stream is still steam will you ever know of this image of you that can soothe me to sleep?
links in themes and instrumentation to “You” with parisian vibes but it’s a lot stickier and hotter and softer sorta like “human” but then also somehow reminds me of “Intertwined” ahh the song narratives crossover i love i love
THIS IS SO GOOD
the lyrics of her songs have such artistry
omg yes the harmonies are lovely also i want to steal that teddy bear it’s so cute
beautiful kind of heartbreaking song, damn those harmonies and also, great shot.
That thumbnail has me gayer than normal
I wanna make a little short film based off of this and have it playing in the background tho-
<3
But why am I getting such strong peter pan vibes. I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
time to listen to this song for 4 hours straight :))
this reminds me of a grown up version of intertwined
i just love her songs and voice
Wow
AAAH A NEW COMPLETE DODIE SONG I LOVE
hi RELEASE THIS ON SPOTIFY thanks
this could be the soundtrack for the chapter ‘Summer Skin’ in hazels book!
your music makes me feel something that I'll never feel from anything else
gosh this is beautiful
This cheered me up after feeling pretty shitty most of the day.  It’s really soothing.
Te amo te amo te amo😞😞😞
I love everything about this
This reminds me of a softer version of a song by Fun, and that's so interesting to me. It's beautiful like an in-love version of Some Nights Intro. does that strike a chord with anyone else?
i will never stop being astonished by dodie's voice and way with words
beautiful queen
she knows how much we all needed this
thanks for this lullaby
omg I saw this right when I was about to go to sleep, really made me feel like we were in the same bed
Is this what it's like to be early?
yes yes yes definitely yes  Every time I hear you sing your voice gets more beautiful. I’m watching you grow like a cute lil flower and I LOVE it
told a boy once about the image of him that can soothe me to sleep and he blocked me 🥴
I was literally just thinking, 'it'd be nice If dodie uploaded today', and then she did.
I don’t really understand it but in a way that’s what makes it so beautiful
but.... i AM in the bed right now
this somehow feels like intertwined‘s older sister but it’s such a new concept at the same time  (I adore this so much, it’s 1am here and I have it on loop - I really hope her new music goes into this direction 🥺)
I love the music but unfortunately I am autistic and cannot analyse music and art anywhere near as easily as anyone else, does anyone know what this song means?
Beautiful song and fantastic video !!!  Awesomeness has a name: doddleoddle!!!   💖  Kindest Regards from your friend François in Montreal, Canada!  🎼🃏🎶🎵🙏💯🤩🌠
IT’S THE GORGEOUS SONGWRITING FOR ME 🤩🥺
intertwined older more jaded sister
Idk if you meant to say tow and not toe at 0:28 but still beautiful song :-)
beautiful <3
ah .. very chaotic, like stress within the mind. i really like this
I feel like I am laying next to her...God this is difficult😂
goodness is it pine o'clock already?
Oh... I’m in love with this song.
DODIE I BEG OF YOU TO DROP A TUTORIAL ON HOW TO PLAY THIS
marika hackman vibes I adore this
This song gave me chills and butterfly’s
This hits that sweet intimate spot that I love to my core.
This is giving me such indie film set in Paris vibes and I am adoring it
The songwriting skills never fail to impress me it's so beautifully done!
your voice is so raw and beautiful <3
I wish I was half as talented as she is... and shes gorgeous... and kind... The audacity!
this screams rubber soul vibes said what i said
beautiful. keep creating magic. you create happiness through your music.
hello dodie reply to my comment so i can brag about it to my friends
so is this why dodie asked us if we were awake on twitter hmmmm?
Amazing song as always, really loved this one
it’d be cool to see a video on the production side of your music
Wow.
This is literally asmr 🥰
ahhhh so beautiful and amazing 😔💗
When she drags her hand up to her heart.... Like if you agree. 💓
I can't wait to play this on a loop for when I get ready to go to sleep tonight. thank you, miss dodie. 🥺🥺💞💞💞
Your songs are more than just songs, they're poetry. They way you put your feelings in words is very unique and beautifull. It really makes me feel things. I love music that is more than just simple  words put in to a melody. This is a work of art, just like the rest of your music. It amazes me everytime. Well done💗
This is a reallysoothing song just before going to sleep love you dodie
“Will you ever lie next to me in the bed, that I dream of us in” hits so differently when you put yourself to bed thinking of someone each night
Can I boop your nose?
adding this to the playlist that calms me down 😼✨
I flinched at the hair on her shoulders. For a moment, I thought they were cuts. I really appreciate how deeply this song scratches.
lovely, lovely, lovely :')
I’m just trying to figure out my sexuality and then dodie is over here like 😳😳
This song is me overthinking in bed, alternating between negative ideas and comfortable dreams.
i'm going on vacation to the countryside tomorrow and oh god this is gonna be so perfect
woo!  Is good. I like. You good. Happy.
Dodie should sing Patient is the Night; Send Me a Peach; Old Black Train and the theme song from Over the Garden Wall. Would really love to hear her cover and take on those songs. I think it would be perfect for her voice!
Can't lie music this fire in this heat isn't what i thought i needed but apparently i do
im not crying its fine
it's 2 am and i'm glad that im not sleeping
there's something so comforting about the song, and i absolutely adore it
I'm... Rather turned on now.  Thanks dodie.  No idea if that was the intention but this song and the lyrics are just so sensual I'm... Wow.
how can you make it so relatable?? i mean lysm
hey uhm... i just want to say that i love you and i love your music and yeah thats it! good night x
what a dear dodie song, so sweet and angelic
videos like this really just seem to me like the epitome of dodie, there’s an impossible amount of emotion from this tiny video
the fact that she just released euphoric transcendent magic like it was nothing .... unreal
This song fits this heat so well right now 😍 lying up awake when it’s too hot to sleep...
I LOVE YOU DODIE.
This song reminds me of lovesickness and crying in bed at night because you miss your love ngl I love the song
HEY it's a quarter to four in california rn but the other four... COINCIDENCE I THINK NOT
Holy fuck this is so intimate and raw i feel like i should thank u,,          so very much thank u for this little peak into your beautiful mind <3
Dodie's voice compliments that dim lit room so well.
I needed this today:) thank you
This song reminds me of “Intertwined” and I love it
“If you can’t cool it down stream is still steam” is my favourite lyric its really got me thinking
So beautiful, a sweet, soft tune with lovely lyrics :)
Oh look it's another Dodie hit.  Hello dodie hit, nice to hear you
Every dodie song makes me nostalgic in a weird way and I love her sm
Don't know what its about but I can _FEEL_ the metaphors and imagery...
Dodie, your voice is absolutely gorgeous and your songs are perfect for baritone singers like myself. Thank you for making songs I can actually sing along; your voice is always exactly what I need
I MISS TOUR DODIE
I literally love you so much this is everything I needed today
i'm convinced dodie is an angel
Simply beautiful, I can always rely on Dodie to come in with a great song when I'm down. Getting serious queen vibes from the harmonies at 1:49 onwards <3
the fact that this is the first thing youtube recommend when i laid down  oof
this shall be my lullaby for tonight! wonderful!
Lemme just say: this shot is beautiful. The lighting aaaaaa Great one dodieeeee
im a little earlyish so i just wanted to say you are beautiful inside out and your music keeps me happy. your pieces are poetic masterpieces and i wholeheartedly love you. xoxo gossip girl
Margie I miss you C:
C H I L L S.

Sissy from umbrella academy be like
intertwined grew up :')
I still smile whenever I hear dodies voice..after 5 years
well this is all I'm listening to for the next month 😶😪😔❤
soooo beautiful
Your arrangement make me think of Queen's ones. Thank you !🙏
an angel
The harmonies just fused into one and melted into my ears, and it was delightful. 😔✨✨
girl i- it's midnight u lookin for a new demographic??
hi so i’m here 3 minutes after and it already has 1.8k views?? GO DODIE!!!
in love
So my breath has been taken... Oh! And my heart to apparently 😅
This song is sooo interesting! like the words, chords, harmonies, the video. like it all just hits different and honestly ugh it is such a breath of fresh air. This is what I needed today. ❤️
This song is my thought process every night
Wouldn't mind lying in bed next to dodie   I'm just saying
lovely song as always darling <3
I'm already in love, cmon Dodie, don't make me dream like that
I just want this to quietly play in my mind 24/7 :,))
your voice is magical
this kind of gives me Beatles vibes???
omg i love this so much and its such a mood 🥺
I need to download all these songs
This was utterly incredible, felt like I was in a dream
I..I don't know how to feel. This is beautiful
I’m not crying you are       Ok fine I am but you are too
I needed this for tonight especially as I can’t sleep in storms thank you dodie xx
oh i'm EARLY early
Lovely!
How are Dodie’s lyrics so beautiful and unique and her voice soooo amazing how is this real 😭😭
the harmonies are just beautiful 😭
dodie, honestly, it’s SO GOOD to know that we still have artists so authentic like you. Everything that you do is so unique and beautiful, so inspiring to see you being yourself, doing your own thing.
will this be on spotify?
I love this 😞
dude!! i remember listening to this on insta and i was so interested to see how you’d develop it. and i’m not sure if this is how you intended it to represented it, but i see this as someone dreaming of someone in a romanticised light even though they’re not great for you. and when you think of them that way it soothes the pain they’ve caused you almost? i’m not sure but this is lovely
Glad I’m listening to this before I sleep
i love you
this song sounds like hot cocoa by the fireplace on a winter night, or like a much needed hug after a good cry, all of dodie's songs do.
i will never understand how Dodie always releases songs with the exact things i'm feeling in the moment
asmr but singing
this feels so warm, exactly what i needed thank u dodie
THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL PLEASE
Que lindo! 😍
ugh this one is so nice and soothing but there’s so much below it kfjsbsbs
Ahhh, I need the chords/tabs! I wanna play it
lyrics are so beautiful. can’t wait to fall asleep to this.
I like that this is a song you can waltz or slow dance to
This gives me lying in bed in a cottage after falling in love with the cute prince idk
You legit amaze me everytime.
this is so pretty wow
!!!! can relate rn ugh
Aww this is such a nice song
This is just you dodie !! Just you stick to your sound and never change x
you SHOULD be proud of the harmonies I ALSO loved them they’re too cool
is this on spotify??
I tried to think of some metaphor to describe how beautiful this is but I’m not that creative so I just sat here in complete awe :,)
Ep of alosia?
thank you.
every time you sing it feels like a hug from an old friend after a long time of being apart
the HARMONIES ARE SO GORGEOUS ugh ur such a TALENT
Literally seeing this at a quarter to 4 :0:0:0

Excellent !👌
I SAW THIS AND THANK YOU DODIE YOU ANGEL. I needed a good dodie song.
i am at loss at words to explain what your music means to me, it seems like you and your music are the only thing that can soothe me and understand me
dodie...... I'm lost for words. its beautiful
I just started, but this is already so beautiful! Keep it up
Oh your voice is just everything🥰 let’s play this constantly on repeat x
i love when women 🥺
this sounds like it would be in a movie about a women that isn’t happy in her relationship with her husband but then runs away to be a cottagecore lesbian 🥺
I CANT GET OVER HOW GOOD THIS IS
Here as early as I’ve ever been! Thank you notifications for letting me know this beautiful song has come out. Not all the way through the song yet, but absolutely incredible so far! 💙  edit: just finished it and amazing as always! So relaxing, definitely going on my sleep playlist
i think this is my new fav song of urs
this plus the thunder :))))))))))))
“disconnected but beautifully raw” are you joking darling this is BEAUTIFUL DODIE
Beautiful❤️✨
i truly don’t love an artist the way i love dodie. i started listening to her in 8th grade and i just graduated high school. she’s inspired so many songs i’ve written, and having her music as a constant during the most impressionable years of my life is more than i can ask for
there's a thunderstorm going on here and this song combined with it is incredible 🥰
I haven't been this early since quarantine started 😭😭💖💖
all i can say... masterpiece
me listening to this song in bed-
I sneezed 7 times I  a row then dodie uploaded have i figured out now to summon her?!? also more serious note, the song is so freaking good omg well done dodie, I hope everyone has a nice day :)
"quarter to 4"  me watching this at 345: 👁️👄👁️
