I was boo hooing😢😢😢crying about everyone's touching situations,😢😮😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 but I'm just flat out a team Kandi, and Xscape  person, so I felt wayyyyyyy more touched about Tameka, than anyone. I waited years'z, from high school, till now, and I'm now 41 yrs old. Everybody seem like they were dying for them to come back and Oliver and everyone is just caught up in the drama, and that's all they seem to want, but not me, I'm a true Xscape fan. #headliners
Im back 😭🤣
PAUSE @19:39 ... 🤦🏽‍♀️ Lookin' like a damn fool... Smdh 😒 and your team just put that battery in your back... gotcha lookin' CRA-ZY 😌🤦🏽‍♀️
*10:04**...**10:08** ..**10:10** 😂..OH NO MA'AM WE STARTING WIT ROUND FACE TOCHA🤣😂*
I’m back again 😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I just love Kandi & how she breaks things down
She is so SMART.  Go ahead, girl, go ahead!!
Im back 😊😂
Xscape headlining over SWV is still criminal. I get the whole followers thing and what not, but SWV can still pull! Dont get it twisted! Lol..
tocsah has commitment issues
Both Tiny and Kandi are big reality stars and have gained a bigger following and all about getting more and more money 💰 so that involves becoming business minded.
They were special guests on XSCAPE's tour. What they are talking about is not an Xscape tour and you want them to open for you lol SWV's catalogue is DIFFERENT
I have watched this too many times
Ive always liked Kandi, and she was my fav of the group. Now I love all 3. I was slwwp on Tiny cause i never watched her and TI show or her and Toya show so I never got to see her personality. I LOVE TINY. And I've grown to really like Tamika scott. Toscha just seems to have an evil spirit.
Kandi help me I  single got my own but need help starting a business!! Please help me!!
I lov❤e all my girls!!  Xscape and SWV or SWV and Xscape!!! Black people UNITE!!
I say drop SWV because they were only added for the drama to increase the views!! Xscape is the headliner!!! Be honest!
Go Kandi ❤
Rocky is the problem!
The fact that SWV opened for them. Lol and SWV sat there and made them faces as if they haven’t before is crazy and so over people acting brand new. Lord 🤦🏽‍♀️
Kandi has a beautiful voice. And that’s why she was lead on a lot of the songs. Unique voice.
Y'alls need to talk it out cause it clearly taking out of context never get an understanding
Salute Riley proud of who you're becoming the greatest reflection of your wallet stay focused
I have always liked Kandi
When she lied on tape, I got record deal she said it,then  she goes on lieing on everything an believe.
She wore that dress to be smart
I still like swv because music promote love and ecape promote secret
TAMKIA MAY BE LIKE HER FATHER
YOU CAN SING KANDI
Kandi needs to do a comedy show because she is so funny.
If they listen they may learn sumn 34:43
Kandi speak up, I can't hear you, put the mic closer. Ain't nothing to hide or be shy about, SPEAK ON IT.
Im so glad the people who God gives these talents to stand strong against the world. As she said people will try to destroy you and don't even know whats going on. One thing social media did is bring forward ppls most intimate thoughts and as we see those thoughts are tainted with negativity, pessimism, envy, jealousy, and hypocrisy.
She being funny style.😂😂
Kandi be "learning" me some thangs every time I watch her videos
I was just thinking and……. Could SWV have had the who’s opening for who disagreement *because* of this being on TV?🤔 If this concert wasn't turned into a mini reality show, would they have pushed back so hard about the order of things???
All I can say, SWV is good but they can't handle Xscape, not for real ❤
Kandi this is off the subject but girl your series three part series. I got a story to tell. I just watched all three and girl. They are good heads off to you they're a black lifetime. I mean the first one was just awesome. I loved it so thank you so much for entertaining me
Toshà was acting funny-style, She was looking for way out I have performing with them.
No hate you good
Mother is unfair
Welcome to the SOUND of Business School with Kandi!!! I HATE the pains but LOVE the lessons. #MasterclassWithKandi #SoundTeacherKandi #MasterOfAllTrades
Does anyone know the name of song that plays throughout the video?
You need to release “Only For You”. I ❤️ it girrrllll!!!
Thanks for the BTS clips, enjoyed it. Sweet nostalgia
I went to the show and man o man was it good ! They don’t make them like y’all (both groups) I grew up listening to y’all & would go again ! 😂
HATE ON U NEVA THAT❤❤❤❤
When I say I LOVE ME SO.E KANDI...SHE AIN'T GONNA LIE.... SHE NO HER BUSINESS ❤❤❤🌹💪💪💪
That mammy is Toxic plan and simple
Don’t  take it personally
She is business  wise
Kandy is so intelligent
Candy I love your honesty but you did leave without that would have quieted a lot of people if we had known that they have been opening for you. That makes them look crazy and maybe it was just for the cameras who knows
I've said this on a blogger's comments and I want to say it on your comments. Latocha is wanting to sing gospel which is the Lord's music. How can you sing the Lord's music when you're doing things that clearly States against his will. For instance, the Lord do not like you to commit adultery for example an open marriage. Now if that suits you and your husband that's fine but how can you sing gospel music when the Lord is against adultery, lying, and stealing. The Lord even states do not put any man before me. The Lord even states I am a jealous God do not put any other gods before me. Latocha treats her man like a god therefore putting her husband before the Lord. And you want to sing God's music. Latocha you have sabotage your own career. Correction  You and your God(husband) have shelved your solo career.
Wow he came with a ticket and cashed it in!!!! BBD and SWV opened for y’all!?!? she forgot lol and Grand Prairie, Texas is a North suburb of Dallas!!!
And the music didn’t make it easy at all with Tameka and her mom. That was crazy she lived in the car. Fanny tried to tell them it’s not what we think.. Coco son trying to please everyone but he have to find something he loves and connected to. But a plan A and the music should be plan B!! Tasha fake to me even when her and Tameka was talking.
I just wanna be Kandi friend in real life ❤.
Kandi don't feed in tht you got the bag
I’m Team Kandi! ❤
Her mother really mad because she told the family secret about her sister stealing her money.. I will never allow my sons to do this to each other..You can tell she’s the Black sheep🥲She only got back on the show so she could get her some supporters for when she goes Solo😂
So basically they only got mad  because it was filmed and their egos got in the way because of them cameras ( they ain’t wanna feel embarrassed) cocos very childish so it was expected
Kandi knows the business, and is not afraid to speak up and to be assertive when necessary.  This is why Kandi can turn a shade tree into a money tree.
Kandi, I think that the real reason why that gal is upset is because she probably feels like she should have been considered the leader of the group (she ain't)...and wants to make all the decisions for the group (but she cain't). She probably feels like she has the strongest voice, but that's negligible because all four of yall have your strong suits and unique characteristics of voices. Her problem is a control issue with some jealousy as well. So Toscha will respond like a wounded animal does when they feel threatened- they attack. (No, I'm not calling her an animal!!! I'm not attacking her. It's just an analogy. Toscha is probably a sweet person). I think she wants Kandi to feel what she feels by sabotaging Kandi at all costs, even if it hurts her in the process. I like all of the members and I think that they can all be successful without trying to destroy things out of spite. These are just opinions based on what is shown to us, not attacks
@16:35 😂 Kandi is hilarious
Yup the green dress was her coming out solo debut - wow
Girl sichoassdown you remember and know the struggle of TLC group being broke but the label was rich off them! GTFOH So often "artists" do end up down on their luck when they are fvcked over in the "industry". That's the only thing I DISLIKE about you is your "ACTING LIKE" it's the artists' fault they are not living how the records have been selling
Is Tasha and her husband on drugs it’s giving junkie vibes
those gunshots at the end scared the sh*t outta me too 😂
That colour is absolutely your colour, you look fabulous. 💜
Her mom is mentally and emotionally abusive. Shows favoritism and resentment towards her daughter. It's so common in our community and sad to watch play out, when the victim has finally stopped allowing the abusers to abuse them. All the trash gets put out and that shit stinks!
You are unique and your voice ❤️ ♥️! You are xec!!!!!!
I felt for her son too, he's very talented, but a dentistry degree is security and does he know how much a dentist makes... to clean teeth😂. I think when your a celebrity and your kid wants to follow in your footsteps it's important to have them look within and see of it's a dream or a fantasy. Is it really their passion or just environment ❤
I felt for Tamika. That conversation with her Mom was alot because sometimes mothers just don't see you as an adult. Mama was absolutely not use to being held accountable for her behavior, proud of Tamika❤
Her paycheck ain’t gonna be the same without y’all either! Lmbo!
Tocha sad.. Keep pushing ladies. It's time for her to go.. How I feel.. Doing too much.. Anyway.. ❤🐞
Business is business and I wouldn't lower my fee for the sake of another. I know my worth. I applied this in my job and home; with everyone.  No grey areas for foolishness and not being wise
Tocha needed to leave many moons and seasons ago.  She was dragging the group down  with her selfish agendas and cheekiness and lies. Just can't.  Let her go and do gospel.  But pray she knows that God Almighty ABBA Jehovah Elohim is not a God of chaos and disorder and God will check her and humble her.  But still we pray for peace
Xscape used to open up for you, but it doesn’t mean they should have to keep opening up. Especially, since all of your stars has risen. All of your popularity have grown. That is why I didn’t think the co headlining was a bad idea, b/c I have seen SWV sell out shows too (even internationally). I love both of your groups, & I felt it just would have an amazing moment for the culture.
I enjoy both groups, but I am hands down a Kandi superfan due to her work on the Real Housewives; I did not go to the past musical concerts, but I will the next time only because of Kandi.
Kempire cracks me up and Kandi is an acquired taste. I couldn’t stand her for years on RHOA  . I went from girl shut up to y’all better leave Kandi girl alone 😂😂😂😂
Just stumbled upon this gem of a show! Love it! I am a huge fan from Scotland ;)
I love how you have so much care and compassion for everyone Kandi regardless if they did you wrong, that's why we love you, you've got a heart of gold 💛
Tosha's mother has a bad attitude just like her daughter she's horrible to Tamika. Wouldn't be surprised if the mother wasn't in on the money scam with Tosha.
Everyone knows Kandi can sing without Kandi the group wouldn't have been no where near as successful, I'm from the UK and Kandi was the only member I knew from escape. Keep being a legend Kandi we love you ♥️
Kandi and Tiny accrued more fans through their appearances on their various reality shows this cultivated, newer fans and crossover fans so yeah, they should headline
Kandi ain’t the one that can’t sing in the group. But ___y saving grace was her good 🐱
Wow, you explained Why Escape should recieve a Larger Portion  of the Tour Money, so well....And it makes Too much sense!!!  SWV is "FIRE' group......They should'nt hate... but instead they should FOLLOW ESCAPE'S Blue Print.....And Everyone WINS!!!
Khandi and Tiny was everyone’s favourite in the group when they came out back in the day. The best voices ❤
How can somebody hate candy she bout her paper! She looking out for her group! Not to mention people know all escape music and  sec a couple weak anything and oh yes downtown
Sis thought she was in the middle of a shootout 😂😂😂 41:05 I’m hollering
Because she is jealous of you Kandi - that’s why she always accuses you of everything
This was very entertaining…but I’m sick of hearing Rocky’s ass slurp and swallow.😂😂🤦🏾‍♀️
One thing about Kandi......she  is gonna have the receipts!!!
I never thought you guys were bullies about the dress.  I took it more as if she was trying to front like she was the leader of the group instead of everyone being a leader of the group individually!!
The way Kandi is breaking down the business and the fees it makes since, I get it.
Kandi, you support everyone. Thats dope
I apologize Kandi cause after this show I now see!😩😂
I understand that it’s no else’s responsibility to offer help to someone. I just don’t understand unless she kept it a secret why it came to Lele  having to live in her car and having to  drive around the city all night long until sun up just to feel safe😢That really broke my heart for her. Unless no one knew when it was going on why wasn’t a couch offered to her if money was and option?
Kandi is about Principle and Integrity which is why she is so successful....those other ladies need to take notes and be thankful for the opportunity to work so closely with this woman.
Maybe your daughter should look into becoming an entertainment lawyer. That way she could still get into the entertainment business,
In Tocha mind she think she is bigger and better than everyone else but it’s not playing out in real life. I also think it has a lot to do with her husband.
Riley sed you being the boss that you are so age thinks it’s easy but you work hats and you have a good team  Riley go back to school for the las degree  And you can still trying to be in management in the industry  Love y’all Kandi 😘
And this is why Kandi is such a successful entrepreneur, because she knows how to separate the business and the feelings, to get the best deal at any given time..!!
I think you're awesome Kandy.
I am very proud of Tameka for finally standing up for herself.  Her sister has free will.   It’s very clear that LaTocha has serious self esteem issues, and obviously a victim domestic violence. That maybe psychically, however definitely emotionally abusive.   It’s clearly evident she blames Candy for her lack of success. She is jealous of Candies success. She is jealous of Candies life and it’s sad!   I wouldn’t want to buy a gospel album, from some who is this ugly, malicious, and has a spirit of jealous on this level.   LaTocha, her mother, and her husband are all narcissists!
📣 📣  YOU HAVE SPOKEN!!!!! 📣🙏🙏🙏
yeah you explained the tour billing situation so well. market oversaturation is real, and these promoters will do you dirty if you accept being lowballed once, they’ll do it again. not to mention record sales in the 90s don’t necessarily translate to ticket sales - you and tiny’s celebrity status definitely helps
Grammar, verb & subject agreement, poise...  You're crazy!
I love this woman!
Be careful Kandi of the Scott sisters kissing and making up and Tamika turning against you Again
Lmao @ kandi bringing up that green dress. They definitely owe yall an apology!
Ian gon lie i got tired of listening to weak back in the 90s and don’t listen to them now js
I love the clarity of it all. With the show not clearly breaking down the business aspect, it's easy for people to not fully understand why being the headliner is a big deal. The education of why it's so important and  how ticket sales play a major role even above accolades or records sales etc., gives the public  better insight of why this matter can't just be swept under the rug.   Thanks Kandy for Speaking on it!!!
Karma is a REAL THING! Tocha getting all that karma from all that BS she pulled back in the day and continues to do so. Tocha, you aren’t Beyonce and never will be whether you’re doing Gospel or R&B💯💯  Kandi and Tiny make more then you and more ppl prefer to hear them sing over you lol  Kandi is the realest & she can sing, whoever saying that is a whole LIE! 🖤🖤
Kandi's points are very valid. She didn't have to explain all of this, but she did and it appears to be because of the respect she has for SWV and business tact. #RESPECT She made it clear she wasn't disrespecting them personally and it was a business discussion (it has to be had).
I cried too
The video with Tocha on Claudia Jordan is the most ridiculous interview I’ve ever seen
Ok Kandi I must admit I love you but th way  episode of you asking about headlining made you look a type of way, like a diva when everyone else was saying co-headline. Even the look on your group faces, kind of left you out there since noone spoke up in your defense. Then Tocha was like we will co-headline, like we don't know what she taking about . Made you look bad again. I love your speak on it. They bring so much clarity and education to the situations that we don't see.  After hearing your explanation and viewing your receipts, it all makes sense now. I love the way you break things down for everyone to understand. It's business. You also are so humble in saying, with all due respect.  Kandi keep up the Speak on it! They are the best.
Some people are their own opps in their head and they really be battling.  Let her have it.
Now we see. Kandi you can sometimes be so self righteous, but I still like to hear you out before I make judgement on you. What I like about you is you don’t hold a grudge.
First off let me say Kandi you are such a lady you  seem to raiser above all the petty BS and move with grace through the bull that is thrown your direction such an inspiration to young women like my daughters.....   its obvious to me that Tocha has a jealous spirit at first I thought it was only extended towards you but I see that its also against her sister as well.  its really sad when a Mother choices sides, their mom needs to admit that she received Tameka's check and stop the madness its tearing these sisters apart aa well as the rest of the family.  I just watched their dad on a  the juice radio and Talk show  as a father myself I feel his pain.
🪄🎩🎤🎤🎤 “No Scrubs”
I cried myself because the way her mom is with the favoritism my father does the same thing with me and my 2 sisters. He barely even talks to me
Kandi said they were their GUESTS! Of course you re going last! Kandi I like you but that’s a play on words. Of course your guests go first
Your impression of Tosha is priceless 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Tosha Tosha Tosha.  Where do it end.  I'm back on the floor again lmao.  I feeling might down. But Kandi. You have spoke on it.    I'm back
Ok I love this.  You got me ☺️☺️☺️ I look forward to seeing Speak On It. You have a good spirit through all them receipts. Break on down gurl lol
We love Kempire!
Kandi is most definitely talented
Love this, Kandi! It’s time for Tameka to shine. Her sister has held her back for too long.
I so love Kandi and I love the era that this type of music brings. I hate that all the drama had to happen but Kandi has a drive that won’t stop and I’m here for it!
All of you are Artist, gifted, beautiful, have gifts , surviving business can hurt. But some will get it many will not. It hurts all of you as sisters. Swv seemed a bit distant frm begining. Just me. Idk.
U said a mouthful Tocha is her own best enemie. And I pray for Tamika and their mothers dynamic. It is very dysfunctional.
So quick question??? Let me get this straight. So Latocha going. Gospel and dropping the album??? Good friday. Lord she needs u first. Shes so confused. Im praying for her foreal. She needs help and that her husband is a big negative controling person in her life. Ugggghhh
Queen I just want to say one thing they are so jealous of you it's a damn shame especially Tama she had nothing going on in her life they all know she's a liar all her sisters know she's a liar mother knows he's a liar and the world know she's a liar and Latasha from Escape it's very jealous and envious of you always have and that damn fat no neck Michelle Brown is so jealous that you it stinks and I am on your team
KANDI HEARD THEM SHOTS AND WAS LIKE "Damn Touch that mad" lol
I like what kandi is saying but the backhanded compliments though.
People are upset because Kandi is right when it comes to the business part of the situation. I agree with her.
Kandi is correct about the business. Also, better to have management or agents work on the details to avoid artists having issues with each other.
Kandi is rite...
Kandi I just love when u break stuff down so everyone can understand. Much love
She just said that SWV do 50 shows a year and that they are oversaturated mean and they have been expose too much for the year so concert promoters may not want to book them well damn then Beyoncé is past that cause she knew damn near nine months to a year of touring. I understand if Xscape is conducting their own tour then they should headline because they are proving they’re able to pull in tickets but for them to say well let me be correct kandi Say the SWV is not pulling any tickets is a straight lie
Why are they trying to sing together now?...they all broke up their groups decades ago...because none of them could get along!!!! All need to do solo projects...and dump the group ideas....period...ALL of them...
Love you Kandi!!! Thanks for keeping it real and giving us the real tea ☕️! ❤
Tocha on a storyline being pimped by Cocky, I mean Rocky.
Great singer or not... Kandi is about her business... sure is gonna make sure they get what they deserved.
A person's spirit and energy never lies. Period..and that spirit Tosha got on her is so strong and ugly..that ain't got nthin to do with Kandi..that's who Tosha is and she needs to get herself together
Kandi is about her money! She’s not afraid to address the difficult issues. She gives her honest opinion and keeps it moving. We all know certain people 👀 are jealous of Kandi’s huge success. Continue to get your coins Kandi!  😊
@ 13:51 just meessyyy lol
It’s the three mic stands in the background for me. Kandi’s production team be on it lol
Love you Kandi u go girl love me some escape $w@g@luciou$
Where that voice come from lmao
You're my favorite  person ever. I really don't understand why you get so much hate. ❤
It was the song playing in the background when she was talking to her mom. I was in tears.
Leave Kandi alone.
I get it they don’t want to lower their value
You can tell her mom was full of it and she was taking tocha side
I THINK KANDI VOICE IS BEAUTIFUL ITS DIFFERENT AND I CAN APPRECIATE DIFFERENT
I would like to say. Regardless of business, both groups should be headline. I love both groups, both groups have just as much fan base as the next. Trust me! Now, Tosha!  Her husband sees when the group is together that's an opportunity for him to encourage Tosha to come out with a solo act so the fan base can transition into her solo projects. When you guys are not in a group he doesn't encourage her at all. We don't hear nothing about Tosha pursuing anything musically. Then he always bring your name up Kandi. It's like he wants to put you and her in competition with each other. He always reminds her how you two wasn't getting along.
I think the group is better without tocha… they seem like the performances are more fun for them … And I even believe Tamika feels more comfortable getting a moment to do what she loves without the pressure of her sister or mother… I really would love to see the group without Tocha…. I will buy it FOR SURE…. I’m NOT going to buy it without Kandi.. but I don’t think I would buy it without Tiny either lol
32:09 Come on Kandi. Teach us today ma’am. 👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾
Kandi is a mogul so I can see y she's super unbohered by the shade she wears so many hats latocha is a struggling opportunist trying to stay relevant.smh she just really needs to humble herself. Kandi and Tiny are only 2 ppl really checking for frfr
This may be controversial but Xscape is more popular than SWV even back in the day. Xscape was on a roll and they broke up on a high. All their albums went platinum, that’s big! Xscape was at the height of their career when SWV was already flopping. I’m saying that and I think SWV is the stronger group vocally and music wise.
I am a Taurus and I am very sensitive but honey when you cross me, it is world war 3! And yes I am starting that Shit!
Oh Lord showing Kempire is really going to make people think he is on your payroll...And in what 13 year's Kandi has proven she don't lie!
I love both SWV and Xscape. I can't see why they both can't be the headliner. 🤷🏾‍♀️ It's a great idea. This tour, or whatever they are doing, is for the BOTH of them. Both of the Queens of R&B groups should headline TOGETHER. 🤷🏾‍♀️  Anywho...just my opinion.
I love how respectful and emotionally supportive you are to Tameka and her Mother.
Hands down, Kandi, you have always been my favorite. Tiny you next... Tamika and LaTocha no shade...yall kool but Kandi you hit girl. Plus, since the explode of reality and social media your truth and keeping it real is hands down, the best of it all. Todd is a lucky man.
Love you Kandi...🥰
I love you, Kandi! Straight up..."She lying"...LOL. I feel the same way...like I commented before , she makes excuses that fit her in that moment.  She wanna be the lead singer... but keeping it 100, I don't feel she has a strong enough of a voice to make it as a solo artist. Plus, I feel she is in the hate mode of you and her sister.
Now it makes sense how Kandi broke down the fees. It's sounds like to me SWV  💩 themselves when it came to fees. It's not Xscape's fault when it came to the fees. SWV needs to renegotiate their fees to be headlining anybody.
Business is business!!! The people that are mad do not understand business!!!!
I appreciate the breakdown of the business aspect of the tour and understanding how it goes❤
Y’all know Kandi, Tocha, SWV, and the rest of the group have a show to sell, right? They prob all playing up for the camera..that brings RATINGS. No way in heck would Tocha and her husband would let the show portray them as villains. They’re villains running all the way to the bank  🗣️💵🏦  Also, SWV is likely getting a bigger cut of the $ so they don’t even care if they aren’t co-headlining 1 show.
Kandi a BOSS and so is tiny and Tocha can’t stand it but she could boss up too once she leave her other brain alone!!! Get some self esteem or something about herself but I love Xscape I’ll be going to see you ladies once y’all come to the CHI!!!
Only person I felt sorry for was Tameka her mom & sister are snakes my mom & sister did the same thing to me. Tameka need to cut them off they are relatives Xscape is family
Why ppl say Kandi can’t clearly she has 1 of the best unique voices in the game especially when she hit that high note. & I ain’t missing LaTocha she’s too toxic for this Grammy winning multi talented group
My first concert was SWV and I still have the ticket stub framed in an actual photobook. I miss those days! If you have SiriusXM, they play SWV nonstop on the 90s channel and on the 90s R&B/Hip Hop channel. Memories yall!!
Thank you explaining how the tours work with promoters. If I had to pick between the two groups I would pay to see Xscape in concert. That would be on the of my list first.
From what i see y'all three don't need her to be honest with you i think y'all would do better without her it will be stress-free without her think about that her head blow-up inside her butt things didn't go the way she expected it to go thats why she wants to come back into the group lol
Kandi ain't wrong for being business minded and not trying to low ball her group. However, having SWV as a guest on the Xscape tour is NOT the same as doing a show together. They should be co headlining
i love u kandi but i have to disagree on the SWV issue. and simply the integrity of it all just doesnt feel good.
Thank you, Kandi, for breaking that down. During that meeting I'm glad you spoke up.. One thing about you that I admire is your business mind. ❤😊💪🏾💪🏾
Ya  don't see what that Tosha is about. she too shady she yes sir boss with husband she does what he want her to do no matter what
People just don’t like the truth..keep speaking your truth we’ve got you ❤❤❤
And let’s be honest, if it weren’t for Kandi none of them would be on Bravo.
I Loved this episode!!!! But can you please bring Dj A-One back 💛
Kandi is about her business. Please understand this is why she has the level of success she has. It’s not personal. It’s not about feelings. It’s about business. PERIOD.
I love your honesty. Kandi keep doing you❤
We Luv ya Kandi girl ❤just  Block those fakers and  haters 🎉🎉🎉
Tosha had 20years to go solo. So what's the problem???
shalom akhathay, yapah(beautiful) smile of all time❤‍🔥can i have it💯
@Kandi did you hear the video on  KEMPIRE how Tosha shaded y’all singing voice 👀.  Myyy my
Kandi is a bully and she doesn't sing well anymore. I think the whole queens show is a joke.
You spoke on it. Your videos end up playing automatically. I don't plan to watch but I get pulled in and then walk away educated. 😊
Y’all heard kandi follow @Kempire he stay with the latest news and I just love love love listening to him 🥰🫶🏽 especially when him and the girl was holding down Potomac reviews !
And actually each member of SWV are great singers individually!
KANDIIII!!!!!!! I sooo have a new found love and respect for you!!!! Would you be the manager for my business?😂
The mom didn’t want Tamika to back up with financially supporting her. That’s why she made up so quick. Just my opinion
Come on Kandi with that Real Math!!!! Business is Business!!
Love kandy
Girl! Don’t let the negativity phase you!!! You are talented and also a very smart business woman!!!
I felt like Tamika's mom knew she had to make amends with her, in order to keep Tamika from further exposing her Tocha and that husband....  That moment seems less than genuine. 🫣
That explanation made perfect sense.
#Celebrate Kandi Day
Torcha had me fool💯 LOVE KANDI, TAMIKA AND TINY💯💖💖💖 KANDI I agree with you💯
Kandi you got me listening back to the albums
@38:38 she literally confirmed what SWV was saying about the co-headline Taj said on Ep. 3 for this show we should co-headline because it was a collaboration performance…..Kandi was clearly thinking touring wise as she stated so Xscape headlining would have made sense if they were touring and on top of that SWV agreed with that sentiment….but they weren’t touring…it was a one time performance situation where both groups would be on a stage at the same time. There would be no headliner if both groups are on the stage at the same time so Swv is right in this situation….and Kandi isnt right business wise per this specific situation asking about a headliner, because SWV  also stated how it was presented to them being similar to the versus performance. So everyone in the comment section just talking and not paying attention and going back n forth shows that listening and then “speaking on it” is lot of ppls problem.
PREACH KANDI PREACH  KANDI
I just love Kandi! She is so humble and real!!
Kandi is 100% right.  The business is ALWAYS first!  Egos aside, everybody knows Kandi’s business decisions and expertise have landed her where she is.  They could take some notes
😘😘😘🙏🏿
I feel tomika was defeated n just numb herself to say ok n agree with her momma. To save face but u can see she wasn’t there anymore
🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
That headlining situation is cocky, kandi. Lol. I've never disagreed with Kandi until this point. If yall are on a show/tour TOGETHER, then both should co-headline.
Let’s be clear: these women are a relic of the past, and at this point they’re making money off nostalgia. If LaTocha wants to be solo, I don’t think anyone would even notice. I’m sure Jermaine Dupri is glad to have parted ways from them because there seems to be more drama and less profit. And to the headlining act, Kandi, you’re not lacking any money. Let them go first and move on.
Two words comes to mind with Tamika and her mom.....Damage Control.....🤷
Hot Hot Tea! Rocky Bivens did a live telephone  interview with Tasha K. He said Todd was sucking a Tranny's dick. He called Todd, " Melvina".He said, he was not like Todd.  He said something  about Tiny too. You need to Check it out. Tocha did an interview, she said, all you do is cry and they had to stop filming because you kept crying.
Some business conversations should not be on camera people will get in there feelings just because it’s on film.  Who decision was it to bring it to the tv?  They the messy one!7
Kandi I have ALWAYS LOVED YOUR VOICE! You are my FAVORITE from Xscape. This time it's both of yall together not a headliner and SWV I thought in this instance both are headliners🤔
16:08 why ya added that sipping sound lol
So when are we getting only for you ? 😂
Kick her out the group and get a new member. Destiny child did it.🤷🏽‍♀️
I live in Dallas.. Grand Prairie is the Suburbs... but anyway.. I love Kandi... business is business... Caddy BS has no place in Business.. just making agreements to make money for all.
What’s the name of the song playing in the beginning and the end of the video?!?
You know what's even crazier... the fact that Latocha  is actually getting a bigger bag off the strength of you and Tiny's fans, but YET AND STILL is ungrateful with her attitude..  she needs therapy.
Am I the only one that noticed the 3 mics behind Kandi?? 😂 It says so much without saying anything.
speak on it
Totally off topic but Kandi’s lashes are everything😍 I’m absolutely a Kandi fan  but I’m SWV all day N Tocha’s solo deal is a blessing Hope she understands her assignment  If her worship is real she’ll succeed But if she’s pursuing a solo career for clout  she’s on a wide path
The thing is with LaTocha is she wants to be somebody so bad and make the girls wait on her to make a decision whether she’s going to do a show or not she’s going solo she’s  she’s not sure she wants to do the tv show motherfucking nutcase narcissist..wanting everything to surround around her. I hate people like that because they ain’t shit and they never gonna be shit but they act like they the shit knowing dam well she needs whatever bag falls on the table
Sounds like SWV needs a better business manager. They should be headlining period! And Billboard confirmed 30 million records sold! https://youtu.be/cKCuk1MRpYA
I understand now Kandi about the headliner issue since you broke it down. You gonna bring those receipts ❤😂
This shit is tired and old af. CASED CLOSED, NEXT CASE!
Kandi is an awesome singer/songwriter/producer/business woman/ mogul!!! She wrote bout 4 or 5 songs on the Destiny's Child album "Writings on the wall" that really catapulted them! My fav song on that album is "Hey Ladies"... Which in my opinion should've been a single. But shiiid... she wrote most of the singles that got the "ORIGINAL" Destiny's Child on the charts back 2 back. Kandi is a beast musically & overstands the game & staying relevant! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Kandi burruss is very beautiful
Thank you Kandi for explaining this properly because you had really lost some cool points with me, and I literally thought you were greedy! The whole 3 episodes carried the implication (or perception to me at least) that besides Verzuz this would be the 1st time you guys toured together in this capacity. Not only that, it was stated on the opening intro that this was for "One Night". Knowing now  more of the backstory and how business works in these scenarios, I agree with you. And I no longer think you're an assfoot, lol. Just goes to show you, you can't fully trust the media, Peacock, or any other tv shows with accuracy. Thanks again...perception is EVERYTHING!
Her husband is the mouth and the brains with his cheating ass while he’s riding her coat tail.
Kandi keep doin whatcha doin love. Get that coin through all the hate…. Winning all the time
Always Team Kandi 😘
Dayum Kandi... Now I understand why people can't stand me. I sound just like YOU!!! 😂😂😂 Lady!!!!! You deserve your flowers. There is NOTHING wrong with advocating for yourself.
Kandi, please go scorched earth on Latosha and her husband. I can’t stand that they are trying to paint you as difficult when it it CLEAR who has all the issues. You constantly support and create opportunities for others and when their reality doesn’t match their expectations, they want to blame you. Don’t shoulder the responsibility of their failures. Keep your head up. ❤ Unleash the Kandi Coated Click on them. Please and thank you.
Tocha is only “getting a deal” when Xscape is on a high.  If she’s so great, why does she always use Xscape momentum to get somewhere?
Although the ladies of Xscape didn't speak up, they sure wanted the bag.
I love you Kandi, but this debate was so unnecessary! I'm surprised you didn't have an issue with the title of the reality show having SWV named before Xscape, if the named order is of such importance and relevance to you! Love you though!
OFF SUBJECT AT MISS KANDI: "WHEN IS MOTIVATION MONEY MAKING MONDAYS COMING BACK? IT HELPED ME A LOT IN MY BUSINESS. WHO OTHER THAN YOU TO 'SPEAK ON IT?' 😂❤😘💯💜 SINGLE BOSS MOM TO ANOTHER(USE-TO-BE😆😍)
Whats crazy is this drama I blame all 4 for! NO ONE STOOD OUT IN xscape all were talented all did they thang. a nice blend of voices. swv deserves co billing. IT'S WEIRD. if i got to choose which I DON'T want to I love Both! but I NEVER turning my back on SWV! SWV HAS SO MUCH CLASS AND I LOVE THEM WITH ALL MY HEART. XSCAPE IS HURTING MY HEART RIGHT NOW. AND I DON'T BELIEVE LATOCH IS THE WHOLE PROBLEM. EVERY MEMBER OF THE GROUP IS LOOKING REAL SHADY RIGHT NOW. THEN Y'ALL TRIED SWV. SMFH
Kandi ily but y’all need to co-headline with SWV. Latocha is gone so there is only 3 of you left. Split everything down the middle with SWV.
Kadi made Escape that's who made Escape
Kandi hitting us upside the head with real game about the business of music.
You looked SO lovely on Shannon’s interview. Reminded me of Kenya for a second. So poised…and authentic. 🤍🤍
Tocha says she just wants peace but we haven't seen her being a PEACE MAKER when amongst the others.
Tamika's mom is a manipulator using the bible to control, but that same bible didn't cause her to understand that stealing is wrong. I hope one day Tamika stands up to her mom and tells her "with all due respect, I'm going to do the opposite of what you suggest because I have no interest in impressing you anymore." I want to see Tamika free from that emotional bondage of manipulation!
Kandi can definitely sing! She can write the hell outta a hit song!  And she's the smartest, yet the realest! She's fun and has her RIGHT MIND!
Kandi definitely broke that down flawlessly. I'm still a little confused about one thing, so if xscape and swv did co-headline how is that de-valuing your legacy and how does that change the money.  Can't the promoters just pay everyone equally or, I guess they would be unwilling to pay Swv the xscape salary? I definitely get advocating for yourself but that is what swv are doing too so im try to see what leg they have to stand on.
Kandi the Taurus in you is really being super petty with this. Love you but right is right and wrong is wrong.  Xscape isn’t always headliner out here in these concert streets and to not want to co-headline with SWV the group that helped pave the way for you is super petty……when it comes to money a Taurus will always be greedy. Reasons I divorced my Taurus husband he was so money hungry and greedy it was sickening didn’t care how he got it or who he hurt in the process of getting it and the ego of a Taurus is too much at times. The ego will always destroy something that can be beautiful and treasured when your only focus is money.  I love Xscape but to be honest I would rather see SWV in concert because without the 4 of you guys together in Xscape I’m not paying top dollar to see you in concert period.  If you are opening act ok but to pay for headline of 3 out the group nope not buying ticket.
The difference is that is Xscape’s tour so if they opened for you that’s different. Yhis is not an Xscape tour Kandi… Stop the cap
Is a collaboration different than opening up with somebody on tour
This sound a little shade when it comes to talking about opening up money and comparing things this doing too much I thought it was really about the Legacy I think your thought process this don't sound right
What don't do the collaboration then are y'all comparing groups or you comparing money because if so it throws out two legendary groups right
Nahhh I respect it.
But I think that you guys are mixing the two because them opening up for you guys on your tour is different than you guys being on the front line of a collaboration of two of the greatest female artists groups right
🤔So I thought about it...Tosha leaving is kinda paying her sister back b/c now it's a 3/3 split instead of 4/4😁
Truth!
I absolutely LOVE Lee Lee! Her story definitely had me in tears.
SWV opening for Xscape doest seem like  a valid reason for demanding  heald lining status in this situation. Isn't the show built on the idea of two co -equal with roughly peer status in recent black popular mus history, groups coming together. The show is not being presented to us as the Xscape reality show with special guests SWV. I really don't understand why Xscape would agree to do a joint reality show with a group they deem they deserve top billing over?
Latocha is such a liar. Tameka been discussed it with her and their mother. That's why she went off like that at their Momma house and stated that their mother did not even say anything when she told her about latocha stealing her money.  Maybe the Momma and Rocky took the money. Especially the way she wanted to cut those cameras.  Latocha claim she didn't hear about the thirty thousand while they were doing shows because Tameka didn't find out until after they stopped doing shows. She really did a video chopping up the episodes to change the narrative. 😂Girl, ain't nobody buying your album you too evil. She better divorce Kevin Hunter before it's too late. I will be looking for Tasha k interview with Rocky mistress. He already calling begging Tasha k not to put it out. 😂
I'm sorry but they mother shouldn't be allowed on the show! She is ridiculous and we don't want to see her anymore! The door is closed!
We love you Kandi, New name for the group.. The 3 who Escaped lol, from the demands  Tocha & her God 😂😂😅
If they mom is the 5th member than Mama Diane and Mama Joyce are the 6th and 7th members 😂
https://youtu.be/vHwXoY0LiQk...Escape cannot touch this song and this is only one of their songs
Everybody that follows you arenot buying tickets and everybody that comes to a Escape show does not mean they are coming to see Escape they are not the only group performing at those shows
Tocha wants financial freedom from the group. Period.
Thanks for breaking down the business aspect of how the shows and tours go
Make perfect sense to me
NEWSFLASH: latocha it's not kandi's purpose 'to pull you up'.....GOD DECIDES who he wants UP....that is not kandi's business...imagine kandi pulling you up and GOD HAVE NOT called your number to be up and your negative energy pulls kandi down because she interferred with god's business god's plan god's divine timing...imagine that!  SHE WASNT SUPPOSE TO PUT YALL ON BRAVO...SWV either none of yall!  RHOA IS HER babee that needs nurturing; BRAVO IS GOOD TO KANDI!
I am loving Speak On It, it's as good as the show. ❤️❤️❤️ #alwayshasreceipts
I don't blame her for being business savvy you gotta respect her for that... I do feel like Tocha is jealous of Kandi
I feel good about Kandi!! ❤❤
Kandi with them receipts again, ❤ SWV but she’s right , record sales and touring are 2 different things , the audience would want to see them , Jay z is not a good touring act on his own, but we know his record sales are very high. Kandi and Tiny stayed relevant for years and put xscape in a good position to make more money . Great business. If SWV was more out there in the public I’m sure they would be a bigger touring act
Honestly any one of those three groups could have headlined and the other opened and it still would hit the mark! Love all of them! Period!
KANDI IS A MEGA SUPER STAR WHO HAS MANY MANY MANY STREAMS OF REVENUE AS GOD CHOSE HER TO RECEIVE because of her pure heart and authenticity...  YES, IT IS OBVIOUS HOW LATOCHA AND HER FEEL ABOUT ONE ANOTHER latocha tries to hide it while kandi admits it publicly.  WHAT IS EVEN MORE OBVIOUS is that tiny and tamika are also envious of kandi accomplishments..i dont care what their mouth may say on the camera...  I AM DISAPPOINTED that kandi entertain those CRABS IN A BUCKET...kandi don't owe tiny tamika or latocha one dime one favour one come up!   GOD'S FAVOUR UPON KANDI keeps on blessing her...why would she forfeit her blessing for past fake friends? Friends are for a season that season was 199? THIS IS 2023!  KANDI GOD IS ABOUT TO BLESS YOU WITH A NEW GROUP..young women that you can train and develop into the ART OF YOUR DIVINE CREATIVITY....as soon as you let the past go!  KANDI IS A BRAND!   IF KANDI GET ON THAT STAGE BY HERSELF WE WILL SUPPORT HER without the other three; get them off your coattail and focus on your next endeavors for the kingdom of god is at hand...  YOUR LIFE DON'T BELONG TO YOU...ALL YOU EXPERIENCED IN THE '90'S WAS TO PRODUCE YOUNG FEMALE ARTIST IN 2023!  KANDI IS A BRAND... HOUSEHOLD NAME (good discussion at the dinner table-kandi detach yourself from the drama and emotional depression THAT IS NOT YOURS [guard your energy])
Will any of the cast mates be on speak on it?
Kandi is dead wrong here. I’ve seen artists who have more hits join another artists tour. This was different because versus and the show appears to be equally about both groups. Furthermore, are you saying Xscape does not open for other artists anymore?
Kandi is a Taurus and we are straight forward no chaser she tells the real I just love her content ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Y’all do know that headliners don’t necessarily mean you have to close a show?
Love me some Kandi
Business is Business….
It feels a bit shady when the red lights come on. 😅
We need a Kandi Burris-Tucker Business course @ HBCUs across the country!  She's always been very business savvy. I'd gladly take a role at working behind the scenes for her & her husband.
Kandi this is disappointing instead of helping bring SWV up and everyone getting paid, you lean into exploiting the fact that they do not have the same level of business savvy. Why not help ensure that these sisters that have put in the work get what they deserve too, it did not have to be either or . Where is the solidarity when it is possible for everyone to gain.
Your so right I want to see y’all before swv
don't care what you say Kandi. Yall was wrong noone should be headlining it should be equal. I speak as a fan of both of y'alls who cares who has more followers on social media if they are following you on social media they are probably following because of reality tv doesn't mean they are following you because of your music hell doesn't even mean they'll all fly out to come to a concert. I grew up loving Swv and then when Xscape came out I loved y'all equally.  You talk about that great Xscape tour that was yall tour and they signed up on it. This is something different. And of course your band members gonna agree with you if they getting more money. I still think it should be equal. I went to a concert with fantasia Babyface and Isley brothers. Isley brothers went on last and guess what everybody walking out when they came on. Don't act like y'all where the only ones people came to see in past tours there were other artists there so their fans were there too.
I can certainly understand the financial reasoning behind your decision. Interestingly enough, my biggest takeaway is that SWV has been lowballing themselves. Their sound, music, discography is worth - monetarily - just as much as XSCAPE's, if not more. I want my girls to do some reevaluating.
You are a Gift from God❤
You definitely devalued them that's sad.. it doesn't take that to do business and she does this often.
Wouldn't have hurt to split the show & money once. Not to feel comfortable it's to be fair. If you gonna say that then you want them to lose for you to be comfortable. Just messy & petty.  Lost me as a fan.  Frfr
I missed the show, I have to go back and watch it before responding. But I will say her momma needs to change her whole attitude and demeanor before she ends up not having a relationship with neither one of her daughters. She yells she has a bad attitude she needs to humble herself she should know better as a Christian woman but then again she feels like she's in control of their lives. And it's very clear that she shows favoritism to her children and that is not healthy.
The shhh 😂😂😂😂😂 okay I'm not going to be a messy grannypeachez 😂😂😂😂😂 But I love this❤❤❤❤❤
I never hear the girls talking about do it for the love of music and the fans it’s all about money.   😢 I get money makes the world go round but as fans we don’t want to hear about the money part.
Why can’t you all just co-headline? There’s a mutual respect let’s not be nasty.
Kandi math be mathing
Kandi can sing! I can admit that I had to see them in order to hear who sang which parts. That was enough fa me.
If both were doing a concert same city different location no shade but I would go see SWV😢
If she say back in the 90's one more time! Didn't y'all come out in the 90's??? Girl bye. I wouldn't buy an Xscape album, concert ticket, I don't watch yo shows, not none of em, only watching the one now is because of SWV.
I went to the New Edition concert and SWV were the Special Guests. They opened for New Edition. Additionally, they only did 4 songs, didnt do Weak. Their excuse was that they were fans of New Edition and were excited to see them perform so, they cut their own set short on purpose. I was actually disappointed because SWV has hits and they played us.
So y'all got them there on false pretenses cuz u felt this way along  Didn't they say they came in with the understanding it would be a collaborative project? If they were led to believe one thing and somebody try to switch it up, I wouldn't be surprised they react that way. It's about what was expected with THIS  project, not the past that you posting receipts for.  And if there was no disrespect, what's the problem with doing that? I believe y'all think y'all bigger than them, your not. I'm watching the show for SWV...I can't sing not 1 xscape song. SWV has a LEGENDARY catalogue, They should walk away with their head up and stay out y'all's mess.  Everything you just said in reference to them was disrespectful whether u see it or not. Your making it about money and tryna shiii on them in the process. Yes they do have a fan base, just cuz they don't do 10 reality shows and social media doesn't mean they don't have fans. You keep saying "BACK IN THE 90's"I'd buy a swv ticket, but not an Xscape ticket🤷🏽 you do realize Xscape is a has been group right?  I hope they bowed out gracefully, cuz y'all ain't it.
Candy knows Her Ishhhhhh! That’s a Business WOMAN….
kandi is 💯 correct
The editors and producers of Speak On It is amazing!!! I love it.
kandi be speaking facts
They say the same about Mary j but she the whole queen.  So ignore that shit
Anyone else watch the Tasha K interview with Tochas husband girlfriend 😅
We Love You kandi
Xscape get 1 lil Baltimore club mix and she thing she can headline LOL JK JK https://youtu.be/MVf8D4U95dc
Kandi absolutely right. Brah coco respect  great group fantastic songs on the daily I listen to swv more. During specific times xscape.  But xscape with kandi and tiny strictly business they have earned in 2023 literally already statistically at least triple swv fee by their selves. Xscape in 2023 where the business built different  these  days kandi tiny took advantage and gave xscape the more relative advantage social media numbers translate to merchandise moving tickets walk thrus higher fees etc. It doesn't make sense business wise RIGHT now to be the closing act with xscape shit gone piss people off they wanna see tiny and kandi primarily see a great show secondary and then lastly hear great singing. I was going to say hear great songs but that's TOO subjective.
Grand Prairie in tha house 🎉🎉🎉 We love y'all ❤
Kandi is the best singer in the group to me❤
the argument you’re using is lack luster … It was y’all tour … and y’all knew not to list them as OPENING ACTS but as guest instead. But if it’s an anniversary set why would they go on AFTER you all? Stick with the maintaining fees reason and you will be fine.
I respect Kandi! Unpopular opinion but she’s business savvy & definitely sets the tone!   I’m all about business, as long as I’m being respectful and being respected.
This is why Kandi CONTINUES to secure the bag! She keeps the emotions and feelings out of the business dealings of the group. Both groups could learn a lot from her.
They made it rain
Sisters don’t want to feel lower than Sisters.
They only Accept it because BBD was Performing too.
Candi too much
I'm baffled why Kandi can say everything but as soon as someone responds she is salty and acts like only her version of the situation is the truth.  Her side is not always the truth.  That's why I love the fact that Tamar is 'not having it' she's the only person to 'bark back' at Kand's truth.
Bobby Brown said that he was living in his car too.
Tocha doesn't have to share her solo business/music activities with the group. Did the other girls tell her about their solo music? Why is it a problem that she wants to keep her music private? She will reveal her music in her own time and when she wants. Did Beyonce tell Kelly and Michelle about her solo activities during and after the group?   Deals do fall apart so it makes sense if she doesn't want to share things until it's secure or ready for official promotions.   Kandi please work it out, you speculating how or what Tocha’s feeling or thinking is not helping the issue between you guys. Yall grown ass Black women, you have a big platform but you're saying more negative things than positive about her. I don't know what happened in the 90’s but it's time to get over it. Who cares if she wanted to do solo music then, majority of people in groups want to have their own solo music. I can name dozens of artists from groups who went solo and no one is making it an issue.
love you, Kandi Always keeping it real
OH ONE MORE THING TODD HIT THAT SHIT DEAD IN THE HEART WHEN HE SAID SHE MAD 😡 BECAUSE SHE THINK HER BROKE ASS SUPPOSE TO BE WHERE YOU AT YOU BECAREFUL BECAUSE JEALOUSY AND ENVY CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS. SHE DON'T UNDERSTAND WITH HER VOICE WHY SHE DONT HAVE YOUR WEALTH WELL TELL HER I SAID GET RID OF THAT PIECE OF SHIT SHE TAKING CARE OF HIM AND HIS BABY 🤱 MAMA.AND STOP 🛑 STEALING FROM TAMEKA HER AND THERE MAMA AND ROCKY BUMASS .THEY WISH THEY WERE KANDI AND TODD. (LATOCHA SCOTT MUSTY ASS ROCKHEAD ROCKY YA'LL ARE NOT KANDI AND TODD YA'LL WILL NEVER BE KANDI AND TODD SO GO HAVE 27 SEATS AND SIT MY GIRL UNYKUE FOUCHA AT THE HEAD OF THE  TABLE .)
Tocha's problem with Kandi in my opinion is because Kandi in both cases has spotted the fact that Tocha is up to no good. Tiny ain't really paying attention and reallt close to Tocha. Tamika is her sister so she's looking the other way. This just my opinion also she has no way of being out here and seen but with Kandi's connections she can get noticed. she can sing but Tamika match her so they don't need her at all.
Kandi you know you can sang sang omg watching these live xscape concerts  got me floored but I pray latocha will be able to rejoin  yall cause she gonna need yall
Girl.. swv all the way.. tired xscape and drama...
tamika's moma didn't have not one tear. if i had this kind of conversation with my babies and it's this serious my heart would be touched and pained to know my child feels like i'm not treating them like a loving mother i wouldn't be able to stop the tears
SHIT HER SISTER WIFE (UNYKUE FOUCHA ) SOUND GOOD ON THAT SONG SHE MADE TO THEY MAN ROCKY  HELL HE NEED TO PUT HER AND TOCHA IN THE STUDIO TOGETHER  AND SHE WHAT THEY COME UP WITH AS SISTER WIVES. SHIT WHY NOT THEY BEEN GOING 5 LONG YEARS  WE ALL NO ANNA MAE KNOW HER SISTERWIVE SHE CAN ACT LIKE SHE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT BABY 🤱 IF SHE WANT TO.
ROCKY KEEP MAKING HER MAKE THESE DUMBASS MOVES BECAUSE HE KNOW IF SHE DON'T AND SHE WON'T MAKE IT SINGLE THEY BOTH KNOW YA'LL GONE KEEP LETTING HER ASS BACK IN THE GROUP.AND THAT'S NOT FAIR AT ALL TO NONE OF YOU ALL.HOW DO YA'LL GO ABOUT BRING THAT TO AN END.
Kandi is the truth
Thanks for the "Headliner" explanation. Business is business and I KNOW Kandi is about business. That's how you don't get taken in THIS business!
Kandi ain’t no joke as a business woman 🔥🔥 yall might not like her but i bet y’all respect her 🤷🏽‍♂️
That Tocha voiceover is hilarious 😆
Did Kandi dry snitch they didn’t put it in camera that Taj says that about coco 😂🤣
just because they been opening it don’t have to stay that way
Which one are you starting at Tocha!  I mean the meeting or TOCHA !! NO  WE STARTING WITH TOCHA!!!!!😂😂😂😂I LOVE KANDI
It was suppose to be one show that could potentially lead to a tour, that's the impression I got.   Nonetheless, give us a string of Vegas shows with yall both co-headlining. Leave the negotiating to management. The pay doesn't have to be equal to co-headline. But it shouldn't 3-4x different. Perhaps 1-1.5X lol.
Kandi SWV are queen love them they don't stand behind y'all sex toys tiny sex thing with young girls steall money So what Kandi they just was saying aOne night show that all they was saying One night that all Kandi you was wrong
Guess that's why I just saw something about a 5yr mistress!! Ouch
I agree with you Kandi, say y’all both XScape and SWV, I’m going to buy the ticket because I want to see XScape, yes I do love SWV, but if they had a shoe by themselves which they have, I didn’t go, I didn’t buy a ticket! So I understand what you’re saying!
I hope they don’t let her come back it’s getting ridiculous at this point
Kandi be giving the hard truth 😅😅 I love it ❤😅 receipts be hard to look away from 😅
That conversation between Tamika and her mom was triggering.....it had me in tears 😢 as well....I feel where Tamika was going through
If this "tour" or performance was based on Verzuz, and described as such to SWV and they were told that it was a co-headline situation, then Kandi you are wrong. Xscape did not headline Verzuz. So, you should look at this the same way as you did when your group did Verzuz.
I was all for co-headline until your explanation. What you said makes sense.
I luv ❤️ swv and xcape
Omg I use to love that BBD song. What was that called?
Kandi won The Masked Singer, a nationally syndicated show. Kandi is definitely that girl.
Kandi is right, show a high schooler a pic of Swv & Xscape, even if they can't name everyone, they're going to know Kandi & Tiny off rip, Swv not so much. It speaks to their relevance.
i love kandi!
I think what’s throwing ppl off is why have a television show that is swv and Xscape about them both then not have a co headliner
Love it or Leave it...Kandi is the Truth! 🧾🧾🧾🧾🧾
Kandi those 2 flyers you posted from Don Juan that shows y'all as a opening act CLEARLY says at the top of BOTH "The Great Xscape TOUR" !! Again, they were on y'all's tour along with other guest. That's totally different than 2 groups coming together for 1 fucking show! Also how the hell u gon sit here mocking CoCo & questioning her "30 million records" comment when YOU was the one that started the whole thing? Then you and tiny are the ones that took it to social media after the show. Matter of fact you should've left that conversation to your business manager to hash out with their business manager! Even tiny said it was the wrong moment. & No it is not "just a few million" more albums sold than y'all you're a whole liar even if it wasn't 30 million its still in the double digits while y'all stuck at 8 million! Kandi so damn fake I swear I don't know how y'all can't see this shit. You taking digs at coko saying she ain't opening for y'all & she sold 30 million records but you and tiny can sit up there and talk about how y'all reality stars and make way more money than them & blah blah blah. So as usual you can dish it out but can't take it cause u play victim. I'm so glad ppl waking up to yo bullshit. You know damn well if SWV had said "we sold more records so we wanna headline & Xscape can open for us" you would've been just as mad as them with yo voice shaking & talking through yo teeth so cut it out🙄
What Needs To Happen, SWV Needs To Stop Getting Upset With What Kandi Is Saying, They Need To Go Back To Their Management Ask Why Their Are Not Getting More Money!!!!! Because Its Their Management Thats Low Balling Their Talent!!!!! Not Xscape!!!!!!!!! And Why Are They On The Internet With All Of The Back And Fourth Nowwwwwwwwwwww This Situation Has Happened Already, So What's All The Talk About  Nowwwwwwwwwwww I'm Confused!!!!🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔.
Don Juan needs to find some business of his own.  I've never seen such a "yes" man in my life.
I agree Kandi I'm a grown ass man and that dinner scene with her mom made me really emotional too. For various reasons. For 1, it's cause Tamika comes off as such a freaking sweetheart & it seems like she honestly doesn't have a bad bone in her body, so seeing her cower like that with her head down kind of like a kid in trouble stressed me out lol because I 100% know that feeling! I'm proud of the restraint she showed, that tells us she's used to her mom hitting the roof like that. In your head You be torn between "ok that's my mama let me just shut up & be respectful & let her have her lil moment & let her think she running sumn" & on the other hand you be trying with all your might not to just cuss the bitch out & throw her out ya house!!😂 My mom is super strong & passionate just like hers too so all I can keep saying it I understand her 100%. Especially us African Americans, I think it goes all the way back to the plantation for us & how we couldn't dare talk back to anyone that's in charge because it could cost us our life. Unfortunately it's carried over generations & black kids don't get to speak up or it's immediately called "talking back" or being disrespectful smh I watch Tamika videos & I'm glad she broke that cycle in her own home fr
Hello Kandi, That queen has issues her own husband threw her under the bus at the meeting with Motown. Laud! Laud! Laud! Please help this queen realize you just isn't solo material. There are a lot of people in the industry that has broken up and realized that they were better off staying with the group to make that money. You ladies are about uplifting one another to make your money. I believe that you ladies would have went out of ya'll way to support her in this endeavor and show her love. But that husband is so in that EAR, she can't hear the truth. He is the one that is stopping her dollars NOW! She can't blame Kandi on this hiccup. Tamika, you got your family that loves and support you, you queen keep it moving and stick with those who are uplifting and helping you grow, not holding you back. Stay around people who want to teach you not bring you down or make you feel unworthy. I believe they got your back. I seen the concert and it was ALL THAT!!!! Keep it going QUEENS!!!! Smooches. 💐💐💐💐😘😘😘😘🙏🙏🙏🙏
So happy with this video Kandi! Love you for being the direct one out of the group like taj is lol 🎉 congrats on your success !!!
Ok..I'm going to say it  I have never been a Kandi fan. But in just these 3 episode I see why she's successful and I can respect that as a fan.   And look, at the end of the day RECEIPTS dont lie 🌻
❤ Kandi, Thanks for the 411😊
Tocha just needs to sign the contract to leave Xscape, like what they did to Kandi back in the day, and just go off and do her own thing. Tocha clearly is the problem in all aspects of the business. Her sister Tamika has proven , and the other ladies, that they can perform and put on an amazing show without Tocha. She over sings anyway lol! I wonder if Tocha still in Xscape because ,as a group, she still makin big banks. Also I wonder if she still gets paid equally when she doesn’t perform on tour with the ladies..if she just sittin back collecting checks..
...Tocha... TOCHA...🤣🤣🤣
I honestly felt that her mother was speaking out of pocket claiming to be the 5th member of the group Unless she wanted to take that stance to justify her taking that money,  And she never came across as being truly apologetic for her relationship with Tamika. We now know that when those checks came through Tasha was staying with her mother so as the mother said you don't know what she was going through at that time it may well have been the opportunity to get her up from out of her house
Tocha is dead ass wrong for the treatment she is giving the girls, especially her sister...it's OK to want a solo deal but remember where you started and came from cause if you don't do good then you gonna want to back track to XSCAPE and that's not cool, btw...maybe it's never happened for her cause ppl see her attitude and the way she handling the business 🙄
*NO DISRESPECT TO KANDI,  BUT FOR THOSE THAT SAY A BITCH CANT SING KANDI DAMN SURE THE MOST PAID AND AWARD WINNING OUT OF EVERYBODY, AND STILL HUMBLE....SO MISS HER WIT YALL BULLSHIT...I SAID WHAT I SAID‼️‼️‼️‼️*
It's the semantics for me a true Taurus... if I was Lele you'd have to PAY ME a big bag. No free ish for you. Girl bye. Why your last name still Buruss?
Tamika would be great as a solo artist... Once done with this tour Kandi should write Tamika some bomb ass songs and let Tamika run this ish!! she has a great voice.
Love me some Kandi!!!!. ❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️
Tamika and Mom had me Bawling😩😥
I love Kandi cakes, but she wrong on this one first of all SWV has sold way more than 30 million records TAPES & VINYLS don't forget that but bottom line they are the elders it should be coheadlining like the tile of the show SWV & XSCAPE
Is it just me? I be needing cations up when Jamie speaks behind the camera.
LMAO. -GIRL, Say Less. -Not only does Kandi Care-She Can… Can SANG…   THE WAY KANDI AND THE TEAM HAVE PERFECTED THEIR YOUTUBE SHADE- With all the “Flashbavk Quotes” From BLACK Men in that space… had me dead.  But another example of Kandi shouting out the black folks- I AM HERE for this Queen and this speak on it ain’t for the fans cuz WE SEE EACHOTHER… ( positive vibes) haha
I just wanna know why they keep playing Tochad mind games out het ass up out the group & move on she's a drama queen bipolar & the 1 wth mental illness the world don't revolve around her weird she's not all tht
To me xscape is the whole reason I’m watching the show. No disrespect but if it was just swv by themselves or swv with some other group I wouldn’t have bothered.
Speak on it sis! i didnt want to see swv w toni braxton show in atlanta
SWV SONGS ARE BETTER IDC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xxL5645CZc&t=25s
It’s still SWV over Xscape! 🤷🏾‍♂️
Even from a BUSINESS standpoint it was a bit of an “L” for me.  Because while I will watch Kandi on RHOA, I would NEVER pay for an Xscape ticket 👀 - I WOULD however happily throw out coins for an SWV / Xscape tour. 💰  They could have even spun the marketing “SWV vs. Xscape”, made the setlist like a battle and ended on a collaboration of some sort.
Kandi you should have Comedian Ms Pat on ‘Speak On It’. Because she is absolutely hilarious and it would cool to see yall interact!!
XSCAPE HAS ALLWAYS BEEN MY FAVORITE GROUP 💯💌
Is it a tour or one night 🙄 If it’s one night why not just split it
Unfortunately that recipe to use the group didn’t work last time, she is not a likable cast member in the show. Good luck to her😊
I can’t see kandi trying to stop anyone from making a deal on their own- if anything she could have went to kandi and kandi probably would have had her on speak on it and interviewed and supported her and told everyone where to support her music- I think kandi has helped too many people and tried to help people that turned on her - but I hope everything works out and that they  do the tour and they come to my area so I can take a day off work and enjoy a good show
Shots fried ...damn I jumped so I know dat shit scared U...smh...lol
Kandi your a BOSS, and a business Woman, and Boss's don't take shorts to make others feel good ..sorry ...not sorry...You do You Boo...love You, Excape, and SWV...in that order😂❤😊
🗣️Speak on it 💯😘
Why yall can't double headline?
Thanks for explaining your fee breakdown! Xscape has a certain fee and that’s what you should make going forward. If SWV wants more money or to headline they need to negotiate and make a case.
I ❤️ both groups, but 1 thing for SURE & 2 for CERTAIN, Kandi has never been known to lie. I SAID WHAT I SAID
THAT WAS PETTY ASF YALL COULD HAVE CO HEADLINE SMH!!!! UGHHH I HATE TO SEE FOLKS ACT LIKE THAT ANNNNNDDDDD KANDI SOUND ALRIGHT........🙄🙄🙄😂🤣😂
Tasha didn't share because she's a snake and mindless. She has an opportunity to get 2 💰 💰. But she's  too hung up on trying to stop everybody's else 💰. Mainly because she has evil intentions and a black heart.
Just get Total and move on! I miss Kima, Keshia, and Pam❤❤❤❤
I love kandi
I love the way you break things down, business wise.  It is true that just because you sold more records in the 90s, even in the early 2,000, doesn't mean that you'll sell more tickets today.  You and Tiny being reality stars, definitely bumped up the following, which will significantly affect the increase and ticket sales.  I gotta back up my New York girls tho...lol.  I thiiiiiinnk if they are the ones that came up with the idea to do a show or tour ("IF" they were the ones that came up with it), they should at least get the opportunity to get the same fee as Xscape, and both groups should co-headline.  I do think that it should be a dope celebration of two BAD female groups, especially celebrating R&B music. 🤷🏽‍♂️   I do love this episode because it wasn't so messy.  It showed real-life situations without people degrading themselves.  This is why I watch.  We can all disagree without acting the damn fool for a check.
They should still coheadline at the end of the day SWV is the better act and Tasha is the lead singer, this has to stop 😂
I don't know why Tocha want to go solo again. It didn't work out for her the 1st time!!!
Stop playing Kandi! SWV sold 25 million to Xcsape 9 million. SWV is in the top 10 best selling female groups of all time, where as Xcsape isn't even on the list! I like Xcsape but Kandi stop playing.
Love me some Kandi, always about her business
I'm not at all proficient in music industry business so this is a genuine question to Kandi... If you had agreed to co-headline, even for 1 show or a very small tour, could it have helped SWV increase their current fees moving forward without hurting Xscape's future fees? While I get why the matter had to be addressed and I ain't mad at ya for getting to the business, I'm wondering if the sacrifice could have benefitted (more than harmed) all the women at the table in the long run. I think that's the piece that I feel unsettled about. Did it have to be all business or could a compromise have been struck for a greater good for two major R&B groups that deserve legendary respect on their names (and fees). I'm also just feeling like, as you mentioned New Edition, women get screwed more in getting what they're due.
Hunnie look....I say if Xscape do not want to co-headline with SWV then go out by yourself. I love Kandi and Tiny but I still have not felt compelled to buy a ticket to see them. However, if SWV comes to my city I will just buy a ticket to that show it is really not that serious.
I mean Kandi can't sing but she's still cool and her voice still blends with Xcsape.
Love SWV and XSCAPE!!! Kandi, love all of y'all. I was a little perplexed by your ask but I totally understand where you were coming from. PS: Your group and swv are definitely TV gold. We want more than 6 shows.
I get it now, it is business 🤗 I was in my feelings 😁🤣🤣
I love Kandi. Such a businesswoman. Xscape is 100x better then SWV to me.
Why did Kandi sound like a gay dude when talking about Tosha/Tasha 16:33 and 18:06 🤣🤣🤣
I agree every time Tocha wants to go solo she acts funny with her group. Also, Rocky must think he is the fifth member. smdh
I definitely owe Kandi, Tiny, and Tameka an apology! Tocha painted a picture to make herself look like the victim. I and many others fell for it! The reality show has brought to light that she and her momma are the ones with the mess!! And don't get me started on Ike... I meant her husband, Rocky!! Chile...💅🏾
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
We love you Kandi! Team Kandi always 💕💎
I love Kandi but I am a BIGGER SWV FAN and SWV should co-headline because they are the only reason I would buy a ticket! IJS
I love you Kandi
Idk why the song: Take your time and work me slowly. Kandi can sing her ass off and her voice is distinctive.
Kandi is always honest and beautiful
They just about gave Kandi a full heart attack 😂😂😂🎉🎉🫶🏿🫶🏿 and why I jumped with her 😂😂
Kandi I have always loved your voice! It brings back memories when I hear you. And I can always recognize it if I hear any of your songs. ❤
Leave moon pie out of the group, y’all don’t need that negativity😊
The latocha voice overs killlingggg meeeee 🤣🤣🤣 “oh yeah I was really looking forward to doing this” 🥴🥴🥴🥴
I bet you if you ask Kandi to talk without using her hands, she wouldn’t be able to do it! 😂I know bc I do the same thing! 😅
I actually went to their concert in 2018 in Oklahoma City entire concert was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Kandi, it's not all about you!!
Kandi, with both of the groups having a reality show.  It should be equal.
TOCHA just needs to get out the group!! And Tasha needs to sing Tocha’s Part 💯💯 I’m sorry but TOCHA is a cancer 🦠🦠🦠🔬 I PRAY TOCHA GETS IT TOGETHER  SOUL SEARCHING SO SHE CAN BE FREE!! Now and Days People don’t like Crazy people we like REAL PEOPLE!!! And nice people so please get your ish together PLEASEEEEEE 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
That's true about the over-saturarion because when I worked for the Howard Theatre, I myself got tired of seeing SWV. Escape, we haven't seen years!
Thanks for clarifying
Coko’s son is not going to be a famous singer. He’d be better an acting because they need to fill every type of role. He will find out the hard way.
Coko, Lelee, and Taj are not doormats!  They are not going to lay down and let you walk all over them.  SWV is a top tier group that sold over 30 million records WORLDWIDE and should have been treated with more respect! Yes, Coko is the lead singer of SWV and has the best voice (of anyone in both groups) but they all can sing, they just don't let their egos get in the way of making that bag like Xscape does!  The fair thing to do is share headlining title!  The only reason you guys are headline is because of the reality shows you and Tiny have been in and the scandals!   👀👀
Kandi always comes with the receipts!👏🏾👏🏾
And thank God for Mama Joyce Mama Joyce young to be on it she'll put her foot and somebody's neck about her baby..
Sister or mother it would make me don't difference take both of be in jail until they pay me my money plain and simple because this young lady got out there so I'm going hard out and for her to have not have no money with her baby was born that broke my heart that is crazy I don't take sides with my kids at all at one is wrong then they got to pay the cause that's just sad you can tell her mother is all wet other sister they both had colds and getting that taking that young ladies money so I'm just going to say pay her her money and let them be that I would have no more dealings with her. Her husband is shady and so is she...
Protect your coin Kandi
I believe everything Kandi is saying. LaTocha has shown her true colors yet again.
Ya i cried during mika and gloria scene. When Tamika said that to Gloria, it hit her hard. I CUDNT feel it but she was holding Tamika tighttt. Had me teary but thats wat it took for her to realize she hurt her baby. ❤
I agree with everything Kandi is saying however, for a one night show the  Marquee could have been shared and the fee could have been split without lowering Xscape's fee and bring SWV's up to match Xscape's just for that show. Everyone would've been happy and the supporters "fans" would have got a wonderful show, and maybe tour with the same standards 🤔. As some of the members of both groups are friends or friendly this would've been a pleasurable conversation prior to TV. Just my opinion, and the way I would've honored both groups.
One thing Kandi is gonna do is keep it business! She always have the receipts and facts! Keep it lucrative and cute Kandi!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
KANDI I love u my Taurus sister. Keep the business straight.  That's how we do!!!!
XSCAPE and SWV in the same show, should NEVER be XSCAPE at the forefront. SWV is CLEARLY the bigger act.
She might be crying out for help and don't no how to do it.
Yall just need to tell Latocha to kick rocks!! Her sister can sang her part!!
Everytime that clip of Tiny laughing at the text thread plays when she says “Hell nawl” I crack up.  😂😂😂
Hey Kandi… don’t respond to haters that are using your light to shine. It lessens your light and you start to dim like them. They take your energy that God is blessing you with. You see other artist who don’t respond. They let their fans handle it. Focus on your empire. You gotta get that EGOT! Can’t do it waisting energy and sharing your light with nonsense.
We looooovvveee yoouuu kaaaannddiii!!!❤❤
Keep doing ur thing, jealousy is on the rise
I hate that little voice change thing kandi is doing on certain words!! It sounds like a demon.
The Spice gurlz are still the best selling girlgroup till this day okay
But there’s a difference between YOUR SHOW (Xscape) and a COLLABORATIVE show.  Aside from that, your fan base is 65% from your reality shows NOT the music.   This is not Thee Xscape Tour (in which it would make more sense to headline ) and your 4th member don’t even want to be there.  50/50 shouldn’t be a problem in this case
Kandi I like you, but you were wrong this episode. Y’all need to co-headline, SWV is the older, more successful group, it was just messy business. It didn’t paint you and Tiny In a good light my dear, that’s all.
Kandi I love you sis.  Everytime I've seen you or Todd in public you're always so nice. And you can't say that about a lot of stars. But sis just co headline for this show. Ok? K.  Love you mean it.
KANDI, maybe YOU should have become a Lawyer!!  You know how to lay it out and make it plain!!  I feel ya.  Yeah I sensed the business woman in you coming out when no one else was speaking!  Be blessed! :)
Touching moments: I did cry with the situation with Tamika & her mom. It took her mom almost losing her daughter to understand that she needed more love, understanding, and affection. Her mom was wrong for not standing up for Tamika when her money was taken or any time Latosha was being deceitful. Lelee's situation was quite common but still sad. And I was sad for Coco's son but I like the agreement they came to.    Xscape Drama: My friends just saw XSCAP3 live & confirmed the show was still great with just the three of them. I'm over the Latosha discussion. I don't even want to see her unless she decides to join the group with a pure & positive attitude. They rest of the group needs peace.  SWV & Xscape Business: I love that Kandi broke it down. I understand what happened in the past with them headlining. It's CLEAR! However, was there not a way to intertwine the show at the end? Alternate & mix songs, etc? Because if I watched the show then went to the concert I wouldn't expect for either group to be an opening act or just one group close. I would expect to see a mix of the groups. The narrative just doesn't align Kandi. The show says SWV & Xscape. It needs to align. I want to see them performing together literally. Cone out with the same outfits. Sing each others songs. Something that SCREAMS union or sisterhood. I'm hoping it plays out like that.
All of this is a mess. I support none of it. Team SWV…that is all.
I understand Kandi’s perspective. I thought it was a one time collaborative show. Not a tour. I thought the two groups would be singing together, and it would be a mix of songs and performances.
I’m so ready for Kandi to drop another video so she can SPEAK ON IT
Do people know that Jesus Christ is coming soon and so is the anti- Christ? Banks collapsing soon...And people not knowing how to pray...Not knowing God...or mocking God..etc..It will be not so funny.
I understood when Kandi made the requested higher billing.
Absolutely not 🫤 ya brought out ALL of Atlanta & still couldn’t beat SWV in Versus - this convo is skewed …
If cocos son isn't mentally well in SCHOOL... imagine the music industry... especially as a feminine dark skinned gay man with a moderate voice.
I LOVE KANDI PERIODT..!! 🫶🏽🫶🏽
😂😂 Congratulations
In my opinion, she (Tocha) has to strike when the iron is hot, being in the spotlight. Otherwise, her solo project more than likely would not happen. I'm just saying.
I just love her!!! So business savvy. No shade to anyone, just business!!! She is always up lifting for everyone to get the bag!!!!
I think all of them doing this so people can tune into their tv shows…. It’s all fake beef.  but Funky Daniva explained it best .
That’s right Kandi!!! Don’t let them get away with sh!t!!! You Momma Joyce child! Don’t ever be afraid to talk about the hard stuff, because it will com back to bite you, when you least expect. SWV is hopping on the train you built, regardless of their past accolades.   You and Tiny worked hard to keep your names in the streets, even after your group broke up. SWV did none of that. I didn’t forget how they kept name dropping at the versus battle, yet their performance was trash. It even looks like y’all stepped in and helped them at one point. X scape won that battle, both technically and vocally. X scape had their sh!t together. SWV didn’t.
It kind of seems underhanded to do this joint TV show with SWV just to turn around and tell them that they shouldn’t be co-headlining the show(s) with y’all. It makes the show very pointless.
This is REALLLLLY GOOD😂And WELL PUT TOGETHER & THOSE VOICE CHANGES 🤣
That was a good explanation and I respect Kandi being about her business!
I say let Tasha go and do what she want to do. Because y'all really don't need her although it would be nice to see all four girls on stage
I absolutely LOVE Kandi’s breakdowns & she don’t mince words.  Appreciate the HONESTY! ❤️🫶🏽🥰
Umm, I feel grown folks should mind the business that pays you and stay outta grown or married couple business. Especially if you already had clashes with someone. Tamar mind your business.
Xscape also boosts the viewers on this show AS WELL! Currently SWV is on a come up because of Xscape.
Kandi looks great
TOCHA HUSBAND NEED HIS CUT THAT'S ALL. AND SHE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF HER HUSBAND  OTHER BABY MAMA.😮😊😅😂# NO SHADE 3/22/2023
They are haters you go hard and make your money girl i love candy and for Tamar i used to like tay but Tamar is the devil and also a hater
IDGAF what y'all say Kandi is so messy. She's trying to act like everything is touching and she wants to cry . BS she's trying to expose LeeLee , Tamika and CoCo on a sly tip BEFORE she goes in with the "receipts" . Kandi wants to sound concerned before she goes in. Kandi is all about her money and being relevant . She doesn't care about nothing else . She knows what she's doing so she doesn't come off as messy . Chile please . I see clean thru her.
Facts are facts they don't perform better than xsacpe no shade
So when is the Speak On It about Tamar dropping? 👀
Okay….Business is Business and after this clarification Kandi is correct!!!🤷🏽‍♀️
😂😂😂 she meant to say stardom not freedom.
Can someone else in the group start a channel? I'm not giving this channel another view.  This woman's ego is sickening.  The whole purpose of this swvxcape show was to showcase collaboration. Listen to her going on and on about fees...BTW there is no alternative universe or any universe where Xscapes music is more popular than BBD.  We don't care what your greedy no sharing self says.  Keep your business sense...don't speak on SWV or New Edition...never again will I watch your channel.  I hope others follow me.  You are too petty ...don't worry about if SWV headlined anywhere.  Please get off our TVs and go run your businesses out of our faces you are too egocentric.  I pray Tamika gets all the luck in the world...she is the only one in the group with a good heart and a real singing voice.  A stop crying your fake tears when you don't get your way.  You have disrespected SWV.  It would have been nothing for you to share one show's billing.  Sounds like you are upset for basically not really having the best music.  Thank God you wrote no scrubs at least you gave us something. Black America don't bounce Xscape in our cars.  Wack!!!!!  I hope y'all continue making lots of money for Tamika's sake.  Tamika is the gem of this group.  May God continue to bless Tamika and everyone around Tamika.  May Tamika keep bringing in money and popularity
With all due respect that was your 25th Anniversary celebration and they were your guest.  So you should appreciate that support. Respect somebody else’s hustle.
I half way believe Tameka Scott.  Once you show me you're a liar, to me, you're always a liar, even if Tameka is telling the truth this time about stolen money.  Cuz, we can't forget Tameka lied, and allowed a false narrative to spread for years, about Kandi sleeping with Jermaine Dupri's dad.    That part the Scott Sisters' mom said to Tameka, she's evil.  Let's me know Tameka had a past of lying, on her mother's watch. 😏  Can't be lying and expect people to listen and take you seriously. Plus, the mother stated Tameka's delivery is very disrespectful compared to Tocha's delivery.
Regarding the tour, I believe both groups can get paid the same.  Keep the same fee for Xscape and increase their fee to match, by simply increasing ticket prices.    Because this tour will be a two groups coming together to make a tour,  not one group creating a show that invited SWV to be part of y'alls tour.   I thought this was supposed to both SWV's and Xscape's tour,  not Xscape tour featuring SWV. 🤷🏾‍♂️
Well, Tocha and Coko both are Air Signs.  That's probably why the attitude is the same. 🤷🏾‍♂️  With Coko, I believe she felt she wasn't getting paid a fair share because she was singing lead in just about all the songs, and she perceived at the time Taj and LeLee weren't contributing enough to receive the same pay as them.  Not sure the order of when they broke up, but Coko definitely got a solo album out of it.  With Tocha, it seems like she's playing safe to go solo and if it doesn't go well, she'll still have Xscape as Plan B.  It definitely comes off sneaky and underhanded by not telling her business partners on her next venture.   I feel Tocha could've done both at the same time. Or just be honest, and say she wants to take a risk and exit the group.
I hope the gospel folks know that Tocha is using that platform to shoot herself into a stable solo career. She’s going to go right back to the heathen music soon as she’s on…..typical opportunistic behavior
The difference between The RnB Queens and their kids, Kandi's daughter and Coko's son had a non-music industry focus and actively pursued their focus to either be a lawyer or a dentist .  To flip-flop on their plans would make a parent confused and want them to finish what they started.   Just like Xscape and SWV, they stayed focused on pursuing what they wanted to do, around the same age their kids are.    So, the flip-flopping is the problem to me.
SWV should just do their own tour to solve the problem. Plus Xscape is down a member.
Bringing up that they opened up for y’all on y’all OWN tour is irrelevant Kandi stop it😂
The tea ☕ is on Tasha k show latocha husband been cheating for the last 5 years check it out.thats who she need to be mad at is her husband Rocky low down ass.
Yeah latocha blames Kandi for everything going wrong in her life just tell the truth you big mad Kandi blew up and that's just it.🎉
Love you Kandi and your voice! Fuck the haters
The clip when Toshha husband swallowed, pissed me off so bad😮😢
❤❤❤
Drive by 😁😂🤣 💴
I agree with you Kandi ‼️
I hate that the world is purposely missing all of the points Kandi is spelling out so clearly.
I'm loving that new track Kandi that beat in the background I see you
I still don't agree if you are all going to be on the stage at the same time. I know what you all have accomplished now which makes you believe your entitled to more but the versus is what peeked most fans interest in seeing both groups on stage and  yes according to the blogs SWV won.
It’s not personal it is business and numbers do not lie they sold more shows than SWV basically what Kandi was doing was protecting the bag and I understand where she was coming from
I don't think my girl Kandi getting the respect she deserves I watched the latest RHOA Reunion and Bravo provided receipts that Kandi Burruss is the NUMBER ONE RHOA with a following of Ten Million and Kenya with a little over Seven Million, she has Promoting Power for any business on top of being a business woman in her own right...I have never heard Kandi express her having such a following on Instagram, that shows humility so cocky she can't be...I personally feel that Xscape should headline because the four ladies can sing but also make a production out of it, bringing husbands on stage...etc... She looked stunning on Club Shay Shay and congratulations to her for being the first woman to appear on the show...I hope and pray that she gets the opportunity to work with Rihanna and continues to be an exceptional business woman... With blessings comes hate, envy and jealousy...Tamar trying to hypocritically promote "CHANGED" off of Kandi back, the only thing Tamar needs to be reassuring us is that she's "CHANGED" her underpants... girl bye... Sending the Queen an abundance of Love, Light and Peace attached to an enormous amount of success to come...💕
I need the new song already!! ❤️ I also appreciate you breaking down everything as far as billing. It was very insightful. I too, was fstow about the SWV thing at first but then you cleared it up. Nice hearing your perspective outside of the show.
So I get what candy is saying about selling more tickets versus records. However, (LET'S BE CLEAR) if SWV and Xscape  go on a tour together they should be considered co-headliners. It should be agreed by both groups to take turns on who opens and who closes from city to city. Forget about the fact that SWV opened for Xscape in the past this is a whole new tour. As far as who gets paid more should be negotiated between the promoters and management
If Tamika smart she would get business advice from Kandi.
Ok I get it. Thanks Kandi.
I love Xscape but Co Co was discussing never being an opening act  when the purpose of the show was for you guys to do a joint show not when they were singing at your concert as a guest that was clearly for Xscape. There is a differece. In this case I still feel SWV is right on wanting to Co headline. And many people feel this way can Kandi and Tiny consider the maybe wrong in this situation.
She y'all David Ruffin😢😂
Kandi people can’t be mad about anything you say for real because you break down the facts as it should be broke down honey. SWV has not been social media hype at all and you can’t argue with status and position. Kandi is right it’s just business. SWV stop trying to ride on the coattails of the ladies who have been selling out tickets and shows all over and just do the damn thing already.💯💯💯
Thank you for breaking down the business part of the conversation. Knowledge is power. ❤
The mother was being fake with tamika because if the sister was there it would have been a different conversation
Wasn’t it once upon a time that Kandi didn’t want to go on tour or restart the shows and now tocha is or has done the same thing?  Am I missing something?  Ion know I just can’t keep up with which group members pull out, jump back in, wants to cooperate, does not want to cooperate… who is right, who is wrong… can we all just get on the same page at the same time???  Seems like tiny and tamika stay on board chile idk
Because you don’t have your main singer Toscha. Even if you don’t like Toscha, she is main draw in your group.
"it's for you" is JAMMIN
IMHO y’all should co headline for 1 iconic show.  Period!
Why is Kandi acting like SWV does not have MORE hits than Escape🤔. I like Kandi, BUT girl.... SWV is the bigger group. SWV has hits for days and the Versus battle was a clear indicator.😩
Kandi is very messy
Kandi You are so correct They are not as relevant in today’s error as ESCAPE🎉FACTS 🎉
Ion care what y’all/they say. Kandi knows her bidness!!!!
Kandi should have put her ego aside and just agreed to both groups headline. Kandi is greedy.
They had to open for Toni Braxton and Salt N Pepa.
Receipts mammy😂😂😂😂
Kandi tell Riley she can be an ENTERTAINMENT lawyer lol
Y'all forgot to tell her she is not Diana Ross. Between her and her husband,  she is the lead. Xscape is her safety net, for when this solo deal don't work just like the others.
You cry easy Kandi. I love and support you still. I  felt for Tamika. Her mama realized how big a fool she was going to look on TV, and knew she had to clean it up. PERIOD
There is not a subscribe button on this video 🧐
Damn i hate her laugh😒
Idk what Tocha sipped on this episode but her energy was different. Homegirl was stiff and straightfaced everytime the camera panned on her. Even with yall bravo promo she was dry. But episode 3 she had a new pep in her step. Isk what's so hard about communicating your goals. No one is hating on you going solo just stop being sneaky and using your roots as a safety net. Tamika and her mom made mw sad. Her mom came thru defensive and rowdy for no reason and wouldnt even allow her to shatr her feelings. Liteallt proving her point. How are you demanding respect while yelling and screaming at your grown daughter in HER house. Smh, im glad she comforted her daughter after seeing her pain, apologized and expressed her love. As far as the headline issue, I sho was hot with Kandi implying xscape should get paid more and headline until I heard the breakdown and saw the receipts 👀 I feel Xscape should keep their fee but both groups at least open together and then do their own separate performances after.
Thank you for being a true business woman. 💜
Kandi reminds of my aunt can’t tell her nun if it doesn’t make sense
Mama G is crazy. I feel so bad for Tamika.
I don’t always Agee with everything Kane says or does, but she has always been honest and credible.  She’s not perfect, but she keeps it real and is a phenomenal business woman.  Haters are gonna hate and Kandi will keep being great!
Her mom too old for how she treats her
SWVs booking fee is b/w 20k and 30k; why Xscape is running close to $90 to $100k!
So glad she gave a shout out to our favorite YouTubers @bingeworthy !
People think your a powerful person!
I always been your number one fan Kandi
Her breakdown of why they should headline in the show explains why she has so many successful businesses
Tiny and kandi know how to make a dollar ( alot)) .....
The momma needs therapy. How you a member of you aren’t a member?! Lady grow up. They are your children not your property!
Thanks for the break down Kandi it makes all the sense
Yo who is the prayer warrior?! She is a producer on black ink crew right?
That was lucrative enough. BACHHHH😂😂😂😂
go away
Tocha does make it hard to like/root for/support her.
Maybe things are not coming together for her because she's not right & Jehovah sees that.
it shouldn't matter who went on in the day and who went on in the night . y'all should be CO HEADLINING because they coming to see both of y'all together
I agree, people will be upset but business is business it's not personal.
Tosha mouth-piece is that dam husband of hers..ie Ike Turner ie Kelvin Hunter.
Expressing your feelings is not disrespectful. I never understood when a person communicates how your actions affect them. They always say you’re being disrespectful. My mother and siblings are my moms yes men. She will not use those tactics on me and I will respectfully tell her how she’s wrong. Tanika should have never apologized for expressing how she feel.   I apologize if you FELT I was being disrespectful but wrong is wrong and right is right. Period b
One thing about Kandi is that she is going to be in her bag.. period!!!! And she going to make it make sense
Kandi look at 18:35 got me rolling 😂
Sounds like y’all can point out her wrongs and she ain’t for it
You cant sing ,act or dance/ Go away already with all that damn crying
Candy, Candy, Candy. Wow!
I love Kandi BUT AS FAR AS HEADLINING THE TOUR....They should BOTH Be Headling given this was based ofd the Popularity of Versuz-- Besides That-- I was a 90s Kid -- SWV sold more records-- were more Respected at the Time--Had More Records/Hits.... Although Chart Toppers as well- ACTUALLY XScape were a Joke at the Time-- Ppl in The Industry clowned them....& THEY WERE AN OPENING ACT at the Time ( I went to a Concert)....So Kandi--- PLEASE EAT SOME HUMBLE PIE and Remember the time when u guys had to Earn that Respect.
I'm sorry but after me learning that most of xscape music was covered and not original.  All I listen to is old skool music. Who can I run to by the Jones girls, and am I dreaming by Atlantic Starr,   you don't have to cry by Rene and Angela,  in the rain by the dramatics which most are some of their best songs to be honest. And literally with all the songs they covered they only copy and paste their voice. They copy ad libs and everything lol. I know that that's what most musicians of that time did but be for real.
She is such a joke you think that you really popping like that Mama. Let's be very clear about it girl if you are not to return to Housewives of Atlanta no one will miss you😅😅😅😅 the most interesting thing about you is your mama😅😅😅. Watching you is like watching paint dry on a wall. The only time that you gave me it's the right and we haven't heard you write anything lately. You are very bitter and I hope God coming to your life. That's why your man cheating on you now but I bet you'll make sure that don't reach the blogs
ONE THING ABOUT THIS ERA WE INNNNNNN IS NOT GONNA LET LATOCHA WIN
It does not matter - two group show should be a co-headline. Unless its group one featuring group 2.
If that's how u felt this should've been a discussion in the beginning. Why get on the show and try to clown the other ladies because of your social media fan base. We know y'all have more followers but yall music don't add up to SWV catalog.
Hey gurlll! ❤️
*** CONGRATS!!!!! 600K 🤛🏽🤛🏽🤛🏽💯💙
Kandi you were being disrespectful. She said for this show!
To be Donjuan under study would be awesome…
I can’t wait for kandi to REAd Tamar !!!! From on Taurus to another!!!
I love you kandi
She said the promoters were trying to figure out how much to pay both groups.... so if Kandi so business savy why not have SWV on the same rate as yall? Wtf?
Kandi PLEASE bring us Another play... I Absolutely enjoy the screen play!!! Continued Success & Much Love ❤
Kandi is about her business! PERIOD
Self made
Kandi is the entrepreneur goat....
But is it the same appeal as 3 than 4? Just asking because I’ve always seen Escape together
Thanks for the receipts Candi
Congratulations on 600K!!! 🥳🥳🥳🥳 Now send a fellow bulldog (TCHS) some subs and watch hours 🤗
Wow. SWV has sold more records than New Edition? I would never have guessed that. Interesting.
Talk 👏🏿yo👏🏿shit👏🏿 Kandi! This is how you give a bit#$ the business!
I think both SWV and XScape should just be on stage together doing each other’s songs together. Then have moments of individuality for the biggest of hits. 12:52
I get what Kandi is saying about the headlining now... at first I didnt understand now I do... if u have been opening up for them whats the problem now??? I get it
That’s true for all the ladies, if any of them had a thriving solo career they probably wouldn’t want to be bothered with the group either. I just don’t get why the fans have to choose between having Kandi in the group or having Latocha in the group. I love to hear Latocha sing. What an incredible voice she has.
Kandi ain’t using ego she knows how the business works!! This is why people need to stay out of that part of the conversation if they didn’t understand
People saying Kandi can’t sing. She has a distinctive voice like Tboz from TLC. She doesn’t have to sound like Patti Labelle. Geez. I still think co-headlining was best.
Yessssssss kandi yessssssss speak on it baby girl speak on it they was camp leaning in you when you didn't want too go back to the group and you was Soo right about here just do you boo she's just jealous of your talented thank you for telling us step by step what it is love your honesty 😘❤️
I do not like Tocha raggedy trifling sneaky underhanded ass!! And as for SWV and people with their slick ass comments fk them. Stand on what you said Kandi. Bc you stated facts!!
Sis the girls just maaaaaaad cause you always getting to the bag!!!
Kandi we appreciate the receipts. I think to keep it classy because someone has to do it,it would have been nice to say our rates were different vs. saying your rate was 3 or 4x more since you acknowledged you weren’t going to say what the rate was. I agree with everything else you said. I feel everyone on the show at this point is acting accordingly with the exception of the one group member who has always been herself.
Kandi is business 1st mindset Tocha burning bridges my girl Kandi L. Burruss-Tucker could of put you on !!! But hey
Maybe the way ppl of a certain generation were raised it was implied that what parents say is gospel and not to be questioned is a problem.  Parents are people w vices , biases, childhood baggage etc.. We need to do better w/o kids taking it too far and (some of ya'll know you're being disrespectful) and give the kids the gift of freedom to think and evolve. But saying your the 5th member was weird
Have ya'll ever thought to just dismiss her from the group? Why put up with the back and forth? She clearly doesn't really want to be a part of it and is using the group as a fall back if her solo project doesn't work out.
https://youtube.com/@conversingwkizzy
Bottom line is latosha wants to be the Diva she has never been., now shes just bitter.
Momma Scott is a piece of work 🤦🏾‍♀️😅😩
You ever wonder why her solo projects never pan out!!! Her fans answer, hmmmm.
Kandi a busy woman Periodttt  and I can respect that.
Kandi is about her business. 😊
I love that you break that down. It makes a lotta sende
Inserting tiny "if u had a ass to kiss" 😂😂
Kandi is sooo pretty 👑🪄✨
I love Kandi but I’m still going to side with SWV on the entire co-headlining situation. This was not a tour, it was a one night only show. So bringing up “XSCAPE” as headlining was not important and it was very cocky. Yes, she has receipts of SWV opening up for them before but it was not a “SWV & XSCAPE” show, that was for something completely separate. If XSCAPE has “been” headlining then what is the big deal by co-headlining one little show for one night. Sometimes when it comes to money and business, ego’s definitely tend to get big which is unnecessary
You are a true ♉️❤😊 Me too!!
Because you are not adding them to your Tour!!!  You both came with an idea to do a tour TOGETHER!  WE TO COMPANIES DO A JOINT VENTURE TOGETHER,  THEY SPLIT SPLIT IT
Wow! That makes so much more sense now that you explained it. Thought that yall were being cocky. Very smart business woman! It pays to know the business side of things.
😂😂😂
Watching the episode Tamika was my focus she was hurting I am so happy they talk but her mom is toxic because you angry with her dad but Tamil is your child. Plus, I cried because my mom died sometimes I felt this to but my mom did not do what her mom did. But I love on my mom until her dying day I wanted them to work it out. It’s time to mend pain and heal with our parents. I hope they do too.
Kandi speaks rationally and with facts, ppl jumped all in her feelings when she was talking about BUSINESS AND MONEY
Girl, you got this haters activated this year. What’s going on? Lol… That’s what happens when you’re a bad B collecting too many coins😂 Love you❤
Definitely went back and listened to the entire 3rd album...😳 Those receipts were straight facts! I never even noticed as many times as I listened to that album 🤦🏾‍♀️
Shout out to Kempire👏🏾👏🏾 Come on Aunt Nora🙌🏽🙌🏽❤
Kandi- That's a Taurus thang because we will always speak up while the others just stand behind you saying "yeah" while pumping their fist in the air. lol
I knew Kandi would come with the receipt. She about that business.lmboooooooo
Soo again she is holding up the money. I dont like her sorry
Tocha has such dark energy. She hates u KANDI
Why do you give her energy?  Her gospel record is not going to hit. Her spirit is not right.  The anointing has to be there… and God is not the master of confusion. You were raised in the church and you know what it is. Your gospel album …. Should you choose to do one would probably hit better.  Just saying!
I love Kandi business savvy, everytime people hate she create something else great lol,  been rockin since the beginning, I love the group sound of Xcape  as well as Swv united sound, I don't know how that Solo go do for latocha a beautiful voice but a  gospel solo album with all that shadiness she's exhibiting, that's  a hard sell, just on observation alone, I love some good gospel, I like when I feel it and believe the story the artist is singing about.  that's my opinion
YASS KANDI BRING THEM RECIPTS GURL 🙌🏾🙌🏾 😂😂😂
I can not stand Tocha. She is a terrible person and sister
I DONT LIKE ROCK HEAD
Here’s the thing, your voice is and had always been unique. We, most of the viewing audience, may never understand what a musically inclined ear hears when they hear your voice but baby you can sing and carried many a tunes that I still rock til this day!
I’m really not sure why y’all decided to do a show with SWV y’all never need to share y’all platform. Kandi stop trying to help people it literally keeps backfiring in your face. Everybody you help turn around and burn you.
much Love ♥️🍭🍬🍭🍬🍬🍭🍭
When kandi said “a lot of ppl said I can’t sing” I said “who said that? Who said that?” Iykyk lol
That scene with Tamika and her mom had me feeling bad I felt so said looking at Tamika made me cry I think they can totally leave tocha behind because Kandi,Tiny, Tamika can carry that group I'm here for it I get it why Kandi felt the way about business honestly I only tuned it because of Kandi and tiny love both groups music but I'm a Kandi and tiny fan ❤
I think it’s different when it’s your tour versus you guys doing a tour/ performance together, you guys should have headline together.
I luv you Kandi but being an opening act is not the same as being a special guest.   This isn’t an Xscape tour where you are having friends/special guest appear.  This is a collaborative effort that isn’t just focused on one group, but instead two groups so the format of an Xscape tour wouldn’t and shouldn’t be the same.  No one is going to low ball your money for co-headlining a show. I can see if it was about Xscape being the opening act, but it’s about co-headlining a show with two power house groups.  That’s not going to effect your billing in the future.  SWV was right for shutting that down.    What you guys could do is have equal billing and alternate closing on nights and close in your respective cities.
We can never hate you for being straight, firm and act business wise Kandi. Take care of yours.... 😘💃
Kandi I cried too , I feel where tameka coming from and can relate
Kandi is hilarious…and brought the receipts!!!!!! She be bought that business. 😅
36:49 see that part!!!
34:43 I thought about that when I saw that clip; that would’ve been a management discussion but since there was no agreement on management best to bring it up then. Emotional intelligence we humans lack. 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
Kandi you of all people knows what it's like to have an opinionated mother
Kandi The business idealism is respectable but honestly Bags aren't at stake over headlines only Ms. TOCHA.. & Coko wasn't lying because her albums plus SWV is over 30mil Coko didn't say we lol but it ain't about that Yall already not no rinky dink acts so its never subpar or mediocre Get the bag & take the egos out because its a given business wise (w/ the right team<no vultures involved) the 6 Of yall could tour as individual groups for like the rest of yall lives on & off every year Let's not do that to each other (because if the bag being split evenly was a issue for you you actually got ulterior motives & have more than just musical & sisterhood intentions)(while the other group isn't trying to capitalize off you guys it's just a no Brainer that 2 groups who are so professional & WOMEN?????yeah) I didn't like to see that especially not from you It would've been more fitting coming from Latocha 😂 but still love you It's just so unfortunate that money comes between love You & all the ladies are inspirational Praying for healing & light in all aspect of your lives (make the money don't let it make you baby) make history This kind of tarnished my experience as a fan too That little sit down wasn't it Because yall just didn't have to do it It wasn't about them bowing down it is actually discouraging & disheartening to even propose that you guys couldn't co-top a show let alone multiple? If yall was here in LA I would run to a coshow mainly because I would be excited for the vibes & this is my 1 opinion morally but personally If I could have a job for the rest of my life or could go to a show the rest of my life It'd be w/ the SWV team & a SWV show Or both of yall combined
Kandi is always extending a hand to help, however in my opinion. Tosha is Jealous of her Kandi. Kandi went on to do well, stil giving and helping just to all but get dumped on. She always gets the last laugh.
I watched the show last night. I couldn't wait to see your recap of it. I respect your mindset because I was one of the viewers that was taken aback at your comment about headlining. Now that you've explained it, I understand it. Thanks for the explanation because you're my Taurus fave and I want to keep you as my fave especially on the RHOA. My bday is 4/22 so I hope I can get a shout out.
I feel Tocha’s husband is the reason she is doing all this. Her husband doesn’t want her to be successful. He knows that the chance of her solo career taking off is slim so he is sabotaging her success.
I yell at the tv each time Tocha smiles with SWV, frowns with her OWN money making group, and always playing victim. In my Nene voice: “GIRL! SHUT UP‼️”
f#$% Kandi,, I'm cancelling her in my life. I'll never watch anything she is on ever again
Tocha seems to have a bit of body dysmorphia.  When she was big, she had issues. Now that she’s smaller, she still insecure. I don’t think anybody can fix that but her! Tocha is acting extremely childish and deflects saying her issue was how her mom was treated. GIRL! Your mother wasn’t a bit more disrespected! Tamika deserves to be heard and she has a limit too! Mama or not!  Tocha should consider that maybe labels didn’t want to work with her, now and in the past, because she is a perpetual drama queen with major ego issues. SHE CAN SANG HER ASS OF THO!! ❤
At the end of the day, it should've been co-headline, but Xscape(Kandi) ego got in the way. We don't care about your "business" it's only one night and you couldn't cooperate.
They have over 2M more streaming numbers than Xscape. So people are listening to their music now! Not the 90's. And they are world wide.
Okay I had to say this please let Tamar make a food of herself and don’t go low. We love and respect you for you!!!!! You’re not known to be a liar unlike Tamar….. you to valuable to us
Lls hell naw kandi thought she dead 😂
I just watched the episode an I still think it's ashame...you mean to tell me for one show only... Xscape didn't want to share billing?....wow!  Since Kandi and Tiny have so many followers, it definitely would not have hurt anyone to be humble and be loyal to lifting all the women up equally for one show.  I'll say it again..play an SWV album...or any remix at a family party or BBQ and everyone will be happy.  This is more proof the black folk live by the motto crabs n the barrel...this whole situation is ego driven...and annoying and very much unnecessary.  Sickening 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢Kandi can try to explain this away but we all heard and saw the double talk and bs.  The fact that she has to compare albums as to who went gold and platinum is also highly Petty.  SWV music is undeniable...a bunch of us don't own an Xscape album.  Stop!
I did cry watching Tameka and her mom!!!! My heart was so uuggggg....
I love love love Leelee she's so real and authentic.
I can understand why SWV would accept opening for New Edition and not Xscape.  While SWV sold more records than New Edition when you get a get a New Edition concert. You get solo Bobby Brown,solo Johnny Gill, Solo Ralph Tresvant, and BBD. All them plus the group sold way more records than xscape and swv  combined plus their members solo records. New Edition is a bigger group than them in the culture
It was sad to me but I still don't feel like Tamika mom got it and I still don't feel like she's going to change.
See the thing about Kandi that messy ass people don’t get, which resonates with me WELL, is that keeping quiet is always the move! Any other move gone bring about RECEIPTS and then the drama ENDS! Kandi BEEN about her money. My girl NEVER needs to ride on ANYONE’S coat tail! And neither does TODD! Y’all really mad that this girl is bout her business, money, and her family!
❤️🙏🏾❤️🙏🏾❤️🙏🏾
When it comes to Kandi getting her money she is going to do just that.
I thought this was a one show deal that already occurred
Coco meant worldwide records. Swv were huge in Europe as well
bruh I love Kandi 😅 since season 2 of RHOA it's been the same energy. Get money, and don't lie on me😂
Shoot I jumped too at the end...
I don’t why people play with Kandi. Definitely coming with receipts. As well as business women big money bags. Stop playing w my girl❤
🗣️🗣️speak on it kandi!!!!!!
Co heading is fair for one night. Split it down the middle. Yeah Xscape don’t need Tocha to continue. I am loving this show and hope they continue next year
Not a Kandi fan most of the time but appreciated this breakdown
It looks like they supported you guys because they are your friends. I think because xscape can never get their group right it’s a rare appearance so you should get more but SWV is definitely the bigger group
I still think the tocha and the mama is foul
I had to come back and comment. I was watching Roland Martin on his most recent Breakfast Club interview. He literally said the same thing you did. He said once you do something for a lower rate you can’t come back and ask for more. So if Xscape rate is higher than SWV, and you take a lower rate than what you normally request, you can’t come back and get the rate you normally receive. That would be a dumb business move. SWV needs to ask how they can get a higher rate!
Your a business woman
They should have Co-Headlined. Period. SWV has bigger hits that are still played on the radio today. Kandi & Tiny are more relevant as celebrities/personalities in 2023. So it evens out. Let the managers and lawyers handle the fees/money behind the scenes. They are about to miss out on a bag.
This would have been a great time for Kandi to bring SWV up to the same booking rate if they wanted to co-sign. Could have negotiated with the promoters…just a thought.
👎🏾 and it was tacky the way you brought it up!
I admit I got emotional watching it... I shedded a tear or two....
You do have a very distinctive voice Kandi! While LaTocha can sing, your voice makes those songs pop! They would not be the same without your voice…no shade all facts
Flat out Kandi is wrong…receipts have already been out there swv streams more and Xscape does not always headline…. It’s a one night only show….this is not rhoa babe
Kandi I love the business woman that you are! As soon as you spoke up during the episode, I never questioned it for one second! Keep handling business and let those who can’t be mad! 🤷🏾‍♀️😂😍
KANDI IS BUSINESS SHARK DONT PLAY WIT IT !!!!!!!!!!!
Maybe there was a way to bring both female groups up financially without the hierarchy. Believe it or not, SWV is a major draw, they are more musically acclaimed, have major music anthems from weddings, soundtracks, and on, and have far more Spotify streams to this day (Spotify didn’t exist in the 90s so the ticker started around 2015). SWV is 90s R&B and many in childhood weren’t able to see them live but can afford to now.  The conversation made it seem like they had nothing to offer (even though you didn’t say that). It devalued their worth to music today. I know the concert eventually happened because I saw it but this is disappointing
I think Kandi was right to bring up money and business.  We all know that Kandi is business person and is always going to be on top of it.  Keep handling your business Kandi as far as the business is concern.
LOVE YOU ❤️   KANDI  SWEET DIVA LOVE THE SHOW !!!
Tell em Kandi. I Love IT!!
Im glad to gear her breakdown the headlining thing. So I now understand,because I was thinking it was one show.
I know about that sibling rival and the parents in the middle. I pray they work it out. ❤
Okay that's wonderful Riley is branching out in business part of music which can also lead into other areas of Entertainment as a whole. Love it. Come through Ms. Riley.
This project is so much bigger than the money and headlining to me. I feel that there should be humility to co headline and make history. I understand there's business but there also time for things bigger than us
For someone so boring kandi stay in the news cycle.
Riley should be an entertainment lawyer. Best of both worlds
Kandi always with the facts. Ppl always have opinions on something that they are not knowledgeable about. Just following what the masses are saying smh
Yall were so WRONG bringing drama to SWV like that and fighting amongst yourselves...so petty! Not thinking about the fans...TYPICAL.
It’s interesting How Neuromelanin Individuals Are always projecting their own lives on to someone else trying to deprive them of success I didn’t say gospel Makes an individual great. But deep down This Has always been LaTocha’s Scott’s dream solo and successful since she was a very young girl and I think that everyone has a right to find there dreams Despite the drama between the two sisters God is in control but you can’t please people because if you were in favor of her and she was doing all the right things you still would’ve Supported her endeavors my grandmother always said damn if you do and damned if you don’t. Many blessings To LaTocha her family And The beautiful sisters of Both SWV And Xscape much love❤
I haven’t even watched the episode YET but I’m here 😩😂❤
I get the business but kandi definitely give bully vibes lol
Todd said it best, she’s mad that she isn’t who Kandi turned out to be.  Kandi was the youngest of the four and made things happen. Period!! Tosha thought her voice alone would lead to success, but on the words of NeNe Leakes, “you never win when you play dirty!  You never win!”
With all due respect to Kandi and Xcape that explanation of the headlining issue doesnt make sense. SWV were guests on the Xcape tour so they were already established as the headliners. People bought tickets to see Xcape and guests. Those were Xcape fans. If Xcape were invited on SWV tour then it would be the same scenario. They should co-headline bc the tour is about the both of them.
Tocha flat out played y'all with her shady self.... period
In all honestly . No one is checking for LaTocha as a solo artist . She ain’t playing her cards rights
Ahhh the real Kandi shows herself u can only hide for so long
MANNNN LISTEN FROM 39:00 TO 39:32 KANDI GOT ME DYINGGG LAUGHING I LOVE HER EXPRESSIONS 😅😅😅😅
I don't think the fans need Tocha. SWV, and Xscape 3... is fine.
Their mother is delusional and needs therapy....
I respect Kandi is always about her business. My opinion about SWV 'opening' or performing in the daytime has got to be more about them knowing their audience isn't coming to late shows cuz we got stuff to do and not about staying out late at music festivals! I'll be in my bed thank you 😊
Your so manipulative Kandi we see it
Omg i love Kempire so much
The level of disrespect from La Trollsha is unwarranted from our (The fans) POV. Obviously there's a lot of history and things we will never know but she comes across like a malcontent person. She should be more grateful for her blessings! You guys can smash it with or without her! She's not the second coming..Damn!
I believe TAMAR 🙃
Hands down Kandi is the queen finally she got her crown Kandi took care of her mom the hole ride not only that but gave her an out let to get out her money  yasssss she give jobs to her community   she put young women men in college hunny  yass yasss
This is why i f$&king love Kandi, i will forever back my dog up period. She gon always do and advocate for what’s right and what’s fair plus come with receipts. You can’t do nothing but respect her. 😂😂 and for the record she can definitely sing her album is fire classic R&B. Ain’t Nuthing like it❤❤❤  Ace is suuper cutie 🥰 please follow him cause i do.
Just to show respectfully it’s ticket sales over record sales and that’s the tea it’s the tickets that bring more money in 💵  No disrespect to SWV but I totally get Kandi’s point.
I don’t watch the show but loving your breakdown of it. Makes me feel like I’m watching the show.
She got one foot in the door and out and that ain’t fair. She would get the boot.
Im not going to lie, when Kandi brought up who should headline the show i looked at her as arrogant. I still love her but i thought she was arrogant.  However after watching this video and seeing the receipts I now understand why she said what she said and I agree.
@kandi... You really be speaking on it Chile! When I say Toscha is a walking contradiction...smh... I'm just totally disappointed with her... One thing that I love and admire about you... Is your honesty and transparency...  Keep pulling those receipts hunni and you damn sho is momma Joyce's daughter... Cause y'all ain't got no damn filter! 😂😂😂
I really felt sad for Tamika when she was talking to her mother because her mother yelling at her like she was a child.  Also I think her mother hugged her because she was on camera and she thought it would make her image look good.
I love Kandi she’s not perfect but she’s real.
That episode made me cry too cause I know exactly how tamika feel
Kandy tear up because she has the same relationship with her own mother. Parents worried about the bag!
https://youtu.be/wpVFDgVB8KM What happened? Please talk about it on "Speak On It."
Good job.  Love the backstory.
I may the only who thinks you are comparing apples to oranges. Being a special guest on someone's tour does not mean that one is more or less a headliner than the other. This was supposed to be a collaboration according to the conversation we were privy too, so why not just coheadline is how most of us were thinking. I think you have made some good points, BUT they are not with all the information for us (the public) to make an informed decision. SWV should address the points you made because I am sure they have reasoning that only they know for each point you made. I would love to hear it.  Good luck, ladies.
This Speak On It session should be called "Perspective". Kandi Yams, you brought wisdom, life pearls and perspective to what entertainers go through in the industry. I enjoy all your episodes but this one hits!🙏🏾💯
I fucking love @kandi 😂 she’s all business first😉. When it comes to business you have to leave personal feelings, egos, etc. at the door. ❤️❤️❤️
So you don’t like kandi but you use her popularity to get xscape back on to later go solo? GOTCHA
Let Tocha Ruffin do her thang! Bye Chile.
But Kandi..despite YOU and TINY reality shows that boost ya'll followers and yall successful tour DON'T takeaway from SWV who were still hitting their numbers with only just singing AND singing alone no following at all and they were making history just fine...So why they wouldn't sell TICKETS is mind boggling.
When people say Kandi can't sing, I direct them to 'My Little Secret'.....with them Mariah Carey///Ariana Grande octaves👍🏾
KandiRain definitely has a voice. It’s super distinctive… Listen to Mariah Carey’s Always be my Baby Remix❤
Come thru with the receipts Kandi.... and I do love both groups as well. Business is Business.
Kandi gonna always break it DOWN!!!! Gloria had me crying in frustration. Tamika knew her mama is full of BS!
Kandi stop tryna play SWV.
It's about business not talent
That is shady, in my opinion.
TEAM KANDI!! I hope we get a speak on it about the Tamar BS with some shady receipts & all! MENTION IT ALL🗣🔊 INCLUDING HER GETTING BE** UP BY JERMAINE DUPRI'S  STEP MOM WHEN SHE WAS HAVING THAT AFFAIR WITH HIS DAD‼‼😂🤣😂🤣 SINCE SHE KEEPS SAYING SPEAK ON IT & HOW U WON’T ADDRESS IT‼️TELL HER ADDRESS THAT & HER EX THAT GOT A RESTRAINING ORDER ON HER! & had him address the JD issue with K Michelle on a zoom with Jasmine Brand or something! She got a habit of getting her man’s involved in everything! Admitted she can’t fight but stays running her mouth & then says she’s a different person now ! Tamar got some nerve.  Entitled IMMATURE spoiled BRAT that will NEVER GROW UP‼‼Soon as she seen an OPPORTUNITY with that snake to get back on TV she wanted to top him off & go after Kandi!! I used to like her till i realized how she really is like her FAMILY always said.
Kandi still sped past those albums sales and international concert receipts for some reason.
I fucking love Kandi!! Hoes be really hating low key how can u not love her authenticity. She truly genuine af!
Kandi is about her business and money, she knows her s**t. I knew there was more behind that scene
In regards to Tasha, yes she should have verbally communicated her feelings. But everyone sees what it is, so we wish her the best in her solo endeavors. In regards to headliners, clearly y'all don't agree so just move on.  No one has to be disrespectful. I rather never see you guys sing together again than to see each other feuding on these platforms like this. It is what it is.
COME FOR THE BURRUSS AND GET EMBARRASSED! YOU CAN HAVE THIS! T-shirts & Mugs baby!
And people want to speak ON KANDI'S CREW......THIS IS WHY SHE HAS HER LOYAL CREW.....RECEIPTS.  DON JUAN IS GOING TO PULL OUT PROFF.  🤣😂🤣
Kandi on the business side you did what you supposed to had done! Problem is people don't understand the business side of it!
As an attorney, I hope Riley pursues both… a career in the music industry plus a JD/law license goes a long way. You can do so much and have instant credibility with a law license. Blessings!
I don’t know if you said this already but just curious about the shows you guys are headlining. Did you guys headline on your own tours and they were featured acts? In those cases I would think of course you would headline on your own tours. Just curious about if the shows you were headlining were your own shows.
CANDY I know that you THANK GOD for BLESSING YOU not only with GREAT VOCALS, but A GREAT BUSINESS BRAIN too. 😊  THANK YOU JESUS FOR BLESSING CANDY WITH HER GIFTS.  GOD BLESSED US ALL WITH SEVERAL GIFTS, just ASK JESUS TO STIR UP THE GIFTS INSIDE OF YOU.  He will do it TRUST, GOD WILL DO IT. WE MUST HAVE PATIENT THOUGH.
As much as I want Tamika and Mom mend their relationship! I felt her Mom only apologized because it was for the cameras! But hey hopefully it can remain fruitful!
You'd have to be a hater to not love this woman
I felt emotions in the first scene. I felt and saw a little girl trying to talk to her mother. I felt bad but hope they get it together.
Even after her explanation...I still feel like co-headlining would've been better. Especially since the tv show is equally promoting both groups. I get her point about SWV opening for them 5 yrs ago & Coko acted like she'd never opened for them..Oh well, looks like the tour didn't happen.
I always find myself on Kandi’s side 🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️
Keep telling your truth, you always uplift people &they turn around & shit on you, but time after time,you will give someone else a chance, stay blessed!!
SWV felt like because it was their 30-year anniversary, and they were inviting you all to their event, and that's why they felt they should headline. Definitely understand why Kandi said what needed to be said in the meeting.  It was business no disrespect intended.
Keep on keepin on was my ringtone for years , i cut it up and gave diffrent parts to people, that i have to say , one the best from Lyte and im from the old school😊
Yall might as well change this title to *"Kandi Koated Facts"* cause BAY-BEHHH!!!!.... The receipts be RECEIPT-ING! #WeSeeEachOthaaahhh Lol😘✌🏾
I admire Kandi's transparency and how she broke everything down! I love both groups but after hearing Kandi speak from a business perspective, I certainly side with her especially considering that SWV previously had been opening for Xscape anyway. SWV took things personally when in actuality it's just business.
These mothers really need help , wow
Don’t usually comment but since she has @KEMPIRE in the opening of the show!!! He’s from NY & love his take on current events… Love it!!!
Are you African American?😅
To keep it 💯 the Managers should have been negotiating the Billing and $$$. Kandi should not have to speak for Xscape By Herself.  the bottom line is SWV nor Tocha would be on Bravo doing this show without Kandi and Tiny being who they are to the culture and the new generation.....
Kandi is strictly facts and business.  She is the “BOSS BITCH” I love it!
Thanks for explaining it all in detail Kandi everything makes more sense now . I'm glad you have these videos so you can add more context to everything we see on the show.
Just like her song. Fly Above, Kandi, is just awesome with everything she put her hands on. I will never understand why anyone come for Kandi. Those are the ones that can’t take honesty, and can’t handle anything given to them straight forward with no sugar. It’s like this world today, need everything handed to them, and when it’s handed to them, it better have sugar covering it up to the point you can’t even see what you really getting. It’s just sad. It’s bad enough, a black woman always has to hear, she too strong, she too hard, she this , she that. But what’s even more sad, is the fact that there are some black woman who can’t stand to see another black woman do her thing, and be a cheerleader for her, when you see that she is building her empire on her own. Kandi, never let anyone stop her from reaching her goals for herself and her life. Kandi take those negative people and their negative comments to help her keep right on building. She uses all that negativity too make her fortune. And I don’t blame her! I’m sure she smile at all of them inside, with a Thank you. Kandi is someone I have no problem allowing my daughter to admire. Kandi drive,and determination, is something worth admiring. This stuff with Tamar, Carlos, JasonLee, and everyone else with something negative to say about Kandi, need to be taking notes on the what  and the how to be a whole and totally complete person, who has a heart to help people, not tiring people down. And note how to look over those who only want to drag you and make your life just as sad and miserable as theirs. Kandi, you know you are great, cause her name is great. You are great cause, they can’t keep you out of their mind. You are great, because they keep elevating you, everytime they speak negative against you. You are great Kandi, because it is you and your name that bring attention to them. You are great Kandi, damn it because they are looking to see what great accomplishment you are about to make today and everyday!! Keep letting they watch and learn  Kandi. Luv ya sis
I understand your frustration with riley wanting to go into music management!... but!!!    her mom and dad's blood is full of the love of music!!! she can't avoid it!❤
Kandi don’t have to say one word…just look at her facial expressions 🤣🤣🤣
Kandi missed that when you look at top billing they compare music to music, like when Whitney and Mariah did they duet Whitney got top billing on the first round or press so it was fair, she was an A list movie stars with 4 block buster movies under her belt she started in ,but they compared music vs music Mariah had put out an album every year and had more number 1s yet at the time Whitney sold more albums. But the billing was split evenly off the music not including Whitney's movies and tv which made her clearly a bigger star.   So Xscape vs SWV musically 30 million sold vs 7 million sold you actually would be the openers and this  is SWVs idea and you on swvs treality show!   This why Xscape never made it far they think they name hold more weight then it really does. In the 90s y'all was Aaliyah compared to SWV and Envogue who were brandy and Monica. In that order!
Clearly we can see the hate for someone to say Kandi can't sing 😅
As far as business goes Toscha is so damn unprofessional and it’s obvious why people don’t want to work with her
14:11 when talking about Toscha and Coko going solo.... THE ATTITUDE IS THE SAME.
Da fact that they tried Kandi, knowing she is a Business Woman 🙄 & what everyone is missing: Is the fact that they sat down to discuss management & Tochi wanted to pray about it, but never came back to tell us what GOD said 😳😊 #TeamKandi 💚
Thank you for always clarifying the madness with facts.
You explain the business aspect of it truthfully. To me in the scene on the show , in the approach of explaining, made me feel as though you thought that SWV was not worthy of co-head lining the show with Xscape. I commend Tiny (even though Tiny was against the co-head lining as well ) saying maybe that was not a good time to talk about the business aspect. I know about the business of concerts/shows being promoted and all of the intricate details of getting the concert to an audience. Even though Xscape and SWV has performed on shows together, I truly believed that this concert would have been phenomenally special with a great production. It would have been something for the music industry books. The verses was wonderful. Always a thankful and eternal love for SWV and Xscape for bringing a sound track to so many people lives.
Love you and respect you. Tauruses are never afraid to talk business. Made perfect sense and feelings are not facts!
We still love you Kandi,  but you can't be THAT B*TCH in EVERYTHING!🤷🏾‍♀️
I personally don’t want to see y’all perform with Tosha, y’all better off with the 3
" WOW",  thanks for explaining the "business" , side of things. Im a student in life regardless of my age , I love to learn, I also know KBT, that your a "straight shooter" an I like how Tiny had your back in reiterating your statement. Good job 👍🏾& thnx again
I love me some Kandi but SWV would command an arena too I think if they all toured as much as SWV
Ah, I love when Kandi puts her business acumen on display. It's why there was a whole class taught behind her business decisions.
No one can deny Kandi is the most logical business savy woman in this group. You’re inspiring!
Rocky walked into the studio like the clowns from Universe Soul Circus... like man gone somewhere with all that extra. I couldn't do nothing but laugh and smh
They should have co-headlined the end
Kandi about that $$$!!! PERIODT. Facts. I ain’t mad at cha. Love it. That’s why she where she at today. Being seen everywhere. She like puff Daddy all on the radio, all on the videos, all on the tv shows, all on the big screen, movies, stage plays, restaurants, etc. just name it, she done did, done & won & still winning. Werk Kandi Werk. You can’t get mad at someone who knows  their value, their worth, who knows what they bring to the table. She is the table. Aint no escape without Kandi & ain’t no show without Kandi. There is an escape without Tosha. & in that order. Tosha need to stop fronting like she don’t need them coins because we all know Ricky ain’t got no job.
I'm not saying Kandi couldn't sing back in the days. But I think she took singing lessons recently. I'm a fan of Kandis & Tiny's, but they're not the best singers in the group.  Im sorry. It's the truth.
I love Swv....... But  I'm confused about  these comments saying Kandi/ Xscape is out of pocket cause swv sold more records back in the day . Cause Kandi just said when they were on the same show ( with other artist not an xscape show ) Swv would always  OPEN  during the day and xscape would be later on in the night..... So that says alot..... If that's the case ,its about more than just record sales.....
I mean, no shade to NOBODY, but… Tho BBD is it’s OWN entity, THOSE members will ALWAYS be New Edition, who were out wayyyyy before them ALL, & if THEY didn’t mind opening?… Tho I understand how those things needed to be discussed between the ladies BEFORE hand too so🤷🏾‍♀️…
If Xscape is so big and bad then why did y'all need opening acts anyway? How do you know that SWV and BBD were not part of the draw that led to y'all selling out those arenas? It's not like you guys did it alone.
Omg!! I laughed so hard when Kandi jumped😂..her expressions 😂
Kandi please don’t address Tamar on your show Tamar wants attention, let her argue with herself Tamar have always been so exhausting to watch she make me tired 🙄
Kandi low key throwing shade at SWV. Let's talk about you and Tamar....speak on that. 🗣🗣🗣🗣 with that comment about Coko being the only lead singer, bit they sold 30 million records 🤬 in my Coko voice.
The worst thing Tocha did was let the girls see they can do it without her evil ass! Tamika sings her parts just as beautifully and WE LIKE HER!!! Ain’t nobody checking for Tocha’s album. But I can see Kandi’s point though. They’re more relevant now and Xscape brings the special guests sometimes (T.I. Etc.).
I just want to know if Tocha was insecure about her butt size, why she always has it out? Why she don't cover it up? She knows darn well her sister wasn't trying to body shame her.
Fire the whole crew for that 🎊🎊🎊🎉🎉 🐂 💩!!😭😭😭
🎉🎉🎉🎉👑👑👑🖤🖤
Ok Kandi cause my panties was in a bunch you hear me! 🤣 I did understand what you were saying business wise on the show but it sounded like tiny was about saying they don't have as many fans to show up and show out. And it did sound like a one time show where it sound like y'all are on equal footing. That ending made me side and had me side eyeing y'all for real, lol! But Kandi stay helping us with the receipts. I guess girl. Let me gone and go to bed happy now, lmao!
Thank you Kandi for this information I was like swv had hits
Yes ma'am  they opened in OKC.  I  was there, and I was so there for Xscape that I didn't even pay attention who else was going to be there. Xscape all the way.❤😊
I see that shade with them microphones….. is the short one for Tiny 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Tosha feel she should be where Kandi at Tiny comfortable she have  her own money and name and  Ti ,  it's whatever she stuck in the middle Tosha might be the better singer but clearly Kandi don't need the group Tosha upset she  want to go solo she only making a gospel album because her so call dreams being a famous Rnb singer career flop facts
One thing for sure is that SWV clearly needs to make sure they're being paid what they are worth. The fans spoke in an overwhelming way today. They should have never partners with Xscape. kandi is clearly trying rewrite 90’s history. Escape even tried to do a versus with TLC and it was shut down.
No Mrs Joyce the 5th member lady we love mama Joyce first.😅 Yes popular means more then ticket sales and Kandi and Tiny are very popular.
First all kandi business women 🤔🤔
I won hundred percent agree with Kandi!!! and I love the way she have those receipts and the way she breaks it down and explains it for everyone to understand. After hearing the speak on it Xscape should be the headliner.
Please continue to handle your business period.
Kandi why are you giving  so much energy to Tasha move on and quit talking about that lady.. geeshhh
Ok, so first of all, I respect Kandi as a business woman on many levels and I’m a fan of Xscape’s music. The “who’s more popular on social media and reality tv now” argument makes sense, but it’s most def not valid in all cases. For example, TLC don’t have as many followers as Kandi/Tiny or a reality tv presence etc, but because of their musical impact and commercial success alone, they’re still able to headline and co-headline tours and get top billing at festivals both in the US and internationally. In fact, the lovers and friends festival mentioned that Xscape and SWV performed at (i had VIP tickets), TLC co-headlined on the main stage on both dates. I say all of this just to point out that having a strong social media following and reality tv show presence don’t automatically grant the ability to headline a show/tour or get high billing on a festival. In cases like with TLC specifically, the music alone can override all of that.
I love me some Kandi !!!!!!
I’m confused about the fan base you speak of Kandi.  Y’all got the same fan base let’s not make it seem like it’s the OMG girlz wanting to co headline. SWV fans are Xscape fans. Idc what reality Tv show your on, the fans are the same. So yeah i don’t get it.  The fact that they sell out 50 tour dates a year says we as fans still support SWV.  And they sold millions more records, yea I’m totally confused. I love both groups and y’all should  be co-headlining. Now let’s run down Xscape.  1. Lead singer Tosha doesn’t want no parts. Strike 1 2. Kandi you are the only relevant member most recognized from rhoa.  3. Tiny is married to a Snitch. 4. Y’all sold a few million less albums So yea be humble sis
Kandi, thank you for explaining the business side and helping take emotions out.   It was interesting that SWV didn’t have a problem with the male group New Edition headlining although they sold fewer records.   So sad that women lack business acumen and are quick to get messy.
SWV'S music is undeniable.  They have too too many back to back hits for Kandi and Tiny to disrespect SWV.   A SWV album will make an entire family cookout live.  Put on an SWV song right now...and see what happens.  Every body will start swaying.
Kandi spoke truth. I’m a much bigger fan of SWV than Xscape, however Kandi and Tiny definitely have much more of a social media presence that has opened them up to newer and younger fans. My only issue Kandi is y’all trying to throw shade about it. Btw SWV has had sold old headlining performances in Chicago and Baltimore I’ve been to both concerts.
I'm definitely looking at Kandi side eyed right now... Im definitely unsubscribing!!!! Disappointed!!!
It's business and it needed to be asked  and Kandi is all for business and I am team Kandi ❤
And Cheryl can really sing you and Tiny basically just harmonize , Everyone knows the Scott sisters are the real voices behind Escape . regardless of how many songs you used to lead on . Your touring based on the past so you should be operating based on it not what you think is revenant today cuz y’all ain’t got no music and SWV are hotter than y’all just the song Anything featuring Method Man on of NYC most hottest rappers till this day try legend so that makes them untouchable y’all better recognize and  y’all tried it !
Why should they continue to open for you all? That shit gets old!!!!! #Selfish#
Ok, Mrs. Kandi-CVS Receipts Burress Tucker! 😅 I understand what you mean about the business side. I was thinking about it the way you said it at the end. They were probably thinking about it being on the tv show and wanting that show to be split because of the tv show. Now, a tour is different but it’s all above my head. 😂
I understand what your saying Kandi but SWV is a bigger group to me sorry not sorry and a lot of people feel that way and that’s why people was on your head
I don’t know why they mad at Kandi … it’s business
It makes sense on a tour that was an Xsape tour that your guests would open. If a tour was discussed as a collaborative then why would SWV open on a collaborative tour? There's a difference
The fans don't care about headliners, this is a group effort. Headline your own show. We're coming to see all so distribute the money evenly. We don't care about the logistics!!! Greed is one of the seven Deadly Sins!!!
Kandi girl I’m my best khis voice now you know you and Tiny need to stop. Tiny and Ti are scandalous in these streets with all their sex scandals and  pill popping so girl please  smh so what fan base and the record sales speak for itself  cuz y’all don’t have new fans from the New generation anyway . Escapes fan base is 45 years old nobody younger than that are fans of y’all’s smh like what following fan base , and it’s about the music cuz RHOA is trash and has been so years before NeNe left the show and Tiby shoe eas canceled years ago lol Sorry but please humble yourselves !
I would love to know how much there gonna get paid for the show
Yeah they can still perform together but what about Who Can I Run Too?
I love everything about kandi ❤❤❤you go girl
Y’all should just make it a 3 person group and fire tocha….she messing up the vibe and Tamika can sing her parts just as well
I love you Kandi
Kandi it's one thing to "have difficult business conversations" but you go from being a logical business woman to being unnecessarily messy. That is why you stay rubbing people the wrong way! You're not as innocent as you think you are a lot of times
When X-scape was part of the soundtrack of a certain era of your life, you knew ALL of them can sang.  It is sad though when ego gets involved. Their whole discography speaks for itself and Kandi's writing credits speaks for itself.
Yes Kandi, you and Tiny have shows.  Does that mean you and Tiny get paid more than Tamika and Toha?
This breaks my heart well money money money money that’s what’s important Fuck Respect and the people who paved the way amazing
Xscape.  Don't tour with SWV. Too much drama. Let it go and see what happens. And Yes kandi, you can sing.
Kandi have that kinda power to shut down someone’s else project. You a bad B**** 😅😅😂
It’s only because y’all have reality TV shows that’s the only reason, but I love y’all so much and I love them so much but that’s the only reason is because y’all have reality TV shows
Yeah that was tough to watch with Tameika and her mom. And I felt for lee lee. And I definitely loved the way Kandi is about the money. SWV was bigger back then but kandi and tiny have more fallowing now. I wouldn’t go to see SWV at a show now, but I’d go to see Escape.
I said Kandi about that business from the gate. I can’t expect anything else and yeah I knew the Don was coming too! ❤❤❤I told y’all I was scammed because SwV can’t touch Xscape. If the truth disrespectful then I’m real disrespectful. Come on now my sister was a SWV fan back in the day ,my 22 year old  today is an Xscape fan . Now SwV had two good songs but Xscape has many  we can sang too!. If only I sounded good 🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️❤️💯
“good for her” 😂😭
Mamma is scary.  And she is supposed to be religious?  😖
Keep bringing them receipts, Kandi! 💅🏾✨️ #speakonIt
Tamika mom is another momma Joyce
Kandi is genius when come to her business mindset!!! She knows the ends and outs of business, which is why she is Miles ahead of all these ladies!! I greatly appreciate your boss Bull energy , I Love how you’ve created and held on to your own narrative. Life is not who people tell you are, it’s who you show up and BE everyday and with that your success will follow!!
Kandi is THE BOSS!
At first I was pissed and thought Kandi was pulling rank but when she pulled out the receipts, I said okay. Her points are valid. I also realized that Xscape has a few more,bangers thus making them headline worthy. More songs=more performances= longer stage time =$$cha ching💵💰
I am loving Taj, she is kind of the de facto leader of everything and she seems so cool. I could watch a reality show about Taj and her family. Leelee seems pretty awesome too I can see her on RHOA. I definitely was side eyeing my girl kandi (which is something I’ve never done before) when it came to that whole headlining or co headlining thing. But kandi broke it down as far as a tour is concerned cause I didn’t understand why they couldn’t co-headline, but I get it. I guess it was more so like Tiny said, the delivery was off. Tocha solo song sounds cute, but her attitude honestly makes me not want to buy her album. Also, I see that xscape is going to be in Orlando, co headlining with Tyrese. So does this mean xscape and Tyrese get top billing? I think xscape has sold more records than Tyrese but maybe him being in the fast and furious movies makes him as relevant as xscape. 🤷🏽‍♀️
WTF!!!⁉️⁉️⁉️
XSCAPE IS A BEAUTIFUL GROUP TO MMMEEEEE!!!!GET@ME!!
BACK IN THE 90s.....HAD ME HOLLERING..... KANDY WAS THROWING SHADE...NO SHADE😂😂😂😂😂
Kandi  I agree! It was a touching episode I agree. Tamika & her mom sit down did move me to tears. I’m sure it was a combination of my mom recently passing.😢 We were super close. ❤ I don’t understand Tamika position no child should ever feel like they are second to a sibling. Prayerful there’s peace in the process.  Tocha for some reason just don’t seem genuine to me. God bless her journey. God bless them all!🙏🏽❤️
I stopped watching these reality shows which it's NOT it's ALL scripted. Y'all go ahead make that 💰💰💰💰💰
I'm confused, Xscape touring by themselves... If they are doing solo concerts and selling out, that is very impressive 👏🏿 👌🏾 👍🏾
@KandiOnline thanks for elaborating and clarifying the business aspect of the concert and tours.  I now understand.
I have "Understanding" now! It is sad how bravo doesn't show all of what is being said and keeps a lot out of the publics viewing. Keep Speakin on it. And know LaTocha is jealous of Kandi's writing skills and also jealous of her sister Tamika!!!!!!
Congratulations Kandi on being the 1st  woman on  "Club Shay Shay" unc shannon sharpe
Kandi Yams gone break it down cause at the end of the day this is BUSINESS!
the voice edits when Kandi does Tocha..have me like😂🤣😂🤣
Business is business and Kandi is a business woman...period! Social media now dictates who's relevant and who's not. And to sum things up...Xscape has more followers! Therefore, they are MORE LIKELY to draw concert goers. I went to the Xscape tour, and I was happy to see SWV and sang all of their songs, but I was there to see Xscape.
❤❤❤love Kandi she gonna get you guys straight everytime... With facts & receipts real life real facts real people real life real love  and real buisness......🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉congrats Kandi....
I use to always tell my mom that , I could hear kandi over everybody especially that last album. Thank you for giving facts & not being scared to *Speak on it* tosha use to be my favorite but honestly this show made me not even like her! Her attitude is giving keke Wyatt..beautiful voice bad ahh  attitude
Please release “only for you”💛💛
Kandi is going to ALWAYS have receipts. Also I love the edits.
You was out here singing BACKUP for KKKim yet you can’t co-headline. Girl I’m NEVER coming back to any of those restaurants you got again because girl what.
I literally cried and I don’t know them.  It was a lot. It’s really hard to talk to your mom, but also it means so much for a mom to say she loves you because sometimes you just need to hear it. It’s also hard when your mom has a strong personality cuz sometimes when they say they love you, it seems like a command.
Kandi Drop the song,  and stop teasing us!!!
Nope. The receipts aren’t receipting! SWV were considered ‘Special Guests’. Don’t try to demote them to opening acts. SWV disrespect will not be tolerated.   Plus, Coko said she will not be opening. She said nothing about having opened for Xscape in the past.
Kandi please tell people to buy Tamar album and watch her stupid show so she can sit her thirsty behind down somewhere
Kandi looks like the joker win she smiles.😬
Share the Love. Is this your Tour? Just asking
Why is Tamar attacking you now? Can you clear up this new mess?
Truthfully both groups had their share of hits. I don't see what the big deal is. Perhaps they should take turns headlining if it matters that much.. Perhaps they should just forget about who's headlining or opening and just put on an amazing show . The fans or coming out to see all of the groups.
https://youtu.be/JuBPT9rwtNY
Kandi is a BONAFIDE BUSINESS Woman!! That's why she is filthy rich 💰! Yall better take notes 📝 😂...
I didn’t finish my post on the last vid for, but I don’t think people buy her album because of her attitude, Tocha has a beautiful voice but her attitude doesn’t match the voice
Also Kandi Blaze has your whole face she's your twin mini me
😂😂 in the UNITED STATES. 😎
Great video Kandi and keeping shining as this beautiful flower Boss you are
One thing about Kandi will break down the facts with receits and will make it make sense,Like Tocha can go solo gospel all she want,but she can't go to God half stepping,the God I serve,which it's only one God,he don't play with half stepping,Tocha got to be made whole and repent,tgen she will be free,Xscape is not her problem that she's smothering,it's clearly it's her crocked husband is the one she trying to break free from,Tohca do have an amazing,incrediable voice but all of the Xcape group are amazing,and incrediable,Kandi girl you are A Boss Boss for real.Mrs.Harris and Tamaika is amazing and Incrediable too.💖💖💞💞🌹🌹🌹👍👍👍🔥🔥🔥💫💫💫✨️✨️✨️✨️🌟🌟🌟God bless all yall gorgeous ladies of course Mrs.Harris is my favorite it's something about her sweet down to eartj soul for me
Let me just say I wish you all the best Love both groups since I was a little girl in the 90s!! I hope everything works out and y'all do the tour for the love of music ,for the Culture!!All y'all stay beautiful and blessed!!! ❤♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
Kandi you wrong... just seems like y'all were meeting with SWV under false pretenses... they got blindsided...they opened up for you under different circumstances... you only sold out arenas cause you bought the best acts with you... smh
Ok cool! Thanks for breaking it down Kandi. #teachme
Amen.  I agree with you. You are the business woman and you are about your business.  As you should be.  That's why you're successful. 🎉👏
Thanks for breaking that down now it makes sense I wouldn't take a pay cut either...If that's the case we will continue to do our own thing before that happen
Kandi about her business! Period….point blank!
Love you Kandi girl... Lol keep up the good work.  May God continue to bless you and Xscape.  Keep being the woman that you are.  ❤🙏
I know I may be commenting too much but, for that concert ya'll did in Columbia SC some years ago.... I went to see Tamar and Monica truth be told. Not saying that ya'll did not do great. But they were who I went to see. Maybe its who ya'll pair with for these concerts being the headliner that makes ya'll sell out. I say that to say humble yourself on that. Everyone is not coming to see ya'll cause I sure as hell was not.
Kandi is sharp!  ⭐
I agree with Kandi. When it comes to business all that personal stuff is out the door. I would have discussed the headline and opening act as well.
Vindication looks good on you @Kandi
Business is Business and if we being real here, swv only came back during versus and got renotified only at that time but Kandi and Tiny been having CURRENT viewers and followers with CURRENT reality shows so hands down , they should headline period
All I am saying is I went to the last tour with yall Monica, and Tamar and in Columbia SC and will be at the one coming up also. I loved it.
I get it Kandi business wise now that you explain it. And true the comment should not have been made about the most record sales. However, Kandi since you know they never headlined... I mean would it hurt y'all to finally give them the chance to do their big one and let them co-headline? I mean I'm just asking is it going to hurt yall business wise or no? And if not then why not BIG UP your Big sistas and give them some of the shine they deserve it too! Kandi yall make money! And I 'm not trying to count ya'll wallet but damn! Where's the sista empowerment. I mean Jordan had to retire so Kobe could shine. Ijs.... I love you Kandi frfr! and all of Xscape and SWV. Ladies please work this out for history sake, it's going to be magical!
I love how you be about your business! It's not called friend-ness, it's called business and you be handling yours. 😊 yesss lady!
I love Kandi and she definitely have a point.. She be coming with the receipts baby.. its no disrespect its business!!
Common sense ain’t common Kandi remember that
The breakdown makes complete sense but.. The way the show is being presented it makes sense for it to be a co-headlining..
But Kandi my question is, do you really think she is leaving anyone in the dust? I mean she keeps saying she has the more powerful voice but clearly everyone else looked outside of their voices to make things happen while it looks like she took orders from her husband to place blame as to why her career has not taken off like she wanted it.
Facts week after week Kandi that’s why they really mad ‼️
This is why Kandi is such a successful business woman. She’s all about taking care of business, and give no FK’s about who don’t like it. Keep the personal feelings out of it, and get the money!!!
Kandi is the freaking truth.... Hate her or love her SHE'S ALWAYS BEING REAL... LIARS AND PEOPLE WITH MOTIVES usually always run from the situation to hide from having to lie or pretend... Smh... Tocha needs help and hopefully this album helps her find a solid understanding of what it is to be saved / real!!!!
That cut away to Tiny reading that "if you had an a** to kiss " text and her laughing and saying "hayle nawl" cracks me up every time they insert it lol
This is why I love Kandi her realness and so down to earth I definitely love her speak on it because she ain't no backstabbin snake and she knows the business inside and out that's why some ppl don't like her cause they aren't use to the authentic realness SHOUT OUT TO TODD HE GOTTA REAL STOP PLAYING WITH MY GIRL 🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥💯💯💯💯
Let’s y’all ole lady’s
Pipe down Kandi! You were mad disrespectful with the way you handled SWV. Granted you’re wealthy but put some respect on their name!!!!!
Kandi so funny, she said why her Thang got to be a secret, like ugh😮. 😅😅😅😅 that had me rolling. At 19:02 on timer
Be clear you never dismember
I'm not mad I promise just want to ad some facts. Yes SWV sold millions of records in the 90's and Xscape success came later. BUT SWV has over 3 MILLION streams per month TODAY in 2023 on spotify while Xscape has 800K per month. On YouTube SWV has 72 million streams on their most popular song (Weak) and Xscape has 65 million on Understanding. That demand translate to ticket sales TODAY. Love you all ❤ I feel everybody should have been paid equally.
The one thing Kim Zoziack taught her was to get the business done up front🤑
Lee Lee should go back to the water company job I'd walk in and say,"just came to visit to see who still here,hey girl u still working down here....alright then now.....job is a job."😅 Give them all that but they see her comeback so ...
I’ve been following you your own momma with rhoatl
Stop stop stop Kandi
Kandi advocate for yourself, if you don’t who will.
I can’t receive Tocha’s gospel music either. I felt so bad for Tamika, her mom is tripping.
Kandi needs to be the designated group manager, it would makes logic sense and less stress on all the members!
The thing about it is the reason you wouldn't want or shouldn't have an act like SWV be the opener for you is the same reason it was a mistake to have SWV and Bell biv DeVoe open for you in 2018 those two groups are so high octane that they wear out the audience before the main act even sang their first note. I remember when SWV took the stage they pop the crowds so hard we almost went deaf. And then BBD came out and they shut it down they had us thinking it was 1989 again and by the end of BBD set a third of the audience was through. Remember we old as hell we can't stay up all night and to keep that pace. To keep it 100 about a third of the audience left after a couple of songs from Xscape and left wishing that they had came on earlier. To keep it real most people are not going to stay to see all three acts .. we old as hell and we only going to stay until we hear our favorite song and then we going home.
@kandyonline I can relate to evening you said.... Our personalities are very similar so I always agree with you.. you are raw, real, and authentic and you have so many valid points that nobody can deny... YOU ARE THE REALIST THAT TV NEEDS, THIS IS WHY YOU'RE THAT GIRL!!!!!! PERIODT!!! ❤👍
The real issue is that Tocha wants a solo career badly, but  nothing she does sticks. She hasn't been able to meet her expectations or sustain her life without Xscape and she resents that. Instead of being honest with herself and except the fact that she doesn't have the "it factor" she rather blame Kandi. She hasn't really branded herself outside of the group the way Tiny and Kandi have. Even Tamika can carve out solo things because her voice, energy, and personality are bomb AF! Tocha is boring and the vc isn't that crazy. Tamika eats her up vocally if we're being honest. She wants to be the Beyonce of the group, but Beyonce clearly had the it factor.
Kandi Kandi Tamar needs your attention again co.e on with the video N season 2 r&b diva's. God bless you for always opening employees opportunities and career comebacks for the girls no shade all fact I'm a viewer and that's what the people on the street see.
Kandi. I love you but let’s be real. This isn’t a regular show. This is a collaborative show! Ppl coming to see both of y’all. Majority of y’all fans are fans of each group. Y’all are 90s r&b legends. I think being so competitive can be a gift and a curse. Bc you achieve so much with your spirit but it can blind you from seeing the bigger picture. The fans don’t see xscape and swv and put y’all in a certain hierarchy. Y’all are 90s RnB legend in your own right. At the end of the day, if y’all want your fee to stay the same, why can’t that be and y’all co-headline together. The fans don’t have to know who got paid more. And frankly I’m a huge xscape fan but if I saw a flyer with xscape name bigger than swv I’d be confused. The Supremes would never open up for the Labelles and vice versa in a reunion show/tour. Aretha not opening up for Gladys. I think y’all need to come to an understanding! Lol but at least a compromise. Everybody start out together and end together. Or on tour, alternate. Or SWV need to raise them prices. But at the end of the day, swv has a right to feel how they feel bc this is a collaborative idea btwn only you all. This didn’t start off as xscape tour/show or with anybody else. Y’all both came to the same table with the idea of doing a group project. Be fair.
Yes I almost cried too... But I still feel like her mom didn't humble herself for the longevity of it ... Just for that moment.. hopefully, that's not the case Kandi.... ❤
The ending 🤣🤣🤣 Kandi was like “I know they didn’t just shoot and kill me” 😂😂
HEY KANDI. I understood when I heard you say it. Upfront conversations are required. Period. It's called adulting. It was the B*tch part that threw me off. Like, why I gotta be a b*tch because I'm addressing the business of business? That is one thing I dislike about us as women. That b*tch term flies too freely.
I hate that Xscape took this stance on the co headlining because it would’ve been great to see a different type of concert. Mary J Blige and Maxwell went out together and I believe co-headlined and was awesome!
Kandi why didn’t they allow you to explain that to us. It makes so much sense now since you explained it. Hey Kandi is that the way Tocha lol😂 yall can’t do that to black people. Scared the mess out of me as well.
I never like Tocha
I’m so glad you got Todd
Yeah they should have a back up plan as well
I feel you used your talents Kandi
Thanks for setting the record straight. About the Headlining, situation. Xscape has been on top. Since the return
Thanks so much for sharing you did a great job of explaining the  project and what the inside scoop is     and if you  seen Rockie at the table with  his Artist  he was a saleout at the  meeting on he didn't know she didn't tell him on her decisions to go solo and not tell you all but we all see he do all her thinking for her and big decisions for her so he look shifty to me .
I’m with you Kandi. Handle your business
19:04 😭😂😂
The Sisteren Sircle says... make some songs together. open together and close together. #IssaLoveThang #SistarHood #SistaSync 💃🏿❤️💃🏿❤️💃🏿❤️💃🏿❤️💃🏿❤️💃🏿❤️💃🏿❤️
Why would ya’ll ask SWV to open for ya’ll? It should most definitely be co-headlining. How disrespectful Kandi!
“Our price ain’t changing!” Iktr Kandi 😂
EVEN  WHEN  MEEK  GAVE   HER  VISION   ABOUT    THE   XSCAPE & SWV   TOUR    TOCH   WAS LIKE  🙅🏾‍♀️    I AIN'T   FEELING THAT 🤦🏾‍♀️   MEEK👀   AT   HER LIKE🙄  🤷🏾‍♀️  🙋🏾‍♀️  😂
It still doesn't sound fair...ITS A NEW CO-PROJECT, NOT OLD AND WHAT YALL BEEN DOING...ITS ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE TO GET PAID?? RIGHT?? BUUUUT, I do hear that ysll have more followers?? But isn't that just because yall been on Reality TV and they haven't?? Again, new project,  new followers?
Yeeeeesss Kandi keep this coming I love the clarity you bring. Yes it’s your opinion but the recipe’s 😂😊you gotta respect the facts 😊.
ENTERTAINMENT LAWYERS make alot of money Riley!!
Kandi is very business savvy. I need her to teach me lol
Kandi I hope you read my comment what yall need to do is vote LAtocha out the group and get the paper work in writing. And let Latocha do her. Because one thing I don't like is her and Rocky want to use xscape as a coat tail to revamp Latocha Career. Because truth betold Tameka AkA tiny, you Kandi and Tameka have stayed relevant over the years and have a strong fan base and she doesn't. So she uses Xscape as a safety net because she doesn't know exactly what direction or lane she fits in this new generation of music. Latocha know their is no lane for her that will bring money in like xscape unless she went to gospel. So Latocha need to stop blaming yall for her career not taking off. She can sing her face off but she just doesn't look the part and isn't very marketable plus hard to work with. Yall ladies will be better off excluding her legally. And if she did come up with the name xscape. I would reinvent the name from Xscape to X3CAPE so she wouldnt be able to make any money off yall because all she want to do is bitch and complain. Kandi B. Plus with it being X3CAPE its like ex meaning now its 3 girls. So it speaks for itself. Destiny Child had to do the same thing. But yall got this and I wish yall the best. I would love to have another album because yall voices have gotten so beautiful the more season yall became. Kandi keep doing yall dam thing sus.
Sorry gotta agree with Kandi on this it makes sense!!!
I get it now kandi it’s about business
Tell the Truth shame the Devil Kandi❤❤❤❤
Kandi didn’t you hold up your group xscape  getting back together for years because you were in your feelings.  I’m just asking.
It’s because this is a joint tour. They are still selling more than Xscape when it comes to streaming.  The Great Xscape tour was really successful because we didn’t know how long yawl were going to be together and yawl were coming off of a 18 year hiatus.    I am glad that I saw the great Xscape tour because now we don’t know if we’re ever going to see you the four ladies in Xscape perform together again.  It would be amazing to have a joint tour with SWV & Xscape.
I was at that Kansas City show! Had a blast!
Kandi I just wanted to let you know becareful just side eye these people there always got to put you in there mouy
I love Kandi. Perfect example of Karma and GOD’s timing. Keep winning❤
Let Tocha go.  Godspeed.  The group will survive and thrive without her.
@kandi I’m sure you’ve already suggested this, but if not, maybe Riley would consider entertainment law 🤷🏽‍♀️ She can help artist avoid signing bad deals and provide other legal oversight. Best of both worlds. 😊
One thing Kandi gonna do, is tell the truth!!!
❤
Work Kandi ...Getem eve8 time they come for u..
I love you kandi, keep being you darling, love 💕 from London 🇬🇧
The precedent has already been set with Escape as the headliner. I love that Kandi clarifies what we’ve seen and heard on the show. I hope going forward these two iconic groups will come to an agreement and tour together. Millions love both groups music and are eager to show support by attending the concert. So, I hope the ladies go ahead and get to it!
Kandi has a great business mind and knows how the business goes inside and out... I'm going to have to go with her idea. It makes sense now!
I JUST LOVE the fact that Kandi is about her business and comes with the receipts
Kandi my girl but I’m gonna have to disagree with her.And I love me some kandi. Being on housewives does not relate to the success of Xscape they’re not even the same audience. The only reason why they had a sold out tour their first year is because they hadn’t toured since the 90s. That’s the part that she’s not telling you. And since that show it has not been any other sold out tickets they sold well but it hasn’t sold out. SWV has been back together since 2013 so they had their Run of sold out Tours when they came back together. Plus Xscape is getting the hype now because they have four members back but as of right now they are not selling out tours. And the headliner is not automatic for any group it depends on who the artist that is touring. Xscape has only toured  with people who are under their bracket professionally and that’s why they get the headliner for their tours. SWV tour with people like Toni Braxton they are on a different level and caliber of touring and they even tour international. So that’s the difference and she has not shared that. So two different calibers SWV sold 40 million records as of today and escape only so 9 million. And they are very relevant because they had their own TV show a few years ago and they didn’t need any connects to get it. Statistics don’t lie nor do their Grammy nominations. Xscape has never gotten the nomination from the Grammys association. The matter is they are the bigger group just like TLC is the bigger group.
Kandi is a whole show by herself! 😂 Go girl! 🙌🏾
😅Yes Girl!
She definitely knows how to not answer questions in an interview and talk around questions asked.
Sorry kandi I don’t agree SWV have bigger hits billboard and international more album sales and way more concerts under their belt.  Reality tv and social media followers don’t equal ticket sales.  Kandi and Tiny tired it plus Coko would sing them all under the carpet. I get the conversation needed to happen for business purposes but they were wrong for trying to do SWV like that.
Lets be CLEAR, Taj from SWV was stating from the beginning of the meeting that the show they was going to do with xscape was going to be a ONE NIGHT show. So im confused why kandi keep saying tour when taj kept saying only one night. They definitely could’ve just Co-headlined for the ONE NIGHT SHOW 🤔🤷🏽‍♂️
🎉 Congratulations! I'm loving you on this platform. Now I understand Kandi. You are a beautiful person and I pray your continued success!❤
😂I like when Kandi talks honestly about Tocha and her stank attitude 😂
I love Xscape, especially Kandi, but SWV  opened on an Xscape tour so that makes sense. I went to that concert when it was in New Orleans and Tamar and Monica were openers. So, it’s different. This wouldn’t be an Xscape concert, it’s a joint effort.
😂I felt the mom was gaslighting her usual self🤷🏿‍♀️
This just shows why Kandi’s a business woman!!!
THAT MAMMA IS TOXIC TOXIC TOXIC. Just like Tocha.  Tamika deserves better. And the 3 girls of Xscape deserve better than both Tocha and that mamma.  Effie White deserves what Effie White deserves.
Okay… this explains it, somebody tripping, and it wasn’t Kandi (phew) I’m so glad you’re open and candid, this is why we are a fan of you personally, you gonna explain the BS! W/ receipts 😅❤
Thanks for explaining the business to us Kandi. It makes a lot of sense.
Okay Kempire I love how she puts smaller YouTubers on her platform because he is one of my regulars I watch him all the time ✨💯❤️
Search watch the third episode before I even see this video. I make it a comment. I’m really surprised that xscape thinks that they should get more money? SWV was before and also gave you guys a platform so you guys think that you need to have more money? And by the way I love you Kandi I agree with you most of the time on the real housewives of Atlanta but this time I’m like what lol
I love you Kandi, but please address the Tamar issue cuz this is ridiculous at this point with the accusations... A special speak on it LOL!
I hate when people try and play dumb. When SWV Was a guest for Xscape that was a SPOT Date where SWV Was invited in XSCAPE TOUR. It was not a Joint Tour with multiple dates where SWV Opened for XSCAPE And Kandi knows that she has to stop. There is a HUGE Difference
Looks like Tosha pulled a David Ruffin from The Temptations, Showing up with a different color dress on and much more! HaHa! she know what she doing! HeHe!
Kandi babe I love you so much but you are so wrong on the headline thing. Do it together and stop that stuff please.
First of all, I wanna say I love the way this video has been put together! Honestly, seems like it was edited a whole lot better than the show. I’m a die hard SWV fan for life and I love Xscape too but I also appreciate receipts. I know there are a lot of things edited out of these reality shows and I appreciate solid explanations. To be honest, I’d love to see SWV headline their own shows more. They could incorporate some of their unreleased material and that might increase the value of their show. Especially if they performed smaller venues that they could easily sell out. I don’t know if I’ve ever seen that.  As far as Xscape goes, I don’t think anyone likes to see their favorite group with members missing. I know that as people we sometimes let our emotions decide rather than the $$$$. I think either side has something important to say but which one is worth listening to. Life is short. I hope to see all four of y’all again on stage one day. I do like the idea of the two groups co-headlining (Not sure if that was the show I saw you all at in Ontario, Ca). But I do understand the numbers behind that (and the funny faces too). I hope everything works out. Guess we’ll see in the next episode.
Business is business this is not charity bc u sold more records.. Kandi and Tiny bring the fan base.  Take the opportunity or don’t.. others should’ve spoke up too..
As a man, you are my Everything Kandi!!!! God blessed you and your family
Receipts‼️ My Girl always come through with the receipts😂
When are you coming to Tampa
Tameka look stressed out, she need to cut her mom and sister off
Even with all this people will believe Xscape was being disrespectful and Kandi as far as I've seen never disrespectful anyone
If we want t be fair they both were opening acts for Bell Biv Devoe
Yeeesssss her and her husband Rocky was begging you to come back to the group.
Oh pleeeze....Tosha spirit is fine when she collecting Escape checks. Just leave the group and stop the madness! Escape can easily be 3 instead of 4.
That “ over-saturated the market “ made it make sense for me.. speak on it Kandi.
I think Toscha is EXTREMELY jealous of Kandi for a LOT of reasons, I agree with Todd, Kandi is living the life Tosha dreamed she would have. I think Toscha purposely tried to sabotage this entire thing, She wants to be a solo artist, she doesn't want to be in the group at all, but since she has nothing else, she's holding on.
The fact is that Kandi and Tiny have stayed in the spotlight which makes them more relevant than all the ladies. I love both groups. But facts are facts which Kandi stated.
Just because you can sing Gospel don't ma😢 make it alright for TOCHA for her to be acting rude forward the the ladies of the group.
I will say this to the end 👀👀. Now that she have talked you into coming back to the group. She feel now since doors have opened since she’s used you. That she do not need y’all anymore. Her husband pimp Ike aka rocky, he’s in her ear and hyping her up. She have been arrogant since day one. It’s funny I’ve been saying this that she reminds me of the old coko. And see my opinion coko have become with change due to getting help, and not bringing in that bag like they use to can open eyes as well. I feel like y’all need to let her go. She’s very good at telling lies period. Because she did it once and now twice. And y’all letting her back in, and if she fall she know she have y’all to come back too. People have hyped her up  by saying she’s the voice. But see me naw she would be cancelled period. Her and team Ike rocky could have it because she’s too arrogant, and she think she’s better than y’all. And Kandi she must don’t know your status period A lister style 🥂🥂✌🏾✌🏾.
🚫💍🤔🤷🏾‍♀️ good review👏🏾🤗🎊🎈
LaTocha come on let fix that crown so you can move on in I love and light with your Sista Queens.   Put the bs aside sis. You can do it all. Make it right with your sista and group and glow up....... Fingers Crossed.
They opened for y’all before but this time it was supposed to be a  celebration for both groups so that’s why she probably had a problem with opening this time. She wanted it to be equal
Kandi is a total class act. I’ve grown to love her on US Celebrity Big Brother. She is a person of integrity. She always lays the facts down and back every she says with receipts. How is she the bad guy her. SWV is tripping!
One thing about Kandi is she’s ALWAYS been the business brains behind Xscape. Even back when they were starting, she would always stay behind and talk to the execs about the group and advocate for them. Even this very show they’re on right now is thanks to Kandi. She always means business. Business and feelings don’t mix. We don’t care that you sold 30 million records in the 90s. SWV ain’t popping like that no more. Even their stage production and presentation is not up to par with Xscape. The facts speak for themselves!
I love Kandi and Xscape's music, but It's so funny how she is trying to justify, not coming in Second. place. and states that she can't find nowhere that documents SWV albums sales at over 25-30 million, when every time you type SWV in Google the first thing that comes up is albums sales and it also states SWV is a multi-platinum album selling group, with "OVER" 25 million records sold "worldwide" and is a four-time Grammy Award nominee. Music Data also has them documented at 40 million and one of the highest selling R& B girl groups of all time, Even Spotify shows music streams with SWV at 3,050,511 monthly listeners while Xscape only get 807,081 monthly listeners; But Xscape has the bigger fan base, and you claim you or Don Juan can't find anything that documented numbers of SWV sales. LOL
RECEIPTS 🧾 !!!!😂😂
Kandi just dropped soooooo many 💎💎💎💎💎 Like…the last portion of this video was a class, quiet as kept!!!!! Take notes!!!! #BusinessisBusiness
This Speak On It HILARIOUS! I love you all. I hope yall worked it out.
Kandi we are still awaiting another Kenya Moore Speak On It special it's taking quite awhile now...
Only bigger and better! Can’t ESCAPE the vibe! Keep grinding!
And they Sold 25 million records Kandi so stop playing in they fucking face! They outsold yaw 2x over and have waaaaaaay more HITS SOOOOO
The business is way deeper than anything personal… so not sure why after all these years ppl still so sensitive
So what?  They want to equally headline. There on the show with you all due to who they are. Because they can whole their ground. It not like their brownstone that is with no shade very talented group that was not as popular
The edits is giving! Your channel has grown so much! The breakdown is on point… filling in all the gaps most don’t know nothing about ...some do well with their spin on what's going on-other's try-however pouring the tea over a read, a roast lol and nothing but facts....
Tocha is horrible, such a false and deceptive person. Everything about her is a façade to hide the true evil that’s within her. She’ll never have the success she seeks bc of how she treats people. She needs to take gods name out her mouth. She is FAR from saved. PLUS she’s married to a modern day pimp.
Kandi 🥰🥰🥰😅
I love Kandi she’s such a boss
That momma is part of the problem and I truly believe she's leaving off them as well. She need to pull back from that momma and that sister. They some shady ass people.  And lets not talk about light bulb Larry head having ass Rocky. That dude is a bum and giving Kevin Williams (Wendy Williams) husband vibes for me. 🤔🤔🤔
I think the thing that makes things different is the Versus. When SWV supposedly won, their popularity jumped again. I think that their brand gained a lot of value from that performance and it made people start looking at SWV as that group. And, due to the issues with Tocha, Xscape is not the same group. Yes they can sing, and no we do not want Tocha back, but something that was so great can never be the same again. The whole reason why now is a good time for them to do a show together is because people are feeling nostalgic. Xscape is no longer a nostalgic group without Tocha, so what they had when Kandi joined back in and it was all four girls, is gone now. This whole situation just needed to be handled by management.
Either way Kandi your group are significantly less successful LETS BE CLEAR! Also SWV STILL TILL THIS DAY PERFORMS ALL OVER THE WORLD COMPARED TO YAW CITY TOURS THEY ARE EVERYWHERE AND STILL TILL THIS DAY MORE SUCCESFUL
I want to know why  the never sing "In The Rain". They turn that song upside down and inside out. Kandi's vocals gives me chills
It is really sad but Tocha with her stank attitude because that what exudes every time she comes on screen, she needs Xscape exposure to go "solo". Speak volumes, she really should be trying to figure why she needs you guys to go solo.
Like you said last week, Kandi, the reason Tocha need some “freedom” is because she needs a WIN outside of the group. I don’t think she ever recovered from never having her own success! Kandi, you’re successful, Tiny is successful, Tamika has had some success with doing plays, etc… She’s trying to get that HIT as a solo artist that she never got! Chile! I’m convinced she’s been the problem all of these years. I always have thought that but I can see that ever more clearly now
Kandi you feel like your better than them
Khandi us confrontational and i am here for it
I like Xscape but I love SWV, the hits speak for themselves
Kandi is problematic like Latocha. That’s why you both left the group because your selfish. You can’t compare Bravo to concert sales.
The show is extremely interesting. I also cannot say that what’s been shown hasn’t been expected. I expected Toscha and Coko’s attitude. I hope all of Toscha’s dreams come true and she finds the peace she’s been seeking. I wasn’t upset at all for what you asked about Headlining. I believe those of us who have a Business mindset understood EXACTLY where you were coming from about the Billing. Those who are watching with emotions may have been coming for you in the comments. I’m proud of Tamika for standing up for herself, sometimes we have to take a step back and realize that family can be toxic as well, and loving them from a distance may be needed for your peace. When I saw the Green dress, it was obvious there was something behind it I instantly said “I’ll be glad when David Ruffin gets his solo act”. Although we love Xscape as 4, the 3 of you ladies sound just as GREAT!!! Tamika is holding her own out there, and Kandi’s voice is needed on all the songs she leads, because those notes would be hard as hell to duplicate. If a 4th member is needed, Heiress is always available.
Kandi your ego is getting in the way and stop being so greedy for money.
Yeah I was in tears too watching that scene. It was very relatable
Welp!  DJ Richie Sky just did a post a few minutes ago basically explaining both sides when it comes to co-headlining and I'm seeing that two of my favorite groups are really dropping receipts about this thing so I'm going act like a child caught in between 2 parents about to divorce and be quiet to see how this thing plays out. Dont want to encourage the negativity when it comes to yall💔.
I actually admire the way you handled that. I love swv too but business is business❤
Ok binge worthy
Kandi is an absolute force to be reckoned with in the business world. Her intellect and business savvy have been proven time and time again, and her success is a true testament to her hard work and dedication.  What’s truly inspiring about Kandi, though, is her commitment to advocacy and the use of receipts to back up her arguments. She’s not afraid to speak up about important issues, and she always comes prepared with the facts to support her beliefs.  As a Taurus, Kandi embodies the traits of her sign by valuing the truth and being direct in her communication. This makes her a formidable opponent in any business or personal situation, as she is never one to shy away from speaking her mind and sticking to her beliefs.  Overall, Kandi’s intelligence, business skills, advocacy, and Taurus traits combine to create an unstoppable force that is truly admirable. It’s no wonder that she is so highly respected and loved by many!
You made all the sense Kandi ❤️❤️❤️
That’s not what Coco was saying . That’s was your show that you’ll headlined. This show will not be XScape’s Show. What Coco was saying is that she’s not doing that for this show. Kandi your trying to flip and mix things up. Just stop being disrespectful and so greedy for money.
10:17 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I here what kandi is saying . But they could’ve co headline one time . But business is business. Money rules
Was Tasha creating drama for reality/to be the reality villain. Her behavior does not make sense.. just unnecessary drama. I would think her been part of the group would be beneficial to her solo career.
Tocha is the Nene of Xscape. Her stank ass attitude and her superiority complex are off the charts. Girl bye 👋🏾 she's her own worst enemy. She comes across so unlikeable and unfortunately her solo deal is doomed to fail 🤷🏾‍♂️
it is what it is...BUSINESS... Love u back KANDI
Yikes lol those receipts Chile
Kandi you can try to explain the headlining situation, but the way you said it was very disrespectful as if SWV is below Xscape. Sometimes making money can cause you to loose more than you gain.
Seems like the negotiation needs to be with the promoters. Let the promoters bid for the show where it would satisfy both groups, where y'all get y'all's fee and their fee would equal y'all's. Where one promoter won't pay it, another one will, because it's money on the table to be made.
Interesting how people want Xscape to take a pay cut for SWV but won't do it for their co-workers 😂smh Business is Business
Kandi is a BOSS👍🏿!!
Man....Kandi...when I say you're a boss...I mean YOU ARE THE BOSS! You articulated that perfectly well. Nobody and I mean nobody can say you were wrong in this.  I love how you  always and I mean ALWAYS provide receipts. Oh and P.S. Kandi you can sing, and sing well. I love your style and your tone . Let the haters hate. You 3 as Xscape has done a lot more than Xscap3 has 🤷🏽‍♂️...just saying 😁. Love you Kandi!
Maybe it depends on where you’re from but where I grew up and from what I remember back in the day on TV and radio, SWV was the bigger group.  I think part of the headlining thing is that Kandi and Tiny are people we see on T.V. right now, Kandi is on Bravo, Tiny has her shows and also famous husband and kids…. so yes it makes since that their group is headlining these shows now….BUT if we were to take all that away,  SWV should definitely headline if we have to pick one and base it off of 90s popularity, hits, and fans(music only).   Both groups are equally talented and just need to do a joint show.
Ok, I get the business part. Its very true that currently xscape's fan base surely has grown alot thanks to Tiny and Kandi. Also the whole " xscape been headlining so why change it up now" makes since when you explain the business. It's all about business i.e. $$$ if xscape handle's the business differently for this particular tour  by sharing headlining it could mess up the business for them later. It's just the way it came across on the show sounded like SWV was being "sonned" . I mean it felt like Destiny's Child telling the Supremes to open for them.  Xscape is GREAT and deserve all the credit and then some they receive but SWV was first..its all about the business though and so I do have a better understanding.
Kandi I just love you, we have the same birthday and I have always been your fan
I'm not taken a cut for no one😂
Don’t play wit Kandi!  She ain’t got to lie…Craig. 😂
Kandi I want to apologize because I have been saying it's you for a long time. Now I'm side-eyeing everything that was said about you on housewives. I'm seeing things a lot different. You are about the business side and that's clear because nobody wants to ever go to a Leelee situation. Bless her heart. OAN yasssssss Kempire you made it and my other youtuber💃🏿💃🏿💃🏿
They should co-headline.
In My New Orleans Voice Bayyyyyy Bay Kandi is about Business💼 and Receipts 🧾!! When people was tripping about the headline stuff I was like Kandi is thinking business although I do think they should do headline but I know Kandi thought process has to do with Money side💵💰🤑 I always learn something from Kandi! #TeachUs Kandi🤎
It's about the promoters huh...The only question I have now is swv being cheated out of their money? Cause how they get paid less anyway I see they got two white managers so yah know🙄🙄
❤Yes Kandi Queen handled  your  business. Love this show is so good.Tocha messy boots . Take tocha & Rocky Ike off the show.If tocha doesn't want to part of the group.  Rocky knew they talked about it(Solo deal) and it was his idea💡 .When tocha was in the studio she was so happy singing then Rocky walks in to check on tocha. He looks at all the fellas in the studio making sure tocha not flirting. Her body language towards Rocky was so obvious. He sucking her light, joy,  rocky doesn't  even want to pray over the food and puts her down when tocha spoke eloquently. Notice when they hug tocha hugs Rocky from a far and they don't  kiss.  Tocha needs to get rid of that vampire devil and mend her relationship  with her sisters tamika,kandi,& tiny. My gosh  the end of this video  scared  me too😂 Get kandi a  cake🎂 next time.
We love you Kandi!!
Kandi, girl... my fellow Tauren.  Your husband is right. Tosha is upset about who you have become. Girl, keep your energy. Many envy you.  # Tauren energy... we are allergic to bull shit😂😂😂❤❤
If I can say one thing about Kandi.. Kandi is fair….. She’s never disrespectful , mean or condescending…
That voice is screeching
Since you broke it down like that, it made total sense.  Is this gonna come out on the show?
Not gonna lie.. I was rooting for SWV during the versus and out of the two, im more of an SWV fan..HOWEVER, Kandi is my favorite housewife and favorite group member of Xscape and I now see why she said what she said. Seeing things on TV can definitely give you a one sided view of things.....
Kandi...you don't have to have any receipts to prove a persons character. Tocha & that tried bastard husband comes across as arrogant, entitled, and scheming. Tocha wants to shine. However, what ESCAPED her mind, we wouldn't even know her without the group. BYE Tochawith that poop💩
The crazy thing about Tocha is that she was asked on the radio if she EVER Talked to Jermaine Dupree about WHY her album was shelved and she said NO‼️ Gurlllllllllll🙄🙄🙄 You mean to tell me you been going around for 20+ yrs Blaming Kandi and you NEVER asked Jermaine WHYYYYYY‼️‼️‼️ That means that YOU were NOT interested in finding out the TRUTH‼️ YOU just wanted to run with a Narrative because of YOUR Personal feelings towards Kandi🤔 #Childish I👏🏾 don’t👏🏾like👏🏾that! That speaks to YOUR Character or lack there of Tocha🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
So I’ll say this both groups are amazing but when it comes to vocals I would want to see swv cause they paved the way and can sing that group into the ground and they have more hits however I’ll let them work that out I’ll say this let swv do a solo headlining tour and then see what it gives off cause no shade swv can handle a solo mega tour
Kandi 👑
Tocha the real spelling TASHA...anyway...Kandi is really pleasant Tocha and Rocky a hot pile mess💩... Coco & Tocha are the same thinking they are the necessity, the needed. However, 50 + group who are blessed to eat from the same plate of songs from the 90's is a blessing and Coco & Tocha aren't the baddest chicks without SWV & ESCAPE P E R I O DT...sit they azzz down at the GROUP table and get that retirement bag💰💸🤑
can you please tell Tamar to shut up 🙄
Latosha don't even care about her sister because her shenanigans was trying to mess up her sisters money for her family. They fine without her. Tamika come from the same family she can sing them parts and move on without drama or they can add another girl like other groups do.
Tryna be patient but 29:18 mins in and I still haven't heard why xscape should headline not share headlining with swv but I'll wait..
It seems folks always get mad at kandi for being about her business and bag
Business wise Escape has a salary they get paid per show period. And it is more than SWV. So they should not let the promoters give them less then they will expect that when they by themselves. Never give up your spot.
Kandi I adore you❤❤
Girl them eyes tho😂😂if looks can kill😂😂😂and what's funny is u don't even be angry cuz all u do is laugh but them eyes and stares are priceless 😂😂😂😂😂yo candy I still be bumping leave you ❤❤❤
Kandi and Taj need a show lol.I don't like saying what Taj has said tho 😂
No wonder Kandi has a class at my future college of law!  She’s always business minded and logical…. But I still kinda agree with SWV…Xscape is barely holding on due to one member going rogue
Handle business  Kabi, that why u rich
Facts Kandi.... 90's they sold more music
I'd rather clock in at the water company than be in my car because I'm embarrassed.I wouldn't think to clown someone.i'd be happy she found another way until it was time to get back on stage.I support you Lele
I love how Kandi breaks things down.
Damn the truth hurts 😂 no wonder those bitter Betty’s are mad. This is the most those girls have been talked about in like 20 years. They need to be sending you thank you flowers for the relevancy
It’s very clear that Tocha is the problem!!! Kandi y’all should kick her out of Xscape!!!
Can’t wait until she speaks on the Tamar situation☕️🫖🧋🍵
All facts . If you want Peace just leave the group and we will not contact you anymore. Girl Bye
Watching the show I did get pissed like why can’t u all co headline considering it’s just one act. But on this video you’re saying as ifs to be a tour if I understand correctly. Since you broke it down with the receipts, we as viewers get clarity that way. Like I’m a visual person so this cleared it up for me. Now I’m not mad anymore, not that anyone gives a rat’s ass, lmaooo
This is the why that babymama said you are a bringer of chaos!!! You have to let stuff pass on. You must have some cancer in your big three.😩
I love Kandi and Tiny! I'm from New York and love yall accent / aura! Keep it coming boo, we are here to support you!
Perhaps what's got to Tocha! Love this one, Kandi Along with Xscape and SWV too! 😍❤️💕❤️
We in this thang lololol who is doing these messy graphics lol I live for it 😂😂
I love Kandi's transparency! My question is who is going to buy her gospel album after seeing her behavior on the show!
❤ Kandi Facts who has the potential to Sell the tickets 🎫.
But it made sense from the beginning it's about asses in the seats... Mariah has sold more than Beyonce but Mariah isn't outselling Beyonce when it comes to touring...
Gotta love Kandi. She’s the most logical thinkiner when it comes to business and the group without taking things so personal. Now don’t come for her family (as she should)  because that’ll contradict what I just said lol. Overall she’s a successful business woman and I feel the most easiest to work with. That may be why Tocha is intimidated and makes everything so difficult within the group because she has her own personal issues with Kandi. Why? I think a lil envy. Kandi and Tiny are the most grounded in their group. I knew there was more to the story about SWV that’s why i kept scrolling and waited for Kandi to Speak On IIIITTTTT! 😅
This is why I love speak on it so much, and why this show is so important! Because the way you explain everything makes so much sense because I was looking at you with a side 👀at first. I was like come on Kandi why can’t y’all co-headline? I 😢understand and I would have moved just like you. team money
Um kandi what is thing about you n Todd trying to fight Tamar???
Kandi is very business savvy but the way she presented the billing scenario was out of pocket and disrespectful.  The new fans you all have, are NOT true 90's r & b fans. They're social media kids. Those of us who grew up on 90's r & b fans know that SWV led the way for groups like xscape. How much money can one have to be happy? The love of money (getting it by any means necessary hurting anyone to get it) is the root of all evil.
I love how articulate Kandi is about business. It was hard to hear because we “the public” just doesn’t understand.  The clarity is good.
Tocha has had nothing but freedom to do her solo album or whatever she chose to do ,she needs to stop playing victim when she's not .Tocha just needs to stop blaming Kandi and whomever else for her non success as a solo artist and take a look in the mirror.
One thing about Kandi, she is going to explain everything from top to bottom okay!!
Why not Co- Headline?? That was so disrespectful to SWV.. money and EGO at the cost of forever ruining a Professional relationship???
Great review Kandi we all seen Tocha wanna be Beyonce BS really made her look Stupid and like you said she do not have to hide she have a deal with someone else, Kandi you always able to juggle more than 2 jobs at a time but we all remember the last time Bravo gave Xscap a season and Tocha did the same thing when will that Dead album come out just in like her Stealing money from her sister Tocha is a Fraud in my eyes and there mom should stay off the show, now she's claiming she is the Fifth singer in the group..It appears to the Viewers if not for you being on RHOA no one would have anything to think they are Beyonce...Kandi you all need to drop Tocsha she will get her Ish together Lol
The song at the end sounds smooth 💯
Honestly y'all usually when some artists came make it in the mainstream secular world then they turn to gospel! Tosha calls herself a religious or spiritual individual yet she's on national TV lying, stealing her sister money, being nasty to her bandmate, and have such a hatred for Kandi Burruss Tucker, it's not even funny anymore! I don't know how they could have signed her and I know if they are watching this show right now oh, they're probably regretting that they signed her because I wouldn't buy her album, no way! Her demeanor and attitude is so nasty towards her sister and her bandmates and yet she expect great things to happen for her, SMH
40:29 My grand babies gave me push back on Ace's channel. They wanted daggone spelling and counting from cartoon characters with British accents. Took me a miute to figure out why they were walking around here tom bout "foh-ti-five, foh-ti-six, foh-ti-seven...😁
Kandi gurl we need a grown n sexy interview with u n Leelee 😂😂😂love yoll😂❤
I bet Escape can make new music just with the 3 now shoot SWV still making music. Touring is the money maker for an artist.
So alternate who headlines simple solution.
They need to Co-Host this Show together case closed no group is better then the other and the PPL need to know this .they have both succeeded in the game.
Kandi Burruss Tucker, you better come with the receipts baby😂, yessssss girlfriend👏👏👏👏👏! You know with a lot of common people you have to bring receipts and break things down to a Elementary level so they can understand how this business works! We all know y'all have respect for SWV and yes they came out before you guys did, they are much older than you and they started their career 5 to 7 years before you ladies did! At the end of the day everything you just said is 100-percent backs and SWV should be glad that they're getting these paychecks because at the end of the day you nor Tiny need to be on tour to make money and your fans are grateful that you are and I'm sure SWV band are grateful that they are also so for Coco to say that they've sold 30 million records is kind of a stretch of the imagination! It is what it is, because of you having your own shows and being on the Real Housewives of Atlanta, and in movies, not to mention your own solo career, now we have Tiny being on her own television show with her husband and her family for so many seasons call the Family Hustle, did her own TV show that she had with her friend and doing her own solo project, y'all need to go back on TV to do anyting to make money! As quiet as it kept between you and tiny, y'all both have 10 homes each, LMAO😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's to many  swollen heads in  Xscape, that's why they not out touring and making that money.  I  couldn't even watch this to the end to hear  what the deal is with them  headlining and  SWV walking out on them.
Realistically speaking the show MUST close with Weak. It’s absolutely nothing to say after that. We leaving after that cuz the pinnacle has been reached. So if anybody still performing it's exit music at that point.
Tamika should have 1 on 1's with her mother without Latosha around at all times. 👍
Are y’all gonna give us a new set list for the tour? It’s time to bring out One Of Those Love Songs and The Runaround.
The Tameka, Tocha, and Mom dynamic is toxic and a lot of grown children watching this show it's opening up those wounds. Tameka must either have a relationship with their father or favors him which causes at times a mother's resentment or irritation to that child. So sad
SWV opening for yall in a tour you guys negotiated on your own seems a bit different to me than a joint show. Seems like expectations were different between the two groups from jump. I assumed since this stemmed from the Versuz it would be a joint tour
Kandi Burrus Tucker has never missed a BEAT or A BAG!! WORLDWIDE! Yes, get the money straight upfront! Imma follow Kandi.
Naw I love Xscape but they are wrong on trying SWV. if it’s your tour like the great Xscape tour and they are the guest then yes they should open, but it’s a  joint tour SWV should headline or its should be a co headline. The helped pave the way for you, if you are going on tour with En Vogue, TLC and SWV give them the respect they deserve. They haven’t given them an opportunity to headline their own tour so you don’t know if they can sell a lot tickets. Let’s not act like they didn’t bust your behinds on that verses. I still love you all and will support any show you all on doing.
Speak on it is like a companion piece to all the shows you are on…
Kandi is rich and prosperous for a reason. I don’t allow anyone to down play my craft. If swv is lowering their money that’s they fault. Next…. Now all of the cast doing a speak on it.😅 kandi is a trendsetter
Yes sing TONIGHT♥️ my favorite song by y’all! Had me cussin a chick out online about you singing lead on that song!
Tocha gospel song sounds like Soulja Boy 😂
Kandiiiiiiiiii, keep it coming! ❤
Yes  Kandi Ep-3  was very emotional. And life is real. And I appreciate your receipts and the  facts on the business side of entertainment world. It is what it is. And to me both groups are amazing. You all are beautiful Black Queens that are Killing the Game.  All you ladies are loved and, highly respected and has earned your crowns . And platform in this industry.  As queens you guys are . I’m proud of you. Keep doing what you do.
Kandi 🎉
KANDI WAS MAD ABOUT THE LAST ALBUM THAT WAS SUPPOSE TO COME OUT TASHA WAS SINGING MORE ON THE ALBUM SUPPOSEDLY AND JERMAINE DID SAY THAT.
I feel like since she clearly does not want to be involved in the group any longer regarding the actions that she is displaying, and you guys are back in full effect, is there a possibility that she can be replaced?? Just curious. I really hope that you see this because I have an additional point regarding this comment here, but I don't want to leave it here. I do have Instagram though and I'm pretty sure you get a lot of messages and I know that you're busy so you probably don't get a chance to read them all but I would love to contact you there so I can add on to this comment. Love You Kandi!!
Love both groups … and you are right for standing up for what’s right in business!!! It’s nothing personal. Pray you all can continue to work together In Peace and make this MONEY!!!
You keep saying back in the 90s but they have been back since the 90s. They have had reality TV success they have came out with 2 albums since reuniting and have headlined their own tour. I feel like people haven't heard from xscape in a while so that's why people wanted to see yall as in recently. But don't get it twisted people are rocking with SWV hard baby
Kandi is right, Adele has sold more solo records than Beyonce but she would definitely be the opener if they toured together.
Kandi really is the bee's knees. If you think about it, she could really shut down Tochas whole situation. She has the reach, the influence and the receipts to do it. But on her last speak on it she said "please go support her so she can leave me alone". She could yield her power so differently but she chooses to be a honest and decent person. #FAN4LIFE
Kandi gone turn this nonsense into more money as always and that’s why they envy you Kandi because they not where u are and that’s that
I only like two songs swv made .and I'm from that era . I remember when you guys came out .over all I luv more of yall songs than them .y'all harmony is off the chain .and lotocha voice does make a big difference. But also sounds still good with or without her.❤️
I was definitely in tears with Tamika and her mom. Tamika’s mom reminds me of my own mother. Long story I’m not her favorite for whatever reason and we just can’t see eye🤦🏾‍♀️Definitely relatable situation.
Kandi's transparency is what makes her Gold!!!!!
Girl bye! Their mom w that fake ass apology.. just saying words she don’t mean.. she’s still not gonna hear Tamika out or have her back
Visually when Tasha is gone we notice but sonically we don’t .the one person that can’t be gone sonically and visually is kandi because her voice is too unique to be duplicated and who ever thinks kandi can’t sing must be deaf or just stupid ! Cuz most of there hits are kandi leads just saying ! ❤ I am disappointed that both groups are not co head lining because I believe y’all should just my opinion.
Now I get it kandi explains the business side on her podcast
We need another Speak on it real quick! I'm not feeling all these folks tryna come for you today. We got  Tamar and Carlos King pulling up to the Kandi conversation and I swear its almost like its a planned take down. Please bring the truth that you always offer on shit cuz I know better.
Don't like Tasha, her husband  was dead on it he call his self kidding, IMITATING. IKE TURNER. He's pumping her
I so love ❤you and your honesty
Kandi baby, I loves you, but your delivery was off. They are not some random folks at a business meeting. You made them feel small...and for what? A few extra bucks? Every group wants to be exalted and respected. You destroyed both. I know you say its about business, but at what cost? You and Tony are not hurting for money. Maybe others are. I believe you went hard at SWV because you're repressing anger meant for Tocha. If I'm wrong, I apologize. Make it right.
I was in tears too Kandi. Very touching scene
I'm not hating on you at all, Kandi
Tasha is a straight Manipulater 😢 it's sad  because she is too old to be playing games!! For the of the ladies keep up the good work 👏!
CoCo's ego is bigger than Tocha's because she knows if she leaves SWV the group is done for. Tocha and Coco comes with the same kind of vibe..the difference is Coco knows working with the group gets her more money. Also had Tocha not backstabbed the girls back in the day Xscape would've outsold SWV. As is I can only name 1 SWV song off the top of my head. Xscape released 3 multi platinum records...so they were on the a path to do great things
Kandi I love you but why you lying on their sales?! I check several sources online and they say it's 25 million sold or more. On top of that yall Spotify streams aren't even comparable, they out stream yall by 2.5 million listeners per month. Seems like you down playing them but let me hear the rest.... Aight heard the rest, yes it's business I get it. I do think that should've discussed from jump before. When SWV opened for yall it was an Xscape tour so if it's now a collaborative tour as you stated then you guys on THIS tour should share. If they're putting in just as much work I dont see why yall can't. Seems like SWV thought it would be a one time performance anyways so may have been a miscommunication.
Just do your own tours cause you’re is all about  drama life is too short it’s one concert y’all should co headline and keep it moving but y’all do your group and let do there’s
Swv is a great group hands down but they are only know for WEAK. Xscape has way now hits the are known world wide PERIOD
Rocky is her interview coach 🥹
I wish Kamdi would take that boundary approach with her momma
Low Key! The 3 mics setup in the back is very telling but it's sending me 😂😂😂 I see y'all 🫣🫣
Oh girl, now Rockys angered side chic is back on the scene and blowing up the spot, and as bad as we may want to feel empathy for Toscha...we can't and ain't!!Also shout out to Kempire and Bingeworthy for making appearances
Lmaooo that surprise at the end was cute. But it scared me too 😂🎉
Kandi you and Tiny are very relevant and both your solo and duo projects make Xscape more bankable and still relevant and wanted in the culture. Yes, we love SWV but I went to see Xscape in Jamestown GA it was cold asf and a wet drizzle outside but the lines were ridiculous and yes SOLD OUT! Business is uncomfortable for folks but I’m like you; we don’t have to like it but we got to SPEAK ON IT 🗣️ 😘🥰💯🙏🏾
Ooh Kandi I don’t think it was appropriate for you to say Xscape had a few 3-4x SWV’s. Even if it’s true, you as a businesswoman understand how that could chip away at SWV’s ability to negotiate for higher fees with promoters down the line. Ultimately I think the co-billing was the right decision here because the discussions show SWV and XSCAPE wanting to collaborate on the creative vision and execution. If you have comparable stats (like you explained) then I don’t think co-billing for this project was a reach. Xscape doesn’t have to do SWV any favors but if co-billing with them also helps them negotiate higher fees down the line with promoters…isn’t that worth it? To pull up another black female group’s negotiating power?
Xcape can't even be professional enough to agree on a manager for the group. The manager should be having those conversations. You talking about headlining a tour and your group cannot even agree on how many members will be there or someone to manage you! GTFOH
SWV opened for them because that was thier Xscape tour!...not an SWV tour....Kandi really needs to stop...she knows that they will not get lowballed for one joint show!! She's the worst
Honey, cause my panties were in a bunch. However, as a business major as soon as you mentioned they do 50 shows a year, I was like well damn, who ain't seen them!! Beyoncé tours every couple years and I don't even think she has 25 shows between all tour legs. Yeaaa SWV gotta regroup and get better management who understands the supply and demand.
Love Love Love you Kandi 😍 💗
Thanks for clarification @kandi
Kandi is a BOSS
Kandi's voice is distinct. I know it's her, no one sings like Kandi
When you break it down from that "business standpoint," it makes complete sense for Xscape to headline.
I think Kandi is hilarious. Girl I used to be in a group, yep the drama with females sometimes smh. It's always that one that has to act out.
Good afternoon Kandi❤ Sounds like Tocha really wants her solo moment and has longed for it since the beginning. But Tocha  wants to keep the benefits of being a member of Xscape if things don’t go as planned for solo career. I have to agree it feels like she is using the group but wants no part of it. ❤️💯🙏🏾
I’m send your son to my granddaughter I keep telling my daughter needs to be on YouTube.
SWV definitely should headline simply because they do for a fact have more hits that ppl like than XSCAPE. Not taking away from SWV at all they have a few songs I like but SWV has a lot more that ppl JAM to. I hate that SWV hasn’t been to my city yet I just HATE IT! 😩
Speak on about Toni Braxton lil sister being the hater she's always been.
So Kandi are you saying that SWV should be opening for Xscape?? Because in reality there is no way SWV should be an opening act.
Speak on itttt Kandi! Put some muthafkn respect on the name Xscape!!! PERIOD👏🏾👏🏾
Kandi always comes through with receipts. The fans love SWV but the FANS LOVE Xscape more. No shade just truth.
Black people could never come together and do something 🤦🏽‍♀️ it’s always a competition
SWV still the better group 🤷🏿‍♀️
Listen, Kandi is about the 💰. The End. You have to respect the business baby!
👑 BOSS Lady ❤️
👑 Kandi 💖⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ That's why you are blessed by the BEST, because you do what you do...  GOD BLESS!
You know I love you candy but girl you was wrong for that one
1.) SWV humbly opened up for Xscape in the past. Now it’s time to return the favor for their tour. Co headlining is reasonable   2. Your billing is too much. SWV needs to increase their booking rate.   3. If SWV does 50 shows a year, aren’t they selling a lot of tickets? Worldwide.
Girl stop, you don't know how to build up women. Just selfish.
Kandi is about her business. 😊
The sisters' mom is too much in her daughters business. You can tell she has favoritism. She should let them fix their issue or speak with a professional.
Ohhhh ok. Thanks for explaining! Lol
I just want a co-headline show at matinee start time so I can be home by 10pm Thanks!
Kandi starting to get on my nerves stfu sometimes
I agree with you on latocha, but Kandi you are dead wrong with the SWV situation.  You have taken the “L” on this issue. Have a good day.
I Love You!!!!! You get to the business and handle it properly!!! Yes Anna Mae and her team thought this platform would be great to RELAUNCH her solo career. And we don't want it. I'm so happy Tamika choose herself and put her foot down. It can be hard with your mom 😢 overall, great episode and hopefully you can get the other ladies to stop by and SPEAK ON IT *In Da Brats voice 😂😂
Whatever Kandi!!! You were shady and wrong!!!! If you two are the only two it should be a collaboration all the way around!!!!
tbh. tochas claim was that kandi was jealous of her singing more on later albums…kandi’s receipts only proves tochas point (kandi was leading most on the earlier albums.. then tocha finally started getting more leads)..
Ready for that song to come on out Kandi!!!
Tamica and Tocha mama wanna be Mama Joyce so bad!!!!!! Girl sit yo ass down somewhere. Fifth member my left ass cheek.
It's sad that they're fighting because all of them are talented. As grown women they should be able to sit down and talk. She is correct if it wasn't for her and Tiny's visibility they wouldn't have the following they have. She is about her business,  great job Kandi.
Nobody know the pain people hide behind clothes doors but once you open up and get it off your chest and leave everything in gods hands things change prayer changes I love Xscape and SWV I can relate to the Tamika part 💯 that's how my mom treats me but I learned to love my mom from a distance but at the end of the day that's still Mom..I'm proud of you Kandi keep it up ...yes tosha  is very sneaky going solo and not letting Kandi, Tamika, or tiny know but hunni do you no shade💯🔥💯🔥🙏🏾💯❤️
Kandi could u do a live one Day ? I Know You Book And Busy 😂
The way Tocha acts and she's singing gospel. . . . This series has truly let people see how she really acts. Her disposition and attitude are horrible. I will not be listening.
Awww. I wish all the ladies could get an equal cut with this show.  But I get it, business is business.  Kandi knows what she's talking about it.
Kandi I agree. you have to advocate for yourself
Both groups are superb. I do feel SWV has much better songs.  Both groups should co-headline.
Love to hear and see dem receipts 👏 👌 😂
SPEAK ON IT KANDI!! 😂❤❤❤
I hear you about headlining your own Tour…… But this is an SWV and Xscape tour collaboration
Love Ya Kandi, thanks for breaking it down. 😁. I wish tocha would go somewhere and sit her a$$ down. She's obviously mad jealous of you and all your many streams of money. She definitely has a voice but maybe her stank attitude and deceit (her sister) is why she cannot manage to get a solo act off the ground. Karma!
Now that the 🐈 is out da bag, I wanna see Tamika receipts on  how Tocha n Rocky stole her money. Period... Don't worry I'll wait 😜
Tiny and Kandi has always had side projects and do Xscape business. That is why those two are successful because they are about their business.
I'm petty af, if I would've been Kandi I would've made merch saying "Y'all Said Kandi Kant but Kandi Kan and DID" 👏🏾💅🏾
I had no idea swv was doing 50 shows a year! Thats a lot of touring. No wonder they are being lowballed. Let the people miss you. Even huge artist have to take breaks or suffer the same fate of low ticket sells. Only super fans(not your fan base) will pay to watch you over and over. Especially when there is no new material. SWV is the bigger group and my favorite of the two but I agree with Kandi. Why would swv agree to go on first knowing they sold more?? Sounds like hungry people are behind them who just want to fill their pockets and wasn't looking out for their future. Forcing them to do 50 shows a year is bonkers. Let them rest, rehearse new dances, perform at bigger venues and I guarantee they will make more money doing 20 shows a year vs the 50 they do now. At this point everyone who will buy a ticket seen you already. Im sure they don't reinvent enough for the performances to be original.
Everything Kandi said is facts but why can’t they co-headline like we coming to see y’all equally and this shouldn’t be about egos
Heyyyy Kandi ❤❤ your the bomb ❤.
Tocha needs to be kicked out of the group and Xscape needs to move on as a trio group.
KANDI CAN !!!!!!!
Okay I get it with the headliner conversation, you were established between the two as headliners as past history has it on business paper. Got it. The questions have to be asked in the boardroom or they’ll be suppressed and blow up in an interview years later. Everybody gotta eat…abundantly.
Harsh but true 👍
I agree with the whole headliner situation. Xscape has always been headliners and SWV have been opening acts. I've been to several shows to confirm this. Kandi was just stating from the business aspect. No shade... just business and facts.
Love ya candy
I agree with you candy ..  you gave right information..
35:59 in all things get an understanding!🙃
Candy is good business women
Kandi I subscribed after you called us out for watching your videos but not subscribing 😅 I was like oop😬
Kandi can always hold her own! True boss behavior!
#myapologiesKandiTamikaTiny 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾because I certainly was running with the idea that you all were excluding this lady intentionally. Apparently you all were on her schedule and had better have a back up plan in place with her as part the group or you’ll be stuck tf out. Inconsistency to the max
I knew it was a lie
Of course if It’s an XSCAPE TOUR and ya’ll invite them to open then it is what it is. This was supposed to be a COLLABORATION though so I don’t understand why it couldn’t be 50/50? BOTH groups are GREAT and like you said sold millions of records. I love both groups but this all seemed very ego driven. It’s very disheartening to see how these Boybands/Male R&B groups can always do it and keep it moving and the girl groups can NEVER get it together and work together.
People are so obtuse to the truth this was clearly stated multiple times that it was for 1 show, so  that whole thing about "I thought it was a tour" is a falsehood Taj clearly and concisely stated for your tour you can headline but that 1 show it should be co-headlined.
Made sense as always! Kandi don’t just throw stuff out there without receipts to back what she’s saying!
The editing!!! 😂
Love you kandi❤
Riley can get a law degree in entertainment law… satisfying both of what you two want.
Yes SWV second album went platinum and they third one went gold and sold around 800k. They first one sold 3 million, the second one sold 1.2 million and the third one sold 800k.
I feel like Kandi & Tiny get the concept for good TV! They have to give some pushback. Cus look at all the comments sections on vids covering this show first it was the Scott sisters, now they have successfully navigated the conversation the next topic. Now it’s debate of which group contributed & was more influential to R&B. Mind this is a 6 episode series. I love it I wish could be around they circle. They have mastered getting to the bag.❤
What would make me want to buy Tasha's "gospel" album when she and her husband have such angst, no forgiveness, and ugliness?  Not to mention division within the family
I love both groups, but them vocals and classics from SWV just hit on another level.  SWV would be the main draw for me to a concert.  IJS
FACTS Are Correct  True  Statements
Latocha is so gross. I’ve listened to her “gospel music” and it lacks conviction. That’s what happens when you possess a malicious heart & spirit. I don’t give a damn if she convinces God Himself to loan her the voices of The Heavenly Hosts. That album will FLOP, because Latocha is nasty.
Tocha said she wasn’t excited to do a tour with SWV in the first episode.
They have sold millions more records than you
It's interesting how Tocha didn't have that same energy when you decided to leave the group and they created Xscape3. Ohhhhhh and I know you don't want to BUT, can you paleaseeee fo a Speak On It with this tamar BS.?!?!? Since she's a "journalist" & reporting facts! 😂 #SheTriedIt
The truth is coming out and she looks fake.
OMG!!! I LOVE ME SOME KEMPIRE!!!!
She’s mad at the world be should be mad at self about not going after the bag
18:42 - It ain’t freedom that Tocha wants. She wants solo stardom and she won’t get it bc she has no star quality. No debate pls.
I could've sworn that ORIGINALLY  Toscha denied doing a solo project (around the green dress time or shortly after) and Whoop Here It Is!!! She's trying to do a solo project
Apology for the billing debacle cuz I was like the OGs should headland and sharing was a compromise. I get it. I get it🌸
Kandi I'm with you,    "where they do that at?"   crazy,   Business is business
Anybody else hate that song they were playing in the Tocha studio scene? 😩🤦🏾‍♀️
They blame Kandi for everything. What her mom does, the husband, the manager. Must be exhausting.
If the argument is about a following Kandi and Tiny has, my question is where is this following when it comes to ratings for RHOA and the spin offs that had horrible ratings. If the following isn’t supporting the existing shows how can you make that argument for top billing. RHOA ratings are the worst since the 1st started.
Kandi ALWAYS come through with the breakdown of RECEIIPTS. She consistent! I am just sick of LaTaco and her shenanigans.
Tocha telling Taj about the deal before her own group members is frankly unf_ckingbelievable.  Imaging being this deceptive.....about a gospel album.   I thought her single they played on the show sounded lovely, but this is supposed to be a spiritual project. She's not showing anything on the show that I would want to welcome into my spiritual life.
If this is how laTocha is acting now. I can’t imagine how she was acting back in the 90’s lol
They scared the hell outta her😂
It was an escape tour so of course they opened for y’all! This is totally different because y’all are touring together Kandi you need to humble yourself.. I’m starting to think you were jealous of tosha back in the day because you definitely giving the vibe in the last episode!
Sorry for assuming that ya'll were being cstty towards Lotasha... I'm glad the truth came out... I'm having an Oprah Winfrey moment Aaaahhhh
Love Kandi! Keeps is all the way real ❤
I'm DONE with Xscape! Let It Go Please!
The Business breakdown should be a part of the show. This made perfect sense.
Team Kandi. But she missed the point. On the XSCAPE tour yes SWV did open. But on this show it  a joint collaboration.
I’m with you kandi!! Business is business!! I love swv too but they are looking for themselves too.  And I hate when other members keep quiet in a business meeting abt the uncomfortable decisions, and willing to let the outspoken one speaks and get burned!! But all of them benefits from the outspoken members!!!  Speak up all of you!!!!
Kandi - women are constantly low balled and underpaid across industries. If you are making 3/4 times their fee, that seems like a drastic disparity in pay. Perhaps they need another group of sisters to call that out to them and in the meantime take a slight cut  in this very NEW joint venture and split a fee that would be higher and more equitable. Y’all are both from the same era and deserve your due. Instead of working against one another - work together. This is why women continue to be underpaid and overworked. In industries outside of entertainment, people don’t even share with one another their pay - which continues this inequity.
I understand I have old school mom
Now kandi you know that it was 1 show now Kandi come on
It's very hard conversation with parent that not the parent but just  listen .
One thing about Kandi she coming with receipts and facts baby!
I agree with candy , she wanted go solo then go solo instead bashing candy and girls ,this is so stupid, I appreciate candy truth ..
Kandi, I love SPEAK ON IT, especially with this XSCAPE & SWV show. Your clear explanations are brilliant. Along with your personality. Taurus ♉ xx
We all know kandii  can sing
I’m glad Kandi explained it, this sounds logical and I really believe not having management is the real issue because this should’ve been a convo between the managers to prevent hurt feelings. On the surface it seems like co-headlining would be best, but understanding more from the business end changes my opinion slightly. Btw it did seem initially they were just talking about a one time performance.
I understood where you were coming from, and I agree if there was a manager then this would’ve been handled a little differently. I think SWV could have leveraged this collab even as an opening act to increase their rates through the tour. At the end of the day someone has to go first 😅
KANDI U DID A GREAT JOB ON THE MASK SINGER CHAMP 🏆 HOWEVER YAL NOT ON SWV LEVEL AT ALL LOOK 👀 AT THE VERSUS BATTLE LOL.🤪 SWV PUT YALL IN A COFFIN THEY SHOULD CHANGE THEY'RE NAME TO SWV UNDER TAKERS. I WILL ADMIT WHILE YALL WERE BEEFING FOR A 💯 YEARS SWV WAS IN THE STREETS GETTING MONEY 💰 SO THEY ARE OVER SATURATED. PEOPLE HAVE SAW THEM A LOT 🤔 SO MAYBE YALL SHOULD CALL OFF THE SHOW BECAUSE NO WAY SWV SHOULD TAKE LESS MONEY 💰 THAN XSCAPE WE SEE 🤓👀 LATOCHA TRYING TO XSCAPE THE GROUP AGAIN. LIKE I SAID YALL NEED TO XSCAPE BACK INTO RETIREMENT.🤪🤣😎
Y'all gonna learn one day....Kandi and her Team...  brings receipts 😂😂😂. I LOVE RECEIPTS 😊
Now Kandi.. you could have left out what Taj said. I’m sure she didn’t mean for you to repeat that. That was a lil messy nah.
But this tour isn’t a guest spot for SWV; therefore, the receipt is irrelevant concerning the past tours.
One thing Kandi gonna do is handle her business, I would want her on my team; cause we winning bish😂😂
I understand business, but I also have a compromising spirit for the greater good, especially when it comes to Black women! It’s one show, Kandi!
One thing Kandi is gonna do is come with the receipts!
Kandi, You cleared that business right up for me! Now I understand.
@Kandi, you should write a song for her. She's obviously envious of your star power and regretfully of you and Tiny success. Give her a song.
I think Xscape sells more tickets because SWV is not as entertaining. Love their songs, but they don’t give the best shows. Everyone knows Kandi is about her paper 😂 Can’t be mad about it.
Kandi is a business woman,so Business is Business!!
Thank u for stating facts.👌🏾 that ending was funny 😂  P.s. the ending credits song is dope…better than that other song u played in the stu on the show ijs
I understand what you are saying for the business, however for the purpose of this show was a collaborative effort.  Maybe the Queens of R&B with maybe two other artist as an opening act and you both headlining.  I agree with you that this was one time show. Maybe two one for the east/west coast.
Kandi so sweet🎉congrats on your 600k subs
Love how Kandi tells all the real of this business and this situation.
SWV got booed in STL because they were late. STL is brutal 😂
Thanks for explaining the SWV situation it makes sense now
So candy would do you want to start off with?, 🙍🏾‍♀️💬Tocha Tocha😅😅😅😅😅, to be honest the show is very irritating to me as a fan, because it seems like it's always a cliffhanger, it doesn't seem like your normal our reality show, once they get to the end, just like with Tameka and her mother, and on this episode, I had to check my phone, or whatever n b like, hold on what they mean by the next show, it's been an hour already, like I thought I hadn't even made it to the middle of this, and that's not fun at all, and it's almost the same way y'all feel, when LaTosha give y'all her ass to kiss, ijs, especially when we already know that we only got, 6 episodes, that means the show halfway over, Soooooooooo with that being said, chances are there's only going to be one show, that y'all do together with SWV, LaTocha is going to regret this for life, because she don't have a deal to be a gospel artist, and every time she do this, it's going to make candy not want to do it with her, and when her and her sister finally come to terms, that Tamika's not kissing they ass, and Tamika's not just going to let her sister do whatever she wants to do with her, then Tamika's going to expect Kandi to just welcome LaTocha back into the group, and that's not going to happen for as I'm concerned this should be the real Xscape 3 anyway🤷🏽‍♂️ I said what I said 🙋🏾‍♂️
Who was the editor for this video? The shade of it all😂😂😂...
When they started playing Tonight at that moment, it gave me chills!! Whew!!
One thing I can respect about you, Kandi, you are about your business! You show us all how it’s done 👏so inspiring!!!!
She’s not fooling anyone. Tosha waits until Xscape is on the top in the spot light, then she tries to branch off. She wants to come up with her album while they are are the up and up. Thinking she gonna be a hit. However one sound one voice. People love Xscape not just Tosha. Xscape was my favorite group so I knew Kandi was telling the truth. I met Kandi and what you see is the Kandi you get. She’s not one of the fake ones. She is a beautiful person inside and outside. I had the pleasure of meeting her twice and looking forward again. Smooches
NE would be the headliner in my eyes, but she said BBD which is different.
Schooling us on Why you don’t want to coheadline from the business side, and being transparent still doesn’t make it right. Ppl rob people because they’re greedy or poor, it doesn’t make it right if they plead guilty and explain their financial situation. Just because you can make sense of it business wise does not make it ok. SWV and their managers would not be putting it on the table if it wasn’t an option. What you just explained is still your choice! And that’s what’s crazy
2 things Kandi gon do: 1) Be abt business 2) Provide receipts ✅💰
The tone has to be set in the beginning. *Noted!
I couldn’t even imagine the songs Kandi led with toscha singing the lead instead
Love that kandi b about the business.
Producer: but how can LaTocha get away with this in the interviews???  Kandi: that's CUH SHE BE LYIIIINNNNNN "in extreme #SouthernDrawl" 😅😅😅😅😅😅
Y’all should’ve given her deadline to make her decision and if she missed it y’all as a group should’ve voted to move forward without her
The business part PEOPLE LISTEN  y'all thought Kat Williams was crazy he told y'all first everything is about ticket sales in the NOW. Kandi said this more than once and there are women in these comments who still think Mo'Nique was correct about the headlining with DL and Amy Schummer. Please pay attention this is why Mo'Nique was wrong not for the stance on how Netflix played her but for her making it be about the "LOW Balling" narrative.  Kat Williams told us all the truth as to why his Netflix money is long it is based on your ticket sales. So please remember this when y'all back Mo'Nique in her shenanigans
I love how Kandi incorporates YouTubers in her videos, her posts on social media. She seems such a lovely and genuine person. Keep them receipts coming Kandi ☺️🥰🤗
Kandi I didn’t know Miss Gloria was the 5th member lol. Tameka needs to love her and her sister from a distance.
I couldn’t wait for this! B/c this is the truth!
I don't see how she's doing gospel music and moving ungodly.
Kandi, I was a bit disappointed when you insisted that XSCAPE should headline the One Night Only concert. Lets review some numbers, Based on RIAA, SWV sold 11.5 mil (not the 30mil stated by COCO) vs XSCAPE 9 mil. SWV came out  in 1988 Before XSCAPE 1991. Per BILLBOARD's scoring of Versuz, SWV won 13-11, Now, Ms Kandi, CO-BILLING is the only Respectful way to go. I'm a NewYorker living in the ATL since '94. Love both groups but IJS Sis.
Tocha aint bringing nothing to the table is ambiguity... she dont know ... she gotta pray ... she gotta think about it ... girl let's go the camera's ready!!! Let's get on with it and sit down rocky please.
Alright Kandi !! I'll admit I was wrong .. Ill give you this one lol
Thanks for keeping us in the loop girl!! I love the way you keep it real❤ I understand your point of view and agree 100% See you Detroit 😆
I love Kandi she abt that bread baby
Nowwww, the math is mathing!   I was saying like whose doing the math around here this new business math, and yesssss where do they do that at?😂😂😂😂Also gurrrlll, when I heard the pow pow, I was like ohh shhh, what in the Sam H is going on at her house, I was like guuurrlll, I can’t even save you!!  I was scared as H!!!!
Kandi- this hate that these people keep trying to pile on-  is getting ya good sis a lil tight!!!! KEEP STANDING STRONG MRS BURRUS TUCKA!!!!!!!!! I love the Kandi movement.
I'm just LOVING he editing of this video!!! Hahahahaha. Kudos 😂❤
Tocha is doing exactly what we all thought, trying to cut a solo album. And honestly, i think y'all better without her. Sorry not sorry.
I understand from a business standpoint what Kandi was saying.  After hearing Taj, I understand what she's saying. There are a lot of layers. If this was a series of standard concerts, Xscape, (because of Kandi's big fan base) should be the headliner. If this is one show based on a collaborative event like Versus with both groups on stage at the same time, should be co headliners and the split should have been negotiated. SWV could also make the point that you don't who you're gonna get with Xscape. May or not be Kandi, may or not be Tocha. Regardless, management should have handled this and it wouldn't seem so personal.😊
HONESTLY... IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO PERFORMS FIRST, LAST, IN THE MIDDLE... THE FACT THERE'S A (CHECK) AWAITING MY PRESENTS AND MY MORTGAGE, CAR NOTES, BANK ACCOUNT SECURED... I'M STRAIGHT... 👍💯
I just hope her mother was being genuine and not gaslighting. For the camera
I didn't quite understand Tocha's secrecy either. Every one in the group including the 5th member, seems so supportive so she could have done well.  But in the words of Nene, you don't win when you play dirty.
Kandi you're the most honest and reliable source of explaining and speaking the truth. I love love love your realness, and  honesty in your intertainment businesses.
Hey Kandi.  I negotiate millions of dollars of contracts and I feel you on those negotiations and bringing g up the difficult conversations. Unfortunately you need to work through it and finalize.  In life you can't do anything until the contract is signed. Buying a house, a car etc.  I always tell people learn how to read contracts and don't be afraid to ask.  The worst thing they can say is no and you take it from there.
Kandi gone always keep it together😊
I do love me some Kandi, and I understand what she is saying about the business.  It is about who can sell out shows today.  Coko is always gonna be Coko though.   If I had that voice, I would say whatever the hell I wanted to say too.  None of these women can stand toe to toe vocally with Coko.... few can.  Put Coko next to anyone and she will still shine vocally....periodt!  Coko is basically saying none of y'all hoes can outsing me...which is true.  In her head, that is the headline.
I like SWV but since day one i have been a Kandi fan and actually pay attention to the business side when everyone speaks, and if you listen Kandi is right and she has every right to look after the business side, there is a reason Kandi is as successful as she is and the others are not!!🥰😘
Business is business. Love that. ❤ Love Her honesty!!!
I love that u are pulling out the receipts and speaking on this , we.  Can see the real from the fake. ❤
My mom and older sister is like tamika mom. I keep distance from them both. We say hi here and there. It’s best that’s way. A simple conversation always turns into an argument. I’m Good  ✌🏻
I saw no problem with Xscape headlining you all sound better than swv .
Kandi gone be real and give it to you and im here for it. Obviously Rocky has filled tasha head with Rocks 😂.
Kandi your so humble stand your griund❤
I guess when tasha need that money hwrr energy right with the group huh😂.
Girl, no one is calling Xscape to go to Africa. Y’all better coheadline that concert. SWV is just better known than Xscape, I’m sorrrrry. Being reality stars does not make you entitled to headline a tour between SWV and your group. Y’all gotta be delusional…lol Michael Jackson is on one of their songs. I mean c’mon 😂😂
Can u drop come clean add Tamika Scott and drop it and drop only for u please I’m sick of u holding onto the gold lol miss Lenice B❤
Come on Kandi, get the BUSINESS/FINANCES/TICKET SALES STRAIGHT!!!🤑🤑🤑💰💰💲💲
Look Tocha wants to become the business person you are Kandi she can't stand the ideal of you being so successful, because making money is making money!! Tocha has a serious problem with You,because you are still in the industry and has multiple things going on and she just can't get to the point where you are,and until she can gets your kind of Grind without those negative people in her ear it's always going to be a conflict period.  Tocha does have a beautiful voice but she wants to stand in Front Period!!! With all do respect she wants to say to you I got the control of negotiation and nothing to do anything Kandi is involved in
Kandie is and always been fair and humble . That is why she gets so many open doors ❤
I’ve seen both groups LIVE in concert. SWV blew me out the park. For them to be the big sisters they put on a show, and every song hit. So I would love to see you both. But from experience if anything swv should definitely be headlining. No shade!
They should just ALTERNATE HEADLINING. Very simple fix but they are ego driven
Kandi keep it fucking real I love her
I just want to say this was a powerful episode for so many reasons I cried through the whole thing thank you ladies for sharing your story candy girl you rock and I hope that Tasha and Tamika can heal thank you ladies I am SWV and Escape I love both of you ladies and thank you thank you I cannot say it enough thank you for candy you my girl❤❤
Kandi be having them receipts!!!
Took us to school 🏫 📝 lol 😂
It always kills me this praying before a show as if shaking your boots onstage is honoring their mythical "god" in anyway.
Business is Business. Work out a great deal- collectively-together, both groups. I wouldnt doubt SwV's sales because they are worldwide. Multiple sources have cited them at 25- 40 million. Regardless, they're a bigger group.  Xscape (Kandi)  and Tiny? is business savvy. SWV is more popular. Per spotify tofay Xscape has  800K monthly listners. SWv has over 3 milliom monthly listners. Xscape should close in Atlanta/ All Georgia cities and SWV should close out all of the other cities. Nothing in Xscapes catalog is bigger than Weak or The Right Here Human NAture (remix). You always close out shows with the biggest song (s). SWV has hype/club party/dance music as well. Xscape is mostly slow ballads. I love both groups but as a promoter this would be my approach.
Tocha still trying to find a way to separate herself from the Group. Kandi and Tiny became very known in the reality TV world, co wrote a Grammy winning song for TLC… and I’m sure that’s hard to grasp when you want equal success for yourself outside the group but I do not like Tocha’s spirit at all. I feel like she goes about everything the wrong way as we have seen.
That's right kandi it's business !!   Nobody is giving there coin away
Baby when Kandi showed the receipts of SWV opening for them SEVERAL times from the past and recently….I giggled 🤭. Facts are facts. It is what it is.
One thing I respect about Kandi is her being able to breakdown the facts & make it make sense!
But that was y’all tour this is a collective tour
I will never dislike you; it’s business as usual ❤
Ok business Lady Kandi
SWV sold 25 million records…not albums. Xscape I think it was 7 or 9 million records not albums sold. That’s a pretty big difference & I get where SWV is coming from. I agree with everything else you said Kandi
Every since Kim burned Kandi She don’t play no games with people And she shouldn’t she works hard and it shows…
Why don't you just cut her out of the group and do the tour without🤔 you don't do the tour you don't get a check🤔🤔F*** her and get your money
Kandi Receipts Burruss
I understand now about the business
I like you Kandi but you were definitely tripping about the headliner situation!    There was no need to bring up extra drama.  You can't compare this deal to other deals!  Y'all were coming together and you shoulda just left it at that. Both groups bring alot to the table.  They coulda brought up the fact that when it comes Xscape you don't know what you're going to get.  Xscape is a 4 person group.  No need to diminish their accomplishments because thats what you were doing.
Kandi is a Boss and a Business Woman so when she speaks it pays to listen. I love SWV & Xscape
“If ya had an ass to kiss” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I respect Kandi’s business acumen, and I love how she breaks it down and makes it easy to understand. TBH, it’s possible for a YT only personality to outsell a popular 90’s group. It’s about your social value today.
I love how Kandi is TIRED of misinformation 😂 getting straight to facts
The only issue I have with speak on it  is it seem like the person that be asking her questions has already picked a side like why not be open minded about the whole situation not just cause it’s your friend or whatever the case may be .
Tea and Ki Ki's aside. Kandi went in on the business, probability and statistic aspects of touring, album sales, numbers, and demand... Smh, she understands and explained the infrastructure of the music business and how the money aspect of it works like a BOSS! I felt like I was in Finance or Economics class again!! No wonders she's Wealthy.🖤👑💎
Latosha is coming across as a very egomaniacal narcissistic person. I would not trust her husband to walk my dog let alone have anything to do with the business side.
They were invited to headline for Xscape. This is something combined without separating the groups with tension is probably what they were looking for at that time.
10:56 She’s on that Rocky😅 seems like her husband has been manipulating her for HIS benefit since the beginning….😞
Ok Kandi keep speaking on it l love your break downs so i can wind mill when I am on other content creator platform.
The ending part so funny not Kandi thought rock.....nevermind 😅 we love kandi
Oh these youtubers highlighted about to get their entire lives lol
I love Kandi as a business woman she makes a lot of sense
Tell them Kandi!! but I was very much educated by this. I'm ready for the next episode already
Her voice is hideous
Will you let AOne host the reunion on your Youtube Channel?!?!?!! Or KEMPIRE!!!
She had plenty of time to go solo esp the 20 yrs they was not doing shit
Glad Kandi touched on that. Last show she needed Kandi to get on board and star doing shows so the group can get back together and now she is ghosting them. It definitely isn't good to set up new business and inform them that your current group members or current business partners have no idea you're doing side business
Kandi definitely explained the headliner situation clearly and professionally. I get it now. Sorry for the previous sideye... 😂
Any comment or clarification on what Tamar said about you & Todd on Andy’s WWHL?
Y’all should have been able to come together since this would have been a totally new tour ! Not going off of y’all past tour that y’all headlined
It makes more sense now that Kandi explained everything. Also, we don't know the inns & out of their business so we really can't speculate off of our emotion. I love both groups.
Yall can't kick her out the group.
i like u more after watching this kandi.  the vid makes total sense….  because even she realized that she looked kindda crazy on the show last night bringing it up and insisting it
💐💐😘 I love me some Kandi 🍭🍬🍫
Kandi is strictly business that is why she has 6 times the money and net worth of all of them.🤔
Kandi is a BUSINESS WOMAN....PERIOD
And the MoMA kept cutting her off on every word
KANDI WHOEVER DO THE EDITING NEED A RAISE!!! I fell out when I seen Aunt Joyce “imma tell the truth” clip 😭😭😂😂😂
I respect it!
Thank God for your good Business Sense Kandi cause you broke it down so any Simple Minded should understand. I think most entertainers does Not handle business negotiations, they just get their money. Girl it’s obvious to me You know Both the Business and Entertainment end of Performances. Kudos to you Kandi, hang in there. 😅😅😅
13:47 - Ha! I knew I sensed some similar sinister, envious vibes in both CoKo and Tocha. I think CoKo’s issue was more ego than anything.
The outro is soo catchy
Ain’t Tocha the one who was sitting in Tiny living room telling Tamika she ain’t wanna discuss their business in front of their own group, but she can run down on Taj and tell what should be group business.
Kandi brings the receipts and I can see her perspective. I think it's a difference when you go on your tour. They got this opportunity based on both groups being celebrated on versuz. I don't see why they can't co-headline and each group negotiates their pay. I love both groups and I would've loved to see them together.
Always love me some Kandi she keeps it real😂😂😂
*I love a good receipt! One thing Kandi is not, is a liar.*
No hate whatsoever, Kandi!!!! Thanks for breaking that explanation down though! 😃😃😃
I hear what u saying Kandi but co headlining would've boosted yall both...I think then combo of swv and xscape fans would've increased your fan base more than those who follow your shows....grandma may not watch RHOA but she know Coko and she know Kandi...she coming to the show with you both and more than likely when you all have your own shows...gaining a new fan
When y’all send y’all manger to meet Tocha at the car like the Temptations did David Ruffin, pls send out notifications so I can stop Wtf I’m doing and turn in.
Cant argue wit FACTS or as YT folks call it  DATA LOL
Tocha better humble herself and realize how things operate. Yes, she can sing- no doubt. CoKo can sing as well, but notice how that ego-driven solo career worked out. Maybe I’m missing something though. What does Tocha think will be different about this solo career? That powerhouse, evangelical, worship leader voice is running rampant in very black community and church. Tocha better spend some time scrolling social media.  I’m not sure who’s of the opinion that Kandi can’t sing (baffles me). She is the “Xscape” sound. There is no debating that. That couldn’t be duplicated, which is one of many reasons they were more commercially successful than SWV (a group I also love).
I was waiting on this platform  love ya Boss KBT❤
I very much still want the swv- xscape tour or concert. I want to sing all of the jams.
I have to have expectations set at the onset irrespective of comfort.
Kandi is clearly the biggest female boss that we’ve seen thus far.
Lets not act like SWV isn’t THAT group I love xscape but I’m personally going to choose SWV over xscape lol I understand it’s “business” but I would expect xscape to open for SWV
I think the way she moves, she's trying to hurt you guys, like she thinks surprising ya'll with the solo project will hurt Escape. She needs help.
Now that I think about it, SWV probably assumed they would co-headline the show/tour because they're doing this reality show together but Kandi is right. Your fee is your fee! If Xscape gets paid a certain fee, why would they low ball themselves?? SWV has a fee as well....which apparently is not as much as Xscape - who have headlined more than SWV in recent years. Business is business....and we ALL know Kandi is going to handle her business! Any/all of them....
What are starting with? TASHA! What about? TASHA🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
She just can't keep up with all the lies😂 She just says what she needs to say at that moment to look good!
Swv has been headlining their own tours. But you have a following but are they all buying your tickets? You all are social media famous too. Swv has fans and influence. Just because they were guest before doesn’t mean now? I would definitely see SWV before Xscape honestly.
Kandi I respect you even more. You are so right, it's a business. You guys have introduced your music to the newer generations because of RHOA, etc. So Kudo's to you. New fan here
After watching this show it’s no way I can listen to any gospel from Tocha. Yikes…
The my opened bc it was YOUR TOUR! This wasn’t YOUR TOUR! You’re missing it on purpose lol
One thing about Kandi Burrus, she gon' talk di tingz💯 Kandi, you should change your name to Candid cause gurl😏 Thanks for explaining the headlining vs co-headlining cause I wasn't sure where you were coming from. I still think you should both headline and not take a cut but have the promoters level up (although I know it's easier said than done) but I now see where you're coming from. Keep speakin' on it girl. Your viewers enjoy it so much. Congratulations on the 600k followers🎉
Yes, Kandi got receipts and they previously headlined…but I still think in THIS situation it should be a co-headline!!
Ticket sales and record sales are not the same. Artists are definitely not the same live as they are their albums. There are artists that I have their cds that I have not seen nor do I want to see perform live in the year 2023 and beyond
Kandi you are the only one who always speakers truth and can see both sides of the situation. The most honest one of all these "reality" shows. That's why we love watching you. They will never let you go, unless you have had enough of them, you spot is solid!
Emphasis on Tocha contradicting herself on every episode! From not greeting her sis with a hug but next episode she says she greets her with one everytime she she her then the edits show her barely even acknowledging her sis. Then episode 2 shows her negative energy when she walks in the room it changes.   I'm actually glad to watch the show bc I admit I was one of the people side eyeing the group with the dress situation but this show brings it all back in full circle. (So I APOLOGIZE TO KANDI, TINY & MIKA)  Lastly, Tocha and her mom's silence spoke volume when Mika mention that $30k being stolen. I believe Mika. And people is getting on my nerves with well why she just bringing it up or why she never did anything about it. I recommend those people rewatching episode 1. She said she didn't want her sis to go to jail which is why she didn't file against it. But I wish she had! And the MoMA Sorry she's Toxic! Her mom definitely treated her differently bc everytime she see her she sees their father in Mika. Yet she gaslighting her was so disheartening.
Both successful groups End Of The Day Numbers Don't Lie MY Love 💯
Kandi…. Side note 📝  I love when you cry
BUT in the videos Kandi shared, it sounds like that was Xscape's 25 year anniversary whereas on the show now, it sounds like it's a different situation where it's SWV's 30 year anniversary and will be Xscapes afterwards so maybe that's where the miscommunication is.
Her "receipts" on SWV lack PROPER context.  Xscape did a 30 city tour with various opening acts and SWV opened in SELECT dates not the entire tour.  The REALITY SHOW done for THAT tour featured Xscape and only Xscape unlike these Queens of R&B stuff where SWV is in it start to finish.  Love both groups but Kandi is not comparing apples to apples
With all do respect , I've never seen Xscape singing free in the park in Atlanta at Windown Wednesday. SWV is a different story.😂 😂
Can you speak on the Tamar situation? 👀
Love Kempire🐘
😂😂😂😂 Yo the ending had me dying.... congratulations Kandi and the gang!!
Everyone talkin about Xscape, they fees, and Im team Kandi on that one. Her pedigree in business in stellar. But what I wanna know is DOES SWV all make the same pay? Cuz we all know COKO is SWV, do they all make the same?
Kandi and Tiny alone has stayed relevant enough today that the reach across all age brackets. They are the Headliners
Ppl are easily manipulated now a days. They follow blindly without any thought.
LaToche doesn’t look good and should have done her research for what reality tv is. The format doesn’t work for her. She was clearly giving negative energy. Kandi is THE REASON and THE CONNECTION for Bravo. It’s a slap in the face and no one “owes” Toche anything. No one “owes” Rocky anything. It is really unbecoming and to use god, the Bible, or Christianity to defend your nasty and backhanded intentions is not right. It’s why people don’t like religious people. When you are being sneaky you need to own it. You don’t need to pretend the devil made you sneaky. You were being sneaky. Period.
Oh lord why did you use Kampire’s video people be thinking kandi has kamp on her payroll🤣🤣🤣❤️ both you all
Where they do that at?
I loveeeeee my Taurus sister Kandi! She gone break it down and give you the receipts to go with it! Thank you for being transparent and giving it to us raw!
Drop them receipts on her sister period ‼️‼️‼️
The thing is, SWV didn’t bring their ego, they just wanted to co-headline, which made sense! Yes its business but lets talk reality, Kandi & Tiny were the loudest & voices are the weakest (no knees)  💁🏽‍♂️
I figured it was about this affecting y’all fees.
Kandi I get what you’re saying but SWV just headlined a show I saw last summer in Detroit. I saw them three or four years prior… they headlined that one too.🤷🏿‍♀️
I love when they edit the voice change 🤣🤣🤣 it’s hilarious
When I first heard Just kick. I was Kandi's voice that I loved on that song. It really put them on. Kandi can sing and write. Kandi is a very talented business women, wife, and mom.
Kandi ❤I love this Taurus ♉️ energy Kandi Martell you a joke but she'll never tell you a lie ❤
Mama Joyce is the 5th member, not Tamika's mom.
Tamikas mom yelled at her and made it about her instead of listening and showing empathy towards what her daughter was feeling
Receipts don't lie 🙄
All Facts!!!
Is it possible to remove Tocha from the group? Destiny's Child went from 4 to 3 and still did that thing! Xscape will still be on top with only 3 members because the harmony is great!
I hope SWV will listen to this and do less shows for more money.
Girl I cried like a baby too😢
Kandie can get America back on budget because she gone definitely get down to the bottom dollar with the receipt.
Taj from SWV reminds me of Cynthia Bailey! She’s so sweet and the bridge foR everyone just like Cynthia. She’s so nice.
Now, I just wanted to hear 🎶every man wants a woman 🎶😂 @28:49
It really grinds my gears to see mothers put that guilt of "I supported you" to their children..its what a mother is supposed to do..
Explaining the headlining thing made a whole lot of sense. It is unrealistic for SWV to want the same amount of money if the bulk of sales are coming from Xscape. Be fr! The fans and them have to take the feelings outta this sh*t & call it for what it is. Sounds like they want some for nothin and that ego took a hit IMO.
Sorry Kandi, but there is no way to justify this! A real business woman would be okay with a pay cut for ONE show if that means everybody eats. It doesn’t make sense for exscape to take top billing if at any given moment y’all can go from a quartet to a trio..and worse case scenario a duo given the situation between the Scott sisters.
Ok Kandi I understand the business now that you broke it down.
I think Rocky is Latosha:s enemy, he is the root of her unhappiness, but she's blaming the group for her unhappiness
And this is why I love Kandi!!! You’re a businesswoman and I love how you handle your business!! Keep going!!🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
I have always been team Kandi because you have always remained 💯 no phoney mess, you have a business mind, and keep a bag without someone telling you what to do! Hugs and blessings gurl!❤
Love you girl❤❤❤❤❤
I cried too..i really feel Tamika’s pain. 😢
Kandi do your thing girl!!!
Hey kandi can u release tht song was playin at end of video plz ❤thanx 😊 u
I have a new found respect for Kandi and I appreciate her honesty
I believe anything Kandi tells me cos she’s been more creditable than the news.
I literally just love Kandi. As a Virgo, I find that l really take to Tauruses.
HEY KANDI I'M GONNA SPEAK ON IT YALL GOT MORE BEEF 🥩 THAN ALL THE COWS 🐄 IN THE ATL. YALL NEED TO XSCAPE BACK INTO RETIREMENT HOW DARE YALL THINK YALL SUPPOSED TO HEADLINE & GET PAID MORE MONEY 💰 THAN SWV. THEY SMOKED 🚬 YALL LIKE A CIGARETTE 🚬 IN THE VERSUS BATTLE. KANDI THEY MADE YALL LOOK LIKE BEAVIS & BUTHEAD NO SHADE.😎😎😎😎
It’s all about the business!
Kandi is that lady boss she really SPEAK ON IT!!! Tamika was right about her sister and her mommy. But she got to move on from her family. Latasha and her husband really owe that girl her $35,000.00 + money (royalties). They need to pay her she has a family and grandchildren to support. Love u Kandi ❤
Now Kandi girl I love you, but at the end of the day both group should headline. Greed always ruins relationships.
I ❤ how the shade ?s comes from unseen female with effects😂😂
I love me some Kandi 🤎🤎🤎. Always learning from you. Thank you for the clarification, but be sure that I can never hate you. Business is Business.
Kandi gonna tell the truth nie. Lol
I love Kandi's business sense and how she is not afraid to be the boss chic in any situation. The rest of Xscape sat there silent while Kandi spoke up for Xscape. SWV was united with all of them showing disappointment. At the meeting, Xscape made Kandi look like she was the only one with the issue. Continue being a boss, Kandi, n every room you enter.
Now the last 30 seconds was funny
I don't see the problem with splitting its only 1 show not a whole tour right the fan base comes from Kandi and tiny Idk just get on stage and sing 😂😂😂😂
Girl, between Tamar, SWV, and Tocha, you been getting ate up!
I watch speak on it before the episode.. or just speak on it…lol great content… keep doing your thang Kandi .. I’m always rooting for you and your family.
Kansas City mo it was great show
Kandi still doesn’t make sense. Your big reunion tour yes SWV would not co-headline with you. But that’s not this. 🤦🏾‍♀️ False equivalence.
BBD should have actually been the headliners they have 40 years in the game
If Tocha wants to be solo she should be respectful enough to tell the group. And she told someone outside the group so that it would get back to the group. A weak move on her part.
The voice impressions take me out every time 🤣🤣
The voice impressions take me out every time 🤣🤣
Kandi, you cool as hell. Thanks for breaking down why u brought that up in the meeting cause I was one of the ones with a twisted face😂 great job explaining it.
I think the word collaboration is throwing this business conversation off.
Mask singer proved Kandi can sing any type of music
Thanks for explaining the business side Kandi 🎉 I understand what you’re saying and I’m buying what you are selling, it makes sense to me. Love both groups equally 💕💕💕
Kandi but SWV was lie to get them on the show. I felted like they were ambush. No way in they agree to reality show on those terms. Everybody and their mama knows that. So shut the hell up bitches!!!
Yelp!!! Business is Business!!!❤️
I know about excape because of kandi and tiny. And i will go to a show to them.
What was hilarious is how all episode they caught Tiny rolling her eyes like “here we go with this shit”. She’s the peace maker but she sick of Tocha’s shit too! 😂
I understand your points but for a 1 night event you could have co headlined. I understand the money situation but that conversation should have been handled off camera
Tosha is mad because you have to plan your work and work your plan, she didn’t do that!.
Big up to Kandi for showcasing @Kempire and @BingeWorthy... them my boys❤❤❤ They be putting in the work to give the tea🍵 As in, they do real homework and top shelf recaps so BIg Up🎉🎊💥
We don't hate you auntie. You ALWAYS keep it a buck. Business is BUSINESS. And unfortunately for some, the reality of some ish is a little stronger to swallow. Xscape is just more bankable in ticket sales. It is what it is!  SIDE NOTE: It was NEVER a question for me if Kandi could sing. I actually thought it was hilarious when people started saying she couldn't. She is LITERALLY half of Xscape's sound lol.
Def feels like Tamika is the scapegoat in a narcissistic family system. My heart breaks for her.
Latocha feels she's the Beyonce of the group... But, the only thing her and Beyonce have in common is over singing... too many damn runs and being married to a cheating man. I love you Kandi... I now see why people keep your name in their mouth.
NO KANDI I WAS IN TEARS TOO. 😢❤ WITH THE SCENE W/ HER MOM
So Kandi how do you feel about Tocha still saying she’s a part of the group but not doing the shows? Are y’all contemplating removing her from the group from here on out?
Maybe if you spoke about heading lining before the cameras you could have save them the disrespect. Or head lining and split it in half since it was a collabrative. But this is why y’all don’t have anything going.   Also I can see why Toscha don’t want to tell any of y’all anything bc you all including you, you are mad negative holding ppls past against then and talking mad smack about her. Clearly you don’t like and disingenuous. And you still sound like a billy goat
I love me some Kandi! I don’t understand why people don’t like her. I am not even halfway through the video and I know her headline issue is about contracts/business… also, her band mates were silent per editing but they were with her on it, she just took the lead. LaTocha is insufferable, I really do not like her chapter, the other women will be fine and healthy without her. Please move on from that energy vampire. She can sing but so can other members and ain’t no one trying to hear runs throughout the whole damn song, we won’t miss her due to that and her attitude. Koko’s son needs to keep his day job, his voice is just ok.
Kandi thanks for the breakdown, at first i was looking at you with side eyes, but then reserved judgment until I watched Speak on it- and am glad that I did- your explanation makes perfect business sense 😀
Please let Tocha go!!!  All of the negative energy that she brings is out of date and time! 💯
No one can deny Kandi is the most logical business savy woman in this group. You’re inspiring!
This breakdown was helpful bc I was looking at Kandi sideways lol
SWV going on first during your tour is a totally different circumstance. All the circumstances you came up with has nothing to do with this situation. Not sure why you can’t share equally. Kandi’s explanation sounds very disrespectful and sounds very condescending to me and I am a fan of both groups.
This definitely gotta be a scheme set up by Todd for the viewers to debate. Cause yall have 3 upcoming shows where yall are co-headlining with Tyrese, Monica, and Bell Biv DeVoe with a ton of other artists that are opening up.   Make it make sense.
I didn’t understand during the show about the headliner situation but I agree with Kandi. If that’s the way it’s BEEN then why are they acting surprised?? Smh
Kandi. I really and truly believe what we see is what we get with you. It’s not an act. Your energy and aura is infectious and you exude positivity.
We don’t hate u Kandi, we appreciate your transparency as it provides THE complete picture and information to support FACTS
They hate Kandi everytime because she literally ALWAYS makes sense
Team Kandi, I love the fact Kandi is genuine and has never changed who she’s been..
I get what you were saying Kandi, however, your approach was a bit arrogant and IF you're doing a "JOINT collaboration, it seems that a CO-HEADLINER deal would be reasonable. Just my thoughts 🤷🏾‍♀️
I had a different opinion before this speak on it..makes perfect sense to me and it would be Kandi the most business minded.
Like. Candy.  But. Definitely co Headlining is the way to go with SWV !!!!
Speak on it spokeperson. Talk yo knowledge to those managers
Came on to hear what you had to say about the headliner situation. I do know the concert went on, however I’m not aware of how the details panned out.  Since you’re Career begun, to Housewives up until this new show with the group, I have personally never seen any real fault or disagreed with anything you’ve done or said. It may be because our birthdays are close and I’m a Taurus. I also admire and think how you do mostly. However, this last episode I had to turn my head like huh? The whole headlining situation came off a certain way and egotistical. I’ve never seen that in you and I hope it’s explain here and it was resolved.  Otherwise, keep being the legend you are!! 🫶🏾  Edit: Now I completely understand. However, may be it could of came out differently or been a compromise since it’s a joint show. But Everything you said made sense about the billing.
Kandi gone keep it real and I appreciate that! It be the receipts for me honey! I live for it!
Ah, I love when Kandi puts her business acumen on display. It's why there was a whole class taught behind her business decisions.
Kandi explained it well, and i fully understand. Business is business. I dont blame her
SWV and Xscape should be on equal footing on their show.  Period.
I can understand both groups side. Yes Kandi and Tiny have been on reality TV which create more fan base for the group  Xscape which is how the world is now because of the economy. But what Kandi has to realized that not only just SWV sold way more records than Xscape, SWV is more iconic and internationally recognized than Xscape. Xscape is only more well known in the USA. SWV first album sold the same amount of records sales in the USA as all of the 3 Xscape albums combined. SWV first album sold 3 million alone and all of Xscape three albums sold 1 million each. Kandi is a business woman and she understand the industry and how it operates now compare to 20 years ago, and that's why she stays on RHOA she knows the show keeps her in the public and able to earn more money
If that’s the case a lot of people open for y’all on that tour. Y’all had a lot of “special guest” spots. They did not tour with y’all that whole tour that was only a spot date for y’all as friends they did. Come down out the air.
Don Juan wit the shit 😊
That's b/c of Kandi & Tiny's success but I respect it now that I have more information.
I LOVE Xscape but I lean towards SWV more. However, what Kandi says makes sense. I like that she stands by what she says.
Kandi you don't play around with your bag 💰💰💰 Came rite wit it... 😂😂😂
Yeah okay Kandi I hear you business wise as far as the SWV scene but it came off cocky and rude and like you were bringing your Escape drama to this situation. So  business is business that's understood but the esthetic on air sucked. Sorry 🤷🏾‍♀️
If anything we see who is the problem of xscape which you have said that in the past she used you all to get where she gong tocha is a wonderful singer but she a sneaky somebody lol
I love you down Khandi. however, on this one you come off greedy sis.💁🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
I cry so hard in that scene Because I just lost my mom I wish I could talk to you right now
Kandi about to hit 1 million on YouTube  !! With these reviews and show hunny and I’m loving it❤🎉
One thing about Kandi she is going to tell the truth and she will also hold herself accountable when she needs to. I love that about her❤
But Kandi got that money though 😄
OK SO I LOVE SWV AND XSCAPE...BUT WHY CAN'T ONE GROUP HEADLINE FOR HALF OF THE TOUR AND THE OTHER GROUP HEADLINE THE 2ND LEG OF THE TOUR....SO EVERYONE CAN EAT EQUALLY...AND IT NOT BE AN ISSUE AMONGST THE GROUPS!!!?
The girls (Tomicka and Toshas) mother clearly and obviously sides with Tosha. I also cried.
Riley can do entertainment LAW....Ugh im disappointed at what she wants to do now but its her life....we will support on the side. Its all about being happy! ❤
Thank you for breaking it down for us non industry folks Kandi! Makes business sense to me what you are saying!
I mean who even checking for y’all now though? Y’all sing flat a lot. People were excited about the first tour because it was the first time in ages. Now, we are over it. Them same old slow songs have gotten tired. Chile stop flexing.
Kandi Xscape can't even stay together.
Love me some Kandi’s sound effects and receipts.
Kandi and Tiny you LADIES ARE BUSINESS WOMEN. So it's hard explaining to bird brain people. Lol I love you both stay classy and BOSS ladies.
So what they opened for you that was on your tour.... that does not mean anything about this show that yall were talking about... your personality is questionable you just know how to play these cameras better. You and Tocha are very similar thats why yall can't get along
Swv has been played on the radio for 30 years straight. They don't play Xscape in nyc.
Kandi you do complain ALOT!!  Dang I could see how it would be difficult to work w/ you
Why can’t these videos go Picture in Picture. I need to multitask while I get my reality tv drama.
If “🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️I HAVE THE RECEIPTS!” Was a person 😂😂😂(In my Kandi laugh)
Kandi your expressions give me life! ☠️🤣
Kandi is all about the business....its always the broke ones that want to stop the show😮
19:08 Kandi hit the hammer on the nail cause she most definitely is her worst enemy
Kandi you should be happy! Good riddance watch the peace and harmony you three will have with the toxic one gone. I happy for for the three of you!
KANDI, that's RIGHT 👍 stay CLASSY. you and Todd is a good looking couple. And you have a GREAT TEAM, GOD BLESS YOU ALL 🙏❣️
She (Rocky) was begging you to come back to use your clout for her fake ass solo deal. She will flop again and again. I hope y'all don't let her back.
Kandi…you are the 💣 ‼️Speakonit… And that’s why you are the business woman you are. 💰💰💰💵💵💵
Tocha & Coko  are both two jealous individuals who has bull**** going on @ home w/ no control. #Dramafilled
I love you to pieces, Kandi Kane!!!!!!❤
I'm gone tell the truth 😂😂😂😂
Kandi shud def understand Tamika Issue bcuz Joyce is the third member of her marriage
LaTocha is selfish, toxic, and entitled.  Yeh, she can sing, but that attitude...Hell Nah!! All of yall can sing, and Kandi you do have a very distinctive voice.  But I ain't heard  nobody else in the group hit that damn high note you hit. Ijs
💚🎉💚🎉💚
Imma need Tameka to get counseling on how to let momma go!!! You can love from a distance.
🫶🏽speak🤌🏾on👏🏾iiiiiit✌🏾
Loving the show. I pray things get better. Congratulations Kandi
Good morning BEAUTIFUL KANDI, please stop giving Toucha attention. Because she's not going far in my eyes. She tour only to make money to do her own music, stop helping her. KANDI. You have a unique voice. Please focus on you. Let her go. And focus on being a wonderful wife to TODD ❤️. And a mom and a balling  BOSS. PRAY keep yourself covered 🙏 threw PRAYING. So forget about her because the more you speak Toucha name you looking like a hater. Stay GREAT 👍 and let the others hate. Love you 😘❤️ Kandi I Rock with you. One think for sure Toucha know you're a REAL BOSS LADY.
Kandi I like you but, yes SWV opened up for your tour as a Celebration of Xscape reuniting again. On this TV Show considering you two groups are both staring acts it should be equal. SWV headline one state & Xscape headlines the next state .....and so on.
Kandi is about the bag. I’m not mad. Someone has to address it.
Thank you for showing love to the you tubers. Especially dj Richie skye he is my fav
Love Kandi ❤ and her out right Honesty  ✅  Loving the Trio!!! 🎶 🎵 Keep Doing What You Are Doing!! You  Winning🎉🎉🎉
Can’t y’all co headline & still both get y’all same fee.
Sounds like everyone is bringing emotions to the table, while Kandi is bringing business.
F the BS!  Money comes before all of the Drama! Why? Because you have to take care of your family and make sure all your bills is paid! I keep telling y’all being hateful, ignorant jealousy and nasty is gonna keep you broke because cause nobody want to deal with that foolishness.
Riley looks just like you. Oh my goodness. That smile.
Not gospel 😩😭 ion think I need that spirit reaching over in my atmosphere lol ILL PASS 👋🏽 noooo ma’am
So once an opener always an opener? Lol okay
Yall tried it with SWV!!!! Kandi!! U know I fux with yall!!! But u know yall need to Co-Headline!
Kandi Swv is better than Xscape.
I Love me some Kandi! She keeps it all the way REAL!
Showing all that footage from 2018, where SWV were "special guest" doesn't solidify anything to me. The fair thing is to co-headline. Especially if the promoter suggested it. It still feels very egotistical to me because you can still be fair in business. And SWV is capable of outselling their own show. Which proves they do have their own fan base. And they won the Verzuz battle, which technically proves, they're a better group. I'll rather go see them. But honestly, I would rather support both❤❤
When they shot that confetti, it scared me, too.😂😂😂
I think she wanted to make sure she got the deal before she committed to the tour
Kandi what did you count because they just updated to 40 million records a few months ago.
My girl Kandi gon tell the truth.
You and Tiny just need to get to writing some new hits for the new group. Tocha is holding yall up on purpose. She doesn't want to see y'all be successful and it's sad.
🎉🎉🎉🎉 loved this episode.
Co-headline make it Xscape and SWV
Hey Kandi! I’ve been waiting forever to see this new episode of Speak on it episode #3 love you 👩🏾🍫🔥🥰❤️💯
As soon as I hear someone say  “Kandi can’t sang” I quickly ask them if she can’t sing how has she made a living as a singer🤔 just say you don’t prefer her singing but don’t say she can’t.
A fool opens and a diva closed thats what i Learned in the drag show community 😂
U know Kandi a real Taurus ♉️ just like me iam team receipts
Kandi is super business savvy. She broke those numbers down.
Kandi isn't my favorite but respect her. I don't think she's a liar. She tells the truth and brings receipts.  I can't wait for her to gather Tamar!!!!
I love u @Kandi period and Tocha is 😢
If Kandi hooked up with Jermaine How old was she? because this man is certainly older than her. Isn't Jermain the same age as Janet Jackson? Having your husband as a manager is not a good idea. There are several Women who have done this and it never ends well.
@kempire!
I remember when LeeLee was going through it. She came to Atlanta back in the day to get her GED. She was in class with my ex. Very cool and sweet young lady.
One Thing About Us TAURUS…. When We Speak We Going To Make Sure… WE CAN BACK IT UP WITH #FACTS
I just love Kandi
She need to cut her mama and that bogus sister off. Period.
Yeah Xscape should never been  headliner for SWV especially Bev Biv & DeVoe Buuuut if it started that way then it may be too late to make changes now.
I had that dynamic with my mom hearing me and not hearing me.  My regret I’m haunted by is my mom died in 2005 and we never resolved our issues.   😢 😢 😢 I now have to live with this hole in my heart ❤️ and now I’m more knowledgeable and stronger and if I knew what I know now my relationship with mom would have been a lot better.
Business is Business,people be in their feelings. But hopefully in the future they can work together.
The Scott’s would benefit greatly from therapy (Iyanla Vanzant quit too soon)….Also, I really enjoy Taj’s “Love n Light” energy ✨
Not the 3 mics in the background of Kandi Speak On It 😂😂😂😂😂 Kandi, you produce enough facts for me to automatically believe you. Speak the truth and shame the 👹🎉
I had to watch this twice….Kandi, you are amazing ❤
Freedom from her husband 😂😂
Tocha is a dangerous woman with a lying spirit in her. I will NEVER support her gospel career because she lacks integrity and truth. Gospel must be a safety net for her because ain’t nothing else is happening. Shoutout to Kandi for breaking everything down because now everything makes sense
Kandi drop that single soon that you’ve been previewing on these Speak on It’s  please 🙏🏾
Now that you explained the business part it makes sense
Shoutout to Kandi for giving Kempire some shine. I would love to see Kempire interview Xscape 3 💯
It’s crazy to me how they say kandi isn’t a fashion girl l, but she look TF good every time she on  camera
Tocha gospel song was alil bop tho 💃🏾
"Only for you " is hot Kandi.... release it please 💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think you deserved to get ate up on Twitter 😂 a special guest on one date vs an opening act for a tour is two different things. I think regardless of the receipts SWV is a legendary and iconic group. I know its just business but yall could barely get it together and wanted to talk about headlining. The math wasn't mathing. But I do enjoy the speak on it even though I don't agree lol
Kandi you Tiny should not mess up things with SWV. Yes you have a base on Bravo because of Atlanta House Wives. And Tiny with her little show. I did not like how Tiny shades SWV. They do no more than you and Tiny.
Yall can alternate dates...joint headliners yall alternate sets, do 5 they do 5 one night yall close another night yall close
The great Xscape Tour was an XSCAPE TOUR where other artists were featured in different cities. THIS IS NOT THAT! This was not an Xscape Tour, so all the past shows are irrelevant. Y'all were WRONG Kandi, accept it, and leave it alone.  Go get your Xscape money on your own, and they will do the same. The point was to come together 1 show for everyone to get a bigger check *together*  SWV is booked and busy they didn't need that show it was just another business opportunity of which they have many.
I'm glad she broke down the reason for even suggesting Xscape open because clearly SWV should NOT be opening in this situation.  Absolutely no disrespect but if you grew up in the 90's, you know who the top bill is.  Now, if SWV's manager signed them up to open in the past, they need to fire that manager because he/she doesn't know who he is managing.
I absolutely agree this episode with Tamika her mom it was well needed and  the fact that she could stand up to her mom be able to speak her piece that was a occurred and I'll tell you I think God for the 90s but the 90s was a hard area because when you was raised by older people you were supposed to be seen not heard and now  in society things have changed that we can confront the issue in address the issue without being disrespectful and the older people still feel as you being disrespectful and so I'll salute her because I was crying as well because I go through this is well with my own mom and sister and to the point that I haven't seen them in like 7 years and because of this I hope things will take the term for the best for their relationship because everybody needs their parents in their life's
YEAH TOCHA IS TOO CONFRONTATIONAL FOR ME. SHE USES WAY TOO MUCH OF PEOPLE'S ENERGY AND TIME. XSCAPE HAS A LOT OF PATIENCE. I WOULD HAVE EXPLODED. I COULDN'T BE CRADLING A GROWN WOMAN. EITHER YOU'RE IN OR OUT.
Truthfully speaking you guys don't need her.let her go do her thing.when you don't have a good heart things never work out for you so let her go.
Tocha will sabotage herself and her money to spite the group! Grow up you are to old for the nonsense!
You are definitely a Boss. I love how you always come with the facts and receipts
You were crying because your momma do you the same way
What’s up with kandi hands
So kandie y not go back touring with jus xscape an BBD ONLY. Cause y'all been more gracious 2 swv numerous times.. An yet swv have never included xscape n their Affairs wit swv putting$ n y'all pockets
I agree 100% with Kandi you need to establish early what the business is supposed be in plain language.. just like a relationship.. what are we doing... do we go together or not😏...😁.. that's how I get down...
If "make it make sense" was a person 🤣
Kandi's speak on it are the best
Jamie cracked me up with “so what type of freedom is she talking about “ 💀😂
Oh yeah so proud of Tamika for getting her piece out to her mother 🎉 bc I know it prob wasn't easy for her to get her voice heard esp wit her sitting there in front of her but so proud of her & her mother for actually hearing her out & apologizing from the heart❤
I’m sooooo glad Kandi set the record straight on this SWV thing! They (Coko specifically) were getting on my LAST nerve last night with all that nonsense.
She was looking forward to it she just had to pray on it first
So I had the pleasure 5yrs ago to go see the ladies of Xscape in Richmond VA & let me tell u all 4 mics were ON & they did this thing where each lady got to perform some of their solo music & Kandi def has pipes & if u don't believe me check out her season of The Masked Singer 👀 but I do think a co-headline situation would've been dope tho too 🤷🏾‍♂️
KANDI MY BABY HOWEVER SHE'S ACTING LIKE MOMA JOYCE #MEANGIRL KANDI BLOW UP YOUR EGO ASAP. SWV MADE YALL LOOK LIKE BEAVIS & BUTHEAD IN THE VERSUS BATTLE YALL SHOULDA STAYED HOME 🏡 ALSO IF ANYTHING SWV SHOULD GET PAID 💰 MORE THEY GOT ALL THE HITS. BECAUSE YOU & TINY ON REALITY TV 📺 SO WHAT SWV HAS BEEN ON REALITY TV 📺 TOO SO MISS ME WITH THAT SWV SHOULD GET PAID MORE BECAUSE THEY GOT ALL THE BANGERS XSCAPE GOT ALL THE SLANGERS #THROWAWAYMUSIC NO SHADE FACTS.😎😎😎😎
Kandi’s new name is The Accountant because she has the receipts 😂
Bring the receipts Kandi!!! 😂😂😂😂
Not very sisterly and definitely opportunitist. This is about popularity based on music and sales & stats not followers on social media. People are not coming to watch Kandi and Tiny to walk around their homes talking. They are coming for a concert. SWV sold more, are streamed more so if anything they should headline Xscape.
Honestly I feel like since this is a collaboration it’s should be presented as that ……and the money should be divided accordingly…..no one has to know what you are getting paid and it will garner more success for both groups queens of rnb tour featuring xscape and swv …..support your black sisters Kandi I think your being unfair in this instance
ALWAYS LOVE WHEN KANDI SPEAK ON IT. BUT..............WHEN YA'LL PLAYED PART OF A SONG FROM, EACH GROUP (SWV, BBD, XSCAPE) THAT WAS ACTUALLY A NEW EDITION SONG. NOT BBD
I thought the episode comes out on Monday….today! Gotta go haven’t seen this last episode 😂
Kandi I love you and there is no ex scape without you voice it is the sound of the blend of ex scape I always knew you could sing but after watching you on the masked singer I can tell you voice is amazing and has many layers to it ❤
Honeyyyyy! Kandi never fails to deliver on Speak On It!! She keeps it real, breaks it alllll down, yet stays relatable and down to earth. Kudos! 👌🏾And her powerful team is always on point as well!👏🏽👏🏽 #blackexcellence
Kandi, I love ya! But your explanation still didn’t suffice it for me. It’s only one dang show. Y’all could have co-headlined.
Kandi give us the tea on this Tamar beef! Speak on iiiiitt! Apparently She claiming you tried to fight her.
As I was watching this video, I kept thinking "The people that don't understand business will be pissed." Kandi has proven that she has a mind for business and can take emotions and feelings off the table. It's how Kandi breaks things down for clarity that makes me a fan. As for the LaTocha situation, as someone who saw all of this unfold back in the day, I just see it as history repeating itself. Nothing but love for both groups.
I’m driving and was like is that Kemp’s voice? Lol.
I was here for Xscape having top billing before  Kandi gave the logistics of  why she said what she said. I also thought that Tiny's explanation was also plainly put and made me be like she has a point. Nonetheless, I would love to see an Xscape & SWV show. So I hope that something can be worked out.
Love your show.
GIVE KANDI OUR FLOWERS!!! Yall always claim yall want real yet KANDI has always been real AF and yall hate and it lets me know that yall really hate her because YOU ARE JEALOUS of her self made success. She is the epitome of self made and yall cant take it. GIVE HER FLOWERS, RESPECT HER NAME and apologize for all the ISH yall talk; especially my queer peeps; NOTHING FUNNY OR CUTE attacking a beautiufl blk woman about her personal style or bedroom politics. Her voice is unique and THAT IS ENOUGH accompanied by her talent and innovative spirit to KEEP HER AT THE TOP
And BOOM! JUST LIKE THAT, MY FELLOW TAURUS HAS SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT!!! I BELIEVE EVERY SINGLE WORD! KANDI HAS NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO BE A LIAR ❤
I’m a big swv fan but I’m 100% agree with kandi after that break down
Latocha is on that Rocky juice she's his money bag lol....
Yassss Kempireeee
Tbh I’d go see Xscape before I go see Swv ijs
I love LOVE both groups and felt that if u all wasnt gonna CO-headline then outta respect felt that since SWV come out first & standing on what Coko said they sold more then SWV should have headlined.   BUT after Kandi breakdown and making it make sense BUSINESS WISE, i hear Kandi and NOW understand and agree with Kandi's stance.  And she made a point of setting the tone and communicating UPFRONT of where she stood, hint hint LATOCHA that is how u do business and set expectations, there is no chance of a misunderstanding bc u know where she stands. And n e 1 can respect that even if u dont agree.  Respect Kandi or not when it comes to business and her bag SHE GONNA SPEAK ON IT AND NOT PLAY ABOUT IT as we all would.  Thats why we ride for Kandi she gonna speak on it and set the record str8. So i stand corrected in n e comment i made that said SWV SHOULD headline if they werent going to CO headline.
You didn’t do Kim like that I wonder why
Yes Kandi!! Thanks for bringing back the old intro
Kandi always make it make sense, that's why she is a boss❤🎉🎉🎉
Ok that is find but they are just as relevant as you guys are that month of your all way open again women with power what about went you did and what you said I knew it was about the money and what you and your husband do to Tamar speak on that
I occasionally side eye but I always hear what Kandi has to say and it usually makes sense. Real talk, I’ve never known her to come from a malicious place🤷🏾‍♀️
I still think it should be a co-headlining tour 🤷🏽‍♀️ I understand what Kandi is saying, but for this tour they should definitely be co-headlining imo.
KANDI! WAS SO MESSY AF FOR BRING UP THAT WOMAN'S ASS AGAIN 🤣
THanks for clearing it all up. Because I was like Kandi noooo! Thanks for the receipts  Kandi! ❤
KANDI GOT A BIG EGO SWV IS WAY BETTER & WAY MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN XSCAPE. I DON'T CARE ABOUT KANDI & TINY BEING REALITY TV 📺 STARS ⭐🌟 HOWEVER YALL WANT MORE MONEY 💰 THAN SWV PLUS YALL DON'T WANNA CO-HEADLINE. THE MONEY 💰 SHOULD BE SPLIT EVEN & BOTH GROUPS SHOULD CO-HEADLINE KANDI HAVE YOU STARTED DRINKING 🍸 BECAUSE YOU SOUND GREEDY & CRAZY.🤪
Kandi sounds delusional as it pertains to this Headlining issue.    XSCAPE has went from a 4 sum to a 3 sum, and might go to a 2 sum depending on if Tameka goes back to supporting her sister. To be honest, iMO,  Xscspe as a group is not stable because of the drama and infighting.  SWV  on the other hand, shows up as WHOLE group, do they're job, sings, entertain, and move around without the drama.   To suggest that you and Tiny's  Social media followers and  TV drama will equate to  real life tickets sales is delusional.  BECAUSE to be quite honest we're not paying to see TINY AND  KANDI. WE'RE Paying to see the WHOLE group.   Kandi nor Tiny couldn't sell out a concert alone despite having Millions of followers. Ijs.   Co headlining is definitely the way to go.. anything else is uncivilized.
You're about to get their manager fired with this video because I bet they thought they headlined those tours because they sang first. 😂 Also, I bet if Rocky were yall's manager, SWV would get 50%, Tocha would get 50%, and the Pips would just be performing for free. Lol!
But in fairness, SWV invited Xscape to do the Ladies of R&B Legacy Tour, so if they are hosting the project they should have headlined that project.
Won the mask congratulations
Kandi was the only person talking so it looked bad. The other girls should’ve said something during the meeting.
Kandi what I have always liked about you is that you tell your truth but never hit below the belt Kandi you always bring the receipts too lol
Kandi imma you do you research … check at the link below, SWV is sitting at no. 15 for the top 20 for the best selling girls group of all time …. Xscape na-da, not on the list boo  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_girl_groups
Two reasons why I stop watching RHOA was because of Kandi's Mother and Nene
The show is not a shock to me. You could see that she was separating herself @ the soul train awards. That dress was a big statement.  You can also tell the non relationship that she & you have. I am a singer, I have been in groups, apart of bands and in choirs and that DIVA spirit works very hard to divide & cost conflicts
Numbers dont lie, but fans don't lie either. And didnt swv sell more records?👀🤔 They are also more crossover, commercial, and still tour despite their group discrepancies. SWV didnt sign up to be told "ya'll cant sit with us" given the fact that ya'll wanted SWV to join this show for that PURPOSE. It came off tasteless.
So on point Kandi she is her own enemy and so is messy Rocky.🤨😒  I screamed when his sneaky ass said, he didn't know his wife didn't inform Xscape about this move. I was like lost because I know Kandi and Tiny are getting money doing multiple project, jobs, and businesses. Girl Stop playing games and be truthful. I'm a fan of both groups. So please work it out!
Tosha is full of full in the blank.
Kandi when that screen turns red I be weak... your expressions have me cryin 😂😂😂
That was your tour so of course someone would open for you . But that wasn’t a tour show it was supposed to be a one night show so why not co headline ??
Tamika and her mom got me in tears. But I was so proud of tamika tho
I love Kandi real boss moves and very transparent.
Why not just split it? One half Xscape go last and second half SWV go last. People want to see both.
Kandi firstly you can't sing like Beyonce, Adele, Tamar, Celine Dion, Jennifer Hudson, girl your voice is horrible by the way. Tosha is the reason why the group was successful. Devante song lead on all jodeci albums but we all know that Kc and Jojo were the best singers like Tosha and Tamika. Swv has sold over 30 million and Xscape only sold 7 million. Tiny should shutup about reality show fame. Lest be clear only legendary reality stars are the Osborne's, the Kardashians, paris and nicole, Nene leakes and snookie from Jersey show the rest of yall are fillers. Your restaurants has horrible reviews and you dont pay your employees Jack. How dare you talk about anyone mama when mama Joyce has acted a fool from day one. Kandi your evil and not cute and that's a horrible combination. Stay loosing and going around in circles with your failing in grades resturants
We love you KANDI ❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Kandi, I here you sis you guys head lined your tour the Great XScape tour which is right!  But this is not your own tour! in my opinion people want to see them just as much as they want to see your group!   You said that they over saturated them selves because they did 50 shows, no shade you guys would have done the same thing if it hadn’t been so much drama in your group, so I don’t think that was fair to say!   This tour in my opinion should have been Co headlined, because both groups are trending right now!   With the platform that both groups have right now its giving them just as much exposure as it’s giving you guys in my humble opinion!   you also said that SWV’s fee was way less then your groups booking fee, with that being said your a business woman and you should have told them (off camera) that they have a little bit more leverage now because their popularity has went up and they should be in a better position to renegotiate their fee!   I love both groups and I wish you guys would come together for a magical collaboration for the world to enjoy! have a great day!
Tosha would be no longer a part of the group, and the mama and Rock are too involved in the business, and their mama is too harsh.
I agree with Kandi with the business bc it makes sense but w/o all four members it’s not the same. Even through Tasha has a sour taste in our mouths right now she plays a huge part in the group
KANDI GO MAKE MONEEEEYYYYYYYY
It sounds like her mom felt she was entitled to the money Tocha stole too… thats why they trying to sweep it under the rug… Their mom is toxic and needs therapy…
I totally understand what Kandi is saying! Put personal feelings aside and recognize it’s business at the end of the day! 💯💯
The moral of the story is just because you sold more records in the 90s doesn't mean you will sell more tickets to shows these days 😂
They gone think you got Kempire on the payroll 😂
It's for you aye aye aye... only for you aye aye aye...
Kandi I need you to do one of these live with Tamika so we can "live chat"
Love kandi so sweet been a rider since day one so proud of her accomplishments with and without her group
I love ya but sorry weak and human nature kills y’all whole thang no swv is different
Kandi really isn’t wrong. SWV opens at shows all the time. I remember going to a concert a few years back and they were performing while people were still making their way into the venue.   Kandi is just telling the truth. I mean SWV is a great group but they have over saturated the market. They’re at every summer concert series. That is not a lie.   I love both groups but Kandi ain’t wrong when she right. She’s also extremely competitive so she isn’t going to allow someone to win if they aren’t backing it up with receipts. Coko said something about album sales but Kandi is right! How many tickets can you sell today?   Love the show and all of the talented women on it. Latocha is draining. We tired! 🗣️
I'm a little confused by her receipt.  It was Xscape's show right? SWV agreed to be a special guest. This go round they want a show to be a joint effort, so to me being co headliners would make sense.
I completely understand Kandi from a business side
The way Kandi explained the headlining  debacle now makes more sense to me.
Love all the girls together however if one is unhappy and is causing others to be the same let her leave. And while y'all doing the shows as three all of you should be doing solo projects. Since all of you have voices of your own prove it by doing your own thing until you all can be better together. It's so easy to let the cards fall where they may.
Ok Kandi 👍
I hear what kandi is saying but I think what SWV is saying, is one night it needs to be co headline kandi be putting 20 on ten when she clearly heard them all say for THIS NIGHT we need to Co headline.
Kandi please speak on what Tamar said on WWHL last night
Some much respect to Kandi for honestly breaking things down. She also stayed positive and gave people their props and accolades. Way to handle the drama. We get it now!
And about that dress 😭😂
Great commentary Kandi.
Thanks for the subscribe reminder, cause I just knew I was already subscribed 😂
Tocha wants freedom from Kandi. 😂😂😂 She was fine to use Kandi's newfound (RHOA) fame to revive the group and now that she thinks she's on again, she wants to ditch the group. She wants freedom to use the group when it's convenient for her and to ditch it whenever she wants to.
I did not like that your group did not speak up in your defense.
Hi,this is why I love you😅 you keep it real and speak fairness.
Tocha’s mama is fake 😢and it’s sad
The scene with Coko and her son broke my heart. I felt it so deeply!
I hope SWV  does not bend, XSCAPE  has too much bad energy
Did this show happen?
Honestly I don’t even think tocha wanted to do the show. I think she don’t like reality shows with drama lol. I think she just over it. Her solo project is actually great. I love that song. Her vocals are amazing. It’s a rap version with a little r&b lol. I think her and her sister will be fine once the cameras off and everybody stop inserting themselves and giving opinions.
Kandi, thank you for explaining the business part of what happen with the headlining situation.  If I may, what if SWV want to step out from being an opening act and what if they want to take this opportunity to raise their fee, as sisters (not business wise) maybe doing a show as a coheadliner won't hurt the brand or bill of Xscape at all and will benefit SWV. Hopefully that makes sense what I'm saying. Just try to understand that as legends in their own right, maybe it's not good to air out who can sell tickets more because it just sounds like a dig. Again I completely understand where you coming from, I'm just trying to provide a different perspective
Kandi is too damn funny 🤣
But wasn't  that XSCAPE tour? When it's your tour you have opening acts, because bbd would not have gone before  them either, so that's different
Look y’all can say what you wanna, Kandi knows BUSINESS, she’s making perfect sense about the ticket sales.
Speak on ittttt!!! That episode was super emotional.  I'm glad that Tamika made up with her mom. Her mom is so strong. Ok...now Tacha, why can't she multitask and make 2 bags instead of bringing misery and stress to the group???? Now Kandi, your one of my favorites it's just towards the end you said we gone be the headliner...and I said I thought they both would do it together,  however,  when it comes to business you can't play, as stated in the video you have to say it at the beginning so there won't be any confusion.  Business is straight to the point and people can't involve their feelings and that's 100! I get it!! One thing I wish we would do as a people is to work together and have one another's back. For centuries in our culture people betray one another...but that has to change. Overall...I love this show. It's really good. I wish it was a 2 hr episodes but I know shows cost and there's a budget. Alright. Speeeak on it. Ohhh Kandi,  I love how you have receipts for everything.  You don't play. They not about to make you look crazy on national TV. Lol
It’s the voices for me 😂
I LIIIIIIIVE for these! I can NOT WAIT until you bring the ladies on 😂😂
I still Don’t agree y’all should co headline anyway bc of the show forget what happened before
Where they do that at....And the look was funny as fuck😂😂😂😂 Kandi been in this game to long to be played with
Not the coin dropping noise 😂😂
I like all four women. I believe God has blessed them all with their voices and all are unique in their own way. Stay blessed all women and keep making papers.❤❤❤❤
speak on it Kandi!!! when it comes to business and the bag, they really can't come for Kandi.
Kandi be pulling out them receipts LMAO, aht aht , I got proof right here
I agree Tocha is her own  enemy.   She should be looking for freedom from that husband of hers.  AND I’M STILL NOT BUYING NOTHING!
Honestly , we wouldn’t be watching a swv reality show in this day , them being xscape is a plus on this show !!
Thank you for clarifying everything Kandi, makes perfect sense. I totally agree, it’s business…it isn’t personal. I also respect Kandi as a businesswoman for always advocating for herself, regardless of what others may think.   “Closed mouths don’t get fed”, quite literally. I’m almost certain that the reason why Xscape have been able to garner their fee is because of Kandi. Kandi has been doing business and negotiating her salary, etc. for several years. The other members of Xscape (aside from Tiny) had not been active in the public eye for years. They should all be grateful for Kandi’s contributions to the group. She has made sure that the group gets their just due on the business side! I respect it! It ain’t personal, IT’S BUSINESS! Get that bag!💰  As for SWV, i’m not sure what their fee is, but it sounds like they should renegotiate it. They are a “legacy act” as well, and should be treated as such!  They have been consistently active in recent years. The reality show should also help them up their fee. Being on a successful television show gives them more leverage.   I also agree with what Kandi said about oversaturating the market. It is imperative in business that you do not make yourself too accessible. Maybe do fewer shows and ask for more money. As opposed to the Chitlin Circuit approach 🤷🏽‍♂️. I understand doing that initially when they first came back out on the scene (when they were testing the market) but now it’s been several years. PRICE GOING 🆙📈
Kandi, I don't know if you or your staff read the comments but can you get with Bravo to make a show for Joyce, Bertha and Nora. I miss them on TV. They are real, raw and hilarious.!
I was shocked how much I love this show. Like I knew I'd like it but it's such a HIT omg! Love love love it and the speak on it too! omg! ICONIC!
Yes but that’s not the way it was presented to them. If I’m collaborating with you then why would I open up for you?
Kandi, Why is Tasha using Escape, platform to announce, she is going gospel solo? She is not God worthy, she shady & can't be trusted. I am happy, Escape is doing fine without Tasha, it's about the fans & their bags, ain't nobody got time for Tasha Diva attitude!!!
The Mother is not sorry. She did that for those same cameras she was cursing out on episode one.
Tamika’s mother is ignorant
Kandi is the Most real , raw and loveable housewife ever!!
is it normal that I don't watch the show but still watch speak on it?
Well then you shouldn’t do a tour with them if you feel that way! It’s not a collaborate tour.
Yesss break it down for the people in the back. Love xscape hope y’all get it together.
They opened up for you because it was your tour!!
I can’t wait until rocky gets caught up !
Kandi you is WRONG WRONG AND WRONG 😑🤌🏼   With all what you said why not just do your own tour again? instead of asking them to do something "together" when you feel as if your above them.
Dear Person That's Reading This You May Be Goin Through Something But God Got U He Didn’t Bring You This Far To Quit.We Don’t Know Each Other But I Wish U All The Best In Life 2023 And Beyond.🇧🇸❤️
Let me just say I could never be mad at Kandi for standing up for her group!!! She has Always been made out to be the promiscuous mean money hungry villain 🙄 ppl been hating on my girl since the beginning!!!! She still handles it with dignity!!!! She gone take all yall hate to the Bank!!!😜💅
i swear tocha just want the exposure from the group and the show so she can launch her sad solo career. girl give it a rest genz wont be buying. this ship has long saild
Stop being greedy kandi ... Damn
Keep showing those receipts girl!
@kempire
That 2nd and 3rd album of SWV went gold that's it that's all
Kandi you are the best & always! 💎💯❤🔥👑
Tocha seems to exaggerate her importance's to the group. She needs to get out of her head all the nonsense she keeps bringing up! Out of concerns for the safety of the groups someone needs to legally bar that THUG ASS HUSBAND from being around while you all are practicing and on stage. if not you all need to hire extract security for each woman.
Kandi y’all can’t make it past a meeting but shading a group who can tour all over the world?
Do Latocha suffer from mental illness?  Because she seems weird and strange, her face gives off evil/mad all the time, her emotions seems more down than up. Latocha husband is childish and the fact that he stated a line from Ike Turner and called her Anna Mae is eye opening, because no telling what Latocha husband might be doing to her or putting her through, he’s clearly controlling her
BAD MOVE...  this episode
Truthfully Xscape has more bangers than SWV. So Xscape should headline. Is just my opinion
❤❤🎉🎉 😂😂 All facts! Love you Kandi ❤❤
Always been team Kandi even when she was having that back and fourth with Porcha on RHOA and everybody was team Porcha. I always stood for Kandi
I'm not streaming not one of her songs!!
Kandi when you have all the ladies on, can LeLee please be your guest bcuz she is thee most appreciative for her new found opportunities that SWV & the show has offered her? Not only that, new artists NEED to hear her struggles bcuz everything ain't glitter & gold in the industry. Next, make sure Coko brings Jay bcuz they're plum damn fools when they're together. The rest of the ladies can come on in no particular order, BUT Tamika has close it out bcuz the fans will be anticipating her arrival & hopefully we'll have an update on The Scott's relationships by then.  Thanx💋
What's crazy is if we go back to the beginning stages of yalls group most fan thought Kandi was the lead singer the whole time so we didn't understand how the Scott sister thght she was the lead singer
Kandi ALWAYS makes it make sense.  It’s BUSINESS, and the precedence has been set.
What is that song at the end Kandi???🔥🔥🔥🔥🎶💃🏾 That song, I need it on rotation! Absolutely love your platform and you are always a favorite for me although love ALL of Xscape!!!
Kandi going get all of her coins 😂😂😂
I appreciate the clarification about headlining. I wish this had been a conversation off camera;  for the fans it was difficult to watch. Now there is context. The touching moments in this episode represent reality TV at its best. ❤
Kandi is speakinggggg factssssss SWV stay mad
I would go see Xscape over SWV any dayyyyy period
Kandi, SWV *was* talking about a one time performance. Remember, Taj even said the tour headlining details could be worked out later, but for the upcoming ONE performance, a month away, both groups should co-headline. It seems like SWV takes one thing at a time, and you're used to doing 10 things at once, LOL. You have a *great* head for business, but I think you were 5 steps ahead in your mind and put the cart before the horse.   And, as far as Ms. Riley goes, working for a few years before going to law school would be of great benefit for her. I say this as someone who went to law school. I was 29 when I went (I'm 52 now), and one thing all of the "seasoned" law students agreed on was that the kids fresh out of college didn't know Jack Schitt. They had absolutely zero concept about what the real world was like, and never had to struggle but had staunch opinions about subjects they knew nothing about.   If Riley wants to be an entertainment lawyer and work in the music industry, a Music Business degree is fine. There is no specific major that prepares anyone for law school (and there is no major called Pre-Law). She just needs to make sure she can critically and logically think and that she can write well. Everything else she needs to know they'll teach her in law school. She also needs to be prepared for the workload. The first year, especially, is like trying to drink water from a full-on fire hose.  Before anyone asks, no I didn't finish law school. I dropped out because I developed Lupus.
Kandi congratulations luv 🥂💐
I love it…Kandi is about business…and the receipts 🧾 is receipting…they love to make Kandi the villain and I’m so glad she’s speaking on it 😂 and CLEARING her name
Look idc at all about who gets paid more get it the freak together women and give us a show 🤬
💚🖤
What is that lump on Kandi's neck❓Hope everything is ok.
yall use the same background actor for the scene with sheree and pheadra in her office, and the one with you that you “fire” a staff guy for talking shit about you..
Hi Kandi. We love y'all, but I didn't think it was a good idea to discuss headlining the show. We want to see BOTH groups equally. It doesn't matter that you feel Xscape has more fans due to reality tv. It was tacky and I actually don't blame Coco for her reaction. Like... Oh HAAAYO naw! Ikyfl
If neither of them  wants to open for eachother, they should have another artist come and open for them. Someone like faith evans. And I’m only saying faith because that’s the only person that’ it’s it all about the money for. And she’ll do it just off the bat if the money straight
Another great episode. Kandi can you speak on the Tamar situation? Or you don’t want to give it light? Thank you
wow, this one is extremely disrespectful to SWV 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Who edits these videos cause pleaseee of you had an a** to kiss 🤣💀
I love love love both groups. Xscape & SWV. However, I will be buying my tickets because of Xscape. I totally understand what Kandi is saying about the headlining situation. Loving the song on the outro as well. ❤❤🎉🎉
This was an education ❤ I love the details behind the drama.
Kandi when you tell the truth you will never have to REMEMBER what you said ………speak on it👍🏾
I ❤️ SWV and Xscape. They are both legendary groups with classic hits. I hope they can someday agree on business and give the fans a joint tour. I have my fingers crossed.
What's the issue with co-headlining for *one night?*
How did KANDI MAKE THIS SHOW HERS ; and then turn it into a YT check ..sis you are very influential ❤❤
Appreciate the explanation for Xscape wanting top billing on the show/tour. Just wondering, couldn't the show/tour co-headline in title/name only and have different fee  structures for each group?
Kandi, why don't Xscape have their own TV show. Sounds like you guys needed SWV to get this show on tv
Sooo I just wanna say 🤔💭 I Love This Show💯💃🏽
That’s right Kandi spoke 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️ on it!! Business can be and sometimes be uneasy. However, it’s a necessary evil to advocate for your business. Forget who doesn’t know and ignorantly says things without understanding it!!!
this was good Kandi, first time watching
I'm glad you explained it because it came off a certain way but you brought the receipts! 💛
Kandi is a hell of a businesswoman and I love her for that. If I was the fourth member of Xscape , chile I’ll be trying to get every badg out of our performances that I could. If I was a record executive or in the music industry at all, I wouldn’t want to work with  Tosha or Rocky. He just seems like he’s full of shit and a problem starter.!!!🙅🏽‍♀️
It's 2023 why is she still trying to get a record deal? Can't she do it without a label? 🤔
She lacks class not  talent.
I have to say SWV has sold 25 million worldwide, yes the majority where the first album but the 2nd was very successful and the 3rd Gold in the US I do agree xscape is more relevant today but I don't think sharing top billing is beneath you all. I think maybe help SWV up there game as far as show quality and how to get on that level because honestly I can see you and Tiny writing songs for them and possibly joint original music that help you guys both have new hits.
Tocha really seems like the problem child oh goodness. I get the business thing/why XSCAPE should make more money, but I don't blame SWV at all for insisting on the co-headline. Just because they opened for an XSCAPE tour, that doesn't mean they're gonna want to be openers here! Especially if they're sort of co-headlining the BRAVO show, it would look a little funny for them to be openers for this specific performance, no? But the point about the current followings of Kandi/Tiny uplifting XSCAPE & especially SWV "over-saturating" the market with performances makes a bunch of sense
40:32 Chiiiiiiile! I thought they were gonna surprise her with a cake. Lol That was crazy.
We still love you, Kandi. I don’t believe the majority of viewers and fans were upset at you for setting the business expectations up front. I think we just felt you all should’ve been co-headlining. And it also appeared to be about just the one show.
I thought you flew above the drama…why spend so much time talking about this lady…I didn’t even finish the video because it’s giving ugly vibes.
At 40:37 I have PTSD too Kandi. 😅
Something's are not worth speaking on just co-headline for Peace sake
And this is why candy with a K is successful. Period she does more than just sing she has her hands in every facet of the music industry. Kandi has the purse and it’s going to change ❤❤❤
Rocky is one shady dude I don’t know how he managed to escape his role w/ Robert Kelly.  I expect what we see on TV a no talented opportunist.
Bingeworthy and Kempire are two of my faves.
Don Juan guy actually annoys me and boils my blood with his extra saucy self.... your talking about a time when in 2017 yall came back, so you were getting money off of that hype. NOW Fast forward to 2023 yall on the same boat as SWV
TBH I can’t blame Kandi for explaining the Music Business 101. But basically y’all just came up with the wrong idea. Y’all could have just did a reality show about going overseas having hot girl summer. You can’t expect someone willing to do a joint tour with the earnings aren’t equal. If the promoters can’t afford both groups equally, maybe it’s a idea y’all have to abolish!
Girllllllll you know SWV is banging, I think your ego got the best of you and that wasn't right
As clear and concise that Kandi was, there are still people in these YouTube street’s that still try to blame Kandi for others circumstances.  Some people are really not interested in the truth.
if it’s a joint tour though you can have more than one headline act, just like a festival, have an actual opening act then whoever goes first goes first but you get paid the same?😂
Love you 🫂
Kandi ain’t bringing nothing but the facts and receipt!
Swv  open for Salt N Pepa, they should know their place
I love y’all… ♥️🎉♾️
Love you Kandi! ❤️
I agree with everything your saying 100 percent !
SWV has sold more records but Xscape is more popular TODAY because of Kandi and Tiny, hence why they headline tours. I feel like all of Xscape's beef and drama in the media are a factor as well. You know, bad publicity is good publicity.
Why they trying to take my Kandi out. She talking about close your eyes......ugh noooooo...😅
We apologize Kandi!!
Kandi I love it Rocky arrogant ass finally on TV showing the entire world 🌎 how jealous he is of his wife I've always listened to the music I can tell when you sang Xscape has always been better together please come to Seattle Washington stay shining like a diamond 💎
Tamika: 😭😭Toscha STOLE MY MONEY!! Mum: 😐* insert cricket sounds * Toscha: 😭😭Tamika called me flat back!! Mum: 😱🤯😤🤬TAMIKA YOU DEAD WRONG & EVIL.  - this week  Mum: * semi confesses to being the thief via * 🥺🤚😩I WAS THE 5th MEMBER OF YALLS GROUP!! 😤  Me: 🤦🏾‍♀️🧐🤔🤚where did WE go wrong with Coko son though smh poor Coko going home to a Cheshire Cat smile of a devil of a son 😪🤚but then I recall Ephesians 6:12 for we wrestle not against flesh & blood, but against… 🤦🏾‍♀️Smh maybe she smh 🤷🏾‍♀️Ephesians 6.12😩then; I agree that SWV was the ONE back in the day with xscape being 🙄not quite me & I didn’t buy into them tbh. Plus their current reality tv fan base is collectively and NOT Solo eg RHOA 🤔🧐🤷🏾‍♀️as I personally don’t watch much of Tinys stuff 🤷🏾‍♀️so their legacy of me adoring them is still the same as when I was a teen - not much. Tho YES 🙌🏾 No Scrubs was a CLASSIC.  🤭Speak on it; thanks 🙌🏾🙏🏾👋🏾🇬🇧
It be the "Touching" music for me, lol. I STILL don't like their mom.
How you spend 20 min talking about ONE person. It’s was giving too much for me.
Kandi speaks facts and back it up with receipts. That's why they emotional.
Proud of Lee Lee ❤ for real
I try to tel ppl that Kandi was the lead singer on the first 2 albums . So you can’t say she cannot sing but like Xscape . Kandi sang all over the first 2 albums
Hate me if you want, but I agree with Kandi if its more than one show, Xscape should be the headliner. Ms. Gloria and Tocha should be extremely embarrassed by their behavior after watching themselves on these episodes.Tocha nobody checking for your solo album, sorry, but it's the truth. You see Coko went back to her group after she went solo..... Speaking of Coko, she wasn't worng for telling her son to stay in school..... that lil sample  he gave kinda proved that school should be first. work on the vocals lil buddy, then try to get in the business
Latosha needs to pay Tamika her 30,000 DOLLARS 😊
And this is why I Love Kandi! Business over Everything else! The receipts don’t lie! Much Respect for advocating for what’s right.
Kandi have me weak with these voices...😂😂😂
Kandi is 100% RIGHT about what she's saying, SWV IS NOT MORE RELEVANT THAN THEM IN THE PRESENT & THEY SHOULDN'T BE BOWING DOWN & LOWERING THEIR PAY STANDARS TO APPEASE FOLKS GARGANTUAN EGOS. Secondly, SWVs live show doesn't hold a FLAME to Xscapes show production standard. They barely move & wear some of thee most ugly, hideous, grandma outfits I've ever seen, while Xscape puts on an entire EXPERIENCE. Kandi is AN AWESOME BUSINESS WOMAN, SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT & SHE HAS THE RECEIPTS TO PROVE IT & I'm a fan on BOTH GROUPS, but it'd be totally dishonest not to acknowledge & admit that in the PRESENT day, XSCAPE IS WAAAAAAYYYYYY MORE RELEVANT & THAT'S JUST A FACT JACK☝🏾🤨‼️
Latosha is under a EVIL SPELL 😈 from her husband the Puppet Master 🤣 🙄 😆 😂😂😂sorry not SORRY!
I’m loving the show. I can’t wait to see Xscape April 15 in Detroit. ❤❤❤❤
Latosha THOUGHT she was sticking the group SIKE😂😂😂
I love how Kandi explained the whole headlining situation, it definitely makes sense now.
One of the things I love about Kandi is how she educates you about business.  I too was wondering why they could not co-headline, but now I get it. She does not speak on it unless she can backup what she says with receipts. As for Tosha I feel like they thought this show was going to have a positive impact on selling her solo project, but to me I feel it has done the opposite. I don’t have any numbers to back that up, so I could be wrong.
Yeah this makes for good tv but shouldn't y'all have discussed the "headliner" 1st?!?! This is just   showing the world that black women really can't get along🤦🏾
Kandi love you ,but i feel like you are giving SWV backhanded compliments.Every time you say something nice its followed with a but. Or something semi negative.   Both groups are major .Also i think you’re comparing apples and oranges slightly . Its one thing for someone to open on XSCAPES tour, but its another thing to kinda still keep them in that “opening” level if you’re agreeing to doing SWV AND XSCAPE.
As far as Latocha goes, you never know what she is dealing behind closed doors.
It coulda been a scheme that Rocky set up to make Latocha the bad guy so we all talk about her !
I cried 😢when Tamika mother realized that she didn't want too lose her daughter when Tamika said that she's going to fall back😢😢
Kandi always about the money baby🤌🏾. I like that!
Nope they always co headline or opening act
Great episode Kandi!!! Can anyone tell me the name of the song that's playing at the end?
I am an not American, and we know Xscape since the 90s. But it is just a couple of years ago I haerd of SWV. SWV may have been successful in the US, but Xscape is successful in the US and worldwide
Kandi you came with the facts like you always do come on with it in Mrs.Burrus Tucker kandi is the Boss go ahead
I ❤kandi you have to respect the hustle
I love both groups and it is cocky and  that's fine because Xscape is Kandi's group and she supposed to feel a certain kind of way. Now I agree with what Tiny said because both of them were reintroduced to Xscape by way of reality shows which increased the fan base, but in all honesty, I have been to an SWV show not an Xscape one but I am happy to see both groups collaborating..If memory serves me correctly,  Kandi wasn't with the return to the group just doing some shows a few years back so let's keep it funky..
How  about doing  the tour without her ?
Why all the toxic people in gospel though.
It’s sad that SWV couldn’t handle the business conversation after being in the industry so long.
Oops Kandi gonna be calling @andy he shaded the fuck outta her tonight with the Braxtongirl
Kandi yesterday’s price ain’t todays price. Stop being greedy
You are so right Kandi.  Latocha can't get out of her own way, she is all over the place.
Kandi stay taking her to school 🏫 . I’m still team #SWV tho
Tochoa is unprofessional & deliberately trying to mess up everyone else finances she trifling heffers and needs to be out permanently
Tocha gave that check to her mother😢.
We are so sorry Kandi-girl😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 she played us good.
Candy you can do it I promise you can start on your new group Lily's girl don't waste no more time get started God and Jesus got you back girl candy I promise you start your new group any of your babies right there with you everywhere you go have your kids with you God ble
She needs freedom for her management 🤷🏾‍♀️
She was needing not to be in this group she told all lies than blamed everything on you all the while stealing money from all the group members as well as her sister's check sister or no the minute they said I had to pay taxes on 30.000 dollars she & her Rocky would have been in jail& required to pay the taxes not me period
NEW QUESTION: Will there be a REUNION? One group on stage; then the next group, then together.
@kempire!!!!
Yep I remember in the episode the man said 42 guaranteed shows is why you asked the question about top billing and headliner and everybody looking around like what  yall don't play Kandi 🙄🤷🏾‍♀️
It seems to me that all of the talk prior to this meeting was in reference to you guy’s performing together. Like being on stage at the same time. Is that not the case. I see what you are saying, but maybe they thought this would be a more lucrative deal for them to do a Joint one night performance.
When will the biopic be coming out that’s what we really want to see
So the apology wasn’t sincere and Kandi I’m guessing you don’t forgive I don’t know what’s going on one thing I can say I’m just happy I got a chance to see all 4 of you perform together and y’all don’t ever have to make another song together
She needs to be free of Rocky
Kandi I love it you always come correct know what's this ish Tamar talking about she came trying to ride for Carlos King when he was trying to do something on escape
Tamika made everyone think she was the victim. She was actually the perpetrator. This is karma or being exposed.
Now Kandi, we love you…..But I have to call bullshit😂 They sold 30 million and y’all sold 9 million. You tried to act like y’all was neck and neck😂😂 they were competing more with TLC. 🤷🏽‍♂️ Furthermore, it’s one of those things where nostalgia played into y’all’s favor. Y’all were in demand because, y’all had just reformed, it wasn’t because y’all were bigger. If the original members of Destiny Child formed, they would be WAY MORE in demand than Beyoncé by herself. I see what your saying, tho about maintaining profit. I’m just not finna bullshit with you. That’s all😂 l
Tasha would be better off focusing on Xscape and growing on the business front. But, sometimes people get stuck in an era that has passed them.
Headlining no.  Co headlining yes.  Girl bye.
Don't forget your towel back then everybody go see a black movie yes they were giving them White tickets other movies yeah watching tickets y'all that was a while back but still I'm just saying man
Tocha  wants to be solo and she wants to make xscape money SHE IS LITERALLY  THE DAVID RUFFIN  OF THE GROUP AND SHE SHOULD  NOT BE ALLOWED TO  TOUR OR MAKE MONEY  WITH YOU GUYS
“….bc she be lyinnnnn””” this took me out 😂
“Find sum freedom “ lol 😂
You did not hardly play SUV y'all should play that more than the men group
Not kempire and binge worthy making an appearance yaaaaaars
Kandi, you definitely can sing/sang! People are followers, and like you said people believe everything they hear.
I love Kandi
@kandi can you explain what top billing vs co headline mean for the people in the back.
Just finished episode 3 so it was only right that I make my way over here
OKAY , anybody else peep that BOP 🔥 we heard during the OUTRO ? #YesKANDI #TALENTED !
Love seeing @TheKempire on your latest video. 🐘🐘🐘🐘
Love your SpeakOnIt! #Kandi💯 Keep telling the truth Congratulations #Love💞
Ole girl is definitely missing out! Love me some Kandi ❤❤❤
Much ❤for LeeLee & Tamika Scott 🙏🏾
This is why I F with you, you have zero tolerance for BS lol Love You
Respect to Kandi. As a SWV fan primarily, I couldn’t argue ANY thing she said.
Other people that are about their business will never fault you for being about your business!!!!
That laugh❤❤❤❤ she's so adorable 🙏🙏🦾🦾♥️♥️
For me the episode aired as if the goal was to do 1 epic show and not a tour. Maybe editing... Neither group needs the other to tour so the headliner discussion is silly. No one cares about that gospel album lol. And Tamika has similar tones as Tocha so she isn't even needed for touring. Everyone needs to just have a seat lol. The show is 🔥.
@10:04 sends me to the moonnnnn “no we starting out with tocha” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂cause let’s get to it fr
No disrespect, but this would of been a great opportunity creatively for y’all to coheadline and be onstage back and forth, even sharing the stage at some point and featuring on each other’s songs.  This tour could of been about creating moments, you already did an Xscape tour.
I was at that OKC show. 1. It was everything 2. SWV definitely opened up and went on first. I was running a little late and almost missed their set.
i cried my eyes out at the scene of tamika and her mom. yall need yall own show
This is too much!  if she wanna go she can go, but the name stays home the name stays home!
SWV resonates more with fans. Gen Z and Gen X are more likely to know ‘Weak’ than any other songs amongst both sets of catalogs.
It’s people with no musical 🎤 talent or ability saying that she cannot sing. Obviously they don’t understand parts in music. Soprano, alto, tenor, bass/baritone
Go Ace
You would think that any and all of the girls would want to listen to Kandi and Tiny when it comes to money...their the only ones who really own their shit and not leasing..And Taj too cuz she married an NFL player...I was always taught to have money and keep money you have to be around like minded people...
Kandi u get way more love then here I love u more then anything everybody know I love xscape mainly because of u I swear u can’t do know wrong in my eyes Todd a lucky man
Make it make sense!
Okay okay🤓🤓🤓great explanation of the business part ..now I get it😊👍
I've seen Xscape perform without Tocha....and she completely not needed. You guys are great without her.
Baby Kandi AIRING IT ALL OUT & I love it ! 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 Hell, I would’ve long ago. #TheTruthShouldBeTold 🤷🏿‍♀️
We need a season 2 come on Kandi Burruss we only need you tiny and Tameka to do the album The Joint and the tour with swv make this happen do it for the fans do a full tour plus the album will be successful y'all and SWV people will buy the album plus the promotion
SWV sold more records than Xcape, and just because Kandi and Tiny feel that they have more followers, does that mean their followers will attend the concert? From my personal opinion, i follow a lot of these groups, but does it mean im kerping up with what they are doing, NO. Im sure a lot of other followers are just following and not keeping up. Yes, Kandi may have great business knowledge, but being greedy about who gets paid the most is why these groups don't last. When are you going to humble yourself and do something for the good of both groups. Let's see how long this show lasts.
When you from College Park 40:36 🤣
Wellll since Tocha is out. What about the other girl who was actually the fifth member of the group that was let go.   Let her replace Tocha for the time being.   She actually is the fifth member.
Well, it seems like all this drama right when Tocha is dropping a single is hurting Tocha career. Maybe Tocha should have stayed away.
Here are the facts. LaTocha can only do gospel, but her solo career will never take off.  She'll learn like so many artists before her. Your fans/ your audience want to see you with your group.  The days of artists leaving their group to go solo is not what it is to be.  Ask Ralph Tresvant, Coko, Bobby Brown,  Kelly Rowland, T-Boz, or Aaron Hall. The list is endless. LaTocha's career never took off because no one wants to deal with her serpent of a husband. Her husband has been her downfall. If she could've had a successful solo career,  it would've already happened. She didn't want to leave the group fully because deep down, she knows she needs the group
We don't hate you kandi, I respect it sis#23 winning year
Candy that song sounds so good I might have to look it up and listen to the whole song you sound good girl I know what nobody else talk about you always got a good strong voice and I love it
It's good and well that they opened up for you on YOUR TOUR but truth be told, SWV is global compared to your group. They literally fill up an arena here in South Africa as compared to your group. SWV helped y'all fill those venues, y'all weren't doing them a favour. Beyonce doesn't have opening acts. Xscape is not bigger than SWV. Yes they've opening for y'all then but now it's a different situation. And you constantly repeating that they sold more records in the 90s make it seem like they aren't out streaming y'all now. Even with you and tiny's reality show fame combined, they have a bigger fan base and the backlash you've received is proof of this.
I love when Kandi laugh.
I love you
End it is so annoying that Don Juan has to always insert himself when it comes to the drama like Bruh relax
To me that's the worst thing in the world to have two daughters are one daughter feel like you loved the other daughter better all come on now and maybe it does involve mama baby mama took some of that money and got this and that done okay
I understand the business part of it but I do feel it was a little ego driven as well. Then making a mutual decision to both call headline for a small tour would not hurt escape at all. SWV can pull just as much people out as escape I’ve seen it myself.
Whhyyyyy can't we minimize screen
GIIIIRL I HOPE U SPEAK ON TAMAR SHE JUST SAID YOU AND TODD THREATENED HER ON WWHL
Go sit down Latocha & Rocky
You never win when you play dirty. This is why Latocha will NEVER be a successful solo artist.
I spoke with my constituents here on the west coast and we the people feel like Tocha needs to be replaced as a group member!!   East and south let me know your vote 😂 so I can inform Kandi Tiny and Tamika
I nearly fell out of my chair when edit cut to "IF U HAD A ASS TO KISS" Kandi kandi kandi....girl Tosha gon kill youuuuu loooool
I always thought all 4 members sounded good. I liked the group as 4. But if it has to be 3…that’s cool. I always got the impression (just my opinion/allegedly) that you know who was the main problem. With no internet I still knew who was rumored to be going solo first (it wasn’t Kandi).
Ok so why bother with this reality show then? If you are saying SWV opened for you multiple times on your tour, continue your tours with them opening for you. What’s the purpose of this show if you aren’t willing to co headline?
Her husband is jealous and he’s going to help end her career. But that’s a good thing. No one was checking for this woman until the group got back together
Thanks, Kandi! You are a savvy businesswoman! Now, apparently, we need more Black Business Mangers! SWV has 2 white men managing every aspect of their music life. I know, I know! Black business managers have gotten bad raps. Be careful who you get, period.
Unpopular opinion this was based on Versus The whole concept was based on people wanting to see the groups together because of THAT appearance not based on Tv popularity or past tours new concept new payment arrangements. Like fat Joe said “yesterday’s price is not today’s price “ Just because that’s what they charge in the past doesn’t mean it can’t change. Versus put you and SWV on equal footing for this concept and tour period.
I was waiting for THIS Speak On It because I was wondering why you were going so hard on NOT Co-Headlining. I was like, she definitely gonna school me. And you did!   Thanks for the lesson. 🤗  I also feel bad for SWV now, because it appears they are working harder NOT smarter. 3-4xs less than what XScape is making is a mighty big number.
The only one on the show who has a nasty attitude is Latocha. She doesn’t exhibit anything of Christianity in her music. I wonder how many people are going to actually buy it. Because none of the people in the chats have said they would.
Tocha is A libra lie!!! Libras be lying chile!!!   😅
How is she gonna say anything about peace, she is the bad negative stank energy
With all due respect I love SWV & you already Xscape for sure as well you handled that situation like the boss that you are I understood before you broke it down & im not even in the entertainment/music industry, it probably would’ve been better if they asked for a favor so it seem as if it was expected a lil to me but no if your top billing you remain in that domain we are living in todays world/life you know now that really gave me a even brighter glimpse into how many og performers/artist think & go about things they never let that ego go, yes you probably did & was top selling decades ago but who is the artist still goin now/ today along with their followers like stated, it would make a person feel so bad especially being a fan of an iconic artist with terrible egos that think just because things were made back then they still have their way with things now it dnt work like that, we evolve everything change all the time, just speaking my opinion gotta put that out their too now because, you can go on any social media platform say for instance “facebook” what do it ask?!! “What’s on your mind” right? You will type whatever coke to mind & here you have sumbody commending under your post with the most ignorant response like do people comprehend these days lol but I do know it’s stalkers, & haters that track you down just type anything to get a rise & response from you too, but continue being great Kandi 🫶🏾
So someone help me understand this because all of these posts are saying ooh receipts and once Kandi broke it down I understand.  If it's your tour, I understand them opening.  But this is one show and I'm not understanding why there can't be stipulations for the single show vs if a tour comes up. It's a single show. They said co-headline not Xscape open. Do the fees have to change? I thought y'all were gonna be on the stage singing at the same time.
Kandi is about her dollar baby! Lol! ( In my N.O. voice)   Now Kandi! May we have a special Speak On It to address Tamar messy a*s? Lol!! Please and thank you! 😂😂 Luv ya!!
It’s the ending song of this video that was played in the show! Kandi is going to market to the T that’s for sure 🥰 love it 💕
I love Kandi edits lool...not her auntie "imma tell the truth " lol
I love how Kandi always keep it real, she don't care who you is she coming straight fact checking no tea❤
Kandi is definitely a business woman. Was not mad at all. I understood. Kandi is usually fair but this is straight business. Tamika & mother got me all emotional. Episode 3 overall was good.
SWV is wayyyy doper than Xscape. SWV has many classic songs.
kandi i like you but that was messy for you to throw Taj under the bus & say you & her had plenty of convos over the years about Taj talking about Coko to you. that was unnecessary
BBD SHOULD BEEN LAST
Tocha could have went solo when they broke up
Oooooh I'm loving these episodes
I am a big fan, BUT Of course SWV would be the opening act on an Xscape tour planned for Xscape, but that's not how this was presented. Back then, y'all hired them. This was supposed to be a joint venture. I don't blame Coko. I'm sure there are acts y'all opened for that you wouldn't open for now. I will say that SWV's live show doesn't seem to have a lot of drama needed to headline, but this would have been a time to give them that shot so both groups could eat.
Kandi respect the idea that people believe in  the power of sisterhood. Show some grace and share the headline. Show equity in pay and keep it moving.
Interview coach - white woman - LOL
I get it now❤❤❤❤
Kandi stop it !!!!...This show is different this is a Collaboration and the pay should be equal....the previous shows weren't a Collaboration...yall let Kandi feed yall BS...it's always about money with her she always want to get paid more than  anyone else
The next meme 26:26 RECEIPTS
I would respect Tocha more if she just kept it a buck and said she feels like the Beyoncé of the group, her and her sister started the group, and she feels like the strongest singer!! And keep it real on how she feels on how it did not work out , it’s killing her that Kandi, and Tiny has surpassed her hatin damaged ass, girl if you can’t beat ‘em join them!!! Chile it’s such a libra frequency honey, that woman has stopped Her growth!!! And then she tries to use the group when it’s convenient for her!!  Girl bye.. and I know energetically Scorpio, energy and libra energy off the top that Tocha is lying and she stole her sister money!!! Tocha get rid of that husband and get some self esteem!! I wish both groups love And light!! But the show Is really making Tocha look bad!!!! Tocha play ya cards right!!! Sidebar: I’m going to do a think piece on the episodes… it will be interesting!! And Tamika I know that’s your mom but respect goes both ways… i would fall back on both the momma and the sister! I would tell her ass to take that solo deal and shove it up her ass!! When I come see Escape I’m coming to see Kandi Tiny and Tamika!! I watched some passed performances and you can just see the energy of Tocha!! She feels Like she missed her mark.. she feels like she is Beyoncé and the girls are her back up singers!!! Girl bye!! Our people (black people) need to learn how to be real, transparent, communicate, and most of all keep the ego out and stick together!!! You are better together as a team… and did anyone peep her husbands Rick impression of Ike turner? Girl that man is abusive!!! You can see it!! He and Tocha herself is holding her back Chile!!!! Peep that y’all!!!! Tocha you are in the sunken place sis!!! So arrogant!! Bye Motown!!!
Kandi, if you read this.....I love your personality. You are one of the most relatable celebrities. You're honest, talented and humble. You also CAN sing. You have a knack for dealing with negativity head on. Much love
What will Xscape's fees look like when the fans get sick of all their drama and start tuning out but the group still wants to tour?  Why would Xscape think SWV would ever willingly be hoe'd out on camera just because Xscape is having a water cooler moment?  And folks really buying tickets cause nobody believes Xscape will be together in 5 years like SWV will.
She really wants freedom from Rocky 🤣🤣🤣🤣
THE DISRESPECT TO SWV KANDI 🤣🤣
If you still TRYING to go solo after 30 years then maybe it’s not supposed to happen. No shade.
Now Kandi u know it gotta be 50/50 girl u so money hungry for a bag lawd 😂😂u already eating dang
Tamika and her mom had me in my feelings too.  Mothers are especially hard to talk to.
After I watch the episode I come straight here for all the tea and facts
So so so glad you have speak on it.
I went to the okc show, and yall did amazing! And was on time, Father God!
Baby if xscape went before swv, half the crowd will be at their car when swv come on.
Kandi is really giving FREE game to all groups going forward!
SWV and Xscape are equals acts!!!
Ok! Kandi has a point about ticket sales and head lining
So a good Co-Headliner would be New Edition and SWV! I'm here for it! Lol
This is my top favorite group because they all sang... But the fact is that they live without Latocha just fine. She doesn't make the group better being involved. I hope they kick her out and be done. Xscape has 3 vocal beasts who will continue to dominate.
I love you kandi❤ your Tocha and Coco Voice overs  Hilarious!!!!!😂😂😂😂
It's funny that SWV are online now and the fans posting All the album sales they had in the day but obviously those sales didn't matter if some were homeless or damn near homeless. Maybe they should have taken care their business shit like you doing now. But hey, I'm not in the entertainment business 😂
That was y’all Tour Kandi…this is different just like if you all were on a tour with New Edition on their tour for example…you guys would not be headliners…STOP IT…in this case you guys could co-headline.
Thanks for breaking down the business Kandi. You had to take on the “manager” role and ask the difficult questions.
How come nobody helps the fallen artists?  Like where were her friends in the industry?🤔
As I listen to the segment about the headlining and fees based on that, I get what you're saying. Xscape's market share is greater due to your presence in reality tv, businesses, etc...on Tank's podcast, he half-joked about Tyrese not wanting to split the group fees of TGT evenly bc his "market share" was greater due to F&F, Transformers, social media, etc...he's a movie star and that affects crowd excitement, ticket sales, etc. It's not that others aren't talented. It's just that some people have amassed more of a following and they should get more because they bring more money through their fan base
Congratulations on your 600,000 subscribers
Of course Xscape will sell more tickets… they really just started touring again after all these years!!! Business wise, Tiny’s marriage to Ti along with their reality shows and Kandi on the housewives has given them more exposure to all groups of people!!! SWV musically wise has always kept their momentum.. so yea I get why they are more saturated!!! If it’s one show.. a collaboration should be fine, but a tour yea, I can see Xscape headlining
Kandi remember what your husband said……..
I want y'all to make the Biopic movie like the way the New Edition biopic!!!! That would be so good🔥🔥 Kandi has always been my fav from the group but they are all great singers.
In my MZ. KANDI voice "who said that?"  Clearly your voice was the sound of Xscape.💃🏾
Omg!! Kandi almost toasted the living daylights out of SWV. She was telling the truth but DAMN Kandi! 😂😂😂
All I have to say is Kandi, is where she is at today because she is talented and businesses smart. Mama didn't raise no fool. She is a smart business woman. I was happy to see her speak up. She has come to far for them not to lead. It's all about business she is absolutely right. You keep on  "Speaking On It" 👏👏👏👏
Okay KEMPIRE!!!!!
The fact that xscape is more popular in the 21st century. There pay maybe higher even on separate tours. Which defeats everything everyone is upset about.
Kandi is so smart and such a businesswoman! She deserves all of her success!
Why was not the sing lead was shared. It proved it was favoritism to you, Kandi.
Hears the thing, let's go ahead and outline this platinum thing, All of Xscape albums went plantinum, however the thing she failed mentioned is SWVs albums went multi-platinum that's a big difference.  When a album goes platinum, that means it only sold 1,000,000 copies. So if Xscape had 3 platinum albums, that's a total of 3,000,000 copies sold combined.. SWV first album went 3X platinum in 90s selling more than all 3 of Xscape albums combined, that not including the song WEAK, which went 2x platinum as a single and SWV 2nd album went 2x platinum, the 3rd album and SWV "the remixes " album both went Gold. Plus SWV has a Christmas Album, and the group put out 2 new albums one in 2012 and another 2016 that are not mentioned on the RIAA website. As of 2022, SWV first album is now certified 7X platinum, if it sell another 3,000,000 it will be certified Diamond.  Also SWV is very popular internationally and has been consistently doing shows both in the US and Internationally since they reunited in 2005. SWV is very popular in the UK, they were on a sold out tour at wembly arena in London....plus they've performed in Japan, Philippines, Australia, Jamaica, Africa, etc. Even on the show had a performance booked in S. Africa.   And about the opening act on their tours, Don Juan was trying to be slick messy, let's be clear SWV and BBD were invited guest performers on a couple of added cities to help sell tickets for those shows and was never official apart of their tour... So obviously, how are guest performers going to expect to headline someone else's show..  So of course they opened out of respect for Xscape because it was their tour.. duh..  I love Kandi and Xscape but yall ain't about to slick down play SWV. If you go and Google SWV, the first thing that comes up is, they were one of the highest and best selling R&B girl group of all times.. so how in the world you never seen where there album sales hasn't been documented.  Any on all shows, TV, media or etc. SWV has always been introduced as a multi-platinum, grammy nominated group..  Hell SWV'S " I Missed Us" album in 2012 was nominated for a Grammy for their remake of "If only you knew"..
Kandi needs to do a live chat
Beautiful moment with Mom.❤🙌🙏🏽🙌🏽
😅 love you Kandi and keep on speaking on it Sis. Love you and stay blessed❤
You should know that these record labels swindled artists.
Kandi is really business minded, I love it. Did U notice how LaTocha was looking when Kandi was discussing headlining/business, I think LaTocha is very insecure and have self-esteem issues, I think she intimidated by the rest of the girls including her sister and I think LaTocha is pretty. She gonna have to love herself
I hear you kandi. I enjoy both groups music. I just feel it's  more than just business. The flyer was already debunked as a "valid receipt" online. I never heard of a "guest group" to headline someone else's personal tour. You invited them as "guests" on "your" tour so that explained why you all headline your "own" tour.  Still, the show with SWV is not the "Great Xscape tour".  If it's really about business then why doesn't XSCAPE'S name come first in the TV show's title? Please be reminded that when it comes to fan base, SWV does have a strong cross over fan base in the US. So that could equate to more fan support and ticket sells. So it makes sense that  you all should co-headline this show.
Where is your wedding ring?
@24:12 Maybe ya'll can spit it down the middle. Ya'll headline half, SWV headline half.🤷🏾‍♀️ Either way, I'm there!💯
Now Kandi Girl… you acting like SWV was y’all opening for y’all through out y’all tour. SWV made 3-5 special performances out of 30 of y’all shows.
I cried
I had to watch that last part again 😂😂😂 that shit was funny asf 😂 them did sound like gun shots tho 😅
Kandi while all that makes sense WE DON’T CARE! As fans we operate from heart bc music connects to times in our lives. We love Xscape too but that convo u should of left for ur management to conduct whom u employ. Cuz u can’t not sound cocky about it even if it is the truth.. it’s truthfully cocky AF! 😂 We all know u a business typhoon 🌀 so won’t u leave them w/ some dignity u already take all the damn money! And u as the messenger left a bad taste. Tochas a headache enough we don’t need CoCo refusing next bc u throwin ya weight around N looking down. N saying “it’s business” its code for “ITS bout to get UGLY!” Ppl use that to be the shark!   Still love u tho 💛
I love the song at the end...❤
Kandi, when can we download ONLY FOR YOU?
NE tour more than any group I have ever seen. There is demand on the market for SWV or else no one would request them.
Social media followers don't equate to ticket sales. Also this was a one night event! To tell a group as big as SWV  that y'all want top billing was a slap in the face!
Great content as usual. Congratulations on over 600K subscribers! 🎆
Yes that person was emotional but not because of the mama I felt the pain just looking at tamika's face her eyes was full of pain and her mama was still attacking and I'm sorry because I've had  conversations like that with my mama and I'm the oldest out of three girls it's like you can't get a word in you're not listening but that I love you she do I believe her mama loves her hands down but mama you don't like her you don't like the image of her looking like her father and the reason why you have done what you have done to your daughter it's because you felt when that man walked out and left you that they should have had the same hurt pain animosity and anger that you did and that's not fair to your kids that's all I'm going to say
It’s a difference between opening for a couple of shows, and doing a complete tour.
Kandi those tours in not the same. In the past. kit was designated as The Xscape tour, and the opened for you. but this is different. This is supposed to be a joint venture, not SWV coming on to the Xscape tour!!!! Stop the cap my love!!!
Kandi and Tiny did a gr8 job in their respective careers. It’s because of them that is getting the other girls the spotlight.
Kandi, you are smart.  She is just using you all for her solo career.  If she doesn’t want to be there, let her butt go.  This is making you all look bad.  She wants to be in a position to look down on you all.  I get it, if you split the headliner that will mess up your future money. So, I am with you.
Kandy I get it, but for us 9-5pm workers who buy the tickets, who cares! Ya'll on some rich people problems shit! In the name of COVID, have several seats!
Swv is the epitome of rnb female groups.  Talented. Album sales. Hits. Good energy
I hit the 👍
Ok I see @Kempire ,@DJRichieSkye n @JustinDiego got clips in here❤
Kandi keep getting the💰💰💰💰💰💰💰 We 💯🙏🏽💕Xscape
People say one thing but the receipts say otherwise🤭 Kandi is the Queen of Receipts & I love that about you. Ain’t no false narratives over here which is why you’ll always be vindicated.   No mess just facts served well.  Furthermore, we can all agree that Kandi & Tiny’s success and popularity positively impacted Xscape’s return, their recent success, and will do the same if SWV joins them on tour.
Also it’s important to understand that SWV and BBD HELPED Xscape sell out. Both of those acts performed for years before Xscape came back (on the strength of their reality tv popularity!) It’s about the respect of the music and the careers. So yes SWV would get paid more, their fee would increase. But they deserve that. They have put aside their differences for the sake of the music and their fans(and their pockets lol) But understand the special guests that were chosen (SEV AND BBD) because they had their act together, and the ticket sales were NEEDED for those cities to sell out! So don’t drink all this Kandi Koolaid up off the strength of business when we know the buzz is not based on the success of Xscape music, they simply blew up for that tour because they had a comeback! And social media was not a marketing tool when SWV start touring and making more records back in ‘05. Kandi is essentially saying I’m taking advantage of the business opportunity and putting the respect of the groups as artists and for the MUSIC and experience. Someone commented that Pattie and Gladys are coheadlining. So it’s possible. It’s a choice,l! Keep your fee or figure out a fee that works out for SWV and Xscape even if it causes for SWV fee to increase! And go be great. You already won financially Kandi, what will it truly hurt you.. it’s like damn, the business make sense but what about respect and humility !  You will never say SWV is the better group. We can’t even trust we will get all four members of your group! And you want us to pay to see y’all! Y’all drunk in the comments. 🧐🤦🏻‍♀️😂
Kandi you so wrong for putting that clip of tiny in there(if you had a a** to kiss)😂😂😂😂
I am glad you feature Kempire and Bingeworthy. If you can please do interviews with them as well
WE ALL KNOW "KANDI DON'T LIE" AND ALWAYS HAS "RECEIPTS"!!! THE BREAKDOWN THAT SHE DOES IS MIND-BLOWING & FACTUAL!!! #RECEIPTS! #PRICELESS! 🔥🔥🔥🥰
What you're not saying is did the contract with the network say SWV were co-headlining or guest. Kandi you are defensive. I expect you to cry any minute.
@kandionline If it was a one night only event, I do think the most fair thing is to do is co headline. I think it would also be dope if y'all wrote a new song together and were able to close out the show together. It really is a celebration of music with those who grew up with you.  Great Breakdown!! Tocha on the other hand is definitely using the show as a launching pad.  I think it was NeNe who said you can't win when you play dirty...
Shoutout to @kempire for getting recognized.
1) I believe Tamika about her mother. The energy she gave was giving guilty vibes. 2) You are always a BOSS and as the scene was rolling I already knew that you were in business mode and this Speak On It summarized everything. Also I appreciate how this show presents reality despite some of it not being shown. You have always been a genuine person and I understand all your tears. You don’t fake shyt. Keep being Kandi.
Kandi is Boss Lady keeping it real 💯
We love ❤️ you kandi
Even tho Tamika made up with her mom, I hope she still puts up a healthy boundary for herself. Kandi is being very humble explaining the business part, I would be the same.
Kandi is a business woman and if the business is not right, Kandi will not press play. #TeamKandi
@9:45 I just want to point how you ALWAYS shoutout other people's ventures and endeavors on your platform, no matter what. 👍🏾👍🏾 Ok, now let's get into this MESS!!!😉
Preeeeeach Kandi! You always are the voice of reason and breaks it all down for us 🙏
All that business talk and not wanting to take less for one or two shows, and now it’s only 3 members and promoters ain’t gonna look at y’all the same, value wise. Stay humble.
Kandi can sing 🎶. Even when you out in the club don’t think I’m not 🎶.
Tochas negative demeanor supersedes her talent.
Y'all better stop playing with Kandi Burrus Tucker!🤣🤣
w/r/t the co-headlining topic, it sounds like whatever deal was struck allowed SWV to be paid way more than they were getting previously, which is great. Kandi made all of the right business points but I think what's ruffling people's feathers is the way the tour was proposed. In the beginning it was pitched as a show they would co-headline but once negotiations started, SWV realized that they will be openers. Personally, I love both groups but I will say that Xscape, notably Tiny & Kandi, have kept the group popular after all these years with different projects (reality shows, singles, etc) whereas SWV, although they tour, they don't have projects that command  fan attention. ALSO - there is a hidden expense associated with planning this type of tour and it's TIME. It's clear Kandi (and likely Tiny as well) has been the one crafting the show and although I'm sure she does it out of the goodness of her heart, she also deserves a slight premium for that alone. She's helping everybody get paid tbh
Kandi is right I looked up the performance fee and XSCAPE SAYS 605,000 while SWV SAYS 75k max
Business is Business. It might have been better if each group's management handled it like you said because it was definitely awkward to watch as a fan of both groups. I think when Coko refers to 30 mil records sold she means worldwide not just U.S. sales 🤷🏻‍♂️ I appreciate your honesty Kandi! 😁
You were the headliners! SWV were humble to be guests for Xscape after your looong hiatus but know that your group have never opened for an international musical act
I cant wait to get this song she playing at the end!!! Love Love LOVE IT KANDI❤❤❤❤
I love the ladies of Xscape but I was disappointed that none of them said anything when Kandi spoke up for them . They left her out there by herself knowing they all felt the same way . She was protecting the brand and speaking up for the entire group by herself or maybe they edited that part out 🙄
Yes this episode was really good!! What’s up with the situation about You, Todd and Tamar?? She said y’all threatened her🧐
Well Dang Kandi,,,thanks for breaking it down
Kandi you are a solid person stay that way....also love that hook you singing what's the name of that song anyone?
I definitely cried when they showed Tamika and her mom. Balled...
Love Kandi
Xscape is lucky to have you advocate for their business interest. It’s an uncomfortable conversation that need to be handled properly.
CONGRATS
Yes! One thing about it. Kandi and Don Juan they gon pull receipts.I love it. If I get famous one day Kandi I want you to be my manager. 😉😊😊
Please bring some of the girls on this show to review with you
As long as she is with that dirty husband she will never reach her full potential.. he doesn't know what hes doing
I’m a huge SWV fan… and can admit I was like “Just Co-headline” but now that you broke down the BUSINESS… it makes sense! Can’t be mad at it at all!! Album sales from then don’t fill seats now 🤷🏾‍♂️.
Kandi literally wins at everything she does!
Kandi brings straight FACTS and is a true BUSINESS woman! That’s why she has more money than all of them! It’s business y’all
Kandi broke this down and printed those receipts in real time with 4k hd clarity! Now THAT’S Taurus energy♉️
The ending was HILARIOUS…love it! U gotta being Tiny on!
Idk why people keep saying she can’t sing Tocha voice isn’t all that great either 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ people hate kandi just to hate her
If you look up Bo$$ in the dictionary you going see Kandis face and I love it 💰
It’s obvious that Latosha Scott is jealous of Kandi / Todd /Tiny success . Kandi is a writer, producer, restaurant owner, broadway , movies , multiple businesses ,(adult product line) singer and performer…now let’s hear Latosha Scott / résumé ??? 🤫🤫🤫
Kandi stay true your self keep giving us facts the truth hurt Girl be about your business ok...🙏🏾😇🙏🏾💙💙💙💙💙💙🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰Tx 💙💙💙💙 all-day
SWV sold 11.5 million  records  and Xscape  sold 9 million  records
5:52 I cried for real!! That was very touching!
Respectfully, Xscape don't have all albums platinum as you stated. SWV has the most, we NOT looking at social media.
Thank you Kandi for educating us. This is why you’re my favorite you  continue teaching us the business ❤❤
Kandi girl …ya betta SPEAK on it !
It's a one time thing and Kandi is being greedy and cocky.
You gotta love Kandi's transparency. If she doesn't explain the inside drama we see on social media we will never know the truth.  SWV is an amazing group and there was no shade just business
Kandi is a true business woman
Kandi isn't this what got you in trouble with that petty, crybaby, looks constipated when he sings, member  of B2M. If I were in the entertainment industry you would definitely be my manager, because I know I would get every penny I worked hard for. The way you handle your business is very straightforward and classy.
Would I go to SWV concert or XSCAPE concert? I would go to XSCAPE because Kandi and Tiny are household names. The last time I heard of SWV was when I was a kid, and their faces aren't recognizable. The reason the one member could get a job at the water company and nobody knew is because they are not recognizable alone.
I love you Kandi
Yes latocha full of 💩
Kandi firstly you can't sing like Beyonce, Adele, Tamar, Celine Dion, Jennifer Hudson, girl your voice is horrible by the way. Tosha is the reason why the group was successful. Devante song lead on all jodeci albums but we all know that Kc and Jojo were the best singers like Tosha and Tamika. Swv has sold over 30 million and Xscape only sold 7 million. Tiny should shutup about reality show fame. Lest be clear only legendary reality stars are the Osborne's, the Kardashians, paris and nicole, Nene leakes and snookie from Jersey show the rest of yall are fillers. Your restaurants has horrible reviews and you dont pay your employees Jack. How dare you talk about anyone mama when mama Joyce has acted a fool from day one. Kandi you dont look like porsha Stay loosing and going around in circles with your failing in grades resturants
I have a whole new respect for Kandi… dem heels has to be hard to walk in… black smart beautiful and successful in a man world… it appears as if she coming of cocky but in actuality she’s in full business mode… at all times…. Kandi continue doing what your are doing.. keep God first and continue to be a business role model
Thanks for the explanation Kandi. Cause girl I wasn’t feeling you after seeing that episode! Makes more sense now. I know how production likes to spin narratives on these shows.
Kandi Tocha gonna say you body shamed her with that clip. Lil😂😂😂😂😂
Hey Kandi, big mouth tamar talking about you and her husband, please shut her up, talking about ya''ll put put hands on her. she want be engaged for long, she can't keep a man. Love you queen
❤❤I ABSOLUTELY LOVE YOU! ESPECIALLY BC YR SO REAL! &YOU GIVE US FANS JUST ENOUGH OF YR LIFE 2PEAK IN! &ENJOY YOU&YR VIBES& ENJOY YOU AS A PERSON! YR A BOSS B***H PERIODT END OF DISCUSSION!❤❤❤❤❤LOVE U!❤
Repost Her saying she’s the 5th member just because she supported her dreams, is like if my son became a Dr. and i say I’m a doctor too 💀 because if it wasn’t for me supporting his career and helping him financially with his student loans, he wouldn’t be where he is.   It’s a parents JOB to support their kids in their dreams. She can’t insinuate that tamika needs ti be grateful for that, like they say, either support someone and help them from the bottom of your heart, or don’t do it at all. Just to throw it in their face later on in life. For her mom to insert herself into her daughters group and take credit for their hard work is so sad, and to claim that she put in the work, just like her daughters did, is so disrespectful to the hard work XSCAPE actually put in to get to where they are now. They can SING, that’s why they are where they are, they continued to work hard and go on tour, that’s why they are famous. The parents helped and supported their children, THATS THEIR JOB. Quit saying that parenting is something kids should be grateful for !
But this is a collab.....so you both will headline.
Well said!!! 👏🏾👏🏾
Sorry SWV should headline  before y’all.
Mane one thing for sure Kandi a smart lady and going to bring the tea!!! And the Truth Her math be mathing lol😂😂😅
Maybe she dont want to sing secular music
The mom is super toxic in their sibling relationship. She needs to recognize how her involvement hinders their healing.
Kandi drop the song lol, can’t wait to play it.
The song at end 💃🏿💃🏿💃🏿💃🏿❤️💯
They had me crying Kandi😢
At least let them have this one time Kandi.
Kandi so mofo buisness savvy! Those receipts put everything into place for me. Wow. Kandi and Tiny literally are carrying xscape on thier backs.
Is his Rocky or Raquel🤔?! Sir you need to stay out of womenS business🤫!! On periodT🤬!!
I don’t like what you saying Kandi, you expect them to take shorts but not your group because y’all bring out Youg Joc And TI in y’all performance girl bye now you acting like Tosha SWV is not beneath Xscape they a legend
I totally understand what Kandi is saying. Tiny is right reality tv fan base added to the group musically. Kandi also about the bag💰💰💰💰 Side note:: I’m loving this series!!! Kandi’s confessional looks are 🔥 very gorgeous!!
Kandi always keeps it real!  I LOVE that about her…I agree with what she said about the business aspect & headlining with SWV. This debacle with Tocha is sad & deflection is her rouse. She needs to do & be better!   Mona Scott Young did her thing. GREAT show.
Kandi that poster from your flunky Don Jon is not a receipt. That was your groups official tour, the other two were guest. The proposal now is that the show is officially both groups, equal, not a guest appearance.  Your example is not a receipt, sorry. It is a equal billing show, period. Stop being so greedy Kandi.
Why do they keep changing Kandis voice like that when she imitates Latocha. Bish that got me  dead. I don't know if that is Kandi doing her voice like that or computer generated. It's so funny. I'm screaming.
Yall need to co headline srry thts my opinion hope it works out
Congratulations!!!
I was at that Kansas City, MO show and it was AMAZING!!!! I've made the comment that SWV opened for Xscape before and people called me a liar and said I was making it up, LOL!! Haha, @kandionline brought the receipts!!
❤❤❤
600,000 subscriber on the speaker and it lets us all take her to the 1 million subscriber by the end of 2023 share the live tell a friend we can do it together 1 million subscriber can we do it yes we can
I didn’t blame y’all for that dress because it didn’t make sense to me…
The girls that get it get it! We know you aren’t out here playing people! But we do appreciate the breakdown because people stay coming for you
SWV and BBD got a quick bag while only doing half the work. They BOTH eclipse Xscape in every single way and that is the truth. The consumer is always right
I love that Tamika put her foot down with her mother, when she told her mother she won't support her no more mom got the message and acted right. Kandy I love you but I'm on SWV side with this one, yes they might open for you guy on your concert, but that wasn't xscape concert, that was a joint event and needed to headlined as such.
Xscape just looks more like Stars than SWV
Ya’ll need to do a montage of Kandi’s expression for this show. All her expression will come from episode 2.  Kandi’s expression says, “ This some bullsh#t”
Well, I guess all we Needed WAS UNDERSTANDING.....EASY AS 1 2 3.....😂😂😂😂😂😂
Rocky worked for R.Kelly , that says enough!
#Continue2BeGreat Kandi
Candy. Please tell her to leave the group and do us a favor please she acts like we are really going to miss  her. And Candy I usually don’t say negative things I really don’t , but this is just getting on my nerves now , because you and the rest of the girls could take your voices and just go ahead on. Seriously wish her the best and just go on.  Now It would be a big,big difference ,If you were leaving the group, it would be a big, big loss and then there would not be any more group trust me !thank God that’s not gonna happen  because we  love you “Candy”and because we need you definitely.!!!!!🤗 so that parts over !!! “Next”, “LOL”anyway Candy ⭐️congrats on  any and  all things that you do and God bless you and your family and your group !🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🔥🔥🔥🔥♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
🛑 nope ( the look at me moving her face / the holding the arms open waiting for her to come to her) nope too aggressive & waiting on her to come to her (your daughter is hurt love her embrace her go to her)😢😢 kandi please be the friend & SISTER❤ she needs now that you two are getting closer!!!!!!!
They the better musical group.
I love how Kandi knows BUSINESS. All these SWV fans not buying these tickets to make them a headline. These Xscape fans tbough...WE COME THROUGH.
The way they pursued this solo project by being sneaky and ugly and conniving, it won't be successful. After watching her lying and being difficult I don't see who's going to support that.
Yess Kandi for featuring my best friend in my head @Kempire on his reviews and receipts ❤❤❤❤ you know she gon have her receipts and facts together #taurusgang
KANDI! you made a lot of sense <3 If Xscape has been headlining they should continue headlining. Business NOT personal!
Kandi FINALLY got vindicated on this show. Dragged as a villain for years!!!!!!!! When the real villain was tocha all along……. She is jealous of all of them!!! #mamawrongastwoleftshoes
I’m not liking how Kandi talking stop trying to put SWV beneath your group, I will buy SWV music over Xscape any day we play their music at parties not Xscape just because y’all on RHOATL and Tiny Husband TI don’t make y’all bigger artists like you said Kandi your voice is just a sound for the group Xscape, I’m glad yo understand that because 🙄 we’ll never mind
When she started in on Tocha I hollered !
I understand and admire Kandi's approach to the headliner scenario but for that same reason I can understand why SWV would desire to CO headline. They were not saying they wanted to be lead, they wanted the billing to be equal and just because you did something in the past doesnt mean that has to be the only way to do it.
Kandi could they not have changed their fee to more? Could this not have been a time for you guys to support another girl group? Help them get the rate and headlining title. Idk seems harsh. Guess this shows why Kandi is the boss she is…but damn 😬
Kandi I was crying too when Tamika was talking to her mother 😢❤
Damn mama D, Joyce, Frankie or Jim Jones mama ain’t got shit on this mama…… fifth member aka she jealous mama
I have A LOT to learn cause I sure did think a "Headliner" was the one that  went 1st..lol
Good riddance, she and her husband think they are more important than they are. I'm so happy for you guys made it worked without her and they couldn't stop perfection or history. By the kudos to Tamika for stepping up and shinning on her part and her sister's part.
Thanks for better explanation of business side when it comes to the promotors. At the end of the day you were making sure it was fair. ❤
Look... with or without LaTocha or SWV....Miss Kandi is gon' ALWAYS be GOOD!!
Everyone know that Escape not Escape without Kandie
Perhaps Tocha is among the undiagnosed population. It sounds like she needs counseling from herself and clearly her husband. It’s too much self sabotaging & blaming others going on that she will NOT take ACCOUNTABILITY for. She also needs to take her mom with her. It can be a great journey of healing. FRFR. 😢
LOL....but Xscape name is headlining on that flyer because it was YALL TOUR. XSCAPE'S TOUR. This SWV AND XSCAPE tour is NOT YOUR TOUR, IT'S ALL OF YALL TOUR. SWV is not your "guest" on this tour. Just stop it and have several seats billy goat!
People will always believe A LIE.....Before thecTRUTH!!!!! Sooooo let us just keep it💯
@ Kandi, see this is why I love you and agree you have to put it on the table upfront to prevent miscommunication, so I totally understand your explanation from the business perspective. I love SWV too and am in the age range of those ladies, but was down with Xscape's return tour in Columbus, Ohio and will be again given the chance. My mom is deceased, so it definitely touched my heart and brought tears watching Tameika and her mother, so I pray her mother finally gets it and will turn over a new leaf. Unfortunately, Tocha is not making it easy with all the innuendos and insinuations about her sister's mental capacity and creating more rumors on you. Tocha needs to release her jealousy of you and take accountability for her actions throughout the years just like everyone else, but especially now.
What's wrong with co-headlining? Everything can't be about $...you guys just have differing opinions🤷🏾‍♀️
I appreciate the fact that Kandi takes emotions out of this in every video and states facts. Keep rising queen💜
Kandi your voice is so unique... I  love it and we love you ❤
Will Xscape perform anywhere outside of the USA?
DAMN CANDY THAT WAS A HUGE RECORD BUSINESS LESSON!!! 😮😮😮 HOW DARE THEY TRY YALL!  Coco knows she in that regular house like my Mama's & not ballin'. Taz knows she is not a draw WE BARELY REMEMBER HER, & LeLe neither. BUT GOOD 90's SONGS though. They are not selling out 28 shows.  They want equal billing, equal money, yall getting screwed.  Tiny did speak up to support or help them come-up off yall back or agree to take less money as an opener. Yall will look foolish co-headlining. But can sell out stadiums. I'm not biased. I'll listen on the IPOD as NeNe says to ya both. But BUSINESS WISE YOU ARE RIGHT. Sorry, I'm not a fan really to buy a ticket to either but I sat my ass down when you spoke business. I support by subscribing. That is asking a lot for equality. I'D have to pass. They have been expecting to be Openers AND THEY ARE BROKE COMPARED TO YOU & TINY. Receipts show that. They know they see a big payday. Somebody tell SWV how much yall pull & DON JUAN needs to DO A FINANCIAL REVIEW OF THEIR ACCEPTANCE PRICE FOR SHOWS. SCREW EQUAL. THEY ARE NOT COMMANDING THE SAME PAY IF YALL GET 4X Them HELL NO. They know it & scamming or don't understand for REAL. MGR IS STUPID TOO AGREEING WITH THEM. DONT GIVE IN.  DON JUAL ASK TO see W-2's. Credit Reports or add up gross sales of their shows & get to the money truth of reality. SWV is wrong. "But... it's a slick move & a good smuck deal to do a money grab." They know they wont get a payday like this again if its not equal. They will go back to opening also and yall will look stupid.  KANDI YOU JUST EDUCATED A LOT OF ARTISTS WHO DON'T KNOW OR UNDERSTAND PLACEMENT ON TOURS. 😮 WOW WHAT A LESSON! EVEN COMEDIANS FIGHT ON ORDER OF BILLING SHERRI SHEPHERD SAID IT & Demands it!. FIGHT FOR YOUR RIGHT TO MAINTAIN YOUR WORTH. This could ruin yall. Coco aint got no money. They could not go solo & succeed. Why wait to come up now. They had years to show they dont need anybody and rock a house. Taz has no real name recognition. Lelee I know from working at Insurance job and got clowned in the news. Now they are equally worth all of yall.  Cray -Cray at the highest! But an excellent attempt on SWV's part.
It’s like saying Kandi has a high following on insta  and Chaka khan doesn’t so Chaka should open up for XCAPE that does not make annnny sense lol and would never happen lol, you better sit down Kandi SWV is a bigger group you should be humbled that they opened up for you before and wanting to co headline lol. Get real lol
No no Kandi just because SWV went on stage before you don’t mean they opened for youGet it right they just went first,  and so did BVD stop trying to put Xscape above them because y’all not I like SWV music better give them respect they not trying to belittle your group Xscape or y’all successful journey stop playing now you acting like Tosha
Why you 3 guys can do new album?
Sounds like a scheme that Todd set up for you to come at SWV with the bullsh*t
What SWV need to do is go to the school of business through Kandi. Kandi has been and will continue to be successful in all of her business ventures because she knows every detail of whatever business deal she is apart of! Great job Kandi! Keep doing big things and impressing us all!
I woke up and saw the notification and Chile I clicked on this video so fast 😂😂
It  don’t come together because of  what she is doing
To me it’s not about who deserves to headline or if they opened for y’all before, it’s about the way the tour was presented. If you come at me saying you want to do (or agree to do) a collaborative joint effort, I’m gonna be pissed if later on you tell me you actually want to headline the tour and that I’m basically your opening act. Y’all should’ve presented it that way from the beginning, or clarified that this is how it would have to be at the first meeting so nobody’s time is wasted (I don’t remember who pitched the idea of a joint tour).
Plus, the Green dress made her stand out....Like she was the Lead Singer....Tocha did that on purpose....she knew😮
Kandi I adore and love but Co-headlining is the ethical thing to do. Granted the conversation around business is complicated and clearly you have the receipts to back up your point of view but I think one group headlining specifically regarding this television special is a bit egotistical. Makes me wonder if this was a set up since versus.
Yesssss, Kempire. I love him!
Kandi💋😉😚☺️😊🤩😍🥰😘Is Why This Canadian Loves Talented Southern Belles From Atlanta Georgia🇺🇸 Ray Charles Voice 💯👍
I Love when kandi bring receipt she is very credible and you know Sheila she’s not lying. She always tell the truth and nothing but the truth so help me God that’s why she is so successful. She’s very Honus and she loves everyone of them in the group and she want the best for everyone but don’t lie on her, good job kandi keep bringing the receipt
I stand with EVERYTHING you’re saying Kandi!! Team Xscape all say, period!!
Business is business!!! A close mouth don’t get fed but it also put your work and worth in another person hands i applause you kandi
Ike....I mean her husband is in her ear!!!! Tocha is going thru some shit!!! Eat the cake annie mae....EAT IT!!!!!
Woooh Chile. This was informative! Now you’ve GOT TO SPEAK ON THIS TAMAR STUFF!!!!  We are not used to you backing away from a back story. Please enlighten us🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Thank you so much Kandi for the insight and information into what the billing situation has been for some time with the Xscape and SWV concerts. And, you are absolutely right! Once you start messing with your money and the word gets out that you were willing to low ball your pay, you’ll never be able to convince the promoters to pay you at the higher rate again. SWV wouldn’t agree to a lower pay if they were the top bill act. So, they can’t in good conscience expect Xscape to do it either. You are a boss lady Kandi, and I am here for learning from you about the business side of the music industry all day long. Peace & Love!
That was a good breakdown. I do hope however that if the tour is possible that both groups would take turns closing the shows. It would be only be fair. Just how I feel
Kandi.. TALK YA SHIT!!!! 😊
I do like that Kandi is business minded but I do agree with Co headlining. Xscape came back on the scene a few years ago. SWV has sold way more albums and it's not by a few million. 25 million plus in comparison to 7 or 8 million is a drastic difference. Even if Xscape charged 3 times more there are 4 women in the group in comparison to 3. After Versuz it made people want to see both groups even more which is why it's fair to do it 50/50. SWV does tour more than Xscape and both groups likeness is being used. I don't see why both groups can't make the same amount and headline. SWV is the most established group so why not take turns like they did on Versuz or Xscape open up for SWV it should be an honor. Kandi keep saying swv sold more records in the 90s well XScape sold a small amount in the 90s too and hasn't had a record since. It's a collab work together.  I would also add that if Xscape can sell out and headline a show without Xscape or any open acts why do a tour or performance with SWV? If you don't need them and they need you more why use their likeness and fan base? Tiny mentioned that after Versuz they weren't receiving calls like they should've. If it's mutually beneficial both parties headlining seems like a great idea. Someone mentioned SWV ticket sales are lower but they're not the headliners of the shows booked right? If both groups headlined and have opening acts the shows would sell out.
❤❤❤
Tocha does not like anyone in the group....Hell, I don't think she likes herself......Tocha has ISSUES
At the end of the day Business is Business!!!!! Kandi & Tiny was Right ....their millions of fan base will be selling tickets! We  didn't know SWV was in concerts and would not sell more tickets without xscape.....Good Job Kandi! They keep forgetting Kandi's resume .....❤❤❤❤❤
Kandi. I live for your speak on it because you keep it real. I agree with Todd 100% when he stated Latosha is jealous of your success. It's so obvious because in her mind you are the one who blocked her success. Keep doing your thing Kandi.
I just finished watching the episode. If the shoe was on the other foot I'm sure SWV would do the same thing. This is why Kandi is so successful. You have to separate the personal from the businesses. And I'm assuming if let's say Xscape agreed to co headline a tour with SWV and low-ball themselves. I would like to think that this will affect any future tour business Xscape has b/c they're lowering their Brand's value.
I bought SWV music, not Xscape in my city The RB radio station Always play SWV music they barely play Xscape songs and I’m from Michigan
Kandi can sang... That baby got range!!!
TEAM XSCAPE BABY
1 thing Kandi gon'do is ALWAYS tell the TRUTH ,  not only the black and white but EVERYTHING in between.
Maybe Tocha is Bipolar. ...something just ain't right with her....Her husband needs to fall back & maybe she needs to Preach, because every question she needs to Pray!!!! SHE IS CONFUSED & KEEPS ME CONFUSED...SO I KNO HOW THE GROUP FEELS.....SMDH, OVER & OVER!!!!!
I had to make 2 comments I love ❤️ Kandi she’s my BFF in my head!
Even with the reality TV following that Kandi and Tiny has, I personally like SWV songs waaay more than Xscape songs.
Tosha really needs to stop. If you have a formula that works then leave it along she is very dramatic.
Petty as well. Please !!!! Black women...
LEFT EYE (RIP)BROKE IT DOWN ON HOW DIRTY THE MONEY BE IN MUSIC! I NEVER FORGOT THAT
EVERYONE WAS EXCITED BUT LaTocha,  SWV & XSCAPE
I’m so glad y’all group went forward without Tosha, y’all are better with three if I was y’all I wouldn’t let Tosha come back to the group she a dark cloud
Tamika and her mom was sad to watch I know how tamika feels hope her in her mom can get thru they issues 😢
Business is business I agree
The faces & the editing is always ON POINT Kandi 😂😂
❤❤ 😂
In my house it does not matter what Kandi is on they say “There’s Your Girl ❤️”.  My Son and I loved the music and We traveled to ATL to OLG.  I’m still waiting to see them on a tour 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Based on the conversation tonight on speak on it.....looks like we are not getting a show
Kandi: If it don't make dollars; it don't make sense! #Receipt!
Kandi, I know how you feel❤
❤❤❤
SWV headlines in Detroit we love them here. Gladys and Patti are coming Mother's Day and the is no headliner. That's what we wanted from y'all. How powerful that would have been.
Kandi, ya better hush chile!!!! Because you will be the Damn Blame if Tocha FAILS....
Absolutely nothing Tosha say sound good, A blind man can see  She used the group to come back together but meanwhile her and her husband was looking to do other deals and then when she got another deal her attitude turned to a selfish diva but the thing is she could have done both everybody else is, because her solo project just might not go well she definitely not Tamala Mann, and she got a fake attitude to me she a whole mess
I cried too Kandi. Im glad they made up. Now Tocha needs to run that check to her sis💰
Love you Kandi!! I see your point; you’re a great business woman!!
I remember when y'all got back together and came here to Essence Festival, y'all caused a riot 😂. And when y'all came back on The Great Xscape Tour later that year, y'all still cause a riot. Y'all do sell out because you guys do bring in the folks.   One thing I need y'all in the entertainment business to stop looking down on "regular jobs". You know a lawyer, doctor, engineer (me), nurse and professor are all regular jobs. Let them people get a regular job because it might lead to a better regular job, i.e. what I have. Because some of us are living just as good or better than some in the entertainment business.   Tell Riley, she can still get her Music Business degree but add onto it with a Law Degree ( just two more years).
Good show and I like that song Kandi! What's the name of it? 😊
DEY CAME ON INDA DAYTIME!!
KANDI IS GIVING THE COURSE THAT KATT WILLIAMS TRIED TO GIVE MONIQUE!!! She is right… SWV JUST NEEDA FIGURE OUT THERE FEE AND TRY TO GET MORE THAN THEY WAS GIVING BEFORE!!!
KANDI SNAPPED ON COME A LITTLE BIT CLOSER🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We can all learn from Kandi ladies. Business is Business! No hard feelings. I love it. You a class act Kandi.
Yall coming to Augusta, Ga????
Rocky is using this huge opportunity to get his wife out there. Think about it, this is the biggest audition she can have. What was she doing before you all got back together? I am really interested in knowing. They are so ugly.
Go to school or get a job Jaelin.  imo   Grow up, imo
AND BOOM THIS IS WHY * $HE * IZ * BO$Z * 🎤
Kandi I love this speak on it show but if possible can you get the lady that's doing the questioning to speak louder cause I can't hear the questions @ all.
What no one can do is come for top dog business woman Kandi what she said is what she said. She knows money and business take note.
Definitely respect kandi with the business
What we were waiting for was a collab that's why we were watching the show because we wanted a collab because of what we saw at versus   Tamika already set the stage when she talked about her vision for the show. So to all of a sudden switch it. I would feel some kind of way too. We don't care what went on in the past we wanted a collab
Their mom was wrong & it hurt to see her cry....If that is the case, it's 7 members!!!! Kandi & Tinys mom are Escape also...
I get it.. It's business and some of us may not understand all the in ans out of the music industry. I for one can say Kandi gives us facts and don't try to sugar coat it. When one group is an opening act keep it that way. Xcape brings the energy and you get more of a show in their performance. I have yet to see either group in concert, with exception of YouTube, but even in the 90s when both groups were out m, concert tickets sold, when the group Xcape was on the tickets. But any who, I wish both groups success and happiness at the end of it all, they will be in the music history book. ❤❤❤
Ouuuuu chile! I love me a Kandi Koated breakdown of facts. Some people really need to move beyond the headlines. Love that Kandi was able to offer the viewers a different perspective and still maintained a generous level of respect for her colleagues!
The great Xscape Tour lol Kandi don't play
When it comes to Tosha's gospel gig, there is automatic conflict between trying to perform secular shows simultaneously. Whether spectators inside or outside of the "church" agree, or like it or not, the very nature of "The Gospel" is that one has "come out of the world" i.e. cut off worldly behavior. So, I'm not sure if Tosha is quietly having this battle in her mind, and just not vocalizing it, but that is a very real issue. What kind of image would Tosha have singing on gospel airways, Christian "venues", churches, etc while also wearing skimpy booty shorts and gyrating on the stage with Xscape? Not a good look, although on the contrary, modern or progressive Christianity would say that you can do both, the very foundation of Christianity clearly makes a distinction about being being born again, putting on the new man and not walking in the flesh. We do see and understand that many people in the church give a false persona with hypocritical actions, but we also have to understand that everyone who claims to be a "Christian" is not one just because they confess to be or go to church. That's why they have to keep up the facade or justify worldly behavior. But, whether it is a facade or the real thing, is Tosha going to generate enough fans to have a lucrative solo gospel deal by crossing over? Who gone be checking for that gospel album??🤔Who are these people, where they at. Let's get a count, and does that equal a real coin, is the question🪙
Great show tonight 💛👍🏼👏🏼
Loved Xscape... never been a Kandi fan, but baby I have gained a NEW respect for this woman. She should teach a class! Talk about resilience... she turned lemons to Millions when she was dealt a bad deal *after the group broke up*. I don't like the Housewives and the foolery, fakeness, that came with it.  But turning in to her show recently gives me a better idea who she is and how she has become the BUSINESSWOMAN she is today. Salute ❤
Kandi a Boss. Imma take her advice every time. I appreciate her speaking up on behalf of her group.
Dang Kandi is a boss in business go Ace🎉
Jalen should really stay in school. He needs to be told the truth and not what he wants to hear. No shade but that voice is not it.
Kandi do something with this foggy camera girl. You too high tech for this. Where my boy Todd production???
Kandi U broke it ALL The Way DOWN for me ,About billing, Status and DEFINITELY HEADLINING enough said, I UNDERSTAND NOW 🖤 QUEEN THANK YOU ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ 💕 me so XSCAPE and SWV 🙏😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😀
MIX EMOTIONS
I love all of you ladies in both groups.  But I respect  you for standing up for your coins. I don't blame you.
New Edition should not be in the conversation. They are epic. And, no disrespect, I like songs from SWV better.😊 Lastly, why does Tocha think she is the best singer in the group? I personally think Tamika sings better, and she is the most humble. Anyway, my opinions are not considering the business side of the industry. I love Ace too.❤
YOU NOT THE FIFTH MEMBER, YOU NOT PUTTING IN THE HARD WORK & MANY HOURS
Ace knows his place value numbers, he read it better than some grown folk, great job Kandi and Todd❤
I was bawling on that 1st scene w/ Tomeka & her mom. Glad the mom came around & showed her some love!
Loved the episode Kandi!! Very insightful information about everything going on with all you ladies and the business.  Also, it was sweet when they surprised you at the end, but it was messed up how they scared you. Congrats on over 600k!!!🎉❤❤
The business side Kandi provided was very informative!
interview coach or, a controlling lame/live off my wife's coattails type of Husband!?!?! Lolz... shiiiit!!!
When Kandi starts talking business I'm on the edge of my seat like I'm back in school 🏫😊👍👏
Love you Kandi!! You are a boss!!
Your song easier from your first album is 🔥  makes me sad
I’ve never heard anyone discuss how when LaTocha was showing her green dress in her Text when she was saying no one told her about the colors to wear…if you look at the screenshot, it’s cropped and at the top you can see a portion of a previous pic that has the same color material that the rest of y’all wore to the awards
Okay since you broke it down like that .. I can understand now why you wanted you guys to headline.
I don't know if it's just me but the scene with Tamika and her mom looked like a child getting scolded. I felt so bad for her. I don't care how old you are, I can't imagine ANYONE being ok with being talked to like that.
THAT'S WHY LaTocha MAD, CAUSE YOU TURNING SHADE TREE TO A MONEY TREE
This is good Kandi.  Keep teaching us about Business.  You should write a book one day.
#selfsabotage Tocha could win by working with Xscape and having an influential woman like Kandi promote her solo career in a much more positive light. #nottoobright 💡🧐
She wants Freedom away from her abusive husband
See, Tocha don't wanna totally let go of Excape cause she really don't know how her solo thing is gonna go. She wanna have Excape to falk back on. She need to just go cause it's not fair to the girls to not know if she gonna participate or not.
Who is “y’all”? Cus I already knew better
I'm sorry I did not cry nor was I emotional when Tameka and her mom were talking. It was very cringy to me. Although the storyline may be real the interactions sometimes feel overdone for reality TV giving very much Tyler Perry play...🤷🏿 The mom is bitter and mean and if what Tameka says is true that glossed over generic apology she gave is not gonna fix it
These edits , flashbacks, and voice overs be having me dyin !!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I’m so glad Kandi got to clear her name without even doing a whole lot. That’s God fr when you’re vindicated, but by the other person showing their ass and you telling the truth.
She can be an entertainment lawyer, the best of both worlds
BossLady ❤
Soooo can we reignite this tour idea... with 3 members? And WHEN👀... You do, please don't forget Canada! (I'm speaking it into existence 😂❤) ##XscapeSWVTourPlease #SpeakOnIt 🥰🤗🎉
I love that you always break things down!  I now totally understand why you maintained y’all being the headliners!!!  One thing Kandi go do is have that BUSINESS right!!!
I am proud to say that I will NOT be apologizing to you because I have been #TeamKandi since Day 1 😂
I hear you, but nah you should still be co headlining. You get whatever fee you get, and they get whatever fee that they advocate for. What's the problem?!
I LOVE ME SOME KANDI
I’ve learned so much about the business in just these 3 speak on it episodes. Kandi is definitely about her Biz and I love it
Sounds like SWV can learn a lot from Kandi's business acumen.
Kandi, keep the receipts coming especially since we are in the age "my truth" and "fake news". I heard "Speak On It" mentioned in many reviews and even viewers like myself mentioned "Speak On It" in the comments.
Tocha need to stop  it’s been a 100yrs and her solo career aint happened  people will only listen to her shady ass in Excape  just my opinion
TEACH KANDI TEACH!!!
Seems like LaTocha is jealous of you Kandi. I wonder if her mom sees THAT jealousy!!! 😂
LaTocha is burning bridges with you all. I saw you all sing as a trio and have to say that she is extraneous (y'all killed it). If she keeps being this way, Xscape 3 may need to let her know that her services are no longer needed. Her energy is so negative and her husband is toxic. I don't blame you for not wanting him to handle Xscape business (he is shady grady).
I’m glad you explained it. It’s called Business 🙏🏽💕
Another thing in DJ Richey Sky looked up the record sales and it said SWV SOLD 25 MILLION AND XSCAPE SOLD 7 MILLION
Kandi is so tired of Tasha lol, Kandi SWV sold 3 million on 1 album y’all sold 3 million over 3 albums so let’s deep it. Just cause you been headlining it does not mean you should this time. SWV is a bigger group than Xcape  it’s just the FACTs your reality show fans are not a basis for selling tickets lol Kandi I love you but NO stop that
Thank you for explaining the business side so thoroughly.  I respect your years of experience and willingness to have the tough conversation.  Now I understand the passion behind Xscape headlining the tour, it's the right way to do business. I absolutely Love this show and your dynamic with everyone except Toscha, of course.  It would be great to see Timeka S. as a cast member on HOA ❤🎉
The real shade is those THREE not four mic stands in back of Kandi!! 🤣🤣
Rocky wants Tocha to make all that $$. He got a side kid to pay for, I heard.
THEY HAVE SOLD 25 MILLION RECORDS. THAT FLYER SAYS SPECIAL GUEST.
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾💯💯💯💯
😂😂😂OMG Kandi they scared the tf out of me too....
Yess speak on it
It is one show .
Tocha is stewing in jealousy. She can’t understand how everyone else having so much success that she has never had. She is so unhappy, it’s hard to watch her scenes. And Rocky imitating Ike Turner… he clearly doesn’t have a clue.
I'm sorry they gave you all hell! That green gress was UGLY and she looked like the Grinch!
Wait...1. Who in the world is out here saying Kandi can't sing? That's not true. 2. I love me some SWV, however the draw appeal on a tour would be Xscape...no shade at all. Egos dont equate to ticket sales. 3. LaTocha clearly had been saying how she was the star singer..however a different voice does not make you the star. 4. Tomika needs to continue her stance...$30,000.00 missing dollars with a child in college and more....where did her money go?
Call the tour xscaping swv
It was definitely touching with Tamika and her mother . Mother’s have a tendency to think they are always right even when they are wrong.
Now Kandi.....you know damn well that SWV performing on a few of dates of Y'ALLS TOUR is NOT the same thing as a collaborative tour. You tryin it.
Kandi the mere fact that you keep saying “back in the 90s” is disrespectful. You’re doubling down on your cockiness. Thanks for the receipts but SWV should not be opening up for Xscape.
Kandi, Bye!  I know you're not comparing 2018 to 2023. Stop it!
This was hilarious ❤
I'm confused as to why LaTocha's genius husband couldn't land her a deal in all these years while she hasn't been relevant??   But real talk, we have never wanted a solo project from Latocha... at least I haven't! LaTocha's shaky, trembling, nasaly voice fits best with the other voices of Xscape, she's a bit boring alone in my opinion, the four different voices together is what the fans want and love!!! Now, I love SWV as well but I always wanted Coko to do solo albums, her voice has always been crazy amazing and I wanted her to branch out to show more of it. Kandi was always my favorite and had the most solo artist appeal of the four, no matter how good big face LaTocha think she sings! She's not to be trusted ever again!!!
OK. Now that Kandi has broke down the reason for them headlining… I hate to admit it, but she’s right… I still love me some SWV!!
I understand what you are saying but y'all should still co headline. SWV is that group hands down!
Love Kandi - Facts Focused Period ❤
Hey Kandi how about you get kysha Moore on your show so she can speak on it., Because RB lying😁😁😁
Mama G is NOT THE 5TH MEMBER.  They are not children. Group business well eventually cross her ears BUT mama needs to mind her business so the group can handle theirs.
You spoke on it Kandi!!!! Keep your business mind, not everyone has one
KEMPIRE LOVE HIM!
I glad the group is moving on Kandi Tiny Tamika can do it🎤🎼🎹🥰
RIGHT THATS WHAT CONFUSES ME * WHY NOT MAKE THE GROUP COINS & THE SOLO COINS * I MEAN I THOUGHT I HEARD THE GROUP SAY THAT IT DOESNT BOTHER THEM !? CRAZY!🎤
One thing Ms Kandi will always do, is clarify some of the behind the scenes confusion 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 thank you Kandi
Kandi, I never blamed y'all for the green dress 😅 I knew it was her doing in the first place however, she did look beautiful 😂
Kandi your singing voice is not up to par for to be talking as bold as you were talking on tonight’s episode.
Kandi knows how to make her Money $$$$
And you say that y'all were going through turmoil doing traces of my lipstick.  you totally can't tell ,because I was going to college when that came out and I didn't skip one song. I was naked boys in and out the door room when I heard that album and played it every time
Right, Tasha could've been honest about her solo deal hell Kandi and Tiny  probably could've helped write songs for her
Shoutout to @Kempire for making an appearance in tonight’s “Speak on itttttt” (In my Kandi voice)🐘❤️✨🐘
Kandi SPEAK ON IT Okc loves Kandi 💜💜💜
Tonight’s episode was so good!!!
Kandi is so transparent here and I love it. I respect her business mind so much.
You're right Kandi yams... You love SWV and so do I...but the motto is..."It's never personal it's just business"... That's it That's all!! It's all love 💜💜💜💜💜💜
Kandi be getting to the money... an errrrrbody mad.😂
This show speaks for itself.  Xscape makes this show exciting. SWV is in the background.
Good on your for advocating for your group, Kandi! I want to become as business savvy as you. Many of us accept things we aren't comfortable with and then complain about them later. Good for you. Business is Business. You aren't there to make friends.
I thought it was understood in the meeting that it was one show for now hence why Taj said they should co-headline on big night Kandi is speaking from the perspective of a tour. Everyone in that meeting know a tour wasn’t going to happen. Lol
I Agree with Kandi that young woman acts like she just doesn’t want to be there and she is trying to make her sissy and the other ladies look like they are treating her badly
It sucks because if y'all could come on an agreement for both groups could make the same amount of money, it would be an awesome concert. It shouldn't matter who goes first and who goes last, it's the money
Kandi is totally right. Even though we love both groups, I grew up with both  groups singing their songs doing concerts in my room by myself. me personally, I will be going to see Escape. Only real song that I love from SWV this week
Like Kandi said SHE BE HERE OWN DAMN ENEMY!!! CHILE FUCK HER... LET HER GO FAIL "AGAIN" ROLL AS 3 AND BY ALL MEANS DONT TAKE HER BROKE ASS BACK... TELL ROCKY TO PIMP HER "LITERALLY " VERSES ON THE LOW! EITHER WAY LET HER STAY "OUT " YAUL DONT NEED HER.... SHE NEED YAUL!!! LEAVE HER WHERE SHE AT
I was watching this show because of SWV. They were the group I grew up on. Love Coko's voice.
Mom's was fake, seen it too many times
Im lovin Miss kandi's speak on it😊😊😊❤
LET ME JUST SAY I ABSOLUTELY * ADORE * KANDI * I BEEN LIKING HER SINCE SHE ARRIVED ON THE * SCENE * ATL HOUSEWIVES * WHEN SHE CHECKED THE OTHER HOUSEWIFE * TOLD HER TO STOP TALKING BEFORE SHE BLOW UP ON HER * !!? * FROM THERE SHE PRODUCED THOSE * WINNING RECEIPTS * I AM A * KANDI * GIRL * 🤗💃🌹🍷🤜🤛 BEEP BEEP HEYYY  * KANDI *
Kandi thanks for explaining why it’s not equal pay. Stand on your $ girl for escape. Love it!!!
Been, still going thru it with my mom, it's taking a toll on me where I don't wanna be here anymore, they will figure it out. I say they, cuz my daughters don't understand. I'd rather be gone
I didn’t know Escape had a 5 member 😮
Kandi has that unique voice like T-Boz from TLC that's why she led a lot of their hits and she's more commercial. If you go back  to Diana Ross and the Supremes, Diana wasn't the stronger singer, Florence Ballard was the stronger singer, Diana  was very nasal and also more commercial that's why it became what it was for their group, Latocha can sing, but she doesn't have that it factor and she may never get the success she's seeking because she has a husband that's geeking her up like she Diana Ross and she's not,  on top of not being honest with her band mate's, it doesn't seem like they don't want her to be successful, they just want her to keep it 💯... My opinion!!! Luvya Xscape & SWV . I send love health wealth abundance and prosperity 👸🏽👸🏽👸🏽👸🏽 👸🏽👸🏽👸🏽💛
I had to get my popcorn ready when I saw Kandi posted this episode! 😊👍👏💞
This is a co show not a Xscape show.
None of u have star power to grow solo!!! Reality is the only two of both groups that's balling no matter what is going on is Kandi and tiny the rest of them "gotta do the group shit" or just go somewhere and be quiet!!!!
Rocky Bivens is a predator!! He saw that Tocha had little to no self esteem and he preyed on that!! She was talking about how he approached her boyfriend at a rehearsal and that is when he started working on her!!
Ok I was like come on Kandi you tripping but when she explained it I got it, You can have your good person hat back....Kandi was scared at the end I rewinded it like 8 times😂😂
Keeping It Kute 💯  bout da business  wit Kandi... Thax for taking us to your world 🌎...Yes you did it again 👏... #BossNHerBag 💰⁉️
I love you Kandi ❤❤❤❤❤
Coko know damn well SWV didn’t sell 30 million records. They only got 17 million
I love xscape forever! Specially kandi's 1st album specifically her single JUST SO You KNoW!!! I love that song so much! I hope kandi will sing that song again 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Gurllll, I don't know why they don't listen to you Kandi,,,YOU are the epitome of business woman!!!!! If they were to be honest, they know you know your s#@!😊
Kandi is about business, period! Same thing that happened with that Boyz II Men issue. Find out how that billing/payment works! Everybody was ready to plan a show before discussing the most important part.
Kandi., can y'all please perform 'in the rain' on the upcoming Xscape shows. You and Tiny absoluety slayed on that song!
We need more than 6 episodes!! We need to see Tocha reap what she’s sown and realize her husband Rocky is the problem!!
It didn’t seem like the rest of Kandi’s group knew that she would be asking for top billing. They seemed as taken aback s SWV. Very ballsy…
Being supportive is letting the children know that they should have a Plan B because it's almost exactly as you said, our dream job may not work out so that's where Plan B comes into play. Plus they need to understand that there's upteen others out there also who are just as talented and hungry to become a known commodity.
I've never loved Kandi as much as I do now. Ive always been a fan but I feel like I've turned into a superfan with this show. Lol
They cut the part shown in the preview out of the show of Tamika talking to her mom.
Kempire yes I see you!
Kandi I love how u carry yourself I worked with a female Taurus for about 8 years she was so nice n classy u remind me of her yoll take care of home n get that money n have fun real big on family too ❤❤❤❤❤
And I never took her side w/ the dress i could just always tell she is EVIL and jealous her and her husband wanna eat your 🐱
😂🤣😂🤣 Tiny "If you had a azz to kiss"😂🤣😂🤣 takes me out
OK… Kandi, I don’t like how you threw Taj under the bus! That was a little housewives style.
Tamik's sister is the Devil.   She is the most evil women on T.V. at this point.  She is mean.
Ok Kandi but y'all should have still co-headlined the show. You were WRONG.
I love  how kandi shows love to the blogs ..I love kempire and bingeworthy ..I was ready for her to drop a recap for this episode.. supporting from fla❤
Congrats 🥳❤
I love SWV and friends are friends but business is business.
I love Kandi ❤❤
We need Mama Joyce and Aunt Bertha to let loose on Tocha and her mama lol.
"Where they do that at?"         Timeless & priceless... Kandi is a BOSS for a reason! She takes care of the BUISNESS & up front is the best time & way to set the tone!!! #TEAMKANDI 💗
That "...back in the 90's..."  Lol
Kandi is a good business person because escape is not that much better than SWV you guys are equally talented equally. Now I’m bigger than SWV same playing field.
Kandi gives all the tea . Whew Chile!
Do an xscape tour without any other acts...🤣
Kandi you have the advantage by being on the Housewives and Tiny being married to T.I. It’s not like you all had a lot of songs. I still prefer the Jones Girls Who Can I Run Too
Gotta love it Kandi!! You’ve been on top of it for so many year’s!! I’m proud of you and this journey!!👌🏽
Thanks for clarifying Kandi!
Kandi this was worth watching till the end ❤️
The thing about Kandi is she knows the business and would never be taken advantage of. The promoters would try to low ball Xscape if they lowered their rate to match SWV's which Kandi said their rate is 3x higher. Kandi also made sense about SWV's rate being lower in part because they over-saturated the market. It sounds like they need better management.
The editing of this video is hilarious! 😂😂😂
I love SWV, but they ain’t no headliners today. Nor are they selling out no shows. Coco and her 30 million records sold should be saying thank you to you and Tiny. Cause like Tosha her solo career was a bust too.
I would love to see you go LIVE with SWV instead of “Speaking On It” behind their back. Us ATLiens don’t do ish like that. And let’s be CLEAR, if y’all have more ticket sales why them record sells ain’t matching 👀 You don’t want to go OVERSEAS because y’all can’t 😂😂😂. Did y’all notice Kandi kept saying “in the 90’s” as if Xscape has sold more “to date.”
So you guys already headlined a show so why do you need to headline this one sometimes you have to share this is good for all of you
Honestly I don't know many SWV songs maybe 2 or 3 and that's not even all the lyrics. I know alllllllll of Xscape songs soooooo😩
I cried too with Tamika and her Mother having that conversation.
The forever businesswoman. #Boss chick #Boss moves # If getting the bag was a person.
Um jermaine we got????
It’s there 30th Anniversary. Kandi have a heart
Tocha should work on her solo and get to the bag..
Kandi is a proven winner!
I agree with you about the Tamika and her mom situation. It really broke my heart to see that. Love from a parent means SOOOO much to you. So for her mom to treat her like that. It feels like a form of betrayal.
She using this show for her on exposure she for self and seem plan. It’s been over 20 something yrs why so fast now? Bogus to me
Kandi, you are definitely a boss. I knew you break down the business part in speak on it.
We need Jermaine to speak on it
It doesn’t matter SWV is bigger however you guys should split the headline
No Kandi. It’s there Anniversary
Swv killed y’all on versus
I agree with being "Co Headliners"
👏🏾👏🏾🖤
Candy you always keep it real! Coco reminds me of LoTacha a little. She’s not a thief but    She has diva tendencies! Rah and the other girl always had better personalities. But she can sang though…🙂
#MAKEITMAKESENSE
I’m so glad this show exposing tasha evil side her and her husband are snakes in the grass untrustworthy but wanna make Gospel music lol now none of the Fans fw her ….. AND COKO uhh idk I don’t like her never have her energy be so weird OFF TO ME && she said 30Millionnn baby you only sold 11 RELAX weirdooooo & it seem like she in competition with Kandi and envy her tasha and COKO they got the personality of a ROCK whew this why i could never be in a girl group 😅😂😂😂😂
At the end of the day….it’s more than just about records. If that was the case then no artist would ever be broke. The world today is about popularity. Reality tv laid the foundations for these opportunities. Which really the credit should be for you and Tiny. The relationships you all have grown to have. That’s why we don’t always see all the artist from back in the day. Not none of these other people although they starting to get into it now. I feel like that deserves credit in these conversations.
I found it interesting that they said it had nothing to do with egos but then made comments coming from a place of ego I didn’t hear not one actual business point except them selling more but to your point that was years ago and they’ve been opening up for y’all everywhere else
Kandi, thank you for the breakdown and business aspect. Everybody get’s it when you break it down for us,because we aren’t in the business and don’t catch the minute aspects.
They want Tamika to never speak on it as long as they live ,, they want her to forget about it and move on
❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉😮😮😮😊😊😊
Great show Kandi. You kept it 💯. I agree with most of what you stated. I am all for Xscape headlining as that’s who I would pay to see. I do love SWV also but I prefer Xscape. Although SWV has sold slightly more than Xscape and has had a little more success with billboard, I feel Xscape has been more-in-demand over the year. Besides, Kandi and Tiny has multiple millions of followers compared to any of the other group members.
Congratulations...and all about the business yeessszzz
Thank you for sharing this info Kandi. I'm subscribing !!
Thx for the clarification. And it makes perfect sense from a business standpoint. Business is never ever personal it just isn’t.
I love Kandi and the way she explains everything. Love this show.
The facial expressions that Kandi is giving this episode is everything 😅😅😅😅😅
The receipt proves nothing, that was yalls tour...not something yall were doing together.
Kandi laugh🤣🤣
Gloria is a fake mother to Tameka ,, we know why they didn’t discuss the money in full details because Glo still doesn’t want to admit to knowing
31:00 hit it right on the nose
The shade about selling more in the 90s doesn't hold up because even in 2023 - SWV has over 3 million monthly listeners on Spotify while Xscape doesn't even have 1 million. So not only did their music perform better in the 90s, it's still performing better now in the streaming era.
What was the issue in increasing SWV’s fee to match yours? You all could have utilized the tv show to leverage their price increase. It didn’t have to mean that SWV opened for you all. It could’ve been handled and delivered in a different way. It would’ve been totally fine to say Xscape wasn’t going to lower your fee. Now, with that said you all have a wandering  group member. Undoubtedly, promoters would want to lower your fee for that reason. You mentioned in an interview it took the promoter Rocky threatened took take a chance on the three of you. Other promoters didn’t want to take that chance? The tables can turn at any point. As black women and with the advent of this new show it was only right to try and elevate their fee schedule to match yours. It’s totally fine to say, you all negotiate your fee independently. You all can call yourselves coheadliner, but we will be paid our standard fee and need to approve all promotion. 🤷🏿‍♂️
It sounds like you are disrespecting them Kandi but that’s what you do
What the H Kandi? Ego is evident all around with this show. I am totally disappointed. That was disrespect to the real fans that supported Xscape and SWV coming up “the culture”. You can’t discount that SWV had a reality show. Even though I like Tiny, her recent negative narrative isn’t good. We all know that you are on RHOA and leading financially maybe, but d**n, that was a slap in the face to SWV and fans. Especially when You said yourself that y’all management wasn’t doing anything and SWV brought this opportunity. Think about it. You could have beeeen doing a tour using rhoa clout, but You chose not to. Black folks always act like crabs. Ridiculous
My panties were in a bunch a little lol but I appreciated Kandi taking time to explain it to me, I am clearly unaware of the business side lol
If it’s a tour Xscape has to headline if it’s one show then co headline
Singing is subpar, but business acumen is on 1000!
Maybe you should just go your separate ways
SWV has a big following in California bigger than Xscape.
SWV , just a little advice . This juice may not be worth the squeeze. Just do your own thing..... I think Xscape comes with too much drama in too many ways, and it may not be worth the trouble, even with the prospect of additional profits....
Kandi’s receipts from last week wasn’t clarifications because Kandi sang on most of the songs as lead proves that there’s a possibility that she might had a romantic relationship with Jermaine Dupri. Where’s the timeline for that rumor. Now, I’m gonna go listen and read all 3 albums for those voices.   Secondly, Kandi likes to throw rocks and hide her hands. I’ll explain later when the season ends.   Thirdly, Latocha and Kandi are both poison to the group.  I’ll be back to leave comments.
Kandi be coming through with the receipts. 😂 👏🏽 👏🏽
Love you kandi❤
Loveeeeee you Kandi ❤
Kandi with the lotto took me out. Love her.
Kandi let  her a that wig go!
Love your song
I wonder if Tocha and her husband correlates her solo career flopping with the deception and grease ball type of tactics behind the scenes…
I mean, I can understand swvs frustration. Yes, they've been opening act before, but that was on an entirely separate tour. Yall are on a TV show as equals, their name is even listed first on the show only to be hit with opening act, that's rude af
Love you, Kandi! 😂
Now it be excape and swv because Kandi is on Bravo tv show it like she bring the bag and tiny also been on TV show and have not heard from swv in long time am just saying
Music business education 101, thanks Kandi, I  truly didn't know it went that way.
Am black my son was born 1995 and I wish my son would act like Kandi and tameka would my son express himself to the fullest I tap out with him I let him win doesn’t mean heirs right but I got job 😂
Yes I was totally emotional with Tamika and Mom scene. I haven't had that situation but I was so triggered and crying. Phew....it was way too much. To hear y'all stories, thank all of you for opening up your lives. People can be cruel and talk any kind of way on your lives but I hope this show blesses all of you way more than y'all put out and sacrificed. I pray it's more than worth it, rehashing hurts and pains.
❤❤❤
Yes Kandi I understand business is business
I’m glad Kandi had the receipts on that SVW drama.
For that one night only both groups should co headline!!! Swv is not going to be touring with xscape.
Learning so much.
RECEIPTS! 🗣🗣🗣🗣🧾
Kandie, Escape needs to wish LaTocha the best on her solo career,  get another member or become a group of three and go on tour with SWV. New Edition did it when they fired Bobby Brown, Van Halen did it when they fired David Lee Roth. I don't understand why the group thinks they need her so bad, cause you don't need nobody that you got to beg to cooperate...tell her goodbye get the new manager you lady's want and move successfully forward in 2023!!!
I'm not entertainment business person but I get it because if the Xscape comes out 1st or 2nd  the  concert would be over. they forget the big picture of the tour and concerts the venues  have to get paid all the other people avenues, and revenues have to get paid..💯 🍑🍑🍑 and that just what it is.. and right now we shouldn't be traveling overseas there is a warning restriction for traveling abroad.
When I say I LOVE that Kandi goes back and explains everything after each episode! And Blaze has Kandi’s entire face … so pretty!
But SWV had more hit’s than Xscape just saying no shade
Btw the editing for Speak On It is Top Tier❤️💯
All parents are not like that
I knew you were gonna break the record sale thing down lol. I remember when I saw the trailer for the show, I went and did some research bc I didn't know SWV sold 30 million records. And like you I couldn't find where they got that number from. But then I was like they have more access to this type of stuff so I'll let it go.   Then I had to go back and forth a few times with some commenters. I said I like both groups but I don't see 30 million and even if it is true, Xscape has been selling out on their tours. I said Xscape are entertainers meaning y'all do more than just sing. And SWV don't do all that. Not that they have to. Anyway, I like both groups but I had to put the facts out there, too.🤭
I love you girl! U are smart and about your business hence why u are where u are at in life. Inspiration for women around the world!
Speak on it Kandi, God bless the prayer person.  God bless your crew for stay and sticking by your side.❤
Love you @Kandi I never miss an episode of “Speak On It!” 💜
Kandi! You are a REAL ONE!
I Came To Blaze Saturday And Missed You Friday. I’m Mad 😐
Kick Tocha too whatever Rocky puts her in and hold it down on your own. Meaning one monkey don’t stop no shows.
Team Kandi, I love you ❤ I'm a super fan
New shirt: Imma Headliner - You an Opening Act 😂
This show is ruining all of their friendships with SWV and their own group.
Is Coco realistic with her son wanting to be a singer?  He is a gay black man.  It's going to be nearly impossible for him to have a career as a successful singer.
I mean LOOK at this point if Latocha and Coko wanna be the David Ruffins of everything that's all they had to say😂😂😂 them 2 there laaaawd
🗣🗣NOW HOLD ON ONE DAMN MINUTE! MAMA JOYCE IS THE 5TH MEMBER OF XSCAPE! LETS BE CLEAR! 😂
I LOVE KANDI.... SHE'S REAL, RAW & YOU CAN'T NEVER SAY YOU CAUGHT HER IN A PURPOSEFUL LIE!!!! Ya can't beat that❤❤❤❤👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Some of these folks had trouble getting their GED. There's no rationale with them. Some of us know and understand what you are saying. But because you can have a polar disposition, it makes some people lose the lil bit of common sense that they do have. They saw SWV go overseas to do a concert with a rich man and that's enough for them 😂.   They going to make you pulled your hair out trying to explain to them about current ticket sales with different acts. Just laugh it off 😂.
I definitely teared up with Tamika and her mom's scene 😢
I attended the OKC show!!! It was amazing!!!
Kandi isn't as successful as she is for nothing. I love both groups, but I have to agree with Kandi when looking at it from a business side. If both had a concert..same date, same time; I would purchase a ticket and roll with XSCAPE, but to each it's own opinion. Oan: Tiny's laugh and "oh hell no" will go down in history..I laugh every time I hear it.
Okayyyyy shout out to my boy Kempire!!!! Loved seeing his clip in this episode of Speak on it!
I’m glad this show is exposing people for who they really are. Coco and tocha are fake , wasnt coco about God now she’s on here cussing and saying certain things?
I AGREE WITH PORCHA….THAT WOMAN WAS RUDE…HER VOICE AND FACE SPOKE VOLUMES OF RUDENESS.  SIMONS EXWIFE HAD A FULL BABY BEAUTIFUL EMMA BEFORE A FULL YEAR WAS OVER!!!
Chile I need more than 6 episodes that’s what I know . This show is good!
Kandi is a phenomenal business woman
The fact that Tocha is so shady and she now sings gospel as a solo artist...is crazy.
So basically latocha and coco used the fame of kandi and tiny to be something again?
Just because you don't intend to be disrespectful, doesn't mean you aren't being disrespectful
Kandi please release that song !!! 💃🏾🕺🏿🪩
Xscape is the bigger draw.
Mom there are only four members that don’t include you. That is unless you’re taking the monster you created place,which in and of itself is a hell no, the costumes along make you excluded. Please get out of the business you are not being paid from. I would have set fire to mom. Yes we have forgotten and she should also know, that OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN said a PARENT is not supposed to provoke their child to anger. And she doing it riding a lie. Mom stop taking out your frustrations on Tomika, she is not her dad, she just looks like him. Let her ass fall to hell by herself. We fell in love with Xscape not Tocha on a bitter tour.
I'm sorry kandi but the headliner topic was giving poor. Why can't people lift eachother up when they're already doing well and successful? Does it really matter who's "better". You're both amazing and there is room for both to have headliner status. Especially all the time xscape waste on drama should reflect in their pay. Just sayin 🤷
But who cares let her go solo and y’all tour as 3 , let Tamika sing her parts. Why is that hard
Bae Baeeeeee Don Juan definitely be on his shit! He comes with allllllllllll the damn receipts❤❤❤❤. Kandi has that knowledge of the business🎉🎉🎉🎉 and I take my hat off for that! ❤❤❤
The chat was crazy and very telling that ppl don't understand biz. They want Xscape to take a lower pay just to say they co-headline with SWV. Biz is a numbers game and I'm not talking records. Kandi was saying they get paid more per show than SWV. If they co-headline they would be agreeing to a lower rate per show.
Kandi is so competitive & money hungry! It’s ONE show! I don’t get it
Kandi I love you but girl it’s giving co headline! SWV birthed y’all and tocha don’t deserve top billing…
I know that's right Kandii haters need to apologize 😂
Keep being you Kandi!!
KANDI THE YOUNGER FANS DON'T KNOW THAT THERE WERE HEARING YOUR VOICE THOUGH EVERY SONG, YOUR VOICE IS  XSCAPE SOUND, SO SOME PEOPLE WERE TO YOUNG AND NEVER HERD YOU SOLO RECORDS , SO MOST OF THEINTERNET FANS  NOW ARE THE NEW GENERATION. NEXT SO ALL THEY KNOW IS  HWOA.AND THE OLD LADY GANG FANS, .HONEY IF THEY LISTEN TO YOUR RECORDS  WATCH OLD VIDEO S OF YALL THEY WOULD BE LIKY😱
Kandi your voice is beautiful and it gives me goosebumps!! But, I don’t want or mean to be messy but, what’s up with the 3-mics in the background 🤷🏽‍♀️ IJS? That should be permanent, she’s dead weight and holding you all back.
Kandi is only coming from the business expect. Love that she straight shoots the real talk. Boss move...love her or not, i do !❤ thx for Speak On It.
Kandi Is Just A Business Person First, And I Understand.
Don't play with my girl Kandi
Maybe tocha has mental issues?
Interview coach Rocky
Some people do get in their own way!
Idc who goes first WEAK is #1
Kandi love a good apology chile. Lol she want you to retract the lies or accusations publicly and loud ‼️
To ME! It seems that Kandi and Tiny KNOW more business savvy than the rest. No Shade! ❤ They LEARNED and Graduated on THE HUSTLE!!😘
I LOVE YOU KANDI!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
U gotta add Tiny laughing at your facial expressions from episode 2.
Your confessional looks are 😍😍😍😍
Film without her next season
I think this was all a plan for toscha and rocky. Xscape is the stepping stone to her solo career. Before y’all got back together , why they ain’t shop a deal then? She needed the publicity of xscape to get back in the limelight . Honestly, can’t support a gospel artist that is shady like that.
If the reenactment at 23 minutes and 40 seconds for me lol😂😂😂
I ❤️❤️❤️❤️Kandi the Business Woman
When is somebody gone tell LaTocha we don’t wanna hear her solo.. how many times is she gonna fail at this attempt.. I’m sick of it.. and don’t blame Kandi when it flop this time 🙄
I completely understand what Kandi was explaining
He is hungry for fame..I hope he walls by faith and not by sight
Kandi won on Masked Singer for a reason and KILLED each and every song. She can sing and I love her voice. The texture of her voice IS Xscape’s sound. I don’t care what anybody says.
It's amazing how Kandi breaks a situation down, thoroughly, and people still can't comprehend what she's saying.   I just can't...
I can relate to Tamika I've been their and being the black sheep sucks. Sending prayers and love her way 🙏🏿❤
Tameka and her mother made me cry. I’m a mother I felt Tameka pain. I really believed they stole her $.
Hey Ms Kandi let me just say that Tameka mother mentioned that she is the 5th member of your group exscape now if it wasn't for the ( moms )  of your group members of exscape it wouldn't be a group period and let no weapons shall prosper formed against you all the time  and the name of Jesus Amen God bless your fan Ms Robin Brown 🙏🤲❤
The money is y'all business but far as a fan....I come to see both groups EQUALLY
I can definitely relate to Tamika🥹🥹
Co headline please , work together
I would love to see Tocha and Coko have a sitdown see how that conversation go lol.
18:15 Tocha is ENVIOUS of Kandi. She was so used to hearing that she had the best voice in the group all the time that she's confused, bitter, and ENVIOUS that Kandi superceded without the group, and she did not. She's had 20yrs now to establish herself as a solo artist, and she has not successfully done that.
Tiny with her phone laughing in them confessionals😂😂😂😂 who ever editing that in the speak on it yessss
I just watched the episode live with Kempire 🐘 it was a  good epsodie. Now we here to listen to your recap.
Use your heart and not your eyes or you'll be my little secret 😜
4songs each,, release  as a collective as Xscape ,(alumb) COME XSCAPE WITH US , give us what we want and at the same time it's like a solo project for all of y'all, bring in JD and full circle the legacy release one video each and get that 💰,, and I want my cut lol,,seriously give us what we want, and I got songs for All y'all ,,
Always transparent. Totally understood… that’s why you been in the music game in all facets this long!! You understand the bottom line point blank period!!! Also I absolutely love this song  on here🔥 congratulations 🎉🎈🍾🎊!!!
Coko is the better singer of all of you Kandi…  I promise you
Ok so you saw the episode early, did your video...and then went to karoke
I said the same thing Kandi. I said Xscape is selling out on tours. I don't recall SWV doing that, maybe overseas, maybe.
If I were a label, I wouldn’t do business with Tocha. Look how she moves. She shows her hand every time. Dummy!
Swv should’ve been requiring this stuff before ….
Tamika mom most definitely have favortism
Kandi you was extra in the meeting, it’s one show it should be co-head lining
Kandi spoke the real ❤❤
After listening to Kandi talking about the business, I totally understand now, and I totally agree. Thank you because I love both groups, but I really relate to Xscape songs more.👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Kandi is definitely about the business!   She explained this well!
Love you Kandi Girl and appreciate the followups!
Great Episode 🎉 Kempire is awesome 👑 🐘
Man this was a lot to take in. I wish everyone could get along.
Let's talk about the fact that you needed SWV, BBD, Tamar and Monica on your tour to help you sell out them arenas!
Thank you for breaking the BUSINESS down for us Kandi. That’s why you are a boss. 💪🏾
I get it now...The mama is holding onto decades worth of hurt from the daddy leaving and struggling. Tocha is holding onto decades' worth of hurt from struggling to go solo, blaming everyone. Like mother, like daughter.
Didn’t just one of SWV song’s (weak) sell the same amount all three of y’all albums sold combined? Their first album sold the same thing with their second going platinum and a gold remix album and their last album going gold. Y’all might have had consecutive platinums but they did those numbers with just one album! Sorry but you guys “hits” don’t hold a candle to SWV’s catalog 🤷🏽‍♀️
Oh Kandi can sang hunni and Latocha we felt sorry she was chubby back then she lost the weight and know she's feeling herself and that's not good Kandi is really showing her real self at all times on every platform and if you don't have haters you ain't poppin Kandi
Dammmmm Kandi dropped alllll the receipts 😂😂😂😂
Kandi is an Amazing Singer! Anybody who says she can’t sing? Definitely don’t know what they’re talking about and they should keep their negative opinions to themselves. Stop trying to bring someone down or dim their light! Because you’re lacking in some sort of way! ❤
Latocha plays the victim a lot she’s has this victim mentality
They must be watching cause Co Co and Taj just went live
Girl I can't wait until you (if you decide to rather) address this foolishness that Tamar is trying to come at you with. She is ALWAYS inserting herself into things that have absolutely nothing to do with her then plays victim. One thing we know about Kandi: she is not a liar. So if you address her, we know it's going to be the TRUTH!
Love me some Kandi. You get what it is, how it is,how it going. The whole truth nothing but the truth.
Ooooh kempire shady 😂😂🤣😂🤣
Entitled ass mother!
THIS is the Kandi I love. THIS is a boss speaking. It frustrates me so much to see her in situations where she's being railroaded, whether it's her mama or a housewife. Boss up, Kandi! I love it. Love. It.
Yes, Coko and Latocha are one in the same! They both think that they're the nucleus of the group!!! The reality is that they both need to humble themselves because neither of their solo careers took off to make them a household name! JMO The scene with Tamika and her mother was heartbreaking, she looked like that little girl that just wants her mother to love her!!! JMO😢 The business side needed to be addressed and I'm glad that you had the courage to say something! This is why so many people get taken advantage of because we don't advocate for ourselves!!! Kudos to you Kandi this is why I love you!  BTW, congratulations on getting your name cleared after all of these years!!!❤❤
Kandi brings all the Receipts!!! Thanks for explaining everything ❣️❣️❣️
And Mrs. Tucker! I had my entire life FROM HOUSTON!!!❤❤❤❤❤
When is your song coming out?? AyeAye🎶 @kandi
I still think y’all should co headline
I am guessing y’all not touring with swv lol Now or in the future lol
Kandi mama, yes all three of Xscape's albums went platinum but you fail to realize that SWV's first two albums outsold your entire discography. Their first album sold 3 million copies, their second sold 1 million
Thank you for the business aspect of this. Makes sense now
Tocha don't seem to have the ability to handle success or the potential for success very well. Why turn on the group & especially your sister, just because you got a deal elsewhere. Be a woman and let everyone know what's up and let the chips fall where they may. The divatude is unnecessary. Grow up.
Tocha and Rocky need to give Tamika around $75,000 in to you know his mistress just came forward. Things are getting messy because of their karma Tamika such a sweet lady. She don’t deserve none of that. I know Latasha is being manipulated but she’s a grown woman and she excepts it and goes along with it so she knows better she supposed to be a woman of God, but doing her sister like this and creating drama within the ladies so evil at the end of the day who wants to keep saying someone tried to ruin your career kandi has been over backwards, trying to let y’all make a bag and you keep disrespecting her and playing her! Mona sky is messy that’s why she’s managing Latasha right now lol candy y’all need to stay away from her. She ain’t nothing but trouble she don’t care about nobody she just wants yawls money and clout.bb
put "only for you" on YouTube!! please
Kandi is the truth!!😂😂
Kandi that song only you is so fire!!!! Please release it!!!!! I love it a lot!

I love this show! Tamika and her mom scene had me boohoo crying. I love seeing SWV and their families. This honestly is one of Bravo best shows ❤️❤️
Girl you can sang Fr ❤❤❤
I’m more shocked that Xscape headlining over New Edition
Kandi is the receipt queen ❤😂
Caught the last 10 minutes re-watching now. My notification didn't go off😔
This is why Kandi stay blessed
Kandi Ace is ace in his own right 👍 I'm proud of your son and the things he is going to achieve and accomplish in his life with Jehovah's blessings and with his parents guidance 😅😅
Regardless, I will always love you Kandi girl! A fan for life!
U rite..it makes alot of sense 😂 I seen yall in Nashville couple yrs bc a great show.!!.Tamer/ an Monica !!
I’m really enjoying the show! I hope you all Renee for another season!
I need y’all to stop, think and like the video!🤷🏽‍♀️
I am feeling the song yessssd
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Speak on itttttt 🎉
Love you Kandi ❤
This tour ain't happening
Bye Mrs Kandi😊😊😊
Swv’s tickets sales were very low last year. When Swv came to Detroit to perform ticket master we’re basically given away tickets. The venue was not full.
Kandi is such a control freak. Don't cover her eyes no mo'! 😂 congratulations on 600k
Congratulations Kandi
❤❤❤❤❤❤
😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂
❤❤❤
Kandi is on point about handling your business in that music industry! You can't let it eat you alive and have nothing to show at the end!💯
We love you Mrs Kandi.
I’m with you Knadi❤❤ and listen keep shining like the star you are😘😘😘😘
I love me some Kandi; handle your business Pooh ❤
Kandi, you can manage me or my business any day. It was BUSINESS and i agree with what Kandi said. PERIODT
Business is business- Timing is everything-   Stay humbled Kandi
Oh I know the tv show is not telling us the whole story and they probably leave out very important parts😂
Ok Kandi's explanation helps see their perspective with headlining.
Kandi is the only one who did something with her success !!! She is very business savvy
They gonna Be Hot Tonight!! 40:13 😂
Co-opening is best ! Cause SWV Is great !
Kandi will level you up for real.
Being a Boss isn’t about feelings!
Does Kandi and Tiny get more than the Scotts.
She’s in competition with kandi
“Talk to me about what’s NOW!!.. ok?!” 😂😂
Yeah you should know Kandi cuz you can’t do nothing with yo  momma.
But how will co headlining hurt you guys?
😂😂😂😂 36:33
I came to see Kandi. Honestly I thought SWV was En Vogue 😂
Kandi is successful is because she is smart in business!! I like that
Xscape sold over 9 million records and SWV over 25 million both worldwide..so Kandi really need to stop saying they sold only a few million less. Its not true..
I always see SWV open for NE and BBD. YOU AINT NEVA LIE!
Damn Kandi, I love your business savviness, you are awesome !!!!❤
I agree with you kandi…. Business is Business and I don’t fault you at all for being about your money and your Business
Kandi be having those receipts ❤
🐘🐘🐘 Kempire is the best!!!
yeah saw the episode Kandi youre still wrong. In what world would SWV not be a co headliner in modern times. You said it yourself, yall look up to them theyre your big sisters.. Yall looked to them for inspiration when yall first came out.. Why would they ever be an opening act for yall? of Course yall should co headline. past festivals and all that dont matter.. theyre talking about the show happening NOW. and NOW yall need to co headline. its not rocket science. edited to add... you say it snot cocky but yet youre talking about their fan base.. they've been out LONGER than you and are STILL here.. they obviously have the fan base. you dont wanna talk about their international sales? why? not counting that fan base? you know ppl travel to different places for shows right? its coming off cocky.
Love you ladies!!❤❤
Bring the receipts Babyyy!
That was an XSCAPE tour tho lol
Kandi your daughter could be an entertainment lawyer. Lord knows WE BP need legit one's in the music industry. So many of our black artists have been ripped off.
There seems to be some confusion, I saw the Xscape tour promo. It says SWV were special guests for y’all along with BBV. I’m not sure if that’s the same as “opened”. SWV is in the top 10 selling female groups of all time according to the RIAA. Also, they have more Spotify monthly listeners  even with y’all having more social media followers as Tiny said.
It says xscape and friends. It’s not worded opening act
She needs y’all to get a solo deal or she would have been had one
Kandi say I got receipts 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kandi is funny. She went back & looked for those SWV 30mill record sales. 😂😂
Kandi it doesn’t matter who sold more albums!
TOCHA Would not be doing ANYTHING with XSCAPE if her solo career was booming like XSCAPE career is😒
Hi Kandi, I'm really enjoying the show.  I am asking you to try to get the "Old Ladies Gang" back and/or try to get it on OWN or BET.  Kandi, I understand your part in the Business side.  I am wondering if you will come up with a shirt or a hat "I have to pray on it".  I think that is what we all need to do, to tell you the truth.
I am so so so happy for you shutdown that girl
The episode was really good but it’s so crazy that the problem child is dragging this out for her solo project. I love Kandi she keeps it real and she produces receipts
What about the movie Kandi?! Lol
Kandi I’m going to always believe you first cause you have no reason to lie about any of it❤❤
She’s brainwashed, her husband needs her to succeed any means necessary to take care his outside skittles clearly he likes all flavors!!
I think Kandi was doing too much...co head lining for one show is not that big of a deal...that competitiveness is sometimes a good thing but this time very unnecessary You doing too much...you co headlining a reality show....
I wonder if mother did that for the camera or is she actually putting forth an effort to change.
Every time y’all have a meeting Tasha face tore up so my thing is if you don’t want to be in the group no more just leave and let the rest of the group carry on with business.
It’s her husband we seen when he was whispering in her ear 👂🏾
Let her go, you’ll are better without the BS ..Her and her husband are using you’ll for clout..It’s called envy and jealousy..She needs to stop playing with GOD!!!!
Ok Kandi did you ask about yall headlining just for drama? Cause you know Coco is gonna react? Otherwise that was just disrespectful. SWV paved the way for yall and was more popular.
Tocha brings the negative energy
Tocha needs Xscape. Xacape can do just fine without her. It's a lot harder being a solo artist.
Y’all should be co headlining
Kandi’s laugh is contagious 😂😂😂
Did I miss something like an episode???🤔
I love you kandi 😂cause you keep it real. As far as Tasha goes just from what I can see it looks to be a jealousy issue concerning you. You made it. You are the star ⭐️ that you are and we all love you and she’s not good with that. I love Tiny because she try to stay positive about all of it. Until she lets the bad feelings go she won’t be happy solo album or not.
Latchoa is her own worst enemy!!
Kandi you go straight to it. What the money doing??? Huh huh huh😊😊😊😊
Did y’all hear Rocky call Tocha Anna Mae? He straight up compared himself to Ike. WTAF?
Kandi yes come on Speak On! I love you Queen you have always kept it real and thank you! #TeamKandi!  Kandi that’s why I love your team they are going to be on top of things. They all got your back Kandi. Yes Don Juan! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
KEMPIRE ❤
Ok.  When the talk show coming.  You know the one that's gonna be on TV networks "WORLD WIDE" ??? 😊
Touching but you ain’t ready to split the billing evenly?? Ok girl…
Good for her getting a 9-5. Because she stayed humble, God came thru for her. 👏🏾 Leelee
Lelee I love her.❤❤❤
Kandi this show is everything!
The song that was playing behind them. That part 😢
Protocol 😅 1) Like the video on the way “in” 👍🏿  2) Leave a comment on the way “out”
Love you Kandi aka DabossK
According to the RIAA, SWV has sold over 11.5 million albums throughout their time as a group. However, the group claims to have sold 30 million records, although proof of this figure hasn't been provided.  As for Xscape, per the RIAA, they have sold 9 million albums.
Mom still came in wrong- I believe Tamika hit the nail on the head.  Mom appears to still be very angry about her husband leaving -and sees her ex husband when she looks at her.
To be real Tocha husband always in y’all business and hyping her head up like she always above y’all!!🙄🙄💯
Hey Kandi, hey chat
I was holding back tears with Tamika and her mom. It hurt my feelings listening to her mom yell at her and come down on her so bad in her house too. Smh
Hey Kandi, you look GORGEOUS ❤️!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Real fans watch the previews and the real episode and the actual speak on it!!🤩🤩🔒
