back when hi3 cared about its story
I have came here After 3.2 HSR Amphoreus
爱莉希雅要来星穹铁道了
❤
Welcome back guys
Back when the Elysium realm and the Flamechasers were being revealed, I was highly skeptical because I kept thinking 'How are these the warriors to who fought at the end of the old world?' - and then the story unfolded we learned that was the whole point. They all weren't meant to be heroes in the slightest, the fact was they were all that was left. Kudos to the developers for greatly leaning into that.   As Elysia herself narrates 'They were never perfect heroes, they were just the ones who showed up at that place and time.'
Is the background track available separately? T_T

Is the full ting tomorrow?
Wow
ELYSIA STUFF
Which patch she's coming?
I don’t know why y’all simping for Ely since… 1. Instead of taking charge as the de facto leader, especially as its highest executive office she let a super powered puppet, his unethical cocky girlfriend, a psychopath cocky scientist, his holier than thou best friend (like bruh, killed millions just to make some medicine for said gf), make the shots while fooling around 24/7 instead of confronting these issues when they popped up. 2. She betrayed the group she created. She met the will of honkai and gets Sakura and her sister killed, while letting APONIA HELP. Things always go badly when clairvoyance is involved w/ honkai. Because of this decision, the remainder of humanity in their 3 ‘sanctuaries’ gets nuked by their own nukes. 3. By getting herself killed (assisted suicide) she, who has Vipralopa (strongest) class honkai gene of Shiva and knowing her own Herscherr status never shows up at the last boss fight. When they needed her the most, she vanished. 4. Like Eden and Aponia, she is literally loitering in their base. She bugs/annoy everyone because she is BORED instead of working. 5. She uses a bow as her weapon, and not her divine key (which is the Insta kill weapon Abyss Flower, where Kevin’s SMASH is a literal nuke). In fact her contribution in combat and so on are almost non-existent other than recruiting members. 6. It is a coin toss whether this girl had rage quit her life or not. 7. She starts a game of among us 50,000 years later after the first one. This suggest she is a sadist too.
After watching Evangelion, I can see the many similarities between the two
0:36 Immaculate 😎
0:13 Dot dot part is awesome.
Madoka?
I love the blend of 2d and 3d animation
it's like an addiction. im watching it everyday.
I won't be surprised if Eden va will be the one to sing in this animation
please don't be depressing
this masterpiece story coming to an end, I'll cherish those moments once again, and be ready to say farewell once again
Alot of this seems like cell animation
What the heck is happening!?
6 millions and it's only the preview
Ягей
Wow
LABY?
Really wish a series based on otto apocalypse perspective.... he is a really good MC on his own story and truly an embodiment of you either die as a hero or live long enough to see yourself as a villain. Fucking hate that anime nowadays just a bunch of isekai with op MC and power of friendship

PLEASE Mihoyo find a way to let future generations PLAY this whole experience in the distant future. What this game makes us feel is unlike any game around and it would be a HUGE loss if the world doesnt get to play and control the Valkyries with their wondeful chapters...
No sé porque familia una personajes en una chica mágica 🤔
how long is the release date?
ボイスよりBGMのほうが大きいってどうなってんだ 中国の常識ってずれてるわ
Prepare for the feels, fellow Captains.  *brings out tissue box*
Wish it Came to console or did collab with Genshin to bring Them into The Genshin world
Eden is now very happy to see Elysia
原神と比べてかっこいい
Maybe i should download honkai
I don't know lick about the Honkai storyline. But these teasers be beautiful.
just don't ruin it for this chapter, kay? it'll be unfortunate to have gorgeous Elysia if the story just like. . . you know what I mean 😏
HOLY SHITTTT
Ngl the part where ely says they were the only ones to show up that place and time gave me goose bumps
I have one single question. ELYSIA appear in 26th chapter and now her story come to end. What happens in this 5 chapter's that make all or most Honkai communities became her simps? Her story is so good or only her appearance make me feel like you guys come from genshin?
Omg

Elysia voice just so smooth!!!!!! Erennnnnn!!!!
DDDDDUUUUDDDDEEEEEEEEE, i'm not even a HI3 player and i have watched it 10 times already, HELP!!
"The story of Elysian Realm is such a simple on"  Me: What?! I'm still confused what really happened after all those chapters..is it really simple?
MiHoYo wants to break my heart again
My beloved....let me keep this eternal stories, let me show the world how beautiful, how kind, how lovely you are. The future and the wishes you made..will...definitely become true !
Okay so when is the animated short dropping though
I wonder how many of us are playing Honkai because we played Genshin first lol.   One day I was like hey Hoyoverse got another game I never heard about! They're made by the same company so sure it would also be a high quality game. Well...I mean...I was right but...(sobs)...I want my Himeko back :(

I have been watching this preview for a while now and is it just me or did someone else get pissed when HoC beat up Elysia to that extent we see in the preview on the beginning?

🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
Wtf 2,8M views for a trailer in a day ?
"theres a new honkai impact short coming out" "how exited are you?" "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
Зачем было убирать русские субтитры?
I recently started playing Honkai because of Elysia...then was sad because she's dead😮‍💨
Cool, CCP Very Cool
Why is this giving me heavy Cytus II vibes
the music at 0:23 🥶
Can´t wait to see the entire masterpiece
Love it
Ely is so damn gorgeous.
2.7 mil in 1 day wtf
Honestly this beautiful animation, even tho I am not a "fan" of Elysia, makes me want to spend money for Herrscher of Human Ego. Just to show Hoyo how much I appreciate them and their beautiful animations
Her voice holly shit
Elysia has become more and more my favorite character in hoyoverse. She looks stunning and is a sweetheart too in her herrscher form
We finally get to see miss pink elf animated, and it’s godly. Thank you Mihoyo for putting such effort into this game
Is it only me 00:12 looks a bit like Alpha!!
Honkai hmm
Ayo male when?
Because of you, we're broke
Anjay game berbie ☝️☝️😅
Elyyyy
Of all of hoyoverse's work in HI3 id say ER and the flame chasers is superb! Aside from the weekly extra crystals 😂 I love how the story progress and how each characters was introduced, not only 1 side but even their other flaws and comedy gimmicks as well, in a way they felt more human in a realistic point of view.  But what tied them all together was ellie. At first i had my doubts on her the first time she was introduced, too friendly and mysterious, in which most clichés story, such characters often depicted as a back stabber in the end by most story writing.  Then as we progress at mobius's chapter some of the flame chasers kept saying she was a traitor, in which had made me more on guard about her. Now as we are almost at the conclusion where most are almost unraveled, i fell in love with her character (elysia) even more, though with the same degree of guilt as i misjudged her at first (although i hope hoyoverse wouldn't pull a twist within another twist) if you know what i mean.  For me, if i ever befriend her, shes that kind of person who is even-tempered, would crack or join a light dirty jokes and have good laughs about it, or would be so patient to quell a heated argument, as she is so ever considerate of kalpas, she would truly make a good friend.  Under her cheeky mischievous nature, lies a very mature and considerate lady. As she indeed became the very core of the flame chasers, i laughed with disbelief when she said she was the head of the flame chasers at first, but then now i realize how well she did going lengths to look after her companions.  Again for me this was the most brilliant plot ever conceived by hoyoverse for HI3 up to date, and the way those very questions ellie threw at mei, (once you leave for a normal life, you will realize that everything happened here is little more than a virtual story) which rocked my very core. indeed we're almost at the end (of ER) and looking back i really did enjoy this chapter, because in mei's perspective i began to feel the weight of that bittersweet farewell, in which once again hoyoverse did a good job  I mean you can even feel it in the elysian everlasting's BGM  If you ever reached this part i wanna thank you for reading till the end, also to hoyoverse for such a wonderful story, hoping for more ground breaking plots and games to come!
Start with Her, Ends with Her. Such a Markable Storyline
I am gonna go back to Honkai impact
Yes its been long since chapter 28 for an animation
Just launch an anime studio already.
0:16
Please release the background music in the future. I love it. It starts off a bit playful and light, rolls into Elysia's theme, and gradually builds into the tension.
This animation is giving me a Schwi vs Jibril(No Game No Life) kind of vibe.
Me who saved resources for psy Elysia: hak im in danger
Why do I suddenly feel like I'm gonna cry when this animation finally comes out. Elyyyyyyyy! 😭
💖
ELYSIAAAAAAAJJDBD
Hope they add scenes from the past for closure.. scne of each of the FC individuals going to their respective place/future in that final event of P.E specifically the event that took place between & after their retreat in the last fight of HoE & to the cryo sleep like.. a scene of whats going on on their minds, what are they feeling in that moment, where are they when it all ends, & How most of them died.. like a short glimpse of Su talking to Dr.mei, Hua alone with prometheus, Eden just accepting her death, & Griseo in the Ark etc...  just some flashback and vague-ish glimpse of their last moments for dramatical and emotional effects with the new music.
Personally, I like Elysia’s cn voice more, but I like HoC jp voice~🥰 But I like all cn and jp voice~><
What is Elysia the Herrscher of?
love this
entonces aquí es donde invierten el dinero que sacan del genshin impact ?
Ok everyone is excited for the animated short. What I want is the voice mod from HoC.
Là sao nhỉ đoạn trailer này có ý nghĩa như nào vậy?
I started playing when elysia was i released and i cant wait to finally see her in the cinematic, also damn it still feels like yesterday when thus spoke apocalypse was announced 💀
MIHOYO! Give us the full version NOWWWWWWWWWWWWW!
O kawaii kotto
Waaaa esto es otro gran video animado de honkai, lo esperare con mucho hype se ve épico, y si es de la diosa Elysia lo mejor...
Uuuuuuuuuuu! Cant' wait for the Hersher of Ego!
So what for the type of depression will we have now?
Hoping for the Flame Chasers is also in this animation 🤞
Where is the first and second animated shorts?
Oh, nooo! Elysia is getting corrupted ;-;
I need to figure out what the music is playing in the background cause it sounds so beautiful 😭
I can't wait to see it 🥺
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I'm ready to take some tissue
elysia lovers eating so good rn
Damnit I’m not ready 😭
Ely best girl ‼️
Me?
0:09 oh noo her arm ;-;
can't wait to cri.
excited
Loved the HoC voice I'm very hyped for this
Elysia alone?
I’ve always had a soft spot for Elysia. She debuted not long after I started playing, and in the year since, she’s become one of my two favorite characters. I can’t wait to for the animation, to see how she marks the end of the Elysian Realm, and the Flamechasers she loved so much
I think Hi3 is the only game where people are glad to have whales, because they put in money and the f2p people like me get to see animation like this.
I feel bad for Vill-V, not getting enough viewers xD
This may just generate more feels than Final Lesson. I'm ready!
This looks really amazing,I wish this game was on console. I’d love to play it,it sucks playing on the phone because it drains the battery and doesn’t do the graphics justice on a small screen. Such a sad thing.
this is b e a u t i f u l
Why this have so much views in just 18 hours ☠️
I know this animation finna be fire and all, but tbh I'm not really a fan of all the 1vs1 fighting, especially for this fight. I really wished some of the FC can fight together, instead of just Elysia using their powers to defeat their opponent. I noticed that Honkai love using this solo method alot; instead of team battles, and using teamwork/tactics to get the dub. I'm still excited for this tho👌🏿
Honkai slays
The... Hype!
I'm not ready for this....  It's gonna hurt
And here I was saving for Aponia rerun so I can get her gear. I have over 6,000 crystals saved so far which is the most I had at one time.
wait what i'm not ready to let go of elysia and the 13 fc yet </3
Man, I'm gonna miss Elysium Everlasting after this chapter reaches its end.
IT HAS 1MIL VIEWS ALREADY
Elysia i am in love with u
For only 52 seconds I feel like the entire world shifted. This was insane she is insane she is queen
You have no idea how much I cried seeing this.
So Beautiful, I love all the animations they do for Honkai. Like cooking with Valks, or ELF academy (new season when) It just brightens my day...most of them at least
I'm so sorry for Vill-v Elysia have my cristals
The physical bow master is coming very soon 😎😎😎😎
Vamos chorar galera, pq esse capítulo tá só a depressão
live laugh love elysia
How wonderful ❤️🌹
The intro looked like a pibby trailer and then the rest was banger
Don't Mess that up hoyowerse  +Will be good if that CG would be the longest like chapter   Bdw why there is no song ?
Is there a chinese dub version? Please?
Hype
Lo vi en un anuncio
Mihoyo showing why he top like RPG queen in industry, first Game that has a Gameplay similar to his animations (~￣▽￣)~
Our waifu gets a new suit... Men of culture Are screaming in happiness
поч убрали русс. субтитры
Moaarrrrrr!
You guys make the best animations, I see why you don’t wanna make an anime because you’d melt our eyes with how beautiful the animations would be.
I am not a fan of Elysia at first, but doing ER and the Main story made me love her so much. Em'' excited to see her in this new Animated Shorts
I dont have words, HoYoverse talent is increidible ever and ever more
This made me emotional
Me encanta la voz de Elysia, y de Herrscher of Corruption. Su voz da miedo como debería de ser
Can't wait to see Ellie back
0:42 Elysia clearly loved all of the MOTHs and believed in them from the bottom of her heart even if almost none of them could really see eye to eye, she drew her strength from them.
It's so sad to think Honkai will have only one more year until the end. This is too good to end :(
If anyone here is looking for CN ver with subs, here it is:  https://youtu.be/Ovt4iBgZMhI
i’m on my knees for ely
Unfortunately I have never played honkai before cuz I’m playing from a PlayStation and I’m only playing genshin from mihoyo’s games but she looks awesome as any other characters mihoyo releases
Herrscher Elysia is clearly has similarity with Goddess Madoka.
Holy shit this is crazy animation 😩💖
Elysia...
Elysia, the only Herrscher that is more than a Herrscher. The daughter of a god, sent to earth because she wanted to live as a human and in the end she died for their sins.
After Otto's "death", it's been a long wait for an animated short.
ok this song is a banger
I hope the upcoming animation is also accompanied by a terrific song!
I CANT WAIT
Elysia is going to show us how be Gracious and Beautiful!! Lovely! C:
Prepare your tissues guys, for wiping tear ofc.
LAIDOWJWODIWOKSODSO OMG SO PRETTY
Praying for elysia to get a physical form and live with world serpent for the time being 😔
ELYSIAAAAAA
Because of me
The story start with Elysia and it will also end with Elysia - Don't die okay?
These banger animation CGs are the reason why I started playing this game.
Bruh… just take my money already, all of it!
Looks like a new skin is coming ಠ_ಠ
damn this cool
Two possibilities.                This is herrscher is alive and thats why we are getting her as a valk. Or it's a dead herrscher and we still get her as a valk, but a possibility of another herrscher of a different unit.
MYHOYO WHEN IS SUMERU COMING IN GENSHIN IMPACT
.
I think we should use Chairbound Prankster as Ely's leitmotif
I can't support the idea of waiting so long for her, I need her now!
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Elysia looks Amazing and the animation just get better and better
i love her so much
ellie my love!!! shes getting a new battlesuit, a new elf, AND an elf
UOOOOO SEEEEGGGGGGGGGGGGGSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
omg
Why not have the same level of animation for your bread winner, Genshin?
HATUNUM
We gonna cry again, aren't we?
Holy. Shid. That music is BANGING. Animation is beautiful as always
I don't know why mihoyo is axing so much on Elysia they forget about the another character stories?
of note is that for some reason  the japanese version and the chinese version are different. what she says after shooting the different colored arrows in the chinese version is thus: the traces we leave in this world will someday become another person's guiding light. thank you for willing to remember our names. we will have to leave behind a spectacular ending. one without regret, the grandest curtain call.
Elysia fans having a feast right now 🥂🍾🎂
QUE FODA
already farming for her 😍😍 gonna skip every gacha
Now that I think about it, this is essentially a battle between a virus and an anti-virus but anime-style.
elysia’s amimated model is super pretty, the animation looks amazing, and i am absolutely terrified for her too  good job hyv, can’t wait to see the full short!
Damn i need to catch up Havent even finish ch 29 yet

Gotta catch up with the story real quick
Ready the best speaker for another epic song, ready the tissues for flying ninja onions, ready the heart defibrillators when you got hit in the feels. Now im ready.
Ini sih lebih2 dari aponia desainnya.
We need Mihoyo to make an anime series that looks like this 3d mix with 2d style
Shame this couldn't be a Mobius short. Even though it's her Pinkness,  I'm just happy to see another Mihoyo animation.
Wow ! She's very special in everyone's heart !
Poor vill-v.
I have never played Honkai, and i don't know what is the story, but I frequently get ads about Elysia and I love her
Another Ethereal Shorts coming soon lads!! We're winning
So glad they got Marina to voice in this game.
She is aliveeeeee.  Glad this ia not another dead
Афигетл
Sooooooo........nobody gonna talk about that fact that Herrscher of The End is probably showing up soon???..........🙄
The animation is fucking amazing 🤩 I can’t wait to see it!, on a serious note mihoyo needs to make a full anime of the game.
Kaname Madoka is that you?
They're gonna kill her, won't they?
Elysia's smug smile at 0:12. She's going to beat the crap out of HoC.
Sayonara Elysia 🙂.oO (😭)
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Oh boy... I wonder who's the singer this time that'll bless our ear, if it's Elysias CN VA, my satisfaction is unmeasurable

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

It's time to say good bye to our wife.
My waifu 🫠
Aaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!
idk if my heart can handle this later..
oh my love
Un tráiler bastante épico!! También me sorprende que hayan doblado el tráiler, aunque supongo que aprovecharon a la seiyū ya que la tenían en el estudio.
Ong dayumm😱
Another new short animation......another box of tissue we have to prepared..... XD
وشو هذا !!! قصييير، مرره بيرفكت بس قهر ما امداني استمتعت والله قههر 😫😭😭😭😭💘💘   بالله كثر منها يا مديييير
Her theme on the background brings me chills.
hmmm... where is my new song??? every tralers had a short version of it, i'm so confused
I can feel depresso coming.
Hype!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
HOLY F##KK SHES SO BEAUTIFUL
Mihoyo going to punch us in the gut, laugh at us, make us cry again, and then keep laughing at us as they prepare for the next arc of sadness
Okay I'm pulling for her
..Shame I won't actually be able to get her.
I got chills, sheeeshhh.
So this is where Elysia mentioned to Mei about being a Herrscher because deep down without realizing she was going to become the Herrscher of Ego... while Herrscher of Corruption... it's pretty much a computer virus
came
Элизия ты прекрасна♥️🛐
for those who's wondering where's mei  SPOILER ALERT🚨      she manages to get out of elysian realm with the help of 13th flame chaser and they bid her farewells, because elysia will take down HoC along with elysian realm itself.
HOT Damn! THIS LOOKS LIKE AN FGO NEW CHAPTER TRAILER. FCKN AWESOME.
Thank you, Elysia and 13 Flame-Chasers for all the things you have done for Honkai-verse 🥰
Mihoyo is really hyping up 6.0
So this is the one the Elysia diehard fans are going crazy about in tiktok
OMG
It's sad what happened with Elysia, a such good character but with a tragic and sad past, she definitely remember me of Kiana in terms of nice and tragic backstory.
Fans Elysia Bener Bener Kenyang Di Next Version Wkwkwkwkw
Please Go Full-Length someday Mihoyo! You have the Skill and Money to do it! And Honkai's Story is Pretty Damn Good too!
HOLY SHIT ELYSIA GETTING HER FIRST ANIMTED SHORT!?!?!? WE'RE WINIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINGGGGGG!!!!!!
When is this?
As an Elysia fan, I'm getting fed a lot
Hoyoverse really outdoing themselves left and right, from exploring different fighting techniques to having an entirely new art style that looks clean af. I'm only going to watch the full short when I reach that point in the story, but holy I'm excited
(●'◡'●)
Can someone explain what is going on in this PV?
Perfection. She’s too much, too pure for this world.
elysia's banner please

Yasssssssssssss Queeen
All Hail The ELYSIANISM!!!!!!!
so I was right. the short is gonna be only Elysia and Mei is gonna be left in the gutter
Im so hyped!!
this is animation about elysia vs herrscher of corruption?
At his point of animation why niot just go ahead and give us a full anime of Honkai.
Elysia fans getting full
Guess Kevin is Next and then we'll have the last CG of the game against the final Herrscher
Mais faite un anime honkai impact 3rd, a chaque fois c'est Incroyable
I think I just came.. 😩
Mihoyo please give me HoH ok
As someone who has been playing Honkai for a while now.  I'm so fed up with having too many Herrschers that the plot doesn't have any charm.
ELYSIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Miss pink elf!!
Mihoyo I'm spending £150 for her pls let her come home early
See you aroud the 12 august 🤩❤️
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Elysia! Omg, this is so hype. But still, I like her character,  but when are we getting back to Kiana’s story?
Honkai players: cool, another animation. Genshin players: wait, you have no-reason animations? Like for real?
我理解奥托了😭
There are meteoric salvation references, I hope she succeeds and comes back "alive" just like Kiana did. But at this point, there's no hope
"Fight for all that is beautiful in the world!"  Yeah!!! Let's fight for Elysia!!!
I LOVE YOU ELYSIA IM GOING TO MISS YOU SO MUCH
At least Elysia’s not wrong, it is going to be grand and spectacular. But of course soul crushing, the story has so sad moments now.
the bgm for the preview sounded like a mix of all the bgm for the released of flamechaser characters
Спасибо за русские субтитры 🙏🏻
Wait JP dup? This mean we get JP dup at same time with CN dup?
I already love the music
tear again???
Madoka, is this you? :')   Anyways, man, the animation locks really sick! Like an official Anime or something. Bravo! 💕
I'm not prepared for this... to tear up again
yey. Im saving crystals for Elysia ^^
Ok, that's the hype train coming in, and that's bigger than the Star Rail one  (●’3)♡(ε`●)
Elysia is the best character that honkai has ever made. I need more of her, please
Holy cow new skin for Elysia
THIS IS SO GOOD! I'M HYPED!!!!! LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
HOLLYYYY I SO HYPED UP CANT WAIT TO SEE HER FULLY ANIMATED AHHHH
finally the animation again!!!! i cant wait for watching this!
Goddammit put her in the game ASAP!!!!! And the weopon of Herrscher of thunder "rumble's" banner back
It look so epic when Elysia parts starts renderring back and funny that HoC force her to suffer but through glitches we see Elysia is still smilling
Mihoyo may be thinking it can get players to simp over elysia but as the anti simp player I am, I will not simp till death takes me !
SHE'S SO GORGEOUS WTF
I swear if i dont get her and her set im ganna kms
Madoka is that you?
Lets go, i like  this.
PLEASEEEE ever since her free S rank battlesuit she’s become one of my favorite characters!! I’m so excited for new battlesuit in 6.0 😩❤️
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Мурашки по коже...
Elysiaaaaaa, I'm pulling for you and your gears! Please come home!  also Elf Ely!
Finally what we are waiting for!! This one gonna be masterpiece!!
Субтитры на русском, конечно, радуют. Было бы неплохо ещё в самой игре их получить.
From the very first sight, you have always been my favorite Elysia. ❤️
Elysia is just pure. Cant believe my heart gets swayed by her so much that she's in equal footing with Rita-sama in my heart now tsk.
Time to save crystal .. 💯 to get her😘
When she released the thirteen different coloured arrows and said “the flame chasers were the only ones who showed up at that time and place” I really felt that… they were thirteen pros fighting for a better end for previous era. They never gave up, even until now, they’re still helping current era fight against the Honkai in their own way, very helpfully too. I love them so much, even if Elysian realm collapses they will forever be in our hearts. And Mei’s heart ❤️ 💜  That beat drop at 0:22 GIVES ME CHILLS. AWESOME
Remember, the reason this entire arc exist is that "real world Kevin" couldn't be bothered to talk with Mei.
ZZZ's test just then, and now a short animation's coming soon. What a day, so much hyped!
HONKAI ANIME WHEN?!??!??!?!?
Elysia is Hoyo second daughter after Tuna
At this point I am not even mad that I pulled like crazy at Senti and ended up getting nothing, just means it will be easier to get Elly ^w^
Why does she has the Rose vibe from Steven Universe for me
Beautiful
Mahou shoujo: is that you madoka?
Holy sheet ,the music🔥🔥
I would like to go back to playing the game, but I do not understand the English language and the game does not contain the Arabic language, and it is difficult to play without understanding anything from the story. I wish the company would add it to make it easier to play and understand the story ✨
Myhoyo, we need your anime! Dont be shy, lets release your anime about anything.
DAMN ELYSIA BEST GIRLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
The Will of Honkai is losing its touch. Imagine making a Herrscher that gets defeated by a simulation.
The way I absolutely cannot wait for this animation, I just know it's going to be gorgeous
THE BEST I LOVE ELYSIA SO MUCH
Nhìn Ely Herrscher nhiều điểm giống Madoka vãi 😂
Oh new Animated short can't wait for a banger music and animation

Очень интересненько, особенно факт наличия русских субтитров. Hoyoverse, а можно всегда так? Можно русский и в Honkai?

WTFFFFF I GET GOOSEBUMPS WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO ME
Wow they immediately provide the trailer in the japanese version
Because of you, Elysia, you made my day better:))
this music gives me madoka magica vibes....which means its time to prepare the tissues
(If Ur Gonna Argue With Me Please Read This Whole, And I'm Not Judging or Forcing So Its Ur Choice Where U Want To be At The Afterlife)  "You have heard "We shall not commit adultery" but if we look at a woman with Sexual intentions, we are committing adultery in our hearts." - {Matthew 5 27-28}   "If we confess our sins, God is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins  and cleanse us from all wickedness."(1 John 1:9)  "But we must flee from our sinful ways, and pursue righteousness, faith ,love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart."(2  Timothy 2:22)  <if ur single or not in a relationship>its still a sin when we look at some one sexually bc we are commiting sex out of marriage and fornication in our hearts.  Having sexual things to ur wife isn't a sin, it's only a sin when ur having sexual things to someone that u are not married with.  Btw i understand ur struggle in p0rn and h3ntai addiction, and im not forcing so its ur choice where u want to be in the afterlife, but i care for ur soul, i will pray for u Godbless and Peace✌️💙✝️  #PleaseStopWatchingP0rnAndH3ntai #ICareForYourSoul #Godbless✝️❤️
Elysia I’m ceying I’m on the floor I’n actually crying please Elysia akdnzjjsnnsbn
I think I need to restock more tissues for this one it's going to be sad ending again 🥲
OMGGGGG ELY ANIMATION SHORT IS HERE T^T
ELYSIA MY GODDESS PLEASE COME HOME THIS NEW SUIT HAS ME CRAWLING UP THE WALLS
Bros I ain’t gonna lie, I’m losing my mind atm and that is perfectly fine for once 😂😂
SO HYPE!
Now that's interesting! Can't wait for her final  culmination in this story!
Sắp phải khóc rồi 😢
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I dont want the elysian realm era to end 😭😭
The saddess part is she won't come back during Sea Anniversary
oh my gosh!!!! i cant wait for it to get fully animated
I'm so glad I became an Ely main. I used to stan the Original Trio but after playing Elysian Realm and the lore in Elysian Everlasting, I could say that Ely is the best independent main character.
Im so excited and yet i haven't even downloaded honkai
ELYSIA MY LOVE
THIS IS AMAZING
Mihoyo should make an anime!
ELYSIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
woahh
HoC just looks at the composer of the whole era and says 'they suck'  And elysia is like  'Bitch. The climax has just begun'
Something is raising....     And it is Honkai's sales revenue!
out of curiosity, why isn't there the chinese dubs for these/version trailers anymore?
GREAT ANIMATION! but i kinda miss the MMD version is that what it called? 🤔 🥲👈
Its a positive and a wholesome story guys
Well.. Gonna prepare after Elysia's End chapter...  Dudu's chapter incoming
She's totally going to die (again), right? I'm not ready for this...
Wooaaa... this is gonna be good 😍
It's like antivirus VS tons of viruses lol
HYPEEE!!!!!!
OH MY GODBDJSDHSH
YESSSSS LETS GOOOO ELY GETTING ANIMATED LESGOOOOO
This gave me goosebumps
My Elysia simp friends: *slobbering rn*
Wait? It's in japanesse? I thought it would like the usual
This is going to be epic and sad. I’m no sure if I’m ready for this.
If the global server wasn't a bit outdate, I'm sure it would be more epic for me ❤️
Man Honkai's lore is 10x deeper and touching than Genshin.
Ahh yes another animated honkai YEEESSS
I didnt expect elysia to also become a herrscher my god shes so **elegant**
Elysia look beautiful :>
HOLY SHITTTTT
LIVE LAUGH LOVE ELYSIA
WEDDING DRESS!!!! Yayyy
Psychiatrist: Oh boy, another payday from dep...lonely souls wrecked by another minutes of shorts.
The anime vibe
I love her so much
I'm ok with the JP dub, I myself can speak JP as well, But I don't think its appropriate to upload JP version only. Cuz neither it is fair for CN dub players, nor the CN voice actors. I hope you can upload both, its not GI, just two videos won't be that messy, isn't it?
Segsss
OMG ! 😍
Prepare for cry...again. 😢
Mihoyo never disappoints with such amazing animations!! ❤️🔥
Se viene otro momento histórico
Elysian Realm~ Started by Elysia, ended by Elysia
Animation and music company ✔️
EARLY!!
We need more of this style of animation. It's so lovely and now my Bank is screaming at me
she reminds me of inori and the administrator on sao deyymm
The violins screams even more with this animation trailer.
I ain't gonna cry.....yet qwq
Elysia (ISNT) Dead
Takeshi happy noises
Oof. "The story of the 13 flame-chasers," line got changed.
I'm sorry Vill V
OOOOK I took a break from honkai after mobius story. How many elysian realm chapter did I miss lol ?
Sorry Vill-V, this Elly's Herrcher form is everything!!!!!
Sorry Vill V... I save my crystal for her
im losing my mind here hello???
i wish mei could stay with her forever i need to have a long talk with whoever is in charge of writing.
12th vs 13th. Next is 14th?
It's Mommy, sorry Mommy, sorry Mommy
Omg yes❤❤❤❤❤
Can't wait for another depression to hit us hard with this godly animation. Well done, Mihoyo!
SHE SLAYED!!!
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
bro these animations are amazing keep up the work hoyoverse
LFGGGGGGG !!!!
this animation style is so different than any of the ones they've done so far! I'm literally so excited
GODDESS ANIME CLIP, GIVE ME MORE O
WOAH
WOOOAAAAAHAHUEHUE 🔥
slayful
YES!!!!!
My love 😭😭😭😭😭
Cant wait!
YES YES YES YES YES
OH MY GOD!!! ELYSIA!!! LET'S GO!!!!!!!!!!!
先行预感现在都日语版本了，属实是狠狠地跪下了
The hype is real when hoyoverse makes another goated animation
I don't want this to be the end of flame chasers... :C they're all too cool to lose like that. now I have more feelings for them than for our usual valkyries
YOOOOO ANIMATED ELYSIA WOOOOOOO
Yep the ost is a banger as always
skip, gonna wait for her rerun
elegance ❤❤❤
Oh boy, time to buckle in and get ready to get punched in the feels by MiHoYo again. Time to prepare a new box of tissues everyone, we're all probably going to be sobbing wrecks at the end of this again.
JP dub really hits different
I can already tell that this is going to be a banger and will make me cry again 🥺
Elysia 😻😻😻
Make an anime pls 😭😭😭
Elysia Wangy Wangy
So not only is she beautiful, kind, and flirty, she's an absolute badass as well? I think Elysia might just be the best character in the entire game at this point.
Holy shit the animation
This music sounds epic
Kiana, Bronya, Mei, Hua, (herrscher otto?), And now we got Elysia 😆
beautiful!
YOOOO
ngl i cried this is amazing
I want a anime like this! it looked amazing!
Bout to be poor
GOD DAMN
elysia aoough
I see a hint of a new animation short coming for Honkai and I can't help but practically squee in excitement.
While captains are crying from the spending event, Mihoyo wants us to cry even more for the animated short. Goodbye flamechasers 😔
INCREDIBLE
So will we be getting a new battle suit?
The story started with Elysia And end with Elysia  What a line.... Also here we go COMRADES!!! Bring out the tissues!!
I'll bet my left nut that I'll cry watching this.   I'll win.
Hypeeeeeee...rion~ let's go miss Pink Elf <3
Animation!!!
ah yes the Game Bring Me Here
Vi el tráiler en chino y la verdad me gustó más que en jp xd igual está genial
OK OK TIME TO FARM FOR HER
HEAVY BREATHING INTENSIVE.....
Visible concern that Mei's not in the final fight since JP is alr done even though Sawashiro Miyuki is still out
ueueue i'm going to miss them 🥲
im very excited but can you also upload a version of this with the chinese voiceover? i want to be able to have the english subtitles still while getting to listen to the voiceover that i like
Wooohoooo I'm so excited for 6.0 (≧▽≦)
ngery"
Im crying already, can’t wait for the animation and ost!
hypeeeee
My wife elysia.... ❤️
There's already JP Dub?! Nice.  I want to watch it with Japanese Dub (❁´◡`❁)
Elysia has been my personal favorite character in honkai since I first saw her I'm so happy to see her animated!
I really want an anime about her story! Good job this is so so awesome!! 💗💗💗
this already looks amazing, good job to the animators :)
😭😭😭My tear my eyesss
Save your tears.
Tbh it’s like a reference to Mandnda Cataloge Vol. 1,2,3 not gunna lie
say your last goodbyes to your wallet guys
I am prepared to cry an ocean of tears istg  I got way too attached to the Flamechasers, So I hope that the ending of their story will be "grand and spectacular" :''D
HoC when?? hm? HM??
Ely's Herrscher Form suddenly reminded me of Madoka Kaname's God Form and also the feels too from Madoka Magica considering Honkai's story is expected to be dark especially in this upcoming chapter.
ahhh shittttttt
Thank you for creating Elysia, the Flamechasers and Elysian realm. Changed my life
0:12 Corrupted smile :'(
0:11 Elysia is always smiling. Seeing her being sad does hurt me a little bit.....
Wait this PV is in JP dub, so were expecting next week we get JP dubbed instead of usual CN first then JP 4 weeks later
tbh one of the best game with best animation
If the 13 fight together one last time, it would really be a grand and spectacular ending, and I look forward to it!
Ahhh sht here we go again with the masterpiece
The animation is becoming more smooth and well made..... If this continues to improve, expect Hoyoverse will make an animation company in the future or atleast until honkai impact is near to its end story, and make honkai an anime for that more and more players will discover games of Mihoyo.
LETS GOOOOOOO
Great Girls First Looks
Omg a remix version of her trailer theme 😍
I'M GOING TO EAT BRICKS
Her version came a bit fast
*I still can't believe that we're finally saying goodbye to Elysian Realm T_T*
О МОЙ БОГГГГГГГГ
This is my 1st time waiting for an animation LEZGO
Я в любви
OMG THIS MEANS THAT ELYSIAN REALM ARC IS ENDING SOON NOOOO
THIS IS SI GOOD, CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HER ANIMATED IN THE GAME
If they release an anime with the entire Honkai plot, the film, video game and anime industry wins 😈😎🥵😎😈
I need to pardofelis rerun pls honkia impact
thank you elysia, thank you 13 flamechasers. we will always remember your story and carry it with us 🙏
HOLY THIS IS BEAUTIFUL ELYSIA LOOKS SO PRETTY
So HoC is the TVs from ZZZ all along huh? It all make sense with their market strategy now with ZZZ beta dropping today lmao. Can't wait for the full thing tho.
I’m excited but I’m also starting to feel tears forming on my eyes, can’t wait!
The chills man, the chills...  Please don't be a Final Lesson 2.0
I promise. I'll get you to my bridge, Elysia 😍
Coming soon....nice
hóng quá
OK, calm down...calm down..... I NEED IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Another masterpiece incoming. This looks gorgeous already!
May your odes be forever be sung, somewhere in this universe, as a bard of happiness composed by million tragedy.  Elysian Realm is a mere fairytale, so please, give yourself the ending, the ending befitting of what you want, just like how our Fool Clown decided to end his story, may the ending of your story also be remembered, eternally.  As this is your only proof that you once existed, along with the memories, and wishes you all made.  May your one and only reader forever etch it upon her heart, to bring your legacy along the future you gave.
Finally, Elyisa in all her glory
Ellie 💕🧎‍♂️🧎‍♂️
WAIT IS SHE A HERRSCHER
My goodness Ellie is so beautifully animated… Alright wallet-kun, your time is up
Man elysia is impossible to dislike. She really is perfect. The flawless human.
amazing
I'm not prepared to leave Elysian Realm . ELYSIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
IM SO EXCITED
I cant wait for the full animation!!! Kill that mf HoC
Hopefully this short is the final push for me to like Elysia. I love her character writing, but I find her personality incredibly annoying and is the only thing that keeps me from fully liking her. I did like her in ch29 though. It felt like her annoying traits were toned down and her more "human" side that made her feel more organic and vulnerable were what made me go from outright disliking her to liking her a little. And in that one shot where it looks like she's getting choked out and vulnerable, that made want to cheer for her for the first time. So I am hoping this fully makes me an Elysia fan because I want to like her character, but I despise her personality because of how much she annoys me, which is the one thing that prevents me from really liking her
well, i was thinking it was exactly the right time for another spirit breaking Honkai Impact 3rd animation.
She needs a boyfriend.
What was the Will of the Honkai trying to prove that placing HoC in the place of literal Herrscher killers?????
Hang on, where's the CN trailer?
Elysia saving the current era, the best goddess that ever lived ❤️❤️😍
Omg elysia
I need this arc to end I can't do this anymore, the spoilers on twitter are about to make me cry😭😭😭
OMG QUEEN THINGS
I LOVE this game and EVERYONE working on it
Elysia not only is getting a new valk suit, a new elf, and a summer skin, but she's also having her own animated short? Her fans be eating good right now.
Time to see how hoyo improved ×500 from previous animation
wtf am i watching. i got chills watching this trailer. when i experience this live imma die. also what is this animation, i thought thus spoke apocalypse and everlasting flame had insane animation but this is on another level. good stuff hoyo. deff worth the wait
THE SONG IS GONNA  SLAP I KNOW IT
*shivering*😳
HOLY- THE QUALITY IS INSANE. I really can't wait for this
Elysia fired 12 arrows to HoC with different colors representing the other FC I guess, also the animation is keep getting better and better!
Damn this really is the End if we're getting a whole Animation 😥..............ELYSIA I MISS YOU ALREADY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Quen
YATTA
Gonna catch up with the story ASAP
Ohh Soo Out of The 13 only 5 remains, Kevin, Fu Hua, SU, Eden and Mobius  Survive the battle on the Moon against the 14th Herrscher just to delay Her. Aponia Stay On earth to use her power to give hope to the remaining human and Griseo well she cant fight The 14th Herrscher soo she stay together with Aponia.. I think this was there cause of Faith (13th Flame Chasers) based on this Video and in game. Pardofelis- Died During the Battle on the moon. Fu Hua- Survive and still Alive and was out in-charge of project ember. Griseo- Missing or maybe she was put in charge on the Project Ark. Mobius- Survive the Battle on the moon but commit suicide before she enter her Cryo sleep. Kosma- Died during Battle on the Moon. Sakura- Killed during the outbreak of the 12th Herrscher. SU- Survive the Battle on the moon and was put in-charge on Project Valuka and subsequently died in the 2nd key manga. Kalpas: Died during the Battle on the moon?. Vill-V - Died during the battle on the moon. Eden- Survive the Battle on the moon and was partially In-charge on Project ember until her death. Aponia- Has to Stay on earth to keep humanities hope and her faith is unknown.. Elysia: ????? Kevin: Survive and still alive he was in-charge on Project Stigma. Correct me if im wrong ill accept criticism.
LOOK AT THISSS,YOU CANT SAY THAT THIS ISNT HYPE. JUST LOOK AT THE ANIMATION,THE ART,EFFECTS,THE EVERYTHING😭😭🤩🤩🤩😍😍🥳🥳. IM HYPED UP FOR THE FULL ANIMATION =DDD.
6/10...
The story began with elysia and will be end with her too, thought I can't watch this without tears
Ayoo, jp dub teaser animation already?
Seeing Elysia in an anime form is so beautiful and I can't wait to cry again when the full animation short released
I DONT WANT ELLIE TO DISAPPEAR.
Elysia is animation looks so pretty and hot 😍❤️
I'm supposed to be going to bed, I just wasn't prepared to getting hyped this much
Is this the battle of the 8th Herrscher or the 10 Herrscher? But i really have the Feeling that this the PE 8th Herrscher.

Because of you  I disagree
I'm going to be a mess after this aren't i?
The real pain and sadness is about to begin
Even if she's technically dead, you guys still killed a character within one version number.
Mihoyo you're slaying WAY too hard low it down a bit
