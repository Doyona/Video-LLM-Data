briillant

I love how Lando is a full time content creator , photographer , part time golfer , full time Racer  and in this video a driver instructor like he’s amazing and I wasn’t surprised when Lando won he is a racing driver 😂😂
Since @lando_norris you asked me to subscribe I will do it! Just because you are my favourite driver evern and being an Italian my dream will be to see you driving a Ferrari F1!

i need Lando to teach me how to drive
I live 15 mins from there I live in maidstone
Aarava needs to get his license revoked
Who is the girl
tisasemand
I subscribed 10 months later because of Lando because I was late to the party🎉
Lando saying "Im so scaredd" when he drives a race car that goes 250kms. Hes so funny
Kind of saddened that no one attempted to drift around the pole there
arravas run was funner.
ok but LANDO’S RUN
4:04 Lando running is always fun to watch😁😁
I'm still dying over how Niran said in the beginning "We're gonna be driving around in this reasonably priced car" 😭😭
lando looks so cute >>>>>
Imagine having lando in your car for your first driving experience
why there a 1 girl and like 5 boys
What kind if impossible autocross circuit is that? 😂
1:46 that lady in background taking photo
My car is actually the exact same one just in red 😂 I love my car tho 🥰
Are all those ambulances for them? 😂
Lando teching me to drive qould be a dream for me😂
Shocking outcome! 😂
LANDOO I AM SUBSCRIB3D WHAT ARE YOU ON ABOUT😂😂😂
Still faster than Ferraris pitstops 😂
I'm sorry, but when Lando ran towards the car... the cutest run ever with that cute little hoodie❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂
So nobody in England knows how to drive stick is what I’m taking from this lol. Here in the states that’s right after learning to not shit yourself 😂
me actually not being subscribed and getting jumpscared by lando, def subscribed now
When Lando tells you to subscribe, you subscribe
We need Part 2 or make this a series
Aarav saying driving with someone without a license is scary cunt can’t drive himself what’s he in about the other bloke was better than him
Ria hot af
Ethan did the impossible
4:02 6:25
0:58 why even wear a seatbelt if shes gona wear it like that (under her arm)
Just Imagine if i was there, i would be like Jeremy Clarkson: speed and power 🤣
my toxic trait is thinking i would have done it better
So lando finally a famous youtuber now… he made it!😂😊
Good to see Lando and Alex hanging out.
This is like a coffee break mission from Gran Turismo
HELP THE WAY LANDO RAN
Max's reaction to the guy who can't drive, doing the turn 🤣
lando, i am subscribed..... Please leave me alone :) hahahha
Of course Lando would win he is an F1 driver! I was hoping Lando would win tho
Seeing aarava here was a pleasant surprise :)   EDIT: yes i'm a fist time viewer
Aarav made James May look fast.
Coffee break trial feels a little different
Odd that a F1 drivers friends dont even drive.
Maximillian, you shaved your bloody beard?! Oh gohd 😂😂😂😂
Lando sounds like my driving instructor “I’m scared”
lol aarava says driving with someone without a license is scary lol im sorry aarava but how did you get your license after that driving lol
Only man that can help SpongeBob pass his driving exam
Why does Niran have a Cafe menu when instructing Aarav? 😂😂
This was a fun video
1:47 why is he surprised that a fwd can wheelspin 😂
I see a quadrant with all of you and I just know it's gonna be hilarious!!! 😂😂
they literally built a among us track 💀
Thank you Aarav, now i feel better for forgetting the handbrake too
The fact ethan was the only 1 who got the tight right hander but fucked up every other part of the track is hilarious🤣🤣
I’ve never laughed so much 😂😂
Yessss! We need more Feef in the content. Loved this one guys, had me crying laughing.
I didn't realize manual driving was so common in England! In the U.S. I don't know anyone with a manual only automatic :)
the paramedics in the background having a heart attack while Max is driving LMFAOOOO
Nirvan drives better than Aarav.
not me getting a f1 ad LMAOO
is it only me but the race track looks like an amogus
Of course aarav and Niran caused chaos, how did they not realise the handbrake 😂.  Lando going over and teach niran, and then for Ethan. Good video!
this video is insane 😭
I care by only one thing: why is there a °à l'aise breizh" sticker on that car??? 😂 iconic!!
omg i thought i was subscribed.  thanks Lando! :)
I think ria might actually be my favourite person ever
This makes me happy.
3 minutes in and my belly hurts from laughing
Lando can you give a massive shoutout to my mum Tace (That's her name)
I play F1 and my mum loves you Lando and I love aarava   I'm making my YouTube channel soon It will be called Riley Doodles   My dream is to join you YouTube channel
I think Lando should think about becoming a pro driver 🤔😏
I NEED max and lando to be my driver instructor that the only way i can have my driver licence
Lando runs like a little girl ❤️
Tbh this is probably the best car Lando's been in this year
fifa is chalked🤣😂
This was so fun!!!! I love how even if they are professional drivers, they don´t make fun of others and try to explain and help the other drivers!!!! amazing video.
Hope aarav doesn't have a drivers license :D
I think this lando dude should race in formula 1.
Cap im subbed up
shoutout to the guy replacing the cones
why does Lando run like that....
How can most of them not drive😂
Lol Feef well done. Glad your first time was with Lando! 🤩
Seatbelt under the armpit 🤦🤦🤦🤦
Great video!
Quite worrying that a car team of sorts cant drive cars apart from lando and steve😂
just iconic honestly 🤣🤣🤣
lol didnt have to watch this video to learn that lando is the best in quadrant😂
Max being no help to Ria at all was not at all surprising, and she just looked so stress when he was driving. Maniac Max!  Also, I've been driving for 14 years and I can't drive a manual to save my life, so I would have sucked.
“I’m so scared”… “go on you got it!” 😂
Flat out and dump the clutch 😳
Wait.. Aarav is a member of Team Quadrant?
2:20 did lando try to change down gears like he was in his f1 car swear his left fingers went to hit a paddle
Lando with the insane patience teaching them how to drive
I wonder who might be
I am having driving lessons at the moment and I would love it if I had Lando as my driving instructor!!!
Need an American to show you how to handle that.
Aarav driving just like how he does on F1 🤣🤣 awfully
Lando as driving instructor is wholesome. Maybe can do a video of Lando teaching Niran to drive for his driving license.
ngl Lando's wheelspin start looked satisfying af
Lando, there are too many helmets on the floor. Can I have one please? 😂
another top tier video by quadrant!!
3:26 the staff in the building are laughing as well🤣
aarav and niran hahahahaha😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lando’s little run 🥺☺️
This is amazing!!!!
1:23 Lando’s mclaren gt?
I didn't know Max was a Brooklyn Nets fan
lmao can lando come and teach me how to drive
Where can i sign up for lando to be my driving instructor
lando should get yall in a formula car
I looooove you guys!!!
The fact that i get to see Super GT and Lando Norris in the same is video is beyond me im quite happy now
Ria can be my instructor any day
Lando: "almost won a race once but then it rained"😂
I want to see more of Steve <3 <3
Lando is the most chill, humble F1 driver ever.  These are the best of the best in the world.  You would never guess it from these videos.  Great to see Super GT back in the vids.
Could someone just enlighten my knowledge of who those people are? His friends, randoms or whatnot?
I love how when Ethan brakes hard, he goes flying forward despite having his hands on the wheel but Lando in the passenger seat doesn't move an inch because of his hippopotamus neck and other muscles
We need a "which member of quadrant is the best driving instructor? video now, omfg this is brilliant 😂
You know it’s a quadrant video when 1) max is scared for his life and 2) lando wins 😂 but that was hilarious love a quadrant Wednesday well done team keep smashing it but belly laughed form start to finish 🧡
omg the Ka only costs 500 quid on UK? lmaooooo, here it's at least like 2000 quid wtf
Lando fancy teaching me 😂😂😂😂
The content only gets better and better 😂
lando was actually a decent instructor ngl
The KA is iconic from Driver61 and Overtake channels. Collaboration soon? KA vs KA???
Do people not drive in the UK???
lando's run lmao 😭
That car is so smol 😂 What wonderful chaos! ❤
The look on everyone's faces when Aarav stalled the car brought me to tears 🤣🤣🤣 Edit: AND THE MAN LEFT THE HANDBRAKE ON 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That was fun! Sorry Aarav, I laughed at you. I think my 17 year old daughter, who has her driver license since April would have done that faster. 😅
steve pulled out a kmag with that 3 point turn lol
F1 driver teaches us how to drive a Manual 😭😭😭💀💀💀💀💀
This is actually the car I learned how to drive in 🤣 Amazing to watch this video :)
KA!!!
That was so adorable! Lol
lando is my favourite f1 driver
Lando I want to be an f1 driver
LN4🩵
Deadass couldn’t stop laughing seeing aarav and niran drive 😂😂😂😂 lando is the best driving instructor
This is the first time i have turned on a bell and all because of Lando
How come Lando is the best driver?😂
Alternative title: Lando vs Lance Stroll
4:02 the way hes running is so cute
the funniest group on youtube. Big love to all, your videos always make my day
Aarav and Niran... I'm crying laughing over here. 😅🤣😂
is their any free time in which Max or Lando could give me a driving lesson???? i will pay with spring rolls  for Lando and for Max an everlasting subscription to twitch from me and a 5 star review
Max went Ken Block mode xd
why lando
£500 for a knackered KA is most definitely not reasonably priced.
I rate lando as a driving instructor
Great vidéo as always
One of your best videos. ❤ it is shocking to me how many people don’t drive. We all used to take our driving test the day we turned old enough. Love the content, keep it up
F1 drivers doing car related side missions is always incredible to watch
You could see max having the need to beat Lando 😂
I KNEEEEEEEEEEW the Aarav curry gets him everytime 😂 Meanwhile if you're Bishy Gishy Sishy Mishy 🤣
Put Ethan in an F1 car and I reckon he laps the grid 8 times in the worst car on the grid. Natural talent he has.
So when’s the car brand sponsorship deal being announced?
Who doesn't love Lando. He is on my bucket list to interview. I got Kym Illman though. It's been great seeing Quadrant grow too.
Aarav's trim is too distracting
Some things that I love:  1. The Ria's laugh, I love it😋 2. Aarav and Niran being a Chaos when driving 😂 3. The effort of Ethan to learn to drive with Lando 🙃 4. Steve almost sending him to the shadow realm, as always 😅 5. Max so excited to do a show with de Ford Ka 🤣 and 6. Lando... well... he speaks for himself 😄. I'm not need to say why Lando is so special...😆
7:35 WHEN HE BRAKES YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCES IN LANDO'S NECK STRENGHT LMAOOOO HE'S A ROCK
Ethan did the best 🥳🥳
Honestly it would’ve been easier for the new drivers to give 100% throttle then just drop the clutch 🤣
Cant believe they got Lando and Albon in the same video
It feels like gran turismo 4
Beautiful scenes here, Steve finally breaking his P6 curse.
Nice that Lando let Albon go first 😂
she's the perfect advert for turkish teeth
How many times has Lando heard I'll never forget my first time?🤣
god i love ria!
The way lando ran is so cute
Lando part time F1 driver full time driving instructor
I haven’t laughed like this in a while 😂😂
Trust Aarav & Niran to bring the chaos 😂 Ethan did well though for someone who doesn't drive.
That is the cheapest shittest car ever, very reasonably priced :D
It like there version of the reasonly priced car from top gear
Have to be honest I was concerned about Aaravs’s driving when he was surprised you could spin a front wheel drive car 😂
Damn good content
I think they should've used the Fiat Jolly 😂
Please remind me never to take driving lessons with Quadrant 😂😂
Well I learned something today. You can drive a car with the handbrake on.
Lando the professional driving instructor, Max the drag racer and Ethan the Learner 😂 I swear quadrant Wednesdays are the highlight of my week. ❤
the way ria just took off with max
Lando should quit racing and become a profession driving instructor
I think i would feel more safe with Lando or max as a driving instructor than an actual driving instructor 😂
Lando is actually a surprisingly very calm when teaching someone how to drive for the first time. My mom was crying from panic laughing too much when I was learning x'D
max doing it for style, in a hanover
But I'm subscribed Lando 🥺
The way lando was running 😂
lando norris: part-time f1 driver, full-time driving instructor
Gran turismo 4 break mossion irl
No cones were harmed in the making of this video. These stunts are performed by trained professionals, don't try this at home.
McLaren showing a lot of trust for allowing lando to do this
Ria does not trust max or Steve in this at all I can tell 😂
man this is cringe , lando should concentrate more on f1 instead of giving this cringy youtube clowns more clout
so funny
watch steve drive ria around with without lookin just listen lmaooo
Lando should take up a profession as a driving instructor 😂
what an absolute hilarious chaos this was brilliant
Driving lessons from Lando
another quadrant banger, they truly never miss💪
Lando actually helping is something I didn't see somehow 🤣🤣
Max’s panic when Ria couldn’t start the car back up lmao
Was good Quadrant 😊
Aarav and Niran driving was absolutely hilarious, definitely the best drivers. And Max’s drift was amazing.
Full time content creator and photographer, part time golfer, part time racer and now casual driving instructor
lando feels like a dad teaching his children
pretty funny
lando mocking ethan- help 😭💀 6:45
Who would have thought, lando norris is the best driver 😂
Aarava and Niran is best duo 😂😂😂
Omg this vid was so funny🤣🤣🤣
ok nice vid
this is brill
This made my day ❤
1:43 The buuuurn! That's done great in the Lando way! Fantastic video again Quadrant!
is it me or the track looks like among us character? 😅
Lando Norris, full time driving instructor and part time f1 driver
OMG, I have the same car and I call him Bilbo! This video is so hilarious 😂
aarava got flashback from his f1 series
i think steve shouldve driven his m2,aarava stoled it as usual, and a slow poke
The way Lando helps and explains it is actually very sweet
Lando new service man 👨🏽‍🔧
Love you guys thanks for making content
“The Handbrake’s on!” 😭
"We will be finding out who is the best driver in Quadrant" Most likely the one who is an F1 driver 😂
nobody saw that Lando win coming
Lando becoming a driving instructor is iconic
Niran cannot drive??😭😭😭
Aarav and niran driving with the handbrake on is so real 😂😂😂
What is aarav doing😂😂
love quadrant ❤
GOD
I see Quadrant have purchased the 2015 McLaren F1 car for this video
