Pakistan Had The Grip On Day 4
Saud , remember the name ☠️
Three catches of Saud Shakil were dropped so he should have made 300.
Seriously what a knock Saud
Abrar shorts remember those!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!!!!!!!!
Brilliant performance by saud sakeel his first match outside the Pakistan but he performed very well he handle the pressure and score a double hundred and a great partnership with agha ❤
Very nice innings Pakistan team

Srilankan Batters must learn lot of things from Pakistani Tailenders......  Srilankan fielding department was just _______🙌

Hello
🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰💚🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰💚🇵🇰🇵🇰🏆🏆🏆🏆
Sri lanka lost too many chances
Gaaandu😞Shan Masood (the parchi player of the year)again showing how worthless ,pathetic,technique-less he is…😒Najam sethi should feel ashamed by inducting such a futile chap in the side ,their are so many good players sitting outside,complete injustice with them…Future of pakistan seems in danger if they continuously give chances to such barren players who are good for nothing
Naseem shah : wall of defense 😂😂
https://youtu.be/sqK6SXQzRns
naseem is the best
Sri Lanka just dropped the match when Angelo dropped Said shakeel
So long boundaries, what a innings by soud shakeel 💥
Saud shkeel❤
3:40 saud shakeel's reaction ❤❤❤
Eagerly waiting for you Pak Vs IND💚
Write Allah for 1 time
Thanks for your love and support❤
Saud Shakeel Should definatley be in the odi squad in upcoming world cup, he has great test average even though he plays slow but could attack when needed and he always plays his natural game, If top order failed to succeed in world cup matches so he could stay there and take pakistan to a respective total or near to the victory while chasing.
Chapri = pakistan😂😂
Pakistani v English bolne lage kya baat he... 😅😅
This is Pakistan beauty... Awesome saud shakeel❤❤
Saud Shakeel already a different kind of beast..... addition of Fawad and Abid Ali will make this batting lineup impeccable..... Imam should go so as Nauman!
Pakistan noob 😂😊
Against quality attack, only Babar will make runs.
Fix match many drop catch if India and Australia have opposition team they will not get 50 😂 time waste

We should appreciate 👏👏 naseem shah for his partnership with saud Shakeel He makes his 💯 because of this brilliant partnership
Poor bowling and fielding by Srilanka
I watched both the innings of Ishan kishan. 200 and Saud shakeel 200.. I like this innings bcz it's a test match with some quality spin ... So , congrats to shakeel . And I am saying he is a serious talent .. if he gets more opportunities...
Beautiful inning by saud shakeel I really enjoyed his batting love and good wishes from🇮🇳

Well played Saud Sakeel ❤🎉
I like Naseem shah inng very well played ❤ a big role you played for saud Shakeel double figure
Ye hai bwolar shriLanka ke
Believe me Or not saud 200 was possible because of the wall naseem🥵🥵
I'm sure BCCI will be jealous of this Team.
pakistan go ahead
Poor bowling and fielding from SriLankan player...
3:28 it hurts Agha 💔😢
Well-done Saud Shakeel
Great day for saud❤
Kitna bhi double century maarlo result to draw hi aana hai pathetic approach from both sides 😅😅😅😅😅
Wow saud shakeel amazing 🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
Saud Shakkel (A Game Dominator)🥰💥🏏💯
Agr ab bhi yaha s Pakistan haargya toh inhe pani.m dub k marjana chaiye😂
Saud helmet ka less to bandlo julta rehta hein
What a performance by young gem Saud Shakeel at the fortress of spin bowling, Galle !
Very cool no very hard celebration 🎉 from saud sakil
This is test match or t 20 😂😂, boundaries are very short 😅
Saud so disciplined player ❤❤
Soud sakeel have test average 99 he is very good better in the world than  don Bradman
Pakistani Players Is world best players
Bhai aik awaz arahi hai k pak is baaar wc mein haala machaye ga
Wi vs ind hailait
At 101-5, there is no way that I would have thought that Pakistan would have had the best part of a 150 run lead.  The last five put on about 360 runs!  Brilliant double by Shakeel.  Well played, Pakistan!  The tail wagged nicely, because When Salman Agha was dismissed, Shakeel was only on about 120.  Sri Lanka will probably end up regretting dropping him three times, because he made it count and he punished them for it.  Sri Lanka have a lot of heart but they have never really recovered from the retirement of players like Muralitharan, Malinga and others from their recent illustrious past.  I hope that they bring the next generation on soon because they are good for the game.
This match has more views than ashes highlights❤️
❤❤ saud Pakistan 🇵🇰 🎉❤❤0
Babar AZAM need to learn how to play jayasuria otherwise 1 batsman cannot win you matches
Brilliant display of batting by Saud Shakeel. The art of Test batting and batting with tailenders is on display here
Catches win matches!
When babar debuted he also lacked six hitting abilities but the management backed him and today he is an all format boss same needs to be done in case of saud and Abdullah  They both can be great odi cricketers too if management keeps backing them for a certain period of time  Abdullah is already hitting sixes but saud will develop this skill sooner too
https://youtube.com/shorts/fG_TaFwayOY?feature=share
Shakeel bhai itna achaa Q khel liya ab ap pr Bora waqt aega PCB ki taraf se best of luck
Can someone explain what was happening with Naseem's score? He was hitting 4's but his score card stayed at 1 for a long time, then it ended at 6. What was happening?
Love you Pakistan ❤
While all the fire signs and air signs fell off like dust there stood a virgo saud shakeel who took them closer to the victory thats why always respect earth signs
12:29 and 12:40 ... did anyone notice that batting style?? ❤️❤️
Everyone is talking about saud but no one is talking about naseem shah  brilliant knock h stood there like a wall and allowed saud to complete his double ton brilliant
Saud shakeel you beautiful batsmen
Well played brothers.
Aye kash Babar Azam or Sarfraz Ahmed bhi is larke ka sath dete to aaj Pakistan ka score 500+ hojana tha 😢
Insan apni height se nahi, apni performance se pehchana jata hai. Weldon Saud Shakeel 👍 Pakistan zindabad 🇵🇰
this is Pakistans to lose from here
That dropped catch will result in SL’s defeat. SL lost the match with that dropped catch of Shakeel.
Great telant saud shakeel❤
❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
🇵🇰💖
🇮🇳🇱🇰❤
Saud , saim ,Harris and dahani are great findings .....I think they deserve to be in national team
Very very surprised batting by middle order player
I dont remember when pak batter hit double century last time? Well played saud ❤
Good luck my team ❤
What a tremendous performance by the Pakistan batsmen wonderful double century by Saud Shakeel and  80 runs by Agha made it easier for Pakistan to reach the score which is a challenging one and now Sri Lanka will have to fight hard to save this match.  Match Pakistan.
This young man saud shakeel got some real talent n class
Good comeback by Pakistan   Can win from here , hope for no rain ahead
40 metre boundary 😂😂😂😂
CBA episode will be great 😅
❤
Naseem once again faced so many balls, survived and supported his teammates. He has done it before, not remember when !
SAUD SHAKEEL is a GENERATIONAL TALENT ❤
Saud Shakeel ❤ummmaaah
.
No one is talking about Salman Ali Agha who supported Saud he should also be appreciated same like Saud. 🙌🏻 ❤
🏏🏏🏏

Masha Allah Noman Ali.Naseem Shah and ibrar Ahmad good sport from Soud Shakeel.
Masha Allah Agha Sulman good innings.
Masha Allah Soud Shakeel is brilliant double hundred well played young man.
Saud shakeel...Saud Shakeel...but he actually batted 3 times...tnx to srilankan fielders...
Harry Potter biggest sixe 🙄
Saud and Salman are out of syllabus, Lankans were prepared for Baber, Shafiq and Imam.
What a comeback pakistan 😮👍🇮🇳
Kmaal beting by saud❤❤❤❤❤❤
Pakistan Zindabad
A day of Saud Shakeel. Very well played. What an innings
pakistan to gayaa ghar ke bahar ke maidan par pakistan cricket team pura bheeggi billi hay
Saud Shakeel calm guy👌👌
Saud Shakeel have great career..❤
Congrats saud shakeel,love from india❤
It's great to see Rameez Raja back in the commentary (where he belongs). 😄
Great talent Saud shakeel
If Sri Lanka lose this match they have nobody but themselves to blame to. Dropping two chances of Saud Shakeel costed them a lot...
After a long time Pakistan team is in new touch ❤
Imam Ul Haq is Pakistan in one man ……. Favoritism, nepotism , Parchi
Saud played so beautiful, proper shots against tough spin attack
Beauty of test cricket Outstanding Double hundred of saud shakeel❤ Fearless defence spin nd fast bowling attack of saud nd Naseem Well played salman nd outstanding partnership with saud shakeel  Take above saud shakeel nd  keep this performance for next inning nd further youngster👏🏻  ❤
Lund pe ehsaan nhe kiya isne double century bana ke
Indian senior players need to learn from Pakistani top cricket players ❤congratulations🥳👏 Pakistan in advance ❤🤗
Why is no one talking about Naseem? He batted very responsibly and he was the reason that Saud was comfortable scoring runs when 8 wickets were fallen.
🇵🇰🏏💙🇮🇳🏏💙🇱🇰🏏💙
Go Pakistan love from BD🇧🇩❤️
Sony LIV 🏏💛 from 🇵🇰
Misfielding costs the srilanka
Finally something to cheer for the country which is going through a lot of crisis & failures. Honestly the whole world doesn't want to see Pak as a failed state, everyone wants them to prosper just like how Saud did. Kudos Saud this is for your countrymen at this deep crisis. Lets hope they will be afford everything soon to watch u guys excel ❤.
Congratulations Saud Shakeel... What a brilliant knock it is....!!❤
“Grassed” for dropping a catch, interesting. Hadn't heard the term being used before, good to see Ramiz back in the commentary box too. Great batting by Pak BTW but WTF was wrong with SL's fielders...
Saud Shakeel What A Brilliant Batting Love From Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Thanks sony live
Nothing Just His Cast name (Malik) written on bat, And Always He showing it Calmly After every Achievement. Looking Unique celebration🔥🔥
The Way He Taken (11 Overs) For his Last 12 Runs After 188*. Shows How much he Had Hard Work Before this Series (to take Responsibility)...
MASHALLAH saud shakeel don his job very well when I see I can't stop my tires
50* Celebration = Showing (Malik) Bat, 100* Celebration = Showing Bat, 150* Celebration = Calmly Swing Bat, 200* Celebrate = Roar like his HardWork Pays off,  Saud Shaqeel🔥🔥
Mashallah laa quwata from Rizwan ❤️
This SL team is like a local club cricket team.
Saud shakeel is a great player and talented batsman

Saud shakeel 🎉🎉
Saud sheekl is a talented player❤

what a class...left handed Marnus Labuschagne...❤
Anjali Mathews 😅 dropped a sitter
Sehwag: do or die , Sachin: do till century , Rahul dravid: do till bowler die 😅🤣😂
You're matured when you realise that test cricket is more addictive than T20Is
Such a maturity and patience at this young age. Hope he stays focused after all this. ❤
Saud shakeel two catch droped 😂😂 that's why he got 200
Saud shakeel better than babar ajam
Saud❤
Saud is special. He will have average more than 100
Good batting Pakistan I am from Indian
Saud Shakeel ❤
Saud shakeel will be next fakhar zaman
Saud Shakeel you beauty. Love  and respect from🇮🇳
That 3rd run effort from Salman and running towards the danger end shows how much he wanted the century for his mate Saud Shakil.
Shakeel me  anwar nazar araha he
2 drop catches cost double century to Sri Lanka 🇱🇰
200 lead would have been better, but let's hope our bowlers take wickets tomorrow
Saud only good on these  slow pitches just look how he flopped in england for yorkshire county recently . Play saud in these conditions and asia.
https://youtu.be/Fo7ZKVAsoqQ
It's not about that he got 200, it's about how he managed to do that from 101/5 and then with the tailenders.... He is a class player and he showed it from the 1st test match of his career... He and Abdullah Shafique are the future of Pakistan test cricket... Salman Ali Agha is also very good at test cricket...
Abrar cameo was more enjoyable than saud double ton
NYC bro
Great Pakistan great cricket Pakistan..❤❤❤
Super bro
Draw is imminent
Dont forget he made look prabath jayasurya also ordinary with his foot work.. Once attack start from agha and saud he rarely bolwed flighted insted he almost pitched in good lenght thats victory for any batsmen in test match
The way he played wow if feel fantastic batting good footwork.. Love from india.. Saud shakeel u beauty 🎤🎤🏏🏏
The First Batsman I have Seen whose Average is 💯😂 Saud Shakeel is a Dark Horse ✋
Saud Shakeel The Saviour! 🥵
No ond talk about nassem shah
Woo what a brilliant player saud Shakeel he is becoming and we are hopeful to next babber Azam and must appreciate agha Salman and Naseem Shah u are the the real hero with out you I think it is impossible for saued to double hundred
Hat's off for Naseem shah for going along saud
Pakistaani ko kumar sangakara mil gaya. Open karao isse imam se kaafi accha player hai ye
I hope Sri Lanka🇱🇰 win this match & series ❤ love from India🇮🇳
Sri Lanka will win
Saud shakeel what a innings this is
A brilliant and amazing display from shakeel,salman anf naseem  Well done
Dead wicket, still playing like Australian conditions, strong against week Nations Pakistan
Congratulations for 200 run 👍
Naseem - The Wall 🥵
A proper test Batter 🛐
Impressive knock by South Shakil
Who will give credit to naseem shah
Brillant bating saud shakeel unbelievable 200 gud knock against lankan team....😎
A memorable inning
Sri lanka should have included one more spinner embuldeniya or Theekshana.  Their strength on home pitches is their spinners. No point in playing a fast bowler like Rajitha who bowls at 125 kmph .  They have put all the load on jayasuriya and mendis.
What about abrar Ahmad shorts?
Great Innings from Saud Shakeel ❤
Saud Shakeel is class and so is Fawad Alam..Shan can open with Abdullah Shafique and Babar should come at no 3..Fawad Alam can easily slot at 4 followed by Saud at 5..Unfortunately due to the crap selectors as well as the selection policies of both India and Pak, both the teams are suffering..Weird as to how a classs player  like Fawad can be dropped for one poor series..Imam should not be in the 11..he is also enjoying some priviledges just like our gr8 KL Rahul enjoys..Frankly you should be judged by your consistency, performance and temperament and not on flamboyance..this is test cricket not some circus like t20
India need srilankan player for cleaning our public toilet
Welldone saud👌💪
sri lanka looks more  beautifoool after the recession
Well played saud shakeel
200 Congratulations 🎉
Sri Lanka fielding & catching low

Saud fans ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Naseem was very good on the greace
Saud sakeel >>>>>>>rahane + rohit
Usually we have seen tailenders going for big hits, and everyone likes to hit glory shots but Naseem Shah you beauty despite having that ability to launch sixes, he blocked all day long overlooking his own will for the Team. Real fighter❤❤❤
I m from india 🇮🇳 and I enjoyed game keep it up pakishtan 🤝
Good job boys I hope Pakistan won the match saud shakal was the hero for Pakistan
What a brilliant ining by Saud Shakeel

Saud Shakeel ......    The new Gem 💎 for Pakistan.....
नसीम sah outstanding inning
Saud shakeel's avg moved to 98.50 in test He has to score 212 in his next inning to become the fastest player to score 1000 runs in test in terms of innings
Pakistan zindabad we'll Don
Saud and Salman anddd Naseem 😉what a innings..
He was ready for international cricket from 2014-2015 but the idiots denied him for 7 long years like they did to so many other talented players. Hope Saud covers up for the lost time.
Mediocre Sri Lankan team. One would expect the older beggar nation to do well against the new beggar nation.
Naseem shah batting❤💣👌
Cheetah saud shakkell ❤🎉
Very poor fielding
Big News Naseem shah Mis bah sir ka record tor diya.😂
Awesome
Well played saud Shakeel
Saud shakeel future misbah 🎉
King Kohli ❤️
Lil Shak just kept on playing 😂
This highlight doesn't show the excellence of Naseem shah
Why all the short guys are just too good at cricket?
Sometimes highlights can be so unfair wx z quite evident from the Naseem's hidden knock. The perseverance n determination shown by both the batters wz the real  highlight of the match. 🎉Saad, a long long way to go.
Soud Shakeel - what a brilliant player  ❤❤ from INDIA
Many congratulations Shakeel 🤝
Yeh test match sirf 3 logo k liyeh yaad rakha jaiga salman naseem and shkeel only beautiful 😍
chokli
how with the solid technique saud played
Naseem shah fire😅😊
sri lankan fielding is embarrassing.
Great batter SAUD 👏
Saud is hidden talent along with Salman.. I think it is time to remove shit like sarfraZ and replace it with Rizwan to make stronge batting lineup for Australia.
😮
Pakistan is now improving day by day. They have got some good players. They can win world cup with their current team
Saud Shakeel Played very Sensible inning, the  confidence level was great, his inning makes Pakistan back to the game, much appreciated ♥️✌🏻
Underrated Salman Ali agha future star
Sri Lanka was clueless against Saud Shakeel 😬
Compared to ashes,this is the most boring series.everybody seems to be relaxed and playing with little purpose in mind.
Sakeel >>> zimbabar
https://youtu.be/CvFr6SeaCKA
Let's laugh on ZIMBU 😂
Soni valo se request hai in pakistan jahilo ka match mt dikaye
Beautiful innings by Saud Shakeel
Agha and Saud shakeel looks very promising talent..hope they will get more chances in future as well..i think pakistan will whitewash lanka this time..
Sri Lanka please win Pak is terriost country
Saud shakeelll mannn you
Good and positive approach by Pakistan well done new management
12:07 Saud, Achieving a unique feat  💯👍 and that celebration from team mates🎉
Mammoth effort by a youngster
Pakistani talendars doing fabulous work in this test match 😇😇
Saud Shakeel, you beauty❤
Saud shakeel have the technique to survive on any pitches and conditions of the world if he works on his power hitting little bit then he can earn a for World Cup in india because his technique is as good as it should be to play any type of spinner he can be the middle order batter pak are looking for in ODIs
❤
Garibo ke pass light 💡 Stumps nhi hai
Saud is the only batter in this Pak lineup to have a Test Double Century and he is playing his first overseas test😮
Rizwan said mashallah la haula wala kovata it's so amazing ❤❤❤
Welcome back Ramiz raaja
Rizwan said mashallah la haula wala kovata it's so amazing ❤❤❤
Sad to see and say, SL did play good cricket in patches here and there but more or less, they have reduced to gali cricket. Unfortunate to see for the audience who really grew watching them in 90s and early 2000.
I am very disappointed by sri Lanka fielding 😢😢😢
Sakeel like sanju samson
Saud Shakeel would be king of test cricket in upcoming era , Thumbs up 👍👍
It's not easy for a batsman to defend his wicket on this extremely spinners friendly pitch and he made double ton. This inning was so special and will be remembered. nerves of steel.
Ye batting pitch hai
Naseem shah is the building block of Pakistan 😂😂
Dono ko ODI khelaya jaye
Puke-istan well played in France.
Good  knock sakeel❤❤❤
Sri Lanka poor fielding paid off
The person who will tell how many opportunity was given by sl to tatti country
Salman also deserved 100 but unwanted short need patients for test
Rain played well
Naseem shah. The new wall
.
Sakeel real score 250 because   more singles not take
Draw match
Naseem best defence so pcb give batting practice
Pakistan 🇵🇰 zindabad 🇵🇰
Remember It's Pakistan.. anything can happen..if any team can loose the match from here it's Pakistan, 😮 but let's hope for best
1Abdullah shafique 2imam ul Haq 3shan Masood 4babar Azam 5saud Shakeel 6sarfaraz Ahmed 7salman agha  Worlds best batting line  This team is win  Next test champion 🏆 ship  I think  6
Mashallah ❤❤
never heard of this guy and he scores a double century ....  umm PCB should give him more chances in tests and ODIs as he looks technically solid .... well done Saud Shakeel !
❤❤❤
Babar azam  ne  bohot  bariye khela  is  mach me 🤣🤣🤣
is rameez raja back on Commentary
❤❤
Sri Lanka dropped too many catches. Capitalized well by Pak
Good team pakistan
Saud did plqy very well but sri lanka s fielding is soooooo bad
Pakistan srilanka Westindies Bangladesh ( consider weak team and they play together)   While india, australia, NZ, ENG play together
From 101-5 to 461-10 wow 😮
Hoping to see saud vs ashwin🔥
7:13 aaaha 👌🏻
This guy is playing with an average close to 80 hope he is gonna do good in test cricket..I think after inzamam ul haq and  Younis Khan any batter played better is this man but long way to go the main test will be on SENA conditions hope he will do well
Saud shakeel is pure telent❤
But i am sure politics favouritism etc will destroy them. Pakistan's are bad people.they destroy mandirs with rocket launchers and what not!
i am not sure why they decrease the boundary length in test matches
Saud shakeel is the next big thing in Pakistan test cricket
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Saud and Salman are best middle order batsman for ODI as well..........
Shaheen kohli k samne aate hi foos ho jata h or surya k samne is bar maza aayega world cup me
Well played pakistani team
Outstanding defending of Naseem Shah❤
What a knock knock innings from Saud Shakeel❤

Bro serious respect for saud shakeel take a bow😮
2:00 best move
Wall of Pakistan Naseem Shah, how well he supported Saud
Excellent cricket by Pakistan and Saud in particular (what a talent!) who are now in a very good position! The Lankans have an uphill battle ahead of them but I hope they will take this test to the last day. They just need one or two players to step up to make this interesting. Once again, really looking forward to tomorrow's play! Cheers from a lankan fan.
6th Match:  50 =5, 100 =1, 200 = 1 Dream Start !!! More to come
The first Test will definitely end in  Draw
Playing 1980s cricket. Wake up it’s 2023 .
What a herculian effort from the young man ...Has has brilliant temprament, extraordinary technique and how he developed inning in tricky and tough phase and with tail ender too
Aghas inining is best roll in Pakistani inining
Indians be like Maro mujhy maro
Naseem shah 78 ball 6 run 😂😂😂
Unbelievable batting display from Shakeel and Salman..... What a great comeback from Pakistan... Respect from Nepal🇳🇵❤
Well played shakeel ❤, tough luck Salman and great knock by Naseem.
Naseem innings cant be described by highlights
Saheeen to aise 😂😂 confident tha ki jaise not Dhoni ho
Saud Shakeel Wohi Gali Ka larka hai jo bahut acha khelta ha or andhera hone ke baad sab ghar chale jate hai or wo bechara out nahi hota 😂❤😅 BTW Great Knock by him😍🐐🏏

Dropped catches 🤦🏽‍♂️ lucky man Shakeel
Only few Indians are appreciating the innings😂😂😂.  Typical P@jeet for you.
Saud ❤
Highlights did not do justice to Naseem shah's innings 😊
Saud is proper test batsman....grt inng 👍👍👍
7:36 Worst commentary by begherat Ramiz. Abey chootiye support your players instead of commenting he hit only one six in his career and his Only 6th match .... What a shameful character Ramiz
Outstanding knock SAUD 🥰 Love from Bangladesh
Pakistan has good talent❤
Has the pitch became docile
Hw many times Shakeel dropped by SL player....worst fielding ever !!!
Waisy umeed nai thi 461 runs banany ki...😂😂good luck Pakistan
Lankans were prepared for Babar but Saud-The Warrior came out of syllabus 🥶💙
Bhikaristani be like new Asian lara has arrived 😂😂☕☕☕
Saud Shakeel what a classic player brilliant Love from IND 🇮🇳
Who want Pak India test series
Drop a catch drop a match simple

Masha Allah
Draw the match
Hope Agha Salman innings will be remembered 😢
Pakistani stone man... Saud Shakeel🤗😍❤️❤️❤️
Poor Sri Lankan team. Clueless and giving chances to the batters. Bowling outside offstump to said shakeel was a joke.
Naseem Defender🔥🔥
208 good nahi great knock hai
Sony liv highlights >>>>>any a Other
Naseem shah the waal😅
Good innings played by Saud and looks a solid batsman but my fellow  indians who here in comments are calling it a masterclass when 2 catches were dropped if it was  virat they would have pointed out without wasting any time those dropped catches some level of hypocrisy
12:07 min, you will be able to see some  magic moment
Usne buhut mehnat ki hai bro, first-class mai, aaj woh experience kaam agya ❤
Shakeel average 💀💀💀
Saud Shakeel Shocked Srilanka 🥂
The future Star without a doubt❤
Future star of Pakistan 💪🇵🇰❤️

Saud ne babar ka eezzat bacha liya.. 😀😀😀
SL dropped 2 catches of shakeel. This is going to cost them heavily.
This unity among pakistan players will take them long wayy.. Everyone is smiling and supporting eachother well done babar and co and hats off to Saud shakeel❤
Shan masood is tatty ,why he is in even the squad
Chalo accha huwa pakistan k liye .. babar se accha player mil gaya ...

As a Pakistani so happy pak test team is find a good path proper test team ban Raha hai inshallah
Saud Shakeel's incredible feat Despite having played only six international test matches, he managed to score a double century on a pitch that was both docile and spin-friendly. He deserves all the credit for his outstanding performance 👍♥️🇵🇰
What a knock by sakeel 🏏 respect young telent. ❤️
Hope Saud can genuinely be the next great thing, this boy has technique.
As a Indian my favourite team Pakistan ❤
That is remarkable, simply outstanding innings 👍 specially when its your first innings outside your home, Congratulations 200 👏
Love ❤️ you shakeel ❤❤🎉

Poor quality of fielding by srilanka It could lead to loss of match easily
Very well played awesome double century 👏

Man o man!!  What an innings!!
Pak middle order just tear apart entire Srilanka bowling line up. Angelo Matthew gonna have some tough questions coming his way for keeping spinners on pitch most of the time. I am Indian but the game Shakeel played was just outstanding. Bravo. Way to go bro.
Waw nice batting 🇮🇳🇮🇳
Good luck shakil ♥️
Brilliant batting shakeel
Indian attendance here 😂😂😂
Why everyone is taking about Shakeel and not about agha
Going to be hard for SL to draw or win this game (if we get 2 full days), but not impossible
Saud 's knock was amazing 👌👌👌
Only pure beauty shorts 🙌💯💯💯
SS what a batteing
Not even Babar managed to score   a big Knock but Saud in this tricky pitch managed to face the Spin attack 🔥. Never felt like a Youngster...
Saud never looked like he is playing his 1st Overseas test 🥶. Batted with proper technique and Attacked well... Quality knock
Fabulous inning by saud Shakeel👑👑❤️❤️
father of India babar azam 💕🤟👏
Great knock by gantleman Saud Shakeel❤
Babar bhai jai shree ram
