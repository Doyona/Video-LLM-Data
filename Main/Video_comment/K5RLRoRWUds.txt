F1 23 announcement trailer pls
This promo was insanely chilling
How have developers not been killed by EA Sports yet??
F1 22 - Announce Trailer
i loved the cars,rules,safety car immersive good game Codemasters keep up Hasi with your wonderful tra
this halo is very annoying. puts a black band in the middle of the screen. which is of no use. your motherfuckers....vvv
remove the halo, it gets in the way a lot, I hope F1 cancels the contract with EA, just like FIFA...!!!++
Da uma força
Hello codemasters. The new F1 2022 we can buy multiple versions standard edition PS4. 69,99 Euro and the championship edition 89,99  but there is a difference in release date when I buy the standard version are we not important enough and I mean your loyal customers who buys this game every year  players with the  championship edition can play 3 day early That's not fair Different treatment so you Let your customers watching how some customers can play and some must wait that's so wrong exclusion  change that please make it equal codemasters  company also giving a message towards people Different treatment is right do you want too tell me ✊🏾✊🏻 are the first equal or is one better than the other make it for both versions of the game 6.28.22  thanks
The lobby's better work paying £75 for a game that's useless is a bit irritating 😠
los sonidos externos son muy malos, podrian por lo menos copiar los sonidos externos del auto del f1 rss o f1 sim dream de assetto corsa, son mucho mas reales
promosm
put old days cars aswell please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We need red flags!
PUT JEFF BACK IN THE GAME
MERCEDES NO  SIDEPODS
For God so loved the world that He gave His one & only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. (John 3:16-17)✝️
Oh god an EA Sports logo. That's never a good sign.
I saw someone from the internet comment that they love Modern Warfare. EA replied "we don't make that game" The guy replied "I know. You don't make good games. I was just sharing"  🤣🤣🤣
Please add red flag in this game, please solve broadcast feature in this game 🥰
Hope all the cars are the real ones and not a stickered up FOM show cars like in the trailer.
The Miami race track is it in the standard edition on ps5? And champion edition are available physically?
I was in until I saw EA. Looks like they’ll just take last years game, update the track banners to 2022 and charge you fools about $60 😂
Switch pls ty
No crossplay in 2022 game, is the least u can add to this new gen... no sense at all
I hope there will be some real sponsor's
is it on steam?
I hope wheels touching can cause cars to go airborne, it’s just more realistic
F1 for nintendo like  you agree
Bro why all the steering wheels look the same . Bruhhhh honestly wtf is or is it just a customisation
Hope the rear end of the car has realistic damage in this time. A 2000s game like Grand Prix 4, F1 Challenge 99-02 and F1 2006 have more realistic rear damage than F1 2021. Not just the rear, but the suspension too (In f1 challenge case). It's shameful to see the rear wing not coming off in a big impact while decade old games did that.
Great, a trailer with no gameplay that urges me to pre-order. Thanks EA!
DOES IT HAVE CROSSPLAY BETWEEN PC, XBOX and PlayStation? That's all we need to know!!!! That's all that matters!!
Since I saw this have VR support I've become a F1 fanatic. Haven't looked forward to a game this much in years (except for Elden Ring lol).
Please introduce cross platform! Alot of people were hoping for this to be introduced, including myself so that I could play from PC with PS5 players. Without introducing this feature there will be alot of people that don't even consider the game.
Why dont you show like f1 2021
Game is less than 2 months away from release and still no game play footage....
i hope to see red flags, pit lane starts, pre season testing and 2 player my team career mode . I pre ordered the game today so I will find out what's new soon
For the first time ever I no longer need to comment "No VR No Buy" as it's finally going to have VR! I can at last play an official F1 game in VR!
i am hyped, but i dont like the fact that it is produced bei EA. that is gonna be expensive
I’M TO SEE THE GAMEPLAY TRAILER INTRO PLEASE
I guess soon we'll have news about Formula Ultimate Team
will it available on ps 4
I just don‘t wanna get a penalty when some idiot AI or online player mazepins into me
If you guys manage to introduce realistic engine sounds in the game (electric whine of the Redbull and McLaren) this would be dope. Seriously
What a Dumb trailer  why pre  order  if we can't  see  this garbage  Probably  it sucks and nothing  to show
Ya espero tenerlo saludos desde mexico! 🇲🇽
Please add editable driver ratings pleasssseeeee 😭
I really hope that red flags and commentary comes in the game
Show us some of the game. Worst trailer I have seen since new GTA5 not expanded or enhanced trailer. Oldschool
REAL CAR  ENGINE SOUNDDDDD PLZZZZZZZZ !!!!!!
Really tempted to pre order - but refusing to do so until i see some gameplay trailers, and small features on the new additions to the game.
Ps vr support please
Well HOW ABOUT ACTUALLY UPDATING THE TRACK LAYOUTS TO AT LEAST 2021 SPEC OR 2022. You know what I'm talking about.
Hamilton should be 60 rated lmfao
Just make it hard core simulation, nothing else
i dont like thats EA controls this now.. Typical. First "trailer" pre order, but wont shot gameplay
instead of showing the game they give us a light show and a pre order. EA Verified
So from this trailler i can see that we are going to have F1 cars and then i see special effects... for an EA F1 game this is already awesome
You dont show gameplay, there are mods that have great car handeling and realisme while also coming out earlier. While (as far as I can see in screenshots) you dont even change the car models just the liverys... This is going to be a rough few years for the f1 20xx line of games...
At last after spending £160 on previous F1's we are  now getting VR why as it took this long ?
ja comprei a champions edition ja, espero que seja melhor que o 2021
Awesome
I'm excited for the VR and crossplay.  I'm terrified that it's EA. I've seen so many games of theirs completely fall off but I'm hoping they used the criticism and have helped build a great game. Codemasters have been doing a pretty good job and the F1 series is always fun to play, so I'm hoping it'll still be just as fun!
I don't know why but how they chopped up the soundtrack is so epic and builds up so much hype and anticipation, I watch it over and over so many times. I hope there will be an official version of it - I get goosebumps everytime
for the first time we can double lap Hamilton in F1 game :)
How fun would it be to have a victory lap included plus driving to your end position.
I just want vr man
Crossplay?
The prices is just another ripoff don’t fall for this trap
I just want a mazepin mode
이번에도 흑우처럼 기다립니다
What a dogshit trailer... literally no substance whatsoever.
NEVER PREORDER GAMES!  I have learned that the hard way.
mostrar teaser desses .. era melhor so postar uma foto com  a data ... pelas imagens divulgadas em fotos , o gráfico será o mesmo do 2021 , 2020, 2019 , gráfico de desenho. vocês nao jogaram gran turismo 7 ? olha qualidade da imagem dos carros, muito real , câmeras do jogo, jogabilidade refinada , simulação e tudo mais . F1 AGORA TODO ANO VIROU UM FIFA DA VIDA SO MUDA AS SKINS DOS CARROS !
SO HYPED FOR THIS LIKE IF HYPED AS WELL
I just hope the kerbs not to big and the Classic cars is back 2021game is….not perfect but not bad i give 5/10 bcuz kerbs is bad and AI sometime idiot and many bug in the game and the penalty system is also bad but good point the game is the breaking point new engine sounds every new track so not the worst game i ever played so i said thx codemaster and EA
Just looking at this preview trailer alone, I have never been this excited for a F1 game since F1 2017!   I would love to see classic cars back and also classic tracks as well, because we haven’t got these since F1 2013!
Dang I’ll be at basic training☹️
EA ?
Braking ponit s2
VR on PC, included with EA Play Pro. It already sounds like a winner. Just hope the gameplay lives up to the expectations. Can't wait
Please, bring the classic cars back.
bring classic cars back please
Pre ordered and ready for lights out and away we go on June 28 the
in career dont choose Mercedes until the first update as the team gets better during the real season your car gets the performance the real car has when the update is released
80 boullas ca fait mal
I don't expect anything less than Unreal 5 realistic graphics.
With friends at Voicely, can't wait for the release of the games. *-*
Mir wäre es auch wichtig das ich Spieler melden kann, die Müll auf der Strecke machen wie zum Beispiel mich abschießen oder extra auf die bremse hauen und was es noch so gibt. Ich denke das so vielleicht mehr spaß an online rennen hast. Ich weiß das es die rang listen rennen gibt aber da finde ich kaum eine lobby mit 5 Autos, von daher bin ich gezwungen in erstellte lobbys zu fahren...

It’s funny how it specifically on Canada Day
they add supercars but no liveries editor....come on
Pls add pit stop
Ok but seriously EA can this have anything close to the amazing battles, rules and customizations the real F1 has... Like damn add a helmet camera or smth- even the classic cars would be nice... Please.  Make. A. Good. GAME
Pitcoins? No thank you. Not gonna support another rip off with microtransactions no matter how much I love F1.  In Forza, Formula felt more real than in any F1 game
is this the same as manager 22
imagine experiencing the porpoising in VR!
Please make the radio communication sound and feel more authentic and realistic instead of sounding like studio recorded dialogue - the same goes for the bits of commentary and the press interview voices. I'd also like to see a sequel to Braking Point, the story mode was fun. Could be a longer and more dramatic story, I'd love to see it.   Other than that, general AI improvements, realistic penalties, slightly toned up graphics (I know that they're going for a semi-sim system and most sims can't focus on graphics due to the sheer amount of systems and calculations in the background)
But will it have crossplay ?
They should add old tracks from previous games, like malayasia
I hope with EA as publishers, they can push for an even better for the purists but also create a brand new arcade mode for fans that don't have wheels and all that extra stuff. We would love to just drive these cars in our own little game mode (better controller/mkb support and far less inputs needed). Wouldn't hurt at all and it would increase sales.
*shows nothing* “please preorder” yeah no thanks I’ve seen what EA have done with countless other series
WHIPPED CREAM & Jimorrow - Light of Mine
nintendo switch? :)
Need team orders. Won’t buy it if you didn’t include it in this game
I hope Jeff will get some new lines when crashing and more realistic crashes
The last thing i am going to do is preordering a game that is published by EA. You guys have a "track record" for publishing unfinished crap.
Please don’t be £70 for the standard game 😂
It better have porpoising I want my vision to be shot after every race
YES ITS VR COMPATIBLE only thing i wanted to know :)
Oh my God, Jeff!
I love the Codemasters F1 games but I gotta say,  why should I pre order a game when I haven’t even seen gameplay yet?🤨
Hopefully also My Team is again included
Codemasters: It doesn't get much more arcade than this. EA: Hold my beer.
Even Mazepin's bahrain GP was longer than this
CAN DO THE GAMEPLAY TRAILER
I Hope they gonna add classic cars
As it’s EA, it’s now ten quid per pitstop
Looking forward to relaunching my channel on the 1st of July! Got to figure out what to do during the offseason. Maybe add another racing game.
pls dont be EA is so expensive
Erm... K. :/
people need to learn to read it says ANNOUNCE trailer thats all it is
Qué mierda es ésta?
Is this one gonna be $90 and ad bad as last year's or you gonna keep ignoring us and make another cash grab
F1 2021 con + brillo = f1 22
this game has sucked ever since EA took over
If this is another Crapmaster lazy attempt then i will easily skip this game.
Arcade game
Eeeee aaaa spooooorts
Now featuring ultra-realistic, brain rattling, porpoising physics 🐬
Should be just a dlc, it is the same game with an update. Rip off.
Is it for ps4
Fancy socks in F1! yeah
VR=buy
EA will milk this dry
Here we go boys! Another F1 game here comes the hype train.
Let's gooooooooo!!!!
Please add F3 in this game!
Cross platform needs to happen. EA need to be the ones at the forefront of innovation, yet they still don’t support cross platform in their games 🤦🏻
nice teaser trailer.
No gameplay trailer and edited by EA ? No thanks won't preorder.
We Want VR on PlayStation too
No actual gameplay released; but we're taking your pre-orders now! Also, there is a special 'Champions Edition', that locks certain content behind a paywall, for no other reason than to squeeze a little more money out of you to give to our hard working game developers.  Just kidding, we're gonna underpay them and stuff our own pockets with your money.  Love, your trusted EA executive.  PS: Make sure you pre-order the game before May 16th, or you'll lose out on some limited time content😉.   TLDR version: Just bend over a little further, please, we're not deep enough yet.
If the news about the new handling mode and VR are true, then the community should thank EA for listening to the us. We suffered from years and years of arcade-boy games.
How about good destruction for once???? Rear wing falling off, tires being actually blown off?? PUT SOME IMMERSION INTO THSI GAME. F1 2002 HAD BETTER DESTRUCTION THAN MODERN F1 GAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Whats the Miami Content Box?
YOUR GAMES ARE TOO EXPENSIVE
If the cars are not porpoising on the straights in the game, it’s not realistic enough for me!
Codemasters cares about quality.
But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.   (1 Peter 4:7) - It's the last time. The Lord is coming soon. Believe in Jesus, repent and be saved.
Auguri
As we know from the leaks there is nothing new so its wont be good :/
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Hey yall 🙂 how yall doing? 💪💯🔥🔥 if anyone wants to do a collab I'm down to I'm not that good but I'm trying 😂 I appreciate yall reading this and hope you have a better day then before reading this much love y'all 💙💪💯🙏🔥💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Dont Pre Order
crossplay?
Que maravilla ❤️
You’re gonna turn this into a FIFA and Madden game aren’t you? You’re gonna kill this franchise as well…definitely won’t be buying if it smells fishy
few ideas for free: - actual dual analog clutch support in order to make starts more realistic. Getting a target rev from an engineer would also be quite nice - like you can hear on the radio in a real training session and then use it in starting procedure. - instead of dumb F1 Life or whatever, where you're gonna put NFTs or some other stupid monetization scheme, allow player to 'walk' the track and mark reference points to be used so that one can actually get some useful assists when trying to learn racecraft.
F1 games are literally not playable online. Hope this year it’s different.
Oh this is nice. A brande new F1 2022, more challengers and stuff to do. HOWEVER, it is EA.  But I would like to see a finished game with no garbage season pass. If games follow EA business model, next year we will add our credit card to buy tyres, fuel, pit stops, champagne and tickets to play the game. pff
Oh yea
It's EA, so loot crates and in game currency will rule over gameplay and customers. Hard pass. Never buying EA games until they stop sucking.
EA Tag on it maybe 90% a scam
and as you can see, you see nothing. best trailer ever
I hope crossplay
Definitely wait for a sale for this one, by then they'll have ironed out most of the major bugs that'll be there at launch and will have patched the car performance. Absolutely no reason to pay the full EA tax for an unfinished product that they've phoned in.
Do people know what an announcement trailer is what did you expect gameplay cause that’s a features trailer
classic F1 cars??!
Ea is known for their cash grabbing strategies in games. I hope this isn’t going to be a thing in this game. I hope there’s more car customisation in online mode n career mode
I hope to see the classic f1 cars until 2012,please!
Someone feels really suspicious about opening pre-orders before showing any in game footage, let alone actual racing
...thrash. Maybe if free, maybe.
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.                       /...
Can we get a half-decent chase cam?
We all want to gamer the game be more realistic than possible, Unreal Engine games 5 graphics with graphics technology, cool all the circuits available 2021 will be 2022, real complete story more realistic than possible F3 then f2 in F1, many novelties... Etc, more advanced weather more realistic than possible, tire is more realistic wear etc auto behaviors, more sharp auto settings except removed auto adjustable auto help .. Either we adjust 100%, last thing Career Mode 100% As championship 2022 long race calendar and sprint in the calendar with the 2021 circuits.
After the disaster last year i will certainly not pre order this game lmao.
I want instead of arcade gameplay more sim gameplay like you see in Asseta Corsa Competizione.
There better be red flags
Virtual Reality! Finally....
F1 the people who see no shame in competing in Qatar? 😂
have you changed the wanka accents in the whole game and used different nationalities, changed the fact you can't fire people in My Tram mode or the fact that wanka talks to you like you're an employee, even though you own the team? Is there gonna be actual car parts customization? If no, I'm not interested
We want the old cars back like the Jordan 191, and The Ferrari F1-2000, We also need F2 but not only F2... we need F3 added as well. And I'd love to see the tracks laser scanned, once you do it once you wont have to do it again for the next 10 years or so.. please, and let us choose track configurations... Like the options to remove the Monza chicane and Barcelona chicane (probably will be updated this year anyways) but you know what i mean.
Where gameplay??
This would've been a good trailer..... for the F1 2022 Show Car that is.
Why are people hating on this? It says in the title, announcement trailer. Its not a gameplay trailer or anything. They had a countdown for the reveal, and its revealed. They also said they will post more in the coming days/weeks etc. There will ofc be a gameplay trailer. This ain't it
Game for Android?????
Do not preorder any games. Next gen of micro transactions is comming
They should add an F1 Jukebox, which would be cool to listen to all of the F1 Soundtracks from 2015 to now i think that would be my favorite feature in F1 22
2 player online trophy will stop me from buying this game.
May you please make a wider availability for the game like for example  and especially my own country UGANDA
I'll just wait a year for it to be on gamepass
Hâte de faire nos premiers tours sur le circuit de Miami, et l'an prochain sur celui de Las Vegas 😍
Pre-Order to get a broken game, just like BF 2042.
I wish for crossplay with my friends.
Honestly I'm more excited for F1 Manager than a re-skin of F1 2018 for the 5th time
4k @ 30fps..... 🤦‍♂️
I hope developed podium ceremony and national anthems and also longer braking point story
What a nice game trailer. I'm so Excited to play this new game 😍😂💪
Remember kids.  Never pre-order a game, especially if it's released by Electronic Arts.   No Satisfaction GUARAN(T)GReaD.
Why are we unlocking supercars and clothing for a hub?  Why are you not focusing on ON-TRACK features?  F3 cars? A 10 year career mode gets more immersive with F3-F2-F1 progression. Gives you even more young drivers to choose from in My Team as well and provides real longevity.  Let’s have a better and more interactive race engineer with different vocals, options and race strategy tweaks.  Let’s have the option for Pit Lane starts. Quick tyre changes in practice and qualy. Red Flag grid starts.  League Racing integration. That’s where your long term players are! The ones who will be playing right up until F1 2023. Manage your league in game and have more options for race weekend formats, race length and rules and points scoring! Perhaps the ability to export your race results for those who track on Excel.  Better broadcast cameras for leagues who stream and commentate?  There were so many incredible game play mechanics you could have announced to please long term players of the series, and push the game closer to authentic F1 racing.  Instead you went for Unlock some watches, sunglasses and supercars via podium pass and an online store 😩😤🙄👏
Let's hope they don't disappoint us. Am expecting a lot from them
finally i can complain about trash connection multiplayer again
Please fix the penalty system, it's just insane. 5 grid penalties for being rear ended by AI.
Remember no pre orders
Series x and ps5 not getting an exclusive next gen game again why did we bother upgrading?
@Fexalan    Fex calm down okay.
My Team co-op or no buy.
Hope you've work on the graphic side this time...
Really hope you guys added the porpoising!!
WOAH, WE SAW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, THANK YOU EA
No actual gameplay in an announcement trailer of a game releasing in a couple of months is pretty poor. Fingers crossed for the game itself though.
F1 22“ wow you can really see EA took over…
I will but it as you put the VR !! First time that I will buy a f1 game, I cant wait with all the animations like pit stop ;)
Please make it easier for controller players to play :)
A pro league where the grid is made up of only real live players. No bots.
Still the old ass engine? Or Frostbite?
can you fix the penalty system? if i lock up and have no choice to skip a corner i shouldn’t get a 2 second penalty
I just hope there are more tracks than the seasonal tracks
The trailer gave me such a "Speed Racer" vibe with this aesthetic style 😂 I'm hyped
I know its not the real trailer yet but fucing props to them for making it 4k even disney with their Marvel films cant do that properly :(
I cant wait to see them take place at belgium and abu dhabi
I'll bet it'll be a hoot to play when it comes out I already pre ordered my copy already.
Let's hope this doesn't have 5346 major bugs failing gameplay like f1 2021 and that they have reworked AI so they actually drive with you and not you among them, f1 2021 AI was more like wreckfest then f1 drivers...
Man, I'm excited for the game, but the soundtrack in this trailer was actually incredible. I wish that there was a full version. I'd totally listen to it.
Let me take a guess. It will look just like 2021, 2020 and 2019?
THIS TRAILER IS SO.... WTH!!!! WTH IS WHAT THE HELL!!!!
this trailer is such a mood  hope the game lives up to it
Hope to see track creator in the next games
Hope to see old tracks and old cars back, more customisation, and co op career with more than 2 players
New name, New Cars, New Era
Time for EA to ruin another franchise, nice.
I hope to see the red flag, penalties that make sense, the artificial intelligence that crashes on its own and that some bugs are fixed online
I set my expectations low, but this? This was impressively underwhelming.
Same graphics engine from the last 6-7 years I assume?
Hope to see old tracks and old cars back, more customisation, and co op career with more than 2 players
I hope we can finally get classic tracks or DLC tracks beyond the official calender we have asked for this very long time now. They missed circuits during the pandemic.
A new season, a new car and a new circuit excite fans of the F1 series.
Get ready bitches y’all going to get smoke 💨
I set my expectations low, but this? This was impressively underwhelming.
Wow. I expected very little. But this is a whole new dimension...
nice, we see pictures of a generic car that I could see all over F1 winterbreak. I can't wait for this, good job Codemasters/EA
Everything new! OMG! I can't wait!
As long as they give us red flags and don’t give a penalty to you when ANOTHER DRIVER HIT YOU, then this game will be gold! I also hope they continue the Braking Point story, they did that really well.
New name, New Cars, New Era
I still have that "Hmmm, I wonder?!" vibe with EA linked titles.  I skipped both F1 woke 2020 and F1 100% price increase 2021 DLC... 2022 - I'll wait.
One thing that I am intrigued is if  Porposing is a effect that can happen in the game
Crossplay please?
Hope F1 22 doesnt kill the F1 series like Madden NFL 13.
The best things to really kickstart the new F1 era in this years game would be to add : custom helmets, more sponsors for my team, custom liveries, bodywork / chassis options to make the car look and handle more to your liking. A “ Team Relationship “ stat would be nice for Driver Career. Better damage models and the ability to porpoise if the car is set up wrong.   Even just a few of these would make the game damn good
Wait it's EA now? Codemasters aren't developing F1 games anymore?
The graohics gonna be nuts thanks to ea, (so will the prices)
Everything new! OMG! I can't wait!
F1 now will be like FIFA games..
PLEASE RELEASE ANOTHER MICRO MACHINE PLEASE
The only thing that has my attention is Codemasters but even still nothing was shown :/
I hope you make PSVR full support, please !
Exciting, cannot wait for tomorrow!   Wish the engine sounds would get a bit of a revamp though, I watched a MOD of the Redbull in Assetto Corsa recently and it sounded AMAZING! <3
Hope to see old tracks and old cars back, more customisation, and co op career with more than 2 players
For the love of God please return to the Mac 😂
A new season, a new car and a new circuit excite fans of the F1 series.
Does anybody know if there going to have co-op story mode again because I love that in 21, getting my son into racing games and him being my rival team driver has been a dream come true! I didn't know how else to get him into the sport because kids at his age usually don't have the attention span to watch racing unless there behind the wheel ;)
Pre-order? Order what? EA, you're not gonna take my money like that
I hope they change the engine sound cause the current ones sound very unrelistic
From the little preview it sounds like a new engineer RIP Jeff Never was there a man of more heroics
That's Why It's Called F1™ 🏎️
How Much Real Money To Pay For In Game Fuel ? And Tires ?
Commentators like in fifa would be cool to have in the replay mode, with before race cutscenes and driver line up included in the replay. Also manual pitstops, red flags  would be neat.   You know my requirement  Codies
Heard this game evolved. It's so realistic now that it comes with "Human Error" steward's decisions
Do you really think someone cares about career mode or new cars or ugly liveries ! Of course NOT ! F1 2021 is the worst game ever as multiplayer is awfull and the game is dead imo. Hope to see real multiplayer layout and strong development for online lobbies otherwise I will have have zero interest to buy the game… quality of multiplayer, online lobbies, ffb and handling count %99,99 of my evaluation.. I dont care about career mode, new cars etc at all! Hope we will have a real multiplayer mode and strong online lobbies with f1 2022 again !!!
Nothing interesting here,  nothing explained.
Failed To Pre-Order. Error Code: NS7.
What we know: F1 22 will have VR support on PC, this pretty much confirms they are keeping wheel support which there were some doubts over since EA took over  There will be a brand new handling model F1 Life is confirmed, you will be able to collect super cars, unknown if you will be able to drive them though Next gen console support obviously Miami will be added as a track presumably replacing Sochi which will probably not be in the game  Release date 1st July if you preorder the champions edition you can play on 28th June The standard game costs £50 the champions edition costs £62 on steam if you buy it now
As long as they give us red flags and don’t give a penalty to you when ANOTHER DRIVER HIT YOU, then this game will be gold! I also hope they continue the Braking Point story, they did that really well.
we need a new graphic engine in this new generation for example the unreal engine and physics that adapt to the rest of simracing games for example assetto corsa competizione, tracks scanned from real life and that please the vehicles are faithful to real life
That thing you don't like about yourself is what makes you really interesting.
Finally a new engineer system that actually encourages you and give you more detail?
I feel disappointed for some reason already
Can someone explain to me the reasoning behind releasing a new game every year? Wouldn't it make more sense to make a new game every time there is a huge redesign of the cars like from 2021 to 2022? Seems like just a money grab to make a new "title" thats pretty much the same game as the previous one with minor updates and call it a new game.
Oh sheee
Can't wait to meet Jeff again for like the sixth time or however many it's been 😅
Hell Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssss
Hope the new handling is controller friendly
Didn’t the other game just came out or is this the management side of the game
I want a better Cockpit view where like the helmet cams and also for the wheel to show differnt options
Won’t buy any ea game ever micro transactions are there bread and butter on a £60 standard game joke company
Well that was completely pointless. So this was like, what - an announcement to let us know at some point there will be an actual announcement?
F1 Ultimate Team?
I'm going to preorder this as soon as possible. EA is the best game developer/publisher on earth.
Better graphics is a must, 2020-2021 are the same and I have a series X.
20 seconds of nothing!! 😂 😂 Wtf
Please add the 2014 Mercedes
Announcement trailer and no gameplay but can pre-order LMAO
So...this is it? The new car and thats it?
Oh well. Another thing that EA is going to destroy. Can’t wait 😍
Full live time table is the only things I want
Imagine if we had a possibility to make own calendar in My Team/Career mode using also some older tracks like Sepang, Buddh, Yeongam, Istanbul Park, Nurburgring, Fuji, Magny-Cours... all these tracks even as DLC...
again nothing important :D 😂😂😂
no change in any f1 game xD when u played one u played them all xD or at least from 2020 forward
What I Want: More Options for Your Racing Engineer Red Flags Realistic Crashes  Realistic Barriers That Catches You, Not Pushes You Back  AI that would make mistakes and would crash naturally Reporter Actually Giving Decent Questions and You Having A Variety of Answers to Respond To THem RED FLAGS PLEASE! Virtual Safety Car Rear Wing Damage That Shows Car Damage That Actually Shows Rather Than It Being Just The Tyres and The Front Wing Classic F1 Cars Some Circuits That Are Not In The F1 Championship (Like Malaysia) Each Team Has A Different Race Engineer (Keep Jeff Though)     What I Probably Wont Get: Everything On My Wish List
Put Commentary in the game like in F1 Championship Edition
Wtf this isn't anything
Wow...what a trailer. Wait and see I guess
Good game, Please make a Korea version to many korean player !!!
Will it be on Xbox one?
VR on PC?! Well damn I might actually have to buy this one.
Does it simulate porpoising?
I wish change only nose😮
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
no precinho hein
I predict this will be very underwhelming.
EA sports 🤦 probably be crap like recent maddens and no fixing to bugs, I hope I'm wrong.
Is this crossplay?
Finally Mindblowing Virtual Reality!!  The way it should be to stop watching a 2D monitor screen, and be literally inside the cars :)
I won't pre order anything until they show us some gameplay and so on. F1 21 is a pure disaster when it comes to the online races which I can't understand coz f1 20 felt relatively good. I hope the new game will at least be stable when it comes to connections and so on.... don't mess it up again when you already had a good Game :(
頼むぞバグ治してよ笑
Yasss
We want crossplay!!
PRE ORDER NOW SLAVE
do not pre order.
Una mierda el trailer. Muestren gameplay
20 seconds video of nothing,pls pre order...
Please atleast make the crash physics more destructive and realistic
I really want classic cars back please ! I’ll even pay for them as a dlc please bring them back !
I hope redbull in this game have reliable machine
Red flag pls 😐
LOL preorder now
Notas del equipo de marketing para el lanzamiento:  Trailer 1: "Pre-Compra el juego". Fin.
This looks like a fifa trailer with "f1 22" slapped on it. Hope it won't be the fifa of f1
so,…. when’s the real trailer?
EA is always a red flag but let's wait and see.
The trailer seems very engaging...!!
No F3?
Hope to laser scanned tracks
Wonder if they'll release this without voice chat and a scoreboard as well.
I just want better crash animations. A bit more like beamng.
meanwhile forza motorsport 7 that came out 5 YEARS AGO:
Please don‘t mess this up EA
Hopefully online works this year !
je m'attendais a rien mais je suis quand meme deçu
I hope we see real, pure graphics, situations and enjoyable F1_______ Good luck codemaster -- EA sports
I'm personally gona wait for F1 23, I doubt that the cars in this game will be semi accurate to the real ones because it hasn't been a year.
Do we get a proper porpoising simulation?
The thing,I'm praying to not happen is EA making the same F1 Gameplay Each year like they did to FIFA
No vr for hp g2 is a no buy
Pre-order now wtf you didn't even show footage of the game, on what basis should I pre-order the game 😂
In his career mode they need to add a calendar, because the way it is it looks like F1 runs 21 weeks straight.  something so basic that I had to have it since F1 2010 and they haven't done it until now.
Clicked onmthis faster than my girlfriend saying shes home alone
let us customize helmets more so they feel more real life like putting a driver number on them sponsorships depending on the team you race for etc also it would be awesome if we could customize the grid in a career mode like so we have drivers like Senna,Schumacher or Mansell to make it much more interesting these are not big changes but they would help the game and make community feel more happy spending money on it and to all the pilots out there have a nice day
24 hour wait for that?  There is no game play footage at all.  What a let down
Gucia
If they could just fix the Ego dumper crash that would be nice, so i can finally play more than 3 laps
Crazy how little they're adding
0:16 "shut up"
No point in releasing a video that shows nothing...
I really hope u see red flags penalties more tech difficulties like in real life no way in hell u make it a whole season with out those and most of all add punctures to the game I'd someone's wing clips my back tire how do it not puncture
This looks special already
Hope the new career will be more realistic, but also this the most important thing is to make the gameplay more realistic, like red flags and realistic restarts,will be a new type of Game!
Are we going to see the purpoising effect too? 😂
👀👀
Hopefully they actually have decent engine sounds this time.
For everyone freaking out about how underwhelming this is just chill for a sec this is still early, it's only an announcement so it's not like they're doing a full blown trailer for that yet and if they want to draw more people in its better this be the trailer so we dont see any unfinished textures and stuff like that which will only turn people away I'm fine with this and I'll make my judgement when the full trailer comes out but calm yourselves jeez
I better preorder incase they run out of digital copies.......
Oh My God 🥰 ! The new cars 😍! F1 Lover ♥️ 🏎
No VR no buy. On the other hand they said it will have VR this year. It goes both ways, VR and I'll pay for it right now!!
Bring back the classics cars, add the classics tracks and etc
Copy, paste 2022.
Thanks EA to ruin another game like FIFA
Preorder 😂😂😂
We need classic cars
the reflections kind of look like those in ACC
Id like to thank all the suckers who buy the game on launch (or god forbid preorder it) so that EA can sell it to me the week before the 2023 F1 season on steam sale for $10 bucks agian 👍
Very nice editing
vr pls
Why does this remind me of the security breach fnaf trailer xD
Give us extra tracks to customise our own calendar each season. Cant be difficult to bring tracks like nurnburgring, hockenheim, Istanbul park back. Which has been on earlier F1 games made by Codemasters.
Why did you hype a big release/launch? This is just a crappy trailer. It’s not even really a trailer…. just a disappointing time waster
it comes out when its my birthday yooo
can't wait for the fitgirl repack
Cross platform???
A proper penalty system for online play please. There are currently no punishment for ruining people's races
be scared, it had no mention of F2
will the cars in the game porpoise?
Kkkkkk vai se engraçado o carro da Mercedes no jogo
Hopefully classic cars are back
Si no hubiesen presentado nada hubiese tenido más emoción su juego, lástima más de lo mismo
YES VR
Let's hope for more realistic handling then! The games always feel a bit disappointing compared to sims. Would be so much more fun - and it would not even have to be more difficult or punishing to be a lot more enjoyable, keeping the casual players in!
Please have career mode go longer than 10 seasons.
Hopefully the Mercedes porpoises like crazy in the game 😅
Will the Miami GP only be available for F123?
with EAs grimy paws on it, 0% chance im preordering
I hope to be able to drive the safety car
F1-22, that graphic style... This is starting to have a FIFA look that I'm not quite sure I like
i’ve always wondered how you get so many safety cars? is it a mod? when i play i rarely get IA mistakes (79 difficulty) if anyone knows could they please let me know. thanks
Copy/paste again?
Let’s goooooooooo
Pre order a game that we haven’t shown any game play of.  Yeah no thanks EA.
Worst Trailer ever!
Racing redefined - makes reskin of the previous game
Good to know handling model is being updated but if the physics remain the same then we haven’t moved forward, also FFB and road/curb effects need massive improvement.
bring it to the nintendo switch please!!!!!!
Classic F1 circuits and cars, please
Great gameplay
This trailer's been epic. Thank you, I'm considering to buy it
Trailer Mercedes F1 W13?, SHAME! .....BHA!!!
yea, but Reiza did it already, with outstanding VR btw
RED FLAG PLEASE
Finally got really bored of f1 2021
Looks mega role on 1st of July not that far off actually.
Pre order what? We haven’t seen 1 second of the product!
Wait this real??
Chissà se siano riusciti ad emulare il porpoising
what a shizz trailer that was
Have like the real life details with ages right for the drivers, chioce of agents, make like real life yeah ffs, played all these f1 games since DAY 1 , Not impressed at all tbh
VR, Finally!
the ambience really reminds me of nfs shift 1
Please do Crossplay. So many People want that🥺
Trailer looks soo great but I hope the gameplay is good
0:11–0:12  Is it just me that heard that bass and thought fo the old f1 intro song bc it sounds the same ish
top
Imagine you choose a car and based on the car you experience porpoising as well.
more helment customisation like liveries and penalties that make sense would be nice
ıts so expensive 😓😓
If this is good I'll be happy if you make nascar games again
Cross-platform multiplayer?
New era.... ps4... mmm.. ok...
Very Anti Climatic Trailer is it so bad since EA bought you out look ill give it the benefit of the doubt since its announcement trailer maybe not proper trailer yet
Imagine if they mad it into an actual sim... added cross play. high hopes
I don`t care about the car all i care about is that the damn wheels when you crash the wheel don`t just have that stupid black wire holding it and just going around
please have races with commentary it would add so much more to racing
Please add the historical cars such as F2004 or the MP4/4!!
EA = Microtransactions to make pitstop etc etc
I beg you please update the circuits with all the changes they've had over the years, it's disappointing when the official F1 game has more outdated versions of the circuits than other games :(
Yessssss
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!!!!!!
Wishlist  1- Sensor handling system for those that don't have Steering Wheels  2 - 2players splitscreen with Championship mode  3 - manual pitstops  4 - AI that crashes and makes mistakes  5 - tracks replicated accurately
I hope they make the engine sounds more realistic. Other than that, from this and the document they released, its sounding to be like an awesome game
pls let keyboard users drive again
I hope there is a Safety car and formation lap in split-screen. Also, I hope there are red flags, and SC when someone loses power and stops on track because in the 2021 game, there are no safety cars. It only happens in collisions
this EA we're talking about, don't bother getting your hopes up lol..
We need Crossplay now
New cars, new era, same tracks, same bugs, same features, same gameplay, same engine, same physics, and same price
Please have crossplay
ONE THING IVE WANTED FOR EVER…IS MANUAL CONTROL IN THE PITS. And red flags. If we don’t have either of those things Codemasters hate it’s people and followers
Let's hope EA hasn't destroyed the game to much with their greediness
For the love of god, please give us the option to actually "design" our cars, by selecting a variety of different Parts, so it won't look like a Show Car and actually somewhat unique.
we're coming back on F1 22
thumbs down, what a joke
UPDATE KERBS PLEASE
Codemasters please make a NASCAR game
I LOVE IT!
Wow new cars??!? Really?!?! OMG, that was unexpected 🙃  Could you say anything we don't know yet, please? It's obvious that we will have new cars, just like reality. It's not a new feature.
Why this game don't have Russian language I'm from Ukraine but I speak and playing in Russian
So basicly its a car reveal a month in the actual season or what?
Crossplay???
You should have the option to have two real drivers in your team career and it should be from the perspective of a team principle.
Hoffentlich bekommt der Karriermodus mehr Tiefe und wird SPANNENDER...
Will it have Miami already or do we have to wait months for it
yesyesyesyesyes
the only thing I really want is the bouncing phenomenon for the new cars XD just kidding I really hope for some more realistic car physics, especially the force feed back should be improved.
Only serious ea sport game
When can we have a Nintendo Switch version?
Como alguém consegue dar like nesse vídeo kkkkkkkkkk
The music with headphones 😵‍💫
Isso aqui só pode ser uma zueira sem tamanho hahahahaha
This is stupid.... nothing on this is compelling enough to pre order... where is crossplay showcase? And some features... is this the best EA can come up with for launch on pre order? WOW disgusting
EA Please for the love of god add classic cars 🥺
IF this doesn't have realistic proposing, i am not buying it
EA уничтожит эту франшизу до конца, из хорошего симулятора будет неплохой симулятор с дохуищем доната по типу лут-боксов. Эхххх, обидно :(
🤣 all the console boys be butt hurt about no VR. Bahahahahahah   Get a PC.
pls can we have better physics
Por favor q tenha opções de customização de carroceria como mais bicos para o carro e não só mudar a pintura
The #F122 will be released on #DanielRicciardo's 33rd birthday.
For years, I've been waiting for 3 huge items to be addressed before buying this game again.  The first is VR support.  Great to see we're getting that. The other two are League focused issues.   1. Will we be able to use the Equal car setting in single player with any car?  This is key for practicing in your assigned car for leagues. 2. Will we get an option to force cockpit for online races?  Alternate views offer a huge/unfair advantage. Note I said league, and not multiplayer in general.  I want these to be options, and not mandatory for all online races.  I know not everyone wants to be racing in cockpit view. Thanks!
Fix track limits please
They seriously had a countdown for 30 seconds of nothing.
What's the catch EA? Is fuel going to be in loot boxes?
Надеемся, держим кулачки
it’ll be 2026 until they laser scan spa
PSVR !!?  😡
I hope the commentary from F1 2006 is back
No preorders!
Can we have a soundtrack list from artist just like FIFA ?
If the trailer from EA is good.. that means the game will be bad.
Is it just me, or does F1 22 sound completely wrong and incomplete compare to F1 2022?
I ain't pre-ordering unless I see real gameplay footage.
Okeey lets go
Remember fellas, this is EA so don't preorder 👍
Where is VR? No VR no money!
Please add a safety rating, online races are reckless turn 1 lap 1.
Can not WAIT for this. PLEASE EA do NOT ruin this for us.
Is this real?????????
This is a joke?
Can't wait for this Porpoising gameplay!!!
Released the weekend of the British GP
Crossplay?
As long as they give us red flags and don’t give a penalty to you when ANOTHER DRIVER HIT YOU, then this game will be gold! I also hope they continue the Braking Point story, they did that really well.
Wow, what a underwhelming trailer. Nobody should pre-order without seeing gameplay
Absurdly expensive considering 2021 was already not worth the cost, yet 2022 doubles it. Come on, EA.
Another Year Same Bad Arcade Game with Awful Physics and Sound hahah
"F1 Life" it's becoming like NBA2K hard pass 😆
One thing i would like the most is the realistic barriesrs physics
F1 2021 Announce Trailer: "You want respect, you give respect!"  F1 2022 Announce Trailer: C A R
You guys are distorting league racing
Awesome let's pre-order when there's no gameplay because we're stupid.
i can't wait to test this virtual car on track.
do not preorder this  do not preorder any EA game ever
I have many issues with the series, which have been essentially copy pasted for the last 3 years, with no bug fixes but one of my biggest gripes with this series is the mid season release. Means basically 5 months of playing a game that is current before the next season starts and the game has expired in its realism. The F1 team should follow the NBA 2K team and release BEFORE the season starts so it means people will play along with the season as it progresses. I have bought all F1 games since 2013, and this is the first one i probably will skip, as the last one left such a bad impression on me.
scam
This better be the best F1 game
I'm amazed to hear this, because I was wondering, on whether this would be made with F1 Manager also in the works.
Nice will it have Ray Tracing?
Se me antoja más que gran turismo 7
next DLC?
so THAT is what the countdown was for??? what an anticlimax
new era of cars but probably built for last gen consoles first.
Trailer summary: JULY 1, 2022
That's it? No gameplay?
Counting down for EA to ruin the game :(
IMPROVE ENGINE SOUNDS
rip Jeff may I never hear your voice again
One of the bad sides of this is the release date, i think should be alot more early than july, almost mid season irl...
Ein nichts aussagender Trailer! 👏🏻
Bring back emma,we miss her pissed off face when we kept dnf
LETS GOOO
Please have Miami and Qatar on this one
Please can we make it so if you hit someone’s tire it realistically comes off like for instance how max’s tire came off when Hamilton hit his tire at silverstone
I hope this time they put more flexible walls and softwall, the current walls look like titanium
I swear if this game will be not better than the last two than I will go back to F1 2019.
Woaahhh. That tells me bugger all doesn't it
Hope it has the Vegas track
is there going to be porpoising? hope so
4 player career mode pls 😍
this isn't a trailer its a teaser..... I just want to see a bit of a lap
Cool down lap would be Amazing and bring back classic cars
OMG VR!!!!!!!!!! YESSSSSSSSSSSS
Finalmente VRR!!
LOL EA you want me to pre-order off that? HA what pumps the stock market
I can't wait to see that the safety car is still a big mess and desync all over bots players still wrecks everyones races
Well that was majorly disappointing.....
und schon alle fleißig vorbestellt?? :D Battlefield 2042 lässt grüßen :DD
And the game?
Do car Will Do porpoising :p
Almost 5k views but 16k likes????
worst trailer ever
yes
thats on my birthday.
the fact that it is called F1 22 and not F1 2022 is scaring me
Hope it gets real triple screen support this time. I wont buy it otherwise
a teaser, not a "trailer", that invites you to pre-order. Nice
I hope we get extra tracks and classucal cars and not supercars and watches
Gamepass day 1 please
I am telling you now if you release this game in the same state as the WHOLE of this year's game you will not recover from it I have played the games since 2010 and this one has just broken me. I can't play another broken mess of a game.
you could just upload this under the name cinematic render or fan made render...
I m still playing 2013😭
Pagar 350 reais na versão de PS5 é um assalto.
Will there be a beta?
EA better not ruin this series like all the others they touch
looks like a fifa trailer so it looks s**t
😎👌
2022.04.21.                          18:10
Please make a better lobby system ffs… like in COD where u can join friends and then join together into a lobby.
What I would like to see is: Red Flags, Fixed Penalty System, Better online, as well as DLC Classic Tracks (like Brands Hatch, Fuji, Estoril, Adelaide, Nurburgring, Mugello) and AI that actually makes mistakes on its own more often and Manual Pitstops
Can't wait y'all
Meeeah....
If they don't fix the stupid bugs and broken track limits, or the track layouts where many turns are just wildly different compared to real life, then I won't buy it. For example, the esses in Mexico. You cannot take those flat out in any other racing game, or irl. They are much tighter irl, but in this game they're very wide. Final chicane in Canada is also much wider irl, making the track flow more. But in this game it's almost a 90° corner. Just fix it, ffs.
Please classic cars !
29 seconds, you kidding me?
Why do you guys want to see red flags?
just fix the online lobbies
- Please change the sound of the red lights at the beginning of the race - New engine sounds (similar to the real ones, i know ea can do that) - Brand new hud - Bring red flag back - Allow us to play with classic cars (without paying for a dlc at least) - Penalties doesn't make a goddamn sense, please make it work correctly. - Fix bugs and online modes - F1 with EA have such a promising future, as long as they don't turn this into a new fifa, omg
They literally showed the same scene like 5 times and had text in between..  Amazing start EA
Siiiccc
Please add crossplay
EA Codemasters got hold of the prototype model for the 2022 F1 cars and threw a few lights on it, dutched the camera a few times and that's the reveal 😂
Can we have new pianos
We want also some good details like real commentary James Allen/Crofty ft. Martin Brundle thank you
Germany: ich hoffe das man manuell in die box fahren kann oder das man zum beispiel eine rote flagge haben könnte. Das wichtigste was ich aber finde ist das dass 2021 schadensmodell auf der ps4 nicht ging, deswegen hoffe ich das man mit f1 2022 das schadensmodell bekommt.
Belo trailer, só perde pra qualquer outro trailer ou teaser 😪😪😪
For me online lobbies where you can filter out people using assists vs using no assists and online lobbies that you can filter it to only show lobbies that aren't already a started session so you don't waste so much time entering and backing out of lobbies in session already would be optimal.
i really believe in EA this time, hope this gets good
Please make the sounds correct this time🙏
There you have f1 logo with EA side by side, what could go wrong and remember dont pre order
is the porpoising fixed in this game?
W
I hope we can use the icons as our own avatars like in F1 2019 and F1 2020. I would really like to use the Ayrton Senna avatar again!
I must be allowed to say Pumpernickel in the interview questions.
After the complete MESS that was 2021, you can bet your butt I'm not buying this one.
Thanks to Drive to Survive
VR + enough sim to make this the premier FormulaRacing sim and I'm more than happy
EA Sports did well with F1 Challenge 99-02. Let's make it better this time🔥
Everyone’s asking for manual pit stops and red flags. If this happens I will actually be amazed, Games have become so cookie cutter recently that seeing the game I love evolve in such a way would be brilliant.
Y'all are asking for red flags, but the first frame of this trailer reveals "in-game purchases". That's a red flag.
This absolutely told me nothing about the game
is this only for ps5 etc? or can i play this game even if i have just a ps4?
😂😂😂When you see EA logo and realise you have to pay for unlocking every single Grand Prix.
Where can pre order
Ea sports will ruin this game
Guys, will this be available in PS4?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
DO NOT PREORDER THIS GAME PLEASE.....2021 was full of bugs and still is.... this is not Fifa!! they have to deserve the money If you want better F1 simulator go to Assetto Corsa.... I REPEAT DO NOT PRE ORDER THIS GAME
Already???? HECK YEAH!!!
It better be crossplay
I want tô see more safity cars in the game!!!!
Vr on Pc? Make sure this aint a Battlefield 2042 repeat and you got yourself a purchase
CO-OP??????
Ok, i'm Hype. *VERY HYPPPPPPPPPE*
New career mode and my team please ! With a lot of cinematic
This is EA now, the company that destroyed every sportsgame ever. Don't get your hopes up, it's gonna be less features every year from now on.
I want to see this game move towards simulation a bit more
we want real crashes, parts of the car flying around not a single wheel
Are the Mercs going to be porpoising and slow? Will Max DNF in 2 out of the first 3 races? Is McLaren not in a great place? Is Aston trash? Will Bottas finally be able to have a decent on track fight?
EA.. we don't have to unlock the car's right?😅
Not me thinking we seeing gameplay 😭
I hope we have an actual aero simulation instead of the mechanical grip increasing with speed.
Lmao I still play f1 2018.
will there be porpoising?
When can we pre-order the game?
f1 2022*
I hope that ea doesn't bring pay to win micro transaction system to the game, my knowledge is that previous ea games got destroyed because of the micro transaction and kept their ear shut to the community.
Helmet customization like in GT or MotoGP 🤞🤞
WE WANT CLASSIC CARS, I SAID CLASSIC CARS, WE ALL WANTED, and we also want pitstops like F1 06 (at least I want this)
One thing that EA is going to nail is the sound track
Ye
What is this?
#VR I see you 👀
Everyone is saying rip Jeff, I don't see or hear anything in this that implies he's gone? Maybe I'm deaf and blind idk lol
I won't pay for you EA ahahha
Cross platform, please!
EA is a bigger reason for red flags than Latifi and Stroll combined
I'm a simple man, i see an EA logo i'm ready to be disappointed.
preorder a f1 base car zzzzzz
You better not made an F1 themed need for speed
is it ue5?
Can't wait for Jarno's last to first challenges in this.
Cross platform? PS4-PC
I can't wait  F1 22
Trop cool vivement 💯✌
Classic cars, classic tracks, scenario mode, interactive pit stop & improved wet weather details from the driver’s POV
Dear Marketing team geniuses. Little advice. First show the game, then ask for money
Yessss!
1st July is awesome 😍
bet f1 22 will be about $80
VR! Now I’m interested
Yeah
We would have liked to see FIA Formula 3 and the W Series included. Any plans for them to join up in the future??
Can't wait for EA to run the F1 games into the ground like they did with FIFA ar Madden.
EA sucks and the games
vão cagar kkkk
Please add better livery’s and option to use actual sponsors from real life teams on my team mode
Its lights out and away we go!!! Good start for the ferrari he already de syncs over the mclaren who flies across turn 1 doing a barrell role over one of the RedBulls.
this trailer = nothing
Another disaster F1 game that will be full price? With a story mode that cost extra money? And a paid battle pass?
I hope engine sound is more realistic, with turbo whistle.
How NOT to make a commercial.
After all you've done, do you have the audacity to offer us a pre-sale? EA GAMES.
Will you add the bouncing into the game?
This is the most pointless trailer ive ever seen. Not even a shred of something to believe in? Do they take us for idiots? I guess we got screenshots, but thats it. What was the point?
Wow can't wait to buy a new VGA
The most boring trailer I've ever seen in my entire life
I'm still waiting F1 22 and new Forza Motorsport.
Why is Champions Edition not available for ps4?
i knew the trailer will have only cinematic rendered scenes ... no gameplay scenes and no informations about the changes ingame = no pre order  wasted 29 seconds
Asking us to preorder before showing anything. Classic EA.
Please update your graphics and physics for this game
Hope this time we'll can play by tilting the controller
VR confirmed bois Finally 😭
Compatible with pedalar HE ans BJ ? Or not ?  Only 4 game no compatible, but its okk
New porpoising physics!!
will it have all tracks? or will be the same sh**tt of the last year? we dont want cards and podiuns dances
Will this generation finally move on from the ps4 / xbox one generation that is holding the graphics back?
Well that was informative... Why the hell would I want to pre order this game after last year's online disasters that Codemasters barely even acknowledged? Not only that but since I have PS Plus I'll probably just wait until the end of the season to see if they give it away for free again like they did last season, just a few weeks after I paid full price for the damn thing.
We don't show anything about the game etc, but preorder.
Just one thing worries me, are you keeping the same track models or are you updating them as they are in real life?
If they remove jeff,am gonna lose faith to humanity
Time for ea to start killing the f1 game rip
Game pass day one?
So glad it showed amd told nothing.
I mean they didn't show us anything else, just the F1 show car we've already seen. I'll wait till I see some actual gameplay before preordering thanks
After a day of waiting, there are nothing but cgi trailer, i am not very optimistic about this now…
Epic trailer that just shows some random shots of a single stationary car preorder pls
New era Same graphics, lol
just please bring back the old cars
I wonder how the porpoising mechanic will be implemented
Please have classic cars this time!
RED FLAG, REF FLAG!
New cars, new rules, a new handling model, VR on PC, and much more let you recreate the spectacular wheel-to-wheel racing we’ve seen so far this season  Read more 👉 https://ea.com/games/f1/f1-22/news/f1-22-announce
Hofully f1 gets do mod freindly that it gets to the point we can make our own 3D model cars like asset corsa or even the EA owned game battlefront 2
We need cross-play 😅
Thats a teaser not a trailer
90€ for the Game GUYS pls pls bring not a game out that isn’t finished 100% !
I don’t ask much, just give us a proper winning cutscene, make it more epic and emotional. Especially for my team, after seasons of developing and upgrading the car, winning the title is supposed to be celebrated like crazy. Not just Jeff saying congrats and that’s it and move on to the next season. Like wtf man.
lets go
vaya basura de trailer sin enseñar absolutamente nada
Better kerbs please, I would love to be able to drive around Albert Park and Zandvoort without spining
Bon ben RIP Codemaster,Voila le prochain jeu que EA va détruire (Je sais que c'est Codemasters qui développe le jeux car EA n'est que l'éditeur mais ça me fait peur quand même après qu'il ont fait BF2042)
We wait all this time just to watch a recycled video from 2 years ago of the 2022 cars announcement?.-.
Will this be releasing on last gen consoles?
No new engine ? NEXT No new things ? NEXT Need Origin ? NEXT Price +10 € ?  Thanks you EA for destroying Codemasters
"Pre-order now"  Ehh no thanks. Pre-ordering in 2022 lol when 90% of all games are unfinished on release.
I would like to See a manual outlap after the race
"Preorder now" but we haven't seen anything about the game yet 🤣
Possibly the worst ‘reveal’ to have hyped up  If this was still a year away I'd understand, but you're literally pressuring people to pre order by 16th May and the game is coming out at the start of July...
People wanting manual pitsop on this game  *Manual Pitstop exist* Player : *deliberately hit and broke pit crew legs* ESRB : I will rate this game similar to gta! ESRB Rating update for F1 22 : from E to AO  EA : Stupid player, stupid manual pitstop!
unless i see some major improvements, i m not buying this game
I suck at this game and can't really put my finger on why. I'm more of an arcade style player but it seems my brain is wired wrong for sims. And I absolutely love F1, I really wanna get into this.
i hope they fix the circuits and make them more accurate
Trash, Asetto Corsa with mod still better
TO EXPENSIVE MAN, WTF
Please. No laggy screens or sounds. And no glitching lobbies.  We also want just new tracks. Turkey would be great!!
Please for the love of god, fix illegal overtaking during safety car
it's definitely a game
Even though I've bought every game since 2016, its EA so no way in hell I'm pre ordering.
That's it? Disappointed. Tell us more!
I want classic cars and tracks back. A DLC with a seasons from the 70/80/90:s would be nice!  Manual pitstops and better AI that don't hit you like missiles from behind.
The game is crossplatform ?
More helmet and car customize!!
Can't wait for this
Man what is this?
Welcome to the new era, where there will be less to do than F1 2021
the new era of dsync
For career we want: You can completely adjust your own calender. So you can end with monaco as Final race for example. We want also reversed tracks because its fun. And a option for a 3 players career mode. And the last is the MOST important one: More realistic track limits in time trial. In real life not every corner is a track limit. The limit should be the wall in street circuits. Not a line 3 cm before it
red flags, better crash physics, ai which move actually move out the way on a hot lap, more types of mechanical failures, manual pit stops, lobbies which don't sit on the loading screen for months and finally make jeff even more annoying
Really hoping those things in the description aren’t the only new features… some hub you can walk around in isn’t nice if we can’t even customize helmets besides color. Or the hell that is multiplayer.
So all this wait for...this?
Show the gameplay or something but they have pre order available. Come on
Hold on, why is #vr in the title👀
Please tell me y’all brought back classic mode
Super cool
F1 22 from the intro looks like FIFA
I hope ai will sometimes just straight up do a crash scene where 2 drivers collide with each other, not that they spin in a unrealistic way like in f1 2021
What a waste of time
So that was a whole load of....  Absolutely nothing.   If you're gonna put out a trailer or a teaser at least make it worthwhile for goodness sake. This is a waste of everyone's time but especially the people who put it together.  Good to see EA really putting the effort in, it can only bode well for the actual game. We're all screwed. F1 was the one sports game I liked where I wasn't at the mercy of these scumbags.  Get ready for Common Gold Gearbox in packs and Icon Senna with a 91 rating while Villneuve has a 93 or something.  This is gonna be a mess isn't it
Can't wait to pack a Driver of the Day Leclerc
"Racing renewed" - More Skins, Packs and other stuff to get more money. Beside of that you took three weeks to fix a desync problem on the pc for A CURRENT GAME.  I won't give you my money this year !
Just be top tear at servers this game and make the realism more and more

Now after the game releases i gotta wait 1-3 months til they put F1 2022 in gamepass
bring back championship mode
F1 live really worst Game compare to 2021
Do you guys not workshop your name at all? F1 22 sounds dumb.
pls dont make pay to open the drs😅
Logitech G29 Racing Wheel compatible please
It would be nice if one could design their own car body wise and livery wise
Such a bad trailer
Wow, what a trailer! Doesn't show anything 😄
Description says VR for PC players This is gonna be gold
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR 22 BEFORE BUYING 21!
I just want some brains for the penalties and the return of red flags
Is 2 player career mode being kept for 2022 game?
I hope EA doesn’t screw codemasters…
would like to see more rivalries in this one!
Is my credit card gonna be charged every time I pit?
Hey codemasters so is the game gonna be a lower price when it comes out from pre order but i think i will pre order the game cuz ive been waiting since 2021 game came out but thta price is quite expensive but alright i believe in Codemasters and EA
No Mikey no no Mikey that was so not right!
Optical flow? haha what?
What did I just watch 🖕🏻
Fix that name pls
I want a feature where you can do timetrial with youre friends in the same lobby, but without slipstream ofcourse and dirty air. So you can just have fun
There should be rivals amongst the AI, to the point where they try to take each other off like Max & Lewis lol
And we gonna have to pay another 70 dollars for a copy paste game
New graphics engine ?
Please EA, don't ruin this
Hope to see classique cars in 22
the f1 2022 announce, but the game in the description is F1 2021...
I mean.. let's hope it's a good game cuz u know EA is in the room
I beg for custom track creation. However it still follows F1 regulations and we create everything from the grand stands, pit lane length etc. Also can choose a custom location and country
One thing for sure is that this game will be overpriced
This is somehow even less than I expected from EA.  But I do like how they're already taking pre-orders for the special edition without even showing any of the gameplay.
COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Beautiful , Just Hoped in somethings a bit Longer Tho....
i Hope that the tail Lights are Working now in the rain , like on a real circuit
Quote from the game Steam page: "Incorporates 3rd-party DRM: EA on-line activation and Origin client software installation and background use required." "Requires 3rd-Party Account: EA Account" Are you kidding me??? 😠
eh
New s**t from f**in EA
Yay! Microtransactions 🤦🏻‍♂️
Awesome,  this is just like F1 2021 - Breaking Point + we get to race cars with wheel covers!!! TAKE MY MONEY
Preorder.... How about no? 🤨
Rip codemasters
Literally can’t wait 😁😁😁
my poor eyes
I am hype❤
Anybody notice the #VR in the title?
This is not a trailer. This is a teaser. And quite dissapointing while we're at it..
F1 Ultimate team ? 🤣
This better be good!!!
I'm not buying unless these get in the game: Red flags, manual pitstops Better penalties and Better livery customization.
please give us a classic f1 cars from era
This is gonna be Codemasters biggest f1 game ever!
We need more Game mods a new car desing proces like gran turismo  New era but a Game like the last year
Super Underwhelming trailer, maaaaaaaaaaan.
👀
*reaches for his box of tissues*
Such a waste of a premiere
f in the chat
This is the most boring announcement trailer ever. The main f1 channel could have released this trailer and you wouldn't know if this was about the game or real life
laser scanned tracks please
Wow I didn't know this game was coming out
i hope you didn"t mess the driving physics up this year
man this looks like a teaser of the 2022 car
On PS4 and XBOX ONE please
F I literally just bought 21
Hope you’re keeping the online 2 player championship
No thanks, the last game crashes like the hindenburg, so badly that even after trying everything to fix it I've simply uninstalled it and moved on.
Hopefully the career mode is like back in 2010 or smth like that where you had to get offers and so on
dont let this game be a flop pls thx
Wow this showed us nothing lol July 1st though, awesome.
Nice
Oh, It's beautiful!
Hope to see old tracks and old cars back, more customisation, and co op career with more than 2 players
Was this it?
At least F1 2020 announcement trailer showed us about my team, F1 2021 about Braking Point mode. And this? New regs? Something we all know about?
Yall see the #vr 👀
Very disappointing expecting people to pre order without any details.
Damn... I think ea will dominate the game🤩
Video‘s hashtags say #VR ahhhh fucking finally
WOOOHOOO IM MOVIN' UP AND DOWN, SIDE TO SIDE, LIKE A ROLLERCOASTER!!!!!!! I srs cant wait
Sin comentarios..
Is there another new story mode like Braking Point?
i wish i could wipe out that ''EA sports'' stain out of it
Any classic cars?
Classic tracks
😍🔥
I bought the premium edition already
Please no more bugmaster
you guys know this is an ANNOUNCE trailer not a GAMEPLAY peek right? its announcing the date, not showing content
We really waited all this time for 29 seconds of a bunch of angles of a car we've already seen a million times
15 minute gang
Red flag
Can't even pre order the Champions edition on ps4, ffs
15 minutes ago
LESSSGOO
that was underwhelming.
This game come out in nearly 2 months... 2 !! MONTHS. And they showed us nothing.. Nothing at all.. No Features no Cars nothing... are you joking ? Do you hate us fans so much ?
It is f1 manager?
Caro pra krlh KKKKKKK e no Pc é só 250 e nos consoles 330 vsfd codemasters
VR!!!!
Bring back classic cars
F1: How many strobe lights you want to put in the trailer? Codemasters: *YES.*
I have faith in Codies but i have managed expectations. I"m expecting F1 2021 except with new cars and maybe some bug fixes and maybe JUST MAYBE a new single player mode.
I hope the sounds are better this time
Não vejo a hora de comprar
The game looks sick well done code masters
Is that it...
Was that it? 22 seconds uhh 4pm tune in... 22seconds of nothing..... Fml
yyyyooooooo
Omg how awesome new cars new cars!!! Its time to be more realisty and more actiony
#VR in the desc🧐
hopefully it doesnt crash constantly AHEM F1 2020,2021
Oh hello!
So over 6k ppl waited around for nothing 🤣🤣🤣
wow thats it. i got fully strolled by ea and codemasters. We all think we see gameplay but this really upset now
all this hype for a release date... atleast show us some features.
What an absolute JOKE Codemasters and EA!
EA are a parasitic company, I worry that the F1 games will now be as sh*t as FIFA and Madden
Cool sound design.
I'll boycote your games
All that hype for a rendered showroom and release date 😂😂
#VR IN THE TAGS😏😏
Carisimo en Argenitna... 6400 imposible asi.
all that for 30 seconds where are devs talking about new changes and new stuff and cross play
Of course EA change it just to "22"
ALL THIS FOR 30 SECONDS OF FOOTAGE?
Mal posso esperar por um multiplayer totalmente quebrado (como é de praxe) Um preço totalmente fora do normal (mais de 300 reais isso é um fato) Mal posso esperar pela EA mais uma vez destruir um game Vai ser incrível!!
Well that was disappointing
What a JOKE
Ennyi? Wow...
waited so long for this trailer, and it did nothing new, as all the previous years before.
Bruh we've learned literally nothing useful from this tralier
A fully customizable calendar is a must! Cutting 4 races just because i dont like Monaco is a shame.  Randomly red flags, team orders! Being able to control team mate when racing for the title, different engineers, better training programs, im hyped! But please, not a copy..
Cavolata ...creare un pò di Hype per poi non dire nulla
Please add cross play bruh
that was horribly disappointing
Hmmm. Just a screenshot or teasing a few features would give the community something to discuss, but nope😒 [regardless, I hope its good].
OH MY GOD THIS GAME SOUNDS SO GOOD
EA Sports... Micro transaction now active
Gameplay...? When?
There is nothing here, I want my 29 seconds back 🤣
"Change the pace by taking supercars from some of the sport’s biggest names to the track in our all new Pirelli Hot Laps feature." Just WTF?? We requested improvements for years and that's your answer? Pure EA s***
They basically only showed the one F1 used to show how the new cars will look lile
So can't wait for this. 🎮
Bd
Looks excatly the same game really needs sorting out coz 2021 is so bad
Furnitures? Wait what? Costumise our factory?
Ratio
First we lost Carl and now Jeff :(
what a terrible announce trailer. waste of time to release this.
f1 life looks like the most pointless feature of all time
Rip f1 2022. They’ve ditched the 20
Looks sick from website
Let's go
*Gets penalty for winning*
Sorry - has no one noticed the hashtags - VR?!
Omg it says #VR in the description. F’ing finally
laser scanning tracks when?
Pre-Order = We don't show you the gameplay but you gotta buy it first thanks.
Trash
i hope i will be bought this game from russia
Bugmasters and trollmasters making a trailer
They showed nothing
oh god it's EA again...
On the photos they said not final car models
this trailer was shoter than a weekend
I guess it’s same as for Gran Turismo that Russians can’t have this game :(
wtf is this💀
Well... that was dissappointing
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂bugmasters
I just hope we get a customization designer level MotoGP21, it's not that hard... Even Dirt 4 has better designs than F1 2021
gonna preorder it rn
Will it have authentic Red Bull breakdowns mid race?
But a balloon <
F1 22 should add the Philippine flag when you create your driver. As a Filipino, I need it. edit: FINALLY IT’S IN F1 23!!!
Alright EA, come on now 🙏
Alguém conseguiu ver o Teaser, passou muito rápido kkk Vamo q vamo, New name, New Cars, New Era!!
Pre-orders are live. It's $80 USD! What!
So the games out in 2 months and still you dont show gameplay??????
I had high expectations for this
Embarrassing announcement. All that hype for a 30 second clip that’s shows nothing.
Please upload a video when the price goes down to 30! Idc EA you're not taking all my money at release date, not anymore.
Honestly I am glad it's announced, but you could have made a better announce trailer. This doesn't even hint much to what we could get in the game like 2021 reveal  anyway i am excited
Do the F1 22 got the new cars and physics? ln my Opinion its not enought time to do this? Pls add spider radar
YOOOOOOOOO!!!
"Pre-order Now" .... how about no ??
Scam no trailer
wtf thats all ??🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣30 sec. video ? :DDDDDDDDDDDDDD
This has just announced the trailer, not yet launched the trailer. Like the F1 2021 trailer.
sooooo it wont be on steam anymore? sooo no workshop setups and all that?
Bruh 🧢
If you go to the pre order it says it has co op
Kinda Dumb we get a first Mach up Showcar as our MyTeam Chassis, instead of a Legitimate F1 2022 Car Concept.
check the website y'all
We just got scammed really disappointed
xd
Well we know F1 22 is in dev hell if this is all they are showing.  WTF
scam
Atleast i get to see that the return yt dislike extension is working... dislike count doubled in about a minute...
Infos ?
why there will be no Polish language ?!
Ea, please make the car sound as good as in real life
wow this is a lame trailer tbh
Wth was this 30sec premiere
Steam states "interactive Pit Stops"
I waited 16 hours and all i got was a release date
welp
Pathetic, and they have the nerve to tell me to pre-order. Pathetic.
Can we also have classic F1 Cars again???
"Preorder now!" "Contaci"
non si capisci n'caxzu
Will it be for PlayStation 4?
Is that it?
WTF?
It's a good start to promote your game, you make people wait and set the time reminder to watch a short video.
bro
Triple screens support ? Laser scanned tracks ? Real FFB ?
What kind of trailer is this?
lmao that's gotta be the worst trailer I've ever seen
they want you to buy the game without even knowing how the game looks like XD
drive a car like on horse
DONDE ESTA MI HAMBURGUESAAAA
Yeah you don't need to set up an extra announcement for a 30 second trailer. Just publish it directly, I've expected at least a few more insights in a longer stream. Still excited!
Como diria alonso What a joke
So it has told us nothing, apart from the release date. Easily the worst game reveal/premier in history. Come on EA sort it out🤬🤬🤬🤬.
new game, new cars and new ways to create bugs and make the game nearly unplayable
Fernando once said... Itsa joke! A joke!
Truly pathetic dislike insured
Cool visuals but all this really told me was the release date
I stayed up until 3am to see a 30 second render of the concept car…
bro fr
This was a let down of a reveal lol...even the website is really vague.
I waited since yesterday to get a 30 second PP nothing? What a yoke.
F1 car reveal was last year I thought
Even Mazepin's bahrain GP was longer than this
"VR — Get the ultimate immersive F1® experience with virtual reality compatibility on PC that lets you feel the drama of the race from right inside the cockpit." - Steam
Better be cross platform
Well that’s 30 seconds of my life wasted - we know what the FOM car looks like
Possibly the lamest trailer ever
Disappointed by the """"""""""trailer""""""""""...
VR IS COMING IN THE GAME!!
"Trailer." Lmao.
I am READY!! LESGO!
yay
Some people stayed up all night for this 😭😭😭
Wtf 🤣
Wauw a 10 sec video
Lol, what a trailer 🤡
well that was a whole load of nothing to wait for haha
Next Generation Machanics. Rivalries Renewed. Enter The New ERA.
Well, that was pathetic.
Thought it was gonna be a presentation.
what a waste of my time
What was the point then if it was just 30 seconds
that trailer is a JOKE, a JOKE
Anyone else notice the vr hashtag
What a waste of time for false advertisement…
lul, not actual gameplay
Thats all we get? I mean THATS ALL WE GET?!! NOOOOOOOOOOO!😢
Tf?
L
"VR for PC players" lets go
No f3, no Gameplay, nothing... Disgusting....
Funny how the countdown for the trailer is a lot longer than the trailer itself lmao
Is that it? Even minecraft had a better trailer
Das was Marcel sagt
40 minute analysis video incoming!
You are kidding right ?
OKAY THAT'S NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED. WE JUST GOT EAED SPORTED😂😂
bring back classic cars
Is that a joke ?
I’ve waited all day for that, what a joke
are you kidding us ????  very disappointing the show
What a dead trailer
Really?
nah ea I aint pre ordering nothing if you wont drop gameplay
Are you kidding me?
Wait what?
Biggest Joke i´ve ever seen xDDD
this trailer was disappointing
Just this?
Steam lists VR Support 👀
Todo esse suspense pra isso? Vai tomar no cu EA
We waited almost two days for a mere 29 seconds of nothing. It was a waste of time.  This is *EA quality.*
Trailer was as much of a scam as the game is probably gonna be...
L
I have to pay the DLC: Trailer, to see the video? Really EA?
That was a huge joke.
what a joke
Dude wtf? What a scam
Was that it?
0/10 teaser
It´s a Joke!
this was the most anti-climactic announcement ever. i hope the game won't be as anti-climactic (or bugged, like F1 2021)
my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
Waste of 29 seconds
I didn't expect anything and I'm still disappointed.
Never seen such a short trailer without any information about what is in the game except that you can preorder this bugged game now. nice ea
Bruv
SCAM
L
This is what i waited for All Day? 😂
Sooooooooo disappointing
PLEASE COMEBACK THE OLD CARS ( LOTUS 70s, MCLAREN 80s …)
Jokemaster !!!
Bruhhhhh
well that was tragic, no info just "pre-order now"
I spent 10 minutes waiting for a 30 second video😂😂😂
That was amazing! Love it!
This shouldn't be premiered tjeeeeezzz..
Its a joking trailer 0:29 minutes
scam
do people really preorder games after trailers like this? ok i guess
Congrats on your new title codeamateurs. epic trailer!
what a load of dross
Bruh
Was that it.
THANKS EA
Y'all did *not* have to make a trailer for the release date come on lmao
Pre-order when I can't even see what the game is about. Seriously wtf.

C'est tout ??? Juste précommandez le jeu quoi mdrr c'est tout on vous montre rien... on a bien vu que c'est passé chez EA içi... PFFFFF

What was the point?
Waited 15 minutes for this s**** trailer -_-
This was so Bad its unbelievable
L
L
Well that was underwhelming
Scammed.
its a yoke, a yoke
y'all shouldn't have released anything at this point
I learned so many new things from this video. Basically a video asking you for money without showing anything
What a announcement trailer i was just blown away just crazy stuff 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I set my expectations low, but this? This was impressively underwhelming.
Biggest L ever
big L
30sec? Jesus
That was very underwhelming lol
THATS IT???
New F1, new regs let's goooo
Nice trailer
went for a piss and the stream was already over tf
A countdown for a release date? Really EA? Where's the gameplay? Where's the features?
huh
Joke
“Bono, my trailer is gone”
Codies said "gotcha"
That was it? I'm dissapointed....
On n'a rien vu vous vous foutez de nous ?! 🤦🤦🤦
1st of July...A YOKE!!!!!GP2...GP2.
That was nothing at all!
VR ?
can't wait to pay 3.99 for each team, and 1.99 for each track, while the game never gets gameplay patches
wow dafür so ein hype...
Strolled 😑
just this ？
ah yes let me just preorder this with no info what so ever mmm myes
Yess
literaly they put videos of 2022 car this way how can i understand how the game will be, each year worse and worse games
That's it?
Bruh nice 30s without any gameplay
That was over very quickly
What was that???
Looks like its gonna be more competitive
F1 2022, let's go!! 🔥

Bruh

told to us pre order and the date and thats it lmao
Bro they revealed nothing
This was, dissapointing
Best announcement trailer of the decade.
Oké wtf
Did they just troll us,
2019 French GP was more exiting than this premiere.
F1 fans really got up to watch a 30 second glorified announcement. Shame. The premiere teaser gave us more than the actual announcement.
Alonso would say: it’s a yoke!!
what a joke
*That* was it? I thought were getting Gameplay or something bruh
That’s all?
After watching the trailer I forgot ea made it so you have to buy a dlc to see actuall gameplay
EA wtf!
Hi Evan that was underwhelming
Bruh moment
What on earth was that?
Ok
Can't wait for the F1 YT community to overhype this disappointment
wow I did not expect so much new content HAHA
VR FOR PC LETS GOOO
Bruh

Realy? That's a joke right?
Bruh
Seriously
Biggest disappointment of 2022 so far lmaooo

I haven’t been this disappointed since shrek 2
That was it?
Wow, a premiere that could have been an image on a social media, time to smash the video's dislike button
Let's gooooo
Are you serious? That’s like EA does Redbulls 2022 car launch. What an anticlimax
That’s all wow I stayed up till 1AM for this
Tutto sto casino, un countdown di 2 minuti per 20 secondi di video?

Rip gameplay footage

Disappointing reveal trailer
Bruh

SIIIIUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
aaa
we bully ea into bringing jeff back
Wow so overwhelming
Please make sure we can share livery among us
Noooooooo not jeff why he was so good
I can’t wait!
🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪
Damn that's crazy, but I must say Fexalan Formula Racing on Roblox is better... 😏😏
Alguém sabe se vai ter pra Xbox One S?
But here comes Sebastian Vettel !!!!
F for Jeff👇🏽
Pay to unlocked a The New Era
cross platform
Online bugs please, solve the online bugs
A new disguise for multiplayer-wise unreliable EGO engine? New menu, same (and some new) bugs? F1 2021 is half baked and getting abandoned now.
So much hype, ready to see what’s new 🔥
Is Jeff no longer in f1
Red flags? plz
Hype
Pls redflags
Sound from the car is so bad...
Please don’t say they have replaced Jeff because it sounds like it
more myteam expansion. co-op and myteam career vs
Red flags please
JEFF > F1 22
This sounds like Miami
👋
Yesss new f1 leclerc win the championship yesssss 🎉🎉🎉
YES, LET'S GO
hyped!!!
apparently this sound is the car driving in miami
Can it just have VR please.
same engine sounds again... uff. Why is it so hard to make them sound like the actual thing? Three years in a row the same sound. Come on  man
There's no career mode apparently
I want a game that doesn’t randomly crash and doesn’t have multiplayer errors. Crossplay will give them a brownie point and a cookie. 🍪
Can’t wait for this. Dropping content from the release!
Add Hokinheim
R.I.P Jeff you might not be missed and might be missed...
More penalties better tracklimits manual pitstops and red flags 🚩 please
New era, think it’s time for a NEW RACE ENGINEER😂 (goodbye Jeff you will be missed😢)
Hoping they fix ALL the tracks
“Sources have also confirmed that, apart from the above, there will be few other changes to the gameplay itself. Handling, customization, ERS, the penalty system, Podium Pass, co-op (2 people only), graphics, game engine, servers, Career, and My Team will not be altered from F1 2021.”   Thanks EA
Cant wait to see it
The new Era
I want an old tracks section back like the one added back in F1 2013, with Malaysia and Tuscan, between others
It sounds like  a new engineer...  RIP Jeff. 2015-2021
Pls classic cars
LET'S GO BABY!!!!!!!!! NEW F1  EVERYTHING NEW LET'S GO!!!!
Plz don’t f*** this one up.
2 more hours, but pain for us Aussies coz it's at 1
OMG,I CANT WIAY FOR THAT
The trailer didn’t give me the hype I had before. I mean it‘s exactly the same Honda engine sound we have since F1 2020 or so…
The radio guy sounds different. Is Jeff safe? Is he alright?
i am so excited lets gooo!!!!
I can’t wait to simulate in it!
How did they make the game this fast, I havnt even finished my myteam
IS JEFF GONE??
I‘m gonna be sad when there is no more story mode like last year. I really enjoyed it
how about fix last years one first, which keeps crashing for a lot of us
I hate how excited I am despite knowing it's just gonna be a generic 3D CGI teaser trailer and not actually show anything of substance
IM HYPED
Actually can’t wait codemasters take my money
Will it have classic cars?
The track in the trailer is Turkey.
already missing jeff somehow
0:40 that isn’t jeff
Compatible on PS4? 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼
I hope we can finally get classic tracks or DLC tracks beyond the official calender we have asked for this very long time now. They missed circuits during the pandemic.
Will f1 2022 be on PS4?
Commentators like in fifa would be cool to have in the replay mode, with before race cutscenes and driver line up included in the replay. Also manual pitstops, red flags  would be neat.   You know my requirement  Codies
All we REALLY need is a functioning online system that engages players to race online, as nothing is more fun than racing against a full lobby of real players. Even the odd Pastor Maldonado can't ruin the fun!
I hope still have for the old game system like ps4 and xbox one
We just want a game that works and isn't full of bugs and desyncs!!
I can't wait to  see new era
It sounds like a new race engineer in the trailer rip Jeff
Let’s hope EA is not going to ruin the game with micro transactions :|
Crossplay para eu jogar com o Diogo e dar lhe na cabeça 🤣
Damnnn i cant wait for this new era F1 im really excited on this one 💯💯💯💯
honda engine still sounds trash :/
Formula,,,,,,,  E ?
Isnt it just the Trailer for the next F1 Game(2022)
Just start work when you reveal it damn! 😂
Can’t wait for the new child-oriented arcade
Let's gooooo!🤙
Goodbye Jeff but hello new name new cars new track and new season this gonna be great
This is gonna be midnight for me:(
He went a bit wide out of T3
i wanna say the audio from the trailer is from Miami
NOOO JEFFFF
what is this?
RIP Jeff
Please bring classics too
can't wait!!!!
I am early
:( poor Jeff
Can anyone tell what circuit is being driven on the background?
R.I.P Jeff
🫡
Whoever guesses the circuit in the background seriously has no life 😂😂
Please bring custom driver transfers to the game🙏🏻🏎
VR is what i wanna hear .... VR = Immediate purchase
I hope its a w game
Will it be in stores from today
This will be epic.
Still the same honda engine sound, sucks
Sounds silly , but I’d like a better livery editor, gt sport style would be nice
🔥🔥🔥
I don't wanna tell anyone else but Jeff to shut up!!! 😭😭
finally a next gen game? f*** ps4 version
EA aren't well known for Sim racing. They are more of an Arcade. Luckily codemasters are making it but I still have a feeling that EA will have their say and make F1 2022 more of an arcade than a sim racing experience.
So... Many of the people are commenting about what they would like to see on F1 2022 (And that includes me, and some other things i would like to see) :  - Better penalties  - Red Flag, with a better realistic system than the few games that have the red flag  - Better FPS performance  - Better gameplay, or i'll say more realistic  - Better customization, and that means to add vinyls, and (maybe) vynils of brands or smth  - Classic Cars, like F1 2020 and other F1 Codemaster games  - More additiosn to the game, and that means making the menu bigger with new additions  - Challenges, (Like GT series)  - In addition about challenges, maybe challenges created by F1 drivers
we need heineken and velo on this game
Codies, you need to tell me what track is being driven in the background. I cannot figure out which one it is. Or is it just a simulation of a car going round some corners? I need answers hahaha
Time to cancel ea for canceling Jeff.
Rip Jeff ❤️
Finally getting new car?!
OMG can't wait to have proposing mode on.
Have they announced this on twitter
rip jeff
Can’t wait to experience the porpoising!
I hope the new game gotta be a new engine sound like the real F1 car
The new engineer dosent sound realistic at all huge step back😢  Like bro “YOU CAN DO THIS!” 💀 I’m just tryna race stfu
The engine noise better not sound like f1 2021
By the way this little preview looks and sounds, it seems to me this game will have similarities with F1 2002, which would be nice since it's made by EA as well and this is its 20th anniversary. Regardless, I hope it will be an improvement...
Formula 3 pleeeese
If there are no real changes apart from the cars, this will mark the first time I haven’t bought the game for 9 years
confirm this track is miami?
Realistic engine sounds I beg
Will F1 2022 have porpoising
Wich track could that be
Dead game if they recycle the engine sound from 2021. It's embarrassing how much better some AC mods are able absolutely nail F1 car sound in comparison to the official game. Game needs cross-play badly as well
Why on earth have the sounds stayed the same? It's not hard. Take assetto Corsa for example. Much better sounds all round.
there is no pilot career
RIP Jeff (2015-2021) Thank you Adam Rhys Dee for your amazing work I'm gonna miss you as Jeff
F1 2022 game?
What need to be new Custom Sponsors  Custom livery  Custom badge Test days like asetto corza  Driving in the pit lane  Going from f4 al the way to f1 (skip is option) (Sorry Jef) more engineers
Lets see what EA can bring and just hope for the best
I'm going to miss Jeff
Anyone know what track it is
Cant wait
will it be on xbox one? pls
Better team radio ?
The best things to really kickstart the new F1 era in this years game would be to add : custom helmets, more sponsors for my team, custom liveries, bodywork / chassis options to make the car look and handle more to your liking. A “ Team Relationship “ stat would be nice for Driver Career. Better damage models and the ability to porpoise if the car is set up wrong.   Even just a few of these would make the game damn good
More classic tracks, weekly updated liveries and better penalties system.
L I V E R Y  E D I T O R
Same engine sounds? What? R u serious? :C
WOW SO FAST?!?! Well calm down Well I bet this game will be spectacular I'm pretty sure this game will be great Wait Codemasters Wait Codemasters Wait F1 2022 Yeah I'll wait as long as I have to wait it'll be the best game (POSDATA) I'm from Argentina but I know English.
Will it go out to the old generation?
As a wise man would say: f***ing finally
Hope that will be Free
Give me good stuff
Im a bit lost. Is this the countdown for the manager game or the actual race game F1 2022?
Now that I think of it, since we already lost Carl to multiple random "heads of RnD", does this mean that we'll have multiple engineer voices too?
Give us the ability to control our team mates strategy please!
F1 2022
the game should be better in content than in graphics.  the game should be better in content than in graphics. it should only be a game that can be enjoyed for a long time and has fewer errors. Anyone who wants to see more beautiful things should go out into nature.  Obviously the game should be nice but not to the detriment of content.
F1 2022 ?
Am I dreaming? No marketing, leaks nothing? 1 insta post and 1 première? If they're joking. Idek what im gonna do.
Rip Jeff 😞
did i just not hear jeff omg it’s final happend no more jeff
NEW CARS NEW ERA NEW TEAM MATE
My theory is that in the new game you can active a option where you're character or should I say driver like speaks bc this voice in the preview it's a similar voice to the voice that you get when you win a race in f1 2021
I hope for something that many people want and I also have lifelike artificial intelligence such as better team work, more retaliatory opponents, red flags, track repairs, and new era cars
not buying if you remove jeff for some random guy
The engine sounds are exactly the same from last year come on
red flag in f1 2011 to 2014 and no red flag so finale its here back red flag im wait the game  :)
Is it a new game or just a trailer?
No way! I can’t wait 🤩
POV: Estás compañías, nos venden el mismo juego una y otra vez cada año. Sin hacer una mejora realmente significante, además de perder todo lo que ya hiciste en el año anterior.  Dejen de comprar el juego, juegos como COD ya se dio cuenta que esto está empezando a aburrir y a fastidiar.
No Mikey No Mikey !!!!!!
do we buy pit stops from the ea store?
WHERE DID JEFF GO?!?!?!
Sounds like we got new radio man
Same engine?
Let’s go
You should be able to choose your engineer.
I have faith in EA that they will finally make a good game with little too no microtransactions
RIP Jeff? 😭😭😭
PLEASE FOCUS ON LASER SCANNING OR IMPROVING TRACKS QUALITY
All I want is manual pit stops/pit lane
Cross-platform play please 🙏
The track is miami
Bye Jeff I promise I will never do Heroics into saint devoite
WHERE ARE PEOPLE FINDING THE ENGINEER VOICE FROM I WANNA KNKW GOD DAMMIt (I now know) and plus what does it stay at the start
I want to walk around team headquarters that would be sick
The audio in the video doesn't sound like the Miami circuit?
I hope to see the red flag, penalties that make sense, the artificial intelligence that crashes on its own and that some bugs are fixed online
the sound comes from a miami hotlap
Return your games to Russia, we are the people that didn't do anything to war, we are only people that want to play f1 games. But we can't
F1 the shapes edition
İt's f1 manager 22 ??
I WANT THE ISTANBUL CIRCUIT 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
red flags?
Is the noice in the backround a new ingenieur?
I almost screamed like crazy on seeing this schedule Can't wait anymore!
the engines better improve or else I'll be sad 😔
Bring the back f1 classic cars and classic track
Yes! Finally!
Wow i can't wait!
Oh no 😬 That's 100% the Honda engine sound from F1 2021. Hopefully they'll change it.
It’s a Miami circuit 🔥🔥
F1 2022 LET'S GOOOOOO
F1 2022 LET'S GOOOOOO
F1 2022 LET'S GOOOOOO
new era,so please do something with these horrible engine sounds,AC modders do better,than a big company..
Can't wait!
Exciting, cannot wait for tomorrow!   Wish the engine sounds would get a bit of a revamp though, I watched a MOD of the Redbull in Assetto Corsa recently and it sounded AMAZING! <3
Sooooo excited!!!!
New game?
Game withouts Bugs and everyone would be happy
SO EXCITED!!!!!
Is this the sound of a new track?
Ready to be disappointed by EA
fix f1 2021 multiplayer first
YE BOI F1 2022
R.I.P Jeff
FINBBALLY
Cant wait and i want GT Racing added to it, 911 RSR/GT3R/Porsche Supercup please.
Is it finally going to be the official 2022 game with new cars? With this kind of engine sound? What an excitement.
No suena igual q los motores de ahora
Please make this Jeff warn me about my engine before I start the race instead of immediately going "the ICE is getting a little worn!" 50m after lights out
Flat spot wheel/controller vibrations, aquaplaning on water, red flags, pit stops like champ edition with buttons, my team co op 12 teams on the grid, pre season testing...can't think of much more
Can’t wait to over criticise the damage model again 😂😭
RIP JEFF, NEVER BE FORGOTTEN
This sounds VERY familiar... 👀👀
If it's "New Era", I hope they make it VR compatible..but I won't be holding my breath..
SO HYPED!
I wonder what the track is, maybe someone can figure it out via engine sound?
New engine pls
fix penalty and off track system. im tired of getting warnings for extending like they do irl
New game engine please. The current one has a persistent input lag that plagued all game of this (past) generation
Probably RB18 sound but same as the 2021
This will be interesting 🧐. Though you already have me sold.
Lets see what EA will do.. 😎
Hopefully they focus on good fps performance even on the low end systems. F1 2020 runs flawlessly i have never tried 2021 yet I'm a bit late but i hope whatever this is, will run good as well.
Please ffs give us vr support
I have a doubt is this the premiere for the f1 manager 2022??
So first thing we know is the car sounds are recycled...off to a good start 🤣
Fix 2021
F1 2023?
I hope it actually puts the tires you requested on when you pit
Use Frostbite please, use Frostbite...
I'm afraid it's too much to hope that f1 2022 will be with UE5?... I saw that codemasters are part of the devs that are going to use UE5 but f1 2022 might be a year too early :(... I hope at least a bunch of graphic issues from f1 2021 (that weren't present in f1 2020) will be gone and fixed!
Crossplay pls
Yeeesssss letssss gooooo
The hope of people here is real, but guys it's EA, don't expect to much
Please EA, Don't break this good game.
OMG I CANT WAITT
better helmet customisation like adding custom images and such
Can't wait
And I hope this game to be free from glitches and lags.
Codemasters plsssss make this game with the Buddh international circuit
Is that a new race engineer I hear?
So f1 2022
I cannot wait when this come
I hope it comes out on the older generation as well 🙏😩
cant wait to see how ea ruin the f1 series
Classics tracks!! Pleasee
Game release tmr??
The focus should for once be on GAMEPLAY and everything during it. No new modes or story in any way needed.   Revamp the engineer to be way more talkative, penalty system revamp, better cooperation with teammates, double yellow flags, car recovery on track ETC
Same game different textures 😁
This comment is for these who don’t know what track this is it’s Miami. I believe I’ve heard a second track in this video maybe Las Vegas!? Probably not be…hey it’s a lucky 🍀 guess!
Do It EA
Same engine sound. Smh
Same track maps doe 🤪
Sounds like Geoff has gone if this is in game audio.
I'm just hoping PS4 will still be available Edit: WE GOT IT!!!
Please fix the ego dumper crash on pc
Please bring it for old Gen too🙏
Just looking at this preview trailer alone, I have never been *this* excited for a F1 game since F1 2017!   I would love to see classic cars back and also classic tracks as well, because we haven’t got these since F1 2013!
Please be on PS4 I’m finding it so hard to get a ps5
Looking forward to this!
👁 ❤️ U Artists of electricity (Elctronic Arts (EA)) and Masters of the Codes (Codemasters)
If that’s the new engineer that’s sick but imma miss Jeff 😭
*Fifa noises intensifies *
Everything new! OMG! I can't wait!
New era, old broken game
Come on codies don’t disappoint
Oh no. The engine sounds like a more pronounced vacuum cleaner again and the engineer is talking even more. Better look good and have a better handling system, game  🙏🏼
Hopefully in this game Jeff doesn't tell me it's going to rain right after I pit.
spoiler: same game than f1 2021 but with 22 in the title
Jeff got fired 🥲
New bug Era xd, i hope we see a lot of surprises not F1 Ultimate Team xd
Who’s that voice and please don’t tell me you’ve replaced Jeff?
if it isn't gonna end up like FIFA then i'm in
Finally a new engineer system that actually encourages you and give you more detail?
LFGGGG
Please unlock your game in Russia !!!!!!
New Era with Old Game Engine? 🤡🤷🏻‍♂️
Custom tracks please
From the little preview it sounds like a new engineer RIP Jeff Never was there a man of more heroics
Can anyone hear what track this is?
that’s not jeff…
A new season, a new car and a new circuit excite fans of the F1 series.
Bitte OHNE D-Sync PLEASE mein Gott muss das sein?
Ayo this already sounding sick as hell
If these engine sounds are exactly the same I'm going to actually cry
Wohooooooooo The New Game !!!!
HEREEEEEE WE GOOOO! 🙋🏻‍♂️🔥🇧🇷
I just want manual pitstops, red flags, more livery customisation, better penalties etc. I believe in you EA, please don't let this turn into the FIFA games 🙏  Edit: See? I wasn't so stupid aha
I’m ready
What track is the sound from?
I cannot wait for the completely broken multiplayer.... thats like the core feature of fans of this game.
Engine sound exactly the same
I expect new skins for cars with no changes to the handling whatsoever and tracks with old layouts.
More realism New enginne
Is jeff the engineer getting replaced??
Bin sehr gespannt wie sich die neuen Autos virtuell verhalten
Ihop so ps4
BAŞLIYORUZ
I’m so excited can’t wait for this game
LET’S GOOOOOOOOO
MAKE CAREER MODE CROSS PLATFORM PLEASEEEEE
Just take my money
EA…..🫤
New Era, old game engine.

F1 drivers not looking like PS2 characters finally?
Oh yes the speedjponator3 is gonna Toxic up and galactic even attraction to F1 22 will be doing the game preview and others for upcoming previews up ahead.
Ea sports and codemasters you are the beast!!!😀😀😀
