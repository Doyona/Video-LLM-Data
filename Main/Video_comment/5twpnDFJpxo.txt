I THINK WITH OUT ANY THINKING THAT BRUNO IS THE BEST ARTIST OF HIS AND THIS TIME ON THIS PLANET. HIS TIMING AND HIS INTEREST IN HIS  FANS LEAVES NOTHING ON THE  TABLE AND HIS CLASS AND THE FUN AND HIS LYRICS WILL STAND
2025
Alguien en el 2024!
If the song itself isn't proof of its perfection, you can tell that these songs are amazing because every part of the song on the slider has a high replayed amount.
Wie macht Ihr das bloss Jungs? Eine Hingabe an Stimme und Gefühl. Ich dreh gleich durch, singe auch und weiß, wie es ist "rauszuhauen"😂❤❤❤❤

underrated silk sonic song
From just putting on a smile to dying with it!
Bruno!!!!!! Sheesh!!!!!!!!!! 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
Can’t believe you found a way to precisely describe how I’m feeling it’s like a curse over my insecurities and tears keep coming because I didn’t know that my smile was you … the only thing I remember you my days are really without meaning Lord if this is love I’ll be existing without meaning empty space on my chest my tears are drowning me in loneliness and pain sorry for not keeping you with me I leave you here on my memories ones up on time ❤🎉 fairy tale of my insignificant existence.
After hearing Die with a smile, it reminded me of Put on a smile 🎉
From Put On A Smile to Die With A Smile

😊 👉 The word Smile is made-up sign language; and there are different kinds or types of so-called smiles; And, while some people's smiles are real fair and or beautiful smiles to not cause trouble by; Some people's smiles are to hide their upset, or they're hiding their unfair and or jealousy for no good nor right reason as some people's smiles are unreal as in dishonest to pretend to be good and or nice to wrong cheat or abuse by. 👉 ✌ Peace & respect to Bruno Mars sharing his nature's spirit's richness by the attached 🎶 musical 🎶 🎶 joint beautifully mimicking the art 🎨 of made-up communications in ways that some females and males communicate or can relate to by someway having learnt the art 🎨 called words/English.

Todos temazos!
This is my favorite song ❤❤❤❤❤
2024❤
Since the release of Silk sonic, I think Bruno has become the world's best vocalist in history
This is one of those songs where you’d be hard pressed to find a cover better than the original
I am crying tears.  I have broken down because I don't know how I can keep my relationship together
E ainda tento sorrir ...
Éé Bruninho obrigado por tudo o silk sonic foi um presente para todos nos
2024 e ainda amo o silk sonic
2024 e o Silk sonic é eterno

We need more breakup songs like this nowadays... honestly we just need more songs like this in general
Waiting for the next Silk Sonic album
Listening to this when she gives u too much mixed signals, yk you dont gotta lower ur standards and prepare yourself when a new guy pops up in her status. 😂😂
i hate my life
Perfection. I know these guys are individual artists in their own rights; but this Christmas I'm wishing for more collaboration from them.
I hope I never sit out a dance - I want to dance forever !😊🎉
Bruno Mars cannot be human!
I still can't hit that high note Gosh 😭 so good bruvh
This song is so underrated, leave the door open takes too much emphasis away from the rest of this album
This might be my favorite track off of the whole album
I've been a fan Of Mars since my early teenage now I'm 25 and man ! Quality content still
Bruninho ❤
Incredible song, these guys are so talented
It's 2023 but this song

the climax of this song is the best shit i've ever heard
The way this song heals my soul 😞
What's left to say about Bruno and Anderaon they  just fantastic, have charisma  undeniable talent either writing or performing ,they are just pure magic ....Love the r n b sounds that grew up with in the  70,s bought back great memories of fun times with friends ,brilliant music and life was much simpler ..  Hope they continue to make music together as so talented and what the world has needed   last couple years 🎵🎵🎵🎵🥁🥁🥁🎶🍾🍾🥁

THANKYOU BRUNO FOR THIS MASTERPIECE
My DEAR MOM SPEAK = SHE HATES PEOPLE LOOKED AT HER
USTEDES SON MI ADICCIÓN  Y MI PLACER DE ESCUCHARLOS DIARIAMENTE.
This song rides! Awesome!
Voltando aqui mais de 1 ano depois pra dizer que continua sendo a minha favorita do álbum 🤧
I never be a fan of Bruno Mars, but this album really got my attention to him.
in a long distance relationship rn, and whenever we talk, i have to put on a brave front and smile and try not to show that i miss them so much my chest hurts. this song really hits in moments like this when i’m hurting
Masterpiece
Oh Bruno, please grace is with 1 live performance please. And release it for playing on the radio.
This sounds beautiful 🥰😍 It sounds like a Michael Jackson or Marvin gaye record. its Perfect.
This is one of my Favorite song on this Album. You know this song would make a great theme song in a Motion Picture. So, smooth and yet upbeat. 💃🕺😎❤️😎🕺💃
This feels like a more mature version of when I was your man🥺💞
💎🎱
THIS ALBUM IS SOO UNDERRATED
If i could listen to this for the first time again :(
NIE DO OPISANIA JEST TO DZIEŁO SZTUKI
Bruh this song is my favorite song from album respect their musicality genius gangsta no cap lol stay safe RIP Hagrid Takeoff Pele pray for our world BLM God bless checkout the band The Main Squeeze 🙏
The tears of a clown like stuff! Smokey and the Miracles feelings. Love Bruno and Anderson Silk Sonic!! 2023
Going back, listening to their interviews, its amazing that BABYFACE made Bruno hit these notes. He didn't think he can, but Babyface gave him the confidence. I love this!
Uncle MArs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Uncle Mars, i cant breath becouse of work i got to do. I spend last 7 days working 18hs a day , vocals, streatching vox, mixing, all  ready, 12 songs  im ready to get that dogh for You if You need milions for  MAster etc  - now im broke but its not a problem couse its worth it - its FOR WHOLE WORLD - im ready  - im real and  reallly my Brothers i need You.  I sing Soul and produce beats. We gotta Change this world becouse its soooo possible! Its Music in 40 % to save it when Music is 101%   Im serious, what should i Do?   My Album is called: Lover & The Fighter
Bruno has always taken me "back" way before his own time (ok, I admit it, I'm old lol) - True Motown sound with the new age sound meshed together so seamlessly you have to remind yourself sometimes that Bruno is from todays Generation and not a Vinyl record from your 70's collection of Classic Motown! Now adding Anderson into his vibe and creating absolute MAGIC, - Every single Song on this album is a JOURNEY - where every word dives into your bloodstreams and ebbs and flows to the beat from beginning to end, making hairs on your arms stand on end and sending electrical waves through your soul!! .... These two geniuses were meant to find each other and I hope they continue to make more music!!
this is the 42342th time is played this and still fire
Adoro su música ❤️🙏
Tryna put on a smile:( , my day to day
Honestly why TF was this song not released as a single? Also why has no m*therf*cker uploaded a live version of it.
This song had no business going this hard! Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak are the duo we didn’t know we needed
Masterclass
I love , my love
This song helped me get through I really hard place and I just wanted to say thank you.
He's good in Soul.
Please make a music video for this song!!! OMG! This would be dope.
I think this is the best cut on the album.  At the very least, it's what I like the most.  Of course, there are very close 'seconds'.  The production is fantastic!
I love it
man bruno i feel you buddy

The best song on the album...and they've already produced 4 #1 singles.  I'm hoping they release this one to make it #5

My favorite from the album 💗
You Guys , all I can say is " I love You! " I want to say How much I love the Song and I do, Love the Song, Howeverrr your Style, your Sound, the Vocal Team, It Works!!!

Whole Album is nice 😁😏
Where are bruno, dont' speak of bruno?
You're right.  Some of the songs  I have heard of Anderson sounds good but some of Anderson songs are a little too much for me.
Bruno + Anderson = The best in this world now..         From Italy with love
Just a total masterpiece. Amazing pure beautiful soul

This is so underrated for such a Masterpiece
One of the best songs I've ever heard and I've heard a lot of songs.

Wowwwww a rare real old school great musician ship sound in  2022 feels good
Mon coup d'coeur dans l album ❤️
Ain’t no shame begging in the rain. Tell her how you really feel 🎵
3:28 😱
In 25yrs, today's generation will listen to this song and get the same feeling as my generation does when we hear songs from groups like Silk and Shai. This track is timeless
Where is fly as me, after last night, 777, and blast off go?
Wow😲🤩, I am a vinyl collector and did not know that such a collaboration was taking place. I love two artists but I haven't heard this album. YouTube helped me with this. Great production and BIG arrangement !!! UP !!!
The fact that' Anderson Paak did not like this first is funny. This is a true masterpice.
❤️🇨🇦
Heard this song at work and my mf ass felt like she put me on the couch 🤣 and we don’t even live together 🤣🤣🤣
Beautiful song!! On repeat!!
You have to hear them sing this live! Their show in Vegas is so 🔥🔥
I like this song.
Dang!just about ALL their songs are good but I heard this one just recently I'm like  OMG, another one! Beautiful  Voices Beautiful Drums 🥁 I just love the Chemistry with them!❤
The best song I've ever heard. REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT ♥️♥️♥️

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDSRSkcGz7I
This is something Al Green, Al Wilson, Teddy Pendergrass, Carl Carlton, Edwin Starr, Marvin Gaye and even a teenage Michael Jackson would have recorded back in the '70s.
Saaaaang Bruno!!!!!!!❤❤🎵🎵🎶🎶
¡HERMOSA CANCION! no me canso de de oirla, me trae tantos recuerdos, gracias Silk Sonic, son los mejores 👏👏👏👏👏
My mom passed last year but I'm trying to put on a smile. It's so hard.
I have LOVED Bruno for a loong time! He has so many talents you can barely count them. His creativity is over the TOP now and still growing. The Bar is extremely high because of him and his entire multitalented singers/musicians!! This is his calling and I pray that he will continue to use it to Bless others. Powerful is the Healing through Music. At this point and age in my life I truly feel that I’ll meet him one day. I just want to truly thank him for sharing his life with me/us . This is an amazing song. Going through multiple major life adversities I truly appreciate all genres of music. Each song gets better and better 💯🔥✨🤭….I often wonder if he ever read’s any of the “admirable”feelings people express towards him ?Does he have staff people that brings some of the compliments directly to him? Either way his professionalism and showmanship are “✨MESMERIZING ✨”
I have been transported back to my teen years in Savannah, GA.....slow dragging...lol.
I love this song and yo see that there is still GJ podría music and great lyrics. Out there mates me proud of you guys. I congratulate uou !. You  deserve all the success. I Love You Bruno
1:45
This is a masterpiece. It didn't only reach my heart. It touched my soul 😭😭😭😭
I dont know why but this song just brought tears down my face.
Andy is singing his face off on this one!!!
Motown
It is a good song 🎵 👌 😌 ❤️ I love it  is  👌
Afffffff 🤤❤️❤️❤️❤️ oh vícioooo 🇧🇷
I'm crying 😥 .....i love them......Bruno you are wonderful....gracias son grandiosos ❤❤
Love  it
Underrated song in the album
This track deserves a full cinematic music video.
The more I listen to this song the more I fall in love with LOVE. This entire song is so beautiful it just about breaks your heart to tears. Listening with headphones and hearing the guy’s harmonizing is sick. They are another branding of “Silk” so loving and gentle in annunciation of their back up lyrics which is another Major congrats for this beautiful album🔥🔥Omgeeee , Anderson killing totally killing the overlays of the Bridge Drumming 🥁💯captures my head, ears and heart to the point of this is a staple song for life !!! Mine’s anyway 🫠🤣🤣👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼💯Thank you …. All of you …SILK SONIC 💯🔥🌊
Quelle belles  chansons...geniales...tres belles  voix..un regal!
Every day, when a man loves a woman
The summer love song, on all kinds of situations,
Vibing 70s music! Brilliant!
i hope they release this as a single
No one talking about how you can turn back the hands on a Rolex? 😂😂😂 Love the song though!
surprised this doesn't have more views...
I’m waiting for Bruno Mars to tour in NC again 😭
Even on such an exceptional album, this is the outstanding song. I listen to it over and again in awe. This is musical greatness.
I LOVE ALL BRUNO MARS, ANDERSON MUSIC   ITS A ALL TOGETHER BAND [LINDA ALOFF CHICAGO  CHI TOWN]

Love this song. Their vocal control is mad crazy.. Yesss
THIS SONG...Simply a Masterpiece..from the warmth and spicy-ness🌶 in Andy’s vocals and the Range and NOTE from Bruno’s vocals to the Rain, the orchestra, the crazy Drum 🥁 Riffs to the arrangements ... THIS SONG quite frankly is SONG of the year for 2022 hands down...who agrees??? ❤️❤️🙏🙏It hits me to my core in my SOUL 🙏🙏
Música é tão boa que proporciona diversos sentimentos bons as mesmo tbm

OMG, I hear The Dramatics within this classic - ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!! 💯💖👏
Bro this one hits me hard
Silk Sonic powerful lyrics 💞 Love this song 🎵 💕
Yes sir. I'm sure having Mr. Bootsy Collins one of the best bass players to do it, be involved helped a lot as well.
The drummer at 3:46
I can't say anything in the comments that hasn't already been said. Just please hurry up and come in concert. ❤❤❤❤
This song deserves to be a single with explicit visuals. It is pure magic.   From Bruno's Impeccable Vocals to Anderson's insane drum beats pure🔥🔥🔥🔥. I'm stuck on this song. So beautiful.
I LOVE THIS SONG,,,,
Marvin Gaye would have been proud to hear this whole album. Especially this song right here!!
Talent…. Brilliant Talent all the way around!!!  Lyrics, instruments, TALENTS. Perfect timing 🌟

OH MY GOD 😱
I had my speaker on while sleeping and this song came on and the concert within my dreams was spectacular XD I hadn't heard this song by Bruno Mars yet but the whole time while in the dream, I couldn't help but think how beautiful this song is :)
Im loving these vocals this album is fire
A Música Mais Foda Slk Chega A Arrepiar!⚡️❤️
It would be priceless to be in the studio watching/listening to this song being Created. Sure I would be crying by the end. It’s too Merch 🥲😂🤣🔥 to digest outside of the studio 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼BEAUTIFUL ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
Old school love music ......
Disco genial
실크소닉, 브루노마스를 좋아하기 때문에 그들의 음악은 나에게 항상 감사합니다
I don't understand folks who keeps on bashing Bruno Mars because they like Paak. Like, geez. Just enjoy the effin music. Both of them are in good terms. Paak is getting the recognition he deserves so why are you guys so pressed about this? why keep on spreading hate? let's just enjoy their fucking music.
My god... Bruno...
Wow, amazing song.
This song has been stuck to my mind ever since i heard a week ago. I'm taken by the entire album man, it's so spiritual, out of this world 😭😭😭
Sounds like if lovin you is wrong I don't wanna be right
A deep SMTH behind this guys… I don’t know why but I feel pain… hope for your heeling soon…
Put on a
“ Tears of a Clown”. This song really takes you back! I love it!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Y’all betta sanggg
OMG THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR
this is Harmonie Heaven  yes wahnsinn
So good ❤️
Was youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuoooo youuuuuuuu
I am a child of the 70's.  With Silk Sonic, what is old is new again, and visa versa.  Love it.  Post-menopause, this music releases some mojo from my adrenals.
This song is simply AWESOME ☄️with the various interviews they’ve had and given credits to those they sought opinions from was truly not Wasted !!!🔥 I can also hear more and more compatibility in their vocals and lyrics. The one interview I remember the most is when BabyFace kept saying put more LOVE in it . During that interview Bruno said he had to pitch different tones that he wasn’t expecting and  they laughed saying Anderson found cords he didn’t know he had. Bottom line they listened, they relearned , they added ALL of it in this song 🔥🔥🔥☄️⚡️⚡️and genuinely did that !!!! Again👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼CONGRATS another job well done 🌟 INSTRUMENTS needs a Section on its own 🤭😂😂🤣😂😂😂🙈🤯🔥🔥🔥KILLIN
The Manhattans would be proud
Although they are singing about a lost love. This song made me think of my granny #RIH!! LOVE IT tho!!!!
This song already in my "My Fav songs" playlist!!! Love it so much!!!
Straight up musical dope. The drummer needs a raise, too.
This Song Is So Dope☑️☑️💯
I strongly recommend everyone take at least one opportunity to listen to this song with HEADPHONES on…..🔥🔥🔥SMH KILLING… murdering those “DRUMS and Sticks 🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥😌😂😊✨✨ Bruno hits his note’s….. TOASTED 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼ANDERSON 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🧨💯
Hmm. Hearing this —and I’m sure someone else can hear it— Im like Silk Sonic needs to write a song for Charlie Wilson.
Musicão
I SEE YOU ANDERSON with them drums!!!!!!! Especially towards the end. Like damn!!!! He NEVER ceases to amaze me.
Dude the high note is insane- like while singing this i paused like wait a minute- that’s pretty damn high ✨🤝
good Job!
ahhhh man, I'm late, but Bruno thank you for bringing R&B back. I didn't know they still made em like this
La letra de put on smile y de smoking out the window, representan mi historia, ☹️ todo lo que viví y sufrí por el amor de una persona que no me valoró, ahora me desahogo aquí, trato de ser fuerte , fingiendo que estoy bien, solo Dios sabe cuanto dolor sentí, hermosas canciones Bruno mars, Anderson paak , los mejores junto a silk Sonic, ufff lo mejor que pude haber oído.
This song portrays exactly how I’m feeling rn. Bruno you are a living legend
I think we all act happy when we are not it call being positive.
Bruno needs 2 go back 2 solo
True music.
3:00
Bringing back good music yes sir. Reminds me of my childhood.  Absolutely in love with this album. 🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤. Even my dad says them boys can sing whew weeeee😁🤣.
Best
Perfección ❤️❤️❤️
...my fav off this album; these bOys need do this one LIVE🙏👍❤
This song reminds me of love train, i love it.
I used to be a fan but now I’m a while air conditioner 😜
another grammy for each, but now together
Masterpiece album played over and over again in my car.
anybody knows any other artist that make this genre with a similiar voice? kinda like James Brown for example
I like Andreson Paak, he's talented, but Bruno Mars, his vocals take us somewhere, there's no point of returning.  You just wanna hear it again and again. I can't stop listening to your music.
this song is magic ❤️❤️
We need to take a step back and just appreciate this era we got to live in where Bruno is dropping fire like this 😎🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this is also i very good
How can this be so fking accurate.. Jesus..
Bruno vocal range is higher than the sky.💛☺️
Boy, do I feel this. It still hurts.
Mano tenho orgulho de ser seu fã 🇧🇷💙💚💛

I need a Silk Sonic Tiny Desk concert NOW
Vamos bruno !! Adelante 🥺🤟🏻
2022?
amazing
Great song and great voices. Son sings and LOVES you two. My husband LOVES Anderson. Thanks guys!!!
IDK how but Bruno Mars is the only singer i never lost interest since found…
🔥🎵♥️
Paak.  I can say for someone who ain’t an audiophile you’d have been a maestro on the drums in any era preceding. I loved the vocals when the track debuted but today I am more in tune with the drums. ♠️
Straight up 🔥
This album is 5-10 grammy worthy!!!  Silk Sonic is the shhhhhhh!!! I love the music!!! And not to mention all the guys are fine & sexy!!!
This song should be love by clownsss🤡
They should make a music video for this
Love Bruno's high note...like Confunkshun...Let me put Love on your mind...and Straight from the Heart, Awesome❤❤need more!!!
This is whole-heartedly my favorite song of not just this album, but ever! I just love it and I cry every time I sing this. I love your music Bruno!
I'M TRYNA PUT ON A SMILE!!!💯💯
Make this as a single!!!
I can’t believe we’re having this for free.
Bruno my son is half Filipino  like u, he ❤ to play your music on his guitar🎸daily & hope to meet u someday🙏
LOL
I cant put off my smile anymore 🥶
Que música linda! Romântica demais... Amei!!! Amo Bruno Mars!!
3:21 this part right here
This song tho ... 😘 😘 😘 😘
I swear, both Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak make this album great. The smoothness of Bruno’s voice and the pure grit from Anderson Paak. They’re both amazing, that’s all I gotta say. 😌👌
i love the scream
I love the song so so much！！It can't be better
This genre is called eargasmic. Only Bruno knows how to make this
No wonder this song has been on repeat...it speaks to my soul. Not heartbreak but battling depression: putting up a brave front, acting/faking, dying on the inside   (On the road to recovery, trying to find that spark again and belting this song definitely helps)
This is absolutely without doubt the coldest cut on the album !
This song is so beautiful and I honestly appreciated both Anderson's and Bruno's voice. Great collab.
Can we just talk about 3:27 for a moment?
Does music get any better then  this ???????
This song has me thinking about an ex i never had.
Geniooooo SOS el mejor 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 acá desde argentina aguante silk Sonic y el gran Bruno  toda una estrella
wow.
This song is so good and relatable like I be trynna put on a smile every damn day seriously ❤️
No matter how much I listen this song I get goosebumps everytime
Best song on the whole album 🙏
Bruno's brother on the drums is killing it.
Maybe we can bring back the lost art of slow dancing.  This music is too good.  Cannot get enough.
I used to be a fan but hearing all these songs I’m a whole windmill
Bruno's first crack at the chorus to this song gives me goosebumps every time!
This is masterpiece album!
Loveeeeee u Brunoooooo💖
love you bruno , waiting for you to come to INDIA
This song and leave the door open are both masterpieces old school variety
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
F*ck!!! This is good.
What happened to the video they used to have for this song? It was hilarious! XD
I hope they make a video of this song.
Lord I wish the album was also solde on vinyl😩
Lord I wish the album was also solde on vinyl😩
MAKE ANDERSON PAAK ACT MOVIE SCENES TOO!!!
BRUNO PUT ANDERSON PAAK IN THE OLD VIDEO TOO!!! I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM IN MOVIE SCENES TOO!!!!
UPLOAD THE OLD VIDEO!!!
Bruno’s vocal range is insane

😇
🥳🥳🥳😘
Lol Bars
I love this song:)
💯🔥❤
Such a good song.
This song is amazing!!!
This gives me crazy Jackson 5 vibes and sounds especially with Anderson sounding smack like Jermaine Jackson.
I absolutely love this song
that’s what i needed ❤️‍🔥
I really love this song 🎧 very much but you need to put a music video in February 2022
Anderson .Paak sounds like a young Jermaine Jackson during his Jackson 5 years. This song will be a classic for sure.
It's only been and handful of records like this put out in the last decade or so, that the masses know about. Silk Sonic has one, Tyrese "Shame" is one, Ed Sheeran has one, Sam Smith, that ballot record that puts you in a different light. We have to induct that new class of R&B greats and Bruno is 1st ballot. That boy has been consistent for 10 years plus now. Pop, soul, R&B, he's givin rappers hooks, he's gonna be one of those timeless artists if he's not that already.
Manjifiek
def my prefered song of this album just putting at max volume makes you feel like god
BEST SONG EVER!!!! 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Ya vuelta
Why am I today years old!!! Love this Motown vibe
Peak music
🔥
I know for them it's just another classic song....for me, it literally saved my marriage.
this is my first listen but omg its my new favorite
I really need to watch this live
This is what many songs sounded like in the 70s. It's refreshing to hear this sound again. Got me thinking about all the family members and friends who are no longer here that would've loved this. Thank you silk sonic. This was needed.
Oh, lookie here fellas Take it from your Uncle Bootsy Ain't no shame beggin' in the rain Tell her how you really feel Ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh  I could pretend when I'm out with my friends I ain't thinkin' about you I could pretend like I ain't in my feelings But that ain't true, nah (nah) When I called you out your name That was my ego, my pride and pain I should be a movie star The way I play the part Like everything's okay  Oh, now I try to be the life of the party All night, buying shots for everybody But it's all just an act (yeah) And I can't have you back (yeah) Without you runnin', going crazy  Tryna put on a smile (put on a smile) Tryna fight these tears from cryin' But Lord knows I'm dyin', dyin' Tryna put on a smile, smile (put on a smile) Ooh, out here smilin' like a fool When the only thing worth smilin' for Baby girl, the only thing worth smilin' for was You, you, you You, you, you, you, you You  If I could turn back the hands on my Rollie, you know I would I would've spent all my time makin' sure that my baby good I'm tryin' hard to hide the shame I know I'm playin' a dangerous game But since you been gone, I ain't been the same There's only so much a man can fake  Oh, I'm not tryna be the life of the party All night, buying shots for everybody But it's all just an act (yeah) And I can't have you back (yeah) Without you, I've been goin' crazy  Tryna put on a smile (put on a smile) Tryna fight these tears from cryin' But Lord knows I'm dyin', dyin' Tryna put on a smile (put on a smile), baby Out here smilin' like a fool When the only thing worth smilin' for Baby, you're the only thing worth smilin' for When the only thing worth smilin' for Baby, you're the only thing worth smilin' for was You, you, you  I'm tryna put on a smile (put on a smile) Oh-oh-oh, tryna fight these tears from cryin' But Lord knows I'm dyin' (put on a smile) I'm smilin' like a fool When the only thing worth smilin' for Baby, you're the only thing worth smilin' for When the only thing worth smilin' for Oh, the only thing worth smilin' for was You, you, you You, you, you, you, you
I’m professional bass player with 30 years of experience. I’m so proud of Bruno and Anderson. Silk Sonic is not a collaboration. This is a group of young musical geniuses that know their craft, they are doing what they always wanted, in my opinion this is the best group since Earth Wing and Fire.  Thank you., real music with heart and passion. Outstanding.
💜💜💜💜🙏🙏🙏🙏
This CD is really
Finally, a ballad! That's what that era was known for. Loved the dramatic strings to start us off. This reminds me of Curtis Mayfield or moreso even Smokey Robinson...this sounds like Motown. This all sounds so familiar, like I could even predict where some of those notes were headed.   Bruno's high note runs are exceedingly beautiful. But that bait-and-switch at 3:26 is heavenly.   Anderson's voice and drum fills bring the old, and mesh well with Bruno's voice which sound new  I'm only sad that they didn't end it on a triumphant note at the end. The conflict remains unresolved, ending in that sad minor chord. Bitter-sweet indeed.  Definitely the best track on the album. Song of the year for me
Anderson really KILLIN his intro ….pitch perfect lyrics in this song. Heard more of him in this song. If I was blessed to see them in concert I would die just staring at Bruno. I’m too old to be crying at a concert but I might have to make an exception due to the Beauty of this song. If you can get past the lyrics the build up of that BASS and Drums🔥🔥🔥🔥are going to break you down either way. This is incredibly  well coordinated with vocals, harmonies, instruments all combustion blowing at same time throughout this BEAUTIFUL SONG ✨😳✨✨CONGRATS to everyone. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🔥🔥
going back to soul and funk. It's much better than the pop Bruno made famous imo. Less commercial.
Lots of songs don't have 2 great hooks. That one has 3! These Bruno and Anderson are off da hook!
🤑🤑🤑🤑
Anderson Paak is such a vibe.
Co-written by Babyface!!
They need to make this a music video, it will blow up no cap✊👌
Absolute musical genius
Oh my God! ❤️
Best song on album!  The drums are amazing in this cut as well as vocals
This really puts a smile on my face,heart,soul and so the rest of the album
This song truly melts my heart every  time I hear it. They sound so passionate and sincere.  If it’s an relationship issue, friendship issue anything you truly loved and let go over foolishness this song will beat your heart down slowly and what’s left the instruments will kill. LOVE THIS SONG……. Bitter/sweet ✨✨✨✨😢
If I was going through a breakup and heard this I'd be done for
This is the type of music we need nowadays. We need creators like Bruno and Anderson who pour their souls into their craft. That's what's missing nowadays.
This song here 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love this whole album!
Your best album, welcome to the world of the funk.
Que buena cancion
here bc sarah baska said this album was great
I love how Silk Sonic  has taken the torch to the new generation . That classic old school vibe is timeless .
S A U D A D E!  M E U 🌟A M O R!!!❤
LOVE Bruno Mars but his jam with Anderson is superb. Love these 2 artist together.
As a higher Baritone… the amount of respect I have for Bruno for everything past 2:56 is phenomenal 🥺🥺
Super song!!!!
Just the best I have heard for a very very long time....in love with this beautiful music, voices & mood ❤❤❤❤
Go ahead sip that Henny ( or whatever that is you prefer )  .. now close your eyes and get ready to be blown away by this track.. Enjoy your trip.
I just can’t stop listening to the entire album. Constantly. I am overwhelmed 😍💕
I miss you baby girl :(
Of course the vocals are🔥 but please notice Paak on the drums on this jam.
I can't help but sing along to this even though I'm sure it sound horrific to any soul nearby haha.
this song hits so hard for me rn
Wow, these are the Coolest Funkiest souls I have heard in a long time. Bless you Anderson .Paak & Bruno Mars. The Sickest!! ; )
Que música é essa meus amigos!!!! Pqp os caras são os melhores!!!!!!!!!
I need a live performance of this song and blasting off !!! Please!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
this one of those songs where even if you cant relate, you still  kinda can
Oh crap. As soon as it started, I got goosebumps.
Love you bruno 😪
im cryinggggg I love this song omgggg
3:27 I’m DYYIIING  🥵😭😭
I haven't heard someone sing their face off like that in a loooong time.
My favorite part is at 2:26 when Bruno does that run at the end of the word smile just so beautiful
Damn this is a smooth Detroit gangsta jam <3
These 2 are geniuses. I am fan.
That's what the mask is 😔
Bruno mars you are the best i love you and i'm your fan
Put on a smileeeeeeee 😩😩😩😩
Is it me or the video vinish off of YouTube
this song almost made cried
believe it
but bruno mars and anderson Paak are legends
this is the most beautiful song in their album
It should be a crime to be able to sing as well as Bruno Mars.
Sing the song y’all 😩😩😩
Album of the decade right here
Brouno mars and anderson paak did a great job.
Whew y’all better sing the song 🗣🗣🗣😩😩😩
Impossível não ouvir milhares de vezes.
This is thee Best I heard in years Definitely Because I am old school 60sh Club
For real, some real music n voices, Iam used to pounding my head on a table to any beeeat. Class.
Thank you both so much for keeping soul ALIVE 🖤
U ever watch nutty professor 2 Bruno sayin you like the uncle at the wedding😂
Feel this shit more than ever. 🥃🥃
We reacted to this amazing song! Truly a masterpiece of an album
All u hear is insanely incredible vocals and insanely incredible drumbeat.
The range of emotion in this song is insane
Sounds like a Smokey Robinson record! These dudes are the truth!
💝💖💕💝💖💕💝💖💕💝💖💕💝💖💕
When Silk Sonic releases their tour dates believe me it will be SOLD OUT everywhere I mean everywhere
bring back men begging in the rain
My absolute favorite song was ‘’when i was your man’’. But after hearing this, i don’t know anymore. Which is better? When I Was Your Name vs Put on A Smile
This song is perfection 🤩🔥
I just listen to this on repeat. Bruno’s voice towards the end is soul crushing. You can hear the emotions as he literally croons high and then goes higher in his vocals. It just literally takes my breath away. It leaves me speechless. I’m not even in a relationship and this song just makes me want to cry. It’s that good. Bravo Silk Sonic. The whole album is fire. As far as the fans go, you two already won the Grammy of Kings in our hearts. I think Michael Jackson would have been proud. Bruno gives me MJ vibes when he was young.
mooi
You messed up. At least you know it.
Broo this hit hard 😳
Owwwwwwwwwwww😍😍👏🏻👏🏻💃🕺👌🏻😌📣💥
Great album.great song
Put on smile us the song I am stuck on this week. Ever since I found out my right eye 👁 has been going blind this is the song I have been relating to. I really put on a smile when I walk out my front door.
3:26 WOW 🙌🏽
This song perfect describes my current situation.....dying inside but have to put on a smile
If I was ever Blessed to see LIVE PERFORMANCE there would be no wasting time with pictures, etc…..  I’ll FOREVER have image in my head. This is a real Adult song. Sounds serious and sincere. Never had one… LOL…. But this song is like a big explosive Orgy of Music, Visualizing Instruments, Vocals, blending of Lyrics , Bruno, Anderson, all the harmonies and background vocals coming at you in one BIG FORCE🔥🔥🔥🔥burning up EVERYTHING in a climatic firestorm and you’re left drained in disbelief of what just hit you !!! Congrats to every aspect of this experience and magnificent collaboration ✨✨✨✨👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼💯💯💯💯🥲🥲🥲🌊🌊🔥🔥
I REALLY JUST LOVE LOVE THIS SONG !!!!! I think Anderson leading in the beginning is Awesome. His vocals on point like I’ve never heard 🔥🔥🔥🔥Bruno coming in after that PERFECT PITCH✨✨✨✨✨INSTRUMENTS KILLING ENTIRE SONG 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😢
I hear a little bit of Sara Smile in this record. What a great record
This song deserves a Live version!
I’m DYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYIIINNNNNN
Brilliant
feels very weird looking at the "3 million views" cuz it deserves more! Fuck BTS and Olivio Rodrigo, put Silksonic on top!
amo a silk sonic, me hacen feliz, pero a la vez emotiva por el sentimiento de la cancion, me sinto libre y en paz, ojala nunca paren de hacer musica, mi eterno amor a ellos.
bruno mars is a singer without a doubt doesn't exist anymore in the world he is the last he can be the second but heard with anderson but he will always be the first because he has that soul mixing all styles in one
Big fan or Bruno Mars but Anderson Paak together, Silk Sonic !! I listen to this album everyday !! Its 🔥🔥🔥🔥😎
#BrunoMars, #AndersonPaak #SilkSonic This song means so much to mean right now.❤ My husband has a mass in his head. Plus I found out I have 50% blockage in my heart and I am going blind in one eye. So put on a smile has hit home a lot these past couple of days.  Thanks guys. Love the album I listen to it all the time. ❤❤😘
Straight Masterpiece 🏆
Absurdo de música 💕💕🇧🇷
This song made me really cryyy like a B%TCH
The heart of the album.❤
Asalamualaikum
😢Those lyrics combined with the drumming and high notes from Bruno then the combination at the end literally has me holding my breath every time like it’s the first time!!!! SMH 🔥💫✨✨✨🤭🔥🔥🔥💯
Pqp, QUE HINOOO ❤️❤️ TE AMO BRUNO MARS! TRAZ O SILK SONIC PARA O BRASIL, POR FAVOR NUNCA TE PEDI NADA
Bruno Mars you always making me more proud of being your fan,  coz you impress the whole world with your music
They hit the right crazy note at the right crazy time. Damn this song is crazy !!!! Salute !!!!
This has a New Birth, Soul Children vibe.  Can't go wrong with that kind of vibe.
Worrying about your relationship with this song and weed hit different.😒
I swear i saw the official video of this song and now i don't find it
Hate to say it but this won't be a single and will become the album's deep cut like how Bruno Mars left Too Good to Say Goodbye. I also feel like this track should be the album's closer.
gosu
I love your song Bruno Mars, I really appreciate your work and your amazings songs, i feel so good when i listen this music because is so nice and very beautiful.
I’m sure this song is going to be beyond FANTASTIC when they do it live. I’m already feeling the burning just thinking about it. Those DRUMS ( Anderson) is killing. Someone will be crying 🥲during the holidays !💯🔥✨✨💜✨
Rest of the industry should feel ashamed and humbled in front of these cats. Best music made in the recent 20 years. This whole album is just amazing...
Please, perform this song at the Grammys 2022!
I’m an old head - this song is my favorite on the album.   ♥️♥️♥️
Absolutely in love with you guys🌹✨😍your music has that special feeling most artists can't bring to me🤩🤩🤩anyway I really look forward to hearing more from y'all ✨🦋Lot's of love to y'all from Me♡
I ABSOLUTELY cannot wait to see them perform this song LIVE

Y’all deserve a Grammy istg
Bruno voice tho 🔥
Everybody been here act like it don't hurt....................
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩        HIT AFTER DARN HIT..........
Holy shit. I'm blessed to have Bruno.. and now w Anderson right now bringing it back home. Two very necessaries in our music history.
I just cannot express how much I love this track - the lyrics, musicianship, sincerity and quality of vocals are off the scale.  I appreciate many types of music but my heart lies forever with old school soul - and I know this will remain in my ever-changing top 3.

❤❤❤
If they dont get a grammy imma be so mad stg.
WE NEED A LIVE PERFORMANCE OF PUT ON A SMILE!!!!!!!
Fun Fact: Babyface was one of the writers listed on this song. Bootsy Collins, who hosts the Silk Sonic album was the one who gave him the nickname "Babyface" because of how young he looked.
Look here fellas Take it from your Uncle Bootsy Ain't no shame beggin' in the rain Tell her how you really feel  Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  I could pretend when I'm out with my friends I ain't thinkin' about ya I could pretend like I ain't in my feelings but that ain't true, nah When I called you out your name That was my ego, my pride, and pain I should be a movie star, the way I play the part Like everything's okay  Oh, not tryna be the life of the party Oh, not buyin' shots for everybody But it's all just an act I can't have you back Without you I've been going crazy Tryna put on a smile (Put on a smile) Tryna fight these tears from cryin' But lord knows I'm dyin', dyin' tryna put on a smile (Put on a smile) Smile Ooh, out here smilin' like a fool (When the only thing worth smiling for) Baby girl, the only thing worth smiling for was You (You) You You, you, you, you, you (You, you, you, you, you) You Ooh  If I could turn back the hands on my Roly you know I would I would've spent all my time makin' sure that my baby good I'm tryin' hard to hide the shame I know I'm playin' a dangerous game But since you've been gone I ain't been the same There's only so much a man can fake  Oh, not tryna be the life of the party Oh, not buyin' shots for everybody But it's all just an act I can't have you back Without you I've been going crazy Tryna put on a smile (Put on a smile) Tryna fight these tears from cryin' But lord knows I'm dyin', dyin' tryna put on a smile (Put on a smile) Baby Out here smiling like a fool (When the only thing worth smiling for) Baby girl, the only thing worth smiling for (When the only thing worth smiling for) Baby girl, the only thing worth smiling for was You You, you (You)  I'm tryna put on a smile (Put on a smile)  Tryna fight these tears from cryin' But lord knows I'm dyin' (Put on a smile) Ah, baby I'm smiling like a fool  (When the only thing worth smiling for) Baby, you're the only thing worth smiling for (When the only thing worth smiling for) Oh, the only thing worth smiling for was You (You) You You, you, you, you, you (You, you, you, you, you)

Wow! This Album is Sweeter than sweet it reminds me of my Young Days now older in numbers but young at heart I’m really feeling it😀
Someone needs to make an amv of joker and Harley to this
Del nuevo álbum, esta es mi canción favorita!!!!!!
Giving me life
WHERE THE HELL IS THE MUSIC VIDEO THIS HAD A MUSIC VIDEO
THIS SHOULD BE ILLEGAL FOR HOW AMAZINGLY AWESOME EVERY SONG ON THE ALBUM IS LIKE HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?? 😭😭 that breath support from Bruno was just AHHH *chefs kiss*
the way this song has a CHOKEHOLD on me 😫
Marvin please listen this...
Woohoo!!! Now this is the shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeet I've been waiting for. Wasn't a fan of earlier music but this album and son is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bruno and Andy's voice together is like Peanut Butter and Jelly, absolutely amazing❤️🔥. And this album is theee best Album ❤️🔥.
🔥🔥❤️❤️
This one is getting played on our way back from away days as a Man City fan in the car 🔵🔥
Yass!!!! So brilliant!!! 70s and 80s best decades!!!
This needs to be a single
Music video needed
I hope this is their next single....fire.
Bruno burnin it up as usual 😊🔥
They need this.....
One of the touching songs of this album, music, vocals, lyrics all penetrate the soul💓.  I am grateful to you for the emotions from this amazing song, please promote it to the masses🙏
Anderson is todays David Ruffin, so much realness in his voice.
Love this song 🔥❤❤😊
Paak giving me David Ruffin vibes and on this track
My favorite track on the album. Love the lyrics and the tone 🙂
I just love this song. 🥰🥰🥰
I would love ❤️ to see this song performed live!
That 3:03 tho 💯💯💯🤝🤝🤝
I am feelin the pain. I needed this song. Right now in my life at this very moment,I am putting on a smile.
"But since you've been gone, I ain't been the same There's only so much a man can fake"         This makes me goosebumps.
I Love this Song!!! I feel the pain in their voices.
Question here, does anyone actively hate/dislike this album? I definitely don't, although some songs aren't the best for my preference. This was almost close to a perfect album. These vocals tho.
This is my anthem now. It hurts a lot 💔
song could’ve came out in 1972.
The Brothers gave us SOOOOUUUUULLLLLLL! Let's recognize both of these MUSICAL GENIUSES for such a massive body of work
Damian Marley - There For You That, "You" part sung, kinda sounds similar.
This album > certified boy lover
Best song on album
💛
0:32
Once again nothing but 🔥🔥🔥
I cried listening. I'm not in a relationship or anything... my situation is just so shitty and that's it. I just cried. _What a soulful song._
#BrunoMars #AndersonPaak #SilkSonic I truly have a smile for your music. It melts my heart. Bruno's dancing just hits a spot. ❤❤❤❤
Love this song. A potential #1.
Well it caught me tonight. I’ve been able to love this song and stay in separate lane…. My number one person in life passed unexpectedly from heart attack. He held me down through my only child death. Then my husband passing. Prior to my husband passing he said I should marry him. He knew our close relationship.  I’m all the way broke down right now! Didn’t want to get hit like this😭😭😭😭😢
oooooohhhh the "YOUUUUUUU (youuuu) YOUUUUUUU " part is so insane. its so good
I'm looking forward for a live performance of this. I'm sure Bruno will make this even more better in live like what he usually did.
This whole album is perfect
Masterpiece
Contemporary Masterpiece that is. Gone through lots of soul records but this song and the complete album stands on its own. To put it together like this you have take long dives to the bottom of the butter.
Where is the random person with the lyrics🤔
Bruno you are a gift from God. Thank you for sharing your gift with all of us nutty fans. Your voice could melt an ice burg lol take care stay safe your fan Michelle from Canada 🇨🇦
Bruno Mars + Anderson Paak = Poems. Both are Monsters  🗣️🔊🎶🎼🎵
3:32 those were the highest notes HES ever sang before
Una vez más Bruno ❤️
I WANT TO SEE THIS LIVE!!!!!!!!
Boy ! This a cut ! It’s 640 and I’m charged up for the day off this one ! Man this whole album is classic already
For me this is the special one from the album, it just hits so hard, it should be put out in the air, amazing you 2 in this performance, very proud of you guys, fucking love this song 💙 haven’t heard a good song in a while 💙

This album is 💥 causing so much good feels
that 1:57 run was simple but perfectly done.
i've been watching a few reactions to this song and they all seem to comment on paaks voice in the second verse (almost like they think thats the first time they can hear his voice), leading me to believe that people think its bruno singing first LMAO. I hope people aren't sleeping on paak this much!!
One of the best songs I've ever herd!
Sem dúvidas esse é um dos melhores álbuns dos últimos tempos 🌟
Love, love, love this kind of music.  Sensual but not overly sexualized. Romantic.
nice
Anderson .Paak and Bruno Mars, arguably the greatest matchup since Peanut butter and Chocolate.
Esta música é a fina flor da sofrência. Awesome!
I want to see Anderson Paak singing this song live...♥️
Bruno has a GOD given talent 👍
braba demais, o pai tá on
This album is dope!!!! Where have I been
I want this song on single !!!! And Bruno's voice 😍
I’m obsessed with this song!they both sound so good but it’s something about Bruno’s voice that does something to my soul!
best song in the album 🤕💛
I'm here before this song gets viral
What is so cool is that Babyface collaborated on this song also! Just amazing to him and Bootsy Collins? Too much!!💜💜💜💜
Anderson just puts a cherry on top for this song👌🏿
Best song on the album 😭😭😭
♥️❤️💖♥️❤️💖♥️❤️💖♥️❤️💖♥️❤️💖
this is a song you feel
3:25 TOP TIER VOCALISSSTTTT
My favorite track off this album!

I love bruno mars voice so much....
This song is so cool ❤ can't stop playing
https://youtube.com/shorts/JA1GxyATZRA?feature=share
If this relationship goes south, you know where to find me.
30 simple minutes of JOY. That’s all I need . They know how great they are . The music in untouchable. I just would like 30 short minutes to say thank you at my age for bringing .joy and life back to my heart. Body guards don’t have to worry. I’ll say THANK YOU and Never forget the experience. Sincerely! 💜✨✨✨✨🥲
I wish the weekend would do a track with some nice instruments in the back and just flex like Bruno does here
This is one of the best songs I heard in my life
Did Silk Sonic's ALBUM meet Grammy's 2022 nom deadlines? Heard only "Leave the door open" track qualified. Is this true?
Bruno is the new Bobby Womack 🔥
Bruno  and Andy have on those dark shades during early morning interviews.  You guys be sleeping during the interview and hungover as get out. I love the way he and Andy has each other best interests at hand. Praise Christ for the unconditional love  LOL
🔊🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
The whole album good but this one hear is my shiiii
He's coming back
When Anderson first comes in, do not tell me you can’t hear a Temptations David Ruffin in his prime come through his voice there!
By far one of my favorite songs…. Been here before
This is a masterpiece, I cannot stop listening to it.  I hope the world gives this duo the recognition it deserves.
Best song on the album BY FAR imo
One of the greatest songs of all time
This song is... I- I have no words it made me cry its so beautiful We love you silk Sonic and MJ! Please you guys keep making music without no harm to each other! please promise me that I love you!
Man come on now thai the best album out right now
Does someone know from who the intro beat (0:00 - 0:08) was sampled?
I saw the official video it hilarious, but why Mr Bruno didn't publish it?
Utter perfection ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Imagine how immaculate a Bruno Mars and Whitney Houston collaboration would sound.
❤❤❤
Love love love this song!!! Paak’s voice is so rich !
Beautiful!!
The whole collaboration is a classic, a total masterpiece! Exceptionally well thought out and relatable.. People, we are witnessing greatness!
Bruno ❤❤❤
MARAVILHOSO 🥰❤💗
This one hits deep. My favorite song on this platinum album.
AP Murdered the Drums on this song. Bruno hit those those note transitions so fucking good made me wanna act depressed for no reason but to feel the mood of the song😂😂😂
Caramba mano, esse álbum inteiro é uma obra-prima, na moral!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
MY MOM IS FIGHTING STAGE 4 CANCER I CAN TELL SHE IS TIRED THIS IS ME TRYING PUT ON A SMILE EVERYDAY BUT IM HURTING THIS SONG SPEAKS TO ME
So higher
☁️
3:16 that long note- so much stevie wonder  in this
This is my favorite song on the album 💯💯🙌🏾🔥
Correct.
Best song.  Love it
Hot 100: #78  Every song from the album is charting on the Hot 100 and Bubbling Under charts.
Every Soul needs this album in their life
I'm so glad y'all finished the album so for me it's sold love y'all ❣️
All you need is a long 70s car and a yellow text graphic
This song will go tremendously stonks when people will be heart broken, more than "when I was your man" and "talking to the moon"
Just saw the video they made for this song ..... I'm confused; it doesn't match the song at all
Is this the 70's version of "If I Was Your Man"? Great song, btw.  Best song on the album.
This is the heart of the album ... damn the beginning...
This song is truly special. You can feel their feelings as they sing. So much passion in their voices. This song makes me cry from the pain they portray in their voices, and from the journey they take us on in the music. It's so beautiful. Anderson did a masterful job ( gods would say it was God tier level) and Bruno just kept doing what he does with his insanely angelic voice and range. This song is the real gem among gems in the album.
This song has a vintage Main Ingredient feel; back when Don McPherson was the lead singer.
If the Silk Sonic album wins more than the 7 Grammy's of 24K Magic then we can talk about how Andy in any way significantly contributed to Bruno Mars' career as an artist and musician. The "little ASIAN LATINO guy" has been winning Grammy's (11 times, 30 plus times nominated) and other major awards both as singer and songwriter and smashing charts way way before Paak came into the picture.
Paak's whiny Paakshouldgetallthecredit fans here dissing Bruno to raise Paak up is killing all the vibe. Shouldn't u guys be thankful to Bruno because if not for him, Paak will never taste that Billboard top 10 in his entire career. Like every artist trying to survive the industry, Paak needs to stay relevant and to be on the general audience's radar (not just to people who know him). Your insulting someone Paak has on numerous occasions thanked bec. the Silk Sonic collaboration skyrocketed his career and introduced him to a much larger audience esp. to the international fans of mainstream pop and RnB. If you think Paak is better than Bruno as an artist then why the hell is Bruno immensely popular with an astonishing more than a decade career bagging Grammy's (11 times mind u) and other major awards. Are your opinion of who is a better artist more credible than the people literally millions of people around the world and people in America's music industry including music legends who say otherwise? I'm not saying Bruno is better artist than Paak. They're both equally talented and have both contributed to the creation and success of the album along with other people who worked on it like Dmile and Bootsy Collins. It's just stupid for you assholes to ruin the vibe by coming in here like Paak is the one who carried the entire album. Lol. The audacity when the song is literally in Bruno's youtube channel. Shut up and just enjoy the damn song.
I have never moved so hard to a song before. This is literally amazing
That is my song 🎵!!!!! Fire 🔥
One of the best song I've ever heard..... wow !!
SOMEBODY GOT ISSUES!
This is the musical, lyrical and emotional peak of the album.
Now that's the "Talking To The Moon" Bruno Mars I know and love 😍
https://youtu.be/2bNnqmkzLnU
Albun of the year🔥
Life
Man
1:01
I want Bruno to lead not Andy.    Without Bruno Andy will still be underrated.
This is reminiscent of Motown and good for the soul.
i came for the vocals....i stayed for dem CHORDSSS, dang! smooth like a new born.
Grown man shit
I listened to this song for a few dozen times and still cant get bored of it. I mean i dont have the same things in my life as in the song, just the complexity of the song is captivating. And i thought that only the smoking out the window will be good, i was so wrong.
3:32 reminds me of young michael jackson!
This is without a doubt the best song in the album!
Remix with: Charlie Wilson and Lenny Williams pls. Thanks.
My God this is good.
Masterpiece
Love their old school vibe together. This song reminds me of Distant Lover by Marvin Gaye👍✌
When is the album coming out?
3:25 Legendary!!!🤌😎
certified lover boy gonna be the album of the year Bruno mars: hold my beer
I wonder if this is on vinyl I have a Crosley Cruiser Deluxe record player and I would love to have this on vinyl
Legend says Bruno still hitting that damn note at 3:27
Oh, look here fellas Take it from your Uncle Bootsy Ain't no shame beggin' in the rain Tell her how you really feel Ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh I can pretend when I'm out with my friends I ain't thinkin' about you I can pretend like I ain't in my feelings But that ain't true, nah (Nah) When I called you out your name That was my ego, my plan and pain I should be a movie star The way I play the part Like everything's okay Oh, not tryna be the life of the party Oh, not that, just for everybody But it's all just a knack That I can't have you back Without you runnin', goin' crazy Tryna put on a smile (Put on a smile) Tryna fight these tears from cryin' But Lord knows I'm dyin', dyin' Tryna put on a smile, smile (Put on a smile) Ooh, I'm just smilin' like a fool When the only thing worth smilin' for Baby girl, the only thing worth smilin' for was You, you, you You, you, you, you, you You If I could turn back the hands on my Rollie, you know I would I would've spent all my time makin' sure that my baby good I'm tryin' hard to hide the shame I know I'm playin' a dangerous game But since you been gone, I ain't been the same There's only so much to make off fame Oh, I'm not tryna be the life of the party Oh, not that, just for everybody But it's all just a knack But I can't have you back Without you runnin', goin' crazy Tryna put on a smile (Put on a smile) Tryna fight these tears from cryin' But Lord knows I'm dyin', dyin' Tryna put on a smile (Put on a smile), baby I'm just smilin' like a fool When the only thing worth smilin' for Baby girl, the only thing worth smilin' for When the only thing worth smilin' for Baby girl, the only thing worth smilin' for was You, you, you I'm tryna put on a smile (Put on a smile) Oh-oh-oh, tryna fight these tears from cryin' But Lord knows I'm dyin' (Put on a smile) I'm smilin' like a fool When the only thing worth smilin' for Baby girl, the only thing worth smilin' for When the only thing worth smilin' for Oh, the only thing worth smilin' for was You, you, you You, you, you, you, you Source: Musixmatch
Love this one, reminds me a lot of old Bruno's songs
Bruno ❤❤
Silk Sonic’s Purple Rain
Hope they make a video
Let's go back to the good music
I can hear how much the vocals hurt their vocal cords, and it's joyous to the soul. Conveying emotion can take a tow on you.
This song is amazing.
My favorite song on the album 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤 I hope they do a visual
May be stretch but: A title reference to an identical lyric in "Voices in My Head"? If you know, you know.
BRUNO NEVER MISSES. THIS WAS THE DUO WE NEVER KNEW WE NEEDED.
i wake up 5am for work and this is all i bump to the whole way to work. Especially this particular song
Andys vocals are on point, His voice is so soulful. Bruno is a beast as well, they complement each other so well.
BEAUTIFUL SONG!  I am loving the whole album but this one is so SPECIAL.  Men singing about REAL FEELINGS.  This touches the heart.    Such a gift nowadays.  LOVE SILK SONIC!
Anderson Paak + Bruno Mars = Perfection

Please please PLEASE release this as a single
Bruno with the high notes, and anderson with the 1st and 2nd was 🔥
Listen yall but if there was an MV for this it would be set in 90s where  your prom date ditches you and you are in the middle of the party just pretending to enjoy yourself.
Ah shit 0:01 second in and it’s already hitting me deep 😭🙌🏻
Bruno Mars never fails to create music that will surely last for lifetimes.
they need charlie wilson on one of these bruh omg. Great song nevertheless. Amazing work!
this is how men love their women(vice-versa) way back 70's,-90's. that butterflies on their stomachs.
to the maxxxxxxxxxxx
Keep putting on a smile. 👌, 🥰 Ya, bye. 😉.
Those drums are amazing and the drums are crying with that soul. This song is perfection. With funk, soul and the places these guys both took their voices. Amazing
Smokey-Robinson inspired. Reminiscent of Tracks of my Tears.
Those drums tho
Damn this one deserves a music video🔥🔥

Look here fellas Take it from your Uncle Bootsy Ain't no shame beggin' in the rain Tell her how you really feel  Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  I could pretend when I'm out with my friends I ain't thinkin' about ya I could pretend like I ain't in my feelings but that ain't true, nah When I called you out your name That was my ego, my pride, and pain I should be a movie star, the way I play the part Like everything's okay  Oh, not tryna be the life of the party Oh, not buyin' shots for everybody But it's all just an act I can't have you back Without you I've been going crazy Tryna put on a smile (Put on a smile) Tryna fight these tears from cryin' But lord knows I'm dyin', dyin' tryna put on a smile (Put on a smile) Smile Ooh, out here smilin' like a fool (When the only thing worth smiling for) Baby girl, the only thing worth smiling for was You (You) You You, you, you, you, you (You, you, you, you, you) You Ooh  If I could turn back the hands on my Roly you know I would I would've spent all my time makin' sure that my baby good I'm tryin' hard to hide the shame I know I'm playin' a dangerous game But since you've been gone I ain't been the same There's only so much a man can fake  Oh, not tryna be the life of the party Oh, not buyin' shots for everybody But it's all just an act I can't have you back Without you I've been going crazy Tryna put on a smile (Put on a smile) Tryna fight these tears from cryin' But lord knows I'm dyin', dyin' tryna put on a smile (Put on a smile) Baby Out here smiling like a fool (When the only thing worth smiling for) Baby girl, the only thing worth smiling for (When the only thing worth smiling for) Baby girl, the only thing worth smiling for was You You, you (You)  I'm tryna put on a smile (Put on a smile)  Tryna fight these tears from cryin' But lord knows I'm dyin' (Put on a smile) Ah, baby I'm smiling like a fool  (When the only thing worth smiling for) Baby, you're the only thing worth smiling for (When the only thing worth smiling for) Oh, the only thing worth smiling for was You (You) You You, you, you, you, you (You, you, you, you, you)
this song is a whole religious experience. bruno put his whole soul during those high notes
Next single
Andy found his inner David Ruffin for this one. Man...
Now all we need is a (or several) live performance :) loving this vibe
Wow this is AMAZING. This is so good I'm tearing up🔊🔊🔥🔥. Definitely a classic to be played in other eras
Bruno never lost his touch, I still get goosebumps from his voice❤️👏
Omg this is to be your next sINgle
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is simply lush, good singing, lyrics and orchestration, feel good factor thanks guys
Waiting this song live😥💔
This SONG!!! OMGOODNESSS!!! I love the whole album, but THIS RIGHT HERE!!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽❤❤❤😍😍😍
Man, I don't know about you guys, but I dare say, we need to see a video for this jam baby!  All of them to be exact!  Great album. Puts me in the right head space to deal with 2021 drama!
People on here talking mess about who made this Album what it is! smdh!  LISTEN UP,  Bruno needed Anderson to spice up this Album, Anderson needed Bruno to also spiced up this Album!! They both needed each other to do their part, with their UNIQUE tone of voice to show the quality of each song on the Album!  Anderson has a superb sexy voice to suit his kind of music as an Artist, and so does Bruno Mars who also has a sexy voice to his kind of music!  Everybody is not going to like Bruno Mars and everybody is not going to like Anderson .Paak!  So why argue about this shit! Everyone has their own oppinion and taste in music and song! They are both great Artist together and on their own!  The ALBUM needed BOTH of them, period!!!  But you have to admit, there is (alittle edge) here, Bruno is bringing MORE fame to Anderson .Paak, because Bruno is MORE well known in many countries, and that's a FACT!!  Even if Anderson has a better voice than Bruno (to some people) he is still NOT a worldwide figure like Bruno Mars!!  This all depends on people's taste in what they like (personally)!  And remember, Bruno's music, is loved, by many different age groups, cause he does so many genres (constantly), whereas, Anderson is more limited to a (jazzy) type Rap music that suits his raspy sexy voice, which will NOT reach many young people but an older group.  He did not do alot of (different genres) like Bruno does.  Anderson always had fame, but Bruno is (adding) more fame to him, and that's the freaking truth!!  In conclusion, THEY ARE BOTH LIVING LEGENDS, in their own right, and I LOVE them both!!!!!  Stop comparing them now, they are Silk Sonic as a DUO!  Just love them and support them, damn it!!!  Have a good day!
Please dont make a mv for this song, im so not looking forward to see this as a tiktok sound.
H.E.R cover 🙏🏽🤔😮‍💨 that’d sound great 🥰
At this point it's just silly to wait. Just hand over to them every possible industry award available and get it done.
YESSSSSS….This song did not need a second play back to know it is a HIT.
Bruno really flexed his angelic vocals🤩
Silk sonic is brilliant...Paak and Bruno are a super group..great song writing and the singing is on the next, next level ..
👍
This masterpiece will make so many air conditioner s
Wow!!, made me feel questionable about my life, this song hits hard, and thats a good thing Mr.Mars and Mr.Paak, absolutely beautiful and I'm only 14. Lovely<3
The best álbum ever ❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️
Anderson sound like tyrese. Am I the only one hearing this?

GB you guys in having a fantastic career in your music culture. Love your collab with Bootsy Collins with this album. Much 💕 to you Bruno Anderson Paak, and Silk Sonic. Love you videos. ,💯🙌💯🥰💯🕊️
Yamete kudasai ~ oniichan 😔
This is like old Bruno, but improved. I love it.
que puta locura de tema
Paak and Mars and their marvellous countermusicians are bringing out the best in everyone. A match so bright ...just like Lennon / McCartney years ago For me the damn best album since years and real music just handmade. Simply adorable.
Uncle Bootsy, baby. Love it!
The uncultured are the only ones that don’t see Mars and Paak as equals on this album
Truly masterpiece, this song calm my mind every time I got stressed after work
Anybody getting  R Kelly vibes? I don’t know which song but
Best song luv it
É aqui que eu amolo meu chifre.  ✌🏼🇧🇷

This is definitely the best song on the album.
Perfect for a long ride
Me encanta este álbum Gracias por compartir
I love yall music just don't like that one song call the women a (B##Ch Little degrading
Bruno felt every letter DAMN
Não faz uma música ruiiiim manoo
tämä on sairasta
I've seen a lot of reactions to this song and 3:26 always seems to cause the reactors to turn quiet as if they can feel the longing pain that bruno mars expresses on this part.   10/10 my favorite song of the album.
definitely one of my favorite albums this year
Yeah
This song makes me miss the EX I never had lol, I'm just in my feelings because of the lyrics 😅
❤❤❤❤
I love how melancholic but sweet this song sounds. Also 3:03 sounds like Bruno’s other song Calling All My Lovelies
Not good
A masterpiece! The best song on the album.
Bruno's songs are always my light in the dark.
OH MY GOODNESS 😫‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
https://youtu.be/pOD2htrlCjo
This is one of those times that you'd say, Thank God for the good music
Who are the 300 people who dislike this 🔥🔥🔥?!?!
some great gatsby shit but without the sparknotes
yeeeeeesss
chills.
Nah otro level el de Bruno en esta canción, ambos son geniales. Increíble album!!!
Omg 😍
This shit is just Grenade part 2
Ain't no shame begging in the rain
This must be the next single...
I so love the drummin'
I grew up listening to 45's and 33's @ Grandma house and this is so familiar it just feels right. If you dont know what 45's & 33's are you missing out in real music. S&S yall killed this
Can't stop listening to this song. Favorite part has to be the second 2:14 "Oh now I try to be the life of the party" by Bruno
Tryna put on a smile 😭🔥🔥
Bruno Mars has a beautiful voice
Love it ❤️
Totally in love with the album and this song is just like a time machine taking us back to the golden era of music ❤️
This masterpiece puts tears of Joy  on my face
🎤🎸🎷🪘🥁🕺🏾💥💥💥💥💥💥always dope tunes 🙌🏾👏🏿😍🔥
I am fan
Love this when he smile in a high note
Me on the outside: 🙂👍🔥 Me on the inside: 🧠🫀🦴
Gotdamm! Before Silk Sonic came about I considered Bruno Mars an aight vocalist who sang radio songs. Silk Sonic done pulled the soul outa him!
Procurei a tradução dessa música hj!  Que perfeição😍
If this song not a mood than ion know what is😌
I really enjoyed this album especially this song and it makes hopefully that soul, funk, gospels, blues and r&b music will become popular again!
Ooooooooooooooooooooo ! 🥰
Lindo!😍
One of the greatest vocal performances of all time.
I love bruno's sad songs
Damn this song took me back to listening to old school music in the car with my dad
This song reminds me so much of Bruno Mars’ “If I Was Your Man”.
Best song in the album
I can Invision myself listening to this in 30 years
Great album.
Just phenomenal song..like every 1 fom BRUNO..and ANDERSON P...too🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Silk Sonic brought music back the way it use to be. That's music love it
they gone eat together every time
thank you for signing my autograph Bruno
Redefining every classic into a modernized masterpiece. Probably, a huge album despite what major awards ceremonies outcome will be.
Behind  the smile is heart of missing someone . A heart full of love .and hope and dreams ,
I feel back in the 70"s where music was MUSIC!!!! This whole Album Is EVERYTHING!!!!
It kinda started like james Brown's "it's man man's world"
This song is another level of an amazing composition..iv never thought i could be so emotional on a song in 2021. God bless you guys..!!!!!!
super great sound, the style is very engaging and really boils down to it
❤❤
🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿💯
Both Are Amazing 👑👑
Thank you guys for bringing back real R&B…this is what we need during these crazy times!
End of September till October was rough for me. To numerate:  1. Lost my grandmother, 79, after being nursed by his husband, 84, for 2 years straight on his own (with me ofc, but without my mom/their daughter and other sons). He had to figure out all on his own to make ends meet so that he could keep her alive for long.  2. Grandfather contracted COVID a week after her death, which became a lot worse considering he already had pneumonia prior. Won the battle against COVID but passed away just a week after / 30 days after her wife left us. He didn't have any time to mourn properly for lola's death.  3. I myself got the virus and got hospitalized -- wasn't even able to be there for him when he got rushed to the ER for the last time.  4. Uncle from the other side of my family passed away in his sleep.  5. Pet dog died. He was just 3 weeks old.  During all of these, I just let my emotions get pushed to one side by letting myself be occupied with things I find in the internet. I found their new album because of it in hopes that all the hype around their  music would help further in being distracted, but the lyricism here in this very song broke the chain deep down inside me. It perfectly narrated what I'm going through, what I wish I could do. I just miss them a lot, but all I can do is put on a smile. 😭😭  Now I have this on loop because that's all I can really do now -- to let all the emotions run rampant, in hopes that overtime all of these would make sense. I dont even know what I'm aiming for, I just want to be lonely for them.
I am soooo in love with the album. Definitely a fan of this Feel good Music :-)  #MusicisLife
The genius’s grow and grow!
This be puttin a smile on my face
the opening is from "it's a man's world"
In tears and on repeat instantly. I miss you 🌺Kairi🧡 #FuckCancer🖕🤬🖕
They are a real dynamic duo
요즘 이 노래만 반복해서 듣고있어요 너무 좋아...😭
🔥🎶 this the whole package album 🥰
Best Song on the Album..................Timeless work of art this. Where do Silk Sonic groupies sign up?
10 seconds jasmine Sullivan that's what this reminds me of and the beginning I bust the windows out your car
I let go of the ex who wanted me back because of this track.
My new favorite Bruno song
Love you ❤️💪
Does this song remind anyone else of Tracks Of My Tears by Smokey Robinson and The Miracles?
cant stop listening to this ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ bruno mars has done it again
If this song doesn’t become a single later, I’m gonna be so salty that anyone who comes within ten feet of me will get heart disease. 😤
Dem DRUMS tho!
I must be like .9 milli of these views by now. this is my sh!t
3:40 slk Brunão é hardcore
Brunooooooooo come on... I love this album... I hope they make another album too
The fact that David Ruffin isn't alive to cover this song is a fundamental and unforgivable glitch in the universe
Bruno Mars is a great artist, and a breathe of fresh air. I love his music
I love it!
This song makes me feel like a child. It reminds me of the music my parents and grandparents would play. Such as Earth Wind and Fire and the Temptations. Good stuff. Makes my heart smile to show music like this to my son he’s only 3 but he’ll know. 🖤
That was amazing....Bravo!
3:27, immediate smile
The only way this song gets better is if i can put a tape in a old stereo and hear it.  Like I need to hear that! Like if you put this song into 1973 it's on the billboard.
now i get to learn a color guard routine to this song :)))
Yaassss
In the beginning, it reminds me a little bit of the great Donny Hathaway and I love it
The best thing since Hall and Oates
A mais linda do álbum ❤
This is beyond art 🎨 ✨!!!!
The most beautiful album of 2021!
Amazing
If your eyes didn't at least get watery listening to this...you aint really listening..and aint been through anything.....this apply to lover.fam..daughter..step mom ..real mom..whoever
I dedicate this song to Bruno's mom RIP Bernadette -
My crush told me to listen to the new album of Bruno Mars, so here I am
Jesus this song right hear ain’t nothing but 🔥🔥🔥. And the unexpected modulation was the chef’s kiss. They need to make this a single
Need a music video for this 🤞🏻🙏🏻
This joint is on another level...
Thank God for this old school sound. Finally someone mainstream bringing it back. They are SO good.
Beatiful song

DOPE ASS SONG
♡♡♡
I am soooo disappointed with this album.  I thought it was going to be great.  It's not, it's freaking fantastical!!! OMG
🔥✨🔥✨🔥✨🔥✨🔥
This sure does put a smile on my face🥲
Best.
Andersons Voice is so soulful
love💕love💜💝
certified banger
I’ve suffered many adversities In  my life. I ALWAYS loved music. I’m grateful 🥲 to make it back to music to SMILE through many life   broken hearts. Ask and it shall be given unto you. For my birthday in February ( which hasn’t been celebrated in a long time) I would BEYOND love to go to one of Bruno’s and Anderson’s concert.  This bucket list dream seems unattainable. I call it my “LILAC LIST… love purple. Bruno…… Anderson…. Fan base managers….TREASURE “ME”…. My ringtone  I’m laughing but very serious. Thank you in advance 💜💫♍️✨✨✨✨✨🥲🙏😂🔥
This song goes straight to the heart!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
This is the best song in the album. God damn Bruno, a criminal. Also, the bongo was mwah, chef kiss. 🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
More one song? Bruno is on Fire!! 🔥🔥
Love
I don’t know how they decided to do an album together, but rarely do you come upon two voices that truly sounds MAGICAL together. It’s perfection. This song especially was a whole experience, you know the song is good when it takes you on a journey and you feel every emotion. Every part of this whole album is masterful.
This is the best song on the album. Think about that. Every song on this album is a banger. There are NO SKIPS. Even then, put on a smile is at the top
A MELHOR ❤️🥲
I *promise* this is the song I will sing with my whole chest at a Silk Sonic concert with tears (probably) streaming down my face. This is just beautiful.
Yesss!!! This is my favorite song on the album. This song speaks truths and we all have a situation where we have been the fool for someone!  I Luv this track, the album is dope, we NEEDED more though, but thank you Bruno & .Paak! 🎶🎙🥁🎹🎸📀
Love the old school soul vibes! Maybe a little bit of Hall and Oates in there too.
Blue Magic, Delfonics, Black Ivory, Whispers, Chi-Lites and soooo many more groups from the 70's. Thank you Anderson, Bruno and the crew.....BRINGING IT BACK BABY!!!
Another classic!!! YES LAWD!!!🔥💯
Motown would be proud...
MASTERPIECE!!! 🇬🇷
✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿❤🇧🇷 Charles wilsons vibe s
Such Sweet, Soulful Music, I love you guys Songs.
I relate so much godddddddd word for word
these drums are orgasmic
🔥🔥🔥
This that Saturday morning cleaning the house music
They sound like Angels on Earth ! Brilliantly blended together and created this Masterpiece 🥲💜🤍💜
Yeee
This is hands down my stand out track. We get Enchantment and Delfonics vibes here in spades. Most men can relate to being broken-hearted yet doing all they can to hide what is really going on inside. This track with its sad and somehow delightful chords pull on ones heartstrings as both Anderson.Paak and Bruno Mars croon in authentic vulnerable fashion. The production is layered and voluminous. You can tell a lot of time and effort went into the creation of this masterpiece. Songwriter extraordinaire Babyface is listed as one of the background vocalist, and my ears can't argue with that. This track builds like a hurricane gaining strength in the Gulf of Mexico. AP gives us an incredible raspy Sugerfoot (Ohio Players) type vibe here, and BM is again stellar crooning powerful high notes like Bobby De'Barge (Switch) in some instances here. Musically this is an extraordinarily soul touching song. The drum work by AP toward the latter part of this song is bananas. This is no doubt my favorite on the album - just remarkable attention to detail production-wise.
best song on the album.
Muito sentimento p uma só música kkkk e uma obra d arte 🤩🤩🤩🤩

This sounds similar to Lenny Williams. Yes or Nah?
nah not lying , this is so good !! 😭 it's so relaxing
Am I the only one who who kinda wants the only music these 2 put out be together or none at all?
EPIC
This is the standout track of the album.  Needless to say, this album is absolutely incredible.
Listening to this really made my day better
1:45 = full body chills😩
Wow
Omg!! This whole album is a masterpiece thanks silk sonic for bringing back to life this kind of music for how many decades sure win for grammy!!😍😍😍❤
Mars and Paak together was a dream I've never wished for. Whoever did THHAAAAANNNK YOUUUU!

Lo mejor del disco! 🙌🙌🙌
Come Through with The Real Music🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾Grown & Sexyyyyy Music🔥🔥🔥
THANK YOU!!!!! FOR BRINGING REAL R&B MUSIC BACK!!! MAYBE NOW THESE MILLENNIALS CAN LISTEN WITH THEIR HEARTS 💕  💘 ❤
I dont know if its deliberate but can anyone else hear at 1:06 the same notes used in "Diamonds and Pearls" by Prince? I mean both of them adore Prince so could make sense...and if so sweet mama was it a beautiful detail
You know they are absolute ridiculous together when their best song wasn’t even released as a single before this album came out
LOVE THAT BUILD UP IN MUSIC NEAR THE END👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🥁 murdering the DRUMS. Beeeeautilful Song !Loving Bruno vocals as usual
Take us Back, it feels sooo Good, this album is worth buying, and I haven't bought an album in god knows when, but I am buying this.one THANKS GUYS I am very excited!!!
✨✨✨✨🤍
Did he get rid of the hooligans band?
My gosh. The drums on this make me feel thangs. Anderson is killing it on the drums fr. And his rasp on the song. And Bruno with these high notes. The production on this song, this whole album is immaculate.
WE NEED VIDEOCLIP THIS!!!!!! 🇧🇷come to Brazil pleaseeeeee 🇧🇷
What a dream team - love love love this song so much..
Kaatil hai Tu Bruno 😍😍♥️♥️♥️
WONDERFUL SONG
Bruno please make this your next single. Men Anderson paak's voice is crazy emotional and silk. Thank God he did this album with Bruno cause he made it better and he will get more recognition. This is arguably the best song on the album.#SILKSONIC
This duo is on fire, they get me in the mood
Bruno has done it AGAIN!!! Another hit!!!!! LOOOOOOVE IT, YESSSSSS!!!!😜💋🌹💖💝
Goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥
3:26 HOLY
Anderson Paak's first verse is my fav out of all the songs and the way Bruno murdered this track with those vocals😍😍😍 AAAAHHH I LOVE THIS SO MUCH.
Love this song, Bruno is great! and ANDY has that "ol' classic" soul rockin in this song, reminds me of Bobby Womack - Great Job fellas!

My personal favorite from this album soooo gooood!!!😘🥰🤩
This whole album makes me want to buy turntable and a vinyl record of silk sonic.
1:33-1:46 when Bruno hit that “YOU” on the last key change it reminded me of when Emanuel "EJ" Johnson from the group “Enchantment” hit the same note on the song “Sunshine” IYKYK
https://youtu.be/7Fy61_ONRrM
Complete brilliance The vocals are spot on Modern classic
✨🍯
Kesini setelah 3 hari dirilis
CHILLS ALL OVER, SO HAPPY THESE AMAZING ARTISTS BROUGHT BACK OLD SCHOOL R&B …..ABSOLUTELY LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS GROUP. 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Omg! everything about this is beautiful!
this song so soooo soulful. it really hit you right to your being whew.. the delivery is superb. when bruno hits that fucking notes- im really in heaven. if calling all my lovelies  live in apollo is my fave because of how he flawlessly and powerfully delivered that high note especially the "pleasssssssssee" part- this one right here exceeded it..Looking forward to see this song live. I know he will be sanging his ass off😭😭. As for Andy- loved him too. He also push and challenge himself in this album. Im happy Bruno find a friend like him.
06 Put On a Smile  Produced by Bruno Mars and D’Mile Written by Bruno Mars, Brandon Anderson, Kenny “Babyface” Edmond, Dernst Emile II. Youtubers and fans. Leaving out Grammy and Oscar winner, producer D’MILE/Dernst Emile II ❤️out of the comments and credits is pure sacrilege!!! 😕 😕  Proud Mom.
I already said it is gorgeous the first time I heard it. Still doing it. There are not enough superlatives out there to heap praise on this song. The push for these artists to go further than their own perceived limits proved their drive to create perfection ! This is a masterclass in artistry…..VIRTUOSITY. The mastery of Bruno of his vocal instrument and Anderson’s of the drums for me is what made this track the best (of the best !) in this album. It is successfully evocative of the feeling it is trying to convey - the rain, the thunder. And the drums ….created the tension, the drama, the passion and the heartbreak! What an immersive interpretation of a banger of a song !
I love the whole album, but this is my favorite. Shout out to Silk sonic for inbracing real authentic music. Omg love the live instruments. Love love loves 💘💗
My favourite song from this album
When this song started, my lights flickered. This is some powerful stuff
Damn, 3:26 gives me goosebumps.
❤❤❤❤❤
.HIU.
Already told my family. I don't care when how I need to c them. I'm 54 this music is like back in the day for me. Got me feeling 🥰 👏🏾
This is what's missing from today's music. Some actual soul. I'm not just talking bout soul music. I mean music where you could feel it.
Just now I know that drums can also hit runs and riffs. WTF

The Dramatics "in the rain" influence is heavy on this one bruno and anderson did they thing on this one four thumbs up
Favorite song on the album
Wow, while listening to "Put On A Smile", a ton of memories flooded my thoughts. Thank you for releasing your talent and thanks to Babyface, for pushing you. This track is a treasure to all of us that's been in love and messed it up.🥰🤗💞
2:59-4:03 THIS PART!!!! 😱 Just snatch my soul out my body and catapulted it into the stars.☄️
Not even on some dramatic shit but this song has almost brought me to tears multiple times lmao. That’s what soul music does, it hits you.
made me forget i was having problems with my dad leaving me
My GODDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!
Damn Bruno!! How'd you hit that note at 3:27....then the falsetto!!!!!???? #legend 🔥 can't wait to see you in Vegas!!!
Awhhhhh this is eargasmmm 🥴🥴🥴
This most definitely should be the next single!!
I’m on a high I don’t want to come down from!!! This album is my new drug! DEFINITELY WORTH THE WAIT
Welcome back soul music...I've missed you so much.
Nobody does it better than Mr. Mars..literally nobody! ♥️
My favorite in the album! The emotions in this song is 🤌
This is the music we need, want and desire!!!!!!
3:25 ur welcome
DAMNNNNNMMM!
Bruno mars is the best male vocalist today Ima stand on that‼️
the intro sample.. what is that?
This song is so cold blooded, it touch your soul!
This song deadass got me close to crying over relationships that I been over for a minute 😭💀
Perfeição essa música! 😍😍
THE BEST SONG EVER!!!!!!!!!!! <3
A Masterpiece  ❣❣❣  The ache, tears, therapy...masterfully done 💔💋💯
I swear Bruno Mars joining a group with vibes and vocals like this was the best thing he ever did! 🙌🏼 his music is a thousand times better and his voice 😍😍
Ala Madre...santo cielo que genios Los mejores sin duda....los dos hacen Bommmm😍🔥🛐
This reminds me of my uncle sitting on the couch chilling with a drink watching t.v. with that silk shirt he use to wear..playa vibes
Shits too addicting holy. Bruno and Anderson killed their parts!
@3:29!!!!!❤️❤️❤️
This song is answer to smoking out the window
Bruno❤❤❤
About time we had a motherfucking blast from the past  freshfeels 90s baby but we taking back thru 3 centuries 70s80s90s are back eyes 👀
They need to release an extended version of this song as a SIngle!!!! Pure Fire
Superb vocals 😍💕
Great song
Pelo amor de deus o clipe dessa música!
Bruno brincou de cantar , que música é essa!!!!
If you like the rawness and subject matter of this, also listen to "Too Good to Say Goodbye"!!
What more do you want.It's a classic, it's hit,it's everything.All in 1!
Best song on the album
I’m getting temptations vibes
Next hit
Amazing voice and Really high quality beat 🤩🌋🌋🔥
Wow! That touch of Baby Face...really amazing. Bravo!
Music with deep meanings.  Beautiful lyrics and vocals.  Time to think on past decisions.  Beautiful.
Best song on the album
Andy's drum roll is for a billion dollar lottery. Boy, did Bruno hit that jackpot! "2:48"
2:54 build up into the surprise major drop instead of a minor one as previously is chilling.
🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵
Dang Again.
I know it's not your first time here, go ahead take a seat.
The fact that people disliked the video
Absolutely timeless...
This one sounds like the lost brother of Leave The Door Open
The astounding quality of this album makes me wonder how good music can really get because right now this is the best
The 285 thumbs down? Nothing running through those veins!
Album is great but this is one the greatest songs I’ve ever heard.
love the soul elements in this
Everyone talking about bruno. But anderson paak did an amazing job too
Fire 4 da ol school and new listen
SO DOPE
WHERE IS THE OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️ OMG! I couldn’t  stop listening or watching to Leave The Door Open  and Smokin’ Out The Window!!! Now this song is another one on ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
This album bro😭🔥🔥🔥
MOTOWN is  back and i like it
. Linda música
Yes 👏🏽
Anderson great vocals but they don’t hold a candle to his artistry behind the drums in this song. His drum fills as Bruno s vocals modulate before they soar wouldn’t have been as dramatic
MDS a voz desses dois cara!!
my favorite song from the album !
This will become an iconic album. Not because it is a first class authentic Soul record but because it is a first class authentic Soul record released in 2021! So glad that one of my favorite artists, Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds, contributed to this song.
Lyrics inspired by Smokey Robinson “Tears of a Clown” and I’m here for it.
This is the most underrated song on this album of magic.
My favorite ♥️ Guys, you killed it! Congrats!!!! Venham para o Brasil o mais depressa possível, na moraaaaaal! 🇧🇷
Marvin Gaye vides!!🎵🎶🎙
I really want a clip for this song, please🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Love this album!!! 👌❤
Bruno mars my idol proud pinoy🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
It is perfect!
Linda!!!! Queria ser a mocinha do clip kkkk
3:29
3:28
I have no words...
Make me wanna call the ex I never had 😂
Can’t stop coming back to this banger
This melody sounds like Babyface to me for some reason.
This album is a punch in the face for those always say, old music is better than new one.  What are we going to argue now?
Tanto que le pedían música escuchenlooooo , tiene que llegar a más vistas 👍,  I love it Bruno Mars 🥺❣️🇵🇪
i think this song made me realize that i still miss her
They frl did they thang on this song 👌🏽❤️
I don't know what is happening to me but I find that funk and R&B have been moving in to my ,wow I love that sound - song,  I grew up on 80s rock however this is absolutely amazing!!
Até que enfim uma sofrência!!!
Love from INDIA
Heart breaking...😪
Used to be a fan, but now I'm a whole wind power station
Masterpiece
Now this is funk
My favorite song on the album. Gives me goosebumps and stops my heart. I suddenly go back to that feeling of when I had to put on a smile. You and Andy sang ya'll asses off!
Llorando ;-;
Anderson’s voice just melted my heart.
Beautiful!
Wow..I. loving this new Bruno Mars song...it has that 1970,s feeling, vibe...yes I love it❤❤❤❤

All the frowners disliked this song
Mezanmi 😍
I love the direction Bruno is going on his new album. Bringing back those sweet R&B Motown soul sounds of yesteryears. Maybe this will become the new trend instead of all the shit I hear on commercial radio nowadays
Desde Rosario, Argentina. Genial !!!

This is my favorite song off the album, we can all relate.
Best Song On The Album This Song Is Absolutely Amazing :)

QUE HINO É ESSE, MEU PAAAAAAAAAAAAI??????????????????? LENDÁRIOOOOOOOOOOS!
Who wants to just hold onto to your lover and make good? Forget everything and just.........
My gosh, this definitely brought my a smile (and eargasm)
WHY AM I ON THE FLOOR RIGHT NOW!!!
The way the last chord leave you hangin
Maravilloso, como todo lo tuyo ❤️
I love that the song changes from minor to major near the end, then changes back to minor.
2:49 - 3:03 Edging > 3:04     Cumming
Some vibe in the intro apart from jb, reminded me of te dramatics 'it ain't raining on nobody s house'
3:25
yo i’m gonna have to make a drum cover of this it’s just amazing the whole album is incredible
Wow! 👏👏♥️
Another masterpiece
These 2 are way too smooooth
How can you be this fucking good...
All I wanna see is Silk Sonic and Summer Walker on the r&b charts and streaming.  Summer started it now SS keep it going.  Bring back R& B please. THESE Gen Zs will never know real music if u don't!
My favorite music in this album! It's insane how they makes this. It's a masterpiece my friends...
🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥this 🎶 song is an instant classic 🙏❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
You better sang peak!!! Song 🎵 🎶 of the year.
😊😊vocals eish
Bruno’s vocals are crazy.  He is singing high then takes it up again amazing.  Andy killing those drums.  Background vocals on point.   Wow ole school vibes in the house.  Y’all did dis album and  wasn’t playin.
This that “ 60+ hours work week , Bills paid, Children in the backyard , Wife preparing the sides while you finish up your beer before you take the meat off the grill “ type music & I’m here for it ❤️
BEST SONG!!!! Unbelievable!
I'M MORE THAN MUSIC
HOLD MY HAND /HOLD MY HEART/ I FALL THROUGH YOUR FINGERS LIKE SAND/ I'M BLACK FALLIN /APART/ HOW DO I LOVE YOU/ KEEP IT SACRED🤩
Best bridge/outro in a song ever. Gosh! "2:40"
I really hope future artist's are taking notes from this Duo
Loveeeee this 😍
So far my Aoty sorry Donda :(
Bruno you gotta live forever ..
DEFINITELY A SINGLE...THIS IS THE SONG OF THE YEAR.
Put some RESPECT on Anderson.PAAK’s Vocals as well!! You can Feel the Pain in both of there voice…
Bruno❤❤❤❤
So they went from telling the girl they’d “Leave The Door Open” for her, to taking her on a “Skate” date. After some time they were “Smokin Out The Window” of their car after a breakup, which led to sending her ‘back to the city’. Now they’re trying to “Put On A Smile” while trying not to cry from dealing with the breakup. Their entire album seems to be a story from start to finish, and I’m here for it.
beautiful. just beautiful
I need a live version of this song!
Silk sonic thank yall for some real music 🎶 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 I  love this wave
the high note of bruno mars you can still stick your ear to the speaker 💯❤️
Escolhi te amar pra sempre ❤️🍃
perfection
is bruno mars, anderson .paak, and d'mile the new earth wind and fire?
805 sending Love to Anderson
It’s Grenade on crack

Bruno meu amor tô viciada na Put On A Smile q música obgda meu sol ❤❤❤
I like it because it more like the old school flavor
Dang.
Favorite song out the album
Que album Maravilhoso❤😍
Me apaixonei❤
OMG!! amazing music~
Is it bad that i want to chop this shit up and make a fire boom bap beat
I Wanna Go Outside In The Rain- The Dramatics !!😊
Nah there will be no brushing over the last minute of this song tolerated. Some of the best musical moments of the year on that last chorus and the hang on “dying”.
Timeless... All that other shit here today and gone tomorro....
Bruno just chested high C on "Smile" 3:16 is one of the purest notes I've heard in a long time
I NEED this on vinyl!! To spin on my Stack-O-Matic 😁
THE BEST ON THE ALBUM💥
The Hall and Oates is just exuding from this
This is my favorite ! It is closest to the 70's sound that I liked and Bruno and  Anderson put the magic in it!
aww i cry 😥❤️
The best song on the whole album. Do you know how hard it is to keep a happy face? Do you know how hard it is to not feel melancholic over the tragedies of this world? And do you know how hard it is to hide my feelings from the girls I love so intimately? I want to express my feelings, but I have to Put On A Smile. Tryna fight these tears from crying, but Lord knows I'm dying.
🥰😍😘🥰😍🥰😘🥰😍
This creation is a meeting of the minds! So proud of your talent!
WHEN. DOES. THIS. ALBUM. DROP???
Me encanta
essas vozes são lindas amoooo  Bruno mars Anderson paak
You YES you wore boring for this Bruno YOU have me speechless however that doesn't amaze me for I knew when I heard YOUR voice in 2008 bottom line YOU YES YOU would be amazing
Whenever I hear Bruno wail that "you" on the key change my pores raise and I feel like crying! Contemporary music hasn't done that to me in ages. I'll never stop thanking these brothers for this incredible musical gift...this love letter to humanity as we emerge from another period of darkness.
Damn those high notes from Bruno is higher than my salary hahahaha 😅🤣. May  I ask those who have perfect pitch here if what note did Bruno hit on 3:26 time?  Thanks
O hell yes
Anderson's opening, and Bruno's close were masterful. Simply brilliant!
Well done gentlemen and all involved.  The album is drenched in old school funk with modern day swag.  This is the one that hits you in the feels though.  🤗💜✊🏽
Now I must buy the entire thing and I havent bought music since 2013
This here I'm absolutely loving the vibe
got bad news about my grandma today then youtube recommends this song? bruno and paak got my back! great song! just when i needed it
Glad I got to hear a bit of the original Bruno in this
Holy shit
I'll live in this song..<3
I feel like more people need to put respect on Anderson Paak's name. This album wouldn't be what it is without him.
SOOOO GOOOOOOD
Ya5i 9nakum swatkum 7a9i9iyin✨✨
To me, this song is the best of this album, an instant classic, great production and such a well balanced and blended soul ballad by two of great artists. I would love to this one live at some point.
Time to Win https://youtu.be/Ebl6_MRJeTQ
This been me for like a year and a half now
Damn! Maximum ear candy.
Just listened to this entire album and YALL BE TOO CLEAN 🔥🔥🔥 Every song is incredible, thanks for crafting this beauty 💖✊🏿
Fuuuuuck! this song is so damn good! and bruno's vocals are insane in this song.
🔥🔥🔥💽🇬🇹👌🏻
I swear these guys are bringing back memories of me growing up in the seventies listening to the QUIET STORM on my local radio station where I grew up! Bravo Silk Sonic👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿.
They need to make another CARWASH movie remake and put the Silk Sonic as the whole soundtrack  You youngsters probably have no ideal what I'm talking about😆😆😆
Yal  outdone yourselves ❤JUST WOW 👏
danm, this album is pure soul
My favorite in the album, beautiful, emotional and full of talented lyrics. Anderson Paak is a fucking superstar now and Bruno is getting another Grammy
duck Yawl Grammy incoming!
“You put the clothes on my back”
This song is a mood
Perfeito
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE, I JUST CAME!
Que presentão ,lançou a música no dia do meu aniversário 12/11 te amooooooo Bruno Mars 🥰
holy shit this song is on another level
¡Me encanta esa combinación de voces y sentir que siempre Brunito me sorprende con su calidaaaad!
I’m still trying to put 2 and 2 together on how this just basically took me to space bass already!!!!  Yeah This Album Of The Year, And This Song WTH Jack? Perfect 💯🙏🏾🙌🏿❤️🔥
Not even joking or bias but this might be the best song I have ever heard in the last 5 years
Best track on the album.  Amazing vocals by Andy and Bruno.  Andy going nuts on the snares.
This may be the next single, it's giving me hit vibes
The best song in an album full of outstanding songs
The drummer was going crazy on this one 😱😍
A maior
My first tatoooo dedicated to you Bruno Mars
OHH MYY GOOOD
My love Bruno put smile on me my heart still smiling i love you my Bruno
The grammy's have been reserved. Every got damn category!
Amazing work
True artists, this is why I love music.

Anybody hear the reference to Robby Orbison's "Crying" @3:25?
Love it.
ANOTHER HIT! This Album is KILLING ME! SILK SONIC you've done it. Every release is So Tight and What my Heart and Ears Love! 💜 Real Musicianship in or out of the studio!  THANK YOU!
It's crazy to know that the legendary producer Babyface had a hand in this song.
Nota 1000.
Yall don't forget about Anderson Paak
The testimony of a man's regret. Like "When I Was Your Man"  R/B style on another level. 🤯This song makes me cry. 😭😭😭😭😭 So beautiful
I love Bruno’s falsetto on any track but Paak’s voice is so raspy and sexy at the same time. His vocals are shining on this song. OMG, it’s fire!!! I love Silk Sonic.
Got damn this good music
No words. Beyond fenomenal. Another leave the door open. The Michael Jackson of this era. Thia guys are on another fucking level.
Of course Babyface laid hands (and vocals) on this track. My God…😌🙌🏾  *continues to listen song and make the stank face of approval*
Any question or debate on Album of the Year at this point?
So many births coming.
This song takes my breath away. When Bruno hit that high note, something goes through my body. I love , love the album. Best music by two of the most talented and gifted men...... Bruno/Anderson!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Awe so good....

I'll go back in this comment 10 years from now. This will surely put a smile on my face by that time.
bruno mars ,this man actually makes good music unlike many artist out there that are just releasing trash. 2020 was saved by the weeknd and 2021 by bruno and anderson 👌

Bruno is the only one who could sing that high note towards the end!

Lately I've been simping for this song🤞🏽😌

"This does put a smile on my face"
Straight up quiet storm music here....

Classic vibes?
I literally got chills listening to this song!
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
I love this song !😁👍
This sound takes me back to The Stylistic and The Chi-lites
This joint is AWESUUUUUUM!!!
No quiero llorar pero que hermosa canción
My Ears have been in Eargasm mood. So beautiful Simply one of the best songs in the past 30 years
If Bruno was relevant in the 60s, he should have made a duet with Aretha Franklin
I Can Pretend When I'm Out With My Friends I Ain't Thinking About You I Can Pretend Like I Ain't In My Feelings But That Ain't True, Nah (Nah) When I Called You Out Your Name That Was My Ego, My Plan And Pain I Should Be A Movie Star The Way I Play The Part Like Everything's Okay  Oh!

Perfection. Anderson starts it off with sad morose vocals. Bruno follows it up with the passionate desperation. Together it's a one two knockout.

💖💖💖
Silk sonic was the worst thing that has happened to Bruno.
Yep,this is the one ..i said what I said
Grandma approved, loving it!!!!!
I love the tracks!!! Puts me right back in the 70's. Thank you Bruno!
Anderson hits the soul 😭
Over One Million Signatures Against Forced Organ Harvesting Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH) started a global petition in 2013 to oppose the forced organ harvesting in China. Within 5 months, over 1.5 million signatures were collected in more than 50 nations. They were submitted to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), urging immediate action to stop the forced organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners in China.   In an announcement on June 14, the United Nations Human Rights Council stated that the accusations against the CCP for harvesting organs from detained Falun Gong practitioners, Uyghurs, Tibetans, Muslims, and Christians are shocking.
Bruno is giving life to people with broken spirits. It's not just songs. It's life giving therapy for the soul.
I had to remind myself to breathe....both lyrically and musically, you get so caught up in EVERYTHING : the pain and frustration, then joy and elation, only to be back in the alley gutter dejected in sorrow.    That drum rip into Bruno's balladeering though!  I gotta say, it is a pleasure to be musically tortured the way Silk Sonic does so;  the arrangements, compositions, song writing, phrasing, (and of course dancing) is incomparable and out of this world!    What I appreciate most is that they are raising the bar to how we think of albums,  that they are an audible storyboard for artists.  Instant gratification keeps us feeding on single track soundbites rather than trying to digest a whole audio voyage like these cats are taking us on.  I like that they are challenging other artists to approach their music in that fashion.    Other artists like Mayer Hawthorne and Tuxedo have been diving into the Motown/RnB revitalization for several years now and Silk Sonic is giving their rendition and giving song writing/composition new meaning.  Much Mahalo to Anderson and Bruno for the gift of their musical aloha;  I don't think I can do enough to deserve their musicianship.... (cue riotous standing ovation)
Bruno is giving off a Bobby DeBarge vibe. I ❤ it!
❤️❤️❤️
Your amazing sound come back again
Cant wait for anderson to play drums while singing these notes, so much talent in one album, just wow
best song on the album and that was a very hard choice but it is what it is. fight me!

Love u Bruno <3

"If you know, you know!".............. Everyone on here knows. Facts

Good Music is still alive

PERO QUE CANCION TAN MAS HERMOSA POR DIOS AAAAHHHHHH
It hits different considering all the shit that's been happening lately in my life. Wow.
This song deserves to be released as a single ASAP. Bruno Mars’ massive vocal range is insane.
😭😭😭😭😭

This is the song you listen to on a very breezy day as you drive your open-roofed convertible along the path in a cornfield with your lover by your side.
Great driving music🔥🔥
this is my number 1 favorite!!! my number 2 is 777
I'm smiling
Bruno Mars is the most skilled artist of all times. If you will deny that, please think twice...
Muita bom ❤️
Again? They are killing our hearts. Only music connoisseurs can predict this. I never thought this type of emotionally charged music could be created in this season. Coup de Chapeau guys. Silk Sonic, Anderson, Bruno, you did it.
I’m definitely put on a smile after that!!! YOU RULE IT
Woohoo! Wow it is faultless early seventies. Bruce Lee with an afro and platform shoes. Bruno and Anderson are gods. Such a cool break from today's drums that sound like someone striking matches. For goodness sake light that cigarette using a lighter.
In the words of Ron Burgundy.... "This is baby makin music right here"  Absolutely flawless.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍
This song and “Love Me” by Lukaz are some of the only two things getting me through hard times, thank god for music! I love you! 💛
My God. I got goosebumps all over this song. In that beautiful moment he extended his voice in a divine way. Bruno's voice is so heavenly. Paak then .... Come to Brazil please. Here in Rio at least.
This song is so.... Beautiful.
Algum BR também leu PUTONA??? AUHAUAHAUSYSY
increible la voz de bruno en esta cancion, demostrando lo unico que es <3
Bruno mars vocals are amazing
THIS 71 YEAR OLD LOVES THIS BEAUTIFUL SONG!!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

❗The word Islam means peace and submission. Muslims greet each other by saying 'Salaam alaykum' meaning 'peace be upon you'. , the majority of Muslims believe in seeking a just and peaceful world. The Qur'an teaches that Allah wants Muslims to control their aggression and approach others with peace.  {Do not let your hatred of people incite you to aggression}.ref/Qur’an 5:3)  The Qur'an For Muslims the Qur'an is of supreme importance because it is the direct words of Allah to humankind, and it is therefore treated with great respect. The Qur'an often refers to teachings about peace and reconciliation:  {Paradise is for…those who curb their anger and forgive their fellow men.}Ref/Qur'an 3:134     --------------------------------------------------------- {Do not kill a soul which Allah has made sacred except through due process of law.} ref/Qur'an 6:51    This quote suggests that Muslims should only kill if it can be justified under Islamic law because human life is precious and belongs to Allah.  Killing of any other kind is one of the greatest sins in Islam. These sins will be judged by Allah on the Day of Judgement.  Hadith In the Hadith the Prophet Muhammad teaches that maintaining peace and good relations is very important and that Muslims should not get carried away with feelings of hatred towards others:  {Do you know what is better than charity and fasting and prayer? It is keeping peace and good relations between people, as quarrels and bad feelings destroy mankind.}ref/Hadith  //// Peace and equality Islam seeks peace and harmony within a community, the ummah and also between countries. Islam teaches that reconciliation is of great importance.  Peace is central to Islam and the religion aims to achieve a world without attack, conflict or unjust rulers. A peaceful solution to any situation of conflict must be sought and if an enemy offers peace Muslims should accept it. The Qur'an reminds Muslims that Allah is always watching and taking account of their actions. This belief is clearly expressed in the following verse:  {If the enemy inclines towards peace, then you should also incline towards peace and trust in Allah, for He is the One that hears and knows all.} ref/Qur'an 8:61  Islam teaches that prejudice and discrimination of any kind are wrong, because we are all creations of Allah and are therefore equal.  Some Muslims refuse to fight in contemporary wars because they believe that with modern warfare there can be no such thing as a just war. Air strikes often accidently kill innocent civilians, and chemical and nuclear weapons have the capacity to cause mass destruction to humanity and the environment.   {Whoever saved a life; it would be as if he saved the life of all mankind.} Ref/Qur'an 5:32 __________________________________  How can I enter Islam?  easy to enter Islam  just Say from heart♥️ I bear witness that there is no god but Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of God. congratulations you are a Muslim now 💞 .........  Are you  if you converted to Islam?  You can convert to Islam without telling anyone.Because God Allah knows what in your heart. Anytime you want to enter the Islamic religion, just say this sentence from your heart   ........

Great music as always.  Great R and B bring it back.  Need to hear music that fills  your ❤️.

So glad that Paak got this track to really show off his vocal chops, I feel like Bruno always gets all the credit in that department but Anderson’s really grown as a singer just from this album alone
Buena música, mi gran respeto!
Que belleza ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ valió la espera
i miss old bruno mars😭
yo bro
Spotify?
My face is cramping due to the continuous stank face I have for every song on this album.
Produced by Babyface!
Não entendi nada, mas tá lindo
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
New favorite song check ✔️
So damn goooodddd
This might be a concert I would pay money to see.
Its not a song I've heard so far that I didn't like I can play the whole album and that's rare for me it's only a few of the new artist that I can play and listen to the full album and thus is one.
The start reminds me of Michael Jackson, Ain't no sunshine, great song and album, Bruno is bringing back the 70s.
I don't like swearing, but holy fuck, can these guys do anything wrong. Sorry for the swearing. I grew up with soul in the 60s/70s, this is easily up there.  I bloody love it, thanks BR and AP
Love it!!
Eles têm música pra tds momentos,música pra sofrer com um desespero, música pra sorrir como doido e pra dançar como se soubéssemos mesmo😂😂.Eu só amo e aplaudo esse talento todo👏👏💃😭😂(meus emoji escutando eles)
just perfect
🥰🥰🥰🥰
Wow… just wow.
IM DYING TO PUT ON A SMILEE ON THIS SONG
Wow I just love the way the song carefully alternates  back and forth between progression and patters from these modern era and the 70's. Wow these guys are musical geniuses. This is no doubt the best album of the year and possibly the entire decade. Damn. Awesome
🖤🤍🖤🤍
When i picture the smiles they'll put on their faces when they'll do a live version, i just put on an intending smile😊😊
Can’t wait for the video for put on a smile
This is the one. I was waiting for that pure Motown vibe and this songs delivers the goods. I was waiting for Bruno's vocal to take over and this song does it for me. Paak compliments him so well. Pure and raw emotion from both Bruno and Paak. This album needed this song. The hit it out the park!
Wow! Intro of its  man's man's world James brown!
Put
The best album of the year 💯🔥
Can't believe this group.  The best of the best!
❤️❤️✨🔥
Bruno Mars have a amazing voice.
❤️❤️❤️
I  love this album
1 Million Views Ganggg !!!!! 😎
LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!
Two insanely talented men in one album, Daaayum!
Thanks guys for this album. You two are what we never knew we needed. We have been through some difficult times  and for you to use your quarantine time to give us this healing masterpiece is the most generous gift you could give us. I love this album, but 777, fly as me, about last night and put on a smile hits me right. Bruno's vocals on put on a smile got me very emotional and in tears 😢 Of course the first three singles are a-given. I like how you hit us with a slow tempo then up tempo. The arrangements and instrumentation very ambitious. Anderson shredding drum beats and soulful voice and Bruno's solo guitar and earwig vocals.. oh God, nirvana. Guys, your God-given talents are for healing the soul and we are better for it. I can't wait to see how you perform these songs live.. as this is Bruno's specialty. Well done gentlemen. May you continue to be blessed.  👏👏👏😘
candu banget lagunya
Make me feel like a granddad telling his grandson, "what you know about that?"
Hi
Omg Guys This Song I Love it Sooooo Much!! You Are Pure Gold!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is a masterpiece!
Just the intro to put on a smile makes me know it’s a hit !!!!

Perfect. Keep do it.
Guys, just love this song! 🔥🔥🔥 Hearing this song makes me want to smile back...😊

This album is GOLD!! Love the harmony, pure gold.
Wow, I love this one. You guys have done it again.

Big Bruno Fan, but same style through out the whole album...
This is still a good song. But it doesn't deserve to be single and music video for Silk Sonic.
❤❤❤
R Kelly would sound good on this
Respect 🙏
Perfect combination of Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak and Silk Sonic! Such beautiful soulful mellow touch!!!!!!
Bruno mars sempre arrasando nas música

I had to come back and listen to this one single right here. This single right here is Beautiful. 😪 ❤🎼🎤
A música é tão boa para os meus ouvidos que não paro de escutar isso desde às primeiras horas,os que colocaram dislike são meus vizinhos, estão irritados porque desde estou a repetir essa música.
Due voci un solo ❤spettacolari come non mai, bravi Bruno Mars e Anderson Paak. 💕😘😘😘😘😘
This is perfection. I think little simz might have been dethroned from album of the year !!
VOCALSSSSSS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
QUE ALBUM DEL BIEN LOCO LOS CAGO AMANDO

❤❤😘
This is a good song. But it's pretty clear that this is the weakest one on the album. Still a good song.
Bruno is giving life to people with broken spirits. It's not just songs. It's life giving therapy for the soul.

Speechless! So smooth...so old school but contemporary at the same time. Fantastic!
❤❤❤💯
Crack been sprinkled all over this
And the hits Keep coming
I love the attention paak is getting from this project man. The two get the best out of eachother

These guys are a breathe of fresh air...if their music doesn't move you, you're already dead !!...

I can't help but wonder how Bootsy Collins' voice is so relaxing.

Remember God loves you😊 John 3:16  For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. Please turn your life around and repent before its too late♥️🙏

Who teared up a bit?
Just a CLASSIC.
niente Bruno Mars si riconferma un enorme talento
Masterpiece!
This song 🎵 needs its own video. So freaking good!
I love all the songs, but this one's my favorite. And it's funny how it comes after Smokin Out the Window in the album, like he's regretting returning 'this bitch!' to the streets... lol
What a cool song! You're a genius!
Damn, I love Silk Sonic.  Bruno as a vocalist is amazing and Anderson Paak brings so much to the table.
My Mommy used to say "you've been here before or you have an old soul"...Yes indeed.
*I am a beginner Youtuber who is not yet on the salary,still trying despite stress,still expecting even though he was scorned🔥,still posting even though those who watched a little😭,For you my child❤️.,,.....*

My favorite álbum. Come on Brasil, please
Silk Sonic=Iconic, memorable and timeless!
Beautiful song and such a good performance this fan is so proud ❤

MY NEW ADDICTIVE!!!!
Hey they gotta do a collabo with Smokey Robinson and other R and B legends.
this is sex music
They are making An instant classic! Enough said! Gotta pick this up
Bruno draws great ideas for his musical works, from the depths of his mind and soul, and above all, from deep love, for the woman of his heart, she is his inspiration and muse, Bruno has long been sighing to the woman of his heart, because it is her she gave him a deep affection and a thankful heart for his wonderful love.
Melhor voz da atualidade!
🔥🔥
Love this new album
The new oldies but goodies.
Did Anderson Paak just say, "If I could turn back the hands of my Rollie"? I'm using that from now on! 😂😂🔥
Honestly feels Like Bruno And Anderson of incapable of not making bangers.

Lyrics video OUT NOW!!! on my profile
I JUST WANNA SAY THANK U FOR THIS 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Some years ago Bruno Mars was compared to Michael Jackson or Prince but now we have to know that he is one of the best singer in the hystory of music. He is a singer, songwriter, dancer and everything he does, he does it with immense talent. He is a living legend! In the future a talented singer will be compared to Bruno Mars but the truth is that there is only one Bruno. He is one of the most awarded singers in history and everything he has achieved has deserved it. Long life to music! Long life to BRUNO MARS!❤️✨❤️✨
MY HEART IS OFFICIALLY COMFORTED FOR THE HOLIDAYS
Anderson Paak!  Killing it on the drums!
Oh my gawd this is breath taking
Bruno Mars never fail to impress. Bruno reads my mind. Each and every sentences represent how i feeling right now. We may have thousand of reason that make us to have a fake smile, and act strong in front of other but there is only one  girl that can really make me to have an unforgettable smile. Unfortunately life is not perfect, Most of the time we don't get what we want but still hope she is having a good life and care about her which is the only one.
Amazing talent song after song. How do they do it??? Real music to my ears. Thank you Bruno & Anderson for putting a smile on my face while listening to your songs.
This generation doesn't deserve these songs created by these amazing-musical genius guys. This generation don't know that these songs are what truly define good and real music 🤎 They are after with the meaningless and demonic music like Travis's asshole Scott more 🤮
Foyaaa🔥🔥
Man, y'all are taking me back for real! I would be at a house party, the red light would be on, and it was on LOL! "BEST COLLABORATION EVER!!!"
Hi Bae😍
Since 2015 with you ❤️
My favorite
An Evening With Silk Sonic is the type of Album that will teleport you're Soul to the 70's everytime you hear it
This would be really great on LP and blast it off on HIFI!
Dope
This gives me Krampus from American Dad vibes and I love it 😭😭
뭔가 느낌이 헤어지고 새벽에 혼자 술마시면서 후회하는 느낌이다... 가사는 모르겠지만 그냥 느낌이 그래
Whether you know about Anderson Pak before silk sonic or not, enjoy the music and be blessed by the talent ✌🏼
I cried

Winter the dolphin passed away last night. I’m absolutely Upset. She was suffering from Gastrointestinal infection which they found on a test November 7th 2021. Then on November 11th. 2021 8pm local time. She died from complications from a surgery she was about to have.  God bless you winter and I will miss you 😭   “During preparation for a procedure, the CMA Animal Care team observed that Winter’s behavior and vital signs were declining. The medical team tried several life-saving efforts, but she died being held by her caregivers.”
Wow 🥺 ain't no nobody else!

wheres the god damn lyric sheeesh haha this masterpiece just a magnificent bangerrrrr
Most goosebumps song ever written
OMG.  It’s like being back in the day with my parents still alive and Us kids trying to listen to “grown folk” music.  We didn’t have much but we had each other. We had amazing music. We had love. You young men have taken me back to memories that I hold so dearly. Put on a smile is exactly what I did for my siblings as we buried each of those parents two weeks apart from each other and me being the oldest, I had to put on a smile so they would know we would all be ok and that I had them.  Purely marvelous. Magical. I tried to stay up until midnight. Lol. Didn’t work but as I ride my scenic ride on my Peloton, I’m smiling because I can hear my daddy singing all off key as my mom tells him “you sound good honey” while we all crack up laughing cause us kids know otherwise. Job WELL done Silk Sonic. I love the WHOLE DAMN ALBUM and I can’t wait to spend an evening with y’all in some city or country!
This album is gonna be 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥I’m loving it ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Bruno is Super Silk, Anderson Paak is Super Sonic. They are not from this planet cause Bruno is from Mars and Anderson Paak from heavenly Stars. ❤️❤️ Love you Bruno. Love your songs, Love the creativity you bring. You bring smile on everyone's face.  Congratulations to you and your band. 🙏🙏

I need to meet these dudes someday but as a celebrity myself when i eventually become one
If they dont get at least 4 awards ( in each music award)  then there's something wrong. The quality of music they have produced is immaculate, unlike the other groups out there.🤔🤔
This is so classic! ❤️

Oh, miren aquí amigos Tómalo de tu tío Bootsy No es ninguna vergüenza rogar bajo la lluvia Dile a ella cómo te sientes realmente Ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh Puedo fingir cuando salgo con mis amigos No estoy pensando en ti Puedo fingir que no estoy sentimental Pero eso no es cierto, nah (nah) Cuando te llamé por tu nombre Ese era mi ego, mi plan y mi dolor Debería ser una estrella de cine La forma en que interpreto el papel Como si todo estuviera bien Oh, no intento ser el alma de la fiesta Oh, eso no, solo para todos Pero todo es solo un truco Que no puedo tenerte de vuelta Sin ti corriendo, volviéndote loca Intento poner una sonrisa (poner una sonrisa) Intento luchar contra estas lágrimas Pero Dios sabe que estoy muriendo, muriendo Intento poner una sonrisa, sonrisa (poner una sonrisa) Ooh, solo estoy sonriendo como un tonto Cuando la única cosa por la que vale la pena sonreír Chica, lo único por lo que valía la pena sonreír eras Tú tú tú… Si pudiera devolver las manos a mi Rollie, sabes que lo haría Hubiera pasado todo mi tiempo asegurándome de que mi bebé esté bien Estoy tratando de esconder la vergüenza Sé que estoy jugando un juego peligroso Pero desde que te fuiste, no he sido el mismo Hay mucho que un hombre puede fingir..  Oh, no intento ser el alma de la fiesta Oh, eso no, solo para todos Pero todo es solo un truco Que no puedo tenerte de vuelta Sin ti corriendo, volviéndote loca Intento poner una sonrisa (poner una sonrisa) Intento luchar contra estas lágrimas Pero Dios sabe que estoy muriendo, muriendo Intento poner una sonrisa, sonrisa (poner una sonrisa) Ooh, solo estoy sonriendo como un tonto Cuando la única cosa por la que vale la pena sonreír Chica, lo único por lo que vale la pena sonreír Cuando la única cosa por la que vale la pena sonreír Chica, lo único por lo que valía la pena sonreír eras Tú tú tú Intento poner una sonrisa (poner una sonrisa) Intento luchar contra estas lágrimas Pero Dios sabe que estoy muriendo, muriendo (poner una sonrisa) Estoy sonriendo como un tonto Cuando la única cosa por la que vale la pena sonreír Chica, lo único por lo que vale la pena sonreír Cuando la única cosa por la que vale la pena sonreír Oh, lo único por lo que valía la pena sonreír eras Tú tú tú…...

ANOTHA ONEEE
danggggg!!! this was so good😍
I don't know but when bruno hits them high notes- i felt that🥲
I'm just gonna comment so I can brag that I've listened to this before it reach 50k views and the video is just posted 30mins in. Bruno and Anderson Paak, men it's just immaculate I'm not even bias. This songs are just fly and fire 💯🔥🚫🧢
I was actually getting this "hurt" feeling with the vibe of the song but when Andy sang "the hands of my Rollie" I cracked hahahhahahha
Smoothest sound waves to ever grace my ears 🙌🙌🙌
Masterpiece
Whoever disliked this is going to hell
Damn Bruno and Anderson really are students of Motown. This is some of the best funk and soul ive heard since the 80s.
Lagu-lagu dari Bruno Mars emang ga ada yg mengecewakan , hampir semua lagunya enak didengar
The Isley Brother energy on a stack!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Almost got emotional off this one. Sure wish Ive had this song go get through some dark times 💔 Know the feeling all too well
One is caught up playing the impassioned protagonist in one's Subjective Narrative of Self.🎈
This is REAL music 🎵🎵🎶
Este dúo es lo mejor del 2021, 2022, 2023, ....!!!!!! ⭐
Anderson is popping off on this one! I really love this new duo! Hope to see more of these kinds of songs!
Anderson Paak carries Lowkey
Bruuuuno, Bruuuuno, come through w/the vocals my gawd 🖤🖤🖤
is best ideal album to close the year
❤️🔥
I wouldn't mind artist spending a lot of time in hiatus as long as they release quality music like this. Timeless masterpiece 😍
Dioses, tremendos, maestros, gigantes, ídolos
oxee, calma ai lindo eu nãp tava preparada
🤎
This is going to sound great on cassette playing on my boom box...yes I am that old school.
se um dia eu ja fui triste eu nem me lembro mais
silk sonic just keeps releasing bangers after bangers fr
I smiled listening to this shit 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾🤎🤎
Indonesia Hadirrrrrrr
Best song on the album
Look, I love ALL four (4) songs, and I believe ALL four (4) sons are 10’s (aka hit singles).  The only time I cringed is when they used the “B” word to describe females in Smoking Out the Window.  But, they come back with Put On A Smile and then apologize for calling her out her name😂🙃😘😉 just masterful guys; and that opening from uncle Bootsy Collins—I’m bowing down to greatness!
❤️❤️
TE AMO!!!!!!!!! NO PUEDO ESPERAR A VOLVER A VERTE EN CONCIERTO!😍
Lo mejor del 2021, by far, so damn good music!
Ya vi que con esta voy a llorar
Bruno went fucking nuts in the last minute of the song
The Isely Brothers & O' Jay's Combined.
Just  send me my ticket  for  the first concert  in California 😃 Front row I'll be there. Great sound  and Great music.
sino nanakit kay bruno !!?
I really like this duo...they are lit🔥🔥
I'm dying too because I need the video of this gorgeous song 🥵♥️
Waiting on my cd as I type. I'm gonna love it from beginning to end. Kudos to Silk Sonic. It's well worth the longgggg wait
Esta es una verdadera obra de arte, apenas la escucho mi corazón se estremece, qué manera de transmitir los sentimientos, y la voz de Bruno 😭 Grandes!!! Orgullosa de ustedes  Bruno Mars y Anderson Paak!!!!!!! 🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪❤❤😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥
