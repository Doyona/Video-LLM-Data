Sexy woman anyway, super breasts
Powerful song one of my favorites ❤
HMM
Im not a vomen.  Im a venom
I'm all in🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Why isn’t she more well known?? Wow!
Halsey ❤😊
is the unedited version available anywhere?
I’m four years late how did I miss this anthem?  FIRE- roadtrip - song. ❤
No thanks that's just ordinary pop music....
Lucifers work is chaos? I think is art, nothing more art and art is not eternal
If there was a god...it would be a woman of any species
By saying you are a woman you are defining god … now what? You give life. You give life. You are life…life long and for EVA❤
This album was so underrated! But as long as it’s here for me to be able to listen to and cherish forever is good enough for me
This is my favorite song!
Oh no. In accent. This is Halsey so sexy. I’m like a version of Klaus on American Dad mixed with a pack of Gila Monsters stalking some prey to feast. Try me. #OTGFIREBRICK we need some peace quick. Seriously Blue Blue Blue to Stolichnaya Blueberry. I’m getting lit tonight BoyEEE haha - Rainbow.
So I checked in to President Donald Trump,,,before he was was president,,,he's my James Bond Check in,,for ,,,are you okay ,,,and im saying where's my next duty,,,how are we going to get this done,,,conversation with Donald Trump,,,,and,,,al of a sudden President Donald Trump cones,unglued,,,,where have you been,,,your 7 months late from checking in,,,,I said its okay man,,,,I have been hanging out with Halsey,,,and I  have a plan for The country of Peru,,,,im going to shower them of love,,Halsey convinced me of that,,,and after Peru,,Mr Donald Trump,,the rest of the world will follow,,,,Halsey and Dan Jolicoeur spent some quality time in Alaska
Hahaha!! Suckers
All my girlfriends went to Halsey,,,,,and said we never seen Danny inlove with a woman like this before,,,,they were making sure that Halsey wasn't toying with me
hints of the tetsuo the bullet man theme in this one
She’s a guyyyy
This song is hot as f😅😅😅
Love when NIN comes thru to elevate an artist that I otherwise would not have really been into
Most underrated album in history
Choooon
F for fierceness
2025??😊
Athena twinne Goddess said call them God your are
Correct title "I am not sane, I am crazy"  You will regret ever making this song for your entire life, unless you repent.
❤❤❤
I’m not saying the conspiracy theory that the music industry is heavily Freemason/satanic and that pop stars have to sell their souls to the devil and then use their music videos to cast occult spells that use the audience as non-consensual witnesses to the ritual is true but… damn they really just be putting incredibly dark, occult symbolism in E V E R Y T H I N G. Makes ya think…
Mi Himno.
ARTISTA!
Every girl on here I'm not a woman I'm a God 😂
One of those songs that captures what women think and feel with a video (even though a mix of history and fantasy) that matches our lives and views.  Perfect.  Period.
Conozco esta canción desde que salió, han pasado algunos años y la sigo considerando TREMENDA OBRA DE ARTE
This whole album is amazing...when you get to work with Trent Reznor and Atticus, and aren't scared 😨😳 to ☠️💀.dearh. holy amazing!!! 🤩 Trent is one of my magic rock God folks! He played Sioux Falls ,South Dakota, 1994. BEST CONCERT I HAVE EVER SEEN
Ha I can't write ✍️ tonight either, spelling has never been my forte
Remember, Halsey uses the pronoun, them/they They have gotten made at others using wrong pronouns... HONESTLY this pronoun stuff is exhausting. But aI love them. Honestly most folks can't read at a 5th grade level, and write ✍️ anything.bits kinda scary
Such a good poet...the Snl performance is AMAZING ❤❤❤ BLESSINGS FROM South Dakota
Who’s here in 2025 i love this song
Nine inch nails music vibes
*Where are the other lucky people are still getting this song on their playlist in 2025?* ❤️‍🔥👑
Serious production
your best album
❤
There is some mystery of Elena Gilbert or Katerina Petrova | Pierce (thank you for metaphorically stabbing her). She does not remember her name or how her body became this or this past should not be known. As a man you don't understand photography gossip - it's a language for half of our species. The flash has this same problem, with Barry Allen not remembering that night and only Dr. Harrison being there. 1:47 this was repeated at every time they got married, but everything has a past to be asked by Galileo or Figaro once a century or twenty years. Everybody in Vampire Diaries do not get that power from nowhere so there is some Mystery of "Castlevania country" how they became who they are.

A (female) friend once told me she thought men mistreated us out of envy because we were selected to create life naturally. I think Halsey had the same reasoning for this song.

This woman is real.  Did this while carrying guys.  She’s not wrong, you didn’t do that.  Many women do.  Better respect that.  Great job Ms. Frangipane.  Love that you and Trent collaborated.  Good stuff.

You can hear Trent Reznor's touch in this song. He turns gold everything he is involved with.

Trent x Halsey  The collab I didn't know I needed 🖤🖤
No way, completely different song.
No deal. I will not sacrifice genius children and wisdom or America's future for whatever the Fuck that is!!!! America wants their families bavk
all i see is a blasphemer ... not even one of your best songs.. please dont attatch GOD to it

Any religious people here
罪人が宗教を興す頼る。日本とフランスは犠牲文化だ。神のように頼る相手を殺しにかかる。我が物として自己愛に浸る。フランスはサイレントキラー、自己保身。日本は愚かさをさらし続け完全に悪人迎合。Rien n'arrive sans action, mais les actes criminels, oui. Le présentateur de télévision Shinichi Hatori et Shinichiro Azumi, le criminel impliqué dans l'affaire de la section des trompes de Fallope, font simplement courir des rumeurs selon lesquelles le système zombie a réussi à détenir des criminels, à rendre le public heureux pendant un moment et à le tromper, mais il semble que rien n'ait progressé. Chaque jour, je suis la seule bonne personne, et d'autres continuent de diriger le mal vers moi. Hier, des gens sans scrupules ont conspiré avec les médias et m'ont frappé à la tête et m'ont fait passer un scanner pendant mon sommeil. Je veux qu'ils se vengent.  Quand j'ai dit à Pijus Bacevicius (qui a été découvert comme yakuza en octobre 2024 de cette année) que ma mémoire s'était considérablement détériorée après un scanner lors de ma première année de lycée au Japon, il a continué à prendre des mesures pour réduire ma mémoire plus de 10 000 fois depuis mai 2022.

This is a really great song. Halsey gets better and better….
Is the real story that you fabricated this song to explain the details of Ariana because it blew out of proportion with everyone's broken psyche and how the music was speaking to them?

Real footage of me explaining to my Minecraft villagers why they’re suffering so much and that they should worship me:
Shout out to Halsey and nin  ❤❤❤they did that
This is the first time I heard a song and watched a music video by the artist Helsey. I am amazed by the number of views of this music video!
Xudo bir dona Alloh
No lie, this song gets me a bit hot and bothered, and Now see the video...
Gets better with age. So does Honey. Deserved more success than it had.
At the beginning I was like oh girls, just get together... glad to see that ending 😅
Its impossible for me to not start some sort of body movement the second i hear this song...sometimes its a head bob, sometimes ill suddenly just drop it all the way to the floor...one time it was my excuse to walk like an egyptian outta conversation..it depends on the day & mood, ya know? And her SNL performance of this...FORGET IT.
I really wish I liked Halsey because she has great song/album titles.
How does this only have 22 million views? WTF has to be one of the best songs ever made.
Hail lucifer & lilith
Just like the instrumental
So pretty …talented
Fk Ariana Halsey on a whole other level..get TF outta here?!.. shit wanna talk about Ariana and the word copy..🤭🤭💯
Welcome back to Magdalyne's Blyss Holistic Healing Center Global WORLD PEACE initiative. Women ARE Gods.
Don't know why but this masterpiece reminds me of Padme Amidala
This is even better than Ariana's
😍💗🔥🌡😈😋💋
Exactly..💯🙏❤️👌👍😎💪🤗
Bangers!
Es como la idea que tuvo Emilia con MP3 de revivir los 2000s en sonido y estética, aunque esta nueva era de Halsey parece producida por A24 después de rodar Maxxxine.
❤❤❤❤😢😊😊
I'd like to wear her like a hockey mask 😊

The older I get the more I respect the way this song was written. I hope Beyoncé a good time on the side to even up the score.

Good job I met my vampire wife be careful she's black 🖤
God is a woman, Ariana grande nasty
I made it to 28 years old yesterday. I love you, like a Goddess.
Ela tá em crise pfv entendendo que isso é um grito de socorro..ou um desabafo choroso de baixa auto estima
Halsey is a pure GODDESS,with so much talent
I love this. But I wanna know what happened at 1:48!
This song is awesome. I heard it on actress Julie Graham instagram post celebrating women and I completely loooooove it!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
I still can't believe Trent reznor from nine inch nails help her with this
I'm a mother, I produce dark music. And you remind me that I can be both at the same time.
I have always loved her voice but this album made me a true fan
God don't die but you will

what a brilliant song and voice to sing it.
I leave my mark here so that when someone thinks of giving a "like", I get a notification and reminds me that I have to listen to this gem again.
This song needs to be played while women are walking the runway with their kids
You are not a god, you are ordinary person.
Scream expensive
dont like
This is the best Halsey album, love and power make me something that I even cant explain, Im halsey fan now
Bless Halsey, They Are My Goddess/God. I could be an atheist who found Halsey and then Praised Venus as a Roman Goddess next to the saint of Virgin Marie's
This album is so special, so powerful its strike a unique  chord that resonates with humanity it will forever remain timeless.
Bless Kali Ma Mother of all universes and all other divine feminine spirits. We humans women is spark from these spirits. We are living gods and goddess.
What she mean by god ?! 😭😭🫣..
Eu ainda não superei a obra-prima que é esse álbum.

Everyone saw halsey get pregnant yay 🎉🎉😂😂😂

You are not God.
❤❤❤❤😂
Yupp, that's how I feel about my wife. She's crossed over. I was the concept artist and she was the creator. She made a beautiful daughter
Stop cursing the Name of My Spirit because You're mad at someone pretending to be Me. Use thier Name Lil not My Spirit. Last warning before the Reaping...  -Ki

She super confused. Occult life warped her mind so much that delusions are her reality.
LMAO God my ass. I'd never bow to such a person. Despicable.
If you are God. Create a human now with a shape similar to yours. In one minute
She'd be hotter If she had eyebrows. Trent Reznor is the best part of this album. Need the instrumental
Das heißt doch ich bin Gott. Sowas habe ich nie behauptet und würde ich auch nie, das wäre ja voll peinlich.
It’s going to be so hard for her to top this album
#halsey + #NIN is such a plus <3  love you halsey and @NIN
Just perfect mix of Halsey with NIN! ;-)
Amo esta cancion ❤
I really dont want to like this song bc of douchey trent...but this is my fav. Halsey song. I cant help it. I will chalk it up to a "guilty pleasure."
Thank you trent reznor and Atticus Ross from Nine inch nails for this
If this is trailer I need to see the whole film😊😅😂
Olim
I play this song to remind myself im a badass women and i got this! Love you halsey ♡
🦬
But I will
I seen it I don’t need to study innate
JERK
STUDY IT
STUNNING
👊🏿
Really
ما هذه الهرطقة!!
The song gives a lot of “The Great” Hulu vibes
if u want my honest opinion, god is a woman, & the problem with the world is we continue to worship the father, it shouldnt be father, son. it shouldn’t be mother & father. this is why our world lacks nurture, empathy, compassion, & understanding, bc this world needs the divine feminine. call to the mother, after all isnt she the creator? we need her now more then ever. pray to both if it makes you better! our world needs our divine goddess now more then ever !!! ❤
I did some investigationg and i found out that this is inapropriete if you look close enough 0:09

I thought it was and I like got a grave in a suitcase
Just found out that Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross produced the entire album.  Now I have to listen to the whole thing.
This appeared in my recommended and reminded me of the song “The Girl Who Wanted To Be God.” So thanks for that! Also it’s not bad.
For someone who grew up in the post-hippie generation and performs live to this day-most recently six days from today-she has so much respect for me as an artist. I always enjoy her work.
To be honest I like to pretend that the  I'm not a women I'm a G*D lyric is changed from G*D to Nard
F yeah!! & love the Aries ♈️ tattoo on the leg! Being I’m a strong Aries sun & mercury & mars sign!
there is no god except Allah and its an absolute fact !!
Have you heared of that woman in the ISS, that almost punctured a whole in the hull (on purpose!!!!) ? No, yeah that's not mainstream and not the current zeitgeist. But she must be a godess, too! I hate this woman glorification these days. 🤮
Blasphemy
My heart is broken I don't expect it to mend Any time soon I carry on regardless
Maybe I could be  A better human With a new name
I am dead And yet I live What now?

Isso é uma obra de arte essa música entrou na minha alma, e me fez ver coisas que eu não tinha percebido antes como mulher. Halsey você é incrível escreveu outra obra prima.
Women are the world 🌎 women everything , no life without women ❤💪😍
This is horrible
Please people talk to me
❤
I'm not a woman, I'm a god......me as a man. It's okay, we all here for halsey
Классно нигерийские арабы обтирают белою девочку!..
As a dude, it is weird how much I vibe with this song, but Halsey's feels transcend gender.
Ok so she souled out and is now working for Satan. Lol what a bunch of clowns. YHWH ALWAYS WINS!!! btw this song and Lilith, and everything she’s put out lately is trash. Go figure.
I am god,I am man😂
You have to be ignorant AF to think it's something like Ariana Grande. You can't  even understand the MAJESTIC COLLAB WITH  TRENT (Reznor) &  ATTICUS (Ross) ✨️

They drugged her to make her film this.
No, you are not the great and powerful, YOU ARE NOT EVEN COMING TO CRITICIZE.
Yes i’m god ⚡️
I feel like this video should be made into a series. I would watch that, anyone else?
I am not a man, I'm a Baphomet
The mother of our coven, bless me with your voice. ❤‍🔥
The keyboard was my son and my sister in law wich is also my wife in law. We are strange, still on rights of respect and comom reverense.
God be blessed I retrive my hearth and my brothers hearth from theTemple of the Yuan-Ti and bring they Royals heads to home, breasfeed my babies with they blood so all the serpents know my family win over death. My gender is Apache. I´m the flying eagle genocide of horses. I can see your intentions about my bloodlines. Look at the sky, you don´t see me. I see you.  All the glory to the lord we have know Jesus Christ and his mercy we have the habits of angels, if you could forgive our presence as we forgive yours, since you don´t know our brotherhood Borders. There is many.
That song was composed by an eletric python that hack into a gorila speaker. So you know what they thing and how.  I´m better at the lodge, about the lodge roof with dinamous pales, the suitcase where skunks, and her eggs looks like apples without seeds. And we were all under her poison of maniac repetition, with insuflate prolactine, wish is eletric magnetic, we were all students of hardward college and we were tired of that snake eating everything we had, we ate her. With exception of my beautiful wife and her sister we where males of human specie. Beetween Phoenix and Skull n bones, like we said, the chicken is not easy, we just get harder of pet parenting. Like lions playing poker with me and my baboons that code Javascript and reach veterinary nutrition degrees. It´s a matter of comunication here. And diet. So eat. Famine votes cause expelion, don´t you reed? We ate serpents that ate skunks, we may sting but we will not lose weight on match. No cheating of nature. So you be welcome, If you rape whatever is your gender, country or class, we gonna hunt you, like we hunt animals of death. Lose your tongue in denunce but never your inocence of profesion. We give you a new one. Still we don´t ressucitate the death that died too long, neither agree in full with clonage, we can give you an honored grave. For you and the ones who kills you.  We all there have kill rapist on participation. So the poets don´t die of misery. Thank you for watchin, we will have more the next Season of Albums.
You get me closer to god ...
Awesome, love it
oh yea ur a god huh. what ab when u die. when everything you've saved up on earth is gone..  gotta keep these ppl in our prayers
He is not a man he is a God
"i. Am not a man , im a God"
I hate people who would put a child through this and not bat an eye. Ignorance is no excuse when the damage is done to a child. I hope you have the best life and that you have people who may not be your family, but matter more than people like the one you described, and I hope they make this tough time you're going through easier to get through. Best wishes, and good luck in life!
This beautiful woman will never copy anyone unlike most she writes her own songs plus does the music ECT. Ariana wishes sorry but Halsey is a very talented person and artist in oh so many ways ❤❤❤ love you Halsey keep bringing it
🪞
She is way better than Ariana Halsey creates her own music snd is so so more original she worked hard to get here.  She is an actually artist instrumental as well. They are nothing alike. Arian is an entertainer Halsey is a musician

This is about finding yourself in a world that's more confused than you. I am not a woman, im a god, refers to idolization and how it doesn't make her a better person. Everyone else is looking for Salvation while she realizes that being her is the ultimate point. Reaching through the gray to rise beyond the explanations because she is who she is. And that's good whether others say it or not
You talk to much some times and if i want You as soon as You see the change You don't want me is like eminem says i'm cold product translation i Will mis disculpas señorita perdóname mi persona si mis intenciones no son las de Dios y si no existe yo lo seria
Is sad they all looking for pleasure and wealth they all want the Best looking women and the happyness what like the theme says
كومي بي
Love Halsey, Love the Song but could Trent BE more of a one trick pony with the production?? C'mon man...same ole same ole...yawwnnnn
you are my god
These celebrities are wicked. She is not god. Every knee will bow and every tongue shall confess the Lord Jesus in the end. I don't listen to today's music but when you come across witches like these I will worn people. Stop listening to this stuff it is demonic. Turn to Christ before it is too late. This country needs to repent and turn away from sin. believe that Jesus Christ came and died for you and was rose on the 3rd day. Whoever calleth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. You need to be saved from yourself. You need to be save from your sins.
how have I not heard this song before?! ❤
Nice joke do you think you are immortal?
Currency was invented for control
honestly this is disrespectful to me as a christian.. the only God  we have is our father, our savior, Jesus Christ / God saved me
May Jesus Christ forgive you. Preaching on the streets is called ‘shoving down Christianity in the throat’ but doing this and performing a satanic religion on stage like Taylor swift isn’t shoving Satan worship in our throats, right? Jesus Christ died on the cross for you and He loves you. He calls you by name. Has everyone become so blinded by Hollywood that you can’t even see how she blatantly worshiping Satan? How is this okay? Satan wants you dead but Jesus wants you to have eternal life. Wake. Up. He is coming back soon, and He is coming like a thief in the night. Halsey, you will never, ever be God. Satan tried to be God and He threw him out of heaven along with his angels. You will never be God. Repent. God loves you ❤️

Because of the behavior I've experienced and observed no woman is a Goddess or nymph.  The sad to say, the only one is me, the physical living Isthar Lucifer.🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤ work on yourself to catch up. And I'm not a fraud like you.
I got BIG Taylor Swift Vibes from this 😈
Ok
Bueno dejo el play list sin su permiso porque porque soy hijo y sigo a buda y primero se ama a uno mismo es el camino de la iluminación Que Dios confía en otro Dios si nadie los defiende el lo hará y matará  al  que se meta en su way

"There is a Void, outside of Existence, which if enterd into Englobes itself & becomes a Womb, such was Albions Couch." -William Blake
Love this ! She did so good ! 👍🏻
“Everyone's like, ‘Oh, it's like this is a girl power album,’ and I'm like, ‘No, it's not,’” she asserted. “The lead single is ‘I am not a woman, I’m a god,’ it's not a girl power album. From jump, I'm like, ‘I'm not a woman.’ [...] Being pregnant, writing this album, people are expecting girlishness, you know what I mean? And any time where I ever talk about womanhood, motherhood, femininity, I'm usually talking about it with a taste in my mouth, you know what I mean? Like go be a big girl, a girl is a gun, all I can taste is the blood in my mouth.” - Halsey  People completely miss the point of this song, its kinda disappointing to see.
Disgusting now I don’t like Halsey anymore bro wat God are you u can’t even safe yourself or treat your disease and say your God 🤬
Taylor Swift ft. Ice Spice - Karma (Official Music Video)   it looks too much like !
Why does this remind me of Karma by Taylor Swift. Y'all using the same melodies
You're not a god. You're just a woman.
No thanks
Mix is a mess but I love halsey
It's Satan that divides us.
Trent is all over this one. She sounds like she was born to be a part of NIN.
That one part "I remember your ass had grass stains" ,😂😂😂😂
The god is one , thats so rude that you said that !!!

Damn halsey ❤
This is valhalla ?
Sehr gut 0:09
this deserves so much more views...guys... keep streaming for her :)
I'm a woman too, I agree with how strong and underrated we are but what makes you think we could ever be a "God" isn't that a bit irrational ?
How do you beat stock of das easy.  Watch them, around 9:30-10 they go up no buy. Oh okay. Around close they go down. Buy. Oh okay. Yayyy. Rich.
and I scream: https://youtu.be/5e6ftmM7ZZY?t=60
sorry but a woman can't be god but parents are the  real god🙏
Im officially firing ashera
Só eu que acho essa música parecida com Karma?
She practically surrendered... He handed it over. Sad
I thought that new Taylor swift song sounded familiar and I couldn't think of what song it reminded me of. Its this!
I make boopboopity boopboops happen bitch. She seen them that day i do all those magic tricks for the cameras at work.
This song saved me. It came out at a time when I needed empowerment and she delivered❤
This world needs Jesus
I’m adding this song to my birthing playlist 💗
Why not have another slay with fem power? Love this, love Ari.
Halsey - the modern goddess of beauty and music
yoohoo, Hel 144000 #recherchefryslan
What a waste of a sample from NIN
https://youtu.be/Lhqv9cs-4xU this song matches the sentiment of being a woman God :)
Oh my word, just found this and it's incredible.

Essa música é tão Nine Inch Nails.
LITTLFINGERZEF
I was thinking “the instrumental goes so hard” and then I learned it was produced by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross so yeah that checks out
Tf I used to love her but after this song I see that she's not worth the fame
Okay this beat is amazing! The song! Ugh if only her voice wasn’t so poppy.
There is actually a path to becoming a goddess. I mean a real goddess. Immortality and power. The ability to augment yourself in any way you please. Google is working on it with their AI. But we are safe, for the time being. I know something they don't. They might figure it out, but I doubt it. It might take thousands of years before another person does. I don't want to live forever. The shorter my life, the better. I'll get a cop to do it. I'll go after a pedophile or rapist and force his hand.
Omg this is wrong, and evil…
Bless me mother for I have sinned.
Empowering opening. (Lyrically). fitting cosindering the bpm. HAlsey i love youR arT so much. Inspirational and Exceptual. Sry if my English’s bad
people forgot mary gave birth to jesus, people forget there were women goddesses, people forget its women who continue the population
It’s sound like a Nine Inch Nails song with awesome voice of Halsey.
I saw Halsey perform this on SNL and I just HAD to search the actual music video because it sounded RIDICULOUS. No way this was a real song but here we are... shocked. It's like a sloppy 80s song with a vocal of a person who can't sing. Halsey can sing but she sounds like she can't in this song. This is a disaster of a song it's so confusing. It doesnt know if it wants to be synth sci fi or melodic
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Women need men to FEEL like a God. Feminists also love to use the argument that women give birth which is why they hold the deity title, but men have to first ejaculate for a woman to even give birth. female dogs also give birth to their kind, so child bearing holds very little significance.
Nika: WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS A SONG. IT'S SO FUCKING SONG BITCH!!
CU
Perfect 👌
God is a Women
Her songs are not as good as many artists. Rihanna and arian grande never call themselves God so who is halsey?
Are they with g-easy now
Keep telling yourself that
This song 2021?
This gurl real cutie.
You are a Goddess Halsey and your music has gotten me thru the worst parts of life and inspires me daily when I hear that beautiful voice coming from the divine feminine power that you truly are. You radiate all kinds of beauty and power and don't you ever let em get ya down and don't you ever forget who you are. Thank you from the depths of my soul ❤
Nadia always start with this catchy tune!🦋

So many singers/song writers speaking out to so many 🤭 who will it be?? Love this song/tune 💖🦢🐦🥳🌠☀️
Just learned how this song is about Halsey’s experience of being under the non-binary umbrella- I guess that explains why I connected with it without knowing why.
Regular.
Ariana Grande and Halsey??? Serious????  Ariana Grande lol...... child....  Halsey diva... Halsey singer!!!!  Omg.... lol...

I love this. It's like give us Bloodborne with a healthy dose of dark souls all rolled into one
honestly, it slaps so fucking hard. This song is power
I knew this was a great production from the very first listen through the radio of a guy at work. I used the Google finder and have been listening to it for a week. Great track, great atmosphere. I wish all pop music had this standard. I love 50's, 60's , 70's 80's pop. Some 90's and some 2000's. A Quite a bit of trance. My main taste is classic Rock, Progressive Rock, Jazz and Jazz Fusion. I thinknI know when something is special.

I love this song & video so much. Such a great message, in this time femininity is still seen as a weak thing, when in reality it’s one of the most powerful things out there.
brilliant song but really she has no voice...
Ave Maria Purísima, me inclino ante nosotras Diosas  que obtendremos todo poder merecido para que mejore todo lo creado y por crear. El portal está definitivamente abierto. Sólo podemos triunfar. BRILLEMOS  HASTA CALCINAR TODO MAL. Así  es. Así será. Así  fue. Así  sea. AMEN.

Good lord, after many months of hearing this beat in a song played at work, I have finally found the song.   I listen to sound verses the words.  I first thought it didn't sound like Rihanna taylor doja beyonce, etc.   Maybe it's halsy since I enjoy the without me song awhile back.   And Boom found it after typing halsy and listening to a few of her recent songs.  I honestly like instrumental and vowels halsy sings.   The words I couldn't really hear since I work at a dogcare place.   When I hear this song, I think of a brand new cat or truck driving on an interstate that's empty through a thunderstorm, without getting wet somehow.
nice
Halsey is not God. True facts.
HALSEY TE AMO

This performance is BRILLIANT. I Broke my Replay button...
kool
Do you think that you are a god when you die and get sick from the most insignificant cause of death? A god is only God, there is no god but God
Lyric makes no sense " I am not a woman, I am god"... (You mean goddess?)   I am not a martyr, I am a problem. (Isn't better to be a martyr since martyrs are remembered forever?) I am not a legend, I'm a fraud ( Why would you even sing that ?)  This song sound better ( I not a just a woman, I am a Goddess. I am a martyr, I get rid of problems. I 'm a legend and you are a fraud, You can keep your heart because I got millions)  This when artists runs out of talent. They have to sing sh*tty lyrics and dance nude to get attention. lmao!
Well then...um... God...Maybe you could stop singing like you are a four-year old girl then...
Typical NIN sounds. I love it.
Thanks to Warrior Nun! I got here
Why so many dislikes ? Crazy nut religious peoples disliking this pieace of art because she dare to put in the title i'm a god ?
It's amazing how this song mythologizes itself as it goes along. Bowing to Halsey for getting NIN on this album.
Warrior Nun !!! - #SaveWarriorNun
The Oh' 🥺
Blasphemy???
Halsey must be a Scorpio ♏️
Help...I love it
So you have my SS 14k Italy bracelet because my look was similar in apt. I believe that. Well problem.
Deserved video of the year so bad ❤
ale co ja
Only came to support Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Halsey can sing but that’s about it… sorry Halsey fans. But music is subjective.
😀
This feels like the yassification of Game of Thrones and im here for it💅
The world is under a spell. I'm glad Halsey made it out!
FEMININE POWER!!!! :)
Que mulher incrível, meus amigos----
I love it
MOTHERRR
False prophet
Trent brought me here,She is the second female musician that i love every single one of her songs...
Came here bcoz of Warrior Nun.. Great song 🥰
Halsey looks so good pregnant. No one else looks as good as her 💯💯💯💯💯
As wolves amongst sheep they have wandered
I came from Warrior Nun!! Amazing song, amazing Show!! 🙌🏼😍😍
Came after karma by Taylor swift comparisons
perfect congratulations
I actually have a task for the Isis archetype, so, get ready.
Interesting concept, so if you think of the ancient Egyptian dieties, Isis, has a woman's head while others are animals.
Satanic- the message of idolatry, the imagery, everything. This is the oldest lie in the Book from Satan himself: you can be as gods. Do not be deceived - this isn’t a metaphor, this isn’t artistry. Hollywood and the music industry are steeped in Satanism. Wake up. We are in a spiritual battle and these are the end times when people are truly lovers of self and here is the evidence.   Repent and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved. Leave this darkness and turn to the true God who saves.
To sacrifice your children to the false Gods is one of Gods most hated sins on Earth. I get that she laments, but this must be stopped.
the scene is warrior nun 😌
HYMN 😍❤️
Wow super super out of this world
Quite delusional to think that you are a god.
It’s the 1st virus an the base for me 🤩🤩😊🤯
She deserves more
Do you thing Taylor Swift copyrighred this in her "Karma"?
I came here to see this song after hearing this song in Warrior Nun season 2. Still this is so good. It gave me goosebumps !!!!
Btw, go in the woods if you can and listen to this. We’re always Gods in the woods alone
Speechless 😶 omfg I'm in love 😍😍😍😍😍
Halsey, get away from those women lol and also, thank you for hating weed a while ago.
WARRIOR NUN S2
I'm here from Warrior nun 😅
Warrior Nun brought me here...  again....
❤ Halsey . Her voice is amazing !!
Pretty sure the original lyrics we're...I'm not a monster, I'm a God.
Warrior Nun🥷⚔️🤘
Am Probably here coz of warrior nun😏
Best song to get some Nuns pumped for a fight 😌
LOL. a god.. you'll be slayed in hell and I shall watch.

I am more than a woman I am a God💜
Person-idolatry with Halsey for object of worship.  Very nice song though.
"koi!" ©
Karma is my boyfriend 😭
Number one cool woman.  At leats she honest.  Trent Reznor shot out still riding alone . Ya'll send me somewhere.
This was way better then I thought
god damn it its so good

Plz Don't Contrast a Women with Girl .... God is The super creator of us all..
what garbage is this? pollution to my ear!! 🤢🤮
So who is the woman in this video she looks similar as hell but has a few differences as well as halsey being on the atone floor as she walks into frame.....???????
People who are humble feel…humble with your own will*
❤️👸🏻🤍 Maybe I can be a better human in a new place.  Keep your heart ❤️ because I already got one🤍   It really does hurt when you love someone
i like when she have short hair
Love that it was produced by Trent Reznor. Can hear his influence
Omg this music video reminds me of outlander so muchhh
My sister is my Goddess! She is the only God I worship!
yep i agree with her thats pretty fucked up.
Very good😎
Only after several times  I could understand: Halsey speaks straight from her heart, but partly ironic or cynical, and partly self-relativizing. The question: "Why do I feel good without a partner?".  Cynical: "I am a god" - don't take this literally.   And self-relativizing. "I'm a fraud". "I'm better all alone". "Keep your heart, I already have one".  A great woman!
The end feels like a start to a DnD campaign
I am more than a woman I am God. ❤️
I love u for selling ur soul to nin
this masterpiece
A God ? No .  Until you’re shut stops selling . Mumble a few more hits out and then be a TV show host .
cant believe it came to this.....
Even us goddesses know there is one true god though.
God no one knows how much i love her
You can really hear the Nine Inch Nails influence in this.
Heed 1 Timothy 2:9-15 and I would love to tell you The Truth from The Holy Bible about what is going on. However, I politely encourage you to read it for yourselves. By The Way, check out Truthunedited and Stephan Darby's sermons to get a deeper understanding for The Life. May Yah bless you and HALLELUYAH!
❤️❤️❤️
Why is this song so catchy?👑😈 It Doesn’t sound anything like Ariana song?
The whole idea of Women being god or a god is pure ignorance and cringe.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
God is Jesus Christ of Nazareth and no one else. This here it's a blasphemy.    Women are great on their own. Men are great on their own. But there's no one like God and there will never be. May God bless you all reading this comment. Amen
God I can only wait for this female so much longer 😆
Being born born being inside in our life live
Pls come to Glastonbury
she did it. this is the new shit
Con respeto ví unos errores en la letra.de está hermosa canción.
1 yıl oldu bile vay be
goosebumps from the beat with headphones... even after the 20th time of listening to it <3
Thank you
This song caught me off guard at the iheartradio concert.   Never heard of her , blew me away
If you feel this is Halsey's Best song to date.....
Like Ariana(most holy), Halsey fails to know eho and what God really is, but by this time next year, she along with Ariana will know who and what God is along with the billion other soul's, if they are willing to pay the price for the truth that is! Will you be willing or do you want to be one of the ignorant five billion remaining people who wish to live this life blissfully ignorant in what you think you know rather than what you should know, which is truth?
I can't believe i had to listen this masterpiece in fate the winx saga to realise it's a bop
I was here before fate , but I'm glad this is in it! I was so happy I love this song and Halsey!💞💋👑
Fate the winx saga season 2 episode 1🥰
Who Is here for Fate ❤️
tnx for tune
This should be a movie sequel
A god(dess) would sound sublime when singing. Not like this. I can't wait until this horrible mush-mouth style of vocals loses popularity. And I thought the millennial-whoop pop from 10 years ago was annoying...
So basically its god is a woman
Yuck
Chilean girls: THIS IS WHAT I STILL TRYING TO TALK ABOUT. (L)
Who's here after Winx?
She is a god yahhh
Who discovered this masterpiece because of fate: the winx saga?
Who's here after Fate: The Winx Saga?
Halsey is obscenely hott🔥🔥🔥🔥😉
This is demonic
Best song on the album, an absolute anthem! It's also fairly universal... switch out the word "woman" for "man" and i think its just as applicable to most men even if it wasnt written with that in mind.
Классно.
Gods don’t exist especially women
Every day I've got a smile where my frown goes A couple bodies in the garden where the grass grows I take 'em with me to the grave in a suitcase Maybe I could be a different human in a new place Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So I'll stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already Every morning, got a hollow where my heart goes I never listen, but I see you with my eyes closed I know you, I remember from the grass stain Maybe I could be a better human with a new name Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So, I'll stay right here cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already I'm ready to leave it I'll go when I feel it Got caught both hands on the smoking gun I try, but I need it It's hard, but I feel it And it really does hurt when you love someone Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So I'll stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already got one
Halsey is far above NIN. Hail the QUEEN!

Honestly..  that's kinda messed up... none of us are "gods" I don't care if it's just the name of a song or not. We are not supposed to be idolizing people that way. There is 1 God. 1. This song isn't even good...
The production in this song and in this video IS INSANE.

OK I GUESS BUT HALSEY IS STILL NO MATCH FOR MADONNA, LADY GAGA OR EVEN KIM WILDE.
The music is so good and I get vibes for Spartacus and GOT watching the video. Love Halsey's work. :)
Im so proud of u
Jesus loves you

One word......WARRIOR!
You are Not a god🤦‍♀️
Trent!!
heh woman
her music makes me feel like I can do anything in life 😭
I'm NOt A Man I'm the LORD, I DONT need A PEN, i have a Godess, i'M AM NOT ACon im a pro, Do we have A problem. my old life i really miss it. PEACE TO ALL THE ALEONS
Her agressive "cry" in the end sounds so freaking cool, my fave song from her
Illuminated
REAP WHAT YOU SOW
NOTHING HURTS MORE THEN BEING BACKSTABB BY THE 1 YOU LOVED
Also how one can walk beside the fence of a big yard and understand that other side and the feel of the grass , the tears that grew it , the sun and sunset , could never not pier through enough too see that other side , I feel it's only something I can say for myself , everybody knows something I don't want to know couldn't help but to comment twice and never think twice about it ✝️
I am not a god OH MY GOD ! Listen to it on a deeper level never as is , that's on an entire other level for me , I don't want to know you if you can't even bare your soul on a level such as described , God Bless you
Why does she look so different?
Hey you, yes you who is watching this, I'm asking you,  Ever wondered Why there's so much suffering in this world? And Why do we die?  Suffering is because of Sin, once sin is 🔪 suffering will also be 🔪 This is the proof of sin in each one of us, check yourself out: Ever Lied? Ever Disrespected Parents? Ever Got angry on people?(anger=murder) Ever Stolen? Ever Lusted after someone?(lust=adultery)  Because Everyone has sinned against God and became worthy of death(☆Rom 6:23) but God being a Loving Father sent His only beloved Son for us on the Cross✝️ to be Sacrificed as a ransom for our sins(We committed crime,  Jesus paid fine ☆John 3:16). And now whoever believes and accepts Jesus as his Lord and Saviour, he/she is granted freedom from sin, Everlasting life, peace✌, love❤ and joy😊 and a relationship with the Eternal God. (☆Acts 3:19)
I'll be here when this blows up I swear
Artsy.
The video come from a movie or the vid is like that??
I want to watch a movie based off of the music video! It looks so good!
i wonder is halsey is a narcissist
No you’re not there is only one God.
Nice blasphemy
But you fucking beautiful 😭😂
But you bleed ever month.  😒...
Blasphemous
If somebody get this, the beat is like from the game "The Batman", on old SEGA game console. From 0:39.

Halsey I'm a man ur a godd!
She is speaking of THE WHITE GODDESS
I cant stopppthoooo
U ble ew my mind to shards  I love uuu<u
Halsey is not a martyr nor a problem, but sure is a woman.  Maybe she is a god, because no human can make such incredible music !
Halsey // Hits'🌟  2015 : Ghost 2016 : Colors 2017 : Bad At Love 2018 : Without Me 2019 : Nightmare 2020 : You should be sad  2021 : I am not a woman, I'm a god 2022 : So Good
Very witchy and satanic. 🤔
Halsey is in her ARTPOP era
I feel power
Stop disrespecting God
This song is too perfect. Let's just say, "I am not a woman I'm a guy..."  I should not love this song the way I do.. 😆🤣😅
This is very cringe
You are not the god
The universe here kind of reminds me of The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon (it’s a book). Like i could picture the Queen Sabran of Inys with her ladies of honours.   (english’s not my first language)
i’m a metalhead but trent reznor + halsey have created a masterpiece oh my god
Every day I've got a smile where my frown goes A couple bodies in the garden where the grass grows I take 'em with me to the grave in a suitcase Maybe I could be a different human in a new place Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So I'll stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already Every morning, got a hollow where my heart goes I never listen, but I see you with my eyes closed I know you, I remember from the grass stain Maybe I could be a better human with a new name Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So, I'll stay right here cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already I'm ready to leave it I'll go when I feel it Got caught both hands on the smoking gun I try, but I need it It's hard, but I feel it And it really does hurt when you love someone Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So I'll stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already got one
How do I listen to this without the vocals?
I am a hair stylist so... therefore, I am YOUR GOD.
Such a puny plan...
Yes Halsey❤❤
I have a lot of wars like that how's you baby every thing good much love I am God but I set my mortality to mortal  It's like the movie dogma in the 21 century I usually have fun but this is staged yearing to be 2022 It would actual be 2###
I'm sorry for war mongering
I know you can you make a 9 amp transistor radio out of 5 amp transistors 1 9 amp transistor 11 five amp transiters mixing in sevens to make a microphone speaker that can here and sound any where
This is hiking cringe
I actually use this song as a prayer because is so freaking powerful
guys why is this album a flop?this deserve way much more  i dont get it
you are not fucking god, but yours songs are fantastic
There is no God except Allah and the last prophet we must believe in him is Mohammed.
#hasley #iamnotawoman #iamagod
No one: How to top Ariana's God is a Woman?  Halsey: Hold my beer.
I a god. Bro people be crazy  every secend

What happens when the Barbarian steps in?
They all think they are God's willow said the same thing in her song they are idiots! 😂 they are no God just ppl with big egos!
Ok but my question is what is a woman?
Hi my judeo-christian friends, I have just one tiny question for those especially strong in their faith. Are you there? Isn't JUST A title THE heresy of gargantual proportions?   Rethorical question if, and probably most, some of you did not notice.
I am a burnt offering  I am a statue I am no one
Girl are god 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
انت جد منزله هذه الاغنيه استغفر الله ولك الله بشوفنا ما بتقررين كنت تكوني اله
The production on this song omgggg
HALSEY IAM NOTA WOMAN
👎

Are your servants.... BLACK? Oh boy oh boy.
Hear me Abraxus
My blood sings in my veins  My power rises in me  Like fire 🔥
I feel everything
😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
I fucking loved how they worked with Trent Reznor and his team on this whole album. I love this song. Big fan of him and his team, now I'm a big fan of Halsey. And her way of just expression.
I love most of your music but  Seriously?
This is what “disappointment” sounds like. I guess it makes sense that not even Trent Reznor’s unique soundscapes and beats can save 21st century pop (garbage) music… Don’t know why I even got my hopes up.  Love songs and bragging… can pop and rap (same thing these days) “artists” come up with any other topics?  Not even considering the lame lyrics and music she normally employs, her voice REALLY ISN’T anything special.. don’t see the attraction here.
And I am nasty
I am not a martyr I'm a problem Stop trying to sacrifice me
This was horrible and mediocre at best. Lyrical content was subpare & she missed the emotional grab yet again....club music at best if that
wow
But woman means god
Magdalena Incarnata?
Tf happened to her face lmao???
Lol this is ridiculous 🙄
New Age Monarch
Where is my good Lord Darnley? I have need of his services
You are God in worship and modesty Not in sin and singing
Angels watch as the world burns

I declare a new Renaissance
If only her mother has chosen abortion.....
I like Halsey but news flash you're not a God not even close.  Just a lowly human
Doss she act ? She would be a great actor
Don't be sad little Betty  Benny loves you

Halsey can't write music
This music video is stupid.
I don’t wanna here anyone say Halsey is stealing anything. Ariana’s just a little princess. Halsey. Is the Queen.
Let's do this Lilly... like we talked bout b4 11 tonight
God dusturb by water !!!! You are weak mud ...full of weakness
Modern empty pop trash. Colourful but dead inside. I was interested about Halsey, because Trent Reznor gave her some advice
Very Beautiful, love it...
She took a stand to report Voodoo and Santeria and she got boosted. You all should be ashamed. She is God's Truth revealed, and for that she will be released. It was about time someone tough God's disciples about it. Bad things don't just happen.
fucking amazing. . . . gave me goosebumps
Tommy genesis a woman is a god (2013)
There is no god but Allah , all of you will be held accountable.  “Not a word does he (or she) utter, but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).”

strange bullshit
Она по фактам спела. Лучшая.
Halsey is garberage
This gives me Persephone vibes and I'm obsessed.
Crack

nice
Illuminate asf the rooms the girls the song I hate it here the devil is in all musics it’s crazy

Omg.imagine a song with rezz as a producer, and Halsey voice.
Repent
Goddess is the correct form to say to a woman haha
Next time I need rent money Imma pray to her
I love halsey😍
Oh. so fucking amazing I loveeee Halsey. Keep it up. Damm what about Melanie Martinez Halsey song???
this is her most iconic song in my opinion
I’m 51yrs young and never been to a concert before. But in a few days I will see you  in concert.  I’m excited and appreciate all you give for your fans. Bless you and your family.
Master. Piece. End of the story
This is so good
Trent Reznor &  Atticus Ross rulezzz !
Right...like she could be reborn. Doubt.
Very fitting for The Emperess' playlist. ^ u ^
Not big into the song or most musicians nowadays it's as all overdubs and computerized garbage
Guess who's not going to heavenn
This is amazing song 😍
this song title is me explaining my gender to people
Anyone getting Major Lazer & DJ Snake "Lean On" vibe from this music video?
Hey Halsey, I had a mediation one time that was very similar to the start of you film clip and wondering are you my friend or is this a familiar concept? Because at the end of my "meditation/dream" I got stabbed in the back by someone. I was going through trying to figure out how I died in my past life and I saw several lives that where pretty much the same as the one I'm living and at the end I heard a voice say hes in this life too. And I was going through deciding on having a baby at the time in this life. But we contraception now so I went for that... and I'm alive...
You're so beautiful, Halsey... Queen!
Please, sing much better song
You are not a God.
Completely a mockery noone is god
16M
I only hope Halsey refrains from going under the knife  to stay beautiful because the short term gain in beauty has an enemy called time !!! plastic surgery will start to show itself in a few years or when they hit there 40's. natural beauty  last longer and cost less to maintain then plastic !!!
Actually God does not have a gender
God the creator of life…god was a woman
Okay This feels like another anthem and rightfully so , Halsey's music is a work of Art and this song is just another example of that...💥😍❤️💯
(لا اله الا الله)
Beautiful. Unedited version is way better
Exceptionalities,Exceptionalities.... Isn't that their calling of the day,just being of reasoning
HER BEST SONG EVER !!! I said what I said! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻❤️💜💙
It touched me in such a profound way that I am unable to explain
A woman’s body is the most beautiful thing I can think of as a man
U need to be very depressed to understand the cinematography of video
There is only one God and he is our creator. We are not perfect we are imperfect humans who sin that is why Jesus Christ died in that cross so we can live an infinity life with him up in heaven. TURN TO JESUS BEFORE ITS TOO LATE God bless ✝️💗
Satanists
https://youtu.be/vYIhE0LJsXs
Very "Hesitation Marks" era sound that Trent and Ross injected into this.
Wow
Your not God BB !
is she showing us her initiation ritual?
Hi, Halsey's new album is flawless so I chose to translate it into Hebrew.  I would love it if you would watch it :) https://youtu.be/vYIhE0LJsXs
She's a fucking legenddddd !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Many stupid men are saying that they shouldn't listen to her because she is a witch. Please, they are so afraid of matriarchy and it is exactly what they get for having treated women as objects for centuries. And instead of understanding it like the smart people they are supposed to be, they want to shut down the rise of women. We are not getting up now, we always did, it was they who shut us. Now suck it up! ‘cause we are not coming, we’re already here!
How about, i am not a woman, I am godly?
she wins without trying 💖 thank you for sharing your heart with the world
Yes Greco-Roman Goddess vibes.
It’s ok
she thinks she’s a god lol
Here from her tiktok lol
mi reina te amo
Crazy tiktok man said not to watch these videos coz of witchcraft. Now I have to see it 😂
Who else came from the dude from TikTok
This reminds me of expressionless
Stop supporting her she doesn't care about us. This is witchcraft
I LOVE YOU
every person on this planet was birthed by a woman
Devil took born from her womb
Why is this woman famous? Weak vocal and annoying
This is a blasphemy !! U are nothing .
OMG HALSEY
AMAZING
The music is so Trent Reznor. Good collaboration, though.
No you aren't. There's only One God
I am a women In not a God but this screams I don't need no lil boy ruling my life
We only have 1 God, His name is Jesus.
Todo este álbum escuchado en altavoz es precioso pero usar audífonos/auriculares es una experiencia totalmente distinta, mil gracias a esta mujer por todo lo que se preparó para este álbum y por todo el esfuerzo que le puso a la historia que acompaña a cada canción. 💗
It's me! Ava Missouri
shittiest title eva
I like this song but we need a better phrase than, I am a God.
I love this song
Woman is a God because a woman can Carry a Life inside
This songs give a mix of Ariana Grande and  Melanie Martinez vibes
it is true that, our worth on the world is more than any other creature , but whatever we becomes we should not forgot   that we are not a god but just a creation of GOD, the time is not to far when he will show upon us HOW much he bear our bad words,but still now nothing goes to far ,we can go back to CHRIST he will accept us.DON'T FORGET WE ARE NOT GOD JUST THE CREATURE ,WHO DON'T KNOW WHEN WE WILL DIE, THIS LIFE IS NOT OURS ,HE GAVE US THIS , THEN HOW CAN WE BE GOD.
Working with Trent Reznor did her REAL GOOD. Danm.
Now u have to pay see u on the otherside
What a dumb statement
https://youtu.be/3sCIiTAUPZU jhuyf
this sound is underrated asf
this could be a movie
Sukirt😋
About time women realize their divinity! Ariadne Grande was a pioneer to womens divinity!
You people are so lost to be ok with the words coming from her mouth
this song kind of sucks.  the video is even worse.  stereo typical pathetic cringe is how i would describe it.
Why do everyone think their God's put it in context. A God is something in a sense that creates life and brings death. A creator. Well women don't create life on their own. Its takes a man so a man plus a woman have god like powers to create life..." ye are God's not he or she individually.
WTF 18+
Yall making me want to listen to Arianna
She is not a nigga.
A friend of the world is an enemy of god.
EDIT: Whelp there's making of vids 🤣maybe I should have watched them first. Still interesting to see that some of the concepts/time periods were right though.   I'm totally guessing here but females throughout history:  Sappho (Greek (possibly) lesbian poet - bath scene set in Roman or Greek period), Queen Elizabeth or Marie Antoinette (black dress w/collar & cuffs), Joan of Arc (white shift dress w/burn marks/dirty face),  Aphrodite (gold look w/gilded leaves into from of a tapestry of paradise?), then not sure.   Scenes of ripping off the collar/running from court, occult like worship (symbols on her body, laying on a hexagon table), then being drunk in the streets (the helmet on the soldier is the Spanish conquistador helmet, could be 16th or 17th century as the monarchy ended at the end of 17th).   Last guess: her running through the forest (being chased?), giving birth on a floor and then a house in flames and a man holding the child, is all from the same story line?   Whatever is going on, it's definitely an interesting concept and fun to guess at. Song is a banger too 💜
Is this a tv series?
cool 😎 song 🎵
<3
I saw the footage with nudity.
Well, goddess to be grammatically specific.
Wondering why didn't she get a nom at the grammys
Queen Halsey
Beautiful
Not taking anything away from Halsey because she is awesome, but this track would be a lot less special without Trent Reznor or Atticus putting their talent into this. It's legit their signature sound.
Listen ladies you aren't equal to men yet alone God get a grip on reality men are better at being women just look at Lia Thompson
Hate to break it to this Hollywood Satanist there's only one God and that's your creator and he clearly states you are not a God and shouldn't worship false God's
She is definitely a real Goddess 💕
Love
No you're not respect our religion
I love this song 🎵 🎧🌹🌹🌹🌹
when Halsey was not in bra 😘😘
it's now April 2022 hope other legends are listening to this legend song l am also a legend too I am listening this and this song makes my life heart everything relax from bored this makes my life better things .. <33!!
Whole album is new downwardsl spiral
There's a reason this is oddly reminiscent of the background music for the social network.  Just saying.  LOVE trent & atticus
shut it patches!
Bu kadar harika olamazsın be kadın✨☄️🌝💪🏽 Bayıldım nasıl bu kadar geç izlerim 🤍
This is why I love the concept of godhood in matriarchal societies. There was one group in Southwest Asia (I can't remember their name) that were so confused at the depiction of god in the West as male. They were literally so bewildered when Christian missionaries tried to convert them and responded, "Women are the only sex capable of giving birth. A man cannot give birth! Creation of life is the power of womanhood, so *of course* god must be female!"
Can hear nine inch nails 😅🥰❤️
You can Trent had something to do with this it’s Got nine inch nails over this
Woman 💖👸
sounds like a pretty hate machine impact
This song caught my attention the minute I found out the title. Great stuff.
🧡🧡🧡🌟🌟🌟🧡🧡🧡
So simple minded to compare something as old as "God is a woman" to Arianna Grandes pop song 💀 We are Gods. Its not something you can own or copyright.
She is lost
şahqser niye bu kadar az izlenmis
Blasphemy
💖💖💖💖💖
I am currently watching "the tudors" and I feel this song suits this image of King Henry's wives as powerful and amazing women (some of them) that suffered with his cruelty
Hİ FROM TÜRKİYE <3
Um... goddess is the word. I am one.
You ain’t nothing. Give you 7 more years and you’ll fall apart. Lol.
This is amazing and idk why.....and allso...eyebrows <3
The best part of the song was when u just didnt have clothes on 🤷‍♂️
Naomi brought me here🌚
u r not kanye
Amazing song!!!💜💜💜
Everything old she does is somehow new.
What I got, you got to give it to your mama What I got, you've got to give it to your papa What I got, you got to give it to your daughter You do a little dance and then you drink a little water

54My friend, I wish you serenity and spiritual peace with which you will obtain lasting spiritual happiness here are some Islamic concepts to eliminate those bad images  Painted by some deliberately suspected media  -Islam comes with the "Quran", the holy word of Allah.  When you listen to or read it, you will find unprecedented tranquility and spiritual peace -filling up the spiritual emptiness of the soul by answering all the questions of the soul, including-Why was it created?  What after death?   It gives the soul hope and removes anxiety and fear of the future- Islam sets a purpose for  life It.s a comprehensive lifestyle- based on justice and  equality-it carries solutions to all life's problems-suitable for every time and place,free of contradictions and myths-it rejects all forms of religious and class distinction   He holds the scientific lead(the stages of fetal development-the ascent Supports logic and reasoninto space and)He holds the scientific lead(the stages of fetal development-the ascent Supports logic - Islam has raised the status of women and established the right for them to live a dignified life -These rights include inheritance rights and property kinship rights, as well as  the right to work without violating their dignity-Islam prohibits the exploitation of a woman's beauty and youth, and abandons her in old agewhich  despite deliberate distortions -is why Western women are more inclined to Islam, because Islam gives them motherhood and psychological stability, especially when they are old, despite deliberate distortions   The image of Islam to western women - The messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him, is the last messenger of Allah preached by Jesus and Moses,  may they Thinkers and researchers who study his biography say that he changed the course of history. -Although Islam is deliberately distorted and linked to terrorism from time to time - despite most Muslims have given up their responsibility to promote Islam, but Islam attracts 2 billion people-Islam ranks first in the world in terms of dissemination- Islam  It is very popular among  celebrities the public-through your research On the Internet or on your Muslim community website, you will discover the truth, bring yourself spiritual happiness,  and make your reality better. - https://youtu.be/GnnD7YUWybI https://youtu.be/dho9_qifaNc https://youtu.be/ZcUUYXx5Yio http://www.e-quran.com/language/english/english4/    www.islamhouse.com    www.thekeytoislam.com
21Islam raised the status of women and addressed her with her humanity and principles, and equalized her with discourse and duties with men- Islam singled out women in the largest wall of the Noble Qur’an, Surat An-Nisa - and the Messenger Muhammad, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, praised all those who honor women - and demanded Hellfire for those who wronged her and cursed- Islam guarantees a woman a decent life throughout her life through inheritance rights and requires spending on her father, husband, and brother - and her right to work that does not jeopardize her dignity- A woman in Islam feels psychological security and stability whenever her body recedes, unlike the woman in the West - at this stage, (mother) Islam is considered the most obligatory respect and appreciation for the mother from all society, especially from children and grandchildren- Gaining the love and approval of the mother represents a path to heaven, and her anger leads to fire in Islam, which is considered the mistress of the family, and everyone loves to win her love - from time to time you find all parties presenting her with gifts- There is nothing in the Muslim family that worries the West about the flight of children from homes - the process of abortion, suicide and the dispersal of the family, which has become a prominent feature in the West in a frightening and increasing manner, and in most countries that claim the freedom of women, especially in girls- The Muslim woman with her veil is the one who owns her freedom, so only the one she loves can see her beauty - unlike the Western woman, she does not have the freedom to control her beauty in front of the owners of sexual frenzy- This is an overview of the Muslim woman. As for the Western woman, and her suffering, it will be at an upcoming date, God willing
Idiotic video.  She got no voice.
😍
astaghfirullah
Her IQ is too high, but I would at least ask her for physical favor.
Blasphemy!
goofy
Dig the Saturn rings symbolism in the pool clever...lol not...;)
If that were true you would have been able to sing like a God let alone look like one. Your just another pawn for the wizard of oz. You poo poo too and will soon be flushed down with the rest of it. To all those that live by this idea...if that were true you abd your word was law you would have been were you wanted to be years ago and never suffered a moment of energy loss.  You are all pawns trust me ;) we will see in the end
Nine inch nails
As a man, I relate to the lyrics so much. When she says I am not a woman, because I am not a women either
Terrible
Who knew halsey and Trent Reznor would be such an incredible mix
Beautiful ❤️🥰
My theme song
Thank you
Damn. So pissed this is just a one hit wonder album. So much potential wasted. Boring as fuck. Got rid of it after wasting $15.
These are literal satanic rituals right in your faces lmao.
Satan. said. wait.
Halsey with Trent and Atticus? Hell yes!
Я одна подумала, что в конце на полотне герб РФ?)

When is the movie going to be released ?
This is art 🌿🦋🖤
Soon all y'all gonna find out that you're defenitely not God or a god.. That the true God may open your eyes before it's eternally too late. (John 3:16).
She is a goddess.
I reallyyyy like this song
I can’t get enough of this song!! Love you Halseyyy!!!! 🖤😎🌹
Every day I've got a smile where my frown goes A couple bodies in the garden where the grass grows I take 'em with me to the grave in a suitcase Maybe I could be a different human in a new place Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So I'll stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already Every morning, got a hollow where my heart goes I never listen, but I see you with my eyes closed I know you, I remember from the grass stain Maybe I could be a better human with a new name Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So, I'll stay right here cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already I'm ready to leave it I'll go when I feel it Got caught both hands on the smoking gun I try, but I need it It's hard, but I feel it And it really does hurt when you love someone Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So I'll stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already got one
is halsey pregnant or was it just the video
You know, you can be BOTH.

This is a flower that has bloomed. NIN were the nutrients that gave it life. Now, the flower needs to be sustained through it's own nutrients and we'll see a beautiful garden growing. Looking forward to see it grow.
Idk but this sound so fancy 🥹
Oh damn this is weirdly addictive
Interesting title. Never heard of you before. If wiki is true you into killing babies and into trans and gays, so you are not a god. Just another mentally ill human. Which wiki also says. The gods and goddesses will set you straight, try one. Good luck.

Uma jovem tão talentosa.
My mother told me that when she was pregnant she felt like a goddess, Mother Mary, A GOD. The power of creating a life. I think this is what Halsey talks about.
Mais uma vez pra exatar a Deusa🛐🛐
Yasss god🛐🛐🛐
I love this video but what’s it about I’m confused
In a few years. This video will be Ender's area.
I'm not all alone ...
I am not legend I'm a God ... show consistency ...
Wow!
Reminds me of Closer by Nine Inch Nails
لعنت خدا هزار بار  نامت نام انسان  نیست تو شغال زرد مورمورچه. توشیشک تو پلید تو خبیث تو کافر بی‌دین چرا میگی مه زن نیستم توبه خدایا ازگفتنش مرا گنه کار نکنی میگه مه خدا هستم دستم برسد سرت را جدا میکنم مورچه زرد
I've played this song a million times 😍😍 it makes me feel like a badass
Divine femenin bullshit.
No just no
Your so talented amazing performance in sing 2 I love your voice
It feels like the sequel of castle
omg the scene of the Girl is a gun MV whattttt 1:53
1:42   so cute !
I’m sorry but this is my absolute favorite album from her, this ish is so good 😭
It's a shame this song isn't longer!! Love it.  3 weeks and I'm here again lol, had no idea NiN had a hand in this, can totally hear it now.
Lajsjsj do
WTF
f#ck those who are not letting it reach its deserved hundreds of millions of views
Damn
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
sometimes I too feel like I'm a god...😅
you need help
Straight up demonic
I’m not a woman, I’m a narcissist.

You are not God .
I can totally hear the NIN 💖💖
Halsey is a queen. 👑
Mason
why tf people praising her? she deadass calling herself a god like nobody is god under any circumstance.
Bro what happened.. the last time I heard of her she was just signing pop songs  about relationships all the time ..  Now shes fully embraced the DARK ARTS. 🤦🏻‍♂️  This definitely feels like I'm watching a satanic ritual
This song is just not it
Above All Jesus is the king. HE IS COMING SOON REPENT FROM YOUR SIN AND BE READY.2✝️✝️✝️
😍
U are not God
This is sometimes unrespect to say all are god shamefully.
Halsey should play a type of goddess in a lord of the rings/game of thrones movie🖤
Halsey that''s my favorite song i love it!
The video isn't about actually being a god. Its about embracing her pregnancy to show how strong she is. If you didn't know Halsey suffered a miscarriage and has a  disorder which can cause her to never have children. It could also be  about her bipolar disorder,as she says she's a god and then calls herself a problem. Also there's something called a metaphor,go back to literature class and educate yourself before saying things like "This is a sin" or "Witchcraft"
fear Allah
Rebuked💀
This is heresy. Turn to Jesus Christ. You’re not GOD.
Never knew this was related to witchcraft
The song sucks! And it’s worshipping the devil.
Forgive us father almighty, for that we do not know wat we are doing.🙏🏼✝️
Naomi
Everyone saying this is amazing but she’s saying I’m a God ????? What is wrong with people
Not me repeating the song coz I'm a problem
Y’all honestly call anything art these days…. This isn’t “art”. This is witch craft and satanic.
Were you Aphrodite in a past life? Like, seriously...I get that vibe.
Halsey we all agree you are more than a woman you are more than a God you are a blessing a angel
Trent Reznor brought me here. Trent says its good I do not question the MAN.
Idk I feel like this is witch craft
No ur a regular person not a god humble yourself
My complaint is that this song is evil! Totally Antirelegion no relegion believe this bullshit is better from this because bullshit is real ITS JUST A BIG LIE AND ALSO STANIC!
She’s pregnant! Omg!!!❤️
What a shitty song!
🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄👎👎👎
You are not God
This is just fuck up
Ariana Grande: God is a woman Halsey: I'm not a woman I'm a god
Art? All I see is witchcraft.
Demonic video
Why did somebody just erase my comment? ❤️🧡💚💚💙💙💙💜💜💜
if a women gives life to another, she is not a women. They are a God.
she is so beautiful...I'm jealous lol...nah I just wish I could be like that
Is your baby a finna be a smoker though
Fire 🔥🇰🇪
Damn her mouth she isn't supported to mention that she is god
this should be a show
Love her but isn't this blasphemy
Multiple personalities is a bitch.
Wonder if she feels any different about those underage kids she touched without consent now that she is a mom.
wowwwwww   halsey.......................sarangheo........
Aşk kadın ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Hasley is very byuty god
Where's the movie???? I need it
You knew that eroticism would cover up the terrible music.
Efsanevi! Bayıldım :3
Worst song ever from lyrics to music arrangements
This song reminds me of Ellie Goulding's Halcyon Days & Lights album, especially the production.
Heard this on Naomi just now and it hooked me. Now I learned it was produced the legendary Trent Reznor and now it all makes sense why it spoke to my soul. Not really a Halsey fan but I fuck with NIN any day of the week. Really cool collaboration here😃👍🏾
Is it a movie? It's well directed! If it's the movie what's the name of it?
I watched it on hbo max yestarday and was cool 😋😋😋😁😁
Bunu sevdim ❤
wowww this girl has such a power!!
I hate that I like this. 😒 I’m an old industrial goth. Reznor was a God and when I heard he did a collab with this mundane pop start I was like uhhhhhhhh wtf?? But I don’t hate this. Damn it.
I love this song and the film was amazing, but can someone please explain to me who the hell was the “red” version of Lila in the film?
halsey>>>>>>>
Y’all see a motivating music video with meaningful lyrics but I see feminism,titties and simps in the comments
Vote for Eminem in rock and roll hall of Fame 🖤❤️
Have no idea how I just discovered this track last week.

Okay so now I'm a little annoyed. This music video clearly features clips from "Girl Is A Gun" and I thought "Halsey said this was shot like a film - so why would we be seeing clips from "Girl Is A Gun" in "I Am Not A Woman I'm A God" since the former clearly takes place before the latter - until I checked the tracklist, and it made sense to me.  The music video for "I Am Not A Woman I'm A God" takes place at the end of the story. It's at the bottom of the tracklist. Meaning that they spoiled or unintentionally sabotaged whatever artistic experiment was taking place here: they spoiled the ending of the story because "I Am Not A Woman I'm A God" was selected to bring in album pre-sales. They didn't really care about the story at all.
._.
SPOILER ALERT! She is a woman, and not a God.
i love trent!!!!!!!!!! trent if you see this sir are a  GOD!!! and halsey fall that man!!!!
Goddess*
The best gacı ya💜🇹🇷
There is no God but Allah
Wasn’t she the one who got mad and called out Variety magazine for not using nonbinary pronouns after she gave birth ?
Halsey is getting me through some hard times
I am woman I am God✅
Damn, this is good.
I KNOW This is a song but if you have no religion so that's right for you but Your fan's have religion so plzz don't call your self god!!
Great song, but where are her eyebrows?
"stupid"   what a stupid words. We are only the Humans, not a GOD
I listened to this song daily due to the title reminding me of my wife, whom just birthed our 1st child and was working full time to support me as I navigate my way through medical school.  She fits the title so well, I am so proud of her(I am not worthy haha).  Thanks Halsey and NIN(basically) for this wonderful piece of art, not just this song, but album as well.  Keep trail blazing.  This will be remembered, other high charting hits will fade.  Time is kind to progress, which this represents. I hope you receive your grammy, but your real trophy can always be the genuine art that motivates and inspires.

Dancing with the 👆
Where eyebrows
Interesting lyrics.  She says she is a god but it is in lowercase and also she calls herself a fraud and a problem.  She is going through an identity crisis and cannot see herself as she used to (as a woman) but only as a performer (a god).  Her main concerns are her authenticity as an artist and her overall effect on society both of which she feels are inadequate so she calls herself a fraud and a problem.  That's pretty humble for calling yourself a god.  3/10 play "you should be"
Girls from Passiflora
Once demon claim that he is a god and then you. So i just wanna say shame on you.
☎️🎚are you going to help me?
This song is so sexy
“i loved the fact that she embraced her pregnancy through her art!”  not rly, she’s just trying to be “cool”, all american celebrities take photos pregnant, it’s like a strange ego american thing
Ultra legend seeing this in 2022

WHEN YOU SAY YOU ARE GOD . THE FIRST THING IN MY MIND WAS THE MEME : WOMENS!.......... HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
GOD IS GOD NOT MEN OR WOMEN . THIS IS BULSHIT TO SAY THAT YOU ARE GOD . GOD IS GREATEST WHO MAKES EVERYTHING SOME ARE HIDDEN SOME ARE NOT. I GOT PITY ON YOU. WHAT WILL YOU  DO WHEN GOD ASK YOU : SAY WHO YOU ARE .
Ariana Grande: I believe god is a woman  Halsey: I’m not a woman I’m a god

Wow!
Heard this on naomi last week had to come listen to it again 🤟🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'll hold your hand even when the lights are off .
. i will be your friend .
The layers to this song .... its just fantastic to listen to.
Nah I'm the God it's not fun I promise... No one wants a curse like this🙄. Infinite knowledge. Infinite being. Time gets old real quick. Infinite fault no matter what. You gotta be your own vengeance. Your own karma. You punish yourself.
Up sis

She is telling truth of a women she is right
Oğlu büyüdüğünde bunlarla gurur duyacak
I will never understand why women dont rule the world... We literally make life
I just knew this bit sounded so familiar! It sounds exactly like Gold Dust by DJ Fresh. I love Halsey, it's a great hit but I was surprised there's no mention to the original.
Anyone here after the show Naomi?
🔥🤘
FINALLY found this song! I’ve heard it at work for months and it’s drove me crazy not knowing the name so I could look it up. I love this song, the beat is sick!
I herd this song on a til tok and the beat is fucking undescribable with earthly words and its been on repeat
Her voice is a bit unbearable for me, but it's growing on me now. I respect her songwriting and themes, and the instruments By Atticus and Trent is just ♥️
Is that’s what passes for “alternative rock” these days.....
🌚💗
I can't stop listening to this song I'm in love with it
I love how all the religious people are so angry😂. Lol y'all can stay mad😁
JustLove🤍 Everytime you catch me like its a storytelling. Listening to every single word. 💙
Why the hell did I watch this at night. Now, I am afraid to sleep.
sinful song but the instrumental is amazing
Perfect 👏👏
I've been a frequent listener of Halsey's for years now, right back when I had all the albums but thought Halsey was just the band name. She's a superb artist & Trent & Atticus are legends. Whata sublime team they make!!!
The divine feminine is here ✨
I love her smmm
amazing🤍😭
My god is ALLAH
1000 times dislike......the title of the lyrics is all shit.....the holy scripture says dnt take god's name in vain...whats wrong with you people ??
Eu amo como ela sempre entrega muitoooo
Ahhhhhhh✌🔥very good
There’s only one God. Praise Jesus Christ our Lord and savior!
What is this new photo

Klip aşşşırı iyi.Yine her zaman olduğu gibi mükemmellik yaratmışsın HALSEY
Divine Feminine at its BEST! A Masterpiece all the way! On repeat of course... 🎧 I am not a woman I'm a God...🤩💜🎧
I'M GOD
Every day I've got a smile where my frown goes A couple bodies in the garden where the grass grows I take 'em with me to the grave in a suitcase Maybe I could be a different human in a new place Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So I'll stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already Every morning, got a hollow where my heart goes I never listen, but I see you with my eyes closed I know you, I remember from the grass stain Maybe I could be a better human with a new name Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So, I'll stay right here cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already I'm ready to leave it I'll go when I feel it Got caught both hands on the smoking gun I try, but I need it It's hard, but I feel it And it really does hurt when you love someone Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So I'll stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already got one
i would relate  more if she sang  “ im not a Mortal  , im a problem “  “im not a legend , im Thought”
Joyita
She's so beautiful.
I'm an old head who has checked out of modern pop, but getting the current NIN team on production turned this into a goddamn masterpiece and I AM HERE FOR IT.
Her music speaks to me I love you 💞
Vile blasphemy.  God help us.
Halsey gerçekten bir tanrı gibi mükemmel
Wow! You go girl! QUEEN! Fabulous! Stunning & Brave! 🤣 But for real: Terrible lyrics, horrible visuals, but kickass Music and good video production. I`ll give it an 4 out of 10 for the music alone. Dear pregnant Women: Dont give Birth while lying on your back. It only makes it harder. Just a safety tip.
Awesome song!
🖤
Ariana : god is woman Halsey : I'm not a woman , I'm a god
Goat
This should have more likes,more views
This is complete blasphemy, idc if it's symbolic or not you're not a God you are a person, the only God is the one true God of heaven, earth, an stars. I pray for your repentance before it is too late, woe to those who think this is ok.
Brb gotta go get this tattooed
かっこよ
I would love to find out the budget for this music video. There are more elaborate locations and sets in this one video than a Lord of the Rings movie.
Mantap
You are not the god😡😡😡😡
This cover of Rain Paris is amazing xD
I know she's pregnant, but it looks like she got a boob job 😍
0:53-/intro slosh slush/
1:42-/intro туше slope tip/
I Like this song
0:30-/intro heifer collapsar ловушка 22 trap 22 catch-22/
Sounds quite repetitive but the background sound is good
I thought God was a Woman
Congrats on the pregnancy, goddess
I love her!!! She helps me embrace my feminism
Wowwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!
There’s only one God.  it’s the God of Heavens Armies.
Seek Jesus. Repent for your sins.
such a bop!!
Me too!! WOW WOW WOW Womb-Man Roaring "GOD"
this song radiates some big enby energy
What a waste of good producing, she sings the same four notes. Even the lyrics r cool. Singer is so sleepy and boring
your god is a rat. rat's god is a cell. its god is a god. god can rule the creatures by their powerful love not anger or hate. if you don't, you will lose always.
Listen to revers music it have Black satan massege she is elominat we knowwwwwww ‼️🚫
She embraced something that hurt her like a F•cking boss, endometriosis is no joke and it hurts people like hers! She is a complete boss! She rules feminism in music. Embrace the kick-ass women because Halsey gives a the voice we want! Rule on Halsey!
💖💖💖
With the name of ( Ali ) You Are 🙏🏼
Lilith song 😱
This would make an amazing movie.
This film is so iconic
Wow...
Muthisssssssssssssssssss🥰😻

This had to be awkward to film😅
At this point, I dont even know what the hell im watching anymore.
Every day I've got a smile where my frown goes A couple bodies in the garden where the grass grows I take 'em with me to the grave in a suitcase Maybe I could be a different human in a new place Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So I'll stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already Every morning, got a hollow where my heart goes I never listen, but I see you with my eyes closed I know you, I remember from the grass stain Maybe I could be a better human with a new name Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So, I'll stay right here cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already I'm ready to leave it I'll go when I feel it Got caught both hands on the smoking gun I try, but I need it It's hard, but I feel it And it really does hurt when you love someone Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So I'll stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already got one
THIS!!!!  Don’t really listen to the radio BUT I LOVE THIS SONG AND THE VIDEO IS LIT!!!!  And the beat is INSANE!!!! The keyboard!!!!  Just downloaded this!!!!
Very good sound collab with Trent. Super sound that reminds me of sinking in sound and becoming the song itself.
Muslim people don't listen this song because It's Haram for Muslim
Why women think they are a god(dess)?
Essa música é tuudoooooo😍😍😍😍😍
A melhor música do Álbum😍😍 eu amoooo💗💗💗💗
If healing is dying, yeah I guess u got a good point, cuz here n BALTIMORE,death is claiming Soo many
Wow good 😍😍😍😍😍😍I love this song
Nice phrase for good feelings. But realistically: She's a woman. Gods can change things through will alone. She's apparently just horney.
Merry Christmas Ashley!
How does this song not have 200 million views?it's super awesome
This song is so good
Музыки здесь нет, но клип эффектный
Creation of schism in the modern day feminine psyche. Making fertile dysfunction for the destruction of the femmine principle, in preperation of. If the creation of this song is for esoteric ponderance, then it rings true and is understood.
😖😖😖😖😖😫😫😫😫😷😷😷😷😷
You good job halsey because you so pretty 😀
Every single shot is sick!
You so perfect my dear ❤
Muslim people don't listen this song..... because Here Halsey say,,,I am not women I am God...And It's Haram For Muslim😓So stop listening this song☺️Thank you 💜
Love ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yea alright. End times.
I like you're song halsey about you is good song 😀
Plot twist: a woman who went to a healing center for pregnant women went there to be healed before birth, but discovered they don’t heal, they TORTURE...when she discovers this, she tries to escape, but when she attempts to escape it is too late...
I just found this album and I'm absolutely obsessed with it... its a fucking masterpiece from start to finish
Ich liebe alles an diesem Video!!!!!
kinda sounds like violence by gimes
2:25 fav part
this gave me a lot of GOT vibes
What a garbage.
You couldn't even stop your boyfriend from harming you and now you're making videos saying you're a god
No entiendo cómo puede ser que esta obra de arte tenga tan pocas visualizaciones. Se merece mucho más. 🥺🤍
Halsey our girl,we love seeing the creativity and we all lysm
What has changed in 4 years
Unmistakably Trent Reznor ...wow

Halsey, what is with the eagle symbolism? You messing with masonry now?
Beautiful lovely 💕😭
El hecho de que Halsey salga en la cancion embarazada y diga que es una diosa y no una simple mujer, bro hace que de verdad lo sienta ✨✨
and God is a women
you re not a God either
This assaults my eyeballs and ears in the most delicious way. Love it.
i swear halsey is a fucking queen
This is trash
if anyone wanted to know where this masterpiece was filmed: 1. Mariánské lázně, spa resort, Czech republic  2. Křivoklát castle, Czech republic  ♥️♥️♥️🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿
love this song!
Do not sin, and pay attention to the speech, for you cannot be God. God Is One. 🇦🇿🕋
I swear they could smear Halsey in mud and dress her in burlap and plastic bags and she would still be one of the most beautiful women ever.
You're a human
Yep...
Sana aşığım
Aşk kadınım
Ender nerde 😂
I didn’t even recognize her… but that voice is fierce!  Amazing song and her image is ever changing … so beautiful
She is bad ass
My Goddess ( ◜‿◝ )♡
I love Halsey. Don't get angry with me.😂🤍
On the same occasion. I'm just a 12-year-old girl. I was born in Kurdistan and live there. Kurdistan is near Iraq. Kurdistan is not a country region but we hope it becomes a country  . And I just talked about my opinions. I hope that each of you will write your opinions so that I can respond and read you in the best possible way. Thank you so far with us in reading my commune.❤️
For example, Islam pleases God with prayer, fasting, and thanks to God for what He has given him. Christians in a other way. The Jews in a different way. Many other religions . I hope no one is angry with my commune because I say that each person in his religion pleases God
I know you don't see that letter, but I want many people to see it. And I know you're a normal person. And that song is not appropriate because the name of your song (I'm not a woman. I'm God) might ask why it's not appropriate? For God is the only one. No human being can be God instead of God. For God has created us human beings, and he has created the world in which you, the gentleman, are adornment and joy. Therefore, it is necessary for every individual in the community to thank God. According to religion, it's different.
You are no thing
J'ai écouté cette chanson 40 fois ,super drive
oh my god this is so good
Shee iss goodd
Slutty music
Just saw that this album was nominated for best alternative album. I’m beyond thankful. Thanks for letting me write some stuff and giving you guys the idea to work together!
Having had certain tracks on repeat ever since the album’s release, I really would like to hear a cover of And All That Could Have Been by Halsey.   I feel like it could have been an excellent bonus track on the album.
You are so amazing you're music is a azing
Olur balımmm gidelimm 💜💜💜💜💜💜
Film out olur mu prensesim 💜💜💜💜
İstediğin bi şarkı varsa ona gidelim
Yiaa nie beğenemedim

Beğencek misn acep :)
İlk defa dinliyorum
Çok güzel bu şarkı yiaa çok sewiom
This song and whole album are true masterpiece... Thank you Halsey 👑🔥
When you've watched the entirety of "if i can't have love, i want power", this song/video takes on a much darker, deeper meaning. I loved the song but after watching her movie, this is hard to listen to, it's so sad. But so true and such a great commentary.
I'm only here because of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.
Isaiah 43:10
Where was this filmed?
Iconic! I was thrashing around throughout the 90's in NIN crowds and now this... A mix of Halseys brilliance and Trent Reznor/Atticus   leaves me speechless
Love the whole album
Started a war wit all beings that could and could not be, I was just trying to say hi to mother nature. Your Def no God u r something so so so much more. Love ur music keep it up. 💯 on board wit this type of jam 👌 🙌 👏 🎶 🔥 😌 👌 🙌 👏 🎶
She said *I'm not a woman I'm god* Very bad
Vou ter que gadar mesmo, essa mulher é linda dms, como pode a pessoa nascer 1 vez, e nascer com toda essa beleza. A música tá uma beleza igual a pessoa que canta🤍
Cool video, thank you.
super song and video = Halsey is a Force of Nature
Love it ,😍 wisdom
I am starting a Free BTS form Millitary conscription movement and Halsey i would love it if you joined my Protest
➕🦅🇺🇸🎉2022🗽🦋🌎🇬🇧👑⭐🦁😎🚬➕ I probably shouldn't tell you how hot you look, either, ' cause you do. We should catch up, really. Forgive me, but, uh... I'll tell you what I'll do? I'll keep you in my prayers.
Can we have a full length Hollywood movie of this? Halsey needs to tell us the whole story.
I was watching Requiem for a dream and the song sound just like the track playing when Jared Leto is carrying that tv table on the sidewalk
anyone else here because of the ad
Beautiful art
Even bigger bass
This feels like me
#TheFansWantBellsInSantaFe to be a single
So what cause I said for her to sing a song about how glad she is to have got an abortion like her last 1 she had to convince everyone she’s pro life and have a baby
I will support you for the rest of my life
I love you the best
The best song was very good
My life
Love youuuuuuuu my heart
Halseyyyyyyyy
Take a huge load of dislikes
halsey you queen
The fact that Lena Headey referenced to it.
Trent & Atticus are ALL over this. Couldn't miss that sound if you tried. They basically turn everything to gold.
She's a witch god
This song isn’t long enough
Im not a woman, im a gawd
SO GOOD...so good...
Apparently god need the guy from nine inch nails to write a decent song
Whatever this is, I'd watch it on HBO - 8 seasons and a movie.
Holy Shit ...😯😮😲🤯 The lyrics of her song is so powerful in this video.
Good
Eww bad song pagal i hate halsay
🔥🔥
Every woman after giving birth 😂
Halzi said I'm asking you this and you broke up with your husband?????
Demons love to be called God, smh.
" I'm not a legend, I'm a fraud"  MY IMPOSTER SYNDROME COULD NEVER ------
You are nothing 🤣
Hahaha but my weed cookies GG 🤣 I've been the ThugPlug in da murder fwtx GG let's get this shit robbing russia hehehshsh give them reggie with meth and Fetanl
First DJ marshmallow colab now nin nice
Had no idea why I liked this song.. (normally not a Halsey fan) Then I saw that Trent Reznor had a hand in it, and it made sense. He's fucking amazing.
It feels like looking at myself through the years watching her different transitions, from hair to emotions and style. I completely relate to her in so many ways and love her so much for making me feel like I’m not alone for constantly evolving and changing.
Trent and Atticus did such an amazing job with the track, and Halsey, with that beautiful fucking voice. I'm so happy to hear Trent making this music
Im a martyr not a problem I am a legend not a fraud 🌠⚡🗽
What a beautiful collab <3
Damn I didn’t know she was one of the satanic free mason types  I’m done fw her music lol
My album of the year
Amezing
💜
This song sounds so familiar. Like another song I've heard before but I can't quite put my finger on it
you should be a goddess.
I LOVE YOU ... HALSEY
استغفر الله العظيم
00.28 (slow motion)

im getting persephone vibes
“I am not a legend, I’m a fraud”The biggest legend move is to deny being a legend, all the while being a legend.
Sifha

Sikumon

No, baby, GOD IS A WOMAN
This is an master peace, mafnificent, probably the best alternative indie song of 2021. Without a doubt.
God??? she looks WEIRD AF and an Alien.
This is more about how power corrupts and all but confirmed by the fascist imagery at the end when we try to become gods the next line says fraud
But Halsey, god IS a woman
love you halsey <3
Congrats
Who else noticed the nip slip?
i thought this deserved an aoty nom.
Grammy nominated. Hope she wins.
0:30 am i the only one that finds the "ding" just... Annoying?
This song and “Love Me” by Lukaz are some of the only two things getting me through hard times, thank god for music! I love you! ❣️💖
She shaved her Eyebrows ewww 😱😱😱😱😱😱🙅
Song name and Song Both are crap
*i guess everyone just decided to come back here today.* . . 👇 *I wish you a beautiful life abundance and health*
Isn't it every woman out there is? ♥
Brava brava
This is such crap. 🤦
You are not a god Man‌/Woman can never be God
I love Halsey but I stepped away from her project don't know why, but I just found out she's nominated for Grammy. I obviously had to check out her recent music, and I honestly didn't expected it to be this good. I know a lot of her past projects but this is truly best new song I heard in a while. Glad I turn in on. ♥️
Halsey we love you.. But you need to know that You're not god so plz delete this song.. It will hurm your image 🙂💔 ⛔⛔⛔⛔⛔
Te amo
Lendária
As a nin fan I give it up to halsey
❤
Song of the year
Goddess silly
The West is getting more and more mentally disordered !
Bad song name girl..very bad name
❤
Tell them girl
Love trent and atticus's instrumentals
She's a god🔹️
Daaaaamn!!! They got her trapped now in a dark demonic place!...fuuuuuuck!!!...she can't escape now!!!😫😫😫
weird-ass name for a song
No angels then, all want be gods
Amzing good job !
You wish you was a god
Such a beautiful song and Halsey killed it 👌🏼🥵🤤
Words cannot describe how much I love this song
Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are the gods
Thanks to Trent and Atticus, Halsey has a new fan! I'm obsessed with this song! Been listening to it non stop!
Halsey be like: b*tch, ı am a god not woman.
Woooow. Very good song
"I am not a legend I am a fraud." I say to you that the best thing to say, is that you are not a God, but a legend. For God is not a woman nor a man. Nevertheless kick ass song because Ariana Grande just doesn't know how God is not a woman.
I love this sound, it reminds me of Goldfrapp. I want to hear more songs like these.
Yenge napıyon 😊
You are not god
You mind asking SWIFT what she's doin'? . . . . Beautiful, btw ;)
Can she please be in more movies!!? Her acting was phenomenal!
Halsey forever
Came here hoping it has made over 100m views 🥲
you are not women halseyy you are a god
We're close to 13M views!!! Cmon y'all
Jesus love you! Seek your purpose ❄️🔥
like her voice so much!
The title is like a cheap version of "God is a woman" Lmao
This is good. Just wondering if Kelli Ali would be better suited for this music.
Plz can you listen to my covers
Stay right here cause we're better of alone
I am not a legend your a fraud
I cant have love then I want Power
Моя Королева
this looks like it be an epic moive
Reminds me of the movie Orlando lol
God esss wish you were here in my mind
Yes yo are a god and I am a planet
Omg Isis and Horace. Ily Ashley
This is art in a whole new level
That is a bullshit
A god that has to sleep at night ,,,,use the bathroom,,,,gets sick and dies one day.   You are not a god because you say so.   Jesus Christ is god
Ugly song.
eh just kinda boring song
Please let us know when your baby is born beautiful Soul 🌟🔥⛈
Epic song.
Halsey, you forgot the muzzle 🙊
❤
*You are a woman & NOT a god*
I missed this?? Wtf
music - 1 , vocal 1  = shit
I can't help but here Ross and Trent
This song really gets through to me because I can really relate to it.
This is so good. And im an old man.
Knowing Trent Reznor worked in this album made me want to listen to it, props to Halsey!
Love it
Lyrics ✨  I am not a woman, I'm a god I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already- Every day I've got a smile where my frown goes A couple bodies in the garden where the grass grows I take 'em with me to the grave in a suitcase Maybe I could be a different human in a new place Oh, I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So I'll stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone Look, I am not a woman, I'm a god I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a god I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already- Every morning, got a hollow where my heart goes I never listen, but I see it with my eyes closed I know you, I remember from the grass stain Maybe I could be a better human with a new name Oh, I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So I'll stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone Look, I am not a woman, I'm a god I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a god I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart 'cause I already- I'm ready to leave it, I'll go when I feel it Got caught both hands on the smoking gun I try but I need it, it's hard but I feel it And it really does hurt when you love someone Oh, I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So I'll stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone I am not a woman, I'm a god I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a god I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart 'cause I already got one
Spoke my mind heart soul out
NIN “Closer” vibes.
I wrote that song
The movie ended horribly, Not pleased.
Fck.... this song is fucking addictive.  I would be dancing and singing this masterpiece all day long ♡
What  is differ in martyr and problem.. I don't get it..
I just want more!
You are not god ..😌😌😌😌
She reminds me of Tori Amos. The Queen.
Is she wearing a wig or something for all her videos cause her hair keeps changing?
☆Detroit Duchess Approved☆
I love it his video its so AWESOME my mom loves it too she liked it since she was a kid
she's back!
Its called goddess if its a woman
I already knew I was gay but this just locks it in....she is a God for sure 🥰😩
this song reminds me of aelin from the throne of glass books!
⚡
Halsey The song is perfect 😍😘
She's a godbecause women bring forth babies? But women only carry eggs they can't make babies without the male sperm which is already a life of it's own without the mother so what does that make  the man. Unless she's referring to herself to a idol God which eve desired to be and lead us all to death.
I’ll be honest this was what I always wanted from How to Destroy Angels, well done everyone !
İnanılmaz 😍😍
This is more like NIN feat. Halsey haha Just kidding this Album is a masterpiece 👌 and everyone approves! ❤
Sounds like Bjork. Any of yall remember Bjork?
love from Azerbaijan🇦🇿
Dude this is a masterpiece
I’m a big fan of Halsey, but after listening to this masterpiece, I’m a whole air conditioner. 😝😝
+++LOVE+++
This is the most delusional shit eVeR 🙄!
You are sooooooo beautiful
Dajjal?
Naaaaah u are a woman
This song is absolutely exquisite. Thank you, Halsey!
LOVED her anyway but when I heard about Trent Reznors hand in this I couldn't wait!!!!!! I KNEW it'd be so dam awesome!!!!!!!!🎵🎶💪👍😊
Me: Jordin Sparks, what are you?  Jordin: I am woman  Me: And Hasley, are you a woman too? Hasley: I am not a woman, I'm a god Ariana Grande: God is a woman Me: *nodes* Hasley: 🤔 Doja Cat to Hasley: Let me be your woman. Woman, woman, woman. I can be your woman 😏 Little mix to Hasley: I wonder could you fall for a woman like me? 😊
You aren’t god , you’re living legend 😍👌
Everyone will not b happy but I must say I always thought that she has a head too big for her body, like she's gorge but I didn't know who she was and when I saw first time I even said oh wow it's like her head belongs to a way bigger body, she's my height, very short but her head reminds me of another one with the same look, Prince, he also had a huge head for such a short guy ,he was 4'8 feet and his head was HUGE, same thing here.  One thing she changed is she put on silicone breasts which makes her better makes her look like a woman and with her big head it kind of doesn't look so big anymore,also hair, instead of shaved head, the best is let it grow and hide as much as possible
No one is going to talk about her obvious blasphemy? This is why we are all going to hell.
Very Optimistic.
The scene makes no sense 😂 so she gets into the water and gets out dry and has a sponge emptied over her head 🤷🏻‍♂️
Why do women keep objectifying themselves??🤔🤔
Whatever
Never thought I'd hear Nine Inch Nails go pop
Her baby is cuter than I will ever be this should be legal ✌️😔✌️
she annoys me but she collaborated with trent reznor and i can't resist liking the music he (probably) mostly created
that NIN grit just is a drug... i can't stop playing this. it haunts me day and night nonstop over and over in my skull. halllppppp
That's the proof that wherever NIN go, they change the rules. Metal, rock, pop and soundtracks....extremely unique and adaptable at the same time. You can recognize their dark sound listening to the first 10 seconds of any track. Love your sound guys, you're the future.
Is this a movie or song
jennifer body reference name
I've been looking for this forever!
Your not a God. Your missing God, God loves you and you need him ☺️
Musica boa...
I am not sure if someone would be offended by this but i smell Lady Gaga
"I'm not a legend, I'm a fraud" with crushing imposter syndrome I relate to this song so hard
I HAD A PROPHETIC DREAM ABT THIS EXACT VIDEO HOLY SHIT-  I WAS THERE IN LIKE A ROMAN BATHHOUSE TYPE THING AND HALSEY WAS THERE WITH LONG DARK HAIR AND THEY WAS PREGNANT AND THEY SPOKE SOFTLY TO ME ABT SMTH???? IDK BUT THE THING IS- THIS DREAM WAS FROM BACK IN EARLY 2020 I THINK??????? WAY BEFORE THEY MADE THIS OR HAD A BABY??????  I PREDICTED THIS VIDEO I THINK IN A DREAM?? what
you don't have the bright light behind, you are the bright light
You just KNOW Halsey is a legend, when her fan base is poetic and more than a few words and emojis. Amazing. Check out the Hot Chip remix, a lil more fast-paced but still Halsey. 😁
Waste my time here ;) . . Thank you for taking it.
Holy sh!t. This video. That's all.
a goddess...maybe
Yeah, no you’re not.
YEEEES!!!! 💙💙
You are not god..
You are a god and your voice is a miracle
some people in the comments taking this title too literally
what movie is this
♡
i kinda get some muhteşem yüzyıl vibes from this album lol
NIN is still alive ...
There again this is just a rip off from Meg Myers ..Little Black Death...check it out you'll see what I mean ...sad
You are woman but not God
what is with this woman being a god trend.
Asik olunasi bir video
I'm so happy to be Halsey's Halseyfan today I love you so much Halsey
Bugün Halsey'in Halseyfan oldum çok mutluyum onu çok seviyorum
I think of Hurrem Sultan when I watch the clip
Halsey at her best.
No ur a boy. Be a boy and stfu.
Trent reznor did a good job on this
Her songs definitely speak to me the way she feels about a man I do a woman
She’s so perfect I just need a real rider like her when I push she pushes back  and we feel each other
It's got the same hoops and whistles as The Social Network soundtrack.. because of Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross :P
Now hashley is an god
Perfect
Halsey: I am not a woman, I am god. Also Halsey being served by women.
Chile I am pissed that this song has not hit raidow
Very nice music.... Cool.... 👌👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍
Agliom çok iyi
Halsey is most definitely a God ❤
Wrong
Love what they did @ 01:17…I wasn’t sure if I went too heavy on the devil’s lettuce and I just went slow mo there for a second; but nope it was intentionally placed there. Frekin’ masterpiece!!
Interesting
песня ахонь
She isn't a god, she is just a woman
this song and video needs to be 6 minutes long
Music is art ..this defines art ♥️
Youre neck youre neck
A lot of people misunderstand this song's meaning
Singers r losing common sense
Showing body parts to attract peoples..cheap
In a world where to word woman is being warped, This song is so powerful
Keep this same energy when god ask you about this
The visuals that start at 1:35 just ughhhh 😩🖤
In islam there is only one god who created the universe and the humans
There is only one god but you are humain
.
Ultimately my favorite song from the album!
Yuuu disgusting! 🤮 the worst👎 video🎥 I had ever seen in my whole life this video doesn't made any sense it's just showing her body that's all nothing else chihhh I feel so awkward saying her a girl cause. I don't think so even the lyrics sometimes don't make any sense I don't have any comment💬 for this sh*t video...!
love u Queen Halsey
who else is getting those "welcome to my vagina" ads lol
Ur not a god just a women in her period talking sh##t
Not*
Halseyyy turkeyyyy ❤️🧿
Crap tunes
Ariana grande : God is woman  Halsey : yes
I second that. This album is masterpiece.
Not so long ago, we were burning  Witches....
You can hear the Trent Reznor touch. Brilliant song.
Strawberry shortcake version barata:
Why is this video so strange...Satanic
She’s cute 😌
GOD
Who else came to check out the album after realizing Reznor and Ross produced it? Holy sh*t its powerful as if she wasn't already!
Nobody is a god
Ahhh, tão conceitual. 🖤
Hate how much i love this song... Lmao 34 year old dude singing along in the bar XD
True love! Wow, so moving!
You get me Closer to god

Ur satan 😏😏😏
I would love to have that throne💅💅💅
Finally a song for singing and screaming when you are mad. This is my mental breakdown anthem.
I want to thank you for this song. It's probably going to be one of my most played songs this year. I really hate the concept of gender. This song makes me feel powerful. 💜⚧
*_BOOB ENERGY_*
is this new world order great or what?!
This is one of the best songs I have ever heard
U aren't a God
😲😲😲🤯🤯🤯🧐🧐🧐🧐🤨🤔🤔🤔 Lier There is only 0.0000000001% to become a god! There is no way I am so mind Blown 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯

This song is addictively good. I need to find more music like this.
Auto-tuned crap exposing skin instead of talent. The state of music dismal if this is getting traction.
*Is RaZoRWrAiTh Comparable to Halsey? Let The People Decide!👹🌬️🌋☠️🤘🏾🌜🌛😈☄️🌹🌐🌚* https://youtu.be/sEKqFAlSt64
The production is absolute mastery of the art.
zaaaaaaarrt...
Reznor. Still a genius
👑👑👑👑👑
Ariana: God is a women Halsey: I am not women,I am god
Terrible dead boring song, give mercy to my ears
At 1:02 she looks like Annabelle 😭 it’s scary but amazing at the same time, btw I can’t describe it lol
They made a movie or something? (Short)  Or its just random scenes?
Why it take me a minute to realize that she has no eyebrows 😂
I am literally crying right now, tears of unadulterated ecstasy. The beat, the video, the lyrics, her voice... Best song of the year. My entire body quivers when I listen to this, like something's forcing it to move.
So aesthetic.
So aesthetic
Holzi
Is this song getting better day and day?
This is NIN with her voice
classic driving NIN groove, starting eaasy then push harder, tension and release
Very cool video and song.
Gods dont bleed
So good to hear Trent and Atticus. Vocals are cool too.
No matter the genius of Trent & Atticus it just sound as a US commercial radio song nothing voice of the girl, tempo before i listened the song I watched interview with these 3 and thought humm sound look  interesting then felt so disapointed as just look a f... mainstream song and just sound as a Nin cover layering pop voice nothing more ! No sorry I think Trent & Atticus have better to do like a new NIN album  after great job  done on Bad Witch why they go like this on darkside bizness i really don't know ? Trent worth better than that he's really a genius in rock world!
What else do we need? Keep making the world a better place with such masterpiece🙂
Lilit are you here
Yea iam aproove this song,but women not yet
You are not God,we are coupleand so we are one, Allah huakber
Wow.👏👏👏! I tip my hat to you Halsey. Well done👌
Shameless 😠
You are nothing
Definitely isn't a woman!😂😂😂
I love, love, love the song "Boy with Luv"... that Halsey did with BTS...
Imo Halsey has never looked so beautiful. I'm so glad that she got her life long dream, becoming a mother. I know that this might sound silly to some but my birthday is coming up and this CD is all I want. A gift of great music to me is so much better than any expensive perfume.
Girl got me wanting to shave my eyebrows. 🤔
bu albüme bağımlıyım...
If your a god then why you still on the rag ? riddle me that ?   your a woman put on earth to serve man ! mad from a man ! thats if you believe in any god
💗💗💗💗💗
Disgusting. The climax of feminism. Your are trash.
😭❤️
The face that launched 1000 ships...
El video y la canción está realmente hermosa me encanta todo .
I like halsey but this is a bit disrespectful to say she's a God and offensive to all God fearing people.
Very nice succesful
She married to the devil 😳🤣
Everyone is you 🗝
God is great.☝
You ain’t no god
There is something call eyebrows
Why is it so underrated or feel like I didn't even know that she has a new album or even single ♥️😭
There's so much in this song. I don't think I truly get it all. What does it all mean?
❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️
A just want to feel something tell me where to go ..
Tunne
That base 💕
I AM NOT A WOMAN, I AM A GOD 🙌🙌🙌 YES
Someone tell her to leave her got dang eyebrows alone
Feeling…. Manic
Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are Gods among humans.....
Can I get this as a ringtone
Zara
I agree
Your not a woman or a god your a hollywood fraud
Why doesn't  God is a women , I'm not women I am God???
So literally I’m Fucking a god everyday!
I'm getting hated by a lot of people in my province for being a demi-girl and supporting non-binary rights. Every time someone tells me ''shut up woman'' I reply: ''I am not a woman, I'm a god''
more than a woman...
I think this song is good. Nine Inch Nails!!!!
بچه کم کسشر بگو بیا پایین
This is seriously good.
shit song tbh
Trent Reznor crushed this song. He's simply a genius.
Man this album is all I wanted it to be.  What a great coupling.
Blessed Be 🙌💫
F*ck the revolution.  Let the guillotine eat the cake!
Army like it 💜
You are real queen
My queen .. ♡
Pure brilliance
I Can't Give Everything Away...
Bruh kinda cringe
Just so we're clear - she is a woman. She crys and writes songs about how her nerdy wigger boyfriend wasn't faithful. Typical woman move.
15k ppl do not understand the beautiful ART  behind this.. its deep..
'is this the album trailer?
Chris Cornell is the only God.
For the  people reading this comment, I hope you become successful in your life
Epic video and awesome sound. Gotta go and listen to some NIN now.
Halsey ain't lesser than god she is the queen I love her so much
This is that one lady who was in Scooby Doo, that's great.
My baby💕✨
Yes you are a God
This album is a GIFT.
I was itching for more!💥💥💥
Brilliant song haisley never stop entertaining us we love you 💖🌟💖🌟💖🌟💖🌟💖
This music gives me constant goosebumps
Wow
beat is weak and so low like  sick.  That's like Ashley is back . Nmhhh...
The synth sound at 2:20 reminds me of Kraftwerk.
U know when the song is by halsey its gonna be lit af! And ofc a fking success!! keep slaying queen <3
I love this beat motivational✨
I love the NIN vibe in the chorus. Killer sounds, and Jesus Christmas that chorus is so damn catchy.  Edit: lol reading the comments, just discovered Reznor and Ross are litterally on the track… well there you go, I guess it really does have a NIN vibe.  Just saw/heard this for the first time on an SNL clip last night; needed to find out what it was. Shit is soo good.
trashhh
This vid shows the internet’s compartmentalizations.
Dame dunya oor aghaste de
I love play AC Valhalla to this song 🥰🥰🥰
This is one hell of a soul!!
next britney... *****myself up but can't sing...
THERE IS NOT FUNNY BRO,DELETE THIS SH*T
I like
Uncomprimising art.
I love it.
Jesus! Please will someone take a lawnmower to that rainforest bush.
You're God? My ass
https://youtu.be/pG17ypWnqzo
This whole album is yumihisu's soundtrack and you can fight me on it
❤️❤️
Lyrics r fkng bad
A month later and THIS SONG STILL SLAPS AHHHHHH
Okay was there a lil Sasha Sloan moment? ❤️❤️❤️
🤩 this is like a movie I’m curious about what happens next
Im hindhu .feminism Not problem Jai maata ji HAPPY DUSSERA🕉️🕉️🕉️🕉️ In hindhuism So many women/female version of gods there
Oh oh, empecemos a calentar la hoguera
Well now that shes mkultra’d and the vaxx gave her bells palsey aint much of a god huh?
masterpiece
Hats off to Halsey. Her strong voice and interesting personality make for a thrilling listening experience.
I didn't have a clue as to the fact that you are that horrid at English!
Yo! I am here!!!! 🥀
Loving this song! What a vibe :) :)
I have shiver
They are a god to me already ngl
did i miss smt why tf is nobody using they/them pronouns?
Halsey Always creative 🧚‍♀️💖
I am not a God, I am a man.
came here to report the woke shit
Steady on its ok
So underrated
gives me a NIN vibe, nice
Illuminati vibes.
i just had a wet daydream...Halsey  and Grimes doing a song together 🥰
What a great music, greetings from Poland.
I'm looking forward to hundreds of edits of amazing women to this song
love how it sound
I hadn’t heard this because I listen to “off the grid” music. I can definitely here Reznor’s influence in the song. She sounds great and the song slays!🖤
NIN influence here?
You're a god if you produce music like this. Wake up call when I saw her perform this on SNL. Major props on the Ross/Reznor productions, Halsey has reached legend status in my book. Amazing song thank you!
Can we have a movie with each look?  Breathtaking!
God is a woman.
There are always artists who are not really my cup of tea...until... They release something like this! A true masterpiece of a song.
F*ck, i love this ❤️
one of the best songs on the album
She did an amazing job singing this last week on SNL.
Hino !!!!! 🇧🇷🇧🇷
That s not music🤢🤮
This is Porsha from sing 2? Wow she is really good 👍❤
this song is very nine inch nails and i love it and i love halsey this is her best
حفضته
هسه شلون الغنيه تطلع من عقلي
الغنيه فضيعه بتجننننن
Your my God Halsey💙✌️
😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥👑👑👑👑
لا حول ولا قوه الا بالله قل هو الله احد الله الصمد لم يلد ولم يولد ولم يكن له كفوا احد ❤️ صدق الله العظيم مافيش دليل اكثر من كلام الله
YOU PERFECT OKAY  you will not see (my comment)
Do people actually enjoy listening to this?
Dajali song
Shit production, nice lyrics
Fantastic music !
I would watch this series ngl
0:27
Feeling midsommer vibes 😅
Deusa da minha vida 😍
Love this energy. 😍
Pretty damn good
watch the movie people WATCH IT
No one noticing the sat*anic mas*onic anti*christ rituals?
Tom MacDonald is better
You must not have any other god but me.  4 “You must not make for yourself an idol of any kind or an image of anything in the heavens or on the earth or in the sea. 5 You must not bow down to them or worship them, for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God who will not tolerate your affection for any other gods. I lay the sins of the parents upon their children; the entire family is affected—even children in the third and fourth generations of those who reject me. Exodus 20:3-5  This is blasphemy against God because we are not OUR OWN GOD!!   Please turn to God please and REPENT! ❤️
I’m a woman, I’m a punching bag, I’m a mother, I’m a survivor
How is she a God?  No this is so wrong.  This world is crazy.
I know this has been said b4, but this song would have been the BEST FREAKING song for the main song in the movie, "Jennifer's Body"!
There is only one God
I freaking love this lol
A child singing to nine inch nails music.......so wrong but still a good song...thanks to trent.....who is a god!
Shit song
I am a God Hurry up with my damn massage Hurry up with my damn ménage Get the Porsche out the damn garage I am a God Even though I'm a man of God My whole life in the hand of God So y'all better quit playin' with God
YEEZUS
This woman is very talented
Absolutely horrible. Worst show I’ve ever seen, I had to turn it off. So incredibly cringe, it was like watching a horrible weird musical porno. I think a “witch” is the perfect fit. 🥴
So ridiculous
Funcking trash song straight dislike be afraid of allah/god
https://youtu.be/x8fieCwoO44 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bullshit feminist
One of those songs you instantly like halfway through and know it's a classic. The kind that makes you close your eyes and take you to another place. Music is amazing.
This song is disrespect to God and Bible
This song should have been the one titled Lilith!! 🖤🤍
Even a kindergarten kid would know the female 'god' is called goddess. Probably Halsey should just re-learn English vocabulary? LMFAO.
Trust me
Both Marys God's
Song of the Year  💥🎶💥🎶💥🎶💥🎶💥
Love the music and vocals. Great video too.
Nice eye brows
Lesbian. the word you're looking for is Lesbian.
Thanos was right.
Just 11 mL 🥺🙁 this is the best 🥰😍🧿 Let’s go 1 BL💪🏼✨
puked in my mouth - crap more cgi than avatar :S
This video killed me and now I'm  in heaven (or hell). Either way, I'm dead. Play this at my funeral.
You're a god of nothing. Dumbest song I've ever heard. It's sounds annoying too lol like the beat and her voice are irritating regardless of the stupid lyrics.
Last time I checked.. God doesn't have a funky snatch or bleeds every month.    She's not even a good singer, yet claims divinity 😆😆 .. We'll see if her egotistical behavior still stands once she actually meets god🤦🏿‍♂️
Just hearing this and I’m hooked
Somebody needs to tell this chick to get off her high horse
Halsey, love, drop the make up tutorial!
Auto-tuned much?
She really grew on, such a great artist.
Max halsey zekası
I knew Trent Reznor had something to do with this song!!!
I am not a woman,I'm a guy!
Cringe
Yah our girls
Wow
Omg
Only God can be God... Personally I think this song is horrible... But who am I to judge..
My dream would be to perform with this god 🙏 xxx
I got goosebumps 😍
I don't like Halsey
Yeah our girls
I was a freshman in high school when Pretty Hate Machine came out and I've been a fan of Trents ever since. I've you've never heard Pretty Hate Machine you don't know anything about the music in this song.
Im responsible for aprox 1m views ❤❤💯👍
Sigh seruisly
Forgive me, do not say that you are a god
I LOOOOVE THIS SONG!!
NIN and Atticus seethe through this... What a masterpiece.
I hope this pop music over industrial beats becomes a trend
Şarkıya bağımlı oldum💜
They hide the truth in plain sight
absolute PERFECTION
Halsey this is blasphemy it’s not too late
Another rich a hole that thinks they are a god…
Ahoj, Sáro xd
00:53
bill,  there is ariana and halsey in a pool i cant drink it
well this was underwhelming
I love Halsey's all songs because Halsey's songs perfect like Halsey❤❤
Sorry, I am repulsed by the sight of mutilation by ink. It pains me deeply, I don't get it. I'd scroll and move on, but more and more people are doing this to themselves and I find it horrifyingly unattractive. I like closing my eyes and listening to her being accompanied by Lindsay Buckingham- can't look at these leper-like concentration camp aesthetics.
The combined talents of Halsey and members of Nine Inch Nails (Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) have created a work of art. A true masterpiece.
Come back after a month but I think it supposed to be over 100M viewers but whatever I like it & that’s enough
I mean, as a 36 year old guy - this song makes my inner self bow to the power of a woman. Whatever struggles you face ladies - you've f*ckin got this, right?!
I love this woman sooo much! She's a god!
Who’s gonna tell her?
Nauzibillah
❤❤❤
wtf is this u aint shit halsey
I could hear the Trent reznor vibes straight away with this one
She is pregnant still works so hard wow that's so impressive ...🔥🔥 People sitting at home watching because there's no work to do telling this song was not good that's too impressive 🔥🔥
What a messed up song...
Flop
Who  see hailsey because of bts 💜💜💜💜
So happy to hear NIN is back ,over due! Miss them noises they bring 💀
halsey shaves below the equator to look like a younger.
You're not a god, you're a spoiled brat.
Heard her on SNL and I am here..WOW
I’m obsessed with this song and video 🤍🖤🕊
Allah is great
I fucking love you..like a lot.
Interesting, not even listening to it. I paused the ad. Everyone who commented on here may hate my guts, but if any of you are Christians then remember liking and supporting “worshipping” this song, person, album is a unforgivable sin called blasphemy. I respect no one who calls themself “God” “a God” or “The God”. Choose to do what you want, anyone who reads this comment and then ignores it commits blasphemy as well.
Freakin horrible
There is one god , Who created you and created the whole world.
So much NIN in here! Nice
you are not god what the fuck you Said? We have one god ALLAH achehadu ana la ilaha ila lah wa achehadu ana mohamed 3abduhu wa rasuluh🤲🏻
More daddy issues.
She really is the god✨✨our queen 👑👑
There is no God but Allah
Living legend halsey
But Ariana said God is a woman
Here after snl 😻
https://youtu.be/HoZvvQXaGDQ 할시 고생했어요.... 잠시 영상보며 힐링하세요... 후회없는 춤 노래 우주최강입니다 ^^ ㅎㅎㅎ 화이팅
Army will stay with u forever 💜💜 purple u!
it's your opinion but your muslim fans have it and you said there is a god in your song. we muslims don't like any being to put themselves in the place of god and i think what you are doing is disrespectful to us. It is very sad that an artist who speaks to the world behaves like this :(
markét galuszkova
Fun fact: If she isn't a women, than she is a trans person, right? Lol
Song of the year.
Masterpiece
So evil this song
She is a goddess
Just got back from hearing this song for the first time during tonight's live SNL performance. You are seriously top tier, Halsey. 💚
This song is amazing! I just saw Halsey sing it on SNL!
How am I JUST hearing any of these songs?!?! Halsey, baby, you're a fucking QUEEN
Ok I didn’t like her “movie” 0:28
SNL brought me here. Damn where I've been, this is 🔥🔥🔥
Ohhh
So Halsey thinks she is a God?
This album is EPIC
I am not a man, I’m a drunk
I was your fan before but since you mentioned You're a God,Its better to quit listening your music. God is my everything.You can do whatever you want. But you play with God. That's a big mistake.👎
My girl so perfect 🥺💜💜
🔥
The concept is so pretty
.
God? With this run-of-the-mill crap? Not exactly.
OMG it's really perfect song 😍😍
Hbo
It's Crazy how many people go back to this everyday. This song is legendary
If you ever feel stupid then remember the people who disliked this masterpiece
Admiral Halsey notified me, he had to have a berth or he couldn't put to sea, I had another look and I had a cup of tea and a butter pie, Butter pie? The butter wouldn't melt so I put it in the pie. Hands across the water, water, Heads across the sky.
Still loving my girl
Get it Halsey
the song is sogood that it shaved Halsey eyebrows
You can do it Halsey we all are with you 💜
Thats a very dark mode song
I think these are the things people say about her… I might be wrong. English is my second language so I’m not good at getting metaphors BUT this song is one of the best from Halsey.
What did she said, She is not a woman, she is a God! 😡😡 Oh My God, astagfirullah 😦😵
This song is 🔥🔥🔥
This is awesome
If you see the movie all the songs from the album hit different 👁👄👁
I’m a God
I am not a woman
After all I must say that she is unique.
Yessss you are
Restoring the divine feminine with this Mistresspiece song & video :-)
what the fuck is music video
THANK GOD 🙏
💓👑
With Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross at the helm , you really can't lose. Another great female fronted Trent Reznor project is How To Destroy Angel's
You'll burn with the rest of them These fools think their master gives a fck about them  Here's a suggestion try getting your soul back Here's how Repent! Here's something you and your master don't get He don't have or can you give wat not yours And here's a question who created you? He's your owner as well as your master owner So? That means you worshipping a false prophet instead of God  Your rebellion is juvenile
Hey checkout my  song FROOT LOOP!
Hey checkout my  song FROOT LOOP!
Reminds me of Rock  art
Anyone watch the movie she made? It's really good! This girl has been giving me chills! Halsey is a genius! 😍😍😍
I love this song makes me feel so much.....
After watching the handmaid's tale I can't help feeling this track would of made a brilliant trailer for season 4
true
Oh Trent.. This is so you man... so 90's.. Thank you.
She is the only true artist now a days truly adore her 😍😍
Listening in loop 😣😣❤❤
❤️
I really hate you ✌✌✌✌😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
Sounds alot like grimes song. Violence.
A great song to listen to anywhere except for Pandora
That was unbelievable ❤
your not a god .
This song is a banger and deserves being a hit 👍👍👍👍👍
God bless Trent
ameeeii
Halsey sempre PERFEITA! 😍
This video blows
the whole album really fit into haloween atmosphere
Lol I'm not a woman I'm a fraud I'm not a god I'm a legend 🤣🤣😂🤣😅😅🤣
A wha? Not mine
2:30 👌
https://youtu.be/g6mDSHAfa4M
God has a YouTube channel
ههههههههههههه
اشهد ان لا اله الا الله محمد رسول الله
This album is in oppostion to Halsey`s previous music. It`s like driving a Ferrari instead of Toyota. I absolutely love it!
Yo, you dropped your eyebrows
army here. we stan her
No matter what happens that's the lesson 💯💜 ALWAYS CHOSE YOU😇
I thought trent reznor song? I was right I guess
https://youtu.be/PUpaGKUDZR8
woman moment
Feels like another nin track phoned in. Although slurred replaceable hip-hop voca!s this time. Sorry not sorry. Some people can eat for life off of cashing in on being a woman, the rest of us just have to starve. Good to see men still bank off of modern politics.
So said it in simple that God is a Woman. 🌚
Piss
Not exactly.
정말 타고난 목소리를 가진 가수.. BTS랑 또 다시 콜라보 했음 좋겟네요..
You really can hear Trent Reznor in this song
할시 멋있어요💜
Great fan of Nice Inch Nails, they have done a fantastic job with this song!!!
No your husband is lol
😻
*kneels* 🙏 *worships*

Yea I believe in YahWeh.
Wow this is music to my ears.
I love you 🇧🇷♥️
Música incrível ❤️🇧🇷
Halsey sua linda ❤️🇧🇷
Disgusting.
Everyone you are not a god you are a queen and this is how it is in heaven except you don’t feel pride. Only one god and that is Jesus Christ. The devil will do anything to keep you from god don’t make a god of yourself have A blessed day
U are not a woman ur a it lol lmao okay IT so trashy
Meu deus ela é muito linda
ALBUM OF THE YEAR. FIGHT ME.
Fav song in the world
This track is pulling me, it's like im about to get suck in by a vacuum machine but its not a vacuum machine, it's Halsey whos sucking me in. Thumbs up.
This song and “Love Me” by Lukaz are literally the only two things getting me through these hard times, thank god for music! I love you 💜
با عزوتي لbts بس
i love this musicc
Let's all celebrate mediocrity. Wooo
“Love's a spell created by mortals to give their females something to play with instead of power.” -Beautiful Creatures (2013)  This shouldve been the opening line to this album. Halsey slipped! 😂
Scared of being a mother past fear 💯💥💜 Halsey is a Goddess 😇
nin and Cobrah should hook up to make an album. That would be so badass.
Amo tu belleza 😍😍😍
This shi actually slaps
چ مریض گونه :////
💜🙏🏻💯✔ God/Goddess
i can’t stop coming back to this……
Demonic
💖
Powerful🔥🔥🔥🥰🥰🥰
0:28 Hmmm. I'm love that part uwu
This song and this album deserve some grammys😎
https://youtu.be/dtdXC7AOBt8
The ELITES and people in hollywood think they are Gods. That they will live forever..lol. EVERYONE needs to WAKE up and see what's really going on!
Amo demais essa música, o clipe, o conceito,o mergulho emocional 😍😍😍😍😍
OMG very beautiful ❤️💞
Love U❤🇮🇷
This song sounds like Claus Larson or Martin Gore produced it. That's probably the highest praise I can express.
The queen has no friends ☺️❤️❤️😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
🔥
Awe friends ☺️☺️☺️❤️❤️❤️😀😃😊😃😊
Guys there is one god not many gods that god create you to be alife and you doing that bad memes pls delete that video bc you this meme polytheism pls delete it bc that meme is bad iswear to god god alone is not a partner💔
yeh thats what the elite think. and everyone else is below them.
God  don't get pregnant! Ok don't get pregnant 😉😉😉
I shaved my eyebrows when I was younger too
Beautiful this is real people messiah / Jesus Christ/ Isa died . Bc ago
I'm sorry, despite it look pretty and the music beat is sick. but the general idea is stupid
:28 in and......you managed to sneak a nipple it to your video on YouTube and getting 11 million views with no one bats a eye....bravo!
Eve thought she could be a god, and she was banished from the garden. When will humans ever learn? We will NEVER be God. Jesus is coming back soon, and it's no wonder all the celebrities think they are gods. Full of pride and nonsense. Unless you have gone to a different galaxy, or unless you can form something out of nothing with your hands, YOU ARE NOT GOD. WAKE UP.
I here x Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross!
i do love her music,. but 10 milions wies  since august is an mazing feat. i do have strange tastes in fact of musis but halsey disapoints.
Definitely got some "The Cell" vibes from this with the collar and make up.
You will never be a GOD!  Sorry but so true, all of you HOLLYWOOD freaks!
idk what movie this is but where can i watch? love it lol
Such a confidence booster <3
OMG
Here I am, a 32 year old man, wearing my Slipknot-Tattoos and a Soulfly-Shirt, yelling "I am not woman I'm a god!".  Awesome.
0:33 Is that her ass?
Amazing 😍💕💕👍
I love Halsey and all but the music is too NIN. Its like Trent just keeps recycling the same old same old on every single production he is involved with. Its all the same exact synth patterns and 80s recycling he has always done. How do people keep buying the same song and same album over and over and over again from him? I mean I get that repetition is catchy but come on! ZZZzzz from Trent but always have respect for Halsey.
If anyone has the time n is willing to check out my music videos it would mean the world made them myself and I’m an independent artist the struggle is real any support is deeply appreciated 💕🧚🏼‍♀️
Hamileyken bunu kullanması bana etik gelmedi...
Ayyyy
Listening on repeat ✨
I only heard this yesterday.... its on repeat ! Its mind blowing!x
Ok this is her best. Thanks Trent
Cancelled.
BTS watch this 🌚
Beautiful ❤️
Another great song
What a powerful concept. She's almost Elizabethan, but instead of being married to England, she is married to her own divine, feminine power.
Superior la reina Halsey. Y si, tú eres dios. 💕💕
This song and “Love Me” by Lukaz are literally the only two things getting me through hard times, thank god for music! I love you  ❣️
💢😃✳️☢️
You must be born again. In Adam all die in Christ all live. Don't follow the satanic lie "you won't die, you will be like Gods knowing good and evil." Yet the died and there vanity and pride corrupted them. Don't follow the patterns and course of this evil world and evil music industry. If your friend walks towards a cliff to die are you gonna follow? Don't be bewitched and weak minded... Repent and believe Jesus died for you sins and strive against so and don't use his grace as a license to sin.
No, you are just a woman.
NIN vibes
This song and “Love Me” by Lukaz are literally the only two things getting me through these hard times, thank god for music! I love you 💜
Don't take the religious side, please She means she's God, she's a powerful ruler, and only one can beat her (I love Halsey)<3
This would make a great movie! 🍿
Me gustaa la cancion  La escucho desde que la vi con bts  Super
Sitting here in my NIN shirt with my green hair, absolutely LOVING this, why shouldn't you be your own god, if it helps you get through the day and keeps you sane, then do it, be it. FIERCE
With the title I can’t believe I like this song. Thought it would be some feminist woke shit
https://youtu.be/HhfTd5hfnuQ
This video hits different after the movie😱
Song of the year i fear 😳🤩
._.
Olá
We are all made in God's image. So the humans have to undergo surgery and do things to their face. So its harder to look human. Natural. Harder to Remind the demons of God. Before they can host them. How can you host (its not poses like spiritually pregnant -- think Venom; parasite) a human that reminds them of the same God they hate evrytime they look in the reflection. It's easier for the human to hate/discard their reflection. Then the demon, inside the human host. They need a human host, but don't wanna be remind of them, nor of God. Think the Story of Legion in The Holy Bible.
Kind of reminds you of that song Lean On
Deus nos livra
Its pure MC Donald !
This isnt industrial... this is dark techno.
Especially from a lyrical standpoint, this song hit my nonbinary femme heart hard! ❤
I LOVO U GURLLLLL ❤️
What a song. Love it!
I'm a GOD      Sonic.EXE?
I don’t care where I am… when I hear this song I wanna DANCE!!
The way her tone escalates throughout the song till she screams out her inner voice in the end, is what makes it so fooking powerful and iconic ✨
wowwww it's amazinggggg
Best song 💜
You are not a God, but keep on dreaming😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Ela já fez música melhor.
💙💙🌍💫
How can you possible compare yourself with God. You Halsey are everything but that. If you consider yourself God only because you are mother, or famous or high on drugs are lame to me. How dare you.
This song fucking slaps…slay it queen!
No. You’re a woman.
The underwater shot reminded me so much of cover & book trailer for lady midnight!
I didn't get my line legans but I like if it only black line legans
You are not igod
Why hasn't this song blown up ? This is so lit 😍
CANT I WATCH THE MOVIE UGHHH
Lo que sería escuchar esto en concierto por favoorrrr
Nine Inch Nails Meets Pop
Yasss queen 😌
The beat is speaking to me
mi canción
te amo halsey
this is beautiful halsey you do art
Congrats / Tebrikler (US/TR) to your marvellous new album AND your cutie beloved private happyness 💕! I wish you and your family all the best and lots of fun. Best regards from Neco, Mosbach/Germany 😘👍💕
좋다❤️
Great musicality from Trent love the sound, Halsey's whiney voice and repetitive lyrics with it though...nope...ruined. And I actually love some of her songs, but this one is awful. Also, sorry honey, but there is only one God, and you are not it...you're just a woman with lots of money.
After watching the full film. Seeing these scenes are so weird
❤️
Puiiih! God? More like beech
We love a queen
The BEAT ON THIS!!! ❤️
Love this vibe.
????
Love this !
She can’t be serious she is not a god
Been all halsey,Ashley since badlands
She’s beautiful
In my opinion, i think this song can be a new song used for a new edit with Jennifers Body. In the movie its a scene when she says " i am a God " soo....this can work 😍🤔
This gave me GOOSEBUMPS, I am obsessed
I sense NINE INCH NAILS there. Love the song!
I love you halsey
This woman holds more talent than most of us just hold in our fingertip.
This song and “Love Me” by Lukaz are literally the only two things getting me through these hard times, thank god for music! I love you 💜
not more than black witch
LINDA DE MAIS 😍💘
Stop trying to be god  ~Travis scott 2018
Happy birthday Halsey🎂🎂
Aha...!
Happy birthday ❤️❤️❤️
This... this is fantastic!
Happy Birthday Halsey👑😚🌻🌈
Halsey!! You are one amazing goddess!! I love this!! Soooo very good! Well Done!!
Aphrodite
Happy birthday halsey😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😍😍😍

I have seen a Devil here..
Esta mídia satânica leva muitos com eles para as trevas.
Halsey killed this!
I don't care what anyone says you're not a God, facts.
Fun fact:today (as in September 29) is Halsey's B-Day and it's mine to
cagla adaktan görüp geldik iyimiş
Nicole Kidman’s wig department really gets around.
Escrables port
Oi
I'm lesbian. APPLAUD ME FOR THAT!!!
🤜🏿🤛🏻
Yeah you can hear NIN 'Closer' on this track in the synth! 💖
Trash!
Will her vocals ever sound slightly different? Wonder what parts of this song are stolen too
I think this is the worst song I've ever heard
Çok güzel cooook
This song is always too short for me. I want to visit it like it's a country
2:28 this scene makes me feel so empowered idk why her acting is flawless
Apelativo
Its so good!!!
Inlove with the colors
You can tell Trent Reznor produced this.
Halsey and Trent great collab!
Halsey No man or an inhuman atheist Hijra with disabilities is coming to call himself God😡😡😏😏😏😏
This is the song i heard randomly now I'm really into it.lol. The music is stuck in my head
How can you even compare yourself to a god you're nowhere near a god I liked haisley up until this point how dare you compare yourself to the holiest of holies shame on you
Krank..
Most underrated song
😃
I´m obsessed with this song
Her voice remind me like Bjork
Amo este álbum
We need to salute the person that first suggested a Halsey/Reznor collab!
What does the ending mean, I'm guessing she's watching a fire, someone being burned??
Perfect💜
The satânic ritual
Lol yuck
I am not a woman, I'm a man.
I like her music, but this god complex combined with fantasies of power isn't healthy anymore. It's just too much.  Celebrities are going crazy...the Met Gala is a good example... And the praise these people receive is just as crazy...It's cool to be a fan but you don't have to label everyone as a queen, a king, or a god. These terms have lost their value completely...
The beat makes me feel alive.  Thank you for the reminder.
TE AMO💝💝💝
😒😒😷😷😷😏😝🤪🤮🤢🤮🤮😂🤣kkkk
I’M NOT WOMEN, I’M GOD
Voltem se para o senhor Jesus Cristo enquanto ainda é tempo!!
This song and “Love Me” by Lukaz are literally the only two things getting me through hard times, thank god for music! I love you  ❣️
Which god!?
Que música ridícula
I’m having a songwriting contest to be on my EP if anyone’s interested. Reply for more details or comment on one of my videos. Be blessed 😇
YES Halsey!!!! YES QUEEN!!!!!!!!!!
Nine Inch FUCKING Nails
The lord rebuke you Satan.  God’s is superior  to all.
dude this is worship able 🛐
Is that a NIN sample?!
Love this song when I’m driving on the expressway watching the 🌳, 🏡, ☁️, and 🚙 fly right past me…
Downward spiral recommend to To everyone under 30 or even I know everyone under 30
Give reznor his credit too. Although she's always been there for me when I was depressed.
"maybe i could be a better human with a new name"- this line is too relatable :(
Doja cat : Women  Ariana Grande : God is a women Halsey : I am not women, i am god
No no no I hate this idea
I am OBSESSED with this song. Girl, you are fire 🔥🔥
Song is 🔥🔥
Trent Reznor just makes everything even more amazing. Her voice, his composition....magic!
Sorry but bad and annoying
Her worst era
Illuminati lmao. Hehe. You know those people are saying it rme because they can’t understand these words…
This is what happen when you let Halsey into being a performer for the private shows of the Illuminati.
i cant stop listening to this masterpiece of an album, thank you so much Halsey
This needs to be the theme track for Westworld,.Would have been perfect for S3...
her face changed ???
SHE SMASHED IT WITH THIS ONE
What a Women..proud of You Halsey...one word "Amazing" master piece.
❤️😻
She is so beautiful 💜
she's literally a legend
I’m happy that she realized she’s a God!=)
You're not a god... you're just another baby-making trash heap.
Heavenly Father I pray you keep the person that's reading this alive, safe, healthy and financially blessed. Amen
The people that disliked this song should get their Covid test, because one of the main symtoms has no taste.
I wish the video was better for this bangerrrrr
I'M NOT A WOMAN, I'M A GOD
Love love this song 💖💖💖🔥🔥🔥🔥
God she's soooooo good
THIS IS INCREDIBLE???!??!?! WTF
Any NIN fans here, damn wat a collaboration!
booba
We love you 🫂💜💜🔮
Trent Reznor
0:28
💙✨
I’m not a man, I’m a frog
Only women can give life, pretty godly
The beat dosent go well with the song
😮 Obsessed
LOVE LOVE LOVE IT
halsey... i am muslim I can not forgement that you are God but ... you are a wonderful woman
I love this song
The fact that women can give life to other humans is truly the human flesh of God
BTS army 💜 forever
Imagine being so intellectually dense that you can’t see meaning. Must be an extremely limited and vitriolic existence.     This is badass.
this is like a Nine Inch Nails song with Halsey singing over it. Kudos to Trent Reznor’s production!
Lmao
Halsey is our girl! (Armys)
God is not a woman or a man....God shouldn't have any gender. Stop saying silly words...
How do you talk about God like that.. how do you describe yourself as a Lord or God 🤢👎
This song is simply PERFECT, I will come and listen to it everyday. <3 -Army
0:48 My brain cells hearing: *"I'M NOT A LEGEND, I'M A FROG"* xD
Blasphemous 🗑🗑
SAYY HALSEYYY
Ariana: God is a woman
She's a different vibe, I must say 💫
Crushing Since Day One.
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew (O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones!)
Halsey - I Am Not A Woman, I'm A God (Lyrics) | https://youtu.be/Bm1wKzx9kxc
There is only 1 God that is Jesus Christ.
Ok, In my list of contemporaries singers she jumped from one of the last to one of the first places. Girl, this is how you do music. Finally, I'm stanning.
Can't wait for the remixes
Love this! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzjkRNSZbLk&t=1215s
Even without the vocals this sounds cool
When Ariana said "god is a woman" she was referring to Halsey
Deserve more than she do 💛
she is not God, she is a godess
The Reznor/Ross production value is incredible & signature. The arrangement and synth harmonies are reminiscent of a sonic landscape Reznor built for The Social Network, with a Bjork twist. I hope this is the mark of a sea change in popular radio format. The idea of what’s commercially acceptable has become overtly homogenized; this breaks away from the monotony of “Pop.” Halsey is crushing the quantized generic static with a genuinely bold statement. Remarkable record. Love this cut and video. Brilliant combination.
This video is such artistry 🔥
Ariana didnt lie ♥
Let me be a woman
Love her so much
https://youtu.be/7Azv0G85lh8?t=149 (2:30) one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen
🤮
Halsey es tan linda y con una voz tan angelical ....te amooo
this song gives me gender euphoria as an afab nb >:)
I know this song and video has deep meaning but my dumb ass can't figure shit out. Can anyone please enlighten me?
I heard this on the radio the other day and didn't even realise it was Halsey, I played this on the way to work this morning over and over, Iove it!
💜
على تبن
i love the “i am not a legend, im a fraud.” it resonates with me for some reason
It's so great😍👌
Therw us only one true living god! His make is Jesus Christ!
Blasphemy Much!  Whatever Halsey calls oneself now, definitely not a god,.evil...
Love uu🔥🔥❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤from we armies
Halsey.. HALSEY HALSEY HALSEY❤❤👑👑👑🔥🔥🔥
A BIG SHOUT OUT TO HALSEY FOR BEING THE MOST SUPPORTIVE ANDRECPECTFULL FOR SPEAKING FOR BTS TO BTS LOVE U HALSEYFROM WE ALL BTS ARMIES  LOVVVVVEEE U SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH ❤❤❤❤ you don't deserve the hate u get best of luck we armies bless u and ur baby and ur family❤❤ thank you for loving we armies and bts this means sooooooooooooooooooo much to us❤❤❤thats why we armies call u our girl❤❤❤❤❤
You will never be God your a normal human #no offense
We support you
I love you
bence  kesinlikle yılın albümü. Art- pop' u başka bir noktaya taşıdı.
I love how I noticed this was produced by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross on the first listen without even knowing about it previously. The beat slaps hard
Te amo💜
Basically every medieval movie put into one video that is less than 3 minutes. Halsey knew exactly what she was doing.
Halsey 🥺🥺💜
👑👑👑 QUEEN👑👑👑
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Did anyone else not know Halsey had a baby until they watched this video??? Just me??? Cool.
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
OMG
Preciosaaa, que hermosa canción te amo
God ? 🤣🤣🤣
Original: I am not a woman I'm a god I am not a martyr I'm a problem I am not a legend I'm a fraud So keep your heart cuz I already got one  Me after after 2 beers: I am not a wombat I'm a dog I am not a farter I'm a cobweb I am not a lizard I'm a frog So keep your shart cuz I already got wet
Muito linda música amei 🎶 top 10 👏🏼👍🏼😀😄😃👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🎸🎧

halsey gets like a glowup every week.
I can definitely hear the Trent and Atticus influence. Love it!
Decadence
Travis Scott: STOP TRYING TO BE GOD
Daenerys Targaryen is on the final scene. I think that she´s talking about the roles of the feminine and the judgment of others, generally men.
No you are a woman Halsey . YOU ARE NOT A GOD !
I LOVE you
she don't mean it's God Rather, this is a metaphorical expression in which you mean wisdom, authority, and strength.
I'm not pregnant, and never will be, I'm not even a woman, but IICHLIWP is in uncountable replay
I love you so much my Queen
Halsey is my certainty that I'm not straight
Underrated song!  This is an anthem Deserves much more
Teenage boys are going to love this video.
She looks so freaking good with bleached eyebrows OMGGGGG
I am speechless omggggg
This song and “Love Me” by Lukaz are literally the only two things getting me through these hard times, thank god for music! I love you 💜
Iconic as usual
Halsey is the best girl!💜
Yes, she is god...love u our angel girl 💜❤️
I just one autograph .
That smile at 1:41 made my day.
God halsey
https://youtu.be/G-woEHiGYpU
I AM NOT A WOMAN IM A GOD
Straight blasphemy!
É muito chato né
You are not God, and you never will be. God is not a man or a woman. God is above all things. The God of justice and equality. The most merciful. I hope you will not mock God.
New Waves Pop
Halsey you know that you're not God. God is one And He is Mercy from the beginning of the world. If you keep thinking like that Lord Our God Jesus Christ will destroy and kill you with the edge of the sword with your baby. Not alone.     Look like money throwed your mind to the rubbish box.
And it really does hurt when you love someone 🖤
God is a woman 🙏
Tf happend to her eyebrows
Came here as a army but just fell for this ...wow
my gods she's the most amazing woman. my celeb crush to the fullest and i would gravel at her feet. 😍🖤
This illuminated 😏
(Temporary)... Still love you though ❤️😘
As if...
People only should dress us when we are dead.
Jesus is the only god
Muito bem
🥰🥰🥰⚘⚘💞💓💗
I'd watch the tv series of halsey in this music video
Nobody here talking about Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's AMAZING production! Their contribution is just so 100% them!
Goddess*
This song is my new anthem... gosh is so good, and so simple and perfect. Love you Halsey.
this is what happens when rich spoiled delusional brats make records
Only NIN could make today's pop cool!
It's the true power the most powerful thing in the world to create life then to have it grow inside you it is godly
Not "GOD".....IS A LUCIFER👹👹😈😈
Two words" pure crap".
Omggg I cant get over this masterpiece
We support you
We stream halsey
Eres muy talentosa !!!
So perfect👑
What a song😍😍👌😊❤❤❤
This reminds me of NIN-Closer.
I am not a man. I’m a god.  There, I fixed the song. ;)
15 sene sonra halseyin bebeğinin bu videoda kendini görmesini hayal ettim klipte lan
0:28
😲😯😮😶 WOW
Ahhhhh 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷

HI MOM, THANK YOU.
Halsey never misses this is fire ❤🔥
Hahah
also this is GIVING EVERYTHING
2:48 looks like HP hallway
Crazy like everytime
When will they learn not to mock God
1:34 to the end  👁👄👁 Halsey gave us a movie trailer
wtf
I can feel the NIN oozing from this. Sounds great.
My only complaint is that this song isn’t longer.💫
Awesome that Trent Reznor / NIN produced this albums instrumentals.
halsey literalmente es arte
Everyone is a God of there own reality. 😌
This songs helps me to get over a guy I was dating. He never talks to me. I dont need his attention I get plenty of it from strangers passing by. I love how music is so inspiring and empowering.
A god damn masterpiece
This mixed chick is hot!!
💩
If I can't have real love I want power. 🤟
i love you halseeeey this is perfect 😭😭😭❤❤❤❤
Halsey? Halsey no es mi mujer es mi dios 😿💗💐
“i am not woman, i god” bro i feel that
aaaaa q linda mi mujer 😿❤️
En mi país, fotografiando los mejores paisajes y las mejores playas. Entra para sorprenderte con la belleza de Marruecos.
In my country, photographing the best scenery and the best beaches. Enter to be amazed by the beauty of Morocco

Halsey  lovely girl  💜🤍 Luv u 💓💗
احيه مش كده ياهلزي 🌚
🥲 powerful
WATCHING HER LIKE THIS ACTUALLY GIVES ME SO MUCH POWER
This song gives some dark edm or goth new wave love it!
The only thing that this video lacked is  Jonny Sins 😂😂😂😂
Lyrics are better than the song itself. Lyrics are btw. very meaningful.
the synth in this sounds like an 80' NES game
You aren't a god
Love from india
"I am not a woman, I'm a god"
Clipe podre.
I love Halsey and her Music! But we only Have 1 true God. And He is in us.
Our Woman  Our God!
ما اقدر اطلع من الاغنيه مره فخمه و حلوه 😭😭 The song is once sweet😩😩😩
Is Halsey pregnant? She kept that one quiet...
This song and “Love Me” by Lukaz are literally the only two things getting me through these hard times, thank god for music! I love you.
tombalak bebe
This song gives me infinite goosebumps
Lots or Reznor and Ross industrial vibes. Dunno how I feel about the singer.
i cannot wait lucifer #lil nas x vs God #halsey battle it out who will be the better artist  imean god
ok fake god
lil nas x 2.0 be like
What a Great Song !! 🎵😘👌
Rain Paris made good cover of this song :)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lngO3YvLwjg
This is why she is one of the best-est singers of all time 💖
So powerful
Halsey - I am not a woman, I'm a god what a stupid title  You will go to hell forever then you will discover the true God.
Sorry halsey but this song was bad than I thought now I think cardi b sing better than u😐😕
Idk why people dislike this, this is epic
Padme and the Handmaidens
I'm in tears. This hit me in a way I never expected...
Anyone notice all the pregnancy symbolism in Hollywood right now? This song, Lil Nas X with his pregnant stomach and Drakes new album cover... Hmm..
I've always been kinda on the fence about Halsey. But this track has really got my attention. It's sick, I love it! I'll definitely be checking out the album. Especially now that I know Trent Reznor & Atticuss Ross produced it 👌
🔥🔥❤️
Very good album. I can hear Trent Reznor's influence all over it
0:56 Halsey looks right into your soul. She looks fit. Like it
Yes Halsey is not woman she is god I would literally bow down and worship her in my knees thank you halsey
İŞTE BİZİM KIZIMIZ YA KURBAN OLURUM ÇOK GÜZEL! 💋💘
Reminds me of the days I listened to NIN.
*HALSEY NEVER DISAPOINTS US,you rocked it my girl*
I rlly want to understand the video
Listen to this cover i’m not kidding it’s the best  https://youtu.be/XA2YEHn-A8Q
Best video of the year
Yesssss
Apparently, she doesn’t think hell is a real place of eternal torment.
Hei gas
Coitada, não sabe o que diz, que o Criador perdoe essa blasfemia
I think I would pass away if I saw them perform this live
UFFF EL ALBUM  ES SIMPLEMENTE ARTE 🎶
This gives me grimes vibes and I would respect that Collab! artistically :)
Deus é muito maior. Ela em 100 anos vai estar morta.
how do i watch this movie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1iaRlaMwCw
Ok a god not go to hill  The god is not that size  You are a H  our You are 204   Flip that  You  Flaping  H
😭
Unfortunately Halsey is not a God, that right there is some Blasphemy.
This is better that God is a woman.... Halsey is a Queen ❤
God not have weakness,god not have period's blood like you all...
HALSEY supremacy
this video is reminds me of Elizabeth Bathory lol
This music video is like tombul bebek
wow halsey Halsey our girl, this is AMAZIIIIIIIIIIINGGGGGHH
She never disappoints us . Love her
Who pregnant her? 😂
U r not a woman u r saitan
Tiene el potencial de ser otro hit de Halsey ❤
🧡❤💜💙
became feminine !)
Halsey with Trent Reznor should be forever
Halsey you are indeed NO "god" but a  Wretched sinner. YOU will know that JESUS CHRIST is the ONLY ONE TRUE GOD. [[All KNEES will BOW and EVERY tongue will CONFESS that JESUS CHRIST is LORD to the GLORY of GOD the FATHER PHILIPPIANS 2:6-11]] REPENT and BELIEVE in the GOSPEL of JESUS CHRIST before you end up in HELL, into the LAKE of FIRE which is the SECOND death. JESUS CHRIST is the ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN (ACTS 4:12) (JOHN 14:6)(JOHN 3:16)
Beat and instrumental reminds me of closer by nine inch nails.  But I’m in love with this🔥
Love to you Halsey.
this song is very good!
Halsey has been, and still is, way ahead of our time. We do not deserve her
How SATANIC You are a satanist! You are not a man nore God not even a lady
Jesus is out savior he is lord stop this nonsense this self righteousness
Yengem be gene müthişsin
I love how I can hear Closer to God in the instrumental. Gotta love Trent Rezor.
love it
WOAW THIS IS SERIOUSLY AOTY
This song is just not it. This is 2021 man. Bruh.. gonna swipe to the next song now
No la conocía hasta hoy pero está genial está canción, este vídeo, está artista, simplemente increíble desde el sintetizador, hasta el vídeo y obviamente la voz, este tipo de propuestas es la que refresca el género musical en particular y la música en general.
the beauty of this song makes me cry
bizim gelin
This has quickly become my song of the year. also, the bridge section is fucking incredible.
I freaking love love this song so freaking much thanks Halsey
şarkı o kadar iyi ki izlenme sayısı hayal kırıklığı
The artwork of this album reminds me of Kösem sultana potrait I saw once on the Internet, who ruled Ottoman Empire ♡
Ölümüm halsey yüzünden olacak
Incredible, I love this song and his visual so much
you can tell Reznor is behind this one, her best song so far
I am a woman and i am God.
SIÇICAM COK GÜZEL BU
ok
I've been listening to whole album on repeat ever since it came out, it's MASTERPIECE
From now on you are my god
"keep your heart cause I already got one"
Iam a shame for this song gonna leave you from now
Beyond excellent
When singers get pregnant they immediately think they are some kind of fertility goddesses and make shit like this
I'm a woman. I'm Not a God. I'm a Muslim. I'm Not a Atheist.  The Lyric Of This Song Is Not Good At All. From Bangladesh 🇧🇩
I am not a legend I am a fraud  Ummmm hmm
Woooooooooooooo❤❤ https://youtu.be/Ffn3jnn_jn0
This is pure art, this song is beautiful and deserves more views
I am not women i am god 💋💋
There is only one GOD
She is veary crazy and 🤢🤮
Man Halsey sounds awful! Why is she famous again?
Only love the instrumental the lyrics are confusing abit...
REZNOR AS FUCK!!!!!   epic
❤️
Me encanta 🤩!!
Pray💌
Me lembra do filme "Duas rainhas"
Halsey is art. Art is chaos.  I can relate so much to that beautiful belly bubble bath feeling,  especially all the mothers out there who are pregnant without a partner by their sides. The times we cried ourselves to sleep, holding our growing pregnant belly and feeling deserted and unworthy of a man’s love….. And then finally after the raw, delicious pain of delivering a life unto this earth…It’s in that moment, that you learn how fucking strong you are. How powerful… A WOMAN, A MOTHER. CREATOR OF LIFE. It’s then that we finally understand how much power WE possess. God chose US to be the vessels of life. MOTHER + HER CHILD = GOD
🖤🖤🖤 BEAUTIFUL !!!!! 🖤🖤🖤
good one..a kick-ass song..
HALSEY LACRANDO COMO SEMPRE
stick your politics....thumping bass , great 80's feel...im in!
Like when eve gave Adam the poison apple, old Holly woods voodoo well gotta make the money someway?? Extortion much?
amazing
I see, sex still sells. :( imagine if a man sang this.
Çok güzel lannn
Suparrr
This entire video is a satanic ritual. Big thanks to Fiona Barnett, Cathy O'Brien and others for exposing the evil in this world!
يا مسلمون اين انتم وما رأيكم باللقطات ال💩
This song makes me fell so powerful
But God is a woman... :/
I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH 💖
Ninguem está acima dela  ninguem !
Isso tá incrível !

She's incredible... Thank you our God
💜 we love you
She has influenced life of millions of beings  *A LEGEND!*
Halsey 💖💖💖
*- احسني ادمنت .*
l love you so much ❤️❤️🌹
все кто читает, послушайте пожалуста этот трек, просто пацан старался https://youtu.be/ybUZETpTB60
This song basically talks about Wu Zetian, the first woman Emperor of China, and of Queen Elizabeth I. And I love it.
To the person reading this never lose hope there's always something to be grateful for 💫
what is the message / theme of the video?  Doesnt stir joyful feelings for me....
I fucking love this song! Why do I get Q vibes? Like that smiling and walking her fingers over her belly like it's a product. Are they gonna eat its adrenochrome?
Undoubtedly very entertaining, very good. It's fascinating how someone who's clearly a few sandwiches short of a picnic can create some wonderful things.
As much as I love this song and it is one of my favorites, I feel that the song does not have a good finishing. I know I'm totally unqualified to make that assumption, but it's just a thought.
Uhhhhhhhhtryingtoohard!
ohhhhhh !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
where are your eyebrows
lame, she is a hypocrite.  people and their egos
I came here because of trent and Atticus. I stay for Halsey
So Powerful I feel it on a EVERY LEVEL💯👑
DIOS por qué no descubrí está canción antes?
Ive become obsessed with this song omg
🎧💖🎧
I'm 50, and it's remind me the sounds of the new-wave 80's synth-pop, great song....
Congrats on 11m subscribers halsey ilysm this is my first time listening to this I love this I'm obsessed with this song this should get more than billion

Você é uma deusa sim... Agora vai lavar a louça
One of my favorite album this year so far. Thank you Halsey 😍
💯💯💯💯🌍🌍I hope my friend makes it 💯💯j posted his song
Is that Camila Cabello 0:14
she had changed a lot since her debut.
"And it really does hurt when you love someone." Halsey, keeping it real, in every track. 🔥 You are a true Goddess, Ashley. Thanks for taking us with you as you rise. 🖤
👏👏👏
Muito top ❤👏👏
beautiful i fell in love
You no good there's only one good ik it's a song but don't like when you said you a god...... Don't make another song about thisb
LOVE it.
She’s representing a Safo of Greek Goddess! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Halsey, I love your voice so much This song, this MV reminds me of Daenerys of the House Targaryen, The Unburnt, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men, Queen of Meereen, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Protector of the Realm, Lady Regent of the Seven Kingdoms, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons
Thank You for having all types of women....
What's wrong with being a  martyr?.... My son called me a martyr 🤔 at that time I  Was working with homeless people... I didn't have anything to do for myself.

if you see yourself in the mv, promise to yourself: Fashion is only prop to wear, not the main thing makes your name. Beauty stays in all genres, not "public approval". Your whole life is not a standard for "women responsibility".
Feed up with the ignorance its goddess
استغفرالله
WoooW!!!!!
Are you real!?!? Because I'm a big fan of you
Always Halsey - not a woman , a god! ✔
Feminist
Blasphemy.
iot baby
💜💣
I'm a hardcore NIN fan and this song got me bobbing. So cool, really good sound, lyrics and style too! Gotta listen some more Halsey!
The one true God , Jesus help you Halsey...that's is a lie straight from hell satan in Gensis the first lie was satan telling Eve "you shall be like God" self worship...we are fallen and aren't perfect not worthy of worship. We are not God as the Agnostic belief you follow would have us believe..anyone reading this Repent and be saved in Jesus name.
I love u Halsey❤
omfg i wish i could see all the footage they have and edit something waaayyy longer because literally every set up they show looks so freaking interesting yet we barely see any of it 😩
Can't get enough of thisssssssss
All I can say is QUEEN
praying FOR Halsey. JESUS LOVES YOU!!!
you are not A GOD...... that is why you cannot do GODLY things. have you spun the earth into creation?
love u ;)🤍🦋
You’re nothing!! Just a woman!! God is God!
Halsey never dissapoints 🥰 Every song is about me. Oh! the synchronicity!
I tried to do a mix between Closer & this track...The result is interesting ! ;)
this honestly looks like the trailer to some new tv show about a mad queen
Very How to destroy angels. I'm digging the Trent vibes
This is pure art, literally one of the best albums ever released
haha look a object
This is literally my favorite song thank you.
"this woman... will not go quietly."
Halseyyy😫🎀
Wooo tener la oportunidad que Nine Inch Nails sean tus productores es una razón para darle gracias a las bendiciones que la vida te da pues no cualquiera corre con esa suerte.
I love you so much! I'm so excited fotr this future ! beats by nine inch nails.... love you!i I . mean Halsey ! xoxox #Love & Loyalty ...thats what we do this for! I love you Gus !
But… where is this beautiful bath house, anyone know?
Lebih cakep dari hari ke hari

It goddess for gods sake
You believe god is women
carai parece com a Juliete
Feio horrível
Love this song
Can really hear the Nine Inch Nails input in this track. It's a fantastic track, love it.
This song/video needs at least 800 million views
Halsey  love uuuuuuuu more more how is your baby
There is only one God who desires to live in our heart found in the Holy Bible KJV/AKJV. Will Him to win the battle in our minds for our souls. Let’s not desire to be God but to be Christ like. This song is of Satan who fell because of his pride. If only we all asked God to open our eyes and ears to His understanding of His knowledge and wisdom. Learn His Commandments and take note of the Fourth in regards to the Sabbath Day, in relation to the Sunday law brought in through deception of climate change via the dominant minority the Freemasons of the secret religion, satanism in disguise. God created everyone with love so that we may live with Him forever and ever. And God didn’t end sin before it continued to show Satan’s full nature, otherwise we may have said God is unjust. Alleluia
Halsey be humanizing all the  women with a single song, queen💕
Not my god
Trent Reznor en todo su esplendor
❤️
So every woman's clip is sexy appeal. Just tired of so much repetition.
cool but.. what?
Idk why this gives me so much G.U.Y vibes
OHH MY GOD, HOLYY FUCKINGG SHITTT !! THIS ALBUM IS A GORGEOUS MASTERPIECE !! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS ALBUM AND I LOVE ME QUEEN SOO MUCHHH !! THIS IS SOO STUNNING AND INCREDIBLE !! OMG, HALSEY IS A GODDESS !! I’M SOO FUCKING PROUD OF MY ANGEL, ALWAYSS !! I ADORR EVERYTHING MY LOVE CREATES SOO MUCHH !! SHE DESERVES THE ENTIRE FUCKING WORLD !! SHE’S SUCH AN INSANELY TALENTED, BEAUTIFUL, INCREDIBLE AND LOVELY ANGELL !! I LOVE HALSEY SOO MUCH !! ❤️❤️❤️❤️🥺🦋
Wtf
This one track indeed is nailsy good (the modern, Atticus, HTDA sound), but the rest of the album— suffice to say, it didn't grow on me on the first listen, nor did it get me pumped to give it another try. YMMV, as the kids say, I suppose.
AGAHATAN CONSTANTINO. DOS. SANTOS. DEUS.A.FORTALEZA
No ones seeing how ducking creepy this is?
Nobody would believe me if I said that I heard this song before I even graduated hs in 2012-14. ...it was this 45 second clip that I got. Sneaky link if you will. I recall looping it a lot like it was so catchy to me
A trabalhar vagabundo para ficar nadando essa piscina
I LOVED IT 💘 She’s a goddess for sure 🔥
Omg its sooooooo gooooooood 🙏
This is god awful. Reminds me of when you were in middle school making beats on your iPod. Excessive *clap* noise & off beat lyrics.
No one is god .......... god is the greatest ...... above all of us
This some hot garbage
Is this video like a resume of the movie? Cause it seems to me that there's is 2 Halseys: the woman & the god. But I didn't watch the movie (not available on my country).
No just absolutely NO

Halsey: Is this song a bop? Ariana Grande: Yuh
Hey you are loved!  If you need someone, you can count on Jesus.  He loves you and one day he will come get us!  Strengthen your journey and don't give up!  Don't forget to seek help from a psychologist as well.  You shine!  Do not give up.
Where are her eyebrows?
Que lixo e esse?
The most consistently phenomenal artist out there.
Halsey is Amazing
Great job with Trent!
Is it just me or does this give off the vibe of being a song from 2003?
N.I.N. did this great!
i too am not a woman, but a god
🌙❤️
The most powerfull car of god is i am
ME ENCANTAAAA
That NIN beat is way sick. Looking forward to more videos coming out.
You all are going to burn in hell for all eternity, sons of the devil!
♥️
OMG🔥🔥🔥🥰
that brown wavy wig at the start is stunning i want it.
Beautiful video and song
I'm glad I didn't kill myself, now I can listen to this wonderful song
release the movie rn
Amazing
Boa mailane
not sure if she gave credit but this is so nine inch nails - Closer sounding
Amar chelamattom ❤️❤️❤️❤️

your a GOD ?
This is the best song in album
Waaaaow❤️❤️❤️❤️

this bops tho
Did I just watch this? Yes. Am I watching it again? Yes.
Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Exodus 20:3

Wtf has the world gone through to appreciate this garbage
Everything been sexist since day one. Women can never be depicted as a GOD. I DISAGREE.
Seriously your a God?
you're art! Incredible job omg i loved it
WoW! Beautiful job! Congratulations! ♥️
God said in the Qur’an: Say (O Muḥammad ): I am only a man like you. It has been revealed to me that your God is One God. So, whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord
"well played" ~said the alpha male.
Damn Atticus and Trent made this vibe DOPE AS FUCK Hardcore Nine Inch Nails fan... mad respect for Halsey now
eyebrows????
Confidence is a must for her, she has to different.  She has to live for her first, a King worthy of her will show himself!  ☮️❤️😈
Im so proud of my bestie she is a mother 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I'm loving the colab!!
0:42
Love your music Halsey but you are not a god.
There is only one God. Nobody else can or ever will be one
THIS IS THE WORST LYRICS OF NOW EVER HEARD
loved this entire album 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Brave soul 🖤
you are nothing
Luv it😍
ادماني الجديد
الاغنيه تجننن
اللي حاطين دس لايك ذوقهم زباله وتحياتي🦖🦾
My favourite song by her is people disappear here is gone can't find it if a do it won't let me listen to it I'm so gutted
cikamiyorum ki cok guzel
FLOP
This is too good
No you're not a God.
We need now or never scene that’s mythic 💙
I am army girl ♥ love u halsey ♥
wow now everything is about ego!
God ??? 😂
A woman is really a God...Who give birth to a new life 🙏
You will never be a god Halsey
Don't say that you agreed women
The queen came back for her crown
"i am not a woman, i'm a god" they're the same thing, aren't they?
This song underrated
When they place the shackle; the necklace around her neck. To be so adored and revered; yet so chained by that adoration. To be a woman; and a god to so many. She is a true artist. Thank you Halsey,
0:53 Oh yeah, that synth is super Nine Inch Nails like the one in Closer, Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross are geniuses
She is honest.she is the god-
🕷🕷🕷
Really good song
satanic garbage
🐒💩
God is a woman - Ariana Grande Hence proved by I'm not a woman I'm a god - Halsey.
Pelik2 jer tajuk
Wow ! 🖤🖤🖤
Nice to meet you^^ Thank you^^ Good luck with you^^ Halsey^^♡
Yall dumb af this song is about women objectifying and  traditional things effects on  women's freedom
This is all just satanic as crap, you can tell it was directed by Marina Abrovich/lady gag team
Brilliant work all around!!
Being produced by Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor, the music is going to sound really industrial, excellent work!
Poor people, world is ending and you don't see the truth, you don't see God
My Folks Dont be deceived any longer.. everything surrounding you is designed to get you lost keeping you from connecting to your inner self. Wake up. Dont be late. I love you. Mando Boi All Platforms
Music is not fitting.. Like she used a beat🤣
if God is a woman, she is Halsey
INDUSTRIAL MUSIC QUEEN TY NINE INCH NAILS TOO
God doesn't need a bath, a dress & not half naked
SHE IS THE MOMENT AND SHE KNOWS IT <3 👍👍👍
Genius
I just heard this on the radio and was thinking that this reminds me of Nine Inch Nails. Just found out that Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross helped produce her album lol.
2 week 8 ล้าน กูคนเดียวก็แสนนึงแล้วนะ เอาออกไม่ไหวจริง ตัวเมโลดี้มึงนี่ เอา Mode มาขัดตัวเดียวไม่พอนะ มีแอบมาอีก Mode กลายเป็น "ขัดประสาน" อิหยังวะ 555
I bet that
Obsessed with the album
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL
The way she walks her fingers across her pregnant belly in the bath and that slight smirk......it touches me.
stan halsey for actually having cute merch and they’re good quality
Release people disappear here for everyone not just people willing to buy your album multiple times. Your fans have supported you.
1st listen: Wow, another one that has Ariana's philosophy. But how low she has fallen, this may not go too far. 2nd listen: I expected Halsey to release a metal or rock album. 3rd listen: It's not so bad, its rhythm is catchy, it reminds me of Selena Gomez's Boyfriend and a bit of Nick Jonas's Jealous. 4th listen: Wow, "if i can't have love, i want power" deserves more recognition, the album is not bad at all, it's one of her most personal but less commercial. 5th listen: I AM NOT A WOMAN I'M A GODDESS...I AM NOT A MARTYR I'M A PROBLEM...xD
The brutal and raw emotion just transcends
Everything about this song is mind-blowing and mesmerizing af
I've never watched the game of thrones, but this song is giving me game of throne's vibes
Reznor and Atticus did a great job producing the album but they outdid themselves on this song, the instrumental compliments Halsey's fantastic lyrics and vocals like a glove!

0:08 Sometimes its the company that choses to surround you.

This album needs more attention
ASK KADIN YA <3
Worst  song..i ever heard 😒

I thought when I was reading the name "wow a new disgusting shit came out " but after listening I understood that I was wrong this is after giving birth fucking hallucination  I hope you get your right seance back soon 🧠👍
Pretty sure immediately immediately thought of "God is a Woman"
Album of the year. I swear, I was never so inspired by an album
Well she definitely created chaos alright
#BritneySpears
found something new after a long time
Everyone here is commenting what a MASTERPIECE this is when literally it ain't. Aint her best song.
I love how they kept her voice sounding more natural in this song
I really want a video for Easier Than Lying so bad
WOWED
your not a god try again
Can someone explain to me about the concept?
look at yourself in the mirror you will find your self a crazy woman
I believe that you are a God if you don't go to toilet 🪠
vampire witch vibes ❤
Reminds me of the Shy FX Goldust beat 💓
Halsey congcrast on your Newborn child
Halsey you're the best!
Halsey taking music to another level🔥
Huge Nine Inch Nails influence here.. Unless it's the same producer or something :/
This song would be Perfect on the 'The Matrix Resurrections' album!
youre nothing
HALSEY is the real LEGEND ❤️
I'm not a woman, but i love it.
This is the best female album of 2021, Best Concept, Best production from NIN leads, A movie to promote the album, I was not a big fan of Halsey but now, God I'm obsessed with her.
OR SO YOU THINK, WAIT TILL THE REAL GOD WALK ON EARTH AGAIN
Feminist's hailing hasley . . .🌵
wtf is this seriously people just releasing records just for the sake of it. Horrible
Bruh I wanted to watch the film so bad in the cinema but we went into lockdown. Now they don't have it any more on their future releases ;(
Trent/Atticus deeply reference David Bowie in this track.
Heart
Kinda like Cruella
Man or women never be a god. God is only one. This is too much hate speech from hasley
This song is weird as fuck
I didn't vibe with it, but I am glad for all those who did.
Halsey is a God!
Why people talk so much about other artists during mv? Specially a.grande kinda tired people bringing her in every other artist music. For gods sake...
your not a god chill
Evil Song
😍😍😍🙏🏼
HOW COME IT ONLY HAS 8 MILLION VIEWS IN TWO WEEKS!!
So addictive song
Never heard of a God named Halsey.  Pretty trash.
❤❤
Lucky baby 💋
🤍
I would love to listen to a NIne Inch Nails version of this song! I just google the song they did compose this lol
she never disappoints me
Thanks, Trent.
ADDICTED🤤💖😭🤱🏼😭💍💁🏼‍♀️💎👏🏻😻🛐🤩🧚🏻‍♀️🌸🤰🏼
Hi
Yes, you are.
I can hear Trent and Atticus. I wish they would make a NIN album.
Halsey Pp 😍
It’s pretty awesome that Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross did the music for Halsey.
Jimin and BTS gonna watch this for sure 😂💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖

Youre right on one of the thing youre not a woman yet neither a God. A puppet? Sure. Why not
Awesome song loved it halsey
I don't understand this song but I like without me song,  sorry
Am I the only one who gets Helena Bonham Carter vibes and loving every bit of it? 💜
Foolish and idiots people pretending to be a God.
Army like it 💜 #BTS
Aesthetics doesn't make musicians
I CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO IT!
a masterpiece
Guys I don't mean to be rude ... But did namjoon shaved her eyebrows ? 🤔 ( Just a joke don't take it seriously )
I wanna more songs like this is a great music 🌪️🪐
Damn it's amazinggggggg
ıugş
This is a really good album. Listen in the dark with good headphones. Great collaboration - NIN type production but a distinctly different songwriter. Ace.
This is epic!
Everyday I've got a smile where my frown goes A couple bodies in the garden where the grass grows I take 'em with me to the grave in a suitcase Maybe I could be a different human in a new place  Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So I'll stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone Yeah I'm better all alone  I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one  I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already  Every morning, got a hollow where my heart goes I never listen but I see it with my eyes closed I know you, I remember from the grass stain Maybe I could be a better human with a new name  Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So, I'll stay right here cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone  I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one  I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already  I'm ready to leave it I'll go when I feel it Got caught both hands on the smoking gun I try but I need it It's hard but I feel it And it really does hurt when you love someone  Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So I'll stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone  I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one  I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already got one
Yes bow 👇 to me I love this
King princess - p*ssy is god  Arianna - god is a woman  Halsey - i am not a woman i am god .

Halsey yengemizin klibinin altında neden hiç Türk yok wkdndıd
Wow I wanna watch this movie . Movie title ?
Sounds like Nine Inch Nails
this is bliss to my ears holy crap Halsey
Remembering listening to this over and over when it first came out
She’s a genius!
I find this pretty blasphemous egotistical and ignorant.
Stream this masterpiece
Where’s @frozenintime? This song sounds too much like the sopranos theme song lol
So full of herself.. even in article's and interview's.. arrogance is not attractive.. she will do anything for attention.. money is her drive as she pretends it's about people..
Wow this song and “Overthinking is the Devil” by Somm hits so deep to me, and really resonates my feelings.
Smoking gun 🤘
When we talk about gender equality, we mean that no gender is superior to another gender
God is not a woman God is not a man God has no gender
este álbum es una joyita, gracias Halsey por tanto 💜💜💜💜
Why didn't I see this earlier
I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. Romans 8:18
I got actual goosebumps listening to this
S*U*ID wording, rhyme, and theme. Us*les* song.
I feel so powerful every time I hear this song 💜🥺 Halsey we purple you 💜
love this... it takes real courage to try something new.  Bravo Halsey!
QUEEN✨
You are awesome👍
Yerimsu
Halsey is bad
*Masterpiece Periodt.*
I love this kind of song that feels like a gods is playing and singingI love this kind of song that feels like a god is playing and singing
I stoped listneing to her for a while. But.... I love this so much ughh I'm here for it<3
John 20:31  but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you may have life in His Name.
this is sick!!!
Worst song ever 🤬🤬🤬
Straight up blasphemy. Ushering in the antichrist.... Lord help us 🙏
Sellout
Am not a woman, I’m a god  to anyone feeling shitty, it gonna be okay:)
Trents singature is bold here. Fantastic Track! The entire Album is on Rotation and I really love it! It's a half NIN record and Halsey, which I didn't know before this, makes it even greater.
استغفر الله
Beautiful song and video
Through her eyes🌹
I can hear Trent Reznor in this masterpiece
Love to halsey. She makes good songs.
i love you ashleyyyy❤️
This song makes me love the fact that I'm a woman ❤ women are always very looked down on and its about time that changed.
,🤩😍
ESTAAGGGFİRUULLLAAHHHH
Paradise for ears 😍✨
Alicia keys : girl on fire Beyoncé : run the world (girls)  Arina grande : god is women  Halsey:

W*men
This is a masterpiece 💜
The second i heard this song, I was like wow Nine inch nails, not even knowing the influence they had on this album. I adore the collab. Great job
Great video, I listened to the album expecting nothing and ended up loving it. Can't wait to watch the whole film!
How can I pass a day without listening to this?

"I'm not a woman, I'm a hoe"  give gardening tools equal rights
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
This woman is Go(l)d The album is a masterpiece like Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross always do
This is the God our prophetess Ariana spoke of.
🤢🤮🤮🤮
Wait, this is way too much are you comparing yourself with GOD? Siz hell is waiting for you 😢
Listen 👂 is this song every day is gonna love ❤️
Ariana: God is a Woman Halsey: I'm not a woman, I'm a God
Do not be deceived:God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows Galatians 6:7
Another failed attempt at tryna be edgy. Also g baiting again I see.
this is amazing
That's amazing!
Thank you Sampurna for introducing me wid this gem💕
Isnt it embarrasing that im gonna watch this masterpiece now
🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
I'm. Not. A. Woman of. God. Brañd  new. Pop
This is a masterpiece
Halsey our girl, this is AMAZING!
True artist 💛
Shut the hell up yall be disrespecting the name of God  you are a normal girl shut up
боже, какая Холзи потрясающая!
The best
Scarlet Witch , Arya Stark , Daenerys Targaryen , Yennefer of Vengerberg , Boa Hancock , Erza Scarlet ,… waiting this song for a long long timeeeeee
I can't get this song out of my head.
sin palabras para la perfección
Sooo freaking good.
This gives me Marie Antoinette vibes.
I can't get enough of this masterpiece! I love it
This is very Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross sound. Never tought I would listen to this great work with Halsey. I'm loving it!
My first impression was..."Hmmm, vocals are... ok, they may grow on me. Tune is very catchy, some daring use of dissonance - production is awesome. Man...Trent should really check this out. It's really on point!" ....then I checked out who produced it.
This is what we want to hear from Halsey.. the beat with the lyrics just suits with her..
The various people that she played are an ode to the complexity and struggle of the feminine energy.
How can you not love Halsey. She’s the type of artist that evolves and tries new things. Respect. one day i will work with Halsey!  one day :)
Why do I get Saddam and gamor vibes
Demonic.
2:45 Halsey turned Daenerys Targaryen's 3 dragon siegel into 4 dragons!!! 🤗🐉🐉🐉🐉
halsey's art never fails to amaze, im in love with everything this woman creates  🤍
Perfeita demais
UNDERATTED so much, at least some radio stations started to play this song...I hope ITS BLOW OUT
1:57 is  giving me  a goosebumps ... i dont know why
GOOD
Love the song 🎵 Love the video             You are a God 🥰  🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Halcy get some eyebrows
استغفر الله واتوب إليه من كل ذنب عظيم اياكم ترددوا كلمات الاغنية هذا كفر بالله
Ily
I totally feel ya girl. If I can't have love, I want power.
Amo esta canción
i don't know if halsey's a god, but she definitely looks like one
If she doesn’t win something for this song .
This song and the way you sing it inspires me to cry and feel release, it inspires me to go on long walks with propelled, deep steps. So brave Halsey, congratulations.
The Trent Reznor influence is all over this track. Shit's hot & I ain't even a Halsey fan...but this is easily swaying me, lol
9.8k dislike 👎🏻smh....
Legend.
QUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN
God is a woman Vr:2
This song is art ⭐
Как они уже все надоели со своими играми в богов!
Cette musique je sens que dans 4ans je l'écouterais encore
bad vocal. no music at all. And you are not a god! no woman inherits the kingdom of god
HALSEEEEEEY! I am an ARMY and i love you
😮😮
did trent hand in a sonoio demo
finally, it took Trent Reznor to come along and iron all that pretentiousness out of her voice and sound.
woooooooooow⚡
perfeita demais
I watched the interview the other day about this and the process. Then I listened to a few tracks. The description doesn't do it justice. There is something very loose in the music which is surprising as a lot of it is programmed. It's not NIN but something else. Halsey's mark is all over it. The last time I saw her was her great collaboration with BTS and that's few years ago.
Halsey..💜
What are you are God 😂😂😂 I wish God forgive you 🤣🤣
Hi.. to all the goddess ❤️
God is god Ure just a woman
This kind of sounds like something Grime's would make. Its an excellent song
I love ❤❤❤❤❤💋
The moment a girl understand she don't need a boy to be complete is the moment world gets another queen 👑
Wowwww awsome
Oh my God. ... This is what a music video should look like.. The representation of the small Things as a God... It shattered my beliefs.. Hail halsey It's commendable
Hi, i AM Army
I love the name of the song 😍😍😍
Это фильм или сериал??? Или это просто клип???
I am an ARMY  I love this song
This sounds so 90s
this album and especially this song f**s everything and everyone. thank you for this masterpiece Halsey and Trent and Atticus
Is that Halsey? She looks like a butter face without makeup…..
This reminds me of GIAW by Ariana Grande
The real ilumination👹
"Yeah i'm better all alone "
This is one of the most visually stimulating and aesthetically beautiful music videos I’ve seen in a long time.
"But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. 2 People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, 3 without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, 4 treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God— 5 having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people." 2 Timothy 3:1-5
I hope pueve you true words you be lie for one year
Not say what is not true  let me tell you not say words you not 100% sure over ELOHYM  no body all part of creation
Спорно... очень спорно. Обожаю Холзи, песня интесная, визуал просто великолепен, но конечное музыкальное оформление мне совсем не зашло
The reason a song like this won’t blow up is because only certain people will understand it.  Not everyone has the mindset to appreciate real art on a deeper level.  Same way majority of people don’t go to museums.
just next illuminati puppet
' So keep your heart because I already got one ' .....
So NIN, great collaboration
This song deserve 100+ million views
All is right in the world now that Halsey dropped this album
There's going to be a movie?
Wow truly wonderful
Halsey, you are not a woman you're a god 😭🥺
"Art is not what I create. What I create, is chaos." -Halsey Imagine this song playing as the soundtrack of next Scarlet Witch movie
I'm sorry  But womans not God Womans are very perfect and brave ,but they aren't God
Why do you guys like this except bc it’s a good song, who cares, she’s calling herself a God, and it’s disrespectful, and y’all wanna sit there and act like it’s not a problem😂
"i'm a god"? I don't like this comparison as a believer.  Proclaiming yourself as God in a song with nudity is very daring. I won't even listen to this song, it disgusts me so much. Nobody compares to God, he is unique and omniscient. Whether it's just words or anything else.
atheism 🤢
I think this song for Arya from GoT
Yes! I'm not getting over this album! And will never! Cuz It really hits me hard when I can relate with your lyrics Halsey ! The power! The pain! The scream ! The everything ! I'm absolutely dumbstruck!!  Thank you so much for this Album! Kudos to the entire team!
🔥🔥
Love it
YAS QUEEN
Wo
Jaan ♥️🇳🇵
Disclaimer : This song is very addictive
I want to say something: "Ender" means "rare" in Turkish 🇹🇷🤗
this shit gives me chills if you dont like halsey thats ok but remember youre wrong
💘💘
1:41 This scene MAKES ME CRY ALWAYS. It's really beautyful.
I need to watch the movie 🥲,
Just a reminder they go buy She/They :)
thanks to her i have a good life not so good but is a chance for me every song of her like this this is a masterpiece
I'm not a legend l'm a fraud
🖤🛐
lot of brainwashed people in these comments, this song is trash.
Before you ignore this remember that everyone started from somewhere. Hello Im Khari, Im a lover of it all Bossa Nova, Hiphop, Rock, and the beautiful jazz. I made a track called "Dueling Dragons" . For years I wanted to be a musician but fear always made me say "My time is too late, I missed my shot" so at 26 I became fed up with the day to day, moved to rural japan  and started putting out music. This song is all about the good vs. the bad. One minute you're focused, the next meeting you are distracted. One minute you are planning for great things, next minute you are wallowing in your sorrows. The beat is from Japan! The artwork is from Russia  the instrumental is from the superb Dutch producer  the lyrics are from America and the temptation is from Germany , so I hope that you enjoy the show! It's quite theatrical. We also created a new genre Hip-hop + City Pop #CityHiphop. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1ORhc3wruc (You jazzers might like Schroeder and Lucy though) =)
on my birthday halsey launches this masterpiece BEST BIRTHDAY GIFT. AAAAAAA
I love you halsey, you are really talented
masterpiece that's what she is
if i have to choose a song to listen to for the rest of my life THISSS PLS
She is a revolution
Everyone thinks she copied Ariana Grande’s “God is a woman” and honestly its completely different to me.
she's giving boro vibe
Very nice. Melody is very unusual, very NIN. I love it.
ok halsey calm down
You can claim to be whatever you want, that doesn't make it true. Not that you'd care, because you're just like everyone else, living in a fantasy world.
I watched this with just reading the subtitles and the lyrics fit well with the video but as soon I listen to it with sound the song didn’t fit the video at all. The instrumental isn’t as strong as the actual lyrics are. It’s too.. pop? Idk.
I miss old Halsey...
This song is boosting my ego
I'm literally subscribed to her channel + notifications activated and I didn't get the noti of this MV
Ariana grande’s copy
COMO TE AMO HALSEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ESTO ES ARTE!
SHE IS A LEGEND AND, SHE KNOWS IT.
"so keep your heart cus i already got one"  YES HALS 😩
i love u since 2014' new americana  im so fucking proud !!!!!!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭
Who are the 9.5k people that disliked? I just wanna talk
2:40 She burnt her kingdom. Her hopeless Fountain Kingdom. So is she the ruler of Hell? The Devil with the broken of broken hearts. "Life's a Mess" by halsey and JuiceWrld. "Have you ever fallen head over heels for somebody. Not just somebody, Not just somebody. But somebody who made promises to give you the world. I really hope they held you down. I really hope there was no lying. Cause when your heart breaks it feels like your world (her Kingdom here in 2:40 I am not a women, I'm a god. From if I can't have love, I want Power" Album) gone (a song by The Weeknd). But if the Loves real you feel your soul roar like a Lion. And you can finally let bygones, be bygones.  Don't throw in the towel, I know it feels like you're the only one trying, you've just gotta learn to live and love on".....
"Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know. So I'll stay right here cause I'm better off alone" -- Halsey. "If you don't love me no more lieee" -- song lie by Halsey by the Hopeless fountain kingdom.
brutal la manera en que cambia la vibe desde el principio al final wow
1:57 "I'm ready to leave it. I'll go when I feel it. Got caught both hands on the smoking gun. I try but I need it. It's hard, but I feel it. And it really does hurt when you love someone"
1:55 This is giving me "Industry Baby" by Lil Nas X Vibes!!
1:49 "NightMare" by Halsey. "I am not a Martyr, I'm a problem"
1:26 Didn't Rihanna talk/sing/ make reference to the same something in her Music Video Desperado.
1:45 "I am not a legend, I'm a fraud. So keep your heart cause I already got one".
Freedom and constraints (limits: "We all need limits" -- G-Eazy. I know but work with me on this one). You either have limits in the beginning and freedom afterwards, built on limits. Or you have mass amounts of limits in the beginning. With no limits. Which means that their is no resistance to keep you from swinging on the ropes from all your lack of limits. And so you limit yourself. You become prey to those who would otherwise limit you. Isolate you for their own sake. And so you "beg" for them to limit you for your healths sake. Because the bad is better then the worst that you've grown accustom to. Or that you were groomed into. Have you ever read of the Book: "Of mice and men" with Piggy's head on a stick. When the kids cried for the parents to help them. Once they finally found them?
ma femme
0:08 Is she petting and stroking/ giving comfort to the dead in the water Halsey from her last album?
Didn't Kanye go on this whole "I am a god" thing too.
Completely Addicted to this song. once again, we see the genius of Trent when he collabs with others.
i love you ❤️ love love love halsey 💝💝
Very loving😍
You re like flower🌺
My beautiful💖
My love😘
Wow, this SCREAMS Trent and Atticus. As a longtime NIN supporter, I dig. Hard.
0:34 Halsey’s ass?
lmao first she is denied billboard #1 by Eminem now by kanye. deserved kekw
THIS IS MY JAM!!!!1!!!11!!!
This album and Plastic Hearts by Miley Cyrus are the most underrated albums released this season!
Wtf
🗑️
This song ridessssssss!
ARIANA: *" GOD IS A WOMAN "* HALSEY: *" I'M NOT A WOMAN, I AM A GOD "*
ස්තූතියි ඔබ සියලු දෙනාටම Thank all of you
I have a new obsession

God is a woman tho🐧
💜💜💜
trash song ... pure trash
She is superior and wonderful in my opinion is like that (✿ ♡ ‿ ♡)
Halsey mi mujerrr ella ES TAN SUPERIOR (✿ ♡‿♡) ME ENCANTA TANTO ESTA MUCHACHA (♡ω♡ ) ~♪
Fucking Trent.  Adapting to modern trends while keeping his optimistic depressive vibe.
THIS SONG IS SO GOOD

останусь в истории...
As someone without a damn tattoo, I must say I adore that "baby" tattoo on the belly so much. 👊🏽
This song is beautiful net that I do not stop listening to it
Prince of Persia vibes ❤️
This is disgusting
ලංකාවෙ උන් ඉන්නද ❤️🌈️🌈️❤️
It's really hard to work if you're pregnant. I watched her interview and she explained how this album (If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power) created because of this
NOW THIS WHAT YOU CALL AN ARTIST
Gotta love how we’re hearing Nine Inch Nails all over this.
This song hits so damn hard!!
Türkler ses verin!!!
So much NIN flavor in this. Didnt even know who she was but I love me some Trent so I checked it out. Sounds good.
Halsey a living legend
It feels like a Walmart version of Grimes.
Llegue acá por Trent!!!! Temazo!!!!! Y qué cambio radical dio esta mujer! Aguante!!!!
She is queen of my heart
Halsey for president. Could you imagine? 🖤
كغر عيني عينك وجع أن شالله لا اله الا الله وبس قالت ايش قالت انا لست امراءه انا الرب ع كيفها لا تخلين ربي يأخذ ولدك نادر منك بس ولدت وتمادت الأخت
NON-BINARY ANTHEM OF THE CENTURY
Sounds completely like Nine Inch Nails.
This video is BOLD ❤️
that last scene at IMAX was jaw-dropping 😮
Omygosh she really did drop a new album 😳
ah yes this is ok but if a youtuber says the naughty words theyre demonetized
Does anyone know where the sample is from cause it sound so familiar yet idk
Imma stay right here cos I'm better off alone... I wish that in my lifetime I meet this awesome chicka, Halsey is so honest to her music and heart... I feel I relate in a sense, I had an ex like fucking gerald (no I won't give him a capital letter), and I know she has the most beautiful family man and baby now and congrats to that. It tells me that things will get better... Looking forward to that. The back and forward confidence in this song, is so amazing. I love you Halsey
This is jamming
The new: " God is a woman".
Top of the world
I MISSED SEEING HALSEY AND BTS PERFORMANCE
The more we stray from god is the worse it becomes for us. Talk about blasphemy, this is to much. John 14:6, need I say more.
The world would have been boring without Halsey's music.
Some Bjork tones i heard on her ! Amazing talent as always
straight banger
One of the only two good songs from her new album. The album is terrible but this, this song is a fucking amazing!
Wait!? She's pregnant where have I been!!!??😱😱😱
OKAY POP OFF QUEEN
That last pull away shot gave me goosebumps, that was TUFF
I would have never thought Halsey would collaborate with Trent Reznor... But its fire 🔥.
Anyone else getting Dany and Cersei vibes. Especially Cersei vibes with black dress, on a sĺightly jazzed up iron throne, plus baby? Halsey does look gorgeous in that pool scene tight shot on the face. Think I am going to like this.
Shout out to atticus rose and trent reznor for producing such a good sounding album
Essa mulher é muito perfeita
Thank you Halsey for speaking out about endometriosis!!
Still KillShot Stays in Ur body God ?  Eminem Slaughtered U God ?
Omg. I don't love it nah nah nah  I purple it. It's great. It's just woow .purple u halsey
Please respect Muslims, you are not the god, there is one god we created the rest of the religions after this song really hate you weaken my love for you you really changed after fame
Wow. I like it)
Thanks for sharing. If you have a minute, I took a shot at doing my own podcast, featuring interviews with super fun people. I'd love if you would take a listen. It's on my channel. Hope you enjoy!
Vc ve q realmente essa musica tem a essencia do Trent Reznor,qm é fã do NIN q nem eu vai entender o q to falando
ah retirement videos one of my favs
Doesn't match.  Trent did an awful job.  He needed to sing to this music.  Halsey is dumb for thinking this would work with her pop voice.
"There no other God before the God tha saves you".  This is truly a mocked to the most high. Repent before its not to late as the coming of the King is near.
Bring on Halsey god complex
this is truly one of her best songs ohhhh
This should be America's national anthem.
This song has Renzor and Ross written all over it and they’re fucking brilliant so looks like I have to listen to the whole album now.
The lyrics:  Everyday I've got a smile where my frown goes A couple bodies in the garden where the grass grows I take 'em with me to the grave in a suitcase Maybe I could be a different human in a new place  Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So I'll stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone Yeah I'm better all alone  I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one  I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already  Every morning, got a hollow where my heart goes I never listen but I see it with my eyes closed I know you, I remember from the grass stain Maybe I could be a better human with a new name  Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So, I'll stay right here cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone  I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one  I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already  I'm ready to leave it I'll go when I feel it Got caught both hands on the smoking gun I try but I need it It's hard but I feel it And it really does hurt when you love someone  Oh I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know So I'll stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone  I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one  I am not a woman, I'm a God I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart, 'cause I already got one
Has anyone got a link for a video analysis breakdown? There’s a lot of deeper meanings and symbolism in this video. Can’t find anything yet!
Las últimas dos  tomas del vídeo 01:57 quedaron brutales.
Great song.
I agree with u STRONGE GIRL! 💙
What the freak is that Our Queen Halsey need more views 😭 #ARMY
So empowering! Love her so much!
BTW..do you reckon Halsey has been playing a tonne of Dark Souls in the lock down cos this imagery seems inspired by it..I reckon
I'm a lifelong NIN fan but I've always thought Halsey was good so this combination ..well ..blown away ..it's fantastic
FIRST: the title of the song and the power of it? yes SECOND: the video, the story, the meaning behind each scene and the outfits? yes THIRD: i could go on and on but Halsey just leaved me without words I LOVE IT AN I´M HERE FOR IT
WhY you call your self god    Even when inside you   devil. God is holy so  please 🙏 don't use his name   God is not a moked  Not he's dirty like you show in this
Say whatever but Halsey is damn underrated in today's music industry .
Wow ... Awesome.. great work ya..
Ok we are as logical “human beings” don’t have any problem from anyone to value himself that much but A god !!! Despite that most of Americans and other non-believers don’t care about the concept of what “religion” means , I guess this is the moment when we say “that’s so crossing the line!!” .. God you are the greatest , and I’m sorry bcz i can’t do anything about this shit ..
No,i am sorry you are not a god you are just a woman
Damm girl, the vibes and bass in this track is so addictive. 🔥🔥🔥👍🏽
Wth is that ...what this kinda songs start to spread ???
2021 song 😎👍halsey
Halsey💜
Trent's production style is so distinctive. It works wonderfully in this context.
I have golden ear now
BRAZIL I LOVE U ❤️🇧🇷
COME TO BRAZIL HALSEY ❤️
I mean,,,, we been knew, halsey
I didnt know she was in Czechia! I was in the Spa this clip was filmed in :D
9/6/21 9.1k people without taste dislikes this
Wow...
Hey Halsey if you guys could send me the film on DVD for my birthday that would be amazing!
What happen in this world today? The real evolution is human race, they become cruel because they don't know God.
Okay, so human are being Gods, nice song, but the metaphor here..., Hope everyone knows what he's doing and getting himself influenced by.may God bless you
Reminded me of spartacus!
Just wow
جرا ايه ياولاد الملحده
Halsey is so pretty . Effortless pretty
Halsey Makes me Inspired to Write moore Music. If I Just had A place to record It In - oh Well Just a wish.Thats A Beautiful place and Halsey Makes A Masterpiece again. 🤩💖
حاجی چ خفن
پشمام
Love from India
That's abominable,GOD is not a woman,this belief is for those who doesn't believe that there is GOD.
Ne alaka
Trent Reznor..
The instrumental itself is good for clubs i love it
👏👏❤❤❤
هالزي فقدت السيطرة 🙂🥂
Hot🤍
Balance. As all things should be
I can bet Trent  Reznor has worked on this song!
Women
The song title is abnormal
I'm a HUGE fan!
Great sound, (thanks trent) Too bad she ruins the song with lame lyrics and meh vocals.
just like doja cat, you deserved # 1 most played album ... i love your new job. Greetings goddess
Out of the whole album. This song stands out the most. Lyrics are meant for Halsey. The music blends in perfectly with the lyrics.
Ariana Grande : "God is A woman"  Halsey: sure?
This
Blasphemy
🤧🤧🤧🤧
me lembrou a Renata Celi
To all the Fan who came here after kingdom announcement, thank you so much for your support and positivity. Welcome to the Excellent music product😊
This album is gonna change mainstream pop music. Watch, I’m calling it. This shit is next level genius. Up there with michael Jackson’s thriller.
Grimes has a challenge now
I love the ancient roman themes in this
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE!!!
Maybe I can be a better human with a different name.. that hit me. I didn’t know what to expect but I liked it
NIN brought me here..Halsey is one hell of a talent. Fan for life
🤩🤩
this song deserves more
How many army's are here to support this queen!!👸💜
I was very confused when she said "I'm not a woman, I'm a god" , Because I thought she said "I'm not a woman, I'm a guy"
Therr is only one god and its allah
راكو بديتو تزيدوووو عليها متسخنوووش بزاف
Can we just appreciate this😭😭😭💖💖💖
This song omg....it's a hit ❤️ love it
0:28
Please release the movie on HBO Max or something! Watching it in the theaters was not enough for me! 😭❤️
If Trent is down with this I have no choice but to listen. I am fine with this 👏🏼
being a mom does make you a God if you have the power to win
How do I watch the movie?
❤️👩🏻‍🍼
When you got zero talent, you make nude videos, classic, from the stone age really.
So "God" means w h o r e  these days ? Perverted people do anything for money, no self-respect or respect for anyone else.
Maravilhosa essa mulher!!!
This is so underrated
Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross <3
I grew a whole cup size after listening to this.
I’m an Angel to say a God is funny to me but whatever
I’m here because I’m a nine inch nails fan! This awesome
💯³⁰
The song is just a narrative. She’s just singing that’s all. She’s beautiful that’s for sure! Don’t hate her for this.
It feels like artpop 10 years later but weaker
Badass 👍👍👍👍
This is giving me life 🤩🤩🤩
My queen
Yes
Ma ti si đeniferrrr lopezzzz🖕
its giving mother! (2017)
I want to be the seven millionth listen so I'm going to hit repeat until it's me
This album sucks. I was expecting more from hasley but there is one song I like out the whole album the rest is completed garbage.
Just like when NF said we walk around with the devil talk on both shoulders I wish I can tell you he disappear when we get older,  or when he said you find a life it's nothing more than just appearances ☻Halsey 🖤😔
KYLIE JENNER NEW SONG BY ME.....AMERICAN BEAUTY BY TAMARA ONYOUTUBE........PEOPLE ALSO WATCHING........
Caraioo, que música boa <3
visuals and the msg are amazing but I really don't like the song, its just not fitting in me!
Nobody can be a God!!!
Bro wtf this is so good for what
Can people please just TURN TO JESUS. Not Halsey.
This music video is a cinematic experience I was not ready for..... I have to lie down
As a guy,  this song hits strong. Great song and even album wow Halsey 👍🏼
This album is perfection😍
but god is a woman?
tombalak bebek
You're a women.. not God.
WoW Halsey.: )
Saçmalama!!!
çok iyi , harika ve başarılı bir şarkı
im the king of the world
THE FACT IS HASLEY JUST A WOMEN LIKE ANY WOMEN IN THIS WORLD. I dont like people who say "i am God"
Halsey Hit me so hard....
The title reminds me of God is a women ... But the song is not even close
How can I watch the film for her album? Is it only available to watch if youve bought tickets?
considering halsey is an athiest, she has no idea about god....
woww
Me encantó esta canción y Honey, bueno el álbum es tan variado que conforme escuchas las canciones, más adictivas son
what is this .... oh i mean what the bullshit is this ... the god is one ... women is not god.. just a beautiful creation of god ... please dont do shirk ... its good for you
This s flawless
Ugh, that fucking NIN groove. So tasty!!
I didn't like it
Wow... can really feel Trent Reznor and Atticus's touch behind this!
I am in love with this song. Excellent. It's very deep. Its life changing for me especially now. I am in tears. It's meaningful words this song will go places. Thank you Halsey!!!!
this is her worst song to date. (imo)
This videos is.....something.
If god is not a woman and a man so maybe God Is Gay💁
How you said you god, its not good  Sewage expression, should choose your words when you talk about god, it's not good ✌️👍
Even God herself, has enemies...
tombalak bebe
Demon God
Amazing. 👍.  Greetings from Germany 🇩🇪  My son started singing too. I hope someone likes this style of music- simp https://youtu.be/ugBNdg1GERc you’re such a big inspiration to the young generation nowadays thanks a lot 🤗
Cok guzell
love it
🖤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
This is a bop💖😔🤚
voice: so beautiful song: fire looks: hot halsey: is everything
there is no god but Allah!!!
When I tell you, she shook my whole world when I first heard this album, I'm not lying.
Is the album produced by my favorite genius musician of the century?say,who could it be???? Trent Reznor of NINE INCH NAILS ofcourse!!!! Who else could do all that he has done for the sake of saving the music and the art???😎😎💯 never listened to Halsey that I can say I know of for sure.  But,if Trent Reznor has had hands on the project, I know it is gonna be great, so give her a chance.
God is a woman
Her tattoos are distracting her Beauty
This "God is a woman" remix??
This is so. Indescribably beautiful.
Nice song but...
Thank you.
I love this💖🔥!!!!
This song has Trent all over it. When the synth comes in… classic NIN
Hahaha funny song 🎵🤣😂
Best album to date! The amazing Halsey with Trent and Atticus production? Who knew? <3
Kinda got that NIN feel.
اتقي الله يا مر
disgusting
God is a woman?
AM SORRY YOUR NOT A GOD. DON'T COME FOR ME. IT'S THE HONEST TRUTH.
Her voice is so unique, i love it
Ohh Queen Halsey you're amazing
*God
Watch (Nine Inch Nails - The Perfect drug) right after this, you're welcome.
When I reached the end, I was like darn it. Over already?! :( lol  🤍Halsey🤍
Blasphemy
Ever since I saw her do a hot and empowering album cover after becoming a mom with this new album I have a new nickname for this goddess, Mama Halsey.
*plays on repeat until women rule the world ;)
Tell that to God when you die.... actually we all die not God, God is forever ❤
I sometimes think I'm a duck-billed platypus
Worth the wait 🤩🤩🤩
Masterpiece
she looks so good this video is beautiful
Sounds good Without Chainsmokers even 👏😳😳😳👍
AMAMOOOS
I can hear Trent and atticuss
the coolest song i've heard in a long time. this song fucks. i love it.
Esta super
Watching this at 6.6 m is iconic to me
Everything Trent touches is perfection.
What do these singers mean that their a God? We are not God's. There is only the one and true God that is King of King and Lord of Lords.
Trent Reznor should go back to aping off Bowie, Skinny Puppy and Ministry.
all I got to say is  what a queen❤❤❤❤❤
Reznor is the best!
You're a real queen:)
Masterpiece <3
This is one of the best albums I've heard in recent years.  It reminds me of From the Choirgirl Hotel by Tori Amos.  Same dark and brooding kind of vibe.
Yengemiz 😍
Simplesmente amo muito essa música
What 😂 Omg
“Pregnant belly rub” from me to you, Halsey! <3
TRENT!!!!!!!
Baby, the world is yours#pia pounds
I'm so proud of her. This is her best album yet, it's all I listen to since it came out. 🖤
🤼‍♀️🏋🏼‍♀️🧘🏼‍♀️🏄🏼‍♀️
Toi tu vas pas y aller au paradis ni ariana d'ailleurs
I honestly don't understand how I (a male) can one day listen to death metal and the next day vibing to this.
Only a week and I keep coming back here 💯💙 its a masterpiece💛👑
So awesome
Love it !
We all know what happened to pharaoh when he claimed he's a God 🌚
I hear NIN and Atticus with a few Bowie "I can't give everything away" riffs.
"I know you I remember from the grass stain" when your bodies don't stay buried....
When the descending tones kick in at 2:07 +:01 I lose my damn mind. The progression of this song is too delicious.
Halsey a fucking queen
Ender you should be proud of with your mom
You don’t have to be a blasphemous egomaniac to make a hit. Pathetic.
budgettt
I didn't know that she had a music video for this song
Wow! God level! 💕
I like this one. Especially this phare "Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know." 🙌
Cokiyi be
By far my favorite singer ❤️
Yenge klip mükemmel olmuş ha şarkı da muq
If god was a woman, she would definitely make an album with Trent Reznor. 🖤🖤🖤
https://youtu.be/8n7Goi49LC0 Hope you'll feel better after this 🥺🥺🥺🥺
BU SARKIYI BIRAZ DAHA DINLERSEM KOMAYA GIRECEGIM IMDAAAT
Thank you.  Beautiful "art", to my story.  It's, "I Have Power".  And, "I have love".  Please, don't give your power away, and yes, it's better being alone, at least until, you meet someone who is in their Divinity and Power.  I've been, to so many castles and cathedrals in Europe, I am wanting, to move, to Amsterdam, that's what I'm considering.  I feel, it's just, "better";)
seni çok seviyoruz ash <3
the day of destruction is close
way to elevate a pop song 👍🏼
Klibi yaşadım resmen dinler iken.Hayranlığım hiç bitmesin ayhhh
This is great. Heard this and thought Trent 100% love this. Her voice is amazing.
The sounds on this gives me zelda ocarina of time vibes 🔥🔥
It's day 6 and still I am not coming out of this trap
You’re.... overrated
LEGEND
God is a woman ❤️
A message to my fellow Genshin Impact gamers...I would like to dedicate this song to Raiden Shougun/Baal. I just feel like it's her anthem 🥰😍🤩 THANK YOU HALSEY FOR THIS MASTERPIECE 🙌 ❤ 🙏
Why this music video gives me mr nobody wibe thats cool
*this song makes me go womannnnnnnnnn*
Ariana : God IS woman Otherwise... Hasley : i'm not a woman, i'm God
Yeahh🔥👅
HALSEY IS BEST 🥰😍
Yasss queen
🤩❤❤❣💖
Ariana Grande: God is a woman Halsey: Yup that’s me !
I feel like a GOD listening to this & I am not even a woman 😏  This album is truly A MASTERPIECE!  💜
Omg thats so super  song  halsey is now what to do
halse deserves all the love and power she wants. i'm ready to give it all to you queen
I seriously loved this song ❤️❤️
I don’t remember seeing your dotty name in the bible
Fake God
it confirmed something the moment I saw this. ..         I really am not straight.. .
The marriage of Halsey and NIN is perfection.
Bivu - I am not a boy, I'm a cashier
God is Male.
Did you think if you have servants you're god ???
Somebody please put this over bobby shmurda - hot nigga beat.
This song is one in a million 💞💞🌟🌟🌟❤
♡♡♡♡♡♡
So, when can we buy this movie?
This is amazing
I am a mother, I can't make mistakes cus -I am not a woman, I’m a God I almost lost my life giving birth or had a miscarriage but - I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am a mother and have a career - I am not a legend, I’m a fraud  Relatable 💓
missed you halsey <33333333
am i the only one? the beat is so lame haha i'm so bothered with the kick and the bass it's clashing it was like not mix well maybe don't know how to sidechain/compression
Thank you Trent
I wish I could like this more than once. Halsey's best album yet. As a fan of NIN/Trent Reznor I hear his awesome industrial influence in most of the songs. Such an awesome team up.
I'm confused, is god a woman or not.
Better all alone 💖
wow....its....huge....
where’s the lie in the title tho
LMFAOO ARIANA DIDNT LIE
Trent and Atticus I knew it was you all along baby!
wah 🤩🙌🏻❤️
This song is so good it's physically painful.
I hate this song You are disrespecting God the father and the only God he is the creator of heaven and earth and you !!!!!
Ay, pero que precioso todo >3
Goosebumps!😭🔥🔥🔥
Wow, really enjoyed this.
Definitely, God is Every Woman 👍🏽
The title already attached me to the soul 🥰
Respeten a las mujeres
respect women
Halsey is refreshed the dark gothic scene. We like you queen! ❤️🙂👑🖤
This is an anthem. For women, who are discriminated against, beaten, housewives, raped, etc. Just look at the things that happen to women ???  in each country it is different but women go through many difficult situations in any country
Este es un himno Para las mujeres, quienes son descriminadas, golpeadas, amas de casa, violadas,  etc miren no mas todo lo que a las mujeres les pasan ???
Excelente trabajo de modos
Amazing... For me, as a female asexual on the aro spectrum, this song speaks to me on another level (especially with these sex-neutral vibes, in contradiction to "God is a woman", for example). Somehow, it feels like it reflects my inner struggle with my sexual/romantic identity and how society perceives people like me.
TRENT
i love halsey
can someone pls explain the meaning behind tjis song like lyrically i don’t understand shit
Trent Reznor passes the torch to the next generation.
I only like the song cuz NIN did the beat and they're a great band/ duo.
Holy shit iam god
Ans-we-r https://youtu.be/2sJ7NtzkJkc
ي هناية كدا حرام لكن
God is hot
YEAAAHHHHH BRO
2:30 part is insane😍💯
💜❤
Haram
I like it.
Can we agree that this is Halseys BEST ALBUM EVER
In the Quran, Allah is most often referred to with the pronouns Hu or Huwa, and although these are commonly translated as "him", they can also be translated gender-neutrally, as "them". This is also true of the feminine equivalent, Hiya. Quran 112:3–4 states: "He begets not, nor is He begotten.  Allah /God has no Gender . because Allah /God is not A human Being.
WOW YOU ARE ALRADY LOST YOUR SOUL IS THIS OKAY TO YOU. DONT GIVE UP
I have been dreaming the same dream
halsey's album is so underrated, she's a queen and a god
Halsey I KNOW you are a GOD but I'm just a woman😭😂😂
Ariana Grande: You believe God Is A Woman   Hasley: *Walks in wearing all black* Of course because that woman is me! 🖤 🖤🖤🖤
What happened with her eyebrows???🤔🤔
bro this is awesome
королева
0:28 :) pause :)

This song OMG
Halsey seni seviyoruz şarkı müthiş  Eee hiç Türk yok mu ?
the production WOOOOOW💣🙌🏻
I love the aesthetics of this video
😍😍😍😍😍🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
I'm getting Grimes vibes from this song and it's fucking good her voice is amazing
Gosh, this song is so addictive that I can't explain in words! Totally speechless and Halsey's voice is phenomenal. I loved it 😍❤️!
referência a Got?
Str8 ripping off ariana grande
It's different but I'M ALWAYS SO OBSESSED <3
She means goddess right? Yeah I'm sure she meant goddess
She's a God 🙏🙏🙏
so not HALAL MODE!!!!
0:37 complete naked girl on left
Halsey talent
El álbum es Ufff 🔥👌 Perfecto
oh WOW
ate lorde up.
çok güzel şarkı yapıyorsun ashley🤤♥️
Love is to not have love, but to give it.... dumb title. What's up with all the dark witchcraft stuff?
This is awful 😞
Who know Halsey after boy with luv 💜
I love Halsey, and I loved this album. Is such an experience. It's a piece of art.
Jesus Christ somebody give Halsey her eyebrows back  kkk  Love the vídeo
just a question - how comes god like you marks her body .which goddess had her body marked.african ?indian?god does not hurt herself god stands up when someone hurts her. god is a woman and man. otherwise people would not have two different sexes. i do not know what happened with  people with money but they are not normal. i just sit and watch. but i can tell you leaders of this world are not normal. they do what they do. the most important that they do not kill. they are like vulgar pricks and lizards, spiders and vampires.but hey.they got money!!!!!
this MV is amazing
You can rly hear trent in this song...amazing 👏
Love this song. Just perfect! 😂
No you are not a god, Jesus Christ is the one true God. All these celebrities out here calling themselves god…y’all wish.
Sou do Brasil e amo o talento dessa mulher.
No my dear you are no God 🤞🏻
Go away Halsey
All the extra time on the very bad video when all that effort could of been spent on the song. The song itself needs something for it to be a ballot of "godlike essence" where is the bellching out of pure high note of anguish that women need to hear. Nine inch nails and Halsey yall can do better on making a bad ass god like song but this isnt it.
this is very beautiful!! can't stop hearing.
She's the Queen she think she is👑
mylene farmer ! <3 ?
And I'm not a man, I'm Spiderman 😂
I'm so tired of youtube age restricting innocent peoples videos and this video is perfectly fine...
She deserves more than 6,2 million views it just hurts me
I'm obsessed with this song and mv  this is so goodd aahhhh
I litterally cant believe how good she is in music she is a real god shhh
She has outdone herself with this album♥️ I love her so much
Its a decent pump you up girl power song. But i want more of HER music. You can tell she didnt write this
In Loop... Man, this song is really fire!!!
Ariana: God is a women Halsey: I'm not a woman I'm a God
I am ARMY , I am here to support you
Trent touches it, i gotta hear it
where yo eyebrows at ?
God is Woman
Halsey Jesus loves you come home honey your hurt can be healed if u repent I promise god Is a forgiving god....dont let the devil corrupt u further..
She knows what she's doing and we're lovin' it
Nice job  Rock on
So beautiful omg 🥺
The bestest album ever !
Yooooh
the lyrics. on point
I was never into Halsey's songs but After Boy with Luv ahh
a fifteen minutes distraction for me as an old NIN fan. Sounds cute in the beginning but then you realize you've heard it all before as far as far as the Trent/Atticus contribution goes. Hope Halsey fans love it though.
U are a hoor 🙂
Perfect 😢♥️
Vocals suck.
Halseyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy is loveeeeeeee!!!!!
I love her so much
NO! This is NARCISSISM and should NOT be worshipped or praised. 🤦🏼‍♀️💔
It lingers when we're done You'll believe God is a woman  "Ariana Grande _ God is woman"
Hypnotized sleep walking and I’m also sleep talking. Did you where them and for how long I gnombe lots of stuss now I couldn’t remember befor I wore them and refused to take them off even in the sleep they hurted my head and I broke them on accident of coarse and was trying to save them but I threw them in the water and not cause I did not want to keep them but cause I felt spiteful and thought that everyone should have to see the dreams I saw
This is insane...on repeat :)
I did not think NIN could get any better..I was wrong.😎
omgg <3
Halsey just confirmed that ARIANA GRANDE doesn’t lie!
In the eyes of a child, Mother is God.
we live in a day and age where narcissism is cool. disgusting.
All her songs in the album is a bop
Soundtrack 🔥
Holy woman💅
💘🛐
The title is not the same as what I clicked on. Really??? Gonna do a click bait this bad?
Incredible❤️
Halsey this song is so beautiful and strong. Thank you for sharing your talent with us! You keep us strong! Keep fighting for us Halsey. I know alot of pressures on you but you got this. You deserve every good thing that swings your way! Ly! 💞🦋🌞
Pretty stupid
Lyrics a little repetitive, but its pop so
Its ok
Be careful what u claim
God is a Woman and her name is Halsey.
That's what she said
Masterpiece.
I need to see the whole movie, halsey looks amazing! She could be a killer actress
❤😇
why is this not blowing up!!!
ᴅᴏɴ'ᴛ ᴛᴀᴋᴇ ɢᴏᴅ'ꜱ ɴᴀᴍᴇ ɪɴ ᴠᴇɪɴ
Such a strange cool vibe. Pop meets cyberpunk meets synth wave.
Army girl halsey💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Sorry but I'll always love her music especially when I feel angry
To much hype for this. Long trailers. The song is complete shit.
I am sorry..but your song so....hmmm..yeah u know that
I've been a NIN/Trent fan since high school, so 20+ years, & obsessed with Halsey since she started so this collaboration is pure genius on both their parts. Never in a million years would I have thought that they would have made music together and I'm so glad they did !  So fucking awesome!  Love it you badass Gods you!
Halsey hot woman
Again You are not a God not even close REPENT NOW OR YOU WILL PAY THE PRICE FOR YOUR BLASPHEMY!!! JEHOVAH IS THE ONLY GOD AND WILL RECOMPENSE YOUR EVIL IF YOU DONT REPENT AND TURN TO JESUS CHRIST FOR FORGIVENESS!!!!!!!!! THIS IS YOUR FINAL WARNING!!!!! JESUS CHRIST IS COMING SOON!!!!
You are not a God not even close REPENT NOW OR YOU WILL PAY THE PRICE FOR YOUR BLASPHEMY!!! JEHOVAH IS THE ONLY GOD AND WILL RECOMPENSE YOUR EVIL IF YOU DONT REPENT AND TURN TO JESUS CHRIST FOR FORGIVENESS!!!!!!!!! THIS IS YOUR FINAL WARNING!!!!! JESUS CHRIST IS COMING SOON!!!!
How dare you say I'm not a woman I'm a God ?
i love this song
Awesome!!
This song made me cry
GOD is the creator of  the people, animals, trees, earth and the universe. He has the ability to do everything. He is one. No one or nothing similar or like the God.
The music reminds me of Violence be Grimes
That sos beautiful
Lit!
good job
0:28 thank me later😏😏
Sooo amazing I'm not woman I'm god ❤🤭
Cek guys aesthetic backsound no copyright https://youtu.be/pVyj2Xy41yA
She looks like Liv Tyler in lotr in the beginning of the video
One hell of a banger ! Ashley supremacy 🛐
Justo lo que necesitaba escuchar ✨💙
Halsey our armies queen
Brilliant 😍
Entenda que eu te amo
I never pay attention to this, but, wow, freaking masterpiece
they look so beautiful 🥺
She's beautiful, I really feel her lyrics, I hope the best for you in life, Halsey 💗
I love Halsey, I love this song, I love that her dream of being a mother came true, I am just so happy for her!
Didn't listen to the song, but no... you are not god 🙊🙈🙉
this is so good
All my favorites in one place here. Trent, been listening since I was 14 and Halsey, caught you in my 30s and damn if ya'll ain't making beautiful music in my 40s. Love this collaboration!!!
Ariana Grande was right, God is Woman... But he denies it   BOTH ARE GOD
Not a legend, a fraud? 😀 I like honesty. Sets herself free. I like Ash! Good work.
QUEEN ASF!!!!!!!
Fact that she use small letter god and Ariana used capital letter there's something about Ariana Grande  Well this is a jam
quer dizer então que mulher não pode ser um deus?? mds não acredito Halsey..
You all actually like this garbage?
this music video is scary
*silva* BRUTÁLSTICO 😳🙊
Oh cool, blasphemy and heresy in the entertainment industry again
Ese sonido del pianito y bateria muy NIN , igual es muy pop,pero edulcorado !!!!
Been a NIN fan since Pretty Hate machine, came here due Trent and Atticus. Now  I cannot stop listening to this track. Amazing collaboration!
Was this video straight up from the film? Someone give me context! Lol.
I dont like this song
???
BatChest WOW CHILLS!
I just wanna know where the bathhouse scene was filmed
Hot
Yall need Jesus!
ARMY HERE . QUEEN HALSEY ALL THE WAY
Does sound like Trent Reznor with Halesy who I don't know till now singing. Need to search again for the Trent and Zach De LA Rouch of Rage against the machine double album which last time I looked was mostly in a vault for years not released? Good tune!
where them eyebrows at tho
This is disgusting
Nice
My Gods.
İşte bu ya.
amazing you are a Legend💞✨
These lyrics..really addictive!! 1) https://youtu.be/aQ7ptAdZgHM 2) https://youtu.be/J5ee5OHIpIY
Mk, well. This is dope.
ADICTIVA <3
I feel like these are alternates or deleted scenes from Game of Thrones.
Im the NIN addict who listened because of Atticus and Trent, and I absolutely love this album. Halsey has a new fan
Amazing music! <3
This is halsey's best work! They are a god!!
this is beautiful
UMMM WTF IS THIS? SOUNDS LIKE MY 6 YEAR OLD WOULD PUT TOGETHER...I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD LISTEN TO HER WORDS...BOZO THE CLOWN SPOKE SMARTER THAN THIS SONG ..SHIISSSH
With the small "G" ✨✨✨✨✨ yasssssss
The visuals are giving me The Handmaid's Tale vibes and I love it!
Bass is so awesome in starting
Mmmm too weird for me , I'll pass
I’m watching for the song I swear
https://youtu.be/WXbKufflrlE
Belly in the bathtub is soo cute😍
Your not a god
garbage
Halsey sanat yaptı bu albümüyle kesinlikle bu sene tüm ödülleri ona vermeliler.
Fuck, long time Reznor fan.... Damn this is amazing. Halsey took Reznor's moody feels and brought it into a new life of it's own ❤
Where did her eyebrows go
Haven't gotten chills like this listening to music since NIN Downward Spiral
So keep your heart, cause I already got one!!! ooohhhh me encanto la letra y sus tomas cubierta con alguna tela son preciosas!
Satanic as f***. The symbolism is blatant. She sold her soul for this.
YAASSSS QUEEEEENN!!!!!!
She’s the most beautiful human being I’ve ever seen inside and outside
Speaking of the title, bruh don't get it twisted, women want love *and* power. Actually they want literally everything. If you gave them a star they'd be eyeing a galaxy
I love Halsey very much💖
This is perfect. ❤️❤️❤️
✨6th day of this song✨  me : so im early ? 😁  tht 5.4 million people : nah 😎  me : sob 🥺
Bu kadın neden her zaman iyi şeyler yapıyor ağlicammmm çok güzelsin 💗🥺😭
Разрубаю всякую ложь и блуд во имя Иисуса Христа🙌❤️🙌
Log I can’t stop with this album I’ve never related so much
Me bachpan me aise gane ko tv pr dekh kr hilaya kr ta tha 🙂..
Does a voice sound like this?  ￼
She is a woman and a god.
Halsey can be my God any day
“But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.” ‭‭2 Peter‬ ‭2:1‬ ‭KJV‬‬ Pls repent and get right to God before it’s too late. This is the same reason why Satan fell out of heaven because he wanted to be God and how man and God relationship was ruin because they wanted to be God. Please don’t be like them sin makes us fall short of Gods glory 🙏🏽✝️❤️
This is such a new concept and I live for it!  It's amazing how they came up with this idea of the music and music video.
🛐🛐
Man When people don't study the basic fundamentals.
wowww 👏
Then I need your blessings 🪤
SHES AN ICON SHES ALEGEN AND SHE IS THE MOMENT
Okay was not a fan of Halsey music (but i like the woman), but with Trent and Atticus it’s amazing! Really addictive!
Don't be a girl ,be a women..💜💜
Mom: You can't fall in love with a song! Me: I did 😬
Ahhh I love her ❤️❤️
Best person Every
Satan will never win.
Damn you have no idea of how proud I am of this woman right here ❤️
Came here because of Trent and Atticus......staying here because of halsey. Halsey is bold for taking such a risk. Definitely became a halsey fan.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ✨HER✨
THIS!!! This is so empowering
This mv is so aesthetically pleasing!!
Ridiculous. Y'all really think you're a god 🙄. 🚫🚫🚫🚫
Halsey..quiza no entiendas mi comentario..pero cada cancion que sacas es un gran honor de escucharlas..son fabulosas, el detras que publicaste tambien fue de maravilla es genial el trabajo que le po es me encanta tu perspecticva de ver las cosas, eres inspiracion de muchas
Amo
This video gives me a very "womanly version of The Perfect Drug," aesthetically. I love this shit.
Your just a women. Such disgrace to refer to yourself as God or a god even if it’s metaphorical
2 of my favorite artists in 1 album=heaven to my ears  Thank you!!!!! 🖤🤟😎
This album should be turned into a Hollywood film omg i am in loveee 🤩🤩🤩🤩🔥🔥❤❤
It deserves so much recognition that I can't even describe
niceeeeee
She needs help.
The modern narcissistic woman. Stupidly believing herself to be the center of the universe. She has the depth of a wading pool.
Love Halsey 💕
I don't get it. I feel so dark and evil in this music video. A woman is a creature not a god.
She is a goddess, it's true
No you're my sweet girl and Trent still has guns 😂 hey homies. Love you.
Depeche mode style.......canzone molto bella👍⚡🎸
sama kaya fir'aun ngaku-ngaku Tuhan...
💓❤️💓
Whatever Trent and Atticus touch turns into gold. Not to undermine Hasley. Far from it. This collaboration is stellar. But Trent, man... he's a musical genius.
👍LIKE👍
0:28
OMG YES
Pure blasphemy
I ADORE HALSEY. She is always next level. How does someone continually outdo themselves?!
Fucking fire
Music like shit, only makes gossip
Increíble disco, uno de los mejores del año, en mi canal le dediqué un video/análisis en español por si se quieren pasar.✌🏾
🤍❤️🤍❤️🤍
You just outdid yourself!!!!
Mediocre
This def entering one if those “entering the villains castle” yadyadyada lolol ❤️
The best singer 🖤🗝️
I love the watchmen meets HTDA meets bubblegum vibe
Halsey : i am not a woman. I'm a god Ariana : bruh, god is a woman Chakka : I'm every woman.. it's all in me... Doja : woman.. woman.. woman.. Katy : that's why i kissed a girl Billie : whatever, I'm a bad guy. Duh
Loubna abidar ❤️❤️
The fact that a person has the audacity to say I'm not a woman, I'm a GOD.  This fallen creation is coming to a end even quicker then i thought.
Omg You're so talented and creative
This song is absolutely INCREDIBLE!!!!!! This has made me so excited!!!! This is what we needed!!!!!!!!! I’m so happy and proud of you Halsey! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
...and then, an anthem for women was born.
Been a fan of NIN for 18 years and a fan of Halsey for 4 years. Heard this song on Spotify for the first time the other day and thought Wow...sounds very Nine Inch Nails-esque. Then I found out Trent produced the album and immediately had to listen to the whole album. I was not disappointed!! Been listening to it on repeat for the last two days XD Love it when some of my favourite artists colab!
I love this song and she is beautiful
Good to hear reznor coming through
❤️❤️
I want more of this so much
Good lord Was thinking about her and this just popped up in my recommendations, to say that I feel blessed to get to be watching this is a big understatement in itself, she really does give the godly vibes.
Let’s not give Trent all the credit, Halsey has always had painfully honest and creative lyrics that cut right through you and a hauntingly rebellious vibe to her music.  “Experiment on Me” and this song have to be my favorites from her so far.
how women think these days
Daddy's Little Princess when no one gives an f.
I cant stop listening
Your not a God please
this song is so good !!
I love you so so much and this album is so close to my heart. You're the best and you know it :*
wow
MASTERPIECE YA OLCEM SIMDI YOU ARE GOD
I’ve felt goosebumps on my skin from the beginning to the end of this masterpiece video ✨🙌
Girl wowowowowowowow
does anyone know where I can watch the movie? I'm from India, and I can't find it anywhere
I'm not a woman I'm a god❤👑
The Music video is good but the music itself is not.
Yes, SHE REALLY IS GOD 🔥😍❤️
She is definitely not a God
Oh honey that’s ok you’re not a god silly until you can raise someone from the dead then can you be God 😎
Amei você 😍
This song gives me GOOSEBUMPS!! The bass is AWESOME too. ☯️☮️☦️❤️‍🔥
god is a woman>>>
Me encantó!!
Did she wrote Haylor song?
Where are her eyebrows?
Someone make TikTok of these album already so this can blow up and rise up to the top. These album deserve to reign in Grammys, charts, awards and everyone's playlists! Share it talk about it, dance or lip sync to this in tik tok. Let's do word of mouth guys!
Kinda cringe ngl
biologically you are a woman and to be a god it needs to be both omnipotent and omniscient.... what I mean is that it's impossible to be a god but oh well nothing wrong with believing
Straight dude here who felt “boss babe empowered” after I finished this album 😂 amazing songwriting and vocals by Halsey that are accompanied the outstanding production from Trent and Atticus. This is my favorite project of 2021 so far!
Bloke here who is clearly out of touch with modern music (old bloke!), but having just watched this with my daughter, I am blown away! This is bloody fantastic and the video is super-high-end! A convert has been found! ! ! !
I love it dam I'm obsessed with this 😍😍😍😍😍
Enişte türk gözünü seviyim altyazı koysaydın keşke
Of course this is the house of NiN
I LOVE everything this woman creates. She is a true artist and so inspirational as a person. I became a fan when I heard Without me. Been a hardcore fan everyday since. :)
This is my headcanon for Padme and her handmaidens lol  Utterly amazing video and song! Breathtaking.
When I see lovers' names carved in a tree, I don't think it's sweet. I just think it's surprising how many people bring a knife on a date
Puny god has no eyebrows
Halsey sempre entregando
Listen to revers music it have Black satan massege she is elominat we knowwwwwww😑😑😑🤮
I see a lot of Byzantine influence in this video. Empress Theodora, Irene, or Zoe are we? All had power in their own way - on their own terms.
Badlands Halsey *is a young god*  If I can’t have love, I want power Halsey *is a full blown god*
So the vid is dope but the song is ammm idk
Trent w/ fem vox always slaps.
TE AMO DIOSAAA.
Who is also from india
Satanic!!
I can feel Nine Inch Nails in this song…
Lesbian love is good if they are hot but if they are not then it is very very bad.
I don’t find this to be a good song. Thanks for being interested in my comment.

CHILLS
FUCKING HELL WOW QUEEN
I know so many things that no one else wants to know.
I haven’t bought a CD by a female artist since Florence’s Ceremonials. I don’t buy any CD unless I like 95% of the songs or it’s a complete concept LP.  THIS, Halsey’s LP If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power, is masterful and artistic.  The lyrics are mind-blowing and poignant. Every song tells a story and takes you on a journey. You must listen to the whole LP in order. I can’t wait to see the film. I’m so excited because I haven’t been this obsessed with a female voice since the first time I heard Lungs LP.  Go listen and buy this LP.
This is beautiful.

*"You're not a God, you're a woman."*
Woman
😳👍🏽👍🏽🤷🏽‍♂️
Cool music videos but I don’t find this song good at all. The music sounds almost ripped from The Weeknd, like save your tears type of feel, and the lyrics are just boring and weird
Lifelong NIN fan and I love Trent and Atticus soundtracks…. Never heard Halsey before and this is INSANE my miiiiiind is blooooown
Solid.
Someone's biological clock is  Tic taken.
Everything Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross touches sonically is gold! 🔊🔥
God Awful
Se mamó
I wish I could hit a love button a million times!
this is so breathtaking i’m so obsessed
Brilliant.
Trying to justify this blasphemous behavior by showing her first holy communion picture is a typical atheist move.
Halsey  quuen
Leaving this comment here so anytime anyone likes it I can watch this masterpiece again
This video gives me Perfect Drug vibes and that makes sense....
One of the characteristics of God is that he does not die and you will surely die... the song is not successful.  من صفات الاله انه لايموت وانت حتما ستموتين  ..ال اغنية لست موفقة فيها
Impressive work, Very catchy it was a great choice to collaborate with Trent and Atticus expecting Grammy wins
😭👏💜💜 i really love it
Amazing amazing 💕💕,,,,
Amazing
I mean they said it themselves, they aren't a woman, they're a GOD
yk what ima just..
What is wrong with people in this generation? Blasphemy and lust.
world is yours
NIN can't even save this crap
fun fact: she isnt god 😱
Racista
Lyrics: Turn on subtitles🙄
Me gusta la producción del audio pero no me gusta el vídeo. Porque es racista. Y se nota mucho.
God is a woman
I’m just wondering why she has no eye brows 🤷🏻‍♀️
album of the year, thats it
🙌🏻❤️
go to India
Almost
Is the beat from NIN?
Army's
Everything about this Album is insane
Sure are a lot of minority women in subservient roles to this white woman.
Very cool🔥🔥👏👏👏
As a fan of both pop and NIN I gotta say this album is AMAZING! I'm an official Halsey fan. Her vocals and lyrics take the music to the next level. Go buy it all. And this video totally captures a real baroque grotesque pop beauty that's perfect with the music. Kudos!
🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐
you´re so fucking amazing!
Halsey please just reject me so I can move on

God is Jesus Christ. And He cares for you. He knows you. He loves you. And He will wait till the end of your days for you to allow Him to help you and show you the light. He died for you to live forever.
i love this one
This is awesome!! And loving the new album! Easier Than Lying is SO GOOD!!! 🔥🔥🔥
What is this false idolatry bullshit 😂
Trent Reznor is also a god
Anybody watching this years later on the exact day it came out, reply to this comment so I can come back to this song every year once it’s a legend.
When people ask you if you’re god, you say YES
Damn Halsey, that's a good song.
I've been waiting so long for this to release! I'm so happy 😊 its everything I hoped it would be, Halsey all they way with some growth along the way, as it should be, music should always reflect the growth one goes through in life, it can only be felt by the musicians who write their own music, not to say that others don't have value, im just saying you can hear a difference, im here for that difference and she knows how to deliver it ♥️👌
الله يوفقك والمزيد من النجاح يااطيب وأجمل إنسانه فى العالم ❤🇺🇸✋
dam girrlllll the beat sounds nice i dint usally click on ads that ae music on yt but this sounds good
Her voice but video🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
SHE'S INSANE I CAN'T FIND ANYTHI NG TO SAY...
I feel like they put their heart in this album and it's beautiful
Love it ❤️❤️💕

Listening in loop. Halsey + NIN = Perfection.
Every time I wonder how her music could possibly get any better - she reveals another layer of her creative genius.
How cute. Elon Musk's wife wrote a song that admits she married for money.
As mothers, we bring life to this planet, we decided to let semen be more than just slime and yet we are a problem, a martyr, and yet we are rejected and even accused of witches just for being brave, we face ourselves, putting our lives at risk just for bring another and be able to feel something of such an indolent world to which we live and the little love that religion imposes on the origin of our existence CREATOR OF LIFE A GOD. ME THIS SONG ♥ (halsey always so deep and artistic) 10/10 *
las madre traemos vida a este planeta decidimos dejar que el semen sea mas que una simple baba y aun así somo un problema un mártir y aun así somos desechadas y asta acusadas de brujas solo por ser valientes enfrentarnos a nosotras poniendo en riesgo nuestra vida solo solo por traer otra y poder sentir algo de tan indolente mundo al que vivimos y el poco amor que la religión impone al origen de nuestra existencia CREADORA DE VIDA UN DIOS .AME ESTA CANCION ♥(halsey siempre tan profunda y artistica )10/10 *
This feels like how  Aphrodite lived

Wow, if women from the past able see how powerful women are becoming today. I'm thankful that Eve convinced Adam to eat the apple even if it's mythology. I feel like it's ancient greek and egypt culture is coming back in our time. Its addictive song. I hope more songs are coming out like this!
She got a point, she is an icon, she is a legend and SHE IS THE MOMENT. Come on now.
Holy voice ♥️
Halsey you voice so beatfull🥺❤️❤️

I can't stop listening to this song ❤❤
Respect every women pleaaeee😭
Todo lo que tuvimos que hacer sin tenernos en cuenta durante la historia, cuando lo fuimos todo, I'm not  a woman I'm a god
Astaghfirolah ya lklba
i want a movie.
THATS FUCKİNG GOOD
Duh judulnya
Halsey is the less famous less attractive and less interesting version of Kanye West.
Can anyone explain the cuff and collar
God is man feminist. Hate to brake it too you. But keep up the bs it’s only making men stronger. Eventually we will be forced to be how we were before and then it’s game over. 😘✌🏻

Hasley isn't a human she is a god
All these toxic NIN fanboys in the replies really about to make me go "yeah Idk who Trent last name Atticus is"
Can't we appreciate how beautiful she is ?!?
My 😇 angel
I used to love you Halsey, I respect you, im not sure after song, and even cant figerout how you god with swimming pall naked or all those girls around you, however we all know you and all the would together can to not be close to God, please report this to Ariana. #god-need-respect
Tapi sopan kah bgtu lu ngtd
This is addictive... I really feel bad when songs like this doesn't get the required recognition.. i want this to blow up..
Where the fuck did her eyebrows go? Social distancing????
why do good songs be underrated these days...
The fact she did this music video whilst pregnant is disturbing its sick, she's sick and you lot thinking this is normal you're  SICK!!!! Bunch foooking weirdos.
You are NOT A GOD,you are a WOMAN AND A HUMAN LIVING ON EARTH, God be with you
6.2k people have no taste
I’m ready for all the Christian to come and canceling her lol 😂
You are not g O d but d O g
Uno de los mejores videos que he visto
Ariana Grande: God İs A Women Halsey: I am not a Women, I’m a God  Pls duettt
Yesterday I hurt my finger because of a door...and I screamed I'm not a woman I'm a God at the door. I hope it acts as an example as to how much I love this song.
Şarkının ismi bile ne kadar saçma
The modern Mona Lisa…
Wow
GOSHHHHH
im not a sippi i am pablo
walking down the street ...someone calls me ..hey woman!  me : Iam not a woman..iam a god!!!
Queennn
Honestly this album was so much better than expected. It might be one of Halsey's bests if not the really best. It felt truly cohesive and not really down lows
Goosebumps
I'M NOT A WOMAN, I'M A GOD
THIS IS ICONIC, LOVE U SO MUUUUUUCH
Oh I can HEAR Trent’s involvement in that ending instrumental. POWERFUL.
LOVE this <3
Too grandiose because you are not god.  🤦
The truth behind the trinity "god the father, the son, the holy spirit" is in fact God the father the son and the mother.  Just a switch from the earliest historical falsifications autodafés and cultural appropriation.
I'm impressed. This is actually dope.
HALSEY GOD
Now this, this is different.
Halsey you’re not even a respectable woman, what makes you think you could ever pull of the status of “god” lmfao.
This is Czech castle Křivoklát 😍 So beautiful.
Welcome to the part of-- Dajjalic society.
So God is not a Woman after all
Nice
Ariana did it why can’t she do it too🤷🏽‍♀️
Love the Nine Inch Nail vibes!! Killing it!
Halsey taught us what you have to take advantage of all the opportunities life gives you. So if you're pregnant, Don't limit yourself and use it to your advantage.
Beautiful, love u Halsey
Astaghfirullah
Damn Trent Reznor is the man
This is masterpieces💜⁉️
I feel like I just astral projected for three minutes. I blinked and then the video was over. I watched it *twice* and I’m not sure I actually watched it
Sht! Mura ra siyag cut² nga movieeee! LOVE IT!!!!
I’m suddenly pregnant
the harmonies  doesn't work.
god damn this is good. Its like if NIN had a daughter.
I would like to see this as a movie
getting over everything, I missed NIN, I love this album, Thank you Halsey for this masterpiece ♥️♥️♥️♥️
ТОЛЬКО ВЧЕРА услышал этот трек, а сегодня уже тащусь от него, просто сами послушайте https://youtu.be/CJd-z7-B_IY
Youre not God btw
*Check out the whole album! All songs are soo good!*
Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross do an magnificent job!
I'm a god
PERFEIÇÃO.
Not even close to a god. More like absolute  trash. Song is trash also!!
the fact they made this masterpiece while being PREGNANT is so incredible bc of everything they had to deal with due to it, and shows you that halsey is one of the best and strongest artists out here, argue w the wall
Didn’t know there was a new season of Game of Thrones!!
i want easier than lying and honey music videos too
Melhor música de todos os tempos 😍😍👏👏👏
this is art
😂😂😂       Pathetic

Self deceived
Shows the depravity . The condemned...on their way to hell
Lol

*I am not a legend, I’m a frog*  -Halsey 2021
If I man made this same song, would it be so well received?
amazing
The high note was so catchy, that after hearing the song advertised so many times, I went from disliking to enjoying. How the industry brainwashes me into obsessing over other simple songs. Lol
I love you Halsey, your voice is so beautiful and your songs are🔥
This deserves more Recognition
38 seconds in you see women's nipples thats, I don't know what that's about  but song is beautiful
a god? really? lol
A MAIOR!!!!!!
Trent brought me here, AND I'M STAYING 🤍
IS this a music video? if its not idk but i wish i could watch the movie but i cant cause my mom will get mad for me buying it.
Try actually having no one. You wouln't be singing.
This song is terrible. What key even is this? Is this even a key?
This is the track with heavy Trent and Atticus involvement - Like that Synth sound is totally from the 'I Can't Give Everything Away' cover from the Bowie Black Star album
*Goddess  God is to king Goddess is to Queen
I luv it soooo much
i actually really really like this song
Whoah. Wow.
❤️On fire🔥
sí totalmente halsey sos una leyenda
Disgusting that trent worked with this
lmaoo i was sitting here like whoever produced this is really leaning into that trent reznor territory but sure enough
MGK hit it too hard, she ain't right.
Album of the fucking year forsure💣
amazing!
Halsey can write a billion songs and I can’t even write a damn sentence. Oh wait. NVM.
Dang I kinda dig this, and I'm an old metalhead
Perfect i love the concept so much
Self worshiping bullsh!t🤮🤮🤮
What is genetic inlaid or reorchestrated transferred intelligence is it a mental duplicate or actually the being I side with Mental duplicate charge explain mostly because I don’t like frauds
This is so sick and sadistic this world is falling apart
GIRL YES??? HELLO??? GO SPIT FACTS QUEEN!
Dios mío uno de los mejores álbumes del 2021 gracias por esta maravilla
I'm confused with the eyebrow situation. Are they dyed or shaved? Song is a bop
This deserves at least 500,000,000 views. Like if you agree👍
Love you SO much Halsey!!!!❤️❤️❤️ #IANAWIAG #IICHLIWP
No u are an woman
But u are a woman?
You do know Power is ability right
Come through Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross. Getting them to produce this album was a stroke of genius. Certainly created a mood totally different than the other pop music out there right now. Loving this album!
00:54 should’ve moved the camera down
I am not less gay.
This is the new fashion runway theme song.
The fact that none of you realize this is stupid is beyond me.
Nine inch nails vibes Trent Reznor is a genius the album is so great , I just discovered this artist and she's amazing .
Perfect.♥️
Love~
I thought this is a movie trailer at first lol.
NIN!!!!!!
I love you so much the further you get in your career the better you get you're so amazing
‘I have said you are “gods” ’ (Jesus), so we are all gods. Halseys sophomore voice is given by the one we all ve never seen
Super
mirror mask...
THIS IS SO ADDICTING
I had a world of respect for this WOMAN  Then she soled her soul  I'm good with this bitch
حلوه بس بيها كفران كومه😕🤣
Omggg definitely can hear the NIN influence! Amazing.
Halsey I love all your songs and you are so talented and yup here’s another of your beautiful creations amazing and congratulations and your baby .
https://youtu.be/e7ql1uIJ8Ko
https://youtu.be/e7ql1uIJ8Ko
Damn straight! A literal goddess
♥️♥️😍🔥🔥🔥
This is a masterpiece
Trent, Atticus and the NIN association will result in this woman's music being instantly listened to by a whole load of people who yearn for Trent's production style. I'm amongst them and I like what I'm hearing so far.
REPUTATION IS OFFICIALLY REBORN
This is HTDA lite. This is a good thing but it would be better if it was darker.
Is no one else paying attention to the fact that SHE literally calls HERSELF  a fraud?
Songs trash I only came here for the bathing part and decided to hear the rest and it was just repetitive
Man, I've never listened to Halsey before, her new album popped on Spotify and I was like okay, I just woke up so why not and I was like this is actually cool, but I know this sound... now I come here and read that Trent Reznor is one of the people behind it. ngl now I like this even more lmao
EXCUSE ME??
What kind of shit song is this
Gotta be the most evil thing I've seen in a long time. Came over here from the comment sections of Spencer Smith talking about how the woman is rising. In the wrong way.
Aw, come on! This deserved 1M 👍🏽
Song is good - but the singing is mostly like every female vocalist in the past 15 years And the level of wokeness / pretentiousness is off the charts
God doesn't give birth to you. A woman does.  Bicker with the sky
This whole album so powerful 🤯🤯🔥🔥🔥
If ur not hearing this ur honesty missin out...
simply awesome. I love my new ringtone i love Halsey my god
Nine Inch Halz
Didn't get the video
Hello god. So i was sad today.
I don’t get why they use so much auto tune, like, she can actually sing, why fuck with her voice so much?
Halsey ficou linda nesse clipe! A batida da música me parece repetitiva e igual a outras, também me parece que tenta se adaptar aos novos estilos musicais teen que estão surgindo (legal), ou seja, deixando ela mais atual; A voz da Halsey é maravilhosa desde sempre, o refrão ficou ótimo, dá pra fazer altos tiktoks com ele. E o clipe tem várias referências, ficou ótimo também!
legend
Halsey tiene uno de los rostro más hermosos de la industria musical.
Armyyyyy where are youuuu 😁💜🇩🇿
i heard there is this conflict for the No1 bewteen kaney..... say no more fam swifties got your back
To be in a human body, and think you a god😐😐…………bro the idolatry in music and videos in society is rising. People making themselves gods or making objects their gods and are proud of it. One day, all evil and sin will end. The true God is giving everyone a chance to turn and accept his ways, Jesus Christ’s ways, and people just keep running towards the fire.
Nice!😉💝
My new drug
Anti Christ
What a trash song!!!!! Worse album of your entire career …… disappointing. Women women women women …. Wtf ????? Really Halsey?!!! you must be a lesbian. make real music please. Fans here very disappointed. No more Halsey. We are in different times… if we don’t like it you fail ….
Unparalleled artist. Get those Grammys, girl ❤️
you'll never be a god in this slow universe you can never have everything you would want out of life like unlimited computation at your finger tips
This album shows just how versatile Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross really is. They can work with anyone and make a phenomenal hit.
Sad to see all the clueless comments below. You have so much wool covering your eyes...
Just another Luciferian getting sucked into the seduction of wealth and materialism and psychosis
O único defeito é que acaba
I find the title a bit redundant. God, Woman, same diff 😏  Halsey kills me every time she breaks up with her eyebrows. Thats her most toxic relationship.
She can’t make a bad song 🙂
VICIADO NESSA MÚSICA MEU DEUS
The Great Song ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Britney Spears—I’m not a girl,not yet a woman (2002) Ariana Grande—god is a woman (2018) Halsey—I not a woman, I’m a god (2021).
oh no, i like the music.....
Бляяяя у него на канале очень много прикольных треков, просто сами послушайте https://youtu.be/TAzu05FIbu8
That NIN sound! Wow, Beautiful!
This is not a song it's masterpiece She's not  just a singer she's an angel
Ariana Grande: God Is A Woman Halsey: I am not a Woman, I’m A God
This is the most accurate title I've seen in a while. You are a god indeed.
Restores your faith in the power of music once again. Incredible.
Klibe asik oldum gercekten, o kadar guzel bi atmosfer veriyor ki... Albumun mukemmel oldugunu soylememe gerek yok diye dusunuyorum
O álbum é uma obra de arte, essa música é incrível. Halsey a artista que entrega tudo ☆
Iv been waiting patently for Halsey return and as always she fails to disappoint 💕
What was worse was when Ariana Grande made the song, “God is a woman”. Some people, feel so huge. And feel as if they can straight up disrespect the creator of the universe with no karma. I don’t care if you don’t believe in God our father, because what we do and don’t believe as people does not define what is truthful. He is real, and he is your lord. This is factual. But think what you will, just watch what you say. Because what if your wrong? Then what?
I LOVE THIS ALBUM
Genius
It was so good🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌
Ariana Grande was right! God is a woman!
Oooo purchase It was great as always Queen Halsey
Satanic
I love this song 💜🖤
She can't be god. I am god.
Good 🎶
That beat progression is 🔥

At least admit your a fraud appreciate that
I am stuck on this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Aside from this song, I love the song "YOU ASK FOR THIS" Check out now!
Let's go to the Hot 100 charts!!
I fucking love her!! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
This song is for all the women of the world 💙 thank youuuu 🇹🇷

Fucking masterpiece
Religious Fanatics and Liberals be going nuts in the comments.😵

SHe is a Satan worshipper. WAKE UP PEOPLE
I was feeling sad but then I dicovered that I shared the same birthdate as Halsey. SEPTEMBER 29 here

Goddess of mind altering music...love love love
Gonna get massacred here but aside from the interesting video there is NOTHING here in terms of music. It's not catchy, doesn't groove much, is completeley forgetable. Even the production/mix is strange... the vocals are like behind the music. Overall very disapointing.
And what about men?
Tell me what's wrong with being a woman and be whatever you want? Wtf  wrong with this generation and the sex ideology
I'm a god 💃
this is so good
Почему о нем никто не знает, треки делает афигенние, просто сами послушайте https://youtu.be/TAzu05FIbu8
😂😂😂🤣🤣
Al Jourgensen must be so pissed right about now...MINISTRY has new record coming out but Halsey's new record trumps the fuck out of his new stuff 🙄😒
This one is gonna be #1 on billboard singles chart for many weeks
It be so cool to hear a shoegaze cyberpunk metal version of this song...like make it super fucking heavy 🦾🎯🎙🌊
Literally the best song ever everyone can go home now halsey DID IT 🔥😍👑💅❤
This Music is so powerful that it echoes how far the women can  go to achieve things. She is limitless, if she is not respected nurtured with love, sky is the limit for her power by agony. God is a women.
I know you're a god. What's new?
Ariana : You'll believe God is a woman Halsey : I m not a woman ,I'm a God
When you give birth for the first time and it hit hard
0:52 I absolutely lost it. Clearly a genuine reaction to cold ass water. LOL
No, your a woman.
Omggg
I expected from Halsey only to give us such a banger album which she worked on during her pregnancy...
how does this video so perfectly capture the idea that your empowerment comes from all the experiences and chaos that have made up your life up to that moment
Dude that Trent Reznor influence. 😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰
Yea I said it I bet Nicki Minaj 50,000$ she do a remix if I won that would be amazing but I ain't got that money but I'm counting on a remix
Trash
❤️
Such an amazing album. Trent and Atticus knew exactly how to work with Halsey
Aşkım
Choose Halsey as your lord and saviour.
Jesus is coming. Are you ready? Stop living in sin, and repent of your sins. Jesus said, if you love me keep my commandments. You can be saved by grace through faith in Jesus, but you have to stop living in sin.
Those who disliked the videos are just sick.
I love them and this album is amazing
Exactly Halsey!! This is great! I love it
HER POWER IS EVERYTHING!!!
You are not a woman but you are a clown
Halsey's baby boy 1st video... Masterpiece...
I hope she releases the movie online someday!
Trent and Atticus make everything Genius
The people that disliked this song should get covid tests done, because one of the major symptoms is no taste.

"I am not a woman, I'm a God"  FALSE. We are all filthy sinners who need God. Please turn to him now
Fuck. The album is a masterpiece. Thank you for giving birth to the album. I fucking love u so much.
The fact they made this masterpiece while being PREGNANT is so Incredible and shows you that halsey is one of the best and strongest artists, *argue w the wall*
Like a girl version of Nine Inch Nails, Trent's still making great things happen!
Evil
✨Nice song!💯 love frm India🇮🇳 kerala✨

This masterpiece is driving me crazy.. I am on repeat. 😍😍😍😍
Art is a word and this album is the definition
Halsey is back!
Can we take a moment to appreciate the sound I.e another TRENT REZNOR & ATTICUS ROSS masterclass.. Halsey is a lucky woman to get their sample beats 😧
U got to respect someone that puts out different music and doesn’t just follow the crowd… if u listen closely u can hear nine inch nails influence
She is so amazing. Her poetry, her music, her soul, all stunning. She shines so brightly. Add 2 other legends and you get something legendary. Awesome album. I can't stop listening to it.
Masonic Ritual?
Autism is powerful!
Meh
This is paganism
Can we talk about how she looks like Feyre...
Then you’re for me, the Pheonix of 93 ;P looking good Babalon.
Wheres her eyebrows
Holy fuck! I think my brain is broken
Wow
Ridiculous  !
Sorry, I am a MAN and I am GOD
EU QUERO GRITAR ESSA MÚSICA PRA SEMPREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE POHAAAAAAAAAAA ÚNICAAAA
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dude when I saw this pop up on my Spotify feed that its a new release I just had to watch the music video on here just so I can listen to this amazing song and watch the awesome story being told
I am Swiftie I am so proud of Halsey this album is so good and I didn't came here because of Taylor story cause I already listen this album when it's released and it's just wow so proud of her I was so sure that Taylor would post about this album in her story  and show support to halsey cuz it's just amazing
Here you go young ladies. Your newest skank to look up to.
Title sounds a bit cocky
طب ليه الالحاد ده يفنانه
Surreal ❤❤
lol this is what rich people ACTUALLY huizenga i mean believe
I’m just happy the music is not the typical moronic trap crap.
Love the Way "god" is written in lowercase
she never said she IS GOD she said she is A GOD guys this is incredibly annoying how these female artists put this shit out i dont like it sorry im not even super religious being a female powerhouse is amazing but calling yourself some kind of god because u got lucky and got a record deal nah honey nah
“YOU NEED DICKS!!” said Julius Caesar.
no!like im absessed😢💜
How can a woman not be a god when she is an instrument of creating life 🌼
Ariana: God is a woman Halsey: I'm not a woman I'm a God
Definitely has the Trent sound. Love it
It's so fucking good omg I wanna bathe in this song foreverrr
God is God who  create this universe and there is just one God ... Women isn't a god it is  just One of the things that God created ..
U R AMAZING
Album of the year
PERFEITAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Confused that Halsey  have long or short hair!?
he is lying to you Ashley.
Legendary!!!

Trent Reznor only reason i'm checking this out  ..
;;
Halsey + NIN = ❤️❤️❤️ It’s just awesome and perfect. I Liked her without me like most but this album just blew me away.
I’m a god….? Really lmao gtfo of here what has she contributed to the world? Seriously, besides standing in a booth and opening her mouth
Yo where her eyebrows tho
After watching hbos watchmen and pixars soul, I was pretty excited to hear Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross in this album
🔥🔥🔥
OMGGG this is a masterpiece
So much ritualistic and occult symbolism here yikes…
comparing your self to god is a sin
3 DAYS WHO'S STILL LISTENING TO THIS MASTERPIECE
Satanic Rituals trying to normalize evil and sacrilege. Stop the NWO Entertainment brainwashing subservience of the masses agenda. Extremely toxic repetitive message.
This album is a masterpiece
oh :{
Ностальгия по статусам в контакте: "Все бабы как бабы, а я богиня!"
thats my baby and im really proud
I feel so strong listening to this incredible song. Yes, ı am not a woman, I am a god.
Sounds like Cyberpunk 2077 songs, love it
I love this music what about you guys ?
So good
I like this.
Incredible how much symbolize in one video. The gods of this world seeking attention trough any means possible as their time is running short, but they know themselves that they are nothing but a fraud. Their dark power is coming to an end as the true living God is preparing to reclaim what is rightfully his and bring end to the dark kingdom.
Meh nothing special. Sounds like every other pop artist. Just marketing hype
✨
What I see is the contradiction between obtaining female power and yet still being treated as an object, as less than. To some people, no matter what you achieve, no mater who you are, no matter how much money you earn or what you can buy, no matter your position of authority, if you present as a woman, you are weak. Women and femme presenting non-binary people feel that, every day. They look at their accomplishments, at their glory, and feel, as Halsey said, like a fraud.
Never had such a vibe in a song
why is this so underated!
Up there with Antichrist Superstar as one of the most unique Nine Inch Nails albums.
Oh my halsey!
Good as always queen 👑
PERFECT
Eii, saa? Wony3 nipa, woy3 bosom?❤❤
It suits my mood this time .... i love " I'm not a women, I'm GOD " !!
Me siento decepcionada del album. Las canciones son hermosas, sí. Pero tanta promocion en instagram me hizo pensar que todas las canciones tendrian video y solo tuvo video la primera cancion. No estoy diciendo que no entienda la situacion de su embarazo y todo el asunto del COVID. Pero si van a promocionar maquillaje y vestuario increible, aclaren que es solo para la primera cancion y ya. Me siento engañada.
I got major nin - closer vibes when I first heard this
this is so fucking brilliant!!!!
this a nice up beat song loves to this queen
I love Halsey
She ain’t Jesus 🤣
The Trent Reznor sound is strong.
Ariana: God is a women  Halsey: i’m not women i’m god <3
I'm subscribed to #HALSEY for full alerts and didn't get a notice that a new video was posted! What's up YouTube #TomMcDonald your not the only one!
This music is definitely giving me stranger things vibes. I love it. This is a banger!!
I  felt so nervous because of my first year at university. But now I know I can deal with it. Thank you, Halsey! Love you
her lip injections are subtle but look natural. definitely different from her 2015/2016 version
Pls where can I watch the movie online?I need to watch her masterpiece 😭
Sıradakı ezberlenmesi gereken şarkı
❤
I need a extended film about this videoclip.
😍😍😍😍😍
Astaghfar allah, but the song is GOOD
Okay this is my new best song now.. 🥺💕
Ağlıyorum çok güzel
This is the first Halsey song I have ever heard and it effin’ SLAPS.
AMAZING  Best song and best woman
HINO
Loved it❤️
No
poop
Easily a HTDA track… love ya Trent
I want more ✨
So Hot ♥️ GOD IS A WOMAN
I'm addicted
Why must women now be demonized to feel confident to be themselves?, Which, when not being distorted by sickos, is far more beautiful and powerful than any warped fantasies. women are so powerful as to be the whole reason human society exists, and how it matures.
I LOVE YOU HALSEY!!
She is not a woman, is a God
This is gonna be so iconic. The rebellion, you can practically feel it.
I love women
I am not a women. I'm a god. Yessssss 🦋🦋🦋
" I'm better all alone" ...
I love the tradition more to be honest
Bacım allah bir çarpar dümdüz eder
♒
Halsey: I am not a woman, I’m a god   Ariana Grande: God is a woman
My heartbeat is in sync with the beat
Oh, this is the one with the very NIN production. Love that major key arpeggio to the right.
This is my favourite song off the album, Get this to #1 on billboards!!
Incredible visuals🙌🏽 Halsey keeps raising the Bar❤️
A god that just shows lesbianism? Give me a break, dumb people will support anything.
Loved it ❤❤❤❤❤❤
can we take a moment and appreciate the hardwork cause literally it is one of the most beautiful MV of all time
🇦🇱
Halsey looks so powerful and magnificent in this I am just speechless GOD!!!
"keep your heart cause I already got one" DAMN! GOOD!!
We in India God Kalima is a woman
QUEEN !
Oh halsey, that's a no no but I still love your human traits.
Woahh, impressive
Wow ❤❤❤
sometimes we have to hate some people for no reason...
Hamam
such a powerful cinematography
This video is amazing.
Anyone recognizing the sampling of NIN God Given?
No ur not a god ur illuminati bought and sold ur sole 4 fame an fortune
I guess 90% of the viewers came for the tee-tees only, just the remainder liked the song.
Wasted my time
This is blasphemy! Repent of your sin to God and be forgiven.
First off you seem weird and music is basic...the music industry and there image smh
People are completely missing the point to this song. This isn't about empowering anything, it's about her struggles with BP while being pregnant. "I am not a woman but a god, not a martyr, but a problem, not a legend, but a fraud" this is probably one of the best ways to example bipolar disorder. I noticed a lot of people missed the point, just wanted to clear that up.
Okay to whoever did this song. You keep saying you're not a woman you're a God. Here's this thing if you are a female God you would be technically a goddess. There is a difference. When it comes to Norse gods and goddesses. There are the guys and there are the girls. When it comes to Christianity God is God and that's it. There's nothing else. There's no female goddesses in heaven there's just God in Jesus. In Egyptian culture you have the Egyptian gods in the Egyptian goddesses. And other cultures are other gods and goddesses. A female in that is not considered a God she's be considered a goddess. Sorry I have to get technical about this but it's a weird song. And if you're a God you're a guy. If you're a goddess you're female. Famous just the facts. Sorry I had to get technical on this one but it is what it is.
cok gwzellll
ohaaa
oha
No, you’re not. Blasphemous af
Like a movie
still big mad bcos I didn't get to see the IICHLIWP movie ㅠㅠ
Thank you for being in my life almost 6 years ✨💘
Halsey!!! You are god! The themes in the mv and how y'all shot it is so so powerful. This is a legend
This is insane. Just beauty
That scene where she looks into the mirror. You can feel the urge of power. If I can't have love, I want power... you feel it
This video is a whole cinematic experience. All the scenes and the story line is chaotic and beautiful
Oh god i love her🖤
REZNOR IS NOT A MAN, HE IS A GOD <3
Wow this melody is beautiful!
Ariana Grande: God is a woman. Halsey: Crap, she's onto me!
mediocre song, stupid music video, next
Another MASTERPIECE!!
total unadulterated blasphemy.
Halsey ure a legend
I LOVE YOU!!!
loving the album
NAHH HALSEY BE RELEASING BOPS🦋
First was.. Ariana Grande: God is a woman. Now! Halsey: I am not a woman, I'm a God   She knows her worth. 💕
Much like girls run the world this song will be praised on every level even though it sounds terrible with lazy writing because people are showing themselves to be brainwashed by enabling (not empowering) message
OMG
: ต้องใจแข็งขนาดไหนถึงยอมปล่อยคนคนนึงไปได้ ทั้งที่ยังรักมาก
Ok it's time to cancel Halsey she had a good run but it's time for her to go away now
This song is so freakn POWERFUL- love everything about it!!!! ❤❤ **
Okay but how is she so beautiful?
Satanic......... Trash......... Is what. She...... Is.
Your a Queen in deed. Before and after, u will always be our Gueen of Army.
Albüm için yaptığı film ne zman gösterilcek ya!
the only question i have is: why does she have no eyebrows? 😅
thank u ! it’s amazing
lines in the tradition says: "we dress her up in black gowns, they dress her up in golden crowns." and in this video, they literally do just that.
Who is here because of Taylor
“ I’m not a woman I’m a god” smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
Jesus is waiting for you to come to Him, He won't cast you away from Himself if you come to Him.  He calls us all to repentance, He knocks on the door of our hearts because he loves us and wants to save us. when you do believe and the Holy Spirit will come in and lead you to repent of your sins and God will forgive you of your sins and cleanse you by the blood of Jesus and you'll get born again by His Holy Spirit and have His salvation, you will become a new creation. He is the savior of the world and he can save you, no sin is too great no mountain is too high, for he will come and save you when you call upon his holy name❤  Acts 4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.   2 Peter 3:9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
SUCH A MASTERPIECE !!!!!!!
Stream please 💛🖇️ ..
What do you guys think her album is about? Genuinely curious 🥰  I think it’s about her joining freemasonry and how fucked up it is and how controlled and fucked she got (both physically and mentally). Every celebrity has to join freemasonry to become famous 😇
Is this official video?
If you dig this and your partner doesn't, RUN.
How to marry a song?
Eine unfassbare Vereandlung und dieses Videos mit Hochschwanger zu drehen einzigartig
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💕💛💛💛💛💛💚💚💚💚🧡💙💙❤️❤️
Still not a fan of Halsey’s voice but dammit Trent Reznor created an amazing album. No, I’m not giving Halsey any credit because even she admitted she had no creative say in the album and this album would be way better off with someone like Hayley Williams providing vocals (but we wouldn’t deserve that album).
Incredible. Would love to see the IMAX movie …
It’s really incredible how us women can carry a other human inside our bodies
❤️
I would watch this movie
This is magically awesome.
süper bir şey çıkardın, inanamıyorum çok iyi 🛐🛐
Trent Reznor is a god.
😋😋😋👐👐👐cheers to us 🍻
She is my first and last love 💕💕🚬
SO GOOD
the music and visuals are top tier
4M
Disco...
A culture in decline.
Bayılmak
people on the internet cant keep shit to themselves these days and these comments are proof of that, try making a song and a music video while being pregnant, then come back and say your opinions.
Halsey is so talented she deserves the whole world 💜
Imagine nicki remixing this!  I can hear her screaming - I am a problem
Who came here from Taylor?
Who came here from Taylor?
Why is this an add for me
Hi. I have something important to share. Will you listen?   "As it is written: 'There is no one righteous, not even one.' "- Romans 3:10   "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God"- Romans 3:23   So what does this mean? Well, let's look into it :)   "The Lord has disciplined me severely, But He has not given me over to death." - Psalm 118: 18  The psalmist (the person speaking) is talking about how the Lord has disciplined him. To discipline is to reprimand or punish for a wrongdoing. This shows that the psalmist has sinned before. Therefore, he is not righteous right? It would seem like it, but then the psalmist continues on...   "Open to me the gates of righteousness; I shall enter through them, I shall give thanks to the Lord. This is the gate of the Lord; The righteous will enter through it." Psalm 118:19-20   So now the psalmist is entering the gates of the righteous. Something that only the righteous can do.  How is this possible? How can someone who has sinned be righteous before God? I mean God hates sin how can someone who has sinned be in right standing with him? Well let's find out.   "I shall give thanks to You, for You have answered me, And You have become my salvation." - Psalm 118:21   It is "You" who has become his salvation; "You" has saved him. But how? And just who is this "You" anyway?   The psalmist answers this question by saying "The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief corner stone." Psalm 118: 22   What stone? Jesus. Jesus Christ is "The stone which the builders rejected...." -Psalm 118: 22 for "He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain.  Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised, and we held him in low esteem." Isaiah 53:3   But he has become the most important piece.  Jesus said "I and the Father are one.” - John 10:30  (The father being God) "Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." -John 14:6  For "This Jesus is ‘the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone.’ Salvation exists in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.” -Acts 4:11-12  But wait, we still don't know how Jesus can possibly save us. Let's look into that. As we continue further along in the passage it says, "The Lord is God, and He has given us light; Bind the festival sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar." -Psalm 118:27  The horns of the alter was a symbol of the death of the sacrifice. People would take hold of the horns of the alter to attain mercy. Jesus died on the cross so that we could obtain mercy. He was the sacrifice. Just like the psalmist, we have all sinned, and are deserving of hell. We all fall short, but.... right after Romans 3:23 (the verse that says that we fall short) comes Romans 3:24 " being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus,"   Through Jesus we can be justified and made righteous. Not by doing anything to earn it. Not by working hard enough, or praying enough, or reading/ studying enough, or even because of the good things we do for others or God. Only  through the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross can we appeal to God for mercy and be in right standing with Him. Not that we deserved anything, but as an unearned gift.   Jesus loves every single one of you. (And so does God that's why he sent his son Jesus) That is why he gave up his life for you. He died so that you could be free. The punishment for sin is death. (the second death is hell.) But Jesus died to pay for our sins. "God presented Him as the atoning sacrifice through faith in His blood...." -Romans 3:25  He died for us, but then he rose again. Doing what we couldn't have done, defeating sin and the grave.   Do you believe that you are a sinner in need of a savior? Do you believe in the Good news that Jesus came to die for the sins of the world on the cross (and then rose again/resurrected)? Well then...  "Then he brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, you and your household.”” -Acts 16:30-31  "that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved"  -Romans 10:9   Being saved is just the beginning. Now that you are in right standing with God. You can have a relationship with him. He wants to talk to you. Do you wanna know him? He hears all that you say. ( Tell him everything; your plans, worries, fears, memories, problems, everything.) Read your Bible because that is one of the primary ways that God will speak back. He'll show you who he is. He'll let you find him if you seek him. :) He'll teach you how to live a life in freedom from sin. He'll give you the power to repent. Trust in Him He loves you. ❤❤  Whoa you actually finished? Wow I'm impressed. I mean this is just a YouTube Comment After all. 😅
Amazing omgggg🙏🙏
Great halsey luv u
SHE'S A GOOOD!!! OMG
AND SHES PREGNANT OMG LITERAL QUEEN
the production is INSANE
Amé está canción ❤️ el álbum entero es una obra de arte.
This is masterpiece
Is this song in multiple keys or something? Like, polytonal? The way her voice on those "oh"s clashes with the synth is interesting
This is beautiful
This song is so lame. Music video feels artificial nothing spontaneous about it. Can these artists literally come up with nothing new? How many times will they write the same recycled trash & shove it down your throat, while y’all willingly eat the shit filled spoon whilst obsessing over how great it tastes?? Seriously, the music industry these days has gone downhill & people can’t get enough of this profound rubbish pit we call mainstream music. So disappointing 😕😔
wow😯so powerful🖤🔥
Woaahh
This song live is going to make ppl go absolutely insane
Woman is a god? Yet, everything around was build by man, even this record, even her baby.
i love you halsey
THE QUEEN IS FINALLY BACK!!!😍😍
Swifties always sopport u 🦄❤
Illuminati Confirmed 🤦‍♂️
Who is here because of BTS 💜💜💜
I don’t get it
What is this TRASH? If I wanted to hear the message of Ariana Grande I would go to her page. What happened to original Halsey with her own vibe and message. Disappointment!
The tradition, Girl is a gun & 1121 are my favourites. I loved #IfICantloveIWantPower totally. So proud of you Halsey 😭
I want this to be a full length movie!!
ARTE
she´s a pretty woman she´s a god iloveeee you
the best channel about it https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuLu8s4vXm-S6vGXJoUe8LQ
You are not A God
Ella es la Puta ama de su genero💚💖
Sucks, how did this get so many views?
Dios adoro este arte
❤️‍🔥
te amo
bruhh
This is SO good; I’m ADDICTED!!!!
Let’s stop normalizing calling ourselves gods. Like honestly. This message and video is so demonic & it’s disappointing
Amazing
Astarghfulla 😑
This is stupid. Normally I wouldn't give my opinion but this came up as an advertisement on my YouTube.  It just shows that you have to pay Google to make people listen to your music. This is not the best profession for you.
I cant talk .im done 🖤🖤🖤
Oh my god😻😻
this is gorgeous
PQP MULHERRRRRRRRRRR PERFEITAAAAAAAAAA😍😍😍
Man, Whatever Trent Reznor touches, turns into gold. Halsey did such an amazing job on this album. It’s the perfect blend of darkness and experience.
yb better sadly, this is dogshit.
Perfecta
So, could this be a while movie? Pretty please? 😳
Uh no
Impeccable.
https://youtu.be/mjfT2joaJxs Beautiful disaster ~311
Gandabherunda symbols. Nine Inch Nails. Beauty. ..Yup!! 🖤⛓👍
WHAT A BOP!! LEGENDARY
Destroy me in the hole under my lower back. This is so good I'm crying. Kidding, but I'm here for ever single second of it.
Destroy me in the hole under my lower back please. This is so powerful I'm submissive now. I love it so much I'm crying. Kidding, but it gives me life hahaha
HALSEY YOU FUCKING DID IT! outstanding work! Big big big big big ups to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross! Outstanding production!
OMG
Oh woahb
إستغفر الله شذا الكلام يبنت 🙂
That baby be vibin in the womb!
PERFECT I LOVE U <3
No god is genderless. There's only one god. But I still respect the song
Her album is 🔥
Essa mulher 🛐🛐
❤️
Çocuk doğurunca bir anda gelen tanrı oldum hissi.
"I'm not a woman, I'm a god." Yup, most people feel like that when they collaborate with Trent and Atticus.

This kind of music is what we need today. Wish everyone can listen to this song. 🔥
la instrumental está buena
Legendary song!
Perfect songgg 💖
Halsey is not human, Halsey is an angel
Any fans from London?
She is the definition of an ARTIST.
"Maybe I could be a different human in a new place"  "Maybe I could be a better human with a new name"  I literally think about that everyday.
This album and film feels like her transition from the main character to the mature badass woman everybody always loves more than the main character in movies/books.
:0
This is so perfect , the way she express herself on this unique way is amazing !!! Halsey is a real artist, she don’t need to prove anything to anyone, she just need to do his art !!!
0:34 lol 😂
:34 butt lol
iamamiwhoami
just so everyone knows, the imax version of this song in the movie has a lot more nudity, but youtube is a butt and cant handle nipples
Queen, queen, iconic.
Damn this is a straight stone cold 9 inch beat thats 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
YESH!!!
Me encanta!!
*twerking sacredly
i love her omg
Shit
Dang Trent gonna turn all these zoomers into goths
Such a stupid song
You can just feel the Trent Reznor all over this.
I love her
Teasing god 🤨
I love so much Trent's industrial, but I really can't like that kind of pop vocal...😖😖
I'm  better All alone✨✨✨
OMG!!! 👑💘
3M
I love everything about this song😍🔥🔥🔥
What does it mean
Those layered vocals on the last chorus. Epic
Taylor and Halsey
3M
My new favourite story to talk about😍 So wowww ,so chilling 🔥🥵😍❤️‍🔥
This. Album. Is. Insanely. Perfect.
Honestly, I love how she didn't show her tatas in this one. That's an IMAX only experience. 🤣
Why not both?
Game of Thrones Cersei's revenge
Im gonna get hate for this and I love Halsey i think shes so original. Ive loved every song shes come out with so far but I just dont get this whole album. I dont like one single song on this album. Its all weird af.
I am not a woman, I'm a *broad*
She is not a GOD
Trent Reznor made me stan Halsey.
Rap God is a Man - Eminem - 😂
Theres only one way to heaven John 14:6 i am the way, the truth,and the life no one come to the Father but by Jesus.       A:Admit your a sinner in need of a saviour.   B: Believe god died for your sins, was buried, and rose again.  C:Call upon the name of the Lord and you will be saved.
I'm loving the historical influences for the visuals and this song is such an ear worm, Trent does it every time <3
Halsey got me over here questioning whether or not I’m actually gay…
çocuk doğurunca ben
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaGJunJmI5ayPTWKf2VgAqw/videos
This is the only good song on this album
Ay çok güzel olmuş...
We love woman supporting woman! Such an artistry commitment to taking risks!
FUUUUUUUCKKKKK CHILLS!!!!😭😭😩😭😩😭😭😭 THIS DESERVES A MILLION AWARDS!!!😭😭👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Vim pela taylor
Just go listen to Kanye this  is trash
Jesus is king
she is pop's god
Y
I hate the antichrist
So much devil worship symbolism :( If he’s not real, why do so many pay homage to him?) She sold her soul. So she thinks. Google how many interviews of celebs where they say it outright. Here’s the trick. You cannot sell your soul. You can only sell your devotion to that deal. What you didn’t know is you went into that deal empty handed. You do not own your soul. So you sold your fear of persecution. Guess what? You have a chance to get out of that legally and clean. You don’t own your soul because Jesus Christ died for ALL souls. Every soul that’s ever walked the planet is now owned by the Lord Jesus Christ. But, that doesn’t mean you’re saved from expulsion. You must learn firsthand. Meaning by yourself. That Jesus Christ took on all of the essence of sin. And killed it. Because He simply is God but hung out down here for a min as a human. The whole thing is actually pretty easy to grasp once you have some Holy Spirit interaction to gain you knowledge and wisdom of the questions. She can simply believe that in Jesus Christ. And be Saved, from Hell. But ya might have to dwell in it here for a little bit. But if you have an investment mentality, you can see how that’s the better deal. Have Hell here for a few decades, and then for trillions more decades you never have to think about it again. Look around.... Everywhere you look you don’t know it, but you’re watching Bible Prophecy happen. Corona was foretold. The next thing was too. Right now 3 areas are heating up in sync that never have before in such succession. Politics, Social problems, and,,,, Earthquakes. Yes the ground too. Why is that significant??? And in line with these other 2? Because if the Bible has a timeline, the 5Th Seal was opened last century. The catalyst Seal, the 6th Seal, is not long off. Research what that means. It should shake you. Question, can you live off of the land? If not it behooves you to take some study time of the aforementioned topics. Praying for anyone who reads.
➡️ She has become a NARCISSIST. ⬅️ I was a HUGE fan, but she has lost a big fan...
Here swifties
Omg amazing
The fact that the throne was shaped like a shell just like Aphrodite ( The goddess of beauty)  and the customes that is very similar to Aphrodite is just so spot on. Hands down for the Queen Halsey 👑
Little Mix 🤝 Halsey Being pregnant and still working hard
<8
The best🔥
it is fantastic work with this comeback, i am in love with this song and the video
🔥🔥
so is she implying that a woman cant be a god ? or that a woman isn't already god ?     she could have said " im not *only* a woman but also a god"
the atmosphere of this song the video takes me to a beautiful, personal, peaceful place.
you are not a god you are only human!
Listened to this song about 12 times since last night. 💙💜
I LOVE ITTT
this album is a masterpiece, i'm impacted by the concept, visuals, this whole experience is magnificent it deserves all the success 👑 queen
So powerfull 🔥🔥🔥💕🧚‍♀️

She owns this world 💥💥💥 this album is going to be massive 🔥🔥
Yesssw
Halsey 💜
The dislikes?
Finally i had the time to listen to the whole album and i am just so in love with it. The whole storyline around it is amazing. Every track is so beautiful. Not exxagerating a bit. This album was a artwork and i am amazed. Thank you for sharing the music you create.
god is a women
Revelation 21:6-8 New International Version 6 He said to me: “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life. 7 Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my children. 8 But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death........
💜🙏🏻✨
New single is perfect!!!
Imagine liking this song
She is so beautiful pllzzz😭😭😭
The sound is like a train of thoughts. The loop behind is a perfection ! A closer touch of speed in progress with the beating of a Heart accelerating just a great tune !!!

I've been so looking forawrd to hearing this, and couldn't be more impressed with Trent Reznor's production on it. Everything he does is absolute genius. If you aren't already in love with Nine Inch Nails.. you will be. ❤️ the collab.
Que mulher LINDA MDS ♡♡♡

Damn, this is a LOT of nudity for a music video!!  What is this, a Game of Thrones spoof?
LOVE THAT
Halsey!!
Omg
This is what a real artist is
Everyone's a God nowadays. It really means nothing to be a God if everyone is a God. So just stop lying, you ain't shit but a shitty human who thinks too highly of your own self...
Love queen

Maury: “You claimed to not be a woman, rather that you’re a God… We examined your birth certificate and determined, that was a lie.”
I AM A GOD ALSO;

1:42 so cuutee
Horrible... how can a human beeing say that its god.. even though its in the song, still... horrible
she is queen..
I don't like it point blank. I like your other music I don't like this song just like I didn't like Ariana Grande talkin about that she's a god too. So what made you think that I would even like this kind of crap with this song. Maybe other people would like it but I'm putting in thumbs down for this
Feels like watching GOT’s another season
Is this a movie coming up?
Türklerin bunu kaçırmaması gerekir 😅
All you mfs praising a wipers on that saying they a god smh wise up
A really bad song, sorry guys
Al-Quran.  Sura Al:Ikhlas: Verse 1-4  1. Say, “He is God, the One. 2. God, the Absolute. 3. He begets not, nor was He begotten. 4. And there is none comparable to Him.”  Bible  1 Timothy 2,5  For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.   Truth is God can't give birth. Woman can. God don't sleep, eat and drink, feel pain and so on. His Immortal and you all including me were his creation. People like Halsey stop being fake and telling lies to people.
Почему о нем никто не знает, треки делает афигенние, просто сами послушайте https://youtu.be/TAzu05FIbu8
She is ku ku
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm not talented but if I made music, this is the album I would want to create.
Real artist! Real music god! ❤️
halsey + trent and atticus = epic
Aklım almıyor cemre solmazin şarkısı bu şarkıdan nasil daha çok like ve izlenme alır saçma
Dünyanın en güzel klibi olabilir
Çok güzelsin be kadın
Listening to the album right now and I'm like 'this is a shameless NIN rip off'. After a quick google: 'ooooooh'. Album's really really good so far..
I hope she gets the views she deserves! like cmon 2.2 million views in two days? she deserves so much moreee!!
Halsey aşk kadınnnnnnn
Media is for real getting even more foolish than ever. Everybody these days feels like a god when all we are is broken creatures. How about y'all leave GOD be God and humans be humans.
Giọng Halsey cháy vl huhuhu hay wo chị
HTDA 2
👍
THIS IS FREAKING BRILLIANCE. She is one of the most talented singers out there and people don’t give her enough credits will F them !! She have us her people her fans 😍😍😍😍😍 this music video is just the tip of the iceberg of what we are going to see !!! All hail Our queen Halsey 👸🏻
I'm literally addicted to this song!
I only bought this album because @nineinchnails was on Twitter recommending it. I'm happy with IICHLIWP. Great concept album.
Trent fucking Reznor, what a genius.
Great song!!  WE LOVE YOU HALSEY. KİSSES FROM TURKEY 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
if i cant have love, i want poo?
HALSEY and The Nine Inch Nails  Now ain't that a kickass Post Industrial Grunge Pop Band name
Demonic ritual on display for all to see
God is a women 2021😁
Meh. But thats my opinion
🤍🤍🤍 art
You can just feel the rebellion and chaos in this. I'm so glad she had a baby. Cz we have this now🥺
I might change my opinion throughout time.  This was only my first listen rating! ⚜️  🥇 The Lighthouse 🥈 Bells In Santa Fe 🥉 The Tradition  4. Whispers  5. 1121  6. Girl Is A Gun  7. I am Not A Woman, I'm A God  8. Lilith  9. Easier Than Lying  10. Asked For This  11. Honey  12. Ya'aburnee  13. Darling
Love!!!
Ofcourse God is a woman and Devil is the Man. While God nurtures, the Devil provides. Balance, you see...
https://youtu.be/8jVIJwxP9qQ 🥵🔥
I am not a woman I am a God
I'm just here for Trent's work. Was hoping maybe I'd suddenly like Halsey. Oh, well.
Literally gave me goosebumps watching this. Love you & your bubba belly and love your new album.x
If you took the song closer by nin and put these lyrics in it would sound similar.
she indeed looks like a goddess
Ama şarkı da güzel olmamis bi sefer
Izlenmelwr niye bu kadar kötü
Ben geldim slmm
This song just bangs! I love the groove and she aced this one. 👌
This album is amazing, I don’t know why it’s getting so much hate!
agradable de escuchar, no doloroso para los oídos.
Nowhere near who God is. There is only One!!!
Reznor+Ross 🔥🤟
❤
I just loved the whole IMAX experience and how well the songs fit the film. She is beyond impressive and it just left me speechless!
Trent seems to be that ingredient that makes everything better.
That's so fucking dope she got to work with A fucking music genius both of them are Atticus and Trent Reznor I bet it's one of her dreams to work with Trent NIN is iconic. Halsey is so cute
Omg is art!
this is a GIFT!
She is stunning
cersei lannister vibes
Yoooo I'm finna start saying that ! " I am not a woman , ima GOD!" Lol that's facts 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 I like this song , it's different and will take some getting used to only because I love " without me " and " bad at love" ❤️😂
I love this so much
the fact they made this masterpiece while being PREGNANT is so incredible bc of everything they had to deal with due to it (all the tiredness, the extra energy they have to put, the pain, the kicks, the contractions, etc.), and had to create a whole new concept, film, everything for this era, and shows you that halsey is one of the best and strongest artists out here and women are the best on everything cause GOD IS A WOMAN, meanwhile men in the industry do the same thing for like 10 years, if you don't agree, argue w the wall
I love you!
Trent and Atticus Magic. ✨✨✨
jeffrey star looks different here
I’ve been waiting for this😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭🥺🥺I’m so happy 😭😭🥺🥺🥺
female NIN is my favourite NIN lmao. trent, my boy. yes.
i am a gaad
comparing yourself to a GOD ? i will pray for this generation.
Listening to this I was thinking, “this reminds me of Nine inch Nails…now I know why.
excusing all of these sexist and gross comments, this whole album is fucking amazing and i love this song so much- i've literally been streaming on repeat since it came out
Xinh xẻo
Esto es arte 🔥🔥
Cool
❤️❤️
actually, you're a woman
if you think your lifestyle makes you god. don't mislead people with words you're not even 1% close(god)
I like it, it's got a good feel. That said, the lyrics are not going to help with growing female narcissism that's growing out of control. I used to really love women and still do but not these newer generations. Too many seem too dumb🤣
I discovered the album because it as Produced by Nine Inch Nails. Holy crap this is amazing Her lyrics and performance is amazing
Te amo💚 joyita  de canción  😢💌
Imagine being the very definition of narcissism.
Is this the closer chick? Why is she not collaborating with the Chainsmokers anymore?
♥️♥️
would identifying as a god fall under the prefer not to say category?
God is a woman. We know that!!! <3
I’m obsessed with her!
How humble lol
Masterpiece✨
Depois álbum manic esse tá sendo melhor
Que delícia de música amooooo
#Gematria
GROSS COULDN'T WATCH THE WHOLE THING.
There is no God but Allah ❤️
This chick needs to listen to that song by AC/DC because she is on the highway to hell! 🔥
It is ridiculous that a person who goes to the toilet claims to be a god.
They belong to the streets
Were r your eyebrows?
"Keep your heart. Cuz I already have one"  That was awesome
Te amoooo🥰
humbly disagree
False god
the production in this album is insane, that's what happens when you combine three music geniuses
“Do you feel like a young god?” “I am not a woman, I’m a god.”  She knows what she’s worth
GOD IS NOT A WOMEN. TGIS VIDEO IS FROM A BUNCH OF SATANIC PUPPETS
John 10:33 “We’re not going to stone you for any good things,” replied the Jews, “but for blasphemy: because you, who are only a man, are making yourself out to be God.”  1 John 1:9 if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.   1 John 5:21 Dear children, keep yourselves from idols.  Colossians 3:5 Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry.  Leviticus 19:4  “ ‘Do not turn to idols or make metal gods for yourselves. I am the LORD your God.  Galatians 5:19-21 19 The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; 20 idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions 21 and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.  John 10:33 “We’re not going to stone you for any good things,” replied the Jews, “but for blasphemy: because you, who are only a man, are making yourself out to be God.”
Not so much
The devil has many names. Like the dragon. Nice dragon you have on your arm. This is satanism and yet the mass sleeps.
A música é ruim, mas o clipe é bem bonito.
hate to tell you but you  are not a "God"
GOD IS NOT A WOMAN. THIS IS A DECEPTION FROM THE PIT
But your not a God. Just because your body makes a living being doesn't mean your a God You need a man to get that baby. A God doesn't need anyone to make what it wants.
Halsey Takes Her Creativity To A Whole Other Universe 🦋
Halsey primeira de seu nome, mãe de dragões, quebradora de correntes  a não queimada e o crlh a quatro, vc quer Game of Thrones? A Halsey entrega né gente? Nunca critiquem esse álbum está foda.
This new direction she's moving in is so smart and completely epic. I mean I've been a Trent Reznor fan for like ever! I adore the background industrial-like elements. Combined with the female empowerment aspect, so dope.
You are going to be a beautiful mother. Congratulations
Oh this is a great song for cat walks, Fashion shows, or just for confidence. Like walking with your head held high and singing it. Yass🔥🔥
Eu admito que esse som que o *Trent Reznor* produziu junto com a Halsey, ficou muito interessante. Halsey se salvou da mediocridade. Sensacional !!!
This song makes me feel like a fucking badass, powerful woman. The Trent Reznor production is sick. I can't get enough of it.
NO HUMAN WILL EVER BE A GOD. FACT.
every fcking scene of this music video is purely ART
♥️♥️3>
🌎🔜🔥B.C. and A.D. are timemarks everyone uses. Jesus Christ is the one and only Lord and Savior who Rose again. There is no peace without repentance and resurrection. ⏳⚰️🪦✝️
This is satanic to its core
Hahahaha get a Life. Stop maling music. Maybe a job a Mc donalds for u.
this is SO GOOD OMFGAWD
A god up until she dies and realizes she's just a human.
Just heard it on the radio!!!
This is INCREDIBLE. She is so talented in every artistic genre
I came because of Trent Reznor, but I will stay because of Halsey (and Trent/Atticus obvs).
she is a GOD !!! lol lol lol
I literally felt bless by Halsey
first heard it and it reminded me of Ace of Base
THE YENGE
Idk why everything has to look like a wierd ass cult lately.
she isn't lying, she is a god
I wish that the vocals was from Mariqueen Maandig Reznor
Perfection
Song is addicting AF!!!!!!
Trent reznor and atticus Ross.  Respect halsey 🤘
اويلي عليك يالعمه😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
She looks different every time I see her
Pure 3vil!!!
She's sick!!!
This new NIN album rocks. ;) Halsey is definitely a god.
With ya satanic shit
U not a God tf
She's like the villain princess
Şarkıda klipte kesinlikle çok iyi ❤️❤️❤️🇹🇷
Tövbe de hergele!!!
Halsey ❤️
I love ❤❤❤❤❤❤ ı  love halsey
Me encanta Halsey, además amo como en este album uso un poco de su inspiración en K12 de Melanie Martinez. ARTE LAS DOS.
God is a man— a woman can’t conceive without the life in a sperm.
<3
"Я не вагиня, я багиня"... 😂
my afab self who decided on the name ares:
You wish😂
Definitely not
The whole theme of the album is being missed. She is bringing that female principle back. She has a song called Lilith! This album will stand the test of time!
How awkward and true ...
God was a man an we were made in his image,,,,, THE ONLY REASON FIR A WOMAN WAS ADAM FELT SOMETHING WAS MISSING IN HIS LIFE,,,, an from a rib of a man, hear on earth  WOMAN was created,
🛐🛐🛐🛐
I wanted to see that movie so badly but unfortunately it wasn’t offered in Alaska or I would have for sure snagged up tickets. I hope one day I’ll have the opportunity to see it. You are an amazing artist and singer and all around beautiful and smart business woman as well. You definitely are killing it!! Congratulations on your baby and this amazing album and movie hun.
They did it. Within less than 60 years, they rooted God straight out of your awareness and replaced him ( as your only hope) with foolish painted pop stars pretending to be wannabe gods in make-up, feigned words, and theatre. I am speechless, 2021 generation. The horror that is coming on the unbelieving who are so wrapped up in sin, and idolatry, can not even see what is about to happen to you. You sit on a razor's edge right now. These videos are your church; these lyrics your Holy book, and these singers who care nothing for you, are your false gods.  And you sat there and let them rob you of *ALL the Treasures and Knowledge that hidden in Christ Jesus*. I am speechless. All I can do is encourage you to return and read his word, and let him through his Spirit that is good, lead you to truth; and bible reminds us in the 1st command: Do Not have any other gods before me. "Love in flesh" ( Jesus) said that to you, for a reason.  There is a trap forming all around you in layers. Are you so dull, you can not see or hear or heed the warning? Don't you feel the impending doom forming up for you?  And now this generation (2021) is a shallow, godless, ignorant, lost edu-tainment based, money-driven, entertainment-driven, vapid gang of those who do whatever is right in your own eyes. I promise you with the biblical authority dear ones, That will lead you to destruction and a firey quarantine; if you do not turn back and make amends with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, who bled for you to know him. He loves you and wants to route out evil from you, blessing you with new life and direction, and be made sinless and blessed in new glorified flesh. And *not as gods*, but men perfected and blessed of the Father. Do not turn to this foolish generation for the wisdom of man, rather run full speed to Jesus and his mercy, grace and rebirth immediately as the gospel is located in 1 Corinthians 15. Your time is waning 2021.  Do you not know that the Evil in charge of this world are setting up vaccination camps, and even if you have been injected, they will still trap you in and dispose of you as worthless? Do you not know these basic news facts? Jesus alone loves you and can help you. Learn to listen quickly, dear ones. God hears humility.  Teresa
Love ittt🥺🙂🫐
Blasphemy is not trendy.
I'm SORRY SWTHRT , but there is no such "THING AS A WOMB MAN, GOD",,,, hence the word(G O D D E S S),,,, an dnt really wanna kno Y dat description fir women end wit ESSES,,,, (SSSSSSSS) CUL SONG THO

https://youtube.com/shorts/Mx-fsGGfESo?feature=share
I love almost all of her music, this album is my favorite!
Is that first scene where they filmed Spartacus blood in the sand?
😃
How will they meet God on the Day of Judgment, when they see themselves as similar to Him, or believe that God is a female or that He has a son .. Where are their minds ? Everything is clear to them BUT . I pray to God that they know the path of truth before it is too late
te amoooooooooooo
yasss
absolutely in  love the mixing and intrumental
where are your eyebrows
Lyrics [Intro] I am not a woman, I'm a god I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart 'cause I already—  [Verse 1] Every day, I got a smile where my frown goes A couple bodies in the garden where the grass grows I take 'em with me to the grave in a suitcase Maybe I could be a different human in a new place  [Pre-Chorus] Oh I just wanna feel somethin', tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows somethin' I don't wanna know So I stay right here 'cause I'm bеtter all alone Yeah, I'm bеtter all alone But  [Chorus] I am not a woman, I'm a god I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a god I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart 'cause I already—  [Verse 2] Every morning, got a hollow where my heart goes I never listen, but I see it with my eyes closed I know you, I remember from the grass stain Maybe I could be a better human with a new name  [Pre-Chorus] Oh I just wanna feel somethin', tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows somethin' I don't wanna know So I stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone But  [Chorus] I am not a woman, I'm a god I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a god I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart 'cause I already— (Yeah)  [Bridge] I'm ready to leave it, I'll go when I feel it Got caught, both hands on the smokin' gun I try, but I need it, it's hard, but I feel it And it really does hurt when you love someone Oh I just wanna feel somethin', tell me where to go 'Cause everybody knows somethin' I don't wanna know So I stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone Yeah, I'm better all alone  [Chorus] I am not a woman, I'm a god I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud So keep your heart 'cause I already got one I am not a woman, I'm a god I am not a martyr, I'm a problem I am not a legend, I'm a fraud Keep your heart 'cause I already got one
I  love u Halsey
Stop trying to be god
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
this is legit next level 🔥
The dulsion why the fuck is this in my recommended
Halsey, this is a masterpiece!
Fuck this is good!!
Halsey you ate so gooddddddd💜💜
Nine Inch Halsey
Love u so much girl
How much you wanna bet that there is satanic rituals throughout this show/movie or whatever it is. Notice there was no speaking bc the acting will be horrible. This looks like a show for young women who grew up without a loving family. Normal people will pass on this.
Hasley ,  You My Dear are no god . God Is in Heaven , you are in Hell on Earth. Don't be fooled young children this is not the way.Being gods daughter is more powerful than being a mock of god himself.🤍
I love your voice
Blasphemy,What nonsense.You can get your point across without Blasphemy I’m sure.
Halsey çok güzelsin
❤️
HELL will be waiting 4 this Heathen....Hell will be Horrific.  REPENT & be SAVED...JOHN  3:16

Büyülendim çok güzel her sahnesi
Halsey is one of my most favorite female artists
I’m a guy and I love this song! Way better than Ariana Grande “God is a woman”
Yengem be
It's been years since something hit me that hard ... wow
Kayne West enters the chat
Are you follower of Satan? This stuff is Satanic.
what a CROCK of 💩💩
Strong How To Destroy Angels vibe from this.
How is this not democratized
She looks weird without eyebrows
Imagine breaking commandment 1 just in the title
Pure evil lol. Fun fact: halsey has a 666 tattoo on her hand
Music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross
Loveeee this somg
She's so good, I can't
Reading the comments is gross. People worshipping her like she’s a deity. The lyrics are trashy and narcissistic, but I guess that’s what this mentally and spiritually ill world loves. 🙄
NO HUMAN IS A GOD!!……
What goes up must come down
Demonic lyrics and sound design. Stay away from that for your own health.  You will experience the trauma and hidden truth of this if you get older.
So I'm a huge NIN fan, but I've always listened to pop as well... This is like a wet dream come true, though so was Saul Williams - Niggy Tardust ❤️
Vc brasileiro raiz que está vendo esse vídeo deixei um like, família tmj , Deus abençoe vcs..🙏🏻❤️🤜🏻
Bjork vibes
Yengeee
Her personality resembles soo much to goddess. Bless her, oops bless me
fucking incredible!!!!
Wow this is soo corrupt.

Music for narcissistic women🤮 the last thing we need
Goddess
Great music doesn’t need soft-porn. This isn’t performing, it’s narcissism in the extreme… but that’s nothing new.
Yes halsey
💜
This is pure ‘evil’. Wake up brother’s and sisters in humanity, ‘satan’ is in full mode all over this physical world that we are all living in or on. Lots of you will say the video is awesome,the beats are really touching,the voice of her is amazing,and she is g.. that’s precisely what the ‘satan’ wants us to follow and do. Wake up,stop sleeping behind the veal before you/me crash,and then when we crash it maybe to late to wake up. Please I’m not telling you what to do,but I personally see/hear nothing but ‘evil’ on this video/song what ever you want to call it. Wake up.
Wowwwwwww. This is the best thing ive seen/heard all year 😍😍
Movie?😲
Amazing 🔥🔥🔥
Can anyone answer this, is Halsey in a corset? I’m just curious how they did that with them being pregnant. I’ve worn corsets before and never been pregnant so I wouldn’t know how that would work 😅/Gen
Muhtesem yuzyil havasi veriyor
Halsey being Produced by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross is absolutely amazing. Keep it up HALSEYTHEGOD! 🙌
Love every single line! So powerful! Masterpiece for real
Trent reznor make me trust this album
The music video shows Halsey's Goddesess
✨
🖇️🕊️
😍😍
good music i didnt like some of the lyrics
This must be Lady Gadflys new wingman  to lead people to the pit.  Eyes to see Ears to hear.
Halsey, ur awesome..
BRUH! MAKE THIS INTO A MOVIE TAKE MY MONEY AAHH-
Halsey is perfect in every song, such talent
🎼🤯✨
😍😍
Good
00:28 thank me later ;)
But you are legend already
Thanks Halsey this song is such a bop!!!
Love you Halsey
Wow, another masterpiece from Halsey.
No mention of Trent Reznor or atticus Ross. Seems a bit shit since they have transformed your songs from mundane shit to something so much better.
Love from Turkey 🇹🇷❤️ Halsey love u ❣️💋
ШЕДЕВР
pretty little halsey machine
It's Sooooo Bountiful
Everybody say now : I'm not a woman I'm a GOD

💗💗
Лесби
Oh my God!
oturdum film izler gibi klibi izliyorum , MUHTEŞEMM
This is masterpiece
Where are Halsey's Turkish fans? ❤ ❣ Halsey'in Türk hayranları nerede? ❤ ❣
I am not a women, ı am a god 💅🏻🛐
Okay if she’s god then raise the dead and cure the sickness with no cure
Sen harikasın be
regardless if its ironic, this is still idolatry and it's disgusting to God
There is only one God, and His name is Jesus Christ.
This is the Disney version of “Closer” by Nine Inch Nails for the Tic Tok generation… its a banger, its a little naive and blasphemous, but the talent is undeniable and the end product is a scrumptious piece of industrial pop. But PARENTS please teach you children to enjoy pop music without worshipping it. It will lead you astray… You can praise the Holy God (whatever that is to you), be a good person and still rock out to songs like this. 🤘🛐
For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. Romans 14:11 KJV Keep playing with fire Halsey and you WILL get burnt.
Great music great art.
true facts
🕯🎶✨👑✨🎶🕯
If I CAN'T HAVE LOVE,  I WANT POWER♡
Ok but there’s only one God
I'm just here to see the see through linens
Am obsessed by this art... it's magical,the song sounds like it's from another world 💯254🇰🇪much love
This and Darling are my favourite songs off the album so far!  Can’t stop listening to this 1 today though!!
1.42 th second so cute <3
Sometimes when artists feel too big inside their little head with their very limited power, they use music to create a sense of false security and power for a little while longer. If you are not woman, then you are ashamed and defy the beauty of who GOD MADE YOU. If you feel that you are God, please don't make music because I am sure there are far more important things you need to take care of in this world than trying to sell albums to keep up with your fancy life. God doesn't need to make music and market it. Halsey is more corrupted and vile as the days go by. Don't blaspheme with what is Holy. And I only listened to this piece of crap called music becuase I wanted see what desperation she has resorted to next. Disgusted
I'll be her fan till i die
She is my everything
I love you Halsey
I'm obsessed with Halsey and he songs ^^
Soo goood
seems like katy perry "love me"
Halsey is so beautiful🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸
Unfortunately you're still a woman

Amazing 🤩 you
"If I Can't Have Love,.." everyone can have love. Everytime.  From Love itself. Pure Love.  Love is a person. ~| God is Love |~   I invited him into my life and he filled my empty heart with his undying Love. I became alive and happy for the first time in my life. This happened 2016 and while I could not always feel the Love, the Love was and is always in my heart. God was always there and took care of me.  You can have this Love too.  Edit: Just to make this clear, I mean God itself who created everything through his son Jesus.
Tittiiiiiiies
woman ıs not god shut
Yesss! Go off Queen 💜😭

NIN shines thru. Great idea to team up Trent w/ Halsey for this album!
ALBÜM HARİKA YAAA
Billie Eilish is crying herself to sleep right now cuz Halsey kicks the living crap out of her dull dopey lame ass.
EN SEVDİĞİM HALSEY ALBÜMÜ BU ALBÜM OLDU ARTIK
TEK TÜRK BENİM SANIRIM
HALSEY VE TAYLOR'IN ARKADAŞLIĞI = <3
HALSEY CANDIR
Seems very contrived like the wicker man movie with all the Wiccan lesbian witches prancing around & fondling each other.  However, the music is gorgeous and her voice is stunning…I can so hear Trent Reznor’s composition and production style all over this thing which makes it even better.
HALSEY'E BAYILIYORUM YAV ÇOK TATLI GÜZEL VE GÜÇLÜ BİR KADIN
ÇOK AZ YORUM VAR
💚💛❤️
HALSEY DİYE YAZILIR MÜKEMMELLİK DİYE OKUNUR
this song is one of my favorites from the album + you asked for this + easier than lying + the lighthouse actually fuck it they're all my favorite
TRENDLERE GİRMİŞŞŞŞŞŞŞŞŞŞ :))))
halsey uses she/they pronouns everyone
What do you want
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
SHIT I CAN'T BE A GOD
61K+ LIKES!? THIS SONG IS THE BEST
So um, when is this movie gonna come out?
Fukoff OMG these kid's are  living with a false reality of self your DNA isn't old enough to even begin to think your God. You can't say something just to be saying it..fukoff 🤷

I love the concept, the song is also catchy. I’m here for their new era
nu halsey q musica ruim kkkkkkkk

This music video is literally so aesthetic in levelsss
fr33mas0n
best song off the new album
Que mulheeeeeer. 😍
I just wanna feel something so tell me where to go! Nine in the background ahhh soo sick!!
Damn this is a such a good work
So why was this not flagged for nudity🙂
What a stupid and totally self absorbed song.  Heres the truth: you will never know if they love you or just your looks and the only power you will ever have is over your own self - and you will be overthrown.
"cause everybody knows something i dont wanna know" i like this line so much bc it' s literally about my whole life.
Jesus is God
What does MUSIC mean to you?   (I've made some playlists I would like to share with you all! They are a little bit crazy, but they are good! Listen to them on my chanel)
This is platinum 👏 level music and art 🎨 and truth and wholesome and powerful and 2000s rock but of course in your very own vision and it is amazing and nostalgic but something never heard before. I LOVE THIS HALSEY-ASH , Majesty.
Who Agree Shivering Music??
This album goes beyond. It's an awesome  masterpiece   The meaning  of the album goes beyond and is much deeper , Darker ,Beautiful and perhaps  so amazing. I loved each and every song so much.
Our selfish hearts have separated us from God. But in order to reconcile us, God came in the flesh. He lived as a man, suffered and gave his life on our behalf, taking the punishment we deserved. Then he rose from the dead and showed us the hope we can look forward to if we only place our trust in Jesus Christ. He is the living God who created everything. He will create in you a new heart. He wants to give you eternal life but he insists on having your consent. “You must be born again.” Seek the truth. God bless you.
Trent Reznor brought me here!
YOU ARE A LEGEND HALSEY
you are not a god, you are sinning by proclaiming such a thing
its sooooooo goooood
In the first part of the video she looks so much like Jessica Chastain in Crimson Peak and I am here for it
https://youtu.be/obh_VbsAB3s
😮😳 Beautiful and fascinating. Love this.
This song!
Yess please
HALSEY!! BOO!? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!!??💙

Nonbinary person: releases song titled "I am not a woman, I'm a god" that uses that lyric as part of the chorus in their first album since updating their pronouns and letting us know they have Gender Stuff going on.  Makes that song the first music video for the album.  Cis people in the YT Comments: Wow!!!!  What a strong woman!!!  She she her her she her she!  Me, a nonbinary person just trying to vibe: ...
love you more than ever:)) ♥
This is epic

Wow, Hasley sings over Reznors unreleased demos, nice.
What is the name of the keys whic are starting playing from 0:54 (ending at 1:03) ? I heard it in many synthpop/syntwave songs but still hasn’t figured out the name 🤔 Music professionals, I’m calling for your help 🙏🏻
Wow

Been waiting for this for ages😊 finally it's here🔥💃Blaze on Queen Halsey 👑 ❤🙌
tá perfeito
I think Halsey's tears quickly can turn to lightening.
I’ve been waiting for this album for months was so excited this morning !
Thus insane cool
As always, I wanna get a tattoo with every single lyric
"And it really just hurt when you love someone"  -Drops the mic
I usually don't like Halsey, like at all. I will change the radio if she comes on. This song however got me feeling different. I hope she stays with this sound.
Break out the meth
Desearía que estuviera disponible en mi país
wow what in the world did humans claim themselves as God or even equal to God. Let me remind you that we are all nothing but a spect of dust that will soon die & your fleshy body will rot in the coffin. Us humans are the proof of God’s creation understand that.
as a NIN fan... this is fucking good.
who are you and why did youtube recommend a horrible singer
It looks like there on the lower deck of the Titanic ship in the pool area.
Is she hinting at early signs of a developing god complex lmao
A false god I rebuke you
U ARE A GOD HOLY FUUUUUCK
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is beyond Epic!
How can I watch the movie, cause it’s not showing where I live
You look like a wanna be princes from star wars

NEXT LEVEL
You are no god. Jezebel demonic spawn. Sound like every bad NIN song from the 90s. So Un origional.
Reznor and Ross elevate everyone they work with.
Love it, yusss 🔥
beautiful.
Can hear Trent Reznor's touch on this. Love it
The only things  That I like si the  instrumental sound 🤣
This is giving me modern 80s video vibes with 90s sound. Love it
This is 💩
Empowerment. Rage. Lust. Vulnerability. Love. Pain. Halsey is able to portray it all gracefully!
Sounds like a opposite  title from god is a woman
*HALSEY ...*  ⚘
1:41 IM JUST 🥺🥺
Such a beautiful voice wasted on nonsense people will defend as "art".
%99.99 bu mesajı görmiyceksin ama duru senin storyinde gördüm şarkıyı güzelmiş beğendim xD
Omg I LOVE THIS
I've seen enough I wanna die

WOWWWWWW
Dear Halsey Don't stop making lit songs l beg😣💕
This video is perfect!!! She's really a God!!!!
U are a women
THIS IS DEFINITELY A CULTURAL RESET
The music reminds me of my music, actually. Would rather better lyrics and Nine Inch Nails much better.
Ender made his debut ❤
HALSEY!!!!!!!!!
Zzzzzzzzzzzz
yes you are Halsey. A fucking GOD DAMN GOD!
What a fucking banger
Vibe with a real Power! 💥
How come this is not at 1 million al ready
One of the songs from the album that gives me swag vibe. Suprisely different from her songs before. Real power! 💥
🛐 Arte en su máximo esplendor.
You're not human, you're a slave of SJW mainstream.
Her magnum opus
Garbage 🤮🤮🤮
Well technically she is not a god, she would be a goddess but that's if they exist.
Said every ruler and yet they're all under the ground
Ok yall guys gettin to confident and spoiled
A melhor

Wow👏🏻
This is a masterpiece 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☺️☺️☺️🔥🔥🔥☺️🔥🔥
Ariana:  god is a woman Halsey:  im not a woman,  im a god Jesus:  aM a JokE tO yOu?
This album will bomb....she isn't a god she is a manufactured pop star with breast implants.
Halsey X Nine Inch Nails 🤘

Don't blink! @1:02
Simplemente hermosa canción la estaba esperando y ufff es perfecta 🎶✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨🖤🖤🖤🖤

Love the album Halsey, the video is awesome as well as this song. Love Trent  as well as NIN, great job all of you on the album, I can't stop listening ❤🤘
♡
How stupid you all are to claim that you are a god? You are even immortale. If you were a god at least you should live for ever! You will perish in no more than half a century. There is only one God, it is Allah the Almigjty the rest are all fsulse.
Man...this sounds off. Trents music is fantastic...but her vocals over it are jarring. Just doesn't fit...until the louder part at the end.
The joke is every woman listening to this thinking she's god, then who are the woomans shown as slaves in song.
This reminds me of Kesha or Adele tho”” 😂
I’m not a women I’m a man,,!!😂
Very fake
This MV is revolution  Your are the best halsey  "I'M NOT WOMEN,  I'M A GOD"  I'm in love with this lyric
Omg
There is no God, but if there were, it'd be a woman for sure. And I'd get on my knees and worship her.
Fucking goosebumps
I really need halsey and the weeknd collabration
You are Just a human. You are not a god. You are a weak. You didn't create anything. Don't be a fool.
Halsey 💜🇹🇷🌈
YESSS! SHE İS GOD
wow!!
This deserves more wtf
I figured Trent and atticus' involvement would show through a lot more...but it just feels like a typical pop album...Halsey didn't need their involvement in the first place she makes pop music just fine...the lighthouse is the only track I've heard so far that has a respectable non-pop feeling to it but the structure hasn't changed enough to be noteworthy...just a die hard NIN fans opinion...
you are a godess a woman with real power your album is so good and each song is so meaningfull
Queen 🛐
💛❤💜💚🕇🕇🕇
Best song on the album.
I will *hopefully* be singing this for the rest of my life
😂😂😂😂😂
Veryyy nice
This. Is. A. Fucking. Masterpiece.
You not a god

IM CRYING🥺🥺
Que hermosa ♡
SHE DID IT AGAIN
just- yes.
I cursed when i opened spotify to see the album. Then hurried to youtube if i missed any mv and here i am. Watching this bomb. My weekend is complete. Thank you!!!!!💜
So good
Ya’ll throw the word god around like nothing. There is only one true God and He will show His mighty wrath upon all you who stay on this wicked path. Repent before its too late.
Omggg

Love how somehow they made this scene not explicit for yt 😂
Can't sing 💩
pop singers love being blasphemous huh
I love this
She’s sold her soul…. All seriously satanic! When you know you know.    Wash out and absolute sell out.
I'm tired of women singing im a God  Ariana did it first and now she's doing it God is a man stupid
good >>god
This is so amazing
God is a WOMEN WE SEE THIS PERIOD.!!!
👂🏻✨✨✨✨✨
SHE IS A LEGEND SHE'S AN ICON AND SHE IS THE MOMENT
Perfecttttt😍🔥
Their voice sounds so good
Best song on the whole album!❤️😍
Nice😍❤

Please Dear Halsey could you do a song in Spanish? or a collaboration with a Latin American artist
Masterpiece
La escuche y la adore :0
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLSEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Amazing😍😍🤗🤗
Halsey. Is. So. Cool.
Halsey made me feel feel more than just a woman❤️👸
"Art is not what I create. What I create, is chaos." -Halsey 🖤
all this artist are controlled by some evil spirit
Chicas, escuchen bien el mensaje de esta canción y nunca se sientan menos sois unas diosas💖
wow
Damn this song is so good
All the people commenting shit over here I think you need to educate  yourself  a little and tryna appreciate  hardwork of halsey  What does she actually  means in this particular . If you are not a fan why did you open this video just to prove that she is wrong and your negativity  is right . Keep your thoughts  within your small mind and anyways she is way more successful  and loved in the world and she doesn't  needs your HATERS permission  to dance ,  She will do whatever  she wants  Cause she is talented.. And dont bring  religion  into every  single thing . It's not abt your religion  that she is dragging so stop putting hate you HATERS..
Loved the music
Trent Reznor I hear you too
❤️❤️❤️🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷
绅士们快出来
support her ♡♡♡♡
The best masterpiece . Thank you Halsey💖💗
♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
cool baby

Fall in love ur everythink 💜 Ur voice ,u, ur caracter ,its so much
El álbum es TAN bueno, además de el increíble concepto y las letras, gracias por tanto Halsey perdón por tan poco 🛐🛐🛐
YES... SHE IS A GOD... a religion I'll follow.
This is awesome
YAAASSHHHH QUEEN 👑!!! YOU SHINE
My jaw dropped when she was completely naked in the movie
sen oyle guzelsin ki
Empowering!!!! Halseys creativity has no ceiling! No limit! She’s the modern woman in charge of her own life. Mad respect.
Single please
"Dear mom... You're just a woman 🙃😅"
Pause @ 0:28 thank me later. 😄😄😄😄
i don't kn bout yall but this on repeat for me
Halsey is God ❤
The mc was good but the song was average..I had high expectations..one more thing you claiming yourself as a god ..AND THE BH MUSIC WAS HORRIBLE
aşk kadın yaa.
🥺🥺
HALSEY... YOU'RE PERFECT WOMAN BUT YOU'RE NOT A WOMAN, YOU'RE GOD!
Halsey🖤 Feeling like a god  Ariana 🧚God is a woman
Bangin'!!!

Yengem Be...

Trent and atticus......you've done it again. I guess I'm a halsey fan now. 🤷‍♂️
1:41 soo prettyy
Halsey THE Queen
YENGE 🤍
This album saved me from my depression. I'm not even joking.
Who is here because they learned that Trent & Atticus produced the work?    I liked Halsey already, though.
I'm literally speechless, this album is a masterpiece.
Grimes?
Halsey God. ♥︎
More Autotune, yuck. You realize that autotune was created for singers that can't hit the right note, right?  She's not a god, but if you do your part, you **can** be a child of God. Best any of us can hope for.
Never heard of her, but I'm listening now. Holeee sheeit chills
A mashup with this and All The Love In The World would be 🔥🔥🔥
Huge NIN and Reznor vibes on this... Nice job Halsey
honestly this one didn't grasp me in this first listen. Hopefully it's a grower and hopefully the rest of the album does :(
Jesus Christus is coming soon guys open your eyes he's loving you so much change u mind and oben u heart he will safe u soul for more read the Bible and you will see its the truth in there!
This masterpiece certainly doesn't make me feel like a woman, but a god.
🔥😍💎
Halsey: thanks Trent and Atticus!   Trent and Atticus: whatever. We're the Gods.
Hehehehehe
Oi
this is ART. definitely you r a God, queen. and you know that.
YOU DID THAT! INCREDIBLE!
This song give vibes in blood 😈📍
My beautiful daughter🔗💭

You deserve more than that:)
You tried a lot:))))

NO. YOUR A PUPPET OF THE DEVIL TO INFLUENCE THE MASS. YOUR A DECIEVED WOMAN. YOU WILL NEVER BE A god NOR WILL YOU NEVER BE A goddess. THE DEVIL IS REFERRED TO AS THE BEAST OUR THE DRAGON. NOTICE THE DRAGON ON HER ARM.
I love you 💕 and I know you because of BTS they are so good and with you too Keep going  Good luck  All the best Bless you and your family 💝
This album smells like #1
PUPPETS OF THE DEVIL
This song lit af
I guess it’s alright if you are luciferian
WORDS THE DEVIL WOULD DECEIVE PEOPLE WITH.  GOD IS GOD, AND YOU WILL NEVER BE A god nor a goddess. YOUR A PUPPET TO THE DEVIL.
Ashley bu kadar mükkemmel olmak zorunda değilsin  Hi from Turkey💜
ABC’s of SALVATION  ADMIT: You’re a sinner, condemned to DEATH (physical & spiritual) .  Romans 3:10, 23 There is none righteous, no, not one … For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.  Romans 6:23 & James 1:15 the wages of sin is death … sin, when it is finished bringeth forth death. (Spiritual death is eternity in HELL !)  BELIEVE: that JESUS died, rose again, and that HE ALONE can save you from sin, death, and hell.  Romans 10:9-10 if you: believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness.  CONFESS: JESUS CHRIST, and nothing else, as your own Saviour. Romans 10:9, 10 & 13 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus … confession is made unto salvation … whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  Before it’s too late, forever, DO IT NOW! God’s gift is FREE and as easy as A-B-C !.
Maravilhosa 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏.
te amoooooooooooooooooooo

MEU DEUS DO CÉU EU TÔ-  HALSEEEEEEEEY
Not one person has commented how it's a white woman who cast the roles of the servants and slaves to all black and diverse persons.
I have three moods and this title is one of them
Got to see it was fucking amazing
The combination of their powerful vocals, the lyrics, and Trent Reznor’s production … This is next level shit.
Ooof😩✌😁
Wow cute
The only god I will ever pray to. 🙏
Just wait now Halsey will become a star number one
You're NOT A GOD! That's Satanic BS..
I'm only here because Trent and Atticus lol so proud of them!!! Making pop music not shitty.
🖤
This album is so mature and open. Every song has a different vibe and message. It feels like she's speaking my mind. If I had to dedicate an album to my life it would be this one. Spectacular work! A masterpiece! Our queen Halsey!

Beautiful the whole album.
Should we tell them?
Thanks Trent & Atticus for pushing forward the boundaries of what is to be considered pop music!
❤🎶🥺
the production in this album is insane, that's what happens when you combine three music geniuses
No. You are human and you will turn to dust one day.
CHILLS
She sounds like Rihanna to me, I expected something else. But I'll try to listen more songs
oh yea ? ima dood
This song is so perfect
Omg so hot and gorgeous 🥺
I am a myth, I’m an angel

Great artist, enjoy her work. love the visuals and the lyrics. Men worship Women so yeah we are like gods to these men but some men are like gods to us, too. just mortals worshiping the image in our minds of what lust is.

Klip ve şarkı aşşırı iyiii
With🤮
Can someone PLEASE do a mashup with this song and God is a woman PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
Te Amo Halsey, hazme un hijo 🥰🖤
OMG this deserves a movie!
A. Lovely condensing of the film without giving away everything in it. B. Very creative editing of the bath scene considering just HOW much nudity was actually in it. C. Best album so far, and not one song isn't a banger. Halsey, you did it, you made the perfect album. Congrats, babe!
Them NIN vibes, she sounds so powerful
Şarkı mükemmel heyy Türkler nerdesiniz
I hate pop music especially with how generic it is (to me). This is fucking great. Wow Trent and Atticus can do anything.
I purple u💜
Queen halsey💜
Rainha ❤️ amo demais essa mulher
This song  is fvcking powerful!
Today is my birthday, this is my best gift😍😍
Wow just wow 🤩
Best song on the album
I heard this song at work this morning, had no idea who it was but thought it sounded exactly like a NIN track with those synths, turned out I was right
Em already telling this song is masterpiece!
This is her best album yet! Visually stunning
I can't over it. Thank u goddess💙
I’m so sad I can’t get this IMAX experience in Singapore
The film and album are AMAZING. Still in shock.
again an amazing song and still underappreciated :(
Ben öldüm
will the film come out to watch for free here on youtube or is it an imax only?
Bts and halsey in the same day... it's gonna be a great weak
I love it

I like almost all work from Trent Reznor. I like Halsey too. I was so excited for this album  but sadly after listening I am just left disappointed. I dont want to seem like I am hating on Halsey or Trent or anyone.  I am just not happy with it :(
Why is this underrated?!?!?!

Halsey: releases a song touching on their ambiguity and questioning of their gender. Names it “I am not a woman, I’m a god.”  The comments: “OMG, YASS, SLAY QUEEN, ARIANA WAS RIGHT, GOD IS A WOMAN!”

Exodus 20: 3-6- Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 4Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: 5Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; 6And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
She always says facts

i am not a woman , i'm a OBJECT.
Music industry needs her music
iam not a woman,iam a god ❌ iam not halsey,iam your queen ✅
Majesticc
HALSEY THE QUEEN💜
I feel this is her reflection upon how truly incredible and strong woman are during her pregnancy.  That woman are gods, we are all sisters , we all came from strength and bestowed it upon our daughters each generation . And we should appreciate that strength and almost primal instinct to overcome adversity against all odds against us . Just what I took from this
WTF THIS IS SO GOOD
Amazing 💞
I love you my queen😭😭😭💙💙
LOKAH SAMASTAH SUKHINO BHAVANTU is a Sanskrit phrase that translates to "may all beings everywhere be happy and free and may the thoughts words and actions of my own life contribute in some way towards that happiness and freedom for all" 💚👽🛸😻🐶🐄🐷🐔🐳🐬🦜🦚🍀🍄🌎

OMG
QUEEN
My confidence level just turned into a god complex from listening to this📈
OMG QUEEN HALSEY!!!
yes, you are god
🚀🚀🚀
yes you are a god
Please please please... The historian/theologist side of YouTube comment section... Tell me ALL the references. I know there are alot of them, I could find some Greek Matriarchal reference but I don't know enough to understand all of it. The chained jewellery type Empress? The Burning city? The.. The.. ALL OF IT actually!! I don't need sleep(although it's afternoon here in India😂) I need answers!!🧐🧐
lol not my god you're just a human
Sick
YASSSSSSS
KRALİÇE 🇹🇷
OLAYYYYY
Wowwww Halsey is a god. This song is too addictive 😍😍😍

Coool
Very nice

God
Wow !!! Amazing scenography !!! 👏👏👏 Halsey !!  ♥️
Omg
you're my god <3
I LOVE YOU MY BABY
Loving the Trent and Atticus sound all over this album, challenging harmonies, rhythms, and layers upon layers of perfectly crafted sounds. Will it be to complex/messy for a chart hit though, and does Halsey even care?
I have been waiting for this for soooo long
this album is super super great..love it
i wish there was a movie
Harikasın ASHHH Devammmmmmmmmmmmmmm
The best viece
You'r Qoueen
Masterpiece ❤️
❤️‍🔥
This title is everything!💚
And finally here it is 🥲🥲🥺🤍
Talented mama ❤
That Dark outfit... 🖤✨
it's easier than lying, she is god, she isn't lying.
She looks so good in every scenes
This music video is literally everything 🍷🔥
I'm so exicted to see this album🤍
Another masterpiece  ...
When I say Halsey is a legend, this is what I mean:
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Look who made another masterpiece...
Боже моййй.... Это прекрасноооо(°0°) в принципе от Холзи нельзя было ожидать плохово)
BU ŞARKIYA NİKAHI BASTIM!! EVLİYİM ARTIK
❤️❤️❤️❤️☺️💓💓💓💓💓💃
So I listened to every song. And I really think Halsey is transitioning and experimenting with her music on this album. Im disappointed in many of the songs. They almost reached the mark only to not go where they had potential to. Which is sad. I really wanted to enjoy this album, but just can't fully. It's definitely good. But not great. Some of the songs on this album feel rushed and unfinished. And it sometimes seems a bit too feminist and mainstream. Halsey can do much better and deeper content.  But this song and whisper are the best tracks to me.
THIS SONG IS SO F GOODDD
I love you. 💘
♥️
Already obsessed with this song 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
how do you do it..just how...you wonderful, beautiful human!
wonderful song unique it 💜💜💜
💜
I am not a WOMAN , I'm a GOD 🛐
Queen❤️

how can Halsey always release songs that speaks to my soul? She makes me feel every emotion on the lyrics and on her voice.
yes babe you are a good
i am not woman i am trash
I’ve waited so patiently for this new album. Just so happened to be the day after my birthday. 💜 It's been such a rough journey the last several years and Halsey’s music has gotten me through some of the darkest times. It's like she knew exactly what I was going through. My son knows her music so well that when he heard me listening to it, without him even knowing it was her, he asked is that Halsey?! 💜🌸 I will forever have respect for her and her masterpieces.
❤️
Halsey world domination
Who else found halsey from boy with lauv

Halsey, I'm crying
Yes you are my god.

She cant make a bad song
Queen ❤️
WHY AM I CRYING FOR THIS? HALSEY IS ONE OF A KIND!!! ❤️❤️😭
Taylor swift, Ed sheeran, Selena Gomez and Halsey all releasing music together to heal the world.
I really want to watch this film again and hope it is released outside of theaters! Especially now that I know the ending; it wasn’t what I expected, and I think in knowing the ending I’d get more out of a second showing. This sequence was where I finally began putting things together.
ELA SABE QUE É FODA!!! Álbum sensacional, entregou tudo
Te amo mucho y amo esto
OMG ame😭❤
Wassup
GRACIAS HALSEY
