"I told ypu not to leave me unattended in the house" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Hi 1:29
Drug part ruined it lol
I‘ve been waiting for „What have you done?“.😁
Lmaooooo  ....   😅
Don’t listen Keep the pranks coming
Fanfriggingtastic lol. And Rox I love that outfit it's amazing, and I love blue🩵
Well done Mark, well done! 👏👏
Are the kids alright?! 😂😂
Please add more videos to the LadBaby and sons channel
Why is this not above the bed?
Rox, where did you get your outfit? Is it from your collection? Love it
Ok so the kids know what sausage rolls are but you need to record when explaining the sex and drugs 😂😂😂
I mean why not 😂😂
This had me cackling 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm 7 years  old and I watch with my nana
😂😂😂👍
U should get one that says yesss mate
Roxx is such a great sport! And clearly exhausted 😅
I actually really like it 😂🙌🏼
This made my day 😂😂😂
house looks awesome
We all know what you was doing when she was away wink wink
Roxy looked so beautiful. Tired but beautiful.
Roxy, I love you guys. You just are the craziest best people ever😂❤.
I thought you would of had a Nottingham forest badge instead that would look cool
These two idiots annoy me !!! Grown ups acting silly .. how embarrassing 🙈
Love the outfit Roxy, where's it from?
So many videos are “let’s play a prank, one pretends to be offended, jokes on the prankster, I actually love it and find it funny”. PLEASE get a new format.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
😂 She in no way shape or form needs that crutch! 😂

Rox just KNOWS when Mark has done something.  It's a 6th sense now, because she knows him too well.  "What have you done?" 😂🤣
