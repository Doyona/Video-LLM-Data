I just bought this phone
It didn’t got scratched
Hey! 👋🏼 I got my S23 ultra back in OCT 2023. So it's been  a solid two years. I'm a heavy user of music/YouTube, camera usage, and gaming apps. This phone has been one of the best purchases I've ever had.   Still going strong as I have 512GB and only used around 150 GB. For me, this thing is a beast. I don't see a point in upgrading as nothing has caught my eye. The size, yes but it's a trade off compared to the other perks. 😊
Finally watching on my s23 ultra Upgraded from iPhone 11 pro max
I want to see you do this to a pos iphone.
Gosh.. I hate you so much 🤣 Using an old outdated pheap phone and seeing someone destroying one of the best phones in my opinion literally breakes my heart. It would take me my whole lifetime to buy that phone (even a used broken screen  one)🥀💔
3:21 this part is like you watching a horror movie when the ghost snap the neck of it victim
落としたり投げたりしてほしかったです
05:45 60 seconds☠️
7:20 que genial el note 10 plus, aunque tengo el s23 ultra
"the s pen can be useful for a lot of things" *crack* 😀
My battery exploded in this phone, I did get it replaced, but I still like it a lot.
this whole video hurt my soul
Yo viéndolo en mi Samsung 23 ultra 😬😬😬😔
Lol so funny, I switched from my almost 6yr old Note 10+ to an S23 ultra
nah that thing is bendable
This video hurts my heart!😢
Jerry!!!WHY!??!!
Just got my s23 ultra lols 😢
Watching  this on my S23 Ultra💀💀💀💀💀💀
This phone is built like a tank
So beautiful phone ❤
I cracked the screen by placing my phone down on the table. I'm dreading getting it fixed for $400.
Super helpful and interesting, ended up buying one for myself. I do plan to donate more in the future even if it's not a lot of money. Love what you do! Also would you ever consider doing the base model of the Motorola razr 2024 (moto razr 50), I really want to see the hinge right behind the screen, me and my family members get a really annoying bump on the right side under the screen.
S23 ultra ❤
The destruction of this phone hurts my soul😢
Watching on my s23 ultra 😅
Who else goes to his page to see him break the phone you are watching on💀🙏
My boy burnt the shit out of that screen. This whole video was painful to watch. Especially because I own a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and couldn't ever imagine this stuff happening to my phone.😭
Me watching this with my s23 ultra 💀. I traumatised it
Guys probably known as the angel of death amongst phones.
Does anyone have a gap Between screen and frame?
Why do you always do these videos on the higher end versions of the galaxy phones? Instead of s23 its s23 uktra etc @jerryrig
Is the base model as durable as the premium ones ?
watching this is annoying lol
OK THIS REALLY HURTS..
Im trying so hard to take care of mine, its the last curved edge Ultra, i really love it and wont upgrade until i can afford the new ROG or Red Magic. All i want is non-stop 120hz for ALL my games and apps, i really dont care foe the adaptive and the fact that even when you turn adaptive off, its still "sort of" adaptive 😂
5:43 that didn't age well 😄
💔💔💔
Nothing to learn in your videos, just increasing e-waste
Bro just tore everything apart
You really don't like samsung
Can I please have the spoiled phones 😢
Im a year late, i use the 23ultra and never seen a teardown for it. Damn the screen can take some heat
Just bought a refurbished one for half price let's gooooo
Only reason I get a new phone is if my previous phone is showing green lines and barely able to stay on for 10 minutes at a time before blacking out. I ended up getting an s23 ultra, and I have loved this thing ever since (for the whole 20 months I've had it, anyway)
Watching this with my s23 ultra 😂😂
watching this cuz i scratched my phone last night uuggghhh
Bullshit display, not worth at this price. 149990 rs when launched, now around 70000 rs price. Why Samsung like this?
Plzz do test for xiomi 14 civi ,love from INDIA ❤
Watching it on a S23 ultra makes it even more difficult to watch 😢
Can you open it to change it's battery ? Or the case is plastic welded/super glued?
My Heart skipped a beat when the S Pen cracked.
2 mins of silence for s-pen death ( it hurts when you are from middle family, and want to try new tech and evry thing) like if you are happy with your family ❤❤
If companies are using recycled materials in their products then they shouldn't cost diamonds 😂😂
Watching today the review of the s24 Ultra... can someone actually agree, besides the scratching part, than s23 Ultra is better ?
Its a fake video😂 because  its not new mobile 😂 because somone misscall are showing😂
If the mobile is new one. then how to someones  misscall in display😂
3:20 Broke the S-pen like a wafer😭
Jerry is a wizard! He predicted the half price sale now in India a year ago 😂
From My Note 9 to S23 Ultra 👏 👌 Good Job SAMSUNG.
It can destroy by a simple udate
Aside from being brutally unnatural condition, I'm left asking myself, what was the point? Do you actually know someone that treats their phone like this?
From mi 13 to s23u 512gb with 12gb ram hits different
will screen survive if a hammer is dropped on screen with 1 to 2feet distance?
Is it damaged from the 60 second lighter test ?
3:22 FUNNY BROKEN S PEN
Such a beautiful phone, but they don't give chargers, if anyone remembers that samsung was the one who mocked apple for not giving chargers in their advertisements. Samsung looks such a hypocrite.
3:20 after watching this video I got a brand new s23 ultra and I was soo stupid I snapped my s pen because I was curious 💀💀😭😭
😢sinirim bozuldu
Upgraded to S23 Ultra from S9+ in february of this year, and goddamn i did not expect such a gargantuan jump in both features and quality. The s9+ is still being used by my dad btw, that thing has plenty of life left in it.
Next year of half price, that was a good one !
5:25 they are fight it is normal for apple fanboys.
Samsung be giving you a pen with and in thr phone instead of a headphone jack, expandable storage slot and charger in the box.
The right side picture came from the other phone while the left side came from the s23 ultra how did I know lol your eyebrows lifted in the galaxy note 10 while it didn't in the s23 ultra camera 😂
Bro looks like a hitman and his target is mobile phones
So painfull to watch when jerry break samsung latest phone
For the algorithm
Just like that, he snapped that S pen in two pieces!
Ouch!!! 😵‍💫
This guy has no idea what he's talking about.  S23U is a beast there is no comparison.
Upgraded to this from 6s plus, it lasted much longer than it had any right to and it was large for me at the time. The s23 is yuge
Dust and Water Resistance is a scam. I took my S23 Ultra into the swimming pool, now the phone got damaged, just after 16 months of use. I really regret buying this stupid expensive phone. Worst decision of my life. Can you suggest what should I do now?
Spen 💀
NO NO excuse to damage a good phone. Who caries a open blade woth their phone. Crazy
Hi! You should test Huawei Kunlun glass. There is reason they are banned.
I think the left picture was the s23u am i right
Why the glue on back panel is so weak?
This is a very disturbing video
Knowing the price of this piece of plastic with battery and touch screen in my country, I assume that I suffered a lot watching this video, which seemed like monetary audiovisual torture to me.
I'm very happy with my s23ultra 👍
My heart aches as i am watching this on my s23 ultra
He talks about the phone like a sponsor while destroying it
2:31 THAT HURT
Bro I'm stressing watching this
حرام عليك عم بتقطع قلبي انت وعم تخربه
Upgrated to this from iphone 11 pro max and was let down after two months. Went for a jog daily with phone in my pocket and now my screen has a weird black screen effect that requires me to shake or tap my phone a bit hard till it pops back on
"next year for half price" he is right, I am here for the half price
Just used recycled materials for your chargers is it too hard from these companies to do it.
ouch that hurts it´s 1200 usd
Watching this video on my galaxy S23 Ultra lol
S23 regular will pass the bend test or not
I have exactly the same Galaxy Note 10+ for nearly 3 and a half years and it is almost brand new. I never drop it and never used any case because every case is ruining its slick and elegant lines. The only protection I ever used is full body protection film. Nothing else 🙂
I did something dumb with my s23, tossed it onto my memory foam mattress, it bounced up and landed on top of my iphone 13, craxked my screen, ouuuch
this video seems different from his others. the video seems bigger...and it fill up my screen more. I like it
Nokia has a new rival
I have only just now upgraded from a note 9 to an s23 ultra. The only reason for it was 2 parts. 1, Security Updates. 2, Speed. I'll use this for the next 4 to 5 years until it too runs out of updates. I originally got the Note 9 refurbished and did the same for the S23. You can save a ton that way.
Why ?
Well i got my s23 after my poco f1 broke after its 4-5 years of service and surviving that long with a broken frame and slightly burnt screen and now failing battry    But do u know the fun part?   Few days ago i tried to start it on a whim AND IT CAME ALIVE so now i have 2 phones 😂 also i know most ppl won't read this much but if u do and attention span is not   depreciated high five 👋
I actually am 100% certain of which picture came from which phone. It's pretty obvious that the picture on the right is from the s23 ultra. It's not only significantly more detailed up close (I did have to walk up to my 75" 4k screen and study it closely to see that though), but also the time on your watch combined with the fact that you told us you took the s23 pic first pretty much gives the game away. Nice try though! 😂😂
The screen easily breakable
Please Test Samsung Galaxy A54❤
Well from s8 plus to s23 ultra is like going to the moon.
Galaxy a22
😬I was not prepared for all that. that first razor blade to the side had my butt cheeks clenching like it was me u were cutting 😂
finally watching it because i want to go iphone to android and i want buy it now in 2024 😢 because of its high price 😢
Rocket surgeon! Lol.
Wow ur voice is so soothing
Подари мне его. 👍
I spent around $200 on a phone 5 years ago. I only upgraded it this year because my mother's company had a promotion on phones, she didnt want a new one and we could get a s23+ for $280. Now, with the s23+, I dont think Ill get a new one unless it breaks or becomes incompatible with something I need in daily life.
He might be a sadist ...! Why are you doing this? You literally killed a non living phone😢
Well it's January 2024 I have a note 20 Ultra the s 23 is going to be my next phone
Watching it on my S23 Ultra ❤
One drop and the back glass done with a case
S23 plz
I want s24 ultra tear down
S22 ultra died after 5 seconds in 5 cm depth pool water. that is, only half of the phone was submerged - the cameras side. can i expect 23 ultra for surviving it ?
can't wait for s24 ultra already 😢
Where is the S24 video? Where is it, Jerry? I need to see the scratch resistance of the armour glass!
The commentary😂
These videos always make me cringe deeply
Apple is the largest phone seller not samsung and Apple does waay more than Samsung in advertising
I have a iphone xs max 512gb i got it when it came out and it gets the newest updates and for tik tok watching it is as good as the 15 pro max i also have one of these but the xs max is better then to 15 pro max i would say but not from the performance but i just like it more then the 15 pro max
Yeah I got Samsung galaxy s24 ultra video on this video
When S24 ultra review?
i wil never buy before u rig s24 ultra!! So please do it as ASAP
S24 Ultra

bro snapped that S Pen with no hesitation😂
Samsung jest needs to remove the buttons and putting side haptic buttons so u cant easily remove them Samsung u had 1 fuxing job lol laughs as iphone and experia 1 mark 3 user where that would never happen lol Samsung's a joke they cant figure this out lol $1,300 peace of garbage
Can you let me call her blind or you don’t see very well that picture you took the one on my right would be you’re right where you’re sitting in the video. It looks way worse than the one the love the left is crystal clear and the colors are vibrant not vibrant is the right, and the blue, but on point towards the aesthetic of the room More clear on the left, not even close look at the one on the right. Get away from now. The one on the left my left is much better than the one that rides one of the right is trash you fit your hands all blurry crystal clear like you took time to take it with the one on the left it’s closer to the screen too as well. If you’re gonna compare things, would you compare the height of Shaquille O’Neal and Mutombo with the standing back 5 feet from shack and you standing in front of them 15 feet away you see what I’m saying if it was equivalent to you standing 6 feet away with something 10 inches big tall tall and one smaller behind it 5 feet whatever it is 4 feet you can’t even see it for one thing and in different lighting. You’re perspective is lighting it your picture obviously the one on the left is your Samsung on the right has better color most definitely but your Samsung you took time to take the picture of me. It’s regular Reno move by somebody that’s trying to advocate for their favorite Phone, now I can’t trust you because you’re making decisions and you’re showing favoritism to your phone you’ve had for three years that you’ve been missing out phones. The iPhone 12 Pro Max is much better than the android that you have. I tell you that iPhone Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max is the best phones I’ve ever had is best one I ever ever had and you can just add other with by the way when you get caught up just ask to set your alarm for you that’s what you’re supposed to do that’s why it’s on your phone. That’s why Siri invented basically all the other Alexis, and everything the google does now was invented by iPhone first, so come on man I’m sorry to say I can I can congratulate you with all your views and all your subscribers and everything but exactly what is it that you’re trying to tell me your favorite android you obviously don’t like iPhone for some reason and I like iPhone and I like android let’s be real I’m gonna switch I’m gonna switch to an android right now and I’m gonna do about it I got to android a bunch of androids and I’ll take what I think. I will, sir and my dog and you I think you’re incredibly great speaker and I enjoy your tea or your performances, but I can just tell you one thing and not the other but listen to this take an iPhone 12 Pro Max and I accidentally fell cause I’ve epilepsy, right I wanna maybe make a video about this cause I’m going to actually fell and they say there’s an old screen right and iPhone 12 Pro Max when I fell my phone fell out of my hands it hit the spot. I guess you got a sprocket or whatever from the metal piece from the plug-in in the wall cord and it punctured a hole in the screen and when did it puncture through the LCD and made it ink for out of it it looks like we got on my hands and everything and right now I’m looking at the phone I had to buy a display and bought LCD display again because I’m getting ready to switch phones. I’m probably gonna switch companies I’m gonna video switching from Verizon and why everybody should never get Verizon expensive and out-of-state and worthless company that ever existed, they will not help you for anything even after they screwed you and made you sign up to buy an iPhone Pro Max it’s not iPhone 12 Pro Max it’s a fake LCD screen and I’m making a video about that right now. Yeah so watch out for that and look at the compare the picture of that Moto Motorola jeep pure instance, auto G5 pure whatever $85 phone he’s got a better visual than iPhone 12 Pro Max. I’m not shitting you just look at any new android display it looks crystal compared an iPhone 12. It was supposed to be not very far away from the 15. Actually, I realize I have iPhones got a lot of personal favoritism towards themselves as you have to barter and dig and you know you can’t drop your phone have insurance or warranty. They don’t cover it if it covers very little things to have a warranty or insurance on your phone everyone so just watch out when you get insurance on your phone because the main problem with phones being repaired is not because they’re hacked is not because they’re dropped, your phone breaks and you drop it. They will not pay for your phone unless you distinctively pay for that distinctly pay for that and you better pay for they strict me with Digital Secure and digital premier or something if you have the same damn picture on it. I thought it was covered cause not covered with all the jargon and small print so guys watch out whenever you switch your phones and also want you to video on prepaid versus postpaid and tell me besides data throttling which one’s better is there one better because I can get a free phone right now if you’re on the ACP program get a free phone right now if you’re not paying $110 a month and you keep doing that that’s what I’m doing because I get throttled on my day, but I’m about to switch back. Thanks guys sorry man I do like your videos. Have a good one bye
S24 ultraaaaa.....
Try with tank 2, i wanna see it
S24 ultra test
Waiting for s24 ultra video
Waiting on S24 ULTRA
Waiting for the durability test for S24
I upgraded from my s8 :)
s24 u please
if u want to give the phone i need it
👎👎👎👎👎
This is incredibly painful and cringy to watch, knowing how premium and costly this phone is, to witness such destruction, hurts me deeply!
The moon shot is AI. Its fake! Stupid review.
Nothing just watching stuff get destroyed that I can't buy😂
The anxiety I got during this video went through the roof! Thank you for the indepth coverage!
Its not fair, brake it like you did with iphone 15. Else we unsubscribe
Samsung has always done well, but if you’re switching from Apple to Samsung, I wouldn’t go less than the 23 ultra
Yo I forgot YouTube had ads
Exactly, we want innovation, not marketing. Samsung used to be the king of innovation but we see more innovation in chinease phones like oneplus. Zero reason we don't have 65 watt charging minimum.  Edit: Can you test how strong a Dbrand skin is compared to a case?
This was painful to watch from my s23 Ultra
just went from iphone 7 to s23 ultra. it was like moving up an entire decade overnight lol. getting a new phone every year or two is for the birds. these things perform well for a LONG time if you treat them well. GREAT CONTENT!
Every year the gorilla glass number goes up but the durability test numbers always seem to stay the same.
انت يراد لك موبايل مدرع 😅
Watching this from S23 ultra 😬
Oh, I was expecting a drop test, some water resistence test, etc... but its good to know that a knive will... well, actually scratch and danify the screen and the metal parts, great job mate. Keep up with the amazing work.
I haven't seen half price on a flagship phone a year after release in the past 5 or so years. This is just not happening anymore these days.
2:11 left NOTE 10+,  right S23Ultra, detail was the ring.
my power button fell off and i bought the keys for it. does it mean that i can just put it back in without tearing my phone down?
Eu juntando dinheiro pra tentar comprar um desse ai vem esse doido ai e começar a destruír o celular poxa odeio ser pobre
I have a samsung galaxy s9. And tmoble offered me 900$credit to trade it it  for a new phone. I want the s22ultra and i hope i can keep it longer then my s9, ive had the s9 sinc it dropped lol
I just got my S23 Ultra (same Green colour) and it's an amazing phone. Upgraded from my 3-year-old S20 FE in Cloud Navy and the S23 Ultra's rectangular shape, 200MP camera, S-Pen, and battery is what makes the wait for my contract to expire worth it! Definitely recommend the S23 Ultra over the 15 Pro Max!
Propaganda 😜
They are not strong at all my phone cracked in the 1st Drop
Samsung continues to innovate even if they sports the same phone design the past year.
What is this guy doing 😢😢😮
He snapped the s pen and I instantly said wtf
Yea i thiught i was tripping. Aint no way my s10 plus competing with the s23 camera 🙈
Watching on my S23 ultra❤
This hurts me to see
Companies are keeping this matter secret for their own benefit. The cost of manufacturing OLED screens is low. People do not understand this matter.  Anyone who suffers from migraines or depression should change their phone to the iPhone 11 and will see their health will improving  I will publish a study soon on the reason for the large number of suicides in South Korea. One of the reasons is the large amount of depression caused by AMOLED screens. because South Korea only has AMOLED screens for all device !!!
The sidescrape made me feel sick
Pq fazes isto eu amo esse celular nunca comprei mais sou apaixonado manda um aqui desse aqui pra casa pelo amor de Deus
My dad just broke his Note 8. Bought the S23U and neither of us are considering it an upgrade. How do phones get worse? Insane..
The cringe 😩😩😩😩 lol thats my favorite phone 😂😂
Whats heart breaking? you have a phone you want and cant buy and jerry rigging every part of it.
Lmfao how he snapped the pen💀
2:33 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa STOP!!!!! I'm dead 😵
I know its a durability test but when you scraped the edges with the box knife I just cringed and huddled in my seat
Keep putting the same bad camera in the phone and the same ram so if you use it for hotspot take for ever to download
no ads for me lol
As a someone who’s obsessed with order, cleanliness and neatness, the amount of vandalism in this video gave me a panic attack.
I wonder when is a phone going to explode because he is heating the battery
I Wonder when is a phone going to explode because he is heating the battery
Idk why this guy talks so much ish about Samsung but not apple?
Upgraded my note 9 after almost 6 years :D
S23 ultra can not be bent vs iphone 15
My heart hurts to see this
I feel like upgrading is a luxury now...  If I *could* upgrade every time they released a new Galaxy, I absolutely would. But at the price? I can't. I absolutely can't. I'd either not be able to eat or homeless if I did. The only reason I managed to get the s23 right now (literally today, Dec 12th) is because my mother bought it for me as my christmas present. I'm coming from a Galaxy s10. But trust me, I have desperately wanted to upgrade every single time a new Galaxy was released. I hate that I can't. But money is *so* tight nowadays. As a kid, I used to get piles of presents because my parents were upper middle class. This year, at 31 years old, my mom & I are exchanging 1 present because she is poor & I'm in poverty. Funnily enough, she is doing the same thing she was doing back then in the same state in the US, just a handful of hours away from my childhood home, but that comes out to the status of "poor" nowadays, whereas back in the early 90's the same exact thing came to mean "upper middle class". I was making enough money with 1 single job at a grooming parlour to support myself & my dog when I was 18. Now at 31, despite having multiple degrees & currently being in medical school, I can't even find a job & am homeless, living in my parents guest bedroom. Unfortunately, a LOT of people I know are in this situation & have to work 2-3 jobs or get 3-4 roommates in a place that does not have 4-5 bedrooms  just to simply survive. Does anyone think anyone in these situations could possibly upgrade when they actually want to? It's a pipe dream, unfortunately.  My galaxy s10 trade in was worth ~$400. It barely made a dent. 🙃 If phones were affordable or at least affordable with upgrades (and they really should be now that they're essential to everyday life), I think we would see a TON of people taking advantage of this.
I just got this phone today and man this hurts.
While mine s23u got scratches from being in empty pocket xD
My situation 😮while watching this video is that I do not have even a quarter of the price of this phone
Maan hold up. I can't watch. Noooooooooooooo.
I literally upgraded from a S9edge but got a good deal on black Friday.
Do you do a drop test,  I'm more likely to drop my phone than hold a lighter to the screen for 60 seconds, lol.
I tried but can't finish watching this video !! Why?!!
Both are good 😢😢 Please give me?
Ok ok ok! I'll talk! Just tell me what you want to know. 😂😂😂
If Dbrand added the magsafe adapter to their android lineup it would be amazing.
Please give me the phone instead of totchering it😢
I just upgrade from a Note 8 to this phone. Also did not need to really upgrade ....tough i had some issues with the screen on the old phone (colors faded out and the black lost its blackness -> dont know if gaming on it was the issue) and some storage issues (was kinda full lol).
The way the snapped the s pen 😭
Sir case very costly 😢 my iphone 13
crying me bcoz i get 50$ per month as salary
I upgraded from OnePlus 6T to S23 Ultra.  Really impressed,  Samsung has come a long way.
The left photo is clearly much better come on man 2:10
the moon photos it takes have been proven to be AI generated.  big reddit and news articles about it.
Yo my heart hurts every time u scratch that phone... Do u know what's it's like living in a 3 world country? That phone is worth a car where I live bruh ..
Got Samsung advertisement 😂😂
S23 best phone i ever owned.
I upgrade all the time bc i drop my phone at least once a week......
It feels so bad watching this if you are looking for one 😂
Green is the least green color to produce.
this video hurt me soo much
Oh c'mon... S23 Ultra is a seriously good phone. Maybe the best on the market at the moment.
where are you getting 1200 the cheapest im finding is 1350
I upgrade every year because I can afford it, and it's good for the economy.
Watching this in my s23ultra😢..
It was at 2:30 that i had to quit seeing this video.
I just realized that it has those stickers on the sides.
I love Samsung but I had to switch to Apple because of those god awful curved screens that break so easily and you can’t find a decent screen protector that holds up. Go back to flat screens please and I may come back.
This video was very very difficult to watch , but at the same time it gives you an idea of how durable this phone is .... Cannot wait to get my dream phone  someday , WHAT A W!!!!!!!!!!!
Lord I see why you said close your eyes 😂 I wasn’t ready for what you did to that poor phone 😂
Can you do s23 FE please
This was painful to watch, but I guess that's the point lol. Great video
What does the false looking door on the side under the volume buttons
oh damn If I had😔 My dream phone
Samsung realized you don't need to innovate anymore once they seen Apple fans buying the same phone every year
But DID THE camera get scratched??? I can't see it well on my screen. 🤔
YOU are the only one i trust for a pone reviews
Just got this phone on Amazon black friday for $899 for the 256gb version. Definitely worth it for me at that price. I'll use the phone for 5+ years.
Instead of testing gimme the phone 😅
i upgraded from a SH-100 to the S23 Ultra and i dont see a difference. There is no difference.
Who the hell upgrades their phones more often than 4 years? I'm literally using mine until they just die or run out of whole support (replaced Note 3 with Note 8 once messenger stopped working due to too old OS).  In my country, any normal person would upgrade their phones that often, new S23U is literally 1.5 of minimal wage, nothing person with brain can handle. I'm looking for used Note20U as my Note 8 is kinda beat up, but those are expensive AF as well... Would more likely get scratched one by your than pay sick money for these.  Fun fact - my friend from Canada says they have N20U for like $200, which is literally STEAL, not a deal. Why wouldn't i ship? Of course - taxes! Would make it literally same price as market ones.
Hello is there video for basic s23?
I think jerry's note 10 plus is the most legendary and well known phone on the planet
All I'm saying is that OnePlus not only gives charger but 65-80-100 watts fast charger depending on model you buy.
i mean the main reason for the simple upgrades is it gives them product to fall back on when a crazyer phone like the flips don't do well an issued that killed LG phones. were as apple sold the same phone every year for longer with zero innovation but a lot of ovation .
Tesla dont have to spend for marketing as Elon himself is the brand Ambassador of Tesla.   Samsung does not have any such personal brand ambassador. So they need to spend on marketing.  Consider if Elon would buy majority stake in Samsung, will samsung have to spend any money on marketing??? No.
Can you open your Note 10+ please?
The s23 ultra does have the option (unlike the 22 ultra) where you can keep 1440p on in power saving mode
I didnt want mine in green it was all they had.. but its growing on me lmao
Number one reason i stick with Samsung is because they bullshit everyone about how green they are.  😆
What will happen to the phones u rig
I know the galaxy s23 ultra is the selfie in the right just because of how much it brightens everything up. One aspect of the camera I don't like. Your eyebrows are so much darker in the note selfie. Eyes are completely different too. But the S23 ultra did what it always does and over brightens everything. I'm saying the right side is the 23 Ultra  Edit: I do still love my 23 Ultra I just prefer it to NOT over brighten everything.
Ich bin zufrieden mit meinem Note 10 Ultra. Ich wollte mir S23 kaufen aber wegen ohne scheiß Ladegerät und ohne SD card will ich nicht kaufen. Die Marketing ist scheiße, die denken nur um Geld!
I just got the s23 ultra, and below the power button, There is a oval section. A little bigger than the volume rocker. At first I thought it was a haptic trigger, anyone have an Idea what it is?
Got my s23 ultra yesterday and damn its good I had a realme 8 and prior was a oppo a37  But this device is smooth.Too smooth tbh😂 The only hate I have is there is no app lock feature Not the secure folder one but a actual app lock that even my realme 8 had😢
Noooooooo plz
Just WHY?
3:19  The S Pen is useful for a lot of things...       ⚡SNAP⚡
🤤🤤🤤🤤📶📶🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😭😭
But if you have that phone you didnt do things like this  for exampel if you have a phone case an a screen protecter you not gonna be broke it
i really couldn't bear watching this, (bro just give it to me if you want to break this so badly!). but it is what it is, i guess.😅
I just upgrade from Note 8 to S23 ultra I could see my Note 8 slowly dying so I had to upgrade to new phone actually after almost 6 years my Note 8 still worked like the first day but the battery and storage couldn't meet my expectations anymore I wish S23 ultra could save me thousand dollars for another 6 years 😊
Oooohh nooooohhh😥
S23 Ultra is one of the most powerful phones rn, only losing for some chinese phones like Redmagic and Poco.  Snapdragon 8gen 2 is my reason tu upgrade because i dont give 2 fucks about cameras.
can anyone explain the scratch level test? how durable is level 6?
2:31 NO, STOP, MY EARS!!
Hi guys can someone please donate a phone for me. My S9 plus has given up on me  :(
You guys replace your phones before they stop working?
My keys scratched the screen like a butter. man, your videos need improve.
I want to but transparent case of s23 ultra
Watching him destroy expensive phone is both eye popping and stomach churning 🤢
The S pen is useful for a lotta things :- breaks S Pen 😂
Pls can u do a giveaway
Samsung is what Apple haters think Apple is and Samsung is not
3:21 “My favorite part of the s23 ultra..” **Snaps it like a rotten twig with literally zero effort** I died laughing at that.
For those that cant differentiate the photos the one on the left is the s23 one probably and the one on the right is the note 10+ Left photos has a face filter Right photo has lesser details on his hand, face has more freckles
Only reason I upgraded from s22 to s23 is the heating problem in s22
Eyyoo.. Now you have 2 S Pen 😂
Hey bro!!! This S23 ultra is a review unit or u buy a new s23?????
I think both Apple and Samsung have good choices this year, I’m happy with my 15 pro max, and my gf is happy with the s23 ultra. Just put a case and a screen protector and most phones will be fine.
Ayaaa...🥲🥲🥲instead  of damaging and destroying just to let others know how good or bad quality samsung is.....just give it to me one ...I really love and admire samsung galaxy s23 ultra series...bt it's in vain for iam broke and poor forever 😪😪😪🤧🤧🤧🤧
I just got ad of iPhone 15 😂😂
I'm a bit late on this, but the selfie on the right is clearly better. Better dynamic range and detail. Right is def S23U and left is N10+
Can you test the drop damage on the camera lenses?
Oh my God!!! You are a monster!!!
Spen 😢 dead
Watching this on my s23 ultra😅 it's still way beter than my old s9 tho
poor phone :(
Durability test ❎ ASMR ✅
the sim card hole next to the microphone hole. i wonder if that microphone would get damaged by accidentally poking it with the same tool u use to pop the simcard tray.
The note 10 plus in aura glow is still a beast
My favorite part I think is always the S pen snap 😅
My favorite part I think is always the S pen snap 😅
I had no choice but to buy the S23 Ultra a few days ago. I was heartbroken when my Note 10+ gave up the ghost.
Ended up getting one and love it, yea it was expensive (like $1400.00) for the 512gb model but now i dont have to worry about storage for a long time also 12gb of ram will do this device well for the years to come
Que hermoso es ver destuir a un samsung 😃
It's like watching Dexter calmly narrating as he proceeds to murder his target😂
"rocket surgeon" 😆
You lost me when you said, not too shabby....
After seeing this you cannot tell me iphone is better than samsung
Can I know the branch of phone case in the video. It's very nice. I would order it.❤
❤
😂❤
Honestly if the selfie on the right was from the Note 10 then there genuinely isn't a reason to upgrade
I'm certain that the right photo came from the S23 Ultra.
How do you handle not having OS updates on your Note 10? Do you use financial apps still?
When you take into consideration the cost of a gaming pc vs a small handheld device that is fairly limited, I was really scratching my head where the pricing is coming from.
Snapping the s pen like a toothpick 😅
Wow my favorite phone but unfortunately I don't have money to buy it🤧
Do a34 durability test 🙏
One day your fingers will get damage when your are distroying  !! Get well soon!!
There is nothing in this entire world that hurts me more than this Channel
It seems like this review is a durability test with you complaining about how much you hate samsung
I like your moms advice for real 💖
Hey Jerry! (or anyone else really), is 950$ a good deal for the 256GB model?
apples the largest manufacturer of phones globally
Here still using my OnePlus 6... after 5 years I'm now considering an upgrade...   Or maybe hold it a bit more to check the s24... or to see if apple fix the heat and resistance issues with the 15 pro max
had an non 5g  iphone 11 stolen at the airport and samsung gave me a sweet deal to buy this S23 ultra really cheap (at the same price as a s22) so i took the deal ! and i'm loving it but i agree, if i had a s21 or 22 ultra the upgrade isn't worth the deal
Dam im not even a Samsung fan but DANG THIS LOOKS WORSE THAN THE IPHONE
Other than diminished battery capacity/efficiency, I'm multiple years into a Samsung phone and not seeing a current reason to switch either.
as a broke person it hurts my eyes watching this
Well, Samsung is also a very big scumbag, they downgrade the camera of older phone models in software tweaking. I have a M51, it used to click great images, then it don't anymore. They infact removed FHD 60fps video capability and limited it to 30. A reason why i purchased the phone. They do other stuff like downscaling games to make them look bad to play and limit the fps.
I upgrade every year. But i also buy $200-$300 phones
Bro sent me a s23😂😂. Wtf u break that pen like 5th grade sharing one pencil..😮
The best phone ive ever enjoy to have it
look at the watch and you'll know which picture came from which phone 😂😂
Omg it hurt my soul when you were scratching the sides of the phone. I just got the S23 Ultra to replace my Note 10+ with a dead type C port(don't worry it's being repurposed). This video does give me some confidence that this phone will hopefully last me many years. Might get a type C port cover for this one though.
better than the iPhone 15 lmao
Watching this on my new s23 ultra made my heart hurt and made me buy an all new dbrand grip case 😂 I plan on keeping this for the whole update life they promised (5 years)
Stayed for the voice,  no homo.
I felt my bone breaking as he broke the spen
S pen be like: Why bro why?🙃
My wallet hurt watching this video
I've got a note 20 ultra, and after 3 years, I've broken the back glass and had that fixed to the tune of $350, and now the front glass is broke. I'm not paying for that repair. Lol. Plus memory on the note 20 is 128g, I'm maxed. Lol
first and last video I watch of this man
Using a mate 10 pro for 6 years. Have to upgrade because software obsolescence. Hardware is fine except usb-c port getting tricky. Back then you got a screen protection a silicon protection and a charger in the box.
Decepcionante...
Well actually ita not the 200 mp sensor taking the 100x moon shots they are taken by that periscope lens combined with digital zoom upto 100x
hey jery can you give me that cellphone pleas 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹😢😢😢😢
How this guy sounds super chill and relax, when hes breaking some expensive shit. 😂😂
I still use the plastic m31
😓
Im still on my samsung s8
💀💀😂😂😂😂tearing samsung apart
Me watching on my s22 ultra that i saved up for 8 months. 😮😮😮
I cringe and laugh at this guy’s approach.  👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👌🏾
Lol design engineers at Samsung must have taken this very personal
He is very right.. Apple and Samsung are just getting brutal... All talk and just trying to take advantage of people 😔
S23 is just incredible! Even the Iphone15 pro max was not able to clear your durability test.
right is the new one. why? because its easier to see you're getting older
Not sure how you can say it isnt clear which photo is from which phone. The picture on the right is ABSOLUTELY 100% from the new S23 Ultra. The left picture is from your old phone. Huge improvments glaring all around.
Loving my S23 Ultra. Upgraded from the burn-thru half destroyed S10+ and it's amazing
2:16 the right one is note 10 plus and the left is s23 ultra
as a cheap, penny pincher this video really hurts
Glad to see im not the only one still using the note 10 plus
Still having an S8 plus, can't afford to upgrade, and seeing phones getting destroyed here just hurts, BTW, big fan
In Germany, we call it Sachbeschädigung
i like that he's wearing the casio F91w
Thats my dream to buy and you just killed it bro. wow
The picture on the left is the S23 Ultra, and the one on the right, is the Note 10+. Agreed with Zack, not that different.
I can't hearing the scraching process on metal. Sound that some people are sensitive to. Who is similar like me? 😖😖😖
Your channel is the reason I refuse to upgrade my phone.  You’ve shown me that there isn’t a need if it isn’t better than my current one.  Also, the EU laws that mean all batteries have to be removable.
Really ? LEft photo looks sharper, has better colour tone mapping and better Bokeh. So i'm assuming it's the S23 Ultra and the washed out photo on the right is your Note 10 +. But still not reason for upgrade, Indeed.
Ma la spen è delicatissima...
Tesla does advertise! Just not tradionally.
😭noooooooo you scratched it
No advertisement 😀  samsung in this video 😂😂😂
Apple proved that consumers care more about advertising then they do about innovation. Samsung has merely learned its lesson
I'm still using the Note 9, I'm not seeing enough intervention in the software and features to upgrade. Samsung and Apple and Google only seem to be interested in improving the cameras. In Australia the photos are close to $2000, not woth it for just a camera software update and a extra lens.
i'll just wait for s24 next jan then. iphone's too dissapointing.
Still using my s20 plus till now.
вранье. У меня такой телефон, экран разбился при падении с высоты 50 сантиментров. Всего 3 недели использовала. Так что прочности там нет, у парня реклама видимо оплачена.
Lol 2:31 hurt my teeth 😂
hilariously i had a zFlip5 ad on this vid lol
Upgraded from Note 10+ to Pixel 6 pro and couldn't stand the OS so just got this and absolutely love it! Hoping for least 4 years of use!! Thanks Zack for these awesome vids!
I got Samsung advertisement on this video
Samsung : Samsung galaxy s23 ultra Jerry : Samsung galaxy banana
@JR Just upgrade s23 ultra is a beast your s10 is old news trust
Not gonna lie i could tell a huge difference between the 2 selfies even tho u said we cant lol
The best phone in the world is also stunningly beautiful
What do you do with this smartphone after breaking it?Would you let me buy it from you please? 😅
Sadly, I really don't like the design of these lenses, hope they find a way to make it look better soon
Jerry can buy expensive phone but, the watch he wearing is oldest watch🤣
I hate u.... 😭😭😭😭😭. You broke my Heart😭😭🥺🥺😭😭😭😭. At least u can give it to me😭😭😭😭
I upgrade this phone from a note 8. 😮
I am now saving up to buy the s23 ultra for when the s24 releases, so it's much cheaper. I have the s10 plus right now. From all the videos I've seen it looks like a massive upgrade, though I am going to miss the headphone jack.
Still better than the 15 pro max that just came out
I want to upgrade from my budget A12 to this phone, and this really seems worth the price for me
BLOW TORCH THE PHONE 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Who is here after 15 pro max test😂
I upgraded to this from the Note10+. It started getting slow.
Marcus Brownlee "wonder what i can make a video of this week" Jerry  "So im gonna kill a phone"
Wow
3:18 "The S-pen is useful for a lot of things"  *breaks in half like a twig*
মোবাইলটা না ভেঙ্গে আমারে দিয়ে দিতেন 😂
Thr iPhone 15 broke so easily from  the flex bend test
Better iPhone 15 Pro Max more durable 😂
This hurts 😅
People say apple overcharge for pro models and yet Samsungs equally priced flagship uses aluminium and has buttons that come off, am I the only one who notices this?
Casio F-91W the best wristwatch ever
Still blows my mind they send you these just to destroy  awsome job
I got one of those... that hurt my soul a lil bit bruh lol
Me, working 3 jobs to earn money to buy s23 ultra someday watching my dream phone being tortured. 💔 Good test though, I will be more careful when I finally have the phone in the far future.
As much as I don't like Apple, Id still take an iPhone over a Samsung any day of the week. Samsung may have good cameras but the rest of the phone is just BORING. The shape, the design, the UI, just all of it lacks any sort of personality. Every single Samsung ive had has also been pretty unreliable. From corrupted Kernels to swollen batteries and poor structural integrity, just awful phones. Been using Asus phones (the ROG 5 right now) for a while now and theyve been pretty great.
I recently upgraded my phone to the s23 ultra recently and I love it. And the last time I got a new phone was 4 years ago.
I don't know about others, but I checked both images from 2:10 without knowing which is which, and the right image looks obviously clearer and better to me. I'm watching the video on a 1440p monitor, and it didn't take me more than 5 seconds to realise the right image looks better. Maybe I just know what to look for since I'm a tech nerd. After "guessing", I went back in the video and checked the angles that you took the photos at, and seems like I was right.
And people make memes about iPhone having alot of camera lenses 😂😂😂😂
Seriously , You looks like johny sins 😂❤
Please use hand gloves for your use😊.
I change my phone whenever it is lost or completely shattered and unrepairable. Even then I still don’t upgrade to the newest model just one that is going to be supported for another couple years
I don't know about you guys but I am in pain 😬🤧
Still rocking my note 9. Changed battery recently though.
Damn i would cry as phones in South Africa is like twice the price they are in America
I have the note 9 and also havent found a reason to upgrade lol. Though the cameras on the new phone do be a little tempting but not $1200 tempting
Notice when Jerry scratches the screen on a Samsung it’s “normal scratching”, but when a iPhone scratches it’s “already scratching at a level 7”. Jerry may be the world’s biggest iPhone hater.
I don't get why you'd want super breakable glass on the back of your phone.. Can someone please explain this lack of logic?
I just upgraded form Note 5 to this.
i use adblock so i didnt get any ads lol
On the right was the S23 Ultra 100%
2:14 this is so true lol, I don't even know why all the tech geeks hype it up so f* much😂
I just can't watch it on my S23 ULTRA. TOO PAINFUL.
Wow you can scratch aluminium with steel?! Who would've thought?! What a dumb test lmao
So glad I found your videos! Love your voice and everything! Great work
you not broke phoon. you broke my Heart
Spen probably my favourite part of the ultra line up   *Snaps it in half
I am feeling sick 😱 good video
I got a otterbox and a screen protector for my s23 ultra and my screen cracked and went black after falling less than a foot onto the ground. It also started calling 911 on its own over and over
if 3.5 years is  long I have to say I have my iphone 8 since 2017😂😂
I’m triggered 😤
I'm perfectly content with my 22 ultra!
I didn't receive any ad from Samsung while watching your video, but below the video I was recommended to buy a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.😂
Brother needs to moisturise
The only time I upgraded was because of the s21 ultras 100x zoom. Since then, nothing special except for the integrated pen has changed
Seems like you started wearing the F91W from this video onwards. Would love to see its durability test 😉
3:19 -  in tears 😂😂
I waited 9 years to upgrade
Back to this video after seeing iPhone 15 pro max back glass getting cracked. Gorilla Glass Victus 2 is on🔥🔥🔥
No words on Apple's latest innovation!?
5:22 Use it up, wear it out, make it do or do without  I 100% releate to this🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You're beast tester 😂😆🤣
I wish they made a 6.1 ultra
Lol the advertisement rant vs tes got u a sub 🎉
Have not bought a new  Samsung since the s4 now I have the 23 ultra and love it
Im watching this on my s23u and im shitting bricks
This guy just yaps
I went from Samsung Galaxy Note S9 to iPhone and never looked back
This was painful.
I want a 19 second JRE video where there's no talking, just a sledgehammer and a rating
I will always love the snap of the s pen😂
One on left was s23 ultra
Wasn’t that moon picture feature proven to be a scam by Samsung adding craters with software to make you think you’re zoomed way in?
I bought s10 5G last year but I just destroyed it the back is just f up. Shuld I buy s22 ultra or S21 ultra?
I have the 23 ultra but I'm not wowed by it at all. I still honestly prefer my old oneplus alot more than the 23u
This is my phone and I only just dropped it and the whole back of the phone shattered. What do I do?
People who actualy got this phone does your s pen also smell like burnt plastic when you take it out ?
Looks like you have money to burn what a waste of money this hurts to watch
"The S pen is useful for a lot of things.    Cracks it":)
Watching this on my S23 ultra give me the shivers
cringe
Finally, after 5 years, I'll be upgrading to this beast from a Note 9 for another 5 years. Always wait people, you can help the planet with patience in the phone world, not only with recycled parts
I personally upgrade my phone about every 2-3 years or so. Like I just got the S23 Ultra because my old contact ran out.
Just wondering what will you do now that Samsung has stopped updating the best smartphone that ever was and untill further notice that will ever be.
I actually upgraded to the s23 ultra from the note 10+(The screen doesn't work on the note 10+)
NOOOOOOO 🥺
Hello I accidentally poke my sim card ejector into microphone. Do I damage it?
I was hoping to see you hit it with some stuff to see if the screen breaks, like do I really need this crappy screen protector?
Volume keys are not very heat resistant and can easily stop working
I think the only thing is missing on here is an IR... What is your opinion on that ?
Jerry I love your Note 10 + especially the CD 💿 color. But upgrading from the S10 would be pointless
Left from the note 10
Even Nvidia isn't so scummy at least Ray Tracing and DLSS is free
My flip 3 went, so I started a new plan and got one, tbh not bad
Had my last phone for 5 yeas hoping this one does another 5
Get a screen protector and put it on before you do anything. The phone screen scratches extremely easy
I still waiting for 3 months to buying this..phone.saving 3 month salary 😄😄
I gave samsung 6 years for anything close to upgrade from my S10, never happened, the normal "s" lineup just came with more and more Downgrades and all the juice went directly to the "ultra" lineup, kinda dissapointing since that lineup is getting more close to tablets than a confy and easy to carry smarphone, nowadays the only "pro" or "ultra" phone option I had was the iphone 14 pro, powerful, nice camera, nice color, simplistic desing and more important, small... so yeah, not always big is better😂
Things fat, and heavy af. Definitely a downgrade from note 10+
Honestly, the S23 Ultra feels like a big upgrade compared to the S22 Ultra, I used the S22U for well over a year before promptly shattering it while getting out of my car and getting an S23U. Every part of the phone feels like an upgrade except for maybe the screen
I upgraded to the s23 ultra because for the first time in my life I broke a phone and my note 10+ had to be retired.
I upgraded to the s23 ultra from the iphone 11 (not pro or anything). These companies don't do enough to convince me to even buy the best unless it's something like the s pen. It just isn't worth spending the money. Yet these companies think that spending money on marketing is gonna help them. That's just foolish. Apple and Samsung are the first that comw to people's minds when they're buying iphone or android. Advertising isn't even needed.
Just snap the pen after complimenting that it's his favourite😂. Savage. No offense but I can't do it without my hands shaking a little.
your hurting me bro im just dreaming of this phone
I had a Samsung galaxy s10+ however the screen took a poop, and I painfully have to use an 8 year old iphone, because im broke😂
I'll stick with my s21 ultra
This is ASMR for apple fans
Can I open my eyes now?
5:17 🙂
You forgot to smell the s pen or mention how bad it smells like plastic
Why your version of that phone does not have a 5Gwideband  antenna below the power button cuz mine does
I had my note 20 ultra from the longest time but i just upgraded because it got water damage and i wanted the 1tb model, but hopefully will keep the s23 ultra for 4 years
Speaking of jerry using 3 year old phone, I'm commenting from Samsung Galaxy A30 and using it since it's launch 5 years back.
Still on my note 8 lol 😅
Watching this on my s23 ultra feels like I'm threatening my phone 😂
Also too, for anyone looking to buy this phone, buy it from samsung directly, it was WAY cheaper with a trade in the the carrier.
Seems to be prone to micro scratches sadly... Get a screen protector for this one folks.
Samsung ad >
Hit it with a hammer I watched someone do it on tikyok and it didn't break wanna see if that's true
Its shame they even removed chargers from affordable category
Watching what you just did to the s23 ultra hurts my heart cuz I am an s23 ultra owner and they're not cheap but I respect it I really like this phone it's incredible I've had no issue works the same as when I first bought it if not better definitely the best phone on the market right now
My note 9 Is doing just fine, I just replaced the screen reciently so Im good for at least the next year or 2. The note series has so many features that its impossible to use all of it consistantly. People will spend massive money to take slightly better photos and scroll on Social media all day. Many dont use their phones to its fullest potential which in its self is very wasteful.
I got a S23 ultra recently, now i only gonna change smartphone in +2028
Just upgraded from my S20 Ultra after I accidentally drowned it during the summer.
Me watch this with a s23 ultra make me cringe
What was all that hate for?! If you don't want to buy a new phone yearly, don't. It won't change the fact that this phone is dope.
Mad respect for the call-outs, and I'm still using the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ 512gb as well. Here's hoping the S24 Ultra justifies an upgrade.  Keep up the amazing videos
literally just bought this yesterday because my s21 ultra got water damage
But Jerry, If I don't trade in my phone every year ish, how will I impress the ladies?
Hey Jerry, are you using a screen protector  for your note 10?
The grip case for my note 10 plus (phone and case are both about 3 years old now) is starting to fall apart/crumble around the edges... went to order a new one and they aren't for sale on the dbrand website anymore.   Was really sad about that. I love the case so much I'm genuinely considering a new phone so I can get a new case...
I wasn't gonna upgrade my Note 20 Ultra until the screen broke a few months before I paid it off and Verizon gave me more to trade it in than I would've gotten selling it, even if the screen was perfectly fine.
You've got me cringing in my chair watching you scratch up the phone like that hahah. I had watched many videos before taking the plunge and buying the S23 Ultra but wish I saw this one before doing so; it's got me thinking I should go back and swap it for the regular S23 or even an S22. Thanks for the intense testing and honest review; I love hearing reviews from folks who are skeptical of marketing ploys.
I just bought it yesterday, and it hurts to see you just scratching it up like that 😢
2:32
Switching to s23 ultra after using s8 plus for 6 years
I have stopped watching videos because not only he affords my dreams, he also destroys it
Include some drop test too
This is too painful to watch
My 3days old s23 ultra got its scratches on the 2nd day..  when my pet cat snaps its fingers on top.  Damn
Selfie did look different,  tho
Same exact phone and colour as mine
ive watches jerrys videos for years but i still close my eyes when he scratches the sides XD
nah i generally upgrade every year occasionally twice a year. its not that hard to take care of your phone and either trade it in or sell it to reduce the cost of the new one. people complain about the price of the fold 5? 799 seems like a great price to me. no where else would i get 1000 for an s22 ultra
I have an iPhone 12 and don’t plan on upgrading until something significant on this thing breaks lol
I love my S23 ultra. Mind you: my last phone was a Galaxy S20 FE 128GB so, pretty big upgrade for me. I also have the Tab S8 Ultra, so having them sync and work together is awesome.
why do this
Tbh idc its internals as you saw in yoyr other video is just so much better and easier to fix it almost doesnt matter. Its the best samsung ive ever used and to me use case is way more important. We have insane cases and screen protectors now so getting a phone purely because of this test just isnt a big deal anymore. Its funny because my s21 ultra imo was way worse with durability then my s23 ultra is.
"The s-pen is useful for a lot of things..." **snap** LOLL
This is the phone I'm looking to get.  It'll be a huge upgrade from my prepaid, Samsung A51. I never buy flagship phones and I'm ready to take the dive.
This hurts to watch as someone who doesn’t even have the money to buy a new one and take good car of it.
What phone do you use?
How come these companies are such tree huggers and love the environment but keep using red 40 and toxic chemicals in our foods?
Aua buale akaet he kata
Highly considering this phone now as an upgrade from a what 5 year old now note 9 with a 1tb card in it and 512gb in the phone. Ya it sucks the micro sd card is now gone but everything else considered I gotta have my magic wand for when I needs it 😉
Also Jerry your phone is 3 years old my phone is 8 year old 😅
I bought it! It’s worth an upgrade and tbh camera software improved the camera for s23 ultra rather than hardware
I have s23, and my biggest fear is bracking S PEN. I freaked out when he broke it like nothing.
I hope you will send it to me😍
Wait I got an iPhone ad 😂
I upgraded from note 10+, well i love it 😅
I finally upgraded to this s23 ultra in red pretty happy with it but had my trusty s20 plus until this one
The only samsung phones I've owned were the Note 8 and my current phone the s20 ultra.  I only bought the 2 based off of Zacks reviews. If he ever switches to another daily driver, you bet im going to follow too. This guy knows how to review
Can you make a durability test on Samsung S23
Jerry this man by the name of " zubair mobile repair" copyrighted your video on YouTube just letting you know
I'm glad I'm not the only one with a 10 still 😂
I was able to get 800 off a monthly payment plan with att by trading in a s9+ with cracked glass. So from my oneplus 9 it's worth it to me
The moon camera is fake.
Just as the video ends a samsung ad pops up seriously
Painful to watch 😅
That scrapping looks hurt😢
I have bought the S22 Ultra back in 2022 December, around 15. But at that time i didn't know that the S23 will be out on January 1. I upgraded to the S22 from a very "battle-scarred" Huawei P30 Lite which was and still with me after 4 years. That is an amazing phone! So far the S22 is doing awesome with extremely good photos compared to my old P30 with broken cams. But one thing i hate about the S22 is that it's battery is shit. If you go away from home for atleast 2 days i wouldn't go without a powerbank or the charger. First i was really mad but after some time it is not a big deal.
I hadn't even realized my phone had plastic film on the perimeter.
Der Typ muss in die Geschlossene
Be sure to turn down your earbuds/headphones
yes, i did get a samsung ad on this video xD. im sure it doesnt help that i just bought one, but hey, im upgrading after having my s10e for years. i can certainly say though. imma miss my aux jack...
3:17 😂😂😂😂
I can sugest some innovations for Samsung:  -make some mid/high end phones SMALLER, not everyone wants a TV in their pants. -add a headphone jack -add SD card slot -add a removable battery ( This one they will definitely do because of EU regulations)
I can't focus to your explanation with this irritating sound.
Tomara que o ceo da Samsung não veja esse vídeo kjkkkkkk jerry não vi nenhum anúncio da Samsung no vídeo kkkkkkkkkkk me manda uma case dessa de presente 🇧🇷
Why so much hate for Samsung🤣🤣🤣
Yes I think phones should come out every two years
Jerry should note that a phone is not always about how it looks. Despite looking identical to the s22 ultra, the s23 ultra has much more improved everything including cameras, speaker and processing power, so far so that people have started liking it more than iphones. So maybe they haven't innovated how the phone looks, but they've definitely innovated how it works.
why apple is better that samsung
3:19 Comedy moment right there xD
The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra seems to be the best Android smartphone so far, for which you can get value for money (also because of the strong structure) and the best option if you compare it to the iPhone 14 model of the same size and price range.🤔
Upgraded from the P30 Pro to the S23 Ultra so about 4 years. The only reason I upgraded is camera on the P30 pro stopped focusing and sometimes wouldn't even open.
Can someone tell me where can I buy the colorful blade he use and the scratch test tool he use for the screen. TQ
Jhonny sins doing durability test
Do you give a phone for me
You need to stop wasting your money on phones just to destroy like thats an expensive phone
iPhone---->Galaxy S2---->Galaxy S6---->Galaxy S9Plus---->Galaxy S23 Ultra  Each phone I get lastse longer and has less issues. I have owned iPhones and other Android phones for work but the Galaxy flagships are never bad phones. The notes had issues but Samsung went above and beyond to restore their rep after that IMO
why did that front selfie camera scratch with the razor blade?? 🤔
Really roasted samsung as much as he could
Can i have the phones when you are done testing them i dont care
2:10 well actually I do know which picture came from which because of the time on your watch 😎 The one on the right came from the s23 ultra and the one on the left from your note 10 plus
upgraded from note 8 (loved that phone to bits) to this one. Mainly because the phone was starting to stutter and die. She got so much use
You should add drop tests to your videos
What are you doing jesus
I upgrad every 2 years for the cpu processor I had the s21 previously and now having the s23 plus I am very pleased with how much better it is for gaming.
Shall i buy it or not?😂
Note 10 is a beast still
Selfie camera was scratches easily, wtf
this video is hurting me
Jerry was crying the entire video! Sad to see
So @jerryrigeverythhing doesn't use an iphone?
❤
Is the S23+ as durable as this?
First selfie is from note 10 and second is S23 Ultra. (You can see the time in the watch)
That pen breking was personal.😅
Says Samsung should just spend money on R&D and 0 in marketing like Tesla but then promotes Dbrand who are spending theyre money on sponsoring Youtubers like him. Scumbag
SAMSUNG SUCKS ASS
I'm thinking about getting one of these but it's because I've dropped my z fold 2 down the stairs a couple times and it's getting unreliable. I still kind of want to get a folding phone but they're too expensive just to have the inside screen and reduced quality everything else. If I could get a flagship quality foldable, that's all I would want to carry. But unfortunately they all have too many compromises on important features like the main camera for me to stay with that kind of phone
I remember upgrading from the note 1, 2 and 3. it was revolutionary. You can't deny that a 1300 usd isn't aimed at yearly upgraders. That's just common sense! I'm sad about this at one point, and (less) happy at another point
Do the normal s23 series teardown please 😍
late comment but i only very recently switched to the 23 ultra as ive had a s10+ for the past 5 years and the battery was dying in 2 hours from a full charge, if that didnt happen i would have probably still use the 10+ for another year
I hate todays huge ass phones. I don't wanna be carrying a brick around so the S23 lineup is pretty much the only option. Thinking about the base model. I did buy a pixel 7 pro but it's just too big, un usable to me. Only thing I have a serious problem with is the login style, you have to first double tap the screen to awaken it then give it the finger. My 6.5 year old Huawei P10 it's just 1 touch to the sensor, no double tapping needed. It's very annoying that i've gotten so used to it since every single moder phone has a worse system now. Kinda unbelievable to be honest, everyone just want more and more screen so this is what happens because of it. I don't. I'd rather have a smaller screen if there was just a fingerprint sensor at the bottom. In the Huawei P10 it's also used to navigate, it's just so handy. I really don't even want to buy these new phones since for me they have gone kinda backwards in the user interface. But there are no options that have this Huawei method. Sad.
Is this the one that when you go to take a picture of the moon, it swaps your picture from a super close up clear picture online.? To make it look like you’re taking a clear picture of the moon.
I hope my S23 Ultra last longer than that...3.5 years would be great 😎🇸🇪
Nooooo this breaks my heart this is my favorite phone😢😢😢...
I wish they would make all their phones & not just the ultra's the infinity screen. Im very picky when it comes to phones as its the phone ill be looking at for the next 2 to 3 years. I perfer the Galaxy plus but it doesn't have the infinity screen which i absolutely love the look of it. Im not sure if thats what its called the infinity screen.
Man, that razor scraping is like nails on a chalkboard lol. I have to turn the volume down when he does that :P
Samsung is doing the reverse of innovating by removing the sd card slot and 3.5mm on these newer phones. I have a Note 20 Ultra and im having to switch to a Sony Xperia 1 IV because running a dongle for my wired headphones is killing the usb c port
The dirty, uncomfortable truth of the cell phone game is this: There is no innovation, because the technology peaked. We need some radical change from outside the industry in order to give any sort of actual, major innovation.
Battery life is the reason to upgrade Jerry
I'm still pissy about the spen being moved to the left side.. it's like wtf the mass majority of people are right handed.
He just destroy everything  😂
Ultra: No expandable storage, no headphone jack, no charger, same design the past four years, abusive forced arbitration clause in the TOS/EULA. [Edit: 02:50 - No IR blaster. Remember those?]
Samsung has become Apple.
Literally the only reason I keep upgrading every couple year's is that $800 trade in Credit. Paying $400 for this phone is still a tough pill to swallow.
I understand the title. Seeing a thousand dollar phone get wrecked made me want to cry.
3:21 i......i felt that
"scratches at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7"
Recently upgraded from Note9 and S9+. With no surprises Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is better in every way. It's much more faster, better battery, and etc. Only one thing is bummer. It's much more heavier. Please be caution about weight of this device before purchase. In long term, you really need to "retrain" your hand muscles to handle this "phone" as you used to be.
Please galaxy s23
Yes I got an ad for samsung A series when starting this video
Can we just have the durability test, not the lecturing on the environment or Samsung's marketing business model.
my s23 ultra has a white stone dome tempered glass installed fell from the table now it has 3 blinking dots on the screen red blue and green :))))
I wish Sammy would make the glass flat and the frame out of stainless.
The screen flicker is crap and give people headaches unless on full brightness.
I got the Samsung's ad
I can't stand watching this! lol!
0:39 ooof that hurt seeing you scratch the phone before it even came out the box...  Edit: I had no idea what I was in for. This whole video scares me.
The only reason I upgraded from my galaxy note 9 was it was giving up and cracked screen. They sent me a s23+
Terrible phone. Sold after one week. Camera is soooo bad
scratches at a level zero you mean. can't even keep it in the pocket without screen protector.
Just dropped this shit and came away unscathed. Never leaving its case again.
My phone is hella expensive. I'm going to try and get some years out of it. Just need to replace the case and screen protector
no hammer,  thumb down
I don't there is anything to innovate this smartphones further more  Every innovation will be useless and pointless as per my opinion
Little baby destroying everything going through your hands
3:35 Any ideas how I can remove the S pen that broke in half and got stuck in my device?
I use a PC, I don't get advertisements on youtube videos, because I can't stand them. And they don't deserve to be on MY browsers ;) So no, I didn't get a Samsung ad on your video lol
Don't edit out the phone setup
For me S23 Ultra is a massive upgrade but that's only because my previous phone was Note 9 lol
I loved my UAG Monarch case for my Galaxy S8, so, I got one again for my S23 U... Kinda regret it. 😢  The top and bottom edges are REALLY high, and it sadly makes swiping up for the menu buttons, VERY difficult for me _(maybe it's my big thumbs?)._ Which at >$70, annoys me.  I'm kinda tempted to cut it down a bit...  I already modified the volume buttons, cutting a wider gap inbetween the + and -, so that I can easily feel which one I'm on.  Had I only watched this vid a week sooner, I could've gotten the one you suggested! Oh well. heh
QUE LASTIMA VER ESTO, REGÁLAMELO 😭😭😭😭😭😭
The battery life is nice still
i really should've closed my eyes...
I used to love the Samsung flagships, but there costs are now so high as to be unattainable. With 3 adults and 3 kids flagships (no matter how lovable) would be extreme.  Do you have any thoughts of doing a routine video set on affordable smart phones (eg . New TCL, umidigi, other Amazon specials, etc)? Phones within the reach of the little people lol.  Either way tho, I love your content on all your channels and have learned a lot. Keep up the great work.
tesla with cars... their paint is thin, their glass breaks by themselves, and not to mention if the battery gets dented in any way the car is totaled. yeah. great car lol.
Hello everyone I got my galaxy s23 ultra after few days from time to time the phone restarts by itself is there any one got the same issue
bro the only reason I stopped watching your durability test videos is the annoying scratching sound you make white trying to scratch the rim mute it or do something its horrible trust me there are people who'll relate to this. Thank you :)
Stop it jerry the phone is solid as a rock, I’m starting to think that apple pays you to not talk about them and rip Samsung
Recycled glass no thanks u don't buy used stuff
I don't think rockets need surgeons?!
got to admit, hard to watch this video, but thank you
Dude has dry hands use some lotion
Yup I have got samsung advertisement below the video
I'm thinking of upgrading my S5 mini. Think I will notice any difference?
It would be so nice if u give me a phone on my birthday 😐
My fold stopped Opening all the way and also wouldn't close all the way so I swapped to this and it's a night and day difference weird because Samsung made both
Years and years of marketing gobbledy gook. victus this victus that. the bottom line is it shattered on the FIRST drop. That is a total fail.
This really hurt as Owner of one of these 😢
Seems weird that they brag about the environmental stuff.  Anyone that actually cares about sustainability would buy a used phone or would keep using their current one.
yes i got an s23 ultra ad lol 😂
Tesla does NOT market through the quality of their cars. They market through Elon Musk's cult-of-personality. His fanboys sell his cars for free, because Elon has/had good PR. Aligning himself with DeSantis and ruining Twitter are decimating his popularity. Elon won't be a billionaire much longer if he can't get a grip on his Twitter addiction, and I imagine the other big auto manufacturers are eying Tesla's demise. They'll soon be valued the way auto manufacturers are valued instead of being valued as a tech company.
my s10 is still rocking hard
As an s23 ultra owner it is painful to watch jerry just tearing  through the device 😂
I totally agree that i shouldn't upgrade every years, is pointless!  I had mu Samsung Galaxy s8 for the last 6,5 years till my son made it in pieces 😂😂😂
IK that this is a durable test but, this guy is somehow feeling nothing and I cannot really stand watching the phone being destroyed, ugh, it's hard to be broke! 😅
it hurts to these phones wasted plz sendme the phone without wasting it
You spoiled very nice mobile. Iam waiting for that mobile. I don't know when i can buy? 😭
Knife on metal makes my heart warm ❤
Plzzzz don't waste the sell phone.... give them the poor people... They Praying for you.... because they are very needed 🙏
5:25 why is he doing that? Its for see how the pixels can burn along the years?
Ima go for s24 ultra
i love my note 9 but after 5 years of non stop "abuse" it's starting to give up on me this might be the one
Super useful video.
Great
Just upgraded to the S23 from my Note 10+. And I can't find it in me to make the complete switch to my S23.
I dropped this from about 3 feet with a case and screen protector and it shattered.   Terrible Quality
My s23 ultra didn't have the plastic on the top and bottom that you removed
Ohhh this hurts to much
Are you crazyy?!! It's high price phone!!
Not me watching this on my brand new 23 ultra 😂
dude your gold ring is amazing and beatiful lol
I upgraded from a note20 ultra and while the new phone feels nicer in my hand, I kinda feel it wasn't that much of an upgrade. Like the camera is a little nicer? It's a tad faster? But very little is actually noticable
Ungraded from s10 plus to s23 ultra
"I love the s pen!"  *Proceeds to snap it in half*
Dude holy shit i busted out laughing when he started shaving the phone with a razor blade
Gotta note that the s22 ultra had a 40mp front camera, they downgraded it a year later
Motorola edge 40 pro expary mant plece 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I was using a beat up s8 for the last 6-7 years and I gotta say, the s23 plus I just bought is a super nice upgrade. I didn't get the Ultra because it just seems like overkill and the size is getting to that point where I can barely hold onto it. I have issues with the plus already and I don't want to push my luck with an even bigger phone. The camera and s-pen are cool features, but I'd probably use the s-pen like twice before forgetting about it and the camera maybe three times before forgetting about it. Beyond the occasional nature picture, DnD monster statblock pic, or landscape, I basically never take pictures with my phone. The only issue I have with the s23 plus is that they didn't give it the same UHD screen the Ultra has. Not sure why they didn't but you won't even notice it either way honestly. It's more of a nerdy braggadocious thing than a practical add. I also think the s23 plus gets better battery life because it has the 1080 screen over the 1440.
I hate watching these with you because I hate seeing a phone get damaged but I'm thinking about getting one
I upgraded but if i didnt break my note 20 and had insurance on it I would have not upgraded probably
S23 ultra is the best phone ive ever used. Had an iphone that had issues and needed to upgrade, went android because the ultra was on sale. No regrets!
The selfie on the left looks better. More depth
Seeing him break the S Pen really hurts my soul
Watching on my s23 ultra 😬😫
Lmao. Talks crap then advertises crap.
Can you specify whether the Armor Aluminum is good scratch resistent or not?
Do P60 Pro please, never seen u test the Kunlun glass
So shameless... this guy talks about environment while he destroys on purpose a perfectly functional phone. He makes his money of youtube from destroying hundreds of phones that polluted a lot in order to be produced. Nice job Jerry. Teach us about hypocrisy!!! If I were u I would shut up about environments and stuff 😂😂😂
Bought it this year, 3 months after launch for 1/2 the price!
I just got a s23 ultra I had a s9 and this is a huge upgrade
What does he do with the cell phones he tortures after destroying them?
Smart phone and other electronic companies should only release a new model when they have new tech to add, kinda like Tesla. I would say that they should do 1 model a year. 2024, base model. 2025, + model. 2026, ultra model. 2007 back to base model etc…
JFC!! I clicked on this video  I'm considering the S23 as my next phone.  I have held onto to my Note 9 for years.  This video was informative and extremely painful to watch.
It seems a bit hypocritical to call out samsung when you are trashing a phone every week
Wasn't samsung making jokes of apple for not having 3.5mm Jack and SD card  What happened now they are toasted removed headphone jack and SD card slot  Now they removed charger from box copying apple  This is innovation Samsung can do and was making jokes of apple 3 years ago?????? Shame Samsung
The s pen is useful for a lot of things *snap* continues selling the phone
Lava Mobile
Psycho
I think it'd be a good idea to durability-test & tear down one of the other models of the line-up (s23 or s23+).
I like that you throw away your money damaging devices for views so sad!!!
The only reason I grabbed an S23 Ultra is because I recently dropped my Note 10+ and shattered it to hell. Note 10+ was a fantastic daily for 3/3.5 yrs. I also can't complain about the S23 Ultra... it's certainly a beast.
Upgrade every year or two is just a worst of cash. At least wait for a minimum of 3yrs(36 months)
You can also use the pen to change songs when you are listening to music without touching the phone just swipe
Hi Jerry, I didn't see you do a Mohs test on the camera lenses. I know Apple uses sapphire on theirs, what does Samsung use on the S23 Ultra?
One big thing I hate about the camera lens is how huge they are and exposed. The video showed me enough I might not need a protector for them tho.
While I do minor things that are not very positive, I dont think destroying a phone worth thousands is very decent of you while people starve around the world. That we love this and dont see anything wrong with it today is the sad nature of people horrid. And do you even care, I doubt you do especially since you have tons of subs. But would be a breath of fresh air to donate the mobiles amount to a proper charity.
My heart broke here 💔 3:18  😢
Please test Honor magic 5 pro..
Used my Note20 Ultra for 3 years and finally upgraded to the S23 Ultra this year 🤣😅
what about the S23??? it doesn't have an S Pen, so it might have a different bend structure
This device give great performance it's the best phone ever made omg, it's super phone
The smooth voice and the torture inflicted to the phone are so incompatible
This physically and emotionally hurt me
Yeah im the same with apple. I went from the iphone 6 to the iphone X. Then waited from the iphone x to the iphone 13pro max. Now i will not upgrade for the longest time.
The only channel I would willingly watch that gives me the 'nails on a chalkboard' reaction😂
I am upgrading from my note 9
I have a problem, every since i first got my phone my battery doesnt keep a full day charge and i accidentally scratched my screen and i dont wanna do an insurance claim i am paying a monthly installments btw i have the same ugly green color, I get a new phone every other year
as a super nerd myself,  I usually switch phones every 3ish months lol
the harsh square edges are so UGLY also, wasn't the moon picture thing actually a lie, and it uses ai?
I thought it was a teardown on the phone, not the whole company's ego lol.
samsung has probably lost me. i loved the note series but even without it they are becoming more and more like apple with its lack of innovation
Going from the Note 10+ to a S23 Ultra was definitely a massive upgrade. I haven't found much that I don't like. However, had I not dropped my Note 10+ and broke the screen a few months ago, I wouldn't have upgraded.
American doing what they do best - Waste and destroy the good things from other countries
I find it interesting that corning always claims that the next Gen glass is "tougher," more scratch resistant. Until they meet your scratch pens and they all scratch at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7. 😂😂😂
Crazy..
Guys! Is there any chance the phone to bend because of the size, when you have it on the pocket and going upstairs?
Close my ears not my eyes
To be fair, my S9+ is still great. After almost 5 years the battery was giving up the ghost. I wanted to repair it. Sourced the genuine Samsung battery, then lost it. Then got sold on the AT&T/Costco trade in promo that gave $800 off plus $250 cash for my way old S4.  Now I'm rockin' this Ultra monster. Love it, except the lack of a fuckin' headphone jack! Hope they bring the headphone jack back by 2028. lol
Still using my Samsung s9 I got brand new in 2018 doing fantastic just battery is starting to die and I scratched my screen but I love this phone
Recycling consumer used glass is a lot harder then you think. Worked in a glass factory. Majority of glass is dyed for tent like brown or green glass bottles. You can only recycle glass to about 20-25% or it will have defects in the glass. Laminated glass can't be recycled either.
1. The s10 came out more than 3 and a half years ago. 2. The camera quality is definitely more noticeable  between the 2, youre just nit picking and being ignorant
Its painful to watch him break stuff.
I’d be interested to know how scratch resistant the lenses are. Does Samsung use “sapphire” like Apple or are they just using glass? I mean I know that Apples sapphire lenses aren’t pure sapphire but I’ve never had a scratch on an iPhone camera lens so it must be doing a decent job.
I just got the s23 ultra and upgraded from a s10 which I got back in 2017. Loving it so far and will use it for the next 8 years by then something crazy will be out lol
I CRY
Remind me not to buy used stuff from this guy!
first time on your channel love it subscribed!!!
It's a good thing you did not use the lavender one Jerry....'cause Imma die if ever 🤣🤣🥲🥲
I can buy this phone in 5.5 months without eating or drinking, with minimum wage in my country, and the phone I am using now is 50 dollars, life is not fair at all :)
I'm right there with you Jerry - I am clinging to my Note 10+ for all it's worth.  I'm holding out until I see some truly shocking advances that justifies dropping over a grand (AGAIN)
@2:22 wait, were suppose to peel off the plastic on the sides and top/bottom of the frame?
Man this is comedy for than technology😂 I really love your sarcasm
This guy is torturing the phone.
My phone got hurt watching this.
Bro is the nightmare of every phone in production
I'm not committed to any brand in particular that being said this video is dumb and impractical
How dare you destroy such a beautiful phone😂
Please give me this phone 🥺🤳🤳
Hey jerry can you please make a video comparison to test how strong is corning gorilla glass victus compared to lower tier ones
WILL THE S23 SUCCUMB TO THE DREADED GREEN LINE SCREEN PROBLEM.
This video made me cry. I have to save 3 months of my salary to buy this phone and it took Jerry just 3 minutes to break it.😂😭😭😭😭😭😱😱😱😱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱
IT'S SO MUCH WORSE WITH GOOD HEADPHONES
Tmx for the video....but its really awesome last week I buy this phone  & its the best phone in the world!!! No more doubt!❤
Don't forget the fact its using snapdragon globally that's a massive thing!
Thank God I didn't buy my s23 ultra based on the eco friendliness
It hurts like hell when he scratches the sides ... 😖
Please Make Video On Samsung S23
Bro snapped S pen like tacos
Watching him scratch a 2000 dollar phone is so surreal
Geesh..! You didn't waste any time on that phone... 😢 Samsung might want to consider writing you a check like D brand..!
Your a s23 ultra hater
I dunno Jerry, your tree-hugging BS is getting pretty annoying at this point.  Try sticking to tech and leave the political activism off the channel please…
The razor scraping
In which world is scratching with a knife a durability test?  It's destroying resources for clicks on YouTube, nothing more and nothing less.
So, not gonna lie. I had that very same case on my note10 plus. Forgot it was on my lap when doing garbages at work and it fell from the height of an f250 (~4"). There was no damage.
Just curious ..  What Scratch level would you put like scratches from falls and from fingernails? Mu s22 never fell Even once but it had so many scratches in a month I simply assumed it was from my nails attimes
Takes fake pictures of the moon.
This video is painful 😢
Spoiler alert, not durable at all. Mine now has a large scratch across the screen amongst many many other small scratches. And by the way this never fell or had any major accident, it all happened just from normal daily use. I'm honestly beyond disappointed with the durability of the phone. Before the s23 ultra, I had a huawei p30 pro and throughout 4 years of daily use, falls and accidents, it literally has less scratches than my 2 month old s23 ultra
My heart broke when he snapped the pen.
Hell.... that scraping is worse than nails on a chalk board!
Please try the durability of the iqoo 11 5g.
I’ve had TWO Samsung phones break on me. I’ve had four iPhones - not one problem. My parents Samsung TV had three repairs done under warranty - purple blotching, in the end, it got swapped out for a LG. Samsungs are junk. Never again.
Seeing the S-Pen get snapped in half like that hurts my soul
The reviews suggest the samsung has actually focused on the things that matter like display, battery life, processing power, speakers and cameras instead of doing unnecessary changes to the design.
The s pen broke so easily, the one in the s22 ultra is the same, a coloured stick. The galaxy note 3/4 were so much better
Ahh yes, buying a $1500 phone and instantly destroying it.
Me watching this on my S23 Ultra😅😅
As one would expect, I got an IPhone ad instead of a Samsung ad somehow
Watching this on a Galaxy s8 with growing pink burn in and an iffy headphone jack! Gonna run it into the ground, no current phones meet my preference.
Oh my S23 ultra
I just came from an S20+. Even 3 generations and a bump to a better phone isn't a huge difference. The cameras are a better but not night and day better. The fresh battery and its associated battery life is nice... Missing the s pen and a great carrier deal are what convinced me to upgrade, otherwise I would still be rocking the s20+..
I got à problème with this s23 ultra i got 1 week ago and i got already scratches on the screen i dont know if is the s pen cause m'y phone had a cover flip protection but anyways i still got to say for 1400euro the screen cant handle any scratches fact
test the resistance of the Asus ZenFone 9 please, it will be very interesting because it has a totally different back in textured plastic that I am not crazy about testing any chemical product that is not alcohol or soap, also the resistance to water, it has some slight friezes between the screen and the body of the device that makes me not put much faith in the iP86 that Asus promised it, not to mention that it would be very interesting to see its hybrid physical stabilization gimbal working without the cover!
Now tell me how to fix my scratched screen
That's painfull to watch and my ears are still in shock.   Thanks though! 😂
So Satisfying!!!!!!
This guy sells box cutters 😂
Still using my S10e,.. just bought a new/old one as a matter of a fact.  SAMSUNG.. Please put back headphone jack and SD card, and I will purchase one immediately. Thank you.  Edit - Also, remember the S4?  I boot mine up once in a while and still miss the hover a finger to get more info ability.  They took that too.
Hi Jerry! I was wondering since you are using the S10 until now, do you regularly update your phone to the latest software version?
That was painful to watch.
What's the rear camera glass made out of? Thanks!
So no need for camera lens protector right ?
Ok Jerry, I had an iPhone XS Max and upgraded to this a s23 ultra. I wanted to wait as long as possible to upgrade I know me doing this one time won't help much but are earth is dying :(
Traded in my S21 ultra. And I love the S23 Ultra. Definitely feels like an upgrade. Saved me some money on the trade in. So there's that. Haha... awesome video. 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Does anyone know if the aluminum side part (I think it's the midframe?) Is replaceable ? I have full warranty
Good thing it comes with the charger in Brazil
The camera on this phone is crazy
Wow😱😱 200 megapixel my Samsung grand prime pro is 8megapixel and it can't even zoom a person who is 2meters away properly
তোর নানির খালি ঘর mc
I really need a phone 😢
There is a s23 ultra ad underneath ur video lol
A Full Minute under fire omg 😮🥵 and still working all well 👌  This phone is king of 2023
Give me broken phone i will use it😂😂
As a Korean, I try to support all things from Korea but Samsung is getting full of themselves...they better be careful we may turn on 'em.
I knew something was off when the phone was removed from the box with a knife
only upgrading to the s23 ultra because they are offering 600 for my 3 year old note 20 ultra. pretty good considerring they are going for $350 used
They want 2 g in Canada. F that
He just broke the pen
How easy are the camera lenses to scratch?
Was offered 1000 trade in on my S10 plus so I did upgrade after 4 years. It's pretty nice but definitely not game changing other than getting security and os updates going forward.
6:02 my s22u has had so many issues it’s crazy. The biggest being the charging port stopped accepting any chargers over 15w in October, and even with the replacement port under warranty it still never went back to normal. That and the horrible thermal issues/ battery performance. Kinda funny just seeing them move straight on to the 23 series without even mildly addressing these issues that thousands of people have had, but I have already seen s23 users having the same exact issues so whaaaaat tf is going on Samsung 🤦🏻‍♂️ my s10+ was a way more reliable phone
Imagine not already having a USB C cable
your videos hurt me
2:17 rocking a 10$ Casio
First time viewer here and holy Shiba hut jr......I was not expecting to hear the scraping so fast I cringed so fast and almost died 🤣! I like your content!
No dual SD cards, no thanks.
I've got the S23, could you test that?
So you bash the phone and not take any of the internal innovations into consideration? Sounds about right! And talk about advertising!! dropping the DBrand cases to make a couple of bucks yourself!!
I upgraded from the Samsung A52 to the A53. Cause i accidentially ran it in the washin....*cough* Durability tested it in the washing machine and it failed.
your phone copie not originally The card holder is nothing like the one on my phone
Is it for sell?💔
You've got to be "the lock picking lawyers'" brother.....??!??
Pretty painful to watch this on my s23 ultra
Obviously an iPhone user 😂
I still haven't forgotten about the Samsung Galaxy 7 Note (name?) 😹
Screen scratches easily though
Not really sure where samsung hasn't don't innovating. They litteraly have a line of folding screen phones now lol... I mean, apple hasn't done any real innovating in years lol
I just got a ultra 2 days ago after charging issues and randomly not ringing when called s8plus, so hope this holds up as long lol I know 6 years is insane now a days but atleast give me 5 lol
Idk whythis hurts i think its because i will never have this phone
RIP s pen..
You are the reason I bought the dbrand for my ultra, I do not regret it, awesome case, the teardown skin didn't last a week though, it already has a scratch on one side... and talking about the phone, I got the phone as an upgrade from an old xiaomi note 9 pro, and it was totally worth it, and knowing the phone is that resistance gives me peace of mind(plus the grip case) at least we don't pay that much money for something that will break easily
Yup samsung A series advert not so awesome.
I used my galaxy S9 for nearly four four and a half years. AT&T had a trade in deal so I got this for 1/3 price as it came out, lol. Can't wait to use it until it dies.
itna chutiya insan nahi dekha hai maina 🤣 kisi or ko donate hi kar deta
Funny to hear the guy talk about Samsung's environmental statement while he's scratching a perfectly functioning phone all around :)
"3 cents a day" is a weird way of saying $56 for a $3 case
I did get an Samsung ad
Is the housing around the camera metal or glass?
I have the s23 ultra so I can tell by few details and the color tone of the selfie right one is s23 ultra.
I am also note 10 plus user and I don't think so I need to upgrade it still work very good .
S23 Ultra is the King in the world of smartphone now.
I miss the note lineup
Just got mine delivered. It feels a major upgrade considering I had a S21 Ultra. Really happy with my purchase
Awesome 👌 👏
snap "krack" 😂😂😂😂
0:20 Samsung is just copying apple again by using a Pulltapes on the back of the box.
I don't get ads on YouCensor, but then, I use the Brave browser.
Plus, keeping your working Phone for a long time gives the chance to install a Custom ROM, it can have Android updates for a long time; extending it's lifespan more rather than going to a landfill.
Makes fun of samsung for using 10% recycled parts but his all channel is about destroying new working phone for no reasons at all. Your channel is useless, nobody cares about how resistant a phone is when case and screen protector exist.
S20 Fe to s22 ultra I am keeping the 22 for about 3+ years
Do you have a link where to buy the pens that scratch
But the screen is organic!
where you put all your old phones ?
oh God it hurts...
Tesla doesn't have that much innovation, they are just updating the self driving feature. Their vehicles are almost the same design and everything since 2011, with minor changes and upgrades.
I am desperately looking to get a phone and he is destroying one 😂😂😂
is anyone here have an extra phone? can u spare me one so i can watch more videos like this? im only watching from a rental pc in  in internet shop
The scratching always bugs me, still love it though
This is the first phone I've seen you hold lighter to for that long and have it not leave a permanent mark. 😯
Hey jerry, I like your videos, but find them hard to watch because of the scracthing sound when you drag the knige on the side of the phone. Is there a way you could mute that or make it quieter?
I have the green one as well in 512GB awesome phone..👌
удивило, как легко отломалась качелька кнопок громкости 😯 хотелось бы узнать, как долго работает s-pen без подзарядки... ps: где можно купить такой же чехол для моего note 10+ ? 😀
ur videos pain me but they are so addicting .-.
Even no one ever will read my comment, still i want to type,  Watching this on my Sony XZ3 with screen glasses is 30% broken. It actually really hurts me.
Man I'm still using the s8 and I love it
Dude flexing that he has S10+ as if he''s doing the world a favor, as he's destroys perfectly working phones for a living lmao
This is junk for 1200$
Other then the camera it pretty same same from my note 10
Just got the ultra s23
This hurts for me to watch
3:19 “the S Pen is my favorite part of the lineup” *instantly snaps it in half*
Jerry the new upgrades are all inside the phone. They focused on the drawbacks and fixed those. Now next year they can innovate again
You waste such an expensive expensive phone like this and we can't buy a phone like this even if we try all our lives
I currently have an Iphone 11, I've wanted to jump over to Android mainly so I can have a stylus again. I was thinking of grabbing the Note 20 or an S22 Ultra, renewed
😭😩
Talking about innovation and features and phones these days... All the big companies are really doing now is REMOVING features to cause a problem, and then selling you a new product as an "innovative" solution. IE: the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack. Just to sell you wireless earbuds because the dongle is annoying. Or the removal of micro SD. Because you should just buy a larger storage phone rather than a cheap Micro SD.
SAMSUNG 😊
i literally screamed!!!
আমরা টাকার জন্য এতো দামী ফোন কিনতে পারি না, অথছ এরা ফোনটারে ভাইঙ্গা চুরমার করে দিচ্ছে।
I upgraded to this from a note 9 cost me 200 bucks with AT&T promo with $1000 trade in credit. I gotta say it was well worth it.
Every weak you breaking new flagships phones and we struggling to by a mid range phone hurts a lot
Bwahahaha Grabe
Am i the only one who skips forward whenever Zack starts to slide his knife across the sides of the phones?
Best video
I've been watching your videos a while, you have to admit, best phone so far is the Galaxy S10+.
There is something about the colours of samsung phone displays that puts me off big time.
Can I ask🥰 after those video's where this phone gonna go? can I have one?
I think that Samsung pulling all their innovative technology into flex phones Z series...
Tesla spends 0$ on advertising, but it turns out to be the carmaker with the most aggresive marketing )))
just give it to me this phone i dont care the scratches
Oo
Can you durability test some more Nokia phones pls???? Like the G50?
Can you try to open a nut with s23 ultra? Just to see will the glass btacke
we get it you are an iphone user
ممكن ترحمة للعربية
لكن فيديوهاتك محبوبة

This video is a tutorial on how to get ear and eye cancer
I still have a S8+ from 2017, going strong, and only just recently cracked the screen in the corner. Thinking about upgrading though.
وش يقرب لك جيري صديق توم 😂
This guy is a phone psyco
jerry rig everything,  that's what i like.
Sorry but after buying such a expensive phone i dont need recycled parts in it
Rigid as a rock
Honor x9a next please
How is this a durability test?! Who puts a light to their screen hahaha. Has to be a parody
Can the s23 ultra be used without a screen protector?
i was able to take advantage of an early upgrade.   got the 500GB S23 ultra with 350 dollars off.  great phone.
🤑
Sumsung s23 next please
6:00 X'D ja ja ja ja Samsung hates this minute for the ages.
Upgrading to this from a LG V35 Thinq
Sooo, he's not upgrading to a new phone, but buys all the products for his content... Sooo, basically... he is still giving Samsung their money or am i getting something wrong?
watching this on a s23 ulta felt weird lol
Very much interesting and satisfying 🥲
Regarding the selfies: The pic with 6:36 time on watch is from S23 Ultra.
return it
Samsung's innovation budget is Apple's marketting budget. Classic Apple showing gimmicks in the name of new features.
It would be helpful if you could also check the scratch resistance of the camera glass covers with the Mohs picks. That would help to decide whether one should use camera lens protectors, if the camera glass also scratches at a 6/7.
Just hit over 3 years with my current iPhone 11 Pro Max, before that I lasted 4 years with a 6S Plus and would've kept it for longer had the rear camera not decided to give up the ghost. I think new smartphones are cool and all but they're not different enough every year for me to justify an upgrade that often. I'll probably upgrade this one when something significant decides to break like I did with the last.
Samsung always copying apple
Your watch is simply awesome. Thank you for the video.
dBrand is the only case I use.
Dnt break and giveaway to poor people like me and earn bless 🙏
Ayaa plz give me I'm poor 😭😭
in brazil, they all come with a wall charger. it used to came without the charger, but since the flip 4 and fold 4 launch, they started including the charger inside the box. (sorry for my bad English)
Everytime he scratches the phone my heart just pops out after hearing that crunchy noise 🥲🥲🥲
There's a Pink line on my  Note 20 Ultra screen, is it fixable?
Now do that with the lithium battery
The pen breaks as easy as breaking a toothpick lmao
The worst company is apple who makes money in the name of green planet, the worthless useless anti-environment company who removed chargers but did not put usb-c on phone to sell chargers. Now consumers buying from amazon or other sites uses more plastic and paper for the chargers than packing in the box.
I still have rhe note 2o ultra I might update to the 24 ultra or 25
For the average user, it's just a s22 with upgraded camera
Eish  just got mine. This was painfully to watch. Lol
mending buat gua bang dari pda dirusak ga ada hp
I don't know Jerry it's a little hypocritical to bash Samsung for it environmental claims when your whole channel is based on you literally destroying brand new tech for views.
I got my s23 ultra last week. I'm bragging at work and letting everyone know how my phone is expensive ,high speed 5G internet and great camera!Love  it!
He really was throwing shade at people with new phones, implying they are sucked in by marketing yet in the end it was all to sell dbrand skins, his sponsors 🙄
Why didnt you drop it....
still using my note 9, none of the newer more expensive phone has anything I don't already have. Also note 9 doesn't have the ugly hole screen.
As an European, I've upgraded from S22 Ultra Exynos to S23 Ultra Snapdragon. Yes, because of the chipset and... unfortunately yes it was worth it. I've got robbed by Samsung with the Exynos.
I see all these people get lens protection and I never knew that was a thing.  I literally went from a Note 8 to the 23 Ultra.  I have it in an OtterBox Defender Pro Case and a Zagg Screen Protector.  It never occurred to me to add something to the rear lenses but this isn't necessary right?  I just want to know the best way to clean them otherwise.
The reason he still using a three year old phone because he fucked up all the others instead of using one of them,lool
Left picture came from S23 Ultra - its sharper
Your videos were much better without your political opinions shoved into them. We care about the tech, not your views.
still using note 10+ as well, maybe if you upgrade i will too 🙂
I have a very bad durability experience with S22. Been using the phone for about a week when it fell from my coffee table (not really too high -0.5 meter max)  and slided a little bit on my wooden floor. There was some dust of course, but still far from any damaging surfaces like concrete. The whole back of the phone is full of scratches and what is worst- all 3 camera lenses are scratched. Not micro scratches, but full blown scratch marks. I had a tons of similar accidents with my previous Iphones, never ever had a single scratch on such a crucial part as the camera lens. Last time in saw this was on my Iphone 5.I have not found any info on what kind of material Samsung is using for lens covers, but its definitely inferior to Apple's saphire. So im kind of disappointed to hear there was zero year to year material change in between S22 and S23.
Was this the most durable smart phone as of yet? Not talking about Nokia lol
My samsung a70 has lasted 3years 6months and still going on, and it is on android 11 so i plan to make it last 6months to 8months more, to get a nice smartphone,
Whenever i have to see this awesome and expensive devices break down, i just remember one thing, someone has to do the dirty work' or else companies would fool us...
Definitely buying this phone in a few months
And in the end everyone copies Apple, the boxes and the structure of the phone
I see only a person wasting 1000$+ and keep complaining about anything
I don't think there is a single thing I care about less in a phone than how "environmentally friendly" it is. It's going to end up as trash. These manufacturers generally deem all the parts unusable and throw them out save for the boards anyway.
Still rocking my Galaxy Note 9
The CPU is quite stronger though
I'm on your mum's side. I'm still using my 4+ years old Nokia 8.1 however now planning to upgrade to Nothing Phone 1.
These phones are many things…environmentally friendly they are not…keep your phone until you definitely have to update..that’s a better environmental idea.
Mid class me watching scratches on s23 ultra nd getting my heart scratched at the same time
can I buy that phone for $50?
instead of just destroying a brand new S23 ultra you should offer it ... Samsung already done durability test before and we don't need to waste component anymore (our planet is dying)  .... i think for 1200$ some people will be very interested ...
Jerry: Can you please investigate the issue of S23 Ultra Scree Wrinkle/wrap/deformity @ bottom corner (right/left or both) visible when we see it under light, would love to hear your thoughts on it.
It should be noted that it was Apple who pushed to turn phones into yearly consumable purchase, and their user base ate it up because while not all, may get their self-worth from the device.  Sorry but the cases that expose the Apple logo......that is pure vanity.     The rest of the market being good little followers saw what Apple was doing and did the same.  The same can be said of the $1000 phone.  Apple started this crap and the rest of the industry followed.  Legitimately it can be said that Apple is the worst thing to ever happen to the IT industry.  90% of of the crap they "innovate"  the rest of the industry has been only months behind.  Or in the case of the graphical interface on computers a couple years.  Because Apple cuts out the features so they can be first to market and be able to scream FIRST.  Perfect example:  iPhone v1.  Didn't have any SDK.  Apple advised developers to make web apps.  Meanwhile love or hate Android 1.0  Google had a fully baked SDK ready for developers.
Now i know why jerry throws BS at samsung.. he didn't get the unboxing experience package as Lewis got.. haha
Imagine all phones having sealed batteries and we are still discussing some percentage recycled glass, dye and so on. We are missing the point
Oh no..sad i want it dont have money though...😪
Bhai tujhe nai chahiye to mujhe bheej de .! Kharab q kr rha hai 😂
Hey Jerry,  Even I am a note 10 plus user from 3 years  And still  it works like charm
I really don't think that back is glass
I got Samsung advertisement
I 100% do not think they are anywhere near environmental-friendly. Although we do upgrade every year. This year the Samsung Galaxy S23Ultra was the cheapest I have ever gotten a smartphone and I don't even know how long. It only cost me $199. And then $92 in tax. Even though we would have upgraded anyways. The fact that we paid next to nothing for it is awesome
Jerry  atleast please send me one phone..so that I can use it for my studies..as a student🥲🥲🥲.
The pen is weak and broke easily
Is cool wat u do but nobody doing wat u do wit there phone
Please don't ru mobile i know the value of mobile I'm still uses broken smart phone to study
When electronics become consumable, just go ahead and leave off all of the “environmentally friendly” BS.
the s22 ultra is still not half price and I am confused if I should buy s22 or s23
Annan thiii
Most painful video i had ever seen
I would say in my experience, that Samsung Galaxy phones are quite durable as long as you take decent care of it and get a good case. I had an S7 for years and just upgraded to the S23 this year.
The right sided selfie photo is from the s23 ultra
Take notes SAMSUNG⭐️
IT. HURTS.
cant wait for scratches at a level 10 with no deeper groves
I do still have worries about the display breaking. I have had Note 20 Ultra screens break on me multiple times from slight bends, and the S22 Ultra had the same problem for other users.
Please test the Huawei Kunlun glass against the Gorilla Glass Victus 2.
i've been seeing that the screen scratches easily, but isn't 6&7 standard?
It's odd to see people upgrade their phones every year lol, I used mine for over 6+ years and just got an upgrade this February. My Samsung j7 prime is still as functional as day 1
Ahhhhhh this was the most soothing tear down I’ve seen in years, Apple years that is….iPhone4Life
S20 Ultra, waiting for the S24 Ultra to upgrade.
I have upgraded from a Note8 to S22Ultra.
wtf!!
Fun fact: It took him 3 minutes and 8 seconds to take another selfie   👇If you noticed too!
... concerning my personal purchasing history : 1/ after selling my iPhone (the first one ever), I decided to change the colours and switched to Android (once and forever), buying the first 2/ Samsung Galaxy Note, which was very large and there was this pen which was pretty awesome; it took me a few years to decide and make my first Samsung upgrade to 3/ Samsung Galaxy Note 8 (which is still awesome, even Today); while using it, I decided to buy 4/ Samsung Galaxy S20+ (just for the 64 MPX camera), btw this model still beats even some newer Samsung models in particular specs); well and in 2023 I finally decided to buy the 5/ Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, which is finally (in my opinion) good enough as an upgrade from my previous gear ...
I DONT want a charger, I have 6. Samsung’s “45W” is a basically a scam anyway.
❤ from bangladesh
2:11 I think the left picture is from s23 ultra
Danke, for always providing us such nicely done videos! One short remark, according to the display. While having the same brightness and resolution, it's supposed to be more energy efficient. According to Samsung, a new type of organic material is used to reduce power consumption while improving brightness.  Samsung Display does this by increasing the rate of electron transfer in the organic layers.  According to official figures, the power consumption of the new panel is reduced by 13% to 16% to achieve the same brightness. Besides the new SOC, this probably contributes to the remarkably better battery life my wife experiences with her S23 Ultra.
3:19 "The S-Pen is useful for a lot of things".  *Casually breaks the usefulness in half* 😵‍💫😵
Are you serious complaining about Samsung reusing the same design?
Lol I really like this s pen "snap"
I currently have a S21 Ultra and i am happy enough with it. I bought it on the release day. But if Samsung is gonna insist on this stupid idea to mix the Note line with the S line im gonna have to find another brand. Because i dont want a fat phone with a pen in it.   Might go for the next ROG phone that comes out.
Hate you) stop destroying new things!
Haha nice
I bought the s23 ultra but that was my upgrade from the s10.
No matter how many times Jerry says "I see scratches at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7" I still react surprised... Haha
I'm a professional photographer, so yeah. This phone is the greatest thing I've owned in a long time
You never told us which one is which. I'm gonna go crazy
I hate this video so much you have just ruined my favourite phone
what you have done with that S pen Will haunt me for the rest of my days
How to button easily removed...🤔🤔🤔
No chargers,  no headphones... pay for the environment if you want something extra with a 1500€ mobile..., no matter how many taxes you pay.
💕
Burn baby burn... 🔥.
It's easy to watch someone destroy a phone you didn't buy
This idiot complains about Samsung recycling as he breaks every phone he gets his hands on 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
The carbon footprint of driving 1 mile in a car equals 800 drinking straws A thin layer of plastic makes no difference in anything
i just bought one of these and this video is giving me progressive anxiety
I much prefer buying Redmagic 8 pro than Samsung s23 ultra.
I upgraded to this phone from S20+, (Trade in) I think people who upgrade yearly just have too much money lol
I just got my s23 ultra. I am upgrading from an s7 edge. I told my kid I'm good until the s39 which will probably be some type of neural interface.
This video convinced me to purchase the red 512gb from samsung..... my main complaint is shipping is march 21st
Regarding to the selfie... Yes,  the difference is there, S13 looks way better
Besides the model that exploded 💀
samsung is so performative with their einvironment bs, if they actually cared for the environment they would prioritize repairability and longevity with their phones
Would it be bad at all if any company actually used recycled materials ? We care about the new chips and cameras and batteries...why can't we have recycled phones?
When is the OnePlus 11 durability test coming?
"The s-pen is useful for a lot of things" proceeds to snap it in half
“Like take pictures of the moon” 90% of it is AI super sampling lmao it can NOT take accurate or even remotely decent pictures of the moon.
This video is kinda harsh 😂 and you complain about the lack of innovation there really isn't much more to change we are in a stagnant state with smartphones everything is about as good as it can get I'm not sure what you want
I'm still on my galaxy not 10+ as well that I pre-ordered. I have just now been debating on upgrading.
5:07 my favorite part of your video
What if that recycling causes more pollution and energy use than using raw materials?
What's that screen deformity issue or defect people are talking about S23 ultra? Saw a tweet from Samsung that was intentionally designed so or something
People, watch out for the Gorilla glass Victus 2, in my life I have never seen a screen so sensitive to scratches, I don't mean the keys, but it leaves deep marks with very gentle touches. Who is interested, I have pictures and a video! Many users complain because Samsung guarantees a screen resistant to such things, but it is not. Feel free to contact me, I send pictures because for that money, the users deserve the truth. The device is S23 ultra, used for 8 days only in the household. Samsung should have told customers that screen protection is mandatory. The device touched the porcelain plate! People, this is a scam and you need to come out publicly about it, I have video and evidence.
Prices are getting as high as mountains
i just got the regular s23 and im in love with it. would have loved to get the ultra but i like the comfortable size of the standard s23
WAITING FOR ONEPLUS 11
My note 8 is with me for 5(nearly 6) years, and buttons are not usable, phone is laggy and can off/reboot when he wants, so as present for birthday I choosed galaxy s23 ultra(Its looks cool, so why not?) The worker looked at my note 8 and how cracked it is was like "How does it still works..."
They do got that 3.36ghz processor. That's a definite upgrade
I bought an s23 ultra. I hadn't bought a new phone since an LG G8 in 2019. G8 was a great phone. But it's been beginning to freeze. S23 ultra has a ton of improvements I'm enjoying. Not like out of this world. But it's nice.
My heart is also breaking like these phone 🥲🥲😂

What is a rocket surgeon?
Jerry makes a living exposing these companies
Sir please 🙏 give me A phone...🥺🥺 I'm poor man
Oh god triste is painfull
Jerry I am waiting for the OnePlus 11.
Looks like ultra passed the test?
Call me cheap but I'd still take the phone after he's done all the tests
It hurt me seeing you scratching it like that ive been wanting to upgrade my note 20 ultra this video was hard to watch 🤣
The selfie camera in the s23U 12mp is a DOWNGRADE from the s22U 40mp. BS
Jerry give me this damaged s23 ..I ll take care of it ..because u don't need this thing anymore
Why does he sound weird when he talks?
Still holding on to my Galaxy note 9. Despite not being able to get any new updates. It's still functioning! The only problem that I'm facing right now is the screen burn in. I hate for the fact that despite being an OLD PHONE. Samsung  still sells the LCD replacement for the note 9 at $283.69! I almost bought an entry level smartphone for that price!  I have no reason to get ANY NEW SAMSUNG DEVICES because after the Note 20 ultra series. Samsung released new galaxy series with no SD CARD SLOT!
I'm feeling the pain of this
Just got this phone as an "upgrade" for an 21 ultra that was having issues and its unironically the exact same phone but the corners are squared and there's an s pen.
Teardown???
Hello, Jerry! I just want to know where the water goes after it came inside the s pen hole. I believe there's another tiny hole at the side on the screen/s pen slot because when I put water in it it seems like it decreases but my S23 ultra is still fine and there's no moisture inside the screen or camera
Why you are not diddurability test of iqoo phones ??
do Huawei Mate 50pro
Spy phone why did you not show how bad this phone really is?¿¿???
I used to upgrade every 2 years (end of contract with isp) However this year i decided to upgrade from my s20 fe (which i enjoyed a lot) to the 23 ultra. Never wanted a big phone but decided to give it a try regardless. (Not gonna lie, the moon pics are what made me pull the trigger. I have hundreds of moon pics and its always just a ball of light. Now that i can do it properly (havent had the chance, no clear skies since i got it about a week now) i decided why not). It was a life steps gift. I did some steps in my life and said i would get a watch as a reward for the hard work but opted for the phone instead.   Wasn't feeling the size but getting used to it. Thoroughly enjoying the coloring app for the pen. Thats neat and relaxing.  And this time i purchased it outright. Meaning im not attached to any isp or loans or anything. So if a s24 comes out tomorrow and i decide i want smaller, ill get the 24+ for free. (In a way) or get another ultra for a couple hundreds.  Upgrading every year is useless. You wont see the upgrade per-say. Every 2 years, you notice it but still, not that much. Waiting 3+ years is best. Skipping 2 models or more is always better. You can see the differences.   With all that said, i highly doubt ill ever switch away from samsung.(unless they become literal doodoo). It has everything i want and just being able to put and change phone themes when i want to make it mine, is the main feature that keeps me with them.  Have tried pixels, have tried motorolas, lg, sony, even some chinesium brands but always came back to samsung.(would literally return the phone within a week to go back). Ill also never go apple. I like to be my own person and my iq is high enought that i can use a smart persons phone. I also dont believe i need an apple to be cool. I have background experiences that'll make me cooler then any simpleton with an iphone.
Having subtitles is really helpful, specially when the scratch sounds starts.
As a S23 Ultra owner... This whole video made me CRINGE!
Please can I have this phone?  I need one LOL
you are the best keep it up!
I bought an S22U last year with the 512gig option (highest we got here) and I just decided with this one that I'm not buying a new phone for a while.
That note 7 was by far my favorite note phone too. I really wish I could have kept it.
This dude calls out all companies. Respect
What exactly do you mean with "next year for half price"?
The 23ultra has a Battery pull tab, Finally!
I have a phone from 2018 and it is amazing
Nooooooo don't do it!   Always my reaction when you tear into a phone, but hey here I am engrossed.
How many months or years a phone is made but you break the phone in 7:45 minutes? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You might have just saved me $1,200 with your blunt honesty. I appreciate that. The dbrand grip case is excellent. I have mine with the leather backing on it and I love it
Super Made - Congratulations @lifewithelektronik
Any phone you put a knife on it will get scratches in and around the phone and then you intentionally do it will definitely get more scratches on the phone
Hey sir. What is your current phone?
S pen Biscuit 🍪🍪
On the bright side if you’re single you don’t have to share your  (LG )wing ;)
Please do a s23 teardown dbrand case. Please, Please Please  🥺🥺
its so relaxing to see someone break stuff we cant even afford xD
And they wasted millions of boxex for extra Charger which is sold separately.  Also cound the millions of Gallons of Fuel ⛽️  to transport those extra chargers.   Every year, chargeing speed increases with newer phones , their logic of every house have multiple chargers is void, as indeed, we have chargers but not the fastest the phone supports..  it won't be 45w charger for next  50 years.. expose these bullshits money 💰 making chepos..  Its just marketing teams work.. why should we care whether it's recycled or not? Are we getting advantage  none... every year phone is getter closer to cars..
When is its inside video is coming?
If you have an S22 Ultra don’t waste your money.
Loved the bits about Samsung's massive waste of money on marketing rather than investing on innovating. I am glad you're adding these kind of bits and bytes to these teardown videos. Plus so happy to see environment consciousness among the creators and audiences. Kudos!
8/8.
Hey Jerry now you will be very happy with the battery removal on your teardown, I think Samsung heard your complain.
I have one for my galaxy galaxy note 10 plus. Really good case. I was thinking on buying another one but i don't see cases for the galaxy note 10 plus on the page anymore. I hope they put it back again.
Meanwhile im here Still waiting for Samsung S22+ ultra to get Cheaper and hoping to have it for 25% price. im totally Cheap person but this video tells you that the camera changes is not that much, and also the performance improvement is not that really useful for now.
Next year for half plus lolest
Yeah my S22U is good for another 3 years. My S9+ lasted around 4 years. Apart from some scratches I stupidly managed to get on my screen I'm happy.
You should probably be doing some phone reviews, because your honest.
I am always so careful with my phones and I could have sworn my phone came scratched out of the box. Premium materials is fine and all but not if they are so soft of a metal on the sides.
Saya nak phone lg tu boleh?
Hello guys, i am from india and i bought this phone and in less than 24 hours the oleophobic coating on screen started to come of and the phone is full of scratches. I reported this in coustmer care, still no action is taken.
I do think the selfie on left side was much better
"the s-pen is useful for a lot of things" ... *snaps it in half*
I have the Note 10 plus too, still so good. If this shitty companies cared about environment then should release phones at least 2 years apart, with significant changes and not making people waste a lot on cases every year. But hey at least now you have to pay for the charger extra fee and no headphones either 🤑🤮
I don’t know wether to be intrigued at your destruction or to call you stupid lol
God damn, the nostalgia, haven't watched you in like 5 years
Where's the teardown?
Need 1+ 11 durability
dibs
True tesla spends 0 on advertising.  But technically elon buying twitter is tesla spending money on advertising
Interesting Iphone didn't come close to Samsung in burning by lighter... so Samsung have way better screen.
Teardown?😊
Point on the doll where Samsung hurt you 🤣
My S20FE is still going strong so it's a 'green' move on my part to continue using it. Samsung would agree.
So I came to Samsung at the S21 Ultra and immediately upgraded to S22 Ultra at release and quickly noticed the small jump was not worth it. I came from Apple and would always do at least 3 year upgrade but it looks like its going to be the same thing with Samsung. I'm still happy with the switch but like Jerry's mom said use it up wear it out make it do or do without. Perfect saying.
Excited cant wait for the next part
samsung mobile be like :  anybody here please save me form this mad man he cut off me and killing me..ohh my god i'am dying...hahaha😂😂
Fold 4 is far far better i have both after trying the s23 ultra no way ill keep the fold 4 the contrast ratio is was better colors are not washed out  blacks are blacker and the quality is way higher plus way better signal die too the two 5g antenna not one like the s23 ultra. Im disappointed its garbage and there new update android 13 is so dam power hungry samsung has way to many features that are garbage now using way to much memory.  5 to 6 gigs just to run the phone  android 12 used 3.2 not 6 people need to complain about that. Modes and all this nonsense
nice one i all ways watch your you tube info clips ha ha good stuf
My current phone is the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. It will be 5 years old in June.  I plan to upgrade to this S23 Ultra soon, and use it until 2028.
me still rocking my Galaxy Note 9
How can i get this Mobile?
Hi sir  Where is oneplus 11 ?
i had the advertisement for samsung on this video gosh darnit i hate this advertisement it pops up un every video
ഈ അച്ചായന്റെ വിഡിയോ കണ്ടാൽ പിന്നെ സകല ഫോണുകളും വെറുത്തു പോകും... കുറച്ചു മയം കാണിച്ചൂടെ ജെറി അച്ചായാ...
Samsung R&D team gonna cry after seeing this vdo😆
JerryRigEverything gives me Wingggggs
Bro what is your personal phone
Good thing i followed your advice and have bought high end refurbished phones that have lasted 3 plus years for 1/6 of the price
@JerryRigEverything, Which phone do you think is better in terms of build quality and performance, S22ultra or S23 ultra?
5:13 The discrepancy here has got to be due to YouTube audience probably being more people in developing nations such as myself paying cash for Android phones compared to Americans on Twitter getting subsidised iPhones.
Love your videos. Would be more interested in a screen protector recommendation than a case. You tell it like it is and even though they are difficult to watch, you don't wimp out like other testers. No one wants buyer's remorse so everyone who buys this phone is biased (including me).  I got mine for net $300 using Google Fi $600 off offer and netting $350 selling my Note 20 Ultra on Ebay but I admit I probably could have got another year on my Note 20.
돈투자가치도없는 산업스파이사기기업이다 돈안깝다
Hahaha yeah served with a Samsung S23 ad right on cue, at the end of the video 😅
Interested in seeing the teardown. You went hard on calling them out last year about recyclability of their phones. They are advertising it like crazy this year, hope they actually put some thought into it. Also the fingerprint sensor seems to feel much larger to me interested in seeing if that is real or just in my head. Cheers !
What's the point of purposely damaging a phone? U guys really think phones should be unbreakable there is no such technology for that. Ofc if u take a razerblade it's going to do damage stupid idiots
I love how Jerry goes "The S Pen is useful for a lot's of things -" *snap* and then goes on like nothing happened 😂
give me one dude ...😊
The green looks grey in certain  light  it looks slightly  more green than grey but most of the time looks like a green tinned  grey
I'm interested to know your thoughts on the battery removal when you do the teardown now that they switched adhesives.
Didn't get an ad on this one but did get one on your newest one
Actually cringed and the scrapping on the sides lol  hard to watch
Would you advise me to buy the note galaxy note 10 plus or note 20 ultra in 2023
To answer your question, no. I don't get adverts on YouTube, they annoyed me so I got rid of them...without paying for premium 😑
My exact note 10 plus Dbrand case, somehow cracked my note10plus back glass but not front, I reached out to Dbrand but they told me I need order number, it was a gift 3 years ago...
I mean who really carez about phone prices anymore with all these deal broning them down to $800 or less
Just upgraded from Note 10 Plus to 512gb Green S23 Ultra, but guess what? I still have the most powerful charger that was ever included in the big flagship carriers, and very good earbuds if I ever wanted to use 🤷‍♂️
I'm in pain
Maybe Zack could tell us why there is that sort of crease on the actual OLED panel under the glass, bottom right corner.  I got my second replacement and this has it too. Only visible with screen off and light should beam on the screen directly (flashlight or direct light). Looks like delamination or dent P.S i have no clue why my user name is made up🤣
I wish if he could gift me that instead of testing it 🥺
Still waiting for the Oneplus 11 teardown! Will there be a collab with Dbrand?
But I don't get how u use a 3 and a half year phone when u have the new one right there and break it it's so painful to watch
🌟 EXPENSIVE TRASH 🌟   i have just updated my s22 ultra phone yesterday, and i can't believe i need to wait for another update to may or may not they will deliver these features.  I have always been a samsung fan, but with years, price with iphone is almost the same, and iphone even makes a better UI experience, even the stylus with galaxy is trash, when coloring they give you a broken feature, that you can't even control it's existence like if holding a line it gets straight and neglect any hazard movement, try this feature while coloring, it makes it impossible to draw or color Battery wise isn't that great. Samsung memebers are trash. They don't do any of your suggestions.  Camera flash doesn't work under zoom of 1.0   Lots and lots of bugs, and they don't fix anything  But they gave us broken or outdated features.  I swear i do really consider moving to iphone or get myself a trash phone at least i wouldn't be mad if it's features are broken
Thank you Mr Nice Kingpin
Wheres the teardown? 👀
After tasting give me this phone 😋📱 very well said
Please make a video on realme 10 pro plus.
Hi Sir Jerry,. . Can you do A Durably test for huawei X9a 5g. ? Im looking forward for it . . Thank you😇😊
Please review the new honor x9 phones
PLS PUT A PS5/PS4 IN AN IMAC
@jerryrigeverything please do a teardown for IQOO 11 5G
Jerry breaking s pen like a stick cracks me up every time
What a trash phone u can't get a charger for paying over $1k Company be like:  Use your phone at once then buy the charge what a samsung stop being greedy like apple  You're phone only in presence cause you have Snapdragon chip or no one goona give you're phone like this hike!!!  Stop being greedy
"Scratches at a level six, with deeper grooves at a level seven" My favourite line
;-;
Please do test on new OnePlus...... Waiting for it
to be honest my upgrade to s22 was pretty night and day, literally with night time shots
1:44 So True. @samsung
wow
It's how this guy mercilessly burns, breaks, scratches and tears down flagships😭😭
kinda funny that someone who destroys electronic devices on daily basis is talking shit about companies  "recycling"
Going from note 10+ to this is pretty exciting though
You sold me on the heat , I'm buying me a s23 ultra ... thanks Jerry and one more thing people buy the cellphones for the wrong reason.
Why don't they use sapphire for the screen?
The moment when he snaps the pen.  Ouch!!!!
Waiting for one plus 11 durability
put OnePlus 11 bend test its 2,3 weeks since launch
you scam me
So, I have had a look at the cables anker sells here in Australia and US. To be honest, they are average. Type a to c cable charging is becoming somewhat of an anachronism. This is unfortunate, because Xiaomi still uses this charging format for many of their fast-charging phones. My poco f3 is 33w. However , what about the Redmi note 11 pro? It charges at 67w for basic model. I don't know..but I think it would not be type-c to c. This is a problem. For those using type a to c charging, one needs to look for 3.1 standard. But, again they are not all the same. I know America is broken and apple is getting bitten, but..look at products from Cygnet Australia. Thanks to Cygnet for not sponsoring this video or my comments but for their wonderful customer service. I complained about my 1mtr 2.0 cable. They sent out a 3.1 cable (type a to c). These are the numbers...some: Supports fast charging  10 Gbps fast file transfer speeds DuPont™ and Kevlar® aramid fibre Metallic Alloy & Double Braided Nylon 5 Years Warranty. Also, thanks for putting videos on the tube that are interesting, Jerry. Cheers mate. 🤔 (Don't worry, it's just my emotitar) LoL emoticon + avatar
Are you testing the OnePlus 11??
can you please make a video about how to swap the cameramodul and the magnet triggers of the poco f4 gt
Bought the S23 ultra yesterday, still waiting for it to arrive. Upgrading from my Pixel 4XL. Hopefully it'll be worth it.
so much for a tear down video.. really worried, i stabbed my right microphone hole by mistake, simcard tray didn't open so pressed a little more, and then something went pop, or a seal broke or something push in because now it goes in and out easily X_X  scared (right microphone hole)
where is OnePlus 11
where is OnePlus 11
Both apple and Samsung are not innovating but all this is just for Samsung, not Apple. 😂
Dbrand? Nah, need better than that. Since early Note days been using Otterbox Defender series of cases. Best there is.
And how much of DBrands case, skin is recycled ?
Love the way he randomly opens apps while checking/Flipping phone than closes it by pressing home button😅❤
After owning a S6 for four years i changed it for S20 and i'm still rocking it. I'll wait and see if the Flip 5 will be a bigger step than Flip 4 was to Flip 3 and i'm gonna buy it :)
man I've been using my galaxy S9+ for almost 5 years now
I'm also still loyal to Note 10+ 😄
i love how zack passive aggressively destroys samsung, more of it please.
I did get a samsung advertisement in the starting of this video
hey man I love watching your videos keep up the good work and if you could can you give me something that still works like your apple watch ultra you used for the durability test
The way he scrapes the side of the phone hurts my ears
Alguien aquí  habla Español
Rig it Jerry Sins
these vids are awesome but i cant watch these vids i hate the sounds. keep at it and showing the vulnerabilities of these devices
WHERE IS THE ENG SUBTITLE ?!
Nothing ever passes the "level 6" with deeper grooves at a "LEVEL 7"💀
selfie on the right is S23 Ultra because level of detail is a lot better.
I have an objection when it comes to the selfie camera comparison part, I can tell the picture on the right is the S23 because it's noticibly better even while not being full sized which would make the differences more pronouned.  And that's not even taking into account the great lighting of your setup, and how the newer phone handles different lighting conditions and many other possible variables of a scene. My problem isn't you feeling there isn't compelling improvements for you, but moreso the notion that no one notices compelling improvements which is very far from true.  Those things being said, I do enjoy many things about your content and enjoyed other elements of the video, thanks.
Can I get the phone after the testing 🥺
Broh 🥺 im using 5 yrs old phn.. don't have money to buy even rent those phone 📱 if you saw this plz give me one of those broken phone 🌹🖤
नमस्कार  🙏🙏🙏
You should do drop test for every phone (what customers actually need to watch ) , those side scratch test and lighter test are useless
You took a selfie, knowing the improvements are with the rear camera.   Can your phone do decent looking 10x zoom?  3x zoom?
Honor X9A next
So how is the elevator in yr house work now
Atlast.. The most awaited phone is here to crunch!!
hi. can you test and tear down a midrange phone , Honor X9a 5g?
You are not putting next video... Why so late... You have s23 do it
2019 aug launch Note 10 plus = 12gb ram 512gb storage + SD card to 1GB  2022 and 2023 launch S22u and S23u = 12gb ram 512gb storage. Better camera and cpu  Comparing not much different. Note 10+ can extend storage
Huge slot for a useless fucking pencil and no headphone jack, no thanks.
One plus 11 please
I wanna buy but just waiting for your break test yo come
Please do for OnePlus 11 soon please please
2:32 bruh
OnePlus 11 please!!!!!
Taking tooo long for teardown video😑
OnePlus 11 pro test ❤️
OnePlus 11 durability test ❤️
Please do a durability test on oneplus 11.
The s21 ultra was my first proper flagship experience from the practically free phone offered from some carriers, without trade-in. I really like it but see no need to upgrade especially sense I never use my phone to the fullest. And they downgraded the ram for some reason starting with the s22, property because people weren't using gaming labtopquantities of ram of their phone. I'll upgrade when I consider it to be worth it, witch won't be any time soon.
Can you do Honor X9a 5g? 😂
all I got was what's app add
Honor x9a next 😏😏
Just how easy it takes to break the s pen... Not rugged at all
I'm going from a note9 with a cracked screen, fuzzy cameras, missing stylus pen, damaged speakers and a battery that lasts about 6 hours due to having to have the settings maxed out so the screen doesn't go blank from pixel damage, to an S23 Ultra... I'll be fine with Samsung's lack of upgrades lol
Please
2:18  left new right old
I bought the S22 Ultra on black Friday.  Best buy was offering $600 trade in for the Note 10+.  The phone was $999 for the 256 gig memory.  So I basically for it for $400.  Bitching about paying full price for a phone seems dumb.   When you almost never have to play full price. BTW The fold is Samsung's innovative phone.
I indeed had a S23 ultra ad on this video
We get it Zach, you're the most green and eco friendly person. Chill.
Build test it's amazing by Samsung galaxy s 23 ultra.  I unhappy s pen 🖊  tear
To the masses? Do u think masses can afford this expensive device? If u actually thought so, go out of the studio and see by yourself how people live this days
I have been using note 10+ for sometime now, i see no point of updating as of now.
I would *love* to see you review the Samsung Xcover6 pro, a samsung phone with both an easily replaceable battery and a headphone jack!
I feel bad when u destroy expensive phones when i have a lagging phone😢😢 but i understand we must to the durability test☺️☺️ but when ur done with one and not damaged alot send it to me☺️☺️  i will use it
Use moisturizer!!!
Must be nice being able to afford a $2000 phone just to commit blasphemy huh. Just give it to me 😭
evdhi gand nai marav
🥹Give it to me🥹
I got the S23 Ultra, and it's a marked improvement over my Note20 Ultra, in speed, battery life, and, yes, in cameras. And BTW, Samsung's advertising budget is for more than its phones, such as for its TVs, appliances, etc.
teardown part, please
Please give me one phone in your collection
I've had my S9 now for almost 4 years in like 3 months. I kinda want an upgrade amd slowly repair my s9 as it still good just has a bunch of damage
Why?
Thank you! People upgrade when NEEDED. Even if ibe upgraded from oneplus 5 to s23u, ive could easy wait. And im using it, roooted, tasker, emulator, editing, thether, etc
I traded in 3 OnePlus 8T+ phones (which were all free to begin with) for 3 Galaxy 23+ 512gb phones. Had the OnePlus phones for 26 months. While the Ultra is cool, upgrading to military max plan gave me 800 off each 26 month old phone. So the S23+ is 200 each, plus tax, plus activation. Ultra phones would have been 400 each, plus tax, plus activation. I'm already going to be paying far too much for cell service already. Paying  1500 dollars for 3 phones after trade in was not worth it for me. Ultra does not offer enough to justify parting with that much hard earned cash. I'm perfectly happy with my S23+ phones. If I really need pro photos, I have a Canon for that. Ultra is more or less a needless luxury at best, and a gimmick at worst.
You have nice eyes
👍👍👍
I got this one with 1TB, I don't use to change my cellphone unless it stopped working completely with no chance to survive. My previous was s21 ultra and I feel so bad that it got broken deeply till the motherboard as it was accident.
At this moment, i'm using 3 Samsung products, the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, with the 512Gb configuration and the Galaxy Watch 5 pro with LTE and the Galaxy Buds 2 pro, my first ideea was to keep them all for 3 years, and then upgrade all of them (to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy Watch 8 pro, and probably Galaxy Buds 5 pro) but now, that the Galaxy S23 Ultra arrived, I would have been ready to change my mind and upgrade every year, every release, but besides the environmental part, I feel that one year is not even enough to use and fully enjoy a product and its potential   I look forward to your ideas and opinions down here 👇
S pen can be used for a lot of things - immediately breaks it...
Quick question, before you take it apart can we get a picture of the moon from this phone, I am curious to see it from that kind o phone, lol
Remember guys. This dude said you should vote for a competent president not a racist one. We have 8% inflation, double to triple food prices, highest amount of illegals and a literal domestic environmental disaster and the president he told is to vote for doesn't even know what day it is. Good job OP
If you're using old Samsung flagship phones just be careful, Each season when they releasing their new flagship, they are sending shittiest update for old flagships, that ruins camera, stability and performance, so don't update unless you want to lose hope for the phone you have now, Its a tricky update. and so annyoing.
just peace and love. looking how Zack with his calm voice crushes different devices are priceless. Paradoxically relaxing 😀
Really!! You say that you don’t need to upgrade the outdated s10 because it able to provide decent selfi in super perfect studio lighting!!!
Gadget Psycho Everything
Don't indulge in this kind of cruel indulgence with the impossible dreams of poor people
I go about 5 years on upgrading
You should check out the Pelican Voyager case
The note 9 & note 20 were way better than the note 10
honor x9a
PLEASE ALSO FOR HUAWEI MATE50 pro
2023.. yes i'm still using my note 10+
Oneplus 11&11R😍
waiting to poco 5x pro
@JerryRigEverything can you do a durability test on Honor x9a5g
You're A Smartphones Pyscho Killer...
Dih langsung d hancurin
one plus 11 waiting 😂
That hurts. Don't harm the s pen like that.
Man again great video always a1. But was wondering could you put those mohs sticks to the test on liquid coating screen protectors. 🤔 really want to see is you can turn glass to ceramic coating as they claim
I hope he does red magic, eight pro gaming phone. It looks pretty awesome and I’d love to see a durability test on it.
Jerry: let me know if you got a samsung ad! Me who has yt premium who almost forgot that ads existed:
JerryRigEverything ❌ JerrybreakEverything ✅ kidding 😁😅
This test makes no sense. If you put your s23 ultra without a xase into your pocket with keys, coins, knife, pen etc. You DESERVE a ruined screen. I don't run my car over a road of nails and glass and then wonder why I got a blown tire. A more reasonable test would be sliding across a table, the case closing on it etc. Things people actually do.
Wow.
I went from an s6 edge plus to a s20 plus and today my s23 ultra. I halfway want to keep my s20 as it works great. I know better than to upgrade every model. I gained a better battery, more physical space, and an upgraded camera. It feels like I did something 🤣 Watching you purposely destroy this phone made me weep as I've only had my phone for a few hours now.
The innovation is in the Flip/Fold line-ups
Really WoW
Instead I got an A13 cause it has every feature that these flagships dont.
Zack: The S-Pen is useful for a lot of things. Also Zack: **Cracks S-Pen in half**
Do Oneplus 11 durability test
it hurt when he broke the S-pen...
am also a user of note 10 plus since 3 years 🤟🤟
Use it up wear it out make it do or do without …but we need innovation in every year
oneplus 11
Jerry, I have a question. I know note 9s had amoled burn in issues severely bad and thats the reason I went to an s22 ultra. Is there anyway to prevent this
My dear brother, in any case, won't you break the phone, can you also give me a phone, I have an old phone
5:17  🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥😂
Dude, you're casually hilarious. I'm definitely going to be your new follower. Great job, sir.
Banned JRE
Damn that's a nice device... I'm tired of my pixel 6 annoyances. Might need to find a new one
Please put one for One Plus 11
will you send me the phone😂😂
Please someone buy me this phone 😭😭
Comprar um smartphone caro só para destruir, vídeo mais idiota da porra!!!
Please sir, make teardown video of s23 ultra
Bro, now I remember why I stopped watching you..get your politics out of the videos. It's a tech channel. Don't money shame company they have as much responsibility as the consumers do to "the planet".
Yes 2 times
Can u test huawei honor x9a . TNX
I got a apple advertisement
Waiting for OnePlus 11😈
Here I am with a galaxy S8 active. The poor thing has had to deal with me for 4 years. I didn't get it at the time it came out. Got it when my other phone died from freezing. Made the same oops with this phone and it survived. Dropped this phone one the face on rocks and it took some damage yet never looked like an iphone drop. I don't like companies that go full greed even if I understand the nature of business. Sure a new phone now might not come with a charger. However the same one I have now probably works just fine. Why be wasteful. Personally the biggest test is a drop test. I didn't see that abuse. This is what I heard. Gorilla glass and aluminum that's pretty much the galaxy s8 active construction. With a new case cover it might survive me for 6 years. I think i might want to upgrade. Seeing as this phone stopped getting updates. I really hate being wasteful when something might last for the next 10 years. I instead of wanting a protection plan. I want a plan that keeps my phone updated well passed their "sorry we don't want to support our well designed product that's better than the other guys.". You want a customer for life. Give me a phone that stays updated and so durability that I'm welling to pay an extra $5 a month for on my bill. Then i guess that's what's the freeish upgrade is right? However not very eco friendly RIGHT. I want the American I remember that made something for a life time and made sure it could last that long so I can stress less.
did knife scratched the camera lens?
I know most like this channel, but I just get bored with his voice.
For a man who has purchased more phones and destroyed them than anyone else, it's funny how you try to bad mouth companies for "green washing."  At least they are doing something. This whole "green initiative" actually causes more waste because they don't include needed items in the box anymore (i.e. the power brick) and it forces  consumers to buy more.
Jerry , please could i get a new smartphone ?
The moment they removed the chargers and microsd card, was when I was absolutely convinced that smartphone companies only care about maximising profit!
Burn test left no spot on screen!!
Upgrade it now Jerry, s23 is perfection 🥰
Patiently waiting for OnePlus 11
Yet its safe not to call you the I word cuz look youtube's autodetect sucks !!! yaaay!
you idiot! why do you slant the scratching pen while scratching the glass at 2, 3, 4 and 5 and not at 6? clever trick? These guys should be banned for life or in true US style should be sued.
Breaking that pen in half was painful to watch. Somehow.
the way he broke the s-pen
Are Bhai Tod kyu diya
0:09 thanos😂
needed to insult because protective cases seem useless on this phone?
Hope you can test HONOR X9A too. You haven't tried out kunlun glass
That S pen is so delicate.
I need these phone  Please
The spen is great for a lot of things *snaps it in half* This channel is basically filled with Zack and his intrusive thoughts
Samsung is starting to lose it ways. How many need such a crazy spec for even a smart phone? I never see my 6gb ram note 9 use more than 5gb ram. What are you gonna do with 12gb ram? Use it like a mobile worksation? If only mobile is not mostly subscription based. And the screen size is probably not enough for such usage. I can do more with a laptop. A probook is probably more convenient in this sense. To me note 9 is the last sensible phone that samsung made
Don't destroy it, give it to me 🥹
Hi bro, how about the oneplus 11??
I upgrade when I absolutely have to. My last phone was a S7 my current phone is a A72. Do I need a flagship phone? No and neither do most people.
4:22 Camera
I you look reeally close you can tell its the new one.   Smh I've stopped shilling for Samsung since they've been following the bad business practices as Apple.
Keep doing the video bro I'm enjoying a  Lot
Hey jerry can you do ONEPLUS 11 please
Is anyone talking about the battery being removable on the s23 nowadays?
yes
I pre-ordered the S23 Ultra and it will arrive tomorrow. The only reason I'm upgrading from my Note20 Ultra is for the camera improvements and the trade-in incentives.
That segue to Dbrand is hilarious. Props.
waiting for the teardown
this phn will be good next year when price drops
Not the same screen now :D
Let's be real tho: people want revolutionaru products every year, but what's really left to upgrade? Honestly, ignoring the camera and gaming performance I wouldn't really feel much difference between this phone and my Galaxy S8 that just broke. Hell, I'm now using my mum's old phone (Galaxy A5) waiting for 2023 releases to come down in price heavily and it does fine except for those things...
🥲🥲🥲me not be able to get the S23 ultra and there is jerry who rigs one of them🥲💔
Am I the only person who gets tired of hearing how we're not tree hugging hard enough in these videos? What do you expect dude, these brands are tech giants for a reason...
Hi jerry!
can you pls try the Honor x9a? it has good feedback in terms of screen durability
I cant belive you still with Note 10, you are my hero

When is the tear down coming
when oneplus 11?
He didn't want to see the world-famous Samsung brand, that's why he destroyed his own Samsung cell phone, he preferred the apple brand rather than those made in South Korea. hahahaha😂😂😂😂
Still rocking my Note 10 plus aswell Don't see a reason to jump into the new one, let's wait until samsung starts innovating again 😏😏
Stranger: "so what do you do for a living" Jerry: "I break phones"
First time watching your videos, somehow it was recommended. I did not enjoy watching but I'm very tempted to subscribe.
Why is everyone talking about how it can take pictures of the moon? My s21 ultra can do it just fine. It's not a new thing
I hope he profits more than $1200 per video.  This is hilarious!!!  OMG this hurts to watch.  Impressive,... waiting for the SNAP.  Sponsored by DBrand.
200? That's messed up I'm happy with my 108 💀 200 is over kill lol
Please do OPPO find n2 flip
typical leftie liberal: complains about a gram of plastic waste, then totally messes up a whole new phone
2:10 Pretty sure the S23 Ultra is the one on the right
Where’s the iPhone 14 Pro Durability Test/Teardown?
This video is very disturbing and made me cringe for the entire 7mins 😅😅😅
Is gorilla glass just rebranding? I know glass is glass but all their iterations just scratch the same. They improve it on a microscopic level which is reason enough to be an iteration or what? I guess I'm just looking for more obvious/tangible difference between this gorilla glass vs the ones in the past
3:43 there is a burn spot on the screen  how it's come 🤔
👍🏻❤️✨️
One plus11 bend test
Left picture s23, right note 10+. Its true?
Phụ đề tiếng việt với ông ơi 🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳
Tesla needs a dam refresh. Lets not jump on Samsung and kiss Tesla ass.
"Can you send me that.."
Will the s23 have the dbrand teardown skins available?
OMG :( In the country I live in, we can get this phone in 5 months by working.
I'd buy a new Samsung if it had a damn SD card.
Itne mehenge fone ki maa chod di bhai ne.... 😂😂😂
What about honor x9a 5g?
This hurts to see lol...
Hey Jerry, I love your consistent durability testing methodology for each new phone that releases. If possible, I'd love to see you test out the nuanced differences between all the different variants of gorilla glass. I'm seeing reports of these more recent victus glasses getting micro scratches a lot more easily. Would love to see you test them all to see if there is merit to these reports!
۷۰ ملیون پول ناقابل🚶🏻‍♂️
just received one yesterday and the frame was scratched in the sealed box and there was no plastic on the sides...I was only offered a Warranty repair or a return not an exchange?!
Shame Samsung do not make a cheaper stylus phone like Note 10 Lite, I still have my Note8 that works fine but could be a bit faster and would say not to new android. I replaced battery and swapped motherboard (original died after 4 years or something) and still going. Maybe would consider S22 Ultra discount or even Note 20 Ultra, but they use crappy Exynos in Europe till now, so - sorry but no. S23 Ultra has a Snapdragon back, but damn them with this price point... I think Pixel 6a, or 7 or in a moment 7a will be way better option.
I think its 1st Samsung phone, you didnt destroyed screen with lighter 👍
Can you give me iPhone 14, PlayStation 5 and PC?
I have the s22 ultra and I plan to upgrade 😎. I'm just one of those people, I need the latest and greatest lol.
You are a monster 😭
Send me one and I'll put it through the "canadian living in a 3rd world country" test! Jungle, rock, rain and mud! My current s9 plus has almost past the test, other then the black screen every 5 mins from over heating!
I'd upgrade my phone every 3 years. Save your money for something else if you always buy flagship phones. These kinds of phones work well for at least 3 years.
Time to test the Mate 50 Pro Kunlun Glass with its 5* SGS drop resistance rating.
Now your videos are getting monotonous and no upgrade
Than snap breaking the pen!
Бляя, краще б мені віддав 😐
Every second of this video hurts me 😢
The knife the sides made me cringe ngl...
i did actually get a s23 ad
I got Iqoo neo 7 advertisement on this video
I'd like to buy a case but it doesn't say if you can use a wireless charger with it on... I bought a phone case a while ago  and had to take the case off every time to charge my phone because there was metal on it...
3:15 "and of course we have the s-pen, prolly my favourite part of the ultra lineup. The s-pen is useful for a lot of things-*proceeds to casually snap it in half*
Next year it's gonna cost half, the best you can do is buy the S22 series now
I wish this so much but i cant afford it and i watch destruction of them :(
I would love to see you include 1 stress test result at the end of these videos: wild life extreme stress test. Even if it's just a 5s snapshot of the results at the end. I know it's not durability, but no-one seems to post GPU thermal results regularly, and I think it would have a lot of value for some people.
Samsung S59 came. JRE: Im thinking to upgrade since it is the best number and year(2059) to upgrade my Note10+ but then i dont see the other reason why i should upgrade since my Note10+ is still rocking fine and a tiny upgrade since the time i have my Note10+(2019). Maybe i will wait anothor decade to think again for upgrading since 2069 seems have the best number to upgrade everything up. S69 plus ultra pro max 10G
I still haven't met anyone who would scratch their phone or set it on fire
Are you related up the LockPickingLawyer?
I have no manni for buy theis . 😔😰
I still want an AUX port and SD card slot.
We don't talk enough about how painful this could be for Jerry
this hurts!
No screen  protector  out of the box Zac????
Wow Zack, YT isnt showing me your vids anymore. I had to actually search for this one.
I have never upgraded to a yearly phone, instead I'll use my phone 2-3 years and buy last year's model of the phone im interested in. I bought the s22 ultra last month because they were giving insane discounts due to the s23 being on the horizon. Glad I did since there is legit no difference lol
i've upgraded s22 to s23 and even though it's basically the same phone, the SOC makes a world of difference. Coming from Exynos to SD makes a huge difference.
I love how he genuinely pays for these brand new phones and still refuses to use them based purely off of the fact that they aren't good enough to replace the older one he's already got
Is there a film on the back that needs to be taken off? I seriously cant tell lol
omg its a cringe test, nicely done hahahaha
Was machst du eigentlich mit all den Handys nach dem Test?
You bought a brand new s23 ultra just to scratch it up? None of what you showed except dropping was realistic.
Bonsoir Bon test mes vous aller   Plus fort avec votre crayon  à partir Du numero  6 c.est normal  que c.est abimer
Still got my iphone 7 i got in 2016😂 Haven’t even changed the battery, it’s crazy to me that ppl go through phones yearly
That packaging looks so depressing :/
I've upgraded from my note 8 to S23 Ultra, and yeah at that point you get to see all the camera upgrades and screen improvements. Even though I've upgraded I think that I could of used the note 8 at least 3 more years if I didn't want all of the other cameras. I was comparing the S23 Ultra with a cannon M50 for what you get at the kinda same price and the phone made more sense
Note 10 plus is best and enough....am also not finding any big changes to upgrade .... Am also using note 10 plus
Daam you are pissed up with Samsung, need this kind of spanking great job # everything riged...
Sir is wearing a legendary vintage watch the casio f91w🔥🔥🔥🔥
3:17 “And of course our good friend the s-pen” *breaks his good friend s-pen*
can you try honor x9a please 🙏🙏
I recently bought the Z flip 4 for $500. Samsung is offering a $400 trade in value, bringing the phone to about 760 + taxes. I'll probably pass. The phone is great, but I can't find myself spending that much for an upgrade.
Phones were Great when they included Charger and earphone in the box
But... Does it address the overheating!
how cruel bro
When does the OnePlus 11 video coming
Your videos make me cringe every time!! 😂
U should try HONOR X9A next time 😎
Still rockin a Note9! Unless he dies on me, won't upgrade soon also. 👍
Apple 🍎 is bettah
There was no sim card and yet the phone showed active 5G 😂😂😂
As a Corporate Verizon employee, the reason no one really upgrades yearly is because the device payment plans are now 30 to 36 months, so around the 3 year mark. That 3 year mark should give multiple phone companies plenty of time to actually innovate something, rather than give us the same thing every year. Still running my LG Wing, which is depressing because LG stopped making phones, but I don't know what my next phone will be. And not, no Samsung ads for me.
Went from a S3 > iphone 4s > Galaxy S6 Plus, Galaxy S8 Plus, Galaxy S10 plus, Galaxy S21 Ultra to now a S23 Ultra. I probably should switch to a 3 year upgrade pattern or 4 year
200 mp s23
s23 is camera good
Thank you so much! More people need to speak up and people need to be aware of companies faking being green when they clearly are not! Just pretentious corporates!
great phone
Huawei xa9 please
Google Fi is selling the device for $599. That's about half the cost of what the Note 10+ sold for. No trade is needed, just use their service for 120 days. It was an easy decision.
are you maaaad
Try the Honor X9A 5G
Jerry's hands need lotion.
The only reason for me to buy my s22 was its size. For years i've wanted a small phone and they finally delivered it
Hi Jerry, can I have the phone please
that Casio though!
You can definitely tell which pic is from which phone if you look closely. A quick glance though and you'll definitely not be able to tell. The one on the left was s23 for anyone wondering
My guess is that the made in Korea version 1tb should be better quality the made in Vietnam version (256 and 512)
S23 Ultra!!
I'm a little bit sad that you've gone from  90% durability test to 50% durability test and the rest just snarky comments
Waiting for one plus 11 😅😅
Your content never disappoint @indrsharma9660
Is that a Huawei P30 pro that you have ?
Do honor x9a
The sound made from scraping the side of the phone made my skin crawl. Nevertheless your voice while reviewing was very soothing and relaxing. Overall well made video and review. Thanks 😁👍🏻
I have one on order. But i might cancel after watching this clip. I have the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G. It has a cracked screen, but it still works a treat. Samsung Marketing in Australia are crafty at the moment.  Offering a Samsung watch if you buy the S23 range this month.
Unless buying new a phone is necessary for your work " generate more money for you" then no need to change it every one or two years
This phone going on ebay? Haha
Xiaomi 12 pro Teardown plz 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Xiaomi 12 pro Teardown plz 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
How can they fit an entire pen inside the phone but not a headphone jack???
How can you carry on about advertising when you do ten minute videos with 2 minute ads on every video? Hypocritical much?
On Facebook, Samsung has been advertising heavily on this phone. Many people ask what is the major difference. I point out, per Samsung's website, that the only difference is the new camera lense which is now 200 resolution versus the S22 ultra 105 resolution. And that Samsung is spending billions on marketing and not technology (per this video). I have received nothing but "thank you" and positive comments. Because I watched Zack's video and then went to Samsung's website page to verify Zack's comments. He is spot on!!!  Thank you!!!
I am waiting for the OnePlus 11 on your tabe for that ultimate durability bend test. Fingers crossed
I don't get the yearly update for normal peoples I'm still using my galaxy j4 from 2018; mostly because I'm broke but also cause I can make do off what I already have. I mean I get it if you are swapping with a new one... Situations apply
I'm looking forward to the upcoming squirrel durability test...
Buvini ami
Can you do the OnePlus 11 next please?
The only review I see that is completely honest. Got a Note 10+ (since my note 4 sadly broke) after seeing your teardown video, and have loved it ever since. The phone is thin but strong and the only thing that has broke is the back glass which I've replaced several times myself (on my 5th one lol) although i never put a case on this phone. Not only that but it's extremely easy to replace parts if something breaks. Ever since Samsung has been extremely lazy and taking the Apple side of things by making slight upgrades, but taking away basic functions like expandable storage. Was even contemplating about getting a S23 since other reputable reviewers say its good but seeing this vid im convinced its not. Samsung as a brand has been losing quality for more money, using more money on dodgy marketing instead of making something that is reliable, especially considering thier recent problem where thier m.2 nvme sdd's where not having the right firmware and brick the ssd. Sad to see them go down this path and hope they can just make quality products again.
Waiting for OnePlus 11
I'm going from the s10+ to that thing because my battery is going kaput
😭 no don't mess with my dream phone! Please!
I really would appreciate having a phone like this one
😘😘👍👍
Lol ....right next to the microphone hole
i will not move from my note 20 ultra until the micro sd is back
I just met this guy today . I just subscribed . He's kinda crazy
Mine will be here Friday,  updating from a still working fine Note 9. I felt like this is a big enough jump up and don't plan to update for another 5 to 6 years. I don't think there's much more they can do with phones.
Glad to see you're wearing the legendary Casio F-91W watch!
Jerry 👋👋👋
Did you just use a sharp tool to take-out the paper cover from the phone 😳🙆‍♂️
Last two years Samsung does not give me any reasons to upgrade my S21 Ultra. It can already take pictures of the moon by the way.
I  cry to see him break thing💔💔💔 i think he break my heart 2
I wish I could afford one of these phones 🥺 I really need a new phone.
@JerryRigEverything I just got the Samsung S23 Ultra. 2ND day owing it, I see it slowly Bowd ( Its bent through the middle )
love the classic casio!
Advertisment? What's that?   *laughs in premium*
3:20 😮‍💨
I have an S21 Ultra and it works perfectly fine, I love it to bits. Other than the built in S-pen and the now upgraded main camera it is practically the same as the S23 Ultra. If my phone breaks I will definitely upgrade to an S23 ultra because it has a number of small features that I would love to have but until then I probably won't spend so much money on a phone that is barely any more capable than my 2 year old one.
3:21 this is not unexpected but it cracked me up just how easily it snapped
love the watch
One phone give me 🙏
Please sir
Please one phone give me 🙏😥
Sam claiming going green while including free charger with your preorder silly lol
me still waiting for the lighter to burn the screen
OnePlus 11 durability Test?
MAA SHA ALLAH zbrdast
iphone is still better
Doesn't Samsung put a screen protector on as standard cos my s21 and s22 ultra had one.
My heart brocken when you scratch the phone 😓 Iam still using 2018 model phone 🥲
The way he breaks S pen everytime 🤣
Waiting for OnePlus 11
Wen jerry asked if we saw an samsung ad on this video, my mind thought i havnt seen a samsung ad yet on this video or been a while since i remember seeing an samsung ad on a video of samsung phone review which was very usual thing in past. Then i thought wait a minute i havnt seen any ads on videos recently. Then only i remembered i was offered free premium membership for 3 months by youtube and its been more than a year i am a premium member. I was stuck on the premium matrix and got addicted started to pay monthly on premium and i cannot think of youtube with ads.  Really locked and addicted.
Upload the durability test of OnePlus 11 5g .
Watching this on my 23 ultra
I use a Note10+ too as my daily driver.  Anyone experiencing battery drains with the Exynos variant? I had the battery replaced 1 year ago.
My teeth on the scratch
Great video as usual can't wait to see inside
Not all exciting to you
Waiting for huawei mate 50
This phone literally feels like a brick in the pocket
Is it true that all innovation and product quality improvement projects got canceled when the covid hit? I don't know (should not share).   Is it a conspiracy, or just a short therm survival strategy for the big industry? I have nothing to say, but that i will not buy any tech product with manufacturing date between end of 2019 and 2026 (I don't know how long the innovation freeze will last, might even evolve into something completely different)  Note10 might remain the best smartphone by value... in human history :(
do we still need to buy camera lens protector?does s22u and s23u camera glass can get easily scratched? does it have gorrilla victus on it?
Sir can you give me this s23 ultra 🙂 it looks beautiful after all test🥲❤️
Đây là điều các hãng sản xuất không khuyến khích ,, vì họ đã đưa lên những thứ tốt nhất quả đất
7:30 ☠️ Samsung should fear.
I willl get a new phone till my old one get overheat or running super slow. So far so good.
I just got this phone. My last one was 5 years old and dying on me. I initially wanted the S22 Ultra but being placed in Europe and having to pay more for a worse of phone with the exynos chip, compared to the snapdragon, wasn't a prospect I was fond of. Also it had battery and ovearheating problems. So when they decided to put snapdragon chips in all the phones no matter your geographical location, as well as make the battery better as well as the cooling system I decided to buy. Haven't been disappointed so far. Great video by the way.
These companies removed adapted from the box to reduce e-waste but they did not reduce price for that. In order to save our nature and reduce waste, the only way is to limit our want. We should use products as long as they can serve. Moreover, if these companies truly want to help saving nature, they need to build durable products and they need to provide service for a long term instead of making us think of replacing lagging phones due to software upgrade.
Thoughts on Samsung proposing a ban on the import of all aftermarket OLED's, including iPhone's?
still using my s10, might be waiting for s30 ultra for an upgrade.
Watching on my s21 ultra 😂
.
What you do gives me goosebumps
Why is it so painfull AHHHHH!!
Why are you still annoying Elon Musk on Twitter? Dude, just leave.  You're ruining my opinion of your channel on YouTube.  Be a man and leave like you promised.  Are all Mormons this vindictive and grimy??
Does anyone here have a spare cellphone, old?
Very entertaining and educational more power and godbless with ur family always
I'm confused why the selfie 📷 is only 12mp but the s22 ultra is 40mp
Let us Repent Jesus is coming 🙌
😊😊 thanks
how the camera is it better then S22 ultra..!
Wasted 7 min to see a destruction process of phone,and what he proved   by this?
Watching from a 10+ 😁
I'm still rocking the Razer Phone 2 till this day! :) Almost 5 years of use! and stilll going strong
Do we have any information about the camera glass? Is it normal glass or "gorilla glass" glass?
We have good hopes for the COOLING 😉
S23 ultra very great But you can't use it
from @mkbhd to @unboxtheraphy that convince me to buy a new phone, only this man that makes sense not to upgrade ...
2:11 Sure, Mr. Egg 🤣🤣🤣
My eyes hurt when see scratches
got samsung philippines ads
Bro why, U could just give that to me then doing all that
Casio watch f91 v
you'll be here soon......
i need a charger
The S-pen can be useful for many things...SNAP!
Are where any news about Oneplus 11 durability test? It's the last piece that decides whether I buy or not
Indeed...  I agree.  Most company's, the already well established ones, they literally don't "NEED" to be wasting money on Advertising, they could be doing so much more with that money. Like Coke...  They have zero need to do major advertising, yet they spend billions doing so.
😐 what did i just watch !!
Can you give me the samsung s23 ultra for free ?
When you have 7days replacement option 😜
I wonder how Zach manages to take good care his 3+ years old phone when he can destroy a new phone for just minutes. :D
"The pen can be useful for a lot of things." SNAPS!!!
when you test oneplus 11 ???  i am waiting for you
Please send me this one ❤️😉  India
Still using my note 9 all the way from Zambia. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
I have the s20 ultra. Should I upgrade?
I only buy samsung budget phone. Galalxy A series is great 👍  It's incredibly durable.  Battery is big and internet browser is fast.
Mine was 400 down from 1400, lol. I guarantee you, it will not go to 50% next year...
Discomfort for those who can't afford it 🤐
Nice
I want to see a OnePlus 11 test bus as much as I want to see the OnePlus 11 durability test I know it will be destroyed due to the placement of the camera. Still a good phone though
Bought a new phone after 5 years, yes I got the s23 ultra 1tb. What sucks is no charger and you only get a cable with no free charger, you can't even use an SD card . I bought the Note 9 5 years ago and it was great. The S23 ultra is superior in performance and technology but why not include a charger when other companies give a free 100watt charger. I had to buy a 50 dollar 65W charger 😭
Half price next year? They're still selling the s22 ultra for full price
Could you ever do a hardness test for tempered glass screen protectors?  Are they really 9h? Or is it all marketing, are they stronger than the phone screens?
i am also a note 10 plus user and dont wanna upgrade cause still can be use
Lol I got an add for samsung on this vid. The only reason i purchased this phone, and i mean the ONLY reason, is because my company partnered with PerkSpot and i saved like $500 on the phone and got like 5 items free! Including a case wireless charging pad and some other stuff. **I Still paid half a kidney but ay, i wont be buying another phone for a LONG time**
Finally upgraded from my note 10+ with the aura glow. Definitely gonna miss it. Best color ever.
I have the s22 ultra. Next phone I'll get is the S25 ultra
I still miss my note 10(traded for flip3)... just got s23U today, feels good to be back.
3:20 somebody somewhere just died a little inside
I like watching your vids pal. But, that [...]like tesla does. This got me mad. We all know that tesla does the same thing as Every other person. Generating money without the highest quality
Trust me I am upgrading from my s8+
And just like that I've decided to keep my Note 10+ for a bit longer. Thanks for sealing the decision!
Yea I got w samsung ad😅
So brutal 😱😂
@3:20 LMAO
Tell me I'm not the only one that after reading the tittle 'close your eyes' thought this S23 would break in half from Zach's 'gentle' touch 😁
still are exploding💥
Destroying the phones I dream of having  can't watch this  😩 😭
I want that phone 😭😭
Galaxy buds 2 pro ad at the end yo
Good work Zack, to me it is a bit annoying that new phones are presentet every 6 months, and all of them are almost the same...
The unboxing experience feels mediocre without the charging brick and earbuds in the box. Your getting half the experience for more of the price
I find the s22 ultra and the s23 ultra absolute magnificent phones.
Yep Samsung tab s8 ad
I only upgraded to this because I wanted away from the OnePlus 8, or OnePlus in general. The CCP probably has all my info already, since I've used it for a while... But at least they cant get more? Or more as easily.
Lesson to learn... do durability test first then put it on a case. Gotcha sir!
you said the only difference is th camera. Theres also a CPU/GPU upgrade
Do a durability test on the Carbinox watch
we could clearly tell the picture on the right was better, look at the colors. I have no idea which is which tho but I can say for sure the right one is better
I'm typically two years per phone.  My last phone was a note 8 that got absolutely destroyed when I feel down some brick steps.  Got an 21 ultra after and my two years ends next month. Likely gonna trade it in for a 23 ultra. And I'll hold it for a couple years lol
Y aren’t u taking about how similar it looks to s22? I mean… u literally always talk about how iPhones look similar and they are all the same, And if ur bias towards Samsung u should make that clear, u should say that. It’s ok if u are bias but it just makes you a bit dishonest
F*** Samsung
Please rwvoew honorx9a 5g
I like in your videos how transparent and unbiased you are 👏by the way, the moon photos are not real. Also the zoom is not real. Once you zoom using the digital zoom, the phone freezes the image to stabilize it. So zooming on a moving object and people in general is useless.
My current phone is Note 10 Plus too. It has been 3.5 years. And I am telling myself to wait for one more year. But, marketing is too strong this time. I may not be able to resist.
The Tesla analogy is pretty sad, since Tesla is just advertising feature, instead of actually having them
youre basic apple fanboy, i see it miles away
Dude you forget to make a video "teardown" for the Nudia Redmagic 7
I'll be keeping my s22 ultra. I use phones for 5+ years usually but s23 ultra being made from recycled parts intrigued me. Now though it doesn't sound as nice.
Seeing all these videos, I question why do we need a new Galaxy phone and a new iPhone every year?
Don’t understand the flame test, who torches their phone???
Do a teardrop of Realme Gt Neo 5
Wow...Mr Rig I'm in South Africa ...i don't think I've ever got a give away from any of the channels I subscribe and watch ...can't you hook me up with a phone number on your next give away ...i could do with an upgrade these phones cost way too much here so we usually afford them after two years of their initial release ...please connect a brother with a mobile ..!
Waiting for that Tesla Phone
this guy going ham on Samsung, love it!
I don't think that most people realize that "natural coloring" comes from natrual pigment found in plants and animals, they crush them up and extract the pigment with an "unnatural" solvent. There is no such thing as environmentally friendly coloring.
Roasting aside, what blows my mind is the screen took the lighter like a champ for a full minute and didn't even show discoloration. Either the new glass is super heat resistant or can dissipate heat very well.
wow
Hi, what about OnePlus 11 durability test? 🙄
The phone is $1200 ($1380 for the memory ugrade) but the trade in offers made it worth it for me this year. My S20 Ultra is in great shape but my battery dies super fast. With all of the trade-in incentives it was $200 over 24 months on my T-Mobile bill. And on top of that I avoided T-Mobile's $35 upgeade fee and got another $100 in Samsung credit for ordering directly through Samsung. Felt more like $100 to upgrade on a $1380 phone. There's nothing special about the phone but a new battery will be great among other small details. These videos are alway great though!
Jerry with a legendary Casio F-91w in his wrist ;)
My eyes....
U are the wierdest human being ever, anyway, that makes me luv Sam more
Definitely samsung should invest more on R&D not adverts no meaningful upgrade from s21 just like apple I think phones are plateud and it's now making profits like removing  accessories and upgrading internals skyrocketing the prices
Yes there is samsung ad😅
I'm still using a OnePlus 6 256gb after 5 years and it still kicks ass, even though the battery is slowly getting weaker.
Hey man! I highly recommend trying the HONOR X9a 5G on your durability test videos. I think it's durable enough to pass your tests.
Contac for me if you want give away this broke phone 🤩🤩🤗
Shitsung
I live all the way in norway, and i ordered dbrand it took over 3 weeks to arrive. Got the samsung s20 ultra. Its still in allmost brand new condition.  But i would upgrade if i had the money cuz of the pen👍
he probably sent all the products he destroyed to apple's tech recycle website
Give me this phon
You are killer of phone😭😭
Phones are so boring. 🥱 rocking an s10+
My phone is almost dead. I want to change it? No. Do I have to change it. Yep. Am I buying a brand new phone? Nope
2:14 the one on the right is the s23 ultra
These companies act green to hide the red.
Painful
If ‘going green’ wasn’t lining their pocket most of these companies wouldn’t be doing it. But thanks to the good guys amongst us who actually go out of their way and investigate these companies’ claims, they are forced to do a little.
This video is tearing samsung apart and next video is taking samsung apart... Makes sense... 👍😃
Had a Samsung add here
still waiting on the iphone 14 pro max 🥲
Cool
I've had the new s23 ultra for about 3 days now. Literally day o e I was in my back yard bbq'ing with some friends when it fell out of my chairs cup holder. This was a fall from about 1 foot and the entire backing shattered. This has got to be the most pathetic excuse for durability I've ever seen out of a phone. The whole reason I got it was bc my oneplus 7 McLaren edition finally bit the dust but man does this not meet any expectation.
Why are you distroying it give to someone or me
Green washing is what this channel's all about.
In the future, we'll see the same company releasing a new phone on the same series every month. S69 S69A S69B S69C ....And so on Its probably unlikely but it would be hilarious to see.
I thought snapping the S Pen like that was unnecessary but after thinking about it I realize it was informative. I don't know why I thought the S Pen was made of metal or something harder than plastic.
If you use natural products they are taking stuff away from the environment. Not any better than lab produced.
3:17 bruuh..
Ive had the s23 ultra for alil more than 1 week and ive used it like all samsung ive had but the screens scratches already look like its 1 year old
i hate my 22 ultra. network drops. throttling during usage. and constantly wanta to remove my apps  not to mention iy thpea whatever it wants. junk
Thumbs up for bashing a company for bragging about a 10% recycle rate.
@samsung how much are the users saving with all the recycled materials?
Do they save us money with the packaging too? Or do they just save on taxes?
ഇയാൾക്ക് പ്രാന്താ 😑🚶
I'm still using my Note 4 and it hasn't given up on me. 🤣
Imagine spend 1000 more bucks to have recycled material phone and doesn't give you an adapter
it´s annoying to hear all the hate on samsung for launching a simiar phone to last year´s, when Apple has been doing that for years
Im using my Xiaomi MiA2  more than 4 year.   Mybe next year ill change it
Jerry how can you talk about eco when you destroy brand - new phones and make a garbage of them within minutes to make money from content published on YT?
😱😱😱
I'm upgrading from Note 9 to S23 Ultra 👍
I always cry 😭...
Manufacturers are exploring  'Jerry ready phones'
So the Gorilla glass victus 2 made basically no improvement when it come to scatches... that' extremely disappointing. I wasted 3 protector screens from  Samsungs shop, 2 of them got attached by a phone store worker on the s23u still bubbles all over the places. She said she never had that massive problems... The 3rd one I wasted myself, bubbles and stripes all over the place.   Don't get me wrong, I love this Phone, coming from a Huawei p20 Pro (changed 3 times the protector screen during that time without bubbles lol) that is showing it's age and you really feel the improvement in all aspects, so I wanted a Phone that lasts at least 4years +. The "new" Gorilla glass victus 2 was promising to me, finally using a phone with it's actual glass... but I guess nope still not possible without risking scratches.  It is also the first video I have ever watched of you, and using the knife on the alu gave me shiver down the spine... thank you. Cracking the Pen also made me slowly blink with my eyes, I felt very disturbed, thank you again. But also thank you for doing all this~
Sir please give  me the phone 🙂 its my dream phone
Watching from my years old S9 plus... Except one battery change, its still going strong...
I am watching this om my four-year-old Note 9, which is still doing pretty well: just got the battery replaced recently and it still shines, even without those hundreds of megapixels...
NGL not only it was a Samsung ad... But was a 20 sec unskipable one... And IDK why but Jerry's videos always have long unskipable ads not only at the start but in the middle as well... Sometimes more than 3 ads 🙄... Am I the only one with these unskipable ones 😅 😅
No headphone jack?
I upgraded from the note 10 plus to the s22 ultra. The s23 is exactly the same as the s21 n s22 with a different name. Im mad samsung thinks its users are brain dead n wouldnt notice
Producing the most phones, and “doing the bare minimum” is still more than what others are doing. You’re annoying with that one.
The selfie on the right is S23 Ultra, I know for sure since the time on ur watch is showing a few minutes before the other one. 😉 (But u have a point they ain't that far apart)
It's pretty cool. But not $1200 cool.  Story of the entire smartphone market. flagships used to be like $600 and I still used to think I ain't spending more than $300 on my phone. Now the cheapest phone I can buy is $800. How sad.
Huawei Mate50Pro (Kunlun Glass) please 🙏🙏🙏🙏
👍 nice
no i didnt get a samsung advertisement i use an ad blocker so i dont get ads its like youtube premium without the offline feature
The only reason i'm willing to upgrade a phone, is software updates, the hardware is stagnate and doesn't really justify the price/performance phones are getting lately
No Samsung
Holding on to note 10 plus, 3 years and still going strong 💪
JerryRigEverything: *snaps an s-pen in half*  Me for the 1000th time: "dayum"
Waiting for OnePlus 11 test
2:02 does that person look like he destroys tech for a living
Due to the time stamp on your watch, left picture was Note phone, right was S23
Was the screen scratching test using Mohs scale?
The S24 lineup is being completely redesigned from someone who used to work at Mercedes. Who knows what Samsung will look like next year.
Close walet🥺 Sell home for this device 😅  Hanya disini saya melihat smartphone mahal bisa di rusak! Thankyou om jerry sehat selalu anda dan keluarga.
I'm still using the Note 9. I think it will last me another couple years.
IT SURVIVED!.... for now 🤣
Watching on a 14 Pro which I got yesterday 😂
Dang it, I didn't close my eyes. This was too painful to watch. Good information nonetheless. Thanks Zack for the videos. Going to my cardiologist tomorrow 🤪
This is a Horror Show! 🤣🫡
I have a 21 ultra and am upgrading to the 23 ultra. This will be my last upgrade at least for the next 4 years unless Samsung really ups the game and brings something really worth it to the table.
Well...I'm not ashamed to watch this video on my current daily driver, Samsung Galaxy S9+
These phones are ridiculously expensive now
“Use it up, Wear it out. Make it do or do without” 😭👌🏾 Golden
Hiii jerry rig.... You Are Gonna switch your phone from galaxy note 10+ to s23ultra ?
Lol, everything is recycled , but they still charge a arm and leg for it
Me watching this video after I cracked my phone all of the phones he opens up are pre breaked
Not worth $1,000 for sure just get something else Samsung's newer phone models are failing very badly......
Yo mirando desde mi  gran prime como destruyen el cel de mis sueños 😪
please bring back changable battery, sd sim card back I really miss those
Kinda miss teardown videos
Do OnePlus 11 Test I wonder if you break the same as OnePlus 10 Pro
no card slot, no audiojack, no charger, no headphones, still large front camera hole... well fuck you Samsung!
Fun fact: when Samsung, Apple, and Google ship their first party phone cases and other accessories to retailers, each one comes in an individual plastic bag.
Amazing video. I hope there will be one on the 1+ 11 :D
If these companies really cared about the enviroment they would be investing in maintainability of their devices. Avery single Samsung AND Apple iPhones i had, including my sister's and parent's devices screens malfunctioned after software updates around year 3 of use. Meanwhile notebooks can be used to last a decade, you can swap drives, memory, batteries and they cost the same.  This is just PR bullshit.
This is why I buy the top of the line phone when I do upgrade, it lasts a whole lot longer.  Still rocking my Note 20 Ultra and it's still working perfectly with day long battery life. Maybe I'll retire her with the 24 UItra
Jerry teardowne test let us see what is the difference from s22
I'm also a techie, buuuut there's a difference between liking new tech & constantly buying new tech. I'm still packing an S8+ in my pocket each and every day and it's gonna stay like that until the thing either explodes or more likely ... it just dies or becomes unusable somehow. Maybe when the battery gets to be unusable or something.  Anyway ... I'm looking to keep it for many more years if I can.
I know it doesn't get the views but why not take apart the phones people actually buy? Like the Samsung A series?
I got a pixel 7 commercial on this video lol
Gift ne the s23 ultra! 😣
“Polling among super nerds” Shows a Twitter poll 😂
Dude, literally got the Samsung Ad before this specific video hahaha, I think Samsung is trying to mimick Apple with this one, less changes more on words, or it might be that they also reached almost peak of their product as well?
I waited too upgrade until i had a reason too😅 my s8 was completly shattered and battery was trash. So it was an amazing upgrade
“The S-pen is useful for a lot of things”  *Proceeds to snap it in half*
The s pen was incredibly easy to broke
they didn't innovate the hardware much from s22-s23 because they seem to have perfected the design of a phone, but there are tons of more features in the software side and everything in the s23 is better even though it looks the same. the camera module, the selfie cam, the chipset, speakers, screen, etc.
the smartphone inovation is really gone sadly, i still have my note 10+ and i'm really surprised how besides the camera, nothing really changed in design, especially the screen, not to mention the asking price for new devices that have less storage and ram then my phone lol
So I guess I'm one of the super nerds who still holds on to his Oneplus 6t for god knows how many years now.
I am holding on to my Note 10+ since 3.5 years. Will upgrade when you do, unless it's an iPhone.
Make test on Honor X9A
Well I already ordered it, from a note 10+ lol. I think the note camera aray is pretty bad compared to the s23 ultra and it's new image processing. I can't take a picture worth a damn in anything less than broad daylight.
Since when is Tesla innovative? 2015? They haven't "innovated" in quite some time. Lol excluding software updates. Cars look the exact same as they did 5 years ago. Perhaps J was being funny or sarcastic.
The way he talks during these tests can make you stay on his channel watching a video over and over again
The scratch test results in scratch level 6, exactly the same like a 4 years old Galaxy S10. How can this be?
Been waiting on this .
note 10 plus and s23 is a big big difference.
Oppo 11
running the note9 since 2018
The finishing words were a killer. :D
No other youtber have this power to do with the phones
1200 dollars for a recycled material phone hahaha no way
ouch the video hurts💔😅
left pic is from s23
It’s kind of ironic how this guy tears apart gadgets and make them useless and complaints how something is not 100% recycled.
I am so tired of this environment crap.
Can I have the phone
Gimme
I bought the phone, only because it has snapdragon and it was almost the same price as the S22 Ultra anyways! It will do well for the next 3 or so years! But I'm gutted at no charger in the box or screen protector pre installed like my s21 Ultra had!
You seemed like you didn't want to do this video ? The way you just throwing and dropping stuff around.
Its a shame how many tech waste you Produce...
Can you give me this damaged phone!?
Could ya test the xcover 5? pretty durable for a very cheap price w replaceable battery
oneplus11pls
OnePlus 11 bend test ??
Just Love the way You are tearing down a phone. eagerly waiting for this phone's teardown. Love You from Pakistan.
What happened to opening the phones up like you used to? That's what I was hoping to see again. I still use my Note 10+ 5g as it's been a great phone, the only reason I upgraded to the S23 Ultra is because my youngest son shattered the screen on his S9+. So he will be getting the Note, while I enjoy the new phone. I hope to get at least 4 years out of the S23. Even though there doesn't seem to be as much of an upgrade year to year these days, I absolutely loved the Note 10+ and don't really need any more ridiculous fluff built into these phones. I'll just be happy still having an S Pen, and the faster processor with a bigger battery. I know there will be improvements to the camera software down the road, so I'll enjoy this phone for a long time I hope.
Samsung flagships are having less and less features every year, but bigger price tag. S9/maybe s10 are the last proper flagship.
I'm pretty sure that removing the charger from the box and making the compact boxes did help Samsung with their green initiative. 😇👍🏼     Green being the money ofcourse.🤑
Bro broke S pen instantly 🥲
When is dbrand releasing the teardown skin for the S23 Ultra!
Bro, why can't I afford this phone, can you gift me one of these phones?
If, I have this phone🥹🥺🥺
still rocking my s10, owuld like 120hz but that is not worth an upgrade, will keep it til it fails
@JerryRigEverything  hello!  Below, near the charging port, there are 3 holes. 1 for opening the sim tray, 2 for the microphone. And why 3 holes near the speaker?
Where is the teardown video for s23 ultra upload soon love from india❤️
I got to be honest, this is very good advertising for dbrand.
dude get some moisturizer
Can you please this phone?
Any amount of recycling is good recycling..Might want to fact check that Jerry. Quite a large percentage of recycling is far less "green" than simply creating something new. The idea of recycling is great, the practical reality in many cases is not so much.
but if im not buying a new phone, i wouldnt want to spend so much money on expensive casings like your sponsor Dbrand lol
I got a crypto ad... Some competitor of Binance or something ....
Legends Still Closes Eye 👁
Giving so much torture to a brand new device hurt me so much.
Same as you i am using note10 plus for a long time ...and now it feels like a good time to upgrade as we have seen really drastic improvements in s23 ultra...i have pre ordered it already as well..lets upgrade jerry
LMAO The ad is actually s23 😭
pic - right one from s23
basta de envidia, Samsung S23 es el MEJOR, THE BEST🔥🔥🔥🔥
First ad was Ford and 2nd is actually the s23 ultra one
Love my d brand case - seriously folks. It's worth the money.
Your commentary is everything. Love it.
Nice 23 U
Still on the S10 here
Your data on how many people update their phones is skewed. Because of the nature of the content and channels, results come out different. You have the habit of praising your 3 year old phone, so your viewers tend to be inspired by you and keep their phones a bit longer. My Mate 20 Pro is probably gonna be substituted after 5 years, flgship phones longevity is a beautiful thing
i dont give a shit about the enviroment, give me my charger back !
That box cutter noise 😳
"This year for full price... Or next year for half price..."   Oof.
Here with an s21 ultra, still going strong. I'm disappointed this new phone isn't a huge leap. I'll have to wait for next year's phones and see if they're worth getting
💯
no hesitation breaking that 3:21 pen
Try Nokia X30 5G
Omg I wat this phone so bad an he just destroyed it😭
Only change glass name, no inprove hardness , coz gorilla glass 4 and victus scraches lavel same 🤔
This guy is gonna get killed and we wont know if it was from Apple or Samsung... But we all know LG wont be to blame hahahah.! And we all know it looks like bad advertisment but there is no such thing... I hope Samsung and Apple realice that and support him, I wouldnt mind...
My S22 ultra is just fine. I can do all the same.
Slightly offtopic: Props to dbrand for actually putting the little effort into making small cutouts for every camera lens.  Some case makers just cut out 1 big piece and call it a day, while charging a shitton of money for it.
Hey Jerry, I actually got a samsung advert LOL
S23 ultra: oh yay i am ready to be pampered by my new owner! *Phone sees Jerry after he unboxed it* S23 ultra: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
45W charger, 15W wireless charging and 4,5W reverse wireless charging, back to 2020.
Also waiting for oneplus 11 durability test
Man, could you do the Poco X5 Pro next? I hear it's got one of the best specs for a mid-range phone but structurally, it's quite easy to break. Was wondering if you could do a teardown.
When do we get teardown?
Where is the Johnny
The 2 selfies are very different. The right one is sharper and has a lot more detail in the face area (the important part in a selfie I'd say). I'd be surprised if it were the s10, but then again software is more relevant than ever in smartphone photography and the older phone has more updates under the hood. But you can't say those 2 pictures are the same, because they are most definitely not.
Hasta donde llega la movida de Piqué, que hasta Jerry lleva un Casio ...
I have my phone 4 years ago and i've replaced the screen and went broken again I'm thinking changing it but with a phone deserve to live longer for another 5 years but I'm so confused which mid range phone shall i buy and no recommendations for Xiaomi the worst network coverage
Sorry but what is he talking about in those pictures, it's so blatantly obvious. Look how bad the other shot is
Let's take some s23 ulta apart
Glass is worse for the environment to recycle than it is to make new
Good job samsung ... Except the price
Is triste Guy an IDIO**???
HahAhaha i m not nice to phones even to my own phones
😭😭 watching you destroy my dream phone
Normal people: Take new phone out of the box with extreme care JerryRigEverything: Takes phone out of the box with a razor knife
I can actually tell that the s23 Ultra selfie at the right is a bit sharper, but true, a very small difference
WHY YOU ARE NOT MAKING TREARDOWN & DURABILITY VIDEO FOR 14 PRO MAX??
You can make tests like using tools with flat or round files more interesting...
I'm at the age of not buying a new phone until the old one no longer works. 😊
This kinda break my heart tho, id love to have one of these. But dont have the money. And your here breaking 1200 dollars
And actually Samsung THIS YEAR did not innovate from the OUTSIDE but they INNOVATE from the INSIDE
Second one is 1000 percent the S23 Ultra
all cases are pretty much same if u gona  advertise do it for phone screen protection where it counts
Fk y D:
Same here s9 plus owner for the last 4 years and still everything is clicking like brand new. No issues so far
For full price in not upgrading. But ATT gave me $1,000 for my note 10+. You'd be an idiot not to take $1,000 for an almost 4 year old phone.
Can you give me this phone please .. its my dream phone 😍🥲
They might consider rebranding the company to "Samesong" :)
Will you do an iPhone 14 pro max durability test?
The s pen can be the most useful thing (breaks it immediately after that)
So you're perfectly happy with your 4 year old Samsung phone. And you have literally not a single bad thing you can say about the S23 Ultra. And they're using recycled materials. Heck, the screen was literally making fun of your burn test. Still you decide to criticise samsung so much for some bullshit reason. Marketing budget, seriously ??
🥺 like it..! 😒🤧
It was painful listening to the pulling of the shell.
I've got a 2 year old S21 Ultra. Works perfectly and in spite of the fact I've never used a case with it, it's in perfect condition.   But you know what? I still ordered myself an S23 Ultra. Why? Not because of Samsung's marketing - I hadn't seen a single ad for it before I ordered it.  No,  I am buying one because I want one. No other reason.  Also, call me a cynic but the environmental angle is not because they genuinely care about the planet, but because it's another marketing tactic. They want our money and being seen to care about the planet may be enough to convince the environmentally conscious among us to open their wallets.
Give me that phone 🥹
sorpreso dalla fragilità del dispositivo.. samsung deve lavorare molto sulla resistenza, spero che lo faccia al prossimo Device
Most definitely got a Samsung advertise b4 this video. Gotta love the work you do thanks a lot Jerry
The humour in this video 😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂
@6:39 the only reason why your phone survived 3 and a half years is because it wasn't featured in a teardown video 😁...
man I've been with my phone since 2016...*sob*...*sob*...
I upgraded my device after 7 years , it felt good .
Do anyone remember mrwhosetheboss video about Samsung batteries puffing up? Did they fix it??
oneplus 11 plzzz
Why don't you do a bear test on Huawei mate 50 pro
no hesitation on bending s-pen 🤘
IPhone noob...
You still love your note 10 pro
it's plenty enough for me s22 ultra 5g, 256gb 12 ram ;)
Waiting for your video on the new OnePlus 11 and 11R
I agree with u about phone upgrades. No need to upgrade every year and even every 2-3 years. I bought my iPhone 6s from a friend who bought it in 2015 and used it for 2 years. I used it for another 4 years until upgrading to iPhone 11 in 2021, then I passed it to my little brother who still uses it to this day. We only switch batteries every 2 years or so and my brother switched a screen once after cracking it. This phone still works fine and dandy and does most of the things with no problems. Phones nowadays have a lot of resource in them to be used for more than 3-4 years. I personally will not upgrade my iPhone 11 until maybe 2025 cause it still works perfectly and even battery health is 94% after almost 2 years of use cause I take care of charging and try not to overcharge it.
😢 I'm gonna need a minute after watching this. So traumatized.
After 4.5 years owning a Huawei P20Pro i just ordered a S23 because the lack of updates Huawei provides.  And funnily i got a Samsung Buds ad before the video 😂
His phone probably be like: HELP ME!! GET ME OUTTA HIS HANDS PLEASE!!! GOD!
How calmly he fuck those expenses 🫣😀
The top is completely empty!!! Where is the headphone jack?!!!
You Brock the expensive S pen 🤣🤣
Honesty, the Galaxy S8 is perfectly fine even after 5 years, almost all apps (the ones that I use at least) work fine, it has a really decent camera and display. The battery has kinda degraded but not to an unusable level. I just have an external SD for extra storage
No doubt, Samsung puts a lot of money into ads but I feel like tech nerds like us tend to see right through that so, with that being said:   The s23 Ultra seems to be a very solid phone. It's basically an S22 Ultra with meaningful improvements in one or two major aspects of what makes a phone great. If I had an S22 Ultra, I'd either have to be  quite rich or really stupid to upgrade to this but, as Zack pointed out, the average tech geek isn't upgrading every  year so, for those of us considering this phone,  most of our points of reference isn't the S22 Ultra. May end up getting this one once the S24 Ultra (or whatever Samsung's next flagship is called) pushes prices for the S23 line up down.
“You either buy it for full price this year or Half price next year” you only experience this level of depreciation with samsung not iphone
I need this phone
What doing this phone
Still running my S9... maybe next year,  maybe ...
i am still rocking my a5 2017
Can you do the same thing with Regular S23
i always hate you
So painfully!
where is the durability test on the OnePlus 11 ? 😆
each time you teardown phones feels like my chest is teared apart knowing it is sponsored, yet I keep watching... btw I am curious what happen after those phones being teared apart, are you keeping them like a collection? or you repair them and gave to your lucky followers? or repair it and then sell it... and if your giving it, I wish I could be that one lucky follower so I can finally upgrade my 4 years old Huawei y9...
🤣🤣😅 I love how you tore Samsung down in this video Jerry. Awesome sense of humor. I'm holding on to my Galaxy Note 20. Them removing microSD card support in the Ultra series, is highly unappreciated, especially since we don't even get a 1TB option in Nigeria where I am. They're suffocating power users.👍🏿
Funny, I got a iPhone ad
Samsung phones are durable.  I didn't get an add do.  Still love the S23 ultra  Looks better and feels better than the S22 ultra.  Talking about improvement  The screen lasted for 60s under the heat, that's something we don't see everyday.
GOOSEBUMPS with those screeches from  that blade 😁😁😁😁
They all use interesting marketing terms such as "recycled", "environment friendly" and more when in reality they literally won't stop producing the same boring, dull phones every year with a price hike and a new name. And sheeps all around the world are yet again ready to be milked. The concept of innovation is simply no more in Samsung and Apple systems.
Samsung even advertised their unpacked event on amazon. I've never seen a company doing that.
This year for full price or the next year for the half price 😂
I didn't ask for anything on my birthday because I didn't need anything. I got an S23 Ultra in the mail which is an unnessecary upgrade from my S10e, I guess I don't need to upgrade my phone for the next decade. Honestly feels like a waste of dough
S Pen be like : Why did you break me 🤣
The S-pen is useful for a lot of things- :Breaks it
S20 is still working perfect 👌
Upgrade 3-3,5 years
I don't believe in gorilla's protection
No I got a goat ad
Watching on S22 ultra
This review is bad, because who's going to base their uage of this smartphone relative to this bad durability testing use case???  I mean this is super baaaad!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm sorry I just don't like the review at all.
2:30 Hardest part 💀💀
The marketing team is making more effort than the innovation team, crazyyy and if you think about it it's actually more difficult for marketing team to market same phone as last year 😆
Lets destroying 1400€ Phone
Break S Pen like a Munch! Dayum. :') I want to be this rich.
OMG YOU ARE RUINING THE US DOLLAR 1000+ PHONE THAT I CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY RIGHT NOW.WHAT A WASTED.
Elon's supposed to be announcing the Tesla Pi phone on Feb. 19
Who is waiting for iphone 14 pro max
On this video about this Samsung s23 I got a advertisement for a Samsung s23, already with a big discount on it.
OnePlus 11 pls 😂😂
Why are you destory phone i wish i have one 😭
Tesla does with cars ? Upgrading software and pushing people to pay for it, but the same car? I don't see any difference
How do you scratch this beauty like that!!!!?
Is anyone actually paying full msrp for this phone? I mean, my phones 3 yrs old and with trade in I got the s23 for under $300.
How can one watch the destruction of a brand new device? Anyway, you haven't done a drop test. Would like to know if the new Glass is really that good.
do not do this to these phones, you may send it to me ig....
I think that we need to add a graduating scale impact test (kind of like the mohs picks, but for impacts) for the front and back glass panels to the durability videos. It would be nice to see how much they can handle before failure.
The Left is from S23 Ultra looks more natural the right one is slightly saturated than it needs to
I wanted to keep my Samsung Note 10, which was perfect for my needs except that I would've preferred a smaller size, for longer but the proximity sensor on it stopped working causing the screen not to turn off when I'm on a call, so I replaced it. Incidentally, is your proximity sensor still working? Asking just in the (very) off chance you read this comment, lol.
You should giveaway these phones 😂😂💗👍
its satisfying and disturbing at the same time to watch this man destroy these high end phones......but on another note, i DO NOT upgrade every year, im still using my iphone 12 pro max.
Can I buy D brand cases in India??
Use more strength bruh
Zack:Probably My favourite part of the Ultra lineup.(S pen) *Also breaks it afterwards.
Bro you always forget the vivo flagships
Debrand looks cool and stuff but 40 bucks... nah
Damn painfull to watch on my s7.
that hurts man
I have a Note20 Ultra and besides the 200 MPixel camera (mine has a 108 MPixel) the thing is basically the same with a relatively small uptick in CPU.   And my phone came out in August 2020. Like, what has Samsung done? Even their folding phones are stagnant while that company you mentioned a few days ago innovated a whole new cheaper hinge.
Thanks for your comparisons to the Note 10+; it's the same phone I'm updating from. My reasons are the 5G, better OS/camera/hardware features.
Samsung advertisement it is!
"S-Pen can be used for a lot of things"  **breaks the pen**
Me when looking every single video from jerry😎😎"woww that's cool" until tears come out... 😭😭
Been watching since the Xiaomi note 5 dropped it was my First phone , now after years i've still have a xiaomi phone (xiaomi 11T) and i'm only convinced of the android flagships in General
What is so dumb is they could innovate by just doing what they did before - add an SD card slot, headphone jack, maybe even removable battery while staying waterproof like some of the earlier S series were.
hahahahahahaha
What is the life expectancy of the Galaxy S23 Ultra after the scratch and burnt test? 🔥🥵
waiting Durability Test for oneplus 11 :D
It hurts so bad to watch this 😢
Useless describe👎👎👎
they failed with the colors again... is that even green?
Agree with your mom
Please upload video for oneplus 11
I'm still with my note 10+
I still rock my Huawei Mate 10 Pro for 6 years still going strong no issues.. before all the global bans took place... Why upgrade when all you need is a decent processor and screen and all the apps you can download?
I can hear the S23 ultra crying for mercy
I upgraded my Note10+ to this, and agree with you, there was not a great reason to upgrade, yet.  Mainly the Note10+ battery was starting to have reduced capacity.  My main incentive to upgrade was the Note10+ is getting no more upgrades, and my service provider was ripping me off blind after I had paid off the Note10 (and the upgraded plan to get the S23ultra meant only paying $15 per month more than I was before) . I could have traded in the Note10 but didn't want to in case I had any issues with the S23U, given the Note10 in my opinion is still very capable (albeit lighter with smaller battery than the S23u).
Thanks for video, I like that is not just a test, also thoughts about innovations on phones and uprgading every year
Give me please if you not interested 😢
Jerry what is with the Casio watch
A 200 megapixel camera is innovation. And if buy a 10 year old android before touching an apple. So any new android is innovative enough for me when in comparison to the scum bag practices apple perpetuates

Hey Jerry, You did only iPhone 14 durability test what about pro models, and now you are duing only s23 ultra what about s23 ??
i got adblocker
After 1.5 years of watching JerryRigEverthing, I got sensitive teeth...
I've never had a better phone than my LG G6, or whichever one had the magazine style battery. Modular upgradable phones will always be more environmentally friendly. I'd still be rocking it to this day if I didn't break it from a drop. That's when I started using cases. Only down side to headphone jack, when a wasp flies in your face you accidentally rip your phone off a table.
If Samsung really wanted to be eco friendly then they could have skipped s23 altogether as it’s exactly same as previous model.
Plz give me this phone
Breaking this phone broke my heart 💔
Actually upgrading to the ultra from my note 10 plus. I kinda want this new camera. But my old phone always passes to the wife anyways lol.
Sir if you have all done with samsung galaxy 23 ultra So can you please give me  I'm Munish and want to become a photographer with samsung mobile you can change my life please 🥺❤️
What a torture 😫
No, I haven't got a SAMSUNG ad. Here in Bangladesh, their online marketing isn't that strong because most people can't afford to spend this much (add ridiculous vat & taxes on top of already horrible pricing)
Did get a Samsung advertisement
Companies are sending their smartphones for teardown and we are purchasing them for protect Isn't funny🤣
Nah, Zack. The picture from the S23 is much better and clearer. Time for a new phone, sir! 😂
2:17 the right one is S23Ultra, isn't it?
Where is the picture of the moon taken with this phone???
Can you "review l" the new samsung laptops as well
re durability what about mrwhosetheboss video on his battery swelling, that only happened with samsung phones?
my 20 ultra is perfect minus 1 crack in the screen and what seems like a slightly tired battery... only reason i pre-ordered the 23 ultra was because 40% off and free 128gb to 256gb storage upgrade.... i also know the 23 will take me into 2027 with no problems
The left is so funny, you think you are cool for "not being manipulated by a multimillionarie company to have the lastest device because your 3y/o phone is working still fine" then you proceed to damage the newest phone lol that's ridiculous. You are not upgrading your phone because its as good as the lastest versions, you are not upgrading it because you think you are beating the capitalism system by not owning the lastest  device but in the other hand you keep buying the lastest tech to waste it. You know your 3y/o phone is pretty much shit compared to the newest S23 Ultra, you are a tech guy and you mshould know its worth the upgrade, unless you only use your phone to scroll on instagram and read books. Doing stupid comparisions on the selfie camera on the best light conditions possible, obviously the difference will be minimal, even a 200$ phone can achieve that.
dBrand is spending lots of marketing dollars on you, but still offers same protection as other brands.
Finally upgraded from the LG V40 that I'd been using for over three years because the screen was starting to crap out on me. Picked up a refurbished Galaxy S21+ for less than half the price of what the phone cost new. Hope I can get another three years from this "new" phone.
What about the screen scratch test?
Since when does a durability test not also include a drop test and waterproofing test?
Jerry kindly it is long time we are just hearing Glass is Glass, if possible I would like to see a comparison between how corning gorilla glass every year has changed, basically because I think from the very fast all phones front screen is getting scratches at level 6 with no changes at all. If not the scratch resistance has improved then why are they claiming it is improving each year now Gorilla Glass Victus 2. What are the development points they had achieved by now as you have seen and tested may smartphones already.   My Note 20 Ultra back glass shattered at first drop from my standing points to tiles floor at around 3ft from ground, sorry but probably a modern way of faking a noticeable change.
5:20 as long as mine supports the current os then i aint buying a new phone
If you want a good case buy a Spigen. Made in south korea.
Sir can you give me this phone please
You missed a few of Bidens tweets quick go like them before anyone else does.
That S pen just broke is such little force, weak crap
🥲🥲🥲🥲
I upgraded for the camera, inwanted to see what that 200mp was about, getting it for free, so hard to say no.
This is the best video yet in my opinion. I love the way you teach us stuff. For the past year i watched every video but never really for the durability tests, i always learn something new
My last Samsung was the note 7 that lasted only 2 weeks😂😂😂. But decided to upgrade to s23 ultra from iPhone 12 Pro Max bc I’m having sound issues and battery drain is horrible.  Let’s just say I won’t be buying an apple product for a while now.
First Samsung was S20+, was great until their update bricked it.  Then they refused to warranty after it was 6m old.  Had to sue to get a refund.  Won't buy Samsung again.
I love how confident Jerry pull out the phone using his penknife.  Gold!
Buy this phone this year for full price or next year for half price 😅
The best way for these companies to go green would be to tell the network providers to stop controlling the phones so much and allow for easy rooting. This way when the phone makers decide to stop updating the software, the mod communities can easily step in to provide a few more years beyond "end of life". I'd have upgraded my LG V20 long ago if it weren't somewhat up to date with software from the modders porting newer software. Although the rooting process was far from easy on this phone, it was well worth it to me. The phone runs much smoother than it ever did with all the bloatware and unnecessary crap running in the background, and I have much more control to make it function how it suits me.
Eco slave cobalt
Want oneplus 11 durability test 😁
Not counting the money in your pockets but I gotta assume you make AT LEAST $1200+ from these videos to do what you do to these devices.  My goodness!
I wish manufacturers would do more to innovate with features. I'm still rocking my S10+ that I preordered and looking to upgrade soon because it's been giving me issues with GPS, Connectivity (both WiFI and 4G), and tragically a cracked screen after dropping a pyrex container on it late last year, even after all of that I'm still on the fence about upgrading.
the watch gave it away. Right one was new, left old :D
I did not I have premium
I'm still using 2017 phone for my daily use With little bit knowledge on rom flashing I'm able to upgrade my 6 years old phone to the latest Android 13
can i have the damaged phone please?
i have to wait 3 years more to have s23😁
Someone ask me who is Jerry. Hahahaha😊
2:17 the one on the left is the S23 ultra
A hole punch camera on the top end effping phone I can buy get out of here
Both selfies are highly disturbing but I get your point lol
Well done :)
Well, I can put it this way:  No matter how you look at it this phone is a marvel of quality manufacturing and engineering and innovation is a bit more skin deep that trying to burn the screen that is the same as last year's or destroying the case. Yes indeed it looks pretty much the same as it did in all previous 5 years.. but unlike Apple that does the same and sells you basically the same s..t every year, there is a level or refinement all around that is very hard to beat and match by just about anyone else. And is hard to dismiss its put together to become currently the fasted Android phone available and that the new camera tech alone pushes boundaries of what would be unimaginable just a couple years ago and is arguably years ahead of just about everyone else.. definitely 10 or more years ahead of Apple's BS overhyped cameras that make me wanna puke. Sure its plain and boring, expensive and bland, easy to break and prone to scratches.. but so is my girlfriend that takes no pictures, easily overheats, is a downgrade year on year and costs me more than double per month than the single price of this phone that can last me several years of easy enjoyment rather than almost daily heavy bad hair and hormonal bad mood swings.
I paid $400 to upgrade to it...
I want
This gave me anxiety especially when you snapped the pen but it was interesting to see what is inside
No good video
Dang Zack is on point with tearing Samsung apart.
love the f91w
I got my Samsung galaxy s9 plus brand new on release 2018 and I still haven't upgraded its slow and dies fast now it was really good at first but I think I'm gonna upgraded soon
Still waiting for your teardown skin for S23 Ultra before I order the grip case from dbrand 😁
Nooooo
Did Zack just refer to himself as Jerry in the third person?
Love your videos and how you're spreading the idea of being as green as you can.. but but the funny part you create E-waste for living... Well to keep others from buying E-waste
Im with Zac, no real reason to upgrade, but i was a dumbass and went swimming with my phone in saltwater ahaha so its lifespan will be cut short, atm its all good but time will tell if the salt kills it
2 things you scratched to front camera glass at 1:52 and you can deffinitly see a difference between the s10 or note 10 and the s22 ultra front camera picture quality
I'm still using my S8+ after almost 6 years. Maybe now it's time to change it, because the S23 Ultra looks like it has everything.
Galaxy it's the most overrated brand in the android world
Hey Jerry, fellow Note 10+ user here, when are we going to upgrade? Waiting for your next daily! Ps no samsung ad, youtube premium ftw
man the scratches sound is really...
Nice one, like the burning was a whole minute or 7 :). About the Eco stuff. You are absolutely correct. Recycling is great, but using something for a second time or prolong the usage time is far more eco friendly then recycling.  But now if you look with Apple's eyes, actually Samsung is really Eco friendly.  First you remove the headphone jack. It is eco friendly as you do not have to put headphones in the box. Also it's eco friendly as you have to sell $200 wireless headphones from now on. And they are so Eco friendly with their batteries that last like every other battery - around 2 years. And when you lose one you will have to get a brand new pair for.... $200.  Secondly you remove the chargers from the box. As every client of yours is so addicted to your phones that they get them every year. Yea if only that ware true. Even your polls show that 3-4 years is the norm for a new phone and in that time a charging brick is done. So you need a charger. Also if you sell your device or give it to a child or other relative - they pretty much need a charger and you are left with none. But as you give slow charges in the box, because you are a cheap, what's the point.  Third - promoting Wireless charging. Yea that's efficient as well! Pure lie. It uses more power, even with the magnet alignment. And multiply that by 3-4 or even 5 Billion devices, the number is quite scary. Pretty Eco friendly design. Also the materials to implement that type of charging in the phone and chargers as well, are using more resources and this is not Eco friendly. Also generating more heat because of the induction. Yea - that is one of the reasons why it's not fast, as if it was it might degrade the battery or even light it on fire.  Fourth - reparability. This is the most Eco Friendly of them all. - Make the phone as much non repairable as possible. Battery replacement, screen replacement, camera, you name it. That will save the planet. Blame it on the security and exploding batteries when repairing. Even with swapped parts from one phone to another.  Blame that on the repair service stations that have saved millions even billions of devices from the dumpsters. That have saved peoples precious data. Then put an inductive Wireless charging above the battery that will generate more heat then regular charging, blame that on Michael Faraday.   Fifth - make the new software more demanding on the phone thus pretty much requiring a new phone every couple of years as the old one will be a bit slower with every update. Blame that on.... who cares, just blame it on the sharks that are eating your salary bonus.
Apple: “Don’t Blame Us” it’s they who copied it(other OEMs)😅
I NEED A SD CARD SLOT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Man Zack takes me back to my childhood days of tearing down toys and putting them through the worst just to see what they made of...always interesting to bring out the kid in me in more evolved manner. Awesome stuff, Zack
Just got my S23 Ultra as an upgrade for my older S10 and definitely feels like an update. Though I'm not used to the heavier weight and bigger screen as of yet.
I'm a tech junkie... I upgrade my laptop every year and my phone as well... I'm sorry...
I’m upgrading from galaxy S 7 att say it gives 1000$😂 trade in
😲 😱 heat part incredible now i m switching 22 to 23 now
A truly pointless exercise destroying a perfectly good phone.
Can I have the S23 ?
S23 😮
because of you jerry i buy the note10 + but now the only issu i have is the bass speaker broke i dont know how .. but i buy the part and will do the repair .. only 15$ repair vs new phone .. thx again for all you do !!
No samsung ad on this video.....thanks YT premium
I'm still using my S10+  I still don't feel the need to upgrade yet. Keep up the  good work on the videos.
What exactly are we meant to have learnt from this video?
HE IS TH3 REASON WHY COMPANIES ACTUCLLY SCARDE
You said Samsung hasn’t given you a reason to upgrade but they got your money bud.
When the US govt purposely destroy other competitions in the markets, this is what happens to other brands (like Samsung & Apple) didn't get sanctioned, they sit there too comfortably being a monopoly without further innovations while putting out insane price tags.
With all of these phones you get, you might as well just upgrade your old phone… it’s not like it’s gonna be a hassle to do so
Upgrading to this from the s7 which ive had for 7 years. Only way i can justify spending what phones cost these days
I watched it on my s23 ultra and first time when your were scratching or bending it i got worry like you are doing it on my phone and when it got end I tool and deep breath and got happy that ended finally I think it was they only phone whats Still Can be In use after facing you🙂
time to change the design to flat screen with 90 degree sides and an underdisplay cam
Why don't you have a standardized screen damage where some motor with incremental power hits the screen so we can see when it actually gets to a breaking point. Shouldn't be hard to do and by the end the phone is ruined enough, might as well squeeze some extra knowledge on it to compare future phones on.
I wonder what Apple does to brain wash 🤔
Dude keeps scraping the body and my ears start bleeding from the inside
Yeah got s23 Ad. In this video
I just upgraded my s20 FE to the s23 ultra. Planned on waiting for the s24 but I got a free upgrade. I would never pay $1200 for a phone.
I would like for people who criticize phone companies about innovation to offer what more they would like in today's phones.
On average, phones can last 4-5 years. If manufacturers can increase this to 10 years, they really contribute to nature. Many users do not care about the update of the operating system or game performance. What they want is durable phones. Other brands, especially Chinese brands, except Samsung and Apple, have turned the world into a garbage dump.
epic criticism 😂 But I felt sorry for the S Pen
I have  a note 10+ as well. Until samsung sends dirty update we are all good, guys. It is performing very well
Taking a razor blade to a new phone proves nothing. Stupid.
Please  test one plus 11 please..
This guy knows how to destroy a device. Bloody hell.
Can you give me that phone plz
Even my ex left me after all these years but scratches at level 6 and deeper grooves at level 7 remained constant
Test honor x9a 🙏
Next one oneplus 11 please.
Hello 911, I’d like to remote a murder…😅
Mine S23 Ultra even with lot of scratches 🙏
I want "Use it up. Wear it out. Make it do or do without" printed on a hennep hoodie ASAP!
I byed iPhone 12 pro Max since release 2020 and it still One of the best phones i have ever had, its very very very durable and i won’t by another phone until 15 years
This doesn't make any sense. There is nothing in this world which is indestructible. It's just waste of time and money.
First, you're wrong about the specs. Almost everything is changed, although the specs of the parts seems the same.   Secondly, those sort of reviews and durability tests aren't green either. The phone can't be sold anymore, so it's a waste. And YouTube (google) is one of the bigger polluters in the world.    Every luxury product isn't green. So don't let us be hypocrite and just say we want this luxury life, but we try to minimize the pollution.
So as per Jerry's analysis; it is not worth buying Galaxy S23 ultra now. No innovation.
2:19 right its super clear
Yeah, pay $1.5K for a phone and wrap it into ugly piece of rubber
The way Jerry scratched the phone with a knife made me feel so so sorry for the phone.........
OnePlus 11 durability test please
I'm still rocking my Note 9 from the good ole days before they started removing features. I see no reason to upgrade yet.
Could you disassemble this phone please? :)
Watching your vidoeos for the first time atm. And IT HURTS seeing what you do to the phones
No matter by which perspective I see it, I only feel damage in my heart after seeing  the damage to the phone!!
advice from your mom is fantastic (5:17 onwards) 🙏
they even copy apples box............. LMAO
The camera and better processor and reception is why I got it
Mine comes tomorrow hope it's worth it
3:19 The S-pen is useful for a lot of things *Immediately breaks it*
The eco friendly stuff is all nonsense and done for profits, no their reason,  No charger means you get two packs, 2 deliveries erc.  How's that good?  These companies now manipulate their customers.  You know the worst thing this year, prices offered for trade in.  Can get more recycling it on line than what Samsung offers, let alone on eBay etc.  Poor.
Selfie on the left is much better
still waiting for your next dropping test :D
My galaxy s8 is still going very strong
Zach, thank you for reminding the people it's still much more environmentally friendly to keep using something for a longer time than it is to buy something which contains green buzzwords. Also loving you giving samsung the burn for their greenwashing. More companies, especially car companies, should be publicly called out on greenwashing.
i love watching things that i can't afford.♥️
the way he broke the s pen 🤣
May someone answer to me. Why on PBK reviews S23 ultra scratches at level 8 with deepper grooves at level 9 but on JRE channel same phone scratches at level 6 with deeper grooves at level 7??? 🤔
Still using an S6 with no issue! xD
Next tear down.
Finally jerrybro bring S23 ultra durability test.
I was thinking what if I forgot to keep s-pen inside phone and sleep on it over night, what would happen, now I know, Thanks Jerry.
The biggest "innovation" is that here in EU we finally get the qualcom chip. Plus battery life is very good now... enough for me to upgrade from the regular note 10 with exinos.
At least the Samsung (like all Android phones) has a USB type C. I wonder if they use easy-to-remove "glue" for the batteries this time.
I ended up buying the phone but that's because I broke my s20 ultra 😂 it's a solid device. I've recommended for people coming from the s20 although my s20 was working fine until I broke it 😂
Can i get the phone when you are done tearing it apart
You should add water-related test, that could be anything. It'll be fun.
casio f91. con đồng hồ ước mơ của bao em học sinh việt nam
a clear samsung hater iphone fan boy, the whole video you just slagged samsung off, does elon use a samsung
Ofcourse i did, get an add, for the exacyphine which i thought was funny :)
i am very impressed on the lighting , i was nervous but it turned out very well
Dbrand doesn't have a Note 10+ case anymore on there website.
Great build quality, as it should be. I don't get ads; I have YouTube premium. TYVM
I like to see this durability breakdown with your Rivian Truck.
😌👆🏼 I'm still using my s9plus
I'm currently waiting for my pre ordered s23 ultra upgrading from my Note 9. And watching this hurts in ways I can't explain
I was waiting to see that 200mp *2 shift sensor
Oh note 10 plus is so beautiful. This is the most beautiful phone Samsung have ever produced
قلبى بيتقطع يا جدعان 🤣😅🤣🤣🤣 حرام
Oneplus 11 please
This video "actually" hurts to watch but, i needed to see it through my boi 😅👍
the burn test duration is actually 7mnt45s...
ഒരു കുലുക്കവും ഇല്ല 🔥😼
Something tells me you are angry with Samsung 😆 must be my imagination
HONOR X9a! HONOR X9a!  HONOR X9a! HONOR X9a!  HONOR X9a! HONOR X9a! PLS
Bruh... you can't talk about being manipulated by samsung when you actually believe Musk's promises lol
Jerry: Scratching S23 ultra.  Me: Using Lg g8x and thinking " Throw it to me...Throw it to me "😅
WHYYY
I am using s22 ultra and it's really a tough phone. Even after dropping from my bike at 90kmph nothing happened to the phone or to the screen. But i feel like it's slowing down and I am not sure why.
I wonder how well recycled those grip cases are and Enviromental friendly?
This guy has legit something against Samsung. He is trying to criticize the phone with the recycled glass and acting like he is any better. He smashes every new phone that comes out and thinks he can talk about Samsung not using that many recycled materials. Judging the camera with one picture and expecting us to know which one is which? Using the phone for 10 minuts and saying there is no difference? Would you guys really take this guys words!?
"Favorite ultra series feature"  It makes me sad, that the best feature from Note is now remembered as a ultra feature.
Mine will be arriving in 3 days, and will be a definite upgrade from my note 6+ that i have been using  since it launched. I am interrested in seeing decent images, and an actual battery life.
I try to keep a phone for at least 3 years before upgrading, this time I plan to keep my Pixel 6 pro for 4-5 years. I still have my LG G7 thinQ that I use every day at home for wifi calling and surfing the web. It still runs like it's new and I'm going to see just how long it will live.
I keep my S22U DS 12/512 💚
Yes there was samsung ad
Yup. Got a Samsung ad at the start of the video.
Got a 1+ advrt 😂
This video is tearing Samsung apart, the next video is taking Samsung apart. - 🤣🤣 I lost there at the END!
You know what's crazy? I just pre ordered this s23 ultra and I actually contemplated if I should have waited another year or not. My current phone is the s8+ and has been for 6 years.
Yet another great video. Thank you Zack.
Scratching the shit out of it is called "durability test"? Even God-made phone will not passe your "durability" test.
Won't be surprised if D-brand comes out with a line of condoms! Lol
Use it up, wear it out, make it do, do it out! Pretty catchy!
Casio A158W nice
Trading my z fold 4 for this, folding phone not really for me lol.
On screen heat test  s23: hold my 6.8" led 🐯
Almost on year 5 with my galaxy s9+. Replaced the battery once. But since the security updates stopped in march 2022 its is time to upgrade this year. Probably wil upgrade to the s23 ultra when it drops a little in price, hope i wil get another 5 years with that phone.
I wish samsung would send me a free phone that I won't destroy
5:30 do you say this when apple does this for years? No of course not, noone does
There is no way he just said "Besides that model that exploded" and the explosion video popped up in the corner.. there aren't enough firefighters to stop the burn for Samsung in this video
The picture on the left looks like the newer phone. I'm a Note lover and have had them all but the 4.
Who doesn't feel poor when seeing someone destroy $1200 phone
What a waste of phone hahahha
Please wear safety hand glovers next time 😇
There you go agin So satisfaction to watch  New meaning of teardown  No tears down You know what i mean
Green movement is a scam!  This soy boy is part of it for pushing it.
Can you please send any phone you scratched i don't have any one my own
Had you told be about the term ‘greenwashing’ a few months ago, I would’ve passed my exam. Not cool Zack!
Can we talk about Samsung getting rid of the SD card slot?  One of the reasons I won't upgrade.
Great video  though
My heart is painful  💔 seeing  an s23 ultra being  destroyed
I upgraded from the 10 plus to this phone. Had it for 2 days now. Bought it for the camera alone and I’m not disappointed. The pix are much better, particularly in a dark setting. As someone who takes multiple pix daily for my art work, the camera is key and worth the investment. And for the record my 10 plus was pretty darn tough. That phone was dropped more times than it should have been. The front glass never broke though the corners of the back glass are cracked. I’m glad they got rid of the back glass. This is my fourth in the note line. They are the best phones going. Worth every penny. Well ok maybe they could be cheaper.
Damn my heart aches with each damage 😭😭😭
Nice video!👍
Don't Damage it give me to me please 😢😢😢
This video hurts my ego. That's a $1200 plus device. People are practically getting away with bragging while in possession of it. I have just watched a video of the device's cameras zooming into the moon. Now that feature has been rubbished by this video.
"The S Pen is useful for a lot of things" *snaps it* XD
U broke My heart with scratch on this expensive phone that i can't buy 😒
I switched from Note8 to S22U last year, and as I am amazed by Samsung's performance and camera, I don't need to switch to S23U, and I don't see why people are interested in iphones, they don't chamge at all, they are boring, backwarded and outdated.
For me, the best offering from Samsung is s23 rather than s23 ultra. I really appreciate that form factor.
I didnt upgrade my note 9 till recently because the screen was cracked and had pieces of glass missing and lines on the display and still working but it started to finally fail on sustaining a call longer than 10mins or data and it also was slowing down to a point it became a whole minute to 5 to reload the home screen at times and surviving longer than 2-4 hours without a charge, so I said screw it, I'll upgrade to a note 20 ultra and I'm happy with it and won't upgrade till another like 4 or so years
Need OnePlus 11 Test, I've been waiting for that too long.
He is here to roast samsung i love you jerry <3
Why bro why🥹🥹
I think its time to upgrade from S8+ now!!😅
Treating spen as bread stick
OnePlus 11 durability test please.
😎🇧🇩
this is sooo satisfying to watch and jerry voice too is calming...
Me when he out of nowhere just SNAPPED the S-Pen 👁👄👁
Quiet educative and painful 😣 at the same time watching Zack ,crush these flagships and I can't even afford one🥺
I got no ads, YT premium baby, I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. No ads! Not going back.
Any well wisher to send me a phone they are not using please I will appreciate ya boy is broke can't make videos my phone is acting up.
You guys have to remember these are not real dropping phone off bed situations this is pushing it to the max
Gift me a phone lol🤭🤭
It hurts seeing good phones, I could never get my hands on being destroyed straight out of the box, but it's fun seeing how new phones handle
Zack, this was an amazing durability test for the s23 Ultra, but what about Huawei Mate 50 Pro durability test?
I like your watch! I have the same one these are cheap and well made!
Just clicked here to dislike it
Apa ni bobo yi sha
My eyes are burning:)
I'm not paying 1500£ for a phone made from recicled parts. If you charge 1500£ you better make your product from brand new materials.
Pls make a video on oneplus 11
you should add some drop test for durability
Point about Samsung wanting us to buy new phone every year. Ever since I have upgraded my S20 Ultra to Android 13, battery life had a massive drop. There are also performance annoyances like apps being less responsive. This phone is not even my daily driver and I have capped charging percentage to 85% since day one so battery wear is minimal.  Then I bought the S22 Ultra 1 month before release of S23 Ultra, for urgent purposes. After using it for a week I decided to do software updates and BAM; battery life issues. They are really downgrading their older phones, to force us buy new ones.
dang the S23 Ultra really held up from the bend test really well.
how about iphone 14 pro max?
1. No Samsung ad. 2. Sponsorblock. 3. dbrand grip cases aren't structurally rigid. There is a groove in the inside edge that can pry apart from the case. Broke in 2 months from my Note 9.
I have my s23 ultra 1tb ordered, it is good to see multiple color options on the Ultra being a thing. My S21 ultra only came in black and it sucked.. Ill get the teardown skin from D-brand, I had that on my s21 ultra too. Love the look.
Great content
Damn, Samsung's is different breed
I got the samsung ad you were asking abour jerry🤣
just upgrade to one of these, after 4 years with my note 9
Going green yet removing accessories has to be the dumbest move. And instead of forcing all phones to go type-c charging. They should be forcing them to put in accessories, yes force!   If anyone should pay 1200 for a phone, it should have tons of accessories with free gifts inclusive, but they taking em out so people have to source them separately. AND NO ONE IS SAYING ANYTHING 😪.Reason I will just stick to 1+
если бы ты так переживал за природу то не ломал бы продукты которые создавались с недостаточным количеством переработанных материалов. Ты либо глупый либо лицемер.
WHY INFINITY CURVED SCREEN AGAIN??? WHY SAMMY ?
No matter how much these companies use recycled parts and components and adopt green initiatives, they are still not enough to convince me that they removed chargers from boxes for the sake of their profits and not for the environment.
The selfie on the left is from note 10, I guess 🤨
left s23 ultra pic
Please Xiaomi 13
I love this guy, I'm glad to see him again 👍
I was, waiting for this 🔥🔥🔥
Sell me this phone by 1 dollar
I'm upgrading from an S20 FE for a S23U, at first was a little disappointed at the green being so dull but then remembered I'm putting the damn thing in a case and the exterior color doesn't matter.
i dont get ads coz i use ad block lol
"100% recycled cardboard box…" proceeds to, still, put pointless plastic peels on the phone, while could just wrap the whole device in a paper material like MacBooks and such
That's torture
Love the honesty too many people are praising samsung for this  phone
I missed your survey  but im one of the small percentage that gets a new one each year.   I pre-ordered the 1TB $1600 23 Ultra within 10 min of it being available.
The idea of taking pictures of the moon is false. I am not a "rocket surgeon" either but something that small it's impossible to capture something that far 384400 meters away from the earth to be exact. Bigger telescopes took time to get the job done. Samsung phones just have a preloaded image I think using some software to collectively put the image together and  make it more real. Otherwise I don't buy it.
Me watching this on my S22 Ultra like "hmmm yes. Samsung is doing the Apple."
I noticed, this victus held up heat quite nicely
Not expected s-pen to be too fragile.
Nobody cares about healthy dyes.. Not when the unit costs over 1k..
That's the thing, I was waiting for 😆
We know how environmentally friendly a company can be, which sells bomb to its customers even after complaining for months
You break my heart like every time.  🇧🇩❤️‍🩹
Sir Please Test OnePlus 11 Next ✅

Samsung has perfected the smartphone hardware. Now Google needs to perfect their smartphone hardware and software to make the best phone ever.
Yes I did indeed get a Samsung ad on this video
Please do the OnePlus 11 next! 🙏
I'm upgrading from the S20 Ultra. The reasons are my phone is broken, autofocus isn't that good, and it's still pretty grainy at night. The lights cause huge glares. And most of the zoom is digital. 10x optical zoom is a huge upgrade. Along with a 200MP camera. And I got the 512gb version, my current phone is only 128gb  OMFG I just realized that I won't be able to put my SD in it. I don't know what I'm going to do 😭  Got it and I love it. Apparently all my files were saved on my Google account so I don't even need the SD card anymore
Man Zack takes me back to my childhood days of tearing down toys and putting them through the worst just to see what they made of...always interesting to bring out the kid in me in more evolved manner. Awesome stuff, Zack
3 years is the ideal time between phones imo
Mmmm yer I think I might hold on to my s21 ultra a bit longer
jerry
Do oneplus 11 durarablity test
Is that dbrand case is available for India?
5:55 Got a OnePlus 11 ad tho 😂
"Can you send me that" is the most cringiest ad ever. And yes that played b4 this video ofc
Rich talking about samsung not innovating when they are making millions of various phones every year, while apple only makes like 1 slightly changed phone every year.
Loooool “buy it this year for full price, or next year for half the price” killed me 😂😂
I could definitely tell the difference in selfie photos lol 😆 and hot damn (pun intended) the screen held up against the lighter Screen 1 lighter 0 🤣
YouTube premium, otherwise i should get a Samsung ad
Haha not to mention 3yrs, I've been using my Redmi Note 8pro 2019 version and it still holds up perfectly fine , depends on the user i guess..
Its victus glass 2, last year was victus plus. Also the camera rings are a bit diff than last year.
I'm still using my poco f1, still to this day, changed battery once
This is just a side note. Just want to mention again your expert view on why Phones in storage can get bloated battery. Reason I mentioned this is if anyone still remember another popular youtuber reported his Samsung phones in storage boated issue a while back.  Everyone was talking about it, there were more questions and arguments than anything else then Zack lit up the whole room with his explanation why phones in storage gets their battery bloated. Lol
Nice casio f-91
i want OnePlus 11 iqoo 11
Me hubiera gustado tambien ver qué tan resistente es a las caídas, te faltó tirarlo de al menos un metro de altura y también probar la resistencia de la bandeja SIM es muy débil en los móviles Samsung si los doblas un poco se parten...saludos nuevo suscriptor
You are fu..king new phone 😡😡😡😡
Cool video as always, never been disapointed from your videos.
Hate you are opening the one to destroy it. 😢😢😢😢😢
Excellent play with words there mate!!!
haven't updated since the OnePlus 6, waiting for a durability test on the OnePlus 11, the 10 Pro and 10T was an utter disappointment
i have note 9 and i think its time for upgrading :D
With the deal from Verizon, I'll pay much less than half price through pre-order.
I have this phone and its garbage, really wish i stuck to iphone like i had done the past 8 years
I wish samsung watched this video and start spending more on innovation department and less on the advertising department
Yes the s23 advertise before your video and im still on the s10+ with one battery replacement still living in bliss with my sd card and my headphone jack.
Lol everything is recycled then why is it so expensive? Also I couldn't care less about climate or whatever. Such a first world problem.
Tesla lmao. Wht a waste
This might've been your most poetic video yet. Love it. 😆
Still wondering how often you get called Jerry...
My S23 Ultra started to sweat when I clicked on this video ^^ hopefully will last for the next 4+ years!
Tesla is getting free marketing thanks to Elon Musk.
We care for the environment just released another zillion phones that are 90% the same as last year
Funny that the Note 10 plus did a better selfie (the photo on the left)
Year after year samsung and I phone  are same shiiiiiiiitttttt  nothing different just wasting money
Not all heroes wear capes. Cheers.
So I bought the  S23U watching the video and up on the YT mainpage is S23 ad clip and if I scroll a bit there is S23/+/U buy-banner 🤣🤣😂
Everyone said  Apple doesn’t innovate  It’s all the same every year   It’s kinda true   So do Samsung  It’s been the same thing this last years
bro u r such a merciless person, i’ve been planning to buy this beautiful device and u peeled it like veggies with ur blade 😭😭😭😭
Do OnePlus 11
You lost me with the environment lesson - stick to the fucking point.
Zack is becoming boring, maybe stick to the job at hand which is disassemble and explore instead of pushing your influencer political views, if it wasn't for these companies you wouldn't have your many $ millions and all the luxuries you have been afforded by assessing their products.
Still way better than an iPhone
Difficult to watch, it honestly hurts.
Bullshit mate. Has the snap dragon new processor and now every Samsung  phone has it now. It has the newer gorilla glass, so  not the same as the S22. its 35% faster than the S22, does 8k better.  The speed boost alone makes it worth the upgrade. Normally it would not, but performance is quite a bit faster then the S22 And even the S21.  It also have memory that's 2x faster than the S21, so another boost here.  Normally I don't upgrade in 3 or 4 years, but I have the s21 and updating as the performance even over the s22 is quite a jump. Yearly Normally yearly upgrading is pointless,  but the S23 has a big enough jump in performance to justify this upgrade
Upgrading every year is my hobby. Will not stop. I couldn't care less about the environment. Jerry wouldn't have a job without a new phone launch every other week. Boring hypocrite.
i got the s23+ and i like it alot my prevouse phone was a oneplus9 the only gripe i have with my new samsung is the slow fast charging....it takes like 5 hours to go from 1% too 100% while my old phone did the same in 30min....
only degenerate people upgrade phones every 6month or 1 year
I have been saving for 2 years to buy this phone and I'm even close to it , And Jerry is destroying it 😂.
Why so gringos enjoy breaking stuff so much... I will never understand you people 🤣
Yeah I agree with the hole upgrading things. I used to upgrade about every six months to a year back when a new phone actually meant something. I have the s22 ultra and this phone not only looks identical to my phone, but is only slightly changed internally (slightly faster chip, and slightly improved camera)
3:41 Drop it like it's hot
Damn, it hurts :)
1.100$ in US in Europe 1.900€
Cheap in USA because 4% inflation expensive in europe because 11% inflation
These videos are so painful to watch. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan.  But it can be hard to watch!
I can see tremendous difference in the selfie picture test you did, you look like a different person almost. Much better detail on the S23 IMO.
No scratch test, strange
i hate the scratching sound it makes when scratching the sides of the phone 😬
S22 Ultra picture on the left
Useless videos, negativity into your life.
The problem nowadays is that the phones cost more than a car!.... Thank you for your work! Please make an Xperia 1 mark 4 and a Xperia 5 mark 5 durability/tear down test!
I did get an advertisement of the s23 ultra at the end 🤣
almost 3 yrs since ive had my note 10 plus as of 2020 august n its still going strong there is burn in from the screen due to ke using tiktok abit too much and me loosing my s pen but that doesnt give me a reason to upgrade so ima prob wait til the s24 or 25 ultra
I got an add for the s23 ultra right after the video. I know i definitely won't be upgrading anytime soon. That is unless my phone breaks
The S22 Ultra does a better job 😢
Yes, samsung add before video
Hey Zack, have you noticed any smell from the  S Pen? Mine smells like burning wire. I'm not sure if that is normal.. 🤔
I feel like the picture on the right is the one from the s23, u can see more details.
got an samsung ad😂😂😂
Samsung isn't getting enough credit for their foldables. Jerry was hating on them for basically being Apple and barely changing anything on the phones but that's because we are about as far as we can go on a glass slab. Samsung is innovating in the foldable space, which is a decade ahead of Apple
Nice video Mr , if you can check out the Honor x9a I've seen people breaking walnuts with that glass on the front glass , would like to know they are using 😁👍 , always dig the durability testing you do ✌️
You actually don't know what changed, they made huge steps with this generation. Focus on bending phone only.
Waiting for Oneplus 11 video
Right at the beginning samsung got me
Man, I almost felt guilty buying this device after this test! Then I remembered well you got it for about $200 after trading in my Galaxy S4 and switching carriers. I'm sure this will last long enough for me. The advertising didn't sell me, it was that I just needed a new phone.
Honestly it looks like Apple is doing more innovation at this rate lmao, I'm almost considering going iphone after my s22 goes through its 3-4 years, but that's still 2-3 years away so we'll see what samsung and apple does. Besides I'm still loving the s22 since the phone before it was an s9
As Zack snapped the sPen the galaxy s23 ultra started sweating
2:11 I'm admiring the casio, I got one and it's the most utilitarian watch ever, I love it lmao
I guess note 10 looks are way beyter than any other model
قلبي الصغير لا يحتمل 😢😢❤
This is a honest man!
So the largest producer of something reducing their usage by 10% and 22% isn't good enough cause the number isn't up to your liking? If some small start up was doing that it would make as-good-as no difference but Samsung produces MILLIONS of devices, which means that 22% and 10% is a huge number still. :/ What's Apple doing? Saving money on chargers? Incredible. Samsung? Get fucked?
Mr Jerry please bring back the drop test..🙏
I'm...A..Indian..117
Loved the grip case on my previous phone. But it's garbage on the fold 4.
Bro roasting samsung in and out💀
people are so annoying with this hippie recycle thing and the "climate change" 🤦🏻‍♂️
Just like that?? You broke the s pen😂😂😂
My guess is that the selfie on the left is S23. A couple of the last S phones had way too much postprocessing, turning any detail into mush. The eyebrows on the right have more detail.
The photo on the left looks better and I went back and checked the selfies being taken and it's from the old phone
I have a note 10plus  but upgrading to 23ultra only because my charge port is on its way out so syncing with dex is a issue and wired android auto and second is the fact i get ghost touches on my screen in one spot so i took the opertunity to get a good trade price dor my note to upgrade to this s23ultra if my phone was giving me issues i would still use it hopefully  @jerryrigeverything sees this  cant wait to see the tear down agent47
This video should be taken down, deleted and banned..   You're accusing Samsung of greenwashing, while you destroy a brand new phone.  That phone would have been a lot more useful in a regular consumers hands. In fact - i detest you for even doing these types of videos.  Wasting resources should be a massive no-no.
Is a phone a POS in your opinion if it can't stand up to a stick of TNT aswell ? Your tests and videos are ridiculously stupid.
Yeah....that's exactly what I'm concerned with...my phone being able to withstand an assault from a box cutter. !
Hello, Do you recommend me to buy lens protection 🤳?  Thank you 😊
Good job! I'm looking forward to the durability test of the new OnePlus 11 - it's so interesting, if they fixed an issue that was in OnePlus 10 Pro/10T.
love the Casio best watch ever
To be honset no ofense this vid is basicly no use.... tell me who the f gona do this with hes phone lol..... only is important for me the screen do i need a screen protector agains the scraches or not the res not because my phone all the time sit in a good case ...
Was considering a new samsung ..since i never had one ..but they only give you a good deal if trade one of their phones in ...well i guess they don't need any first time buyers at the prices they have .. they can keep them for it ..  Also see they have a one plus 11 out waiting for the test ... i didnt buy the 10 after the test last time /// thanks for the videos
I Hope someday Mr. Zack will give me one of the phone he  tested, even if, it has a lot of scratched, pls include your fingerprint using your scratching pen.😍.🥰
If I will be able to change my battery after it degrades over time, then I will do so. Too bad I cannot swap it with a higher capacity battery.
Got a samsung ad on this video, tho from a mobile network provider
I guess this is the only phone I have seen that didn't get any white screen when the screen was lit 🔥
Es increíble el precio que tienen estos dispositivos para la mala calidad que demuestran prácticamente desechable aunque reciste más que un iPhone 🤮
Just upgraded my galaxy s7 for a galaxy a53.. the s7 served me over 7 years.
I'm still rocking my note 9 but love to upgrade one day if I can ever afford to
This video is saltier than the Dead Sea (for a good reason). Coudln't agree more.
Cheat: look at the time on the watch
I upgraded to the s22 ultra last year and buying a Samsung was a horrible choice. I had used mid range phones like one plus, zte and Motorola for years and although I almost never got software updates the phones were easy to use and you owned them. The s22 ultra is the most expensive phone I have purchased but you definitely don't own it. I constantly get reminders about Samsung legal agreements I need to click on. The phone came with close to 20 bloatware apps that cannot be uninstalled or disabled. I called Samsung about this and they said if you don't want premium features don't buy a premium phone.    The additional apps collect tons of information and permissions and notifications cannot be disabled in some cases.  I don't view these apps as features but bugs because they cannot be removed Samsung should not care either but they care about the data they collect and that is more valuable than the money you spent on a phone. I will never buy a Samsung phone again and stick with the manufacturers that just sell you a phone and not a lifetime of junk apps that comes with it.
My note 9 had a case for 1 month, I then got rid of it. 4 years later and still going. Will be upgrading to S23 ultra
Its very hard to watch😭😭 but you are telling the truth😍😍👍
Here i am using an s8 and this guy is detroying s23s T_T
I'm also still rocking my 3.5 year old Note 10+. But the battery barely lasts 3 hours now. I'm thinking of buying a battery and replacing it myself.
Garbage in, garbage out.
Oneplus 11 durability test
That Casio F-91W 🤩
With all those cameras and they still don't have one toward the bottom to record in 3D 🤦‍♂️
I know I'm not the only one to cringe at this, but its even worse as the phone industry has me stuck in a shitty place, just like so many others. Never should have abandoned my P20 Pro, the S20 that replaced it was shitty, and the Pixel 6 that replaced that is even shittier. Now I'm stuck with a $400 tab buyout on the pixel, plus another 300 up front if I wanted to upgrade to the S23, literally the only thing appealing being offered right now in Canada. And thats samsung so I know its going to come with some caveats. I just want a phone I dont hate, which would only be part of a short list for me. Original i9000, N4, Lumia 1020, Z3c, P20 Pro. 13 years of smartphone ownership, those are the only devices I look back fondly on.
S23 Ultra .. no more words ❤
oh.. that sound of metal  frame scratch hits me every time.😬😬
This was very difficult to watch...
I love you man
disassembly please :D
I used to love Samsung phones. Infact so much so, I almost felt like a Samsung shill at one point. But over the years they've shown their true colors and they're no different than any other big tech company. I bought an S23U only to get away from the stupid Flip4 I bought, but after this phone I am onboard with the upgrade every 4+ years train. No point unless there is some major innovation happening.
"the pen is my favourite thing about the ultra line-up" *snaps it in half*
He snapped pen without saying anything.. but it gave a great satisfaction imagining it's price
I'll keep my s21 ultra... I can zoom to the moon! I'll never see a reason to change phones unless they give me one for free.
so now we need phones without charger 😝
scamming people in new ways is not innovation.
Dude if you keep breaking the new phones you will never have one to upgrade your old device hehe
When you've finished destroying that beautiful phone can I have it please 🙏🥺
I got an add on this video of the Samsung galaxy s23 ultra from Vodafone.
The length of Ads is increasing on this channel. I guess it's time to move to another channel
Waiting for oneplus 11 😁
Casio F91W
Bro, your voice is like smooth butter.
Still using S10+ perfectly didn't find any need to upgrade yet
Screen was just awsome , while heating no dark spots occured😳😳
Got oneplus 11 ad on this video
Finally some truth
Jerry take big give alaway of phone
I truly think smart phones have reached their limit for now. I can't really see any major upgrades that will blow our minds away. I now wait every three years to upgrade my smart phone.
Give the phone to someone Instead of destroying
"Next year for half price" - thats what I thought about the S22, meanwhile still struggling to find a seller that has a lower price than the ones from January
wtf was this video. 6 minute rant about marketing to end in a plug for a case that costs 6 times what a case should cost. LoL.
The phone seems to of held up from your test.  The picture quality your old phone vs S23 is expected. The camera improvements are so minimal now a days.  So thats expected if you live in true reality.    The video is just calling out samsung for their recycling /reused efforts.  Thank you for passing out that information.  But I don’t think it should’ve been the mainstay of the video.
Zack destroying billons of dollars ad campaign of samsung
the selfie is sharper on the S23U but the note 10 is still doing pretty well
At this point this man has some personal issues with S-pen
Who the f**k takes a knife to their mobile phone?
The days of upgrading every year are well over. Phone contracts being 24 to 36 months, very little change between last year’s and this year’s model…
Have you all seen how easily Zack managed to scratch the display glass with his razor knife at 1:51 ?! It immediately left a scratch right where the selfie camera is. Is it just me or has Gorilla Glass only gotten weaker lately when it comes to scratch protection? This isn't good at all.
Left pic is 23 ultra,much better quality
Dude, I upgraded my S20 Ultra and my wife's S20+ to respective S23 models for a TOTAL of 1000 bucks...I know these things are expensive, but it's REALLY easy to NOT pay full price...
2:17 a CASIO!  Nice touch Jerry!
You really need to upgrade ur phone to s22 ultra, trust me u will love it👌🍁.
You really need to upgrade ur phone to s22 ultra, trust me u will love it👌🍁.
You really need to upgrade ur phone to s22 ultra, trust me u will love it👌🍁.
Every time I see this.  My mind give me that✔️
I upgraded my S20 FE 5G (black) for the Pixel 7 Pro (snow) a few months ago. 👍
When will he teardown 14 pro max?????
Man, I think he rips Samsung even more than Apple now. How the tables have turned
Waiting for BreakPlus 11's durability test.
They even recycled the design
I got an ad from the Galaxy Watch 5.
Could you try the durability with one plus 11
"The S Pen is useful for a lotta things" < pock > 😱
Now do the one plus 11 pro
Well, the lighter test was little bit longer than usual... :P
brother big fan lzzz dont through this give this to me 😥😥😋😋
T Yes
I think if I don't attack my phone with a razor I'll be ok 😂
What kind of madness is this?
Only buying new s23+ because 4year old galaxy was destroyed by me being drunk
I love how Samsung removed charger saying (copying) it’s environmental friendly.  But cover the phone with useless plastic bits LOL.
I am using my Samsung A9 for almost 4 years now and the phone is showing some some little problems.  So now this year I am thinking of buying the new s23 ultra. But I think I have to go one more year with it cause of college
start of video: prying the phone out from box using knife...🤣🤣🤣
I 5hink what was missed was a lot of content. Samsung no longer include charging brick. It's doubtful they charge at 45w with anker anyways. Do Samsung use the latest Samsung panel,? It is super AMOLED isn't it? The cameras usually, along with latest flagship chipset (not mentioned) and all of the other features (not mentioned) add up. Samsung do use cooling (,stainless steel, etc) and try to  keep up with the Nguyen's. Now, I just did that translation-, automatically. That being said, I live in Australia and there are probably far more Nguyen's than Jones's (that was the joke). So, in conclusion, sorry Jerry, you've being borg rigged into one of these 'living in the past' dudes.."back in my day you would pay 2 shillings for twice the handset". What sit 🪑 that is (sshhhhh). I see too many H's and too many 8s. These days. It seems Samsung can't compete with mothership (for those who are stupid-China). I just read now. Perhaps that's why little brother LG exited the market. Economies of scale and all of that other bull💩.
Some recycling is  good recycling 😉
This is what I've been waiting for 🙂
Wester yr work tip
I just bought this phone ,I' haven't had a Samsung since the big note 10 . Wish i would of just stayed with my Motorola
Me watching you split a pen into two made get heart attack.
Who qualified for a free phone..I did subscribe..for a while???
You don't know that I own a HUAWEI nova 3e 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
Samsung Jerry likes to bash himself's brand. Fairs fair 3.5 year dude.
Galaxy note 10 😍😍😍😍😍😍
I already bought the s23 ultra for less than half price here in Europe. (coming from an s21+ -> that's going to family, so no e-waste), I didn't want to move on but got this great deal, and really needed a better battery-> the s23 is also more future proof (the eu version had the exynos chip, so little custom romdevelopment) with its SD soc. Price 512GB version = 1.579 euro-> with all discounts, I paid: 750. Beats the oneplus 11...
I am jumping the ship, but from a Note 9 - so it is a big improvement for me <3
who all are waiting for OnePlus 11 bend test 😅
I have premium, I don’t get ads, but I had an A52 5g and gave it to my partner, now I have an LG velvet 5g and will stay with it for a few years cause it’s genuinely a nice phone
Actually got a S23 and just before this S23 video... Thanks for pointing out the greenwashing, it's refreshing to see people do that and not being instantly wowed or payed by tech companies to believe every word.
My dream phone pls dont do
Huh. Actually thought the Right foto looks significantly sharper, especially in catching the Eyes. Though I do not know if it's the old or the new one,  definately noticeble.
Torn on there, rockng an S20 FE. Got it for the last good phone with an SD card. But i really miss the Spen from pervious phones. might jump in and finally give up my SD cards for a fire sale S22 ultra or this next year and get another year out of tis S20
"Innovation" is highly subjective... personally I feel that optimization and better internals are just as innovative, if not more.  A new design is simply a new design and not innovative at all in my opinion.  Foldables are for sure innovative but I don't believe they're at the right point yet (at least for me).  So when we throw out the term innovation, I think it needs to be contextualized... what exactly are we wanting for this claim?  New materials, new shape, button-less, hidden cameras?  All of those are aesthetic and mean nothing if the internals are compromised to support them.  There's only so much you can do with the current form factor of smartphones (including foldables).  Perhaps the next innovation that would be considered as much by the majority of users would have to be a transparent phone.  :)
Just realized you're rocking a casio f- 91w. Bullet proof watch mate I love it
Your review is straightforward bullshit.  The so called testing of durability you are doing would be exceptable only by someone insane.  Box cutter, trying to bend the phone to break it.  A cigarette lighter on the screen is absolutely stupid.  And some that purchased the device and excess abuse is not covered under any warranty of any mobile device manufacturers.  It seems you just have an issue with Samsung and the price.  But millions of Apple buyers upgrade yearly at ridiculous price increases and no real usable upgrades in Apple, but are swoped out every year.  If you done not like Samsung for your own personal basis.  They stop hating and piss on the next brand.  Clown 🤡
OnePlus durability waiting😂😂
No one is crazy to buy a phone and scratch it with a knife everything you say is negative people buying phone to use it not get an smart phone scratch it. This is a very bad revealing.
not samsung giving me 500$ in credit for my 6 month old s22u 512... also tmobile my carrier keeps thinking I either have a gold 128 or a burgundy 256. so it's shady imo. I'm going back to iphone.. my iPhone 8 plays games better, less studering, kinda faster better social media photos, just everything my s22u battery sucks2. not going back to Samsung for a while. I thought the s22u was going to be the biggest upgrade they had in a few months but they had the s23u done back in September herd people have been testing this new phone for over 5 months, that's nearly as long as I have had my s22u!!!!! shame.
The only YT channels with jokes which hit companies to improves their next flagship 👍 thanks Agent 47
Nah, that screen is fire resistant. I've never seen a smartphone do that before. 💀
yep. pretty sure my S22 will be with me for a quite comfortable while
i upgraded from the note 8 so i have waited a while and i will continue to do soo
I'm watching this while crying 🥺🥺🤣🤣
I have a phone from 2018, everyone laughs at me 😞
03:20 Part S Pen ya bah.. 💔
Why am I so triggered by the fact you removed the phone from the box using the boxcutter even though I know exactly what is going to happen in the next 7 minutes? :)))))
went from S10+ to S23 Ultra, No regrets. im happy
The dark side of Samsung's greenwashing is a pathway to dye usage....some consider to be 90% unatrual.
ভাই মোবাইলটা বের হতে পারে নাই এরইমধ্যে আপনি এইভাবে পোস্টমর্টেম করলেন🤓😭😭😭
Can u give me any phone which u teared down. My current phone is complaint & cant affort to buy a new one or second hand... Plzz rply to this comment.
Your the man 👨  👏
I am disappointed with this device. I'm waiting to upgrade to "note" for 3 years now. Last note I had was note 9. I hated the curved screen and moved to pixel, i 2as hoping curved screen will be gone by now like curved TVs are but no, here again in 2023 we have a curved edge screen. Whoever decided to keep it in should not be replaced.
Old S10e Samsung T-mobile gave me $400 to upgrade.   I get mine today
i have my OnePlus 5 for 5.5 years now and the only reason im upgrading to the s23 ultra is because the oneplus 5 battery is dead... having to charge multiple times a day is a pain and the charging plug doesnt always work
It hurts me watching!
Been watching this guy for many years, but still made my heart stop when he snapped the S pen to half. 😑😑😑
OnePlus add on my phone 🥀😂
05:52  i didn't  get a samsung ad in this video.. maybe because i have a premium subscription
Haha I got a Google pixel ad
Videos are ok , you are doing this stuff since several years, but you should try new concept ,  this concept gets boring anymore. sincerely
1300+ dollars and you get the phone with only a cable in the box. I remember, when I bought the Galaxy S8. The box was full of  stuff like adapters, headphones, charger and so on. And then the phone itself: no headphone jack, no sd-card slot, no iris scanner. You get less every year and pay more.
Aka. Zach being a savage for 7 minutes 45 seconds
0:53 "I'm no rocket surgeon"
I think Samsung note down all your suggestions 😁
Can't wait for the teardown good job Zack.
Phone company: took a lot of years to plan and build a good phone Jerry: get ready to dissolve in a few minutes
Samsung Billion of dollar marketing = paying apple in advance so they’ll not gonna mad when samsung make an ads mocking apple 😝😝😝😝
Why are you destroy this phone rather than You can send me 😜😜
Every year there's a new gorilla glass, yet every year it scratches at a level 6, with deeper grooves at level 7.
Zac joining the God Teir club!
"the s pen is useful for various things " proceeds to break the s pen
The Note 10 selfie was far better tbh!! Thats strange!!
Great vid. I did indeed get the Samsung advert lol.
This was painful to watch when mine hasn't even arrived yet 😱 S23 ultra will be first upgrade in nearly 5 years so plenty of new stuff for me i hope.
Just got an email saying my shipped looking forward to getting this phone. we here in Europe never had the snapdragon chip so for us it's a big upgrade
To be honest, it really feels so sad to see my favorite phone torn apart 😢
Hey Mr Rig, I always follow and love your videos. But I think you should add bit of drop test to the durability test, since we normally drop our phones almost everyday 👍. It's just a suggestion though 👍
Curious to know, what you do with the phone after the durability test?
I will always skip through the razor knife scraping down the sides!! My ears cannot handle lol
Still love my old N20ultra...
Got to say that the Note10+ is a tough phone. My glass is cracked, and yet there arent any issues with it. Only issue i encountered was a software issue which i thought so, but my telco provider said it was a virus. lol. anyway, after 2 weeks of random app crashes, the phone works like normal again, but by then i already bought the s22 ultra. lol. oh wells. keeping it as spare phone haha
I always wonder if this guy warranties out the devices he destroys and checks the damaged during delivery box, because surly there has to be something in the warranty about purposely damaging your phone voids the warranty?😂🤣 if that’s the case he’s getting innocent delivery drivers fired left and right 🤣 He’s a menace!🤣😂
dude got bored of destroying phones and now he's going for the actual brands
You’ve made the scratching louder you sadist I swear.
Give  me  this    phone
When I accidentally destroy my phone, I cry. But when he purposely destroys his phone, I’m quickly entertained.
I got the Samsung ad..  on my s22. What a waste of an ad
Still so funny
We need to see the inside part...
Got a s22 ultra a year ago, still I will this bad boy until it breaks or a new worthy smartphone can surpass this.
0$ on advertising like tesla
2:31 i usually skip this part My ears can't endure those sounds 🥴🥴🥴
I love it when Jerry busts Greenwashing.
Yes, i know. The seflie on the right is with the new smartphone (took at 6.36 pm - says your watch). Few seconds before on the phone was 6.35. The picture on the left is with old Phone, at 6.39
Going from the S20 Ultra to S23 Ultra (arriving on the 17th) Really looking forward to the new tech
Will there be a JerryRig lighter?
Could you open this Isocell HP2 200 mpix? I would like to see matrix
Feel like crying 😭
I have a note 8. I only upgraded because of the sale they have for bigger memory. I'm excited to receive it. I miss the note series it was my favorite but I can understand why they cut it so they can focus on the fold phones
I can't afford this one
I love your biting commentary on Samsung, Apple, etc.
I hate when he scratches the phone's frame. It's like nails on a chalkboard and it never does anything interesting to any of the phones.  I like the rest of the teardown and endurance test but I can't handle the scratching.
Your mother is perfectly right ! The customers doesn't want to update until... wear up completely the phone they already have.
Zack, you do such a beautiful job! That I can no longer imagine a smartphone launch without you! Thank you!!!!
4:52 its not the same exact screen they used last year because S22U had a ppi of 430, iP14pro had 460 and now S23U has 500 pixels per inch
Innovation team taking off day for a year
Actually the 200mp doesn't make pictures of the moon. The telephoto lens does.
know from the test i have seen the 200mp camera is not that good because the phones ai struggles with all the pixels and that how the goolge pixel 7 and iPhone 14 pro max still bet it in the camera quality tests because the the iPhone and google pixels ai could coop with the camera size but the new samsung galxy s23 ultras ai is not built for the camera
Yup, got S23 ad at the top of my home. 😂
Please make a series of videos to put the phones to the screen Burn in test. let's see how long the screens burn. me on a Samsung Galaxy Note 8, I burned 5 screens every 6 months, the screen burns at my Style of use, about 300 GB of mobile data per month, with the screen brightness set to maximum.
What is populism?
So is there a chance you can convince dbrand to make a slimmer case? I love the grip case just hate the fact that it's too bulky
mr jerry idol can i have your phone....heheheh.. .tnx in advance ..
Welcome to the roast of samsung  ....samsung users be Weare
Got a Samsung ad while watching this
god damn dude my heart suffered so much seeing you scratching and burning this hightech piece.. need to go and get some fresh air to recover..
u broke this piece of art 🎨 😢 💔
Solid choice of watch my good sir
"Environmentally friendly". So friendly they make it impossible to repair so you just have to throw it away and buy a new one. F*ck off Samsung. You're not fooling anyone.
my A71 in the uk just got a bump up to Androud 13 from Sammy... so they are making the phone live longer ... saying that , my mobvoi watch was slow etc etc etc  and was getting no updates .. so i jumped to a watch as opposed to a phone... if only there was a good case for my galaxy watch 5  ....
My heart 💔😥
I'm still running my Note+ and am struggling with deciding if I upgrade or not.
Bravo, very educational…. I like this channel, it bursts from very deep toughts, keep going….
F-91W crew represent.
Hello Mr. Nelson  Are you doing free giveaway of Samsung S23 Ultra?
No offense but dbrand is a bigger waste of money. Rather get a Spigen that's better and cheaper.
It just freaks me out whenever it comes to my mind that the phones you tear down are way better than the almost 4-year old phone you use.
I can't watch this lol you totally destroyed the newest s23 😭
Dudeeee, the soundddd!! that shit gave me chills!
I was thinking of moving from iPhone to this because Apple stopped innovating. Aside from private relay, I doubt I would miss much. However if the s23 ultra isn’t that much of a step from its predecessor then I’ll skip it. If they really wanted to innovate they could do something really creative and add a headphone jack, sd card reader, then integrate a heart rate monitor in the finger print sensor. Oh wait that’s the Galaxy Note 9…
оце ти чорт, краще мені віддав
Actually there is no new stuff happening not in November not in January with flagship
Jerry: The s-pen is my favourite part of the ultra lineup *Breaks it*
The S pen is useful for a lot of things.  **JRE: Breaks into 2 pieces. 😅
I'd like to guess the S23 was the selfie on the right but I can't say for sure
His voice gives me ASMR
The phone handled the screen so well and Zach just insults it 😂
Shit @3:21
Had they made the battery in a hard plastic case then the note 7 would've never had battery issues but sense these moors want to put a lithium battery in a soft case then u can only expect bad things to happen like fire
At this point I'm just waiting for the new phones to come out to buy the previous one, there's not that much innovation. Also the cost of the previous phones is sometimes become less than half the price of the new one
watching jerry scratching a brand new S23 ultra really breaks my heart 💔
Well I got Galaxy S5 in 2016 and I got Galaxy S9+ in 2018 right when it was released. Honestly it was a stupid purchase but the phone is still amazing nowadays. No need to upgrade yet. I use it for youtube, for movies, for casual games and for Google Maps a lot (I travel over 20k km monthly). And it handles all that like a champ
mom's quote is awesome
2:31 absolutely wonderful and pleasing to my ears
You man please give me that phone to me please.leave that mobile alive 😆
Please test mate 50 pro. I want to see how durable kunlun glass is.
how is samsung gonna spend billions on ads and i havent seen a single one in years
Samsung could innovate and separate themselves from their competitors if they do the following: 1. Add a headphone jack 2. Add an LED notification light 3. Add expandable storage 4. Add an IR blaster 5. Add a heart rate sensor and blood oximeter 6. Bundle a fast charger adapter with the phone 7. Support user-replaceable batteries ALL of these features were once supported on Samsung devices. How many more are missing?  (I intentionally left out the iris scanner because we have under display fingerprint scanners now.)
I'm Shook, I Just Pre Ordered The Samsung S23 Ultra. 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️I Currently Have The Note 20 Ultra. I Couldn't Wait To Upgrade, Now I'm Thinking What'd I Do That For🫣🫠
7:31 You're tearing me apart, Lisa!!
2 mins silence for those (including me) who wish he rather gave the mobiles to them than tearing them apart 😭😭😭
Lol yup s23 ultra ad under the vid, while watching on my 22 ultra, not interested in spending the money,  I'll wait for 25 to upgrade.
Last summer, I upgraded my beloved Note 9 for the S20+, and there hasn't been a day that I didn't think about going back. I never thought I would actually lose features by upgrading to a newer phone
That’s gonna snap!
What recycled glass what glass is not even a ploting recycling it is probably worse than just making a new one
Won't be upgrading from my 22 ultra, it's awesome
Gorilla Glass Victus 2 still scratches at a levl 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7. I wonder when we will see scratches at level 7 with deeper grooves at level 8. Victus 10 maybe?
I am an Iphone user but I still feel this video is unfair. Each time I watch this guy, he becomes more and more crybaby and hater of tech. He wasn't like this, now he can be bought, and companies seem to buy him to trash other products.
Loved the samsung burns!
That selfie comparation was hilarious
Would you say the Note 10 Plus is still a good phone to buy in 2023?
I still have my note 9, which is amazing, running android 12 with a custom rom called Noble rom 2.6. It has all the features of a new flagship with an occasional camera problem. Not advertising i think we need to encourage more communities like xda to combat companies like apple and samsung who will exploit you at any given chance.
probably the only tech youtuber with a Casio watch from the 90s, one that would probably outlive us all
Hey Jerry please review mate 50 pro with kunlun glass im excited... .
Hey Zack, that phone retails from $2000 to $2250 dollars in Australia, and I'm happy with my Samsung note 20, great video, looking forward to seeing the tare down
WHEN YOU FINISH WITH IT CAN I HAVE IT PLEASE...I WILL BE VERY HAPPY
I still have my Note 10+. No plans to change it anytime soon.
"... Next year for half price" you just had to say it 🤣🤣
I got an apple ad though 🤣
"....Spen is useful for a lot of things", breaks it. Classic Jerry
I upgraded my S6 to the S22 Ultra late last year. Will I swap to the S23 Ultra? Err, no! Had the P/X deal been good I may have considered it but at £600 I'll run the S22 into the ground and buy the S30! Or Fold 12!!! One nice thing about waiting is you actually notice how far the tech has progressed.
I upgraded from Note 10+ to Ultra. My mighty Note 10 started failing me latter. I still keept it because when it works it is amazing. After using new Ultra 23, I feel a massive difference. My Note 10+ had exenues, but now European gang got Snapdragon which makes me happy.
Also among the "Don't upgrade till it breaks." crowd. I had a Cat S41 before I got my Samsung S20 FE. Had that for 3 or 4 years, then the charger became loose or something, but the phone itself wasn't very good for performance, couldn't play games on it, and internet was slow, so I got a massive upgrade on that front. This will hopefully last a few years too. My most expensive phone yet, so I'd hope so.
I got an advertisement for the new phone before watching your video 😅
Why should I pay for recycle thousand bucks?
"....Samsung cares about pristine finish", scratches the finish with the awesome boosted asmr
Love the roast even if I upgraded from S22 to S23, great bump of battery life. And with preorder offers, it cost only 150e for the upgrade, so worth it !
Any chance I can buy that phone off ya
When you change your phone then I know it is time I would change my phone!
You may not want to change phones, but consider wearing glasses, because there is a huge difference between selfies 😂😂😂
Brutality
最新出產的samsung S23手機這樣刮看著螢幕心都會痛一支台幣40000多元的手機，瘋了
Comment no:7
Samung trolls iphone for not giving adapter and now Samsung doesn't give adapters
Snapping that S-pen like it's nothing 😢
Honestly the fact that Europe is getting the same chip as the rest of the world this time is the reason I will buy it this year and upgrade from my S9+
Please do a durability test of S23 Plus
It's so hurting when a $1000+ is being intentionally broke when i can't even afford a $200 phone. 🙃
Closing my eyes doesn’t help! I can still hear the scraping!
Now it breaks my heart seeing him destroy my favorite phone😞😞😞... I still say the NOTE is the best designed phone... One day I'll own one🤞🏾
S23U fees solid and hefty even compared to a Note20U, which is almost the same size and weight.
for some reason I always feel pain when these new phones gets scratched and abused..
My ultra arrives in a few days. But I've had the 10+ like you since it dropped, and the only reason I'm changing is because the battery doesn't last as long as it used to anymore, otherwise it still works pretty great.
Really waiting for ur video from the date of phone launch
Jerry have you every compared D brand to Mous cases? Reason I ask is because I have never owned a nice phone before (only LGs) and want to get the best protection for the s23 ultra
100 more reasons why I'm not spending that much on a phone that can be easily damaged. Even with a 100 dollar military grade protective case. You still have to worry about the battery expanding and possibly exploding. Samsung doesn't know how to back up their product under warranty. They failed to put 12 gigs of ram in a 128 gig storage model. 1500 on a phone is an investment. Just for it to easily scratch, overheat and get damaged. Is not worth it at all. I'd expect to get at least a decade out of a phone of that price. But sadly they don't make them like they used to. If you're lucky you will get a year out of it before it's outdated and you have to upgrade. When it comes to Samsung you can't shop with confidence. It's supposed to be their flagship phone and that's the best they can do. I'm android for life. Even though I have the money. I'm not spending that kind of money on junk. You have to be able to protect that kind of investment. For now I'm just going to wait before I upgrade my current crappy phone.
Zack mate, I think you might need a new lighter. I haven't seen a screen ever survive 60 seconds of burn.  It must be the lighter 😂
Pls send me that phone u just tested bro
Oneplus 11 next jerry
I really think it’s time that they just stop releasing phones every single year.  I used a galaxy s6 active for 3 years, then an s9 plus for 3 more, then a s21 ultra for 2 years, and now I traded in the s21u for an iPhone 14 PM because of a promotion that made sense for me.   Here’s the thing… The actual device capabilities have changed shockingly little between that old s6 active from 8 years ago and my current iPhone 14 pro max. In todays world, the s6 active would be awful, but that’s mostly because android has gotten heavier and harder to run due to features that most of us don’t even use.  Like I definitely appreciate the advantages of modern phones. 120 hz is a big deal to me, the lack of bezels, the power, etc. but the things I actually NEED or even really want my phone to do were mostly able to be done on my s6 active 8 years and ago.  Yearly releases are not necessary anymore.
Great review. 👍👏
*Jerry please do a long term review of your note 10 plus* 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Still got my note 20 ultra
I mean isn't the best thing for the environment for you to not damage these phones and throw them in a box and never use them again? Always talking about the environment but how many damaged phones do you throw away through the year?
I think the smartphone has gone the way of other electronic devices like the PC and laptops so not expecting any innovations.  The biggest thing to happen yet is battery technology.
This hurts me, getting the same exact phone tomorrow! Thank you Zach for doing this so I don't have too 😅
"i can see why Samsung would be careful" proceeds to scratch the sides 🤣🤣🤣
You tested it last year...
I suppose it's time I upgrade from my Note 10+
Can i have that damagws phone?
Its good to see Jerry wearing Casio F91W 👍🏻
Im getting this one, but it has been 3 years since the last one
"manipulated by regular dollars of advertising"😂
Bro broke the SPen like a KitKat wafer
Are you still using your Note 10 plus as your primary device or have you updated sir..please let us know..I am curious to know .
S pen still doesn't work as a PowerPoint pointer🤣🤣
I just died a little, the minute he snapped the S pen, 😅
No one can match pain of watching this video on old 5 years crack glass phone   Being a new phone scratched 🙄
Have a pre order in for the s23 ultra and new grip case + leather skin :P Currently on note 10+ with grip.
The heat Samsung feels after this but not this display
More reviewer : Unboxing and review   This reviewer...: Unboxing and Destroy🤣
What a durable phone! Thanks Zack for the review. I am definitely buying the S23.
Still holding onto my Samsung S8, it actually does everything for me for now.
Orang ini kerjanya cuman ngerusakim hp baru...😁🤣
S-Pen : save me from Jerey 😂😂 He gonna kill me, help...!
Samsung launching new phone  Jerry : No good time to upgrade  (Jerry using note10)
im in the every year or every other year camp, sorry guys battery life and screen brightness are my cares
Let me guess, the left photo on the screen selfie is the S23 Ultra
Waiting for one plus 11
i did not close my eyes
I do wonder, if you think Samsung isn't innovating, how do you feel about Apple? They haven't done anything in the realm of foldables yet, for instance. And they barely just adopted the punch hole cutout in the screen.... On the other hand they do seem to be doing more about recycling I believe. Or hope 😆
Your channel name should "JerryRIPeverything" btw I have note10 plus as well from similar time as you so looking to upgrade now thsi review is for sure convincing to buy another Samsung
Benim canım acıdı yaaa
Has anyone noticed, Jerry haven't changed a bit in last 3.5 years.
Yeaa, samsung ad on the end hahaha
I love watching Zachs videos though I find it ironic, on one hand wondering why we need new phones every year, being proud of using the note 10 until it really dies, criticizing the marketing of recycled material but running a business which grew with destroying things and wasting resources and for what? In the name of science? 😁 We know glass scratches at lvl6 with deeper grooves at lvl7. 🤪
I am using a phone that is 4+ years old and the battery that came with the original phone is still working fine
Which phone took which picture? 🙄
Lmao I love my Samsungs and I am a happy S23 Ultra owner now, but I cannot stop giggling at all the burns in this video 😄
I got a OnePlus 11 Pro ad instead of a Samsung Ad
Last time it made sense for people to upgrade was water resistant 3rd gen foldables and S22 Ultra zoom cameras. Both very niche and specific. Nothing else since S10 days.
If CEO's genuinely cared about the environment they would've resigned from being a tech company and became a farmer instead.
Team note10+ !
BUY THE PROTECTION PLAN YOU'VE BEEN WARRNED              7 DAYS
It is funny because it sounds like Zack actually wants to upgrade but is mad because there is no reason to! Not to mention all the corp BS.
0:38 Thats it? Thats the box?? *ITS JUST THE PHONE??*
Picture on the right side was definitely s23 ultra, much better detail 👌
Still rocking my S10e. Still working besides the battery life. Definitely need a new battery this year. Maybe a new phone at the end of the year or next year when they stop receiving security updates. Going to trade it in or leave it as a backup since I don't play with Custom Roms for years now.  99,99% of people don't need to upgrade more than every two years or so. Doesn't matter if you are made of money. Even most reviewers these days don't upgrade every year.  It is very rare in this market that a single year upgrade brings enough changes to make you want to upgrade besides pure brainwashed consumerism to fill the void.
💔💔💔💔💔
Bro please 🥺 send me that damaged s23 please i can't afford it
zack rocking a classic F91W is awesome.
I see why Samsung wants to be carefull with the sides. Scratches it with a razor blade.
Didn't get any samsung ads
i in fact did not get a samsung ad because i got ad blocker, but the last time i upgraded y phone it was an iphone 7, this year i got my self a 14 pro
i have had my note 10 plus for 3 years aswell and it still didnt break because im using a 1 euro aliexpress case, if dbrand sent me a case i'd upgrade.
S pen strength equivalent to 4 kit kat sticks
I PreOrdered the S23 Ultra today but the reson was becasue my Current S20 Fe is getting old and many times the maps and website lag soo much that it gets somewhat unusable. Another reason is the camera,  i need a better camera for my photography classes. And Lasty, I picked it up got $1100 Cad with a Free Charger and Bud2 Pro all for free. All i did was trade in my old phone and use a few tri8cks to lower the price.
random fact, slavery actually ended 80 years ago not  150 years. don't believe me look up neo slavery.
4:33, it's gonna cost more than $1500+ in India. 😭
YouTube adds and you whoring dbrand stuff. The worst.
My S10+ does every thing I need, piss on 5g, it is useless as tits on a boar hog
Damn, this voice. I wasn't even paying attention to what was being said
You are looking like a Johny sins bro
please test oneplus 11
Mmmm 🧐🤔oh well I will be waiting
Hey Zack. I hope you reply to my comment. As you are using note 10 + that also have untrasonic fingerprint scanner. Do you use a screen protector? If yes, which one. And if no, do you reccomend me just a dbrand case and use it without a screen protector? Please let me know. Thank you
cant wait for the oneplus 11 durability test to see if oneplus has done literally anything in the last 3 years
I would buy the s22 ultra but i dont want an exynos chip in my phone
Box: has convenient pull tabs to release the lid.  Zack: KNIFE
there is no reason for producing the same phone every year and wasting tones of materials for nothing
Tayangan tidak mendidik.
I am very appreciated about Zach that he always point out how can the company improve and always keep his note10 rather than other tech youtuber keep chasing new iphone. I think samsung marketing is failed. How would a customer buy a 1200 phone only bacuse of the recycle material？ Why need to spend a lot of time to say eco. Just do it and sell the camera, user experience and function.
Breaking S-Pen was personal 💀
How do you get it for 1200 bucks😅 here its 1450 for 256GB and almost 1900 for the 1TB version
nice
Ah yes, environmentally friendly use-and-throw disposable irreparable phones and earplugs, awesome initiatives by big tech as always.
@ 2:15 the image on the right is from the Note 10+
DBrand Available in India?
Give me one😘
My soul is screamed when he snapped the spen in half like a pencil, can i have it once you're done with it
Whoa wait so is the front cam your only reason for an upgrade? Interesting...
If our government can lie and we are ok with it why can't Samsung 🤷
I got advertisement for oil company "shell". I don't have a car or even a motorcycle.
ALWAYS ENJOY WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS JERRY!
I changed my phone every 2-years ,but the phone that I had before, I give a gift to my father ,and then the next two years again and again and again.
Here's Jerry doing Brutality
That scrape screech down the edges of the phone 😵‍💫
Sometimes I watch to see a non-folding become a folding phone, but I have been recently disappointed with the great quality of phones, amazing for the customer but the distruction gremlin in me needs more, maybe folding a phone around the edge of a desk would satisfy me
I got one plus add.
Que máquina el s23 ultra!
I upgraded my phone after 6 years it was a Samsung and it's again a Samsung
Left picture was taken by the Note 10, the right picture was taken by the s23 ultra.
It’s cheapest to upgrade phones every 3 years.
I love your content! But it always heards if you beat up devices which i would love to have. I'm still using the S10+
OnePlus??
The processor power at doing everything is the reason to upgrade you goof. Hehe love your videos.
He is still using S10+😅 & Reviewing S23 Ultra 😝
Phones are saving the planet by removing the charger is the same as Greta thunberg is saving the planet.
I’m using my S9+ for 5 years now
next year for half price better is the best option
You can’t tell the difference😭😂
🥰🥰🥰🥰 love you
Left picture is the new phone
10% more than last year. Complainer
Environment friendly but not wallet friendly! I am still on my note 3 and it's still enough for me, might upgrade this year or next.
Please rig one plus 11
still waiting the teardown skin of S23 Ultra~
1550€ ...
No, I didn’t get Samsung add but nuts add. Does that count?
Jerry... Has it ever happened that you done with your durability test and you forgot to press record button on your camera?
JERRY can I get a giveaway?
WTF... 🙈🙈🙈
Hmm no Samsung commercial but I did get one for Mint Mobile
Seeing an samsung ad about s23u on an s23u 😁
Good video 👍
sad for phone. it is so cool phone. 🥹
Yeah usually it takes three to four years for me to upgrade a phone because the prices in my country are damn high
I still use a 6s plus I got in 2014, but I'm done, it's basically not functioning anymore, will take my wife's 11 and she is getting the latest one.
5:57 yep
10% > 0. Emphasis on it being a low number is the equivalent of a homeless person asking for money, seeing how little they received and then say is that all? Not siding with anything here but blame regulations that allow how words can be used to describe a product. how little it takes to be able to call it recycled.
Give me your hands Darling Do you feel my heart beating Do you understand Do you feel the same  Or am I only dreaming
The only thing that made me cringe was when you broke the S-Pen in half!  O and it seemed the lighter was on the screen longer then any phone before it.
The S Pen breakage hurts me.
"the s-pen is useful for a lot of things" *breaks it like a bar of chocolate*
I’ve seen quite a bit of ads in a row even
@Zack I got no Samsung advertisement as I use YT premium..😅  @all Have been using Samsung phones like [Galaxy Ace, Galaxy Grand, S7Edge, F62, S20+, and finally S22Ultra ! I hate Samsung now.😡😡😡 They are literally fooling customers just like *Apple* does.  *1.5lakhs* for 1TB version is ridiculous. [ it's no way justifiable]  And related to exchange for yours and my current *512GB S22 Ultra* we would just get 55k ( even after that extra 8k exchange bonus which Samsung is offering). If Samsung is itself sure that for *1.2 lakh (S22 ultra)* phone in 1 year 70k is gone into the water.. then why even sell *S23 ultra 1TB* for  1.5 lakhs ??? Its just just pathetic ! Even the offers are a gimmick.Who needs a slow wireless charger for free and a wired 2.5k charger when one is already spending1.5 lakhs ?  And other offers are like you get 2k for Samsung app first time login [for what ?] I have never hated Samsung this much !!!    Copying apples strategy so that people think even Samsung's level is of Apple's level.  Even I never thought of buying iphone because iPhones were too costly as compared to Samsung flagships. And Samsung had better value proposition.  Now we all Samsung users need to switch to iPhone [if you are wasting so much money then waste on iPhone itself].  They are looting people. There is nothing for 1.5 lakhs 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️  I'm utterly *DISSAPPOINTED* 🙏🏼   Also, *Indian and Asian People* please know this..  Even my friends said this ..in US 🇺🇸, UK 🇬🇧 , Canada 🇨🇦, and Australia 🇦🇺 .. they have trade-in offers for those people. They only have to pay few 100's of dollars $'s for upgrade from one ultra model to another.  For them it's good as they pay the phone bill on contract and that's the only option for them and it's reasonable for them as compared to buying a normal phone on cellular contract.  For us, Indian's this is a very bad deal !   ThankGod I bought the S22U last year.. I had a very very good deal only has to spend less then 50k after exchange of old phone and dut to other watch offers.
Awesome videos sorry I’m soo late
There’s no need to update every year. Every 2 years is fine, and my phones get passed down to my parents so that’s a good 6 years of use. As long as the oldest phone still gets updates.
He snapped S-pen and threw away just like a toothpick 😅
"What happened to all the innovation"you say? LG, that's what happened lol
We'll be here when you upgrade
I have a 22 ultra from last year. This doesnt really seem all that different.
Where could we get the wallpaper you applied. Plzz reply
I just wonder how many people simply hate you
I picked up a Redmi Note 7 Pro after your teardown of it years ago, 3 years later the Note 11 after the 7 started failing, and now? well I'll be sure to keep my eye out for one of these badboys refurbished two years from now (if nothing else matches its durability by then)
Yup not Samsung but, surely 2  new One+ ads on this video🤔 (so, next video on One+ ?)
That chinese folding phone with no gap and ahead of the curve hinge came with a 60 wat charger...
😂 This year for full price next year for half price where do you fit 4 me after 3 years when you are done using it
My note10+ 5g has held up until now.. unfortunately it's been through a lot. Back glass is lifting up and front glass got chipped on the corner and it can't register touch as good unless I use an S-pen. Might spend a couple hundred to fix it but thinking about.. if I have it, why not the S23U. Rip note10+, sad times
Hey bro uhh can I get a free s22 ultra? Kinda need it cause my phone is really old like almost 3 years old
I upgrade my iPhone every year since the 11. It’s actually about the same price as waiting a few years..
to be honest note 10 + was a pretty good phone still stand out in 2023
Strap it to a nuclear bomb and tell us if it survived. What a garbage channel
Zack aka jerryrigeverything. Can you say the same to an iphone
what is this case?
From the recycling point of view , what do you do with your 'rig'ged phones and gadgets ?
Stop that environment saving shit and put back the charger 🤦🤦🤦🤦or decrease the price for removing it
3:19  The S-Pen is useful for a lot of things.   (Proceeds to crack it like a KitKat with no Hesitation…)
Id consider getting a top of the line samsung if they de inovated and incuded a ir blaster... zzz why tf are all top costing phones not including what budget phones do!
"The S Pen is useful for a lot of things"  *snaps*
My mobile is broken no money to buy a new one🥲
Can I have it?🥲
Spoiler ⚠️ pretty much the same as last year's S22
🤣
I forgot that this channel scrapes brand new devices and I found my self gritting my teeth while he was torturing the device. Same experience when I see someone squeezing lemons and I feel my salivary glands going crazy.
No chill this episode
Watching this with my s23 ultra
I've been buying notes for 10 years but not this year. I had a note 9 for 4 years then i upgraded to the s22 plus because the ultra is waaay too expensive even after months of waiting for prices to drop. Now i just got myself a very affordable tab s7 fe whenever i needed to use the s pen.
Waiting till 2025 to buy one, it should cost around 350$.
Your message of keeping your phone until it dies is truly inspiring.
Hello JerryRig I hope you and your family are very well ... I am speaking from Bangladesh I hope I will get a nice smart phone from your channel have a nice day with your family
definitely tearing apart and taking apart is different !!!!!😂
I wonder why is he putting Samsung under so much heat coz of advertisements and less innovation........it's Apple's whole business model😂
Damn!! What did that S-pen do to you dude? 🤣🤣
Maybe this is the time you’ll gonna replace your personal phone bro.
This guy got a S23 add on the video 🖐️
I'm a  YouTube premium member so I don't get ads anymore. And because I'm one of those poor working-class shlubs I have to buy phones on the very cheap and affordable end of the market, I end up replacing that about every two years because they get slow and unresponsive and I don't know why or how to fix them I just end up buying a new cheap phone. But I would love one of these expensive faster prettier phones...
It's true, i did get a S23 advertisement on this video 😂
He has no idea how good s23 ultra this year is. He's just took a selfy photo and he said it's the same phone with note 10. This year S23 ultra is so good and efficient that beats iphone 14 pro for the first time in history.
I'd change the name on my s22ultra to s23 ultra.
I hate Samsung but am impressed. Waiting a few months to see if the battery doesn’t explode.
Zack: "art class with Jerry"  Also Zack: let's destroy the pen that was made to do art before doing the art
True to the core! Smartphone innovations have just reached threshold i guess. We haven't seen much in past 3 years just minor tweaks here and there. I think next big jump would be in computation, like i wanna see smartphones replace PC at least 50% of the workplaces in next 5 -7 years.
Wow this is the first phone i seen withstand your heat test on the screen
i love how he still uses a Note10 +
Great video, it has me pondering whether my S9+ is due for an upgrade, and maybe I will next year when this is half price 🤣
ONLY LEGENDS WEAR F91W .. .. that includes me too. 🥰
haha great video , i did pre order this phone as my S21 got broken but i dont plan on upgrading , i remember when flag ship phones were 600 , its crazy that that phone at 512 GB is 1899.99 Canadian , thankfully i got pre order prices which saved me 479 bucks but still .... its alot of moola
Do iPhone 14 Pro Max durability test
Nope, yt premium ftw
I think Jerry is confusing what he's saying with Apple 😂
Imagine it’s 2023 and we can’t get past a level 6….
Jerry woke up and chose to hate on samsung
2:30 for all you freaks that love this sound.
ye i get that samsung ad while opening this vid
One day he is going to take out his own note10 s pen for writing  and casually break it 😂
This is always so fascinating but so hard to watch
I got a Samsung ad at the end of the video..... Jerry you should be a fortune teller
Scratching phones, living with parents... lol
Samsung really really tried so hard to manipulate the media.
Make Video on OnePlus 11 Durability
2:14 It's very obvious that the photo on the right is from the S23 Ultra, it's night and day on the resolution and finer details on your skin while the left has light blowing up on your skin which hides detail. Just look at the watches and coloring too. It's a massive leap.
What happen to invitus 2 scratch to lvl 6 to 7 still the same invitus 1..
Man that hurt !!!🤕
I have the note 10 plus, I love it, bit the 4g lte is a bit slow, I cracked my screen, idk if I should upgrade or just fix my screen, new battery and just keep rocking it?
This green color is so well done
Dude, this hurts watching this...
Well my current phone is eligible for a $1k trade in credit and I know that offer is not going to be around long and it is showing signs of getting slower each day. I think I am going to take advantage of the current "free" 512gb/12GBRam offer.  Going to miss my LG, headphone jack, and SD card storage but it is time to move on/up.
Ok you talk a lot about Samsung barely doing anything for the environment, meanwhile as a former Rivian employee, you do realize the battery cells in your truck were made from materials mined by Chinese children who are slave workers.
Galaxy Note10+ gang unite 👍🏽
Note 10 lite user here
Can I have that phone? I'm using Note 9 ahahaha.
Oneplus 11, please
hey zack, qwhats the condition  of ur EV Humvee?
🔥🔥🔥
By far some of your best writing or live riffing 😂. Top quality passive aggressive backhanded compliments
Speaking of Recycling, what does Zach do with the phones he does the durability tests with?
That pen breaking got me. I said OWW out loud n everyone looked at me like i got hurt 😢
Love the channel have you done a review on the Google pixel phone
If samsung keeps following apples footsteps then it will lose in the long run. Bring back the power brick and the memory card slot. Samsung use to brag things Apple does and stay original in its phone. Now it's just a shabby 2-bit follower with no innovation and own personal ideas. Pity.
I absolutely love your play with words! Thats what I like the most about durability tests rather than the phone itself!. Loads of love and support to you and Jerry rig JR.
S-Pen can be used for lot of things. Breaks it next second
Love the TPB reference, Ricky would be proud.
No Samsung ad, but I did get a telco ad and a Quadlock ad. I'd say that's associated advertising done pretty well.
Is it just me or is Samsung also becoming like Apple? With minor upgrades to the cameras and processor. Yet everyone roasts apple and both of the phones are similarly priced.
I hope you see around here in India 👏
Love the jabs towards Samsung ill advertisements  🔥🔥🔥
Im also still on my note 10+ lol
Scratching finishes at 3:05
This video is tearing samsung apart but the next video will be taking samsung apart, very different 😂
Im still using my note 10 plus too!😁
i always wait for those environmental perspectives of yours on every smartphone you rig.
2:17😁
Wait, you didn't tell us which selfie photo was taken on the S23 ultra and which photo was taken on the note 10 plus. I am curious to know.
So many shots fired...😳
I got a Samsung ad on this video
I own a Fold 4 in part because of your teardown and durability videos. It helped, however, that Samsung steered some of their marketing dollars my way and offered me the Fold for $800. I had a two-year old Note 20 Ultra (which I loved), but Samsung offered me $900 to trade it, doubled the physical memory on the Fold to 500 GB, and gave me one of their $80 phone cases (with S-Pen) in the bargain. It was ultimately worth it.
I got the s23 ultra ad to this vid
Zack can you please give a headphone warning for one the worst kind of ASMR online?
Everytime you scratch side panel metal, I always put off my earphone, that sounds make my teeth wiggling 🥴🥴 Btw, the screen burn test resistance were incredible
It will be a monumental day when Zack upgrades his phone 😂😂
Are the Camera lens scratchproof enough or do i need a lens protector?
Your absolutely right about Samsung needing to put more features and different software into their phones. The S22 ultra is the same phone at this new one that your are showing. I feel like the setup of the software is different and maybe some features other then that S22 ultra is the same as S23 Ultra
These videos are like anti asmr
Bro what is about your giveaway result
I'm going to stick with my current phone (S22 Ultra) for atleast 2-3 years as this year's phone is essentially the same as last year's phone.  Anyways great video Zack!
Jerry mama ❤️🥺give me phone 😓
Big heavy phone. It doesn't fit in pockets well. Samsung almost has it perfect. Make the s24 like the s10. It's light has a headphone jack small with nice curved display it just needs the new chips, better refresh rate, and s pen built in. I think this recipe would make a perfect phone for the s24 and add a fm receiver.
Give me this phone 😓😓😓😓😓😓😓🥺🥺🥺😓
I'm no rocket surgeon.. Best quote I've heard today.. lol
you should start comparing the grooves at level 6 and deeper grooves at level 7 seeing as most screens tend to scratch at those levels. thanks Jerry
Jerry went SAVAGE on Samsung! This was hilarious.  Me branding a Google Pixel 3. Still like new in case.
Wow doesn't come with a factory screen protector?
I could give two shits about the materials used and where they came from just as long as it’s still as durable and doesn’t cost any more than what it was before.
I am sticking with my note 20 ultra. Nothing looks like a legitimate upgrade at all to me. If there is any true upgrade from the note 20 ultra, somebody let me know.
Got my S23U few days ago, traded in my S22U, I can't lie, it isn't a major upgrade but does feel much more refreshed because of the SD8 G2 and the camera
Samsung spens so much on advertising but lotsa ppl are using their phone for 4+ years lol. i have mine going about 6 years now. apart from the battery and the camera quality everything else works so maybe i will wait till next year hahaha
Doesn’t Tesla take away features to charge later for them?
Hey Zach, I bet you I'd keep my Note20 Ultra longer than you'd keep your Note10 plus.
Nice note pen
I'm gonna keep using my Note 9 until the Fold 5 comes out. That's the only device that would actually feel like new when bought.
know its not my phone but it hurts my heart every time he scrach the phone
Can’t believe Samsung failed your durability test😱 7:46
2:11 which one from s23 ultra ?
dbrand decided to throw you some love on the packaging I got in the mail!!! Hope you see this and know what I’m talking about! Wish I could send a picture in the comments for you to see
JerryRig you are great man.
Every SPen failed your Durability Test, Jerry, WHY?
Jerry was on a roll. Man listening to you being sarcastic is the best in this video. And I would like to see a tear down video with the naked back of the s23 ultra
Hi Jerry, can you test the durability also open the phone like honor x9a the new launch phone
I'm on YT Premium so no ads. 👍
You uploaded this video last year 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Non skip able advertisement 😂
And with 4 years support for me rather wait when I just got the S22 Ultra by then it would be a major upgrade.
Premium Subscriber so didn't get a Samsung Ad. 👌
Got an oneplus advertisement on this video
Can u also do Samsung s23/ 23+ ?
I mean. it may be little numbers for recycling. but he was correct when saying any recycling is good recycling LOL We got to give Samsung some slack. Apple sends out the same old crap every year and people love it. Hopefully Samsung blows us away next time. but who knows
Hey Zack you haven’t done 14pro durability test. Are you going to make that video?
cant wait for iphone 15, gonna upgrade to that from iphone 7
I have just purchased this phone and i was looking for random but honest reviews. I don't usually go for the mainstream so-called "flagship" phones (if it is one), but today was the day i tried with one of the main phone brands.... I just wanna say that it gave me a true inner pleasure to watch your main 2 tools at work. The good old Stanley blade, and the lighter!😅 Watching your "tests" hurt me but absolutely pleasured me at the same time lol. I enjoyed your review. Keep doing what your doing bro 👍🏽😎
Samsung marketing team is like are we really going to send Zach the next model when he tells the whole world the brutal truth about our company? 😂
If you don't mind I can recycle them phones better than Samsung...
I own an s23 ultra and believe me, the left selfie has a difference!
This was great
My heart almost stopped when you casually broke the s pen
I'm carrying a  note 10 plus from the same time as you are carrying...so i think I'll change  phone when you're  ready to change yours😄
"The s-pen is useful for a lot of things"  **snap**  Not useful for anything any more!
The way he just take that pen out and snap it to 2 pieces 😂😂😂
No matter how much these companies use recycled parts and components and adopt green initiatives, they are still not enough to convince me that they removed chargers from boxes for the sake of their profits and not for the environment.
I'm just wondering what happened to the battery life when you use that phone for 3.5 years 🤔
Fan here from Philippines. Can I have 1? hehe
I always look forward to your durability tests and teardowns
Haha got the Samsung ad at the end of the video
Even though I dislike Samsung ignorance of not adding microSD card and headphone jack they do make good phones compared to my rog phone jesus they snap Like twigs and I have an anxiety with port scratching after wear & tear. I general think phones should be like sammy but never give in to the apple motto. MicroSD is the key to having a stable market
Meanwhile my iphone 11 Pro spend 9 hours underwater in Epcot last week and it's absolutely perfect still.
can i have that
Who all are waiting for one plus 11 get crushed
I've been waiting for you to make this
What about the ridiculous amount of bloatware that is added to their phones? Even if they innovated, they kill their tech by piling a bunch of garbage into it that you can't remove!
i have still my samsung galaxy s8 and im not a cash cow ;)
Note 10+ yeah!
I'm pretty surprised the pixels didn't shut off under the flame
the passive aggresive side notes are killing me
Idk why I want this phone in particular after it’s been stress tested lol.
Already getting it for less than half price via Google Fi. Too good of a deal to pass up.
I have to admit I was hoping you wouldn't do this video this one's going to hurt when you end up tearing it down I guess I'm slight biased I am as Samsung user I guess the Silver Lining you get to do it and not me cuz I don't even know if I can tear down that phone it's too nice even though it's $1,200 Plus just kills Mel lol
The only reason Samsung gave me to upgrade from my note 10+ is my failed charging port. Charging wirelessly only has gotten too tedious
I will upgrade from my Note9 to a Note20 Ultra, then give up on Samsung I think. I can't accept their practices.
My galaxy m30s is still rocking even without any case man...😂😂 Even gonna use this as long as it serves me...❤️ Btw love your videos (cause of the knowledge u give us).
Everyone say it with me *Greenwashing*
just here to see you beat up my opps…
eh, samsung not bringing innovation is the same reason i switched to apple 2 years ago, I'm not saying apple is being innovative at all, i'm just saying that I got tired of waiting to buy a new phone with cool new features so I could replace my S9 that I had since launch day... but samsung kept releasing the same thing every year, so I decided to try with a new OS that came in a phone that has been the same for the past few years like apple
Quote from Zacks mom was on point 👌😜
He is blaming samsung for not innovating ? Dude flip phones ? What has iPhone done ? Reselling the same design with minor upgrades since like 5 years now ?  Samsung releases one phone that looks like the last year's phone and everyone is loosing their shi*  IPhone is run by white people and they are doing even less for the environment.  But they are white so nobody is gonna call them out.  What a hater. And guess what if you are gonna break the phone with knives and flames its gonna break.  News flash!!!!!!!
Wow I want this phone so bad. And can't afford it. Here you are distroying  it,smh Have a great  day;( They are too expensive...
Well at least this year year they standardized their Chipset using only Snapdragon in all their ver, I'm so sick of them using exynoss in global ver (wich my country use) and tes while I can theoretically buy the non exynoss chipset ver, it was such a hassle to arrange the custome and additional tax if I import it from outside of my country
I got the S23 Ultra 512gb with free Buds Pro 2 (which I sold), trade in of my S10+ and a Unidays discount for just $830 directly from Samsung. At this time you can't get lasts year Ultra for this price.
I could clearly tell the right selfie was s23u. Much sharper and great details. You should upgrade stop with Karen type reviews
I'm not trying to be a negative Nancy but.. Jerry, the amount of electronics you trash just for a video seems a waste and recycling isn't what you're really going for here.
The Note 10+ pic on the left looks like Vaseline was smeared over the lens compared to the s23u on the right, I'm not sure how anyone would mix them up?
If you whine so much about innovation and eager for new design in Samsung why don't you say anything about apple who is using same used design for 5 years.. which wasn't even new when started..
Sound advice from mom.
3:21 had me rolling hahaha
The way I see it, Samsung got greedy and tried to flip to the apple side of thing where they don't upgrade much, focus on polish, and just try and make the phone look like a fashion statement or a trendy brand. Only thing is that they run android, an OS inherently designed to not be polished so it runs on whatever you stick it on, and anyone who cares about having a 'cool' phone gets an iPhone, and is already years into apple's great infrastructure, and would never change sides.
@1:52 you leave a scratch on the pinhole camera with the razor, but don't mention it
I just ordered an S23 Ultra to replace my Note 20 ultra.  I get a $1000 promotional trade-in credit, so I'm effectively getting the phone for $200.  I don't understand how they make money off these deals.
It breaks my heart watching you destroying my dream phoneee 😭
I can't wait to see you decimate the Fold 5 when it comes out!
For those that hate razorblades on metal, leave at 2:30. I did!
നല്ല വീഡിയോ...
Looks like Samsung refused to send those free units to Jerry. Forced him to say the truth. I like that. 👍
Such soothing voice
Not $1200 cool 😆😆
hahah the case make the s23 ultra look like a brick.
I dont think you can blame Samsung for the incremental improvements on cameras. If you did a blind taste test "which iPhone 13 took this picture and which iPhone 8 took this picture" you'd get a billion views and lots of surprises. Ever since my LGV20 with all the pro mode features I just don't think I need a better camera for every day pictures. Maybe if I wad hobbyist nature photographer. But I agree with Samsung in focusing the cash on making more products like the Galaxy Fold,  the Galaxy Utra with its genius development of Dex (does Apple even intend fo match this?). If  Samsung break through with a wearable low cost glucose montior that will be maybe the biggest development in technology since the iPhone.
My friends: Who's Jerry? Me: A satirical poet who takes apart phones and gadgets.
You finally uploaded a video on the Galaxy S23 Ultra, I've waited so long for you to do this!
I'll stick with my Galaxy S22 Ultra and good video.
I would like to see better glass in use by manufacturers.  For the high prices they charge, I am thinking sapphire would be a good choice.
Received my s23 ultra 2 days ago.. After testing the phone, I took a nap. However, I decided to add another sim on the slot when I woke up. I accidentally inserted the sim ejector pin to one of the tiny mic holes at the bottom with enough force thinking to eject the sim slot. My question is, is there some kind of barrier to protect the mic from being poked? I recorded multiple vids and made calls, mic is ok they said.. I hope the pin didnt puncture through the mic. Any help and suggestions would be appreciated.
The only smart way ti upgrade from your old phone to the new one is to try the z fold but still I don't like the crease and the screen aspect ratio so I'm still holding the note 10 plus 🙂
We want OnePlus 11 video pls🔥🔥
One plus 11 video? I think they fixed the fracture point this time
Environment? Lol Samsung doesn’t even care about it’s employee, even when they contracted Cancer while working in the plant. They even try to cover it up, no integrity at all!  Do you truly think Samsung cares about the planet? They are just doing for the sake of attracting more customers by advertising that they are “green” now.
I want that scratched down phone Jerry bro please provide me for some reasons  🥺
This video is so savage for some reason. I love it.
Looks like a worthy replacement for my note 9. Sadly I can't afford it. Thanks for all that you do. 😊
Waiting for the OnePlus 11 durability test
1200 usd and the sides are aluminum still, for that price i would expect steel for sure
Thank you for exposing the marketing lies by these companies 🙏
only bad thing about having an old phone is the battery life for me. i need to charge my note 8 like 3-4 times a day cameras are still good, sounds still good, wifi and mobile data still good, just the battery
Yes I got a Samsung advertising 🙋🏻‍♂️
I hate how apple it looks. Lack of design and boxy. it's like it's an sole phone but the camera are aligned different
I’m on my 3rd galaxy note 20 ultra. It’s been in an otter box since launch. Still love the phone. It’s needs a new case at this point.
"Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without" is a million times better of a slogan than "Reduce Reuse Recycle" for sustainability.
I have the Note 20 Ultra since launch and it still runs prefectly. Bought a Spigen case and then a Samsung leather case and so far no scratches, no broken screen, I do tend to take good care of things. Maybe if I have money next year I'll upgrade if the S24 Ultra proves to have major differences from the 22/23 but none the less from 20 to 24 or more it will feel like a pretty big upgrade in my opinion. Still werid to see current flagship phones have the same amount of ram, same refresh rate, same s pen feature, thank god they speeded up the charging from 25 to 45, still slow if you ask me for a top of the line flagship phone compared to OnePlus and Xiaomi's charge speeds.
S23 absolutely the champ of phone probably this year.   I cant even see how Iphone 15 better in anyway. Probably if only you already investing in apple ecosystem then iphone 15 might be better suited but then again. S23 absolutely smashing anything. I felt other mobile phone quite scared to show their flagshin line up.    I mean like really. Snap GEN 2 + Amazing camera ? Who tf need gaming phone, just buy s23 and buy 3rd party Cooler thats not even 20$ and you got MOST VERSATILE gaming phone ever.  As someone who use 14 pro max. S23 really the kings today
not sure where you're going with this Ads bashing, your income is all ads buddy. great video though
This video hurts me
Your camera rig reminds me of GLaDOS!
ARRRG this video is soo unsatisfying!
They don’t change it at all
You say this phone has "no flex" during the bend test. This is the most annoying part of your videos (which I love)...but facts are facts, and this phone is bending without braking during the test. Please use some kind of measurement to test the flex.
No sd card slot no upgrade
Jerry should change his maniers of testing durability test because we are at a point where almost every phones tests same. I think he should add at lease the durability of the glass screen.
JRE: I love the S pen  Also JRE: *immediately snaps S pen in half*
I am done with new phone. It is gettting more stupid. Thank you Jerry.
So exactly the same as the s22 ultra then
Lets open this bitch up and see the real samsung face on RECYCLING and REPAIRABILITY
Screen durability 👍👍
3:21 very satisfying to watch😅😅
"Samsung has had 3 and a half years to give me a reason to upgrade and I ain't seen it yet" I literally began clapping once i heard that
IMISSTHENOTESERIES
Will hold on s20 plus. No need to change. Lets see s24 or iphone 15 can lure me in. Correction: iphone 15 is out of list. Nothing new.  Now waiting for  s24 and iphone 16
In Germany the S23 Ultra is an awesome upgrade, just because of it's Snapdragon Processor. Samsung used the Exynos here for years and they were just laggy and very unstable.
Upgrading from a s21 to a s23 ultra. looks pretty tough!
Oh my poor OCD I never knew I had; JerryRigEverything making me wince as usual.
I did the upgrade from my note 10+.... Verizon gave me $800 for my phone and a free upgrade from 256gb to 512gb...  Out of pocket, the S23 Ultra 512gb in green will cost me under $500 after trading in my 4-year-old Note 10+... That sells used on eBay for less than $300 these days.
I'm not buying Samsung, Google, Apple phones since when they removed the charger. "just buy it separately" is bullshit 😂
Watching on my Note 10💪🏾💯
I have to say. The box cutter portion of your videos is when I volume ++++ 😬
Yes I got a Samsung advertisement in the beginning of the video
2:12 by looking at the time difference on ur watch I can tell the one on the right is the s23U as u took That pic first....
Decided to trade in my Note 10+, its still in pristine condition and probably could last 1 more year and no battery changes as well. But the promotions are just to good and this phone did hit the end of its update cycle so may as well. Next S24 they will probably give the S10 / note 10 series one more chance to trade in before its restricted. E.g this year its s8 / note 8 are the minimum phones.   Wish Samsung did bring back the S pen on the rightside and buttons on the left because we righties need to now adjust to the new layout.
I was waiting for this lol
If Jerry is so negative about a product do understand that Samsung haven't sponsored this video..
At 1:53 mark, your razor blade scratched the camera (glass)
So is the channel getting sponsored by Samsung anytime soon? Lmao
Can you a durability test for Mate 50 Pro
It is not a problem of innovation but with the doubtfull need to release a new hardware every year.
I got a vrbo add lol
If you have nothing to do with the unit you have tested i would gladly accept it as a give away. I don't mind the scratches. Haha 😆
I haven't got the device yet and here I watch jerry rig...
When the note 10 plus came out, it was one of the most returned phones sold out of the t mobile stores in my companies district. The note 20 ultra also didn't sell well. Mostly because samsung was charging more fore the note name when the s10 plus, and eventually s21 ultra, were better phones. The entire s20 line up was a fail across the board. The s23 series is just a refinement of the s22. Just like how the s21 was the refinement of the s20. Expect the s24 line up have more changes
When do you guys think it's the best time to buy this phone for cheapest price?
I will not get used to Zach just casually breaking the S-Pen every time 🤣🤣
I just dont understand why most of the reviewers just keep saying that this is not a great incremental device or so. This gives such a negative impact to any buyer out their. This device is actually not for the people who have recently bought s22 ultra or s21 series(may be s21 series people can update depending on need because the camera quailty is drastically improved from s21 series espically in video segment) or iphone 13 or 14 users. This device is specifically for those who are now using a 3 or more years older mobile phones.  The reviewers should understand mobile company dont launch this devices specifically for them. As they review all of their devices so this is a natural thing they will feel that it is a minor update. More over the point were you say you want the companies to be more innovative, as per my point of view the mobile industry espcially samsung now with it's s23 series is closest to what you will say a perfect phone. What do you except the company to do as of now with the current technology like do you want them to provide a holographic view of the caller or print a 4d view of the photo you have taken, I mean it is not bad to except then unexcepted. But the thing is samsung is already producing good quality phones for couple of years now. With s23 series now it is at a league of its own. Its on par with the apple 14 pro max and you simply cant compare it with pixel 7 pro just for the sake of camera. The overall performance is also much much better than pixel 7 pro.   S23 Ultra is using Snapd 8 gen2 processor and we all know how that processor works. It significantly improves the battery life, performance, camera AI etc. Also s23 ultra has a much for other things to upgrade i.e. faster ufs storage, lddr5x ram, camera, glass v2, processor etc. This all small things add up to that cost. AND ALL THE PHONES COMING OUT THIS YEAR WILL BE COSTLY DUE TO THE SHORTAGE OF CONDUCTORS AND VARIOUS OTHER REASONS. ALL THE PHONES THAT WILL LAUNCHED THIS YEAR WILL HAVE A PRICE HIKE FOR SURE.  You can wait for few years and pixel with release a 1200$ phone when it will reach to point were it can compete on equal grounds on all the aspects with samsung. Thats when you will see there is no new innovation with pixel as well since even they will reach to the point were everything will be perfect in pixel. Since pixel is still developing stage of creating a near perfect phone be it in camera, performance or anything we cannot just say that you can go for pixel 7 pro instead of samsung s23 ultra.  People who are using old phones i.e. more than 3 years and they want to have the best in the market right now then s23 ultra in my opinion is their choice and nothing better as of now. And with this device you can keep it with you for 4 years with you with all the updates and all. Because you will again here this next year or in this same year end as well when s24 series will be launched that this is just a minor update from s23 series. It is a task to add something gimmicky to a nearly perfect phone guys.   And this is not a comment from samsung loyal user trust me. I have never used a samsung phone in my life. I am currently using oneplus 7 pro for last 4 years now and I think its time for me to change the device and s23 utlra is the best option out there So I ordered one as well. So for me it will be a huge leap.'  BUT HONESTLY,  LOVED YOUR RIPPING APRAT OF MOBILE PHONES. IT WAS JUST THE REVIEW SEEMED LITTLE OFF TO ME S23 ULTRA IS NOT A BAD OF A PHONE. THE CASE IS THAT IT IS NOT FOR EVERYONE.
I wouldn’t want a phone that was made from recycled materials. Degradation of the materials is crucial.
The innovation is in the flip and fold versions.
No adverts for me, I'm Premium. I was planning to upgrade this year but see no need as my current S21Ultra does everything I need it to. Surez the s-pen would be s-nice, but for £1250?! Nope.
I agree its not worth upgrading from s10 to s21 or s22, but i think it's now worth it with this s23 line up.
So I have the Samsung s22 ultra and in august I am going to get the galaxy z fold 5
I always cringe, when the knife scrapes the phone! LOL! But, you're doing a valuable service with your videos. Keep up the great work!
While I technically can't visually see the difference in the pictures, at 2:17 his watch shows 6:36 in one picture and 6:39 in the other. Based the order of the pictures taken in the video, I can assume that the one on the left is the new phone.
I got a Samsung commercial the fence
$1200, yet you're missing a • headphone jack • micro SD card slot • charger the box • headphones in the box • pre applied screen protector   It's totally worth it👍
The planet will be fine...we on the other hand...time will tell.
LOL.. goes on about Samsung waste , then trashes a$1200 smart phone..! 🤔🙄
I got a Samsung ad lol
Great video, i was wondering if u would help in the earthquake  situation in turkey and syria given the awsome charity stuff that u have done and the wonderful helpful community that u have. Keep it up always will be  number 1 tech youtuber.
“Besides the model that exploded” 😂😂 ☠️
Still have my note 20 Ultra and looks like I'll be keeping it.
I almost di3d watching this video😭
What a waste..
A reason to upgrade? Try this new s23 and see if you ever want to go back to your old phone
too much bloat on samsung devices. im on xiomi mi 10 ultra and even though its failing me, i still use it until its completely dead. Then and only then will i feel the upgrade experience
"AlL rEcyClInG iS gOoD RecYLiNg"  I watch these vids cuz I'm into tech, not to be indoctrinated into your religion
Yep. Got a Samsung ad.
It's great that Zach uses his phone for years. However, the 60hz refresh rate of the Note10 is reason alone to upgrade. 60hz phones hurt my eye balls now. I still have a Note 10+ in my drawer of old phones and it's just so bad.
Which phone was the picture on the right taken with?
Upgrading from my 5+ year S9 to this guy in a week. I can't fathom why anyone would buy new $1000+ new phones every year for minimal improvements, but alas companies exist to make $.
Yeah! Another great video but more I watch and listen how Zack is opting for green and reusability the less I understand point of destroying completely functional device one by one… I know it is important and fun to watch but isn’t it a bit hypocritical? Hey! I am Zack who is using my Note 10plus for 3.5half years! I do not switch phones very often because they are good enough for me and it saves a planet… Meanwhile I will break apart another couple of brand new devices and send them to the landfill (or hopefully recycling center ) for ads revenue, your fun and science… Good Zack is keeping phone for long time, bad Zack is switching phone 20 or more times a year… I just realised how contrary those two approaches are… It is not feeling wholesome at all…
I was waiting for this phone to come out as I need to upgrade from my note 20 ultra with its curve screen which is again cracked. After further thought I just could not fork out the money for another curved screen phone which is likely to crack.. I'm switching to a Chinese rugged phone like a Doogee or something.  The only thing I'm going to miss is the camera.
Oh my god it was horrible to watch this, such an horror video for Samsung Lovers and Users
I have to watch ur videos thank u
Imo, I think Samsung is focused on their foldables right now cause they think they've already hit the peak with their S Series.
as long as these words exist.. "profit" and "business"...they don't care your opinion...nothing personal just doing business.. 🤑
I used to buy a new phone every year, but the last time I did that was back in 2013. Now I wait 3 years or more because you notice a bigger difference versus buying one every year. Besides, Apple and Samsung aren't innovative like they used to be, except I do think Samsung does innovative a bit more than Apple nowadays. They both offer great quality products, tho. I pre-ordered the S23 Ultra as I am upgrading from my note 20 ultra, so im curious to see how differing the 2 devices are. Also, I did not get a Samsung ad, I got a Verizon ad.
If it ain't broke, don't change it. Using a phone (or anything else) for more years is more environment friendly than using recycled materials on a new one. Love your videos Zack!
Just do the damn test. Leave your politics out of it.
Dude, nobody gives a crap whether the box and glass is only 10% recycled
Couldn't care less about them using natural dyes.
I got a TMobile ad for an iPhone
You should try sinking your phones passed their rated water depth protection as part of a test,might be difficult to measure the phones depth but who really knows and has found out?
Zach: 200 mp is cool but not $1200 cool.  *says this while harassing the exact same $1200 phone
I don't see a reason ro upgrade from note 10p
Samasung s23 ultra too expensive..
Still rocking my Galaxy Note 10 plus also. I actually love the fact that even though you're a tech guy and get some of these phones for free you still rock you 3+ year old phone
I got the s23u to replace my s10+ as I cracked the screen. I can confirm that it's basically the same phone for my use case.
Zack you crack me up sometimes.  When you said the s pen was your favorite part of the ultra and that it's useful for many things, while simultaneously snapping it in half, i almost spit my drink into my screen.  I'm sure it was unintentional comedy, but it was nonetheless hilarious.
Such a great piece of tech. I think it is time for you to move on to a new century device Jerry !
Yes U Right, Samsung have to start spending that ads money on the features of their phones and products and let them ads themselves like Tesla
I'm not changing my s10+ until Jerry do it.
What happens to these tested phones afterwards? What do you do with them?
Although screen handled the heat for 60 seconds,  Samsung had to feel the burn for the whole 7 minutes.
All he doi g is bringing downg samsung and the phone jus do the test and shut up omg
no adds on my video...ur video i mean
I didn't get an ad since I'm on YT Premium, but I did get a S23 Ultra since I'm sunsetting my 4 year old S10e. I'd probably still be using the S10e for another year if it wasn't for the waste of silicon called Exynos.
I got a RedMagic 8 Pro ad 😅
The sarcasm is nearly unbearable. On the flipside of Jerry's mockery of the 23s greatness, is that 'innovating' a premium smartphone today is exponentially more difficult than it ever has been. It's like trying to innovate a Keurig. Good luck with that.
Pass it has not wow me at all am happy with my note 10 still ,
I need one of those phones I have the 20 , 21  Ultra and 22 ultra
Don't worry Zach, I got my advertisement from samsung after watching your vid😂, i'll sent it you if you want the screenshot
Jerry: "The s pen prolly the most favourite part of the ultra lineup"  Also Jerry: Proceeds to break the s pen 😎
Thanks for sharing
What do you mean Samsung aren't innovating?? That screen lasted 60secs under the lighter!
Green wasing doesn't lower the phone's price. Just a hype
Got a Mous Samsung advert. Does that count?
Great durability test as always
Right at the end, I got the Samsung ad for the s23😂😂😂
I have a s21 ultra don't need the s23 but I sure do want want one. Only because it's a snapdragon 8gen and not a exynos which heats up
Still using the note 8
I hate Samsung Galaxy phones
This always hurts to watch I just cant
I went from upgrading 1-2 times a year, until I got the S20 and kept it for 3 years. I bought the S23, but Im not convinced it will be enough of an upgrade.  If I still had my S10, I dont think I would have upgraded. I liked it's camera far better than the S20. The S10 is a goat.
Hello Zack, it's been a while since you've done durability test on the Sony Xperia lineup. Any chances if you'd do the Xperia series again?
22 series had a technical flaw. If you put a case or screen protector over the camera lenses the speakers would blow out when exposed to pressure change (on a plane) or temperature change. Took me forever to figure out what was causing the issue and Samsung customer service could not help. Hope that is fixed moving forward
Don't west money this s23 ultra
Tell me Jerry Rig is a left wing Lib without telling me he's a left wing Lib
This is the only challenge I watch without skipping..
Waiting for durability test of one plus 11 pro
Great phone
I love your videos, I just can handle the razor knife parts on the sides of the phn...lol  But it doesnt stop me from watching ...
I can't stand Samsung as a company, they're very aggressive and it's not as good as it's marketing makes its products out to be
I don't know, Tesla does spend a lot of their money finding new ways to make money, like how they charge subscriptions for heated seats. Plus to me a press event are advertising, they just don't label them as such.
A
Zach is really making me stop buying new tech 😆 nothing much changes from generation to generation anymore.
Mine will be here tomorrow and I can't wait.  Coming from a pixel 7 pro the Samsung.phinea have superior cell signal l. I travel 150-300 Mike's daily and I will be thankful to have my Samsung back not all signals are equal
I've been on Oneplus 9 Pro but lately the software experience is absolute trash. I am not talking about the performance, but the little interactions with the settings, search, and notifications. Is the upgrade to S23 Ultra worth it?
Hey. S22 ultra also takes pictures of the moon.
i call BS on the case lasting you. i had a grip case and it fell apart after a month lol was not ammused.
👍👍👍
"sAvE tHe pLaNet gUys"   Propaganda
I don’t know why phone companies release a new phone every single year they’d easily get away with releasing one every 2 years
S20 users anyone???
Hey Jerry, would you upgrade your phone this time?
Ah yes, recycled parts.. They really think they’re saving when the chargers are in boxes
Because  this video I buy samsung note 10 plus. Thanks
I really like dbrand products!
I did get an advertisement at the start of the video
Watching this on my Note 8 which still works fine!
And this is why the wise man has the same as he does.
Not me just casually watching S23 durability and then I get an S23 ad 🤣👍
One of the differences is the 3 mins and 8 secs difference in taking the two pics according to your watch. 😉 good job Zach!
the packaging has nothing in it
Yeuh, got a Samsung ad on this one.
I'm switching from my note 10+ and passing it on to my dad.
Rants about Samsung not innovating while simultaneously demonstrating the first ever display to not react AT ALL to being burned. Oh Youtubers, never change... 🤣
I was honestly going to replace my mi10t Pro to s23U, but when you said " or buy it next year for half the price" made me buy the s22U used 👍 thank you for the 800€ economy
PBK's hardness test kit is crap
So thick a phone yet did not put 3.5 jack... Useless copying from apple. I hate companies who keep on copying apple even apple's stupidity! Another is by removing charging brick in the box.
Do the LG wing Durability Test.
I'll only upgrade my phone when the new Poco X comes out
Note 10 Plus here. 4 me 2 upgrade: Flat screen Battery and CPU like 🍎 has
my samsung note 9 still working. and i cant find 2nd vendor of the battery, from 4000mah now on 2990mah according to accubattery pro. how about your phone sir @jerryrigeverything? do you have extra battery lying in your house for note 9? thanks
2:10 The time on your watch tells me the new phone took the picture on the right
Samsung n apple they have given up on innovation completely.  It's the same old model of last year with a better camera n processer.  Reason that 22ultra price has not decreased.  By this dummy has.
I'm also a proud owner of a Note 10+. The only thins that is making me consider buying another phone is the battery. It's at 76% after 603 power cycles, and only giving me around 4 hours of screen time. I'm in Mexico, so it's not easy to find a good quality spare battery.
I preordered the black s23 ultra to replace my s20 ultra and i'm kinda tempted to cancel it and get the green instead. The color is really growing on me.
I literally got my s23 ultra for less than 200 dollars. I had to get it.
Spicy! I love it
Hey Jerry
I got s23u for 216 bucks w/a note 20 trade in
" The S pen can be useful for a lot of things" *Breaks it
The best smartphone in the world at this moment!
did the S23 have a screen protection by default like others?
another very insightful video Zack! still on an iPhone 8 over here and is getting slower everyday XD. saving for a new phone now, so hopefully I get there before my current one dies. keep up the brilliant work!!
The phone survived the physical injuries but not the emotional damage
i'm still rocking a Note 20 ultra. i don't see the need to buy a new phone with less features. beginning to look at other android makers since Samsung is basically the iphone sister
right is s23 2:20
It's so cool that you are sporting a Casio watch. Which model is that, if you don't mind me asking?
Please bring OnePlus 11 Durability test I wanna see first fold of 2023😂😂
No ad? Was curious to see how they manipulated me.  Love the videos but it does tickle me how you go on about recycling etc and yet you personally contribute to the problem by destroying some phones.  Keep up the good work.
I love the term 'natural dye'. Purple used to be a natural dye as well. But I don't think it would play well for sustainable marketing if people knew how we actually got the natural purple. Natural isn't always great, and artificial isn't always bad.
You are a legend !!!! 🎉🎉🎉 your videos are awesome!!
As he said smartphones last for years, the companies use advertising to push peoples greed button, using sentences like cool, more powerful this or that when it's mostly been incremental changes.
Looks like new Gorilla Glas is just another marketing BS…
Does any else feel bad for the next content creator who will be passed this demonstration model?
This is so weird. we saw another video and it scratched at level 8! so whats going on here hmmmmm
Better Phone it's my War Phone
Recycling phone for 1500€. Nice.
children in the world starving turkey and syria suffering from earthquakes and you're cool fucking cell phones for thousands of dollars fun, don't you have a family? learn to help others do like me and many people send donations to those in need anyway you are a mere noob who has fun destroying, just the 1 thing to do we are not patrol but your content makes anger and more people like me we will give Strike is simple you are inhuman don't look at others you have everything in life today but tomorrow you may not have it and need help never forget that.
I had my note 10 plus for almost two years until it died when I plugged it into the charger. That phone was amazing. Watching on my z flip 3! Oh and no commercials youtube premium, and once you go 120 refresh rate you will never go back lol
WTF no camera hidden technology for this price 🥱
Still have my one plus 7 pro that I got in July 2019. Going strong.
Plotwist - I watch Jerry's videos for the roasting 🤣 😂 😭
Can you 🙏 gift me one s23 ultra. ?
Samsung hasn't convinced you yet for an upgrade but I ask you...seeing children working in lithium mines and the excessive environmental destruction caused by obtaining this mineral doesn't make you think about leaving electric cars aside?
Love it bro! Amazing video like usual.....I finally bit the bullet this year and went ahead and upgraded from my note 9! First new phone in 6 years so I'm sure i'll be happy with it! I've been waiting for them to go back to flat glass on the flagship option because I HATE the curved screens, but  I've used the Note since the Note 2 and refuse to go away from the SPen.....this year it the year I finally bit the bullet
3 years hell...still rocking a SAMSUNG NOTE 9, love the earphone hack and good battery life, the os and chip may be a touch slower..but it still gets the job done literally for my day job, it is my work computer.
Should make a vid about the OnePlus 11
Yes you can tell the difference in the selfie your older phone picture isn't sharp or clear. Really Zach your burn test was beat buy minutes you talked about 2 not even burn mark.
2:33 my goodness that is spine tingly painful to hear
Zack "I'm not tat nice to phone" Every phone on the planet: " yeah no s**t!"
Samsung Says they care for the earth but they removed the charging brick and NOW the charging cord 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
Jerry is talking about samsung marketing team making you think you need to upgrade... DUDE REALLY?!! What about Apple?? hahahahaha they are the kings doing that for years and not only with iPhone, with everything they put in the market with the logo... example: useless and pricey wheels for you computer case a thousand dollars monitor base, tons of expensive and crapy accesories, literally same phone for years and years and years with old technology but fancy name like Dynamic Island (same punch hole that Android have since 2014 with animations) I mean, EVERYTHING. The crazy thing is ppl still buying new stuff year after year... Sorry for my enlgish btw... xD
These corporations only care about the environments of their bank accounts. They think we're all stupid!!  Well many are "upgrading" every year like some dummies. Especially going from S22 Ultra to S23 Ultra that's REAL Goofy,  but to each their own. I think it's idiotic.  🤦‍♂️  Appreciate your honesty unlike the other phone schillers on U Tube.
I have adhd and a form of autism so it makes it hard to use a iPhone, at least for me. I've only used Samsung and my phone finally caved today. I liked the video and I understand the hypes and drive. My sisters upgrade as often as they can to their iPhone and make fun of me because I'm the only one with Samsung. It always makes them quiet when I show them my lock screen of the internals of the iPhone to show that their phones are samsung too, they just don't like to show it. I already ordered the otterbox case and screen for it, I don't fall for the insurance scams either and I just use the phone till the buttons stop working and the phone stops charging. If those got fixed on my phone, I wouldn't pay to get a new one. Thank you for the video, I still bought this new model -_- but compared to what's out there, this isn't bad. Hope you have a great one!
Recycling? People always complain about recycling, how companies should do it and such, except they don't realises that that will drive up the cost immensely and then no one will buy it. So what is it then? Is money more important? _Basically yes,_ money is more important because if there no one buys their products, then of course they won't make it. No money means no company.  People who say that Samsung should do more recycling will also be the same people who complains that the cost of the phone has just increased significantly when they do use fully recycled post consumer materials.  20% recycled materials is probably the best they could do without upsetting the price and therefore their customers.
Keep the cameras working after tear down. I'm on premium. Only way to go through 10 videos in an hour and a half. 25 videos in 4 hours. Averaging 20 to 30 minutes. All are over 10 minutes. I hope of of these days Samsung will use two smaller batteries. Be able to charge the phone in a shorter time by  using wireless and wired charging.
I upgraded (not really an upgrade. More like extreme downgrade.) from an Asus ROG Phone 2 with 1tb of storage when my carrier was like "yo, you're phone's gonna stop working on our network, so we're sending you a free phone. They sent a Galaxy S9+ with 64gb so I could still have cell service and shut my Asus off. I still use the old phone for games and stuff, it just has no connectivity outside of wifi. :( Then this month, they offered a great deal. So I'm turning in my free S9+ for a free S23 Ultra 512gb in that olive green color. Seems a worthy upgrade for free. Thanks for the heads up on the fragility of the S-Pen. I miss having a tablet phone from back when I had my trusty Note 4.
This im gonna see
You wanna talk abysmal selfie cam? Fold 4 has the under display camera that makes 90s webcams look goox
And that day, no love was sent to Samsung 😂
Ah yes... My daily dose of phone destruction 😂
I wish dbrand made a case for my RedMagic6 😞
Is it just me or is that mic TOO close to the SIM tray hole? It wouldn't be difficult to try and insert the pin into the wrong hole....
I’ve got a Samsung Galaxy S 23 ad 😂
Painful 3:20
you look like you could grab lighting with your hands
My heart ached when you broke the s pen into two
I didn’t get a Samsung ad, but I did get an ad for an S23 phone case before the video.
Any plans for the OnePlus 11, can't wait to see the durability test
2:10 - The only reason I can assume that the S23 is the one one the right is because it was the first photo, and the time on the watch is earlier in the right photo. But even then, that's assuming that there wasn't any trickery where another later selfie was taken with the S23 so it has the later time on the watch. So yeah, just based on picture quality, this is indistinguishable.
Got my S10 back in late 2019 and it does what a phone needs to do. It has shown its age recently with screen burn in and batterly life draining much faster, plus for some reason it crashed on me and wiped all of my photos and data off of it (make sure to back up frequently). Still I'm happy with it, but if I were to upgrade there's no way I would drop $1000 plus on a new phone that is only a bit better. I'd rather spend that money on a pixel phone for a fraction of the cost and what seems to be a genuine attempt to innovate.
S7 s9+ s21 ultra that is my phone order I will wait till next year to see what samsung has to offer I still like my ultra
yeah using your phone for years is a lot better than getting a recycled one every two years or getting a new one as well
I just ordered one of these ... total cost to me of $180 after trade in.  Trading in my 3.5 year old Note 10...I  guess I have my limit.
It's not only Samsung who keeps the same design. But at least they change every year or two. Apple has the same phone for years on end and gets away with it. Besides Apple doesn't allow for third party repairs with authorised parts and makes it expensive to fix. So they waste more resources then anyone
I watched this on my s23 ultra, I'm so glad about the purchase. I'm upgrading from my almost 5 year old s9plus!
You literally compared front camera in that one shot 😂 genius
😘😘😘
5:50 i got an s23 ultra *after* the video had ended 😀
Upgrading finally from the note 10 plus... The power button jumping out is always a bad behavior for notes.. My note 8 is still working though.. Miss the headphone jack
No body do that in the real  life the first thing do is buy a cover and screen protector I'm don't know why do that
The s22 ultra can also take pictures of the moon
I upgraded to an S23 Ultra after 3 years and a half spent using an S10 (that is one of my favourite smartphones ever launched by Samsung). I am missing the headphone jack but this new flagship is absolutely amazing: the battery is a monster, the camera is great and in Europe is finally arrived the Snapdragon SoC. Uncompromising performance and power, I am fully satisfied with this product and think I'll use it for five years at least. Good job, Samsung! PS: @JerryRigEverything I love your durability tests and appreciated the way you snapped in half the S Pen🤣🤣
Keep Up Good Job Jerry,,I love seeing those Teardown/ durability test on all phones However I'd like to see the Same with those Budget phones like Samsung A series...Thank you.
If it wasn't about the bottom line for samsung, they should provide an option to obtain a charger in the box when you order your phone.
Защо е нужно да се унищожава... С какво е полезен този клип?
Amazing color 😮
hi from morroco  i love your vids mate and i would apreciate if you did a durability test to a budget or mid range phone it would be fun  by the way i still use samsung s7 great phones
Definitely not upgrading just for a better camera
I do the same, I don't change my phone until my important apps stop working and the battery replacement is no more expensive than the value of the phone itself.
Well it's finally the first time watching one of your videos with the brand new phone in it. Just got my s23 ultra in red today.
im still using my note 8. i've been thinking its time for an upgrade but these new phones are stale
5:55 Yup just got an ad for the S23 right after this video
F91, you are the GOAT😁
So Zack is still using old Galaxy Note 10+ but chose to rip off newer flagship 😁
😭😭😭
"Got a little carried away there..." Thought I was watching a smartphone video - not an eco-propaganda rant. FFS Jerry - focus on the job.
Here in India, it is costing approx Rs.80,000 to upgrade from s22ultra to s23ultra. Are the upgrades really worth 80k.... Hell noooo :(
Is the dbrand grip case with a teardown skin available for a Galaxy Note 8?
My heart say noooooo
Samsung you guys are idiots to brag about 10% recycling glass….. another gimpy marketing trap to get you to buy this phone timeline 1:30
Let's not forget the gigs of bloatware on the new Samsung phones.
Ironic... I traded my note 10+ 5g for a s23+
Nice Casio Watch Zack 2:12 can’t beat a simple watch that just tells time
Don't give them a reason to give you a reason to update Zack. They might send an update that forces you to upgrade or be stuck with a bare minimum of a smartphone
Indeed it started with a s23 ad. Hahaha
Right at end of video a samsung ad !! Lol
Does it have a removable battery or SD card slot, or a 3.5mm jack?
Got the ad for the s23 ultra
Since Steve Jobs died, almost 0 phone innovation. None from apple, Wich means competitors have 0 reasons to try and innovate themselves.
Nice watch you have there Zack!
Got my 1tb S23 Ultra yesterday for £900..absolutely love it. This'll keep me happy for many years. No complaints from me! ..and yes I received all the emails with advertising from both Samsung and Vodafone and fell hook, line and sinker for it..but again no complaints. Great video...but when that spen snapped..I may or may not have shed some tears!
Rip Samsung
I love how Jerry breaks the S-pen by saying "the pen can be useful for a lot of things."
Unfortunately I had to get the S23 because I cannot immediately afford the upfront cost to repair my whole S21 Ultra back glass and display. Cheaper to immediately finance even though I know it's costing more. I hate that it's not cheaper and easier to repair these things. I'd keep using my S9+ if my signal wouldn't randomly drop and my top speaker worked though tbh. S9+ is still a great phone to this day, just a little laggy.
Zack I know you still use that older Note (you do right?) But this is the perfect opportunity to switch to the S23 Ultra... is IS that good, and battery life is insane... I'd say go for it 😉👌
i still have the note 9 from 2018. my phone is reaching 5 years with me.
Still, I think Samsung uses more money on R&D than Apple does.
Dbrand dont have tear down skin for the s23 ultra...  😭
Durability aside, the phone passed the burn test like a boss. 1 like= 1 respect
I feel like the consensus with the S23 Ultra is more or less "It's a great smartphone, but man is it boring." The Ultra looks the same as the S22 Ultra, the only real difference is the one camera and the processor.
Dammit Jerry you scared the hell out of me with that tittle, I just bought the S23 Ultra 😂 I only got it cause my S21 got stolen tho, otherwise just like you no reason to upgrade.
How many recycled bodies do they use to make these.
Not me watching this on the exact same phone 💀💀😭
3:20 bro got spawnkilled
2:20 respect for not upgrading your phone every year just for "i want the latest even tho there no difference from last years phone"
Love your casio watch. I have one just like that. those things just don't die.
I would like to see a S23 and S23+ video ngl
I wonder why you use a 3.5 year old phone when you buy and test a new one every year? Isn't it better to use one like the s23 ultra anyway? Because I guess you don't send a phone back to the manufacturer after testing it passed the durability test?
Na, IKEA ad
Preordered this only because I hate my pixel 6 as it keeps crashing and wanted something new. S22 ultra price versus s23 ultra wants that much different and I'll have this phone for at least 3 years. The double memory fo free + galaxy watch 5 for 100 quid + 150 additional trade in value for the pixel 6 trade in was just a bonus.
Keep up the focus on greenwashing, Zack! 👍 Love your sense of humor 🙂 Greetings from Denmark.
👍
LET ME HAVE THE PHONE PLZZ 🙏 IT STILL GOOD TO ME
Talking about upgrades? I used a s6 edge till last year, from launch
I'm watching this guy's videos since a long time now and just waiting for him to change his note 10 😂
im guessing the first pic selfie was the s23 but man its crazy how close in quality they are
Iam waiting for new oneplus 11 series test
Algorithm Comment
Everytime I see a video on an S23 Ultra , I miss the Note line
One Plus 11 next plz
$1200? You can get this for $599 pretty easily. I hope nobody is paying $1200 for this phone 😬
Nice casio 👍
Yes i got the ad for the phone. Once on my tv then on my phone when I went to make this comment.
It's not a samsung durability test video without zack snapping the s pen in half 😂
Ouch as someone who can’t afford that phone I felt that scratch even if it’s for quality control purposes 😢😂
Many channels are coming you now and they knows that everyone loves you so they are uploading the videos earlier to get viewers. I think you have to be faster to upload both videos 🙏
Yup, I got a Samsung commercial for this exact phone before the video started.
I really appreciate your work and tbh your criticism in this case. Samsung pays huge amounts of money into advertising. I'm not against advertising, but what Samsung does is misleading users, and not only when it comes to recycling.
Jerry my favorite YouTuber 👍🏽 may God bless me so that I can have this phone I love it 🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲
0:20 The one time where the knife is not needed. Satisfaction has truly left the building...
4:07 i also noticed laser autofocus now has a blue dot instead of a red one
Tell me this dude has an ASMR channel. His voice is entrancing.
2 min of samsung advertising, boring
Haha I did get a Samsung ad on this video.
come on jerry tear down the phone 😁
I have watched all the durability tests on this channel but I still cry every time the blade touches the aluminium side walls and when Zack does the bending tests 😢
my heart jumped to the stylus snap!
I just placed my pre order thanks zack
Too be honest it's your money you can burn it smoke it many Peaple may have  problem with it I am poor yet still afford the average flagship now and again but still tho its nice to see someone with money smash everything new that comes to market
As a matter of fact, the first ad I got before the video started was a Samsung ad for the fold 😂😂
See I would keep my phone for longer, but it seems my Zflip 3 is beginning to have a lot of noticeable deep grooved right in the crease. Started to worry me.
this is why ive moved on to poco. i bought a poco f4gt and damn it slaps alot of flagship phones from big brand. they need to realise that not everyone cares about a camera.
Hey Zack, I have never owned an android phone. I know Apple is one of the worst at pushing us users to upgrade! I wish they would work at making phones better not better cameras! Thank you for sharing this video with us! I look forward to watching your next video of this phone.
You talk trash how Samsung spend billions on marketing yet you do the same thing right after.. smh
try to play this video beside s22 ultra video ! you will see how much scamed we are !
The main reason I'm considering upgrading after 4 1/2 years is that the battery and screen on my Note 9 are dying (battery especially). It's a shame they make these things so hard to repair (and the fancy but pointless curved screens just add to the price). I guess they'd rather market new phones and brag about being green. Just don't look too hard at the repairability and fine print! The price of these phones is insulting too, especially when they have double storage only on pre-order, and a base S23 Ultra with only 8GB RAM (or the base S23 with only UFS 3.1).
Yeah...I got a Samsung ad
Thank you Jerry
So much biting criticism directed at Samsung in one video. wow
hi
You are a barbarian
I did get a samsung ad at the beginning of this video. Thank God it wasn't one of those mobile game ads though. Those are insulting.
Love watching your videos in 4K. Great content matching great quality. Perfection!
It ain't just Samsung that seems to have stopped innovating. I feel that, outside of foldables, we have actually peaked when it comes to smartphone design.
Deeper grooves at level.....   We all love to here this!
My goodness Zack, this one hurt for some reason. I suppose it is because I really like that phone.
🔥
Thumb up to sumsung for caring about environment. Very strong phone to pass the bending test Like you to make video on Huawei phone
I love how no brand is immune to Jerry’s roasting 🙅🏼‍♂️🫠😍
Beside those model explode...!!! 😂😂😂😂
I don’t have YT premium but I got no ads during this video 😳
No need to break S pen every time.. its always same
Recently i upgrade from a Note 8 to a Note 20 Ultra (refurbished). Why?  1. Antena problems: i was experiencing very annoying problems with cellphone signal lost, everybody around me was making phone calls and i was in SOS.  2. Battery: i have been the only owner of that phone, replace the battery for a new one roughly 16 months ago, but i bought a battery case 3. Heat: the phone was really getting hot while charging  So i started to see options, im a great fan and user of the note quirks, so between the note 10+ and the note 20 ultra, I decided for the last because price wasn't a huge gap, and I needed the micro SD card.   Overall, I'm pretty happy with my not so new Note 20 Ultra, I charge it once a day, pretty fast, better rear cameras than note 10, and this will be my phone for the next 4-5 years, later I will probably swap the motherboard for a exynos and install a custom rom, and that will give me the phone for a 2-3 years more.
should change the channel name to JerryRoastsEverything. my man ain't no chillin' 😂
Jerry, it’s time to upgrade lol
petition for Jerry to give me a durability test phone  Please like so that Jerry can see this Please
I did get a samsung ad
I still use my Samsung S8. Super phone. :)
@pbk found it only scratches at 8 with deeper grooves at 9
Did  say I was not goint to do this but I am leanimg towards upgrading  my s22 ultra for the s23 ultra
I want the fold 5 to have this kind of screen instead of a narrow screen.
Do the OnePlus 11 next! Did OP finally get their poop in a group and improve the durability of their phone?
Yes! I got an ad for this phone on this video.
looks like no need to upgrade yet from my s10
I'm quite content staying with my S20 ultra, its a nice phone but I'll wait
Seeing this from my OP 7 Pro still intact.
I tried the Ultra's camera out in the store the other day against my Pixel 6 Pro.... It absolutely sucked in comparison and couldn't hold a candle to it at full zoom, it looked like the Samsung was in an earthquake zone by comparison...
There's a better thing you can do for the planet besides buy this "green" phone.  It's called "keep-the-one-you-have".  That way, no dyes have to be made, not the unnatural dyes, or even the natural dyes.    Like Jerry, I'm still rocking a note 10 plus and I currently have no plans to upgrade.  I've already replaced my battery and charging port, the two things that commonly wear out.
Sorry, not your biggest fan. You stress test these phones way more than any person would in normal use. You remind me of Gallagher, Comic Known for Smashing Watermelons.
the pain I get seeing these vids 😭 but the way I keep coming back for more is a paradox even to mee
Still rocking my Note 8, over 5 years use and still going strong apart from battery degradation. I was looking to upgrade but its not worth it for me, I love the design of S23 Ultra and im glad they kept the same design, the internals have been improved especially for us UK residents, Snapdragon Gen 2, 256GB (512GB if pre ordered) faster RAM, also the screen has slightly less curve. Cameras are so good now that there's no point in changing your phone every year, as Zack has just shown.
sorry jerry i just ordered it my S7+ just gaved up. mine is green 512gigs and tabS8 ULTRA 512gigs with ear buds pro free with power brick free and smart watch 5pro free.
My S10+ is 4 years now. Longest time I have ever had a phone. Last year I almost bought the S22 Ultra. But I decided to wait until the S23 ultra came.  So NOW is the time to trade in the old, but still good, S10+, and get the ned S23 Ultra. I can't wait to get my hands on it 👌😁
I think a lot of that R&D is going towards flexy screens. It's kind of nice to see they aren't trying to add features for features sake. I have had older Samsung phones with all sorts of gimmicks that never really worked or even seemed all that useful in the first place. I am not sure where smartphones really go from here.
I don't know which picture is from which phone. But the picture on the left is way better and it's not even close.
About two months ago I upgraded from note 9 to s22 ultra because of the battery . That's the only reason. The note 9 was very good
I don't even care about phones anymore, I still watch your videos.
The dude wants to shame Samsung for making great phones, then immediately sucks Elon co¢k by praising Tesla for not advertising?! Has this Id!ot seen those cars at all?!
Yes i did get a samsung ad😅
not a fan of the green washing, they could definitely afford to do better :/
I've also still got my note 10+ and I feel another unmentioned thing about new phones is they've removed the SD card support, in favor of cloud storage. Which they then charge you for.   Just all about the money grab
Can't wait for your next video.
It's cool, but not $1200 cool.
I feel that if Samsung was sincere about the environment, that would not only give 4 years Android updates and 5 years security updates, but also offer one time battery replacement after 3 years.
Please check durability of huwaie kunlun glass.. because they said its unbreakable.. please check
Running a Note 9 in a Spigen & it's still got more features and a more slender chassis than any phone on the market today. All-day battery life w/moderate use and looks like it was released only yesterday. Awesome vid. Sub'd. Thank you for what you do!
The way u pick that pen and break it LMAO so good.
Hi! Can you do the Oneplus 11? :) I'm eyeing with it, but the lest few durability tests were really bad for Oneplus
I have to be careful with my s pen it broke like a rotten wooden stick
Ooouuch!!! Yeah I am now closing my eyes😑😑
savage...
Upgrading to S23 Ultra. I've had my Note 9 for 4 years now. It's time.
Who else got a Samsung ad on this video?
Good job
wow
Please help me stop myself from snapping my S-PEN like this. !!!!! 😭😭😫😫😫😫😳😳😳😳😱😱😱😱
when did i move down from unboxing videos to durability and subsequent teardown of new gadgets? I dont know. But i am never going back the normal route ever.
Hate how the microphone hole is right next to the sim tray hole, im sure there is a good percentage of people poking that other hole first up
I beat you Jerry, i have a 3rd hand note 8 and it is working fine
This is the most honest and truthful s23 review!
my phone is now 3 years old, just like the one before it. I'm probably getting this phone.
Literally would not have moved on from my Note 8 except the repair shop "goofed" on replacing battery and fingerprint sensor. Did not buy a new phone from that shop, despite the discount to "make good" on the mistake.
I get poco advertisement
Casio!
Hopefully we get a rollable phone in the summer. Foldables are weird and ugly but a rollable would be a different story
3+ year team is the best team.
Left selfie picture looks much better.
3:19 "The S Pen is useful for a lot of things!" *snaps it in half*
A true masterpiece of a video 😂❤🎉
Bro just destroyed a 1200$ phone
Get   👉   ☻️
😂😂😂  go and buy that recycled phone 😂 recycled plastic and glass for 1500€ 👎👎
hates marketing and advertising. does marketing and advertising in his own video. You can't make this shit up.
Next year for half price was a epic line 😎
Yes we're sure, the left one was taken with the note 10 and the right one is taken with the s23 ultra, the difference is quite noticeable
I am still glad that I took S22 ultra in preorder. This year the deal is worse and phone more expensive. Not interested. Hopefully S22 will last me at least 5 years
Loved this case but the S22 Ultra case was 50 GBP which is too much for any device IMO, that was launch price though.
Did anybody notice that the time on his watch is within 3 minutes of each other?
OMG yessss!!! lol Love it!! I love Samsung but shit haha.
The way he broke the S pen like it's nothing 😂
I recently moved on from my P30 Pro. I loved the IR blaster on that phone.  Can’t get a phone now like it.  Got the 13 Pro now, first Apple in years.  Missing a few things that I liked, but does work pretty well.
Rip to all S-Pens featured on this channel 😅
Goddamnit your mom is a smart lady
make durability test for OnePlus 11
I still think the galaxy s5 was the pinnacle of phone design.   Water tight gaskets, easily replaceable battery.. headphone jack.    I wish things had veered in that direction back then.. but the allure of the fruit is too great for man.  Too bad, makes you wonder how things could have been.
Samsung innovation went to the trash 4 years ago
Sorry, my dude, but there was a massive difference between those two selfies' picture quality.
5:58 as far as durability goes Samsung has never had any issues.  Besides the model that exploded...LOL, well said.
Another reason to stick with my samsung s10 5g
Im really curious tho which one is the s23 and which is the note selfie
I'd say their Foldables are where their innovation is going ATM.
I'm upgrading from the s10+ I use and abuse my phone, so much so that I have insurance on it, but oh my god that s pen snapped, like it I were to leave it out accidentally and sat on it. They should make it a BIT more sturdy
I think the days of a yearly upgrade are long gone now, unless you own an iPhone 😳
I've still got my Note 9. I'm considering looking at an upgrade in the near future but it's still mostly going pretty strong. I have to say however this may have been my first watching of a durability test and it was stressful to watch. I'll be back for the next one.
How much does dbrand spend on advertising?
I love how you call out Samsung. But people should know, the ad-money does go into your favourite reviewers hyping up every new flagship like it is worth buying. I've only see overwhelmingly positive reviews. No one calling out the 1080p-display on the regular models for example. My S8 from 5-6 years ago had a higher resolution. Think about that. They do not only not innovate. They remove features so you buy the Ultra.
Can you compare this to red magic 8 pro? I'm low-key curious which phone has thinner bezels
Yes, there is a Samsung S23 advertisement after this video. 👍🏻
@Dbrands is also spending the same, if not more percentage wise relative to it's revenue.
It is really sad that there is no expandable storage with an 1000+ Dollar phone
Compared to Apple Samsung is actually innovating quite a lot. Apple is stilling selling 60hz screens for 1000 bucks with no USB-C.
Are the Teardown skins coming to the S23 series? 😄
I don't have enough money to buy another cell-phone and you have the luxuryto destroy a new one 🤧😢😢😢
Jerry the cheap ass
Every scratch touch my heart 😢
Cant shit on Samsung to much on the innovation cause they are probably putting alot of money in to the fold and flip series and those are pretty innovative.
I find it a shame that your only job is to scratch new phones that could be used by other people, only to find out that how hard the glass is…
Still waiting on that Red Hydrogen One phone tear down
That thing is so thick but can't fit a headphone jack? 🤡 And flagship means having a hole in the display?
Too much crying about the 10%  natural dye BS. Just fast forward to the bending of the phone and move on. Phone has already been disassembled by PBK without constant comments about recycling this and that, and with no the hint people need to keep the phones longer so less is recycled. Sorry, UT dude; I'll purchase as many I want and believe me $1200 is just a drop in the bucket but I don't pay $1200 since I trade in the previous model (S22U). Marketing is not manipulating me, I like new things and I can afford them, I get them. And the last thing I would do is purchase a piece of plastic covering to cover the phone. HOW RECYCLABLE IS A DBRAND SKIN? I hear enough about recycling from certain idiots in a certain city bordering on MD and VA; don't need it from you. However, I will recycle when appropriate and hate garbage outside of the dumps. But YOU OVERDUE it!
Jerry got a new watch
Samsung ad
Samsung doesn't sell phones only if one would remember and thus need a large marketing fund. Tesla doesn't need marketing because it has no real competitors
wow samsung survived the burn test👍
Тормоз
Funny enough, I did not get a Samsung commercial on this video. I got a Google Pixel add lol
Chargerless phones the future damn evolving humanity
Let's talk about the environmental impact of destroying new phones lol
can i have your destroyed s23 ultra. i can fix it and use it
The roast was kinda unnecessary. Definitely for the clout from apple fanboys.I think this guy forgot about the fold 4. Samsung is the only manufacturer innovating in the smartphone race.
Can you give me the phone😊😊
I'm sure the people being run over by self-driving Teslas appreciate all the money they spend on innovation 😌
Finally
Its all about, whos got the latest phone, or a new phone is a nice to have. I got hauwei p30 lite new edition in 2020 and i wil use it till it stops working. Does everything most basic phones do.
I still have my trusty S10+, last of the S lineup with an audio jack. I still love it and see no reason to upgrade and even if i did, i'd need to upgrade to the Ultra, because the regular S23 and the S23+ don't offer any actual difference other than 120Hz.  The only reason i'm thinking of upgrading is because my phone is getting...slower, interestingly. I factory reset it regularly, but it still has issues with registering my inputs when i type, it lags behind. Sometimes doesn't load pages until i clean the ram, even if there's still 3GB left unused. Battery still lasts 2 days under normal usage, which is pretty much the same as when i got.
I currently own S21 Ultra and its not much different. maybe 10% which is not enough to make me want to upgrade.
When that box cutter comes out, I know it's going to be painful...
I'm still using S9 but a lack of security updates forced me to install custom ROM. It's a nice adventure if like trying new things. I have chosen a more light weight ROM and the phone is much faster than it used to be. And I can enjoy new features of Android 13 even on 5 years old phone. There are also disadvantages like bad camera quality, lost Samsung health app, so no more SpO2 and heart rate monitor. But overall it is fully working phone no freezes or crashes etc. Also I'm not a heavy user, so battery is still usable. But this year I'm going to upgrade. I'm still deciding between S23+ or S22+ or Pixel 7 or maybe Pixel 7 Pro (but 7 Pro is too huge for me.)
Thank you so much Jerry ... thump up . 👍
Adblock :)
no charger,  no 3mm audio jack,  no sd card slot,  no optical or capacitive fingerprint sensor,  no eyeris scanner,  no heartbeat sensor,   no earphones,  no snapdragon (till now).  The company is truly innovative (backwards) 🤓🤓🤡
I've never seen a phone do so well during the burn test on this channel. Those pixels just kept on working.
3:15 : oh look a S-pen 3:21 : nvm
As an SPen owner, my anxiety peaks and I lose a year off my life whenever you break it
can you make normal 16:9 videos? you create bezels on bezelless devices...
I miss my note 10
At what hardness do the camera lens scratch?
Always quality reviews . . . Honest at least!
just a nice idea i was thinking about is to test phones that come with cases inside the box also with the cases on them because i think most people will be using it and it also gives an advantage to companies who care about the customers
I guess you judge this smartphone just from the spec sheet! It is much better than the data suggests.
i got an s23 ad on this video.
The screen is E5 which is indeed newer than last years. Now whether its worth upgrading from a S22U, nah. But cant blanket state stuff either without doing some research. Food for thought.
samsung died after note 9. there is no way they can come out after Exynos scam
Guy's, should we let the cat outta the bag? 😏 Let's not! Zach has no reason not to upgrade this time around!  Let him do the teardown, you guys will know what I am talking about! BATTERY! BATTERY! BATTERY!
"S-Pen probably my favourite part" And snaps in half 😂
I got a Cheetos ad 🎉
no wonder i love this guy 😂🔥🔥🔥❤️
I would love an microSD Slot
6:15 "maybe you buy it next year for the half price" I don't know how the prices are going down in the US, but at least in Germany the smartphones doesn't loses value anymore. I wanted to buy a S22 Ultra these days, but this costs already around 1300€ with more than 128 GB. So I did bought the S23 Ultra 512 GB Via the Samsung pre-order promotion and paid so only 1280€, for the latest model with much more storage capacity. The prices for old Android smartphones are no longer falling as they did before the chip crisis.
I  use ad block. No commercials in years.
There is Destructive testing, and then there is what you do; Annihilative testing. :D
The way he broke the s pen 🥲
Haber si me lo mandas asi  sin spen me sirve y con las pruebas que hiciste lo acepto
is this phone not very similar to s22 ultra ?
Why not upgrade and get the money back plus a great watch and new buds for free.
Left selfie was better
I preordered this because AT&T is giving me a $1000 credit for my s20. I plan in keeping it for minimum 3 years.
Haven't gotten a ad in quite some time now thx to Youtube premium or ad blockers
Are you sure it was a S23 Ultra? I could have swear it was the S22 Ultra 😉🤣
Help Turkey pls we need it :'(
God tier watch!!!!!!!!!!!!
Do you sell any of the phones you durability test?
Thank you for bringing out the reality of so called "green focus" companies. What a joke. I only buy Samsung tablets these days. And my S6 Lite came only after using a Galaxy Tab A for 7 years. I don't buy Apple or Samsung phones. I don't necessarily need a company that's green, just one that doesn't try to BS me...
Still rocking my 10 plus. Have major burn-in on the status bar but I don't see a compelling reason to switch.
To shoot the moon it uses the 10 times zoom camera and not the 200 mp one you mentioned
I'm just going to buy this model because I'm going from a 300 usd model, it's a good buy for who doesn't have a similar phone, liking or not the note 10 had a 1k~ msrp
Why not do it with Huawei Mate 50 Pro
Zero innovation every year
Looks like a great upgrade for the s8/note8 owners
How can people say Samsung isn't innovating? They improve the flip and fold series every year. Ads? What ads? Lol YT premium is worth every penny.
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Selling the same phone twice and still expensive and you think not including the charger the price would be lower. That's why I no longer buy there phones. The last gaming phone he tested looks more appealing
yes got a S23 Samsung  !!!
Jerry sir I'm a big fann please give away a phone 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
I switched from the Galaxy Note 10 plus to the S23 Ultra and wow, that's a difference like night and day! Only the extra weight and the somewhat bulkier appearance I do not like in comparison, also I liked the design of the 10+ better. A practical improvement is also that powerbutton and volume rocker have moved to the right side. I'm excited about the S23 Ultra and it was really time to switch.
Surprisingly I got an Apple ad lol
Upgrading every year? Whoever thinks that is normal is mental. :D I'm still rocking with my Zenphone 5 i purchased in early 2019 And is perfectly functional. But i also live in a shithole country with a crappy economics. No room to throw out money on the window.
i like it, but im happy with my S21 Ultra for another year. Besides, i want my next phone to have expandable storage.
😭
why so fast?
My rog phone 2 died last year so I got an emergency moto stylus g2 2020 for free. My plan was to get a new phone asap, but it's just as fast as my old Samsung galaxy s8 in benchmarks. It's almost stupid to upgrade a phone now unless you're a hardcore mobile gamer. Even midrange phones are just as fast and take just as good photos as flagships from a year ago.  They really need to up their game.
So you're moaning about samsung not being green enough... but then you are wrecking it, making it useless and  fit for the bin ♻️🤣.... and I seem to remember you are totally taken in with elon musks' marketing bullshit and vapour ware, or is it just something to talk about for clicks. Just phone companies don't fool you? Have  you decided to buy a telsa truck yet to haul its battery pack round🤦🏻‍♂️🤪
What's good about your videos is that you always give an honest opinion
Am i the only one who skips past the scratching with the razor blade part?
The wealthy and powerful did a good job trashing the planet and are now expecting those at the bottom to sacrifice their own stability and even lives to fix it. It's why I can't (other than being a good steward to the environment around me when feasible) take anything being said or done seriously. The "fixes" look more like the cash and power grabs they've always been.
I really wanna listen to your advice but it's obvious Samsung isn't paying you and once they pay you some of that billions of dollars for advertisement you'll be telling us how awesome Samsung is
Lol I have my Note 10+ 2
I cant wait for the tear down video. I'm still rocking a Note 9 that I was thinking about finally replacing, mainly for a better camera. I'd have to unlearn unlocking from the rear sensor though.
upload s48
Tesla is run by a buffoon, not a great example :/
Ad is about mortgage 😂
I don't get ads since I use Brave browser. even on youtube. Try Brave...
Jerry Let's take a picture of the phone from the back in next video
I had a iPhone 6s for so long….. I finally upgraded to the 12 pro a year 😂
do one plus durability video pls
The absolute best worst ASMR sound with the metal, it's torture and I love it ❤️
“For anyone who does buy this model, wether is this year for full price, or next year for half price”  I’m dead🤣
me chilling with my almost 5 years old galaxy note 9
Oh I've been waiting for this video even more than the launch by Samsung, now it's time for the year down. Thanks Zack
this looks like a very good phone but I don't think it's worth the price
We know which one came when because if time in your watch. 😁👍🏼
I'm upgrading from s20 ultra but still feel like some features are missing which were in Note 9
Samsung has a history of taking a break from any actual innovation. The S21U to S22U saw a huge power increase. The Evens are the better and the odds are slight improvements.   As far as worth it to switch? It took me a few years to go from the Galaxy S9 to the S22U. I saw zero point. The older ones before the number shift the Odds was the better and the evens was slightly better versions.   Apple on the other hand has never impressed me. The 13PM was okay but not that much different from the 12PM and the 14PM is a huge waste of money.
You killing me with the scratching 😢
Could you do a video on the Librem 5 USA
I got two samsung ads, one before your video then one after. Then one from Mous advertising their Mous case *Ahem*....dbrand...
Just bought an S22 Ultra for $700 to replace my godawful OP3 Pro. If 200MP is the only real upgrade, then I'd say don't bother. The S22 Ultra isn't even that mindblowing but happy with the cheap price of last years model!
No Samsung Ad here. Ad Blocker does his job.
The way he snapped that S Pen was brutal 😫
I literally felt sorry for the S23 Ultra
hey sir,can you pass me the iphone6
5:52 got an ad when I searched for this video.
Hey Jerry.. Can u send me that tested S23 to me pls?? It's been 3yrs and I can't afford a new phone now. Let me know if u can Jerry.  Love from India!
My S9 still in perfect condition, and it has SD-card slot and 3.5mm jack. I bet it would last at least 2 more years (maybe even 3 or 4). Meanwhile, Samsung is being jerky with customers (presently on r/SamsungMobileUS they organized Q&A where they were shadowbanning all the comments they don't like); produces exactly the same phones year after year, without any options or variability (I just want SD-card slot and 3.5mm jack!!!!). Currently I don't see much difference between Samsung and Apple. In case  my phone suddenly dies/lost, I guess I'll buy either iPhone with usb-type-c or some Motorolla/Pixel.
screw the Ultra, too uncomfortable. Show us S23
I had enough hearing " scratches at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7 ". I'd like to hear from jre "scratches at a level 9 with deeper grooves at a level 10".
Smug
That was tough.. but, fair. 😁👍🏼
Note 10+ club for the win. The only phone that really looks worth getting is the Z Fold but until they can find a way to make a more durable screen I'm holding off. I'm not sure if it would be possible but my idea would be to use the normal glass screens from their flagship phones and connect them together with the part of the Fold screen that bends. That way like 90% of the screen is just like what we have now and the rest is that plastic stuff.
Watching on my S22Ultra 🙄
Dumb video!
textures are details are clearly better on the right one...
Finally an honest youtuber and not a paid samsung review shill, that tells us as it is... Dumb as people falling for marketing and upgrading every year, I'm not going to reward samsung with my hard earned $$$, till I see some innovation.
He literally broke the pen like a pop tart 😂
I got a s23 ultra ad 😂😂😂😂
How can  be cruel like this 😂🥲
i dont know how to explain this but the right side image makes you look prettier and the left makes you look manlier
that phone with the case seems thick
Please do such type of videos for iPhones and other brands too
👌👌👌
Had my Xiaomi for 3 years now, maybe it's time for an upgrade, always missed Samsung ever since I swapped.
Use recycled parts but replacement parts cost a fortune. E waste in more dangerous than a small piece of plastic…
This year for full price or next year for half price.
*Oh my god* ....this is what i was waiting for to see S23 ultra rigged off😜😁🤣🤣 *tearing Samsung apart* waiting for *taking Samsung apart*
Next teardown s23u
sinner phones delivered to Jerry's hell for punishment 😭😭
I think you've answered your own question here. With your poll showing most people don't upgrade every year, having the latest internals and features (along with the base model now being 256gb) should actually help people keep their phones longer. Also to the regular user your note 10+ would have been replaced already, yours is only still here due to having a 2nd one laying around. Of course they could do more on the recycled materials front, but some progress is still better than none.
this handset look totally bullshit this edge corner gives you definitely disadvantage than other mobiles the pinted edges are the most weak point to damage when accident while round corner almost absorb that hit stupid idea of Samsung company which ll cost costumer in further future
I see a great improvement in selfie camera compared to my Note20 Ultra.
Can't wait for the next video
Some times your video cause great pain to me especially when you broke that s pen
upgraded to the s23 ultra 1tb from my note 9 512gb that I had since sept 2018, my note 9 started to get laggy and not that great battery life. like only lasting a few hours with a full charge. I am going to miss the audio jack and misro sd slot.
When i pressed the wid, i got insta s23 ultra ad from a countrywide storebrand 😅
Apple and Samsung just know how to rip people off, and seriously their lousy designs are too boring according to this modern day and age.
Can you please😌 do  teardown video of s23 for students like me planing to upgrade after waiting for looooong time.
Man! I love your videos. Lol You keep it real!
Rocket surgeon!
Llore viendo este video con mi s20 fe en la mano jaja
Awaiting Oneplus 11 test
I was using Note9 since it came out and battery wasn't holding up to my heavy use, had to charge phone every 12 hours. So I got this one on feb 2nd in my pocket. S23 ultra battery holds 2 days of constant usage
There are child slaves mining Cobalt in Africa, and you don't mention it.  Mothers holding babies while mining  these toxic materials, and you and your compatriots worry about how much recycled glass is used.  Stop with virtue signaling.
Shots fired 😳
I think this is only one of many phones which has survived usable after the tests
For me at last samsung s 23 ultra and first time with snapdragon in Europe s23 ultra
He has prooven that samsung is scaming you. You couldn't even see the difference between the pictures taken by the s23 ultra and the note 10 plus
You might be wondering: "hey Jerry, why are you calling yourself Jerry when your actual name is Zack?" 🤣
Funnily enough I got an Oppo ad
2:16 I know it by the time displayed on the watch
Regular dollars worth of advertising 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Better Segway than linus
Hey Zack, how many S-Pens have you broken over the years? 😅
Yep! Samsung add. How did you know?
When are we getting the dbrand teardown skin?
"Besides the model that exploded",got me good😂
Very nice
Have we ever had a phone before that lasted 60 seconds and did not have a burn mark? I'm just curious what Innovation caused that?
My Samsung M20 is still kicking after 5+ Years, can´t complain about that. But they could do better like, one always can :)
Of course Zach is the first one to be brutally honest about how not exciting the phone is and all the green washing. His take was the main reason I was anticipating this video.
Upgrade ur phone. This may be compatible  for u 😊
Greenwasted🌬️
Props to you using a Note 10 for quite a "long" amount of time. These devices really can last quite a long time if taken care of and if *hopefully* Samsung doesn't kill them with software updates
S23U ad straight at start
Jerry subtly telling Samsung still not buying this one is my favorite part of the video 😅
“The S-Pen is my favorite part” *SNAP!* 😂
wow how resistant, what do you do with the damaged phone you throw it away, could you please give it to me
Phones have pretty much peaked. Had my s8+ for over 5 years and upgraded to the s22 ultra back in september. Big difrence of course but now the only thing these brands can do every year is a little bit faster and camera
I have the Samsung Galaxy Note 9, I've had it since December 18, 2018 so it's 5 years old. I do think it might be time for an upgrade soon.
The most eco-friendly phone is the one you already own.
"Our good friend the S-pen probably my favourite part of the ultra lineup. the s pen is useful for many things"    CRACK TICK🙂 continues casually.....
It is green washing ,all right ! ! !
I hope you're going to recycle that?
I was hanging on to my Note 10+ since it was launched. It was such a good phone that I lost all interest in phones in the last years, until I broke it. Went for the s22u last year, expecting to have a wonderfull experiente for years to come :)) but...no, I was really disappointed in many ways. I could not like that phone, no matter how hard I tried. And now went for the s23u. I've been using it for 1 week now. And yes, this is the phone I was expecting, it's one of the best, if not maybe the best Samsung phone ever made. This is the one to upgrade to.
As a note 10+ user, I guess I'll just upgrade when you upgrade 👌
That physically hurt by soul
PLEASE test the Xiaomi 13 Pro. Thanks
Samsung S23 advert 😆 as you said
I've decided to upgrade from my s22 ultra to s26 ultra whenever it comes out for the same reasons.
2:09 I think the one on the right is the S23 ultra It has a lot more details
I miss my Note 9, have a Fold 3 right now and after only a year the screen's delaminating and cracks nicely, and I out of case clean phone down weekly...... Only reason I may get an Ultra is It'll cost a couple hundred to upgrade.
They can fit a stylus IN the phone but no SD card slot?
give me that s23, i'm still using s9 for last 5 years..
Not good enough to upgrade to a 12 hundred bucks phone but tearing them apart is ok! LOL.. Thanks for making this video. Now I've decided to keep my Note10+ until you decided to change yours. 😎
I just upgraded after having used S7 Edge for almost 6 years :) Hoping the S23 Ultra will last longer :)
Started with an ad for the S23, skip.. Watched the vid and both ads at the end. The S23 made a second appearance. You've been targeted. 3 years between phones? My last Alcatel lasted me 13 yrs.
I responded to the poll and mentioned that I've had my P20 Pro for over 4 years now. While still going strong it is starting to show it's age and I was at odds to what to get next to do me for a while. It was between this phone and the new Google pixel. Still not sure which to go for? What's everyone's thoughts if they care to weigh in?
I have been using Samsung S22 for almost a year now with a DBrand Case with Teardown skin. The skin still looks brand new and I just love to see the inside of my phone from the outside. Thanks Zack for the Teardown skin.
Thanks for this video, thanks to you, now I can save more money that this is not worth for a upgrade yet 😂
I got an ad for this exact phone before the video!
@Jerry pls send me one, i can't afford😣
2:12 the left picture looks better
Samsung watching the video 😬
Thanks, I have S21U I'm planning to buy it IPhone 15 Pro Max to c what's new
Samsung: We want to be green look how green we are. Samsung: No you cannot fix your phone , fuck off and buy a new one.
Thanks, I have S21U I'm planning to buy it IPhone 15 Pro Max to c what's new
Please do the basic size of Galaxy S23 too!
There is 0 reason for me to upgrade my phone. . . To me this is literally the same as the 22 ultra 😅 no major ground breaking improvements. Such a disappointing fact. Have smart phones hit their peak?? Is this the best we're going to see 👀 find out next year when they use 10.00001% recycled ♻️ pigment and charge another grand or so 🤔
Thanks, I have S21U I'm planning to buy it IPhone 15 Pro Max to c what's new
"Cardboard can be abrasive to rails." Proceeds to carve out using steel knife.
You know something is on, when you see a CASIO WATCH!!!
Welcome to the jarryrig durability and roast show
2:27 that's a good sarcastic comment 🤣
You're the man, man! Showing the reviewers the mirror for the fake praises they sing for every new models released and here you are bashing this new launch by comparing it to the G.O.A.T Note 20 that is being used since the last 3.5 years!!   /takes a bow🙇🏻‍♂
Hey Jerry can you please send me one of those beautiful phones that you destroyed  They are new and still work compared to my old S4 thank you
I upgraded from S9+ to S22 Ultra, for the same reason I always upgrade. The screens eventually suffer from burn in and whites end up not being white anymore. Also the oleophobic coating starts to degrade. My S22 Ultra is less than a year old, and already has minor burn in and the oleophobic coating has degraded at the lower part of the screen. If you think your old screen hasn't burned in, go watch a burn in video at full screen on YouTube. You'll at the very least see some at the top and the bottom.
Why the fuck does it not have an SD card slot?
What
5:32 You can see the hz where the burn is, you just count 1 second and the screen updates, it's super rare to see.
Hmm
ah the guilt of buying a phone with such a price, hard to justify when I could be helping the poor. I could say I'll use it for 6+ years like my current phone and over that time, the price will have been nothing.
that screen handled the heat so damn good
Zack can you please test s23 base model please
"Like Tesla does with cars". What exactly did Tesla innovate other than having its shares sold to finance Twitter acquisition and never ending 'next year' promises of features that were being promised as long ago as 2017?
You got only one unit this time? 😓
Give it to me 🥹🥺
I never any amoled screen bear's 60 seconds of heat from your lighter
No ads for me 😂 YT premium
my note 10+ has completed 2 years service, its just as fast as the day it came out the box, the screens got a few level 6 scratches on, apart from it not getting Android 13 i'm very happy with it and have no plans on upgrading until next year  Unfortunately debrand doesn't seem to stock the note10 cases any more
I got an ad from Mous that included the Samsung s23 ultra
Is your note 10 still getting updates?
I'll be sticking with my s21 ultra for now.   Maybe s25 ultra
I got an iPhone ad on this video.
Tbh you could've dubbed over your S22 Ultra durability test and we wouldn't have noticed a difference
Upgraded from a S10+ to this one. Really happy, nothing bad to say about it
I got an ad for some cheesy horror movie on this video.
NOOO MY FAVORITE MOBILE
Zach is eyeing the Fold 5. He might upgrade then.  Unless of course he might have to mortgage his house and tesla cybertruck to finance the Fold 5, he might not upgrade.
It hurts to see this video Just give me a phone i am poor i cannot afford (I am using 7 yeas old phone)
Give me that broken phone 🌝
savage
Finally the video I was waiting for and I am looking forward to that teardown video. I am going to pick up te 23 Ultra today.
half price ? brand new s20 ultra is almost same proce as this D:
If the s pen gets broken for some reason will the s23 ultra still be water resistant or will the water get into the phone
why does every person who put a case on the phone never show the lines on the front of the phone???????????
This guy sounds so satisfying 😅
Where is the finger print test 🔥 🙏
So many phones tested but non has been a satisfactory for you. You need a phone made of water.😂
Big like for the F-91W.
you've probably answered this many times previously, and i've missed it - but why don't you test how waterproof the phones really are, particularly those with an IP rating?
Still rocking the Note10+, Its going strong, but showing its age in some places. Mainly the S-pen disconnects from time to time, and the battery still gets through the day, but only just on some days with intense use
You will not buy this phone next year for half the price.
2:34 my ears are vibrating
why dont phone manufactureres add rubber plugs into the charging ports to stop water or dust ingress? every phone i have always gets harder and harder to charge because of lint getting into the port
nice choosing of words!
I bought the XS max a few months after it came out and I still have it today with a refreshed battery. In my opinion innovation has gone stagnant. I’ll keep my XS Max until support has ended then I’ll upgrade.
I just got the s23 ultra moving from pixel 6 I plan on keeping it a while.
Your Rig test must get GMM certification
I am only here for Zack’s hair!!
Jerry: “S-pen is probably my favorite part of the ultra line up” “Instantly snaps s-pen in half”
me here still with my sumsung s6 and it still works
Yay, was waiting for the durability test from Jerry!
All this earth friendly BS is nothing but BS. If they really wanted to be earth Friendly the stop coming out with the same crap every year. How bout instead innovating for 2 years an coming out with something then. Meaning every 2 or 3 years. Same with TVs.. That would be better then the BS "Earth Friendly" crap done now
i literally got an advertisement of the samsung s23 from mous case
The s23 ultra in my opinion is like an engine swap. Yeah it’s got the same body. But it performs wayy better than an s22.
@jerry, for past years i've really been with your opinion regarding switching Note10+ to any new phone. Because it was just complete. When i've ordered s23u, I wasn't sure that it's good idea, but after couple days using it i can tell that this is really the one that can replace old great Note10+. Battery, camera, performance, low heat, features. This is upgrade. This is not like revolution. Even thou i still have sentiment to mine note10+
I actually got on ad for Samsung on the same phone. I found it quite ironic
I got a mazda commercial 😊
Me who is happy about the next teardown video but would be happier if there's a video about oppo Find X5 or x6
Left picture is from NOTE10+ & Right picture is from S23ULTRA, cuz it's wider .. 😉
Not gonna lie the difference in the selfies were a bit hard to spot. The right looked better and the right is the s23..how much better? Not enough to charge a huge amount like they are.
I'm on a "switch" plan with my provider that lets me pay for roughly half the phone on monthly instalments through a year, and then I switch to the newer one. I've been waiting for samsung to switch to snapdragon in EU for a couple of years. Unless they AMAZE me next year. I'm keeping my S32U.
I love how he has the money to upgrade his phone but chooses to use his note 10+ till this day. Most ppl upgrade every year for no reason without the funds and live check by check
I get the points of innovation you made. But is there something new to make? Let's be honest. Smartphones peaked around 2019. Everything else has been just improvements to what is already there. The only innovations I see happening is in the form of another form factor.
I Just bought an S22 Ultra to replace my 5yo Note 8. I only decided to replace the Note 8 after all security updates were stopped - it still worked brilliantly.
man, these scratching noises are so hard on my ears
the s-pen is useful for a lot of things, **snap**
Really thought about getting a S23U but I got a hell of a deal when I traded in my S21U so I'm only paying $12 a month for the equipment charge on the S22U 512 so I'd jump upto $50 a month for equipment for the S23U, so I'll probably hang onto this one for another year.   Previously I was getting every new galaxy ultra almost every year
Broke my P6 screen. Replaced it with a new one thanks to iFixit. It's gonna stay with me for another 2-3 years atleast.  Had my OnePlus 5 before this for almost 5 years!
That selfie part cracked me up 😂😂
I change phones only when they stop working. Usually it takes about 5 years to completely destroy a battery. If companies really cared about environment they would make replaceable batteries. I don't see any reason why billions of people have to throw away perfectly working phones with dead batteries.
Chill on the Samsung innovation roasting (folding phones), especially with that Note10+. That 10x-100x periscope lens is amazing and so much fun. I am addicted to 120 hz screens now, but if you already have a model with those then I agree you don't need to upgrade.
And the included charging cable can't even handle 45 watts... what a scam.
Yayyyyy!
The biggest mistake I made was upgrading my note 10+ to an s21 ultra. I'm gonna keep this phone as long as possible, in honor of the note 10+.
Commercials? Ads? I haven't had one of those in well over 8 years. It's called Adblock.
The camera is nice, but I have the S22 Ultra so way too early to upgrade. I tend to skip about 3 generations between phones.
I'm eagerly awaiting the teardown of this phone. Especially to do what their new camera sensor looks like. Maybe we can see Zack doing a clear back phone once more.
Already 4 years to upgrade my phone, and it still works.
The best part of the phone is the peel when unboxing.
Jerry, you're the only reason why I haven't upgraded my Note 10 Plus yet ....😂😂😂
Nqb
Still rocking s9
Upgraded from a OnePlus 7 Pro and holy dang this thing is a absolute beast. I love it
if anyone wondring the S pen survived for 3mins and 20 seconds only untill it broke in half. Rip
The one picture on the left looks way better. Ill hope is from the S23 Ultra (i Didn't got any Samy ads)
It would be interesting to see tear down of s23 ultra Samsung is finally giving a pull tab for the battery 😊
No screen protector?
Still rocking my S10. I told my wife that I'm not upgrading until you do.
"The S Pen is useful for a lot of things" *snaps*  Jokes aside, as painful as it is, a broken S Pen is the reason I started following Zach years ago. I had bought a Note 4 and was super curious to know how that magic stick was working.
No Samsung was harmed in this video
I knew there would be a fine print thank you for shedding light on it.
jerry's voice is so deep.
S-Pen be like: see you on the other side fellas 🤣
samsng - doing the same as apple Jerry - crying over it
Finally been waiting for him
I love the s pen (Breaks it after a sec)😂
The main reason I watch your videos now is to see if you plan on changing your old note 10 or not !!
2:57 😂
I was scared when I saw the title.
oh! the moon catcher are destroyed by a bald.
Dang, that handled heat and bend perfectly.
How about, using the pen hole (when pen is in use) as a speaker reflex pipe or whatever its called
I always hold back my scream when the blade scratches over the metal sides 😣😅
Respectfully disagree about spending money on innovation instead of marketing. That's exactly why LG died. They had great phones with leading edge designs and features. But no one knew about them.
Nothing new, cero innovation, what a fugly phone
Using the same note 10+ ill probably change it after 1-2 years after jerry changes his. Save cost.
Hey Zack, you should do a real rock durability test! You said that the phone is solid as rock, but it's the rock this thin and big really that solid? 🤔 I'm pretty sure you could break it! 😂
Jerry its kind of dude who belive in " climate change " ( no bank or company inssurance are worry about that, becose they know its made up ).
Same! I am still using my Note10 plus and not buying the s23 ultra. Might wait til next year
Smoothest roasts as always lol
It's the way how Zack just casually breaks S pens without pausing to think if it is the one from his note 10
I'd love to see a teardown of the casio f91w
Why is everyone so gung ho about recycled materials? 10% is better than zero. Why can't we just be happy with them doing something
Definitely got the Samsung Ad
I had a D brand not bashing it but I dropped my phone and it cracked the back glass on a s22 ultra
I had a note 10 plus. Now I have a s22 ultra. I didn't see it at first but there is a big difference in performance.
Do the s23 smaller one
The fact that you don't roast apple this much makes me feel sad for innovating part.
Stop using the click bait title, this isn’t a durability test, but a Samsung Roast 😂
MY EYES!!!!
I agree with your reasoning for not upgrading i still rock my S7 Active ive had since it was a new release
O man their ad campaign was gaudy, overstated and sooo unnecessary in my opinion. Even if they don't invest in r&d they could've just pocketed it all and cut the price of their phones a bit to a more practical price point or put that money for long term software support 🤷
- This is my favorite part about the ultra *proceeds to break it*
Samsung disliked this video. 😂
my note 10 screen went green, very timely...
Already got the s23 ultra and I upgraded from the s21 ultra     This is SOOO GOOD!!! The qualities are so different and the screen just feels so smooth! This is a must Upgrade if u have an s21 Ultra and below
Imagine a brand selling you a 1200$ phone with the 45w battery charging feature and suggesting to use your old 10W charging brick....
Watching this using my Samsung S7 Edge. Still works properly. I just replaced the battery by myself once when the battery life was terrible.
I definitely got an S23 ad in this video
Dear Jerry,   I like those wise words passed down from your mother.  Thank your for sharing that with us regarding making use of things till they wear out. Keep up the great work.  Although, I suppose some of these new phones do make for great content such as this DT video.   It is good to know that you won’t be out of this job anytime soon.
Sry Zack gonna dislike your vid cause of your sponsor,  dbrand. A case that starts to fall a part after 3-4 months I say this is a waste of money. Even the cheeper case from samsung after a lot of abuse started deteriorating after 2years but still in one piece and still using it. Was a big mistaken when didn't take into consideration the comments from othe gripcase users. Also if there are readers who doubt my comment I ask you why there is no review section on their site?
If the s pen is his favorite part why is he being so mean to it
I watch this whilst cringing on my brand new s23 ultra 😬 hope it lasts!
Next oppo Reno 8t
I used ti like this guys objective videos. But now it is objective no more, not by a long shot. And not funny anymore. To much social justice present. Eh...
sorry I've been following you for a while now and I think you've been complaining a lot lately about things that are actually beyond your cap but the more you keep complaining the less I'm going to look at your videos
Yo man chill ... what did samsung do to you. The roast is enough
I mean most people don't upgrade every year and really never did. It's odd when people say it's the same as last year's. Then... Buy last year's? My guess is you don't upgrade yearly.
Like if we recycle a entire window it's still better for the environment than probably 200+ phones.
Comment
Great interesting video, samsungs definetily not the only greenwashing company
I love how you casually play with that knife lol
Your hair look better on the new phone though.
That lighter test 😮i was shocked I thought it is like any other else smartphone! Well done Samsung i think
2 things. The S22 Ultra can also take photos of the moon (it uses AI upscaling just like the rest) and also, you asked if anyone got ads for Samsung. HAHA! There's a great mobile trick that allows me to watch all my feed videos without ads, and I only clicked on this video to leave this comment after watching WITHOUT ads. Sorry Jerry, I rigged the system.
My Huawei P30 Pro lasted 3.5 hard years before the battery started getting weak. While I did upgrade to a Pixel 7 Pro, there just isn't enough innovation year over year to warrant spending that kind of money annually. And really, I don't see that much of an upgrade from my 4 year old flagship (it launched in 2019) to my new flagship phone which is pretty disappointing.
i own a fairphone 4 and plan to keep it that way for a long time. they do a lot of greenwashing too, but they actually use fully recycled plastic on the _removable_ backplate which allows access to the _replaceable_ battery, _expandable_ storage and the 8 screws that hold the screen in.   i hope you guys in the US of A get access to it soon.
Why do i always wince watching these videos? 😂
Heyy Jerry give me a phone RIGHT NOW PLEASE 🥺🥺🥺🙏🙏
I got an ad for Samsung watches and an ad for an s23 mous case phone protection
👍👍
tesla launch events cost money to run tho
I used to upgrade about every 2 years, BUT Samsung gives us a reason to upgrade every year with VERY GENEROUS trade in offers. Traded a Pixel 2 & paid $800 for s10+, traded it for S21+ & $100 of free accessories for $299, & then traded the S21+ for the S22 Ultra & $100 of free accessories for $399. Make sure you guys take full advantage of Samsung's trade in program when they offer "Enhanced Trade In" about 2 months after a new device's release. You're Welcome 😎
Watching from my Note10+
Oneplus 11 ad in this video
Watching from my Note10+
Kinda funny speaking about million dollars advertising... How was your LG CES report?
It might seem a little overboard but I keep my phone inside a case and with a soft screen protector. The case obviously protects the phone from breaking into pieces, and the soft screen protector keeps the screen scratch-free. I've been doing this since my previous phone, it does such a nice job that I still keep my phone as a portable media player.
Hey Samsung... PLS make a SPen for Jerry 😃
I really hope the Samsung doesn't start pulling on-the-fly Photoshop with the moon photos like a Chinese brand (i believe Oppo?) did a few years ago, cropping in a NASA style picture of the moon onto the white blob of a photo you just took. MKBHD covered it
I got a samsung add
i have seen a video comparing the battery life. they managed a big improvement of ~10% or so.
Hi Jerry I'm saman from srilanka. I'm fallowing you warry long time ago if you give a Way Samsung s23 please can I have it please thank you
The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra had minor upgrades on the features of cameras, I wouldn’t still upgrade just yet, and would wait for maybe the S24 possibly
Even as a partial Samsung fanboy I like how you call them out for the green washing bullshit, as long you do the same for other brands of its calibre when it's the case, I guess.
The recycling numbers are staggering. I feel if you pull so much material out of the earth you should not be allowed to create more. All these materials where made by thing the planet made.
Still rocking my note 20 ultra. Starting to think it will go on longer because not enough change. I use to upgrade every year because innovation. But lately I just dont see it. Every company doing the same and just making a slightly better camera with a new number. Maybe time to move to a foldable 🤔
The last S pen with capacitor was in the Note9. After  Samsung using the Nichicon SLB03070LR351BS Li-ion 2.4V battery in S pen, not capacitor. Looks like capacitor, but is a battery.
My Note 10 is still running strong.... no reason for me to upgrade yet.
I was almost tempted to Fall for the marketing gimmicks and upgrade my S22 ultra to the S23 ultra I'm glad I waited for this video to "scratch" Some sense into my ears 👂😆
Now send me that phone.
Phones has not been broken in your hands lately 🤷🏽‍♂️ I think you need to pay someone to be doing the bending 🥲🥲
Casio F91W gang here, rocking it for over 6 years by now.
I love your comparisons to the Note 10 plus. Been rocking it since launch, here's to the next four years!
love that it easily passed the burn test, this new victus glass is good
Nothing new & innovations coming to smartphones these days,so no point of upgrading every year ❤️🙂
NOTHING HAS CHANGED
No offense bhu this s23 ultra is boring .. no massive upgrade
I'm upgrading to the S23+ from the S9+ only because my battery doesn't last unfortunately.
I got ONEPLUS 11 AD👍😅
yesss, yesss, yessssss!!!! lets do it!!!!!
I like your deep base voice jeery ......
"the S-Pen. Probably my favorite part of the ultra is " Immediately breaks it in half 😁
I've had my S21 Ultra for 2 full years now and it works as good as the day I got it, no lagging, and the condition is still good I've dropped it a few times over the years but nothing excessive, I am thinking of upgrading to this phone if it's as durable as the S21 I will be happy.
Btw, Samsung use snapdragon processors to all note/ultra phones this year. At least...
I have a Galaxy S8. I know, need to upgrade but it works and it didn't cost $1200. Pixel or S22 may be in the future. 🤔
Thanks Zach! Was worried based on some other reviewers saying that the GG Victus 2 was "softer" compared to Victus/Victus+ and more easily scratched, but it seems to be pretty much the same in that regard, which is important since the curved screen prevents the use of tempered glass screen protectors, without dealing with a lip where it stops at the end of the flat area.  My launch Note 20 Ultra is at the end of its run and this is the only logical replacement, and given that I got it for $550 for the 512GB model, I'm not too bothered by the "lack of innovation," so to speak.
I uograded from a s21 ultra. Not for the camera. Not for the pen. Not for the features. No. I'm from europe. I really wanted to ditch the Exynos.
I got a s 23 ad lol
These videos are so satisfying! keep up with the great work jerry
As someone who also owns a note 10 plus, I'd agree I won't be upgrading until my phone explodes or at least until another 3 years, and thats not a guarantee if I don't even like the newest model, probably a later one for half the price seams more of a smart choice.  And also Thanks for the information of green washing Jerry 👍
Calming voice
had my samsung galaxy  a40 for about 4 years now. still dont need to replace it. W
Zach : The SPen is good for a lot of things. (Proceeds to snap the pen in half a couple of secs later) 😂
I got an add for the A53 at the middle of the video 💀 Samsung chill with the marketing
Wow

Samsung are innovating in the foldable department
This was a hard watch on my S23 ultra, first Samsung phone that's impressed me in a while.
There really isn’t much to innovate here. I mean they have one of the best processors, one of the best screens, one of the best camera systems. I mean there really isn’t much to innovate. Though they did release two styles of folding phones. They just shown of a folding device that can then expand to have more screen. Everyone wants a redesign every year. We have just gotten to the point where cell phones are all just about the same. A hunk of crap in the middle with two sheets of glass.
Also let's keep in mind that these "planet savers" have discontinued the installation of screen protectors on their phones out of the box, so you will need to purchase it separately. This results in tons of increased waste in packaging and other materials (mostly plastics), contributing to environmental degradation.
I was hesitating to trade in my s22 ultra for an s23ultra. but you are right that that is a sin to do. especially since they are basically the same.
Samsung has fantastic hardware. Their software is the worst bloatware garbage of all time.
samsung hypocrite greenwashing, then to tell people "buy our new phones" not let people keep their phone if its still working fine (like this man still keep using samsung note 10+)
I bourght grip case back on launch for s8+ did not last a year. And sucks they only make cases for high end now, no case for s20fe lame
You morons arent going to buy a phone because it scratches under a razor blade? The guy destroys phones on purpose. Nothing is going to withstand this torture. Enjoy your Nokia flip phones 🤣🤣🤣
Samsung not being tree huggers make me want to stay with them forever
Phones have reached a point where innovation is extremely difficult and at this point its just about refining and optimizing the same thing every year to be the best it can be
💀7minutes of Zack roasting Samsung
6:18 where in earth is this phone gonna be half price in 1 year ?
What's an ad?
First of all the phone is not $1200 and you will never pay the full price, ever heard of trade ins? People don't buy the phone unlocked and from Samsung they buy from carriers and they have really good deals. For example, I'm with atnt and I traded in my galaxy s20 5g for $1000 when it is original worth way less but due to promotions etc. It's worth more and I traded it in for the 23 ultra and only have left to pay $200. No one ever buys the phone at full price you must be dumb af to do so, people trade in their phones, no one keeps them lmao, there's literally to point. From $1200 down to $200, who wouldn't take that offer for the best phone in 2023?
My old Note 10+ is still doing just fine, no need to upgrade.
I watched this on my new s23ultra XD Didnt get a samsung advert, because i use yt premium.  Good to see that my new phone is durable. Cant wait to see it from the inside! I also ordered a dbrand case for it :)
Other phone brands are leaning towards Apple Design trying to get some of Apple's market share. But Samsung really stuck to their form factor. And it looks soooo good.
I still have the Note 10+ 5G and I think Samsung made a mistake of making it too good. It came with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage as base spec in 2019, even today's flagship base spec is slower.  It's the 1080ti of smartphones and it probably won't happen again.
who needs 5 different cameras on a phone?
Upgrading yearly is stupid dont matter how much money you got an upgrade every 3ish years or depending on how its takin care of is realistic
I got oneplus 11 pro ad in this video
you broke the S pen so quickly it didn't have any chance begging for his life 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
well samsung has been innovating hard for the last couple of years with their flagship lineup they got rid of the headphone jack, sd card, removable battery and things like IR blaster
Teardown skin on note💩
u look balder on the new one
The picture in the left is the S23U by the way🙄
I don't replace my phone until it stops receiving security updates and the battery no longer lasts through a single day of normal use. That tends to put me at about the 4 year mark.
Last my phone samsung s10+ 2019 now im upgrading to s23 ultra because to old and battry is trash now
All these tech giants saying that they are so environmentally friendly and everything but the reality is something totally different...
I still have a galaxy s8 as my daily driver, the front glass is broken but it still holds up pretty well... and social media apps works good on any potatoe,  i don't know any person to use new features like samsung dex or anything, and i don't see why people needs new phones every year, they are all the same and do the same things
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩
Your channel is a representation of every impulsive thoughts we might have about our gadgets but won't act on it coz can't afford it....I love your content...😇
Please keep that same energy when you review the new iPhone this year.
I closed my eyes but wasn't able to see the video :(
before 10minutes unboxed mine...copying my s22 ultra backup now:)
What the hell, it's literally the same phone as last year, like to a T. It looks the exact same.
sacrifice a few minor specs and support innovating brands that are out there, It's basically why I will continue using Huawei no matter how restricted the phones are and although it's tough to use google services
Please do one for the regular S23s, please.
Atleast Jerry should accept that Samsung is still better than apple in innovation... Literally a frontrunner...
I cried when you snapped the pen like a chip bro :(
Jerry, in India Samsung is saying that Note 20 Ultra 5G on Exynos990 cannot support Standalone 5G. Is it true? 🤔  Please reply.
Who else came here just to see the bend test  Spoiler- notlike oneplus phone which as its brand name suggests bend and tear apart like waffers into 2 phones (OnePlus 1=2
My s23 ultra came the other day I'd never do this to it lol.
Seems like this 200mp camera is 600$ cool in the xiaomi 12T pro
My favorite series is Samsung s series. Right now, I use an s20. But I wouldn't say I like this ultra version because it's size is bigger.
Remember when Samsung laughed at Apple for not including charger in the box, doing the same shit themselves lol what an Apple fan.
The picture on the right is the S23 Ultra, not much difference but it has better skin color
So much shade 😅
Rocking the f-91w is the most jerryrig thing ever xD
I dunno if u need glasses, but it was pretty obvious that the right picture was made by the S23 Ultra. There is a pretty big difference tbh.
Is it misleading marketing if they advertise it as "512GB" when already 60GB is taken up by Samsung bloatware?
$1200 for 60GB bloatware
JERRYRIG! JERRYRIG! JERRYRIG,,how many times have I called you? You have content consumers in kenya who really like your content,but when you do giveaways you have never done one for your kenyan fans,please do!🔥🔥🔥🔥🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪
I wish they brought that the note 3 leather look
Very impressive, however after having my fold for 6 months I couldn't imagine going back to regular phone
5:18 your mom got some mad rhymes
Samsung start to use same tactics as apple, selling brand not the device itself. They are good, but they really could be better. There once was time when Samsung was actually making consumer pieces, look at galaxy s1 - s9, each deice brings something better and improved. Now it feels only as a gimmick .
its always waiting this video to easy compare...how to buy or not... 👍👍😀
Virtually the same phone as last year.  Have Samsung been taking tips from Apple?
oof the shade tho! luv it
2:11 I really tried to be honest with myself, but that time on your watch told me that the right one is S23 ultra and left is note 10+ since you took the selfie with the s23 ultra first.
Junk phone, not worth the price you idiots pay for it.
Sony > Samsung
i upgraded after 3.5years from my note 10+ to a note 20 Ultra, only because it has an micro sd slot and the camera is a bit better.
nice selfie comparison, honestly couldn't see the difference.i only want to upgrade because exynos heat up and throttle :/ we Europeans finally get snapdragon
Wait… I did get a Samsung ad before the video
I got the Samsung Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G (Snapdragon) 🤩👍  The last and best of the series, so gonna keep it for long-term, actually onto Samsung really innovate a new and special model, like a better screen slide model. 🤩👍
I hope you share the same view for apple as well
I am upgrading from s21 ultra to s23 ultra
I hope you will test the Xiaomi 13 Pro!
HEY JERRY NXT TIME WHILE TEARDOWN PLEASE COMPARE S22U SIDE BY SIDE AND PLEASE TRY TO INTERCHANGE THEIR MOTHERBOARD AND CAMERA SETUP I WANT TO SEE IT WILL WORK  OR NOT.....
I love DBrand and have since you started advertising them, however, they flopped big time with their "atomic grip" case. That thing was awful. One drop and the case slid out of the way on the corner and broke my screen. But, it doesn't get any better than the regular grip.
Cant see any noticeable difference on the phone photos. However, one thing gives it away - fatherhood forehead wrinkles.
The irony is the fact that I did get an ad from samsung in this vedio 😂
It's strange how the fold gets under display camera but s23 doesn't
Zac: "I understand that carboards can be brittle to a pristine finish" Also Zac: *screetches away at the aluminium sides of the phone w razor blade*
Sorry Jerry, I have YouTube re- Premium. Only bc I despise ads.
Don't break it man please 🙏
Hi Jerry please do bend test for Sony phones specialy for new comers in 2023
I did not get any advertisements.
The bare minimum FOR the planet 🤣🤣
My heart hurts
Might buy s24 ultra
How can the adaptive refreshrate be to safe battery but is disabled when energysafing mode is turned on?
one plus 11 durability test please 🙏
Had the Note 10 and it was a decent phone but doesn't hold a candle to the S23 Ultra in pretty much every department.
That breaking of spen hurt me from inside😬
I went from the note 10 plus to the s22 ultra and I'll probably wait until the s25 or whatever equivalent is out at the time.
is that a casio w 84? oh man i love these vintage watches i have a w 59 been using it for a while. Big respect for you mr Jerry (not being flashy and just simple).
thanks
so samsung spends 2.3 bilion on advertising every year and samsung sold 11milion unit. thats 200$ per phone cut that half (bec samsung advertizes lot more things that phones) and you are left with phone that u can make 100$ cheaper i think it would sold lot more than just pumping money in advertising
Don’t know I pay for YouTube premium so I don’t deal with manipulating ads
Watching this on top of the line black S23 Ultra....  PS: I upgraded from S7 edge and will be upgrading again when S27 ultra hits.... or smth else.
Did he just compliment Tesla? 🤣
The difference in tone between a non-sponsored video like this one and a sponsored video, like the Honor Fold teardown video, is quite amusing.  It's especially funny that corporations that don't advertise on this channel are criticized for spending advertising dollars, while corporations who sponsor content are roundly praised.  And I say all this as a big fan of this channel.
They did make the bezels around the cameras bigger
I've had the S10 since it came out and now the battery is dying faster and faster. I've been debating on whether or not to upgrade now or just wait a year or two. You've convinced me to keep my S10 until I can no longer use it
I still have an S9+ since last 2018 working pretty fine. Isn`t my personal use, but works ok for 2023, the bad things are don`t have Wi-Fi 6, wide angle camera, 120hz But have headphone jack, 1440p display, se card expansion…
Had an Arabic extra commercial as my ad
I think you are one of the few people that have phrased correctly what Samsung and other brands are doing with their budget...
i did get an Samsung add
"The S-pen is useful for lot of things.." Breaks it in half 🤣😂
3:20 Ouch!
Ugh, the scratch tests on the metal are terrible.  Not because I think the phone should do better (it would be weird if steel didn't scratch aluminum)... but the noise is so bad.
samsung is my favorite company,seeing it destroy lol....aaaa
Is that was a horror movie
8 seconds in and I'm already shaking my head  🫢😑
I’ve had 4+ Samsung phone. I love them at first but have had screen issues on the last 2 (s21-s22) and battery swelling on everyone. Finally moved to a IPhone. So far so good 👍🏼
i legitemately got a samsung ad haha
Samsung ad before this video ✅️. Ad of "send me that" is kind of waste of money.
Honestly, the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is a more appealing phone to use than the new samsung phones and I also see no reason to upgrade to the new flagship phones. I love my rear mounted fingerprint sensor and iris scanner and I'd pick it over 200MP cameras and an under display fingerprint sensor.
“Use it up, wear it out, make it do or do without.” 👌🏻 Words to live by.
I Got OnePlus 11 ad.
What does scratching with a blade have to do with durability
Loki be like - Enough. I am god. Hulk smashes Loki and says - Puny God.   Jerry Rigs hulk and says - Not durable enough.
I have an adblocker hehe
Couldn't watch the video. Just came for the comments
Yup I got the Samsung advertisement before this video 😂
5:54 Ya 😂😂 I did get the " Send me that" Samsung add before this video 😂😂
Dude supposedly cares about the environment then ruins $1000 phones
Слава Україні!, Слава Нації!, і вже скоро розвал російській пєдєрации:)))  Дякую нашим захисникам і захисницям - Ви найкращі!
*3:19*  "The S-Pen is useful for a lot of things"  *_Proceeds to break it apart_*
i still use galaxy S10 i do not change phone till it is 102% not usable XD
They can claim that they're green when they stop using hand mined cobalt from the DRC
no one will spend more than $600  on an android phoen . What dont we spend on iphone with the same amount of money
10 ads back to back
I got OnePlus 11 ad in this video 😅
I hate how the s-pen stinks like burning electronics.
I went from a Note 9 to a Redmagic 8 pro yesterday.
Right is from the ultra
I got a Samsung ad right after the video
I noticed after years of watching your videos, you scratching the metals has bothered me less.   Or I've just gone more deaf over the years. Either or. 😂
So, Galaxy S23 Ultra isn't for me either, i won't change my note 10 plus before Zack does. The fold 4 vs Honor Vs proves that Samsung is turning into Apple, copying everyone else, a generation or two later..... "oh people really do want that in their phones, man i guess we HAVE to put it ours now too. Dust off the innovation lab, they need to stuff more things in the same old phone from 4 generations ago."
The thing is... if you meet certain requirements (on T-mobile for example) they tend to maximize trade-in values for older phones. Your cost is greatly reduced, as long as you stay with them.
I love Samsung
I really love the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra honestly but something i hate is the fact that companies like Samsung and Apple removing the charger for the environment like WHY imagine Buying a Flagship phone without a charger but here's a thing Samsung have the audacity Literally provides a charger  on their Low end and Budget Mid range phone like i bought an A13 in Nov of 2022 from a store and it have a 25w charger brick with Type A to C a sim ejector manual Complete pack in a package like why Samsung why i mean what the heck Samsung why you removing things on your Flag ship and mid range phone while in Budget midrage and Low end its completely jampack of things in the box
I don't know if your speech pattern is how you speak all the time, or a persona for your videos.  Whichever it is, it is a perfect calm, cool companion to the violence you inflict on your subject matter.  You deserve the success, my friend.  Great video!
Since most of us upgrade our phones after using it for 3-4+ years, it would be great if dbrand provide cases and skins for older phones too like for my galaxy s9 plus😉
👍
Zach lying here  FYI his phone did not survive but took the soul in someone elses body and lives in that
Make it your daily driver
Haha get up, scamsung
Jerry anna OnePlus 11 eppaya oddikane?
Ahh Jerry, love you bashing the companies on the side. It's only so enjoyable hahaha
I just hope jerry will give me some of his old stuffed phone✌🏼
Omg phone 3 in the year 2023 and am not disappointed.. still waiting to win the redmagic☺️
When will the tear down skin for the s23 ultra be available?
Whenever i feel like i want a upgrade i just come here
Hey jerry please change your phone this year with s23 ultra , please just do it , i want you to use a new phone this year  . ❤ Love from india 🇮🇳
Watching this on my green S23 Ultra... 😂
Still rocking my 2019 A70 but have to admit I'm a bit tempted to upgrade this year
was waiting patiently for your videos on that phone :D
I'm gonna be THAT guy and say that innovation has it's limits that are slowly but surely being reached. You can't always change the design every year, you can't have massive camera differences every year. And you can't convince people to buy a new phone every year, unless you spend enough on marketing. Even if Samsung did actually give us a phone with holograms, most people who bought last year's model wouldn't even bother with this year's, unless they were manipulated by marketing.  I'm no expert on any of this, but I feel like the problem here is annual releases. One year is just not enough for the innovation department. Especially when phones go up to 3-4 years of service. But I can't say I know the outcome if Samsung didn't release a new flagship every year, so I don't know.  All I know is that my phone is still working after 6 years, so it's not going anywhere.
No Samsung add here!
I moved away from Samsung to the Pixel 7 Pro just because of the software and also because of the partnership with Ifixit being able to get parts is nice
Still using my Note 9 8GB/512GB with phone jack & expandable SD card wont see myself upgrading in few more years. I aint buying any more over a grand worth phone with less practical features.
how about oneplus 11  ........... the most wanted review to see its improvement
I'm from UK and have an exenos s20 ultra. I realy want to see all the hype around the snapdragon is about?
sams has the best hardware and the worst software !! Google pixel phone is my choice !!
And where the F is the charger brick, USB cable, headphones and some adapters such as micro USB > USB C.. I had all of these included on my Galaxy S10+.... F the rotten crappy apple they stared this BS, and Samsung is doing it too FK them....
I have the dbrand grip case &screen protector on my s21U and after 3 falls, the screen cracked. The Dbrand case doesn't fully cover the edges on the phone, which is where it cracked...
3:21 Doing this breaks my heart...
Very interesting video, the phone isn't bad, but Samsung needs to be called out.
Still remember the first time i unboxed my s8, it was bundled with accessories like akg headset, charger, usb-a to usb-c converter, and a micro-usb to usb-c converter. Today's flagship unboxing feels like as if i was unboxing a nokia feature phone.
" I like S pen!" and then... snap!
I'm still using my Note 10+. Haven't seen a phone that is better for the price yet.
What about hurting the mic with the sim ejector tool, possible this year?
I am waiting for next video 😁 Taking samsung apart
That is the weirdest box design I've ever seen.
I'll take it for a giveaway 😅😅😛
10 per phone is still better than 0, right?
f-91w 💪🏻💪🏻
Classic CASIO watch ⌚ 🫡
I got a Samsung ad
Is that a Casio f91w?
Great video as usual, although a well lit studio might not be the ideal environment to assess camera improvements
I have a 22 Ultra and it looks the exact same
still using a note 20 ultra .... 2 years now (a bit more) so happy :)   since im using it everyday with intense tasks  (university work) it holds up well. I took good care of it and it took good care of me.
I just don't get it why samsung is always getting criticised for no new innovative ideas in recent years where as apple doing much worse things and still getting a easy pass
The s pen is useful for alot of things. SNAP
On holiday I bought brand new £150 Xiaomi Note10Pro came with a 65w quick charger, 120hz Amoled screen, dual sim & memory card slot.
Bend test?
Next one plus 11
I got an ad not to do my taxes by Turbotax
Apple also should spend less on marketing and spend it on R and D. Everyone already knows what Apple is.
it's a corporation mate what make you think that they care about the environment
yes i got that samsung ad.. kinda insane
I also ordered a green Ultra 12/512
good
The only time I’ll upgrade my s10e is when it breaks, or the security updates stop. Which I believe might ether be later this year or next year.
Man what are you even talking about, phone companies can't innovate every single year, that's dumb.  And I don't get your comparison between the S10 and the S23, just because you haven't had a reason to upgrade doesn't mean the phone didn't get better, it's way faster, has an S-pen, better cameras, looks and sounds better, it's just overall a way better device, if your reason for not upgrading is "they haven't given me a reason" that's just dumb, I thought it was something like you wanted to see how long a phone could last.  You also have a weird obsession with environmental friendliness even though you buy an insane amount of phones every year and have probably left a bigger footprint on the planet than 99% of people.
Kand nikkan pattnilla 🥺🥺🥺ente ponn jerry anna..
I got a car insurance ad. You know, that guy talking about $19 a month.
I actually got the Samsung Buds 2 Pro ad on this video 😬
Your videos are great and fun and I hope you are successful.  Your video makes me feel calm, maybe it's funny 😂😂😂❤️
not even an ssd card slot is there anymore. Spending 1200 bucks and they still stingy and scam you for internal stprage upgrades for 100s dollars... while releasing basically the same phone as last year
Can you put the phone back in one piece
At the end keeps the phones in order of selfie taken. S23U on left and note 10 on right?
This was so satisfying to watch and offering plenty of sound reasons to stick with my reconditioned S21 Ultra.
Is it me or Jerry got an new watch (Casio F91W)
I have upgraded my mobile after 7 years..
I got 2 advertisement of 1plus 11
Anyone else was only looking forward to this specific video from jerry 😂
Samsung be greenwashing, just like this year's phone compared to last years
I have mee to samsung note 10 +
Art with Jerry is dead now that phones are no longer shipping with metal backs. SMH
it literally refused to burn...
2:28 "I can see why Samsung would want to be careful"       *proceeds to destroy the 'pristine' finish
Long term durability is the problem with Samsung, it’s just a matter of time until the battery has its time of the month and bloats like a pig that’s been in the sun for the rest of the month.
2:11 Casio f91 w is sick🤟
corning gorilla glass victus 2👏👏👏
1:50 - Is it Me or Did anyone notice that Glass got a scratch instant over the Front Cam in 1 try 🤯🤯🤯🤯
Thank you so much 😍😍
Thanks for roasting Samsung, certainly deserving.
Has anyone noticed that Samsung is trying to turn the inferior S series into the Note series?
I got an s22 ultra a few months ago after my last phone kicked the bucket and I've been loving it this far.
Well...we in Europe have finally got a Snapdragon SoC in Samsung Ultra models. So... I'm thinking get a S23 ultra after 3 years on Note 10+ . I think it's time.
still on note9
شبيه ربك حمبوك هاتنا الثيليفون بركا ماتعدب فيه
it was hard to see a nice phone being damage....😀
Eagerly waiting for this test
Don't get me wrong I really like your videos but can you not break the pens every time. Or at least try to take it apart without destroying it
still using my old s8+
People want to act like this isn't worth an upgrade over the S21 Ultra, or even the S22 Ultra. The sheer efficiency that this new SoC brings is worth it. Absolutely. Do you NEED TO? No.
Jerry: "Let me know if you have seen any Samsung ad on this video" Me, who uses AdBlock: "We don't do that here"
I have a OnePlus 3T ...replaced the battery once, screen two or three times....but I would love a new phone if there was one better in specs but mainly in durability.... didn't see one yet so far in the years...any recommendation?
I wish they'd stop recycling the HEADPHONE JACK AND EXPANDABLE STORAGE
Wondering when Zack is finally going to try and disassemble the s pen correctly.(and put it back together)
I agree, I've had my OnePlus 7 Pro for the last 3 years and I still don't see any reason to upgrade to a new phone.
Got a Samsung ad ;—;
YEAP got my share of brainwash attempt, even before I could see your bair bowl bold face 😂 keep up, or together, or apart 😤 I don't know anymore 👍
Almost all other reviews concluded that the cameras show significant improvements.
Great One....Destruction even before S23 Ultra starts shipping in various countries!! 😋😋 Seems the camera lenses have improved in durability. Eventually, I am buying one after over-extending the usage of my previous phone for 5 full years.  Yes, most people who buy Flagships in any category usually keep the phone for 3+ years. This is the way to go rather than quickly upgrading (just because phone companies ask us to.)
I wouldnt upgrade if my S10e didnt get the green tint 4 years in :( Tried out the 22 in stores and didnt feel like it was an upgrade to my 4y old phone so now im waiting for that price drop on last years tech and thinking about getting a Fairphone instead.
Even I'm using note 10 plus from past 3 years ... Still rock solid and no problems so far.. gonna keep it for another year
The left selfie is 23u
But it’s okay Jerry, your EV pickups foot print on the world will help, I’m sureeeeee of it💀
This man is getting the s23 ultra and destroying it while I am rooting for the s10+😂
"Samsung isn't innovating." 🤔
The S Pen useful for a lot of things  **SNAP**
Seriously whenever I start seeing your blogs I feel sad from one side and happy see from other side 1st [is that you unbox the new service] 2nd [you break and show every thing in the device] Which gives what's there and how it is actually built.
I went from the Note 10+ to the 22 Ultra. I did it for the camera upgrades and I haven't been disappointed.  I won't upgrade again until this phone dies or new advanced cameras come out on a newer model.
Oneplus 11? 🙄does it survive?
Iphone is best
He didn't even use the S pen.
It is actually worrying how fast new tech becomes obsolete especially on the lower end. 1-2 years and you can hardly run any apps without crashing or have free enough space.
I did get a Samsung S23 ultra Advertisement on this video 😜
can't wait for teardown of samsung video
0:54 Rocket scientist... I mean surgeon   :)
You should have waited a bit more Jerry.
I got one plus ad on this video
Some recycling is still better than 0
"buying the phone this year or buying the phone for half the price next year " sad truth of android pricing 😂
Jerry totally forgot about the charging brick removal and adding it now as the a gift. Bullsshiit!. If you have a brain cell and you're not a phone reviewer, upgrade your flagship every 3 to 4 years.
Waiting for OnePlus 11😂
I live in a country where no ads show to us 😂😂😂😂
Yeah, for me also, I do not upgrade my phone until I feel like it. Had a Note 5 in the past, with OnePlus 6T being my second  phone (truly atrocious device I might add, full of bugs and bad battery life), until I got my iPhone 12 Pro 2 and a half years ago. Planning to still use it, that is, until my father gives his iPhone 14 Pro to me, and I must add that iPhone 14 Pro, despite being an year old at that time will be a well deserved upgrade for me, with the 120 hz smoothness, the camera, and oh yeah, that "notch" disguised as a pill lmao.  Anyways, yeah, I do, too tend to upgrade phones until it breaks, or I get an upgrade for free from any of my family members. Tbh, I was planning to keep my 12 Pro for 3-4 more years.  Anyways, a nice video as always man, the title, it is a bit deceiving though.....
selfies literally look exactly the same
Comment 1000
I can't appreciate more that he can buy latest and greatest phones with a snap of his fingers but still he's using 3 year old galaxy note 10. Hat's off.
Please do a teardown test immediately man.. we are waiting for your teardown
Jerry do OnePlus 11 durability test let's see if it will break in half again 🗿
I'm using S21 ultra and i don't need to upgrade still even if this note looking phone is my favourite as i loved using note phones.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE start using some hand lotion. You are basically a professional hand model.
If Samsung or any other phone manufacturer wants to be good to the Environment they should at least make phone more repairable and last longer!
waaaaiiitt a minute.... did you scratch the front facing camera with paper knife? What the heck ?! Its looks like that FFC has a round cutout and other type of material?
I'd rather have a headphone jack than a pen.
Samsung plus Xiaomi these company needs some reality check
Nothing changes year after year same damage
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Me, who got an Apple ad on this video: *confused screaming*
Just got it for $400.... i don't understand y people still buying it for $1300 🙄🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
It's hilarious to me that any of these companies claim that they are "green" or "care about the environment", while pumping out model after model every single year.
Lol who got goosebumps while watching the video?
I upgrade every 3 years if my battery isn't as good as it once was 🤟
I would've bought a tear down skin for my Note 9. But the battery started warping enough to pop off the back glass for me. DYI clear back glass with a little help from Samsungs battery department.
I've loved my Samsung phones so when it was time for new appliances we bought all samsung.  Big mistake!  Our washing machine shook itself to death 1 month after the warranty expired.  Initially, we were told they would replace it but that quickly changed to sorry you're screwed.  I will not be buying another samsung product
"S pen is useful for lots of things" takkkkkkkk...
No don't scratch like that it's a brand new phone 😭💔😭
Put that extra billions on marketing and reduce the price I'd say and more recycling materials! Maybe that is why I am offered 830 dollars for my Samsung s10 plus since the 23 is no upgrade that is worth it to me. Thanks for the great content and yes I am totally keeping my s10 plus with headphone jack and expandable storage! :)
I'm upgrading from the note 9
Looking forward to Samsung's new A   series durability test
It’s actually called virtue signaling. Let me guess you voted for the guy that blew up a natural gas pipeline which was the biggest ecological natural disaster in our lifetime. Do you have a Tesla with that massive battery from slave labor? Or do you use a gasoline vehicle? Or how about how you destroy so many phones for money? Or how about all those batteries for your 60,000$ cameras? Why don’t you just be a man and stop virtue signaling?
As we can only afford to buy a phone 200-250 bucks,we may feel satisfied & buy a note 10+ 😌😌
s22+ ?
Ad spending is a great spending. It would be dumb to stop it
The S23 had room to fit a whole pen in it but not a headphone jack?!
You're a very very bad man! 🤣
You don't know me .       Well at any rate you won't 😂✌🏼
5:13 rn I have a 5 yo phone
Eco green is the craziest green washing name out there lol
yup same 4years  in average one time even 7 years, and like you said for 200MP not worh 1200!
I love it when you roast Samsung and Apple in this vids lol.
I think you will be happy then you will teardown S23 Ultra  You will have a surprise
"Use it up Wear it out Make it do Or do without." Nice poem 😁
Thanks for calling out the BS environmental friendly angle. They're basically just lying to our faces and calling it "marketing". Can't stand that that's standard operating procedure these days
We want the teardown plzz
I believe in upgrading my phone every 5 years
Looking at you break the S pen still hurts even after seeing so many phones and other SPens broken
Imagine having a s22 ultra and thinking u need the s23 ultra
Do OnePlus
Nice watch!
Sir please give me this phone,,,, my family is very poor,,,,🥺🥺🥺 I watch your every video❤️❤️❤️❤️
Most of us are waiting for your one plus 11 encounter 😃
I upgraded from an s10 to my current s22 3 month ago, still got an s23 ultra ad🤣
Imagine paying 1,100 JD for a phone and still needing to buy a charging adaptor separately
Every time i watch his video , I die a little 😂
Love the saying from ur mother. Also the true jabs throughout the video. This yr full price next yr half price!
Keep them coming, Jerry
Note 9 user here, it still works wonderfully! Best phone ever (with a headphone jack!)
This phone is getting me to finally upgrade, but I'm coming from a note 9.its been a great phone but it's starting to show its age and I want those new cameras so I can zoom in on those spy balloons
Does this have sapphire glass camera ? Test with sapphire tester again?
Love that you called out Samsung on the 'green initiatives'...hate that companies can and will do this. Same goes with companies bragging about 'net carbon footprints' ...being totally bogus.
5:30 Damn. Samsung S23 Ultra is the first mobile that didn't survive the burn test.
Finally
لاااااااااااااااا يافتااااااااااااااااااال
I think I will stay with my s22 plus a bit longer
*Samsung bragging about their recycling tactics is like **_Obama awarding medal to Obama meme_* 😂😂
If I wasn't such a huge pixel fan, this would probably be my next choice
I didn't even receive my phone and he's already destroying one right there. Wtf samsung:)
I've been waiting for this moment the day the s23 ultra was unpacked
Oneplus 11 bend test please?
The funny thing is that I got a Samsung ad on this video.
The side scratch sound was so satisfying.
I got a OnePlus 11 ad on this video. Excited to see if OnePlus 11 will pass durability test🙂
For someone who destroys phones and complains about low recycling... Oh the irony. I have no problem with what you do to test durability, but go light on the preaching.
I'm still rocking my iphone 6s :) I feel that i don't need any more than that
why  bother with scratch test result are always same 6,7
Glad I still have my S21 Ultra for now and thanks for the breakdown. Also I was thinking: The day is becomes cheaper to make things out of recycled stuff is the day will will see more recycled stuff.
i currently have an iPhone 13 Pro as my daily driver, i dont have right now a reason to upgrade my phone so far. My Phone is doing great, no scratches or bents. Having a screenprotector and case all the time (needed to change the screen protector twice, as it hurted my thumbs) but overall no reason right now to upgrade!
5:56 I have youtube premium 🗿🗿.
Why don't you test the new Huawei phone with the strong screen if you can please do 🙏
You really have to be a psychopath to watch this and not cringe a bit every time he scratches something
I am still using my 2018 Samsung J6+, still does what I need with a phone.
This generation S23 Ultra comes without a screen protector. Instead Samsung is selling one to you separately with a ton  of garbage to apply it. The amount of plastic generated with screen protector packaging is 100% more then all the recycling and green washing they did this year.
I'm laughing at everything in this video. Tesla is a joke, samsung is a bigger joke, Zack the yak thinks Tesla is innovative with the electric car! That's the biggest joke of all.
Looks like im gonna wait till 2025 to upgrade my S9. Or depending on how the next Sony flagships perform. Battery is almost shot and so is the rear glass adhesive, so getting a new battery inside shouldnt be that big of a deal.
I love how he has roasted Apple and now Samsung
I was rocking my Note 10+ since 2019 but finally decided to replace it. Ordered the S23Ultra two days ago. Maybe I´ll put on a DBrand Teardown skin as my Note 10+ wears since the skin´s release, protected by a Spigen clear case.
most awaited video for me 😍
S23 ultra seems to be a more optimized version of S22 Ultra with some subtle upgrades, but those optimizations matter.  Seems like we cant see drastic changes every year now.
1:44 shouldn't the blame be on corning as well since they're the one that made the glass?
I’d never give Tesla my money.
Oh i love how you keep it real and roast any company for their lies as they deserve. Samsung is slowly but surely becoming an Apple of the android world. Sadly there is noone out there to release good quality and exciting new phones. Everyone is playing it safe
Stronger phone  No doubt about this  Display is Wall...
Yep. Got an ad for Samsung 🤷🏿‍♂️
I used to upgrade every 2 years before I became more environmentally concerned, although my old phones always went to my parents to use so they eked out 4+ years of usage.
Ironically, I got an apple ad
2:15 Zack literally wiped some geniuses out 😁😁
Hey Zack. I got ¹+11 advert. 😂
Isn't the bend test kind of unfair because Zack gets stronger every year ? 🤔
Pre ordered mine. I can't wait to gouge the sides of it with a razor, snap my Spen in half and try to burn the screen 😄
Ending the video with This video is tearing Samsung Apart & next video is taking Samsung Apart is JerryRig Style. I like his sense of humour which he talks the truth of the company or product in a lighter and his own way. Love this guy.
It always pains to see Zack break the SPen.
I had a s22 ultra ... But... Not worth it... Yeah yeah the camera is good... The screen... But other than that... Not worth it ... Just a phone... Sold it and went back to my 1+ 8....
If I'm being honest, we see more details on the selfie on the right even though it's very good lighting environment. (in the t-shirt, face and head).  You look more "natural" on the right.  Not thats it's a reason to upgrade, but you asked us to be honest! 👍
That unboxing using that knife . Am imagining what the phone was feeling😁
Just casually says "Besides the model that EXPLODED, everything seems great"
Green washing is a despicable practice. It is basically calling everyone stupid and lying about something that is actually not true or entirely true
Zack: probably my favorite part of the ultra-lineup, *pulls out the S pen  Also Zack: Immediately snaps it in half 🤦🤦
Stop pushing save the planet propaganda
I hilarious 🤣 how is talking gently and braking the S pen
I watched the whole video with my eyes closed. You never told when to open it. I was hoping for a miracle!
Honestly,  these companies should stop manufacturing new toys every year or half a year with minimal improvements and should rather focus on prolonging the life of their previously released models by availing parts, more support etc. They can always use internal prototype testings to bring in new phones every year but launch a full fledged upgrade after maybe 3 or 4 years for the consumers. (The S23U is definitely a good upgrade for tech enthusiasts but not for general people who just wanna spend on new toys). Unfortunately, this can't happen.
Jerry: Our good friend, the S pen probably my favourite part of the S series. *Immediately proceeds to snap it into half*
I did get a Samsung s23 ad at the beginning
I still got my iPhone 4s at a daily phone, can’t rid of it
Xiaomi 13 next
Lmao I legit have a Samsung TV ad on this video
I don't mind getting big improvements every couple of years or so as I that's my upgrade cycle, my previous phone gets passed on to my daughter so each phone gets at least 4yrs of use(along as my daughter doesn't lose a handset again🤦)
Samsung sells animal skin phone cases. bad for environment as well as spirit
I didn't get any Samsung ad ...👀...YT premium 🌝
There are Hundreds of S23 ultra review videos but still we were waiting only for this particular video
3:20, This part of the clip in every video should be censored, I little getting bad dreams of breaking my gadgets like this. :)
Waiting for OnePlus 11 😉 Hope it's will pass the durability test this time 🙌
Well, this is not a Samsung roast video but I consider it an official awareness video of a technical enthusiast telling the Empty headed fans of Samsung how a fraudster of a company is cheating on mass... Excellent teardown content!
Sir you do durability checking for every Phone giveaway me a phone sir
Next video is Samsung S23 Teardown. Don't break this new phone Jerry
Nice video
I'm only upgrading to this one because I still have the S20U, and it's time for an upgrade.
thanks Jerry the only person that, doesn't sugar-coated this very expensive & unnecessary -plus-full-of-fakes 📱Phone
Google Fi has the S23 Ultra 516 Gb for half the original price with no trade in for current members of the service. It was an instant buy for me, and I get to keep my S22 Ultra.
Jerry still using the s10+ but just pre-order  the s23 ultra
Is it the first one to survive the fire test?!!!!!!!
Actually time in the photos are different the that is  first taken was right side which is obviously s23 and left side is note 10🧐🤔🙃🙃🙃
I literally have had a s10+ for the longest time and it works pretty well and the cameras and power from the processor is still decent. Not sure what Samsung is doing
apple watch : no galaxy watch :noo $10 casio F91W zaaack ❤️❤️❤️
OMG JUST UPGRADE YOUR PHONE ALREADY
I ve seen this video last year
Let's be real, noone is buying this phone because Samsung is using more recycled materials etc. Noone cares about the 10% dye used. It's all about the TECH packed inside the phone.
Btw, 1:49 why did you put a sim card on the phone while testing, anyways you will snap them like a little lego. ;)
My galaxy my wayyy!!!
serial killer of smart phones !
Oneplus has another phone for your bend test
Placing the microphone hole right next to the SIM ejection hole is straight outta r/assholedesign
Hey jerry isn’t time to upgrade your phone ?
Wow they literally didn't change one thing from the 22 ultra. Only a pointless zoom lens. I think I will stick with my s22 ultra. I love it.
I will base my purchase decision on the outcome of this test
Great review and good job cutting through the marketing jargon.  I'm only upgrading to this because I still have the S10+ which is starting to show its age in battery life and standard features. Otherwise I would have waited another 1-2 years.
0:21 seriously Zack? Yo you supposed to peel the seal, or you probably do that on purpose, I can't tell 😂
It's been three years since I've seen a phone worth upgrading. Mostly because they keep putting the front-facing camera in the center of the phone instead of the corner. Like everybody just seems to ruin their design and functionality by doing that it's gross to have it in the middle of the screen
I got a Samsung ad...
Watching this on My huawei 10 pro mate
It would be nice to see some innovation, but I think all of that goes into perfecting Z Flip and Fold series. S series has been about incremental updates for years
Well it may look similar and that it hasn't changed a lot, but its the best samsung phones after Note 20 Ultra, they've upgraded nearly much everything despite those screen bezels, Better speakers, better microphones, bigger upgrated ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, special snapdragon for all countries, so the battery will last more, new 200mp sensor with ability to shoot 12bit hdr video, and better low light performances, better OIS, brighter screen, ability to shoot Raw images up to 50mp, faster memory. So it's a great upgrade from last year's S22 Ultra
Waiting for this one
jerry showed no mercy ☠️🙃
If more youtubers would criticize these major companies in all the important ways like Zack, we'd have more innovation and lower pricetags.
i regret watching and listening to the part of frame scratch test with earphones on
Two years ago I bought this grip case For Note9, I payed an obscene price for shipping to EU, after half a year of use, the rubber sides came unglued from the back plastic, yes, it's a silicone case that's NOT unibody, can't reccomend it. Just lookup Spigen, I've had 4 cases from them for different phones, perfect every time.
Give me this phone galaxy s23 ultra
Jerry it's  time to upgrade your phone!
If you have the S22U and buy the S23U, congratulations, you bought the same phone twice
You're every smartphone's worst nightmare ☠️💀
Hi @ 2:14 we can find the pic from which Phone easily. First pic is from 3 year old note 10+ and Second from Note 23 ultra. By seeing the time in Zack's watch we can see the difference in seconds. 😜
200 MP camera is cool, but not 1200$ cool 🤣👍 100%
Finally the video I have been waiting for😍❤️
My redmi note 9 is still going well after 3 years, it is slowing down and starting to show its age . But I want to get the redmi note 12 this year
Greato 👍
Samsung "For this year we made the display flatter and did absolutely nothing else" Mobiles.   Apple can get away with releasing the same phone each year due to their software and massive feature set. But I see no reason to buy Samsung again until they push some real innovation.
I generally only upgrade when there's something breaking/broken/wrong with my current phone. My current phone is a OnePlus 7 Pro that's about 3 and a half years old. But I'm in the process of upgrading to a Pixel 7 Pro because my phone is starting to have trouble connecting to things via Bluetooth, staying connected to my cell network, and the battery life is degrading.
My man, why such a horrible title clickbait? This is pretty low for you
Oh yesss
I can see why samsung wants to be careful... *PROCEEDS TO RUIN A >1000$ PHONE*
I'll stick with my S22 Ultra. Pretty much the same phone.
I would usually replace at two years but my last phone I kept for three years and my current phone I've had for over two years and likely won't be replacing soon mainly because of no good options in my opinion. My number one reason for replacing a phone is battery degradation. Keeping my Pixel 2 XL for three years and using my Pixel 5 at two years and three months really sucks for the battery life.
I am still using my 7T and I don't intend to change my phone for de next year.
This is the first time I've watched a video from this channel. I almost threw up when he started scratching the phone. What is the reason for this mutilation?
అన్నీ  చేస్తున్నారు కానీ  Water 💧 Test  చేయటం లేదు అన్నా అది చేయండి అన్నా దయచేసి
I Have a Note 20 Ultra 5G and just bought the S23 Ultra. But I am trading in my phone and with that and the other discount, it was $830 off the price. So Im paying less than $500 for the S23 Ultra. Very worth the upgrade in my opinion. Especially now that I became a Semi Truck Driver, I use my phone for GPS and the screen has alot of burn in from having the GPS open many hours a day.
6:02 yes the preroll was s23 ultra to samsungs credit my phone is 3yrs old so samsung may assumed iam going to upgrade but iam not s20 is still fine and the newer things dont really have any impact on day to day use anyways
do mate 50 pro huawei
Do we really need new phones ever year (12 months)
Is it just me or can you see the screen refresh rate slow down to 1hz during the fire test? The pixels seem to be "healing" periodically abut every second
I had an ad for exactly this phone before the video
1:35 That's the only thing that hasn't changed a while ago  Yeh it's strong enough but still should be even stronger.
I did get a Samsung ad before this video, though it was from one of the carriers selling it. It probably counts.
Who still has an S10 with expandable memory?
what a boring phone... im staying with my lg v30
You are the freaking best
still with my Note 9, second hand...
Did anyone else cringe when he used the exacto knife to get the phone out the box
dbrand is great but they only support the newer Samsung's. i went through 2 generations of note phones that by the time I was able to afford a secondhand version of this phone the grip cases was never available. hell the skin was barely available. Last year i was fortunate enough to get an s22 ultra. and a teardown skin. only for the phone to get so hot it "heatshrinked" the skin and bunched itself towards the cameras. leaving the edges exposed and it was at that point I realized what a Pile of shit I own now. Thing cant even thermal throttle correctly. it will make you use less apps and disable PiP. for instance on a windscreen mount and the sun has made the phone heat up. it will take away your maps PiP window and say that the phones getting to hot and it needs to use less apps. never have I ever had android do this and its a pile of shit when its summer. its been a great hand warmer this winter. but come summer time the phone will make your hand sweat if its not on power saver. and who wants 60hz 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Smartphones have become like cars at this point. You wouldn't trade in your 22 civic for a 23 and I wont trade in my S22 for this S23. The bigger problem though I think is justifying brand new phones when last years model is just as good in almost every way.
wish they made smaller flagship, i cant get over how massive it is. gonna stick with my note10, maybe get regular s22 when they go down in price
The schtick is beyond old.   Apple and Samsung dont pay me so they suck.   Honor and any other cut rate Chinese junk pays me therefore they are elite and I will praise their every move.
When jerry opened the S-Pen I'm telling myself please please hold yourself together that gonna hurt.. The S-Pen breaking is hurt touching.
They could use the ad money to make their phones cheaper
No matter how much these companies use recycled parts and components and adopt green initiatives, they are still not enough to convince me that they removed chargers from boxes for the sake of their profits and not for the environment.
Nothing gives me more pleasure than seeing a ScamDung phone scratched and messed up!
There's actually a huge performance increase in the gpu
This is the first YouTube video I watched on my brand new green S23 ultra
Funny how i was just watching the s22 video a while ago
Nobody commenting on how costly iPhone is but everytime pointing out cost for an legitimate best Android phone on the market 🤔🤔 with lots of features. This is the exact perceptions which makes people believe that IOS is better than Android.
And still do not have a microSD card slot or headphone jack.  The S23 and S23 plus are even worse as they are not adopting the latest cutting edge technology but still have an insane price.  The S23 plus in my country is 1200 euros while the S10 plus was 1029 euros... and that phone had a microSD card, headphone jack, cardio sensor, variable aperture and costed much more to make because it was adopting the latest technology available at the time... plus it had a box with a usb-C to A adapter, AKG headphones and a charger...  I hate that common people are getting this phones and letting manufacturers fo away with this anti-consumer behaviour...
I've a 2dollar case on my note10+ and mines is in a better condition than yours
I can afford even the premium phones but i'll never buy a phone without an sd card slot and headphone jack. I think there are many people who think the same. Samsung, take note.
"Rocket surgeon...." omg I lost my shit . 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😅🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭🥹🥹🥹🥹
I used to upgrade nearly every year back in the early days of the smartphones when the hardware actually had meaningful changes year to year and a phone a couple generations old would legitimately chug. Now in the last 6 years I have had 2 phone, an S8+ and a OnePlus 7 Pro. The S8+ started glitching out on me so I got the OP7pro used and has been working great for the past 3 years. Now though it has received its last security update last month making it EOL even though there is nothing wrong with it in the hardware sense. It is quite annoying now having all these new, basically the same phone being released every year while software is the only thing actually making phones go EOL. Going to put Lineage OS on my OP7pro this weekend in hopes that I can keep it running for a while longer.
2022: JerryRigEverything 2023:JerryRoastEverything
I still use a phone from 2018 and I don't need a feel to change it for atleast 2 more years.
1200 bucks for a phone that big but no headphone jack nor a msd card slot.... hard pass especially since the mainboard for a phone is not that large. Also a FM radio chip is not that expensive either nor is a IR blaster. I mention these because there is nothing more any phone OEM can do in terms of innovation on a slab form factor (which makes Microsoft axing continuum even more galling) so they should just put back everything they've taken out just to save pennies on the bill of materials per device.
:D Thx Jerry
spending millions on advertising, to make you think you need it....   i loved the Note 10, was the best phone ever on Samsumg
I got a notification on my Galaxy S21 Fe about the 23 ultra as soon as it was announced...
The most durable reviews with subtle burns, not just from the lighter though😅
I'm good with my s21 fe.....can still take pics of the moon at half the price
Be nice with that 🫠 Gosh the S pen RIP 🫥
What I hate about all this tech giant companies is how they present they save the environment things. For a normal, regular non tech person it would be like an achievement and they would appreciate this companies without knowing the truth. only people who are close to tech news and updates will know all of this.
I would love to upgrade every year but the cost os too expensive, I had a s21 but it didn't do what I wanted it to do so I went to the s22 ultra. I won't upgrade for at least another 2 years.
Battery Not Included 😂😂😂 Just wait they will soon take out the battery like the Samsung Xcover and make you buy it separately.
Everyone is trying to be Apple these days
Good day Zack, I remember last year you didn't do a durability test and teardown on the Ultra's smaller brothers It would be nice to see you do those videos for the 23+ model since it's made differently(Even though they're the same materials)  Thank you
I love the dbrand description on the grip case lmao: THIN. Unlike you. 💀
But why you don't say that when you reviewing apple products besides they're the same every year. So biased
first picture Note 10 +, other one s23 🤗
would love to see you do some reviews on cases. i have a metal case that i got on amazon for like 20 bucks, its steel and super thick rubber, theres a spot cut out on the back thats all rubber, that allows it to still charge wirelessly. i thought it would make my phone get super hot, but after 2 years in the case iv noticed no downsides...other then my phone weighing like 4 lbs. (its really more like 2 but still)
A pretty boring year for Samsung’s phones except herebin Europe with the SD 8Gen 2, which a huge upgrade !
Honestly I don’t want my EUR 1200 phone to have recycled materials. I want it to be premium
Hope samsung keep this design for the s25 ultra too, i am planning to buy the s25u as i already bought a mid-ranger one a couple of months ago i wanna use that for couple of years. love this design.
2:17 Bro is blind
In my country, Samsung offers iphone 14 users to trade s23 for free!! Your comment makes me  confident to keep using my current phone. It’s true that Samsung marketing budget is on fire 🔥
Dude, Get A New Phone Already. 🙄 May I Suggest The Galaxy S23 Ultra? Have You Heard Of It?
Bro the way u break those pens is it personal😂😂😂
So an American starts supporting American Brand.🧐   Did you get my point?
I got a z fold 3 I only keep it at home but I have a not so protective case should I get a better case for 60 dollars I also have the z fold spen so if you know of a good case that is super protective and stores the spen can you give me the amazon link in the comments
Camera improvements are more with low light now. Not with professional studio lights. Also battery life on the s23 series is amazing.
It is a shame that a device of that caliber has no microSD or headphone jack
Zach's use of words is lovely. He keeps reiterating the 90% artificial dye.😅
Dude, who tf takes a razor to their $1500. phone? I have a case on my Note 20 Ultra and it still looks new. $10. Spigen case...
The moment I saw you pull out the s-pen ...I knew it will be it's end 💀
I still use the Note 10+  too  it's still a beast and even though the battery has degraded  it still gets me through a full day with ease.   absolutely no need to upgrade  yes especially with only iterative improvements
Zack, I've always wondered...you do bend tests  for when the phone is in our pocket...but my phone is usually in my hand. Why don't you do drop tests? I'm more likely to drop my phone than sit on it.  I understand glass is glass, but I'm more concerned about how the body attaches to the glass and how it may or may not absorb the impact. (Especially with Samsung's curved glass displays).  I know any screen will crack with just the right drop, but it would be interesting to see the results of a vertical impact test.
why is he so critical of samsung all of a sudden? apple does same sneaky and weird stuff all the time, I rarely see any mainstream American youtuber criticising them
Samsung never had any durability issues "besides the model that exploded" lololol!
Love mom's slogan. That's old school reality
Finally the wait is over.....!
Hey here's that video!!! Excited thank you !!! You're so awesome !!!
Never had a Samsung phone. Guess I'm not in their targeted ad group.
Zack is so right about this electrocrap
I don't like the current trend of product life cycles. Brands should release new models in their flagship lines every 2 years, not yearly. Because I am also one of those who tend to upgrade every 5 years, and I typically don't pick up the newest of the new in tech, last year's model is fine. But realistically, given the way phones "innovate" these days, it might as well be a 2-year release cycle. Barely anything changes year to year, most of it is software features and a new, 5% more powerful SoC.
Mans didn't even tear it down
I jumped from an iphone 6 to a Note 8 before finally upgrading to an S22U. I'd love to keep it for 5 years like my Note but I'm very tempted to get a Fold 5, especially if it comes with an in built S Pen. If not, I'm happy to keep it around till the Fold finally does come with one.
I got OnePlus ad😂
Stop with this using old phone bullshit... nobody cares
I am crying, but was totally worth watching, I stand on the side that this is not friendly with the environment and there is no reason why they don't include the charger on the box if you are paying over 1k for it, and only 10% is recycled??? Looks like the Sapphire screen from apple!
The picture on the right was the S23
Using a knife to talk the phone out of the box … ballsy I like it
Having my iPhone 12 Pro now for nearly 3 years and if it was not about the battery wear and tear i would keep it for more! it’s really doing good!
lol at getting ads
A company that wants us to upgrade .. so they don't have too haha ok.. Watched on NoTe 20 ultra with an expandable memory card .. an upgrade that isn't available anymore..
Is these 2 holes are for microphones or any other things?
I got a s23 ad on this video as well as every tech related video
Ahh… A good old Jerry video with ice-cream.
@2:10 i am pretty sure that the right is S23 Just go back and see when he takes the photo  U can see the way he looks on the preview on the screen and confirm it
I haven't upgraded my s9+ (2018) because it has features that this 1200 phone doesnt. headphone jack, expandable storage, O2 sensor. No reason to upgrade. im switching to apple anyways and just waiting on them to get usb c on their phones and a fingerprint scanner. however long that takes. Everyone I know uses apple
Materials engineer here. The 20% “recycled” glass at 1:25 isn’t revolutionary at all. All glass melts have about 20% recycled glass added to reduce the melting temperature to begin with. So even less impressive 🤷‍♂️
👍😎
2:19 L-23u R-N10+
Casually breaks pen all the time🥹
Poor S pen 🖊️😅😇 The real king 🔥S22ultra 😍✌️
Still cannot not cringe at the scratch sounds!
I wasn't able to find the case of my call phone is realme6pro
Everyone says this phone can take pictures of the moon.  But why is nobody talking about the S22 Ultra being able to take the same picture of the moon?
World's first ever unboxing using knife instead of pull tab 😝
i am also upgrading my phone after 4+ years. i am telling myself i am doing this for the environment and not because these phones are so expensive nowadays...
2:14  wearing the same watch
By the way the color of your Galaxy Note is unbeatable
whit at least 1,5x the price of the original note 10+ (owner myself), I can't justify upgrading either.
Samsung does innovate quite a lot with the S23, they just did not change the design much. But why should they? The internals are new, the processor is finally a) the same in all countries and b) somewhat tailored for the S23. They seem to have invested a lot into the internal software with its AI features to support much better pictures, video and even 8K video.
That scratch. It catches me every time
I pre-ordered one a couple of days ago, I am not sure I should be watching this video. I'm sweating over here.
My s20 FE is doing a good job since release so maybe next year il upgrade
It's like watching the movie hostel.
That pen snapped like a toothpick 😅 brutal! I do get why it isn’t so durable though.. most people won’t do that to it, and it’s protected in regular day to day.
Dude went out guns blazing! Smile more bro
The only time I upgraded in 1 year was from the S21U to the S22U, FAR better phone in my opinion. Great job Zack 👍👍
Samsung is innovating but not this form factor. I think there is not much else you could do to make the slab better. Foldables is where Samsung is betting things are going.
How ugly are the samsung phones these 2-3 years
Dude went out guns blazing! Smile more bro
Oooff  that scracthing sound
in regions where they sold exynos chips, this year is a big upgrade acually, because of snapdragon, finally, they dont sell 2 diffrent phones whit same name :)
i think it would be cool to see the s23 or s23 plus durability tested as well, those are actually pretty different to last year
It's hilarious to see Zack grap the S pen look at it for 3 seconds before snapping it like a twig
S23 and s23+ next? Would be interesting to see the differences
I've already pre-ordered my S23 Ultra and am only paying $300 for it, thanks to Trade In, Military Discount,  and other benifits from T-Mobile.
Told as is.
I got Oneplus Ad
CASIO F91W 👀
got a Samsung ad on this video, oh the misery.
Finally the wait is over
My eyes hurt 🤣
I got it... happy with it so far. Was using Note 9 until may of 2022, then got a Xperia 1 III, but what can I do, I´m a Samsung bloatware fan. Hopefully the 23u will last me 4-5 years. I´v already seen a video, that Samsung has put pull tabs under the battery this year. ;)
Seing the video from my brand new s23 ultra. I'm a clear victim of samsungs marketing, yet on spain be are finally getting a snapdragon chipset, so in my case, it's worthy. Awsome video, as always!
I do not think I will ever be upgrading my Note 20 Ultra (the last ever Galaxy with an external SD card option) until I see the ultimate folding phone that reaches the max potentials of folding phones with an acceptable price tag. And I hope by then they would include SD card options cause for some reason I am really attached to that.
Upgrading from Samsung S8+,t his seems to be worth the wait.
Awesome job zack.
Currently watching this on my S23U. Been loving it !! First new phone in 5 years for me
Jerry WTF did you mean by "starting to innovate again"? Did you forgot about the Fold phones? Weren't you in CES 2023? Haven't you seen what are they cooking there? I'm getting tired of hearing your mumbo-jumbo about the "lack of innovation" over and over again! Give credit where credit is due for once! Samsung managed to refined an already almost perfect candybar form factor. It's clean, sleek and with minimum possible compromises. What kind of innovation exactly are you expecting? A flying phone? Geez...
Because we'll be scratching it with a razor blade
WTF bruh! What's wrong with you man?
They did not spend advertising money like honor payed yesterday so they got honest review, with scratch test etc.
Imagine if instead of focussing on constant dumb slight camera improvements they put that effort into a better more durable screen.
Stylus:- exists Zack:- imma break u like a lil twig u piece of digital pen
Man i literally got pissed when he broke s pen without any hesitation
Good video
Got a Samsung before this video, and before the previous one too...
i'm a tech lover, and as a software engineer i make more than enough to care about the cost. yet i still rock the Galaxy Note 9, the last good phone with an sd card. and before that i had the galaxy S5, the last good phone with removable battery. My galaxy s5 still works wonderfully, and i use it daily as my universal IR remote, and dog cam.
"The S-Pen is useful for a lot of things" then instantly breaks it 😂
phones can't keep up with technology... iphone makes the same phone 8 years ago. polish and polish the phone until a generation changes. samsun does the same thing in a generation and everyone says it's a fraud. best camera, best chipset, best screen on the market, 11+ hours of screen on, 4 years of updates, polished design... it's a great phone. for constant innovation samsung has the folds
I can't wait for the day where every phone has: *scratches at a level 7 with deper grooves at a level 8*
After voting on the polls that zac made.. I think i will change my phone this year cuz i still using my almost 8 years old huawei mate 9. Did change my battery and charging by myself, the lcd screen already show some aging but anything else the phone still works.
I don't see the point of these tests.  Scratching down the side of just about any consumer product will wreck it because it's not designed to survive such tests due tot he fact they generally wont face such abuse in real life.  About the only thing that'll survive that scratching with a knife blade is a main battle tank and you'd sort of expect that to be the case.
Zack can you do durability test for the Huawei Mate 50 Pro? That would be interesting :)
I have a note 10, only upgrading because I have a deep scratch that keeps making random inputs in that area of the screen.
Just hoping to see this malice stick around when it's time to do the next iPhone
Samsung is the best. Me likey. And I would have bought it even if was 2.000-2.500.
Nice watch  F-91W-1 Casio , Thank U , Old memories
Bro is complaining about the environmental friendly claim and destroys brand-new phones on a daily basis. I love it!
oneplus 11 please
Samsung just got bodied 😂😂😂
Wow 3 yrs! the sacrifices millenials make for the planet and their parents pocketbook.
Short and right to the point! 👍
Half price next year? I wish! The S21 ultras still round 900 bucks. I only bought the S22 ultra because i found one refurbed for like 800$ at Bestbuy.
I can never get used to it when he scratches the frame 🥴
Love how you encourage people not to buy every new model every year.
I watched s23 ultra durability video posted by pbk reviews and in that video s23 ultra scratched at level 8 while deeper grooves level 9.  In your video the device scratched at level 6 while deeper groves at level 7.. can you kindly explain.
Im still using my iphone 8 from 2018, no need to upgrade it for now
I had a Samsung Ad 😂😂
Yep, time to unfollow. 7 plus minutes of complaining touched off with a promo at the end to make sure you get paid. By the WAY, a LOT of people like myself upgrade to continue to make use of promotions, like getting $1,180 off like I did. Keep in mind the little bit I pay to upgrade every two years not only let's me update to the better cpu, gpu, battery, camera etc but it's no different than paying to replace an aging battery and worn screen. But you don't think about that aspect, just want a reason to whine. 🤙
left picture old phone..  right. new phone
"The S-Pen is usable for a lot of things"  * crack *  not anymore^^🤣
10% natural dye for a product where the colour is not even a big part of the environmental impact (like it would be with clothing for example) honestly sounds like something you'd put out on April 1st.
5:30 What more can they innovate on though? Smartphones have plateaued not because of a lack of investment, but because they've been in development for so many years that there's not much to innovate on.
When do you switch to a new phone?, the s23 is great
I've been getting ads about the S23 Ultra for a week non-stop, both on Twitter and Facebook, it's getting really annoying.
Your hands definitely needs some moisturizer
In Samsung defense all of that is showing up in big letters on Samsung website.
Jerry, Tesla is like the apple of EVs. They might have been cool but they’re lagging behind now.
I love you Samsung S23 ❤️❤️❤️
Brutal as it is. Jeryrig
Present!!!!!
Upgraded from s9 plus and just got the phone today from pre-order. I was in awe and can't help but to wear a big smile when I powered on the phone for the first time. Felt the excitement once again about acquiring a new phone. Before s9 plus, I used to upgrade yearly, but I'm glad the way I think about phones changed over the years. For now, I will enjoy my s23 ultra but will never ditch my s9 plus yet. It still works great. 🤩
I love your videos but I feel pain seeing a perfectly good phone being destroyed I would even like that phone in that state
I love you Samsung S23 Plus ❤️❤️❤️
Still use redmi k20 pro until now
Why should I close my eyes again haha
I get samsung ads on my samsung that i own, and its a folding expensive device. Its annoying
I love you Samsung S23 Ultra ❤️❤️❤️
Ngl this ECO bs is getting anoying
I can't wait for OnePlus 11
I need to update my S8 to the S23 Ultra
Selfie on the right was clearly the S23 Ultra. It's absolute dimensions better than the one on the left...
OnePlus 11 5g new
Oh yeah give it to the phone jerry
and 45GB of SPAM and BLOATWARE installed as part of the 60GB ROM, instead of the 15GB clean android ROM
You should review budget phones like Motorolas
3 minutes in to the video and the phone just lost 2 buttons 😂😂😂😂
Well I have an S9+ and am upgrading to the S23+. Will probably use for the next 4-5 years.
Was waiting for this video since the launch 🔥
Honestly I only got the S22 Ultra because my note 10 was broken and I wanted to experience 120hz
- Make a wish
Enjoyable as ever - but you sure are deep, deep in the Musk/Tesla bubble.
Imagine already having a charger to begin with before even buying the phone? Wild.
Good job
I didn't get an ad but about 5 minutes after watching the video I received a work email with new perks regarding Samsung
Jerry you the realest one left
I love the way he just snapped the pen in half 😂😂
I also have a Note 10 plus like mister Jerry, and i got the S23 ultra 6 days ago.. I regret it so badly, the note 10 is amazing, and i honestly cant feel the difference in the upgrade except the screen which is a little more crispy and the camera which is just a tad sharper... NOT worth the 1500 bucks it costs here:))
Rocket surgeon?
Why....????? 🥲
I'm completely fine with my S22 Ultra. The camera is beyond excellent so an upgrade doesn't even seem appealing. I can take beautiful shots of the moon with my 100 time zoom on my 100 megapixel camera. Hopefully that s24 Ultra is a much bigger upgrade.
The "S pen" sounds interesting for a non-native speaker. Overall great brand, great innovative features and great branding 👍
Na ez kamu volt. Szinte hozzáse ért a telefonhoz. Az öngyújtó lángja csak ritkán ért a kinelzöhöz ahogy hozzá ért már el is változott a képernyő. Karcprobán nem váltogat. Videó elején a szikével mikor karcol egy tompa szike a végefelé megint más penge van a szikébe. Full kamu a videó.
My man’s poetry getting better day by day 😂
Price of these phones went out of my hands long ago
More money for less phone every year
Oh
I assume left one was s23 ultra? 🤔
I unpacked my S23U yesterday, and I only bought a new phone because my S20+ had after three years of intense use a burnt in screen and a battery which had to be charged at least two times a day... would it have been financially sound to get it repaired, I would have used it at least for the next 1–1½ years...
Casio gang!
Samsung should just skip the incremental upgrade BS and use the 2 years in between new models to perfect the Phone.  this would be: 1 Awesome 2 actually more eco-friendly 3 saving them rnd money  4 more time to refine the next big phone 5 giving us much better phones
I think Samsung is spending all their innovation money on their foldables currently.
He made the point 👍🔥
This year full price next year half price
When the phone's manufacturer gets burned more than the phone does
No one:  Literally no one:  Jerry: 'My 3 year old note 10 i still use'
I was wondering when this video was going to happen!!
Zack Zack Zack!  Hopefully you talk more about the internal upgrades in the teardown.  As I am sure you will.  🙂
Could this be your new personal upgrade over note 10+
I had the chance to take and compare a 10x zoom photo of the S23 Ultra vs. my S22 Ultra. Yes, the new one is a bit finer, sharper and a bit less noisy. BUT: - not €/$/£ 1,200 less noisy, - at least half of the effect can be achieved in afterwork within 1 minute. 🤪🤭
Which photo was which
I thought BBK was the largest smartphone maker on the planet?
It hurts to watch this!😩 I might buy the S23 ultra next year for half price.
I TRULY appreciate how you remain a strong proponent of using our phones for years. I honestly believe rather than constant innovation in features, companies should invest in better R&D to make phones long-lasting for the long-haul.
Casio F-91W s2
S-Pen is useful for lot of things  *SNAPS*
What a phone, love it📱📱
Thanks for putting the light on the sneaky marketing tactics these companies use.
hope you also doing durabillity test for huawei mate 50 pro with kunlun glass edition.
Zack never dissapoints when it comes to roasting.
They do a great job. Besides their fucking phone literally blowing up
I got the "can you send me that" ad for this video 😂(S23 Ultra ad)
After almost 5 years with my xz1 compact I am about to buy iphone mini just because of form factor
I hate buying new phones! I hate setting up new phones! I hate polluting the environment with consumerism. But, I also hate wasting money. I upgraded my Galaxy S7 edge to a Note 20 Ultra three years ago. Now, Samsung is offering me $1000 trade-in for my Note 20 Ultra for the S23 Ultra. $200 for a new phone seems like a good idea. So tempted to do it, but I'm conflicted. Financially, it's a great idea. Environmentally, not a great idea (but my old phone would get refurbished and still used).
I upgrade phones only after the one I use DIES or if it doesn't open apps normally
i think its hilarious that i got a samsung ad followed by an adblocker ad right after telling me how annoying ads are
3:19  ''the S-pen is useful for a lot of things'' *breaks it in half* WELL NOW IT ISNT USEFUL ANYMORE    lol
I thought Jack is gonna break the phone.😂🤣
I got a 1+ ad, does that count?
DO HAMMER TEST
Wooooow 🤩🤩🤩
Was hoping for the regular S23 :(
I'll keep my Note 20 Ultra for another 2 years
Great Video! S10 was my last Exynos chip phone for sure. Ones it dies its gonna be a Fairphone or shiftphone next for sure. Exchangable, upgrateable and a snapdragon is more than european Samsung ever offered me anyway...
As a Samsung fan, and loyal customer, I'm down for calling them out on all their bullshit.  Thanks for keeping journalistic ethics Zack
What if Samsung announces the Note 23 Ultra. Do you think you will finally upgrade your Note 10+?
The way he broke the S pen 🥲😭
Are back cameras getting scratches ? Do you think they need addtional glass protection (like Spigen EZ Fit Optik Pro Lens) ?
Thank you Zack  What about fingerprint
Remember when phones used to be a relatively minor purchase? I remember buying an HTC One for €600 and everyone thought I was crazy for paying that much for a phone. Now phone cost as much as €2,000. It’s insanity.
Never disappointing content :) But your selfies comparison is the icing on the cake. If I am honest - I can't really tell which of them comes from which phone 🤣. I upgraded to S22 Ultra from old good Note 9 and would have not done this if Note 9 would be still getting Android updates or the security updates were not coming less and less frequently. THAT was the only reason in my case, otherwise I would still be using Note 9. If I had Note 10 series I would likely still be using it, like you are ;)
Don't worry Zach. Maybe next year the S24 Note will finally be your year!
I see we have the same taste in watches...
Oh love the burns 🔥
I'm confused 🤔These videos are satisfying and painful at the same time 🤣
Still have my S10 Plus that ive been using for 2 years and will still use it for many years to come as long as it doesnt break or get too slow. Pointless to spend money on a new phone that has no new features that im gonna be using.
Samsung started playing the same boring game as Apple, minor upgrades and no innovation, I miss the old days of Galaxy s3 and S4, S5 no so much
Samsung is disgusting... Greenwashing, crazy prices... Worse than Apple
Iam watching from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
Twitter nerds ✋🤓
Boss Poco x5 pro video please 👆🏻
Didn't knew roasting the company was part of tear down lmao
Waiting for oneplus 11 video 😊
wait a year and get 50% off what a steal
Phones might be advertised as the best for environment but what still stands after all these years they still *have scratches at level 6 with deeper groves at level 7*
Yeah I think they focused on what the customers actually wanted than changing up the design. Every year the phone looked different so I think we can give them a break tbh. Apple has been doing the same design since Apple iPhone 8 with little to no change in software and crickets for that.
❤
Could you do the scratch test on display turned off? We could actually see the sratching
Rough and tough
I appreciate that they don't come with separate chargers, I have like 8 USC-C chargers and don't need companies making more e-waste. Plus the ones I have are faster and smaller than the ones companies provide. Idk how people are still complaining these days that phone's don't come with chargers.
Samsung does a great job in recycling and protecting the environment, the product is also quite sturdy, but your comments don't seem to be good for Samsung, you hate Samsung, don't you?
Loved the script of this one. Hilarious!
2:10 the selfie on the left is from Galaxy S23  The selfie on the right is Note 10 Ultra  Not that i care about top end smartphone camera, Just watch gave it all away
Words of wisdom 7:30
The only thing is attracting me to buy an S23 Ultra is the great cashback promo...but i don't like samsung bloatwares in the software and the huge heavy android customization itself.
Sir. Plzz. Give me. One. Ismart. Phone 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏Plzzzz🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.  Plzzzz.  Sir.....Plzzzz...
😘😘😘😘 thankyou
not just samsung, but the same phone  not interested, but its way better than fake "get rich quick" and "games that dont exist but do" ads
Makes me laugh, how they say there's not enough room for a headphone jack but yet, the S-Pen is way bigger😂 Makes perfect sense.
3:21 RIP SPen
Samungt
Pls bring Oneplus 11 & 11r durability test ❤😊
love the way he doesn't revere the phone, he just puts it through its paces and exposes all the bullshit
Uh oh. This is what I am upgrading to from my old S10+. The only reason I am going to this and upgrading at all is because its free for me and the S10+ is getting a little too old. But I am excited for the teardown and I am glad this thing was solid.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😀😀😀😀😀😀😁😁😁😁😁😁
Jerry should low key do durability tests on smartwatches 🤣
This vid's absolutely worth the wait
What watch are you wearing??
Time for my daughter to enherit my old note 10 pluss and for me to get the s23 ultra.
I will probably get this phone after 4 years there is nothing to rush for. After all we're not missing out on anything.
Me watching This video on my Galaxy S9 for 5 years now
I love your videos guy
This man has no respect for new phones 🥹🥹🥹
Well, this makes me far more comfortable knowing my S23+ is going to be very durable seeing it's bigger brother go under Jerry's tough durability test!  Whew!!
Can't wait for teardown zack
What if we squeeze in as much as capacitors in the battery space, will it charge a phone in seconds?
You're destroying so many phone plzzz give me one 🙏🥰🤩
Jerry..xiaomi had 1st a 200mpx camera
Good. You mentioned it. Glad someone with a platform is.
I am waiting for zack to upgrade to a new phone which i will also buy cause i truly love his moto "no need to change if it's still working"
Wait am I seeing this right? The front facing camera got scratched with the razor blade!
I used to upgrade every 2 years, but this will be my first upgrade since the Note 9. The battery life has gotten terrible, the software is getting buggy, but it still works, which is more than I can say for my previous phones after as much time.
"destroyed 1200 dollars in just 5 min"
That casio f91w really needs a tear down 😆
You are awesome LockPickingLawyer!!!!!
that s pen snap
Sir. Plzz. Give me. One. Ismart. Phone 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.  Plzzzz.  Sir.....Plzzzz
I saw the disassembly, but I want to see it done by Jerry!!
Sir. Plzz. Give me. One. Ismart. Phone 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.  Plzzzz.  Sir.....Plzzzz
As soon as the video ended, got an ad for the new Samsung S23. Lol.
Ohhhh my teeth with that sound 😬 of scraping
and he break SPEN
I love it when you roast tech companies. They need to stop thinking that we are sheep!!
Sir. Plzz. Give me. One. Ismart. Phone 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.  Plzzzz.  Sir.....Plzzzz
I wonder why he post like that while taking that selfie, 🤔
Sir. Plzz. Give me. One. Ismart. Phone 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.  Plzzzz.  Sir.....Plzzzz
I don't know why, but when u said, "I'm no rocket surgeon" I laughed way too hard lol
When you finally decide to switch your personal phone, make a video about it. It'll be a nice easter egg for longtime fans.🤣🤣
Sir. Plzz. Give me. One. Ismart. Phone 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.  Plzzzz.  Sir.....Plzzzz
You know the bend test is flawed by nature, right...? The pressure on the middle of the screen are not your  thumbs but your rear end, so it is a lot smoother than two thumbs! I think you should use a machine that bends the device from the edges and with the force equal to the pressure of our rear-ends against the phone in rear pocket and the pressure of sitting on it... Using two thumbs to exert pressure in the middle of the phone is hardly scientific...
On i don't get Samsung add i like you tools. Can you please send me iPhone 14 Pro Max and smart watch ultra IND ❣️😘❤️
I want one now I still have 300$ left on my s22+
I like how he easily decided to break the Spen as its some thing regular people do every day
Sir. Plzz. Give me. One. Ismart. Phone 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.  Plzzzz.  Sir.....Plzzzz
So keep my s22 ultra  . Took me years to go from my note 9 to the s22.   Any tips on extending charge port life?
Awesome, can I get this scratched one as a gift from u....? Lots of Good Wishes for u from India..... ❤️ Keep going
Sir. Plzz. Give me. One. Ismart. Phone 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.  Plzzzz.  Sir.....Plzzzz
I don't use the new phones of today cause they don't have the features I love anymore. I still use those 2 main older features and nobody has them anymore so I still use older phones.
I don't get ads. I use re vanced lol
see if Oneplus 11 breaks in half
I clicked this video like my life depended on it, and I'm not even planning to get this phone .
GIVE ME THIS ONE PLEASE, AM YOUR BIG FAN FROM KENYA
Shit phone
Can't wait to watch it alll
Sir. Plzz. Give me. One. Ismart. Phone 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.  Plzzzz.  Sir.....Plzzzz

Sir. Plzz. Give me. One. Ismart. Phone 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.  Plzzzz.  Sir.....Plzzzz
Hi
Out of all these comments I'm happy to say that I am probably the first to finish the video and comment.
Sir. Plzz. Give me. One. Ismart. Phone 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.  Plzzzz.  Sir.....Plzzzz
Oh wait another Samsung phone with the same design, materials and shape as last years. It's obviously gonna performe the same when it comes to durability. These are getting redundant.
that "Scratches at level 6 and deeper cruves at level 7" never gets old
Sir. Plzz. Give me. One. Ismart. Phone 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.  Plzzzz.  Sir.....Plzzzz
Durability aside, this still seems to be the cleanest smartphone around. Missed the Note 20 Ultra's design but this is definitely another nice refinement to the last Note.
Sir. Plzz. Give me. One. Ismart. Phone 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.  Plzzzz.  Sir
built like a tank 👏
Sir. Plzz. Give me. One. Ismart. Phone 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.  Plzzzz.  Sir
To be fair, aren't the main front shooters the cameras that have seen major change over the years and not the front facing ones?
Waiting for OnePlus 11😉
Bro was just talking and the screen won't even burn💀💀
Sir. Plzz. Give me. One. Ismart. Phone 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.  Plzzzz.  Sir

Sir. Plzz. Give me. One. Ismart. Phone 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.  Plzzzz.  Sir
It really just seems like every phone manufacturer has been running out of ideas for the past few years now
I hope we see you do an indestructible phone someday.
Went from the SIII Mini, to S5 Neo, to S8 to S22 Ultra, not going to upgrade again for a few years ahead.
Good
I thought the Selfie on the right was the better one. Which one was actually S23?
👀
I like how honest you are. Many ytbrs are not - Paid for. I have S21U and upgrade for me would be plain stupid. Thank you.
Yall like Jazz ?
Sir. Plzz. Give me. One. Ismart. Phone 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Seems like we will be hearing "scratches at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7" for years to come
I closed my eyes. Now i can't see sh!t
🫣🫣
Thousand dollar phone but using aluminum and not stainless steel like apple
No microSD slot, no buy.
Can i have the phone now?
At least they aren't like Apple who are responsible for more and more E-waste every year with stupid ideas. Without any initiative for environment.
the only way i did identify wich one is the s 23 photo was by looking at your wach time xd
Over time the all electric vehicles and such that u swear by.  It’s not sustainable in the long run. Bc parts cost more. And cost more to produce then regular gas or diesel which is way better then all electric vehicles.   Tesla is the only one I’d own but as a secondary car   And farm equipment can never go electric. It’s just not feasible at all  Love the videos tho. I need to buy one of those knives 😊
My guess is that the right side photo from S23U
First!
my man taking out the fu*king 1200 dollar smarthphone with his metal pry
The right selfie is from s23 ultra!!
Love watching these products I can never afford
had a s23 ultra ad right nefore viewing a s23 ultra being destroyed
Waiting for your video of new s23 ultra
Hi
Glass is glass
Hey hi I like your work and video very much and your way of crazy videos love from india 🥰🥰🥰
Got bored of this old school tech😫😫😫😫
1:49 why does the info bar text change color?
Just pre order a s23 ultra one hour earlier
2:16 time on watch says it all😂
in guessing the left one is the S23s
Uff! Miserable phone 😁
I love how much you dunk on Samsung for green washing but when apple does it you go hard in the paint supporting them. Very odd
Good video thank you bro
Breaks the S-Pen like a biscuit 🍪 🤣🤣🤣 3:20
Aaah missed a normal video. Been using my Iphone7 from almost half a decade ago. I only recently started feeling the need for upgrading.
Real life 🧬🪔

@JerryRigEverything  Hey Zack, could you also make a durability test and teardown video of the iPhone 14 Pro Max please? :)
Just shattered the screen on my S22 Ultra. 4 foot fall flat on the screen. So sad
Are you done yet? I can't see anything with my eyes closed
Hitman of mobile phone
i love these videos! i think the S23 ultra looks exactly the same as the S22 ultra, unlike the S23, with the removed metal bar across the camera
Que increíble como este tipo cobra por romper celulares
I don’t have e good phone 😢
Finally the phone butcher has his hands on the first phone with a 200MP camera.  Will it survive? Well, let's find out!
