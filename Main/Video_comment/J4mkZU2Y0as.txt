I could not have done this without you all.  Thank you to Mark and Jim for the partnership on this.  I am so proud of what we all accomplished together.
Thank you Pierogi for doing all this and so much more...do not stop what you do. It angers me that there are folks out there who pull scams on others for the all mighty dollar....a few years ago my brother got scammed out of $300 bucks with a CRA (we are in Canada) scam. They made him go and get Steam gift cards, he did it...I was at work so I was not able to intervene....it was all done by the time I got home. But thankfully he knows now and will hopefully never fall for that ever again. This past summer I was hit by someone I believe was trying to scam me....this one was trying to say that a few years ago (about 5 years) I clicked on some thing on the internet that set up a Bit Coin account in my name and now there was over 20, 000 dollars sitting there for me to take...I was like "yah, sure that happened...NOT". I didn't fall for it and told them to kick rocks (not my actual words, but you know...LOL). I hope everyone wakes up the the reality of these scams going on...be careful out there. I have shared a few of your videos on my FB page...hope that is okay...Much love from Canada....keep doing what you do my friend. Love ya!!!
Wow this is a scourge   happy for the work you do
No thank you ❤
You are the BOMB Pirogei!!!!!
You make a really nice looking lady.
Vivian is a very beautiful woman!❤
God Bless.
I know this is an old video but you need to add more Vivian singing into your baits. Especially picking verses of random songs. It's hilarious!!!
13:52 it’s the completely glittered out pants for me 😂😅
He is so cute too
3:44 steven here?
Thanks for all you do. I got popped by one of these scammers 10 years ago. Never gave them money but got weekly harrasment calls for over a year. Feels so good to watch you make them cry or literally freak out the way they did me. Appreciate you brother.
These scammers are pitiful. They really are so obvious that they are not legitimate. How do people fall for this obvious BS. I watch the glitter bomb guy. That's one of my favorite things to watch as well. Porch pirates and bike thieves getting blasted.
My girlfriend got scammed a couple months ago out of 2k they said that it was a past dept I  went into the same room as my girlfriend was on the phone with the scammer lady I told her it's a scam and the scammer lady told her not to listen to me my girlfriend yelled at me to get out of the room I said ok whatever. Whinds up it was a scammer and the scammer got the 2k my girlfriend told me she should of listened to me of course.... Then she went to her bank they said she got scammed and eventually the bank reimbursed her 2k surprisingly and the bank is still looking for the scammer....
I love your spontaneous comments like "my legs are hurting" or "I have to go to the potty."😄
crying steven🥳 was a great name for him
THAT HIT SEEING MY MOM'S NAME ON THE COMUPTER
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You are amazing.  God bless you.
Is Macaulay known for his fart tolerance? 😂
Vivian lost her nails in the package 🤣
"I have to go to the potty."  Hilarious.
You're hot.
At least she wont get touched in prison, rumour is she still smells like fart to this day.
'Crying Steven' the World's newest Academy Award WINNER LOL and the glitter device, the most awesome way for him / them to get said award
Iove what you do man! There are so many different ways that people get scammed now. My own mother who is 93 y/o with Alzheimer's disease got scammed by a man showing up at her door (in a private residence building) and pretending to be a relative (nephew) to have her make him a $5k cheque. So I decided to build a "class" that I can offer to various old aged residences to educate people on various scamming methods they might face. Govs and authorities are not willing to handle this problem so prevention and education is the only way to fight these low-life thieves!
👍👍👍👍👍👍
😂😂😂..dobelu..dobelu..dobelu  com that's  how the scammer's pronounciation of w w w 😂😂😂
Just a thought, what if you manipulate the info to make it look as if you put in the correct amount, and sit back and wait for a reaction 😂
God bless you teach them fucking lesson
9:56 oddly motherly
How do u get all these scammers
Dubloo, dubloo, dubloo, dot. 😂😂
I remember watching a Mark Rober video about this a long time ago. I didn’t even know Scammer Payback, or most of the things I love today. One of these things, related to space, changed my life pretty much. This is legit nostalgia. Me watching little mes favorite YouTuber on a new fav YouTubers channel. So cool ❤
Mark Rober's a sell out for things like Prime
"I'm not a monster, I'm an engineer."
I love these guys. Awesome work.
Thank u for all u do it’s a great thing keep up the good work I love your videos
Too bad you couldnt show her face!
Loving on me. That gave me the cringe 😂
Great work!! love what you do!!
Yes please keep going 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💗🇦🇺🇯🇵
Yes as before governments are in on it making money that’s why they don’t won’t to do anything 😂😂😂😂
Oh Vivian you are the reason I dread being old. Post menopausle females are just atrocious, Just totally kidding, sort of. Love the content !!!
One obvious question is, why don't you access your bank accounts from a separate computer or phone? I guess I'm just Beavis and Butthead smart or something. I never check my accounts on the same connection as the screen communication.
Pierogi look like a Norman Bates in that ladies outfit😅😂😂
Thank you for  being good and getting these criminals scumbags
9:28 Huh?
Mark Rober IS a scammer.
😅😅😅😅😅
It's crazy that he went from "we can finally get them" because of a glitter bomb to activllety shutting them down. I'm so proud oh him and his team and everyone that helps. As someone whos seen the scamming first hand its heartbreaking and I'm glad people are out here doing something about it 💜
i love this
You should've shown that bstd's face.
my Vivian Helen-Veronica Rogers is gorgeous!🥰
they should just do the doubling gp scam on osrs
Look i watch you everyday your one of my favorite channels,,, but i want to let you know they have a new scam thats about medicare,  they call with a robotic voice and they try to make it sound like a lady. But I always know that it's not I would really like to send you the phone number next time. It happens because they call me on a constant basis. I don't have guardio, are any of those protective features. So I know my name and number is out there. I literally get a ton of scam calls a day, but the most here lately has been about Medicare in the state of North Carolina man. I would really love. To be able to help you guys or to join in, I have a small following on TikTok, not too many here on YouTube, a little over 200 but I'm more of a comedy based creator and I really want to be a part of something like what you guys have going on. I'm on the east coast, and I know you don't have too many people over here, mostly with trilogy media, on west coast, in california... But I know there are scams going on on this side of the United States as well. If there's any way, then I could help, please let me know I know being a member it's a big help because of the finances, but I want to physically help somehow some way anyways, if you wanted to look me up, which I know you probably get thousands of messages like this. But I am dead serious, I would like to help, and I get a ton of these calls a day, my name on TikTok. Is @TomaterMater   please, by all means. Give my page a look. And see if there's any way that I can help you guys  being that i'm over here or on this side of the united states... Stay blessed and keep doing what you do, man, you're an awesome individual for what you do, saving people. My mother was scammed. That's why I kinda have a passion for this type of stuff. And I really would like to help you guys..
Wow,awesome
just refesh the page when they say they gave u to much. then get them to transefer real money to u and ask for it back but u scam them ha
Thanks!
These creeps calling old folks "mom" or "dad" and SUCH POOR acting, how does anyone fall for it?
Aside from the 5 o'clock shadow, you could pass for an attractive woman, Pierogi.
I work at a restaurant and tell everyone  who will listen about you and what you do ! Especially the elderly! Thank you so much
Send scammers a TEMU product.
Pierogi, can you or your team, promote the “ Force” on your channel or You Tube. I believe that with more exposure, victims like myself and others will donate to help refund those who lost. Are there rules that don’t allow this ?  I realize you can’t pay everyone back but every little bit helps. BTW, you guys NEED to contact there families more often. Every chance you get. I absolutely LOVE that. Thanks for everything you do…
You and your team are amazing and thank u so much for doing what you do.❤from south africa
lolol
I’m definitely happy to be watching you videos these people need to be taken down big time thanks for doing what you do
That must have been some pretty funny Mugshots with being covered in Glitter!
Love You guys
I have seen @markrober glitter bomb videos and loved them. It is great seeing you use them. Wasting the scammer's time and glitter-bombing them. Love it.
I never thought I'd see pierogi look so fabulous as vivian
Nice press-on nails Pierogi :) :-D  I'd date Vivian LOL :-D 😀
Vivian is a BOSS!! 😂
Anyone here in 2025?
I would be like “oh thanks , I’m keeping that money “ 😂
If you get a call from a guy with an Indian accent saying that his name is Mr Smith, obviously you're dopey!
Very grateful for your hard work ❤❤❤👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼😄
9:06 “I didn’t raise you this way!” 💀 that’s crazy
all I care is that the police is involved and does something about it..
The little motor running and pumping the fart spray is SOOO F FUNNY  😂😂😂😂
I wish yalllllll would gooooooooooo please goooooooo to India
lol …….. honey let me just say if they stupid enough to put money in my account! Trust this they would not be getting it back ! 😂😊😊😂😂😂😊but I know it wouldn’t probably be real money
more mark rober collabs please! the world and the scammers deserve it!
Do-blue Do-blue Do-blue dot The phrase of the year
Have you ever put a crazy amount of zeroes on the end? Instead of 500 input 500000000000
You and your friends are wonderful people!! Thank you all for doing what the law enforcement seems to not care. ❤❤❤
Thanks for busting these guys. Love you and please be safe.
The getting out the car to talk to the cop while covered in glitter is *chefs kiss*
Good onya mate,keep it going. Cheers from Peter in Australia. I got scammed 1 year ago, luckily it was only a few hundred  dollars  however they have been relentless in trying to retrieve my money back. May have to change my number. Any ideas would be much appreciated. I love Vivian especially when she laughs. Thanks again, Peter.
P MONEY looks a little too legit as a blonde. Creepy.
I am grateful for what you do. Sometimes I do call them. If I have the time I like to waste as much of their time that is possible. I had one on for about fifteen minutes recently.  I use my poor eyesight and age as reasons why I never can get the website correct they are trying to get me to log into. Or sometimes I will call and ask for Ben last name Chode. Usually that will get them cursing quickly.
Thanks!
These guys are freaking awsome
❤
@scammerpayback  I would liketo thankyou for your videos. A work colleague of mine was going to use his card details on his phone for these scams and lucky I managed to grab his pphone and I missed em off by saying Mr pud pud ting ting did you drink cow urine today. Lol he got so angry and went on a rant. Then I told him my friend scammerpayback is coming after him and to be careful  and said your next.
Dude u should do a video pretending to be the granny then passing the phone to “bank teller” so the tell can tell granny it’s a scam in front of the them! Or a cop! They would be shook
I support you and I love you
That's amazing! Now send one to a call center in India 😂
Why are white Americans so sympathetic to some idiot on the phone? Especially a man, and a foreigner. Why would someone go out of their way to “help” an someone who supposedly made a mistake? Please stop being so gullible white America.
I am glad I no longer get called by scammers as I delivered my own kind of justice to them down the phone using my guitar amp at full volume and I am sure I injured a few ear drums but they also didn't bank on trying it on with a guitarist that played death metal and doom metal.
Very scary if they are using Google docs or even Google 😢
The banks should educate their customers about these scams 🙏
Uninstall Anydesk if it is being misused. How can they allow Anydesk if it is being used for scamming ? This is Unbelievable😢
Thank you pierogi
love it
I LOVE this!!!🐣
Your channel is amazing but unless you have your tech skills don’t think people should try anything elaborate it’s probably best to get good anti scam softwear and just keep blocking
Question? If these guys just sent YOU money, why not hang up and keep it! Lol
I love it get them all!
“My legs are hurting…. Are you crying?” “Yes, because you haven’t sent the package yet….”  He couldn’t even pretend to be sad for her 😭 these scammers make me so mad
You're a good man. Keep up the good fight. And thank you for all you do. We all appreciate you.
I am 78 years old and get phone calls like this all of the time.  I have a simple solution.  Anyone on my call list has a special ring.  If the number does not have the special ring I cut the off with my smart watch and then block the number.  I had a scammer call me once claiming my wife had bought something from him and had not paid for it.  I ask when she bought the item and he gave me a date of 3 months prior to the phone call. The problem was my wife had been dead over 6 months.  I lost it and let him know what he could do with his scam.  Her death was still fresh and I was furious someone could be that low.  Keep up the good work.
Good stuff.Yay!
Good to see Vivienne is her full glory  Love you Vivienne
Those jeans actually looked pretty good. The glitter was an improvement.
Thanks!
You are one great man!!!!
GOD BLESS YOU NOWADAYS HEROES like Pierogi and rest to protect the naive old people ❤❤❤
Love you guys ❤❤❤
In a meantime police doing WHAT ????
And the award for worst actor ever goes to ... (the scammer pretending to cry)
You brothers are superheroes!
Lol thanks for the Vivian demo 🤣
You are the best 👌
Dude don't dress like that not cool and you are man for christ sake
No law has been broken?? Well that money is stolen and the mule knows it so it’s at least handling stolen goods!
Both Marilyn Monroe (Aka Vivian) and Ali G in the same video 😂
You look strangely attractive with the blond wig you should wear it more often. LOL> Keep up the great work. From one of your first 350 subscribers. x
This is awesome. Great work, you three! 🎉
*"SUCH FUN!"*       😘💨🩷
Lesson of the video : Don’t scam👍
I need you to please turn into Rlbin Hood on them. Hack their account and take every cent out. And give it to those whom they scam with 20% interest.
9:42 Oh my God i almost fell in love ❤
I love this channel, but personally, and this goes for anything, when I'm meant to take something seriously, hearing the word "Freaking" immediately jars from any sense of urgency I might have had.
Nice work team we need ya’ll I want to find a way to help fight the good fight
That was so on point
Yo Vivian is GORGEOUS! She consists off the anger of scammers and it keeps her young
The day I met Vivian is the day I wasn't confused anymore
Mark Rober is awesome , highly intelligent and gets justice
Sucks its in our own backyard now....On ebay and facebook...Try to buy a car or truck...
3:34  Duh-belle-wwooo Duh-belle-wwooo Duh-belle-wwooo Dot whatever DOT com  IM LAUGHING SO VERY HARD .... 😂😂😂😂😂😂 IT MAKES me giggle because my grandparents are straight off the boat from Hungary and they say V's for W's and mess everything up like EAPECIALLY when they get angry and start raging they won't call some one a god dang hoodlum they call them HOODOOS 🤣🤣🤪🤪🤪 our cousins ate the VINEGARS 🤣🤣🤣🤣 ACTUALLY theyre the Whittakers 🤣🤪🤣🤪🙏🙏💯❤️ god bless their sould i miss them so much and it always makes me laugh to hear others languages and dialects❤❤❤😂😂😂
I think Pierogi likes to dress in women’s clothes
You guys are fantastic!!!!
Love from Italy
Mr pierogi, have you ever ate pierogi?
Thank you!!
Thank you folks for all you do!
Bro if the scammers sent me money I'd be like "thanks man" and not send it back.   But I don't wanna deal with them to begin with
It's happening because so many people are suffering because of the government. I've been on disability since 2014 because I was broken. I was working 2 full-time jobs and was a single father. I got scammed myself and my father $420000. Plus last Father's Day, June 18th 2023, my dad died. Can some1 HELP or direct me to someone next TRUSTWORTHY and HELPFUL PLEASE!! Pierogi please 🙏🏼
8:38 "No more Wed-nes-day" lol
I love how these scammers have English names and an Indian accent. If the scammer said to me that they gave me $50,000 by mistake,  I  would say "this is my lucky day!" Better than playing the lottery 😂😂
❤
9:26 is Vivian Helena Veronica Rogers single?
Pierogi, you and your team are great people on this earth !!! God bless you all bro!
sanic payback
Awsome!
Yes!!!!!
And here I thought that the scammers had no shame. I didn’t expect Vivian. 😂
I wish I knew that years ago . PayPal scammed bad . Never use again
I really appreciate what you're doing here. I also appreciate you being a man of faith. I listen to your videos as I'm delivering Domino's 🍕
The latest version with the pins that lock into place to prevent the lid from being replaced is hilarious.
I've seen a bunch of video of Mark's Glitter Bombs, and NOTHING is funnier than the sound of the motors turning the cams to activate the fart spray. Cracks me up every time.
This shh is hilarious!😂
I want to work for you for free
So much gratitude to you and you're work. I have learned so much.
Good lad well done
💞💞💝💝🤎🤎🤎
8:58 ok.. no, thanks for the money!
Keep it up guys…….! These guys need to be stopped and taught a lesson and kick them off the internet…..!!!
Stinky smell isn't going to bother an East Indian in the least. Everything they have smells bad.
Pierogi dressed up as Vivian absolutely lost me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love your videos, seriously......the skit in drag is going to give me nightmares.  Funny too.
No harsh feelings but I'm taking the ✌money✌ and leaving😂
Good  GOD bless your heart ❤️
We should scam Indians take all their rupees 😂
I just pictured the dude saying im not involved whilst being caked in glitter 😂
Love u pierogi. Get them scamming fuckers.
Keep up the good work P. Maybe if you partner with the FBI and CIA you can really get them!! <3
from what i’ve learned if they have a foreign accent leave and don’t look back
Thank you for doing what you do.  Love from the Whole World. xxx
after i've waching a lot of your work with scammers, i've got a lot of why's :D  why shoudl i trust a hindi accent bad speaking person with an "english" name? why should i give acces to my computer to an operator from a call center of a multinational huge company? why a huge multinational company will use a curier (money mule) instead of official postal servicies? why a huge multinational company will use cash and ghift cards instead of money transfer?  and the common sens whys could continue ...   i'm an average inteligent person, but if i can ask myself these questions why others more inteligent than me couldn't?????
I would love them see my account rn -$84 they would hate that
Wow! Vivian is hotter than I expected 😂! Thank you Pierogi and the team! You are true heroes! ❤
thank you for your work your saving peoples lives keep up your work
5:05 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mate you guys are legends, thanks for what you guys do,  petty  I only just seen this Chanel, I have alot of catching up to do, from here in Australia
steven was funny lol
I was thrilled at the notion of a glitterbomb being sent to someone, assuming you could be certain the person opening it deserved the special gift such a package contains, but sad that I did not expect it to also contain the marvelous fragrance of concentrated flatulence aroma I've seen employed on porch pirates.  Then we get to just about 11 minutes in, and my sadness turned to gladness when the word "fart" was mentioned, and I knew what was coming.  You guys are doing good works.  I wonder why this problem is not regularly covered in national media.  It boggles my mind that people in the USA are so easily fooled by so what is OBVIOUS to me: someone with a typical European name would not have the accent ALL of these scammers have got.  But I guess if you're old and don't hear well, you're the perfect mark or target.  Keep up the good work!
We need to have people support sactions on countries that doent have strict laws against scamming the USA.
There is a spray that grows in the dark. It's usually in mase. When someone is attacked that way when someone goes to get treatment for being sprayed with mace, when it glows they health care provider will report it to the police. Then they can match the report of an assault with person who goes get treatment. If there was glow in the dark spray on the person that opened the package, they could be caught easily as well.
You did it!!!! Ahahahahhaha
YOU MADE ME CRY FOR ALL THE LOVE YOU ALL HAVE SHOWN BLESS YOU ALL❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏
Keep up the amazing work thank you for making the world a better place ❤
In the UK we have scammers calling pretending to be Car phone ware house asking you to take an contract out.
Every time he said "unsuspecting victim", I heard it in Mark Hoppus's voice.
preseed extra 2 zeroes lol
That glitter bomb was great why did she keep it after she open it she should of known there was no money in it lol 😂😂😂
Thank you so so much for doing the right thing and helps the most vulnerable people.  You are amazing.  I wish I could be trained to work with you.  Wonderful man
I'm a bank teller/bookkeeper at a VERY small bank in SE Ohio. I am seeing a lot of debit card disputes. Skimmers, perhaps? I can't find a common link between all the transactions. But it sucks when I have to tell folks that it will take time before I can get their money back to them via the dispute process. I really appreciate you all!! When I have some extra $$ I will try to donate. Keep up the good work!!
I like his pants.. With glitters 😂
Well, you're amazing & your perseverance for justice brought you to India! 14:22
I had to look up that post ma'lone song, then imagined granny bumpin it. 🤣
WHY blur the faces of the thieves!?!?!?!? Show them and shame them!!!
I try to do my part when I get a scam call by wasting minute on the line pretending I'm following directions. I wish i had the same talent as you to help you destroy these scammers.
Scammer channel collaboration. both my favorite scam channels combined into one work of art :)
That was good.. amazing how you got all that footage. ❤
Man, I would LOVE to know just what it was the scammer tried to tell that cop! Lol.
hope you nail them and they do not wiggle out all the way to the top!
Super man! Keep on doing it.
You are great, you are a hero!! My daughter was scammed and im pissed! Guys like you are in our corner, guys at Trilogy, and many more..its happening to all of us, but most people are ashamed to talk about it...its like its their fault. Thats just wrong!  Lets get the real people commiting these crimes. Thanks all of you. Never stop fighting.
What if Pierogi downloads a powerful virus to a scammer’s computer? He could infect an entire call center.
Keep up the good work man! You’re helping people a lot. Hats off to you.
get em all!
Scammers better count their days because the whole world is coming for them.
Cross dressing Pierogi was not something I was expecting 😂
When that thief pretended to cry, I almost puked.
Pierogi's women character dressed up is amazing.
Hahaha
What would you need to go to India????
So simple to avoid being scammed. Don't answer calls of unknown callers. Block. If a text or email just delete. I'll wait for letter in mail then dissect it. If anything has you panicking then 99.9% likely a scam.
Okay but was the mule a victim being used in the scam?
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
You are the real deal when it comes to superhero's mister!!! And I luv you for that.
Sans the stubble you actually are a fairly nice-looking lady.
Now we gotta have Mr Beast added to a video and the Holy Trinity will be complete
i love this! i cant get enough! keep up the good work! you guys are so good lol . a big big fan!
im supporting
I would love to see a video where you just say "Thanks for the extra money, I really needed it" and then hang up the phone.  It would be even better if you could do it with a call center where you had audio and video control.  Can you imagine their rage?  I bet they would lose their minds  I love love love glitterbombs!!!  Great work guys!  What y'all are doing is so important!  I was scammed once for about $200.  It was regarding Steam (the gaming platform).  I learned a lot from that experience however I have learned even more by watching these videos.  Thanks for working so hard to expose and stop these scammers.  I don't know if the authorities don't know how or can't be bothered, or just don't have the manpower to really go after these people.  It's great knowing there are people out there working to stop this and educate people on how NOT to get scammed.
Pierogi putting on the wig to get in character for us. More money mules need to get busted in the US. They are participating in a crime
Me when I *accendntly* take out the Glitter in "Glitter Bomb"
Your work is fantastic pity there wasn't a way you could empty their accounts  into  the poor victims I applaud you sir you deserve  a purple 💜
Stephen needs to take acting lessons me thinks.
While watching this video, I got a call from a hidden number. The automated call claimed to be from Pay pall and warned about an unauthorised payment... Wish  I had your knowledge and equipment to destroy them like u do. I didn't get scammed though. Learned a lot from u. Thanx.
You are Amazing
My friends friend had $25,000.00 taken from her joint account
the best part of video 9:26 😂😂😂
Post Office Malone

BRAVO! Thx for what you're doing, guys :*
test   e
My friend got scammed big amount of her retirement.😢I am starting watching your channel. You guys are amazing ❤Thank you 🙏
I love this.  God bless you bro!!!
FINANCIAL TERRORISM AND NOONE IS DOING ANYTHING TO PROTECT AMERICANS!
Good collab between Pier, Robes and Jimothy B. 👏
Do you need your own primetime television show John Walsh, except you go after scammers.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
To Team Pierogi, you all are amazing, i wish i had 1/10 of your knowledge in this computerized age. I salute you for all you do and the amazing ways you use your knowledge and digital presence!! Much LOVE and THANKS 🫡 🙏
I’m in love with Vivienne 😂💜🇦🇺
Gotta feel ignorant to get out of your car covered in glitter and fart spray while talking to the police.
I love each and every video, thank you for fighting for justice
GET HIM
You showed a female suspect being questioned by police. How do we know anything actually came of it?
WOOOOO!!!
A great service to humanity. Good to know that are decent folk like y'all out there!
Vivian is actually very pretty!
run it back. lets go again
Y'all are heroes!
You make a gorgeous woman.  I'm not just saying that. Seriously attractive.  Lol. I love you guys  so much. Thank you for what you do
You became a mom! Congrats!
Pierogi I've been watching your content for a while and I'd like to offer a donation but have not found where to do the payment from, can you post a direct link please. watching from Australia. Thanks to you and the team for everything, some of the vids are sooo funny.
I really thank yall so much keep up the good work, i shared this with others and will began share everything i am learning with others
The second time i started trying to  watched this video i got a message appear that you cant watch this video in the background ???1st &3rd i had no problems
hey you`re not bad as a woman  just need a shave and we`ll talk
Thank you for your great work to put a stop to the scammers
It's called "opponent process theory." They do this in the US. Anthony Morrison is one. The call center will call people who bought his book on a late-night ad about how to get rich quick online. Usually the elderly, Then the person will go through a whole process of building the person up with their goals and what they could achieve online making money, once they are pumped, they then go through all the debt and reasons WHY they aren't rich yet. Oh, but wait! What if that could be turned around? HAHA! then the person finds out where they have money and what the "downpayment" will be for the EXCLUSIVE one on one coaching with an EXPERT!  All of it is really bogus... some might make money. but its more about just getting as much as you can to get someone signed up. I actually worked at one of his call centers, until I realized the scam. Needless to say, that business is permanently closed now. So, it's not just foreign scammers!! There are some US ones too!!
These scammers got a lot of god to be emotional about losing money and their jobs.
they look the same...
🙏👍 Keep it up!
Don’t give up do more l always enjoy to each your channel ❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊
I had a scam call one day and I wasted the guys hour all the guys time for 13 hours with me my buddies and we ended up finding out where he was and we sent the police there while we were on call with him
you are a hero  Bro!   I wish you could do something about scammers in Mexico
It’s not possible to do anything to scammers in India, you should focus on mules in US.
10:10 you look like a 50 y.o transgender lady
❤❤❤
Thank you my brother, and we love you!
you knocked off the scammers
Thank you
You are just fuggin awesome ❤
Thanks for sharing your experience with us computer illiterates.✌🏻
how do you use anydesk against the scammers? i really wanna expose some scammers
👍
Come on perogi a wig make up they can't see you mmm😂😂
Excellent - again!
thank you for doing this <3 God bless you  and your team
shame on indians
If companies didn't outsource to india, this wouldn't be such a massive problem.
After all these videos, I've realised something. If you get a call from a person who says his name is John, or Alex and they speak in an indian accent, they're SCAMMERS.
0:33 bro really thought +7 is india💀    P.S. It is Russia/Kazakhstan lol
Goo goo bah bah poo poo ugh
What about world remitt to steal your funds
Your amasing keep it up 🙂🙂
much love from united kingdom keep up the fantastic work
BRO WHY ALL SCAMMERS ARE INDIA😢
You are so handsome.   But in your blond look you are so pretty
Im sharing your videos
Your beautiful 😍
Thank you for all you do!  Seriously,  if you ever need help in the Dallas area, hit me up!
Keep fighting!
Government couldn't care less that's it's elderly are being robbed blind
“I love you too” bruh I’m dying 😂🤣🤣
Use El Cheapo Hooker Perfume instead of Fart Spray. It's fun to spoil someone's love life.
Miss u perogie come back soon
There's a Guy that's been texting my wife and asking for gift cards and a copy of the receipt
I can watch this all day. Keep up the good work .
❤
All we have to do is spread the word. If you are technically involved or a security expert, help those people (e.g. relatives). I already helped a lot of people from being actually scammed by just explaining the techiques to them just before they have been actually scammed. They came to me because they actually know me personally and were not sure about what's going on on their computer. Last case: a simple browser add-on that spreads "you are infected" messages in the windows notification bar. Another case: cold-calling a victim that "can quit a lottery abo by simply paying for another two months and then quit". For all people that are highly technically involved: Explain the stuff as easiest as you can to people that are not so technically involved.
You guys are like serious E-Robin hoods man! Keep smashing them!
The next step is stinging the Indian cops on the take, who tip off the call centers that are being raided..
Way to nail that scammer mule.
I love this!I love Marks squirrel maze.
You all ROCK.  God Bless
Awesome!!
Loved that Vivienne cosplay😂

Thank you Pierogi, Mark and all your other associates. Humanitarians of the highest level. You guys bring meaning to "we the people"👍👍👍
Thank you guys
Dear Ms. Vivian Rogers,                Have I got the "hots" for you! Man, oh-man, oh-man ! I mean, rather, woman, oh-woman, oh-woman! When I saw YOU in your short appearance in this video presentation, I fell in love with you--immediately!! Oh, my, that seductive smile! Those luscious red lips that remind me of Taylor Swift's (except you don't have the heavy-duty bangs like she has on her forehead, and that look like they're made from a floor mop)! I am a 75-year-old "young" man looking for a hot date, and I think you would be the ticket--and what a ride that could be, ey?!  Presently, I am imagining the sensuous evenings we would spend together, with you knitting and me working on a crossword puzzle; and then occasionally we would look up briefly from what we were doing and smile at each other--and swoon, knowing our hearts were filling up with such deeply amorous feelings, such powerful longings (...as in, I need to go take a nap right now because I'm feeling really tired, because I've been up since 10:00 this morning). And probably what is the most evident--and provocative--aspect *aboot (*speakin' "Canada Talk" here) your physical appearance is that very sensual "5:00 shadow" evident on your face, revealing an alluring quality that is undeniable and so precisely excites the imagination! And now I'm just thinking about our First Date, where I would ask you to wear whimsical attire, that would include an airy dress that shows your ankles( Oh, my, what a treat that would be!), and wearing a revealing turtleneck sweater that suggests there's a hint of cleavage "in there" (somewhere), such that it begs the imagination, through one's eyes (only), to unravel the greater aspect of, like, how well "built" you are there! And I also have to imagine that we probably have soooo much in common, like, for example, we both take our teeth out at night and put them in a glass of water beside our beds; we both need enemas on a regular basis to keep us "on the go"; that we have hair on our bodies where there isn't supposed to be any; and that because both of us have bad breath, each cancels the other out (How cool is that?); AND...that we just enjoy each other's company and "goin' out on da town" pushing our respective walkers ahead of us. Ah, life IS really good, indeed!
I hope you got money from them!!!
Hi Mark, you never answered my email I sent you.
When A Youtuber forgets to change his background of green screen 😅
Do you ever tell them they need to take acting lessons to greatly improve their scam oppurtunities.
Alimoonium foil.... get it right! 😅
I just love glitter bombs.  I know you enjoyed working with Mark Rober.
Thx for your Help. Greetings from germany. I Love your Videos 👍👍👍👍👍
I love it
I love your work! I really enjoy your content and I try to help people to not get scammed based on the information you've given us. I already thought you were cute but when I saw you with lipstick and a wig, oddly, you're even cuter 😂😂😂
Im sorry. If u go to ur bank. .Mail off wrapped up cash , u deserve to be scammed. Lesson learned. Ppl could be wrapping up cash for drugs and just say they didn't know , it was a scam.
Hi Scammer payback. Is it possible to steel their money back. So far it is super cool to make them sad or angry. BUT I would like to see them loos all their money. I know it's criminal but would it be possible. My mom just lost 250.000 dkr. I think it's an English scam and they use Metamask and crypto money. A big thanks to you all. But how to level the payback. Best regards Jannik
Why did you blur out her face? I would like to know if she's my neighbor or someone I work with. your alowed to take picture of people  in public.
I just hope the person who recieved it was actually one of the scammers and not any victim cuz sometimes they do make you send money to another victim just so they can make more profit behind it
What did he think calling the cops was gonna do?😂
You tell me that you sent me too much money.. and you're going to lose your job...I would say "Ever think you might deserve it?"
Wow, Graham Richardson on this video.
Dude this channel makes me want a scammer to call me so I can repeat what I’ve heard here and freak them out. Make a game of it. How quick can I get them spooked?
Wait a min that glitter bomb was not in another country that um was in the US so I'm little confused 🤔?...
Too bad biden is letting them in over the border
Despite all these videos people are still falling victim to refund scams!! When will we learn?.…
They tried to scam me years ago, but little did they know, I was brokeana
"Dubblu, dubblu, dubblu..."🙈🙈🙈 Smartest cookie in the jar, right?
I got you drees like a girl bro no no no no 😂😂😂😂
Thank you very much you're doing a good service to the elder community.
Bring Vivian back! 😆
Subtitel indonesia plis seperti mark robert
Those glitter bombs are an awesome way to catch a mule.  I love hearing "Are you thirsty for more".
This is so awesome! Id love to join you all.
Excellent
Up here in Canada, we really enjoy watching your videos.  I wish someone in government would get scammed and then maybe they would not only take you seriously but also fund you and your team to continue what you guys are obviously very good at, protecting the public and shutting down scammers. Bravo 🎉👍🏼 Keep it up
Just awsome how we could fight back... 🙏👊
im confused. i thought the scammer was a male indian.
😮 in Quebec Canada on the News a day ago stated if you post the porch pirates photos on social media the police will arrest you because you broke there privacy rights stealing off of your property
😮 the Canadian popo do this computer forgery claiming to be a server and if you get scammed that tell you there's nothing that they can do to help you
Cracking up. This was so satisfying to watch. I just got my first romance scammer on Facebook today... I feel so LOVED 😀
FINALLY!
and nowadays he brought down a entire operation, congrats man
hm... chinese lady ey?
Gracias, for your grat work guerreros unidos👨🏻‍💻👨🏻‍💻👨🏻‍💻🙋🏻‍♀️
Great work Brother.
They almost got me for 2 thousand with geek squad. I even bought them, and I got to my truck in the parking lot and the security guard said you were scammed weren't you. I said I think I was. He asked if I scratched the back and I said no, and he then said come inside and he refunded my money. It was a day before Christmas. I call him Santa every time I see him at Rite Aid.
If I ever need to induce vomiting, I try to imagine how one of these call centers smells.
i got called 3 timess from scam callers.
Thank you buddy for keeping people safe from being deprived of their hard earn savings money.. 👏 I'm from india.. Thank you❤
11:08   Porch pirate digs in his backside LOLOL!!!!!
Theft  =   BY   ANY   MEANS    =   """   IS   A   CRIME    """    !!!
God bless you and others for helping all of us.❤
Tak!
👍👍👍 THANK YOU AND YOUR FELLOW HACKER CRACKERS FOR YOUR PRICELESS WORK 👍👍👍
with this accent and with this behavior how come people are being scammed its weird . I believe they always target old people because they are emotional 🥺🥺🥺🥺
you are really good at scamming the scammers
We have to thank you.  Thank you for your service to the society.  I love watching your videos.  It's very satisfying.  Best greetings from Germany
New scam over Facebook…   They say they want to buy your item over marketplace.. Then they say they will do it via PayPal..:   Then send a email saying X amount is pending, an it’s coming from a business account..   Then say the account needs upgrading, from a personal to business account.. an they will say they have sent the extra $240 an they need it sending back..   Or they call you up saying there debt management company… an to organise payments..   BE CAREFUL OUT THERE..!!  DON’T GET SCAMMED.!!
Thats some serious techno sorcery going on ...😮
Thanks to your whole team for fighting for our elderly
what if you did this with 0$ in your bank lol
what sofware do you use to call them
Keep up the noble work Perogi.
I don't know why but Pierogi is one sexy grandma. 😉
the editing on this is so over the top
I'd like to know why all these bass-turds have ALL American names like Steven, Dave etc. with the last name Williams???? I've NEVER met a pure Indian person with a totally American name! Bastads.
Thanks for what you do.  My demented mother has fallen for 3 scams.
Thing is...we want them to lose their jobs.
Pierogi, mate there are not enough words to describe the work you do, you are a champion…. Keep fighting the fight, one day the right people will listen, you are saving lives and livelihoods…. Well done mate, just well done
HEY! nie przewidzieliście w swoim pomyśle że nasi przyjaciele "inżynierowie" przyzwyczajeni są do gówna. Zaczęło mu tam psikać płynnym stolcem astra zeneca i stoi niewzruszony hahaha
Thank you❤
0:37  you guys totally ROCK!!!!!
Pierogi you and your colliegs are angels
This happened to me claim to me from Amazon
Such a hero… atleast for me . Thanks much

I'd like to imagine adult kevin McAllister doing something similar to perogi as an adult
👍👍👍👍👍
I will share this!!  But didn't trilogy media go to India?
I love what you do, but please don’t ever dress as a woman again, it’s disturbing…..I’m going to have nightmares.
7:59 am. Thanks for your amazing work brother. I live in an elderly community here in Chandler Arizona and it's just brutal. These are older, retired and vulnerable . Arizona is a huge retirement area for people who come here from all over the world and get ripped off by scammers. So I thank you and your team for what you are doing. Having morning coffee,a fatty of what I grow, and watching the scumbags get what they deserve.
Thank you guys for what your doing. It does need to be stopped that's for sure. Thanks again
A scammer almost got my mom for 150,000$. She called me saying a man needed access to her computer so he could have her make a payment to health insurance. I drove 100mph to her house telling her to unplug the computer and Ethernet cable. She wouldn’t cause she reallly thought it was the United healthcare. I ran into her house and I could see him moving the mouse across her bank login page and he was trying to reset her password to get into the account. I ran over yelled at the lowlife loser while unplugging the internet and power to the computer. She almost lost half gopher retirement money. Soooooo scary. Similar thing happened to my aunt where they needed her to drive to get prepaid visas totaling 750.00$. Luckily she listened to me over the phone and hung up on the guy before she gave him the card numbers. My rule I set for everyone is if someone texts or calls from a company tell them you personally are going look up the company service number and get ahold of them that way. So if it’s legit or not the real company can confirm or deny. Also never let anyone remotely control your laptop or iPad. I’m so good at calling out scams. Usually if they sound like a derka derka towel head they’re scammers. F them, lowlife thieves. Losers!!
I really love what you do. I’m so glad I came across your channel. I wish I have known about you sooner since my boyfriend was scammed for $4000 with bounced checks that they were depositing into his account. And now he is in debt because of it. I don’t have the scammers number anymore. But I am happy to see someone like you is doing something about it.
Keep up the good fight. I really appreciate you
Thank you Mark, Jim, and Pierogi for continuing to push on and fight the scumbag scammers all around the globe. 👍
Why is Perogi still looking good dressed up as a woman? 😨 this man could really wear anything 😂
Keep going guys!!!  If you need any help in Tennessee, let me know!
Not all heroes wear capes....They carry a glitter bomb!!! XD  you're a good bloke. Very fond of you and your team working hard to flush these dickswabs out x
I'm so tired of the 20 plus scam calls daily. Makes me wanna off myself. Makes me so angry. I told one guy today that I knew where they were. They tried denying it and when I said .. oh really well that's not what perogie just told me....they hung up😂😂😂
Vivian 😂 looks pretty good.
Love your videos! You make a cute woman 😻
Uwielbiam Pierogi, Good bless You Bro !!!
"Boo hoo! I can't get my stolen money! Boo hoo hoo!''
"Lovin on me"? WTF does that even mean?
Thanks bro !!
Nice
You all are the best! God bless you guys and gals. Keep up the good work. When nobody else thinks that nothing can be done because it's overseas. Keep up the grind
Who on earth would've disliked this video?? 😒
A collaboration of the most AWESOME people in the world. Thanks for being "the heroes we need"...
I was a victim of a Amazon scam and also a cash app scam. Where I was selling something. I wish you had been around then. I love what  you do. 😂
Sir I want to work with you.tell me if possible.From India...🎉❤
You are my hero! Please keep doing what you are doing! Expose those scumbags!
How much is the glitter?
Why do they want you stay on the phone? My sister had the IRS scam done to her. The had her go to the store and buy a bunch of gift cards and give the scammer the #'s. They told her to stay on her cell phone too. Threatened her that she would go to jail if she didnt get the cards. She was very gullible and did every thing they said and lost thousands of dollars. When she told me about it I cringed and told her she was scammed and to report it to the police. Mean people!
You are Heroes ❤
You are right,  a coalition and coordination is needed with government and law enforcement to support your efforts. Thank you and God bless as well as God speed.
Thank you
Love you vivian rogers 💕
your the man bro salute....
scammer payback smurf  rules😂😉👍🏻. keep up the good work.
I have emailed the senator,  I have insulted the prosecutor attorney. They don't want to stop this
A big Thank you from India, Perogi, Mark, Jim, and many others who do this! We need more soldiers like you!
I enjoy your personas, you are hilarious 😂
In the past 6 months there has been an unbelievable increase in scamming in Greece...  I work in a large retail company and the amount of people buying cards for google etc has increased dramatically. The other day there was a woman, 75yo, buying a card to pay for the supposed phone bills, thank god one of our cashiers noticed something was wrong and stopped her.
I learnt something from this video
Please teach me to hack this scammer
Blue hair rainbow glitter you a from behind kind
Was she actually arrested?
People need to kno to refresh the page when they spoof your account if this ever happens
Keep the fight on men, God Bless you and your family and your whole team out there
I wish I could do this, I would just do it in my free time for fun lol if u guys need some helping hands plz, teach me lol
Watching again 2 years after this posted and you’re almost at 7 million subbies. That shows what a difference you’re making. Keep up the fight. We’re behind you! 💪🏼✊🏼
Thank you for everything you do,I love you guys
YESSSSSS🎉🎉🎉🎉
I've recently found SP, but I've fallen in love with this channel. You do good work. My grandmother actually got scammed a couple of years ago, she was able to get her money back but there are so many who don't.  Thank you for doing what you do ❤
8:50 they want to stay on the phone, this cracked me up every time... 😂😂😂😂
My bank is $ 10,000 limit to get cash any more and you have to fill in a bunch of forms .
Thank you so much for the work you do.I appreciate this content and all of your hard work!
Joining forces with Mark Rober is  like the trifecta. I’ve missed seeing his glitter bombs. Perfect.
Look at you guys now Pierogi!!! You created something really good out of nothing, with “only” some help of Trilogy and Mark! Nice to have you
WOW! Vivian is hot!😂
WITH MARK ROBER, WOW YOU HAVE BLOWN UP FAST
😂 still loving it was fun when we talked also to think you again for the help when I needed but I still say lets find the top one and rob them
I absolutely despise mark rober. hes just throwing around money to get some clicks. i dont know him personally but the things he shows off proves how he is disconnected from "normal" people.
Bless the glitter bomb!!!!😂😂😂
Glitter bombs are great!
If this happened, I be like, thanks for the  cash, CLICK!
Nice!! I love this!!!!
Puffy Perogi is fighting the food fight.🤣
Id love to keep them on the line while you all do your stuff they have gotten a lot out of me in the past. Id love to help other victims.
they never have a mercyyy, you will never hack me yeah postmalone
You 3 guays are not Just i personne. You are the brain you are they Best in the world
The giller on her...PRICELESS!
Mark Rober is a mad genius.
Love hanging up when they say, "Don't hang up!"
❤ too many ❤can you help us in Hong Kong
Hahaha, the “I love you” and Post Malone song sent meeee 😂😂😂
This is brilliant 🤩
Vivian Rodgers is a smoke show 🥵🥵
pierogi to takie jedzenie
His tears must taste like the finest liquor. 😃🍺
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🎯🙏💯🎯🙏💪💪💪💪💪💪💯💯💯
Lately they have moved over into payday  online loan scams thanks to you all I was able to spot them
If the person calling me has an Indian accent, I hang up. Unfortunately it's the best way for me to stay safe, and I advise everyone to employ the same tactic. Better safe than sorry. I'd rather be accused of being "a racist" then lose my life savings.
This is why never trust anyone from India, including the corrupt government and police force
Enter Mark Rober!!! 💥 😂
these guys are amazing and how you keep your patience is umbelievable. These scammers seem (to me) to be so obvious in what they are doing - but we need to educate the public who seem to believe in it all - Just cant believe it - Knowledge will spread and hopefully governments will get onboard and catch these b@stards!..  Alan/Uk
YES YES YES WE LOVE GLITTER BOMBS 💣 ARREST ALL SCAMMER HEADS!!!!!    YOU ALL ROCK!!!!!!🙏🙏😎😎😎👍👍👍👍👍👍Send them all a BIG FAT 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💣💣💣💣💣
Vivian kind of a baddie ngl lol
❤💚💙
Wow...! I never could've imagined how gorgeous Vivian Rogers is...! She's quite a looker...!!! Thanks, keep up your awesomeness and don't forget to compliment someone today...
Hello, my country,Thailand has many scammers. I want you to help them because there are people who are targeted by scammers almost every day. Thank you.
There’s a way to stop these calls it’s called Nomorobo you can put your number on their list for free and they have a cell app too never got a call again
I had someone trying to access my bank account repeatedly threw Uber. Can’t take money out of an empty account lol. Guess that’s the good part of having had your identity stolen no one wants to steal my credit anymore they just keep trying to give it back lol
😎👍
You guys are awesome , this is something i would love to be part of. I hate scammers
I'm playing the world's smallest violin.
Please no sound effects. I'm listening to your videos on my stereo system.
Do you still do this in 2023?
Thank you for what you do for our livelihood. You make the world a better place to be in. If I could I would give you guys all the money in the world to expose these scumbags who think they can get away with stealing money from others. This is something that needs to change and quick. Thanks again YOU ROCK!
Please report to FBI all these indian scammers. they dont have rights to work and live and do living in the Western Countries.
My favorite part of these videos is seeing what the latest desktop wallpaper they got up there. Lots of cute kittens. 😂😂
You should have used the ink that the banks use
Love your work❤❤❤❤❤
My rich grandma got scammed 1m dollars 😢
I think Vivian Rodgers is the love of my life 😍
This Just prove, that we all, can pich in, and help where ever we can. Just look at this vid, it starts whit 1 person!!  Bless your soul!!!!  You Are the modern Robin Hood
I just dont understand why they make the people transfer the money manually. Why dont they just install a keylogger before the people login to their bank account?
The biggest thank you is to you guys.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 wow appreciate you
We love you too.
i bought a hat, i love the content. this is amazing
At 7:28 When he says he’s looking for Steve Wilson then says he’s driving home reminded me of “Drive Home” by Steven Wilson 😂
Why is there a timer? Is this a speedrun?
This is so wonderful. I've recently been scammed. No money or bank information was exchanged but it was still scary. Thank you so much for doing this.
So cool
bahahahahahah L + glitter-bomb+ ratio
Vivian ❤❤😂
The Vivian segment was gold.

Great work! Thank you so much we love what you're doing. Sending love and best wishes xo
I recently found out this channel and ever since I'm binge watching all of your episodes.. You guys are incredible... I have watched over 20 to 25 videos so far and never seen Vivian until today 😂 it was too good.. The pierogi ik now feels like would never do something goofy 😅😅 anyways ty guys for everything❤
Great your my brother..I will be sending you some funds for support soon ....thank you so much for your efforts
Lol 😂 10:11
Okay... I lost it when you dress up If you put on wig properly and clean shave I would not recognise you 🤣🤣🤣
Only found out about this channel yesterday, you guys are brilliant.  Well done!!!
P lookin a little too happy dressed up as Vivian lol
I got emotional Perogi  these scammers are out of pocket
Stumbled upon this absolute gem of a channel, keep it up!!!
Do not worry . Pay back will be hard in the next life
Is vivian Rodgers single?hahaha
Love your work. we need more poeple in the world like you and you group.
i just realized how much of a wonder tool voice deepfaking and other complex language based ai could be in the future.  older folk all around the world (most of whom, i’d imagine, don’t understand english at all or only very rudimentarily unless it’s their mother tongue) will be able to understand extremely helpful content like this.
Poor Steven….I fell so bud
Thank you all for doing this. So many people get taken advantage of. I have many try to scam me, but I didn't fall for it. Unfortunately many do get scammed and you are their voice!! Bless the three of you
Just found this, love what they are doing! Thanks for fighting for us that are getting scammed.
Nice work - get all those thieving BASTARDS - YaYa
🤩You’re sO pretty as a gurl P🥰🥰🥰
Awesome dude congrats!!!  We really to wake up thanks for your hard work!!!
I love that they got her, next is the scammers over in the other countries.  This is super dope
0:01 hey yall
What became of that lady?  Did she get charged at all?
Who gets scammed by this so ludicrous !
Literally got a spam call during this 🤦‍♀️
Thank you so much for your amazing work - it is wonderful that there are experts like you helping vulnerable people. Can you tell me how to make a donation to you (other than Super Thanks) - I cannot seem to find that information. Thank you
You mention several times about people need to wake up. That is so true!! Laziness, and not paying attention to whats happening!! It is so crazy to watch people walk right into trouble. I dont mean just older folks who are vulnerable. Technology is so amazing yet instills a false sense of security especially when it comes to common sense.
So... What if you just keep the money?
12:49 here’s the part we’ve been waiting for.
Just saying you all are descendants of Europeans who have now settled in America .... and India was colonized by several European countries .....Most White Americans are of British origin...So in a way consider it a Payback for the  exploitation by your forefathers .... dont support it though just rationalizing ... it is payback... if they are stupid enough to be fooled they should be fooled
You should now come to India 😍
7:14 look at that broken english, and he wants to talk in American accent 🤣🤣🤣
Him in the future belike : *today we will be sending a nuclear bomb for the center call*
Thanks for being a good guy!!
Wodnerful vid!
oh boy more glitterbomb footage
How can I learn to do what you do?
The Collab we never expected
The camera was actually seeing footage in REVERSE (مقلوبة)
I love what you guys do, it’s absolutely beautiful seeing giving these assh*les a taste of their own medicine! I regretfully admit I’ve recently been duped by a scam on IG so I know how it feels and the fact you guys are giving it back to the Scummers…sorry I mean scammers is fantastic! Thank you SP 💪🙏
You guys are awesome keep up the good work
Great thanks dude! You are awesome
What do you think they would say if you said "yeah, I'd like to renew my subscription and not cancel it"
We love you brother, you doing the best💜
You guys are absolutely amazing. Thank you for what use do.
@markrober U R the best!
“You guys give up or ya thirsty for more?”😂😂😂😂😂😂😅12:53
If it wasn't for the whiskers I could quite fancy blonde Pierogi.
You have no idea how many of these are stopped by the transporter. Also, courier is something completely different. Might be pendantic but its annoying af to those of us who worked in the industry being called "courier" or "speditor" or whatever else, those are completely different services.
They are the worst actors of all time
you are a sweet lady. hilariious..
Excellent!!! Bob
did she get arrested?
You gave back there money why?? You should have look on who they scam and give it to them
Epic ❤
Dont stop just continue more power idol
I've been watching these videos for days straight now lol. But in all seriousness I wish so badly I could do what you all do! Out here doing Gods work for all of us!
Yo
Please keep up the good work !!
Lol call it dirty dust.
Lol they really put on the pity party.Real scum bags,while they rob you blind.
Thanks!
I’m binge watching ur videos lol NICE🎉
Go Pierorgi GO!🤣🙂
Out airborne standing God bless
‘Me?’ 💀
We need more of these glitter bomb scammer traps.
Thanks!
You are a hero dude mad respect to you and your team and family
They should add spray glue to the fart spray and a pinch of potassium permangenate to the glitter and then mix it all together; that way the glitter and fart smell sticks to anything it touches and trying to wash it off with water stains everything a deep purple colour that's virtually impossible to remove, marking the perpetrators and the crime scene while wrecking their carpets/lounges/car interiors etc; that's the least that they deserve.
You guys are literal superheroes.
Why didn’t you update us on what happened to the mule? Even if she wasn’t charged I and I’m sure other viewers would be really interested in knowing.
You guys are AWESOME!! This makes me furious ppl are being scammed like this! Thank you for your work!
Vivian 😂
We'll done!
Viewer: "hey cute prank". YouTuber: (dramatic music), thanks guys for changing the world with us today. This moment is history".
I love your you tube channel  but I am unable  to join in the membership  because  I have no real bank account current at the moment.  I still enjoy all.your programs that you share keep up the great work .
a way u can fix the html when u think its a scam is refresh the page and it'll say changes will be made then it means html got edited
Love it
Good on you I hope these scum get what they deserve  xxx
The scammers   b s names ??  Yeah right
You guys are the best, Thankyou for all you do
Punjab greasy Punks
How sickening 😡 real POS!! I can't believe that someone has the heart to do this. I can't picture someone taking all my grandmother's money... Oh yeah, I can't believe he went to the police station 😂 uhh yeah, officer I was scamming this old lady and she glitter bombed me! 😂
My mother has been scammed multiple times & currently waiting for her funds to be restored by her bank here in Australia-the money went to France. I’ve put her onto this channel in the HOPE she won’t respond to scams in future. She is 80 & doesn’t understand scammers make it LOOK legit….it’s their LIVING!
You my friend, are a true hero. Thank you for what you do.
Thanks
you doing  a good thing  i have been i lawenforcement for 3 years   and this needs to stop
You did it

When bro acts like he's crying he sounds like my 6 year old nephew trying to talk normally.....
Crying Steven sounds just like Amber Heard
I live basically down the road from where this happened @_@
I love all the collab..!
U guys are mean as! What a great channel! More power to u! N more glitter bombs!🤣
A woman committed suicide after she lost all her  money, so you may be saving lives😊
I’m sorry, but i don’t get it..? So the scammer lives in texas and is using voice changer? Cuz the one that picked up the package is a girl right while the voice is a guy…. I really have one brain cell so if someone can explain 😢
9:26 *¡¡¡GUAPOOOOO!!!*  🤩😍
Amazing
I am an Indian sorry for what a minority of us are doing to world
Happy Holi !!!
That. Was. Amazing 🎉
❤
How about a sh*t slurry bomb designed to go off when the box is opened.
Thanks!
Some guys from India tried to scam me by telling me they were from Microsoft Windows and I had a virus. They said I was on the dark Web looking at inappropriate things. They started asking me what number my credit card started with. Initially I thought it was a legitimate Microsoft Windows alert. Please warn people about this.
Keep giong guys well done👍👍
8:29 lololol
The scammers are always so calm about losing so much money, lol
I've been curios since I started watching you on how you got started in this, was a grandparent or another loved one get scammed?  Or maybe a good friends grandparent, because I kow they mainly target the elderly. I'm 60 and luckily I'm married to a younger man that knows a thing or two about computers and scams etc..  But most fellow boomers don't know shite from shinola about this. I send it to all my boomer friends. Spread the word! Stay Groovy✌~N~❤~&~ Granny Hugs👵🤗🤗
you are no halal
Dubloo dubloo dubloo dot…..🤔
Hlo sir  I love ur work keep it work for huminity
❤❤❤❤ we love you ❤❤❤
If you need a female to help go after them email me
OMFG @ 9:28 😂😂  WOW bro you look hilarious 👍🤣 Thanks for the great work and laughs as always man 💪
Y'all are AMAZING!!!!
The fact that your partnership with Mark and the glitter bombs is amazing and I love seeing these assholes get caught!
The final revenge will come when these f thieves find a desperate terminally ill person who sends them a real non-glitter thing with shrapnel. For the dying person  (e.g. sapper), it will not matter who will be present at the opening and what the consequences will be. Only when thieves start dying will they start to be afraid. When I see the scale of these scams, the likelihood of a package being sent back that will fatally harm the entire family of a thief or mule is highly probable. And who would feel sorry for the thief's family? Watching the glitter b series, I saw that for some families, including children, robbing even the neighbors is their daily bread.
Some seem so extreme like who wouldn't question having to send cash that way to a business 🤔 i get how gullible some can be but this is just too much.
Brilliant 😂
Wow pierogi looks pretty good in that get up
Wow you ALL got that do e. WOW YOU ALL ROCK!!!!!
9:28 "care to give a free sample to a pretty lady". "Yeah you know one"
Nail them to the wall....YOU AND YOUR GUYS ROCK
Just send them a claymore. Would be more effective 😀
I'm still confused, not everyone is sending a package to these people. Or maybe it does 🙁 how do people who are located in India wire or transfer money to them, don't you see where money was payed on a wire transfer... I just found out about this even though I'm not anyones  80yr grandma...
Vivian is hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
9:35 Is that real money or Hollywood prop money?
If you go to India be careful
Can you teach me how to do what u do
I only recently happened upon your channel, and all I can say is, you need to give your mom a huge hug from me for raising a son with more care and compassion than I have ever seen toward the vulnerable among us.  I thought I was protecting myself, and doing it well, apparently not. I lost 1500, in 10 minutes. Thieves video taped me entering my pin code at a store. When I left, I was approached by a man asking if I knew where the closest tire store was...being polite, I tried explaining while he acted confused. Finally he said a thousand thank yous, and I drove home an hr away. The decoy kept me distracted while a person slipped my wallet out of my purse. It took me 2 hours before realizing I had "lost" my wallet. Called the banks etc...that's when I found out my daily limit of 1500.00 was taken. Being robbed was bad enough...having your bank refuse to honor their policy was worse. I was told that since they had my pin, it was my fault, and yeah....robbed twice in a way.
😂
"I love you " when you hang up 😂😂😂😂
good editing
this is super awesome
I have a computer. And I work from home. Teach me how to do this. I’d love to help people.
I love how she's all glittery!
I dont feel bad for wasting their time, or being downright nasty to these animals when they call. They don't deserve any sort of leniency or compassion. Just a nice kiss on the cheek with a brick.
We have  scammers in texas? F**CK THEM
Does anyone get text msg with a link talking about your Amazon account?
Thankyou Pierogi
You are absolutely fantastic we love you keep going never stop xoxoxo
i may need your help guys
he the man
This made my day best one ever
This is one of the best channels on YouTube! Pierogi Fucking RULZ!!!
My dad died from a heart attack when the scammers came back for the rest. He had his identity stolen and they got almost everything. But a couple months later they came back for his house. They told him if he didn’t pay $75,000 they would take his house. He believed them and had a heart attack from the stress and died. Thank you for what your doing. You’re literally saving lives.
You’re going to go down in history as the first, like a Texas Rangers of our times!!!  I got taken for 400 months after my son passed suddenly and then 3 months later my husband/his dad left me for his lady bartender friend (luckily I guess) ~  I got home from work, exhausted, depressed and just trying to figure out a new normal ~my computer was locked, I called the number and you know the rest!!  It’s been awhile and I enjoy watching all of you make them miserable 😖 ~~ I’m laughing and living vicariously through you!!!  Please keep going!! It’s amazing to watch and learn
Vivian Rogers for president 👍👌😀
"Dablu dablu dablu" xD
LET'S GO SCAMMER PAYBACK AND MARK ROBER!!!!!!!!!!!
I still dont understand how people actually send money in boxes and dont realize that something fishy is going on.
great work ....to many people scamming in the world today ..comes in many different forms .....hate it
9:30 pause 🤨
New scam... they say they are from mygov or child support and refund waiting... That's here in Australia atm.. me and hubby got one at different times.
Its the post Malone song for me I'm crying 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 And I also Vivian is simply beautiful And I freaking love you Dude your so Dope blessings🙌🙌💙💙
Thank s a lot to all of your team , fortunately old ladies were lucky to have this program to help them,BRAVO!!!
Buddy, your passion to correct these scumbags is admirable! You really ought to start a company where the sole intent is for your company to fix these parasites! You ARE AWESOME!!! GOD BLESS YOU for caring about this GREAT COUNTRY!!!
Is there a reason why scammers use a older version of windows.
This happened near where I live!!
Great teeth make it easy to come back
I'm so happy I found your channel I was scammed 6 weeks ago... I wanted to cancel my Facebook and I couldn't find a phone number to call Facebook so I went on Google and an 800 number came up for technical support I called it they immediately got on the phone with me and said my Facebook was hacked and so was my bank and venmo and several other things I had on my phone and they had to fix all that 1st before they could cancel my Facebook so I said OK... They ended up getting into my bank account and onto my venmo account it put $2000 into my bank and wanted me to send it back I got kind of scared... Come to find out they opened up a venmo credit card for $4000 on my   Venmo account sending 2000 of it into my checking account and wanted me to send it back to them I hung up and refuse to speak to them agait was considered frbut I was terrified for several days after thinking they were gonna come after me for the money they were indiand I have the man's phone number he said his name was Peter from Facebook.. I don't know how to attach his call his contact to this message but I'm more than happy to give you his phone number please get back to me I'd like them to be stopped
You make a better female then some of these people that have transitioned.  Lol.
Thank you, I love what you do.
I just subscribed on accident
This was awesome!  Thank you all for what you do!!!
one of the most satisfying video, proud of you seeing police pull up on her. I watch all of your videos
Vivian Roger's demistrating the package part is so sweet of her and she looks so beautiful and glowing
Your welcome pierogi
but im from india and im not a scammer :( not everyone is scammers in india :(
the crying made me roll around my room lol
Absolutely priceless
Use a different name bedsides Vivian Rodgers
You guys are awesome! Thank you for what you do. 😇
Hello! you guys give up or your tasty for more.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I am 61 years old, registered disabled. no one is interested in my well being. What I mean by that is one becomes invisible to normal society. Government is not interested, even people in shops who barge on by or give the famous TUT when you are not fast enough. You too will be old and if you don't protect people like me (General society), then simply a man in Kolkata will be spending your inheritance. Visit your elderly relatives are we are invisible. Ask questions?
Okay, on that note, I'm going to bed now. That was absolutely freaking fantastic. Nothing like a crotch shot with glitter embedded on those blue jeans. Blessings to your whole crew; I am so excited for my hat to arrive
Safe to say, any call with an Indian voice...Hang up.
Keep it up, don’t stop! The Government should be helping you out for providing this service, since they’re either too inept or incapable of doing anything.
I love your show honestly. I took a 2 year course in college for computer systems technicians and you have refreshed my memory on what type of work your doing. Keep it up. I love it
HHAAAA, AWESOME! 😂🤣😅. ✨👏🏼😎✨
Vivienne looks terrific!
Thank you you're absolutely amazing Because it happened to me The guy was from India  The glitter bomb was awesome
Im subscribing just for the outro
We thank you. It’s a great shame and a disgrace that governments don’t have tougher departments dealing with this robbery.
The one call I get about five times a day is from Health Market Place. I’m looking into blocking numbers and reporting. They always hang up when I try to waist their time.
👍
Love this one!! Glad you worked with Mark Rober, love the things he does!!
I wanna know how to make a glitter bomb
hey i know this video was a year ago but last friday i got called by a scam center and i just hung up after i heard the basic line "you need your computer and dowload anydesk"
Yooo
Thank you! My 85 yr old father was scammed out of 2000.00 in the infamous grandparent scam. He was so embarrassed  that he fell for it, so I thank you for your dedication to getting justice for seniors, and everyone that gets caught in these scams. I’m so happy for you that you were able to see your work in action. God bless.❤
My question is what if u want to keep the service and tell them that?
top 10 sigma trios
Bro made an film trailer for 5 se onds and tought we wouldn't notice 💀💀💀💀
I didnt know pierogi scammed in the thumbnail!!
i love watching ur videos
Why isn't the government funding you
Why isn't the government doing this. I'll tell you why. That would to much like right what a fucked up world
Keep up the good work
These videos have taught me that I am not half the person these victims are because 1) I would not give the "money" back 2) even if i were so inclined to give the money back, there's no way I have the time and energy to ship cash with all these ridiculous instructions. I can barely get Amazon items returned! And you don't even need to box thoae anymore! It is so sad that some of the most moral and most organized people among us are the ones being scammed.
Wow. Heroes.superpeople.
hey i wanna help you guys, i'm web developer how can i help you?
Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha Pierogi in a female get up ❤️❤️🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Brilliant man they are the scum of the earth, get them all locked up and shut them down.
Hmm...how do we REALLY know,this isn't a Tekkit Realm sort of thing? Blind faith? 🤔
You sir are great
Not Perogi dressed as Vivian Rogers, I love the dedication 👏🏼 💕
If I really did get refunded 50k I'd let the dude get fired and celebrate.   These people are too nice.
I love these glitter bombs!
Do it aagain with 5.0
you have some polish roots?I ask because pierogi is a Polish word, or more precisely, the name of a dish
Thanks. You educated both me and my wife so when we have gotten these approaches from them we caught on and haven't fallen victim. They are getting more sophisticated so we continue to watch as you reveal new methods.
Show their faces
Your amazing at what you do and your mannerism in which you get them on chat 👌
Thank you for not only educating me about scammers, but more for how you’re taking these scumbags down!
i know he is a scammer but...my name is steve to and thats a little bit sad._.
l cannot understand why the American g0verment spend  money to stop these criminals over two billion dollars annually is scammed from the elderly and all levels of society causing poverty,suicide, marriage breakups and a host of other terrible causes, if it was'nt for people such as SCAMMER PAYBACK and a small host of other hero scambaiters  the general public would not be informed of the slime tactics these lowlife scumbags use to steal money please donate any small amount to help these scambaiter heroes
Love your work mate. 👊👏👏👏👏
Sometimes they'll have you sign up for a site like Robin Hood that's a broker to move your money so they can steal it from the Robinhood account
Mark Rober:   Why are you still in California?   It is turning into the 3rd world.   You might get murdered.
Imagine getting caught for being a scammer but you're covered in glitter and smell like sh!t
Of rats, roaches, farts, and glitter, I think the roaches are the best.
Thanks! Love you guys!
I so love scammers getting what they give! They only got me once saying I needed to change my password on PayPal, after changing the pass I noticed the crazy html……then I had to change everything.  Never again! but crazy how they don’t care they just keep thieving. How come they start charging with small amounts and work up to larger ones?
Fantastic!! Mark Rober and Pierogi teamwork!!
Glitter bomb? Next time send them a "real bomb". KA-BOOOOOOM!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥⚱️⚱️⚱️☄️☄️☄️
if you guys ever need an extra hand id love to help in any way i can!
Hahahahahahaha🤣🤣🤣🤣 Stop crying! I didn't raise you this way.
Go to INDIA
Dont put  money anymore in the bank  if the bank   Cant  protect  your money  Your money not anymore safe in the bank
If they ask you your bank accnt they’re scammer
Love ya, Vivian! 😘
Keep up the good work and yes I am also worried about our seniors and I posted that to family and friends. Please update me with other YouTube scams!
Git him
Bro when I saw vivian rodgers I was cracking up!!! We love you guys
At least get the company name right .. gig squad?? lol... they're such losers!!!
Instead of glitter you should send C4
Grandma pierogi got me shocked
I’m so happy I found your channel. Can’t thank you enough for all the work you do! I’ll be sharing with all my friends!
You welcome bro would like to meet you guys drink some beers. Real life WATCH DOGS
God bless you all
Get'em!
I'm very proud and Thankful for you all. Please keep up the AWESOME WORK!
this has been happening in canada since over 15 years ago. it was brought up in the house of commons (harper) and was never addressed. the rcmp here just don't care.
Why would anybody fall for this? INDIAN ACCENT PUT THE PHONE DOWN IMMEDIATELY!
This POS scammers are crooked than a lawyer
I would have never thought I'd see Pearland police catch a scammer on youtube!!!!! I grew up in Pearland and am shocked to see that a small quiet town has these types of individuals living in it.
WHY did you protect that scumbags identity????
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
you should wear a cape because you are a superhero bro
feels so disgusted to know that this is happening from my country, how cruel can people get. on behalf of the entire country I apologize to everyone who has fallen for this kind of scam. so sorry guys, please stay vigilant and thank you so much scammer payback for doing what you do.
Funny how all theses Indians scammer have English names
Thank you bud. Appreciate your time knowledge n sharing it with me!
9:27 I was drinking, not anymore
Im like wait why is there a timer 3:11  😂😂😂
You are awesome!!!! Thanks!
✊✊✊
We love you 🙌🙌
Bro I just want to tell you that there's a lot of new scams around and you should tell this to the people. Whenever ppl see on the YouTube msg with the picture from that YouTuber and his name but with telegram @, and they say msg me at the telegram you won the prize and usually that's macbook or iPhone, so you buy them gift cards and that's for mailing service so that they can send it to you. Please inform people not to do this.
"don't cry son, I didn't raise you this way" 😭
YOUR A STAR⭐ ...SO GRATEFUL 🙏💖
thank you for all the effort you put into this line of work. your passion, dedication, ferocity and willingness to protect those who aren't able to see the red flags of the scammer is admirable!  i'm lucky to be able to pick up on the red flags and don't easily give out private info, but i am not tech savvy like you are lol appreciate  you and your team for what you do!
Don't go to India! 💀Just send more glitter bombs!
Thanks for your work!
I share this channel with Everyone I know.  I'm constantly surprised at how many  of my own friends have been scammed.
We need more people like this. I can't explain how much there needs to be more caution on the use of the internet. I believe this is a absolute new form of authority.  Happy you are bringing awareness to this; and possibly to other mediums of cyber unethical matters.
THANKS HAVE A NICE WEEK
THANKS HAVE A NICE WEEK
Keep going brother!
09:30 KAAAAAAAAA-BOOM!
We need a uni-bomber approach not a glitter bomb
Vivian is so sexy! 🤣🤣🤣 another great video. I send these to my mom and last 2 remaining grandparents
U look like mark rober
I wonder what would happen if you start sending them grenades
I like your video sir, I want you also to track scammers at website flatforms who are asking to diposit cash to their website, I hope you can do that soon sir, to pay back all scammers who scam poor people
Other than the beard stubble, Vivian is kinda hot.
Respect man !! 🫡
We need more people like you please don't stop this  I am a computer engineering and you are  my inspiration
I wish I knew if you in 2017 as I fell in a scam
I'd be darned if I stood in front of a package while it was counting down...then again we aren't dealing with braniacs here 🤓 lol
the only way to stop these scams is to give these scammers death sentence if they are caught or else these scameers will keep on going
I'm so glad you managed to save so many people and the lives you have saved thank you.
U can't hate India it's just a poor country but the hand full of people doing it hurts India's name thinking all of the people are thiefs that live in India Thiefs and criminals live everywhere all over the world
Brilliant! Excellent work.
I need help
Seriously would love to work with you guys...been scammed more than once , but in the way of hacking my bank account. Absolutely hate these people & their despicable tactics! About time someone figured out a way to get them back cuz the law can hardly do anything about it!
I don't condone violence, but to see a video where these scammers get get followed home and a good old fashion beat download be amazing!
I'm so glad to see this kind of act. My father was scammed last month 😭
I live in San Antonio, Texas and we have a major problem with Porch Pirates - lucky for us we also have a sympathetic governor that allows us to shoot a person on our property committing a criminal offense!  I would still love to have one of your glitterbombs for those thieving little hands to behold. Let me know how to contact you because I'm willing to pay for the GB or otherwise.  Thank you.
WHERE IS THE ACTUAL VIDEO OF THE BOMB ??? IT'S NOT THE BOMB OR? LAME
Vivian needs a shave
I still have a hard time believing how anyone could be convinced into mailing CASH to anyone...I know it happens but it's just so odd.
You are the definition of a true hero we love you
Scammers crying in a corner..
If y'all want to go even farther why not steal from them and give it to needy people.?????
If I was there, I would play like Winston Churchill, those who know history, know who is.
Your Welcome ☺️
Awesome!  Keep up the good work!
I learn a lot from these keep doing this
I was almost scammed trying to get a payday loan and they were on there long story short a lady called saying that they would give a loan for $7,000 and when the lady ask for my username and password a red flag went up I shut account and told her I’m calling the police and I called my bank
Since India is in cahoots with Russia why do we tolerate these goofs any longer
I think you should sell Vivian Rodgers wigs on your merch site
Pearland Texas that's funny right outside of Houston
I think that you should write and submit articles to publications, geared towards senior citizens. AARP, etc. You could reach a LOT of the most vulnerable people, hopefully BEFORE they are targeted.
Hilarious and infuriating.May you forever continue!
good team up all around
Awesome I wish it could've had Skunk Oil spray to boot
Why blurr her face?
Thumbs up :)
Most if not all scammers are Indian so I think I’ll know whenever I’m getting scammed
The only way is to get the people who pick up the package arrested. Or some how get access to these people computer
That is one ugly girl lol
Why they always talk like compuoiter 😹
Thank you so much Mate what you doing all the best in 2023 from England btw  have same problem here in UK
😀👍
why block out their faces?
Thank you for your hard work. MAY GOD BLESS YOU, AND PLEASE CONTINUE EXPOSING THESE CRIMINALS.
Robin Hood be Robin Hood?
God bless you!❤
Amazing what ur doing ma brotha 🙏… I’ve had countless times that friends and family have been scammed by these criminals/scammers it’s unreal. It’s crazy how the gov still haven’t gotten involved in taken these criminals down. This is 1000% real happing right now these scammers are modern day thieves….. thank u guys so much for everything ur doing 🙏 the whole team and everyone involved 🙏
hi, this is completely off topic but YOU LOOKED SO PRETTY AS A WOMEN?????  SIR DO YOU MAYBE HAVE A SISTER??? 😳😳
I Would like to date Vivian. Gimme her number.
Thank you! I came from Mark's channel and found yours.  Cheers for what you do.
I wish you send real bomb to this son of devil scammer
I m from India, these scammers scam both indians and foreign nationals alike. Modus operandi they use in india is they send sms messages with malicious link to many people stating their bank account will be blocked if they dont complete kyc by clicking the link. Upon clicking all your data and money will be stolen. Another way of scammers is to pose as bankers and convince you to share your card details.
You are f!!kin awesome!!!
Hey you know you don't have to dress up like a girl to talk like a girl right is that for your benefit you like wearing women's clothing I mean I understand I do I was just making sure I wasn't the only one
Thank you for all you do!!
The government needs to sponsor you all as a team to continually bust these scammers. You broke a twig in this video. Now let's go after the whole tree.
Set up a new team. One that storms the building that you have the address to the scammers.
"I love you granny" lol
I am 62 and I send your videos to all my family members. Thank you for all that you have done and continue to do. ❤
Ohhhh that’s so satisfying!
This scammers shall deserves bom*
You guys do fantastic work!  The world needs more people like you guys.  You, Mark & Jim.  Thank you.
This is the first glitterbomb video I’ve watched. You are such a kind soul what you, the team and all the others do to help prevent these horrible lazy, greedy people from swindling others is AMAZING!!
Bless you bless you bless you 💚🙏💙
Thank you! My scam and spam calls I have received since February has stopped. I kept getting debt collection scam calls. Thank you for your help! I love you all! Have a Merry Christmas! I still keep getting spam emails of someone pretending to be my father. I keep getting spam Amazon and spam Fedex emails, and I keep getting spam Public Record emails.
Thank you for your efforts!! I'm European, but one of these m**f**rs duped my sister. It wasn't a large sum of money, but she became really disheartened and distressed when she discovered what had happened to her. We are now attempting to educate others about these scammers, and we greatly appreciate your hard work and dedication to this initiative. YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING!!! PLEASE NEVER STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING!!! WE WILL BE WITH YOU EVERY STEP OF THE WAY!!! MAY GOD BLESS YOU!!
I Literally Spent Their Money When They Actually Gave Me So Much In My Account 😂. I Said To Them Thanks For The Free Money & Thanks For Helping Me Out 😂. I Went On A Spending Spree 😂
I love you sir - One free man hug for you - finally some good in the world.
I drive a taxi and question people all the time about why I'm taking them to the bank... Then I tell them about you and how easy it is to fall victim... I say "I'm not try to scare you, just make you aware"...
The Feds need to roll these scammers up in a RICO case. They are organized criminals.
Government doesn’t care about its citizens unless they are filthy rich ones
dablu dablu dablu dot
BRILLIANT!
Hello I myself am an Indian and am so disgusted that crimes like these happen and nobody complains about these scammers. I am truly asking forgiveness for our negligence towards scammers.
You and that dude look alike
I would 100% go with you to India.
You guys are the bomb....!
Thank you for your videos! I am learning a lot from them. I wish you would make your own company to hire and train people in which I would love to join so we can work to take down scammers world wide. 💪🏼  Edit: keep you the great work guys!
Thank you for all what you do.
Thank you for helping the vulnerable in our society <3
I agree those idiots think they can scam people. Me and my grandma scam those people to
I LOVE THIS !!!!!!!!!  KEEP NAILING THESE IDIOTS
"I dIDnT rAiSe YoU tHiS wAy!" 🤣🤣🤣
Thank you as well. We appreciate All that you do and hope these scammers will raise the white flag. By the way Happy Holidays to you and your family from mine. ✝️🕊😇❤️. 🎅🤶🎄
Love love love this channel!  Thank you God for sending these angels!
Beautiful.
Vivian is cuter than my wife.
I just got a Geek Squad email the other day and really hesitated for a second, thank you for all that you do in the name of all that vulnerable out there.
Thanks on behalf of CITIZENS of The US
Hey guys. I'm on Maine US. If you need help up here I'd be glad to help if things are sent to maine. I've let them send me many overnight checks in the past. But that only wastes a few dollars. Again, I'm 64 semi retired they call often and I usually tell wm whT I think but again if they're mailing to maine we could help at least by filming etc. And the police here will go after them
Thank you for your work, and for bringing awareness. These heartless scammers deserve all that you do and more. Much more! F*ck these jerks. You might say that people are naïve for believing these scammers, but we are all vulnerable to scams. Thank you.
The sad thing is these scams have been going on for a very long time its about time these scammers need to be caught
Hardly fair on the Indian government, the Ministers like to be driven around in big cars and the ordinary Indians wage won't subsidize this!  This is such a huge industry, a Huge Success story for India. Please be more considerate (and appreciate the Irony).
I m to shy to speak about that ..s
Real chrime thank you so much
But why keeoing us confused ...
Now begin making more and more sense
I love glitter but I don't steal stuff
you should send rick astley bucks to scammers
When they ask if you want to keep the service or cancel it what happens if you say you want to keep the service?
please 3  channles have been takeb and gmail   i am still logged in youtube  happed 3 days ago  please i was fire inspector 40 years on my 58th birthday crushed by dump truck i have no were to turn... please    i dont even know if i should log off then i never get on    please!!!    pic is still me bot email
You can tell an old person 1,000 times NOT TO ANSWER OR CALL BACK these scammers, but they always do. It’s maddening that older people KEEP DOING IT.
THANK YOU for actually explaining things!
Hi guys it is amazing how you guys make up these GLITTER BOMB packages & send it to the SCAMMER & when this lady SCAMMER receive it & then opened  the package it exploded Glitter all over her then the Police was able to arrest this lady SCAMMER Good on yous Kind Regards Peter PS it's about time that these SCAMMERS GOT CAUGHT A LESSON
That's not the scammer though, that's just the Mule, who unfortunately is a person who was scammed themselves and are stuck having to do these errands in order to get there money back, unfortunately though, the scammers never intent to give them money back.
The government doesn’t care to stop it!
Love what you are doing! You should really come to South Africa and sort out the scamsters here
Seriously. We need more guys and girls like you that do this, that bust scammers. I personally appreciate what you do. I got to go potty now...😆
I don't understand how this isn't mad suspicious to the people sending packages. Just seems super off from the jump
Do you need help
Yaaaaaaa lets go Scammer payback
🙏😘 ABSOLUTELY, Love your hard work in educating  all... I've learned the hard way a few weeks ago,  had to do alot of changing of my personal life..
shouldve been pigs blood
easiest way to tell its a scam is noticing their Indian accent. What? It's true. yet maybe a little controversial.. lol
I love Vivvian and Pierogi!! I love to watch you guys make the bad guys 😢🤣
Thank you so much for all you do! <3
GJ but… Why pierogi?! 😀
I just subscribed I know you because I watch mark rober I have a gaming channel I'll tell the people that scammers rob them
God Bless
You guys are heroes!
Do more glitter bombs there alsome to see
I love you ❤😂🎉
Took 10:25 to get to the glitterbomb content
Americans are easily beguiled because we are a considerate, caring and giving people.  Not too many countries like us in the world.  Others we help just take advantage of our good nature.
GOD BLESS  all you guys........keep up the great work
Haha 🤣🤣🤣🤣..the Indian mafia was standing over this idiot with a AK 47 telling him if he didn't get that money back he's a dead man..💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯. I wonder what Kevin Mitnick thinks of this???..brahahahahahahaha🤣🤣🤣🤣..Mr mitnick is probably like "get em boys"..lolol..👏👍💪🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They're lucky your not sending real bombs
Brilliant...Thank you
Nice...keep on hitting  back on these turds!
Fabulous!
LEGEND!!!
Lol those people are gullible af if they're all willing to do exactly that
Good man
These three = holy trinity
Marky Mark what!!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!¡!!!!!!
It might be a little too late, but these anti-spam Boxes have to be public standard. This is the perfect "Play stupid games, win stupid prizes" counter-action to these sc*mbags. Finish with a BOOM and some convenient cops around. In the German Army we said "Lernen durch Schmerz, Motivation durch Entsetzen." - Learn through pain, motivation through shock and awe.
That is so great you are amazing
You are welcome thank you
14:07 We are enablers
Don't stop what you are doing ✌️
I never answer these idiots period.
I recently received an email with a random renewal receipt from geek squad.. I didnt know what it was and nothing showed up on my bank so i ignored it and im shocked to hear it used as part of the scams
The person getting pulled over covered in glitter 😂
I think by now it should be updated to surprise motherfer
It’s safe to assume if someone with an Indian accent is on the phone with a. Generic white name it’s a scammer
Thanks. God bless you bro. Na will
My wife just happens to be my carer as I've been battling cancer for a long time now so she has lots of time to spare. With that being said she gets at least 8 or 9 calls a week from these scammers so in her down time it's one of her favourite hobbies to answer these calls and screw around with them. She says that the longer she can keep that scammer talking to her it takes that person's time ahd attention away from a vulnerable victim. If she can keep each scammer engaged for 10 minutes she's possibly saved around 8 or 9 victims a week 🤔. I'm so proud of my wife and her empathy towards the vulnerable, i love her so much.
The FBI needs to recruit him, so he can start a anti-scam task force.
May God bless you & your family. IF I can ever help, let me know! I know you can find me. KEEP UP THE AWESOME WORK! These crimes need to be brought to justice! PEACE:-)!
We will be forever here! Watching and learning about your informations.. so we will be scammers you sooner... Lolol j.k.. i feel scammers payback is great but its always the same tactics and strategies to waist time the scums will wise up sooner or later.. so keep lots of the tactics off YouTube videos to protect them.. if i was a career scammer id be using all the scam baiting videos as learning tools.. im Australian n definitely not a scammer but thats what id be doing..
well done!! love you guys
Hey , I'm wondering if it's even okay to waste scammers time on the phone now since we have smart phones? I usually keep them tied up for awhile because I can't work due to my disability.  I figure that I could do my part in wasting their time, but since phone's are high tech now maybe I shouldn't.
steven, R. I. (everything but) P
My question is Why FBI doesnt act ??? Sometime years back i reported a scam but  they wrote me a letter that they cannot  do anything about it and for me to just go to police station and report!! Police doesnt do anything too
You are a hero!!!
Never get anydesk !!
The scammers watching me watch this video 🫡
You look hot in that blonde wig.
That’s last part of the video was so emotional
Thank you 🙏🏼♥️♥️♥️
Replace glitter with the glass dust and maybe you'll start making a dent in the scam racket.
I thought Vivian would look older.
Vivian Helen Veronica Rogers!!! The name that gives scammers all over India the shivers.
This was amazing 🤩 do more of this
"We are sending a famous Mark Rober glitter bomb instead of money" Troll face appears
Mark Rober is a freakin dweeb.
Why block out the scammers face??
Hi Scammer Payback. I like your videos. We need to do more than this. Those scammers should be brought to justice. FBI and US government should work on securing the American people from these scammers. These scams happen all the time to many people. It happens to smart people as well. We need to let US govt and president understand that internet scams can become a national security issue.
These Indians set such a bad example for there country.
LMAO VIVIAN XD She is beautiful! *Dies of laughter*
I wish I could share my story.  My house was broke into,  I found electronics that didn't belong to me. My whole life was destroyed. The wonderful thing is my electronics are still hacked and no one believes me to this day. I also put avg on my phone and it says I have close 5000 apps. They're all fine. Who has 5000 apps on there phone. Recently I had a bank account opened in my name. I receive bank Messages from a bank via text ,that I have no account.  It's been going on for several year's now. I've just accepted it and say nothing
👍👍👍👍
The stupidity of people is at an all time high , people going to their bank to send money ,,insane
There goes my hero
OMG You look incredible with that lady custom, Is there something you don't do well? Just Beautiful.
Keep up the good work.
Vivian Rodgers is beautiful.
You are the man, bro. Take care and keep going!
I love you guys for doing what the police isn't doing. I've had so many of these scam calls that made me think they might have stolen my personal information.  Great job and keep it up
11:24 I bet the CIA, and the deep state is involved in this, just like they are with the illegal drug trade.
I have heard people who work in prevention and recovery in human trafficking say some of the very same arguments you made, so this is clearly a far reaching issue with the government.
I'll be praying for all involved
Parogie you are a 100% genuine good guy man 100% love ❤ from the UK 🇬🇧 keep the good work up . We get this in the UK but they claim to be from dwp  Department of working pensions. Or tax return.  Some times ebay as well .
God tier collab i will always miss this
The instructional video modeled with Vivian was gold. 🤣🤣 That's it. I'm subscribing.
I think you playin as an old lady will eventually deter them from scamming the elderly bc they’ll always think it’s Perogi 😂
You. Are. Amazing. All of you ❤
Great video caught red handed 🎉
Great video keep it up
Thanks!
watch dog real life  thank you Aiden Pearce
thank you for all you are doing bro! God bless you!
Troll the scammers by saying this, when they tell you they send you to much money: AAAAH cool, yall messed up, thanks for the money. And hang up
Lol i just accidentally came across that your nic 'Pierogi'  is an Indian name for 'Dumplings'  🤣 Keep up the great work having the scammers looking over their shoulder bro ✊
Don,t go to India because the police is corrupt.
I can only watch your content a little at a time, because I'm still suffering the effects of being scammed. The embarrassment is almost worse than the financial hit.  But it does bring me satisfaction when files get deleted.  It is too bad you can't take their money and give it back to victims.  You are fighting the good fight.  Even though it may seem like a never-ending supply of criminals is out there, we have your back.  We recognize the importance of what you do.  Vivian Rocks!!
7:47 He actually said 'I love you too, pidor!' In Russia, the word 'pidor' (пидор) means gay in very, very rude form.
Go Pierogi!
These guys have probably made it harder for legit Indians to gain employment in phone services. I’m always a bit suspicious whenever I hear a Hindi accent on a call lol!
Seeing her get out of her car with glitter all over her jeans as she explains what happened to the police, is gold
The government and their ABC agencies are useless! So citizens are stepping up!
This should be all over the news. A documentary.
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!
🤣😂😂😂😂😂👍🏻
Pierogi you look wired without beard.
You are really one of the real good persons Pierogi.
God bless you
I really commend you for your hard work!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ thank you bn prefirió. Very proud of you and your family. They raised you excellently!!! God blessed you all, there
you're the cyber batman
I've been saved by you. When " Eric Johnson" from Amazon called me ( think Indian accent) I knew immediately it was a scammer. I asked him how the weather was in Nigeria. Silence. I threw in a LOUD " F U scammers ! ". I couldn't resist. He hung up quickly and I haven't been targeted by that scammer cell again. Thank you. I'm not very tech savvy, being in my 70s. But, its my friends and family members who are being targeted. Vivian Rogers 4 President
darn you looki beautiful but the nailsssss what the heck hahahha... i still love you tho...number one fan here hahahha.
So there are no P.O. Boxes or other places where you can pick it up.. a Post Station Self Service. Yes even here some Boxes has been broken. Madness.
You;d think that banks would put warnings about this sort of thing in clear view of all their customers - they seem more interested in selling stuff to increase their profits than protecting their customers
I’ll never get my life back after getting everything stolen from me. I’ll trust nobody ever again
You are the best. The heroes of everyday life and living.
This almost happened to me THIS year. It was so weird though, the guy just kept asking how old I was before even talking about the refund...I kept telling him he was a creep and then he eventually gave up lol
Keep it up❤
(Thanks for sharing in such a hilarious way. 9:24 man... 😂 Its stuck in my head... I lol at work, they think I'm mad.)   It's a shame to read such horror stories in the comments my heart cries for you guys x
Vivian preparing the package, priceless ...😂😂😂😂😂
Pants he already got hit by a glitter bomb today
FUCKING HERO
This pos needed to have permanent stuff stuck to whatever it lands on.!!!!
the song " you can run away " makes alot more sense
lol
So much ❤.
It'd be cool to see a something like a fart spray fogger or smoke bomb design to try and make sure that the entire area gets hit and it stinks so bad that they have to run and wait it out then clean every where that smells
I wonder, what's the largest u've gotten from one of these scammers. So far I've seen $4k.
I've been on SS disability for a while and I guess people assume I'm older than I really am. I've had scam attempts from "PayPal" twice and another one for "Amazon" I put those in quotes because they were not the actual company. As soon as they asked me to download that software I realized it. I'm also a computer engineer and I know software that will put my PC at risk. I hung up on them and they called me back over and over again. They're relentless and they must be stopped. Thank you for all the good work you do!
Pierogi has a range. He went from Jon Lajole at @8:50 straight to Vivian effortlessly 😅
The way they say “dablew dablew dablew” 😂😂😂
You guys are doing great work! Your voice is killing me and when you told the scammer you loved him. 😂
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK,I WILL TELL EVEYONE
Your wife must be proud
Join forces with malcom merlin
The people who head these organizations should get the same treatment as that guy from Al Qeada did recently.  Crow sushi.
It is sad that there are no scammers here in Greece. Even though it is good, because people do not get scammed here (or at least they get scammed very rarely), I would LOVE to waste their time. I know that Scammer Payback is kind of working with the government, and I do not mean that he is FBI or anything but I think scambaiters have to have a special license to be able to hack scammers, because this is straight up hacking. But I would still love to mess with them on the phone, and do the stuff Pierogi does, like reading everything their website says and not stopping even if they speak over you, etc. etc. I am hoping to receive a phone call from a scammer. I might receive one, every 2 years, or something like that, but if I get one, I am gonna try to waste up to 2 hours of their time, or at least as much as I can before they give up and hang up on me. Also, can anyone tell me why I wrote such a big comment? Anyways, what I am trying to say is that I would love for scammers to exist (or at least call from somewhere else) in Greece, because I would LOVE to waste their time.
I thank you for all the information that you provided. Couple years ago my daughter (she is a young disabled adult) and myself almost got scammed. It took me a little while to realize what was happening, but my heart goes to the other people that did not. Thanks again!
That indian accent so goofy! dublue dublue dublue dot 😂😂😂
Pearl from Steven Universe:
Why does he look kinda good as Vivian tho lol
Here in the Philippines sir there are many scammers and deferential kind of scams... I hope you can help me catch and trace this scammers..
"I can't thank you enough for all that you have done helping peoples out there from being  scammed. Thank you I really appreciate all that you have done "Thank you very much!"
Hi you people doing hard work and giving yourself and the family a dangerous situations take care of that too and I think our governments they are bigger scammers they took a lot of money from us and also they let the companies took money from us too by helping them to sale somethings are value of 100 and sale it to us as 1000 or even more and they doesn’t control that because some of that money goes to they pocket too and what we should do about that because these scammers still very small in front  of our government and when we could take care of our government and control them after that they will take care of these  small scammers like Jeff bezos or the others and around 20 years he make over the 200000000000 (200 billion)Dollar just for himself it means over 11000000000 (one billon)Dollar a year I don’t think hard worker people and they family and they village they could make these much of money hole they life why because he or others had strong support of government and low salary people doesn’t had  that and so when we could do something to taking care of our government these small scammers themselves already scare to do something like that .
You are definitely my hero..I lost my husband of 26 years very unexpectedly after adopting twins an a 16 year old,them dirty scamers almost got what little bit of money I had left after funeral costs,you saved me I watch your videos so I knew to waste there time I got them for 2 days..thank you for this
You should get the money they use in movies and send them
The only thing I learned is if a Indian guy with a mic inside his mouth calls you, decline
great
I really love what you guys do, It's such a shame that the police in that area  are so corrupt as this is the only way these scum bags can keep operating
He's cute as a woman, but cuter as a guy!
Fight the fight! You’re winning.. I pray for you!. God has blessed you with unspeakable knowledge!
Thanks you are a super hero 💖
you are epic
Wished I had a way to help😩
Love your work, thank you
True American hero!! You need to make some merch! I would definitely wear your name on a shirt. God bless you!
When you guys all work together it’s like watching Avengers <3
hahha  this is great
Hiya, in the UK, we usually get a call which goes like this, with no pause for breath. "Hi, is that Mrs White my name is Claire Smith and I just want to do a quick survey just 3 or 4 questions  it won't take much time maybe 3 minutes is this OK? This is all spoken really quickly, not given you any time to answer, even if you try and interrupt them.  When they ask  if that's OK, I ask if that is the first question.  They then say "no, we are doing a quick survey and want to as you some quick questions is that OK? So I repeat "So THAT is the first question?". They then ask "Can you please listen to me, the survey is very quick and only 3 questions is that OK?" So I say "Those must be the 3 questions, thanks for calling, bye" and put the phone down. Someone told me that these "survey scams" are to either get personal details or get you to say "Yes", so then they can edit a call saying any of the usual scams, but put your recorded voice saying yes to the new questions. Any idea if either of these are right, or is it something else? Not had any calls in the UK since the AntiScam centre opened!!
You are a Saint and so are the people who work with you +.
Crying Steven is a bollywood worthy performance
Stephen Williams? Actor I believe
How did you get camera footage of that package when it went off
To quote Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) in TRON: LEGACY  "One day...I got in......."
The greatest team up of all time!!!!
Thank you. Ive fallen victim to guys like this a couple times. I am a mentally disabled vet with little to no support structure so sometimes its really easy to be desperate and gullible. Thank you and to anyone like you who fight these scumbags who prey on people who have a hard time telling friend from foe
Thanks for all the work you do to help bring justice!
Yo you so mean ,you made ASUM cry ,,,Bwahahahahaha.
I wanna punch crying Steven so bad even if he's literally crying, he's so annoying. hahahahahahah!
What a bunch of jokers!!! The guy crying. 😂🤣😅
👍👍👍my hero ❤ I love to see scammers get their come up pence as these are the lowest life form.   I have scammers that have been trying forever to get me & according to them I've won everything  from the Irish sweepstakes to the national lottery these lowlifew jackals must think I have millions In the bank they went so far as to put a digital recorder on my phone line & Tmobile disable it  than you Tmobile for your help.  I sometimes get 5 or 6 scams on any given day maybe it's because I used to tell them exactly what I think of them & there must be a. Contest among A lot of scammers trying to see who can get those all important numbers oh well Any offers of money are always checked right after I hang up to make sure it's legitimate the last clown  tried to sell me that I was 2nd place winner of Publishers Clearing house didn't work as like I said I check
IF you do go over there pls don't take Art or Ashton....They're way to goofy.
You should be on SNL 🤣
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏♥️♥️♥️
FANTASTIC! Got a message from you on FB saying to inbox you but never found your email. My GF mom was taken last year for $35K. Her broker caught that she was moving $100K more and shut her down and called my GF. At 76 she is still out the initial money these gutless creeps stole. Why our government even allows connections from that country is a mystery.
if they pull the edit scam thing where the make it look like you have more money than you do, I would just go "welp moneys mine now bye!" and hang up
Jesus 😂lol acting
is any desk bad or is it just used badly by these scammers
We need more these justice videos … cops , glitter bombs and more . Great video very satisfying
Thank you and thank you for what you do.
Fun fact: Pierogi is traditional polish dish.
Scammer: You have been auto-renewed into a $300 subscription.. or do you wish to cancel? Me: Nah, I'l stick with the subscription. Thank you. Scammer:... ermmm.. ermmm.... ?? what do I say now?
Steven's such a cry baby. Be a man.
its the famous peirogi he matey it doh say its from a india had several calls my self soon as i hear the sell i shout he scammer they hang up
You've only gotten better since 3/24/21! 👍🤗
Instead of glitter bombs, they should be incendiary bombs.
debloo debloo debloo
In Most case the Scammers are giving back handers to the Indian police hence very little is done to bring these Indian crooks to justice! I watched many of these videos where these crooks pictures are taken, exact location is known yet it is very rare they are arrested! Why is the FBI not involved??
Honestly, wish there were more people in this world like Pierogi. Man's got my respect.
So we make virtual machine set up for him and give him an connection to the VM ? In case i want to play with them tooo , should i do that on a brand formated computer too ? In case the virtual machine isint safe enougt  Haha i enjoy so much those video but i do get those calls 😂
You guys are true super heros
Way to be Vivan!  thank you for all you help to stop the swamp rats!
awesome
I'd enjoy making him cry I effing hate these people
I would put some dried dog doo in it
I would keep it
Justice served, great work!!!
Where in texas , I could probably deliver that glitter in person lol 😆 I’m serious 🧐
The part with post malone had me crying xD
Im really glad theres people like these out here helping people
You rock bro!
Rezo?
Thank you so much for all that you and the others do to stop these jerks. I’ve learned a lot watching Pleasant Green’s videos. I’ve gotten scammed with an order I placed for an item that was advertised on Facebook. It ended coming from Hong Kong. It wasn’t even the item I ordered. They said I ordered the wrong item by mistake. There was no other item to order. Thank god I paid through PayPal and they looked into it and said it was a scam and I got my money back. Oh great choice of putting the fart spray in the packages. I know that spray is nasty 🤢
God bless you, Sir!
I think everyone is guilty of scamming. But when you flat out steal from people. Your just as bad as a rapist or a woman having an abortion. 99.9% of you are thieves. Just how you steal is where the lines get blurry. Maybe just try to be kind, help other before helping yourself. We are all 100% guilty of being terrible human beings to one another. DO BETTER.
Don't go to India to pursue these charlatans. If the police will not close them down, just how much help do you think you would get from them if your life is threatened? Or worse.
She is just a money mule, she is at the bottom of the chain. You need to send the glitter bomb to India
I've subbed today love your vids 🎈
I wanna thank each and everyone on your team for doing such a great work. These scammers really upped their game and so did you guys. Bravo.
Why block out the scammers face? She is a thief we to know who she is.
I lost it when granny started singing Post Malone 🤣🤣🤣
There are some scammers in Africa to
Hey Pirogi there is ANOTHER scam going on i would like to tell you about. It is a personal loan scam I fell for and ended up getting my Bank account overdrawn and closed out due to scammers. If you would like to know more about this Personal loan scam going on, please reach out to me.
This is Gold!!! 🤣🤣🤣 still up to this day.
funny!!!
Fair play to you my friend keep up the good work Dave across the pond
I love watching you keep going people need yourskills
Another one of your best! Thanks Mark!
Everytime I hear Indian accent on my phone, I hang up right away.. You may say, not all indians, of course, but it is better save dont sorry.. Bye scammers.
Hilarious heroic work thank you 🖖
Bravo man
@scammerpayback I want to meet vivian ,she seems like the best grandma in the world
You are awesome. Go for 2024 plz.
My favorite part of these videos is when the scammer starts to panic and curse.  It's the same when I see soverign citizens get tazed, they're so awful and then they are down on the ground squealing.
Is this guys name really pierogi?
You guys need to add marking dye  that  them that they cant get off.
why would you block out the face? shouldn't we see what this scammer looks like or are we giving them privacy
That man's pants got an upgrade his pants where sparkling 😂
you have gone to India.......................... and beyond, you jim and others are doing excellent work  thank you
Thank you so much for all you're doing truly incredible work and your hair looks really cool
I LOVE GLITTER BOMBS!! 🙂
You are wonderful! Keep up the great work. Praying for your safety. God bless you
Awesome work folks
Thank.you.all. just thank you!
I hate to say this, but Vivian you need a shave.
Almost thought you were going to sing Cliff Richard's "Congratulations", for a moment😂
Love it when payback happens.  I get 30 scam calls a day from the entire gamut of scams from Indian call centers. Keep up the good work!
Defund law enforcement and let vigilantes handle it.
The police have their hands tide by the politicians and lawyers who keep finding loopholes to get these people off.
I didn't see him arrested...
Isn't it a felony to ship cash from state to state for large amounts?
In the 6.0 generation you guys should have "Saw" movie face pop out from the box. You guys are awesome, keep up the great work!
This is the first time i accualy saw you make a joke about vivian
You are the first person that actually explains in detail so that we can understand. Thank you 🙏🏻
11:22 how hard can it be to block all phone calls from india for starters? When people really want to speak with people over there they can reach eachother by cellphone.. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Ofcourse they will find other ways. But lets start there.. But then, this channel would exist anymore.. So yeah, you can scream it isnt fair or why doesn’t someone have a solution but what then? You have to live of the millions you grossed already.. 😶 That can’t be fun or a goal..
I’m just wondering if you can get individual scammers if I gave you email would you be able to get into their computers and look for my name and information? He used coinbase, Robinhood, PayPal, Update. I know I had money in crypto and he took it all. I have pictures of individuals too.
👍👍👍👍👍💝
Noooo... Vivian has hair .. a bit like my wife ! ... now I've seen Vivian ....I can't sleep ...!  What have you done ! ..🤬🤬 . Don't you want to cuddle tonight ?? "Ermm , no .. I'm kinda tired, today was really ugly , I mean busy, and I might vomit , or I don't feel well """ .. 🙄🙄
I ALMOST got scammed & then realized it didn't make sense & just hung up!  They  called back & I told them I had called the police & FBI.  Never heard from anyone again.
Dude iis a hero in my book. Well done, Sir. You make our world a little bit better.
Thanks!
Best crossover episode, ever!
train others to do this
Facebook marketplace is a shithole of scammers listing fake vehicles ads
Why blur the mule's face???
But aren’t the recipients (miles) innocent victims themselves?
So for all of your videos I have seen Indian scammers.. put something I'm curious about have you ever run into any scammers that were American or British or something like that?
LOVE U BRO
man ya'll need to teach classes on how to do what ya'll do and get more people involved viva revolution! lol
Thank you.
Bedankt Thank you !!! 🙏❤️
Thank you for all y’all do to put a dent in this crime! And thanks for explaining how these scams work.
Keep up the great work, the people you're protecting are usually the elderly, who can least afford to lose their money.
No sir we thank you for what you do.
I love ❤ this 😄😄
Should also put itching powder in the bait package
Dear Viewers & Payback:  Is there a way to make a one-time contribution?  I am old, and don't like to set up monthly donations -- as it will be a nightmare for the unlucky person dealing with my estate after I croak.
God Bless Everyone
Terrible crying acting!
9:27 EYE BLEACH ALERT!!!!
7:04 They accuse YOU of typing too many zeros yet they type things like "FILLIING" and "PRESEED" constantly. It's also funny how Bank of America doesn't capitalize their own name.
It was funny but against the law to send pranks like that in the mail. He could have been injured and  sued you
I live in Pearland lolol
He's the definition of "I am the one who knocks"
Dude if u go to India with Mark. Have Mark make a very special glitter bomb and then if u can please just please put the memz Trojan virus malwere on there server/computers (if only 1 that's fine) or make your own malwere make it especially for scammers.😈
I do tech support
I can't stand their accent. When I hear that accent I automatically assume it's a scammer.
Ok it’s official, you are a real life super hero now! You already have the blue hair and the name. Now you just need the outfit! Thank you for what you do! Thank you for the education that you provide along with awareness that we should look out for the elders in our family as well as ourselves!
You guys are awesome
You 3 & Team are NOT JUST 3 guys!!!You are heroes, you all are the definition of good humans with more compassion, determination and goodness in your little fingers than 1000 dirtbag scum buckets have all together... ATLEAST! I can only donate $5 but believe me as a Senior on Disability its a lot more... I hope each and every person who subscribes will donate as much as their income can manage to not only do what they do but also, encourage others to join you guys in your fight for Justice for those of us who simply can't. LOVE you guys 🫂🫂🫂...
Thanks!
Pearland hmmm used to live there. This doesn't surprise me tons of trash moved there so we moved to a different city.
Love and Big RESPECT for you from INDIA
Good work man
Listen up, you have to play the part of the fool until the end of the session. Stop breaking your own protocol. Success will be yours more often , if you Heed this advice.
I'm not doing too well financially but if I  ever get  a chance to help support your channel I will because I  love what you do.
Love what you do …. Keep going … you make a difference…..❤️
If you ever need help hit me up I'm a old lady that worked on the phone for many years and I have nothing but time 😂
Brooooo u deserve 100.000.000 subscribers🔥❤️❤️❤️🔥
Awesome !!! 😘
im just wondering what would happen if you purposely add extra zeros or nines to the transfer amount
I've been watching your videos for quite a while and I would like to give my thanks for the fine work that you and the rest of this amazing community put forth. I know that this is a personal endeavor for you and the compassion with which you approach victims is always heartwarming. Rather than offer just my thanks, I would like to offer my time as well. While I have never done any scam baiting myself, I am fairly technically savvy and more importantly educable. If you ever could use an extra pair of hands, please do not hesitate to ask. In the meantime, keep fighting the good fight sir!
Do you help ppl In the UK
I shared your channel with everyone I know who is gullible
you make a beautiful woman 💀
The crying steven part makes me laugh so freaking hard you cant imagine.
Once my mom got scammed it was like 100 dollars. The scammer said it was her bank helpline. Me knowing it was a scam she didn't believe me and then lost here money and then she started begging me not to tell my father. She cried a lot that day. When she does something bad to me I tell her: I will tell father.
this is so terrible in Sweden, they also try via face book messaging on sales pages where they want to buy something and then you get a notification that they are sending an offer with money and that you should go in via a link they send to ups or fedex. then they try to sell visas to different countries, also green cards to us
I bet its just a nuke in a box
Most of the ppl scammed is my parent's generation. I am sorry to say that half of my kids could also be scammed right now.
How can such an incredibly handsome man make for such an unfortunate looking lady?! I'm going to have nightmares 9:29 😆
Have you ever collaborated with Trilogy Media?
This was fantastic i tell so many people on quora who have been scammed to follow your channel your amazing!
keep up the good work !!!!!!
The mule with the glitter all over her is worth the price of admission!
Surprise!! 🚨🚨✨✨🤣🤣😂😂
Omg Pierogi in drag..... NIGHTMARE FUEL!!! But on a real note you are great man. I'm so glad you and other people are doing all this. I have family who have been scammed and I truly believe these people need to go down for stealing from the elderly, handicapped, and innocent victims around the world
Keep at it 🙏👍
respect to you
Perogi makes a pretty Vivian lol
My disabled sister has been getting scammed for years but refuses to believe it…took her for all her money
Thankful for you. Praying for you too
You guys are amazing!!
The singing and the u love you took me out!!!😂😂 😂😂
I guess u already own the medal of honor, right??
You in drag was worth subscribing
This has to be one of my favorite videos you've done. Thanks for all that you do. I hope they are brought to justice. As a teacher, I work so hard everyday to prepare students for the real world, and every day, the real world does all it can to make life even harder. Technology is changing so fast, and it's hard to keep up with. For the generations before us, it is almost impossible. Thank you for protecting them!
Ahaha
Vivian is a very good looking old lady😁😂
Geez it’s crazy seeing how much the need for money or a currency corrupts people
Why is it always an Indian or Nigerian scammer.? Their accent is already a red flag lolz
I wonder why they are all from India
You are just amazing and I do actually love you for all your doing to stop these scammers once and for all (hopefully)
It just blows my mind that people fall for this, getting in their account is one thing but all the running and buying gift cards or packing cash like this is unbelievable
Love what you do. BTW, Vivian needs some help with that menopause mustache... :)
take me with you. I'll go to india. i'm a linguist, i can pass off as one of them easily enough having darker skin. and I am definitely passionate enough given what you've shown. these people take the hard earned cash of retirees.... they deserve to be brought to justice.
The scammer: this mens wa r Martha  The other scammer: it was Perogi The scammer: this mens wa r Perogi
While your videos are awesome dude I love you I like what you do you would have to be a complete absolute downright moron to even fall for this I don't understand where they find people that are this stupid if you put $57,000 in my checking account I'm hanging up the phone I ain't giving nothing back to you good luck.....lol
Scammers can’t even spell address correctly
I wish you could catch them all! This makes me physically sick...knowing how hard some of us work in this society!!! Then, you have others sitting around being lazy, scamming and manipulating others.
Pierogi. We need SCAM AWARENESS MONTH.
How did you able to take money from their account when they are trying to get yours
i wonder if pierogi has ever encountered a scammer without an indian accent
My son and I watch all of your videos my son is 14 and you are absolutely his hero and he wants to be , Thank you for being such a positive influence on my child I am forever in debt To you God bless you
You are a Legend,!!
ive had them call me many of times, its like xmas x1000  I GET EXCITED just to fok with them hard, it always makes me laugh so hard, they get so pissed off at me because they cant get anywhere with me, im always playing dumb, then they get pissed and tell me to suk their d_ _ _ and hang up on me,, total fun
is your name really pierogi? that's dumplings in polish
I LOVE Mark Rober!! He makes all kinds of neat things. I saw that video with the glitter bomb which is the most amazing thing I have ever seen. That is a true work of genius. And you would almost be convincing as a woman if you didn't have a beard!! 🤣
"Son, please don't cry. Go get a napkin, this is unbecoming of you. I didn't raise you this way." lmao
This guy is an actual Super Hero.
This video is so freaking satisfying!  I enjoy the regular ones too, but this - this one is special. 🎊
I am so sick of these scammers trying to scam money out of me... I am 62yrs old and I keep  getting phone calls from a person claiming to be an online trader that just won't give up and leave me alone,.. he tells me i HAVE to have a second income and that i have to pay money into online trading so i can make money... i know they would just keep asking if i gave them anything... so i refused and now he won't leave me alone.. he keeps trying to make me change my mind.. even calls me a liar.. i have hung up on him and even blocked his numbers, but he still keeps calling on new numbers.... and then facebook scams who say i won money and want me to pay a fee to have my winnings processed... through watching your videos i have learned a lot after i got scammed a couple of years ago
YOUR MY FAMILIES HERO PLEASE KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK I WILL GO TO INDIA WITH YOU ANYTIME!
THEY GOT MY DAD FOR EMBARRASING AMOUNT.
Bravo fellas!!
Jesus loves you
Personally, I'd be putting food dye in those bombs instead of glitter. I'd also create the most hideous colour just to make them really stand out.
9:30 - 10:16😆 😅 😂 🤣Poor Vivian got ripped off twice. Once by the scammer & once by the nail technician.
Such badasses!!!! Love that it was a glitter stinkbomb.
Ayo Vivian kinda cute
Your the best bro Godbless your life
your amazing love what ur doing. my mom went threw this  getting screwed she's still paying back on that money.. ur awesome I watch ur videos everyday as im a new subscriber. lol   your soo handsome also.
Do you guys think that in maybe the next 50-60 years scam call centres will be almost obsolete? I understand they prey on vulnerable people including older people with memory problems which is probably the most likely to get scammed in the future. But since the younger generations are quite well versed on scam calls, do you think it will mostly be not worth it since you will be getting a lot lower success rate.
Don’t take the Lords name in vain :)
Vivian isnt that bad looking..... All kidding aside, keep up the great work guys! Scammers need to know that karma can be a mother. Ya baby
nice explanation , hahah a, this is the best video ever.
Send them a zip bomb next
I still don't understand how someone would be willing to go to their bank withdraw 25k and just send it to someone cus they said Hey we gave u an extra w.e. on accident
GREAT WORK!!!
Vivian is so cute 🥰
Whenever I have a bad day, you guys pick me up.  Seeing this puts a smile on my face
My man achieved his finnale form
You need to call the postal police. Postal police can arrest anywhere and anyone where the mail goes. #postalPolice
To female scammers get as hemotional as that
I would like to learn how to create a glitter bomb. I would add some permanent dye to Mark the scammers. I've had money stolen off my cards before and I'm still angry about it. There's never nothing you can do once it happens.
Vivian’s hair looks great
What do they do when you say you don't want to cancel the service and keep it?  haha
I think I have met an angel on Earth. Thanks for taking care of our elders' money. They deserve better and you have saved a lot of sweet people just wanting to be honest and caring. Blessings sweety. May God continue guiding your path in this mission.
Pierogi you are the man! We need 10000 more like you. They have tried to scam me more than once but the accent gives them away. :-) And I always checked my bank account and NOBODY gets access to my computer. If you are in SRQ next time I am down that way I'd like to buy you a beer or two ! Keep up the great work bud!
I even receiving the scam emails in Poland when I have and I have not an account in a specified services from which the email could be send...
Bro u scammed a scammer
just let them do their scams and leave them alone
Wow! So satisfying
I wonder how bad he got scammed in the past to do this now 😂
Only shit people that cause atrocities are remembered in time I hope in the future the good people will be remembered
You sir Are a legend
Why can't I give a 100 thumbs up
that is so amazing i am so thankful for him
Thank you so much for your service be safe please
Let's just bomb these call centers
Thank you 😊
Let's go for this assholes
Good ol Pearland Texas
Love you from India.....they must must must be put in Jail....They are ruining my countries reputation..put them all in jail
A glitter bomb is "justice"? lol k
Well done mate, i like to see scammers getting their payback.
So the scammer was a white lady?
Please keep doing that man..
This guy needs a movie!
polish pierogi >?
Indians have done it to themselves.  Now when you hear a Indian accent you hang up cause it must be a scam
Thank you mate. You ARE TRUE LEGENDS. You shouldn’t be thanking us , it’s us that thank YOU guys. Superb work 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Seeing Rober, Pierogie, and other scam busters team up is the awesomeness equivalent of the Avengers
Wow. Vivian Rogers is pretty hot.
Send real bomb next time. Stop playing with glitter bombs.
That's great n all but put diarrhea in it next time
Enjoying with you,. A new work, that is satisfaction.& gratitude.Unlike some of the work pits & drudgery that people dedicated their lives to earn a living, raise their families ,and save a button retire . Just to lose much of it to parasite scammers , without conscience. Salute'&  Shalom
WHITE knights: Pierogi, Jim Browning, Kitboga BLACK/BROWN hats: scammers, money mules.
Holy shat that's in Pearland, TX, that's where I'm at!!!
Why people are sending cash? I'm not a native speaker, didn't get it
Why censor their identity while they steal everyone elses?
The Glitterbomb pimped up her jeans for sure ! :D
there is  Facebook  scam   on  let  peapol to borrow money   for small ammount   like  tax for  documentation
Dude I live in Pearland thats wild thank you for your service to the people your the true people's champ
Dude you are truly Epic..
You guys ROCK!!!
You guys did so good!
Hahahah karma⬜️🎤🥋
You guys are awesome! Don't ever stop Pierogi! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
hahaha they all have American names. you look too pretty as Vivian...
Thanks so much. !!! We all appreciate your help.
These people act like emotionally stunted 11 year olds.
FUCKING GREAT!!!!!!! LOVE YOU !!!
You guys are absolutely brilliant. Thank you 💋♥️
Pierogina went hard on this one.
i sure wish you could show faces!!   SHAME THEM ALL!!   Thank you Scammer Payback!!
Can I please have the phone number of Vivian ? Or else I start to cry .🥰 Great work and thank you . Regards Kenneth John  The Netherlands
I am actually shocked at how gullible some folk are.  Surely one would be suspicious when putting separate bundles of money into different envelopes while at a local western union and posting it to a stranger!.  At what point does this person wake up!
Been watching so many videos and I just cannot believe that the American banking system is so outdated and stuck in a decade of early internet. Here in the Netherlands online banking has been either two-step authentication or external device protected since introduction. My bank uses an external authentication device, other banks require(d) special codes and recently they all also added or changed to SMS codes, mobile apps requiring pin codes and/or fingerprint verification.   Yet, America... you can log in to your bank account with a 6 character password.
if only, old folks use linux, those scams pretty much utter useless
Vivian has some bad 5 o'clock shadow 🧔
Love this channel just found it not long ago but what blue hair dye do you use it always looks so nice
Step it up with a pepper spray bomb!
One time my mom got an e-mail saying an account she owned was hacked. She got on a call with a person with some type of Indian accent asking her to connect her bank account. I literally PRAYED she wouldn't get scammed. Thankfully she didn't. Thanks for keeping us in the know about scammers.
You all are heroes!
This is Ridiculous these scammers are Scumbags and I feel terrible for these people that actually send them money. They don't think it sounds weird that they have to go to the bank, keep them the phone then Mail them money smh...
EVERY TIME I see your videos it reminds me of when I almost got taken.  It was something I clicked on while "surfing " the web. To clear it they wanted me to stay on the phone (not a smartphone), while I drove to a nearby Walmart to get a "gift card". I didn't...but led them to believe I was. For a Very Low tech guy, I had them for about an hour. They eventually started to get pissed...calling me all sorts of things.  I had a great time
Pierogi YOU ARE PHENOMENAL!! Keep up the excellent work and thank you for the smile that you bring to my face every time you make those scumbag scammers squirm.
High velocity lead would be much more satisfying than a glitter bomb.   Just saying....
Please send them a real bomb next time 🙂
You have saved so many people and all the ones you collaborate with. Thank you
Have u ever got scammed guys
Love your videos and what you guy’s are doing to expose these people and put a stop to it please keep up the amazing work you are doing and wish there was more people like you out there doing what you have the ability to do you guy’s are awesome
What's the point of blurring out her face? A piece of s*** like that should have her face spread around
This made me emotional 😊🥺👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Glad you’re using your powers for good 🥸
You are awesome!! Xoxo thank you
Thank you for all y'all do 🙏
lol classic payback!  How do you video record them from the parcel though?
8:58 the crocodile tears are REAL there hahaha that goof is probably laughing and smiling on the other end
13:41 - You show a police car. Did the police catch someone? What happened then? Why does the video end abruptly?
6:45 - If they're visibly editing the HTML (as we can see onscreen here), why would anyone fall for this?
Thanks for putting a stop to these scammers they deserve what they get. Keep up the good fight and work.
👍🏼❤️🙏🏻
Use semtex
From what I have understood... You actually have american citizens sending us information to these Indian IPOs, making them follow scripts so that they can scam their own citizens.
Seriously, not only do they scam in the first place, they do it in a way that pry on people that are good and want to help the needy, then on top they will hit the same person over and over until they lose it all... scum of the earth...
Thank you for doing this..
im happy that i dont like talking on the phone lol.
This is epic.  Mark and Pierogi together ❤️.
That glitter bomb sucked - u should have put at least that colour bomb they put in stolen cash from a bank. But glitter bomb seems not to do anything
Fantastic!  Keep up the good work!!
I receive sms about some refunds or some activities on my bank account or what not - just block the number and delete message. Recent one was that i got some tax refund and to receive that money i should click on the link. How dumb a person should be to start clicking on some links by sms or emails. What bothers me is that my last sms was destroyed with my iphone in washing machine so i bought a new iphone and new UNREGISTERED prepaid sms card. The only item which knows my new phone number is MY BANK because they send u sms with a code if u use bank account online and NO ONE ELSE. hmmmmm.🤔makes u think how did crooks got access to my phone number. I never received any scam calls or sms with my old unregistered prepaid sms
3:31 doublūdoublūdoublū
I think he is prettier than I am as a woman! Lol
whoa that lady is hot
your channel is really cool.
You gotta make it look like the scammer is stealing from HIS COMPANY too, and hopefully they get HOSPITALIZED and FIRED if they survive..
I’ve had scammers hit up my art business saying they want to buy work sending me a check for £5000 when it was less and they were telling me to cash it and send them the money. I was extra gutted as this went down around my grandad dying and he thought I had sold an expensive piece of work, he was so proud 😢
Finally I found a video with the police involved. I was very satisfied when I saw the police arrest her. Btw while watching this video me and my wife we were laughing so hard when we see "Vivian Rogers" face 🤣🤣🤣
Boom 🎉
how dumb are these scammers,they can't even make a phishing software intead use a bat file
You’re a hero! 👏🏻
My family has been scammed extensively.  It’s caused so much pain and financial devastation.  Thank you for all you do.  If only I could convince my mother that romance scammers are NOT in love with her.
They have the thickest accent with the most American name lol
Projekt Veritas collab and they go down for good  😅👍
synthetic farts glue and glitter...  basically a modern and fashionable take on tar and feathers 😂👍 so well done!
Glitterbomb at 12:49 🙂
Great job
You guys are heros !!! Medal of Honor Heros !
yes!!!!!!!!
Crying Steven sounds so pathetic lol
It was sooooo satisfying to see the police show up to get that person! You guys did it! That is awesome!!! Thank you so much! 💖
G. Bomb these thugs.
Thank you sir
Yo ngl vivian kinda bad
make an ebolabomb and it cant infect other people:)
Thank you!  I have shared!
Crying scammers only makes me more mad. I have been a naïve victim and cried. They give zero cares. They don’t know me and why my tears could compare to theirs. We are all human. We should not treat others this way.
"Son, don't cry! I didn't raise you that way!😡"   Definitely the best part lol
😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣 😂
Shout out to Vivian!!!!!!!
Love This Gay YouTuber.
Scammer:  "Thank you for calling the cancelation dept...are you calling to cancel?"  Periogi:  yes, I'm calling to cancel you!
You are an absolute rock star! You're bringing justice to an area where so many are victimized, and you have a really good way of explaining it along the way. A rare set of skills, my friend. My only constructive observation is that you seem to enjoy putting on women's clothes juuuust a bit too much. So, like, you could be a bi-curious Robin Hood. Which is fine, that's totally fine.
Steven: "i want to be still on the phone" *cries*  Fbi: "DONT MOVE"
I know a scammer. I could lead him to you.
Wow, right in my backyard here in Houston haha
Geez. do not go to India.  They will kill you.  Your vids are always FB worthy!
The fact that there’s adults in our country that are this stupid and VOTE is terrifying!
why cover  the face? show it to the world!
Mark you need to add permanent die insted of fart spray. Thanks ciao franco
if anyine has seen lucifer on netflix well this guy is like him. lucifer helps the detective with murders well this guy is helping police with scammers
These guys are redicilous, I'm laughing too hard because of crying Steven, this guy's a legend 😂😂
omg wish u could work for kitboga u both guys would make cry some scammers, GOOD JOB AND THANKS
Great work , keep busting these scum of the earth low life’s.
Do you see many in Australia?
9:35😂😂😂😂😂 This guy is SOMETHING ELSE
Why you never asked them money for delivery charges instead? And sent them fake currency, they will be caught by the currency exchange department..
Pierogi enjoyed dressing up as Vivian a bit too much 🤣🤣🤣
such a happy relief to hear those scammers cry, both real and fake.
Ah yes! Mark's Glitter Bombs! His channel was actually the first channel like this that takes down scammers that I followed.
For everyone here, the simplest way to avoid these scams is to always discuss banking in person at your bank. If a financial emergency or situation can apparently not be dealt with with your trusted accountant or bank in person then it’s BS and you shouldn’t pay it any mind. More people need to know this.
So glad I subbed to this channel. Thank good there are people like your team out there.
What a total all star crew!!! Just awesome!! I am curious how did cop pull lady over. Was it just a coincidence or throw glitter bomb?
I do not understand the end....why was it a woman who received the package?
So do they really transfer money to u or is that just completely faked also?
Ggg
@9:23      I came for Vivian!!!
Thank you again pierogi used your name and this scammer asked if I could please just turn your voice off so he could talk to me, I said no, I want to get connected to Pierogi because he's gonna have fun on your laptop, and he's going to delete all of your accounts, files and then he hung up! So maybe I will get fewer and fewer calls. Thanks to you! Thank you Pierogi
Great fan of ur work❤️❤️do the good work...❤️from india
YOU SIR ARE WHAT I LIKE TO CALL A REAL HERO!!! THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK FIGHTING FOR US!!!
I've watched all 3 different views of this video, Y'all fantastic , Thanks!!  Oh yeah, That's a perfect lip color for Vivian!
Karma will get these guys one day. They got me through PayPal via Zelle. $5000.00  . Wish I would have seen this prior to being scammed. Glad you are making all of this public.
Love the paybacks!
Brother I had a scammer call me wanting me to get a $300 vanilla gift card. He said he was from publisher's clearing house said I needed to give them the $300 so they can give me a $1million big check. I messed with them hard looked up their address really messed with them hard for 2hrs it was awesome. Thanks for the videos BROTHER.
Who was the smoking babe at 10 22 . Is she single?
You are an adorable Vivian!
It's appalling how many scammers are from India...
btw, if someone me that they sent 40k instead of 400 i'd be "wow, great, thanks" and hang up.  why are these people so worried about getting this money back to them, especially in such a hurry.  are they just decent like that, or what?
adam sandler (target edition)
Sir can we buy things on amazon on internet banking like atm, etc. Pay first and material later.
Thanks!
Im so glade we have u mark and jim looking after the ppl who need u the most im so proud of u all keep up the good work boys 😉
For a chick, you're pretty handsome.  lol!!!!!
LOL that womans pants were glittering like a star field! 😆😆😆
Get them!
Switch to government standard bathroom malodor instead of the fart spray
You are awesome ❤️❤️❤️
That was Great!  Seeing the cops roll up and take her in to custody was Gravy.  Loved it!
Once again I am late to the party (it's July 18th today.) Anyway, Zelle is actually a company or program from a company in ISRAEL, and the Zelle app is really called First Look. Israelis (NOT Jews) Israelis are not your friend. When your pastor starts singing their praises you raise your hand and remind him/her who Your Savior is, and what is his/her problem? An Israeli firm wrote and installed the Stuxnet virus into Iran's centrifuges that is part of the uranium purification stream. Israelis flew into other country's sovereign air space and bombed peaceful nuke plants that were megawatts to homes and businesses - not bombs or ingredients to make bombs. The CIA intel people told President (43) Bush that even if they did make a nuclear warhead, which they estimated was at a minimum of ten years out, that they (Iran) had no way to deliver said warhead. Before that Israeli jets flew into Syria's sovereign airspace and bombed their nuclear power generating station, blowing it up. Before that they flew into Iraq's sovereign airspace and blew up the Osiris nuke plant. Now, NSO (their NSA) has sold ruthless DICKtators an insidious program called Pegasus - look into it everyone. Israel runs Pegasus inside US sovereign borders. Israel has never claimed to be our ally, even though we hand them tens of millions of "REPARATIONS every single year. Israel runs more spy operations inside the US than all other countries COMBINED. Not only electronic spyware, but actual spies, thousands of 'Agents of Influence', etc. Who was Jeffrey Epstein spying for, for blackmail purposes?  Before him the same shady characters ruined Elliot Spitzer, before him Bill Clinton, with the Lewinski scandal. It goes all the way back to Teddy Roosevelt's cousin helping BP overthrow the democratically-elected PM Mossadegh & installing the Shah of Iran, just like Pol Pot and the evil DICKtator of the Philippines, a country who was our ally. Look into Stuxnet & Pegasus please. RIP Mr Khashoggi.
Using ur engineering skills to bring justice to fuckers, big or small, can be more significant than Elon’s influence to humanity because after all not everyone can buy a Tesla yet.
Why would you blur her face??
Use more glitter bombs. Cannot have too much glitter! 😎
P.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Thank you!!!!
I love your work! Just came across your channel randomly yesterday. Needless to say I’ve watched at least 5+ hours in total so far 😅
I never answer any number  I don't know or open /follow a link .
When she got out of the car with glitter stuck all over her pants...priceless!
I didn't know these kinds of scams were happening. I'm Indian too, but damm this is really bad. Fake fucking call centre. We are not even aware of this. Thanks man! I really appreciate the work you are doing. Great work!  I hope these scammers are punished properly.
How do I get these people to scam me by putting money in my account?
Great video brother
Not a big fan of mark rober his acts are childish they aren't even done thoughtfully
Every scammer now when they here innocent old lady voice . 👀
No , thank you . Your awesome
Excellent work you guys. Total respect to you all. But I dont think these shits will give up unless they feel pain or long terms in jail. And I know the Indian judicial and police service is run by baksheesh! So you need a group of trusted locals in masks to raid them one by one.
Vivian Rogers man you  genius and the comedian make me laugh every time.... God bless you for your job amen
The fart spray!! 🤣👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾 💩💩💩💩 Its doo doo baaayyybbbyyy!!
Here’s how you talk to an elderly person: make analogies.  _Their goal is to share your desktop and be on your computer, so they can see how much is in your bank account._  _When you phone Amazon to cancel an order, do they ever say “We need to see your bank balance before giving a refund?”_  _When you look at your own balance by yourself, don’t you also look at the latest transactions?_  _When these scum say you made a mistake entering the dollar amount, simply call your bank or refresh your browser to see your bank balance and all the recent transactions._
Wonder how they would react to a bank account with like $500
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾 love it!!!
Why dont use a real bomb?
Bro I really like what you're doing for the people out there but I just want to ask you a question why haven't you done anything with Canada at all??
You are an avenging angel. 💙💙💙💙  I just can't imagine people getting scammed this way!
I love your work, keep it up :)
The glitter bomb/ spray should go off right away or at count 3 but continue to count down to confuse them
8:00 that part 🤣👌
why hide their face?
What’s really sad is when the “money mule” is a little old person who has no idea that they’re laundering money. There is an episode on Trilogy Media and the money mule was an old man who was on a lot of medication and was not healthy mentally. He was someone who was easily manipulated and confused. Bothered me so bad.
❤👆
My mother and I were scammed out of tens of thousands of dollars, I was so ashamed because of how it hurt my mother that I almost took my life. Thank you for what you’re doing. Scamming is evil.
Awsome  !!  👍✌🇺🇸🇦🇺
I love watching this it gives me such a big smile seeing the scammers getting taken down
What are the FBI doing? Who's department is it to deal with this? Too little for the FBI? Too big for the Police? Looks like they need a new division 😉
Don't stop keeping on. Your effort is so important in educating everyone - potential victims, law enforcement, law makers and the general population - about these horrible scams. Thank you so so much.
Thanks for your work. It is really appreciated.
AYYY, we both live in Florida
Is it just me or the Indian guy always sounds the same in all of his video
I subscribe yesterday man I can’t tell you how many videos I have watched already is so addicted.
If they call you know that is BS
im the 4,000,008 viewer cool!
I get scam calls all the time. I’ve begun responding, “no you aren’t and you’re calling from an Indian scam call center.” Usually a female caller will just hang up and the males will become verbally abusive.
You guys are amazing! Keep up the amazing work!
NO! Not Pearland. Why?! 😫 I was absolutely disgusted and disappointed to see how this lady represented my hometown, shame on you.
Vivian is gorge
🙏🏼 Thank you ❤️
Thank you to Mark, Jim and especially you Pierogi, you are a champion, love your work.
What a HERO really looks like.
I know, right? I say that all the time. Come on somebody do something. But it takes people like you on Youtube and others …to get anything done. So THANK YOU!
Destroy the scammers time to take the scammers money.
I love all your videos
its not India that you should be blaming, its the scammers not India. Please stop
.
this is unbecoming of you, I didn't raise you this way had me busted out laughing
you ae the best, I've been scammed a few time but not much money was gone mainly credit cards
The only channel I would ever become a Patreon too. The work done here is amazing. Can't wait to order my Scammer Payback hoody.
You are a fantastic human being, we need more like you out there
That was amazing you and your team.  Love you thanks. 🙏
As the song goes, CRY BABY CRY,, OH LITTLE BABY JUST CRY CRY CRY!!! Yeah!!! I know this video is last year but still entertaining.  Deleted files anyone?
Amazes me how rude and demanding they are when they’re trying to scam granny. India has call center scams. Russia, China, and Israel send out malware,
They think everyone is stupid. I would immediately be suspicious if he said his name was ‘Steven Miller’ but he has an Indian accent.
You should do a video where you just act like you’re happy about the new money and hang up on the scammer
Thank You ,,,, gives me hope ,,
The actual crime is fraud how Is that not. Clear ?
Your videos are the bomb! I am 72 and get scams everyday. You taught me how to make me have fun pulling there chain!  It is very much fun!   Thank you  so much!
Charan sparsh
The old man at the very start and the ,,me?'' next to it make me laugh so hard.  Its so random 🤣
Thanks man for all that you do
This is what happened to my mother inlaw but with cash app.
Vivian:I didn’t raise you this way Bwahahahaha MY SOUL
Mom went to the potty on their dumb az, came back and slayed 😂😂
Crazy small town i live close too pearland
9:27 EYE BLEACH!!!!! :-O
The scams are put out by the deep state shadow government antichrist government. This is how they get funds to get equipment to fulfill their agenda.
I knew Vivian liked animal print dresses!!  My favorite!!!❤️😂🙏
You are so appreciated!
Ok, question; it shows a glitter bomb and the cops, but there’s no discussion about what happened to the lady with the glitter bomb? Really? That might be a pretty important point of the video! Real or not real? I’m not so sure just yet.
Anyone else just want to punch these scammers right in the fucking face?! 😎
This is such a wonderful thing. SOMEONE REWARD THIS YOUNG MAN!
glitter bomb? that was too nice!  i would had sent them a poo bomb filled with diarrhea.  there's a video to show you how to make one
Careful going to India where they are man I saw one under cover guy nearly get caught and killed by those people
Oh my lord.u dressed as viv🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I just watched this in 2022, I watched it fits my family and brother and at the end we clapped 👏🏼 so much. My brother was scammed out of 75k 🥺😭 You’ll never think it would happen to such a young man. It was from eBay that they sold him a car, made pay threw post before even aloud to see it. Well it didn’t even exist. Being age 36, you’ll never think he would be this stupid… but it happens.. and he couldn’t get the money back so he was paying back a loan for something he never even had..
You are a LEGEND!!! keep up the awesome work.
We love you u guy’s are true heroes 🦸‍♀️ 🦸‍♂️
$@)                                       "" Much Love to U and yours Pierogi ""
So what actually happened to the mule?
Thanks
Explaining how the scam works and all that, is probably killing your watch time. It's super annoying hearing how it works everytime. And I miss shit, and skip over.
You are freakin amazing. Thank you.
Thank you
You're a hero!
Do y’all think think this channel raises as much public awareness as it teaches  hackers some notably effective methods?
Jesus why don't these people call me? It would be the highlight of my day to waste their time lol
We definitely want to thank you for sharing these videos, and getting back with these crooks. Obviously this has been a huge operation, trying to take advantage of us.
How do you stop them from messing up your computer when you are talking with them?
If they call me I tell them if they don't have me alone I'll have Amber Heard poop on thier beds!!!!!! They never call back!
Is there something we can do collectively as a community to fight these scammers?  Would love to be involved with you and others in anti scam project.
ive seen some other guy that does the same and its the same f ing voise. the guy form India.
I would rip him in half...if he tried crying at me
Uh....... ya NO
I adore you guys
I had confronted mail thieves one night as we have a nightmare with them. I had come running out of the house with a 12" inch kitchen knife. It was the passenger who was doing the pilfering. They didn't see me until I was on the car. I heard "OH SHIT!" and I was able to whack off a finger using all I could muster. I decided to hang it from our roof dangling down from the eves with fishing line. In just a few days, it was pecked clean and I took it down. It now resides in a ring box with the label "Dick In A Box."
You all are awesome!! So embarresing for a beautiful place like india!! Few rotten apples mess it up for all
I think a bait box filled with cockroaches would be great for a porch pirate
Thank you for all you do. I have learned so much from you.
I’ve only come to see these videos recently, and can’t get enough of watching the payback.  You guys are an inspiration, love you all.  Joined as a member a few weeks ago to help the the cause
Bahahahahhahahjaha you caught a woman with a pocket package lolololol. Stupid man had a pocket package with a wig lololololol
Wow Pierogi, you've upped your game.
OMG. I just blew a funny fuze with your Vivian Rogers 😅😅😅
I really hope that the cops and shit will do there jobs better cause scammers piss me off and i got hacked and scammed somanytimes where they piss meoff so much ireallylove what you andyour team are doi g to help keep these stupid scammers down
Same glitter stick to that lady's legs flashing lights comical with the cops able to track and arrest! Awesome but that was only one person caught
Thanks to your videos we avoided many of these scammers hurting us  All because of the work you do for American people  Thank you god bless you 💕
Thank you for all what you do
Thank you. I’m a victim. It sucked. I feel so much better
They should teach this in schools so they are aware at a young age to avoid this in the future
Are these videos 100% real?? These are good
OUTSTANDING  !
You guys are legends!
Yes I got one of those phone calls saying it was Amazon and I opted to press 2 thus got a scammer on the line and said hello scammer funny part is the woman said back to me "yes I am a scammer" note I have never used the services of Amazon so I knew it was a scam, I love wasting scammers time for whilst they are wasting time with me they are not scamming someone
If its possible to install anydesk on xp or vista can you do that them one day lol
I started watching because of pierogi - my fave polish dumplings... I stayed for the wholesomeness and PIEROGI <3
Satisfying
Thank you so much.
I love it! Git em granny!
there is no way they charged that lady. the feds literally could not care less about these crimes because it doesn't affect any kind of corporate interests
You should do a scammer dye bag explosive
Simping for Vivian real hard from day 1 she shows up
WE LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
❤️❤️❤️⭐️⭐️⭐️❤️❤️❤️
so... is vivian single? just asking for a friend...
Next Mission: Kolkata scam hubs.
one of my favorite foods is perogies lol I love your jet black blue hair🤩🥰😍
one of my favorite foods is perogies lol🥰🥰😍😍🤩🤩🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤 literally no pun intended....
You are incredible!
Keep doing what you are doing, I was pretty much clued up about these scammers, but I noticed that I kept getting Norton Virus email messages & others saying that I needed to renew my account BUT I haven’t had anything to do with Norton in particular for over 10 years !!!. People need to get clued up & understand what these wutless people are trying to do. They will use any means to get your money. I thank & applaud you for what you & others are doing. These people are the scum of the earth & the law needs to start making what they do a crime that carries long custodial sentences. No mercy should be given to them especially when they are scamming the elderly & those who suffer from dementia. Not everyone of this section of society has family & friends to protect them so society SHOULD BE. KEEP DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING LONG MAY YOU REIGN 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽
Thank you. So very much.
If only the glitter bomb was a real bomb. I know that’s an extremely dark thought and maybe I should chill out on watching these videos cause all I can think about is that these people ruin lives and get slaps on the wrists for it
Sweet!
Those scammers never call me(( i only get stpd stuff like "wanna buy super magical hair gel that cures everything?" or something.
In this day and age in which money is transferred digitally, whoever sends money in a package is really gullible. Even before this advanced digital age, people sent money via checks and money orders. Sending large sums of money via package is very irresponsible.
This is bullshit you blur their face out after all the harm they put people through
sweet  if they  call u if nothing else waste time with them. it's so sad I've been on calls to go work on computers and always I paid to get it fixed and it was a scam. they had no money left and I would still fix computers and tell them not to do that anymore.
Hahahaha the scammer crying is music to my ears!
You are a legend and legit hero 🙏🏻
Hell yeah!!!!!!!
As someone that has been robbed before, nothing feels better than to see these scammers get this kind of payback! This is awesome man, yall need to collaborate more! I could watch these all day
Your so cute as a 👱‍♀️ thanks for what you do.
Thankyou for helpping us scammers must be stopped xx we need more of you
you guys are epic warriors!!! keep fighting and please help everyone you can! YOU'RE THE MAN PEROGY
Loved it man. Keep up the good work.
Lipstick actually suits you dude 😂
This is one of the best way to stop these scammers..show their faces on the internet and save victims..
The ultimate would be to ruin their life for good.
Wow these scammers are pathetic. Targeting old people smh
the country of origin should be fined for not doing more to stop this.
i want to believe all this videos were real, but it is not.
They deserve it keep up the great work
I lost my sh*t at "I love you^
Do this again with an actual bomb
Drop an air tag into a box.
Awe Vivian Rodgers is so perty 😂🤣Love all yall do!😍
I can't help it! I am very sexually attracted to Vivian Rodgers!
You feel sorry for these scammers. Big mistake. Grow some balls. I love what you're doing but go to a motel and if doesn't have an Indian owner I will kiss your ass .These MFrs are just one of America's threats.
Rober rocks.  He is amazing watch his squirrel video
Why do most scammers sound like an indian
That blonde wig is weirdly working for me. I need to re-think things.
Why on earth would you go through such a length of effort to return the supposedly too much transferred money from a supposedly company.  I understand how the scam works, but if this was for real, I would keep the money, no crying Steve could persuade me.  Good work on getting these scammer what they deserve!
Fucking love what y’all are doing!
PLEASE  PLEASE  PLEASE  KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND PRAYERS
Its so easy to notice a scammer since they're indian
That dark blue hair is luscious.
How do you get control?  How do you reverse who has control of the computer?
Curious why is this an Indian thing ?
I'm new but I have watched so many of your videos back to back and subscribed because you are doing the lord's work lol!!!!
Pause at 10:26... you're welcome. Why does he look so good as an old lady though? 🤣
THE GOOD WORK
Can you not just access their sprinkler system and wet their computers or just set off fire alarms so the authorities fine them
I wish I could destroy these indian scammers . But really how stupid can one be to believe these scammers with their thick accents  and how do one ever let some stranger talk you into giving acces to your computer ?
“Go to the store I will not cry.” 🙄 Sigh.
These are all great videos, but it's a bit troubling to hear Pierogi talk about how "I'M gonna save more victims" and how it's great "you're giving ME all this love" when we all know it's a team effort. Who are you doing this for, Pierogi? We're not being conned, are we?
Man... I wish I had seen your videos before I had a bunch of money taken from me through this type of scam. I didn't even realize how common this is.
Beautiful 😂
Vivian Rodgers is lovely ❤️
Society needs to wake up you need to wake up sound like one of those concpiracy theorists trying to convince you the sun is a worm and the rest is an egg
SHARE!!!!!!!
Vivian is looking fiiiiine 😆 What’s her number?
I  hope you have better sense than to go to India?
Love the Glitter bomb 💣with fart spray
My name is Stuart. I'm 60 yrs. old and I want to bear your children. Pierogi for president.
THANK YOU for EVERYTHING you guys do!! You ARE HEROS & an INSPIRATION & we ALL owe you so much GRATITUDE. MAD RESPECT! 💙🇺🇸🌍
I so appreciate you. Your crew. I am 63 and I don't fall for all of this. I have taken many precautions against scammers. And BLOCKADES. I do appreciate though that you help those who do not know better. Thank you.
This was so satisfying
You guys are absolute heroes! Thank you! Thank you!! Thank you!!!
Does anyone believe a person with thick Indian accent has an English first and last name?
U  R  AWESOME
The point where you are wrapping envelopes of cash in tin foil and still dont know you're being scammed.
No fucking way I literally grew up in Pearland it is such a nice area I cannot believe people with money like that could do this to other people that is some bullshit everyone out there is doing well for themselves and has no reason to be stealing from other people
Love Love Love
Amazing work thank you!  There's a guy from 🇳🇿 who got himself in deep with the Indian govt for unmasking these scammers. Thank you again, u guys do amazing work and risk your lives! God bless
These guys and their teams are like the Avengers of anti-scamming😂
I was scammed a few years ago, they have been trying ever since to get me again. I actually enjoy answering the phone call, I get them to do their whole spiel all over again and over again and over again and over again it has been glorious. Though I do believe I would kill these people if I ever came in contact with them in real life. I don’t think the scammers realize what would happen if they were actually caught by the people they are scamming.
Show that lady's face. She deserves to be humiliated.
I’m loving Vivian’s fashion sense lol
did the lady call the police or did she get arrested?  edit: nvm she did get arrested
@14:12 Rush were just 3 guys making music. Not sayin', just sayin.
at 8:50 i died laughing 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You’re one of my biggest heroes.. thank you for everything 🙏🏼
I feel so bad for that Air BnB owner. Has a house full of glitter and probably couldn't rent until that stench aired out. Glad they caught someone involved in this stuff, though.
I got scammed 300£ and didn’t get a penny back, they basically got me to type a code in on my account but that secretly gave them access to my account then they gifted there self 300£ worth of stuff and because it was a gift i couldn’t get anything back
Thank you all for protecting people,
When are you getting an American scammer  there is a lot of them for Medicare cheating old people out of their money
I can’t stand that word “kindly.” My default thinking is a scam.
I am glad I’m paranoid. I wouldn’t even speak with someone like this  other than to say, “send me a check.” Who would actually send cash? Well, I worked at bank and saw it all the time. The most was over $2200 IN CASH!!!!! That is a crazy level of stupid. I would tell them they deserve to lose their job if they cannot do it correctly. A better candidate is ready to take their job!
- Grandma, where's my birthday present? - 9:12
What ...Did I see MM there..
I have been watching your videos.....now I am so confident that no one can scam me...thank you so much. And one more thing I want to say.....i am in love with you 🙂
How  she hasn't gagged with the spray???
Too bad it doesn't spray super glue before glitter..lolol
Curious , Have you done any work with Kitboga and I'm not sure who started doing this first but has anything He's done helped you with what you do? Both of you guys are just as much of a super hero as anyone from Marvel or DC.
OK, I know this is serious business, but when I saw Vivian on screen....rotfl🤣🤣 And the glitter crotch shot at the end...yesssssssssss.
I think what you're doing is spectacular, awesome, brilliant, totally heroic. But let me just add, I frikkin love 🙆🏻‍♀️💙🖤💙 the colour of your hair in this video.
I can't believe she put it in her car. That's a glitter bomb first
Thanks bro. It's not just entertainment, it's informative and I appreciate what you guys do.
Full respect to you guys! 👏
I can't afford to support you. But I will share this with everybody
Should do that to all scammers
This is like The Jerky Boys, but with Scammers. Always amazing!
I LOVE YOU, VIVIAN!
Thank you Pierogi, Mark, Jim, Kitbogi, and everyone who does this kind of gods work exposing and taking down this scum of the earth!! We all stand with you!!
Good stuff👏
Vivian Rogers is hawt!
Hahahahahaha
Good job bro
I wanna beat those scammers up..... 💀
Great guy
lol
Hey, can you teach us how to set up virtual machines?  How can the average person get involved and help waste more of these guys' time?  Would you ever consider doing a Scambaiting mini course??? LOL 🤣  Seriously though.
You guys are awesome!
This is why you don't ever pickup a call from someone you don't know
You're a real life super hero.
Did anything happen the girl caught with the glitter bomb?
Nobody cares about crime because of the liberal policies in place. We must get rid of these democrats in office!
What he does.
This is great what does.
I feel like the cry is fake just to make the situation more emotional for people to actually give these scammers the money. All in all u do a fantastic job at what u do
I love these videos, Mark. Sweet revenge is never sweeter than when brought on to a scammer who targets the elderly.
Oh,No. don't cry. It sucks to be you! Psyche! Later, WOO-HOO!😁
👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻
Congratulations, all your time and work is paying off.  Finally police is starting to listen yo you!  Keep up to great work
They got me for 7k, during foreclosure. Insult to injury,  dang.
Don't go to India. It's totally corrupt. They will kill you. Keep doing your good work from here.
Both me and my girlfriend have been scammed! Thank you sir 🙏
I sleep well at night knowing there’s people like you saving the world
Love the work you do bro, keep the good work up!
Imagine crying like Steven
Thank you!!!!!
Finally subbed
I literally laughed out loud when she stepped out with all that shiny glitter on her pants!!🤣
bravo
I respect Jim!  Not mark rober. He’s a part of the scam of life. Mormons always try to take all the money you make. They guilt trip what you do and try to make money off of you. Feeling sorry for mark rober but I can’t support what he does. It’s disgusting
You are a super hero❤️👩🏻‍🎨💋
Fun fact about American money it's all traceable get a flashlight you'll notice real quick why
something for their country to be a proud about
Maybe the government should have to reimburse the victims!  Then see how fast these scammers disappear!
Glitter bomb? How about a piss bomb, or worse?
You are a saint. God bless all that you do for us.
WE THANK YOU! PLEASE KEEP IT UP!
Your awesome, had a grandparent almost get scammed, I showed him a couple of videos, know he knows exactly how they do it, u saved another person, bless you 🙌
You are so amazing,
You deserve to be scammed if you don't use 2fa/mfa to bank online.
You are so right, nobody’s care, except you and your team
Vivian is a G! 🤣🤸🏽‍♀️
keep up the good work man
Now this was awesome, it will be great if you can do more videos like this. Keep up the great work, I pray that God will bless you and your family abundantly 🙏🏻
Great job and also great haircut, looks amazing on you, keep slayin
We are fortunate you are bright enough to figure this out...please continue Pierogi
nice one
Hey all...the least we can do to support this video and more like it, is to let the advertisements play and do not skip.
"You have to help me otherwise I'll lose my job".. well suck to be you then C YA 🤣
Hello Pirogi Team, I am an Indian and ashamed for what my fellow Indians are doing.. Unfortunately its a fact and most of the scammers are from India and I know personally, a very good friend of mine, he used to work for someone as a scammer before.. I was thinking, Can we somehow collaborate to get into the deep roots of the scammers? I might figure out through my friend the network of scammers, so that we can punish them. Our government is very corrupt, and I dont know how to punish these culprits?
Wonder how foolish the victims are to hand over the access to their computers, and go to the lengths to send the money physically.
Well done.
8:50 Think I'd say "qué un cocodrilo" just to see if he catch it. Really rotten since sounds more like he's laughing about it. 😠
Tuned in
Very inspiring,  much love from South Africa 🇿🇦
I mean if the victims “receive” more money than they should if it was me I would just “run away” with it
How does the weird packaging not tip them off? Most of their victims may be old but old doesn't mean they're an idiot. What's the deal? Are the scammers banking on the emotional manipulation overriding their mark's logical reasoning?
Found your channel through Mark and can tell you are going to be one of my favourite YouTubers to watch. I’m learning a lot from these videos and love that you are spreading this knowledge out to the world for others to find out how to spot and stop these scammers
Still can’t believe people fall for that and go to that much effort for them to send the money. I’m sure when I’m old that will only need to fart and they capture my DNA to scam me.
3:00 😝 God! I love that wallpaper! Spot on!
Ty jsi absolutní člověk! Pokračujte v tom, co děláte! (Myslí si, že se skrýváte ve stínech... ale vy JSTE stíny!)
you guys are nice, I would put a dead skunk, run over and socked down.
There aren't too many real life superheroes, but what you guys do is incredible!
I can't believe I'm about to quote hillary, but can we just drone these bastards? Seriously, the world would be a better place without these scammers... I know plenty of hard working indians that hate these guys as much as we do...  Thank you for your work!  The glitter bomb is a great touch, hopefully that got law enforcement on a path to the assholes in india...
The US government and courts, customs are corrupt. They pay people in India to help them smuggle cash abroad which is used to fund terrorism which includes the Indian security services helping to destabilise the area. The masters of the scam circuits gives cash upwards. It’s off the books use of the usd.
This is awesome! How amazing are these videos!!! And can we appreciate how much time goes into editing and making these videos.  And how lovely is his blue hair!! Love it
Thats awesome love it man keep it up
Thanks for everything guys. I showed your videos to everyone in my family and they appreciate what you guys are doing to. I also find these very entertaining cause it's funny that everyone rages and you just laugh. Also love glitter bombs. Watched most of mark Robers videos. Five out of five stars
These scammers need to be beaten within an inch of their lives. Makes my blood boil what they do to old people.  We should send some of "da boys" from Brooklyn to break their knee caps.  And for the record... I generally don't believe in violence... but in these F-er's case.... I would make an exception and still sleep well at night.  It's also a sad indictment on our government and law enforcement agencies that it takes YouTubers to make a difference. Shame on our elected officials.
Can someone please tell me what happens is you just straight don’t refund the money can u just withdraw and keep it? How are they making it look like you have 50k in your account?
Legend
Well as thousands of Indians CAN'T FEED THEIR FAMILIES it wouldn't bother me by their scam.
Not depending where you live . Depending on how many sgow are in that country. UK thousands of them.
thank you so much we appreciate what you are doing ,this is the best policy to be a human bean and you are one of them if we all dood human bean we will have a bood community /country/wide world bless you all
I did not expect full cosplay but here we are. Vivian is single
Content starts at 12:47
Thanks
computer auto renewal????? WTF is tat
thanks to this people
I can't wait for the day you Glitter Bomb and Fart Bomb the scammers office.  Talk about Karma!!!  LOL
If you dislike this video, then you're probably a scammer. Or at least a terrible person. As of the writing of this comment, there are 1,699 people who have disliked this.
Your head looks like someone dunked it in a porta potty.
I bust out laughing every time he says I love you
You mark and jim should all run a call center there that block them all or disrupt their networks and all of our combined patreons will fund the disabling. I have a Linux system that runs on a old amd fx with 4gb of ram and a 5200rpm drive. Its always a blast having them connect to me.  Thanks for all the work yall do, with quality uploads and HOURS of entertainment. Modern day saints in my book.
Jesus fucking christ not to victim blame or anything but how do you even get elderly people to do all of that. Some of my grandparents can barely figure out how a normal browser works. I mean, i guess people would have to be somewhat demented to fall for it, but if they have dementia how do they even comply. It really sound like a specific niché of people who are well aware of how to function yet are extremely naive and not prone to anger or frustration to comply.
I live in Texas and I’m not far from pearland. That’s just great y’all need to do this more often.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why the Indian Police is not arresting the hackers and fraudsters. It's so disheartening to see a handful of scammers are defaming the whole nation.
has anyone ever hacked you back?
Thanks!
This is the greatest YouTube channel of 2022. This is so amazing and satisfying. Criminals getting prosecuted makes victims happy. Thank you Pierogi. You're the best! 🎉
Lmao.... Vivian.....character....hillarious!!!!
blue hair??????
send them drugs so they get arrested for a good crime
I believe you guys ARE making a difference.  good work
The Weakest Vivian vs The Strongest Prahalad
Nice job
Thanks!
Payback
Dam you look hot with that wig on
I love your videos I want to be as good as you help stop this scammers I’m currently in college to become a computer tech
the thumbnail is why I clicked, youdaman
Love your work young man. May God continue to prosper you and your family.
Just why u guys censored their faces?
Watch now I'm subbed to you your content will stop showing up it happens nearly every time i sub to someone on YouTube
Idk even know where the dubbla button is, there’s no way I can hit dubbla dubbla dubbla
So awesome Pierogi! Thank you so much! 🥰💕💕.
I love seeing a scammer finally get some justice. It's great the work you guys are doing and I hope you will continue it!!!
So just in case I missed something, are you actually taking their money when they "deposit" it into your account?
Love seeing the create-react-app favicon
Awesome! You’re the best and I thank you for everything you do!
I am barely computer literate, so when I get a scam call, I string them along as long as possible, and then have highly  inappropriate conversations concerning... certain sexual eccentricities.  I figure if they are on the line with me, they aren't on the line with others.
When I get these scammer calls I let them have it! The older I get the more calls I get. Thanks for what you do!
Thats was awesome keep up the good work
Thank you for catching these punks!
Hit ‘em hard and fast Vivian
That's awesome keep it up brother
REALLY PEOPLE!?  SOMEONE WOULD ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE IN SHARING THEIR BANK ACCOUNT’S CREDENTIALS….WITH ANYONE !!??  WAKE UP PEOPLE !!!  ARE YOU REALLY THIS STUPID !!!??? IF YOU ARE THIS STUPID…..PLEASE…. NEVER AGAIN STEP FOOT OUT OF THE HOUSE, ANSWER A PHONE CALL, WATCH TELEVISION, URINATE, MAKE A MICROWAVE DINNER, ETC……WITHOUT ADULT SUPERVISION. YOU ARE NOT FIT TO HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT WITH MONEY IN IT.
I Work for UPS and they really dont give a rats ass about anything
Why do you blur their faces?
Good on you not only for exposing scammers, but for Vivien Rogers and for having some fun with this idea :)
Vivian Rogers looks waaaaaay different than I pictured her. 😄
legend
Ur actually a fkn hero man thank you
Scammer how Fake do you want ??? Steven crying 🤣🤣🤣🤣
legend
You are awesome! Thanks for your hard work.
May not be able to directly help much myself, but I can sub and support your cause!
Next: we send this scammer a flashbang and a EMP( featuring captain price from MW3( he lauches a nuke from a russian nuclear sub then explodes it in high atmosphere so that its just EMP)) and shit will start falling from the sky
You should start calling your web browser icon "the button for the internet".
I appreciate that you give a basic rundown of the scam tactics and what to watch out for nearly every video, it shows you actually care about keeping people safe and not just making content. Keep fighting the good fight!
I love that you guys are working together on this!
Hi thank you for doing this for the us keep up the great job 😊👍
12:22 how come you won’t show their faces?
Stop crying, it’s unbecoming! I love it! Every elderly person should be this savage in real life!
You tortured Macauley "Kevin" Culkin ????   😇 ( i LOVE those Glitterbombs !)
The Geek Squad "Cancellation Department" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Your a greater hero then Batman
I love your colored hair.
did the scammer get arrested?
Well done
The FBI too busy hunting American citizens for political views.  This guy is a true hero.
Your the best !   I absolutely love what you do
Thank you for what you do. It has enlightened me and I will show your channel to my family and friends.
I'm gonna say the 1.6k dislikes are probably scammers
You are a HERO. Thank You
I think you going to India would be dangerous man. Laws in other countries don’t exactly protect foreigners
Instead of a disinformation squad usa need these guys to shut down these leaches and maybe even find bidens backbone
I wish you could help me. I get anywhere from 15 to 40 scam calls a day on my cell. Any ideas on how to stop them???
I’m a little embarrassed to admit it but intelligence like this really gets me going.
The FCC needs to be more involved with fighting these freaking scammer idiots.  Never send anyone your money no matter how sympathetic they seem. It’s all a flipping scam.  Don’t believe the love lies.!!  If it sounds too good to be true, IT IS!!!
Thanks
Vivian is HOT!!!
HAHAHAHAH, thats a awesome thing to do! Hugs from Brasil!
Just wanna say thank you for everything because my mom was rapt up in the romanse scam DEC of last year she past a way from covid I miss her so much she gave up I tried everything to help her she was loseing  her house and lost her mind I feel like to from been broken so many time its going to be a long recovery for my family be we are strong and if there anything I can say is to the people we are strong but only together we can stop this love is powerful and it can kill u if it not carful so please keep doing what's ur  doing
Brother, you're an American hero! Keep on giving those scumbags their due.
Keep up the good work.
lol she out here in houston
Thank you so much for the good work you're doing
Why don’t you show these scumbags faces?
Next time, instead of glitter, use chalk with a message that says, "You have now been infected with a lethal dose of Anthrax. Have a nice day. Shop smart. Shop S smart."
justice is served
Awesome, busted cold!!!
Thank you from India.  you wouldn't believe how a very small number of scammers are ruining this whole thing.
You earn a new subscriber. 👍
Do NOT go to India!! Life abroad can be very very cheap. It would take very little on a criminal’s part to make u disappear! Just stay where u are n keep doing good! I still encourage u to go to Washington n lobby to be heard!
Love it. Wowee all the best from Canada. 🤩🤩🤩🤩
You remind me of Adam Sandler for some unexplainable reason
Go to India, 80million views I bet! Epic af
How can anyone take someone with an Indian accident seriously?
I would love to help you, I don't have the computer skills you have. But still have fun with the scammers
Do you if Vivian Is single? Also can she make Lasagna?
you guys rock!
You guys do amazing  stuff  for a lot of ppl,
Keep up the great work and thanks for insight into these scams. As we get them a lot here in Australia 🇦🇺 I'm blocking them but they seem to use a different number and these numbers seem to be Australian. I have checked the numbers and they are from either SA (South Australia), NT (Northern territory)  or  WA (Western Australia). I just keep blocking and deleting.
Sir….You Rock!!!….Thank you for what you do everyday fighting for those who are being scammed.  You are a true human being, thank God for people like you who have the insight and intelligence to hit back at those who prey on peoples naïveté.  Now the world just needs 100,000 more like you. 😎  Thank you again, you make our world a little better and safer everyday, that is what being a human being is all about.  God Bless you and all those important to you.   Keep giving them hell, right now you are like Ukraine in the fight against a seemingly insurmountable enemy but you are making a difference and in many ways winning like Ukraine.  Again, God bless and thank you sir.
This would be better if you used 2lbs of C-4.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!!!  After watching your videos I realize I was lucky, they only got $1000 from me, and I got it back from my bank.  It was my trip money for my sons Make A Wish trip.  They got me through the Zelle money transfer in my bank mobile app.  I didn't give them any sensitive info, so don't know how they did it.  Either way, I share your videos as much as I can, so others know about this.  Makes me so mad what they do to our elderly.  You guys are the best!!!!!
AWESOME YOU 3 THKS
Thank you for the work you continue to do. I've been involved with PCs since they were created, and thus computer security as well. I've tried my best to waste as much scammer time as I possibly can whenever I can. I've never been able to get someone back with law enforcement or a fantastic glitter bomb for scamming, but I have had the opportunity to turn the FBI onto some computer criminals.   The best work I, and the actual computer hackers, not criminals, can do is provide information and education. What you do is epic and righteous! You provide a powerful and useful service that has already helped so many.  Don't give up! Keep it up fellow hacker! (and let me know how I can help, cuz, who doesn't want to help deliver a glitter bomb to a scammer?!)
You two make a driving force of toppling down these type of people😁👍
I literally always say Incogito when I'm testing SAML auth.  I hate you for that, rofl.
Pearland Texas, this scammer was just up the road from me by less then 45 minutes.
Good luck on them trying to scam me cuz I keep my account on $0.01🤣
Great work, Pierogi! Learning a lot. The glitter bomb thing is a very good idea!
Acting or not. No real man can dress up as a woman and put on makeup. Done watching this dude
Well lady pierogi is a hot milf
So you caught one of the scammers with a glitterbomb? Or did she call the law on herself
Hey ,i stay in India ,tell me if you need any help ,just drop me a mail ,I will be happy to help in anyway I can  Thanks Ashish
We have the same troubles with scamers in germany. But these are no callers from india, most from turkey they speak our language.
Bruh these scammers don't even know to spell and yet manage to get some victims
You should show they face instead of blurring it out
These guys need to beat up every day, human scumbags
glitter trap and mild stink, little league stuff there, step up your game, carbon diselenide.
Who was that masked man 🙂
I get phone calls almost daily from these scammers. So annoying!
I got scammed a few years ago. They wanted me to send them $40,000 or they would delete all my files on my computer.
Doing the Lord's work dude
Need to do these more...get these packages to the people on the phones 🤣
Was that glitter bomb victim, also a scam victim like “Susan”. Who may have just been also being used?
can i get a shout out for Vivian shes fucking brilliant LOOOOOL
What happens when you get this money and just keep it? Give it to authorities?
Diversity is not a strength
Just love what you do, be safe and keep up the good work
Gamer moment
Gamer moment
What if, instead of glitter, we use gunpowder.
awesome work..ypu should run for public office !!
If they scam you by sending you thousands of dollars by “accident” y not just hang up n keep it. If it’s still in ur bank then it’s yours no need to send I back
F****** beautiful well executed. Love what you do.  Your awesome and may the Lord bless you. Always
I don't trust anyone with an accent anymore.
This is like the jerky boys revenge of kerpal
You’re adorable
Keep up the crusade man!
Thank you so much going after these scammers. You are the best of what you do. I have been scammed a while back and lost $1000.
love the blue hair 💙
I don't use zelle anyway
Way to go bud. Go get em
Dude Perogi you’re really blowing up now
Thank you because no body take part in this and this crime affect a lot of people.
As a long term solution - can't you use napalm instead of glitter? *G*
I love everything you all do against scammers :D
I think I love you = - )
You are doing a great job.... Thank
Honestly, this is the only channel I would ever consider joining and even backing on patreon. The work this man does benefits us common folk. He could be the one to save your grandma from a scammer one day.
yo vivian rogers kinda hot, ngl.
We love Vivian Rogers.. Hilarious😂
Good job guys!!!!
Ha ha ha.... Good stuff and all the best to you.
Well-done and keep going...from: London, UK.
The scammer sounds like Raj from The Big Bang Theory.
Jesus loves u all so much
"Mom?"
ok
They try to get my dad all the time call 60 times a day.  Take me with to where they at.  Jail don't bug me.  And won't call cop.  If I never track one down he done.
Great work 👍
one day i hope your work leads to some doors getting kicked in over in india
You do The best work Keep up the work you do you do a great service
Teaming up with Mark, I now know you're doing the Lord's work - well done sir.
Brilliant result!... but what ever happened to the lady?
Can you expose the cryptocurrency scammers?
I can't believe the cops got the scammer. Wow, this is great! Thank you!
My father is being scammed right now and he won’t listen that it’s a scam…a doctor lady is “giving “ my dad (76 years old) several million dollars if he gives them 160k… he has done it… and still thinks he’s not being scammed
My father is being scammed right now and he won’t listen that it’s a scam…a doctor lady is “giving “ my dad (76 years old) several million dollars if he gives them 160k… he has done it… and still thinks he’s not being scammed
I've loved watching you and learning how these scams work. I wonder how many people you've saved from being scammed. We'll probably never know but in heaven,  I'll bet your crown will be too heavy to wear for all the gems!!
well done!!
yesss this is what i like to see, justice being done on scammers
Nice work. Put these thieves in jail
This rocks!!!!!!
Nothing will happen about this kind of scam until a rich person is scammed
3:30 dubblu dubblu dubblu
I think it should be made impossible to call internationally, without full disclosure.  Seems like YouTubers care, and the telephone companies don’t.  As long as it’s profitable for a phone company to serve the scammers, nothing changes.    Make the phone companies responsible, with regulations, fines, and repayments to victims.  Then everything changes.    Imagine a world without nuisance calls
Keep it going!!!
Is the bank screen thats your bank a dummy screen they made up? I don't understand how they show you have 50k in your account if they didn't send 50k. Please explain
people tell me to just hang up but I like to keep them on as long as I can. that's one less person they have time to scam
Sweey
Outstanding work From Scotland.
It's a good thing I dont have your skillset. Cause I would have replaced that glitter with C4, or a good old fashion hand grenade.
I just found you here and this is what I wanna do in my free time
People will listen to these people without a second thought, because, AMERICAN COMPANIES USE INDIA BASED CALL CENTERS, SO THE SCAMMERS ALL SOUNDS LIGIT.
I you are a real honest man and you are doing all this HONEST WORK, I really appreciated! Amazing!
You are a hero my friend. that is direct Action.
PLEASE do a video where u purposely steal money from them but ack like it was an accident
You're Batman, dude 🤣
How do you know the scammers arent using virtual pcs? like when you delete their files. do they ever use virtual pcs?
Loved.  It.
Vivian - I almost lost my lunch on that part.  You're the man.  Keep up the fight.
Mule just got kicked in the head,, well done!
Well done again!  Jim's from the part of the world where I was born, he's a good guy. My own widowed mother has been terrorised by Indian scammers who, when they didn't get what they wanted, called her, day & night, with silent calls which always ended with well-known, disgusting slurs, shouted at her, down the telephone,  in  Urdu, Bengali & Punjabi.  I realise that scammers operate all over the world but a large number of them operate out of India.  You said in this vlog that you'd maybe go to India one day. That's what I'd decided to do when I was asked to join a team from, "Medecins Sans Frontieres" to work in M. Teresa's scam "operation" in Kalighat, Kolkata.  Although that hell-hole is given donations into the millions, annually, we were told not to even distribute aspirin to the dying who were lying in filthy beds, dressings unchanged since their arrival & unattended, even with drinks of water by the nuns.  When we questioned the cruel attitude that pervaded, we were told that they were dying anyway so what was the point in wasting donations on someone who wasn't going to get better, when it could be given to the church? Teresa always looked so humble, yet her feet never touched the ground in the slums but was, famously,  driven around in a "gold" Rolls gifted to her by the Duvaliers who'd ripped off the poor in Haiti.  We had to try to do our work while we were scolded by the nuns!!  I know this is off-topic but this is another Indian secret scam which operates out of sight of the world's media as well.  I just wish that the Indian government would hire some of the thousands of techies who flood out of that sub-continent & into many other countries in search of employment, to aid law enforcement &, one-by-one, put the scammers out of business & into prison.
we love you brother... much love
AWESOME DUDE
These videos are highly entertaining but I absolutely love what you guys are doing. Please never stop!
For one of your video you should make the wall paper a photo of the scammers building or Google maps screen shot
How can I help destroy scammers with your help
This needs a follow up with an interview of the scammer that got glitter bombed.
I'm sorry, but why is Vivianne so gorgeous ?
This is awesome, if I were a billionaire id just throw money at you guys to continue your needed work. So freakin awesome
Thanks, have you looked into the se ecrrt shopper scam? They are sophisticated a d after you shop for them they cancel the check
It’s gotta feel like a little load off your shoulders physically seeing the difference you make. It’s one thing to call victims, which is great, but to actually see some justice being served has to be so fulfilling. Thank you, and to everyone else involved, for doing what you do.
do you gave up kahalol
don't hung up the phone wow don't hang up the phone you mean wow
🤘🏼✊🏻👍🏻👏🏻✨⭐️❤️‍🔥✨💫♥️❤️💛💙❤️‍🔥
why the speedrun timer tho
you enjoyed dress up wayy too much lol
I enjoy the part where he sings Congratulations! 👌🤣🤣
You couldn’t believe all your years of work led up to this glitter bomb wow how do you actually guess you know lay some charges have some these people arrested that would actually be doing something you know besides making videos and calling his guys including some files
Yeah man people need to wake up man to the scams let’s get woke y’all , let’s cancel these sons of bitches, lmfao
We need a play/musical starring scammers. Their acting is top notch!
Does sending this to the authorities ever result in anything?
So very happy you are doing this.
+7 is Russian extension. For India it is +91.
You are my HERO !!!
why is the scammer wearing lady clothes
incredible stuff way to be on the case all of you
do you loose any money from any of these @Scammer Payback
I love your channel!! But is there a way that if they put money in your account (you not a noobie) could keep the money and donate it?  Or keep it, to F with them?
Seeing that police car pull up on her ride, was satisfying  keep up the good work
It’s not exactly a wonderful victory to land that glitter box in TX, because they’re just a gopher. You need to find a way to get that parcel into the hands of the scammers overseas so there’s a little more genuine fear out into them if at all possible.
Not all heroes wear capes.
Not all heroes wear capes!   Thank you for your service.
Man scammers are ruining India's reputation more than it's already ruined.
You've got a whole lot of tenacity and a great singing voice Pierogi. Keep at it
FBI needs this guy in the team!
Shared to parents, my children, to Facebook just to get the word out
Meanwhile the FBI spending all their time investigating parents who don't want pedophilia taught to their children in the public schools
“Mary Swanson” great movie and name to use 😂
how is there not a nobel prize for these guys!!!!   my mom didnt get scammed from amazon because of your videos (shes 67)
I just watched this for the first time. All I can say is thank you, brother and God bless!
I love your videos. You are like a Digital Superhero. Scammers almost got me years ago and I know this shit is real!
Keep US updated on this scammer. If he goes to jail or so
The fact your hat and your logo are off centered is bothering me lol
Nicely done
Rule number one. If you hear Gupta or Rajish hang the fuck up. Unless its the scam in a box Marriott scam lol
블리블라 블럽
So glad to see the cops arresting these scum bags
I always say, “Oh! Let me get my mommy.” And then I hand the phone to my little toddler who LOVES to chat. 🤣🤣🤣
👍👍👍😊
Good job man. But what I dont understand who was that lady who got the glitter bomb? Was she the mulebin the u.s working with the bindus in india?
I always get Amazon callers if I wish to continue or end my subscription,  I  always mess them up, and they always  go on about Fu€k!ng your mom? Total loosers.
I thank you (you are Magnificent)
I am an indian , I am disgusted by this scamming of innocent victims and incredibly vulnerable , sincere trusting kind of people who trust others ,  You are doing an awesome job buddy ....get them brother
Love from India!! ❤️ Hope u come here soon! Well done and thanks!:) ❤️👍✌️😊🙏
wish you kept your woke rainbow crap for yourself
You are the man
Why not send these a$$holes the real one instead of these glitterbombs.
Thank you!
The people wrapping up money in tin foil deserve to whatever happens to them. Americans listening to a terrorist over the phone.
This should be on prime time so more people can see what can happen.
PURE GENIUS !
This is probably the most satisfying and exciting case of seeing a cop show up on a youtube video.  Loved the outcome, thank you so much!
🔥
Ban all calls from India and make companies have call centers in the country of where they are stop supporting India simple
The glitter bomb is great invention of necessity.
Classic!
So awesome, keep up the great work.
Heroes are just people who couldn't watch anymore, and have to do something.
Why did you hide her face
The laws in india require victims to travel there to make their complaints. only makes it easier for the scammers
you guys are amazing! thank you!
Omg. I absolutely love Mark and his glitter bombs. Yall are awesome for getting together and doing this!!!  We need more glitter bombs. Maybe send them to the call centers
hahahahaha!  love it!
We need to start with America first this is a crooked country keep an eye on the freemasons anything after the 33rd° a.k.a. Iluminati in the stupid bankers who’s watching them?
It should be allowed to show there faces
If law enforcement won't do anything, then partner with some former military guys and put these scammers in the ground.  Do that a few times and the rest will get the message.
Thank you. We need teams of people with your intel to get back in greater numbers, because it seems that scammers are growing exponentially.
This is the very best channel I have found.  I LOVE IT. I hope he gets everyone of these idiots.  Keep it going man good stuff
"The government needs to wake up."  The government never gave a shit about you.
Well done.
Maybe the company who makes theses glitter bomb can give to a discount
I will go to India with you if you like
YOU!!!!!  Are AWESOME!!!!!!
so pathetic
"Loving on my family"  You sure you want me to do that?
Your channel is so fucking dramatic
12:48  I usually expect to see a nice pair of (  .  Y  .  ) when I see jeans like that, not a bunch of mamMALE toe.
WHY are you blocking out their Face??????????????????????????????????????????????????
Vivian gettin down with Post Malone is 🤌🏼
Yes
he is a verry beautiful man. hello from turkey
Mark Rober is the fakest YT personality out there. He really expects us to believe he invented a way to stop Amazon package theft..... All by himself.... In reality he started a small business and employed 10-15 people probably funded by Amazon, put 4 cell phones worth $600 each, so $2400 total making each device just to dispense glitter and fart spray... He even admitted all the people who were involved were friends who were paid to be "thieves" in the video. One of which is/was his boyfriend.
What you do is amazing. The police should be helping you all the way
your a hero
Marks content is fake AF.
Why is her face blurred out? She’s a criminal and criminals get exposed. Unless this is all just fake bs
im glad you prank those piece of garbage fake humans..   they deserve the worst of the worst
gliter bomb scammers
One time you should say you don’t care about that they’ll “lose their job” and see what they do
you GUYS rule!
if anyone wants to know, the boxes are first shipped to people in america to "not look suspicious" and then those people send it to the scammers (they send it to india).  They have to record  themselves opening the box too so this was epic!
yall rock bro.... people need to wake up to this and many other things and stop being naive sheep incapable of independent critical thinking....i just sense that we're expecting or hoping for the impossible...at least for the majority of the herd
I usually egg them on while acting really dumb. Usually I end up getting cursed at and tell them to eat it
i one time got a message from paypal when i dont have a account with paypal and i opened the link an i knew its a scam cause the website loo sketchy so yea
Let’s go to India and whop their ass they got me with1500 from excel energy you got my support!!!
they need to use skunk scent or deer urine or how about the same kind of paint they put in the dye packs that they put in money
you make a cute girl you just have to shave a little closer
I usually answer when there guys call, and make then think I’m going along, and then drop it on then that I know what they’re doing.
You didn’t even get the main scammer you just got the mule with glitter…
I love you for doing this. I hate india
So what happens if they send you $50,000 and you just say fuck it looks like I'm $50,000 richer 🤣🤣. Do they still have access to your computer?
Just make them real bombs instead, no more scammer!
Y'all keep up the good work the USA needs y'all brother's
doblu doblu doblu, lol
Bro you are the man.
Rather than a glitter bomb, could you just make it a bomb?
DESTROY ALL SCAMMERS
What kind of software do you use for the voice changer? I want to prank the scammer too
GOOD WORK!!!!
How can I be down with you? I want to be on your team
Shrug
You'd have to be woefully naive to participate in wrapping up money like this.
These are the real heroes ....
love watching these
I guess your video are doing a job on helping the police catch scammers all over the world.
Keep up the good work!! You should do a shyt bomb
Turn to Jesus people he died for your sins, Repent of what the New Testament describes as sin. Believe the gospel obey the teachings of Jesus documented in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Jesus is the only way to be saved, be baptized if you have faith in Jesus then you will live life with him as your example. If you need prayer i'll pray for you. If you want to keep contact with a brother in Christ i’ll keep contact with you. The love of God is beyond our understanding. God bless/./
NOTHING is explained in this video. Not how the scammer gets into his virtual machine, not how he controls their machine.
Damn Vivian, what are you doing tonight?
Always Indians
"Welcome to american express server"  Seems legit
Aren't you Pretty in the Dress and wig   (hahahahha) ..... Thanks for the Great video's
Here in the UK the inland revenue scam is rife. It’s really bad and sloppy so I’m stunned it works on people but that’s a top one here. Also scam emails from PayPal telling me my account is blocked right after I’ve used it. They are not clever but are we stupid?
love you Vivian
Imagine talking to the cops with glitter jeans on
Jim Browning is from N.I where I'm from Ig that's kinda cool
Great work!
If people are this fcking stupid to hide money and ship cash and believe that its a legitimate return.  Id say thats natural selection and some darwinism sht in real life.
Awesome! Well done.
I am ashamed to say I fell for this once.  Never again.  Thank you for helping to keeping these guys out of our pocketbooks!  You are awesome, and dressing up like a lady made me laugh!  I already subscribe to Mark, added you and looking for Jim!
👍
your awesome.. i downloaded software from a link on youtube and it got me hardcore.. thats speaking lightly on how i got hit
I feel bad for bystanders at the airport when you guys decide going to India is ideal lol
Nice flex
MORE GLITTER BOMBS!
your amazing
Sussy baka
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
Thanks bro, I will share to all
Pierogi the cyber cop and vigilante!
This is simply amazing. Thank you for your work.
Great work. Glitter bombs should be filled with OC spray and red dye like banks use. Or just ship them a Honey Badger 😁
Why blur their face?
Go get them one at a time
Sadly I've been nailed with the Microsoft scam... almost twice until they called me back and didn't say who they were huge "RED FLAG" so I canceled the C.C. and boy were they pissed.. lmao
Wow. Great job
There is one more thing you can send to them  is it has beautiful rotten nasty chitlins 🐷 yes pig intestines when they go bad they really go bad 🤣🤣🤣🤮🤮🤮 keep up the good work ⁉️
Massive Glitterbomb shipping to India, financed by authorities, giving all of these scammers goosebumps, hoping NOT to hit Rober, Scambaiter or you while calling potential victims would be nice.
This was epic.
It’s happening bad in Colorado, using all sort of different paths to try and take your money
Awesome - keep doing what you're doing! Stay well🙂
Pierogi's is one of my favorite dishes, and it is Polish. Are you Polish ?
Most of the scam calls I get are from "Windows Technical Support" saying I have a virus on my computer. I try to string them along for as long as possible (if they're wasting time on me, they're not hassling some poor pensioner), like when they ask what type of computer I have I say its a Cray 5000 (gene sequencing computers used in the Jurassic Park novel)...its surprising how often they DON'T immediately hang up when I tell them I'm sequencing T-Rex DNA... I never actually turn on any of my computers or anything. I just tell them I have...I pretend I downloaded the software and such but I haven't really. Its fun hearing them get more and more frustrated.
Happening in Australia as well , waiting for there next call hehehe I will drag the call out for as long as I can and waste there time 🤣😂
The glitter bomb is soooooo satisfying!!
This is one of the most satisfying videos I’ve ever seen
God Bless you .
Someone please explain to me why the face of the scammer that got sent the GLITTER BOMB is blurred but no one else's?
NICE JOB.  AND FUNNY.
good job catching one of the middle men, I hope authorities will stop focusing on people buying weed and start focusing on people scamming our grandparents out of money.
I want a VIVIAN ROGERS CALENDAR!!! GREAT WAY TO RAISE MONEY
You arw a hero
Those glittery pants 😂🤣
They should create a scam box that screams really loud when they open it... And it won't stop screaming until it's destroyed...
So did they get caught?
+1 for India trip!!!!  Epic travelogue! With glitterbombs!
You my friend are an American Heroe!!!!!! Thank sir for all that you do
so much money in the End of the world savings
This happened to my mother a year ago, The scammer used one of her cousins profile on Messenger and convinced her to send $3000 cash to an address in California we reported it to law-enforcement but she never got her money back🤬🤬🤬 Thank you for what you’re doing🙏🏻
Woooooooooo. Team work makes the dream work wooooooooo
Some of that glitter bomb is stuck in your hair, bud.
Keep up the work would like to be apart of your team!!
Thank you for what you do these scammers need to be stopped I've lost my entire savings account because of these scammers they need to be shut down
Hahahaha 😂🤣😂 that’ll probably teach her
Honestly i love what you do i mean i just started watching your videos like on Tuesday and im already blown away, the amount of time and work that you put in to help people that you probably dont even know who are getting scammed it…it, there are no words i wish there were more people like you out there and i hope that one day the right people will see these videos and offer you a bigger pool of resources to help take more scammers down and put more of them away. Thank you for all that you do.
What if when you were supposed to put a certain amount then they change it, you just spammed a bunch of numbers??? like what do they do tell u to do
Nice job👌💯
Why would you put this fart spraying, screaming, flashing and glitter flinging masterpiece in your car when you’ve activated it? Scammers are not clever…
Help ....... Ayyyyyy ... Give then the Chancla .....
9:35 XDDDDD
I actually genuinely feel bad for the guy crying, because he probably gets paid hourly and knows he messed up enough to get killed, literally.
You're doing great job but why you not showing them faces. These people's face should be shown so that they have embarrassment infront of community.
I was scammed once. Thankfully it was only for a couple hundred dollars, but it was the fear tactics that he was successfully able to use on me that still bothers me.  Side note: how the hell did they think they were convincing a mother they were her son? Her son with a bizarre accent?
Bruh… Pearland?????? Dude im 20min from pearland… its scary knowing they are so close to home….. ugh… my family and I cuss out the scammers all the time btw lol
Jeah i like to support a good guys or fighters... Youre a good man, you literally saved lives. I think this is an important fight and i support this.
This is the most epic teamup ever
Dude, you are fuckin Amazing.... Keep up the good work 👍👍👍
Thx si much for doing this for the benefit of all.
nice, now instead of glitter being thrown, wire it up to explosives
Yea my mom gets calls from them and they wont stop calling
Dude I hate to sound corny but u one awesome dude to be helping people like that is pretty amazing keep up the good work
You make a cute woman
You went through a lot of trouble just to have an excuse to dress like a woman.
Thanks you guys, all of you, Peirogi and everyone, for trying to help people who are so readily scammed, especially seniors who seem to be the easiest to take. I'm a senior and don't fall for any of these types of scams, but I see how my peers let there guard down. To me they are absurdly ridiculous, guys with Indian accents and Anglo-Saxon names, or emails claiming you ordered something or renewed a subscription, with return email addresses that are gibberish. Still, it happens, and I loved the glitter-bomb payback. I'd like to try something like that myself, but probably the best I could do is mail them monopoly money or cut-up& wrapped newspapers hidden by fake $3 bills, or maybe some already used up gift cards. Now would that be mail fraud?
I can't imagine cleaning up all that glitter. 30 years ago my young daughters loved it. Being an old fart, it drove me nuts!!!  That's a brilliant idea. Would be easier to move than clean it all. This guy is way above my skill set. Very satisfying to see someone pay. Well done
I'm glad someone is doing something I got scamm with 40k with a fake cripto scamm
Wish I knew how to do this. Great job
we need more of this,more people to stand up. Thank you so much you guys.
\
I don’t understand why you blur these animals’ faces. You’re upset the police do NOT do anything (even with bird in hand), but you refuse to stigmatize these bad guys…  Ok, the law isn’t working, so imagine a whole community that refuses service (no groceries, no banking, etc) simply because you ousted them.  Oust the criminals!!
I got a scammer from he says Amazon he is supposed to call me back at 5 tonight with 1200 dollar phone purchase from Amazon I was totally going on with it what should I do when he calls back I'm trying to give them a hard time
covered in glitter, covered in fart spray, and arrested hopefully. amazing
Be nice to have an update on this scammer.
Well done, it's a shame that scammers can't be marked  for life
Love You Pierogi xD
THIS GUY DOES NOTHING BUT PLAY GAMES, WHY DON'T YOU STOP THEM, AND GO AFTER THEM INSTEAD. WASTE OF TIME THESE VIDS.
Good job man!
Periogi’s makeup is on point!   But seriously , I just found your channel and I love your content !
Amazing job you do mate! I am however blown away by how many people fall for these scams!
Amazing work, great entertainment while doing good things.  Glad to help contribute
So something that I'm taking notice on, on all your videos, that when they do the "refund", I notice that they say that too much money got "returned". Is this real money that you are stealing from their accounts or is it just mimic from the website that you created or? I just want to know that part?
We are very grateful for your words of wisdom and actions.
I wish they would send $5000 to my bank account.  I’ll just go the bank, take the money out and close the account.  And tell them sayonara sucka 😂
You are such an incredible human being.  It is so inspiring to find such a caring, wonderful man.  Thank you for helping so many people find justice
so what happened to the chick
FBI don’t give 2 shits about us or they would do something
I SOOOO wish I could do this to scammers.  Very intelligent and capable people here.
Why India do nothing to stop these serious masive crime.. Why you and few other like you must do FBI job to stop them.. Same is in my corrupted EU country..nothing works, nobody protect simple people..
Vivian is beautiful.  is she single?  i want to take her out on a date
Hey man, just wanted to say I love what you're doing and keep up the work you're doing! Justice needs to be served to these people and you're the role model everyone needs to follow to make it go big! :)
People must be aware, that any of these companies will give you a call. I block right the way if I do receive one.
My god I laughed so hard at this one
That’s crazy, I live in pearland tx.
Holy shit! That was in my city so thanks for showing that scum a lesson.
why hide the face? fuck them, make em famous
Glider box, how satisfying! Thank you for doing what you do 🙏
Love the work you do brother! Gotta get some of those glitter bombs to use!🤟🏼
Hey dude love the channel! Was wondering with the glitterbombs, isn’t there small audio or tacking devices that could be placed in them that when they explode it would land somewhere in the car which they might not see or find due to everything else going on… that way once the box has been dump then this device could still potentially be in the car.
How can I get in touch with you need your help potentially
YES!!! LOVE IT!!! Been waiting for one if his bombs to go out to these scammers
Amazing work mate , more power to you .🤙🏽
OMG. First time i see Viviane. She looks good. ;-) Nice work guys. thanks
Awesome... Let them burn
Do these scammers actually sometimes succeed in getting old ladies to run around town withdrawing huge amounts from their bank and then packaging it up and mailing it?  All under the guise that they're helping an Indian guy from getting fired from his job for screwing up a transfer amount?  This shit really works for them? Really??
With all of the govt's money and people they can't get the job done, yet this man and a few friends are taking the scumbags down. Thanks for what you are doing.
Nice job man. Keep up the great work.
When I am wrapping stacks of cash with aluminum foil. I would question myself, could this be a scam?
I love all these obviously fake "American" names, not Raj or whatever lol
I don't give scammers a chance to get my info like bank account n so on. Tell scammers you a broke ass n after paying bills you got just enough money for groceries that'll deter them
Progee I have had people send me a Apple watch to send to them in Nigeria to sell n I call local sheriff office n had take the watch as evidence n the scammer told me to uh take it back from the authorities I told them f@#$ off I doing it  Before I had a woman claiming to be stuck n she told she'd send me an iPhone to send to her for selling I did similar thing with the phone but the feds was involved with it apparently there were supposed to apple giftcards with this phone I knew nothing about the cards n told the person do not send anything to send to them I wanted no part of it n the threatened me saying they would send Marines to my address to kick my ass cause they thought they was important that reported to the FBI the very next day I'm done receiving any electronic items I didn't order nor will I receive it to send to someone else  Next I'll just call the cops n let them deal with it
thanks man, go get them all!!!
Legend brother
Put a small hidden camera in the box next time. Let’s catch them all.
The police are to busy arresting people for having small piece of a plant on them. Heaven for bid we actually do something to help actual victims.
Thank you and yours! Grate work! From a mainframe computer dinosaur (lunch cards & COBOL). Keep up the great work, you are an altruist.
I got a call from one of these guys once. I knew immediately it was some sort of scam because the guy sounded Indian. The scam was something about drugs and my passport, I don't remember the details. At some point in the call he transferred me to "local" law enforcement which was another Indian guy. I might have made some comments about Covid and the hope that Russia rains hell on that part of the world; this was before Ukraine mind you. Now it's just fun watching someone else take the fight to those bastards.
4:03... I can't believe Skateboarding Legend Stevie Williams is trying to scam people...
thanks for all you do
“Preseed” 7:15
Sometimes I feel like this guy is fake, the person calling always sounds the same
Nice! Popo got the scammer, freekin awesome!
"I love you"😩😂😂
Good work bro. I fully support what you are doing. The only problem is this isn't even the tip of the iceberg. You need more funding and more support. Keep fighting the good fight.
You should show the face of the one who picked up the package too so people know who they are to stop her from doing it again
Made my eyes water. Thank you
Every time I clean out my cookies, I see popular channels.  You are so cool, man--thanks for the fight.  I'm sharp, but one day I'll succumb to Parkinson's Disease (everyone on a parent's side gets it); then I'll be the vulnerable.  I wish you wipe these guys out after you finish making the videos ;)
Thank u
Awesome dude!!
Amazing amazing work!! Can’t say thank you enough !
i love you guys
I would spend alot of money if any foolish scammers would pull my company's name into their shit... I would do what I can to set an example like literally wasting every single employee's life there without a single piecw of regret.   These emails looking so real that I doubt alot of people fall into that (I dont... I know how to check a sender-domain xD) and they probably dont even know what happenend after that if you're still sure that indian-accent "Amazon-Staff" was real.   These people dont buy on Amazon until someone told them that these scammers are not from that company but how if you generally dont really care for the Internet beside ordering some Hobby-Equipment or whatever aged people surfing about. You probably just get scammed and think "alright, im done with the internet" (or amazon)...  Even if there will come more because not even Amazon could prevent that but I just couldnt ignore that business-damaging bullshit from uneducated motherfuckers, who're wearing gold shit while working in a call-centre in any country. 🤢 Prison only is way too friendly... I would throw them into Guantanamo.   How much shit has to go wrong in your life to become a scammer? Did someone abuse them and they're now like "I give a fuck who I hurt man - as same as no1 gave a fuck about me!" or what's their freaking excuse? 🤨  I wish I could fully exterminate all scammers by just one snap... I wouoldnt regret it a single second. I dont even consider these morons as humans because humans are evolutionary & sensitive lifebeings. Scammers dont evolve, educate or learn and they're obviously not sensitive at all... They're like sewer rats. 🤢
She bout to go to jail smelling like doo doo! 😩 🤣
LETS GOOO! Wish we could keep sending them these
Great Job
You are a great guy
You guys are the best!!!!!
I would have put dog s*** in it.
👍
Good job and all, but… I’m sorry… these scams are so bizarre! How do people fall for this? Money wrapped in aluminum sent to some random address? Really?
I was almost scammed with a job opportunity. I realized it 12 hours before my "interview", where I would've given my SSN and bank info. So close!! I'm glad I discovered the scam, but also felt foolish that I'd even be that easy to scam 🤦🏽‍♀️
thank you if  i can help let know
Great job. Keep up the good work.
12:35 even though her face is censored, a reflection on the car tells us everything 😆
Scammer: Crying*  also 1 sec later still sniffling "cann-n you please ggive me your iinfo"
You should put an auto dialer on the phones to automatically relay the GPS coordinates to the cops.
Thank you for what you are doing. There are millions of people being scammer everyday. Young and especially the elderly are being scammer out of their life savings.
why cover the face of that animal!?
You've probably saved my grandma.
Bro., congratulations!!!!
You are AWESOME!  Thank God someone is watching out for these poor people!  LOVE, LOVE the glitterbomb!
WTG!!!!
Why blur the mule.... She was in on it, show the face, destroy the network.
Dude I volunteer to be your bodyguard/security in India. Let's go!!!
Pierogi is a Polish dish
So awesome to see these criminals get caught 🥳
Use green dye, wont wash off for 6m weeks. Malachite green is stronger than methylene blue, used to control parasites.
A money mule in oz  got a year in prison for $600 he got for stealing $60000 !   So money Fools ask your selves if its worth it.
It's simple if they have an eastern accent hang up! That's 90% of the scammers! Mike Hawk....lol
HA HA when the cops showed up!
I'll go with you to India if you need security 👊🏻💪🏻 this is a great cause brother
The cop probably walked up and thought she shit herself 😂 the liquid ass spray never gets old. Great job bro
I was thinking that instead of glitter you could put cat urine in the glitter bomb. It’s so hard to get out of upholstery and clothing basically have to throw it away.
I hope you can get a shit ton of scammers arrested.
Screw glitter... I'd send an actual b*mb in the mail.
Keep up the great work!
They need to go to jail for a long time!!
I love it keep up the good work
You do outstanding, amazing, excellent good work for others. Thank you for being one of the few people to stand up to scammers like this and educate the public to be cautious.
You are awesome! And so is Mark Rober. Love what you guys are doing.
The crying made me cringe
How can we help?
your the best man
ain't no way this girl tryna film a tiktok of a glitterbomb package she thought was something else after stealing it  💀
I wish I had extra money to be able to have a 1-1 call with you. My grandma was scammed and she lost everything. Not just financially, but her mental health has gone down hill so much since she found out. These jerks are ruining lives.
This is great! Thanks for your hard work and knowledge!
I remember watching one of these and perogie asked to be transferred to someone else, and the scammer was all like "let me transfer you to the Department department". It seems that everything has a department.
Bro you look like it Elon musk and Ninja had a baby
wow
.                            👽 If you don't know the caller don't answer the phone, never reply. Contact your bank "directly".
hi just simple question r your parents r from Poland cos of pierogi ^^
can you help me?!?!?!?!?
No need to go to India, just go to eBay.
You guys are BEYOND AWESOME!!!!! 💖💖💖💖💖💖🎇 BOOM! 💖💖💖💖💖💖 😁
Ive seen all glitter bomb videos and builds. And seeing scams shutdowns here just the best.
God bless you guys
14:10 ur the first american ive heard say you all instead of yall
WHY ISNT THE INDIAN GOVT STEPPING IN? We should be sending in mercenaries to dismantle these centres
I wish I could be a part of getting to these scammers! I love computers, and even had a scammer try to get to me a few years ago. I deleted them and cleaned my computer.
I LOVE YOU MAN!!
You will NEVER receive scam calls if you never answer to an unknown number....simple
the very next day after I watches this video my friend and I where talking, and as we where on the phone her grampa got this scam!!! I'm so so happy I watched this when I did so I was able to give her the heads up.   Also could you do a video on how to clean up your computer after the scammer gets in? (for cases like my friend where they catch on  before any money is sent. They still has access to the computer and they aren't sure what to do now other then have th ebank lock there account)
So Kolkota is in Texas now?
you should've went with a regular bomb would've been funnier
Where is @plesant green
Great work bro
Well done. I'd love to do this. Can you point me in the right direction to learn or how I can help without my stuff being hacked?
Welcome to India sir, will try to help you out
Keep fighting man, it’s very well appreciated…. Also very entertaining lol.
keep up the great work....
Scammers are Scum.
I love this.   I am so tired of all the scams.  If i can help i will.
This could've been useful to me like 8 years ago. But I got scammed like 3 times in my life and then discover this video important now.
Finally a scammer guess what they stinking deserve thank you for doing what is right and put all of your time and effort into doing so
I wish you would go after the modders on Black Ops 3
This makes me cry to see real justice. Thank you God. I hope and I pray you bless these scam chasers abundantly. Help them to keep bringing justice to the world!!!
Well done keep it up
wasnt she just a money mule tho? xd
this guy kinda look like Cassady Campbell the wangsta from the bay.
Absolutely brilliant payback, please keep it up. I’m in Australia and we all get thousands of calls and texts a year from Indian Scammers and they are unrelenting hungry dogs. 🇦🇺🙏🏽☮️✌🏽
Because  Macaulay Culkin is normally a connoisseur of fart smells?
9:33 Yo, who's this fine milf?
U did this very well  Thanks for doing this And please keep doing
"ooppss, i mistakenly sent you 50,000$  Thug life XD
You guys are awesome,  keep up the good work and never stop pissing these scammers off..🤣🤣
Im going to suggest that my bank use your videos for training. I am on a money mule team that hunts and prosecutes mules
This is a great video, but its kind of concerning how many people see this as  "catching the scammer", the money mules are not the people creating a problem.
OK I HAVE TO ASK... whATS WITH THE BLUE HAIR?, looks like the worlds most annoying Maple Leafs fan
Im new to your magnificent content. Is Pierogi your real name?
Dafür liebe ich Amerika, bei euch ist rechtlich sooo viel mehr möglich als bei uns in Deutschland. Solche Verbrecher hätten nicht nur eine glitterbombe verdient. Generell diese ganzen Telefonbetrüger, die es auf das Geld von armen Rentnern abgesehen haben. Echt traurig, wozu sich manche Menschen herab lassen. Weiter so, hoffe, ihr schafft noch mehr!
Thank you so much for what you do. My mother in law (rip) got call after call from these guys when she lived with us. It was non stop and so annoying! These guys are real make no mistake to people seeing this. I spent hours hanging up her phone and telling her to hang up it was so frustrating . Thank you again I wish there were 1000 of you!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I love the fact that y'all are fighting these scammers back. Im all for it because my grandma was scammed out of 800 dollars one day and I didnt even know it until after the fact she was already scammed. Their scheme was you if you paid them a certain amount of money the government would give her a grant for 80k. It really pissed me off because the police didnt do anything about and I couldn't do anything about it either.
Thank  you, you are needed, I love the glitter bombs, you are doing us a service that our Government should!d be doing to protect us, please keep up the good work, you are appreciated.
You  are no 1 , i started watching you first before the others, you are the best of all of them. what would  be done without you, the Government  are not helping. I have spent hours watching you. I want to let you know you are appreciated, please keep u0 the good work.
That Vivienne, I say....rather!!! Lol Well done Sir, high ✋. I have noticed that during pretend connection to their "bank server", in other words, the command prompt, the line for the amount to be refunded is more often than not, the only line where the "victim" is asked to input data. Of course, this is to shift the blame of the planned amount error onto the victim and get some urgency from them to rectify it. I've rarely seen them being challenged on why that line is the only line. However, I have seen quite recently a video, in which the victim was asked to enter their name and date of birth too in 2 precedent lines, so perhaps now, some victims have challenged them. Keep up the good word. 👍
Perogi, why are people dying their hair now?
Well Done!👌👏👏👏👏👏👍 I devote most of my time messing with this trash in order to waste their time. Finally justice! Orlando, FL😎
For every floor of scammers we need a floor of guys like scammer payback to fight them and stomp them out!
You guys are awesome, thank you for doing what you all do, bless you
Interesting that they don’t know the usps has dogs that specifically sniff packages for money
I had what I thought was a reputable anti virus company through amazon. Tried to cancel it. Finally took my card off amazon so it would not automatically renew, and started getting messages from them that I now have viruses. Bastards.  Nice boobies, Vivian!
Wow he is stealing and have the nerves to cry..
He looks like mac  mier
cool
Man can be elon musks brother
My God you crack me up! Blessings!!
We love you Pierogi <3
Geo express stoughton mass
You guys are my hero! Mad respect!
Hahaha this is great. Send more pranks to these scammers
That was the fakest crying I've ever heard. Also why do they always sound so aggressive. I wouldn't even want to talk to them because it sounds like they're impatiently yelling at me constantly
busted! so satisfying to see
I would like to help
I love the glitter bombs ive seen a few of his videos
Love watching you! Thank you for all that you are doing.
Mark if you do get to read this. Instead of glitter, why not use dye stain. The same they use in banks.
Name ANY group that does a better service for our community than these Scam hackers. You and the friends you work with are salt of the Earth. We Love you. Even in your blond wig lol.
Maybe this is the woman who owned the mail box store who didn't want to help
You are the best guys 👏👏
god you're handsome
One of the major steps missing is educating people how to check for authentic email.  Don't just trust it saying Norton, you have to look at the actual email address.  It's the first easiest step.
These videos are are great. But they would be a lot better without all the virtue signaling.
👍
Love the glitter bomb idea. What a great way to nab the mules.
Ty bro you the man 👏☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️👏👏👏👏👏❤️
I Love you, you look like my son, are super smart and user your powers for good.  My only problem is your videos are very long.  I get sick of the old lady voice  Is that done by you or a computer addition thing? I love the old man voice  Most excellent hair
You are amazing!
Great job 👏 👍 👌
Lol POS scammers
No thank you for all you guys great work!You guys are saving a lot of people. Keep it up and take down all those SOB.
Had someone who had this happen. Said geek squad cleaned his computer and was not free from the scammer. set up his new online and password and then the mouse moved and started to click on his account and bill pay. logged him off and locked it out. like yeah geek squad didn't clean shit bro.
They make other people from their country look so bad , you should check on the face book scams .
Love your videos.   Keep up the work! ❤️❤️😻❤️❤️
bus-voyageur ou taxi the new shypping industrie
I'm from India, and one of these scammers ripped my Dad off to the tune of 3000 USD. I'm sorry some morons from my country are causing the world such a great deal of consternation. So thank you for the good work Pierogi - you're a champion!
keeep on
Yes! 😂😂😂😂😂
I wanna scam the scamer whats there number
Good show  !
If the scammers are in India, why did this girl pick up the package?
Anyone stupid enough to send an Indian a box of Cash and a shoe deserves to lose their money.
Sus asf wearing lipstick and wig.
It is always Indian people
Brilliant
ty
I am a woman that has a mom, and I love her, its shared.
Dubluu dubluu dubluu
God bless you guys. You are all amazing.
You are so amazing thank you for who you are. Honestly I look up to you.
Send them to governments..they are the biggest scammers. Actually legal mafia but you get it
So pointless pixelating the criminal
Your channel & what your doing is amazing!!!
Why blur the faces of the scammers?  People actually go down to their bank, withdraw money, wrap money in aluminum foil, box it all up, throw in a shoe and fedex the whole collection to scammers?  Sounds like a prima facie case for a declaration that someone is non compos mentis.
What a great win, whoo hoo to you and your efforts.
It’s the old lady nails falling off for meeee!!!😂👏🏻😂👏🏻
Great
….so proud of you❤️
If ever I heard this accent from a caller, I will know.
Fckn Amazing Bro!
DAWW PIERO YOU'RE  A CUTE GIRL! FROM ANOTHER GIRL!
Hopefully she rats out whoever she's working for.
Hope you kept their $$$....lol
And Biden just said 100k foreigners coming over here 🤦🏾‍♂️
Thank you for the work you do. Pity the government do little to nothing to stop this from happening. I my self think you should send a caustic bomb and make them suffer
We been dealing with my mother in law being catfished for the last 5 years. Sadly the thing that stopped it was her having a stroke and being in a nursing home now. I bet she sent the so called 4 star general thousands and thousands or dollars. We all tried to tell her it was a scam but she was tricked to being in love with him. Such a sad situation to watch a 80 year old go through that... thank u sir for what u r doin! God bless u.
I was able to protect my mother in law from this scam. As soon as her computer acted up, she hung up and had me go out and look. Yep, scam…woot!
I love fucking with these scammers too especially when they call me about life insurance 🤣🤣
This is what modern day superhero work is like…
Man… you rock 😂😂😂 My heart goes to those innocent hardworking good people who lose their money at the hands of these disgusting scammers who lack morals.
As I’m watching this video I get a scam call.. WTF I can’t believe it. So I wasted 37min with him on the phone till he hang up on me. Made me feel good that I know he won’t be scamming someone for 37min.
How ironic.  For the last 2 days, I've been getting phone calls from a scam number, regarding this particular scam. I'm so glad I invested in a sports whistle. 😆
Shared
At least there is someone who cares about helping with this!!! God forbid the government or president will do anything about it!!! This is also the computer makers and web security makers don't lift a finger to help anyone at all!!!
shes haat
The biggest problem is that the real players are all in India and they don't care air shipping them.  Catching local mules doesn't do much.  And they're already focusing on other methods of getting the money that eliminate the need for mules.
Do they actually gove you 4000 if so ill hang up after
Well done! Are they all from India?
Gonna tell my kids these were the Justice League
WE NEED REAL SKUNK SPRAY IN THE GLITTER BOMB 🙀😁😁
OHHHHHHH MYYYYYY KNEES!!! I HAD BEEN THINKING IT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU GOT TOGETHER WITH MARK ROBER!!! 🙀🙀🙀 U HAVE MADE MY DAY, MY WEEK & MY MONTH!!! ✌😹😆🐾🐾
So proud of you! It's very satisfying to see scammers and thiefs getting exactly what they deserve. Keep up the good work, we need more people like you!!!
Do you send the money back to the victims of the scammers?
Her pants look really good with glitter
"NO MORE WED NESDAY" :D
Glad it was only a glitter one and not something more awful. 🙂
Embarrassing for all Indians man.
Good work, thanks for sharing!
Thank you for all you have done and doing.
We wholeheartedly applaud your efforts! But I’m sorry that there’s only so much humans can do.   We need an intervention.  A global, permanent intervention by One who will squash lawlessness and injustice.  That day is coming.   Daniel 2: 44.  Psalm 37: 10, 11. Sit tight for permanent justice!  🙂
I needed this as I did not know my mother got scammed 19k sadly as well so yeah it a big big issue they call me non stop I just hang up an inform others as well the elder folks I know also
2:24 what video is that clip in?
They should go after scammers with the same effort and devotion as bank robbers, because that’s what they are.
Respect ✊ fr u guys .. come to India, u will hv my full support and assistance. We hv to keep on fighting against these sxammers and save more people. India authorities hv to put an end to this .. this is ruining people’s lives and our country’s name 👊
You're a hero.
Keep up the excellent work!
Amazing!
Pearland isn't that fat from me. Just a few hrs. Glad to see that person getting caught and some. Can't stand stupid people like that. Smh. Keep up the great work catching these dirt bags.
I'm honestly shocked to see that just some guy without a mustache isn't here yet
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you ❤
That's BRILLIANT!
Youre amazing
Come to INDIAN if you have guts in you
Come to Indian please come
Chop bay
Speak up mr
🤣🤣🤣

Why not working for Police and benefit with plus money done by You Tube good organisations like you!
just say no to blue hair
Hahaha, drama king panadol.. Scammers is alive, 🤣🤣🤣🤣
WHY do you blur the faces of the criminals?
that shade you're wearing vivian... i want to get in tween dem lips
They are using the comment section of this video somehow. I got a scam call as soon as this video ended. Saying they were from a tax debt department. Not today scammer!
I love watching you get those scammers, you are a person that we need more of in this world! I wish the best for you and would love to see you going to India!
I just found this channel and dude you’re my hero. Keep up the great work bro       Stay blessed and stay safe to anyone reading this.
I think the best way to identify a scammer is if they say w wrong because so many scammers that are from india do that so if you hear them say w wrong you should keep on checking they aren't scamming you until your 100% sure that the person you are talking to is not a scammer
You need to up your glitterB game and put theft powder in it. That stuff would stain EVERYTHING! Using water would just make it worse.
Your the best mate x
Omg you are awesome.
i loved your work .but you just got the mule..
If they ask me if I have chrome i’d be like no. When they clearly see it 🤣 and act stupid that i duno how to use a computer and see if they walk me through it but id keep lying and say i dont see it haha
Excellent work my friend! Thank you for what you are doing. Keep it up!!
The reson there is a phone is is rec her self opening to prove
You are a heroe. Thank you so much !
You got the middle person at least haha
Thanks for doing what you are doing man, its not good to steal hard earned money specially from old and elderly people who are not up to date with technology or how scams work. I am from India as well (i live in US though), this is a sad truth many scams originate from india as well along with some other countries
13:57: The BEST!! 🤣👍🎉
13:09: I think, the countdown should be done with that super-serious voice of space rocket launches.
You can ALWAYS hear, they are from India/Pakistan, once those morons say: "Dobbily, dobbily, dobbily dawt." 🤦‍♂️😖
I love to see you getting payback on dating scammers!
My guy has the biggest 🥎🥎 on YouTube! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
You are my freaking hero.  The government does nothing.
👍👍👍👍👍
Someone has been hacking my cellphones for over 20yrs. Thank God for ppl like you.
This has happened to me when I called from the bank.
The fact that someone could honestly believe that a legitimate business couldn't have money sent to their account directly but instead needs you to wrap it in tin foil, is a scary reality. That is the most bizarre, suspicious request and should set off all sorts of red flags.
When a scammer is gonna call me, ima put “RIP roach” which is a loud song. 👏AND👏I👏WILL👏CALL 👏 THEM👏A👏B***👏BEFORE👏ENDING👏THE👏CALL👏
You are the man.
Keep up the good fight GOD bless
Signs to easily know you’re dealing with a scammer….  1. They’re Indian 2. They call you about money/bank 3. They tell you to log in to your computer  4. They ask for your information   And people still fall for this?😪
Brilliant keep up the good work. 😁😁😁👍👍👍👍👍👍
bravo
I just say NO! Call them liars and and scammers!
Thank you.. hopefully each scammer ends in jail.. one by one.. will be awesome to clean this world from scammers
An True justice for helping the weak that was Trick giving hard earned cash or livelihood. Thank you for making the video and I love your contents. Keep it up!
you are a real soldier of humanity !!!!!!!!
As long as it's an Indian accent... It's a red flag!
Thank you for the work you do!
is this only happening there in America? never heard of this here at all.
their names always kill me. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. such BS like..Peter Smith from Bangladesh. 😂😂😂    or Daniel Wilson from Karachi.. FFS.
You are a hero.
The Key is to use explosives to get a real laugh.
Why do people who are not really computer literate, do their banking online.  Also, when I want a refund, I call my credit card company, not Amazon or Best Buy.
Thank you so much for opening my eyes. I had no idea it was as bad as it is.
You would think less people would fall for this when you get someone with such a thick Indian accent claiming their name is Tommy Whitebread.
I just started to watch your videos. I think you should make a version of this channel into Spanish like other one are making with dude!. I see you from Spain
You got a subscriber .. you are a hero.. keep chasing those scum bags.. hope this people get arrested in India aswell
I love the granny voice so much! :D
Off topic, but I wonder if any of the potential victims ever just said, when advised that they were overpaid,  "Sucks to be you!" and hung up the phone.
I think what you guys are doing is amazing. Someone has to take charge and show these scammers that we are tired and done with their S^^^. So thank you again and Keep it up...
Financial institutions have standard procedures once victims have reported the scams.  Non of which is actually getting the money back for victims. That part is for law enforcement.  Victims feel violated, embarrassed, hopeless, helpless.
Incredible India
Is this a profession? Because if so, I'm VERY interested in being apart of it.
Your mother must be very proud of the kind young man she has raised ,well maybe not when you're wearing the bright red lip stick,,,,,,,,,love your vid's
nice work !
Please come here to India
I still don't understand, no matter how old or non-tech savvy anyone is, HOW can someone fall for these scams?!?!?
Not all heroes wear capes.
Ngl you look pretty lol
👍💪🇺🇸
Your work is so important and entertaining as well....can't stop watching...
Pierogies are you from Pittsburgh by chance? Bc a lot of people don’t even know what pierogies are, especially outside of south west Pennsylvania
wish i could get my money back from a scammer but all well glad there is some justice out in the world to bad im not one of them but ty for what u do.
So they send you $ first? Why can’t you just hang up after they give you the $ and scam them back?
I love YouTube but I hardly ever comment you are my fucking hero this is the greatest thing on YouTube
i'm waiting for the glitter bomb to actually be a bomb
if you are a scammer, i bet you know what to do after this video
u got some nice hair color going on man
I watched and shared a lot of these informative videos of parogies and Jim brownings as well I remember the 1st time my poor grandma opened up a scammer email and the way they treated her was just awful she and many of my other family members and friends have learned so much to keep us safe from these scamming predators because of you guys so for that thank YOU all very very much keep up the great work guys you are the unsung heroes of the world
Yo I live in the town that package thief got pulled over in dayum
Love the hair!!!
Did something ever come out of this? Was she jailed?
Why would you go through all of this and thin hide the scammers face, I wanna see her. I thought this channel and videos were about exposing and stopping the scammers
How did you know that the glitter bomb wasn't going to be sent to someone like Susan, another victim of scammers?   Like an elderly person who's already lost tens of thousands of dollars and is already terrified and harrassed daily by scammers, and now you've sent them a glitter bomb.  I really think you should not have done this. You have no evidence that the person was even directly involved in the scam. You could have just further victimized a scammer's victim.
Ey perogi you ever think of doing drag on the side??? Jus saying 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
There's a lot of these happening in the UK too. Not much gets done to stop it. There is so many vulnerable people in the UK and America. It needs to be stopped. Well done on getting these people who are victims the justice they deserve xx
should have shown her face. she deserves it.
Vivian is creepy lol
Love you so much !!!!  Thank you !!!!!!
Loven on your ma dog
This is the greatest!
You my friend are a legend. If I lived near you, Id come help !
Don't you think the guys in India might actually have a contract out on you  ? 😂😂

BEST ONE YET!!, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE YOUR WORK
Why don't all popular screenshare things just be required to say "hey this is prolly a scam"
U are the best I love watching u get payback on these scumbags lol keep up the great work
Thanks for your service to society 🤗
Pearland, Tx police,  right in my neighborhood.

I love mark rober glitter bombs .I love this collab!these scammers are the worst. I wish there was a way to give them all a glitter bomb cause they steal so much money from innocent unsuspecting victims.
BRAVO!!!
Sending the famous Glitter bomb was awesome.
I love you and that Glitter Bomb guy, too!
this happens rarely that I am not proud of saying that I am an Indian Citizen...sorry to all the victims...
I’m from India, and It’s just so stupid and horrible that such people exist here.  Thanks to you for putting these scams out, I’ll atleast have a proof that such things do happen on the net ( especially to the internet newbies) Thanks man🙌🏼
Yew shur are a purdy lady, sir, uh, ma'am.
Brilliant stuff ya'll.
Jail for life. Never to get out. No tech for them except the chair.
objective truth, objective justice! keep up the good fight.
❤️❤️❤️
May The God bless you and protect you and your friends.
I don't normally watch a lot of these videos. Yet this guy cracks me up I'm addicted!
Need more of these videos!!! You rock!! Love Mark too!
Thank you guys for all you do.
I love what you do. I got an email today from “Amazon” said they was an issue with my credit card. Amazing what these people will do. About a month ago I got a call from renewal of a software protection service. They thought oh were going to get this lady. Thanks to you I knew better and called just to mess with them
Great work!
You guys are awesome.  Keep up the great work!
I love what you are doing... Your passion to fight these criminals is inspiring !!  Keep the content coming... I'll keep watching to the end 🙂
I got a scam call while watching this. Lol
This gave me chills! So grateful for you and your team 💜💜🙏
I love this soooooo much!!!!!!  I hate thieves!!!!
I don't get the part where the box is opened. The left side camera is showing a bed with a pad/phone recording the same thing that is happening as it happens? Is that the woman filming herself to prove to her "colleagues" what was in the package?
Can the methods you use be shared so other people can join in the fight?  Is there a way to rope in some coders or hackers that could create a virus that would take out an entire call centre rather than just an individual's machine?
Got disrupt vibes in the beginning
CHAMPION!!! ✊ Scammers and firebugs can’t stand them
Well done, man. 👏🏼
at first I was like-     is that ninja?!
You are so hilarious!!! 🤣 🤣🤣 It’s awesome what you’re doing ♥️
Love you Perogie, you rock, never stop xxx
You are the master! Thank you for being awesome!!
Unbelievable.  That crying guy was hilarious, pathetic, and evil.
Thank you   Thank you.  Thank you.
You are a real life superhero.👏
Love you Perogi
The scammer has no clue!
I LOVE YOU BRO! GOD BLESS YOU!
Why did you cover her face
Thumbnail looks like a gay guy for thanos snapped.
So, she paid a fine and let go. All that for a fine.
Send them packages of Dollar Tree play money.😅
When the scammer started crying I LOST IT
i WANT TO THANK YOUR PARENTS FOR RAISING AN EXTRAORDINARY AND COMPASSIONATE HUMAN BEING. MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AT ALL TIME............................. AMEN
THANK YOU
I'm so proud of you guys.   /hugs
Thank you so much! :)
Can’t believe people go this far to believe this scam. I don’t even answer my phone to begin with lol 😆
Are indians the most poorer on this planet? Y are all the scammers indians? So sad these guys are putting shame on their flag
YES MORE GLITTER FART BOMBS!!!!!
I’m proud of you guys. ❤️❤️❤️ Thank you for looking out for us.
We all appreciate you guy's 🙏 and thanks for your time and effort, please keep the amazing work you all are doing....bless you brother
I love seeing scammers getting their desserts🥧
Thanks Mark and Jim too. I love the glitter bombs
What would happen if you told them I am keeping your money? Would they hound you or give up?
All that go out and  help the unsuspecting people of these scams. Thank You!!! I had no idea there were so many scammers. You have saved so many from losing life savings. People on a fixed income have hardly any money but these guys scare them into paying. Tragic👍👏👏 Be well and safe  and  make these evil guys pay
Clearly the Indian government is not doing anything about it. It's probably another industry to them.
This blue hair color is GIVING!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Thank you
Your are the real HERO
Thank you for your effort. It's too bad to blur thier faces. As for me the video is not complete. Show thier faces.
Thank you for your effort. It's too bad to blur thier faces. As for me the video is not complete. Show thier faces.
Props to all the scam busters.. keep up the good work.. have y'all come across the publishers clearing house scam?
😂😂😂😂😂
Bro Literally you just made my day!! Really no words....LOVE YOU ❤
You and Vivian have educated me so well that both my hubby and I have thwarted a number of scammers. Texts and e-mails get deleted straight away, and phone calls are met with derisive laughter followed by hanging up.  Thanks for teaching us what to do. It's appreciated more than you know.
I am a police officer in North Carolina. For certain reasons, I do not want to go into too much detail of that on this thread. But if you ever get any leads in the Research Triangle Park area of North Carolina please let me know. I want to help how I can. If you are interested please let me know and I will give you my contact information.
This world needs you sir. Cheers!
I loved this❤️
God Bless you❤!
This is GREAT...!! Thank you!! Not all HEROS wear capes. Sharring!!
It would be funny if you refused to 'hand the money back'
ppl really go all out n do as the scammers say ? w aluminum & so forth?
👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽❤️❤️thank you
Awesome  love it, this is the skammer👨‍💻🕵️‍♂️ this is you 😎👵!!
These guys are the real Avengers. Much respect.
Thanks for all you do. This is awesome.
Keep up the great work against these heartless POS SUM Bags.
I'm glad to see someone who cares,and fight back against these scumbag scammers who take so much $ from innocent people. Thank you for what you do
Wow 🤯. Thanks Pierogi and crew! Thank you for your efforts and videos! 💪🏽🤯📦
Thank you for the great work you do
It is my understanding that the fart spray, included at no extra charge, has an aroma intense enough to remove the enamel from your teeth. Just look at Culkin's reaction. I don't know if glitter bombs are needed, but they do get their point across don't they ?? Thanks Pierogi, for all you do. There should be a bounty on these schmucks, and you should be RICH for exposing them. I love your method of erasing their files. I'd like to know how many of these boiler room operations you have closed. But then again, they'll just pop up elsewhere won't they ??
Wow we need more people like you in the world
U guys are amazing.
A real hero❤️
Would love it if it had nails instead of glitter inside
No, we thank you. Humble respect from France
Yes!!!!
you need to be harder on these guys. if there is a way to remotely brick their computer....that would be awesome.
Thank you for the awesome work you do.
Please come to India ASAP... 👍👍👍
Way to go, love the work you guys do.  Thanks for helping, too complicated for me to even work on PCs like you guys do.
ummm......is Vivian single?........asking for a...um....friend.......
I thought it was racist when they showed the graphic of the beeline shipment to Texas. Why he got to be brown tho? 😅🤣🤣
The geek squad cancellation department? Jesus. Not all hero's wear capes.
Ive been telling everyone on my medias about you so that they can educate their loved ones thanks for caring so much.
I wonder why Biden and NATO not join forces to smash this kind of scheme since they have a lot of knowledge why did not sanction this bunch of idiot scammers country?
Is there anything that we can do as ordinary people?
Please don't blur their faces, they deserve to be exposed.  They deserve the embarrassment.
0:06 is where my local ABC station reporting the scam story!
You guys are awesome
Thank you for all you do.... there should be more people like you in the world.... If I knew how to do this I would.... but I'm more likely the one to be scammed....
Bless all of you, Samaritans
Please don’t cry aka “haha rip bozo”
the dislikes are the scammers.
I love watching is glitter bomb videos when he makes them once a year.
Wow.. your effort is paying off.. good job to everyone who were involved in making this happened.. 🎉🎉🎉👏👏👏
You seem all frustrated that no one is doing anything about this legally . . . then . . . you proceed to shield the identity of the criminal
Our government doesn't give a flying F... about us. Most of them feel that these scumbag scammers are just poor ppl in India trying to feed their families and it's just another way for all of us "rich" Americans to redistribute our wealth to all the poor people around the world. The owners of these scam co. are worth millions. They don't understand that after these scammers steal their victims money their victims become poor and often commit suicide. Call your congressman and demand they do better stopping these scammers. The foreign co. they live in usually wont arrest and prosecute.
That packaging tho. I dunno if these scammers are aware, but I am lazy. They tell me to count equal amounts, put them in envelopes, wrap them in tin foil and post it? I would just hang up and wait for the police to come get me. I don't care 😂😂Ain't nobody got time for that
Why are all scammers Indian😒
God bless you, from Germany. You are incredible!!
In 13:22, look like she might be an Asian
WOW YOU ARE JUST WOW!  THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The name I would give i uvuvwevwevweumwemwemwemweonyeta ossas.
Thanks for your work! Death 2 hackers 👋 bye bye
Thanks!!!
coolest video ever you are the greatest!!!
The part where you said "alright I have to go to the party I'll call you later" when he was crying and wanted you to go to the store straight away was so funny
Epic 😂😂😂👍🏽. Keep up the good work
You should go after the people that be on Snapchat that do the same thing
i had one try to sell me comcast but the second they asked for my ssn i questioned them
I am subscribed and love you for doing this, wish I could help somehow.
Yazzzzzzzirrrrrr.thank u
This is the best blog ever. Thank you for your dedication and service
Hello... I have some questions guys... My friend from Taiwan lost $200 000.00 from guy from Nigeria... they have been talking about investing money in some business in Japan... Is there any way to recall some money..? Or anything to recover at least something?  Money transfers have been made by direct transfer from account to account... The bank is located in US... Please help..? Thanks.
The world needs more good people like you and your team. I especially enjoy when you speak to the scammers in their native language. How did you get so fluent? Your mastery of computer programming needs to be used by sources who actually care about victims who don’t know better. Thanks for your good work. Keep it up. Blessings
Good content, however, you posted to youtube, so I can't thumbs up.  Post to another service.
It would be awesome that you guys do this with the help of Karl Rock too... But unfortunately Karl Rock was Blacklisted by the Indian Government from entering the India... Also Banned. It's kinda disappointment.
Lol
LOLOLOLOL
God bless all of you in doing this good  attitude in helping people and educating  us  to fight and punishing those evil animals(persons)
what if you don't let the scammer put the extra zero by deleting one of the zeros
Avenger assemble!
Thumbs Uppppp
Imagine send Glitter bomb straight to their base of operations in India.
Good man! Thank you for doing this!
Here is the one thing I don't understand. We all now know they are all from India. And when someone calls me and has that accent I laugh. I don't trust anyone who has that accent.
Thank you for doing this......You are awesome...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fart spray glitter bomb next.
I just found your channel. And I gotta say. I 🤬 LOVE YOU 😂😂🤣 Im 55 years old. Haven't been scammed yet. But have had the calls. I just ignore them. Now I wanna  answer  & have some fun too.
why not show the scammers faces ?
Was she arrested?
Go to indian, take them down.  I love what you do.
I wish the scammers & mules didn’t get their faces censored, they should be publically shamed.
I hate scammers. Had one tell me that my I.d. was used in another state. That I could go to jail. I laughed and said that you don't even know my name. He got so pissed and kept saying I'll go to jail. I kept laughing and he hung up
Thumbs UPPPPP
Godbless you🥰
Jim is best. You not bad to
Why was their identity concealed?🤔
Not a good idea to go to India since they know you, the police are paid to look to the other way because they are harming foreigners, not people within India, secondly, the amount of money they have scammed, their payouts can be so high it goes to someone who is in the higher command of the public  security sector.
I love this so much!! Great work, man! I’m gonna go subscribe now.
nightmare on scammer street  rrrrrahrrrrrrrrrrrr
GOOD WORK SIR! THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DO!!!!
Make 1 with a hand grenade in it and I'm interested.
The Home Alone thing 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. Keep the change, you filthy animal.
Please kill the scammers right now..
Much love for you from India. These pathetic scammers are a disgrace to our country.
🥰
anyone else gunna ingore the fact he made 50k in 10 mins
Arent those people like the middle mans??
Man, I wish you didn't have to blur these scumbags' faces. The world needs to know who these crooks are.
U r a hero to us! I'm deaf ...don't mind my English structures cause sign language have little bit different sentence structures , but yea I got hacked and stolen a hundred bucks by Thur fake Amazon with seller called red crane store for a dragon chess, beautiful design 😩 lesson learned  gotta read carefully and check it first. Superb video!
can interpole police get involved
About five years ago I got scammed and lost over $1,000. I'm usually not so gullible but the scam showed a Microsoft logo and my computer had shut down so I thought it was valid. I learned  my lesson big time and they've called me back for years saying their company went out of business and they legally have to refund my money if I'll just go to my computer again. Ha, Ha. A thousand dollars was an expensive lesson and I certainly didn't need to learn it twice! So I love watching these videos and when files are deleted, I always imagine that maybe one of them is mine. Keep up your great work smashing these B@$t3rds! They deserve everything and so much more than what you give them!
if you got all the pc talent and directed them at these dogs, wtf would happen ? Well done young man and company.
I know you probably get a lot of these comments but truly you are a hero
You are the most wonderful and coolest person to ever exist ❤
The only thing i know how to avoid a scammer is hear them like an indian man
why hide their face, they are a criminal
@Whoop!!!
These scammers are such pathetic individuals. Make them squirt those tears
i love scam calls. i always ask them whats their favorite pokemon. some times they will even sing with me. i love them ^^
I love your passion, drive, and determination. You are a truly good man.
Can I work for you guys I will definitely get payback on theses scammers
I just want to thank you for your yt videos. Just this past month I 've been called, texted and emailed by scammers. I was aware of the possibility of these scammers thanks to you. Texts and emails were blocked and deleted. I took an insurance call and as it progressed I realized that they were fishing for personal info. I got them to email an application instead of giving info on phone. I blocked phone number and spammed the email. I kept original email to send to State of Texas Attorney General's office etc. Long story short thank you for your videos. Being informed is the best defense.
You enjoyed that lipstick way too much. Just saying.
Why is the scammer's face covered? Everyone should know what she did.
LOL  LETS FUCKING GO DUDE!
Amazing 🙏🏽
Mark and Perogi. 2 of my favs.
She put it in her car....ugh.
You are amazing! You are a hero!. Maybe in real life we cant see a batman or superman but you are the closest to it.
GOD BLESS YOU SR
Awesome work ♥️🇨🇦🌏
It reminds of exploding dye packs when a bank robber gets caught except this guy is covered in glitter and farts.
The scammer is having an emotional damage breakdown
Love it! Let's get some more of this!!!
"Model minority" right there folks.
I got a scam email where they were posing as the Geek Squad from Best Buy. The email said they were going to withdraw $399.99 from my bank account to renew my subscription. I have NEVER had a Geek Squad subscription. They told me if I didn't call them they would withdraw the money the next business day. It also had a pdf file attached to it. The scary thing is that they had my home address but not my name. I deleted the email and went on with my life. I am so glad there are people like you taking on these horrible people.
Thank you for making us aware of scammers, for the laughs, and for helping so many people.
keep these people at bay or in jail
Indian Parjeets fails at their best...🤣🤣🤣
Thank you for fighting for the victims!!!
Police only serve rich people and corporations. When the scammers start stealing from Bezos the cops will care. Til then we have you and trilogy media and the like. Thank you for trying.
Pierogi: My legs are hurting. Are you crying? Scammer: Yes, I'm crying because you haven't sent the pkg. Me: rolling my eyes. This guy's got the empathy of a doorknob.
Lol Progy
Scammer are good actors... They could win Oscar✌️👏👏😁😁😁😂😂😂😂
you guys are awsome
Need a tracking device in those boxes
Pierogi this could all be avoided if people just learn to never do business online or electronically, we didn't need that 20 years ago and things don't have to be that way today
I'm dying!!!!!! HAHAHA that dress, lipstick,  wig. You went all out.... as serious as this is you are funny as hell
Lmfao granny singing post Malone.....damn that's priceless
Great job dude 👏
Thank you so much
I LOVE THIS CHANNEL!!!! Bro sippin on scammer tears that’s crazy, keep it up!!
Nice. Keep up the good work guys.
😻😻😻😻😻💕💕💕👍👍👍👍
If it were me I'd wire 911 into the call
I remember about half a year ago, my grandfather got a phone call saying that 800$ was taken off his card for an iphone, At the time i didnt know what was going on, instead of calling the scammers, i called amazon themselves and they said no money was taken out, a month later it happen again, i called the scammers instead this time and i heard an indian voice, told my grandfather not to transfer any money for anyone because it was a scam. And just like that, he is living life happily without scams because we no longer get these calls. THANK YOU FOR SHUTTING THESE SCAMMERS DOWN!
First of all i dont trust any indian callers,
This is why I support. Amazing work and also Mark Rober is an absolute genius.  Thank you.
I watch everything you make and tell everyone about you. Passin on the word man, keep doin your thing. Love to ya
I thought I was disgusted by roaches this Indian scammers beat my roach fear.
hahaha... you should go platinum blonde, it looks awesome on you :) <3 this is an awesome channel! So glad I found you!!! <3
👍bro ..keeps it up
It's nice to see one of the rare moments when someone involved in a scam actually gets caught. Keep up the good work.
It would be nice to see an entire team of hundreds of these anti-scammers working together to destroy as many of these scam centers as possible. There are a lot of very smart computer folks out there. It would be fun to watch.
it's such an american thing to just go for the mules and other victims - who are probably being extorted to do this anyways. Instead for going to the one actually up top and living a luxury life somewhere.
My only request would be to change out the glitter with some good ol' C4
You are a hero, thank you
You are all awesome people!! These videos give a feeling of satisfaction.
You glitter bombed a mule. How can you get the main person behind it? They all report to someone. How do you get that person, the boss, the person pulling the stings and hiring these people to run these scams?
I had a coworker post a Facebook scam.  Pointed it out and asked if they would please delete it.  They deleted my comment instead.
I was scammed out of $1400.00 in ebay gift cards trying to purchase a tahoe to fit all my foster kids,  is there a way to track where they were used and who used them?, its not so much the money i lost anymore it finding the scammer and helping others from becoming victims, i still have the gift cards, the gift card numbers where added to a email account,  I APPRECIATE ALL YOU GUYS FOR ALL YOU DO TO HELP SAVE PEOPLE FROM BEING SCAMMED,
thank you , my wife and I am so grateful. mayGod protect you always.
Total respect to you from the UK
Respect !!!!   It’s happening in Australia too … Thankyou to all 3 of you guys 🙏🏽
That fart spray going off multiple times is simply hilarious
Boohooohooo 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dublu Dublu Dublu dot... 😂
My grandmother just went through this and they stole over 1,500 dollars from her cuz I wasn't there to stop it its insane as to what this world has come to.. your videos have helped a lot
you are my new hero.
oooo Vivian makes a better scammer harasser.
oooo please I didnt raise you this way ooo my god I couldn't have come up with a better one perfect!!!!
I love you and all your machines and I'm a heterosexual male.
This is awesome and great idea to team up with Mark Rober. Thank you for your service sir
Can you add some TNT to those traps?
You should be proud , someone who uses they skills to help anyone in trouble is a hero. Well done guys.😃
I can’t believe you protected that bitches face is criminal man put her face out there why would you hide her face I think it was an Asian lady right far from right I think that was her and she played the victim as usual
Why hide her face though?
This is great! Thank you sir for all that you do
I dont worry i dont have a computer or bank account or checking account
Put bank dye packs in the boxes
Much respect, bro! Rock, rock on.....
Dude you are the MAN.!!!... I wish you could put all of them scammers computers on Fire with some kind of software!!!!
Far more valuable you are here, India - NO & don't forget I didn't raise you that way!
And the Academy Awards goes to...
Mark Rober is the goat
Amazing work keep it up guys. God bless
You are still my hero. Love you so much. For being such a great friend.
These scammers give me such second hand embarrassment
The 3 amigos!!!! Keep it up.
This guy is awesome
show the faces of money muels. they need to be exposed and humiliated until death
Are you Canadian?
Hey pierogi I'm asking for maybe a little help I think I have been scammed and looking to get just a little payback I would appreciate it if you can help.
I was just wondering how they changed the amount without an actual transfer of money and got me scared, But just today I found out it was through the developer option's of the web page ... hahahaha
Cops are too busy beating black people to investigate actual crimes i guess
Scammers got my 74 year old dad for $500. Which was a lot of money for him. It was terrifying for him. Threatened him with jail and wouldn’t let him hang up…
I would subscribe if you could find a way to glitter bomb every scammer you cross
This was awesome
A glitterbomb is a surprise "party" in a box
AWESOME!!!
Phone Rings, Caller ID is Apple, number is my work number...  Me: Hello? Caller;  Apple Computer, can I help you? Me:  you called me Caller:  **click**
Thank you guys for all you do! ❤️
Just always be careful when you and your friends go after these scammers Pierogi. We don't want to lose any of you in your good deeds to helping others. God bless you
wish you would haveshowed their face though
Freakin' wake up! lol
But also for them to have no heart or thoughts of the hardworking ppl they steal from is a scam bag thing to do I'd love to see one face to face I'm quick with my words lol
You do you! Fukk them
I think your next one should have ink or stain that glows in the dark and has to wear off not washed off. The stink spray should be stronger, these punks don't seem to mind smelling farts. I love your videos. I laugh and laugh!
If I had the money, I would support you as well. But you will have to do with "thank you for everything you guys do!" All the victims you helped and will help. All the scammers you exposed and turned their own tricks  against them. Maybe you even accomplished that one or the other stopped their criminal activities. Again, from the bottom of my heart; thank you!!
Loved it lol 😆
Uhm... why does anyone send cash in a box to someone? Not one company that is legit would ever do that! Sorry, but you have to throw out your common sense before doing something like that. Western Union is already obvious, but cash in a box?  Thanks for your videos though!
04:00 until 04:07 is just cold
Totally thank you!!! It sickens me listening to these thief’s! next scam call I get might take away some time for them! Lol they sure get pissy when you do though!
I give no f's when this was made. You're a hot Vivian. Lol. Keep up the good work Love your channel
You guys ROCK glittery 🌟... thank u!  I was a victim. They got me with Walmart gift card ..but I got wise went to my bank and told them wat was happening and the Manager of my credit union was on it, she stopped further funds from being taken. I had to get a loan to pay back the money they did get from gift cards, but it could of been way worse.  They tried relentlessly to get me again abd again. I was really fearful so I went to the Police department and told them ALSO.  It was a very devastating ordeal.  I loathe these scammers.. pathetic losers!
Hope u get paid somehow 4 wat u do
Thank you for what you do! It has helped so many people, I also love to watch your videos, it is so satisfying to see the scammers lose!
Excellent work what a great guy.
I was shocked when I saw the Pearland Police officer pull up. One of my best friends lived there and ended up committing suicide. Made me happy to see that, as it felt like a reminder from him that I’m on the correct career path, as I’m in Cybersecurity currently to help take bad people down. Thank you so much.
I wonder if Hollywood is interested on making a film about scammer payback!
What happens if u say I don't wanna cancel but u also won't do anything? XD
I can't believe anyone with any amount of common sense would fall for this.
Hopefully one day the Indian journey begins once the pandemic restrictions get lifted. Let's bring this war against scammers right close to their home.
I REALLY LOVE THIS YOU SHOULD HELP US WITH ALL THESE SCAMMERS IN ATLANTA
Thanks for doing this.  I was scammed also and lost $800.  I don’t trust anyone on the phone now and learned a lesson on scammers.  Im really happy your doing this, the problem is that I trusted too much and believed what that said.  They target the older people because our brains aren’t all there as we get older.  My scam was on Instagram where I was following a well know star and they said they started a new charity and if I wanted to donate.  I should have checked to see if their was actually this charity.
I think I want to marry Vivian. 😍😍😍
kinda sucks how all you could do was catch one woman. hope she leads to more.
why do you blur the face? that makes no sense what so ever, who are these people? they don't deserve anonymity.
why is argentina where the nazis went .. is that where the grossest most vile and disgusting nazis live???
I wonder what happens if you type the number accurately and press enter before they can add an extra number
WE LOVE YOU❤❤❤❤❤❤💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯 GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
Peirogi looks cuter in granny's outfit 😂😂😂😂😂
Wish we could have seen the scammers face
You go to India I will personally get you housing and food as long as I get to go with you guys to take them down.
Keep it up. We all loving it. I do wonder. Why don't my taxes go straight this?
This looks like a long trailer for a movie
"this is freaking happenning WAKE UP GOVERNMENT" wow man chill
that's one long intro
Thank u guys for having these ppl arrested an putting these ppl out of business
I have never seen such a sexyier man in a dress an wig blah hahaha 😆 😅 😂 🤣 🙃
The government doesn't protect us from these scammers from India, and Nigeria. It's like they have freedom to scam Americans all day long. These countries have a content career in doing this...  Like you said... the American government needs to wake up and pass some policies on this crime against us...
When you track the package if shipped in the US or even overseas if you have connections how do you determine if the recipient is a mule or a victim as well like the woman in San Diego?  Keep up the great work my friend.
keep it up , love the videos
Why blur these scammers faces???
I have received emails for invoices of things that I was supposed to have bought from eBay, PayPal, and Amazon for as much as $999.  I check my accounts, to see if anything of that amount has been put on my accounts, I and it always is not. I don’t have Internet and all I have is my iPhone.  Is there any danger of them hacking my iPhone? I have tried blocking the senders, so they can’t continue.  Will that help?  Any input would be appreciated.  Thank you 😊
May God bless you and your loved ones, you are amazing 🙏🙏🙏
Well if you need a muscle dummy to go to India with you I’m your guy
Hi bro guess what so one time the phone rang and I said hi this dominion power something about money my dad said scammer and the person hung up
Exsplosive glitter bomb would be very effective 1-2 kilos of heksatolpentrite and booom!!! No more those n...r scammers 😂
LOL!!! "Stop crying, go get a napkin." LOL😂
The one who opened the glitter box, isn't that just a courier who confirms they received the package by recording the opening?
Wow! i love this!
dude we need more of theseeeee
The FBI needs to recruit this guy, so that he can assemble a anti-scam task force.
Awesome work . Now let's catch the whole group while their on the phone scamming.  You guys are the best. Our country is being attacked economically by people from other countries.  Love your work ,keep going at it.👍👍👍👍👍.
When he started singing congratulations! 😂💀
Well Done,
Bad MOFO  Thanks for the content
3:30 "dablu dablu dablu" 🤣🤣
Wth why does he cry that way
You are so amazing ! Thank you !
Vivian lookin kinda cute ☺️
👍👍🌹👍👍
👍👍🌹👍👍
Thank you for what you do.
your work is amazing, thank you :)
Imagine. We could still be watching / supporting A&E or lifetime. Who takes our money and spends it grooming  minors or adding to the corruption  in the world. Atleast wuth youtube we can support good people who want help the world with the support of millions not let everyone down..
THATS AWSOME!  :)     Thank you guys!
It would be great to fully expose them by not blocking out there face .. Some people may think you have to have consent , but there is no privacy in public .
I'd date him even dressed as a chick. (I'm not a girl into girls BUT I'm open minded) 😆  For real though, I'm happy he does this. I wanna be part of a crime fighting team 🤔
Giving the scammers a glitter box it's like take Diwali to a different level
The call I got was the us custom service I laughed vsohard they hung up.
Amazing work!. I love the elderly, it bothers me to no end that they are the ones being prayed upon.
I think its awesome what your doing. I get scam call all the time and I try to keep them on the phone as long as I can and mess with them the longer I can keep them on the phone that maybe pne less person that gets scammed
5:05 , 7:43👌🏼🤣
Keep up the good work
before i watch this video: i was reading the title ignoring the "(Featuring Mark Rober)" and thought well..is mark there too? then reading the rest and was so big smiling xD
The scammers located in India will not be shut down.  The politicians in India get kickbacks from most of these scammer operations.
PLEASE PLEASE DELIVER A GLITTER BOMB TO THE 11TH FLOOR OF THE SCAMMER OFFICE TO DEMEYO
What a beauty!
Yes you look alike to him lol I was thinking as I saw your display thumbnail
why do all scammers have the same thing in common: an Indian accent
THIS was awesome!
When she starts singing post Malone Dedication
Scammers have better Glitter bomb , the proof is on this man haircut, the bomb dyed his hair
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
That Scammer is so Pathetic XD
keep up the god work
Amazing work!  Congrats on the arrest.  Thank You for going after these scammers!
Well done I nearly got scamed for £30,000
Thank you so much for doing this
They got arrested or the fool the police?
Great collaboration dude - more collab please
If this channel had as many views as Mr beast, these scam call centers wouldn't exist. Can you imagine how much money this would save so many random people. Hit the subscribe and thumbs up button, this dude has probably saved people millions.
Amazing guys 🤩🤩🤩😍🥰🤣😂🤣😍🥰🤩
Recently discovered your videos, and I can’t stop watching!
Heroes!!! Many blessings to you
What about those voicemails “this is your final warning about your extended warranty”. I wish it was a final warning!
Someone is in my Gmail n Facebook already  calling and messaging me trying to scam me. Jokes on them I have no bank accounts  in my name. I'm as poor as it gets. Freaking idiots. Hate scamers.
Can u help me?..u was scammed a great mos ago..Thank u!
I love you!  I think yourself and Mark Rober are wonderful and we need people like you in this world.  I am literally dealing with scammers on a daily basis about 8 to 10 times a day.  Sometimes I will mess with them and sometimes I just block and delete the call.  I just had one call me trying to sell me funeral cost insurance.  He had claimed to be from Nationwide but he refused to inform me what state he was in.  Oh well,  I wish I had your your computer skills because I would really ruin their day.  I just don't have the patients, I where my heart on my sleeve.  A big special thanks to you, Mark Rober, Jim and the law enforcement agencies that were able to collaborate in bringing some of these 'scum of the earth assholes' to justice.  Good for you!  Stay safe.
I would love to see how some of these scammers would react to recieving the Glitter Bomb 4.0. Let's see another Colaberation. You and Rober are awesome. I'd give three thumbs up if I could.
Thank you so much for all you do. I've watched so many of your videos and feel that I am better equipped to smell a rat with some of these scams. You and Mark are the warriors for us Senior citizens. Thank you, thank you.
This one is great, I love watching the one where you get into their computer and delete all their files. Thanks for sharing and have a nice safe day. Keep up the good fight!! God bless you and your team!!!
I don't understand this. I mean, I'm not an US citizen, so it works differently for me, but why bank websites showcased on the videos have such simple login forms? Saveable passwords? I can't even save password for my bank account and it comes partially filled (so I type individual letters inbetween).
Thank you for bringing awareness
Keep up the good work and maybe you can change the laws .👊👍👍
Oh no dont go to india , uv shown ur face , take care people need u and ur team buddies , godbless  u all, love from philippines💜🧡
Glitterbomb my a$$, next time stick a honey badger in the box.
Can’t wait !,get ‘em!lol
where can we learn how to see if someone is watching our computers?
I need help, my Tronlink account have been hacked about 4 weeks ago..
Thank you for doing this.  If the results of your efforts sometimes are disappointing to you, don't allow it to discourage you! I am convinced that there are legions like myself who were scammed, know someone who was scammed. or who was never scammed but still had 2/3 of their phone calls or e-mails hi-jacked by scammers. We take great delight in watching someone doing something.  James Veitsch(sp) is also delightful. Keep up the great work!
LEGEND
The new one is your google business page they call me weekly about my trash company I actually tortured them last week 🤣
Love seeing him work on these scammer low life crooks!
I don't think going to India is a good idea.
This is so beautiful
Can't you just hang up after they sent the extra money to your account and keep it?
Your awesome, keep up the good work
U actually look better as a women at least U don't have PINK GREEN BLUE YELLOW PURPLE OR RED HAIR 😂
Did U write and sing your theme song ? 🤔 don't tell Me a scammer sung it 😂. Tedi maki choot tedi maki choot  🎤🔊 🎵 🎶
Sucks you can't send them an IED full of shrapnel.
U r not alone! We got this too in New Orleans. There are scammers are pretending to be Entergy(electric company) scamming people for money!
Huh... no wonder those Bollywood movies were top-notch: even IT support members were Pro's !
I love u man
There's a special place in Heaven for people like you. Blessings.
This is one of my favorite videos of yours because you break it all down piece by piece. My mom was scammed and she ended up getting the FBI involved........they threatened her and the family. She was very afraid and so were we! Thank you for all you do! 😄❤️💪🏼
Thank you so much for your hard work catching theses bastards. God bless you.
You are "THE MAN"
it was funny after calling Dell's support i started receiving calls from scammers
You guys ROCK.....Thank you for doing what you do!
good man send all of them in prison !!!
Can you follow the the prosecution and make a show about what happened to this lady?
BROTHER I LOVE YOUR STYLE.  YOU HUNT THE HUNTERS AND TRY TO BRING THEM IN WITH KINDNESS , LONG SUFFERING AND GENTLE PERSUASION TILL YOU KNOW THAT NOTHING WILL WORK!!!  YOU ARE DOING THE WORK OF GOD AS GOD HIMSELF WOULD DO IT!!!
Why is there a roll of toilet paper in the living room
Hey man, I sincerely hope you can find partners in India to nab them red handed as well. I'm from India and this really irritates me that the majority of the scum exists here.
Lol I've been getting lots of emails for failed delivery attempts form "amazon" for stuff I didn't order, I just delete them. Though I've been getting emails from Norton now, which I have never got, saying my subscription has ended. Makes me wonder if they have moved on form the amazon scam and are pretending to be Nortan now
You guys are awesome
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO!!!!!!!
Døbludøbludøblu 😂
Hahaha dude look like a lady... the wig and lipstick are you 🤣 I've watched that youtube  guy that makes those glitter bomb things... so cool that you are teaming up with him to do this.
R u gay?
We thank you sir
I love you Peter 🤣
3:10 MY MAN IS SPEEDRUNNING DELETING FILES
This is the best video that I have seen thus far. It's one thing that you slow down the scammers by being on the phone with them for hours on end, and wiping out their computer files. It is a huge step forward to have the police show up!
I realize it would probably be a tad illegal to make a glitter-bomb that also included some C4, but it wouldn't bother me in the slightest if some scamming SOB was found blown to smithereens by a package that they themselves stole in the first place. I'd happily watch a TV series titled "RETRIBUTION" depicting real footage of scammers going ka-BLAMMO when the package they stole blowed up real good. That there would be some Must See TV!
Y'all need a nobel prize for your work.
The cops are to busy dragging people out of a window because they didn't stop at a stop sign. And thank you for what you do and have done to help many people out there.
This was epic!!
This particular scammer on the phone works with other scammers in the US to pick up the package and also record them opening it, this is why that scammer in the air bnb had her own phone recording her opening the box so that the other scammers see it happening for them to send them the funds and to get a cut out of it.
Well done. thank you!
i thank you for being a good person!
How can I become like you?? I want to protect people from scammers..
He's liberating lives from the scammers lol  Absolutely legendary
Gentlemen, what your doing is amazing and my hat is off to you. These scammers ruin people's lives and deserve NO mercy.
I keep getting emails from Scam Norton. Since watching I just delete them
Did you catch an actual member of the scam or an unwitting past victim being used as a pick up patsy. They filmed themselves opening the item so i suspect the latter.
Why did you block their face?
The government and police care more about giving tickets to tax payers rather than looking for real criminals. They know that the tax payers will pay and most criminals won't be able to if they are in prison.
Thank you, Scammer Payback
KEEP IT UP
The problem is in poor country's the police can be bought Evan when there is evidence the police will warn them that there going to raid the place giving them time to move on to another area and set up again ! But amazing work your doing and by making everybody aware of the scams stops them making money
Seeing you without a Goatee is weird.
Your doing a good thing. Keep it up.
"okey gutu da sturrr i will nat kray"
I was hoping for a more substantial video that actually had more focus on the scammer who, supposedly, got caught. This was just another _''Hey, I'm a R-Tard that like to entertain other R-Tards, but now I click-baited you into watching my low quality video about scamming scammers''_. If you've seen one, you've seen them all. Hos this video has so many views and likes is beyond me 🤦‍♂️
❤🙏❤
They got 21k from me. I love you
Well Vivian Rodgers is going to fuel my nightmares for a couple of weeks. Keep up the fight.
3:30 dubludubludublu
the ambulance chasers & the bill collectors with guns don't care about the average American losing their life savings ... they're trying to buy a bigger house
pepper your angus India scammers
You are amazing 💜 Thank you so much for your time and effort. Incredible 💜 God bless you 🤗
Great work!!! I appreciate what you are doing. I am a victim of a scam and you're right, people need to wake up. I tried to get my bank (Canadian) involved when I was in the middle of the "transaction" and they laughed at me. At least the OPP were responsive but by then it was too late.
is Vivian single?
Thank you for doing good things.
Your an awesome man I don't think I have one day that I don't get some sort of scammer call.
Im worry about you dude, the more you do this, the more you putting yourself in danger, i know you do this for people who easily get scam and thats great but please do Be careful what you doing.
Yyeeaaaa the scammers worst nightmare the glitter bomb hehehe boi
So sad......they prey on the elderly
Wish I had the money to help you do more for the people who are victims like me ..
It’s all about 13:56 have their hands up like what’s wrong while rocking 19000 lbs of fart infused glitter
👏👏👏👏🖖🖖🖖🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️
I love and appreciate you so much for catching these scammers and informing innocent victims on what to do if they have been scammed. These despicable scammers always go after the most vulnerable people, and they deserve to be prosecuted, shamed, and shut down! Keep up the good work! I'm in long term care, with 0 income, or I would join your channel.
Why is this not a National TV show on NBC Wednesdays at 7pm? I think a show dedicated to crushing scammers would destroy.
Should not cover their face can’t expose them if you cover their face
this is gonna finished when all the faces be on  camara...
YES  YES YES THAT WAS  FUCKING AMAZING YOU AND YOUR TEAM ARE  FIGHTING THE  GOOD FIGHT 👍.KEEP IT UP 💯
Why can't we cancel anydesk or and all the websites similar...?
Chur
I can't believe people are that stupid.
Dublu Dublu Dublu Dot. DVR reference.
The glitter actually made his outfit look better. I think this backfired on you guys
Every morning give yourself a pat on the back. You are a unsung hero.
Hey your hair is Superb!!
Use dye packs that can't be washed off easily so all there friends and neibors know they are a thief. Soon the word will get out and the ink stains will be known as the mark of a thief!!
You rock
NOBODY BORN IN INDIA HAS EVER BEEN OR WILL EVER BE NAMED STEVEN WILLIAMS. WHY ARE THEY TELLING THE VICTIM WHAT TO CLICK ON AND WHEN TO CLICK ON IT!!! I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE ACTUALLY FALL FOR THIS
You need a tv channel. A prime time tv show. More people need to know what you are doing.  Maybe Hollywood can get involved.
Respect bro...Much love and appreciation from Mauritius Island..
When someone says doubeloo doubeloo doubloo dot, its time to hang up the phone
5:57 Just ctrl + A + Del LOLOOLOLOL
LoL
Can it be colored smoke bombs as well or are those a tad too much? Sorry not sorry hahaha
Awesome!  Take them down!
WoW!! you guys are awesome you Mark & Jim
You don't have any dislike....it tells a lot!
I can't believe they still don't have a program that checks if they are in a vm, or that edits the page automatically rather than just editing the html in front of you...
you are brilliant, love the videos and love, even more, to see these B's get their comeuppance.
One way to stop the scammer is to attack the money mules and increase penalties on them.
She has a cell phone propped up monitoring her opening the package, then following a folded piece of paper instructions when back in the car.  Low level working for someone who doesn't trust her or another victim.  What was the actual story?
Congrats man! U can get more of them!
the fact that this guy is so disturbed by these crimes shows he must be blocking out the real crime being allowed to happen on purpose in left wing ran States of late. Armed robbery was down graded to a misdemeanor in Manhattan, NY recently and that is not a lie. Just like the joker let's out criminals in Gotham, this is by design along with other tactics to collapse the USA economy on purpose (from within primarily).
How do people fall for this, WHy would anyone think it was normal to have to wrap money in tinfoil and add random items in with it surely that would make them think something is very wrong.
I wish you could get my money back from my scammer
Just hope they got more than a token suspended sentence.
thx for your work
Call me paranoid but after I watched one of your videos, I question, and prohibit, almost EVERYONE who wants into my computer. Even the DELL support staff when my webcam went out and I wanted a warranty repair. I have always questioned the honesty of anyone who claims I "have a refund" unless I have specifically requested it. Thanks for all your great work catching these douche bags.
Low key who would fall for this if they’re asking you to hide money in envelopes and foil I’m worried for our country🥴
Thank you love you man... keep up the great work
so cool, doing the Lord's work. Everyone should show this video to their friends, parents and grandparents  ❤
Lol Vivian that was so awkward
Good work guys👍
Vivian is less then attractive
bro send an air bag bomb. air bag detonates when box is opened
I wish you could also do the same to those who scam people by telling them they are a family member and that they were in some accident. not sure how but the know personal info about the family member but ask for you to se nd money via WU, we were almost scammed
I love it!
Vivian Rodgers rocks!!! LOL
How do they make it look like your bank account was provided money if they are not really transferring the money? I would doubt they would send you 4,000 to your bank. Its is a computer program they have?
I think you are rocking that skirt a little too much!
8:50 good acting.🤣
YOU GO BOY!!
I love this.. awesome work
Thank you.
Tank you so much.
Yes America land of the free... Where they lock you up for defending yourself and let the criminals go free
Love the videos, not sure about the red lipstick though 😉
Crying Steven is the funniest thing (but I'm so glad that my grandparents do not have online banking)
Pierogi Thank you so much for the brilliant work you are doing. It is much appreciated. At 57 I found out I am autistic which really explains the difficulties I have. Especially with technology. Your videos are truly educational and very entertaining.
Seem the knights of the round table are gathering together to destroy the scum that preys on the innocent  AWSOME  keep it up and thank you
the fact that you had to blur the scammers face tells me who the winners are in these situations and why they continue to do these scams, law enforcement don't care. hands tied
3:31  Scammers: Dublew dublew dublew dot
Keep it up. Thanks for educating us.
you are heroes!!
BRAVO
Besides the fact that I am entertained, I love the justice that has been delivered.
Fabulous work. We can help. We're teachers from across India. We can educate students about scammers.
I'm so glad that there's finally people fighting back against the scammers. U guys need 2 b commended by the gov't, either local, federal of both.  I just finished watching the video where u helped a couple recover almost 5k, that's amazing and thank you. Your kindness will b rewarded someday. I wish I had your knowledge of computers so I can help scam victims too. Keep up the good work and may God bless u all 4 this good deed!
keep up the good work - the scum deserve all they get!
These types of scams should be a capital crime in every country.  They target the most vulnerable people in our society and and they destroy them.  They should be publicly hung and left to rot as a deterrent to other similar pirates.
I love you 💝
Blue hair?!?!?  Come on, you're supposed to be a man..!
Thank you 🙏
Vivian actually looking pretty hot.
Pierogi, you and your associates are AMAZING!!  On behalf of all the victims out there, I thank you!!!  YOU are providing a much needed service, not just entertaining people!  :)  Well done!
I love watching your show and stuff this is the kind of stuff that needs to be done more and we need we need FBI and everybody CIA doing the same thing I mean I don't know why they can't track him down y'all track him down from your freaking home computers that's that amazes me
You're not "just three guys!" You're the bomb!!
U R a true Hero!
Noiceee!!
What strategy for us to fight scammers?
Thank you for all you do,guys! We love you!

YOU ARE THE MAN...!
Beeyoootifull!
3:30 "Dub-bloo Dub-bloo Dub-bloo"
So no one is going to say it?  Dude makes for a pretty dishy older gal in that blond wig.
Do you know if this person was prosecuted?
I get ten emails a day with these assholes trying to scam me… Yes, 10,  I have a very old Juno account and I guess they figure I’m an easy target. God Bless you guys for going after these maggots
Appreciate all that you guys do.
Even sexier as a cross dresser. Who knew?
so i dont know if you do this but ive been getting a bunch of scammers calling to the point that im super paranoid. would you be able to take their numbers (which i have more than 10 numbers on block) and stop them from calling me? they just keep calling with new numbers and no matter what i say to them they keep calling me. please help me 15:01
Thank you guys for everything you do!  You're great 🙂
You are e cute lady 🤪😂 Love your movies.
Why isn't the FBI contracting you for this?!
That was GREAT!!
So do u ever go after scammer shops in Kenya?????  They are scamming as Amazon "support."
God...u make such a pretty girl!!!
Thank you so much for these videos! I was watching Catfished which is sort of sad because I felt bad for all the women that are getting duped. Then somehow I stumbled onto this and I find it hilarious. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time.
Thank you for what you and Mark are doing.
It will be a nice video if we can see the SCAMMERS in INDIA OPENING A GLITTER BOMB in their office  ??????  ~~~~~~~~~~ VERY LONG CLEAN UP  !!!!!!!!
When he sung congratulations 😂
I absolutely love that you, Mark and Jim teamed up on these sewer rats!  You’re awesome!! 🥇 I adore Mark’s glitter bombs!!
Definitely going to subscribe. You are like angels helping out humanity. N trying to make the world a better place
I'd pay for more glitter bombs to be sent
Freaking awesome man!
What would happen, once the mistake is identified in the transfer you would say sorry I'm keeping the money? keep up the work, I have no idea how you guys do this nice to see
Unfortunately, the person who had to clean up that glitter bomb was probably the owner of the other BNB she was hiding out in (notice the towels on the bed).  Expose these people...don't block out their faces.
Doublu Doublu Doublu Dot the Windows dot come
Meanwhile and liberal cities they are making armed robbery a misdemeanor. I don't think that the police care enough about the scammers. With as much technology as we have today they should be able to find these people and lock them up. So what happened to the person that opened the glitter bomb and why couldn't we see the face?
But i don't understand how people can get to the part of wrapping up the money and their brain's are not telling them that something is wrong here..
More videos like this, loved it
I love the footage of glitter girl being busted by cops. I love it love love love it…!!! 💕
I would love to Lean Your skill please assist.
I hope you do go to India and catch ‘em all!!!!
You’re a hero
9:00 Fakest crying ever!
I tell everyone in my family one simple technique.  Never give money to anyone who calls you.  If you truly owe money to some company, they will contact you via a reputable way.
Beautiful revenge…
You all are angels
THIS WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! <3
You guys are great. Especially you pierogi
The best ever well done man good on you..
Needs a shirt - I am Vivian’s son
While all major tech companies have Indian origin CEO's, it's really disheartening to see Indian involved in such pathetic and illegal activities.
Dude! I just found your videos...thank you so much. I have shared several of your videos in hopes someone somewhere this info will help. KEEP UP THE FANTASTIC WORK!!  GLITTER BOMBS ARE THE BEST🤣🤣🤣
Top man Pierogi, keep up the good work, love your videos JB (uk fan)
This is INCREDIBLE. JUST INCREDIBLE WORK.  My question tho. Why isn't the Police/FBI doing the same at greater scale for all the resources they have? They can even hire this guy and his team for that matter...
As soon as I answer and hear the Indian accent I hang up 🌚😂✌️
Bro... WOW! This is amazing work that you do. I'm not a victim of the jackassery that these "humans" do, but it puts a bad pall over their home country. It's culturally degrading and I am glad that you are proactively putting forth the effort to expose scammers. I have an older Father, Uncle, Aunt & Great Aunt (Lost my Mom back in October) and I have shown them a video or several - My Uncle loves 'em and laughs when you really get in their craw! - and because of you and your channel they all know what to watch for and they have even turned to my Geekery and asked me how they can better protect themselves both online and over the phone. Being a Sci-Fi geek (Specializing in Star Trek) I can honestly tell you that your actions are indicative of a Light Side Jedi! I know that's a Star Wars reference! Lol! Keep it up and hopefully you'll be able to turn one (or more ) of these guys away from their actions. Always strive to protect the innocent and keep letting the scammers know that "Resistance is Futile!" (There's the Trek reference! Lol!) One more - Zefram Cochrane, who discovered Warp Drive for Earth, his favorite food was/is/will be pierogis! Just a little tidbit for ya!  Stay safe and healthy! Keep up the good work! Live Long and Prosper! 🖖😎
No thank you!! fight the good fight
Brilliant of you go to India,the information you could gather for the world network and the fat cats running the companies who are taking all the money,peoples money from all over the world,bless you man.
i work b4 as tech rep/cust support whenever i receive calls about this freagin scammers and customers are trying to ask help from me, i just advice them to turn their computer off as in no power then simply advice to call manufacturer, since we really dont have any controls to their computers
You should team up with Jim Browning, Mark Robet and Trilogy media to do something big and stuff that really hurt those scammers. Once again a greate video. I love what you are doing.
maybe this question has been answered, BUT, if all of them use Anydesk, why havent you talked to them?!?! or to request that connections from the genesis or matrix building are blocked?
You and Rober are a great team. i cold see you as college-roommate best friends.
My man - IRONICALLY I subscribed to your channel a couple days ago. I spoke with my elderly mom TODAY and she was asking me about someone who needed to get on her computer to continue the software protection subscription. I called them, of course “Gary” called me back from a number in Texas and said they were affiliated with Geek Squad. I said cancel and you’re not getting on the computer to do anything. It’s crazy and GREAT timing. I said, “they got you before mom but not again.”
The glitter looked actually good on her jeans.
Keep on keepin' on, Vivian.
I love this.
Dude this is helping so many Moms out there,,,,respect....
Me I'm a cold hearted person and would end up laughing at them.
I don't have an Internet bank account. Besides that there's no money in my account.
😀👍
Can you please help the American mums and dads being scammed by Donald Trump from sending money to his legal fund ? Just kidding 🤣
Great editing and SFX in the intro mate ! I thought I was wacthing an episode of Mr Robot ... well done !
You know what’s funny… WHO THE HECK has this much time and effort to deal with a scammer like this and not figure out it’s a scam!? 🤦🏻‍♀️
I had a scammer a few years ago contact me via text msg for something that I don’t recall. He wanted me to send him iTunes cards worth $40. Needless to say, I knew it was a scam, so I dragged our text messaging out for a few hours. After he knew that I wasn’t going to send him any iTunes cards or the code on the back, he just started cursing at me via text. It was hilarious!!
They need to start imposing harsh prison times for scammers, seriously make the min sentence 15yrs or even 20. The worst thing a person can do is hurt our most innocent unborn, children or good honest folks who are really trying to do the right thing. Keep it up, you are actually making a difference
Wow am embarrassed in Texas
They even call us here in Germany!! This really has become a pandemic 😭
I live close to Pearland tx scary
Mark this scammer payback is my favorite video on your channel. I think you should do a round 2 with the most recent update of the gliter bomb. 💣
Ha! Got emmm! Finally!!! Keep up the great work buddy
Well done! Thanks.
Mark Rober should sell those glitter bombs.
Mark Rober is awesome
You should have used the paint that used in dye packs from the bank
Oh wow this is awesome your the best bro
respect.      Thank you brother.                Keep fighting the good fight.
Solid work. Thanks for what you're doing.
Payback with a glitter bomb, It’s a BEAUTIFUL thing! 🥰
Awesome!
You ROCK, thank you for all you do.
This whole thing is like a super hero dream team trope and I'm here for it!
👍👍👍👏👏👏
i love how "steven williams" sure sounds like he's from the indian sub continent
Your awesome wish you were my nephew
This so needs to be a Prime Time tv show!
This is absolutely one of the best things on Youtube. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help.
You are awesome!! Thank you for what you do!!!
Habeebabewbebebdy
You are food got it
I’m a medium I can help catch scammers.
What they are doing in the UK now is drop calling from premium rate numbers so you call back and they keep you on the phone while you rack up a huge phone bill
We need to see the faces 😡
Came for the scammer payback, but stayed for Ms Vivian! Good lawd, she's a fine, FINE looking woman!! 😻
There is all kinds of evil going on in our Country dear.... this isn't even the worst of them..
Keep up the great work and never stop fighting back . We can put the scammers out of business for good
I get calls from Kingston Jamaica and it’s always funny I just chit chat with em while they try to keep the convo on the sweepstakes I won 😎
I am from India and it breaks my heart to see that there are people who would do anything to get some fast bucks. They ruined India's name also in the process.
Do send some to the scammer centers in india, just put indian-sim cards with a contact there...
Me I will not return the scammer his money because they stole  money from many people
LOVE YOUR VIDEOS. KEEP IT UP WITH THEM!
Love this, I have imagined doing similar
Legend
He would make a great femboy
congrats mate
Nobody don't get no money no money I'm not even nothing chicks for free
The scammers got your password then taking take all your money in your bank account
Why do you protect their identity though 🙄
I'm sure we were a victim from customer service from Kaperski bought from office Depot. This person had me give access to my new  computer and router. So Everytime I turned it on I could not get online because my router was being used by someone else. I finally unplugged everything and stopped using it. I'm just glad I never used it for banking. I'm using a laptop and hotspot for working at home. I've been told the desktop will need a new motherboard and router. I'm scared to do that and have same thing happen. Same person has called us every 6 months requesting the computer be turned on for him.we tell him we don't have it anymore and hang up on him.
I say drop the mother of all bomb on the scammer building
"No, officer! I always have glitter all over me!"
Ha ha so funny .......ty
HAPPY NEW YEAR 2022! Mr. Pierogi, Mr. Roper, and all the rest who stand for justice, y’all are HEROES! Taking down scum who pray on people who think they have wronged someone. I could watch your vids all the time but I need to take of my business. My husband was in legal law enforcement and a firearms/sniper trainer for most of the sheriff departments of Indiana. Unhappily he passed 5 yrs ago but he is still fondly remembered for his expertise and my personal HERO for 36 awesome yrs.  Keep up the good work gentlemen and thank you  🤩!
Outstanding!
That is freggin bad A… Keep on doing good. YOU GUYS ROCK!!! My father in law lost his house due to giving money to a scammer.
pierogi means patato dumpling in polish
God bless u & ur crew, if u have one, for exposing these crooks. Kudos 2 u....
Thank you and all the scam fighters for the work you do.  I wish I had the technical ability to join your efforts, but one thing I do from time to time is go along with the scam for as long as I can, because while they are on the phone with me, they are not scamming an innocent victim that has worked very hard to earn their money.
Dude you in the vivan roggers costume- you actually look so good like wtf 😂
Was the Glitter Girl arrested?
LOVE YOU S/P!  You are the best! I love all your characters.
Because of watching this, I now take all scammer calls and keep them on the line as long as I can.  Then, when I need to leave, I wail on them before hanging up.
I feel like that you are the real Batman…Thanks for everything you are doing..Don’t ever stop…
Who was the woman arrested? And what has happened with her case? The public wants to know.
You're a cyber hero! May God bless you more!
you are awesome dude
I haven't had a good laugh like that in a looonnnggggg time.  I have to go to the potty now....lol   Great video.
Thank you for everything you do. I am glad I found you on YouTube.
9:27 I know you put this on when no one is around.....😄
Thank you
Unfortunately just the mule, but maybe that will lead to information on the people perpetrating it.
9:05 "I didn't raise you this way"  .  That killed me
GOD BLESS YOU MAN!!!!!
I enjoy seeing what you do, keep up the great work
You rock
I hate those phone scammers, Thank you…😍
Well done
So why did a girl pick up the package in the states ?
Honestly how does anybody fall for those scams?  Wrap envelopes of money in tinfoil to send to them? lol
His pants are sparklie
Thank you and good luck. It's a shame our tax payer servants will not honor their oaths.
Lol another great video and so glad some extra good came out of it and one if these dirt bags will be held accountable for their actions. Keep sharing knowledge, thx bud
Funny how these scammer idiots use names that CLEARLY do not match their accent! LOL
Keep up the good work ! <3
We want moreeee !! Let’s take them ALL down, SHAME ON THEM
Good for you! That was awesome! The elderly are especially vulnerable.
Thank You 🙏
Dude  I would be honored to print a sign for you to place behind you.  PM
Good one
Oh come on, you just enjoyed crossdressing, admit it
Thank you sooo much!
is there any way for me to bait scammers? like posting a phone number somewhere?
God bless you man, you are a gift this world needs badly.
This channel is crack i swear lol!
That's awesome!! Keep up a good work!
Crying Steven! That's awesome!!😅😂🤣🤣
I'm fairly late to your channel but I am curious as to why the FBI or DOJ doesn't assist people like you in these situations?
good work . god bless!
💥💥💥💪💪💪
I've had calls way in the past where the person on the other end wanted me to do some kind of transaction with them and when I asked them to mail me information the call was soon ended.  As far as I'm concerned if you are legit then you wouldn't mind using the United States Postal Service to send me information....
Sam fantastic guys!
should be a XXXL glitterbomb 😁 that the whole room is full with it
I have to go to the potty lol.
Should Have Sent a Real Bomb 💣
I got scammed out $20,000. From Oct 2017 to 2020. They are always hassling me. I wish I could bust them
How many of these scam call centers are there in India? I know there is a bunch. I dont think you will ever eradicate them all. I think the way to go is to find them and "eliminate" all participants in each call center as you find them. Call me whatever you want but the Indian government isnt doing anything about it and the toll these scams take on people around the world is crazy. Start neutralizing these people and you will have less victims. We need swift justice for these crimes.
Why blur her face?
You look great with that blue hair 💙 🧞‍♂️
Seeing how this dude was dressed that glitterbomb is kinda frosting on the cake
Showed this to my computer illiterate friend 💪🏼
No..no.  no more dressing up perogi  very very unsettling..aaand a little bit sexy
That you have 144K likes and Zero Dislikes shows that you are doing good. Keep up the good work!
Love what you're doing
😲📢 YOU GUYS ARE AWSOME!!! THANK YOU!!!  JUST F.Y.I.  WE GOT A CALL AND IM SICK JUST OUT OF THE HOSPITAL, AND I GOT INTO IT WITH ONE OF THOSE SCAMMERS TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE GOING TO GUT ME LIKE A FISH, THEN LEAVE ME HANGING AT THE PLAYGROUND!!!!  SO THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!  👍🙏🙏🙏😁👌📞🎧 🙋🏼‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️  VIRGINIA U.S.A.
For real you need to make more glitterbomb videos like this. This is hands down the best sacammer video ever
Community colleges need to start offering free anti-scam classes to seniors. In fact maybe just show Pierogie's vids in senior care facilities.
We need to black ball India and then they will enforce and go after these people, If we issue a trade embargo till they fix this and arrest these criminals it would be under control,
Was it really necessary to dress up as a transvestite??
That guy getting out of his car covered in glitter was the best.  WELL DONE!
Legends!!!!!!!
Great work. Just creating the awareness that you have already has the power to help others. Thanks for taking the time and always doing the right thing. 👏👏👏
@11:30 ~The government needs to wake up~ ?? You’re asking some professional criminals (the government) to do due diligence and protect the very same citizens they’ve been raping and lying to for decades 🤔🤔
You really didn't have to cross dress. Freaking weird dude.
Keep getting them. They are scum! Preying on the weak.
White hats keep doing what you're doing!
Thanks man you are saving our people, who have lost their money's from scammers.
Awesome Work!! Good Karma coming your way!
💚💚💚
Is Pierogie a Polish guy making me proud
Since watching your vids I've gotten more insight into exactly how scammers work and the lengths they go to to try to steal money from people.  Keep up the good work and keep turning the tables on them!
Scammers of any kind deserve the death penalty, or should be sent to the gulags.
why does the federal government not employ the likes of  you & others who do the same. Which is basically you know your way around the computer & software that’s being used in these scams . I;'d have thought the federal government in the U.S & here in the United Kingdom's HM Treasury would be involved foiling  these scams. As i've heard you say you shut one down & its opened up within 24hrs to another place & the police who are involved should be caught out, as am sure the Indian Govt don''t want they kind of headlines. Though what your doing in the meantime is great & really appreciated & am sure a lot more would appreciate you if word sporeads.  We all know older people & how private they can be & self sufficient & mostly live out their last years helping when they can even if that is checking in way other seniors in the area but if they get mugged or scammed they don't tend to tell people & that gets exploited more way these animals but the seniors believe its their own fault & get embarrassed and certainly won't divulge that information personally, only when confronted with evidence but back to you guys... yiz are all superb & deserve a wage as you all have great computing skills & use them for the good in life & that's really noble as most would use for scamming so thank you, thank you, thank you.
Why not go to India - or at least partner with some people over there?
You're doing God's work
Don't blur the faces. These people are the worst trash on earth.
I want to fight scammers too how can I join the fight?!?!?
how could anyone fall for that???
The ultimate scammer payback is……them scammer’s die.
Export glitterbombs in France please ! too much thieves here . . .
This guy is probably a scammer too like dog the bounty hunter , jk

This guy is way too happy with crossdressing
The Payback Trifecta has been loosed on the world of scammers, scumbags and criminals!
Go to the store, I will not cry 🤣🤣
Send MORE glitter bombs!! LOL This is an EPIC partnership!
I worked in a corporate music supply store with magnificent sound systems on each of our computers. The scammers always called on line 5 or 6 so we knew it was them and had great fun with blasting music (usually Eye of the Tiger) as soon as a human picked up. Once, my assistant was blasting a rare live Led Zeppelin set over the store system (before open while we were prepping the store) and when I answered the phone I just left it on speaker and turned up the music. The dude stayed on the line for around 15 minutes. It was actually a great set. Occasionally, I sing Barry White tunes to the scammers as soon as they come on, "I'm feeeeelin' riiiiight, Baby!" .... I continue to have fun and waste their time.
*APPLAUSE*
This is the absolute best!  Good stuff guys
"...that even McCauley Caulkin can't take." 😄 Is he the fart standard?
Just curious was that one of the scammers or a package theif?
Theres a very easy answer to all this. Just stop outsourcing call centres to India until they do something about the scammers. The US government will pursue the likes of Julian Assange to his grave but will do nothing about this type of crime. The 3 countries which seem to be the most affected by this crime are the US, UK and Australia. Why is there no pressure put on the Indian government to sort this out. In the UK you only need 100,000 signatures to have this discussed in parliment. Jim Browning could easily get that amount. But that would probably kill his revenue stream.
Great dedication here to take on the scammers. I remember a while ago that I was called a racist because I suggested that the majority of these scams originated in India. It’s videos and channels like these that highlight the actual reality.
You guys are AMAZING!! Keep up the good work
I love the timer at the bottom like he's speedrunning the scam lol
Thank you, Vivian!  We ❤ you!
One of the best ways to use youtube - fight crime and raise awareness to scamming
Why isn’t the FBI partnering with y’all?
Your a true American hero!!
I got scammed for $6,500.00.  Can You help me get the Scammers Back?
I'm retired 911 and I would speak to these devastated elderly people who had lost so much money. Thank you so much for doing this day after day and helping these people.
thank you bro
AGAIN!!!! YOU'RE MY HERO!!!!! Keep up the AWESOME FIGHT!!!
My phone has been ringing a lot less I am sure because of you, Jim Browning and Scam Baiter. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE GUYS!
I just went through this with eBay luckily I got everything back
Last week my mother received a call claiming to be our cable company. Since my brother pays the bill, my mom put him on the phone. When it came to get access my pc, he instantly knew something was up and hung up the phone.
Epic
Pierogi deserves the Presidential Medal of Freedom
Why censor a criminals face?
I was scammed back in2015 for $600. but I'll never see or get it back, I hope you guys can get as many as possible
Great work guys 🥂👌
YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME
awesome.....hands clapping thank you....don't stop until you get them all. they deserve to be locked up scamming people out of their hard earned money and livelihood.
I’m in Colorado if I can help plz let me know
Now I want to find a refund scammer and waste 5 hours of their time.
Why protect these scammers' identity?
Man can I please be a part of your next scammer catcher. I need some helpful revenge on these type of people.
The perfect crossover
Love this
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 i freaking love this guy!
in germany people are getting phoned, pressured and manipulated to get them to believe that thiefs are on their way, or any other coverstory. People throw money, juwels etc. out of the window and it is horrable that nothing can be done. The wants called my mom (79) and they manipulated her into believing that her grandson (he was 9 at the time) was in grave danger. Thankfully I got home in time and called the police. But it happens to other people, well informed people like Mom who should know better but are pushed so far over the edge that they do it. IT HAS TO STOP NOW!!!! Millions of people lost their lifesavings and even if the police gets 1 person, it never gets the people behind. It is a pure nightmare for the people and while countries like Nigeria and India lean back and let those people do their crime.... It is just horrorfying ;(  Thank you for your work.
You mentioned going to India.  I don't think that is a good idea if you are going to confront these assholes.  Do you really trust their 'law enforcement'?  I believe I saw in one of your videos a scammer not only admitted what he was doing, but also explained that the police there are corrupt and getting in it for a percentage.  I believe you and the other guys out there doing what you do should be working for the FBI.  Not only for scammers, but I believe the best of guys like you should also be working on counter intelligence and counter cyber espionage and hacking that is coming from China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.
Look at the political situation. The scammers surprise you? I often ask my self why I’m not a millionaire. Then I remember I have ethics and morals.
You were  so pretty when you were posing as a woman. 😍
After hearing those lowlife scammers trying so hard and playing those emotion cards to scam people, I really wish I could punch them in the face. The fact that they are willing to deceive and scam elderly people makes me so angry.
I will like to make a petition to stop humiliates Indian Survival/Scammer worker.  Sir please have some sympathy to the indian Survival/Scammer worker,  Did u know how hard life in india mumbai??? US and UK owe them if u don't know i will like to educate u about the history of India, . British had colonize India for at least 500 year. they took all india resources, the soil, Potassium, spices, and the nutrient of Yamuna river so they learn to scam for survival. Before Mahatma Gandhi gain independence from British he make a promise to people of Mumbai that every crime and stealing was not done by hand are not consider as crime, some viewer believe its might his fault in misprediction that in future human being will invented PC Laptop, Smart Phone or Internet although mahatma Ghandi is smarter than Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking.   India politic are so corrupt causing every state of india have a separate constitution especially in mumbai, Most of the Mastermind Ring Leader and their HQ from Mumbai .According to Mumbai Constitution, this so called Scammer CEO by the hater are actually a CSO officially (Chief Survival/scammer Officer.) the CSO are the tax payer too, they need to pay tax to the corrupt government so that their premises be protected by the law and enforcement and because india are so corrupted and the high taxes demand, its not a real good money making business.     Without Call center Survival Industries India GDP will drop at least 26% Indian Government will not survive such inflation rate and will end up with bankruptcy like Greece. Those who are a real economist like me will understand their hardship. Please have some sympathy to Indian Survival/Scammer worker the poor people in poverty population in india are 5 times compare to china. An average Indian only earn 1-2 Dollar per week.
I always say, "just a minute", put the phone down, walk away, and let them rack up their phone bill waiting...It's not much but every little  helps.  Thank you all so much for fighting the good fight, guys!
Good job 👏🏽👊🏽 keep fighting
What cops don’t actually care about people getting scammed? Lol
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Thank you.
Totally Awesome
Gee, there are some lousy people in the world. This is so good to know.
Way to go!  How can I help? In SoCal.
This is a highly entertaining PSA. Totally sent it to my parents. Bravo!
You’re doing a frickin awesome job. You Sir are Karma incarnate. Love it.
12:40 please make next  one with paint . (or  💩 ?)
woooooooooooooooot!!!!!!  YOU GO GUY!!  So happy to see this!
Not me watching from Texas and realizing that was PPD 😬😬
Lol her glitter clothes and finger!! I'm crying from laughing 😃 ty for your hard work !
Ain't gonna lie but Vivian gotta pretty mouth! ;) lol Good work as always, man!
Hi Y pierogis are you Polish 👍
Thank you for your world wide care
Thank you for your hard work!
Why are you blurring out the scumbags face? You say you are all about "justice" yet you protect the identity of the criminal!
Heroes
Why is your hat reading with the text mirrored? Keep up the good fight.
So Sublime to watch ! Thank You for all that you do !
to prevent scammers getting access to our bank account, we have several steps to be able to log in, first we type our personal number, then we type a random 5-6 digit random code that our physical code generator provided by the bank, finally our own personal password, in Norway
Mmmm K. Thickest Eastern Indian accent you've ever heard, "This is Steven Williams"! Yeah right!
I hope this encourages more people to get into cyber security.
Vivians hot!
My step moms mother lost 75K to a Nigerian "pro wrestler"  who was going to marry her....
Guys, you are fantastic!
Priceless!
Thank You!
I’m with you guys, I say sting them up high.
Bro you look like you were having way to much fun in that dress. Haha love the content man
Actually with a shave and some sexy earrings you could be a knockout!
These videos should be 7-10 mins long MAXIMUM.
Spectacular!!!
THIS MAN IS A NATIONAL TREASURE!!!
This channel needs more shares, people.
Why doesn't anyone ever just be like..... "nope, I'm keeping it"
With Great power, comes great Glitter Bomb
I get a call every day.  Why can't the government direct the phone companies to shut them down?  I try to waste as much time with the scammers as I can but they hang up once they realize I am not helping them.
They are playing a fancy version of the quick change game.
Let's Go Brandon!!! 🍕😎👍🇺🇸
Awesome work buddy
God bless you!!!
You’re doing gods work boys 🤣😇
Thank you so very much. I got scammed before and am learning how not to be a victim again. Again THANK YOU!!!!!!
Great video to explain scamming process step by step. Thanks !
Can yall please make a package with real explosives that can actually hurt them
Is the glitter biodegradable?
Sorry for my late subscription to your channel.better later than never.
Whooo hooo .  Ya’ll go guys. I’m going to start calling and wasting their time.  I’m retired a retired techie with time on my hands. I could play a part here.
Wait how does that scam go from talking to a “customer service representative” to it suddenly being her _SON_ “Steven” on the line?? I’m so confused…
These scams seem so stupid and complicated that I have to wonder how they work.
the arrest at the end was satisfying
I love Happy endings!
BEING DONE DAILY...
Do you have fb page where I can share your videos because most of the people here in the Philippines are used to that particular social medium. Or can I download your videos and repost it there? Thanks and keep safe from those criminals.
Keep safe!
This guy is pathetic
I solved  the issue for myself. I haven't set up ANY of my credit cards or bank accounts online. I get snail mail statements. Actually had one scammer hang up in disgust saying, "you must be older than dirt!" Until watching Scammer Payback, I had never even heard of Zelle before. Someone once tried to make an online account on my checking account, and the bank called me. I have been with my bank for over 25 years and they were alerted because I have refused for years to open an online account.
I wanna join. let’s do this. i have a certain set of skills that will help.
Any info on an arrest?
Thank you
Jesus is King! If you do not know Jesus as Savior please pray, “ Jesus save me. At this moment I choose to have faith that You gave Your life for me and rose from the dead. Doing this You defeated death, even though it meant You had to die. You surrendered Your life for me, so I chose to surrender my life to You. Forgive me Jesus, my God. Amen.”  Jesus loves you so much. Please accept His love. I encourage you to read the Bible and pray.   “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only begotten Son into this world, that whoever believes that in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” John 3:16  🙏❤️🙏  Jesus is enough!  Again I tell you, Jesus loves you!  God believes in you more than you believe in yourself! Trust Him! Thank Him! ❤️🙏
You guys need a tactical department . Slainté
That was awesome ! Thank you !
I applaud what you are doing. But I would not take lightly that these criminals may want retribution. Don’t show yourself on these videos and take measures to protect you and your family.
You only got the courier, you didn’t get the kingpins or even the people doing the scam. I seriously wonder if the person even knows what was going on, they may just be hired by someone to grab the packages from someone’s house and ship them somewhere else.
Yeah the boys!!!! Not all Super hero’s wear capes. Love your work
It is so strange that the government isn't stepping up on this. They act like they are part of the scams. They appear to be silent meaning they are enabling the scams and are as bad as the scammers.
yet again, the government failing us, but this time, it's by complete neglect, instead of the normal reason, pure INCOMPETENCE
I don't understand how they make their victims believe that they actually got in their accounts more money than what it was supposed. Do they make an make an actual transfer of $4000?
Amazing work. 🥺
Reminds me of an Adam Sandler comedy... but truly tragic what human suffering these frauds cause.
Good work 👍
Glad to see she was arrested with the glitter still on her. Wish y’all wouldn’t have blurred her face though, but I’m sure you have your legal reasons. Thanks for this a billion times over, words cannot express the gratitude that you Mark Rober and Jim Browning and others do. Y’all should team up more.
My favorite is Vivian. Last time I had the Indians call I asked them about Vivian. They started talking in Hindi and hung up 🤣 9:37 I'm scarred
Yikes. Cringe worthy. Cross dressing and quite naturally feminine.
Good guys in real life. Pretty awesome
maybe. educating. the. user. running. with. Administrative Privileges. is. where. you. should. start.
Wait, is your real name "Pierogi"? I'm Polish, pierogi are a polish dish! Wouldn't name my child like a dish, but ok.
love it
Love these videos. Your grandma voice is brilliant.  So glad there are folks like you out there that can help curb this vicious and mean criminal activity. Education is key.
Your
You're doing God's work and I am glad that I accidentally found your channel the other day. I watch a lot of Jim Browning and one of your videos just randomly popped up in my recommend. Happy holidays :)
You are our Superman, Iron Man, Einstein, and giant teddy bear- all rolled into one!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR CREATIVITY AND DEDICATION! Blessings to you, your family, and your crew.
For the past couple weeks I've been watching scammer payback and this is the first time I've seen him dressed up as vivian. That was pretty dang hilarious, and honestly he looks pretty good with that get up on.
Also anyone get anywhere with the calls about donations for fire and police, those i get a least one a day.
💛❤️❤️❤️❤️I’m so grateful for you💐🌻💐🌻🌺❤️‍🔥
That raven Blue. looks great on you. did not have as good results when i tried that.
They should teach every kid in school. How to protect and revenge themselves from these scumbags.
3:30 dubly dublu dubly dot 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Maybe this sounds harsh, but people need to stop being so gullible! Keep up the good work!
Thank you guys, keep it up. God Bless you.
If that was the scammer at the end why would you blur the face
BRAVO!
Keep doing the good work you all are doing... the world needs more people like you Pierogi 💕
Show their face!!!
It would be AMAZING if you could travel to India and show up at one of these call centers!
No one is saying it so I will.. Pierogi wore make up 🤐
I've started to waste the scammers time by playing along with them for a few days and then emailing a load of rubbish. It's fun to see their responses and waste their time for a while.
Thank you perogi, jim and mark.
Are you serious? People send cash through the mail? How gullible are they?  Is it mostly elderly people
Great work. Be Blessed!!!
Great work but sending that glitter bomb could possibly expose you to criminal or civil charges.  I'd be careful with that.  All your hard work could be ruined.
‘)
Thanks.
I have an uncle that was unfortunately scammed by these type of people and he was utterly humiliated by the experience. I'd like to think that somehow those same scammers got glitterbombed and arrested. Preying on elderly people is horrid!
Your awesome, the awareness you bring 💘❣
Y’all are HEROS among men. Thanks for everything
Thank you guys for "all" the work you do. Keep up the Fight with the war on these scammers. They have victimized enough innocent people.
I once called back a scammer 7,264 times. The only reason I know that I called him that many times it’s because my wife called the phone company to ask how many times I had dial that number.  Took all week but was worth it to mess with their scam. Took a week for them to figure out how to block a blocked caller🤣🤣🤣🤣
Keep up the fantastic work
I love Marks videos...I watch him all the time!
You 100% LEDGEND merry Christmas from the uk
Blows my mind how gullible the elderly are.
I'm an Indian. this problem's root is not U.S GOVERNMENT. Its Indian government. They just want to suck more and more money so they do it by keeping whole nation poor(public and police). that create an understanding between scammer and cops. that's how P.D stays corrupt and that's why there are so many scammers in India. Indian I.T worker earns 5% of U.S  I.T worker. BTW do you really care about any of this shit or are you just entertainer content creater whose channel name is the topic of entertainment?
Nicely done guys
Pity you can't work with the SBS, the SAS or Delta Force ... Well done ...
😄😄😄💪💪👍👍👍👍👍👍❤❤❤❤🥳🥳🥳🥳
Nice, this collab 👌 🙌😹🤳🏽
As a non computer person, I love to see you do this.
this is what happened to my mil but hers was a romance scam. she’s out a lot of money but we are kind of hands tied because she did it willingly, we have people working on it but we are not very hopeful. i just hate how they pray on elderly people. anyway thank you for showing this
I love Hindus, they bring me such joy when they cry in English.
I dont understand ups ,Microsoft, Amazon,  etc  don't do nothing about it..
Mark & Jim: spend 1000’s of hours chasing scammers / thiefs   Police: Finally catch ONE  Justice System: Let’s the scammer free due to some bureaucratic red tape / anti-bond legislation.   Scammers: 😈 🤣 😂🤪 (goes right back to scamming)   Yea, no wonder they scam.
Marry Christmas and great job, wishes from Denmark
Thank you very much! I for one despise these type of scammers because they pray in the elderly or naïve people. They are scum bags and need to be brought to justice! Please if you are planning on traveling to India or worse Pakistan just be very very careful. I’m sure these POS will do anything not to be caught and end up in one of those third world country prisons. Love what you do and much respect and thanks!
"Jesus help me".   Even Jesus is not going to be able to get these evil scammers out of the HELL they going to.  They are REAL.  They took my 84 year old mother for more than $40,000
GOOD JOB. GET THEM. Greetings from the Netherlands. 🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
Wow
Im not crying! Steven is crying!
Even an Indian like me got scammed by one of a scammer they a network of scammers and these guys normally look like a white color professional but they are scammers
This is definitely my favourite collab
Hahhah I love these shitty scammers!!! That broken English is sooooo funny
I have 435 “friends” on Facebook ( last time I looked!) and just sent this video to everyone I  know…what a perfect Christmas gift! Thank you so much for what you do ! 🎄🎄🎄🎄 Merry Christmas 🎄🎁😊
KEEP DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING.  I WORK IN FRAUD AND I'M SO THANKFUL TO SEE YOU FIGHTING WHAT I CANNOT PREVENT.  AMAZING WORK!!
Your hair makes me want to cry
You are so appreciated 💛.  Keep up the good work.
Bravo Mate! When you go to India, count me in!
My parents were scammed out of $4000.  I cannot thank you enough for what you do.   My parents are NOT wealthy.  They live off of Social Security and a very small pension my dad has.  It hurts me so much that evil scum go after people who have good hearts and are honest.  My parents felt so dumb after it happened.  I tried to explain that they are not alone.  Thank you again for helping get the people who have been hurt.
YOU ARE AWESOME!!! Anybody here show this to your parents and your grand parents spend the 5 mins to show them and tell them to pass the video on!!!! Should have 300 million views
dude your a amazing person for what you do
Well done!  I pray you have tremendous success with this and get these lowlifes.
Thank all of you who try to combat these scammers.  My aunt was almost a victim of one of these scammers that claimed they were working with law enforcement.  Luckily she had to call my mom for a ride to the bank and my mom made her tell her what was going on.  It took her speaking to multiple law enforcement persons from multiple agencies to finally believe that she was being scammed.
It’s crazy that you are doing more for our communities and society than the actual agencies who are supposed to be responsible for protecting us, which our tax dollars are also paying for.  Thank you so much.
Not all hero wear cape
I wish more people knew about this..... I would like to be able to send it to family and friends but I think they would be clueless about this..... I can only imagine how much money certain family members have lost.....ugggg
Great videos. One thing my bank doesn't understand is why I refuse to use on-line banking. It's obvious in the content we watch here. Short cuts cost money. Besides I prefer to talk to a human face to face.
👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍
You and the others that do this, are doing the good work. Thank you for doing this and protecting people and trying to put a stop to these scammers
Shouldn't blur her face. Show these people. Expose them for who they are. She should be afriad to be in public.
Great work!
Man! Thank you so much this is epic! Can’t believe that they are in my hometown!
Great job! Now please partner with Jim and Mark. Make a bigger team of experts and attack the scammers. Make videos and look for sponsors to fund this. Good luck and thank you!
" I love you Steven."  ".... I love you too?"  XD
That's amazing. I remember seeing that on Mark Rober's video. Congrats!
I wish I'd have seen this 4 years ago. I thought it couldn't happen to me and it did. Thank you for bringing this forward.
You guys are the Avengers and the Justice League rolled into one! You seriously rock!
Thank you!
A team of retired special ops personnel needs to be sent to India.  This is the only effective deterrent since the wealthy aren't being affected thus our government isn't interested.
Okay but you do your makeup way better than me…..
Don't go to India without protection. Please be careful. If you watch Locked Up Abroad, you will see that these other places have really corrupt law "enforcement". Yes, I know the people telling their story in that show did something illegal in the first place, but it also shows how dangerous it is to be in another country if you aren't prepared. Those scammers might get you locked up instead, the laws are very loose and easily paid off, and most of those prisons are run by the prisoners with the officers/guards working for whomever has the most control behind the walls, and it is not their legal superior(s). It is worse than what could happen here in the US.  To those who want to argue that we're just as corrupt, I'm not denying there is not corruption, but I am saying we're not corrupt on the same level as other places.
this brings pure joy to my heart - to FINALLY see one of these monsters put into cuffs makes all of it that much more meaningful I can only imagine how that moment felt for you Perogie! Thank you for this and all you do, I admire what you do from powning scammers to the inspiring acts of generosity you show to guys who want to live a better life it all reminds me to live well and spread love not hate to the world. you rock!
glad kit and jim's channels brought me here lol
I shared the video where the money mule picked up from a Walgreens because I work at a Walgreens and never want anything like this to happen
Reveal their identity and we will put their posters all over places in India
These people should be publicly caned and then dropped under a prison.
Vivian Rodgers is my spirit animal
Vivian Rogers is the strongest avenger.
Honestly though... If you are dumb enough to fall for one of these scams, you deserve to lose your money.
Man, it must be good to look yourself in the mirror every day and think that you are doing good work for humanity.  Godspeed.
Great work!!!
Love you guys work amazing I hate scammers and porch pirates
Wow, in Pearland of all places, lol
Please teach a squad to join you so we can maximize your efforts and go after these scum bags. Thank you for your great work!
👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻💪💪💪👏👏👏👏👏👏
I got scammed by some asshat pretending to work for google and I was sick, didn't even think about it, but I'm a snap business owner. Fortunately they were dumb and tried to take a LOT of money at once and my bank stopped it immediately. I'm too broke and they tried to take something like 45k then 15k. Bitch.. I'm sitting on $500! 🤣😭
Keep Up the Great Work!!! Keep Kicking The Scammers Butts!!!!
Cops don't care about any crimes. They don't solve murders. They don't solve rapes. Why would they care about thefts.  Unless you buy $10 worth of shit while black. Then they suddenly care.
To think they think that aluminum foil blocks X-rays lol 😂
How can I get involved in bring them down? Besides waste there time.
Does it just seem like most of these scams are run out of India or is that an actuality?
God bless all of you. And Merry Christmas! Thank you for your great service.
My hero! love this guy loads of respect for this guy!
Love your channel keep doing what you are doing eventually more people will wake up and realize what's happening
Yo blur the reflection on the car too at 12:35 to protect your video just in case bro. These fuckers needs to be exposed like this and i don't want your video taken down, most of all, from these people !!
Dublu dublu dublu dot
Should say "I don't have a car"
My grandparents fell victim to similar scams to the tune of about $40k. The police said they couldn't do anything. The really scary part is that once one of them gets you, they share the info and then all the sharks some to cannibalize people for everything! There ought to be a special place in hell for scammers who take advantage of people like this. To see this evidence collected and the video end with the police getting involved warms my heart! Thank you for doing this.
I had a scam call a month ago in regards to my car. They asked for my model and license plate, something about insurance. I gave them a concerned voice and told them I have my plate number are you ready.  She's like yes cause this can save you money. I said plate is FCKOFF and she hung up.
Vivian, you need a shave ;)
I love Vivian !!!!!!!!!!!!!
I died laughing when Steven starting “crying” 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Why do I get Super Hero vibes from you?!❤️
I had a scammer call me saying I won the Publisher Clearing House.  They said I won millions of dollars and a car lol.  They eventually just hung up when I said I didnt have the 500 dollars to transfer.  The guy calling me literally sounded like he had down syndrome.
My Mom got scammed out of 1500$ 4 years ago these scams are real AF and they prey on the most vulnerable of people and it's so God damn wrong
These videos make me want to receive shit calls like this because all I've ever gotten to do was reply insanity to phishing emails and sadly they don't respond back to me.  LMAO esta mga bumbay tlga kakaloka ibang klaseng 5/6 na ito, where I'm from they have a bad reputation that started decades ago because they tend to run money lending schemes with insane interest thus the term 5, 6 (you get 5 and then they have you pay 6) they've seriously leveled up in their way of scamming people. Hard not to erase that from my mind so I'm super cautious when dealing with them.
For some reason this month I have had on average 5 to 10 possible scam calls a day, I do not answer and I block them.  They need to get a job and make an honest living like the majority of us do, keep up the great work.
Great video production. But at the end, you don't explain the situation of the person who got arrested.
What kind of hair dye do you use?
Likely she was just the mule
Get NEWS INVOLVED ABOUT THIS SHIIT
WTF.   GET NEWS INVOLVED
Keep it up brother!  Everyone is satisfied when thieves get their karma.
CHROME CHROME CHROME  DONT USE CHROME  DONT USE CHROME  F@UCK CHROME.  THE SCAMMERS USE CHROME
Chrome.    Stop using.  Chrome.    This is there platform. Chrome.   Get rid of Chrome and you will get rid of scammers
I'm waiting for the glitterbomb to include dye packs similar to the ones banks use.  So glad you guys are doing this.
I don't feel bad for these ppla stupid enough to fall for this obviously bs scam. Don't give me the, BUT THEY'RE OLD!?!?!?!??!
Dude pearland is 15min from my house… Pretty cool she was arrested by them
Good job young man
What u do is awesome thanks  For all u do
They do not like it when you start cussing at them in their own language
I would have went to a crack house and mail them a 8 ball.
Why not send them some fake money , get them where it hurts
Great job and thanks to both you and Mark.  These scammers are the lowest slime in the world.  Props to you guys for doing your part.
THANK YOU for doing what you do!!!! You and the rest of the people that do this fine work are much appreciated!🙂 God bless you all♡
My mother and I were victims of a scam and lost money. When we told the police, they told us it was our fault and did nothing about it. No one helped us, so I feel happy when I see your videos, for once there's someone who makes something about it and don't blame the victims, but explain them how to be prepared.  Thanks for everything, you are a hero!
I did nothin officer!!! Glitter all over her pants.....LoL
Love what you are doing, thank you. And I also love your black-bleu hair.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart to the top of my head, you are out there getting the message out about these scammers, and the glitterbomb was the best part of the whole thing. Though it's only 1 person, that 1 less person out there scamming. We do need this to be brought up to our government, even if we start on the bottom of the chain, there's no other way but up. I for one will be doing what I can to get the message out, going to our city council, mayor, as well as our Senators and other politicians of our state. Something needs to be done and now is the time for the change. Keep up the good work!
I’m in Ireland 🇮🇪 and we get scammer calls all the time.
glad to know someone cares....the latest for me is UPS saying I owe a balance before delivery
Destroy em
We love you bro!!!!! Lots of love from India ❤️
But you didn't get the scamer?
Have you ever looked into getting the catalytic converter thieves? It is a huge problem these days. We have been hit twice in nine months.
If you ever go to India, bring along a flash/em grenade to make sure they can't ever use those computers again.
I love a guy with a strong Indian accent is named "Steven Williams".  LOL
Question.  I've watched a couple of these scam-baiting videos and I keep getting confused by one thing.  After they get you to login to your bank account and they have remote access to your computer, couldn't they just take control and transfer all your money into their account from the banking website?  Why do scammers bother with the whole "typo" and gift card song and dance?
With the open borders and smash-and-grab crimes happening all over the country, with no consequences, I wouldn't depend too much on our national and local governments to help out.  It looks like it's going to have to be the private citizens with huge resources to fight these crimes.  Good on you guys!
my grandma says thank you for helping
I LOVE that she still had all that glitter on her while talking to the police.  Beautiful moment.
The crying guy killed me!!! lmao
Thank you man, for getting revenge for me. I was stupid before but never again. thank you
Thank you for doing this!  I'm also super glad that there are absolutely ZERO dislike on this video!
Thank you so much for what you do! I was almost caught by a scam like this, luckily I was able to turn my computer off and take it to geeksquad to get it restored and all the nasty stuff taken off it. I was also lucky that I despise online banking and didn't have an account to use on my computer. Please keep up you wonderful work!
What You are doing IS Smart  And Brave and we need more people like you
HOW DO YOU DO THIS VOICE BRO ITS AWESOME!!!!
I have to remind myself that all the Good People of India( and the U.S) are not represented by this group of criminals. That said, Keep Up The Good Work, The sheep ie. Me and others, need you to protect and shield us from slime that money or the lack thereof produce.
Great work  Steven was an entertaining actor
I am an Indian and proud of Indian IT industry 🇮🇳 but ashamed of these call centers. A scam happened at my home in India too. We all are suffering and govt should stop it.
They changed their names but can't change there accent.
Seeing that scammers are using feature to save the password on the website always make me wonder what would happen if they met with security like in my bank. Beacause during logging it asks me 6 random letters from my (longer than 6 letters) password. I have a trouble to get it right every time but what scammers would do?
YES!! make them scammers suffer! lol
I once got a call from my ISP telling me I owed some money and I told him to fuck off because of his thick Indian accent.  Turns out it really was my ISP.
I don’t have a car and I was like “bruh that’s so fucking cool! I can get an extended warranty on my feet!? Damn bro that’s awesome! Do I get a pair of Jesus sandals with my purchase???” They called me a dumb bitch then hung up 😂
You are invited to the carne asada bro. Good freaking work.
Yessss!!! This guy is our true hero!!!
Easy way not to get scammed is hang up on calls from India, I do daily.
Vivian Rogers is Our “mum” “we love you”
“Technical play ground” 😂🤣 yeah mess with them
Damn, police caught her glitter pantsed and everything.
My grandmother was Vivian Rogers.
why do most scammers originate from my country(India)?
Glitter bombs are great. How about some permanent dye though? Something they can't vacuum up.
What happens when they "accidentally "refund you to much money and when they tell you that you have to return it and you say "sucks to be you"?    Is the money really in your account?  If so,  can you cash it out, close that account and say Merry Christmas to me?    I can't imagine it would be that easy
Thank You for all you’re doing to help eradicate this terrible virus 🦠👍
A couple weeks ago my wife got a call and I kept hearing her say "No, I'm not authorizing the charge". I asked who it was and she said "Amazon, and someone was trying to charge her account for an i-phone". I got closer and I could hear the "Amazon representative" speaking in an Indian accent. Oh boy! I told my wife it's a scam, hang up. She didnt' hang up. I said, they are going to want you to go to your computer and log into something...don't do it. Next thing you know, they wanted her to go to her computer. I told her to "hang up and call Amazon service yourself". She finally hung up, called Amazon and found no such pending charge. I just want to say THANK YOU for these videos as they've taught me enough on how these scammers work to sniff this one out right away. I'm just happy I was nearby when it happened or else I'd have a different ending to this story.
You are an awesome person. Keep up the very good work.
Incredible thank you for what you do.
The scammer was all playing dumb to the cop but his pants were covered in glitter 🤣
Thank you.  I hope these people start getting caught and spend some quality time in jail.
That is because the US government is busy stealing billions from other countries and controling other from other countries that is why they don't have time for the weak in society.
Thank you for all you do to help those who have been scammed and those about to be scammed, thank you for protecting us
You are absolutely right.. nobody care..scammer are everywhere..thank you for your work..
Taking advantage of old people. These companies should be traced and arrested at their location. But I'm guessing the ACTUAL office is in India. So there are international laws being broken I'm sure.
Thanks for doing what ya do. My father was scammed outta alot of money shortly after my mother passed. He had to refinance the house after paying it off working his entire life.
The scammer are crying fake crocodile tears lol
Next should be a dye pack that messes up their cloth and apartment!  GOOD JOB!
Love ya
Good job!
You are one scary old lady 😂
Priceless
Thanks for doing this! Go get the scumbags!
Excellent 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Seeing those 3 partnering up is like watching avenger endgame all over again
Ohhh I hope that the first package that gets sent has as the sender name: Ben Chode 🤣🤣
This is a crossover I had no idea that happened until now 😭. This is the kind of collaboration we need more of 😊
If anyone cared they would be busted and their assets stripped, but the local cops are on the pay roll. $1000 extra a month on an Indian cops wages... 'that'll do nicely'.
😂 Grab a napkin
Thick Indian accent: "Hello I'm Steven William"
I'm challenging them (scammers), to have the guts to scam Beluga.
It’s like scam avengers!
So how was that lady in Texas related to the crying guy in India?
Omg
Stop stealing !!!!!!!!!!!! how hard can it be!
Youre really layin it on thick at the end of this video, sounds like you and crying steven use heavy emotion to illicit responses from your audience...
My grandma fell for a scammer once. She's started "seeing" someone on the internet living god knows where asking for money to solve all kinds of made up problems. Medical bills, rent and even bail. "He" would always tell her that he was gonna visit and it was gonna be great, couldn't wait to see her blablabla. My grandma is sweet, but she is daft AF, and man hungry. She tried up tried sending him HER PHYSICAL CREDIT CARD in the mail. She no longer has access to most of her bank accounts.
So you said you caught a scammer if you look at marks old videos this video of that scammer already exists so how did you catch them smh . . .
And the sadder Part than all of that is these are people with GED and high school diploma and the education of some kind and they're still this stupid so how in the hell did they graduating the first damn place
Superior job, thank you for your excellent work.  Glitter bombing nefarious bad folks is a tremendous get'em  back.  Shalom, TED
Please come to India and look me up
I love that Mark and Jim are involved with this. The 3 of you are my favorite youtubers for what you do. Thank you for serving justice in style! Beautifully done gentlemen!
Loooove these videos HaHa soooooooooooooo good
Dude what about actually catching the SCAMMMER not some poor schnuck
mark needs to design one with tasers
SIR…You are an angel…all of you! Subscribed!
Good job dude
The crying... Wtf!? 😂🤣💀☠️
You have such a big heart ❤️! I wish more people in this world were like you! I am on disability and am in the hospital quite often. That means I am sadly around lots of sick and dying older people, and one time an older lady was crying in the bed across from me talking on the phone with who she thought was the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA), but it was a scam (a very famous one potentially, that later actually had a rare happy ending where Indian police arrested a whole operation). This was before this scam operation was partially taken down, but as you know you can never get them all… She thought that she owed money and had a warrant for her arrest. She had just gotten out of surgery and was in extreme amounts of pain, along with being incredibly inebriated from all the medication, she barely knew which way was down, but the extremely aggressive and confrontational way they yelled at her on the phone (I could hear it she had the phone so loud) was absolutely sickening! She explained while slurring her word that she was in the hospital, and instead of having an ounce of sympathy they tried to take advantage of her. I stood up and wheeled my IV poll towards her, slid the curtain a tiny bit, and signalled to her by moving waving 👋 my hand in front of her glazed over eyes without invading her privacy. We had talked before, but I’m not quite sure for how many days, as we both were medicated into lala land, but we got along well. She moved the curtain so we could see each other’s faces and I still remember her glazed over bloodshot tearful eyes… This absolutely enraged me even more! It clearly was a scam and they were heartlessly laying into her knowing full well by the way she was slurring her words and crying that she was ill and an easy victim! I signalled with my hands not to say anything more, along with saying  “don’t it’s a scam!!!” If I remember correctly. She immediately handed me the phone to my surprise as if she was wanting to run away. I proceeded to berate the scammer about how sick it was trying to extrot a sick sweet old lady! Maybe it was my medicated voice or just the arrogance of the scammer, but he still tried to convince me in a threatening manner that he was the CRA and he would have us both arrested! What gall! I chewed him out some more, and what really sickened me was he then realized the jig was up and proceeded to boast about scamming “racist rich white Canadians of their money”. That comment stuck with me and left such an incredibly bad taste in my mouth!  For me it’s that our authorities do so little to prevent these scams from going on! They really just don’t care all that much, and the pitiful amount of money the government and law enforcement spend on preventing these crimes is just abhorrent. What little they do spend is used solely on some PR sting operations that do little to address the root causes of the crimes! The spend almost No time or money on creating programs for prevention, awareness, and systematic solutions that identify and stomp out the methods and routes these scams use… Oh sorry they sometimes use the free access to the media to do a pitiful amount of awareness and out reach that does little to help victims, and is often only after people have been scammed for thousands, or even millions!  Thanks to you and my experience I have decided to step up recently, and spread the word to the community of sick and disabled people I interact regularly with due to my health. I have managed to stop the odd scam, computer hacking attempts and a few other scams from affecting the wonderful people in my community, and it’s in large part due to your videos and huge heart ❤️! I love you man! You are fighting the good fight!  I wish I had the energy to start lobbying for the government to step up and address this problem head on! Maybe ones day I will be well enough to do so! Or if others take action now I may not have to!  Keep up the amazing work!  Thanks again! And thanks to anyone who read the ramblings of mad man like myself! Thank you!!!!!
We all love you ❤️😚 for this great job bro justice for the ordinary people..
Granny namechecks Post Malone 5:00 r/whoooosh on the scammers
you guys are bloody good! Let me know if you need help with it
Respect for all the good work you’ve done!
We thank you alot
I absoultely love what you do, you are incredible i get those scam calls and the indian accent give them away i curse them and thry hang up. lol
Justice for our elderly!! Yeah!!
I'm sorry but anyone that falls for the " Hi, this is Mike (enter last name)" with someone who has a strong Indian accent is gonna fall for anything. I've always called them out on this till they hang up on me. Hey "Mike" why do you sound like you're from India or that general region, "How do I sound like this" Well Rashid you certainly don't have an American or any other accent do ya Achmed, hey by the way Hashmir where is your company located Amit? with this I have started an infinite loop of calling them a different India, Pakistan whatever name till they hang up on me.
😭Lmao the singing 🤣 🤣🤣👌
Simply just stop dealing with anyone with an Indian accent. Problem solved.
ur so pretty as a woman!
Thank you for your great work!!! Good luck!
OMG. I seriously got a happy tears and goosebumps to see her arrested. And I had no idea you two had collaborated! What a beautiful marriage of skill. Wow. You guys I hope are going to take this far and wide. Perhaps some way to get citezens as bait volunteer in a safe way to join together.  Omg. Take this industry down! Ty for your AMAZING work sir!
You are incredible.  Thank you for all you do. Glitter Bomb was an added bonus.
firs time watching you and I can tell you are a great guy, thank you for keeping an eye on vulnerable people
Awesome man.  Keep at them.  I get calls all the time and try and waste their time, they get so annoyed.  My dad would have fallen for these scams if the family hadn’t kept on at him to watch out and treat all cold calls as scammers.  It’s time India did something about this awful crime.
Ya got ‘em!
When I worked as a teller at a bank we had a lady that called the police on us because we refused to wire 40k to her "son" in India.
Please post their faces!!!!!
E
This is pog
Wonderful job. Keep up the good work. God bless
The world would be so much better if folks used acid instead of glitter.
Thank you for all that you do!  These scammers are the scum of the earth preying on elderly people.  I don't understand why our government, with all of its "capabilities" will not shut these people down.
Your a good man. Thank you.
3:39 why does the signature on the orange background says "Pierogi" 🥟? XD
Thank you for all you do sir! it is about time that someone is fighting back against those who do wrong. May God bless you and your family. Keep up the good work. I only wish there was something I and many others could do to help you expose these human vermin.
Our government is too busy being woke and brainwashing everyone by using fear.
I put my dad under strict orders if anyone calls up and says you owe money. Say you have to speak to me daughter. Then I get on the phone and have my fun lol
Why not show the scammers face
We should form a organization something like Anti porch pirates or scammers, Because These people aren't getting enough punishment
My legs are hurting really badly😭😂
Scammers spoil the name of India😔
All I wanna say is, I'm ashamed to be an Indian. Those thiefs need to get a real legitimate job.
Lol funny thing is he can sell that probably and make bank
Had to subscribe,  you had me at the picture with the blonde wig & bright red lipstick.   ( I'm 70, dye my hair blonde but you wear the lipstick LOTS better than me.. lol) Oh & I love you (had to laugh at that too)
12:14 anything stand out to anyone there???
your doing a bloody good job mate and you and Jim deserve a Medal
Thank you! God bless
I'm so ecstatic that you and Mark Rober and Jim have teamed up to do this!!! I love both your channels (so does my 6 year old daughter :) ). I've been my family's technical support in regards to scams (over 60 people) for quite some time and that number has grown outside of my family throughout the years (especially over the past 3 years). It all started when my parents got scammed for over $20K when I was 16 (over 20 years ago when they did scams over LAN lines!!!!). You all have inspired me to do more though. thank you for the inspiration!!! Please keep these videos coming!!!!!
You totally rock ! Addicted to watching you and all that you do to protect those out there who don't know better.
You are doing a great job. I am not good at this but my record is 16 minutes. That’s 16 minutes they could not hurt someone else. Great work!
Please go to India, no one has really done this yet lol. Great work BTW
🙏🏻❤️.  The glitter is fun!
You guys are doing yeoman work helping fight for Americans who struggle to make ends meet then having these people from India rake them for their monies! Thank you.
keep up the good work
Dude you're awesome man this is the greatest s*** I've ever seen
my bank account cannot be   accessed by computer......i pay $3.00   for every paper they send me....so worth it.....
Thanks, bust their sorry asses!
Noble cause.  Just brilliant.
I am so glad I have ran into your channel, I am with you and your cause,
Why blur out these scumbags faces?? They should be exposed
So well produced! Been watching your videos from older to newer for the past couple weeks and the progress is awesome to seeing
Fight crime with glitter, I love this!
wish you could help my friends they are pensioners and got scammed for over £65,000
Why do you blur the scammers' faces. How will we recognize them if their faces are hidden? Isn's it fair to put them to shame for scamming innocient persons of their hard-earned money?
"Ok I love you..ok I love you granny." lmao
Proud of indian
great work
Well done to you these people are the scum of the earth who prey on the most vulnerable people in society. So it's time they got some payback, keep up the brilliant job you do
I found it hilarious at the end! when recipient got out of car to face that police officer, with jeans still sprinkled with glitter!
Awesome vid!  Glad that person got caught!
The shot of the cop talking to the dude while covered in glitter 👌
Why block out their faces?
One question: Who is stupid enough to believe that a man with a THICK East Indian accent is named "Steven Williams"?
What can the average person do when they get a scam call, to mess with them
They can detect anti-plandemic posts that go against their whole coup-vid19 narrative but can't detect this or child trafficking
It's double u not dablue Lmao
"society needs to wake up"
i love how he says i love you and they casually just say i love you back
amazing collab
I want to start a business with you... I'm looking at creative ways to fund us. Please reach out to me...
You are a musketeer of the modern world protecting us.  Keep up the great work!
🚫🍍🍕 😆👍👍👍👍
“no no no more France only Texas.” I’m literally dying from that-
Glitter marks the criminal..lol.. Wonder what a cop thinks when they see a glitter~bomb after~math.. 😂😂 ✌🎄❤🎄🤘
You're doing great work out here. I can only hope that, in lieu of the law seriously cracking down on scammers, you keep informing and inspiring people to combat scammers.
You vids are epic.   And I share with any one. And everyone how these people do what they do.
Jim Browning sent me to Mark Rober, and Mark sent me here.
if the caller has an Indian Accent yet introduce him/herself with american or english name, automatic a scammer
I love using up scammers time. I'm from Minnesota so I lay on the super thick "Ope, fer sure doncha know" old lady accent. hehehe
‘Scuse my language, but, you’re a freakin hero.
That was freaking awesome. Your a pretty smart guy. God bless
I wanna know the aftermath of that woman after being busted by police.
If I work at a store that ships stuff through a nationwide carrier for people should I be looking out for older people who are shipping out similar items?
YOU are a hero!
Thank you for all you do.
I love this
What a modern day hero!
This guy is an adorable Santa’s helper I want one 😂 LOL
Sad thing is, you just got the mule. The kingpin will never go down.
You guys are awesome! Thank you for helping us hard working victims!
It breaks my heart when they take advantage of the elderly who are not tech savvy and vulnerable to these schemes.  Thank you for what you do!!
Big hug From France. 👏👏👏
When I saw the title I thought Joe biden got payback.
What you are doing is applaudable...👏 Please keep up the good work...
I always love these videos. Super informative and interesting, and entertaining.
"You have to help me or I lose my job". That's some special reverse psychology there. In this day and age I can't believe people are foolish enough to give someone who contacts them their bank information.
If only more scammers got glitter bombed maybe there would be less of them.
If only more scammers got glitter bombed maybe there would be less of them.
😂😂😂😂I love that you give them what they deserve you are really awesome 🤩
Why hiding the face!?
Scammer Payback, you are doing God's work. Much respect!!!!
Have you ever given some thought of going after some of the crypto scammers on youtube?   I know the cardano foundation has money that would support your efforts if you took up the challenge...  i've suggested funding you on other crypto sites....  thoughts?
There should be a movie made about you 3 guys,' the revengers'.
I honestly love how different you guys are and that's why this works. Pierogi is an actor, he is a comedian, and a bloody good one at that. Mark Rober is like a super villain but the goodie, he basically could probably blow up the Mars if it was threatening the Earth. And Jim, ah Jim <I'm not swooning, you're swooning!> is a master mind, super sage who holds a protecting hand over us. This is why it works so well, superb video from all three on this subject and honestly, you have inspired me and my husband to do something for the victims of scams in Slovakia and Czech republic. So thank you, thank you for all you do, much love from Slovakia.
Thanks for all that you do Vivian 👍
You are amazing. God bless.
♡♡♡♡♡♡
I can't believe she put that stink-spraying package back into her car. Wow
Finally some real revenge on those thieves!
Mmmm delicious payback
The grand finally would be dropping a HUGE glitter bomb in their offices in India.
Thank you, Sir!!!!
YOU ROCK !!! Great job and keep them coming.
Thank you for doing this. Someone close to me gets scam calls every day. I have given her tips to help not be scammed but it enrages me that this is allowed to happen and seemingly nothing is done about it by law enforcement.
I’m sorry in advance if my comment might offend anyone.. If I pick up a phone call and someone is trying to “help” me in anyway with a Nigerian or Indian accent, I hang up the phone..
Really appreciate the work you do my man.
I’m against scamming that’s a problem in itself. But maybe we should help tackle the real reason they scam, it’s the most typical job readily available to the most poor and ppl in general. There has to be something we can advocate for, better education or free higher education. It honestly starts with the ppl advocating for better laws in their country and outside ppl giving support. Otherwise scamming will keep on going. At the end of the day it’s a job and it pays…
Mark River is awesome guy and so are you man great video
This was incredible. Good work to you all!
Love what your doing keep up the good work!!!
Great work guys!
This is Gods work. Keep it up.
Whoever is deploying glitter "bombs" should really talk with an attorney before continuing the activity. Don't have one, call your AG's office, ask to speak with an attorney and tell him/her what you PLAN to do and ask for an opinion.
Love From INDIA
Unlike politicians, you are fighting some ruthless bastards.  Congratulations.
Good job thanks
Scammers are horrible I agreed 100%. But how can people be so ignorant and gullible? It mind blows me how people with thousands in their bank don’t think twice with money. Just oh yeah I’m going to pull out $20,000 casually from my $150,000 savings and not think “wasn’t I originally at $150,000 before this weirdo called” I know banks give receipts and atms do the same. Not that difficult to keep track of a bank account physically then thru online services.
It’s crazy how they scam people with money. I know a lot of people I’m around who don’t have much money and even if they try to scam them  they don’t fall for it (ex:my grandma ) she used to get scam called all the time never fell for it. So difficult for me to imagine that people would just go pull out thousands of dollars without a second thought. Elderly  or no do you not keep track of your bank? If you’re getting scammed for $50k or $20k wouldn’t you check your bank and do the math, off of your computer and in person at the bank? Like come on if I had $100k in my bank I’d be watching where all my money went and how much I got 24/7 throughly.
Extra snacks for the dogs who can smell cash
Salute!
I cannot believe people do this kind of things like sending money in boxes and let them talk that way when is customer service. If someone talks to me like that would talk to the manager or I just hang up very easily. I don’t really get this situation it is just out of my mind and people believe all this crap. However you Peirogi are and amazing guy and if I would have the knowledge to manipulate computers that way I would have done the same thing because it irritates me when people wanna make easy money lying and stealing when we all of most people work hard it doesn’t matter if you are rich or poor this is wrong the way the wanna make money 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🙏🏻
It's funny how many resources the feds use to catch certain crimes, but they don't seem to care much about this type of crime. Maybe I'm wrong, but I doubt that I am. If an independent person on YouTube can do this much, the feds could easily shut this type of thing down. Why isn't it a priority to stop these scumbag lowlife's from destroying elderly peoples lives? I believe it's a bigger deal to stop these evil scammers from stealing peoples livelihoods than stopping someone from growing some weed. This type of thing needs to be completely stopped.
The police should use the glitter bombs to catch thieves all over the world
This is my kind of vigilantism
Could you get a guy on opensea?
Wow, you are great!!! Thanks for fighting these creeps!!!
This sounds silly but works to confuse, distract the scammer. Answers to their questions with silly, bizarre things, e.g. can you cook fish in a dishwasher?, I just stabbed my husband/wife & blood is on my white carpet, how can I get it out?, my kids just jumped out of their bubble bath & are running down the sidewalk can you help me?, or any other strange things you can think of. Use the appropriate tone of voice for what you say. You'll throw them off their game, they won't know what hit them. Another trick is to use one word answers, e.g. yes, really, no, now, why, how, when, what, where, seriously, super, fabulous. . . We usually get recordings & they do not answer back.
Thanks!
The major corporations like Microsoft, PayPal, eBay, Norton, Telstra etc don’t care.  I receive a lot of scam emails and I can track them back to the source.  I have provided proof of scam to said corporations, with geographical locations, maps, even phone numbers etc.  Nothing gets done.  I usually receive another email from said Companies on how to avoid scams!  It really is quite infuriating.
I love this
Unfortunately, the person was probably let free anyway
I'm Diggin' Pierogi's new fit!  Cool camo jacket = badass... very nice. Grey beanie = very hipster-chic, love it. Weird "guy from U2" serial-conversion-van-rapist yellow tint glasses = eeeehhhh,...... not so much 😐🤔 But hey, you are a real life superhero, so I think we can let them slide.  LOL.  Keep it awesome, God bless you Sir.
You are a great human being for unselfishly using your talents and time to combat these despicable scammers!

Do you have recommendations for folks wanting to learn to do this?  Where would I start?  Some programming classes?  Is there a preferred language?
This was the most satisfying video ever. Now please get the main scoundrels in India.  Just subscribed.
He should replace the entire useless fbi
Thank you man for your services
Gods work sir.
Dear god I'm going to have nightmares now of you dressed as Vivian. Also I want to Thank You for all you do to protect people. My dad gets these kinds of calls on a daily basis, luckily I'm able to help stop it as much as possible. My dad really doesn't understand a lot anymore and could easily fall for this. He has multiple myeloma and the chemo treatment he had gave him chemo brain. Needless to say he's gotten better with not falling for this but every now and then I need to intervene.
My son, a cyber security under graduate, wirelessly takes control of the scammers computer and switches off their mouse and keyboard! You are heroes for what you do. How much money have you saved potential victims? Thank you
I can't believe that most of the scammers are from India we promise we didn't know about it before I came across your channel m
You are awesome guys! More power to you!
WILLIAMS! They just love using that name!
You should post a tutorial video showing how to do what you do so there could be a massive army of people doing it to scammers and hopefully reach a point where they just can't make money doing it anymore.
You guys are doing great work. Thank you so much for all that you do.
Thank You!
We love you three amigos !  Keep fighting please !  We need more of you in this darkened world.
Thank y’all for being on Earth 🌏 with MEE ✌️🙃🙃🎶 Keep up THEE GOOD WORK !!  n OUTSTANDING JOB for being on THE FRONTLINE against lowlife Humans 😖😠😡🤬😤 Sincerely  👽🛸
The thumbnail looks like the elephant toothpaste.
My grandpa got scammed by a Norton scam
Legends
Imagine having watched the earlier glitter bomb videos, and then being subscribed to pro gay, and seeing this! Oh man, that would probably be so cool.
I want to help soooo much!!!!  Teach us all how to help❤
Good work sir 👏thank you from the world
Bravo 👏!!!
not even gonna lie you rock that makeup dude
I love this :)
These people have been harassing me for over a yr now. They are calling my dead mother with her info. I don't know how anyone hearing that accent and fake phone manners falls for this! Sometimes I play with them, and sometimes I just tell them off and hang up. They call back once or twice every day! I can't stop them!
YESSSS
Send a glitter bomb directly to the call center. Lol
WHY IS THE SCAMMER FACE BLOCKED???
Are you saying they can access our computer just because we answer our phone?
HOW do they get on someone’s personal computer?
Glitter is bad for the environment you block head
The new and true justice league, you guys are the best.
You three are amazing. I wish you could do a workshop and teach us how to do what you do so you can have an army of scambaiters.
Go to the store and i will not cry 😭.. the glitter bomb is so awesome
Go to India
I always get a phone call or a voice mail from the bank or from a loan company saying that I own them like $70,000 dollars i'am not even old enough to have a bank account yet like😒
This is an incredible, amazing, huge accomplisment, effort and  end result to capture the scammers. Thank you Mr. Peirogi and to those that.helped you capture this person in this video episode. Bless you, thank you very very much and be safe.
cool blue hair:)
I'm 65 years old, I get 3 or 4 scam calls a day.  I don't even answer my phone unless it is family calling.  they are "nonstop" calling. thank you so much for your videos, they teach me how not to be scammed. God Bless you, your family and crew.
Well if they deposite actual money in ur account have ur friend call ur bank and tell them to pretend that they are u and  Verify that's real money and have then  Immediately lock that account where nothing can happen to the account boom u scammed the scammer onces its locked go close the account and open a new one
People power ! Well done 👍
Wow I live in Pearland this actually looks like the exact area I live these SOBs are all over the dam place
Amazing!!!!!!
Who falls for this???  It's hard to feel bad for the victims.
Thank you for helping to stop these evil people who take advantage of others
My aunt almost got scammed while she was having a hard time mentally dealing with losses in the family. They got access to her computer but luckily she realized her mistake and shutdown her computer. They were not able to get any of her bank details luckily. After she had to get rid of her computer since they had access. She canceled internet to her home after that as well.
From a Former Submarine Veteran you guys are true patriots, God bless you all
This was amazing!!! You are doing gods work,!
Me and my wife where nearly scammed out of money. They said they where Norton. Needless to say if they email you that you owe money DON'T call the number back until you know it's not a scam.
Glitter bomb is GENIUS!
If you contact me I have some scammers I would love to give you and let you have some fun with.  It's amazing how long they will talk to a 9 year old to try and talk to me.  I love wasting their time.
How do I get a hold of Vivian? She was hot!!
I told him he needs to use military grade tear gas instead of fart spray
Steven: crying  Granny: “I’ll call u after the party” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You are a HUGE smile, and hero to many.  GOD Bless you!
You are a legend
21st CC: THANK YOU!  THANK YOU! 🔥🤣😍🤪😉😛🙃😍😆🤣
No words can even begin to describe how much everyone appreciates the work that you do. The world is a better place with less people like those scammers and more people like you. Thank you.
Thank you Sir for all that you do for us!!!
Good for you.  You’ re so great !
Steven Williams from India, Riiiight. Well done.
Now send one with mustard gas or something radioactive upon opening.
Oh man, using the glitter bomb to catch scammers/money mules…def need to do more of these :3 this is great! 👌
Tell them "bhenchod
We need more people like you!!!!
She gets out of the car, with the glitter all over her clothes!!  Wouldn't you think she'd change clothes, before she went anywhere?!  Forget, "red handed."  She got caught, "glitter--handed!"
Justice is served with a side of glitter!  I love it!
I love Vivian! LOL 😂
Love what u guys do! Been watching these channels grow. Thought it was so funny to see other people messing with scammers. I do it too. Wish I had the hacking knowledge to get into their systems. I would not be nice. Seeing the glitter bombs going to the scammers was a wish come true! Don't hold back. They don't. War on scammers. Send em some bed bugs. Those things are horrible to get rid of.

It's just as bad in Canada, same as the US and others. 18 years or so we stopped our mom from insurance scam that was even advertising on tv.  Scammers have been around for ever.  She was looking for other insurance and asked me what I thought, told her NO-NO  hang up.  They were eventually taken off tv, too many complaints.
So what happened to the mule? Were there any repercussions; jail; fine; anything? A criminal record?
That was awesome!
My elderly step-mother was convinced to take out $7,500 from her bank account and overnight it to New Jersey to get me out of jail. Of course I was just fine on the West Coast. The scammer convinced my step-mother that she could not call me to verify I was or wasn’t in jail.  My step-mother went to a Mailing store and when asked what she was sending overnight via Fed Ex my step-mother said $7,500 cash. The rep told my step-mother that was not legal. My step-mother went home frantic and worried about me. Luckily, my step-sister finally saw an alert on her phone that mom had withdrawn the large sum of money and went to her house.  My step-sister put the money back into the bank and put restrictions on the account to only allow mom to withdraw $500 maximum. Thank you for getting back at the scammer for all those victims that were not so lucky as my step-mother.
Dude.  You're a nut.  When i saw you in drag I about fell out of chair.  I love your work.  The FBI is too busy chasing down parents at school board meetings.
I wish I could help you financially but I will continue to send prayers.
Jim ain’t no ordinary guy tho, he’ll be why they got arrested and you and mark make it a giggle
I'm so excited for my next scammer call.... I always mess with them for as long as they'll keep me on the phone. Unfortunately, they usually hang up after a few minutes...
dublu dublu dublu
Their accents really thickens when they're mad, huh 😂😂
7:07 what language is that!? 😂
Go after dating scammers
I cannot thank you enough for all you do for the scammer's victims..I get calls every day!  Today was a package in customs. So I press number one and then I get someone with an Indian accent ( I have traveled many times to India, when I was younger and lived in London.) so, I tell them that the customs authorities do not outsource the work to India...and then I tell them to stop scamming people..Others tell me that they will come and arrest me, to which I answer: Go ahead, I just bought myself an AK47....Then they hang up cursing me..
We need more good men like yourself thanks for giving of yourself
do better
great work
How was he crying 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Such a bullshit actors. I used to work in tech support too but these guys are really Assh**e.
Crocodile tears..🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Subscribed 100% 👍 Thank you for your services sir.
I like that you use your talents for good. I wish I had the skills.
Thank you SO MUCH, Pierogi, especially during this season of what's supposed to be celebrating and giving!
Awesome work my friend!!!!🙏🏽💕
I don't get this. If you have these skills, why are you a good looking dude? Aren't you suppose to be severely overweight and have general awful health and a glorious neck beard? ....please don't hack me. 3:32 - "Dubla Dubla Dubla Dot" 😂
This is heroism! Thank you Sir!
What more can we do to help? Is there ANY possibility that we can set up some sort of foundation, or whatever, to help these victims get some of their money back? I've got ideas, so does my husband, but we'd like to know if this could be done.  I hope that you see this, Pierogi, and reply back to it. God bless each of you for helping those victims.
I wish I can put a million likes for this ! You are my new role model, I wish if I was like you!
Aahhhhh, catharsis.
Outstanding!!! Both you and crying Steve deserve academy awards, lol. Great work, man!
Thank you for helping and enlightening us common people. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼. Glitter bomb is too good for them.  These people who steal should be surprised with some stinky dark liquid that is difficult to wash off as present.
Why you gotta pick on Macaulay Culkin? Is he not as human as the rest of us? *shakes fist at heavens*
I saw that before learning about you. That was awesome. I love the one with the sunk smell 👃 that was Awesome. Great 👍 work. Stinky stink. Yuck 🤮
Keep up the great work. I love your channel and I love @Mark Rober. I don't produce video content, but LMK if you ever need an extra voice (to troll scammers or just spread the word).
Awesome.  I knew a lovely old Guy Pucky, in ST John, he gave all his money, because he thought he was securing his children's future.  When he finally figured it out, he was penny less, heart broken, died of shame and left his wife in poverty.
Good job 👏
You missed the perfect opportunity to put a cat in with those cat treats! I mean come on who mails a shoe thats just ridiculous
On behalf of all those who have been scammed (Moir), thank you thank you.  It’s about time the scammers started to fear getting caught & ... convicted.  That would be good.  👍🏻
Love this lol
Thank you for what you do
How about 'Windows' calling because your computer is sending out error messages and they want to take control of your computer to 'fix' the problem.
oi, how hard is for browsers to make the developer tools unavailable for websites where critical  information is displayed?
WE LOVE YOU PIEROGI!! YOU ARE AWESOME!
YouTube sucks!!!
GEEZUS ON A DONKEY! I ALMOST DROPPED MY PHONE WATCHING PIEROGI WITH MAKEUPS AND WIGS ON 🤣
You are super hot super smart and awesome. I love you. 😻
Dude your like a real live super hero!!!!!
✨✨✨✨👏👏👏🥳✨✨
You're beautiful anyway, but as a woman... Wowee!  ❤️❤️❤️ I'm a man but came over a bit "funny"  😂 😂 😂
Well done boys
GREAT outcome guys.  Keep doing the work in bringing these scammers to the forefront.
I watched Kitboga for the longest time, though it eventually just got too depressing for me to keep going. I always loved his green screening and silliness. I do like that these other guys do directly interact with actual victims and stop them 💙  Also, I genuinely love that Mark’s glitter bombs are being weapon used for good now. I kinda hope he switches in this direction with them, because the porch pirates have started treating them like an awesome thing to find and a goal.
I bet she’s still vacuuming up that glitter
Its a great thing you do....
why are you hiding there goofy faces....
Great work,getting the word out, , 👍👍👍👍👍this kind of scams need to stop,👎👎👎👎  so keep up the good work peeps, 👍👍👍 I will be sharing ur vids to Facebook, so I can get the word out too,  👍😇😷🌍✌💝😷😇👍
Why a glitter bomb? Seems like a party.. A paint bomb would be better.. Esp the one that doesn't wash off!
you should scam  scammers.
You’re doing… God’s work…. You are doing the world a great service.
And this is why I don't  do electronic banking . Neither in my computer or  my phone .
Someone  hacked into my computer  and  they wanted  me to give them  my computer information  I had to pay them with a bank debit card for them to unlock my computer.  Because  while I was on the phone with them  they locked my computer.   I didn't  give them any information  I shut my computer off took it to a computer  shop where they unlocked it.  Now every now and then I get an alarm  alert telling me that my computer  will be locked if I don't  call the number on the screen  and not to shut the computer  off cause it will automatically  lock.  So press the shut down button  wait a n hour or 2 and my computer  is back to normal  . Had a given  them my debit card number  they would've  wiped me out of 60,000 dollars.
Great video, what horrible people they are but thank you for helping the helpless!!
What's unbelievable to me, is how naive and ignorant people are even after all these videos being on the internet, and they still get scammed that just baffles my mind 🤔
Mad respect man. Keep it up
Is Vivian Rodger's single?  Asking for a friend...
I think you are a hero, of sorts. You are helping a lot of potential victims. And having fun while you’re at it.  It’s a Win-Win. Except, of course, for the scammers. Sad, so sad.
THANK YOU!
🤯😊😅😆Best "ScamPrank" Yet.😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤔😂🤣😂🤣😂
Do more of these! Its been over 08 months!
Thank you for standing up against those people. Nice to see someone takes them seriously.
I'm not sure what's worse, the emotional manipulation or the entitlement of these scammers.
- glitter - fart spray + incendiary device. these people have harmed thousands of seniors. I for one would shed no tears at their end
You are an absolute hero! It makes me sick that these scammers target people, especially the elderly who don't know any better. they ruin peoples lives and steal peoples entire savings! It is disgusting. Thank god we have people like you, Jim Browning and kit boga to help combat the evil done by these horrible people. You are a modern day superhero and I thank you on behalf of my elderly loved ones who have been scammed in the past and wont be again because of the amazing information I now have for watching your videos, to pass onto them so that they are not scammed again! Thank you for all that you do!
Amazing !! Spread the love..!!
❤️❤️❤️
Glitter bomb could use an aerosol fabric glue spray just after settling. *a flame lighter could make a nice statement also.
Did they lock her up? I hope so.
This hearing impairment (since childhood,) has been a blessing in disguise because I honestly cannot entertain anyone not speaking clear unaccented English over the phone, I always hoped their calls weren't serious because of my disability.
Thank yall so much
so if they can see you looking at the screen what happens when you open up you know the little thing that shows you the HTML file you can click on it and then see what they've changed what happens oh that'd be a great video you like old lady and then you go over the corner and open the that file it's like it shows that you you changed this number from 42,000 to 52,000 this number right here is is what it was you changed this to this number
all the person has to do is refresh the web pages and it undoes everything the person just did.
pierogi..... IM WOKE!!!!!
She got pulled over but was she prosecuted?
I hope these scammers have the worst fate on this earth n beyond.
This chap deserves the highest possible recognition for what he is doing.
Love it! Let's do more!
I would be: You sent me more money? Thank you! Goodbye!
I love you for all you do. ❤️😘!  Thank You!
It would be awesome if you went to India to shut down scammer call centers.  You could make a television show about that alone.  I wonder if the Indian law enforcement authorities would be willing to help with a project like that.  Perhaps one or two corrupt officials may tip off the call centers, but it would worth the effort.
I've had this happen too,but I turned off my hub,so that I could kick them out. I just put it down to spotty Wi-Fi.
lol
Man I can't thank you guys enough for all you do! God bless you all keep up the good work. Score 1 for the little guys and girls (victims) out there!!!!
How can I help? I got scammed a year ago and I can’t stand this
I have no mobile banking on my iPad. And no email on my phone . Norton 360!. Also unknown callers are sent right to my voicemail! On Robo Killer
IF YOU WENT TO INDIA YOU NEED TO RECORD EVERY MOMENT, HAVENT WATCHED IN A WHILE BUT KEEP UP THE GOOD FIGHT
luv ya Rogi
Geek Squad doesn't have a refund company.  It would be through Best Buy Corporate.  Good luck getting through tho, the 20 yr old call center kids are prob just as bad as some of these scammers *le sigh*.  You're welcome.
can u tell my corporate job to stop using call centers in Calcutta to take care of our Corporate HR Federal Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and have the power to deny "just because".  I don't trust them bc of this ish.  How do I know who was a scammer beforehand? I don't  .
We love you Vivian Rogers 💟 😌😂
Wait, Pierogi? 😄
Yes more bombs and go to India!
vivian cute
Saying Pierogi in that old lady voice sounds adorable
Ahahhaha good stuff bud 👍
Can you please get these scammers they call me so many times up to 17 times in 2 hours sometimes
I was scam drefrenlu 😭
Thats not good idea sending that.. You should include greetings a HAPPY BIRTHDAY... BOOOOOOMMMM..😂😂😂
I would use tairgas in that trap🤟
Very nice work.....I love it when they try to put the top back on...Priceless
Respect. You and your colleagues are true heroes!
Please, I need help to come after scammer that call me every single day
How I love the glitterbomb concept! Thank you so much Pierogi for all you're doing.
Love from India
I'm about to retire and I would love to help spread joy and deliver some 🎁
Yes to see the police giving final justice is the only way to slowly stop these mules. The word will spread fast that way
I would lie to see you go to India and get those bastards arrested , I enjoyed watching him getting arrested
I wish my family had help like thus for my mother. She was scammed and lost everything.  Her savings, home, and the stress from  it all took such a toll on her that now dementia has set in. So eventually my sister and I will lose our mother completely.
This.is.amazing!!
IMAGINE: Pierogi: *puts 500 into notepad* Scammer: *adds two 0's*M Pierogi: *keeps adding zeros* Scammer: Oh no ma'am! We sent you 500000000000000 dollars, we have no money left plz pay us back or our families will starve :( Pierogi: Haha, good. Thank you for the money! *leaves*
Raises a concern of authenticity for me, because once she is out and be confronted by authorities she can be recorded without any filter. There is no expectation of privacy in public and she isn’t in a private sector anymore.
Epic!
the scammer was a lesbian xd
Wow. She was in Pearland, TX. Close to home. Was there any news coverage on this?
HEY KEEP TELLING THEM THAT YOU DO NOT SEE WHERE THE MONEY WAS TRANSFERRED SINE THEY CLAIM THEY CANT SEE YOUR SCREEN
It improved her boring a$$ pants....
He really does need Jesus.Disgrace
Same exact footage from Mark’s video. Lame.
This is right outside my neighborhood in TX
This is beautiful,  now how can the law not stand behind you, Caught red handed glitter and fart spray in hand. Mark cut down on the count down yes 20 seconds, but wow the anxiety on the wait I have no nails now.🤣 Keep up the great work this scamming BS has to stop.
Keep it up!!!!!
The character voices are all fine and dandy for entertainment value, but it would be nice to know if they would try to scam you in your regular voice.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😍🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pierogi, thank you for fighting this and encouraging others to do the same. You really are changing the world. You are an amazing person, and I am so grateful for your diligence in helping all of us.❤
Finally some comeuppance! I don't like Mark's videos because the thieves never get arrested, but this finally gave me some satisfaction.
GOD Bless you for the work you are doing friend 👍
Pastor Malone 😂🤣🤣

3:31 “ Dublue Dublue Dublue”
Just wanted to say I love rodokiller   I was having so many spam calls and now it has stopped. I have used the old grandpa one. So much listening to the voicemail.  Thank you for working hard at trying to stop is.
I had romance scammer convinced i had a 401k of $400k i was going to take out and give him.  Except i needed $40k for tax to take it out.  He kept asking for ny bitcoin wallet....but i kept telling him to put it in a book,put it in a box,wrap it in foil,and mail it to me.  After 2 times going in circles...he finally told me off in some crappy african language that im sure was telling me he knew i was working the same angle he was!  He thought i was another romance scammer like him!  I called from blockdd number to prove im a real woman...but refused to video chat.  He was going to blow his cover of pretending to be a white guy....i told him my number us private (which is real) but he got mad and said he never heard of that!  They dont know people can get blocked numbers....or mark private on their phone
I hate when someone says "oh I’m great! I did this a this. LOOK AT MEEEE"
Vivian is hideous. 😆
What noble work you do, makes me want to cry myself.
Love watching videos of sending bombs to houses
Pure genius. I love you Pierogi
Awesome Keep going bro
Keep it up MAN 😎🙌🏼
Scammers really think hell is one big party with gay spiders and catchy show tunes :/
Lol.. I dint raise u that way itseems.. 😂😂😂
I watch your videos every day. I bring it up in conversation, it’s cool to see someone as dedicated as you are to actually bringing justice using a platform like this. I hope you do get the love you deserve. Keep on being you 🙏🏽🔥
Dubloo dubloo dubloo dawt, that shit is always funny 😂
I use a air horn to troll them
Mark Rober is the best
THANK YOU SO MUCH.  My roommates are both from India, and were talking about how awful scammers are. They target victims in India as well. Scammers are a cancerous part of society. Glitter bomb them all!
respect ... big big respect for what you doing ...
My dad said if it’s a man trying to scam me to shout PEDO PEDO WHY YOU CALLING A LITTLE GIRL YOU PEDO and I did and he hung up
Can you explain when you do it with your own bank..... how they don't steal your actual money? X
Keep spreading awareness brother
❤️💙❤️💙❤️
Come to Kolkata, I can take you around! These scammers are sick SOB's
“The one, the only… MORS MUTUAL INSURANCE” nice ad spot bro 😂
13:14 why’d he have a phone recording thsi?
I love this guy a huge hug from me bro for being so concerned rip these scammers off.
You know I find this absolutely annoying if you guys gain access to their computers hence that means you can gain access to their bank accounts why don't you truly switch the tables on these individuals and clean out their bank accounts and then turn around and give it to the authorities so it could be giving back to the victims you guys make no sense I understand what you're doing but if you have this technology and you know how to do it if I knew how to do it I would most certainly be doing it and I agree with you it's horrible that the government isn't doing squat about it sometimes you have to step up and take the role of government!!!! And let's not get started on a lackluster government but yeah guys if you really and truly want to start helping people it's a simple suggestion you guys obviously have contacts within the FBI the local law enforcement at the state level I'd hit them I'd hit him hard!!!!!! Seriously let's think about this what are they going to do call the cops highly unlikely
You're doing incredible work! Thank you!
Hahaha.... that was epic. You are doing great work, you are a blessing.
Bro just dont blame India.. Many of the scammers are calling you from pakistan and bangladesh.
His crying 😂😂😂
The greatest in when they tell me that my Windows PC is in violation and they need to fix the problem. The first step is always “please start up your windows desktop”. I tell them, “okay, so should I do that before or after I trade my MacBook in for one?” *click*
What you do is godly my boi
Love the busted azz nails Vivian is rocking😂
Very anti-climactic. You spend more than 12 minutes with the set up, only to barely show any results. What happened? Did she get arrested? Give us some details.
It’s because of people like you that allow the rest of us to wake up. You give us all a very welcomed and well deserved rude awakening. We all need to wake up to this. I thank you for exposing this. I am a former police officer and if I can ever help you on your journey, count me in.
You guys are awesome
Canada is doing something about it in their country.  However, the USA is not.  Probably because we defunded to much of the police!
Wow so satisfying seeing these scammers get caught !
When he was singing congratulations 😂😂 oh God I love Pierogi
I saw robers vodeo earlier today. Great collab!
you look pretty dang good dressed up like a girl    haaaaa  haaaaaaaaaaaa
You are awesome
9:37 looking awesoome
The female at the end of the video was right down the road from me.
I got scram for 200 dollar because of these people and tbh ima one day just pick up the call again and troll them.
We need to crack down on scammers who got $$$ off me & my sister through bitcoin would be nice to get them.
I hope they added the fart spary
I don't understand why you hid her face.
I used to work at Best Buy and stopped 3 people from getting scammed further. 1 was an elderly woman who came in to buy gift cards. I told her this was a common scam and she thanked me and left. The second was an elderly man but he got upset when we refused to sell him $1000 in gift cards, even after explaining the situation. The third was a middle aged women. She broke down and started crying when I told her about this scam. She sent several hundred dollars already, but it honestly could've been a lot worse.
What if the glider bomb also had a message to turn themselves into the police and confess to their crime?   The uselessness of the police is very disturbing!
Destroy them all  please. You have my respect
Still I don't understand about putting 4000 $ instead of 400$ plz someone explain inn brief. 🤔
Keep it up!!!
Great Man....I loved it ...Protect it I m with u Guyzzz
This is SOOOOO stinking amazing!!!  What a sweet taste of victory to see law enforcement able to step in and finally get some vindication for all these victims; and all you guys with your amazing baiting tactics.  THANK YOU for doing what you do!! Huge fan over here in VA! :-D
How did you do that 3D Text?
“I love you too Peta”
Pierogi crush❤😍
India is getting a bad name because of these scammers ....
Is that his actual bank account information he's letting them see on screen?? no way right... he's obviously a wizard with computers and he has forged all that to make it look real correct? Anyone who's good with computers can give me any explanation as to how he's making it actually look like they have access to his bank account and how all this happens in real time? Is he actually giving them access to his internet and desktop?
Please please don’t go to India, your doing great wotk
These scammers are acting at Oscar level 🤣 🤣 🤣
Thank you, we love you.
Mark truly is a chad
They say “super heroes “ don’t exist. BULL. We’ve got Perogi, Mark, and Jim! Together they F’ing ROCK. Bless you fellas, truly.
🙏🏾✌🏾🐜God Bless Family🙏🏾✌🏾🐜
We love what you do!  Stay strong
Giving them all what the deserve a giller bomb with some very nasty smell of fart spray & skunk juice & the mouse glue handle & lights & sound in glitter bomb 3.0. For glitter bomb 4.0 this year needs to by all 4 mouse glue handles & maybe a little dirty kitty litter mixed in the glitter for a smell of cats & more heavy on the fart spray & skunk juice in the fart spray & a 3rd nasty smell added in & 8 cans of it giving them both scammers & porch pirate what the deserve.
What happens if you get happy when they say they’ll lose their job.
I wish I had the skills to do this. I would devote my life to ending this shit.
When he starts singing Post Malone🤣🤣🤣
This is amazing!! Thank you for creating such great content and teaching us about scammers!! I’m just wondering if the glitter is eco friendly..? 🤗🤗
Omg!! This is fn great!! So happy to see this!! I literally love you and everyone who are trying their best to stop these scammers.
God bless u guys , awsome work,  screw these assholes
You’re the best pierogi 🥰 so smart , helpful & handsome 😍💜
Thank you for committing to this cause
This video is so cool 😎
I am fairly lucky to be living in a non english speaking country.  Nearly all of us do speak english but the elderly usually don't speak it that well and even if they did they would know that someone calling them that can't even speak our language is obviously NOT really a trustworthy person.
This stuff makes me wanna cry because about 1 year ago, my grand mother got scammed out of 8 thousand dollars because she thought I was in jail and needed bail money to get me out of trouble and they sounded like me. It kills me. I wish I could help her out. Get these bastards Periogi
Your like mr beast brother
THE SCAMMERS GOT SCAM NICE WORK SON!!
The fact that a Steven Williams has an Indian accent is already a red flag 🚩 lol 😂
Those thumbs down are from scammers
Very respected .... using your knowledge ... on the good path .... i wish i have that knowledge .... BE SURE ... that u will be rewarded by ALMIGHTY .
Pearland police this is in Houston
LOVE IT‼️You are GREAT. KEEP IT UP. NEED TO MAKE THEM TASTE THEIR OWN MEDICINE🥰🥰🥰.
Helooo, I would love your help on something. I recently got scammed. It was so stupid I'm ashamed I fell for it. But now that's over with I would love some sweet revenge. 😇 It was Through instagram I gotten their IP address thanks to YouTube that showed me how but I lacked the skills to do more. Let me know if you can help. I hate that these people are tricking other broke college students like myself out of the few cents they have. Pleaseeeeeee help me!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thanks for you help
India supports you bro , we are very very proud of you : )
Yeah and fedex was supposed to stop delivery of a certain package to the scammer but it didn't....FedEx delivered it anyway...so they're part of the problem.
I appreciate yall stay bless
A superhero with tech 👍🏻
They got me with an IRS scam saying I owed the irs over 5000 dollars but I could settle for 500 or I would go to federal prison 😂.
It’s maddening that red flags don’t go off 1. Hindi accent  2. Access to computer  3. Send cash in Mail 4. Wrap cash with plastic wrap and old clothes.  5. It’s 2021 how does any “lonely adult” fall for these calls and email bates?
😂😂😂😭😭
Awesome!!!
It's a great job you are doing 👍👍 I wish the society and law wakes up and get these People to book.
I don't know if you'll get this message at same time I send this but I'm actually on the phone with a scammer but there doing it throw Facebook messanger
Dubloodubloodubloo
This scam won't work on Karen's
No no no no no no no. You in the outfit. No no no no no. 😂😂😂😂
i once got a scam call that my social security was stolen and used in criminal matters, so he asked me to confirm my last 4 digits of it, i said 0001, then he said i sound young (which i do cause i was 15) i said i had a lot of plastic surgery. then he saidi would go to jail if i dont cooperate and i was like "NO, I CANT GO BACK THERE" LMAO then at the end i waslike "hey, hey..... where do i live?" AHAHAHAHHA
U LIGE IN PEARLAND?! ME TOO
hell yah get them all
LMMFAO YOU LOOK LIKE JANE WHITE HAHAHAHA
That was awesome!!!
you should do a video where you seem like you’re in debt and have no money and see if they continue 🤣
Although I understand what you do ....for the good of the public and victims... using glitter bombs is irresponsible.  You realise that glitter is single use plastic that is killing the oceans , nature and in fact people. We are now breathing in masses of micro plastics ....ingesting it too... ...and this causes cancer. It is as dangerous as asbestos .  Glitter should be banned now.  Theres many things people dont think about because they are too wrapped up in fun. Humans always refuse to face fact until it's too late ...they are notorious for this.... Even Balloons are the same and will be banned .... ....as people release those in sky , and animals end up choking when it lands on their ground.  Its ironic people release hundreds of balloons to mark a death , yet cause thousands animals to die.  No one ever think of what happens to all this lLITTER at the end ...... Theres no logic in using stuff like this.....glitter is a killer....and it's no joke. Very few people THINK about what they are doing.  Please stop this ...and show you care. The earth is far more important than us ......
Had anyone actually sent the money?
ALMOST 2 MIN VIEWS
Love it!
excellent haha teach them fools a lesson
I've been following Jim Browning for a while and only recently I've started seeing your, Kitboga, Scambaiter videos. It's so embarassing to say as a fellow Indian that these things are carried out by my countrymen, by illiterate boys and girls who can't even speak proper English to deal with the victims, probably learning the language and the softwares as they go along. I have known a guy who used to do this but I don't know if they still do. I asked him one day, in front of all the friends how he did the scams and stuff and he was shocked and embarrassed 😂.
Dude you’re a hero bro, keep it pushing bro
we love your support for us. once one of my family mamber get scammed and i was trying to find something and then i found you. you are the real life hero.
The best past is ...MOM PLEASE...lol xd
I have a problem with a scammer that appeared on armslist advertising guns for sale and the guy scammed me out of over $800 by providing the name and address of a legitimate ffl dealer in Columbus, Ohio and by providing me with a legitimate fedex tracking number. How can I find out who did this and if not get my $ back at least get them arrested? They have an alias with an email address and phone number that they were texting and calling from. They also had an authorized zelle account they used just long enough to get the $ then shut it down. My bank won't do crap about it. Neither will the A.T.F. I still have all relevant info with email, screenshot txt messages, deposit records....etc....
Is there a way you can teach us how to get these scammers so we can be a team and take them down one at a time
The people that disliked are most likey the ones that contribute to being the scum of the earth
I bet she pissed her pants when that timer started counting down.🤣🤣🤣
How can i scam scammers myself?
You guys are angels. The devils minions need to be stopped.
Thank you for the explanation at the beginning, now I understand how the phone scam works!
Jesus Christ love you
I was once 15 years old, getting ready for school, and a scammer called me. He demanded me to pay something, and after speaking with him, he asked me why I didn't pay my bills....I then revealed I was going to school and that my parents pay the bills. The scam office started laughing at the guy who rang me, and I think I heard them agree to take my details off their system, because I was underage.
Love that you are doing this. It is so frustrating that government is not doing more to catch these disgusting people.

Hi good collab
*When a STEVEN WILLIAMS has an indian accent, drop that phone call ALWAYS.*
my freind got scammed and his bank even said that he got money and he couldn't do anything.  I'm new to this channel so is there a way to get in contact with u possibly if this happens again.   we r in Australia btw
Love that you do this!! They are calling me, I’m 32, looking for old people that need life insurance, so sick  😡
Love you brother ❤ from India🇮🇳🇮🇳
He looks like he had too much fun dressing up as a girl

Why cant we just bomb the exact building
Dabludabludabludhoottaneedeskdhootcam
Couldn't I just keep the cash the scammers send?
Thank you for what you guys do!
Incredible video. Keep up the good work man.
There's no way Microsoft isn't in on all of this
❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍
Thank you man for giving justice for a lot of people but also please do be careful because you're dealing with bad people
God bless brother
Imagine if that was elephant not glitter
you're awesome, all regards from Saudi Arabia
Where can I get that gbox ? I need it for my neighbor who keep stealing my fashion nova.🥺😁
The scammers got what they deserved.
i was hoping they would bring it home set it on their kitchen table face up and fling it everywhere
Huge respect bro. cheers from srilanka 🥂🥂🥂🥂
I wish you guys can get more bad guys to Jail. And for long term inprisonment... So that there would be one less scammer everytime.
They scammed me took my $1600 AUD
How satisfying this is right here. Thank y'all so much for what y'all do to help others. Much Luv ❤️💯🙏🏻
Has anybody heard of a CPS (Child Protective Services) scam call? I got an automated voicemail saying someone reported me to CPS and needed to call and pay the "auxiliary fee" - whatever that is - from a divorce settlement. Not married and I don't have kids. Just WHAT?
I haven't been a victim of any of these scams, but I really appreciate that there are people like you who help others.
i would send a scammer more than a glitter bomb it would be a diarrhea bomb
welcome to india brother  we are all with you
This is amazing and I hope people can share this with their loved ones to support the process of stopping scams. I hope this project brings awareness to those who need it and so glad there are people out there helping to stop such horrendous acts.
I love that coraline hair
Thank you! 👍🏼
5:05 I never knew I needed to hear Vivian sing Post Malone until now🤣 5:12
It’s cool and very enjoyable to see you team up with the best of the best with you as the best.
"deploying package with police noises and fart spray and glitter... But with real police dispatched at the scammer" I was like "oh it's just police noise" now it's like "police noise but with real police dispatch"
Lol.. Ty ..keep up the good fight.. 😘
I have had so many voice mails on my cell about 'purchases on my Amazon Prime account.'..... I don't have Amazon Prime and I'm paranoid about keeping track of my purchases and my account.
Nice costume, I liked the video 😂
Thank you for rep'ing Mark R. BIG DOGG ENERGY. IM WIT IT.
Thank you!
Yooo
Vivian lookin' kinda nice 👀👀👀
Thanks!
You are awesome brother! I just found your videos and thank you for everything you've done so far...
Well done sir, very very very well done!
Underrated content here. This is great
"It won't get there by wednesday perhaps, ... because it's not the Bronx!" LOL
I can’t believe people do this, they scam us , sell ur info, take ur bank acc password , scam u again and much more.
That's why YouTube needs more people like this not just for Entertainment
You looked a little too comfortable in drag.
You guys are good guys the super heros of the internet I'm glad you have so much support good for all you guys
Thy are hungry bro I get calls 5.6 time a day fukin tired
Be nice to learn how to hack the scammers call centers so that we can get even , can't we upload a Trojan virus on there servers that would destroy there drives on all the computers in the call center?
"You preseed" oh my lawd I can't stand the bad English.
I'm from India and i don't know but i feel bad..you guys are making the world a better place and those scammers making it worst.. I hope for the best...you guys will win and the end..
as an indian whenever these types of call comes I just say f you and then casuallly decline the call just disrespecting them nothing new in it..
Also, let's start calling these scammers and humiliating them to Oblivion. Make it to the point that these punks start committing suicide because they cannot handle being called all these names and being treated like the pieces of scum that they truly are.
It's time to pay back these scammers by using their families as tactical collateral.  I have official Indian government seal stamps in the names of ram nath kovind, Narendra modi and at least twenty other high-ranking Indian government officials. I have also mastered their signatures and even obtained Indian notary seal stamps in their names. Not to mention having their addresses, birthdates, Aadhaar numbers and other identifying information.  If you need any of these to sign away any property in India or renounce the citizenship of any scammer or their children, just let me know and I will send it to you. I have a friend who works for a company that produces custom rubber stamps. It's time to start making these punks suffer!  Let's start giving India paybacks like none other. Start calling random citizens in India and tell them if they don't pay up, they will have their citizenship renounced, and that of their families as collateral.  Let's show this godless, unholy, anti-American, toilet deprived, terrorist state who their boss is.
I never thought scamming is so entertaining. 🧐
Expose the face.
why does this sound like a documentary…
You are my hero. Fr.
Well  done you make it  look easy but its  not, but the end  result makes  my day, love the  end  result  glitter bomb in the  car ........lol takes  hours  to  clean the car after  one, its  everywhere ..Well  done  guys love  what u do and  keep it up!!!
Nice that a police man got someone
Remember Sr that the capacity to fight this scammers with tech like you, is far from common, so, I believe that the best strategy against them is to team up with everyone that has such a high computer knowledge, so you get organized , and this would eventually provide battle plan capabilities, that one alone could not do .
more support to channels like this on youtube. thank you so much for your work and for posting it. translated the main points to family members that do not speak English to explain what they need to look out for and what not to do.
i am a F R A  AGENT IN MY HOME TOWN I WOULD LIKE TO BE THERE WHEN IT HAPPEN I LOVE TO BE THE ONE HAND CUFFING THEM  AND YOU ARE THE BEST IN THIS
You are doing a great Job, you are saving many innocent victims.
1k 👎 on this video means 1k scammers have watched and are thinking twice.... i hope.
You guys are the hero!!!👍Thank you🙏
Fantastically awesome. Thanks for doing it.
Just an ordinary spoon here
you are awesome!  keep that forever in mind!
Thank you for all your hard work  And please keep up with this catching scamrs in the way you do. Love to you and your family
👏👏👏👏
SURE MARKED THAT ROBBER
Thank you dude! I've been tortured by these guys a couple times when I first got my computer and came within a hair of losing money to them. I can't tell you how satisfying it is to watch you in action. Is revenge porn a thing?
Why censor the scammer's face?
God bless you keep going
HIGH FIVE AWESOME JOB KEEPO IT UP!!
NOT ALL HEROES WEAR A CAPE!! YOU GUYS ARE BRILLIANT!
Mary Swanson.. nice.
I just Rick roll them it's so funny
Poor "Steven." I could watch this all day. Send this useless stain to jail and I can guarantee you he's going to be crying!
I want to learn how to do exactly what you do..  Once enough people fight back they may close up shop for good.  Who knows right?  The sad part of all of this is our government could stop this but just do not seem interested.  It’s a sad reality that 10 scammers can sit in a room any where in the world and rob people blind daily yet nothing ever happens to them.  How could this be?  There is no logical answer to this question.  Governments of the world could end this quick yet we are all on our own.  Go rob a gas station of $112 and go to jail.  Sit in a room and rob victims of hundreds of thousands of dollars and nothing happens….
Love the dramatisation..cuz this is really a big crime!
To get them guys,stay safe.😇😇😇😇😇😇
The dislikes are the scammers!
Thank you, God bless and stay safe
Thank you!!! You deserve an award....and much more.  Be well.
So, do you think all the downvotes on this video came from India?
I love Vivian!!! She needs to receive an award from the MENSA Society for her brilliance!!!! G-D bless you and all that help you. May you be guided by the Almighty, Abba HaShem.🙏
if i hear an accent i hang up
Awesome video editing!
Got my support  and admiration
hell yer
Really appreciate that dude you are doing an absolutely great job
I'm a retired US Army Staff Sergeant and would gladly join you in this fight!! I'm dead serious!!
I have received several calls from Amazon and I reported it. I know it is hard to track
You are great
Ahahahaha I bet those scumbags learned their lesson next to Big Bubba in the prison shower
Well done bro!!!! 👍
I saw that City name on the police car and was like 😮😫😮😮😮
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I hope and pray that you are successful. may the God of all glory bless your work as you help to keep people like my 94year old mother in law safe.
Well done mate great work
Thank you for doing this!!! Honestly you are awesome for showing this criminals that we do have brains over here. I've talked to a few of them when they call me and they are so low, and so ignorant at the same time.
How can I get your expertise to save myself from online scams? Could you please guide me to the skills required?
Since I found Jim and others, I've started answering scam calls just to waste their time.   Because I know it costs them money and while they're on the phone with me, they aren't harassing some elderly person.   You aren't alone.   We are here and we are trying.   I direct everyone I can to channels like this.   I know it's a drop in a bucket, but if you get enough drops you can fill an ocean.
Thank you for saving elderly ppl
Steven William my ass lol
You shd not hide their face
Its awesome you have the skills and gumption to run these reverse scam stings.
I WSH i could be apart of this i want to do this myself! i have been a victum of this almost twice. ppl dont realise the scary things ppl can get access to. they ruiend a LARGE portion of my life and i am still digging out of that hole. again i cant thank you enough
Not surprised Indians and Chinese are involved.
You make a very good looking lady. 🧖
These scams depend on Americans being "nice guys."  People need to start saying "Sc**w You! I'm keeping the money."
996 people who hit the dislike button suck at life
Good on You mates Much appreciated.  True  blue
I gotta go to the potty🤣🤣
What happened with her? Was she put to jail? Or what?
So did she get arrested?
This was in Pearland??  I'm from the next town over!!
Vivian was so adorable wrapping that package 📦😍
Dude I love your videos man, keep up your fight. I wish I had the skills you do. Because you are a legend man.
BUSTED👍👍👍👍😉
ty for your fighting for us victims.when i lived in my old apartments i had 45.00 dollars worth of pizzahut stolen.i got my money back after a very heated chat with pizzahut.they gave my food to the wrong people.they did not understand why i was very mad.i dont understand why cops dont do something like what you guys are doing.stealing is illegal the last time i checked.ty
I came to this video because of Mark Rober's video. And I went to Mark Rober's video because of Jim Browning's video. All of these videos are about scammers passing victims around. And all 3 of you are talking about maybe going to india.  Is this a scam? Are you guys trying to get a free trip to india?
Wow these scammers are real douch bags
God Bless u... U are an Angel with no feathers and sometimes overdosed make up...but u Sure ARE making this world a better place....
I love your hair color! I want to do blue like that.
I lost $700 this summer on a puppy scam.  I had to take out a loan for the puppy. Don’t ever use Zelle
I love you! Mark Rober too!
Awesome video. You guys are heroes, for real
Hello,,,,,,THANKYOU for all you do ,making us safer and educated,,,,,,,,they call us in the great white North too ,,,,,,,,they call me so often that I can’t answer my phone before making sure I know who it is,,,,,,,,,,,they even called me while I was watching your show once,,,,,,when I forget to look first and get the ,they scare me when they get really personal ,,,eg: asking if I’m the only one at this address,   God bless you,,,,,  🌬  💨 🕊🙏🏼🕊🤍🇨🇦
Thank u for caring
My aunt once got a scam call at 3 in the morning, it was just a recording of a woman screaming when she picked up, she panicked and yelled her adult daughters name thinking that she was in danger, a masculine voice clicked in and said ‘if you don’t send us $15k we will kill *daughters name*’… luckily the voice was poorly done and very robotic that even being freshly woken up she was able to tell it was a scam… It’s terrifying what some scammers are doing now a days to get money….
Why is the lettering on his cap the wrong way round?  That makes me think this is not from scammer payback.
Your amazing proud of you Chanel friend
How can people hate this.  Oh they are probably thieves.
Would love to see a quad sized glitter 💣 explode in the middle of a scam call center and spray the scammer with skunk fart spray.
This is awesome work guys..
thank you for fighting these scammers. i have stopped, how often i already got wrong handybills from these kind of peoples
markrober who?
I didn't do it sir !!!  The glitter on your pants says otherwise!
Have you ever just said Thanks for the 4k?
Quick question, why do you blur up there faces? Let everybody see who these piece of Sh** people are!!!! Like i said just a question....
Beautiful
I'm so glad I subscribed to your page.
Love your channel my guy. Subbed, and support coming soon.
Wow 987 dislikes must be them scammers.. 😁😁
I had to pause video to take a scam call.
Pierogi, stick to your day job. Lol
The Texas is a middle man yes
this remind me of inception you make them believe its them in control but really you made the dream space
I am from India and was scammed once and it was only after watching your channel I felt like I was even with the scammers.thank you so much for the wonderful work that you do.
Bruhhh the glitter is CRAZY.
awesome job
Much love and respect to you bro keep up the good work God bless you and your family 👊  Kia ora (Hello) from New Zealand 😊🤜🤛
nice going gentlemen
Dude thanks for the laughs please post more videos ahahahhaha i am so 💀😂😂😂
I would be so proud to be your momma!!!
Omg YOU AND MARK ROBER????  I love you both!  ❤️❤️.  Today is my lucky day!
Someday, somewhere, someone with the technical skills like you guys but with no restraint will end up killing or maiming a scammer with a bait package. I think, although highly illegal (I’m referring to booby traps), I think that’s what it’s going to take for this crime to abate in the US.
Thank you for doing what you do
You should keep deleting their files 😂😂
You R the MANG!  I got scammed a month ago  $1500 out!  Thank you   Thank you  For what you do to these low life fucks
PEARLAND POLICE. WOW! I WORK THERE! WOW! CRAZY🤔😬😱
When the scammers are on line, is it possible to send a virus into their system.
Whoa! I thought Vivian was the real Vivian, but then saw she was played boy Pierogi! Striking resemblance!!!
If the home alone boy can't take it... no one can! Even after shave....
Sad part is if the police in India doesn't do anything, this will continue!  Just too many stupid people that fall for this, plain and simple.  Once these scammers get prosecuted, put there names up, so we all can see who these CRIMINALS are!
Besides the obvious scam centers, I think also Anydesk and remote viewer companies dislike or report your videos (and the ones from guys like you doing God's work). Otherwise, there is no explanation for not liking your work! You all deserve a medal, not a Youtube demonetization or strike with their vague explanations.
imagine scam someone
I love you and your work!!!
Thank you for what you do.
This "crying" guy is disgusting urgh
You are doing such an incredible job. So intelligent and funny too. Thankyou
glitterbomb ? it nothing. just children's toys, not a deterrent to the scammer.
Vivian Rodgers is Hott.
Hello my dear fellow! Great work, truly inspired. Just a suggestion, it would be extremely satisfying if instead of glitter you could package up A LOT of dog poo in the bombs. It really would be awfully sweet of you. 😈 Xxx
Thank you.! I was scammed just as COVID hit. It hurt me big time. But you have educated me . Knowledge is power.
Thank you
I love it and hope for some more content like this
pity u couldnt just send a bomb not a glitter bomb !!
Hell yeah bro that’s awesome I love the videos!!!!!!
Thank you so much for what you do, I used to work in an old folks neighborhood, it was a large neighborhood  in California, they call it Champaign village. There were so many scammers that stole so much money from my customers and I would just take it so personally, I didn’t care what time of day they called me I would rush over to their house and I would take that bug off of the computer so that nothing could take their money. Everyone who worked with me saved their money there were some that didn’t because they were embarrassed and I’ve seen people lose thousands! I just can’t describe how much I appreciate what you’re doing, because this really got to me. These were all people that had saved this money for their whole lives, they weren’t rich people in this place, some were a little wealthy but a lot of people they were just living off of what they saved when they were younger and they had a pension. This is just a horrible crime! I’m just I’m so proud of you thank you so much and thank you Vivian lol
I love the glitterbombs :-) Thank you for fighting the scammers.
♥ ♥ ♥
Respect. 💕❤️
You guys are the reason  scammers getting caught!We all appreciate what you guys been doing!We all thank you for your amazing talent!You guys are the hero helping those helpless elders that needed the help.
Incredible video
Are you polish?
Outstanding!!!!!!
it's because of you and the other channels that do this.. im not as computer savvy.. but when i get calls by any scammers of any sort.. i stay on the phone and waste as much time as i possibly can. on average.. it's usually about, at minimum an hour... but it goes longer then an hour 99% of the time...
You’re all heroes 🥰
Ppl like this make me sick.. I once had someone brag to me that they cleaned out someone’s retirement fund doing shit like this. I knocked his teeth out and reported him to the police
You should be paid by the government to do this.
freekin crybaby  he's a faker    mommy,?????????????
Steve williams... an indian englishman
You're not "just three guys going after scammers"... you're the closest the world has to a real life Justice League. Awesome work :)
I wish you could get a scammer for me...hit me so hard and ruined me
Wtf man this shits to ___________!!                                Your thoughts here
THANK YOU…..go get them…..
good job, get those scammers good.. Love your videos..
All scammers suck and take advantage of nice people and the elderly! I now wish I had your skill to catch these creeps or at least make them want to quit!!! Thanks for all you do!!! God Bless you!!!
Oh my god the scammers acting skills are terrible when it comes to crying
Are you doing the new Southern California Edison scam?
Bro, you are my flippin hero!!!!!!!!
Wonderful, thank you!
Great Job.....I know a few scam call centers and would like your help to get them to pay for scamming people
Thank you.
Looks like there's 969 scammers that watched this video and gave it a thumbs down LOL!
Fantastic job Sir! 👏
The package thefts have reached norway too. You cant trust package dellivery services or even our own postal services.
So why exactly do these people need support from viewers?  Great work you do but surely you can do this without donations etc?
Many are not listening because or your semi~ nasty language, take it from an old timer‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
The biggest scam recently for me was someone calling claiming to be with the social security administration requesting my information social security number date of birth ect. saying there was a warrant for my arrest i simply replied if you are with ssa then you can tell me who my case worker is they got extremely nervous we can not do that we can not do that and quickly hung up the phone i seriously cannot stand a scammer call better to block the number than even answer the phone
why is it so difficult to bring these scammers to justice when you can provide evidence?
I have been to a point with these lying, manipulating, heartless evil jackasses, that I was ready to stomp my phone into the floor and never have another one. There were days I would receive no less than 14 calls and it never stopped. I love and respect all you guys who have taken it on yourself to stop this mess. It's a shame the billions of $s these scammers make off of our older ppl who do not have that much to live on anyway. So sad they have no conscience at all and really scare ppl into giving them what they want. Even more sad to me is the fact our govt doesn't care, if they had they could have stepped up an done something about it long before now.I so hope they find you guys in some way, I truly doubt it if not maybe just maybe they will. Any way please don't stop doing what you do we so need this. Keep on keeping on we love you.
That was so  awesome!!!!!! Great job brother.
Top man
Absolute legends
We appreciate your thoughts  keep it up from brother... And please reply me back anytime May be I can help you ...
It mind blowing to me that this has not yet been label a natural emergency. Why has the US not limited trade with India. ( and any other country at the head of this ) why is the car Warranty scam still happening in the US. The warranty one is based in the US 🤯 like why is the phone land scape so bad right now.
Love from india
OUTSTANDING!!!
There is a town named 'Jamtara' in India which is known to run these scams all over the world, not sure why don't govt interfare.  These scams are increasing day by day in India as well. Even I also got such scam calls in past and there was a time when I was ready to send money to a scammer 😂, but now I'm aware how this online robbery works.  These scams were known to people when a web series "jamtar" was released showing how online  scam works.  It must be a million or may be billion $ industry of scammers.
The first thing everyone should know is no company is going to call you to give you a refund you have to always call them to get it
Thank you 👍👍
Fuckin' Steven 😂🎉
Excellent
I really appreciate what you guys are fighting these scammers and educating potential victims. Kudos to you all.
This needs to be shown everywhere,  this needs to be on Netflix.  People need to see this.
This was incredible! Thank you!
Yes please go to India
I hate scammers but this guy is so cringy that i cant even watch it.
What a pathetic loser at 8:52 King of wimps
Well done... a modern day hero... for sure!!!
epic dude well done.
You are absolutely AMAZING!!!! All of you!!! God bless you for what you do!!! I would love to bake both you and Trilogy some cookies and brownies for Christmas.  You are a Godsend!!! Thank you for all that you do!!!
You are amazing awesome people. This is the first time ever leaving a comment but I felt obligated to let you know that we need more people like you  that care about the golabol/uneducated. Since the government cannot handle it im grafel for you. Keep up the good work.
a) don't blur out the faces of criminals; put them on blast.  2) put explosives in the glitterbombs.
great hair color! love it.
Why don't our banks or government do something about this.
Thank you for all the work you put into this. I’ve had to change my bank account twice because of scammers. Gotten so I don’t trust any phone calls that I don’t know the number. Guess I’m lucky they only managed to get $500 dollars from me on the first scam.  Nothing on the second. They totally destroyed my computer to first time. I had my lap top checked for any viruses cost me $200. haven’t logged onto it since, I’m afraid of them.
Bad choice on hair color, dude.  Bad bad choice.
I love this man you are truly sent by God to help all the people and not only elderly people they got me one day after I taken chemo medication so now I know better I so like little owl lol
thank you,,,,, my father got ripped off,,, is good  to see someone helping again thank you
Ah yes, J U S T I C E  Too bad their faces has to be censored tho..
I'm proud of you mate keep fighting those   low life rats scammers 💪💪💪💪👍
<3
I do not answer calls unless I see a Caller ID name I wish to communicate with.  Period.  I pay my phone bill so I determine with whom I speak.  I wish I could block #s.  I probably talk on my phone max 7 times per month.  Just because someone decides to call my # has zero to do with whether or not I speak with them.  Scammers are bottom-feeders and a total waste of oxygen.
How about a large bag of dog poop!
Viv needs to tell him to stop crying, or she’ll give him something to cry about!
Always remember to repent of your sins (sin is transgression of YAHUAH The Father In Heaven’s LAW: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, & Deuteronomy) And Have Belief On Yahusha The Messiah. HE Died and Rose three days later so that you can be forgiven of your sins!   HE Loves you! Come to HIM
So sick he got arrested
You're the best!
8:53 I can't stop laughing 🤣🤣
You deserve a medal. 🏅
Pierogi: "Fake refund company" Me: fakery fund company... sounds about right.
I hope your using eco glitter
💎💎💎💎💎💎
bro good one. thanks for putting time in catching this evil people. RESPECT
Thank you for all you do to stop these scammers! I'm in tears right now, thinking of how I'd feel if someone scammed my mother! I hope these scammers burn in Hell!
Your amazing please continue to do this... I hope they are behind bars for what they have been doing... Coming to India is not going to help coz these scammers pay a cut to the gov so they can continue to scam.. Please watch this series called JAMTARA on Netflix it's all about the credit card scams an organised crime 🙅💢
These people are really pathetic.
Wow you catch them man!!!
if u fall for any of this... u deserve to lose money
Scammers Slayers ! Our justice!!
13:58  wow she sparkles more than Jessica Rabbits red dress!
there are people here in india who scam us on a day to daily basis. scammers dont mind which country or wat the person is going through, all they care is money. wat the cyber police is doing abt these scammers who are out there n eating out of innocent people in india and abroad is to be seen. hope there is a way to fish all them out n give them a tough sentence.
India, the land of scammers. They put Nigeria to shame.
Fill the books with feces
Let's get the Taliban - seriously.. lets phuck them up -
What bluelight glasses are you wearing?
WHY YOU GUYS HIDING THESE CULPRITS FACE. IF THEY ARE THEIVES STOP HIDING THEIR IDENTITY.
🤣 that fake crying is way out there and his Mom comment. They sure mindscrew the old or disabled people. Devils
Why don't you let the Government of India know about this crap and let them take a legal action against them? This MF people deserved to be in prison for life. Good Job Bro
Oh shit, I live near Pearland
some 952 morons [as of 9/14/2021] disliked this video ? prlly, those a*holes are from the scamming country, i bet !!!
You are such a sweetheart. Thank you for all you do. You are my hero!!xx
I love how you screw them before they screw someone out of money. Keep up the great work.
Vivian is such a doll
Lol this guy's alright
The woman in America was stopped by the police, but the Indian scammers have still got off without any punishment
You are a genius!  What you do is greatly appreciated!  It’s also very entertaining and satisfying to see that the scammers are scammed. I love your videos. Keep up the good work! I’m learning a whole lot thanks to you. 👍👌👏✌️
hey guy!  I love you!  I was a victim back in the early 2000s...   I still am trying to deal with the guilt.  I would love to talk to you!
Is Vivian Rogers single? Daaaamn!
epic
9:30 i'd hit that
There’s somebody scamming people on Facebook I don’t know if you can do anything about that but they’re hacking peoples accounts and after you give him the information he tries to sell you the account if you don’t make a purchase for your cash guaranteed something it’s weird
I love this man 🤷🏽‍♀️
That s awesome, I know several people who have been scammed
I hope y'all are is using biodegradable glitter 🥺
Yall Rock gentlemen thank you for all you do to keep us protected and informed about these types of scams
Showing 950 thumbs down are also those who are "scammers" 😁👌 Your doing a great job SPB🙏
Rich middle class white men prank colored people of lower social classes
You are a white hacker right?
Found you via Jim Browning. Awesome channel. Subscribing.
Oh noz, my dildo i ordered was stolen.   Fuck 9-11, this is serious.  GD you are a modern day messiah to help save the Adam & Eve Dildos that are being stolen!  You are my hero!!!!!!
Companies also need to take responsibility here. If they didn’t outsource their customer services to India etc. It wouldn’t be so easy for the MFs to scam unsuspecting people.
The more you use your number the more scammers that call you, I have a Samsung Galaxy A50 and i hardly call anyone on it and I don't ever have any issues with scammers, point being that the more you use your phone the more frequent your number will pop up so be diligent on how much you're using phone it helps to keep track.
The end was so f kin GAY
Biden should instruct Modi the PM of India that it's happening under his nose.
I remember the time when u r under 50ksubs. This grows rapidly . Keep the good work going. Love from India
Thanks for what you do
Pierogi... You're re legend..
You, Browning, and Roper rock.   The good work you do is awesome.  Now if you could just stop those damn robo calls.
y'all woke me upppp a lot till the point I want to invest in a truck load of glitter bombs
lol crybabyyyyy
Not gonna lie, Vivian be rocking that lipstick colour.
you shouldnt arrest money mules, most of them are manipulated into doing it
Keep up the good work!!
I'm really surprised most people don't think, kinda weird that no matter who they transfer the call to they all have Indian accents. I would think thats a red flag for sure. Its not that its not possible for someone with an indian accent to work for these companies but when its all with that accent then its probably a scam. I would think for sure if its someone from the IRS calling, especially if they say their name is Steven.
well done!
Thank you.good job.i just subscribed
Thank you please keep this fab work up x
We would welcome u to India....love from India
The Indian accent does it for me.  Click...dial tone.  Sometimes being racist or xenophobic is a virtue.
Honestly, the only way to fix this problem is to learn how to fix stupid. And that isn't possible. It's terrible that these scammers do this, but it's only possible because the people they're scamming are incredibly dumb.
What happens if you don't  do anything and keep the "mistake money" ?
I don't have money to give but you have my love and prayers. Take care and be safe always.
WHY AM I THIS LATE FOR THIS COLLAB!!! YAWAAA
There is a email scam where you try and get a tour of a house and the scammer tries to email you and wants you to send them money and that they will send you the keys. So crazy how creative these people get huh? I was amazed about that guy crying on the phone wow! Thank you for catching the bad guys! ❤️
I had someone call me saying that my car tags were expired and that it was overdue. That they were going to pick up my car and impound it if I didn't the $5,000. A bunch of fees and you know tow truck and such. I played along as much I couldn't but couldn't contain myself. I don't even drive 🤣🤣
They called my mother before and I enjoyed every second🤣🤣 Have a man whom bearly speaks english yell at me and I simply telling them to f*** off and good luck next time. I also was going to do a 3 way call with the police but the b**** hung up😂😂...never got a call after🤷‍♀️
how can you disklike this video people are sick
Awesome Guy! Doing what the FBI should be doing! (they are too busy infiltrating patriotic groups and trying to convince them to commit criminal acts).
I say the ones in usa put there names address and let the people beat the fuck out of the scammer in the usa
Is it possible that the person that got glittered was just another victim in chain?
This should be a tvshow... best way to reach the right audience...
Loe your videos.  Give my best to Ms. Vivian
Awesome bro thank you for looking out for the little guy
😂😂😂😂😂
God bless you and yours! My grandfather was a victim to theses low lives . Thank you
Good job!
That girl is just a mule. You need to track down the lead scammers to make a dent in their organized crime ring.
944 twatwaffles to date. That's a lot of thumbs down 👎.  Loved the glitter 💣 package.   You guys are killing it.
I hope you hid your house well Cause with all the scammers u piss off u have to watch ur back pls
It's so weird that the banking services in the US are still that vulnerable. My bank won't even let me save the password in the browser, plus they actually require additional information when you want to transfer money, so even if someone got access to your bank account, they wouldn't be able to transfer anything.
We are entering the end times. What is right is wrong. And what is wrong is right. No one wants to help anyone these days. We all need to pray 🙏✝️
what happened to her?
Man u make a good looking older lady ha.  Great video ! See and people call hackers bad..... there are good hackers out there too!!
Is it just me or does scammer paybackblook like Adam Sandler?
I absolutely loved Vivian! Just a hint of a 5 o’clock shadow. But seriously thank you for all that you do, my father is 85 and recently he received the Amazon $400 unauthorized charge phone call his saving grace happened to be that he has tendinitis so he really couldn’t understand the heavy accent of the callers by the time everyone in on the call became impatient my dad finally said cancel my account I’ll go to my bank and stop payment to anything from Amazon.  As it happened that same evening I watched your video and realized that he nearly fell victim I called him immediately and all is well. Thank you for sending the glitter bomb, the most brilliant device ever conceived.
For the scam calls, I don’t even pick it up for it. I’m not going to pick it up nor hang it up. I just let them goes and eventually they will hang it up on themselves. Sometimes I get like 10 times scam calls per day which is very bother me. But I figure as long as I just don’t do nothing, it’ll probably do some kind of protection for me. They probably know that it’s not a good number something like that and never calls back…. Which it might’ve worked.
This is what i call saviors
Loool
dablue dablue dablue dot
Hello Mark.  Thank you sooo much for what you do to those heartless, soulless scammers in India.  I wish I had watched you sooner.  I am 71 years old, and have been scammed by somebody from India who wanted to fix my computer.  $400 later (which I could not afford), I had been scammed.  I enjoy your videos, and the wonderful service you are providing for innocent people like me.  God Bless you and may you enjoy good health, always, and a happy and prosperous life.
Luv  u soo much man
Your mom raised you well sir. Stay blessed and keep protecting
💪😂..👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Bro really great work🇺🇸 something new I’ve been trying to work on my spare time are a lot of these fake single women tricking lonely men into sending thousands and thousands of dollars.. The best I can do is take up their time
Thank you bro from all my heart 💘❤️💘
Your doing such a great job… hats off brother..
I was a victim of $2500! They held my computer  and wanted gift cards !  It was a lots of money for me! Thank you for what you do! I feel stupid for falling for their bull!
I am from India and these people are disgusting who are scamming people in India and all over the world .Welcome to india let's nail these degenerates together.
Why are you blurring the faces of the money mules? Because I wouldn't've.
The granny voice had me...
Your A Legend
The like and dislike section speaks volumes.
You are a clever & funny kid 😂
This is WONDERFUL! Keep up the great job y’all!
Pearland Texas... right down the road from me.
Lmfao. It would have been better if it had super more glitter
A Happy Ending !! I hope that the Police do run an investigation and start by tracking her social media and cellphone calls etc
Keep it up dude amazing video
Love you and mark a whole lot!  You do good work and make it fun in the process.
Why did they blur the face?
More please!
amazing I have many who are scamming
I know this isn't the point, but if you ever did full drag you'd be absolutely stunning! 😆🤗
I’d buy a couple for sure
You should let us buy the bombs you send to the scammers and send our money to kids
Thank you so much for your effort I wish I could help
Bloody scumbags, the lowest off the low. I salute you sir, go get them
14:27 we want you to show the faces of these scammers so that we can report them to the police
INDIANS ARE UNBELIEVABLE 😂
I hope U can come to India someday bro. Make they scammer die..
Nice man! Awesome! Thank you!
please go to the store ..... do not hung up the phone ................ _mom_ lmao
8:40 _Now thats some A class acting_ lol
I would put fine aluminum powder in a glitter bomb so when they open it it destoys computers
Great job. I want them ALL GONE
My parents were scammed like 4 or 5 years ago something about selling dogs and they lost 500.00 I believe!
Literally God bless you ! I never wrote comments but you deserve one...
Mark Rober videos are great
Honey wait hahaha
I'm kinda bothered that Jim Browning isn't in the title, but Mark is. Jim was the brains behind this whole thing.
A scammer called me and said I owed $670,000 from my house mortgage that I didn’t pay… little do they know I’m a broke college student living with my mom barley getting by 🤣🤣
Why u blur the faces
Respect from India 🇮🇳
If a scammer calls I ask them if they'd like to know about their Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.   I also heard but have not tried, "Hello caller, you're on the AIR."
934 dislikes are scammers.
Shoutout to the people who received extra then just dipped
Passable trans...wow!
I wish it really did blow up at the end
Quite possibly the most modest person on YouTube. Keep up the great work. The world needs more people that care as much as you do.
Thank you!! Are you hiring? My son is interested in such a job. He's on disability and wants to work.
I have shared you with my grandparents even though I have explained to them that these companies will never do this kinda of stuff. Unfortunately my brother was not taught about this stuff before they got into my grandmas laptop. I spent quite some time trying to find them though I’m not as well versed in these things as you obviously are. Both yourself and Mark do some great things in this aspect and they are always entertaining to watch. Keep up the great work hopefully it makes a difference.
Ty my parents got scammed by them
Love his glitter bombs!  BTW.. YOU WOULD MAKE A LOVELY GIRLFRIEND FOR MY BROTHER.  Great job...Thank you I'm extremely careful when these IDIOTS call and have a bit of fun to the point where they get frustrated and curse me out🤪 I will then educate my elderly neighbors on what to do when they get scam calls. Please stay safe  Survive PANDEMIC 🙋‍♀️😷💞😹
This is like the avengers of scam busters.
And what do you say about the absolute trash, low life who helps these scammers in the US?
On behalf of everyone who has been a victim thank you
I literally got a text from one of these scammers and I went straight to the point, called them on it, and then said, I will definitely let the FBI know of their concern,  bc they have been looking for them.  😅🤣😂 Never got a response after that.
Yo what the FUCK i'm from Pearland and never heard of this?!?
<3
Why did you Blur the face ??? They deserve to be seen by the whole world
Thank you so much!!!
I think you're enjoying being Vivian a little too much.  😘
Great work happy to see someone get arrested and keep up the awesome work and god bless every single one who is fighting this fight big respect for you guys
Screw storming Area 51, how about we start tracking down and storming these scam centers instead? God bless those like Pierogi who are the real heroes. Not all heroes wear capes...
❤👍🏾
"Da-blew, da-blew, da-blew, dat, cohm..." lol...classic. And, thanks for what you guys are doing. It's awesome you care enough to try and make people "aware."
What a great way to stick it to them. Thanks for everything you do
No, thank YOU for what you do! ❤️
I wish I had 100k to lose lmao

God Bless you for catching the bad guys!   If you out there get a scam call, try preaching the gospel! That’ll sort them out . Xx
The well mannered educated Engineers from India, works hard, puts 12- 14 hours a day at work, command good respect in top companies,  Whereas some less educated youth from India with get rich quick mentality, are becoming scammers and ruining the good image built by the well educated. Please don’t wait for some law and order to stop you, everyone can stop someone involving in such scam. These people don’t even understand law of Karma - because, on a mental platform people who involve in such acts are even below SHUDRAS. Because even Shudras maintain a certain order in the society.
Scammers disgust me. Unfortunately, this is what happens when you have a society of people who lack critical thinking skills and are uneducated & ignorant about the technology they've incorporated into their lives.
Word up: Hear an Indian accent, hang up the phone. See an unusual phone number...Don't answer the phone. Not sure and you are elderly?? Get your family to help you. NEVER GIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION LIKE YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER OR ANY BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER or ANY ACCOUNT NUMBER...EVER!!  EVER!!
You a good man... May GOD bless you and your family....🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
That fake cry 😂😂😂😂
no disrespect, but I found wasting their time has worked a lot. I say hello in different languages. I get 1 a month at the least.
Love what you do ! Also am intrigued with your ability to change voice and voice accents.  You are doing a great  job ! Well done. Strength to you and your friends.
What you need is 1000 of you to make a team working on scammers 24/7. You need to train us all around the world. That is the way to make a real impact and shut their scamming business down forever. The FBI and New Scotland Yard should be doing this job.
Lets go ..Amazing  ...
Fantastic job well done for getting these low lives pay back. A lot of innocent people have lots a lot not just money but emotional stress hope you shut all these idiots done and for their governments to do more to catch them. I love watching your videos thanks keep up the excellent work in helping catch these thieves from Australia
Your guys rock brothers.. thank you sir
You Rock?
Wish I knew all this a few years ago.
That was a good one get more of those glitter 📦 box i love it
Please come to India we have too many scammer
With this kind of people viewing your videos, would going to your local Congresswoman be able to bring more awareness to scams?  After all people in Congress love attention and these kinds of videos would make them hero and they will certainly want to be in one of these videos.
Could you make a video to show us how to protect ourselves online from not just scam calls, but online hacking? What should we be doing to hack-proof our phones and computers?
AMAZING!!!!!
Why disguise a criminals identity?
Amazing work.  Cheers from Kentucky!
This is the first time I've seen this. Thank you for what you are doing.
That's AWESOME !!!!
Wait!! What was the outcome?! Name them!
I'm in fb jail and can't share
I love when they call lol. I have them so pissed that they have threatened to call the police on me lmao
All I can say is Thank you for what you are doing. I am sure theses people watch you too, if so then why aren’t they learning. Let’s hope one day it will all end.
I love it
This is just FABULOUS! Thank you for being so proactive in keeping ones safe from scammers !   I WILL FIGHT  WITH YOU !!!!!   Lisa 💪 Myrtle Beach SC 🌴👙🌊
Wow
I'd like to see a scammer's face if I gave them access to my bank account tbh. Joke's on you buddy there's nothing in there
You make a gorgeous woman teehehehe now everytime I hear her voice I will picture this!!!!
Salute to you guys. You are doing an amazing work. I am an Indian and love how you are saving world from those bad people.
You need to add Pleasant Green to your team!!!
7:15 , "filliing"
“I didn’t raise you that way”🤣
Hey i wanna see Prahalaad open a glitterbomb!🤣the dirty bastard!
Omg this almost made me cry
“Here’s where we will see the emotional manipulation by the scammer.” Idk, man.  2 seconds before you said that; you told the scammer you loved him…
haha they alway say “okay”
He looks like the caucasian version of carryminati . I mean looks wise.  Appreciate your work.  Respect from Delhi
So the glitter bomb actuaally alerts the police too?
Superman? No thank you. You are my Superhero! 💪🏼💪🏼❤️❤️❤️
The glitter on his pants wasn’t from the bomb.
The easy way to beat the Scammer is not to have any money in your account
YOU ARE AWSOME BROTHER !! THANK YOU FROM A POLICE OFFICER IN TENNESSEE!! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK ! LOVE THOSE GLITTER BOMBS!!  SEND ONE TO JOE BIDEN AND NANCY PELOSI.  LOL.
You're the best you're cute fine bro. My grandparents aren't alive anymore but I'm glad I can protect other people's grandparents thank you
THIS - is golden!
wow! that's awesome!! I love it when you Collab with Trilogy as well!
Well done! 👏🏽
Wow, this one is NUTS. Who knew the scammers were so equipped to actually start melting down so nonsensically to get what they way?
Thank you all for what you do! God Bless!
I hear these kinds of calls at my job all the time and people always fall for it.
😂😂😂😂😂 the best mom plz
JANUARY 6 IS MY BIRTHDAY..  WHAT THE HECK
How do I become like you to save people from scammers.
We all know who disliked this video LOL SCAMMERS, HE WILL GET YOU!
I wish I had your skills. Can this be done in reverse to take the scammers money? And electricaly fry their computer ?
oh god, so cringey when they stat crying :)) aaaaaa
Blue hair.  Really
why did you  blur their faces
I can't believe I've only just started watching these videos. You're AMAZING. Seriously. Thank you so much for actively doing something to throw a stone in their path. I'm going to forward these videos to my grandparents because I think they do a really good job educating us about the lengths these scammers will go to. Such an ugly way to trick elderly and vulnerable and kind-hearted people out of their money.
Vivian Rodgers gave me Marilyn Monroe vibes 😍. This was a fantastic collaboration!
Thank you and the team
you can't do enough for those criminals but what you do is amazing maybe you are today's robin hoods. thank you
Just be careful when you go to India because they know your guys' faces and voices.
Brilliant!
lol, 924 scammers gave this clip thumbs down
People care, but the targets are the lowest intellect people you can find. I once took a report from a guy who claimed someone stole his email. He told me that he was expecting a 2 million dollar pay out and NEEDED his email. I asked what was in the email and he told me that he had paid an attorney 2000 dollars to process paperwork and he needed that paperwork. I told him he was scammed and he said, no joke... "Ah, this happened before."   You were scammed like this before? "Yes." Ok.   We can make all the laws we want, but when a person opens in email in TERRIBLE English and says "Yeah, this sounds like a good idea" you can't protect them.
I think it would be great after wasting so much of their time in messing with their heads, you revealed to them sort of who you are and that you were fake and phony and that you tied up their time, that would add to their head it gets well deserving. Or at least if you can delete their files.
You guys are amazing! Thank you for justice
LOL She had glitter all over her so she couldn't lie about it.  LOL  I love the fart spray.  I hope it got all over her house, car, clothes, etc.
Cracking vid , better than tv !
Why are the swindlers an Indian dialect of English??
Thank you for all you do. Thank you for trying. I HATE scammers!
get this to 100,000 likes
Why "Pierogi"
Bro. Not o ly can you save a lot of people from being scammed, but you can make a ton of money if you can get these mass produced with Mark to keep getting these bastards.
The government either doesn't care or can't legally do anything.
How many old ladies know Post Malone?  I don't know Post Malone and I'm 45.  You could learn some classics and sing those.  Of course, they seem to be kinda clueless anyway.  I am so grateful for people like you.  My father-in-law was almost scammed, and people have tried scamming me, and I'm so thankful for those who educate us on this so it won't happen to us or our loved ones.  Thank you!
how many dumb fluffs did it take for u to launch that impressive career? cuz i mean  ... i wanna know how many of them there are ... for science!!
so much to learn from your show ,,,thank you so very much
I wish you all the best to you and your Family  God bless
You are an amazing person bud keep it going  But don’t go to India 😂
Heroes! God bless and keep you all!
Not all heroes wears Cape!!!
Knowing that this was going on helped me when my mother received a call like this but knew that it was a bogus call as soon as she said what they were wanting her to do ….thanks for taking the time to do this and to expose what people that don’t want to work but think that they deserve to be taken care of by everyone else….guess these were the individuals that voted for Biden.
Sad there are no laws to protect us from scammers if not for you—--!! YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING-!!! BLESS YOU a hundredfold!!
Don't stop going after these jerkoffs. I wished they squirted worse smell out. Good friends of mine, older couple, were scammed for $6k. It was terrible and scary. Keep great work up!
Thank you for going against these scammers..God Bless..
Are there any recommendations on software to prevent remote desktop access?

Youuuu actually got someone arrested...!???!? Here’s a half subscription
Way to go thank you
I love Messing with scammers...I think I'm on their do not call list now.
You guys are real life superheroes.  The FBI has too much red tape.
I’m assuming that the 1000 thumbs down are so named Carl and live in California. 😏
That was awesome!!! Thank you for what you do!
I always pick up when they call and waste as much time as I possibly can out of their day. Figure it keeps them from calling someone else and I like being an ahole

9:28 OOOOOH LALA ..........
I frickin HATE scammers.  My 90 year old mom almost got sucked in by a guy posing as Microsoft help desk. Thankfully we caught it before she lost anything, but dayumm.
Goodwork man
I wish I saw this before it happened to me. The people that got me pretended to be Amazon. Its been a nightmare!
You taught good and hard listen bro. Every scammer will be scared now.
Can I please get their phone numbers so that I can call them and waste their time?
I wish I could do what you do.
Perogi you had my 2 born in the wild cat sisters @ a shoe & some cat treats LMA0....I've been watching you for a while now tho..🦋😆😁❤
Follow up?
Please type in, Pandemics: History and Prevention 💔
That wasn’t the scammer. That was just the courier…
Why all scammer is in india no offense tho just asking?
I like how all 3 of y'all made comments about either going to 11 next year or going to india... I am so excited for next years video in India lol.
Don't set up voicemail. Don't answer unknown calls. Period.
Well done indeed.
You are an awesome human being!!!! I love your videos!!😃💙💜
I would send anthrax in an envelope to them.
Which is why I love you and Jim Browning!
Thank you so much for your help fighting the good fight. What a great thing to do.

Don’t blur their faces
How can I get in contact with you?? I’ve been scammed once this year by some sum bags for $450. AND YESTERDAY I got a call from social security and I know for a fact they NEVER CALL.
INTERESTING THAT ALL THE BIG COMPANIES ARE  ARE LETTING THESE SCAMMER  MISREPRESENT THEIR BRAND AND NOT DOING ANYTHING TO STOP THE SCAMMERS WITH ALL THEIR RESOURCES AND TECHNICAL KNOW HOW.THESE ARE AMONG THE MOST POWERFUL COMPANIES  IN THE WORLD .
Based on the Dis-Likes, you have 914 Scammers following you.
9:25 will ruin your life
whoop them sir
Scammers ain't from Texas, they can get caught
Should show their faces dirtbags
You can bet many that do not like this are those that are scammers. Keep up the good work.
Thank you!! You're great.
Not only are you brilliant, you're gorgeous well!
This is a lot of fun. But I wish you could send this device to India. I suspect the person in Florida was a small time player in all this.
Fabulous payback!!!!!!!!!
Thank you for what you do. Is there a master class or tutorial so that we can do this as well?
Love you glitter bombed him with fart spray and glue 😂😂 when he was covered in glitter and getting out the police car 😂😂😂😂  My mum is now a fan of this channel
My dad gone done years ago they held his computer hostage so my dad said once he realised we’ll do what u want because I’m not paying you .. and he called the bank they froze his account police were called but not much was done but they deleted his files but he turned it off when they was doing what they was doing and took it to pc world and a young took his computer home and recovered half of his files so my dad got him a giftcard because he wouldn’t take money for it after that there so cautious..there disgusting and what you do is class and may God Bless you for efforts to stop them and save victims 💜🙏
Amazing video
❤️❤️❤️
CLASSIC. THOSE SCUM DESERVE IT. RESPECT TO YOU AND MARK ON BUSTING THAT COCKROACH
The best
You are my hero.  Love that you teamed up with others to actually catch these scammer low lifes.  What happens to the money mules and anybody else involved in the scam?  It would be awesome to see a follow up with them in jail, asset seized, etc.    Your channel and the work you are doing is amazing and so appreciated!  Great work.
I just said what what what like I couldn't hear them. That call lasted less than 15sec.
Not what we've done but all you've done dude we are supporting you and  the rest is on you.Also thanks for all the people you helped. (Used THE glitter bomb was pretty smart actually)

Definitely sharing, thanks for making it! Fantastic seeing the cops at the end!
You are a hero without a cape. Thankyou for trying to make citizens aware of the scum that steal and con money off innocent, honest, good people, every hour of every day. May the Lord watch over, protect and bless you, for the work you do. Thankyou, from everyone that has ever been scammed and from all the honest citizens of the world. You are a blessing and deserve MUCH more recognition for your wonderful work. Thankyou again. Be safe and well mate. Bob. Australia.
Despicable people
10:15 , dude are you wearing a dress? Wow.. ya should have gotten a goat costume instead. Those people love goats 🐐
What gets me is that SHE, the scammer pick up person, was wearing better clothes than most of my family wears.
Hope u do
Outstanding!!!!! Thank you for doing this.

If you want to take this to the next level & legal. Find me.
Keep up the fantastic work, bud!! Please keep continuing to bring these low life villains down!!!
Love this! Have been watching Jim Browning do his amazing work for years now and then Rober this last year. Now this.  Just superb.  Wish I could be a part of it too.
It's a pity you can't send the glitter and fart bombs to India.  What would be even more offensive to them was if you sent them packages of beef blood that sprayed all over them........that would send them running to the temple......
Glad I have no money and I don't fall for ANYONE that speaks hindi. I honestly have NO idea why people fall for these scams I mean telling you to pack the box that way is a HUGE red flag.
Dude you are 100% hilarious! I haven't laughed at a video it's so hard in so long! Thank you and keep fightin' the good fight!
I laughed so hard when he sang “congratulations”
The glitterbombs are hysterical for the porch pirates. The packages for these crooks should have bait strap dye packs.
Why does virtually every scammer have an Indian accent?
You`re a good man !
I love watching your channel 🤣🤣🤣
Haha. Can you send a real bomb?
I've been working in IT for over 15 years and I see the scammer culture in all the phishing emails that come into our corporate email system, and it's appalling, the kinds of blatant lies they tell in order to deceive someone into clicking a link, opening an attachment, or submitting usernames and passwords. In my head, I picture these criminals spending their time actually trying to dream up new ways to steal from people and it sickens me in ways I can't describe. I spend a lot of time educating our employees on how to spot bogus scam emails and I really enjoy seeing people like you out there taking a stand and trying to bring more awareness to the community. Thanks for your hard work!
Good one!!!
You, sir, should be nominated for Sainthood.
12:53.  Why the f**k do you blur her face??!!  😡  We can't see the facial expressions which are priceless!!
If you get scammed by someone with these horrible scams... YOU DESERVE IT! Why doesn't the government or a lot of people care? No one cares because there are thousands of things more important than this lol
Best part: “I didn’t raise you this way!” 😂😂😂
New sub. Thank you doesn't seem like the right words.
👍👍❤️❤️
You are a hero man!
Excellent... be blessed 🙌🙏GypsyTrail
Thank you for what you do ! You guys are awesome.
Thank you so much last year my Mother and father were scammed and they didn't even leave them enough money to eat on that month they used an ATT email scam to start the process had my 82 year old father purchasing gift cards while my mom sat at home talking to them they live on Social Security and a small retirement.  I am going to see if local senior centers will play your videos at their centers to help spread the information.
I thought I was watching Disrupt at the beginning
Thank you for doing this 😇.
so so gratifying to see this!
He really said mom
You are a genius!
I wonder if the FBI watches this stuff? Amazing!
Ur the mann bro
My mom calls me Peta. XD
it's so awesome that you and Mark and Jim are teaming up to do this.  I love your videos and the work that you do.  at the least, you guys are spreading awareness so people know what to look for and hopefully in the future most of us will be knowledgeable to stop the scams before they even start.
You all are superheroes in my eyes!!! THANK YOU!
You guys are freakin' superheroes. Thank you!
The most satisfying video I have ever seen, your channel has my wife and i gripped, keep up the fight👊👍
And it's easy for this to stop all of it it's easy but they rather chase some teenager how is smoking weed than solve or do something meaningful
My Mom got scammed. She no longer has a computer, thankfully. Now when she gets those calls she knows it's a scam. I understand your rage over this, and I applaud your efforts.
you should do a collab with pleasant green
Vivian reminds me of Joe Lycett.

I really like the blue hair! Please keep great work in delivering justice.
Blue hair. Yikes
I know it’s part of the scam but say it’s a real situation, if they could transfer money to your account why wouldn’t you be able to just transfer it back? Also don’t you have to accept a transfer into your account?
You are my Hero
scam checklist: 1. AnyDesk 2. Ask for Gift Cards 3.Compliment 4. Never hang up 5. Syskey 6. Check Webcam 7. Ask for Gift Cards found this on stream lol
Just subbed. Love what you guys do, thank you. I've never been scammed but I feel bad for those that are so what you guys do is amazing.
Love you separately, but together you guys are epic!!!  More collabs!!  Squish these fucking cockroaches!!!!  How am I just seeing this??  I watch everytime I get a notification!
❤🤗💐🇧🇻
Do they do this with Commonwealth?
wait........................ WE HAVE THIS IN ASUTRALIA!??!??!?!??! Im not opening my bank acount any time soon
Thanks for your videos. Very informative, entertaining, and glad to see you doing good. Real men always protect the weaker and the innocent.   I did have a question maybe you could help me understand and forgive me if its a dumb question. If they trick people by writing the page on their browser to show too much money in the account wouldn't the victim notice the funds aren't that much when they go to the bank. Or if they bring the page back up on their own?  Or maybe they aren't thinking to double check?
Amazing!
why was the scammers face covered?
Buy a package from Amazon and risk someone stealing it.....or subscribe and donate to someone making videos....what to do with the last of my savings????
Perfect retribution. Scam Con Artists Man!!!
This is hilarious. But aren't the money mules also sometimes unwitting victims themselves?
That's awesome !! 👌  hey how about sending a big box to the central scammer office in India
doubla doubla doubla - hahahahahaha
Love this :) I get so many scam calls at all hours . It is lovely ( and frickin hilarious) to see these nasty people caught.
What does the government doing?
Thank god for people like you xxxx
What changed for you to say you in a recent stream you won't do another glitter bomb?
yeah it could be possible. if bank manager want to be steal his customers. but how? bank manager> call a hacker. hacker> get money from bank manager if he agreed to hack his own customer's bank account who are rich. and then >hacker get the profit of his work and >manager to. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 so we can understand now what is the process of making civilian's chutiya. why that is called "chutiya banane ki ninja techniques". 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Never been a more important video to share everywhere.
These f**kers deserve way more punshiment , i lost 370$ on a graphics card scam a month ago by a Nigerian guy , pretending to be a shop in the uk selling computer parts,  i wish i could f*ck em up , well , i couldnt do anything , but i hope others are well aware seein this video
looks like nearly 1000 scammers don't like your YouTube video ... thats a lot of scammers out there yet....
Scammers used to call me all the time until I answer we my (city’s name)police department and the scammer told me he loved me 😂😂😂😂and hanged up
Dude, are you in Pearland? Son of a bitch! Let's go have a beers!
Thank you guys for all the hard work busting scammers. And you mad him cry 😢. Yes!
cool! thanks!
If you ever go to India, go without a Glitterbomb. go instead with a real bomb and a video camera
I'm not a scanner, but I want a glitter bomb!!! Oh. Forgot about the fart spray and camera. Just the glitter plz x
Vivian Rogers for president!
Thank you for what you ALL do.  As for me, I've got to answer my Car Warranty call (from the dealership service center, for the 3rd time today), so..... keep up the good work!  :D
Heroes!!
Get the hell out! I grew up in Pearland. That was cool seeing that.
Man you are fantastic,thank you for all the hard work you put in to this.If it wasn’t for people like you and Jim etc,we would not even know it’s happening. I am 68 so not very good at technology.But just last week someone with an Indian accent was about to start their script 😳I said excuse me b4 we start can I just tell you something.Sure he said.So I started being really obscene to him.Then hung up and blocked him.But that’s only because I watch you.So thank you so very much.If there’s a heaven you will surely be going there.Much love from London x oh it was on my I phone 👀
Nice! Thank you!😊
Let me guess who gave this a thumbs down?😂
Wish I could have had your help 3 years ago 😔
This is also happens in Indonesia most of the time. I remembered once when the scammer called and told me that my father was arrested and in police office. I was laughed so hard, because at the time my father was sleeping in his room. 😂😂😂  And also this scamming thing we call it with MAMA MINTA PULSA.
In Japan, delivery companies are not allowed to leave boxes outside a residence. I can't believe you can do that in the US.
Now  he literally smells like  a real fart...
WTF? The scammer is a gay white guy?  AHAHAH  Do you think we trust you? You scammed us too...
The three musketeers of the scam detection detective thingy(idk I don't have any other names)
My only complaint is ya gotta show what happened to the chick man, and why not go up the food chain. I’m 100% down to volunteer to be a mule and help nail the higher ups.
You say “a fart spray that even Mac Culkin can’t take” like there’s a slightly lower level of fart spray that Mac is totally ok with.
That drag look tho.. 😂 💅🏽 👗
Scammer calls me;  City morgue. You stab me, we slab em.
pierogi,  my family's favorite food.  Glad to see what your doing and cracking myself up picturing a pierogi with a cape on, flying through cyberspace
I'm now addicted to this channel. I wish I understood how you access their computer without them seeing you do it. Great work man!
STEVE BENTI LAKIRT TERIDI :D HAHAHAHAH
My favorites! Pierogi, Mark Rober, and Kitboga. Y’all need to unite forces to aggravate these scammers out of business!
I recently had a voicemail from an Amazon scammer, it was definitely a north American based scammer center because the woman had no discernable accent. I knew better than to believe it, Amazon will not call you.
Cool hair.
Top class 👏👏✌️
Someone needs to open a business and hire ppl to destroy scammers.
Community policing at it's best! Nice work!
love watching your videos. i am being bombarded with scam calls, emails, and recently texts. i also get about 100 scam calls a day, no joke. i block them but that does nothing. every time i hear my phone, i automatically think to block before even checking who it is. this has become so ridiculous that i want to change my number but that is a pain to do so i just deal with all of this. i wish these people would find a real job and stop stalking us. oh, and when i hang up, they call right back, and again, and again. so annoying. anyway, thanks for all that you do man, you are a hero.
who cries like that??!!!!!!!!! lol
If a scammer calls you, tell them you're grabbing your wallet & put them on hold. It's a couple minutes of their time that you can waste instead of them scamming someone else
Thank you! You Rock!
Amazing! Thank you for all you do Pierogi 👍🏼💯🙏🏽
Thank you for doing this for us elderly.
Here in England (and no doubt, globally) I get texts from Royal Mail and DPD, saying there is a delivery waiting for me, but I have to pay 99p to get it. That's a small amount of money - but if you add up the number of people that could be taken in by this, it's a profitable business. But, unlike the scammers that could be caught on channels such as this, there is seemingly no way of knowing where these texts come from. EDIT: But, well done on catching these absolute scumbags. Xx
Sharing these videos with my family and friends. My mom was recently scammed! They like to hit the elderly and the vulnerable.   These people have no remorse when they do it. I have no idea how they sleep at night! Obviously they don't think they need to answer to a higher power. Judgement Day people think, about it!
She will say that package is for someone else? How it ended?
Man you need to learn a sense of humor from atomic. But I can't fault your intentions so good work
THE FOLLOWING IS A NECESSITY: Scambaiters need to make a video series for older adults that empowers them to identify the types of scams out there, and they need to be given concrete ways of dealing with scammers who pressure our oldest members in society via bullying or utilizing sympathy as manipulation tactics.  Then, those of us who are aware of these scams can provide this information to our elders. These scambaiting videos are fantastic, but many older individuals need a detailed roadmap that thoroughly explains the concepts of the grift such as how html can be edited to trick the victim into thinking he/she/them/they etc. received extra money. Reducing these scams involves empowering the older generations with the knowledge to effectively deal with these calls and thus protect themselves from becoming victims.
Love it died laughing pls add dye totlsy wreck havoc
Oh my gosh, not only is that the town I live in, I know the exact spot she got arrested from the video.
maybe use a dye pak like the  banks.... wouldn't taht be aweson to see them covered in bright blue dye
Great going! Love your channel and Mark’s too!
Ive been watching your videos for a couple weeks now and all I gotta say is good job!
Fantastic to get one banged up in jail.I wish it was diaoria in the box.But it’s great of you to do this with all the skills you have. You should get a medal.Much love from London 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Rober, Pierogi, and Vivian are my heros!!
I have disliked the video... way too disjointed and no arrests.
Give 'em hell.  Scammers deserve no respect and no peace.  It would be amazing if, when you manage to find their headquarters, a mob of your supporters went with you to India to confront them.  Putting that on my bucket list.
My name is Mike Singh (Real name Jaskaran Singh) and I'm from Punjab India. With tearful eyes and a heavy heart, I wish to apologise to everyone here, to the victims and their families, to ordinary Americans, for the pain and suffering the miniscule fraction of my countrymen have caused you.  Again, tears while typing this because we've been scammed by our own countrymen (real estate fraud) and we've seen our home get destroyed and families break. I know the pain and suffering that you feel.  Please know that, as Jim Browning and Karl Rock have said, that this is a small small percentage of us who do this. Scammers don't represent India, charitable organisations like Khalsa Aid represent India.  Please continue the good work and we love you for the countless innocent people you guys are saving from frauds.  Cheers Mike
Today is the first day I’ve seen you without sunglasses on and I’m ❤️ 😱 💗 great vid👌🏼🐊🌺🔥😍🐊
What the police do to them?
Do you get them in trouble all the time??  Why did you say that sometimes there is red tape.  Hey, I am bilingual: if you ever need something in Spanish, I'd love to help!!
BWAAAAAA HA HA HA H A  Love it!!!!!  Keep doing this and show us when you get them!! God bless you!!
Please give lessons on how we can actively help you!! How can we learn to do this also? What is our best chance at not being scammed, they are S L I C K!!!
have you ever heard that song 'congratulations' po-post malone? 'yes'
when you realize every damn scammer sounds the same.....
How do I buy one of those gli5terbombs
I saw every series of the gliterbomb which he made
Has anyone gone, hey ,I’ll just keep that extra money, ta! Goodbye.
Scam buster super team. Jim Browning, mark rober, scammer pay back, and pleasant green.
👏👏👏👏 ❤️ thank you
Why can I only click the like button once  Thank you so much to you, Jim and Mark!!! Together like this you guys could literally make these kinds of scams too hot to bother with!!!
I wish someone would start a channel that covers the employment scams. Especially during this pandemic; the amount of fraud that takes place just from posting a resume on a site or app like Indeed And the weird thing about it is is the majority of the people doing those types of fraudulent activities are also from India....
Vivian is fox, dayum
So I just wanna say….Perogi could be a pretty great drag queen!
Vivian Rodgers is so pretty lol
Pasta melone
9:27 - I'm sorry. I thought Vivian was supposed to be a *BIG* Beautiful Woman? We CERTAINTLY got the "beautiful" part, but where's the "big"? I have been scammed!
why did you use Russia(Kazakhstan) country code at 0:34?
I still don’t understand why the government is not taking this problem seriously. I believe technology took them so much by surprise that they can’t keep up. The web 🕸 is literally doing its job, entrapping many victims.
I like to tell them "Your mother would be ashamed of you." Always a silence, a shocked silence if I can guess.  They hang up, I hang up.
First and foremost, I would like to thank you for all that you do here. Everytime you do something like this you're protecting an elderly person. Not only that but you're helping to educate those who do not understand how these scams work. This in turn prepares the uninitiated in what to do when a scammer calls thereby stopping them cold before they even pick up the phone but I digress...  I love it when a scammer calls my phone. I enjoy seeing how long I can keep them on the phone and if by the end of the call said scammer is in a blind rage all the better. This generally happens when you "play along with them" until the very end. The more time I waste the angrier they get. Every call that I have with these people always ends with "You will never get me no matter how many times you try..." In doing so it usually steps up the calls giving me more scammer vermin to play with. It's a destructive cycle and I aim to keep them there. ;)
WELL DONE!!!
As we stand 877 scammers have disliked this vid XD
What u r doing is amazing! Thank you.
I love the blue hair! and love the stuff you do.
My company has overpaid you and the only possible way to refund this money is to send cash wrapped up in foil in a box?  To some random person at a random address?
What a pathetic little weasel the crying person is.  He cannot have any shred of self respect to act that way.
You and your fellow baiters must have thousands of victim info.  You should start a class action lawsuit on behalf of these people against the Indian government for failing to act against these people.
Free remote access software.  Surely this should be banned.
Great job! Smarts, talents, technology and ingenuity can still be used for good.
They need  to send a glitter bomb directly to the mofos  in the India scamming call centers!  They are just getting the moles who actually get paid little by the real scammers
How does one protect oneself from these low lives?
Can they hack ones emails? Or have a virus in the email without one opening?
Does this mean anydesk is compromised or is it still safe? Also i have received those email about Norton how can I forward this to you?
you should see about making this a federal program through your congress person.
If you were in the UK you would Knighted. You are brilliant.
Thank you.
Good humored. Good heart. Good work.  Thank you for all that you do!!! ❤️❤️
Thank you for what you do! You have real ❤️
You got a bunch of 70 and 80 year olds running America. Good luck trying to get these people to take stuff like this seriously.
Ohh my what a beautiful woman you make lol 😆
So who else heard “the unsuspecting victim” and automatically said “of darkness in the valley, we can live like Jack and Sally if we want”?   If you did - does your back also hurt today?
Oh Vivian . . we need to see more of you.
Vivian you look adorable in leopard print 😍😍😍 keep up the good work❤️❤️❤️
Can you please see the prime minister of Quebec as a scammer!
What a genuine and heartfelt ending.  Thanks for what you do
Thank you for what you do !
When I have them on the phone I say can you hold on a minute. Then I quietly act like I'm talking quietly to someone and say 'Agent Baker how long do I have to keep them on the phone?"  Then I say Hello and sometimes they hang up
did anyone else get a chubby when Vivian made her appearance?
It would be great if it were possible for someone like these scam baiters to set themselves up as one of the money collectors for these scammers, so that when someone sends them money can send it right back along with a warning that they are being scammed.
all of them have similar accents i have heard most scam bait videos they all sound the same
Perogi, Mark, and Jim are real heroes.
Yay glitter bomb. Its sooo cool. Go for it. Wish you could do it all the time.
Admit it Pierogi, 90% of why you made this video is to show off the one, the only ✨Vivian✨ 🤣
When did he dye his hair blue?
Awesome!! Love watching theses jerks get nailed!!
Oh...God Bless You Boys!
Just say that you sent the money on a pigeon and that he should be there in two days three if he is lazy.
*me sending monopoly money via post instead*
I got a call from these guys once telling me there was an issue with my card. The first thing he does is ask my name. So I say, if there is an issue with my card don't you already know my name? He says 'yes'. I say, 'Great. Whats my name. There is a long pause and then the guy says, "Michael Jackson". I just died laughing and hung up.
seen one of mark's vids i think its amazing. wish i had the computer smarts to do it. but it is incredible that if in this case 3 ppl can do this. if the feds;mailing companies etc... would sit down n talk. we'ld see these crimes drop big
Your awesome 😎😊
We should make the world a better place
Yup u are right this is bad why do people even scam it’s just bad
There is a great space in heaven waiting for you guys (like 70 yrs from now)  Thanks guys
Why are the perp's faces always blurred? They deserve to have their image all over the internet.
who would give this video a thumbs down?!?!
Why would u care if he loses his job. IT SHOULD BE AN EYE FOR AN EYE
Why r people so stupid. Any business would not ask u to go to your bank and get money out or get giftcard and they don't take over your computer ETC......
Being an Indian, I still am proud to have someone point out the crap these scammers indulge in. I wish the government agencies in India take note of the increasing number of these incidents and take strict action against the fraudsters. It's disgusting to rob hard-earned money off individuals and seeing these fraudsters do the same, makes me cringe. @Scammer_Payback, I think that you could take the blob off these scamsters' faces and show them to the real world. There's no point in protecting their privacy.
Why haven't banks changed their online systems to block this? Require verification for any transfers of more than 500$ and block inspector editing.
Pierogy, Mark, Jim and Vivian should form a justice league against scammers
11:22 Thank you! About time! Sane!
You should add a bomb’s countdown sound instead of the counting backwards
Listen brother, I love what you guys do, but if you ever do a Vivian drag queen again, I'm gonna unsubscribe. FR!
Use God's name to do bad and except hell when you die
Boy, I sure wish this would happen to every single one of these creeps!
Hey next time why dont you use an indian name with a story that your grand parents migrated to US
Nice work keep it up
Funny I was watching this vid and I got a scam call lol
next time send a real bomb to each and every one of their houses hqs and whatever else they have and you earned my sub
I can understand how people sometimes get caught up in a scam, but this one doesn't seem very plausible from the moment they will stay on the phone with you while you go to the bank. That is so odd and wrong. But if they go along and get to sending the cash.... No company in the world would make you send cash in boxes! And the packing? I'd say you're very gullible if you still think it's legit. That scares me. Because it obviously work. What demographics are falling for this? Old people? Computer illiterates? Mentally handicapped? Men between 30 and 40? It would be interesting to know.
An indian crying for jesus? That doesn't happen every day!
Awesome work, of course. But also great editing on your end to tell the story in a way that can help provide a community service, and capture our love of your effort
I would love to see a video where they “add” those THOUSANDS of dollars into your bank account and you tell them you are keeping all that money! Would love to see what they say 🤣🤣🤣
Pierogi I think you should name the title of this video “The ultimate scammer payback”
That is beautiful 👍👍😂😎❣
Pearland police.... That's right here down the street right outside of Houston Texas
It'd be funny if they asked me to go to my credit union bc decades ago it was only in Florida and Idaho. I'm in Texas lolzzz 😝
We were getting these calls, so I pulled out my old (circa 2006) laptop, loaded it up with viruses and gave the scammer access to THAT when they called. We've never been called since!
BEFORE YOU DO SOMETHING LLIKE THIS.....THINK IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH.  Especially PACKAGE bandits. PACKAGE THIEVES----This is funny and I like it BUT THINK FIRST....THEY KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE and they have already shown they WILL COMMIT CRIMES.     GET GLITTER all over the place and they WILL want revenge.....AND THEY KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE. PUT OUT THIER EYE and they CAN sue the $@%@ out of YOU for BOOBY_TRAPPING a package
the scammer crying is just funny lol
These videos are awesome bro. Keepem coming.
The silent tenor constitutively clap because ornament spectacularly skip over a verdant imprisonment. nonchalant, solid dahlia
Stop crying. This unbecoming of you. I didn't raise you this way.  OMG! LOL
And people said Endgame was the best crossover.
' I didn't raise you this way,' LOL
These Scammers are not only thieves they're dumb. I typically answer no to every question  or tell them I have to go to the bathroom and they'll hold on for 5 to 10 minutes before thy hang up. I wish there was a way I could get back at them.
I have to say, it is unbelievable to me anyone would package money like this and not be able to recognize something is wrong. Just wrapping something in tinfoil, should send up red flags for anyone older than 10 years of age. Hell if I was 8, I would be asking someone a question or two. For the record...Vivian freaks me out.
Your amazing. Wish I could join you. Need any help my man!? Lmao I always love helping people get the justice they deserve!!
Vivien looks like the church lady's sister lol
I live in uk if you need any help in uk you can text me anytime
You are real hero
I love you man you are great you make me cry 😭
I get so many goddamn scam calls about "my car's extended warranty" or whatever. Thing is,, I can't drive, and thus don't have a car lmaooooo 🙃
thy three have united
That fake cry
Hell yea keep up the good work
Looooove it!!
Keep it up!  God bless you!
You guys are heroes...thank you 1,000 times
Would love to see there faces when the glitter bomb pops.
Hello, where did you get your name ?? I was so happy to find you on utube and find out all you do for the greater good and all the great you do for everyone. What a great guy you are.  Would like to chat with you soon. I have had some problems with my laptop and i would also would like to know the best to protect my system.
9:27 oh my god. Hahahahahaha that's soo funny man
You are fucking awsome man
Great job!!
Damn, wanted to see YOU get a glitter bomb in the face...lol. You guys are AMAZING xxxx
It's the crying for me😂😂
Why was the "scammer" recording herself at 12:50 PM at a perfect angle for this youtube video? ?
Look at all the thieves who thumb this down
If you can link these scammers to funding terrorism I suspect you'll get more traction.  I honestly feel that's exactly where the money is going.
Instead of sending a glitter bomb use the kind with black powder in it.
You’re da bomb! Seriously!
Keep doing good work 👍👍👍
I got a call from a scammer saying that my song got hit by a car        I don't have a son 🙃
Get them brother
LMAO Don't cry. I didn't raise you that way. OML
I love you for making the scums pay for their actions., any time you do decide to go to india to further punish these heartless individuals please count me in. If I can’t go to assist you I will definitely pay your ticket.
They got my neighbor a couple months ago! He is so embarrassed!
Thank You All
Keep up the great work, and I am interested in using your youTUBE video for a public service education session with local Law Enforcement.  Thinking of offering a free scammer education session of an evening for all citizens, and especially the elderly citizens who are continually targeted by these scammers.  Reaching out to Mark R as well for permission to use his videos.
Hell yeah dude. I am so thankful for people like you. Wish we could do something more to these scammers. Like send them to jail. My wife was recently scammed $3,000. Made me so angry. Keep up the great work!
Love it 😂🤣 ,,😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂potty 🤣😂🤣🤣
great !
Thank you for doing this!
OMG....I love you for what you do. A friend of mine got scammed, once for $10,000 that we know of. They prey mostly older, vulnerable people.
All we need, is one major company is to announce that they are pulling all their India call centers out, because of these scammers. It wouldn't take long for the authorities in India to crack down on these scammers.
🤣😂😂😂🤣 brilliant 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
You are cool!
Scammers are pretty predictable if you know what they usually do
Can someone please explain who this woman is at the end?
I'd love to see Mark make this apart of his Christmas tradition with the pranking the porch robbers. Like both of those people who think this is OK deserve jail time
I love his lady voice ! Lol
At this point it would be weird if scammers stopped calling. I get at least least 5 a day.
This is edited so confusingly
I love your videos. You are the MAN! Thanks for all you do brother.
A few times my friend got calls about his cars extended warranty.... My friend was like 12 at the time this happened....
Brilliant!!!!😂😂😂 I had a scammer call me last week I had so much fun with them anyway you’re doing a great job keep it going we ALL love you xx
Viv, you little minx, you keep crying Steve on his toes now
Sorry, it wasn't super clear in the video, to get access to your computer remotly, do they have you download some kind of software onto your computer?
You didn't need to dress like an old lady. Little creepy
ALSO what sort of PERSON would be willing to withdraw cash , wrap it up in Foil and Lie to the likes of FED-EX  just on the word of a stranger ??? - I just don't get it - ...
I love your videos and think they perform a great service - BUT is the answer here to NEVER allow "anyone" remote access to your Computer - NEVER EVER - ......
Great job well done 👏 , it would be great if can figure out a way to dump the fart spray out on to where ever they open the package so they can enjoy and remember this for a long long time 🥺🥺🤣👍
How about you put a rock in the box and tape it up
Lol!
I hate scammers die scammers!
You guys are awesome! Keep up the good work!
I just got GOOSE BUMPS!! I was watching this video and when the clip shows the Pearland Police vehicle, I was like oh sh#t! This is happened in my town. You never even think this happens this close to home. Glad you guys are getting the jerks one person at a time!
I wonder if anyone has sent hollywood cash or fake money,  or the black money and see if they would pay for the chemical to change it.
Thanks for what you doing ❤️👍
This people are heartless. 😡
He IS defending us we Have just to subcribe and like The video😂🤧
Did the Glitterbomb recipient get arrested? If so, for what charges?  I am reminded of another scambait video in which a guy seemed to be really in on the scam, not just an innocent money mule or a victim himself thinking he would finally get paid, but then he just faked inability to speak English till he realized not even the police could arrest him (dialed 911 to report harassment), then drove off.
I'm always broke. So I'm unscammable. 😂😂
I would just like to add my voice to all those who agree, there isn't Nearly enough being done about this! Keep it up. Thank You!
I stan you guys! Keep going dude 😍❤️
perfect ! ... we deserve a better world
How about  CHILI 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️ FLAVOURED STINK BOMB 💣?
Chefs kiss! Just beautiful
Lol today I had 4 scam phone calls while watching this vid 😂😂😂
You should arrest the scam leader first
11:44 I live in an EU country, and was born in a different EU country, and I have never had a "robocall". I had to convince someone I know to explain to me in a "talk to me as if I am a child who has never heard of this" kind of way, and they thought I was joking at first. I understood the words and concepts of the basic explanation, but I just could not fathom a large scale operation where corporations and scammers alike would just be allowed to spam-call you, because the technology to stop it is cheap and has been around for a long time.  It truly is a different world~
Wait how was the lady connected to the scam?
Hey Vivian! Why do you have 5 o’clock shadow?
It is greatly appreciated what you do. Please continue. I have a question for you. In this video allegedly they put $40,000.00 into your account. Was that all fake? I was not sure how that worked but if they really did and you did nothing do you get to keep the money. Same as the glitter bomb. When you made the package and did not put in the money are they really out the $40,000.00? I hope it is true. Again thank you to you and Jim for what you are doing and I hope that you can train more people to scam the scammers. My hat is off to you and I look forward to seeing you make more scammers cry. I hate that old people are losing everything they have. It is also great when you, as in one video called that lady and told her to stop. You saved her life. Bless you guys. Go getum!!!!!!
Hm. Steven Williams, eh?
Fuck them scammers up,nice work
He's crying lol
i love the moment right about 10:25 where they didnt cut right before the laugh out of character lol
Was he speedrunning this?
Keep fighting the good fight.
Just so you know. I will support you, as you continue to take these scammers down. Some scammers have tried to call me. I mess with them for as long as I can to keep these low lifes from calling other people. I will also keep spreading the word about this channel. Keep up the good work. I just subscribed too.
muscle definition is not a thing in people who sit at their computer every single day and only get up to urinate
I remember when scammers called my mom telling her my sister was arrested in New Mexico and she needed to pay the bail money. My sister was 11 at the time.
Hey man can you help my city out we are being targeted by car warranty scammers they all should go to jail
If you ever wanna move to Canada I'll totally marry you 😍😍
brilliant!
YOU ARE AWESOME!
Damn!! I was getting turned on when I saw Vivian. Is she single???
Bro get mark rober to make you 100 glitter bombs so we can have some fun
I think you are amazing! Your passion is palpable and your kindness for others is something to behold! THANK YOU for all you do, and thank you for doing it w so much style! Love Vivian and Monica... I laughed so hard when you dressed up as Monica n then had to show your face to the scammer....mustache and all!!! God bless you sweetie
I live in affluent neighborhood, we were talking about these scams and several had been scammed out of $10k and more. Thank you for your diligent effort and working with the authorities. 👍🏻
Thank you for your hard work and making a difference
Don't even need online law enforcement anymore. A youtuber will get the info for the police lol
Come on give him the million
Mark Robers is missing one word and one letter THE and B...✌️
I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How can any one be that stupid ? Sending cash in a box, what the hell !!!!!!?
Vivian 😂
❤❤❤
I love how the scammer say lost his job
Charlene is my friends name!
Why not just check ur bank account on the phone and compare it to the one on the computer/laptop? Common sense but ok
I’ve been watching urself d last few weeks and you and Jim and mark aren’t just 3 normal quys yous are doing great job y’all should be awarded something much respect ✊ from Ireland 🇮🇪
I've been a fan of all you guys and everything you do for a long time. Watching this morning it hit me that you guy's are quite literally Batman. You are vigilante working outside the law to accomplish something for the greater good that the police cannot. I was curious if you've ever gotten any kind of backlash from people for what you guys do. Aside from the scammer's that obviously hate it lol. Just a curiosity, love the channel and all that you do. Keep up the fight!
i love mark <33
Scammer Payback commit a fed crime cant make bombs of any things expoles , I on the banned list for this list shit can made homemade bomds  also got me banned on fron hunting guns it was fucked,,,, you can thank  My Trainer Me Uninomber And the  niclous and Mcveigh you guys are increasing terrism   Point Bombs is a federal crime not worth life

I’ve been following mark Rober for years. And it started because of the glitter bomb package lol And now you are nailing them at the other end. Thank you pirogi.
What you do is beautiful, keep it up
Payback!
What’s up, society?
Wow.
I get those calls all the time. It’s scary.
I'm not trying to be a jerk, but, I can't think of a non-jerk way to ask. Is there a good reason people believe a financial professional of any type accepts let alone can only accept bitcoin, gift cards, steam wallet and such similar nonsense? Oh gee boss, I got you five million in stocks, but, first I need paid my broker fee, only five hundred, but make sure it's on steam ... come on.
Vivien Rogers is a very sexy lady ❤️
I'm so proud of you three for this fabulous job! I hope there are people in Australia and UK and other countries, with knowledge and the the skills like yours, to bring justice to the victims.
Sending truckloads of love and blessings to you and your team, brother. I wish to meet you someday and shake hands with you. You're doing an awesome job. I was once a victim of an online scam and I know how it feels. Thank you for your services. God bless you.
Wow that was a wonderful job!!!
Truly nice nail job, dude 8D HAHAHAHA xD
a truly revolutionary man👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
People everywhere needs to wake up exactly
These people are scum low life’s and manipulating bullies
People need to be street wise and stop falling for these scammers real companies don’t talk to people like this these scammers are everywhere and I mean every where
I still can't believe people fall for this shit...
We thank you brother,our support for u will always be there
Has anyone ever said, “You overpaid me $4,000.00. Thanx!”
It's an interesting contrast between this video compared to Mark and especially Jim's videos. Here, getting this one mule caught is portrayed as a big victory. For them, it's only the beginning.
I never get this kind of scam. I get calls about my car warranty, which is fun because I tell them I have a Lamborghini.   Question on this type of scam — when the guy says he transferred too much money to your account, why not just say, “Well, you’re SOL”?
Random comment. You are so cute!!!! 🙃
I am inundated every day with these robo calls.  I just tell them that they took to long to answer and hang up on them.  I know that isn't the case with many people because they are just to nice to hang up on anyone.  I really appreciate what you all are doing to bring this heinous crime into the public eye.  Thank you for all of your work and if I was able to afford any contribution to the cause you would have it.  I sincerely hope that your 4th of July weekend was safe and that all is well with you.
Bro., I had no idea videos like this existed!! Freakin awesome work Bud. Have been binge watching you for over 5 hrs. now!!! Keep up the great work & God Bless!!
It'd be cool if y'all went to retirement homes or elderly communities to have conferences about the scams. Just a thought. Thanks for being so awesome, kind, and helpful. Love you guys!
No Thank you Pierogi for what you do for us, you scambaiters are better then the police cuz they won't do nothing, these scammers are getting out of control, I hate them money mules to cuz they are just as bad as the scammers, does the scammers pay the money mules for getting our money? And when a money mules gets busted will the police put them in jail? God Bless you ❤️
great job
08:11 is that Ali G? 😂
you rock for real
You deserve a gold eagle! What a great all American man you are.  God bless you! You make me proud!
u look good made-up.
Imagin someone entering a the local police station phone number and adrees then a police oficer name 🤣
Thank you, sincerely thank you for this video.
I miss the "Fart Spray" in view whenever I hear the mechanical sound.
“SON PLEASE DONT CRY GO GET A NAPKIN, I DIDNT RAISE YOU THIS WAY ....THIS IS UNBECOMING OF YOU !” 🤣🤣🤣🤣☠️☠️☠️☠️
Real heroes have blue hair!!!!💪🦸‍♂️
Vivian looking like a snacc
Well done .👍.  💕
🤣🤣😪😪
absolutely brilliant, like a lot
This channel could start a much larger effort. Good stuff. White hats. Sensible hats. Caring hats
Awesome!
My grandfather has gotten several calls from someone who says “grandpa, I messed up and I’m in jail. I need you to send me money to get out” The first time he went along with it until they thought he was about to send the money and then he told the scammer “I hope you rot in that cell. No one calls me grandpa”. He’s been “Pop Pop” forever and knew immediately when the scammer called him “Grandpa”. The second time he responded with “Of course I’ll send the money. Is this Steve?” The scammer latches on and says that he is. Pop pop replies “Funny, I don’t know any Steve’s” and hangs up. He’s 90 years old and sharp as a tack
I believe Mr.Beast and Pirogi are the same person lol sorry if I misspelled your name
I love it when intelligent people join forces combining their skills to fight this crime. 👏
I started answering calls from numbers I don’t recognize in French and they hang up every time.
Yessssss!! Thanks for your sacrifices Perogi! You're the BEST!
dude! you are a real version of Batman! thanks !!
Awesome
will they give up or are they thursty fo’ mor’?
This is the video I’m waiting for… giving justice to everyone.. we love you! Philippines love you..
Awesunmmm
The crying scammer can make money as an actor at Bollywood 😂😂😂😂
The fact YOUTUBERS who taught themselves hacking are stopping these scams instead of the government, speaks volumes. It is sick. What do we pay taxes for
Your old lady voice is spot on!😂thank you for what you do brother! If i ever see you I'll buy you a beer is the least i can do for helping elderly people i love your work!😊
Crying Steven should be working in Bollywood, not in a scam. He's good at crying on demand.
If at all...you end up on planing to go to India, then it could be worth getting tips from Karl Rock , he has a youtube channel and has been living and traveling in India while busting all kind of scams, he may be of some help. It would probably be worth reaching out to some local ministers of the place where you want to go first to assist you with the mission.Police is controlled and influenced by politicians to a great extent. And yes, tagging up with local people for support before hand shall be helpful and not hard to gather either as we don't want these scum bags in India either. Media shall be able to help you as well. Also just reply to this message if you have more questions , I would love to help.  Thanks for what you do and have been doing!
A real hero   A real human being
Oh you looked so pretty as a girl!  Really - very pretty. Don't get comfortable doing it though !!
Pierogi is doing god's work!
👍Good work, thank you.
i got an text scam about me having to pay for some car,i am 11.
Vivian!! Dahling, you are STUNNING!!!
Like Rakesh says " Mother yucker u r the bomb, Glitter Bomb!! tthanx". Scammers deserve more than just glitter bomb. I pray they fear heroes like you. Love from India.
US police should hire u
I had this happen to me a few months ago, I was given two separate phone numbers. One that I got the text from, and one they wanted me to call. I called Amazon's ACTUAL Customer service and gave them both numbers. I knew it was a scam because of that and I also didn't have the amount of money they were claiming to have already spent
Mark Rober is the reason why , I'm watching your channel!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Kudos to you for the fight against these scammers! Love those glitter boxes! 💰💰🤙🏻🙌🏻
You need to start teaching other people to do what you are doing so that it eventually gets to be too expensive for the scammers.
Has anyone said you and Mark Rober look alot alike?
3 very smart guys, nice work.
Pierogi in blue hair...loved it😍❤️  Good work and keep doing more harm to the shameless scammers.
I tell my parents and my siblings please decline this calls!
YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!
My nephews grandmother was told he was kidnapped and she had to drop money off. SHE DID IT. Poor old people are so easily fooled. They need to be educated about this stuff.
What a crybaby, get baby boy a tissue
next time plz send instead of a glitterbomb send a c4 bomb.  problem solved!
Here is a small hint.  The police can claim there was no crime.  So... include one dollar in the package.  Make a photo copy of the $1 note.  Now you have a record of the serial number.  You claim it was a scam and the cops have the serial numberd cask.  Once a cop sees this it should be clear evidence.  Cops like to give tickets (revinue), at least around here.  Otherwise, find them at the doughnut shop.  "QBad cop, no doughnut" applies!  Hope you have better luck.
Im not a computer guy whats a glitter bomb
I watched a video of yours that told the " car was rented in your name and in a wreck with 22 lbs of cocaine in it scam. the following week I got the same call and let them go through the whole diatribe. After they finished I asked the woman on the phone if she worked in an office with 5 guys and another woman and have a green wall and curtains with blue and white on them?  She then handed the phone to a guy to started yelling and cussing at me lol. I have only got 1 spam call since then about a month ago now
YOU, my friend are AWESOME!!🥰🥳💯
I get really weak when he says we have a special set of skills. Thank you for Liam Neeson these scammers!!! 😍😘
I love mark and  jim . Im so glad this worked out :D11:00 12:50
Love the home alone reference well done lad.
You know what stunt would get lots of views? Donating money to scammed old ladies.
So did the guy get successfully arrested and charged? Or was it all pretty fruitless besides more views for your channel?
you are the only person with blue hair I have any respect for.
so cool and a Big Thank you
The crowded distributor distally bake because step-uncle universally snatch for a overrated gun. grumpy, forgetful radar
If you go to India, please take me too!!!

The epic blue hair phase. 👍🏻
Pure gold.
Top man, love it! <3
Does the desktop access happen automatically or do you need to allow them access in order for them to manipulate files?
Look at that stupid hair… does this guy have any honest friends?! Keep on doing what you do.. just stay off camera plz!!!
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16 KJV,  Jesus Christ is the only way....
Packages with C4 set to explode when opened will stop this quickly. Trust me it will.
Love your channel SP!  New subscriber <3
Did she call the cops on herself about the glitter bomb package?? 🤣🤣🤣
You need to add dye, something like the dye packs that the banks use so that their neighbors co-workers, friends and everyone can see  that their thieves.
hi sir what if it is a website scamm investment is there a posible way to return our scammed money?
I am an Indian scientist and i offer you my unconditional apology.
This was an awesome video.... THANK you so very much for showing us how to handle these imbeciles
This is so freaking cool specially the glitter bomb
Huhuhu pls jesus help me huhuhu 😂
This is the Best video ever! One down and many more to go! I hope you can keep this going!!! Well, repaying Susan $33,000. also has been my favorite!!!
I’m new and I’m really liking you by the way I’m a boy
I forwarded this to me mam x
Look great as a woman.💋
9:27 woah Vivian is so beautiful with her moustache and her beard. So lovely 😊😊😊   And yes this is a joke
You should do a video where you have 0 balance and see what the scammer says
Please keep up the great work!😊
America is a big country but you guys dont subscribe and support this channel...share so old people out there never become victim this indian scammer sorry no all indian like them..i know a lot indian people so nice...hope indian authority and america co-operate this kind of wrong doing...God bless you Sir your the best 🙏🙏
I am hyper alert to scammers and someone tried a big one on me today on my Apple device.  My son showed me this video and I am CRACKING up!  Love this.  Thanks for all you do!
"We might just go to India some day".  I'd like to see that but... take some serious muscle, bro.
827 thieving subhuman scum disliked this video.
My man's started singing Post Malone - Congratulations
I usually keep em on the line for as long as possible......if they're talkin to me and being kept busy they're not calling someone else and scamming them. So far my record is about an hour and a half.....between talking and making em wait for me to come back to the phone.
The glitter bomb isn't necessary, funny as it is. Just have the cops there to film the receipt of the package and make the arrest.
You're doing good work, you've got my sub.
Good work cross dresser 🤣😂
Best one yet!😎
if anybody ever gets a call from so called irs or microsoft or amazon please konw this is all a scam if they start talking boout money right away than is a scam simple as that
Have you ever tried to play along when they claim they have wrongly paid money into your account to just say "Thanks for the free money but it's you're mistake so I'm not paying it back."   It would be fun to see how they react when you know the "refund" doesn't exist and they obviously know as well but you pretend that it's real and refuse to "pay them back".
A common scam here in the UK is scammers will call or text pretending to be a phone network, they have already used you name and number to contact your network and requested to activate your contract on a new sim which they have on their end. Your network sends your  pin, then they text or call asking for the pin. Many ppl tech savvy and or young fall for this, my friend did, they pretended to be him and was texting me asking for cash I called his number repeatedly and they woildnt answer. They had text everyone in his contacts, they were texting like him too using the same language and mannerisms. I got the same call last week but I strjbg them along for ages and they reacted badly. Bastards.
Crying Steven is so cringe ._.
The actually boat symptomatically boast because anthony diagnostically switch inside a evanescent lawyer. uneven, unhealthy son
I really enjoyed this video and I appreciate the efforts to educate the public but I keep thinking about the poor cop who had to deal with a car covered in glitter and smelling like roadkill...
Republicans hate "woke" people!
Thank you yet again that was awesome and I wish FBI would look more into this.  Great work. Scammers excuse is who did this and why lol
09:41 HELLO Cute, DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND ....... HAHAHAHHAHA! RESPECT FROM BULGARIA !!!
More outcomes like these please!!
Scammers cannot turn your computer on if it is NOT CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET. So if you think you have been scammed, unplug your router or click on the internet icon in your toolbar and click on disconnect there when you are not using it or leave the house. Unplugging your router is easier and quicker and your computer is safe from any and all hackers like this. If you really want to discourage them don't use your computer for about 2 weeks or more. The software that was downloaded onto your computer may have a routine in it that alerts them when you turn on your computer. These guys are busy and I don't think they will monitor you for long and get tired of the extra effort they have to put into scamming you.
Great work. Bust all the scammers.
If you can’t get law enforcement or government to help. Why not send anthrax & be done with it? Wasting glitter.
Pierogi ??? Polish or Ukrainian ? lol keep on hunting those fuckers !
Hey I was recently scammed by this wouldn't who was supported to ship me an item. She first started off by saying she is far from the city a few hours away then she said she can ship item to me. Safe said to pay though e-transfer I sent$130 free days do by the telling number status not charged and finally it for cancelled. Then she acts dum asked if I cancelled. I called shipping company they says shipper cancelled shipment. And when I told her to refund she had taken down fee FB profile and refuse to send my money.   I'm unemployed with 3 kids and one with disability and lost $130 that I was trying to do business to help with therapy. If you guys can help in some way would truly appreciate it. Love your channel. Keep up the good work.
Gosh darn it that crying Steven is such a bad actor.
Plz stay on the phone mam🤣🤣

I absolutely love your work pierogi please keep doing what you're doing and protecting us from these scammers and educating us so this does not happen to anybody else
THANK YOU, Pierogi, Mark R., and all involved for making this well - produced video and executing some justice!!! You ARE appreciated.❤️❤️💖💛💚💙🤍🤎🖤💜
I always get the ones asking me to buy them itunes gift cards to fix their phones.
If you get a call from a stranger, who then convinces you to take out thousands of dollars of cash, separate the cash into equal sized piles, into envelopes, then wrapped in foil, then some random items thrown in to confuse security measures, you dont deserve to have that much money.
When the scammer calls a stranger his mom.
scamming the scamners ... luv it 😁
The wanting beat daily touch because organ quickly pack outside a ugliest agenda. delightful, enormous farmer
Thank you for all that you do. There are a lot of people who have felt helpless after being scammed and even more who never come forward because they felt too ashamed to admit that they fell for a scam. Your work with Jim and Mark gives justice for us all.
any one that disliked this is a scammer.

You are a badass. Thank you
You three work so well with each other!  Keep up the good work. You have my heart felt thanks, my respect and most of all, my support of your channel. Thank you.
Scammer: don't click sign in* Clicked sign in*
Awesome love what you have accomplished funny way to give those chuckle heads a lesson
Because I have watched you and mark's videos, I knew the people were a scam. I messed with them a bit. Played the elderly person with no computer knowledge.

Glitterbomb needs a 140db sound bomb in it after the countdown
I'm very weirdly attracted to Vivian

The freaking scambug pretending to cry had me cracking up 😂😂
Awsome. Thank you for all you do.
That is my friend Santa Jonathan Meath at the 3:00 mark

You are a modern day hero just like Robin hood
I'll love meet u if you come to India. U can inspire a lots of youth.
I hate their filthy accents
I've not heard of a single agency in South India, so pls don't keep saying India. Mention the state where this is happening.
You can add another victim your scamed list. I just got scammed out of 9500.00.. I am 81 years old. Wish I had the info of your expertise prior.
This is the best one I've seen 😎
Hey man! Shouldn’t y’all be on, like united nation’s payroll or something? At the very least, us govt?  Kudos to y’alls!!!
👍🏼👍🏿👍🏽👍🏻👍👍🏾🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
*nice one, but the main Indian guys need to be punished too*
keep going we all are with you
My Father also Lost some of his money to these crocodiles...... In most cases they targets aged peoples ....
I know it's protecting someone's privacy but don't blur out the scammers face. The world needs to see them for who they are so the world could avoid them.
Your a living legend! From a big New Zealand fan 😊
I get scams about my "used car warranty"
I agree with you Perogi…I cannot believe that our government is allowing this BS to happen to our citizens or understand why more people are not doing something. It needs to be stopped! Thank you for what you do!
Blue hair man funny, me like him

This is my neck of the woods!!! So glad they are caught!!! Thank you for what you do!!!!
I am such a fan!!! My hero!! please attack online dating scammers!!!! i have some names to pass on to you!!!
More people need to know it's illegal to send cash through the mail that way - at least it is here in Canada... 100% get's taken by feds if/when found. That it doesn't often get found isn't so much the point as alerting these vulnerable peoples with a PSA that *_absolutely NO legitimate company will accept payment in any untraceable or illegal means, ever._* Wish the gov'ts would get on that, running those all over TV and popularizing/mainstreaming content like this would go a LONG way to cutting off their sources of victims. Those circulating PSA's we got last tax season about call scammers claiming to be federal officers for Can. Revenue helped a lot of people. :|
I think i live near mark rober! i live in san jose, CA. I can drive to sunnyvale
Yo vivian rogers 👀
I bet your parents are so proud of you for being such a wonderful person and its good to know that there are still good ppl in thisnhateful world and your parents should be proud that they raised you to be kind and a great man i hope and pray that my kids grow up to be a good person
why are they so terrible at fake crying, its litterally their job and they're trash
Your videos must be aired on mainstream TV,  Netflix to warn people of these scams.
All I have to say is Thank you!!!!
9:10 made me feel 😢 #GetThatDudeAnOscar
Bet Mrs. Pierogi 😍 did Vivian's make up for this segment. 🤣🤣🤣
Awesome
I don't know, maybe if you are on the phone with an Indian, assume they aren't legit. Americans FTW.
wait "real scammer" is int he title... i may be stupid, but were his other "scammer payback" videos fake- confuzzlement
Awsome thanks for your work!
If I had money I would give a bunch of it to you to go catch more of these fools!

You need to help stop the ones in Nigeria they’re the worst really with online romance scamming poor ladies they take thousands of dollars out of them I really feel bad about it 😔
Don't click on sign in. Okay. *clicks sign in*
Do these guys purely ask for FedEx and UPS? Because if they ever do send it via USPS, you guys should reach out to the Postal Inspectors. As stated below, it's a separate police branch in USPS and they would have more tools and be able to notice patterns (i.e. similar packages going to the same location, not a true place of business, would raise red flags) and would take that more seriously than the police would, I'm afraid. It's mail fraud and it's a federal offense. USPS does not mess around with that -- I'm a former USPS employee, so I'm confident saying that.
Fbi don't care. It's not their jurisdiction. You are so awesome! If she is an illegal or on a visa, the cop to wait until he is off duty and hunt her down? Turn her in to ICE.
This nigga Superman lol
His acting was so shitty😂
How do they ring on your phone but your talking with microphone/PC ...? Thx
Salt Lake Sector 5 , Kolkata, West Bengal is the hub of scammer in India. Mostly Bengali unemployed youth , sometimes high school and college dropout. They operate from offices in big commercial building with illegal licenses and recruit and pay young recruits around Rs12000 to Rs 15000. They operate round the clock with morning and night shifts depending on which country they want to scam. The new recruits both boys and girls are trained to talk in American and British accent and given a written script. If a recruit has previous call center experience they get a better salary and given the role of Team Leaders. Most of these call centers are fly by night operators as they know once exposed they have to dismantle and go underground. These scammers always come back in a new location with new recruits once the law enforcement stops looking for them. Many such call centers have been raided and closed down but the easy money involved always brings them back. Youtube along with scam busters like you have created a big difference and awareness about these scammers. They now find difficult to scam easily but still some innocent gets caught.
My mum is 70. She has never lost any money to a scammer. She baits them with innocence and fear and then calmly says, just hold the line a second, I'm on a conference call with the Australian Federal Police! Cracks me up! Good work guys!
Their using telco accts as well. They are claiming that the victim has a past due balance and was forwarded to collections.
You have any merch i can buy?
Awesome thank you!!!
Thanks Viv!  A grateful Canuk.
Good job 👏 guys..

If you go to India, that'll be so amazing and make this channel even bigger! Thank you for your hard work
Ashamed that few from my country are doing this. Please do not judge the people of my country based on these frauds. I feel sorry for all the loss that people had due to these scum bags.

Lorem Ipsum Gorilla laughs out loud to the "at the moment" 805 scammers that gave this video a thumbs down". Lorem Ipsum Gorilla will never send tree leaves, and delicious roots to scammers. Where can I get some of that glitter?.
Jim Browning is so scary, I’d hate to be on his bad side and have him connect to my PC 🤣🤣 also I love everything that you all do to protect our elderly ❤️❤️
These Indians should take up acting in Bollywood with some of the performances they pull off 😂
Such a legendary Video
❤️
Thank you for calling to the chicken curry cancelation department how can I relp jou? You want to cancel your chicken curry? NO!
Please do more of this! We can get them to give up.
Excellent! I'm a little apprehensive about the cross dressing and makeup, but if it helps to protect against scammers, then yeah I'm up for it. Not sure about panties and bra though - does anyone know if this is mandatory?
this man is a legend
They'd get like $17 from me
The dislikes come from the people that scam
Well done guys!!!!
i like how he has a green thingy and does not use it lol

I'm guessing the load of people who dislike these videos are some of the scammers who wish this guy and others like him would please stop calling them out! Hahahaha!
No offense, I appreciate what you are doing. But the editing of your videos is so freaking obnoxious and annoying. It makes your videos nearly unwatchable.
Thanks for your work,  all this has to grow massivelly, big support from Spain!!
Ya'll know what to do: ~Like ~Subscribe ~Comment ~SHARE!! EVERYWHERE!! 💕
I never knew fighting crime could be so much fun. Love Vivian and her sassy attitude.
🤣 Yes, I'm crying because you still haven't sent the package yet 😂😂
I love this because it educates me about this things are happening in there. I'm from Argentina, our scammers are practically copycats of your scammers so this keeps me alert for a future thief trying to call me to give them all the money I have. So I will basically translate this to everybody that will hear me. Thank u very much again to you and mark rober

One of the greatest things I ever did was to save an old guy gettign scammed out of £5000. So Im a taxi driver, and I was sent to pick a old guy in Brighton England. He got into my car and started telling me his story. His landlord has gone on Holiday, and these "Builders" turned up today saying thye had to do soem work on the house thathis landlord had asked them to do. But the Landlord had nto paid them the money, and that he needed to go to his bank and withdraw the money to pay them. His landlord was not able to be reached as he was on a flight. It just didnt seem rtight to me, but the old guy was determined to go to the bank. On the Journey to the bank, I convinced him to get the bank to call the police, as he was now scared of going back home to where these builders are, he was also worried about wasting police time if the story was genuine. I told him, the police would not be concerend about you wasting their time if their story was genuine, but they would be more concerened if it was not.  Anyway I dropped the guy off and thats the last I heard for about a week. Then I get a call from the police, and they asked if I remember the guy I took to the bank, my stomach fell and thought he had been scammed, but no, he had taken my advice and got the bank to call them, and the police asked what made me give them that advice, and I toild them I had been watching this Youtube channel about people being scammed (Scammer Payback) and that I just thought it didint sound right and you (the police) wouldnt mind being called out if a the builders story was was genuine but would be worse if it wasnt and he lost a load of money, they said I was correct, it was a scam, and they had 3 people in custody, and if I could attend and ID parade as I could identify at least one of them.  You are truly doing gods work and waking peopel upto these evil peopel praying on the elderly and vulnerable.
The only awareness I see nowadays are commercials by insurance companies and that's it, and they give little to no information on the steps of a scam. In the sea of other vapid ad space, it's barely doing anything I bet.
If the Pope doesn't already have a patron saint of Glitter Trapping, I think you should be Christened!!
Feels so bad and stressed to be an Indian. this is what happens when you have massive unemployment in the country people resort to these malpractices. viewers India is not like this we have good and honest people here, these scammers should be punished
I got one for you the state that I live in every single year messes up on my paperwork mysteriously and say that they never know how that happens. I have gotten to the point that I no longer think it's the state I think it's a scam this might be something for you guys to look into as well! Please get ahold of me if you think it might be something you would be interested in.
As a retired cop, I want to commend you as well as thank you for the work you are doing to protect the innocent!
Thankyou so very much.
If you ever come to India your stay is on me bro. Good work 👍🏼
Good job brother god bless you and your family for what are you doing
The annoying party coronally scrub because respect perceptually fear to a tranquil helicopter. outgoing, amused beast
You're a good dude...
They do this shit here in Germany too, thankfully lots of older people here are knowledgeable about this kind of stuff or at least don't trust people easily over the phone because this kind of stuff has happened for decades now. Still, they get people regularly. I used to work for a bank and I had a customer who was scammed call me at least once a day or every other day and my co-workers had similar experiences.
You are a Hero 🙏
😂😂😂
There is some business fronts in texas... Plano and Florida...
That glitter bomb was hilarious. This was America giving the bird to these jerks
All jokes aside; you guys are heroes. Seriously.
Scammer Payback,  I really hate these scammers,  they've been trying to get my mom for the past year,  her bank dropped her as a client,  because the scammers hit her account twice,  I've stopped her two other times from sending them money orders,  but I'm pretty sure they're still trying to get money from her,  she's 70 years young and retired,  so she's on a fixed income,  can you please help us? I would really appreciate it.  Thank you.

Have you ever offered the senior citizen advocates like AARP and AMAC  your Extremely important advice and your videos?
YEEEEEEEEEES. Please continue doing this work! F those scammers! This is one of the reasons why we never let grandma touch a computer or even be on the phone like this. These scammers are horrible and deserve every smelly glitter bomb.
Love the loo roll at the scammwrs place, he'll need everybit of thag tissue for thag issue
This is the perfect video to show to my audience that are in ham radio. I know this sounds stupid probably… But the average age of a ham radio operator today is 72 years old. Many ham operators are widowers who live alone and are very lonely. I’d be truly honored to be able to show this on my channel. I think it could help many people. Thank you for doing what you’re doing… May God continue to bless you.  Larry de K7HN
I'M SO HAPPY I'VE FINALLY MET VIVIAN <3

I feel a version of this video should become a P.S.A., I think it could do a lot of good if it's shown on the major news networks. (preferably after edits to not give the scammers too much info on Pierogi, like animating or dialog only the phone calls portion.)
I f#*cking despise scammers. The public should be made more aware by our gvts as adverts on TV. That's the best way to help stop this. Maybe the scam busters can get the public to pull together & fund to film an advert to be played on prime time TV. I'd be happy to chip in for that.
I hope more people who have amazing tech expertise do what you, Jim, and Mark do. Unfortunately it’s pretty needed.
I hate scammers so I am learning hacking so I could track them and meybe report them to the Indian government
Showing this to my parents, they get the amazon scam all the time. Love what yall do, subscribed
Was anyone successfully prosecuted over this? Great work and video but I’m curious if any of these people actually faced justice.
I always put a metal pot lid over my phone and rap on it with a wooden spoon
Love the police and don't be people that hate them they don't shot black people for no reason they don't do any bad stuff there are here to keep us safe
Hey! Cheers to you and to Mark Rober who I am subscribed to (Love his videos). I applaud your efforts to get these thieves back for what they do to our elderly population. As a woman of a certain age I feel I can speak to this problem. Just because my BC says I was born in '54 doesn't mean I act or look like a little old lady. I don't. I do, however feel like I have to do my part to protect the innocents who aren't quite as hip to this stuff. I just now subscribed to your channel, too. Thank you!
Not all heroes wear capes
I thought you were Mark Rober lmaoo yall look like identical twins
Is it really possible to access some online bank accounts with passwords that can be stored in the chrome browser? This seems very lax security at the back's end of things. I don't think that has ever been possible at any of the banks I have used in the Uk since forever.
I can see the chinese on the plastic bag on the left camera. Clearly she's a chinese who went to an asian grocery store before picking up the package.
The standing hammer nearly gaze because spear socially yawn before a  frequent alley. icky, striped voice
Save a glitter bomb for my 93 year old grandma. She just got scammed for $8,500 by some slick talking fake lawyer  "James Matthews" from New York, who used my name to embroil her in his con. He used mobile phone spoofing to mask his NY number (area code 913) with my NV number (area code 775). I only found out because he tried it on some guy in Michigan who warned me my number was being spoofed.
The curvy salad alarmingly instruct because singer essentially confess up a humorous tennis. woozy, dispensable pump
Joke's on the scammers. I never answer my phone unless it's someone in my contacts because I have severe anxiety.
Vivian Hellen Virinica Rogers. Legendary name.

I don’t know why they alway block the criminals face. Even on the news they do it.
Not all heroes wear capes... some tell steven to stop crying
you just taught us how to send cash via mail. lols.
Thanks bro for helping some random person I am from India if u need any help I can

Thank you💗 last year my 85 yr old mom had a scammer call her and say my son ,they said his name was in the hospital ,out of state, he was hurt and she should and needed to hurry and send 1k $ luckily she called me before she mailed the $. Scammers suck! Thanks again,I love when they r caught!
Not all heroes wear capes. Sometimes they wear Santa hats and deliver glitter bombs. So refreshing to see that every now and then some of these scum bags actually get caught.
I want a Vivian Rodgers t-shirt
I'm so proud of you.. and I'm an Indian.. Let's make him popular in India 🙏🏾❤️🙌🏽
Mark is not just a guy as you said! Ask him! He is a nasa engineer! 🤣
I saw Jim Browning's video few weeks ago and now I know who was his partner 😁👍
Hi bro,  I am from INDIA.  Hearing that most of the scams are from INDIA I feel so bad the police here is not taking any action. I am still young and my dream is to be a police officer I promise that I will change it once I have the rights . Again I am so sorry for all of you guys who got scammed . Thank you
So wholesome
Every time I read "I love you" on the screen, it makes me smile.
Thank you
Thank you for your work! All of these a$$holes need to pay for the misery the cause. I have known so many people to fall victim of scams and its truly sad. I can't wait to see some really BIG take downs in the future! We know its coming! And, a world world full of AI disrupting these peoples world.
Wow, this is really informati--*Sees Pierogi in a dress and makeup*       Well, that's enough Youtube for today
the 778 people who disliked are scammers
LMAO. HAHA I LOVE YOU. AWESOME
Man i really enjoy your videos. I wish i could do what you do. I think it's amazing
Steven williams. Hahaha. Just waiting to here john doe. My god
You guys should send the glitter 💣 to India 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thanks to all of you! 💐 Forwarded this video to many people working with elderly people
My father was a victim of one of these crappy INDIA scammers after he had his stroke. I am so glad people like you are in the world, we can now fight back and make these scum relize, the world will not take there shit anymore
Thank god, keep doing what ur doing man.
I want to help. I'm not tech savvy. I've watched your videos and Jim Brownings. I tell my UPS Store customers about these scams when I hear red flag words. I've stopped a few shipments and alerted corporate. We even worked with the government. Someone was shipping money in bed clothes.
Wow... i am so thoroughly impressed. My son loves watching Marks channel hence this was suggested. Wow.
You are doing an awesome job! Keep up the great work and thank you...
Thanks so much Pierogi.
The blue hair makes you look like Antifa.  But I still love you
Amazing!!!!
I support what you are doing but. People have to start being smarter and NOT call them back or answer the phone when someone they don't know calls.
I always wince when they give their name as something like "Steven Williams" or "John Martin" while speaking with a heavy southeast Asian accent.
I've never been scammed, but I love what you are doing for the victims! Thanks for being one of the "good guys"! The world thanks you too!
Thank you for what you do
Thank you so much from South Africa
but you only got the mule........
HaHAHAHA!!!!
You guys rock!!!
Thank you 🙏
Freaking awesome. Thank you
I saw this on his channel too. This is great.❤
4:49 dumb & dumber reference...
Salute 🙌🏾‼️
Instead of glitter they should fill it with doe scent.
This was amazing
Thank you so much for doing this. I just hate when they go for the older people. I stop a man who was going to buy Apple Card’s.
Im not a fan of Halloween costumes; however, I am stoked to dress up as Vivian. She’s toads my hero. Vivian is the new Batman basically. You just need the film script now...I’m almost certain Christian Bale would be down for this vigilante role.  For real though, all these videos and Mark’s give me the chills. Your work is simply incredible.
We love yah brother, please go after BISWAJ... Their really going large scale and are getting away with it.
Waaaay yeeeaaaah !!! 👍🤯
Some people are actually addicted..to stealing a package..that is out there somewhere, calling their name . Wierd ...
Wow...free money for everybody ! Lying and stealing are punishable by God .
4:50 lol "Mary Swanson" I got the reference
Very sad, glad you are helping the elderly.
We get scam calls all the time in the U.K. Thank you so much for fighting on behalf of us all but especially on behalf of older people. I have an 84 year old mum who is as sharp as a tack and keeps scammers on the phone for as long as she can playing daft and giving nothing away to try and delay someone else being duped. Thank you so very much.
This is so great. I get i know 20-50+ calls a day most days. Thankfully my phone has started blocking after a half ring on the majority now. I've been watching since yesterday. All of you guys. Keep the greet work up. Very much appreciated.
Damn I wish there was more glitter. Those people are scum!
I LOVE YOU! This happened to my dad. He's 78 and lost over 250k from his bank of America account. It took a month to get it back but they were able to cancel the wire. They legit wired the money from his own account by asking him to login to his bank account. My dad lost his mind after this and we had to get my mom away from him for 6 months. This victimization of already vulnerable people can completely break them and erode their sense of self. Please stop these people. They are destroying peoples lives.
even the Russians are tired of these scammers lol
This is quality, well done man
Thanks so much for taking the time and helping people❤️  Hopefully more people who are text savvy will join the fight. I will keep you in my prayers🌸
THANKS soooo much🙏🏻✊🏻🤗
Our countries need adequate policies🤷🏻‍♀️ and laws that take into account all this mass lawlessness. So far, only a few police officers and the people themselves are protecting citizens...
The cop that pulled her over was probably like “damn girl did you shit yourself”
Why doesnt the us just lob a fuckin nuke at the whole area in india
The 'I love you' was a hilarious touch. 😄
When he started calling you mom 😭🤣😂
Yeah it's funny how many people didn't like that there probably was scammers maybe the cops to track their unlike buttons
So Happy there are people like you. You are especially helping seniors
The police actually did their job?  Does anyone else remember that Mark only made the glitter bombs in the first place because the police were too lazy to pursue justice WITH EVIDENCE?  Glad they're finally embarrassed enough to do what they're paid for 🤣
Thank you for what you do!  Scammers SUCK!
Why aren’t people in India doing more? Im sure there are some, but there obviously needs to be more.
If only you could access their bank accounts and transfer everything to a victims fund. I understand it would be performing an illegal act, but it would be totally deserved and who would argue against it?
Wow,  you guys are huge heroes!
Way to go!!!
Amazing! Great work. God bless you.
LOVE YER WORK!!!    Cannot say it Enough!   WHOWAAAA
Ahaha
Mark is a legend. Pierogi is my favorite.
Let's get the dirty cops in on this. Let them loose on these scum.
Glitter bombs RULE, put Liquid Ass in there!
10:20  Where the glitterbomb part of the video begins.
Good job. It will be really helpful to show people how to recover from pop up scam.
Vivian, time for your weekly Nair.
Why do you protect these scammers by blurring out their face?  They should be highlighted if anything.
Stop calling it a scam it’s downright theft
Thank you so much!  God send you people to help us.  Hope you will continue the Good and Excellent job. God Bless and protect you!
vivi looking fine doe xD
Wszystko pięknie fajnie ale od pierogów to Ty się odpierdol
I just love what you’re doing. I friggin hate scammers. Sick of scumbags.
Imagine these people are such pieces of s#!t.. Fart spray doesn't even effect them..
I want to learn what you’re doing to help you fight scammers and get them busted and help victims out too. I am sick of getting scam calls . I just subscribed to your channel . Every day I get scam calls about my electric bill being late or IRS scam and so on.
My man said, "dub ledub ledub dot com."
I have a land line and can't take it with me to take cash out of the bank........I never send cash through the mail........who cares if the scammer loses their job......they altered the amount once they can change it back........crocodile tears......none of them wear masks in the call centers so they'll all die of covid19....,they have no use for your money anyway......
Adult children need to take away their parents computers if they are so confused.  And really they shouldn't be doing online banking if they don't realize this is a scam.  I am not being mean but it is so obvious.
What a video. I had NO idea how in-depth these scams are (and with the glitter bombs!  Hee hee!!!). Thank you for doing what you do.
Glad that POS was arrested.
dude amazing work! very informative and illuminating! what a world we live in.
I'm so glad to see two of my favorite youtubers collaborating and also I love the inspiration to do this to those punk scammers.
Dream Team!
Yo the home alone quote just makes it
Is glitterbombing... legal?
looks like you got about 770 scammers who watched your video
If only our Govt. was as enthusiastic about these crimes.
I love that you were able to team up with Mark Rober. Been watching both of you scam the scammers and porch pirates for a while now.
Top notch 👌👏 this man is legendary
thank you for doin this god bless you
Do you have any interest in being on prime TV? I'm thinking episodes the likes of you, Browning and kitBoga should be airing at 7pm on FOX.
You guys are great. Keep on truckin.
Is that an alarm clock I hear??? 'Cause everyone needs to wake up.
authority reaaly dumb and noob. . they do not know how to trace back since they're not ex-Hanzai-sha.. or Howaitohattohakkā
Dude. Vivian is awesome hahahahahahahaha
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! 'This is unbecoming,  I didnt raise you this way' 🤣🤣🤣
Impressed to know that people would still believe and do all that workaround to post the money off .
y'all be careful commenting on these pages. I never received those shady scam messages. but I commented last month a lot on pierogi and kitboga videos, this month, I received 2 spam Amazon emails, 1 Amazon scam message and someone tried to login to my Instagram.
Governments are too slow for the internet, it needs people like you.
I just got this scammer call with the same exact tactic 2 days ago
I adore those glitterbombs!
Great work!
How could someone with on the ground experience and connections in West Bengal help?
9:27 You beat the crap out of Mrs. Doubtfire!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
keep doing what you're doing
I get so depressed seeing scammers get away with it.  This is so good. Job well done.  Thank you for caring.
Pierogi :) any east european family ? :D
EPIC - Keep up the fight brother
I get a call from these scammers, I just mess with them as long as I can.  It’s funny how long I can hold them for.  At least while they are wasting time with me, they aren’t stealing from anyone else who will fall for these scams.
How do you get scam leads? Can people forward them to you?
thank you bro, dont go to india tho.......
I always wondered why Mark chose that poor delivery method. The compressed air explosion with covering ALL the room would be better. Vote up for Mark to see for v4
I recently got a message saying I was owed money from Amizon, I New it was fake because I’ve never bought anything from Amizon!, lol
God bless you!!!
We need Team like you to save us from these scammers... I almost gave all my details once when I received a call from Social Security Office saying that my SSN has been compromised and that a legal action is in place... Thats when I got to know that its a SCAM and Social Security Office would NEVER call us...
Thank you for your great work and caring, I’m definitely sharing your channel to as much as people I know
He might have gotten arrested, but his pants were goddamn fabulous
Super proud of you, Pierogi! Well done! Kudos to Mark and Jim for helping you pull this off.
Great job mate! Well done!
Simply said THANK YOU, my father in law gets calls daily!
Great collaboration everyone!!! Thank you very much for everything that you all do, it’s a small space of special people who do great work and save people, and there’s nothing that can say thank you enough, but thank you 🙏🏼 thank you 🙏🏼 thank you for all your hard work and efforts, especially because once you’ve been scammed there’s nothing that you can do - yes, you report it Ect, but nothing happens, once you’ve been scammed - that’s it! So, again, I sincerely appreciate all your hard work and time, spreading awareness about how they do these scams, and showing how real people are treated and everyday people get scammed and manipulated and they have no remorse whatsoever, and they don’t care that you don’t have rent or food or medicine, they don’t care, and it’s so heartwarming to see that people do care and, care enough to do this, because there’s nothing that victims can really do... so thank you 🙏🏼♥️
This should be shown to old folks as required viewing for social security.
I hate these scammers 😠
Your a Good Soul
This is gold man, absolute gold! You got one! Without all the bureaucratic bull crap!
3:19 CRA Favicon? :-D
Now go after Soros!
thanks from Denmark :-)
Dude... F-OFF! You totally clickbaited  hundreds of thousands of viewers into thinking you were actually going to show "justice." But you just ended the video right when justice was *about* to be served! You suck!
Thank you for all that you’re doing to frustrate these evil doers. I can’t believe people fall for these scams... These videos really help educate  thousands of people...Good luck and thanks for being creative
awesome !! keep doing it !!!
Hey Pierogi, you single?
no more lipstik
Love
So rewarding! Great job guys!
All this collaboration is really going down the rabbits hole, amazing job guys
So how do we join up with you? Other than cash?
You are FANTASTIC! and I rause a glass to Vivian!!! These pondlife make me sick, knowing "Vivian" is almost 80...they manipulate, shout, make her cry, they are not humans! I hope the police can work with you and your 2 friends,seriously! If theyre in your country illegally too, they should be deported too!! Ive started to get scam calls here in UK, I just let them talk and waste their time...I wish I had your technology to do the same! But I shall leave it to you.....the professional. We are all behind you!!
It pays to be a skeptic. I question everything. I’m 75 but I have a bullshit radar that’s off the charts. The old adage “trust but verify“. But I have one question. I do 95% of my computing on my iPad now. Is it as vulnerable as a desktop? And are Macs in general still less vulnerable to hacking? (I always keep my system software up-to-date.) They used to say that the scammers didn’t bother with Macs because there were fewer of them out there, so they weren’t worth their time. But Apple hasn’t been a niche product for years. I’ve also heard that Windows leaves ports open that pose a security risk and Mac doesn’t. Don’t know if that’s true now – or if it ever was. Some of that might be wishful thinking.
Glitter bombed woman..."but Officer, I don't know what you're talking about" while wearing glitter bombed pants sparkling in the sun,,,hahaha!  Good one!  Better than a fingerprint!
I live in England and unfortunately our government are more disgusting than these scammers, (they blatantly rob us). Well done for your efforts. India is a mess at the moment and i suspect many will die due to the awful regime that they live under
if someone transferred 50k and he would lose his job if i don’t. send it back ill just take the money -_-
Any collaboration with @Scammer Revolts?
If the government was working for us they would put ads all over the medias like TV to warn the elderly. But sadly the government is not on our side...
God bless always sir.
Okay... You enjoyed dressing up as Vivian way too much....  :-)
damn you are a pro troll! Did they got arested after all?
why not show their faces so public is more aware?
keep up the great work!
Doing the work of God !!!
Who dislikes a video like this? Is that the scammers?
Over 700 scammers disliked this video.
Found you through Mark’s channel. Thanks for what you do, dude!
Thanks for all of your great work! You’re helping so many people 🙏♥️
Whoahahahahahaha....i love you vivian!!!!! ❤❤❤🤣😂😂🤣😂😃
A genuine "Thank You" for fighting to stop scammers.
Why his your government  letting  them get away with  this  why dont they broadcast.  this on all channels  in every sate why are people so dumb  in America  no disrespect  to you over the pond please please  get it broadcast  every day these  scamper  what locking  up gor life
❤
Here's some serious commitment in this video. I finally could see my hero all dressed up and ready to scam back
14:04, Thank YOU. The effort you put in and the hard work you all do makes this possible.  Thank you for caring at all. :)
You’re education clips have saved me.
ahhh Peirogi !!! love it....
You are amazing!Thank You!!!!!!
It's sad that some people feel their only path to success is through fraudulent means. A 40 hour a week job isn't glamorous, and it doesn't always get you a lavish lifestyle, but you can sleep with a clear conscience and you won't have to worry about how your cellmate feels about you.
You know the gal that opened the glitter bomb was thinking "if I wanted to be covered in glitter, I would have kept on being a stripper".
Dude .. don't go to India. The criminals there don't give a fuck about human life. Don't risk your life going there. It is highly corrupt.
You’re a hero! Go get a cape!
Epic video. Epic ending. Went a little too far with the dress and wig and shit though....haha
You are amazing 👏
every scammer  should get  a glitter bomb
Pahst Malone lmao
They need to do news items about this around Jeopardy or something.
“David Brauwn from Windoaws ”
I will sponsor you if you publish all their personal information.
incredible work sir...
EEEEY i have the same blue hair  🦋🐟🐬
You guys are heros, looking out for the elderly, they are so quick to send money. Keep going man!
Oh my god. The emotional manipulation and crying from these guys is so pathetic.
Oh my god. The emotional manipulation and crying from these guys is so pathetic.
That was hilarious! Thank you guys for fighting against these losers . Y'all are great!
When you're in their computer, can't you upload some sort of virus to disable their entire system?
I adore you. 💕💕💕
Why blur out her face? Public deserves to know who she is.
show faces!! show those losers
You’re awesome!!!!
BogaBusted! You just lapped my man.
I can't believe that anyone would actually post them money! Elderly or not. This is insane. Thank you for taking on these scum bags!
I love the congratulations. hahah 5:05
Singing was perfect 👌
Thank you. Finally we see the police step in and actually get someone. You and your confrère are magnificent people.
You are the peoples superhero, thank you
C’mon. Was that really payback? Looks like you hooked a simple middle person. Brains behind the operation appear to be happy and free.
What a piece of poop 💩 Steven is
You look good
Please start some sort of a glitter bomb account. I would donate on a monthly basis!
Keep it up. You need a snitch here in India? Hit me up.
i got scamd on a $199 pen it was calld scrible art pen it said it cold drol in 16 milleon colors can you help me plz
Love love love it !!!!
1000 to  1, likes vs dislikes.  Incredible!
The only calls I get on our landline these days are these b@stards, Infected Computer scammers, and dead air calls (presumably verifying the number works). Oh, and my mother-in-law.
This video is so haunting. My grandma received a call from “me” asking her to send me money because I had gotten arrested and I didn’t want my wife to know. I’m so thankful the guy at the bank saw it for the scam it was and had her call me first. It’s also haunting knowing that that package went to a town close to where I live...
You are a hero, The real Justice League
Blue really man. I'm out. Unsub.
You should work for the Feds....good job!
Brilliant work boys 👍👍👍👍
I’m curious how they would respond once you’ve been asked to check your bank account you then telling them you did.. on your phone(or other device besides your pc
Vivian!  She's an amazing woman. 😍
The real justice league!!! I love you guys!!
Amazing work. I see you collaborated with the police on this. 😃
ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha oh that was... get em good will ya. Goes straight to India, Passes 9 go lines, collects $1800, and gets a send someone else to jail free card.
Priceless - wow, just wow.  Thank you.
The fact you and Mark are allies makes me moist.
Wouldn't be surprised if that money mule claimed the police harassment him and tries to sue.
they can't unblur their faces because despite them being grimy, slimey, disgusting scammers, they can't show their face without their permission. Youtube would definitely get bunched up about it if they did unblur their face.
Why was that guy recording himself opening the box from the bed?
The governments across the globe = pure shit. I put together a flash drive exposing the identify of a scammer with his many illegal businesses, I even baited him, exposing his in a picture, linked back to his main accounts, on 6 social media platforms. Yet, the U.K is allowing this man to steal across the globe and the tinder bandit continues to make fake sites, luring men and stealing crypto. I've reached out to other people who claim they shut down scammers. But no one hears me though.
Well done
Why would you blur that scumbags face?
Thank you. I can’t believe that some many people think it is okay to take advantage of the elderly.
I love vivian with the red lipstick and 5 o'clock shadow! But really you have to wonder if the government is getting a kickback from the scammers.
I can’t stop watching these videos. Netflix needs to pick this up
Good Job!
this is fake cause why ever @ 13:14 would the guy opening the box also be recording themselves on their iphone🤣🤣
Now I've watched all three povs and this is beyond amazing
she didnt even get put in cuffs.... this is bs
Pierogi you are so very cool 😎 Absolutely luv it 🤣 Biggest thanks for teaching people what scammers do & protecting them as well well done 👏
There's a scam going on in my city at a drive thru carry out. When you pay with a card employees take a picture of your card unbeknownst to you then steal money thru those cash exchange apps (they used a popular one but can't think of the name) they created a fake account for my card then sent themselves $3,000! Thank goodness I've got text alerts on and noticed within minutes even though it showed up as an out of state charge. I knew it had to be those employees since I hadn't used that card in the last few days. Local police said they couldn't do anything and to call my card company. That was an act of Congress but not as much as trying to get customer service for the app as there's no contact info for them. Luckily the card company not only refunded all of it but after they're investigation gave me another $3k! I've talked to several victims of these same employees and there are quite a few. The store owner wouldn't return my calls even though I know him personally. I'm seriously thinking of contacting the prosecutor's office because somebody NEEDS to stop these thieves and give them the punishment they deserve!!
Fantastic video!👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
hey  can u find my phone which was robbed in india can u plzz?
Nope.  Thank you for trying to protect our elderly.  You're adorable.  😜
Be careful out there.  Always people trying to pick "easy" targets to try and get ahead the easy way.  😒
Great Job bro. When are you visiting India? Do visit India its a great country only few bad people (which are everywhere in the globe) are making India ashamed. Anyway good job done.
Love ❤️ that blue hair! A total turn-on !

Bless your heart young man! Its nice to see there are still good men out there! Thankyou for your good heart and sharing your knowledge!
How do people fall for this? I will pay you to teach me how to do this
Thank you for all your hard work please don't stop the good fight keep going
Pierogi - made in Poland stuff:)
God bless...
Awesome 👍👍👍
Have had these ph calls, claiming from being from taxation dept, so rang tax dept, gave them the phone number etc, and as I thought was a scam. Have helped stopping other people being scammed also, seeing the fear in these people’s face, when we tell them its a scam and not to buy the google cards, and not to ring the scammers back, these poor ppl are literally sweating in fear of going to jail!, its horrible to see, but am proud to say have helped a few ppl not get scammed. Your doing a valuable job, please don’t stop!, its people like you who saves lives, their retirement money, their sanity! ,bless you xxx
BRAVO ZULU!!!
Shame on Indian Gov there as much as Guilty Scammer. Wake up everyone IRS doesn't call you on your cell phone. Call your local FBI office they can help us bring these guys down. Thank you for teaching us you're a legend to me.
Entertaining ! these "scams" are  toothpick-size fries compared to those almost-impossible-to-bust multi-billion/trillion $ "fraud" and "scamsters"  ...  The saviors all seem to be of one particular ethnic extract and the evil guys all happen to be other than..  What's the framing all about ? what's the 'master narrative' all about ?..  Aram, Porul, Inbam, Veedu
That was the best Job.
BTW the sapphire hair is hot!
That was amazing
Good god you make a beautiful woman. So jealous.
13:56 Oh, I love your new glitter jeans!
your a hero man !
Thank you! ❤️
Great Work1
I bet that cop was like “huh, all this glitter... and why do you smell so bad?!
This was truly amazing!! You ROCK!!! 👊🏽👊🏽
Wondered if you called help me. I went on to aliexpress to buy some watches. I very stupidly sent around $600 to a PayPal acc. I have the mobile number of the so called seller. This was in October 2020. And nothing has ever arrived. They say my items are on hold in the uk awaiting me to pay another $150 which I will then get refunded. Can you do anything using the mobile number to possibly get anything done. Ty Dennis Lamb
👍 just fr u!🙂
Hate to say it but Vivian would be attractive if she shaved.
I wouldn't recommend going to India.
These men are heroes! 100% brilliant payback. Keep up the great work.
Enjoy watching your videos.  I get calls like this everyday!  I have subscribed to your channel.  You’re amazing!  Keep doing you thing you saving lives : )
I do not really understand  why you order something and let it droped infront of the house , in my country we have delivery on time , when you know you be home so you can take the package yourself  the most expensive thing availible to be stolen will be your post with some preordered magazines ....
thank you for your efforts
Thank you thank you thank you your more than IRON MAN LOVE YOU BROTHER!
you know what, there are 728 scammers who have seen this video.
Is it against YouTube rules to say “fuck them...” because I want to express my displeasure with those pieces of shxx, but I also want to follow the fucxxxx YouTube rules...
Vivian Rogers was scary looking
YOU Rock! Sink All these Dirty Rotten Bastards

I've been watching a lot of your videos.   I like the way that you broke this down step by step as to what was happening.   Thanks for what you do, and hopefully some laws will be changed so they can be put in jail. You obviously track them down and have everything that law enforcement needs to arrest them.
You are greatly loved and highly prized ♥️
Good job sir !
"I didn't raise you this way." 😂
I never ever get these calls :(
Those people deserve a real nuclear bomb! not  a Glitterbomb
Oh wow I saw this on that guys channel but he never mentioned you!! Only Jim Browning 😩😩
Thank you for being a positive addition to this world. ❤
I watched this on marks YouTube legendary and good luck keep up the amazing work
A scammer once called me and I didn't realize that I was on speaker so the scammers heard me say their in Kolkata and that screwed them up:D
Sod the glitter put some Surströmming in there and blow that all over them.
You guys are solid gold heroes.

Well done guys, I’m glad that there are still good people left in this screwed up world 👍😎
Well done, keep at it :)
Well done guys.
This video was just an excuse for you to come out the closet and dress in drag
Thank you for what you are doing. This is a great service to innocent citizens and nothing less than a community service. I would like to expose a scammer saloon owner in Kolkata and a scam Travel Agent in Costa Rica. Please let me know if there's anything you can do to help expose them.
Damn, gurl! Those nails! 💅
I need your help, for the court in UK charge me lots of money and no explanation or details about, just take from my wages even sending letters from no we're declaring amounts that I never ever see the colour. It is out rage and chame that envolve court of London department. I ask for any help to know ho or how they can Still continuing that scam.
You got my sub homie. What you do means a lot!
Thank you.
I tell you what it's a good thing that someone's actually cracking down you know it's supposed to be the police's job to go after those people the first place I mean hell we pay our taxes to cover their expenses I mean our tax funds go straight in there checks up the time their government money I mean it's a police officer's job to enforce the law and rest those who is breaking it yet a crime like that over the internet or over the phone happens every single day rather be c**************** exploiting which Google is bad at that Google has always been bad at that and same with other websites how this year they finally made report system to take those things down but it doesn't stop the people from posting it and at the same time exploiters and hackers and internet thieves and the identity thefts they get away with s*** every single day and yet they're breaking the law every single day and yet a common neighborhood thief can go and steal a TV and serve a lot of time in jail while some internet m*********** goes and steal somebody's money a walks away Scott free every single day we've got the technology to get s*** done they got the technology to get s*** done to be cracked down on these people and they act like oh they're from another country we wouldn't be able to find them well they'd be wrong because first off a police force can contact another place for organization even if that police force organization happens to be from another country a country who you are not at war with they know that the country leaders know that and yet they act like they can't even do that to start an investigation to crack down on him scammers to start arresting every single one of them pick up so bad here in the US that police officers weren't even going after the freaking porch pirates now they mean the porch pot thieves he kept going around stealing packages getting a UPS the mail and all them in trouble for it it's like the ones that didn't want to do what even when contacted about a package it's like come on now an item has been stolen it's like track the thief down already and go arrest them so I get it they don't want to go on a wild and goose chase chasing somebody who they can't find or have no info on but it's not like they can't take the time to dig up information to track somebody down they do it every single day whenever an escape convict breaks out of prison for f*** sakes I don't know why they won't do it whenever a scammer pops around and makes those calls and steal something or when a porch thief steal something
I love how you put fake nails on 😁😁
How embarrassing it must be to be caught by the cops with your lap covered it glitter and your car smelling foul.  "We're on the lookout for individuals who might be involved in international wire fraud."  "Well, officer, clearly not me..." "Would you step out of the car?"  "...why?"  "Because we were informed that the mule would receive a glitter package that dispenses fart spray and would be talking... kind of like that foul-smelling, glittery box in the passenger seat..."
You are such a hero 🤩
I answer scam calls, I mess about with them saying dumb stuff like  “ you know, I had explosive dioreeah once”   And yes, I know that’s not how u spell diohoreeah of whatever
There is more to this story. She doesn't get arrested unfortunately.
unrelated but the hair color is awesome
India may have the biggest movie industry in the world but I don't think it has any place for crying Steven... That's some horrible acting 😂
Catfish to Catching scammers bet bet Pepper spray bomb next time 😂
"PAH-ST MALONE" 😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😅😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Keep up the good work Perogi
LOL Steven Williams is probably the whitest sounding name, but has the heaviest Indian accent. Sounds legit.
Americans have to put pressure on their govt to stop this from happening through meaningful action like sanctions.
9:27  She is back, everybody. From the kitchen to the makeup, Vivian has levelled up.
thank you guys so much from a guy who takes care of his grandma what yall doin means so much wish i could help yall out in some way but again thank you all so much
I am from Indian Kolkata. When ever you wants to come inform me you can stay at my place. Keep doing this good jobs. Really appreciates your works.
Please report these scams in India,here people are recently getting familiar to technology. Phones,laptops etc.Digitalised payment is a burden when people aren’t accustomed to the growth. I wish you get support from cyber crime reporting portal-Ministry of home affairs ,Government of India. Hope you keep up the good work and strive to help the people out there. God bless you
WHAT ON EARTH!!!😳 I am from India. Oh My Goodness!!! 😭 I am so ashamed that my country India is filled-up only with dens of thieves and robbers. OH MY GOODNESS!!! I can't believe what we Indian have sworn about loyalty, truthfulness and faithfulness are only just banners to show our people and to the world as well?? 😭😭 WAKE UP WITHOUT THESE BANNERS, MY WICKED INDIAN!!!!! 🤬🤬😭😭      SIGH!!! Well, thank you all so much for the good deeds you does for the better world. My full support is with you all. 😭😥😭  God bless. Amen.
Your just the best! Stay safe
You guys rock...
Dont skip ads.
Great job 👏👏👏 but one thing is that we really want to see the scammer women face..
Keep up the GREAT work!!!
I’m sure many people would like to team up with you and get back at all the countless BS phone calls that get past ATT’s so called, Call Protect app!
Thank you for doing this! 👏
I love that you used the glitter bomb
Have some MiniMe evil idea: Let the package say: "We just sprayed a poison into your face. You will d!e within two days. The only way out is to call this number. We will pick you up and give you a counterpoise, if... And just get the Police there and so on.
Damn. When you hear a countdown from a package and don´t react at all, you´re either Chuck Norris or completely dumb. Guess what she was.
there is another scam where they are pretending to be police and they need your information to issue a warrant. ive gotten several calls and when i said i would involve the actual police they stopped calling
Any scammers in boston hmu me and my guys with go there
Keep doing this forever
Hahahaha. She even took the Glitter Box with extra musk into her car... You lot do such a good job. I wish I could help you guys with baiting them. Sadly my computerskills are just too low.  Keep kicking their arses.
great....
Since I found you, I've been sharing all your videos.
A true American hero
Great team work with Mark🔥 You need a way to completely cover them in something disgusting and unremovable. Plus smartwater so the police can detect the coding on their skin for weeks to come.
I gotta go to the potty 🤣🤣😭🤣🤣
This is the 5th or 6th video of you that I watched. Firstly I didnt want to subscribe as I personally feel I am already subscribed to too many stuff. Watching this video made me subscribe. You're doing an absolutely amazing job and these scammers need to get payed for what they do. Looking forward to more video's
i love this bro subbed glad your helping people out! i got scammed a year and a half ago by these guys before all these videos came out.. but its all good i just keep blocking them now.
WELL DONE
What's with the blue hair man?
Pierogi ❤️❤️❤️
Nice blue hair there 👍🏼👍🏼🤩 , suits you sir suits you !  Keep up the good work 👍🏼👍🏼
These scammers need to be shot.
Men that use their intelligence to do good while entertaining us all. Hot!
This truly was the biggest scambait in Youtube history! I'm glad you were part of it and the only reason I have found you is from Mark Rober and Jim Browning. You all are doing amazing work to bring these scumbags to justice!
You should come to India to take on these scammers. Even we get scammed big time. These scammers seem to be a part of a multi national mafia, and the kingpin must be caught
1:20 isnt that a stock exchange?
May God bless you and jim and mark and all the scambusters out there. All of you are doing a great job. Salute to you all!!!
Pierogi, instead of a glitter bomb, why not a miniature manure spreader? As soon as they open package, they get covered in pig crap?
Okay listen! One time a scammer called me. I called him out on his game. After calling him out, he then decided to repeatedly call me and harass me. Let me tell you, he said some of the nastiest things I've ever heard in my life. He told me he had all my info and would come find me and do all these terrible things. He threatened to kill and r@$# me. I'm not going to lie, I was terrified.  Thank you so much for busting down om these people. It's disgusting what they do. Absolutely disgusting. Thank you for being so awesome.
Vivian's fake nails falling off and just laying on the table is a whole mood lol
“I have to go to the potty” lmao 🤣
Pierogi in the blue hair, gosh. Just when I thought this man couldn’t get any more attractive with all the good things he has done. He’s even hotter with the blue hair.
Thank you for this❤️
THANK YOU!
I like this guy's name: Pierogi.
It is an important but rather small victory, against just one money mule. Will the law enforcement take it seriously from now on? Will there be any international cooperation among police units across countries from now on? Are banks and gift card seller post any alert information to their customers?
I absolutely LOVE YOU for what you do.  Big respect!
U r the most awesome man ever!!
I just wanna say i love you and everything u do to stop those scammers
Can you send a glitter bomb to my ex girlfriend?  She stole my grandma's social security info and set up a joint credit card in her name.  When it arrived at my grandma's address, she immediately requested an address chance.  For which we received a notification with the address on the letter.  The police have been notified, but they said they might not be able to do anything because she hasn't spent any money.  It has been nearly a month with no contact back from law enforcement.  It's a shame that nothing can be done when she is clearly doing something wrong.
Damn is it coincidence that I got an ad of violence caution 😂😂😂.
My wife has received a voicemail in Australia from the "ATO" with a callback number. Will love you to see you go after them
Hero! Great job!
Being an Indian watching this video is making me happy and sad at the same time
Pierogi is the master of scammer in a good way to be honest tho. Lol.
You should have millions of subscribers!  SHARE!  SHARE!  SHARE!!!
Awesomeness 👌
Jesus is LORD
I'm thankful that I've never been scammed and it's sad that I have to be suspicious of every call I get, but I'm so thankful that there are people like you fighting for those who just don't know what these guys are doing. 💜💜💜💜💜
DAMN!!! Vivian...the original GILF...I'd hack that!....lol /jk
I love you AND Mark 😍😘😍😂🤣😂🤣
People who are hitting the thumbs down button are probably scammers
I wonder what would happen if you were happy that they put extra money in your account.  If someone just laughed at them and said too bad sucker!
Great video, great hair!
Genuine question, do US online banking services only require a username and a password?  In the UK all banks use two-step verification where you need to either use a mobile or other device to generate a code to logo on to you r online bank.
Actual real life super heros
A glittering example of good people working together for justice.
Hey there just wanted to let you know that i was a victum of Geek Squad Squad refund ive bought a McAfee antivirus software an they came back saying they own me a refund but showed me a fake bank account of how much they supposedly paid in. But i caught on an then thank you for your videos they are very educational.
Chinese,and Indinas ALWAYS.... shame
love n respect to you all  hope you all do team up  here is  a idea why not geo fence india to not being able to talk outside india  everytime after i speak to three network in india i always get a scam call 10 to 20 mins after proving either scammers are in the three networks system or they work both jobs i will bet if you find all three network call center in india you will find 70% of scammers very close by
My roommate got a call saying someone charged a phone on his Amazon account and they wanted him to log on to his account and he was freaking OUT.  I told him it was a scam. Told him to get off the phone immediately and they called back at least 20 times! Turns out obviously Amazon and the bank had no such transaction.
Thank you.
I shared this video with nearly 5k friends on Facebook and asked that they share. I've been looking for a good video to share that step by step explains what is happening for those new to hearing about these scams. Thank you for making it and the glitter bomb has got to be the best thing I've ever saw in my life, on so many levels! Thank you all!
🙏🙏🙏🤴🤴🤴
Good job 👍 keep up the good work 💪🇺🇸🙏❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I like telling them I'm actually in India and will be there in 10 minutes. Most don't buy it, but some start panicking. Pretty fun.
Thank you for all your help!  You are a real life super hero!
I can’t believe there are people like this getting away with these scams. What awful people.
Awesome work man...
714 butt hurt scammers disliking this upload
Man your an Angel . Your Doing really fantastic.  God bless you. Stay safe.
Hats off to you and your buddies for the amazing work in helping people. I feel sorry for all elderly people especially who lost money. Susan's video touched me.
Nice work lads... really satisfying to watch.
Would love🥰 to see more glitter bombs🤯 videos 🤘🏽💯
Need to get the bank ink dye explosion packs and add those to the box as well. Marks them nice and proper for police in case they manage to run.
I love messing with scammer calls. I've spoken only in German, asked if they like listening to goats, answered with "church of Cthulhu or Hitler" ect. I had one guy cuss me out (at least it sounded like it) because I dropped all pretenses and flat out told him his English was crap & I legit couldn't understand him (no joke, his accent was suuuuuuper thick). So much fun.
The people who disliked it are definitely scammers lmao
I love your blue hair!
Thank you sooo much guys for bringing awareness about these scammers. I strongly dislike them. They took money from my elderly neighbor.
ANYTIME you hear a voice with a FOREIGN accent i.e. India et al calling.... HANG UP!
I love this!!
oh this is absolutely amazing you guys have got to do this again do it as often as possible not only did I deserve it but it's hilarious
Just found your channel yesterday and now I’m binge watching.  You are providing an incredible public service.   If you ever want something translated, please let me know.   Happy to do it free of charge.   🇮🇳✊🏻❤️🙏🏽
Your the man bro dont stop getting these theving fukers... mad respect
someone needs to make documentary movie about this and about your work about this internet scamming,  you guys are true Robing Hood's of modern day !!!!!
This is amazing!
Love from India bro
You are a very good person!  God bless you and your talents!
These are the hero’s we need in today’s world
So glad you guys partnered up for this. Adds decades to my life watching these videos
Oh, scamming the scammers has got to be such FUN ass job. For real
Keep going after these criminals I have to say without hesitation you guys are awesome!!!
Pierogi, I just heard you say, maybe one day you would go to India. Just be very careful my friend. Every body is involved in the these scams, right from the bottom to the top. The only thing that should happen is when people are caught in the States scamming. They should be put in prison, where the hard core criminals are. What ever happens in prison. It is their bad luck. When their sentence is finished. They should be deported back at their expense. All their bank accounts should be frozen and their property sold to help the victims.
I was not expecting Perogi to crossdress as Vivian (cuz it wasn't in Mark's video) while drinking water. Nearly choked from surprise 🤣🤣🤣
Just want to run this by all the techy people in here, about tech support scams, whats the scope of something like this.  What if a service was implemented at OS level? The service would check if there are any active remote connections to the machine, being either via OS built-in or third part software.  The browser would then perform checks on that service, if the service is stopped, the browser can block all website sing-in pages.  This would ensure security even if the scammer gains remote access and stops the service.  Lastly the FINANCIAL institutions would perform secondary checks on the browser to verify if the service checks were successful. In the event the machine has any active remote connection then it can block all online banking access. OTHER websites wouldn’t have to perform this check to allow verified tech support and admins to do their actual job. In no way is this even close to a solution but Tech Giants have the means to tweak and fine tune the general idea.  And as I type this, I already see a flaw, third party/open source browsers. I guess financial institution can restrict online banking access to certified/verified browsers only.    Similar protocols can be implemented on phones as well.  I would say very few of the scammers actually have the in-depth knowledge of software and networking to be able manipulate or exploit something like this, so well over half would outright just be stopped in their scams but even if we say half or close to half, it would still be a win.  Technology has advanced a lot over the last decade and to see tech scam being a million-dollar industry just seems ridiculous. The companies out there that turn a blind eye to their software or services being utilized by scammers are either incompetent to fix their own software or just selfish enough to ride the free marketing train as hardworking YouTube scam baiters try educate the general population on tools used by those scammers.
This is what makes YouTube unique. This featurings, even better than Marvel Universe. YouTube Universe!
Wow this is a big collab! What nice days to be alive :)
Good job mate, you've given us more than we can ever ask for.
I'm not satisfied  Expose there Faces It Might seem heartless and you might not want there kids to grow up without parents but you should
This guy is like SAW but instead he uses a computer to torture scammers😂😂 I love these videos!
You are a great man!
MORE GLITTER BOMBS ! ! !     FOR THE WIN!
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
What? What happened? Somebody got glitter on their jeans? Pulled over by the police? And then what? Nothing? That’s it?
One thing I have found is that the the scammers will say that they are from all kinds of companies. One day they may say that they are from Microsoft, the next day they will say that they are from Amazon and most likely it will be the same person. One time I had a call from a guy that said he was from Microsoft and that I had a problem with my computer. The dead giveaway that this guy was a scammer is when he said he was from Microsoft. Microsoft won’t be calling people to fix computers. A few months later the same guy called again and said that he from some other company. I recognized the voice of the guy and told him he might as well give up calling me and that I know it’s a scam. I have an answering machine on my home phone (landline) and have stopped answering the phone. I let the answering machine take the call. What I have found is that robocalls and scammers will hang up when the answering machine kicks in. If it’s  important the person will leave a message.
They all sound the same, its insane, its like there is only one guy, india is like china, just in voices, they are all the same. heheheheh
700+ pissed off scammers disliked this..
keep that glitter bombing up. they deserve it.
That glittery scammer/mule biotch does not deserve anonymity.
Great work man! Keep it up.
hehe this is like my two super heros working in collaboration! what sweet revenge! hail glitter!!!
1129 it seems like Pierogi is channeling Andy from The Office.  LOL.    The Office used to be my favorite show.  This is now.
Love your work mate. Amazing content + great service to humanity. not all heroes wear capes.
You are a Saint ♥️♥️ keep up the fantastic work
If I could like this one million times I would! Thank you for doing what you do!
I'm only 5 mins into this vid and in shock at this man's singing skill
The perfect Collab
American accent failed miserably.
question. does steven have an associate in the us who then send the money to india-bank?
Love your videos! Bless you guys every day!!
I wonder if Micheal Winslow is interested in messing with scammers?
I watch Mark he's brilliant
You guys make me hope in humanity again. "Justice, Justice shall thou pursue!"
Speechless. Hopefuly gives you that boost so you know now it can actually happen. Justice can be served. Love from Australia
Your doing such an amazing job to help others. Scammers deserve no sympathy or forgiveness.
Thanks bro!!!!!
This dude does so much, ngl. I don’t even know how he doesn’t have 1M+ subs rn...but he’s close
And you really put on that dress and makeup, that's what I call dedication
I just wanna say thankyou for getting these people and making there life hard
More please! Way better than cat fish!
If you need me im in Florida bro we love you bro lol
God I wish that package was filled with crystal violet instead of glitter. We use crystal violet in the medical field and in biology to stain microorganisms. If it gets on skin or clothing it's impossible to get out. Crystal violet is also available for purchase without a license. *wink wink*
It's so bad, even Macauly Culkin can't take it.
You guys are heroes!!!  Thanks for everything you do.  I know you hear stories all the time but a friend of mine is a mgr at a food lion in here locally and she intercepted an older gentleman that was buying gift cards.  She saved the day <3 This incident happened recently like about a month ago.
Come to India for sure.. as you said And Man.. keep going.. I just love the great job you are doing.. keep busting these people !
The ultimate collaboration!
I understand getting scammed BUT 9:27 if you wrap money in foil and separate it into envelopes and then add random items ... I just can't sympathise with you, you actually deserved to lose that money 😂😂
Hope they all Rot in Hell , scumbags!!!
Dublo dublo dublo dot comb 😂
It's amazing how people just give over their money especially to a non-speaking English person That would be my first red flag right there and these people are so Unprofessional. People are either Stupid or just totally Gullible..
LOL @ 8:57
From India... Keep on doing this. These people are ruining our Image. Full support. ✌️
Well done dude.
I'm so glad your doing this, it made my day.  I hate how they target the elderly.  Great Job!!!!
How can I join the fight against scammers?
❤️ Respect!
Just stumble across the youtube on ur channel and ill say, id be so proud to be your mother if youre my son
❤️❤️❤️❤️You Are a Hero❤️❤️❤️❤️,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,those who did dislike this are scammer .
Your'e an inspiration! Thank you for all the great work ❤️👍🏼✨
Your'e an inspiration! Thank you for all the great work ❤️👍🏼✨
By the way.. there’s a new scams going on on Facebook
Good job We got your back!!
sir if you can read this,can I ask for your help.We got scammed but do not know the identity of the scammer,all we have is the bank account and a facebook account of the scammer.He/she scammed us 4 million pesos😭😭🙏🙏
I will beat asz
Thanks man
Anyone else get super confused during that Vivian bit??? Yea me neither...
New scam that might be happening. Got a voicemail yesterday from an American that never said his company name or who he was working for. But he said he was coming to my home or work unless I called some 800 number and rescheduled. He said he would be coming by tomorrow. I will let you know if he shows up but I doubt he does. The point of serving or bounty hunting is to show up unannounced. So why give a heads up?
Thank you for what you do! God bless you and your families!
Also, I wasn't aware some bank websites actually save the password. Mine won't, and I've told it to never. But when. I had clicked save before it still requires me to type it in.   Even if chrome saves the password for the bank though, all my accounts require me to click a button on my phone or put on a passcode from my phone. Bank websites shouldn't have the save password option available for them
Hey my wife's auntie got scammed out of a lot of money wonder if you can get them back? You're the man
Boo-hoo-hhhhoooooo!!
I have watched 4 videos in this channel, and I found out that the scammers are from India.  How is that possible?
Awesome.  Thank you for all you do and please keep up the great work.
This  man need a tv show 👏👏👏👏👏
hey let me know if you want to go after invention scammer s, i used to work for a patent company till it changed to a scam ..
Your video editing has gotten much better!  Great video.
I got a text sent to my phone a couple of weeks ago..someone from "Amazon" telling me I still had a credit amount to use up...hmmmm, and they addressed me as Elizabeth...which is not my name and I know darn well that Amazon isn't gonna take time to send random texts. Thankfully, there are people like you that educate and try to protect people's personal property. 🙏🏾❤
Thank you for being a good guy
What if instead of deleting the scammer's files you added new "customers," but those customers' names and addresses were government officials and offices — FBI, CIA, NSA, Treasury Department, and even local police in India?
You are a wonderful person and a fabulous team
I was scammed of £100 via a gift card by a guy on Instagram.  It wasn't much but I am still annoyed. He was hendrik g.....r who has over 400,000 subscribers on IG
More glitter bombs, please. Oh my God, that is awesome! You guys are fantastic; need more people like you on earth and less of the criminal POS.
The person opening the package is the mule. NOT the actual scammer. The mule gets paid to transport the package but they are required to open the package and check to make sure the contents are legit and everything is accounted for (making sure the mule doesn't steal the money) hence why the person had his iPhone on the bed recording.   I was expecting someone over seas opening up the glitter bomb but unfortunately it was just the mule. (they deserve it too but I'd rather see the actual scammers get this package instead)
US Baptist Back. LOLOL
A+
Keep up the good work your making a difference 👍
Well, I think if Mark Rober can get Macaulay Culkin on his YT channel, I think you need a celebrity to make an appearance on your YT channel too. LOL. I'm sure you will get a huge spike in viewers then. Or see if you can get on a Talk Show?
You should work for the FBI...  Makes me want to learn your hacking skills and do something like this also.
I ❤️ you xxxxxx
The saddest part about all this is you guys can do this from home. And if the government,cops, FBI,CIA,Homeland security gave a shit they could put a stop to it. They record everything and know this is happening and do nothing. Every call or computer connection comes through the same lines under the ocean to America. You think the don't intercept them ? They have over 20 years of recorded date. Every call text or message you have ever sent in any way and on any platform. They just can't be bothered. We need to start doing this to them and are government needs to start holding there government accountable to put a stop to this bullshit.
Yr awesome bro I wish u could show me how to work with a computer and maybe beable to get a job to earn money
Would love to see someone helping the Indian people from these type of scammers too.. awareness is way too low in India and people get scammed even more here. Wish I could learn your skills and help people.   World needs more people like you. Well done brother.  🙏

Do you offer services to individuals who may be a victim of hackers?
I worked for a grocery store, and we did Western Union transfers. It was company policy to get the store manager *and* WU's approval for checks that exceeded a certain amount. It annoyed quite a few customers, which okay, I get.  BUT. I'm pretty sure I was part of stopping three scams while I worked there because three different old people came in, asking to get checks for these exorbitant amounts, and they couldn't exactly explain why, just that they were contacted and told to do it as soon as possible. It was terrifying *for me* to be a part of on my end, so I couldn't imagine *them* being taken advantage of like that and ordered to withdraw or send off their life savings. We managed to convince all three of them that they might have been scammed and that they should not send those amounts to or take out those amounts for people they don't even know.  Having said all of that, I am so glad you, Mark, and Jim are working together to stop these scammers because they are preying on people, especially the elderly, and it's sick. Please keep it up!
Gold. I've been scammed by those £€¢^¢~€. God bless you, keep up the fight. I don't think the authorities in their countries would cooperate with you guys though. They're hopelessly corrupt.
You are all Amazing!
Thanks for doing this. I am FROM INDIA and I am ashamed that my country people are doing this to people around the globe. Atleast someone is doing the right thing. Believe these people are the best friends of the local police as they bribe them time and again and that's the reason they don't get caught. I wish I could help you in anyway but there is a huge risk getting in pothole with these criminals winning everytime. Good job for teaching these fckers their deserving lessons
Mark and Jim just sent me your way.  You, sir, are a superhero!  Freaking Batman!  Keep up this good work.
-puts Jim Browning in the description- -doesn't put him in the title-  Come on mate, put Jim in the title as well.
You three are the holy trinity against scammers.  If the government had any sense they would give you three your own agency and funding so that you could really take it to the next level.  ❤️
Longer nails look good on you!
Steven is doing good acting boss. You pulled an actor 😂 out of the scammer 😂😂
They need to get Lt. Lickme in on this, let him be the spokesperson
Stuff glitterbomb find the guys fricken family and send there heads to them ffs
Your my hero ! 😂
This just recently happened to my girlfriend's mom about a month ago. They robbed her blind and guilt-tripped her into believing and then and not talking about it to anyone else. I was so disappointed because I watch videos like this all the time and am very aware of the scams but that just goes to show you that older people that see the best in others just don't ever think people would lie to them, even in 2021. I won't say how much it was bit it was the equivalent of several regular people working checks 🤦🏾‍♂️
Good work man keep it up, I wish I could help
Did you say your name is Pierogi?
You sir are a G and thank you for your good work...  Shout out to you and all the good people fighting the good fight.  Woot Woot.
What if we all write to our local representatives to protect our elderly? Technology will just get more sophisticated and we should have a legal precedent to protect future generations
3:31 “dublu dublu dublu” lol not making fun of the accent but it’s funny to me
I don't get the end, I thought we gonna see the Indian in Texas opening it?
: )
This guy should be nominated for the Nobel Prize!
Absolutely AWESOME!!! Thanks for all you do to to inform and help people. Keep up the good work.
I’m dying at the singing hahahah! Omg love it lmao
the 684 thumbs down must be scammers hating on you
Come to India buddy.....there are many scammers here.
I swear when I'm retired I will completely ruin these guys.  Nothing like having a dream job.  Where you go after complete utter scum and you like doing it.
U three amigos are the best! Fight the fight !
👍👌👍👌👍👌👍👍 from Andorra , thank for yours Videos.
You freaking kickass. Thank you for what your doing.
Thank you Pierogi, Mark Rober and Jim Browning for all that you do!
^Why hiding her face
Love it when  the ScamBait Avengers Assemble!😎
It's funny how he has React App Icon over there and no Scammer ever notices that.
Just found your channel and subbed had my run in with these assholes every now and again thinking they're getting money from me
Great job! I saw Mark and Jim's videos regarding this incident and I've got to say that you guys are awesome and you're true heroes!
The most disturbing part about this entire video is seeing you dressed as a woman! I wish I could unsee that!!! 😂😂😂😂
❤️ from India
i do love to see scammers get what they desiver keep up the good work to stop pepole geting scamed, but i must amitte i love it when i get scammers calling me so i can waste thire time so i try and keep them on the phone to me as long as posibe and piss them off

😂😂😂😂😂
Keep this up!  , awesome videos , I had to block loads of daily calls to my parents house trying to scam them with Amazon prime and other scams.  Love from Great Britain!

No Bronx only Texas XD
680 dislikes from scammers 😂
You are amaaaazing. Cheers
It was a little difficult to tell, from Vivian's voice alone, how beautiful she is!  I don't think I realized how beautiful Vivian is!  And so telegenic, too!  I'm smitten! ;-D
YES YES YES This is the wholesome stuff I’m looking for. Get em.
🤣🤣🤣 Passt Malone
This is actually pretty genius man.  The glitter bomb could be used as an actual policing tool to find and arrest these people.  It wouldn't be baiting either since you aren't coercing them into commiting a crime.
Im subbed, looking forward to that visit to India ;) Lets see it!
Please go after the people that CONSTANTLY call about "my car's extended warranty"
love this!! we have to "allow" the scammers to have access to our pcs correct?  yep "any desk"  ps i love your gramma voice
I did not know you could speedrun taking down scammers.
Legends.
Gotta catchem all
We need to talk about you wearing  lip stick Mister !  J / K   Thanks to all you do along with all the helpers . Peace from Up North .
You do good work but all you did was get a carrier off the street . It didnt even slow down the scammers . There has to be more we can do to stop these crimes !
Good job man! Keep going. Society needs you.
Thank you💚💚
Wow, Vivian, for a 79 year old woman you make a mighty fine looking dude in drag, LOL!
how do you even keep composure during all this? lol
Brilliant work Mark & Jim..👌👌 It’s so nice to see these scumbags get what they deserve....Be megga if you went to India 🇮🇳....I think everyone would be watching....Thanks keep up the Megga work...AndyG from over here in uk🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Thank you
I thought all banks required multi factor authentication.
Hey guys .. I need some help from you guys ..How to contact you Guys.
Dislikers are scammers
Youre awesome man. Keep up the good work. With love from malaysia.
Love the blue hair! 😍
WAR ON THE SCAMMERS!!!
My mother is bedridden and hasn't been able to walk after recovering from COVID-19, and both my mom and stepfather are on permanent disability. My stepfather is hopelessly gullible, and recently fell for one of those FBI / payment in Google Play card balance scams. I am one more mistake on his part from suing for conservatorship.  Thank you guys for trying to help. 🤜🤛💙
I love your channel and you're quite a good looking fellow.  I just wanted to share that today I met someone named Vivian Rogers...
Thank you! thank you! For what you do all the work you put into this project is beyond words. I am 75 and was almost a victim. Thank the lord I talk to the police dept. first before I sent the money off.
You have blue hair.
You are becoming an idol for me bro i love you
Love the nails Vivian lol
We all need to learn how to do this. Take the piss out them all!
It's nice seeing the US taking an active role in this. If anything hopefully this will shut down the whole money mule thing for good. Excellent work you guys are doing here! Keep it up!!!
These scammers are a bunch of speds😂
ONLY death penalty every Friday live on TV will stop this.  And it will on top help us to fight climate change.
As, sweet, miss Parolee Glitterpants gets another few seconds of fame, or infamy, lol. Did her parole officer ever get notified?
Cool !!!
Awesome, thank you!
Congratulations is a great song
these scammers ruined the reputation of India. Like India is a great place (i am indian so i am biased) and then these scammers show up.
We love your show💕💕💕 keeo up your great wor🙏k
Sacrifice to the Algorithm Gods.- Also, EPIC JOB!
You haven't heard the last of Vivian H. Rogers!
We should make like social awareness gatherings to talk to older folks about this so that they don’t fall for this, it’s heartbreaking to see people lose their life savings.
You are a true Hero!
I've been enjoying your videos lately, not in any particular order, and have subbed.  You might have covered this already in an other video but ... your hair colour signals that you possibly have undergone the dreaded " swirly " , in a toilet bowl containing  " Ty- D-Bowl", " Toilet Duck" or some other dark blue toilet cleanser. Please contact your local emergency services or Poison Control Center to assure you have not accidentally overdosed or caused serious damage to yourself. 🙂😅😂🤣   Your work is greatly appreciated. I thank you and offer to you , my best wishes to you and yours for your continued success,  good health, prosperity and happiness!
This was the best one yet!!!! I love you for having such a beautiful soul!!!
Your all doing an Amazing job. Thank you so much for all you are doing. Much love XOXO. Carry on the good fight♡
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
My father in law was scammed out of $9,000 1 day before this video released. I wish we could go back in time and show him this before they called. They used all of the tricks in the book. He worked 15 years in a retirement job part time, and they took everything he had built up in those 15 years. It makes me so sad, and I hope this video saves people like him from being scammed out of their savings. He will never get that money back. Just devastating.
Thank you so much and keep up the great work 👍
Not  every superheroe wear a  cape !
This is NOT just a prank video. Same technique in stolen bank bags (blue paint). Good job dude, just found your channel.
MY NEW FAVORITE CHANNEL.
Gutes Video :)
This is the type of people the world needs, i hope u inspire other people to do the same
Real life superhero
Don't blur these guys face the should be revealed to public
I feel the SP guy is emotionally manipulating me
Yes you are right, this happend all days, this is crime and nowbody cares. But i will tell you some you should think about it.  As example, to sale/buy a fkin mobilefon for roundabout 1000$ what get manufactured/build for max 15-20$ in China is also crime and NOW ONE cares about it. All agree with this and similar crimes, and cant wait to pay for it. They all get also scammed but to stupid to understand it.  I realy enjoy your videos, yours and all the other hwo scam the scammers. And yes Glitterbombs should go around the world, all time all days like the scamming from old or naive people happends.  And sorry for my bad english, its not my nativ language.
They ought to get these mules with racketeering.
you looked like you liked dressing like a woman too much.
Love form India Thankyou so much for doing this ❤️❤️, All these scammers are ruining our country's image  and the work you are doing is really gonna help exposing these  scammers and getting rid of them , keep doing what you do the best , love and support from Indian community ❤️❤️
Didn't think I'd see Pierogi in drag, but I'm living for it.
WELL DONE YOU ARE AN A AMAZING PEORSON . KEEP UP THE hard work .
You rock that wig !
respect
Good job 👍
Thank you so much to giving the valuable information to protect all Americans.   Salute to your hard work.   I learn so much from your video.  Love it.
Next time it will shoot Monopoly money 🤣
You guys are the REAL Justice League! Thank-you, so much, for doing what you do!
It's a good thing i can't hack and trace things like this myself.
Awesome!! *Great Job!*
You are an awesome human being 💕 I love your videos ! Keep up the great work 👏🏼
The lassie with the glitter jeans. They looked so plain until she opened it and the glitter went over her. That sparkle of glitter perfectly on lines and everything actually make the jeans look a lot better. Look quite nice like that haha
This will not end until vigilantes start taking them out.
You guys need to open up a agency.
Mark, Jim and P, love you all guys for doing this. More Power and may the  Mighty Creator bless you.
Some heroes don’t wear capes.
Wow your glitter bomb devices have come a long way! Love the design.
Thank you so much for teaching the public about these horrific scammers! You are hero’s! Ten Thousand Blessings for your knowledge and kindness!!!
Well done you're a awesome person. ✌️🤘🇦🇺
Get Kitboga involved and The Dream Team will be complete.     You guys are superheroes !!  I can't even use my landline any more because the robo call density is so high.  But my phone number has been in our family since the 1960s and I'm not going to change it.  Eventually something has to be done about it at a national level.  In the meantime we have our own Scambusters  !!
👏 👏👏
Bravo! More power to you... Please keep up the good work...
670 dislikes are the scammers you messed with. Lol
why was it so funny when he started to cry HAHDHDJDJJD
Thank you for choosing to be a good person in a world filled with bad scammers.
That's crazy 😂 love it keep it up 👍🏾👍🏾
i just want to tell u guys id love to help u in any way bacause i was a victim my self and i just want to get them all.
Thank you for doing this! There is another scam, check Han Tony electric car scam.
Mad respect to all involved. God bless you
Vivian!! lol
😄😄😄 that was the best partnership ever!!
So was that girl who opened the glitter bomb in on the scam or another victim as well? I’m confused
Here's another legal roadblock: In some countries, the person doing what P and Jim Browning do so well has to be an actual policeman with full police training and maybe even a court order to do the trap phonecall and control the virtual computer that scammers are lured into attacking.   This is because lawmakers want to prevent PIs and vigilantes creating scams that entrap innocent citizens into incriminating themselves and others on trumped up charges like drug possession.   So the pretend victim baiting scammers or other criminals has to be someone the lawmakers trust not to scam ordinary citizens.  Such as the fraud division of the USPIS with technical assistance from DHS/CISA and/or NSA/TAO.
Keep going and shutting these bass turds (haha) down!
*"Ayy billnot cry..."* 😭😭😭
It’s a shame the real scammers weren’t really glitter bombed... only the mule. I think you need to do a trip to India.
Much respect!!! I get 10-30 calls a day... I can't imagine those that fall for it and their lives are ruined.
Next, do the American banks that prey on desperate people in hopes of collecting on inflated interest rates or ultimately taking their homes!
Big respect to you....thank you very much for this service
This is amazing! Thank you for continuing to get back at these low lifes.
I own a small computer business in country Australia and in the past few weeks scammer have taken over 20k from just 2 people i have dealth with, the only reason either one of these people knew they got scammed was because the bank frozen their accounts.

Thank you so much for all your hard work and perseverance!
You are the man for helping us, keep on brother
I have been a victim and lost about $1300.00 and could not recover it.
Respect
dislikes are from scammers HAHAHA
There are a LOT of these scammers around... 668 of them have even watched this video  😏
All the people that don't like this are probably the scammers lol
You should do the scammers that like to call and hang up and the ones who use text, I'm starting to get the ones who use text alot, I just block them since I don't know the number but they end up just using a different number.

Epic
I'm not sure which is sadder... people are loosing money from accounts with 50,000 dollars in it when I'm lucky to have 5 dollars in my own.
i wonder what would happen if they dont give back their  fake money
So I'm assuming that the mule has to know the scammers address in India.. If the mule is sent to pick up a package & take a certain amount of money out & Then send it to India to the person who is in charge of the whole scam.. I wonder if there's any way you guys can find a mule that is willing to cooperate or maybe get someone to go undercover to become a fake mule so you guys can get an address to where the package is being sent in India & then you guys can give it to the authorities & they can contact the india government & bust these scammers. Do you know what I mean? I think that would be great.
I love you Mark...and your
hey brother , is it possible when you delete their contact files you can upload a similar looking contact file with the local police phone numbers instead ?  lol  and i want to make a one time donation . how do i go about that ?  thanks bro
Thanks for doing what you do to help people from nasty scammers

My father lost $400K to scammers.  In one scam, he had high end purses, shoes, and cash sent to a convention center in TX.  I contacted the convention center who refused to investigate and then called the local police who said they didnt have any manpower to put on this.  No one wants to help, glad you are out there trying to educate people.
simply an awesome.
Why are there thumbs down?  I assume you are the scammers.....😒😒😒
Damn Vivian is a GILF
Unfortunately you haven’t released a new video on here since you hit 1mil views on your video. Your not staying current. 5 seconds on Instagram isn’t gonna keep them coming back and with no new content. Nobody is telling their friends about you. Anyway you decided you made enough money and are quitting?
Loved it wow 🤩
"I'm going to lose my job!" ... Good.
Your hair dye is showing.... :)
With Vivienne you should pretend that when you realised you had access to their computer you spring cleaned out the files to make it run faster. Your grandson showed you how to with yours and now it's double the speed! So you passed on the favour. See how angry they get when they think this sweet old lady who's tried to help them has in-fact destroyed their scamming career.
Show us glitterbomb aftermath
8:50 and the Oscar goes too....
I get these calls all the time. Each time I hear “Alex” with the heavy Indian accent I just laugh and hang up.
My mom was victimized recently for $9999.99 3 separate times.  My dad had just passed away a couple weeks before this happened and she was very raw emotionally.  She was 86 at the time. The scammer cried and then bullied her.  Sadly, like so many other kind people, she bit!  She went to the bank where she has been a customer for more than 25 years and nobody at that bank questioned her at all!!! They gave her cashiers checks each time and then my mom mailed the checks to someone in Texas.  I feel the banks need to turn up their awareness and alarms, especially when it is older folks!  Ultimately, the bank took the hit but only after they were threatened with lawsuits. Thank you for what you are doing to stop these scammers!  It would be great if you offered training on how to wreck these people.  I know I would be first in line to sign up for a class like this!
Amazing man
LibidiotTube keeps deleting my comments!
You guys are the real MVPs. So proud of y'all ♥️
These guys are currently targetting my small outback Queensland (Australia) community and tried to scam a few small businesses. Luckily, the people here are smarter than the scammers think. It would be great to do something like this to the mules in Australia too. They're slippery buggers.
You are an absolute legend and I can’t imagine the satisfaction this brings but also the fire it gives your drive to do more, I hope you do get to go to India someday to show em who’s their daddy 😜
Hey man. I want to help you guys. I really admire what you do and want to help in anyway I can. How can we make this happen ? I want in. Thank you for all that you do.
You should try the blue dye banks use also😅 , that was EPIC👍👍👍👍👍👍
At the end there will be just ONE scammer that will take it all. Wanna know her name??

Your Correct the Goverment needs to get involved and stopped this,  Im sure we do defense sales and deals with India we can stop unless they stop these scammer or give our country more access to who they are such as company information from their IPs.
John gets off the phone after that grammy award winning act, his coworkers are clapping and laughing. Probably get bonuses for who can scam most or a percentage of each one
Love it ,seeing justuce.
the dislike number... IS JUST CURSED
Have you scam them out of money. or can you. I love when you delete there files keep up the good work
LMFAOOOO I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THE VIVIAN ROGERS CAMEO IN PERSON  Girl, you gawjus. That leopard though.... lil minx.
I came here because mark said to check you out
the police should reward this man with money
OH PURR
A scammer stole all of my grandma’s money. Every last cent of her hard earned money. Thank you for doing this!
My favorite thing to do is answer in my best Liam Neeson voice with "code word is sparrow, how do you reply" usually they ask "what?" "This is a private government number, code word is sparrow, how do you reply?!" "how do you reply!!!" "Agents are being dispatched to your location, how do you reply!!!" They always hang up.
ok, steph curry, im sure that's not the first time you've been called that.
You and other scambaiters are doing amazing work. It isn't just the people being scammed or may be scammed in future you are saving. Goodness knows what some of the proceeds of these crimes are funding.
Nice going guys. Ever contact one of the cable companies to make this into a Show or just a PSA short?
Thanks for putting these videos out.  My dad is 73 yo and his wallet was stolen in Jan... it had his ss card in it.  Scammers started calling him and 3 months later they drained $400k from his life insurance before we found out.  Your videos helped convince him it was a scam bcuz they used same story. They’re still calling and texting him.  We are not sure what to do next?  Who to contact?  Any advice?
Those 666 dislikes.... are the devils that are the scammers...
it's amazing how can people fall into this scam i swear...
You are a brilliant human being. Thank you and keep on protecting those venerable folk. They need you!
You're an absolute hero of the premium kind. Keep up the great fight!
i am the 4900  one to comment
You Sir Earned My Respect...
My son almost got scammed out of AU$327.20 by a scam through his Steam account, it's only because I have been binge watching your scammer videos that I was able (through my brain fogged head) pick up that is was indeed a scam! He didn't lose the money, but we are currently in the process of regaining control of his Steam account... Scammers make me so angry!
Please can someone help me get payback on someone who scammed my mum out of $3,500AUD!  We have his real full name, police didn't do anything and closed the case but are releasing the files on him to me! We don't have much money and that was the last of her super they took. We are not in a good place financially and if we could recover the money it would be amazing for our family and my medical bills! Please, if anyone can help it would be forever appreciated!
My grandparents have gotten 2 scam calls within the last year pretending to be me asking for money to get out of jail. I’m thankful that they’ve called me immediately afterwards to double check. I’m glad you guys do this to all these scammers. Love watching you and kitboga.
Haha it’s funny but seriously awesome to see you work to stop interrupt block destroy these criminals horrible scams that hurt decent people someone has to fight the good fights while many don’t do anything to help the weak
Is it possible to set your virtual machine up so that they can't add the two extra zeros on the fake refund form? I want to see what happens.
I am a HUGE fan!!
This does it in until we send a glitter bomb to the scammers in India, who is with me!!!!!!!!
Honestly you looked a little cute at 9:35
Lmao the Post Malone reference was great 😂
660 scammers didn't like this video
I love messing with scammers, I always answer with a hindu accent and my name is either Hardip or Jigar. Ill lead them on for five minutes, then they start cussing at me.
I love Mark Rober He is the BEST!
<3
Sometimes i'm happy with my language that is to hard for almost everyone and i can smell fake messages from kilometers (polish btw)

And the Hindi scammer for crying goes: Steven
I was just watching your video and someone was trying to scam me with Facebook saying that my account was unacceptable and I needed to go to the store and get two Google play cards for $50 dollars each so that I could get my account back.

The only thumbs down are from scammers lol
Sooo this channel should be called scamming scammers???
try to contact  with indian cyber police to take these scammers down
Keep up working with this group of people. You will do great things!
the glitter on her when the police came lmfao!
God, if only the feds would have the enthusiasm for no knocking these scammers as they do with a certain agency.
Best way to get rid of scammers is to say “can I put you on hold while I put you through to our IT department”. Sometimes I sing “on hold” music to them.
if youre trying to show old people what a scam is maybe don't show someone with dyed blue hair amiright?
Why is every scammer from India, not to be racist
ITS TIME.......Guys .....build a program that people can use immediatly when being scammed.......ie on the laptop or pc free download and membership then when scam gets halted thankful person spends 20 bucks!!!!!    HOPE YOU READ THIS
Damn I wish the scammer’s face wasn’t blurred out lol
👏👏👏👏👏👏
Challenge: connect to scammer and run Restore To Factory Settings.... completely wipe their computer.
So great that you are explaining exactly what you are doing and what's happening. This is a great video to show older people. Thank you very much for what you do 👏👏👏👏
omg jim browning too
Just saying you should learn to pronounce indian names it would be more fun that way
Rather then fart spray and glitter use C-4
Yo could use you help.
You are incredible.

Modern day superhero, Thank you and most of all thank your parents for doing such an amazing job.
I'm from New Zealand, and my grandmother constantly gets Indian phone scammers calling her landline, telling her that something's wrong with her internet connection, when she doesn't even have the fucking internet lol, and we're getting really sick of it! There appears to be nothing we can do about it, even the phone company don't seem to be able to do anything, it's really becoming a problem and we don't know what to do!!
As a person who has been scammed before I really hope you continue, these people are one of the reasons I have trust issues
So satisfying.
That's some terrible acting from the scammer.  Like, Razzie-worthy terrible.
Got the Microsoft scammer a few months ago; told him if he ever called me again I'd call the police and have him arrested -- he couldn't hang up fast enough.  Make me smile when I think about it; I had no idea where he was calling from or who he was; he just pissed me off.
You’re the man! Way to make a difference!
I'm so glad you got the actual police involved! I really hope this guy and all the other scammers get punished for stealing like this, real jailtime is needed to show stealing from behind a computer screen doesn't keep you safe! Great video keep up the good work man!
I saw Mark's video when he uploaded it, and for the next week or so I watch a ton of your videos.
Love these. Get these filthy rats. Thank you for being a good person, and helping people
We love a scammer busting trio!  Singularly you each do so much good and together - scammers don't have a chance!
4:17 what is that hair color? I fkn love it!
Every person who disliked is a scammers toilet paper. And if your a scammer I hope that toilet paper rips your arse apart.
Just got a call about credit cards. I asked them if they were giving away free credit cards, they asked me if I was a YouTuber then hung up on me lol

This is just awesome.  I wish i.could do this kind of work.
How enriched we are -_- 3rd world filth.
vivian giving me nightmares at night
dude...just had a polish girl ask me for help....scammed.....i had so much fun torturing the guy's soul with vulgar insults about his caste and his mother
How come I can't view any of the streams from YouTube or twitch?  Are they not available after the stream is over?
Hey everyone, I am hoping for some good luck here. I just got scammed on a craigslist ad (they gave me a Voip number and transferred money over PayPal with the email address they gave me)  anyone have any idea how I can track them down at all? Times are tough and this has me in a tough spot.  Appreciate the help!
*the collaboration tho! that's op hahahaha*
The voice lol😂😂😂
Where’s some new content
Ever think of doing other types of scams?  I fell victim to a health insurance one and it'd be nice to see how that sort of things work (to this day I'm still terrified and don't have health insurance because I'm always afraid it's a scam)
Pierogi, thank you SO much for what you do. These videos are really helpful in making more people aware of these scams & also aware of the methods they’re using to attempt to steal your money, including any new methods. Some people just don’t realize that our older generations didn’t grow up with technology, not even the internet. It’s much easier for them to be scammed because they just don’t know any better. Us younger generations have grown up with technology, the internet & are more aware of all the different types of scams they try to pull. Us younger generations have a duty to make sure we’re teaching/informing our elders, our Grandparents & even our Parents about these things, so they don’t lose their retirement money, savings & everything they’ve worked so hard for. Every time I see a video of these people thinking that they’re talking to & stealing from an ELDERLY person, I get SO pissed off (and sad to) I wish there was something that could be done about these lowlife pieces of 💩 But anyway, thank you so much for spreading awareness on this issue. I really hope your viewers talk to their older Parents & Grandparents to make sure they know what to do & what not to do, to avoid losing what they’ve worked so hard for. After binge watching you & Kitboga, I made sure to talk to my older relatives so they wouldn’t be the next victim to these shitheads.
Keep up your unique work bringing authorities in on these scammers and stay safe!
<3 <3 <3 <3 <3 Thank you for being amazing
I want to thank you for doing this years ago I work 911 and people were getting stuff done to them constantly and in the years I did it nobody was as protective of the people and even GPS couldn’t get you very close to a location I’m talking the early 2000s. So again thank you for all the hard work you do and that includes everybody in your group thank you again.
You guys are just fantastic! Thank you for helping so many.
The last scammer who called me, about six years ago, said that he was from MicroSoft and that there was a problem with my computer.  I thanked him for his call and said that, since my son works for MS, I would ask him about the possible issue.  I said that my son was a software development engineer II(which he truly was at the time).  The scammer then tried to tell me that he was an SDE I and was a higher level.  He then realized his mistake and abruptly hung up.  My mom, who was over 80 at the time, on occasion would receive scammer calls from men stating that they were her grandson needing money.  My mom was sharp as a tack and knew that it was a scam, and she would lead the scammer on a merry chase, until she became tired of it and then she  would hang up.
I want to help.  Been trying to reach you!
Keep it up we love you guys get them all.
Hey, I've just come across your channel recently and I think what you do is amazing! It really is incredible work and so gratifying to hear these creatures get lit up and squirm when they realise what has happened to them. This is super hero stuff 🙏
Mark, Jim,  and Scammer Payback... Lord have mercy on these scammers' souls 😂😂😂
Singing post Malone as on old lady 🤣
Its been a week 🥺 been looking for a new video everyday , hope everything's okay perogi?
I shared this on Facebook.  I wish I could do what you do.  I am a programmer but I have no idea how to hack back into scammers.  I wish I did.  I hate these people.

Payback
Someone is trying to scam me can you help?
Some scammers tried to scam my grandmother a few years back. I had seen a few Jim Browning videos and decided to setup a VDI and had some fun with them. Being a network engineer I knew how to mess with them and not let them have any of my personal info. I was able to RAT their machine without having to transfer it myself lol Made a folder labeled "Wifes modeling shoot" on the desktop.  The scammer asked me to open the folder to "check for viruses".  I told him know they were pics of my wife nude. (The pics were random mildly nude pics from online) He didn't realize I had inject a payload into the images.  He got frustrated that I wouldn't open the images, so he transferred the images to his PC and as soon as he opened one, my Linux box got a new RAT connection lol  Seeing these makes me what to do more of these and maybe record them this time.
You should do like a master class on how to do what you do. Get more people engaged with these scammers so it makes it less viable for them to con people.
Silly question - surely a lot of these scams would be stopped if the ‘inspect element’ function was disabled on all browsers, being only available to developers, so that scammers could not edit the HTML?
Good stuff bro.
Keep up the awesome work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THEY SAY IF IM ON MY PC RIGHT NOW COZ IM HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE INTERENET  WHAT I KNOW THEY SOUND LIKE FROM INDIA  FUNNY ENOUGH THEY USE SOMEHOW THE AUSTRALIA CODE TO CALL US
THAT KINDA OT CALLS HAPPENS TO ME ALMOST EVERYDAY MATE HERE IN AUSTRALIA WE ARE THEIR TARGET BUT NO ONE DOING ANYTHING ABOUT THIS SCAMMERS
All scambaiters , whether on yt or at home under the radar, should calibrate and focus on one or a few scam centers just keep calling them to be a nuisance   (after scambaiting them) for a certain amount of time. They aren't  going to want to continue changing their phone numbers (or computers) multiple times. That's a profit loss (that's a positive for everyone who hates evil doers).  I'm thinking months possibly . That's my dream.   Anyone who keeps a scammer on the phone no matter how little or long is doing really good and are really humble HEROES & ANGELS.
well the americans fell for it so hats funny XD
Thank you for making these videos and bringing awareness to so many people. And damn what hair colour is that? Which shade of Blue is it?
that crying was so fake lmao
Trie tetha plataform is more nice than twitch
I absolutely love the glitter bomb and when you delete the files and documents!!! So awesome!!!
What about offering disruptor classes and even better, there's a possible way is using this method when battling human trafficking.
Never stop, even one victim saved or one scumbag caught is worth all your efforts, all the respect to you and your team 👍😇
Amazing brother!!!
Have you seen the video's of scambaiter? He has more names, adresses and files👍
Hi. Please help me, I am from Philippines, just a few hours ago I got scammed. That money is for my tuition fee, I really need it. Please help me I am just a student. PLeaseeeee
Well done yet again Say hi to that foxy father you have...he's nice eye candy for our generation. Meanwhile, did you dye your hair black? Looks like it. Keep up the great work. Thanks so much. I'm a big fan. Bring back Arthur Rogers when you can.
Wonderful! And the blue hair is awesome! You, Sir, are a blue-haired saint!
that was the fakest cryiing i have ever heard.
--> All the GOOD karma this episode generated was enough to make me forget about the METRO-SEXUAL curve that sneaked under the radar. (gay-dar) LOL.. It was funny! And a little disturbing. But I'll get over it! You know what? After a good haul like this, it's like coming home from combat and everyone thanking you for your service. Not one shot was fired. But its going to have a knock-out blow that will be felt by all those filthy animals. They give a moments pause before doing it again! Tony Stark asked... "is it better to be respected or feared? Why not have both? That's how Dad did it. That's how America does it"    Go Get 'em dude!
Why is her face blurred?
BRO HATS OFF TO YOU
tHANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU GUYS DOING. iM CRYING RIGHT NOW AND SUPPORTING YOUR CHANNEL.. PLEASE DONT STOP HELPING THIS WORLD
You should find out how debit cards are getting hacked and how to prevent it. The videos are so old and there has to be a  new way they are getting information, I have had my card hacked twice in the last 45 days. I have a RFID blocking wallet, block pin if needed and use the heat of my hand to heat up all the numbers on a key pad, use paypal when ever possible for online shopping, dont pay at the pump or use ATM, use google pay and only shop at trusted websites. But some how some one got my card info that is a few weeks old and ordered food from Ubereats.
amazing You guys are anamazing
Too bad the scammer didn't get arrested (or you would have shown that I assume), and the face it blurred.
I'm glad we're seeing trolling that's actually helping people lol.         We do a little bit of trolling, we do a little bit of trolling!
damn the graphics made the scammers seem like they're some ultra sophisticated scary hackers when in reality they're a bunch of clowns that would struggle to open up microsoft word
That chick was here in Houston!! I wanna be involved in your cause!!!!
Lol them scammers bosses put the fear in them for real!! Boss scammer: Like get my money I scammed it I'll kill you!! 😆😆🤣😂😂🤣🤣😆😂🤣 Scammers are funny!
I wish scammers did this to me!! I'd keep the money!!
mr president should give u some protection..coz u such a good person..try to recruit more person with a good heart in it like u
Kudos to you, dude. You're a good man for doing this. Shame she had to go that way, but people don't deserve to have their money stolen right from underneath them. Thank you for doing what you do, friend.
what happened at the very end? Did the police show up? Or was the person dumb enough to go to the police? Any follow up to this?
There's so many scams on the internet today, and so many of them are easy to fall for. Send me $25 and I'll tell you all about it.
Which U.S. state is famous for its extra-small soft drinks?    Mini-soda!
Omg this is so wonderful. World needs tons of ppl like you! Thanks for all you do for protecting people and make those scammers pay for what they did to the people. And of course thanks for let people know that they have to pay a lot of attention on these things. ♥
Lol, very sad but also funny.  HOWEVER, I think Vivian needs a little *shih tzu dawgy* to keep interrupting her.  That would be fun lol.
Get'em pierogie keep fighting and keep messing with them!
Many of your vids you have gained access to the files of scammers and downloaded/deleted them.   I'm not sure how wide your support group is and if you have any programmers/hackers amoungst them but have you considered infecting THEIR machines with your own custom "malware" designed to track who they deal with and who they are scamming?  Perhaps even your own remote desktop app so you can continue to download victim lists?  Although if you have already taken this route I'm assuming you wouldn't want to advertise it...
Its like Saw but with tech. Lets play a game, a scammer smashing game
You are amazing. Keep doing what you’re doing, you’re making the world a little better and safer for (vulnerable) people. My father was scammed and I love watching you reel them in. 💙
The were never friendly... rollin in a Bentley....  Ay
The dislikes are the scammers
Scammers use just about any social media to scam. I was playing scrabble through the app and found a woman posing as Keanu Reeves. Looked up scams using actors and found hundreds!!! First red flag was she said you know who this is? Then there were other clues. Yup, she asked i send her money for 'his' charity to Canada.
Nice work. No really, really, really nice work. The glitter on the jeans followed by a shrug of the shoulders = priceless.
Professionals would not use some of the words the scammers use. After calling one guy out he starts mocking me, pretending to be scared I'll report him. Course I was bluffing for he knows I won't. What stood out to me was how unprofessional he sounded which is a dead give away he's a scammer. Didn't even try to pretend anymore. I'm gonna have me some fun next time!! 😂😂
You are totally awesome!!!
You are a Hero.  I wish all good things for you Mark Rober, and also Jim Browning.  Bravo, you are real warriors of goodness.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
This channel is awesome I will definitely share👍💪❤️
Here in the UK, they try anything like this as well. Lately, I got a call from "HMRC" the auto message claimed and said that my National Insurance was compromised and that I was due for legal action if I did not speak to them. So I got through to them, talked to a gentleman who called himself Shaun, but he was Indian voiced. Got to the part where he asked for my details and right away I said "Nah, i'm not going to give you any details because I know this is a scam". His reply was "FUCK YOU!" then hung up the phone. Since then, I have not received a single phone call. They must of listed me as "He knows" so that they never call me again lol. Problem is, you got to ask yourself, how do the scammers get your phone number in the first place and the answer is dead simple... Other websites that have been hacked and data has been stolen. These websites / services that fail to uphold your information as private is the start of these scam callers. The scam callers just buy the information from the people who have hacked the websites. I think we need to just stop using online services or hold them accountable for not protecting our data properly.
The heroes we need...
That’s gotta be a Mark Rober glitter bomb😊
trash video, didn't contain anything besides duplicated recordings from Mark and Jim.
We need more people like you in this world!
Vivian Rodgers is a bad ass b!tch and deserves more recognition for her selfless acts. She's an absolute queen.
I’m sorry to tell you, but you make a better young woman than you do a young man. Love you Vivian.
I cannot believe 631 people didn't like this... :/ What you guys are doing is better than the current administration.
We 🙏 thank you for protecting us against scammers
Love what you do
😂😂😂🙌👌
I would definitely pay to watch this.... 👌
If I can help let me know.i like you are going after these scammers.i would like to help
You have my full support bro
I genuinely think that the 600 dislikes on this video were an accident. For one, it’s happened to me where I noticed that I had accidentally touched dislike on a YouTuber that I love and watch every day. And two, I refuse to believe that over 600 people could possibly dislike this video!!! How?!? It’s nothing but good guys doing an amazing things, helping people, and being grateful for all the love and support they receive to motivate them to keep on doing it. What’s not to love?
Want to help.let me know what I can do to help
i have a couple ideas for videos you could do. Basically the one day I was trying to remove like a login popup from a website so i could read a news article or something. SO i edited the html and deleted it and then it produced a new one instantly with javascript. So my video ideas are 1) create a bank webpage where if they edit the amounts the javascript puts them back to normal again automatically to see how they react. and 2) create a bank account that when they try to go on it it covers the browser in their own scam popups so they cant do anything.
When they call me I tell them my credit card is in  my office and it will take me a few minutes to get it, they say they will wait,  suckers!, then i place the phone down and make a cup of coffee and a sandwich, after about 20 minutes i see if they are still there?, nope!.
you preseed extra 2 zeros thats
Thank you!
Scammer ka computer format kar do                Aka format the scammer's computer
you inspired me to keep the scammers on the phone for 90 min and then had him texting me back and forth. By the end of the call he cussed me out 😂
Thank you guys for doing this.  I hope you can put such a dent into their bottom line, put most of them in jail, and grind this kind of scam to a halt.   Our government doesn't seem to be interested in stopping this from happening, makes one wonder why.
8:27 best drama lol
You look too good as a woman.  I don't want to ever see that again.  Keep up the good work you are awesome.

Now  I'm getting the blue screen of death  I cant use the computer at all  . This f###### sucks .
This video is a week old at time of this comment but I would just like to say if I worked at a store selling gift cards I would ask anyone I see buying multiple gift cards if they got a call about their computer or a tax refund problem or something of that nature. These people need to be stopped!! Thanks for all you do
You should upload something that infects and shuts down their whole call center networks
Give yourself some credit too Pierogi and Co, with your expertise none of this would happen. Keep up the good work :)
Lipstick actually looks pretty good on you!!
My mum once got a cal from a scammer and they said that if they didn’t get 15000£ then police will show up  My mum said she didn’t speak English and they hung up 😂
Yo there is this scammer called lil taxer on tiktok and Ig, do something about that guy. Luckily I am not dumb enough to fall for this crap but he has definitely tricked others and it needs to be stopped
This would be so much fun to learn how to do! need more people doing this
Why is the thieves face blurred out?? Are these videos real?? I find it hard to believe when you blur the thieves out!! Why not expose them?
600+ Scammers dislike this video
I wish you would put in what they are saying in the background across the screen like cc.
what is the point of filming it when no one gets shown on cam? i dont believe you got anyone arrested. i think this is a scam to get ppl to support you. you are no better than the scammer you "allegedly" took down. but how can anyone qualify this? no names of faces were ACTUALLY shown and i bet they werent REALLY arrested.
oh...so you cover their face.... you must be on their side. be this will stop and shame nno one...
The fact that you don't have millions of subs is absolutely insane. Keep up the good work.
Thank you for doing your part to take down some of these operations.  I would love to do something like this.  Actually, my daughter and I are thinking of starting a nonprofit to work with senior centers and possibly churches  (anywhere we can find seniors ) to keep them aware of the most recent scams concerning seniors.  You have been an inspiration.
Thank you for your service!
i LOVE  LOVE the Glitter Bombs!!    ;-)     Are you Live Tonight??
Your better then the FBI .  False bad intel  is what it really means !
U sound familiar idk why
I got scammed 2 days ago lucky enough my bank stopped this, been watching some of your videos absolutely brilliant the work you do and i will be on high alert next time i get a phone call but at least after watching these videos i know what to look out for .thanks
Very awesome, thanks for what you do!
good work lads! keep it up and thanks for sharing this information to the whole world. these scamming scumbags deserve far worse than a glitterbomb but the work you are doing will help so many people avoid being scammed. congrats. peace and love.
wow the cancellation department....sounds important and totally legit steven 😂
Where are you no new videos
vivian kinda cute wit it
that added garbage footage tho. Flashing beeping error signs, ugh, get to the point, this turns off
What if you pretended to have autism to see how low the scammers will go
Alex Goldmann went to india i guess you know about the reply all podcast
The yummy kenneth synchronously melt because story cephalometrically waste an a equal kilometer. insidious, economic chick
Are all scammers from India?
Keep up the awesome work!God bless!
Thank you, for fighting these assholes.
Ur a good man  :)
The lipstick in the Vivian segment really looked good! That's the least important part of this, but it really does
Why does every scammer have a really heavy accent
You didnt get the scammers you only got one of the people they use to get the package sent to....they take their cut and send the rest on to the real scammers.....plenty of other people needing money that they can use if they get caught
Top job fellas!!! Amazing work!!
This happens when indians parents force their kids to study only one subject..and when they graduate they don't have a job
They've called my elderly dad &on several occasions he's come to my house crying bc they've upset him so much (I have to handle most of his finances to ensure his bills are paid)  so they can't get banking info w/o convincing me, also. I was shocked w/how bold (&ridiculous) their lies &aggressiveness was. (Ya, SURE you're the head of the fbi &that's _actually_ your badge number. How kind to want to ship me drug $ that was laundered in my dad's bank accnt in Mexico🙄) Luckily, my bestfriend is a state attorney &got it dealt with, but he STILL gets calls almost daily from other scammers, bc they now know he's on social security, retired, &has dementia. These ppl are cockroaches that need to be stomped out, so thank u for doing your part, guys!!
I'm really sorry. These people should die. I'm from India and I'm very sorry to all of you.
Great job you guys are doing. Keep up the good work
This is awesome it would be so cool to set up dedicated paid teams from the government to handle strictly scams like these.
"Good work, Vivian. We love you" @ 10:23 will now be my text tone so I can at least hear someone tell me good work lol
Thank you I believe your project should be supported by the government I think they should give you a grant
🤣 Learn how the flaps on your box work Vivianne! No pun intended.
FUCK THE SCAMMERS ! ♥
Hahahahahahahha crying lol
You and Mark and Jim are having too much fun!  I hope the scammers are having plenty of the opposite of fun.
Great Job catch humm
"This is unbecoming of you!!! I didn't raise you this way!!"🤣😂🤣😂🤣 Absolutely hilarious!
5:12 I love how the favicon is still the default React Icon
Idea to raise money for helping victims:  1. Buy the Glitter Jeans Of Shame. 2. Auction them.  3. Let subscribers vote on who to help and send $ to scam victims.   Love your show!!
We want more Vivian
I think what upset me the most is when Pierogi quoted "Oh where's the crime?" and yeah, it's right there!  Where I live in PA, we have people saying they are working for PECO and that they can save money on our power.  So my dad calls PECO and asks, and even though PECO knows about it, they say they can't do anything about it!  OMFG!  So all these people are being scammed .... and it sickens me
the dislikes are the scammers xD
FANTASTIC WORK BROTHER. GET THEM ALL SHUT DOWN. You are a fu©king HERO 🤘🤘 This happened to my Grandpa once, he was 85 years old, Thank God he still had his wits about him and didn't get money stolen from him, but he eventually had to change his phone number because they kept calling and calling and calling they threatened his life they called him all sorts of ugly names. So, this is kind of a personal thing for me I  totally appreciate what you were doing. You are helping those who are getting scammed by these bottom feeding scumbags. I can't say thank you enough I cannot ever show you the appreciation I have for what you were doing. FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART THANK YOU AND CONTINUE THE FIGHT AGAINST THESE BASTARDS ❤️❤️
Good Job!
My dad has been getting calls about him having Criminal Activity 🤣. He’s nearly picked up and said we’ve got the house surrounded, OPEN FIRE. (He’s in the military)
Fuckin A man... way to stick it to em!
I am from 🇿🇦 and experienced the same type of call, but for a trading company, they kept my husband (who is not tech savvy) on the line for about 2 hours. They want him to open a trading account and put money in, needless to say he didn't get anywhere with my husband who accidently disabled the Wi-Fi early in the call, so he handed the phone to me. This guy was relentless, using the same tactics as in the video even sounded similar and they don't want you to put the phone off.  I suspected fraud so I tagged along for a while, he got angry and frustrated, screaming at me so I switched the phone off. We didn't take any international calls again. I discovered this channel yesterday and I am hooked. I love this channel, empower people with knowledge, awesome keep up the good work!
616 scammers gave this a thumbs down.... awww
You guys should offer this asap service.  If you had, my dad would not experience this.  He has gone through this at leat 4X, maybe more.
Thank you for the things you do to protect us. I am a 72 year old man with no computer skills and knowing that someone with skills is fighting for me and my wife is very comforting. I have been scammed and it happened just like you said, cost me 500.00 to unlock my computer. To see that person in front of the cop covered with glitter was worth  a lot of satisfaction for us. Thank you again!
You are so so awesome 3 guys like 3 of the best smartest cute to Thank You I share you I shared you with my 92 yr old mom we get them all the time...
You are our Digital Hero of our era! Please keep doing what you doing!
I would like to get in on this. I have an idea for a “Bomb Bomb” to send to them.  It’s not what you think. It’s a bomb that launches a ton of smaller bombs everywhere.
But still, this is just a mule. We need to take down the bad guys in india
Scammers are the ones they didn’t like the vid
Is that woman going to be charged? Is she still behind bars? Would love an update on this case!
You do a brilliant job in exposing these scamers. I have learned a great deal from watching your videos and my defenses are on full alert. Thanks and keep up the good work.

Who came here from Mark Rober?
You did Dude! Someone stole Chewy.com off of my porch! Dog food and a rubber toy. I hope they liked it. I need a glitter, fart, glue box.
Okay but Vivian is serving
best swift n sweet justice i've seen done in such a classic way.. 😂 .. the silly girl pointing at the box (13:54) and probably telling the officer ... "help officer! i don't know what happened..."
I saw that 34230 zip code.   I live in Sarasota, are you local?!
Excellent work... you’ve earned your prize.
Let's goooo!!!! You got one
The only people who dont like this video are the scammers :P
You look right purdy as a blond. LOL

Bravo Bravo!!
👑KING👑
im new to the channel, so i'd just like to say this mans is gonna wipe the scammer population of the face of the earth
I love the justice I really do it just sad that this is the justice we get. Nothing from the government nothing for anyone very sad tbh
This is an incredible service and should become a legit service protected and utilized by law.Thank  you for your time, effort and knowledge. I love these videos.
I’m so so glad you actually caught one awsome
OK, PLEASE DOWNLOAD SNAPCHAT ONTO YOUR COMPUTER, AND THEN "HOOP" AND THEN ALL YA GOTTA DO IS WAIT.     I get them all the time, but they work slightly different. So they add you off hoop, ask you your age, and then they offer to be your sugar momma and send you 700-1200 dollars a week... BUT you have to pay the "charges" for the business acc. Theyll tell you to send it family amd friends (which means you cant cancel). Ive never made it past the pay for money bs cause fuck them, but obviously it must work on some ppl bc theyre still doing it. Theyll also send a photo of someone hot so they can try and get ya latched as fast as possible. I have proof of these assholes, can provide if asked. Hate them sm
Amazing job guys!
The unadvised typhoon intradurally explode because suede controversly carve despite a scandalous chicory. synonymous, yummy handicap
Should really put these scammers' and accomplices' faces out there for the public. Embarrass them incessantly, and make sure the next few years (or the rest) of their lives are extremely difficult. It's absolutely the least they deserve.
Nice video!   Already saw Mark's other videos, as I like the engineering involved.    I hope I don't suddenly believe everything I hear when I reach 70 years old, if I make it that long.  I feel bad for people that are that dumb, which doesn't come automatically with age, I promise.  Can you imagine how many other stupid things they do in life if they believe something so far fetched?  It's like a wild animal that crosses a busy freeway in traffic every day but lives a long life.  How did they make it that long without forgetting to look as they cross a road, or other simple decisions in daily life?  I just hope these scam victims didn't breed, as much of your personality and capabilities in life are determined genetically.
Just once I wanna see a callus reaction  like "Holy fuck you just gave me $40.000, I'm keeping them hahahah!"
I hope you travel to India and glitter bomb the scammers call centres.
he sounds like a nice trucker
You are just fabulous. So is Mark and Jim. So glad you’re out there doing what you do, brother. 👋👋♥️♥️
Love your work. Awesome Dude
you 3 are all legends and deserve honorary medals!!!!!!!!!!
Do. It. More.
Question. So I work in law enforcement and have taken many of these fraud reports and talk to people who have been scammed daily. Luckily it is usually right before they are about to pay these people but they have already let the scammer have access to their computer. What steps or advice should I give them in regards to their computer? Immediately remove/uninstall the program? Change passwords? Turn off wifi? Thank you for what you do.
The scammer speaking in this video is an Indian man, the actual scammer caught in this video is a white woman from Texas. Can someone explain the logic behind this ?
The hungry quality consistently own because adult alternately release amidst a irate married. ten, sparkling starter
610 scammers didn't like this video :) well done
We need an army of scambaiters to ruin these mfs lives

Both you and Mark Rober did a amazing job on both of these videos
You’re a hero buddy the whole world need you. Me and my wife got scammed our hard work money from a scammers in Canada. They convinced us to transfer the money to their account in Simplex. If you can send me your email I would really appreciate it. Please take their information below to stop this happening to other:  William Cole Senior Loan Officer The Great North Finanical
I support u man
Amazing work. Love watching your vids, before I realise I've just watched half a dozen. You gotta go to India...that would be amazing beyond belief. 👍🤝
Legen...    Wait for it!    Dary!  You guys are LEGENDARY
It's why I check my account every day and know the movement of my money every day. I never answer or call back any calls I don't recognize or know nor do I open or press any links in emails that seem like spam or phishing. Keep doing what you're doing, this is useful and needed for everyone.
BLAHAHAHAHAHAH! I love a glitter bomb!
Now imagine the ladies from Kitboga and from Pierogi talking to each other.  Or asking to become money mules or something to "pay back" the money. Or better still, calling into the same call centre with Jim Browning watching over what's going on and Mark Rober already having sent the centre a glitter bomb.
I love the glitter bomb but it is a shame that scammers will survive it.
They got my 88 yr old dad's phone number. Three different scam places has called him in two days. Or it may be the same scammers with different ways to get money. One was social security another was about a subscription cancellation and the last was publishers clearing house. 😠😠😠
Great work, scammers are amongst the lowest of the low, well done!
As a retired widow I get tons of these calls,  but thanks to you  I know what to do now.  Can't thank you enough!
The boundless area comprehensively squeak because moon jelly dislike underneath a mighty shade. woebegone, bite-sized push

I thank you for your heart being in the right place. To use your powers for good and not evil is why we love you so much. I love the fact that there are others who make up your dream team. The U.S. government should take note and perhaps if they pulled their collective heads out of their butts and stop hiding behind a blind eye called " justice" then perhaps these crimes can be reduced . Either way I smile in the fact you take glitter ( I used to hate the stuff until you started using it) and now when I see a jar a crack up knowing how good it is at busting scammers. I take my hat off to you!
1:26 I love how you added that ringback tone.
My grandmas Facebook was hacked. I convinced the scammer to click a link to get his IP address and city in Nigeria but that’s as far as my skills go. I reported him of course but he was on an Android he will probably throw out in a few days. Do you or anyone you know know how to get him by IP address alone?  I also have a phone number he wanted me to call if that helps
Have you tried hand grenades instead of glitter? I'm sure in america it's cheaper to buy a grenade than 4 phones and the other stuff needed to make the Glitter Bomb. It will take time but the message will get thriugh . . . . . .
Oh hell yeah. Beautiful glitter bomb...but, less glitter, more bomb. 🤭😉
Gorilla glue should team up with you so they never get rid of that glitter.
You are a rockstar!!!  Thank you so so much for helping.  My parents have gotten so many of these scammer calls it pisses me off!
Now why is social security department doesn't come after these guys I get one a month from the social security department but I'm not stupid I know they don't call but I get one a month and I fuck with them I keep them on the phone as long as I can so they're not ripping other people off.
I only get five or six scammer calls every single day of the week can you get them all get them all glitter bottle locked up bunch of scumbags of the Earth.
We support you too!!! Keep up the great work! Trust, the videos are hilarious and I've seen the glitter bomb videos as well long before! Again, Keep up the great work!!!!
But they only got the mule not the scammer though 🤔🤷🏻‍♂️
Fight by teaching others how to do what youre doing. All 3 of you guys are awesome!!!
Ok. So new ebay seller. Had a problem and couldn't find ebay #. Googled "ebay number" . Got obnoxious indian guy, had me down load "anydesk" I wouldn't accept it so he got pissed and said he'd red flag my ebay acct to block it! I hung up and deleted any desk! I just tried to call # they gave me a week ago. It was deleted! I just I just tried to Google diff numbers, and they were blocked! THANK YOU GUYS FOR ALL YOU DO!! IM OLD! AND so many of us computer stupid lol! Older people don't know about this!! THANK YOU GUYS!!
602 scammers disliked this video. LOL great work mates!
Hell ya. This is a win for the good guys. Keep this up!!
It would be nice if a "60 Minutes" or similar show would do some serious investigative reporting and do this story.
i would assume, in India someone can only be reprehended for a crime as long as it can be reversed easily in less then a days work... so... broken bar of soap can be fixed by melting it, if problem bigger then that. empty sack no hands lives rest of life behind the prison wall.
God Bless you!
Who dislikes these videos??? Scammers/scam supporters?  Great job guys, i give you thumbs up all the way!
Ahhhh, such a wholesome channel. From a geek like me who has had to educate his wife's grandparents about being scammed and who've been scammed in the past, thank you for taking the time doing this.  Incredible work.
I need a cap like yours... sooo cool
Those sociopaths are all going to Hell!!
Great work !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You are fighting the good fight and I thank you for that. Keep up the good work.
Well done and keep it going!
There needs to be PSAa like the smoking TRUTH campaign that explains these scams.
YOZZZZ - Go - fight! WIN!!!!
For me it's very easy, I just don't accept calls outside of Canada. Period. Because if I answer them it's billed to my cellphone provider as I do not have unlimited minutes in any other country aside Canada.
Congratulations for your work!
Next time you make a video of deleting scammers files you should delete system 32! I'm not 100% sure about this but it may even prevent them from installing and old backup.
Vivian is Mmmm attractive, you should stay that way.
God I so want to see more of this I get these calls all the time P.S. If you ever need help feel free to call
excellent job bro! u r a real hero...
A real man of honor !!! I love your work. It makes me happy and sad at the same time...
Hold up, if she was arrested why is her face covered up? The cops face was not covered.
I wonder if anyone after seeing that they recieved more $$ as a refund than they were supposed to ever said: Haha well f u it's my money now. :D
0:13 one of my local stations even reporting on this
Ha! Genius
I wanna see a scam call where the victim just says "yay more money!" and then hangs up
Best yet!!

This dude is the greatest vigilante hero ever....He is like a crime fighting Batman...
U all are amazing. Ty. I watched ur vids a few yrs ago and knew when I got the calls what to do. I got so many calls back then.. I even tried to stay on phone and waist their time but I wasn't as good as I are.lol ty for all u do in getting the word out.
Bwahahahahaha Bwahahahahaha lololololol omg Bwahahahahaha Bwahahahahaha thank you. I caught a porch pirate last month. Punk kid was begging me not to call the cops. Actually pissed his pants while in cuffs. Heard him tell the cop. I gotta piss. Lolol cop said, so what. Go piss before you go steal. Haven't heard yet if I have to go to court over it. Neighbor gave me 2 elk roasts and some a package of backstrap!!! Guessing kid didn't eat elk in jail.
What they do is hilarious, what you do amazing and you have saved so many people from being scammed. While you are giving them the runaround they can't scam another person, you should teach a class on your process to a government agency...this is where I want some of my tax dollars to go.
Had messages from the uk tax fraud scam, I just blocked them now I wish I had wasted their time
PRICELESS...YOUR AWESOME ALL YOU GUYS....FIGHT...FIGHT...FIGHT...I WILL BE YOUR CHEERLEADER...🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹

I was inspired to try to mess with a Social Security scammer... I can't lie well and  ended up giggling the entire time and then panicked when they asked for my SSN and hung up. Well done Pierogi!
Get'em.
Guyssss. What was the conclusion of the livestream yesterday? I had to leave after the call where he pretended to be the guy from the bank. I neeeeeeed to know what else happened.
Ive been getting multiple scammer calls daily it’s literally getting old . I’m to the point where idk what’s a scam and what’s not . I wish you could help me
Might need to step up from glitter with incriminating ink
Not just is this amazing, but your voice is so soothing
Thank you. Love justice.
Why not use smart water, which can't be washed off? or the coloured dyes that banks use?
please help me out ! i believe i am a scam target :(
Turns out Vivian is a big beautiful woman 😂
Thank you for your hard, selfless work, day and night, to protect people from these horrendous scammers. 🤓👏👏👏  I pray there are a lot more Vivians out there doing the same as her. Poor scammers. 🙄  I'm going to share your video on my social media sites.  God bless you for caring.  You are a very good person. I'm sure He is proud of you. 😇🙏
very good
I am from India. Huge respect for you. Please continue this work. Our government is doing nothing.
Scammer get scam
How stupid illigrants there can be!
I'm just here to say - that's a gorgeous hair color!  And the video as well, of course :)
Your metallic midnight blue hair is HORRIBLE. Go natural!

while calling a scammer  idiots like them tell them you are a cop and scare them these idiots should be thought a lesson  they are making india look bad

I appreciate what you do since I had a hard on for nigerian 419 scams back in the Bush admin. Bush's secret service was actually fielding the complaints and refused or discouraged me from actually making the complaint,   when i had a fake check which was intended to enter the banking system. A federal crime for sure. I harassed the scammers back with all sorts of problems getting the money to them, sometimes 4 to 6 weeks tying them up, giving them false hopes of actually getting the money. I would then accuse them of getting the money or product  and threaten them with a variety of consequences which were quite effective.  I made one scammer delete his email account for fear of the Nigerian government being close to raiding his home.  This went on for years and I had a small group of  subscribers getting all the email between me and the scammers.  There was always the great reveal to them that they were being counter scammed.   I never had so much fun fighting scumbags who were attacking our elderly.  I still do it if I get an email scammer.  So thank you !
Hey, you might not even see this post but our Internet provider (talktalk) is now issuing a statement that they are having issues with all sorts of pc cloud control services 😂 no doubt the servers have been taken down by you guys right?
Bonjour, Well play ! keep going ! i have a small question about twitch Bot . 1min after going on someone live(in sience and technoligic) a stream called bot config , i recieved a text on my phone that told me to check for a mail box at some weird link , so is it possible to try hacking from a twitch bot the people that come to this stream? i cant found the streamer anymore so it may be some useless post, sry about this, but maybe you have an idea of what people can do with Bot.  Bye
You guys are heros
I love that the website icon is the default react lol
This is the content I came for, I have wanted this video since i saw it on the glitter bombs channel!
John 14:6 Jesus said, " I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me."
Go to the store I will not 😭.. 😂😂😂
lol steven is so funny like a little baby 🤣 “go to the store then ill stop crying”
Way to kick butt
FINALLY, GREAT JOB!😭😭😭😭😭🥰🥰🥰🥰
I was baited by a scammer at a really low point in my life and they took advantage of my emotional state. They revealed themselves as a scammer and tried to threaten me but they couldn't scare me because, honestly my life couldn't get much worse. I came across you and John Browning today and I think what you guys do is really important. Best way I can support right now is just binge watch both your channels. Keep up the amazing work :)
Question: Do you think Vivian will become famous amongst the scammers and you'll have to retire her character for someone else? If you have to retire her, do patrons get to choose the next character's name?
The most heroic people in America. I idolise you.
You're awesome, I love what you're doing, I'm glad you're a million times richer than I'll ever be. Gonna keep it real though: I think your recent decisions with your hair look stupid.  I hope you become 100x richer and happier than you are now
Heyy mate! I'm from South India and I too hate such scamming, cause once I was just about to get scammed but luckily I didn't,  just let me know if there's ANYTHING that I could help you with.😇
I love these videos haha. I gotta show my grandma so she stops almost getting scammed 😭😂💀   I once got a scammer to make animal noises and the whole things was hilarious haha
Ur amazing
They cry coz of too much Bollywood
I got the social security one the other day and fucked with him so bad that he was screaming thru the phone. Finally he said he was suspending my social security number and I asked if that would cancel my student loans and he hung up
The crime isn't against wealthy people or corporations, so the cops give zero fucks
The three of you do amazing work that is also entertaining. After sharing Mark’s video with my parents, they are retired and pushing 80, an interesting thing has happened. During the winter they live in a Campground in FL along with several retirees. During one of the park’s cocktail hours recently, my parents started telling other retirees about this. I want the three of you to know that your information, education, and entertainment videos are being shared with our elders. And they are loving it.
Hey i get a lot of emails especially from the fbi surveillance unit to pay via cashapp or Bitcoin apps is this legit?
OMFG😂🤣 I lost it when he said "I love you too pita" at 7:46😂
Thank you thank you thank you!! The government needs to hire you guys your better detectives than they are!! so sad, its as if they didn't care ! What's strange they haven't called me in awhile but I'm ready for them now, they tried several years ago telling me I needed to renew my Microsoft? And I thought I've never took out Microsoft so I quickly look it up on my computer and it said it was a scam, I told him that and he begged reassuring me it wasn't, and I hung up then one called said my SS# was stolen and I was to be arrested I told him he was a scammer and didn't he have any morals scamming old people then he asked what are you going to do about it, and said something dirty I told him God will deal with him in due time !
How can i get my money back via gift cards ?
Why hide the filthy criminals face?
I wish there was a way that we could catch these fuckers. Please continue to do what you’re doing. You are educating all of our parents so that way it doesn’t happen to them too! My mom got scammed by the Edison scammers… Told her they were going to cut off her electricity and got her to go to CVS and send money via Western Union they got it for over $1000! Then they called her back and told her she forgot to include a $400 late fee my mom was so embarrassed she was too afraid to tell if she had forgotten to pay her bill. If she would’ve told us we would’ve been able to tell her it was a scam but that is how easy it is for seniors to be scammed!,,
😂🤣
I mean... if we removed the glitter part from the glitter bomb and just started mailing them bombs left and right I think we could put a stop to this rather quick.
I've been through a very tough time lately and somehow come to watch your channel you are so unique and you are a true gift to humanity. I  guess my day is a bit better knowing your helping poor hopeless individual's you should be very proud of yourself as people across the world are of you.
Pog
Go GET EM! My Mom just had 5000 dollars taken from her account......Sorry but now I'm P*SS8D
Great Advocacy 😇🤓
with each vid by mark, and Jim Browning there's only so much you can do but try to be more careful with links you click which can differ tricky methods getting more and more wild and crafty just don't reuse passwords, use F2A (it's not the best but it helps) and SMS sending pass codes is dated to can just only hope for new methods to come but the con artist will keep up in trying to trick many the endless cycle just be careful and skeptical of calls, text messages said to be from the biggest companies that normally don't call you for things to ask you those direct questions.
Do you happen to be a fan on Runescape?
583 scammers did not like this video...but man, I really enjoyed this. it was awesome
Vivian ❤
Thank you for trying to make the public aware of these horrible scammers. The governments of all countries should make it mandatory to have on all tv channels commercial breaks through the day an awareness public announcement about these scams. Maybe just maybe it will get the message through to these vulnerable people how these scammers operate. These scammers are never going to stop if all the worlds population are not made aware on how they operate.  If government can put public announcements out to benefit themselves then surely they can protect their own people with a similar worldwide announcement and let it run for months and months till the message gets through to people. It’s a disgrace they won’t commit to these protection methods.  Until they do it’s a good job we have you and others committed to trying to oust the scum of the earth.
Like mark said in his video, best way to stop this is just getting this information out there so we can take away their power by not answering and getting it harder for them to get money so it becomes a obsolete scam.
This... Is.... Fake! Fools
Entertaining! Keep up!
GO GET THEM!!!!!
keep up the great work
Are you live stream only for you membership ? Just curious ..??  I am not supporter of scammers or hackers ..just saying.  They are not welcome in this Youtube.  Everyone world wide be safe and wear a mask in this on going Pandemic Virus Crisis.  Rip for those that deceased from Pandemic Virus World wide.
I always see these scam recruiter ads on facebook in the houston area based groups. Random ppl with obvious fake accounts from like zimbabwe, nigeria, india, or wherever looking for people to i guess be the ones who pick up the air b nb  packages like in the video. I never knew what to do about it when seeing those.  But mark or jim might make some use of that. I just dont know how we could let them know.
People will not wake up anytime soon.  There's so much manipulation so easily done right now, that it's being done right in front of them and they don't even see it  It is very sad.
Yay you guys!  Just loving on you guys!!!
*COATED* in glitter... his glitter bombs are seriously epic.... thanks guys for taking down another piece of 💩
Thank you Pierogi for this video and Thank You also Mark and Jim for your partnership in taking down another scammer.
Subscribed :)
Here a fun idea hire leurak of vinesause Microsoft destroying fame, listening to a scammer react to a purple gorilla and a bus bricking their computer will be hilarious!
Help me get this scammer : Jack Love he has a  yt channel tbis p.o.s. took  $2000 in btc
What is wrong with these people???  They have no morals.
what you Mark and Jim are doing is so grate and hopefully one day someone will take down the organisation  and to the person reading this it could be you if you try to make a difference
You guys are amazing!
577 scammers are SEETHING right now.  :D
My mom is 83 years old, and she knows to ALWAYS call me whenever anything like this comes up on her phone or computer.  I've drummed it into her head that no company or government agency would EVER call her.  She's watched me mess with these idiots, and we always have a good laugh.  :D Keep up the great work guys!
I work in a legit IT company, and after watching your videos, whenever I go through the motions of remoting into their computer, I feel a little dirty even though I know I'm doing nothing wrong... damn scammers!  Doing God's work, man.  Keep it up.
Why not show the punks face??
so dramtic
GOOD JOB!
you are amazing
I got my grandmas phone routed to me since she gets about 5-8 scam calls per week, but whenever i pick up the call they listen to my voice and hang up. They think they are calling my passed Grandpa, well my issue is i cant report them to the police if they dont talk to me, does anyone have any decent adivse? i guess i just suck at changing my voice... even tried like taking my time between accepting the call and talking and changing other behavioural patterns u´d assume an old person behaving.
Love what you did and how it turned out, but dude, pixelating the face is not really necessary if you show the face anyway on the map-thing where you sent the package ^^'
Thank You
Top draw. Bravo
I hope you get offered a job with the FBI or criminal services
The big question I have is who do the scammers work for? What country are THEY from? What organisation or group?
Thank you
I'm new to this chanel. Is pierogi From polish pierogi?
You're a modern day tech hero!
where do i learn to protect myself? do you sell a course or have a website of what i can do / know to stay protected?
The dislikes are from the scammers 😂😂
546 Scammers already DISKLIKED his video ! hahahah!
good job guys ! Keep going ! Maybe try horse manure instead of glitter.
Hunting these guys down needs to move from YouTube to a legit reality show.  Start of with a ten part series sponsored by Netflix or something.  I think they would eat this up.   Think of all you could do if you were backed by hollywood.  You would have legit sponsors, connections with law enforcement in multiple countries, travel budgets, etc...   I think you would find the police in India suddenly become very cooperative when the cameras are rolling.   I look at this as a fun first step but this needs to go soooooo much bigger.
I work for Geek Squad and it's so sad that people fall for this. Keep doing what you're doing!
Sorry to say but the BEST advice is that if they sound Hindi just hang up.
I might have a preference for longer, drawn-out baiting to really let that anger simmer, but you do good shit man. Never stop fucking with them, my dude
Intro: ... Me: call of duty advanced warfare flash backs
I am so appreciative of you guys. My Mom is 85....I am so fearful everyday that she will be scammed like this. THANK YOU
ive watched 3 diffrent videos with this same scene
Thank you so much!
God bless you.
What's up? New sub.
These are your real life superheroes.
Amazing
Keep the good work i'm sure that most of us are with you that these people need to be convicted of there crimes.
What happened to the mule? Is she still in jail? Was it on the news?
Instead of fart spray find skunk spray
I appreciate you for all that you do! The three of you are role models that other people should follow!
Whoever disliked this vid is a scammer, change my mind
Best video ever. Thank you for this video.😁😁❤️
You should show her face.  These people need to go down.
Sometimes I'm extremely grateful I'm from a non English speaking country who's population is to small for these big call scams
Thanks for doing this!!! <3
Add a generous amount of scatol (smells of sh*t), cadaverine (smells of ead bodies) and butyric acid (smells of old sweat)to the fart spray. Better, distribute it explosively, so that it will contaminate the whole apartment / house plus the person and last for months. The procedures to make the first chemicals are on the Youtube channel by NileRed, a chemistry geek.
True scammer payback.
Do these scammers only lose what's on their computers or can you mess with their main computer that the company is using?  That would be great.
I was just watching your stream yesterday and now you get recommended to me on YouTube
How awesome!
Just come from Mark and this is incredible lol
5:11 🤣
I keep asking Jim Browning how I can help him but he never gets back to me.  I have a CEH certification and I'm SICK, SICK, SICK of these scammers taking advantage of honest and vulnerable people.
John 3.16-21 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.
Do more do more rip them off and give the money to charity
I am DOWN to go to INDIA with you.
Post their phone numbers so we can waste their time
Ok so what would happen if in the event they transfer the money to your account and you shut down everything and hold their money?
552 scammers don't like this video.
Do you wanna us border customs scam? I got them on the hook there supposed to be calling me back for $750 they  Say they have intercepted a package?
Seeing that person at 13:55 covered in glitter and trying to explain that to the police was so satisfying. 😅
my Mom and all her senior friends thank you :)
Appreciate what u do
The thumb down replies must be from the scammers 😂
Too cool, too many people get got, thank you folks
Perfect level of blue in the hair bro! Looks good
indirectly a reason i scared of people. in a way im would be  thankful without u ranting
Only just discovered your channel and this is only the 6th video I've watched but I'm weirdly proud of you and will support you once I'm able. I look after an old chap and he's always getting calls like this which upsets him greatly as he worries even after I've assured him he's to ignore their manipulation. I have dreamed of being able to drop a little personal information to freak freak out. Good work.
I'm watching this in the waiting room for my class, and the music I was hearing in there while I was watching 11:30, makes the thing seem like a joke.
Dude, he’s looking good as Vivian though! That red lipstick suits him.
I love.you and the work that you do bro!
What is the sentence for that scammer any one know ? Good job for those who work to catch them 👊
AWESOME JOB..........KEEP IT UP
So..... what happened to the person that got the glitter bomb? were they the scammer? were they arrested?
Or maybe just for safety measures and I mean no offense If I recognize their accent just drop it
Damn fine job bro, keep up the good work!
Hi, I've been watching a lot of your content over the past day or so, and love the work you are doing. I wish I had the know how and expertise to do what you do to keep Australians safe the way you do. I watched the Susan videos, crying, just knowing that you, and others, are doing some amazing work.
Oscar worthy this is not lol
So we have Angry Steve and Crying Steven. What is wrong with all these Stevens?
I also went to these type of call centers for job but I never joined back , believe or not India, Pakistan and Philippines are leading, all this call centers are operated openly here from big cities to small
These guys are just so focused on getting that coin that they don’t ever realise how much Vivian is taking the piss 🤣🤣
they would earn money if they were actors.
Thank you for all you do!!!
A key part in this scam is to say OK every three seconds.
I want to know what charges were brought to them.
Please come to India.........
🤣🤣🤣 you are a dude
Love you brother... Love from India
You doing a mighty fine job there Mark ...very entertaining ripping those scammers off
I thought this was a DanTDM video by the thumbnail.. 😂
The fake cries kill me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hi. Do You have a Polish roots?
"I am Pirogi..."   My stomach: "Yes please"
I am an Indian and I am ashamed at these people who are scamming and destroying innocent people. At the same time I couldn't be more proud of the job you guys are doing  to stop it. God bless!
MORE GLITTER BOMBS
You are doing a great job!! Most of the victims are retired persons. My suggestion is to run an interview and/or article in the AARP Magazine, so more people can recognize when they are being scammed. Peace!
Saw this video yesterday on yur and mark's channel, just can't get it out of my head. Bro just keep doing this work .btw love yur videos, u said yall will be coming to India to catch some scammers, seriously that'll be really cool.
halfway through the video, already liked and subbed, KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK :D
You guys are doing a fantastic job, congrats!

I am so hook with his content and Mark Rober.. It's like watching  a Netflix Docu Series and your dying to see how the next episode unfolds and always on edge to take down these scumbags.. Love and respect  from Philippines ❤️   We need more people like you guys.. Our Modern super heroes....
Been binge watching this channel since I found it a few days ago and you and your team are doing amazing work, keep it up :)
Common sense  is NOT so common 🤦🏾‍♂️
the 543 dislikes are probably scammers
Yesss! Go get ‘em!
LOVE U, MARK & JIM!!!  U guys are our ANTI SCAM HERO's!!
I absolutely LOVE this crossover🥰
Much love back!
I thought it was illegal to send glitter bombs in Texas
I tip my hat to you, Good Sir!
Is there a way to do a class or program to teach people how to do what you do to them and make a call center of our own? I would gladly put some time into doing that. Building a networked response is really the only way to stop the sheer magnitude of the scamming network.
54k likes!!!!!! Y’all deserve everything you guys manifested, thank you for maintaining this amazing channel fuck yea!!! Y’all doing gods work and youre slowly making America and the world a more secure place, thank you from the bottom of my heart
The pick UPS are their weakest link right now
I guarantee if you guys put the call out then you could get volunteers from all 50 States to be it pick up sites and we could really start making this difficult on these guys
Fuck yeah 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I live one city away from Pearland! That's absolutely nuts that they're here!
Tell Mark to add spray glue so the glitter sticks even more !
Very simply, I freaking love you man! Thank you!!!
Thank You & God Bless You!
Tonight I just learned that my mother's friend Deb got a call from "Amazon" and they took 700 dollars from her. She's about to have a stroke, she called my mother in tears and barely able to talk. It's hard not to hate these scammers, but I hate them. All of those people who maliciously hurt others, be it financial or whatever, it makes me sick to my stomach.  We both started to watch you and I was hoping that my mom was going to tell me she told her not to give them money, but it was far too late. I'm glad there are scam baiters out there like you.
Don't ever stop. Excellent job good work. Thank you.
I wish I knew how to do what you do.  If enough people could do this.  Maybe, just maybe, it would make it not worth their while.  I know it's wishful thinking.  However, people who take advantage of others really tick me off.  Thank all of you who disrupt at least some of them.
This is awesome! You could tackle the scammers that have been calling me for weeks now... Seriously, I block every number they "call" from (if it's even their real number) and they leave a voicemail everytime and it's the saaaaame scripts and same 3 people. They call from Oregon numbers, which I have an Oregon phone number cause I USED to live there... 8 years ago. They call about debt or a financial matter, job resume, and insurance. It's so annoying and I want to answer the phone and mess with them, but I'm not cool enough for that 🤣🤣🤣 thank you for what you're doing! This is so great!!
AMAZING!
U had me bawling w/ laughter dressed up as "Vivan" u went full force even painting ur nails...holy crap that's an image that is now burnt in my head *shivers 🤣🤣🤣

Your the best!!!!
I understand that the majority of these scammers prey upon people whom are not tech savvy, and of those they ideally aim for elderly people...  but come on, even if you're not tech-savvy or you're elderly, it should be common sense that this person you're speaking to over the phone is using a fake name when they have an Indian accent, with a name *whiter* than most white people.  I have a better chance running into an Asian person named Tyrone Jackson, than running into an Indian person named Steven WIlliams.
What worries me about sending the glitter bomb is that you don't know if it's an innocent victim who gets it and the scammer is telling them they have to open it and do something with it, lying to them why they are doing it.
Technically in Canada by setting up an exploding device of any sort, it would be illegal.  Defending property with any sort of weapon is also illegal in Canada (if not barehanded or less than six inch blade).  There was a famous case of two teenagers fishing in a privately owned pond.  The owner came out and shot a gun over their heads.  You guessed it, the owner went to jail for one year.
You three are heroes! I think of my grandparents and great grandparents and it's thanks to seriously amazing human beings like you that I know that they will eventually be safe, everyone will be because of all the hard work that you guys do, so thank you so much for everything and for sharing, it is truly appreciated ❤😊❤😊
Hope your you and your family are safe and well. I wanted to reach out to you and possible get ur take on a situation.  Damn hacking scammers need to be put on blast .
We should put hardcore economic sanctions on India to teach them to not be such scum.
Literal avengers
Love what you're doing! If I have numbers or emails would you like them posted or sent to you? If so what is the best way to get them to you?
How about you can make a training kit to train other people to get payback on these scammers. We just need more people deleting their files and wasting their time.
Excellent video!  Thanks for all you guys do!!
I saw Mark Rober's video about the same thing.
Flips her hand like she doesn’t smell like shit and is covered in a pound of gliter
I NEVER comment, but we LOVE YOU!!!
Not all hero’s wear capes!
Sorry for asking, this is my first video of you but i have to ask, why is your name "dumplings"?
Could you pretend to be a Karen and yell at the scammer, demand for their manager, etc? Or would they just hang up?
Now this is epic
9:24 "PLAYED BY PIEROGI" zjadł bym.
im so happy that you exist
You, sir, are doing the Lord's work!! Keep this up and scammers are going to be scared to open a bag of Cheetos!
I’m glad these scammers are being trolled but they belong in jail they have stolen billions from from law abiding citizens and the government and police are doing little to nothing about it.
Damn why am I so in love with your Voice? It’s so calm her manly 😩🥰
Got a scam call while watching this 🙄
What you are doing is amazing.  Thank you!
Can you use your spidey powers to have some scammers put 80000 in my accounts? Lol. God it would be life changing..
This is technically war, when you think about it. India is waging war against America, they're just not bombing our houses, they're bombing our grandparent's bank accounts. If the government can't or won't get this under control, I feel it's a declaration of war.
My Gramma used to make the best homemade pierogis😋🥟

You three are the tri force of anti scammers
You doing great WORK but where the hell is the FBI?
This is amazingly awesome
pasta malone lol!!
"We might just go to India someday..." fucking yes please, that would be the most epic content of all time
You should talk about phone spoofing and what happens
You are such an inspiration!! Thank you for everything you do. You are a true angel. It is so good to know there are good people like you out there <3
I have my own method of dealing with them. When I hear an Indian accent on the other end of the line I tell them I don't want to talk to them because I can't trust anyone that has an Indian accent. I tell the caller that, IF he's legit, he should complain to his government that scammers are impacting his livelihood. If enough people do that, eventually people in India will start hunting these creeps down.
Bringing humor to entertain the public in this fight is the best way to spread the news about these scammers.
Amazing!!
Box full of dirty cat litter sounds great
Might be rude but as soon as I hear an Indian accent I hang up
How about the scammers that call with a recorded message your SSN was involved in illegal activity and is now suspended, and you have to call to reactivate it?
You should refresh the banking webpage after scammers edit the html
Love you and all that you do to help others. 🥰❤🙏 watching you and others like kitboga helps defeat depression.
Big round of applause! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Can you upload more im sooooorry I just get so bored im sooooooooorry
Wow, never heard such fake cry after a long time, like c'mon, my 3 years old brother can do better than that.
Who wants him to send fireworks?😀😀😀
fucking HATE scammers with a passion. we should send them live grenades instead.
One thing I suggest everyone to do is contact those you're worried about this happening to and tell them to do two things: 1) Hang up the call and contact the company that the scammer is claiming to be directly using the number on your bill or to contact someone who can get a legit number. That way you can confirm you don't actually owe money. (ebay once sent me an email saying I bought a bunch of iPhones and it was real - my account got hacked). 2) tell them to hang up if they make any claims about a family member needed money and have them get ahold of that family member. In general, if anyone is asking for money in some way shape or forum, the best practice is to have someone younger or more in the know, handle it. Saves a lot of headaches. I told my grandma just to call myself if anyone starts asking for money.
My man,. you are a true hero. I get these calls and play along as a uninformed old man (which I actually am) goofing up my payment information, etc over the phone as I tell them I am NOT online,. that I can only send money to 'unlock my social security number' that has had suspicious activity on it (dumb scammers) My SS number has had suspicious activity? Uhm,.. ok! So,. in a very worried shaking voice I ask them what can I do to insure that this is done and handled. They start asking me numbers and I pretend to screw up giving them the information they need many times over. I finally end the call after about 15 minutes with saucy something about 'your mother" (and I always wondered why the heat got so hot so quick,. now I know) but now I know to use 'brother in law' also after binge watching your videos last night.   Instead of the US using our tax dollars to fund wars to make rich men richer,. they should hire professionals like you who steal billions from the elderly. They KNOW they can do this,. placing teams all over of your caliber,. they just do not care. Bless you for what you do. You are my hero,. as well as the hero of many others,. I assure you. I am in my 60's but have elderly friends who I am constantly calling and reminding them to NOT fall for these scams every time I hear of a new M/O they are using. My best to you.
The fact that they go after the elderly pisses me off. I see red when I think people would try to do this to my grandma. More needs to be done to these scum.
ok

Great work. Some of the only quality and wholesome content out there.
Just want to say I really respect and appreciate what you are doing for all the naive, good hearted people out there! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Not sure how possible this is, but could you look into job scammers? Someone I know recently got scammed out of money when she thought she interviewed for a legitimate job,. I'm so pissed right now. Hoping you read this comment. I would hate for others to fall victim.
instead of more guns and armored vehicles, we need funding for more squads like these guys...
Do you have a tutorial setup on how to reverse fuck them over? I get these calls at least 3 times a DAY.. Would love to join up and start fucking them back.
Mmhm
Loved it
You are a hero !
Wow this is the best ending of any of the scammer videos.
We love you Vivian !! LMAO!!
U need to be stupid to believe those Scammers. Why the fuck should they fine u 3k if u do or buy nothing xd .. so u send a glitterbomb😆how old are u man😅
Dabloh dabloh dabloh
Bwuhahahaha! I love this. I just spent a glorious 40 minutes playing a doddering old fool to waste the time of a scammer who "works" for BT (British Telecom) and wanted me to install Team Viewer to fix my router. Our conversation stopped when I interrupted her mid-flow, told her I wasn't an idiot, that I'd enjoyed wasting her time and finally to fuck off ... I was bored 😂
do not stop !!!!
👍👋👋👋😁
Gg
I got scammed yesterday on steam someone wanting to trade and they were able to somehow grab my password and take the account under their email address and password to were they had my account so I warned my friends about this guy who has my account and if I ask to trade it’s not me don’t click the link then I did a whole bunch of stuff and steam was able to get my account back
The true Vivian Rogers is so beautiful.
you should have sung Congratulations by PewDiePie
A thing of beauty.... and im not just talking about those scarlet lips.
what they really need to send are pipe bombs..
I love your channel. Thank you for all you do. I’m grateful my grand parents don’t fall for this bs
You're doing God's work! Thank you for looking out for us and making us laugh 🤗
I wouldn’t suggest going to India. There’s a whole bunch of people who REALLY don’t like you there. Their laws are not our laws. That makes me nervous for you.
I don’t like the whole “guy in a dress” gag because it’s not funny but you looked very pretty
I saw marks video and it had the same person
When ever scammers call me I always call them mister scammer, or I claim to be the fraud department for the local police service. They hang up on that one pretty quickly.
Watching from ph. Sooooww amaze ... Your the man sir😁👊 new subscriber sir😁👌..
LOVE YOUR WORK!! I can tell a scam most of the time, but for all those who can't - you are a life saver. Thank you for what you do. I've just binged about 10 of your videos :P
Hi, Pierogi. I'd like to thank You (you, Mark and Jim) for what You are doing. It makes me believe that people can do incredible good things. Greetings from Poland.

Mark Robber, Jim Browning, and Pierogi are the holy trinity.
Chutiya crying 🤣🤣🤣 I love it 🤣🤣🤣Harami Vada Pav, Dal roti 🤣🤣🤣
You should do a team up with someone who can drop usb killers to the scammers shop. Maybe if you can find the scammers  company logo get custom screen printed usb killers and send them off to them
Love the crime fighting YouTube collaboration efforts!! Every day heroes!
Was waiting for this
Wig, lipstick, etc is scary on you man.
"I love you Peter" 😂😂 and when you started singing post malone omfg
You sound really genuine and concerned. What a guy. I have thought of a way that you could help the victims of these terrible scams even more. You should donate all your Youtube earnings to the victims of phone scams who have has their lives ruined.
Thank you! Be safe and God bless you and your family.
This box should have water installed, something like Smart Water to permanently change the color of the skin. Scammer would look like a Smurf.

Best trick to watch out is if your phone says "Scam Likely" or there is a Indian guy saying refund department I need access to your PC blah blah blah blah...
About 10 years ago my husband and I kept a scammer on the phone for 3 days in a row. Scammer told us that we had viruses on our computer and it was the reason why it was running slow. We both pretended to be old people and agreed that yes, it was running slow, it takes a long time to start.... Here we go 😝 Told scammer yes, just turned on pc. After about an hour he kept asking if it was on yet, said no, it takes a very long time. After 3 hours of him asking if it was on yet and us saying not yet(still pretending to be old people not too worried about the speed of "calculator" coz it always goes slow, sometimes takes a day to turn it on) then scammer hangs up. He rings back 15 mins later and asks if PC is booted up yet. We say "no, we turned it off coz you hung up, we thought you fixed it" Scammer says turn it back on. Again for 3 hours he holds on, us saying it is very slow and not yet ready to login. He hangs up. Rings back, we say sorry, turned it off... You get the idea. We had this scamming idiot going for 3 days straight. To the scammer's credit, he never got angry or overly pushy.  BTW, had full protection plus thorough knowledge of coding as we mechatronics engineers also running an eBay business. After 3 days, 10+ hours/day he hung up saying he'd call the next day. I reckon he got fired LMFAO
It sucks how everytime the scammers accent is indian Like. Sad to see my country has so much of this going on.. Thanks pierogi, helping us clean up trash
Why does crying Steven sound like the guy "hi I'm under the water here too much raining huhu 😭"?
thank u so much we appreciate everything u do
Hi I reallyyyyyy need help can you or do you know how to fix this? I received a ransomware virus and all my files are now ".enfp" and I can't do anything on my computer. I really need help please. They're asking me for $480.im just a student in the Philippines.

I just got contacted by a rental scammer, this is my first scammer ever. I'm excited to fuck with them.
You guys are the greatest
Love it!!!
Same scammer from the other video man. I thought it was a new scammer. Can't you go to the monthly Commission meeting that's public in your state and speak about it? Bring facts and prepare for it. Will be quick and you will only have 2 or 5 minutes to speak about it.

Bro I don't know how  i stumbled upon your video man I am so happy to see your video and I feels good to know that there are people like you in the world
You are so right!  This is EXTREMELY important work.  I work billing support for a clothing company and everyday I have to help customers who have to deal with fraud and stolen banking information.   Keep it up!!!
Thanks for your service man.
they tried to Steal $700  of me to scammers did it was IRS scam email
Is there anything I can do with all these cashier checks they keep sending me.  I don't know computers but I like messing with them on the phone and in messages and emails.  Just curious about the 10000 dollars in checks I have.
I like the obvious spelling and grammar errors. 7:17 lol
Need help please....
This is amazing 🙏🏼 #Quality
Should send an F1 Granada in a Box instead of the cash. seriously scammers need to leave this earth....  Although on 2ed thought it be better to intercept the money and build an anti scammers business with there own funds
Can you teach me to do this? Id love to work on a software with you that the government can use to find these people.
The clumsy spider likely reduce because chord intradurally search round a adorable lightning. superficial, rampant cauliflower
I had one of these scammers call me once. He said his name was Peter Parker in a very thick Indian accent. I asked him if he was really Spiderman too and he said yes. I then said it was so cool that I was hanging up on Spiderman! Click.
HOW can she be (dumb) enough to put the bomb in the car too? 🤣😂 Thank you for what you do against scammers!
Recently discovered your channel Pierogi and have been bingeing since. Love what you do, every second you talk to the scammers is a second they don’t get to scam someone else. It is scary how advanced the modern world has become. Anyone over a certain age didn’t have this technology growing up and it is scary to think that the more naive of them could lose their life savings.
You're doing the lords work!  Thank you and keep it up!
GGs
Yay. You guys are awesome.
Anyone who adds a “thumbs down”: I assume you’re a scammer
That was awesome!!!
I've notices a lot of cross dressing with these scammer youtube sites....hmmmm
Great work! Let me know if you need any footage/pictures of any scam centers in Bangalore, I can help.
Curious, you guys working with actual law enforcement?  No way in hell it is legal to use listening devices inside your package, seriously not legal.  Even for law enforcement that would require a pretty hefty warrant, usually only used in RICO or organized crime type investigations.
Pierogi, love everything you've done for our world. It's amazing what you've done with your determination, consistency, and skill to make this planet a better place. Cannot thank you enough for all the people you have helped, especially by educating our most vulnerable, so they are aware and safer. What a good human being you are!  Also, I love your blue hair color and style!!! Looks terrific on you! 👍👍👍
How will we recognize her? She’s sparkly and smells like sh!t! Lol! It’s great!
Awesome job!  I really detest these human scum that prey on older people who do not know any better.  I hope they all burn in hell.
I wish I was able to set up a fake bank account. Just have then add the wrong amount and then I will tell them I have to go. I would tell him also he could now get food stamps.
Your paybacks are fantastic, an incredibly valuable service. The scammers and other robocallers could be put out of business merely by having to pay 1c per call. The government or phone companies should require this! The mass callers make hundreds of thousands of calls for every victim who picks up the phone.
8:30 is when the real fun starts... lol "I DIDN'T RAISE YOU THIS WAY!"
Thank you
i could literally watch shows like this all day. Good for you guys.  What happens when you catch the supervisors or mules. Does the upstream stuff close down and then start again somewhere else or is there really justice for these people?
Proud of you.
My coworkers mother committed suicide after she lost her money to a scammer who pretended to be in an relationship with her, it was devastating. Thank you for all you do, you really are making a difference.
You forgot about Karl Rock, he lives in India and exposes scammers too. I think Jim has worked with him before.
How do you get access to their files?
Why hasn't someone developed a false bank page yet for people to go to for situations like this that alerts the police and or fbi with their ip address, etc to trace them? Bank of hibs (help I'm being scammed). Would be amazing to get these suckers handled in the masses.
this is why I don't answer the phone for numbers I don't know or if I'm waiting for a call they slip in. if a company owes me I tell them to refund the account they have on file if they say no do it their way I say it's not worth it. and if I owe money I wait until I'm contacted by the company's lawyers and I pay in full to the company, not over the phone.
I'm new to this, but why doesn't the remote log in apps just have a big disclaimer saying they don't work with Microsoft, Amazon etc. That would alert people.
I can't believe people fall for these scams.
YOU  AND MARK ARE THE BEST!!!!!!
Blue hair, seriously !
i really wish i could win the lottery i would donate soooooooooo much
488 scammers are upset they will be out of business soon.
Woo
Damn is Vivian single?
the crying wouldn't bother me.Would probably laugh
If these guys Jim browning,Perogi, and Mark Rober were to play a game of DnD thier alignment would be True Chaotic good
I ❤❤❤❤ Vivian ❤❤❤❤
why not show her face though?
awesome buddy
Pierogi?
Do you have a specific experience that got you started in this? Keep fighting that good fight🤘
Send him 50k in monopoly money instead hehehehhehehehehehe or game of life money
There's a special place in hell for scammers.
I can’t believe how many people don’t run out of the room at the countdown.
I was trying to read that LP so I could try n track it. I live right down the road from Pearland lmao
Thank you for fighting for us. I was a victim of a scam and I did lose all my saving 3 years ago. Although this isn't justice to my misery, but nonetheless it is emotionally sothing. Thank you.
Dude!!! Awesome job!!! Thank you so much for protecting our seniors. I don’t have the tech skills you have but I keep these guys on the phone as long as possible.
I thought she was honna be some indian guy. How is she connected to phone guy
Where’s scammer version of dexter gone??
Is publisher clearinghouse one of there scams,my mother has been targeted with these types of scams,IRS,and some others. She's being hammered with calls from theses guys.they gotten close to getting her. She gets so stressed out.
I keep getting robo calls about fraudulent credit card activity. They always come between 6am and 8am about every 3 days.   "...on your Visa or MasterCard...".   "The first one is a $400 charge through ebay and the second is $1400 through gift card services." -or western union...  Here's the thing... I don't have a credit card. My husband does but it's not one of those. Also, we don't buy anything online with it. If I want something, I use a reloadable or prepaid card. My mom gets the same calls but at different times, days and for different amounts and place charged to.
Strong Disrupt vibes coming from the intro. Great job!
🤙🏼
Great video, you do great work. Wish I saw more of the Mark Rober collab though
Yeesh. that Vivian Rodgers isn't exactly a looker is she?
Hahahaha Pirogi channeling his inner old lady by dying his hair blue !!!!!!!!!!!!
So rad dudes !!!
I guess 481 scammers watch this video and gave it a thumbs down. To all the scammers you will never excape your conscious or God.
DoublaDoublaDoubla dot 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I wish i could get intouch somehow with you guys. Im going thru something similar on a consumer level. Good thing im a techie guy. Get in touch with me if you all can. Lets make a good alert video or something out of this to help people.
Leaving this comment for more engagement. Everyone needs to see this video!
Why the f would you blur the face?! What’s even point of watching this video?
Thank you man.
Everyday hero
Pierogi, I think what you are doing is so wonderful. I was scammed, partially; because I figured out what they were doing and I didn't fall for the entire scam.  I do wonder if they have a way to access my computer still but I did unplug it for about 6 months after this happened to me.  Keep up the good work sir! You are a great person.
Go get a napkin 😂
I have a suggestion! When you delete the files from the scammer's computer you should also copy few viruses to the computer's Startup folder. I think this would be the best payback that they can get for scamming innocent people.
All the down votes are from the scammers lol
Id be ok if we sent we peices of shit bombs..
479 scammers give you a thumbs down. Keep up the good fight!
I just cant wrap my head around the fact that people actually would package money that way and don't think for a second that its weird and something is wrong.
the time that went into this shows the effort and passion you bring to this channel. Also it felt so good watching the cops roll up on her and her have glitter all over still lol. Keep up the great work and content!
Ooh, the countdown was deliciously evil! I bet they were soiling their pants!
Shared it. Keep up the good fight man. The world needs more ppl like you.
Thank you all for the work you do👍❤️
I will not cry 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Not only a love for you, but for you, jim and mark. We, the community, just a community. You guys really help us to see these kind of stuff which needs to be stop. We thank you for doing this passionately. We, the community, will not be here without you guys and please don't stop fighting for us. We love you, guys.
You were really feeling yourself as Vivian.  I feel like Mrs. Doubtfire was more than just a family comedy to some guys.
Noble work. Thank you
A scam is an existing treat to a naive folk. Nonetheless, I believe that what is shown in the video is staged. What is the point of blurring up the perpetrator's face?
Click bait...
I just dont answer
You guys are super heroes!
It's not "real scammer" but only a mule. Like yeah, it's awesome anyway but it's also kinda clickbait
Thank you man. You made me cry
Hey Pierogi, whether you read this or not, I hope you do because I need you to know....I've legit got insomnia which should be fixed in due time, and currently have been going through a lot of mental health issues because of family and a certain special..special girl and just..much more...I watch these when I can't sleep and somehow with the amazing good intent in your heart, which reminds me of myself, to do these, the comedy of you f**king with these absolute soulless idiots, and everything in between, you bring so much joy and laughter and dopamine to my brain and heart. You do so much more for people than just savin-..well not JUST, rather... you do much more than making GREAT content, saving thousands of dollars wrongfully scammed, and bring justice to those who deserve it. You're also a great influence that gets tied in with comedy, to millions of people and I know I'm not the only one who feels this way. Thank you so much..In part, you save people not just their money, as crazy as that sounds. Never ever stop. p.s. ur voice is like soothing lmfao
That was so awesome and I feel I'm a victim but not in this manner but one of those become a millionaire in a short time from your home and been noticing not alot but little amounts being taken out here and there so I'm getting a new card and having everything reverse charged so we will see how that goes if it don't work I'd love to pay you to get to the bottoms of it .I just hate peaple who take advantage of the poor like me .but great vid and godbless and stay safe. And I just subscribed cause I love what your doing
Bro I am from India and yes this kind of call center exist here who scam people not only in USA but also in Europe and even in India as well. Nice initiative on ur behalf as it educates many people about how this scams operate
So badass great project you guys have going :D
sad the government should be paying you guys and they dont even want the free of charge evidence
Nice work dude!
Scammer Payback, Mark Rober, and Jim Browning. Y'all are like the goddamn Avengers of anti-scamming at this point.
I've noticed a large increase on Facebook with what I refer to as "Romeo" Scammers. Fake accounts, with photos of military men, saying they are looking for friends or more. And they are always brand new accounts, no one in common. They just want a minute of your time and then try to scam you. It is insane. Can't seem to get away from it anywhere. Thank you for tackling the phone calls.
double loo... double loo...  double loo... bahahhahahaha
Use Karl Rock to go after the scammers in India!
474 scammers disagree and give you a thumbs down... ha ha
I love you part 😄
Pennisdesk.com Lmao 😂
The opposite balinese fourthly strengthen because distance analytically wait modulo a quiet washer. mundane, lively pest
You guys are doing a great service
Good Job, thank you!!!
The ending was kinda anticlimactic... "what an incredible journey" sorry but u guys caught like 1 mule out of 10000 and shes just a pawn... Now ik mark rober and jim browning got some1 on the inside and r going to shut the whole operation down  But when 1 goes down 3 more pop up
if you want to come to India please tell me i can help  you :)
Great Work! It is why I subscribe.
You know what’s super sketchy... I started to watch your video and I had already watched Mark Robers side but then there was don’t ad. It was literally about downloading scam prevention things on your computer. I know I went download anything like that as I don’t know much about this stuff but what are your thoughts?
The absolute irony that I get a scam call while watching this video....
Poor Vivian Rodgers 🤣 I was dying at the nails coming off 👏🏽👏🏽 great work!
I thought Biden was gettin glitter bombed for a minute. 🧑‍🦯🎉
Keep on keeping’ on with fighting these filthy, disgusting thieves.  Your work is worthwhile.and the bonus is that you are hilarious while you’re doing it. Cheers to you! 😎
LMAO at him fake crying
you guys are fantastic keep up the good work
They could've at least made it a .exe not a .bat
My mother is living alone since my Dad died last year I have had to talk her out of going to buy gift cards 2xs I now have access to her bank but she gets 10-20 calls a day
Not all heroes wear capes. Keep up the good work--you, Mark and Jim are helping a great many people. Nice seeing you as your alter ego, Vivian!
Great job
Are you also able to catch cashapp/venmo scammers too? Been scammed of $765 from this a**hole & been trying to track him down since 2018 but no luck. Got his insta, fb & everything but no luck 😭
I try not to wish evil on anyone, but these folks deserve an exception.
I love u guys
Who falls for this bastards?
Killing it guys! Good luck an God speed.
India OMG, that would be so epic.    but what if they are just faking the accent.... hmmmm
You are awesome man. Keep it up!!!!!
Scammer:  Is there a problem officer? Officer:  Those are very shiny jeans and you smell incredible.
As of right now there are 466 down votes. Who in the hell would dislike this? Fuck you thieves and the people that support and profit from them.
This is awesome. Glad to (at least start to) see these people get what's coming to them.
That part where he sang congradulation😂
I used to work as a manager for one of the largest banks in the world. We saw the “western union” scam every day. Checks came in and the customer told us they were told to “send back half the check amount and they got to keep the other half ‘for their trouble’ “. Of course, we caught all of these in the center, but occasionally the customer used the ATM and when it hits the account, the customer was out ALL the money. And the worst part, they actually believe it’s real! No matter what we say, it was never enough to get them to understand. Sick world...
I subbed cause this is awesome
..those who dislike this video are scammers..😏
the real crime here is I can only give you one thumbs up
I support you 💯 , the scammers of India is not really what they say they are some small minded kids who are so hungry for money that they not even care that they are stealing money from a old lady which doesn't have anyone on his side to help , so sad man , peace ☮️
I got your point my friend
The fbi works to find a celebrity dog but can’t work to help Americans with this scourge?
Contact me anytime for any help , from India , seriously 😂
Thank you 🙏!!!!
LIke I have commented on Jim's channel: you are a better person than I.. I have very little sympathy for people that fall for these scams.. Yes the scammers are POS.. But they wouldn't be getting anywhere if people would stop being willfully ignorant..
That was a women getting glittered
Pierogi in drag was priceless
e
was the fart spray with it too? because I saw it like spray her pants, and then she took it in the car, the cops was probably like she smells like shit lmao
New subscriber!  Love what you do.  Keep up the amazing work!!
Thank you for all that you do
Wow, never seen so many check marks in the comment section before! Shows how much we all agree on stopping this nonsense!
“461 India scammers have disliked this video”
So happy to see you guys got together and closed the loop with the police on this scammer.  Best video I've see all year!
Wish you were around when my father was alive!  It was scam of the week that Mom and I had to foil!  Oh, the number of calls we got!  Had one from a guy running a chicken coop!  I must have won 300 Mercedes, and $600+M in cash.  I just told them to deliver the car and the money, as by State law, I do not have to pay any fees to claim a prize.  And the latest, is whoever on a recorded line.  Don't ever say YES!  Never do anything or give info to a company that calls you!  If you do know the caller, and have business with them, OK!  Otherwise, HANG UP!
four horsemen of the apocalypse
Thank you for helping us rid the world of these awful people!
I wish I could like this video now than one time... "Smash the like button" so to say. Fantastic!
Hey dude. I like this style of video. Keep it up!
Caught Glitterhanded!.....make something with ink/dye EXPLOSION!
Anyone willingly joining and being part of scams like this and many others don't deserve to be free period no questions asked. Gettem all sooner or later I hope.
Good ole Pearland PD !!  Thanks for setting them up .
There needs to be a movie about this
Love The way you edit this video and hope you keep up good work like this!! 👍 :D have a class day all!
NO company would ask you to take money out of your bank and mail or wire it, you would be a FOOL, but I know it happens, so dont let that be YOU.
I live in germany and picked up a call in my grandmas holiday home, an indian voice telling me there was something wrong with the Windows PC, my granny never owned one so I hung up, but what got to me was knowing that somewhere else an elderly lady is gonna pick up the phone and be scammed out of thousands!  Share this and help make it stop ❤
u guys are the real heroes
This got has to be in 2021 rewind lol
This video shows that it's not just Indian men who are part of this scam. We also have Americans of various descent and gender proving bad people come in all races and gender. God Bless all the good folks out there.
<3
Their must be 456 scammers😆
Brilliant stuff. I've been watching you and rober and Jim browning for a while, and I have to say this is top notch collaboration.  Having said that... I feel like your new hair reminds me of Creed from the office when Ryan takes over and expresses his intent to "make the company more youthful."
Wonder what they would say if you said you were using Netsxape as your browser or better yet Q-Link or Compuserve. Lol
you 3 are the best colab
The cumbersome control secondly stare because muscle genetically rock as a cool nitrogen. productive, even excellent excited venezuelan
Alright this editing is too much, calm down on the storyblocks bro
Why blur these people's faces?
Lml me being me: “That don’t got shit to do with me” 😭 good luck with your job
Those ballot boxes would have uses all the glitter in USA
Keep up the good work.
u 3 should make a youtube channel together and save the world
THANK YOU!  Sure would be nice if the cops would HIRE you and actually prosecute these people.
Apparently 455 scammers disliked this video...
Thank you, it’s heartwarming to see somebody going out of his way to help others. Scammers does not have conscience.
Wait this happened in Pearland? That’s wild i live there nothing ever happens here
Do you accept scam email submissions?  Three of my users got one this weekend.  I don't want to clog up your comments.  Also, I will NEVER get tired of Vivian.
Keep up the awesome work! 💪
This is not about us, this is about you.  Your ego, your sense of worth, your sense of self righteousness.  You're just another internet vigilante.  Which is all fine.  Great work, great to see those scum bags being hit.  Just be honest and upfront will ya. This is all about you!
well done keep the good work up ,getting one back for the little person
SuBD BuD
I love how he got so desesperate!! Hahahha
yess pls come to india and stop these kind of crimes please!!
Me?
This made me laugh so much, it's nice to see one of them get what they deserve.
This is a prime example of “not all superheroes wear capes.” Thank you for everything you do! I will keep spreading awareness.
(Featuring Mark Rober('s Glitter Bomb))  Fixed the subtitle for you.
Thank you for protecting us boomers. Your a good guy.
All dislikes are from scsmmers
great work, I wish their punishment could be much worse, my dad was a former DEA special agent and as foreign born person he spoke with an accent. I found him one day having a conversation like this with someone on the phone when he was in his 70's and I almost freaked out. I made him put the call on mute and I started to stop him when he explained that he keeps them on the phone for hours and keeps messing up their instructions and making them repeat themselves. he was scamming them and said the more time he held them on the call, the less time they were scamming someone else. he would then turn over the names and addresses and phone numbers and his notes to the local PD. this was his retirement entertainment! he's passed now but I will never forget that. thanks for all your doing and please keep it up. be well.
Great stuff.
There needs to be a concerted international media campaign to highlight these scams OR those entities using telephone / media technology to change their processes.... why not revert to paper based bills etc ?
Bro Fyi All Indians aren't scammers
I wish someone would hunt these people down, mules, phone scammers, their bosses, everyone involved. And just start hunting them (you know what I mean), one by one until everyone in that criminal industry gets scared shitless and stops ripping off innocent old people. No authorities, just vigilante justice.
Should have been TNT..
You do good work thanks
Yall and are heroes man :) Keep bein epic
when tey tell me that i got 4000 dollars back instead of 400 and they will lose their job i would tell them shit i got 4k i'm rich bxtch and hang up
this squad can go anywhere from the depths of the ocean to another universe if there is one
But that wasn't sent to the scammers themselves, that was sent to the money mule. I want real revenge!
couldn`t you hand these scammers over to the FBI?
keep up the good work
What amazes me - is YOU can do this, yet the police/FBI/CIA/every other alphabet organization can't do it?  It just goes to show that they aren't even trying to stop it.  Thank you for what you are doing on this!  Please keep doing it!
The fact that these great fellows are able to do this and Law Enforcement isn't is astounding. These guys are so good at what they do!! I am cheering with every video I watch. Weather it is Scammer Payback, Jim Browning, Kitboga, and others. They seem to being more to fight the scammers than government LEO's.  Just goes to show how inefficient government is.
Scammer: *sends actual money to proceed with the scam* Me: Kthxbye. *hangs up*
You forgot Microsoft the biggest company they spoof lol
I love it, how these Youtubers take action! Go get them!!!! Scamming gullible people, who still believe in good, into sending sums of money, which could be one's life's saving or two months of rent.... it is incredibly vicious. Wishing you all the best with this justice project - may the Karma be restored.
Nice video, but don't know why you blurred their face.
Well played gentlemen! GG
Someone should just say ''well you fucked up so I guess you're losing your job. If your company needs the money back they can get back to me, good bye good sir.''
SP please I beg you, go to the store or poor Steve will lose his job
With 1.3 billion people in India, why isn't there a single Indian channel busting scammers just like Jim Browning or Scammer Payback? Do Indian people really hate these scammers like they say they do?
Why do voice and face just don’t feel compatible by this person?
I think it would be really cool if you could teach other people out there (peeps like your viewers) how it is you do this or even employ a team of scam fighters someday. This is really cool and stuff like this is why I’m interested in the field of ethical hacking and coding. ^_^
Why blurr the face? Let the world see those faces! Good Job!
This number is active & claims to be the national crime agency LoL 🤣🤣🤣 let the boys & girls know ☺️they hung up as soon as I mentioned yours & jim brownings names ☺️ have fun ☺️😂🤣
pierogi is my spirit animal
This man is so dedicated he even loses his nails in the hard work he is doing.
Awww thank u so much and ur family u have been so much to so many and have saved so many from these scammers so thank u 🙏 we send so much love to u and ur family and friends for all u do I just want to say thank u
This needs even more visibility!
Those guys are a blot on the beautiful country of India. Come on India, let's unite to defeat them!
When you get personal info  and a location you should publicly shame them by mailing the info to a bunch of local addresses. Let the locals know what's going on there.
You need to start a program or class that teaches us how to help destroy the scammer menace, I’m sure there would be plenty of people willing to pay to learn some of your skills, even open your own counter call centre
why not just block all incoming calls .
Plot twist: Pierogi was the scammer all along
Crying Stephen was hilarious.
Keep up the good work
needs more cowbell!
polskie pierogi  xD
finally police did something
Everybody in India hates these guys too
They making you type on a notepad😂 and they spelling words wrong
hahahahahahhaha nice vivian
The psychotic beautician unsurprisingly vanish because hip extraorally allow vice a future futuristic visitor. picayune, squealing beauty
Indian here, we are ashamed that what these guys are doing, and should be punished, they are drowning india's reputation just like that, the land was know for Mahatma Gandhi  going forward will be known for something else, best of luck guys
Seriously, its amazing soo many people fall for this. No reputable company would ever ask you to send money this way or talk to people how the scammers do. Stay in touch with susceptible people and make sure they can contact you if they feel something is fishy going on
You and Mark, incredible.           Wait what Jim?! Lesgooo
Hi, I'm a new subscriber.  After just watching one video, now I'm binge-watching your videos. Please don't stop making videos like this one and make those scammers paid for what they are doing. Especially for those poor elderly.
A big fan from India ❤️.
Naw dude thank you. Thank all of you for helping save innocent victims 🙏🏼
This is what YouTube was really for.
Dude.  KEEP IT UP!  Thank you for fighting for the right reasons!  Keep doing the right thing my dude.  Blessings!
❤
you make a pretty vivian 🤣🤣 It's horrible how so many do get scammed, the ways the scammers do it just looks so fake but these poor old people who do not understand tech, some cant even work a cell phone well. Some old people are just too nice and gullable. I share with as many as I can when I can.
You are amazing along with guys like kit boga and trilogy you are a growing army and I'm sure you have your picture in a bunch of scammers offices that's the effect you have made on their efforts
I really wish more of us could join todo more
Thanks I appreciated the video keep breaking them don't stop.
Thank you all for everything you do to put an end to the greed of tech savvy folks scamming the vulnerable!
Y’all need to add an ear splitting alarm in the glitter bomb
What happen to the scammer women? did she get arrested?
You are amazing you have educated thousands and helped so many. Something you started for fun has grown into a amazing service you are providing.  Love you bro
Just go to India and buy start smashing shit in a scam call center
Teach me
Theyr soo pushy and demanding in their tone. I love how u make them frustrated 😆
Holly shit if he doesn't do drag then he definitely should
But that wasn’t the scammer, that was just the mule
If there was no glitter in the glitter bomb would that be too far? 🤔😅
I get this all the time and it’s funny because they call me over and over again even though my phone doesn’t have any money or information on it for them to steal
Thank you for continually performing this tedious and important work that you do. I’m sure it’s quite time consuming and chaotic. These scammers are the lowest form of humanity and have absolutely no problem taking the hard earned money and the financial lifelines of people that are extremely vulnerable. Cheers snd keep up the amazing work.
I recently found your channel and I've watched a bunch of your videos, but this one is the best ever! I hope you keep doing this, you're awesome!
I had a huge crush on Vivian Rogers sultry voice all these years, bit dayum, she’s so hawt on video!
Replace the glitter with nails and the fart spray with ammonia and bleach.
awesome job keep at em its to bad they cant go after some government officials and then you might see some change
What Voice changer do you have please tell me
i love how they use generic american names, something someone outside of america will come up with when writing a novel featuring a white guy
4:57 I was hoping for Congratulation song from PewDiePie xD
Keep up the excellent work!
I keep getting a text that says I have $100 Amazon bonus credit ready to use if I click on a link. Is this a scam?
Scammer Payback god bless you brother
THANK YOU , Rob, and Jim. For all you are doing to catch these guys. Now if the phone company could just do something to keep these SCAMMERS from calling my house 20 times a day that would be GREAT 😁👍  Do you have any tips on how to get these people to quit calling my house? That would greatly appreciated.☺️
Thank you!! Great content! Great work! Oh and Dutch Brothers!!!! Great choice!! Have you had there hot chocolate? Everything there is just so great!! But the hot chocolate is amazing. You know they produce their own chocolate milk? Okay ill stop, well done!
You two should team up with Mr. Beast to catch scammers and give money back to more victims like Susan!
Vivian is a dime bruh bout to leave my girl
Great many of my friends have been scammed out of hundredz and thousands of dollars.
You are an absolute legend mate.  Stay frosty, keep doing what you do.
You rock!  Thanks for fighting back!
Anyone who dislikes this video is a scammer.
400 dislikes.  That must be 400 of the scammers who he caught.
Thank you!
These scammers are the worst criminals,  they prey on any age group, those that are helpless, lonely,.. These crimes need to have a higher priority ,with laws that make it easier to track  and arrest them
I'll go to india with you perogi.
The educational aspect of the video is totally world class and a huge service to online users around the world. I commend you all for this.
Thank YOU!!
Oh yay, I've been waiting for your video!
I’m not sure what recently happened but suddenly I get near daily texts as well as calls from obvious scammers doing this whole refund scam. I am on the no call list but somehow they thwart it.
Thank you.
If you show up as a old lady named Vivian in India and walk into the scam center that would be the most epic YouTube video ever. Thank you for your hard work. These guys would be getting away Scott free if it was not for the big 3🙏🙏
Remember, if no one enforces a law, it's not 'really' illegal.      Fundamentally, a law is a rule that is enforced by a governing party, without it being enforced, it's just a line in a book.      We need more people stopping these scammers,. like legally, with governing bodies.      No citizen should have to count on vigilantes to enforce and protect justice, the only exception is if the governing body endorses said breach of justice. *cough* China *cough*
We need more like to scam the scamers to hack them all the way even if can video them from their pc to show the world who are they
Keep it up. glitter bomb the whole bloody lot of them.
Remote desktop softwares have to bear some responsibility for allowing scammers to get on their platforms.
So awesome. So sexy.
If you ever go to india, in your place I'd be kinda scared they make an attempt on my life ...
Owned lole
Superheroes don’t exi...
That was awesome ...Well done .....Great to see someone in this world anit out to rip anyone else off and just to try and help stop the scammers ..... a very HUGE Thumbs up
I've watched all 3 of your videos. Fantastic work!
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!!!! You are amazing 🤗🤗🤗
Your intentions (to be famous, to get narcissistic support) are in the wrong place but I like the actions.
Uhh... Not sure how you think there will be any justice... They aren't going to be found guilty because there's not enough information to pin this on anyone, and I'm 100% sure none of you guys would bother going to court in another state to testify anyways. So it's a nice viral video, but that's really all this is. Don't pretend like this is some major win against the scammers. This was a minor inconvenience to them at BEST and that clearly wasn't the person running the scam, anyways.  I enjoy the video, but please don't pretend that this was in any way a win.
The scammers think it's LESS conspicuous to send a bunch of tinfoil-wrapped bricks of cash than just a box full of paper money? Not the smartest people. As if we needed more evidence.
Thanks !
I am so super proud of you men...what a touching thank you from someone that we should all be thanking!  You need to start a company, hire more people and take all these jerks down.  What a satisfying job that would be.  You're one of the good ones.  Jenny Jurek
Scamming scammers is the best hobby in the world.
The hero we didn't know we needed
Awesome.  Fuck those scammers.
If you guys ever want to send more than glitter I have a pet pig willing to donate some uh material for the cause lol
Thank you for all you do. Not only are these videos informative but, they are fun.   You, Mark, and Jim are doing God's work in putting these a-hole scammers on notice.
Anyone being scammed by a michael w smith vip club. There trying to get my wife to give them money.
My grandmother almost got taken in by a phone scam back in 1998 or 99.  She was living on Social Security and they did their best to get every bit of money she had left in her savings.  The worst part was that it involved me.  They called her and told her that they were me, and that I had been arrested in Canada.  Her hearing wasn't great, so it wasn't hard to trick her into believing that she was talking to her grandson.  I needed her to send $2500 so I could get out of jail, please, please don't tell my parents.  She went as far as to prepare the Western Union payment (to a location in Ontario somewhere, so no, not all Canadians are nice...), then decided to get my number from my parents and double check (I was in college at the time, before cell phones were really a thing, and she didn't have my school number).  So I got a very confusing call from her and luckily was able to let her know that it wasn't me and please don't send the money.  I also told her about sending money by Western Union in general (i.e. don't ever do it unless you know exactly what you're doing).    I've never been so mad in my life - if I had had a way to find them in Ontario I suspect that my brother and I would have taken a field trip to increase their violent crime rate a bit.
I LOVE THIS YES
Remove the phone casings and keep the camera making way more room for either glue or added glitter.
Keep up the good work. Get more of these scammers.
You should start a Patreon for this
LOL @424 Dislikes, those are the scammers which are now mad about this.
I have been watching so many of your videos and I truly cannot wait until the first when I can help somebody because, I cannot get over the video of you having negative money and them still doing it. Please please people if you don’t recognize the number or if it says probably scam please don’t answer it! If it’s important they will leave a message, that’s what I’ve done please and thank you because I am honored to be able to watch this and to help others and to share, I don’t think I’ll ever understand how people can do this! I just think God for everything y’all are doing to help! For someone to Scam an older person is just disgusting and despicable...
How can I prevent them from doing it to my family?
Is that really Jim Browning's body?  Wow
Need to slip a root level virus into the scammer's network that spams the GPS of the network controller to the FBI cyber-crime division (to my knowledge the network controller cannot hide behind a VPN since it's on the data path?). Then cruise missiles should be launched at those locations.
Great work by everyone. Love watching all you videos.
Well done mate fantastic job 👏🏾
So were the perps arrested and prosecuted?
It's fantastic the way you get those a-holes back! I had gotten a "dating site" contact me. He looked like a model. (It was a photo of a real model) but that was not the person that was texting me.  I caught on quick.  They sent me 2 (fake) money orders.  Then told me to cash them, I keep X amount of money and send them the balance.  I brought the fake money orders to my local state police department.  They finished it from there!  More people need to not give out there information.  Beware of the scammers.
Thanks to Mark, I found you today. Lol
If you go to India to track scammers down, you should replace the glitter with napalm.
For another scammer packback, you should just replay what ever they say.
Now we just need kitboga to be thrown in the mix and we will have the refund scammer avengers
Jokes on the scammer, my Gran too racist to talk to foreigners on the phone so no scamming her 🙃
You’re doing Gods work. Keep it up!
Vivian Rogers do be lookin' fresh doe.
your hair blue
Well done. Hope to see more of these
Thank you for your efforts! I’ve had close elderly family get scammed.
You actually dressed as Vivian Rogers! Amazing! Hopefully this is the first of many arrests. Brilliant stuff
Pirogues? Sour cream and Onions in butter 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 great videos.
You are doing good work, young man. Keep fighting the good fight.
Thanks P  and  Co
You  just  caught a  mule. Pity  it   didnt  get to india
You are hilarious! I love watching these types of channels. I’m not sure if you’ve done this or not or even if it’s illegal, but it would be funny to call the scammers to fix your virus on the computer and then have the computer give the virus to the scammer... you could say it was a contagious virus.😂
You are doing a very good job my friend, but please be aware of maybe some will take a revenge.
You guys make it seem like their hacking into their computer lol....no they get you to install a application that allows them to control your computer.
But marijuana is a crime in some states. But this isn’t illegal
Dogdamn, this is the best collab on Youtube.
Keep it up! I hope you guys keep going and get more of the these scammers!
Wow “Steven” is a terrible actor.
Thank you!
These scammers are so pathetic. If they put this much effort in something else they would be good
Awesome!!!  Keep up the great work!
Boomers are so gullible.
Dude this is EPIC 😎
SO glad to see that you're working with Mark and Jim..   I'm HUGE fans of all of you..  Keep up the great work!!
I wonder how much the scammer that calls actually makes though? Are they actually just trying to support their families?
Love your videos  Keep it up
Who else is here because of Mark rober
You are more than just a "guy" brother. You are the man.
😳 It'd be cool if a new work industry started from this. Lots of potential.
Only if the old people saw this stuff from a different perspective
What can I do to get into this and be like you? Where would you suggest starting?
I’m standing up clapping.  The momma in me....so proud of you.  Absolutely incredible.
That's frigging awesome!
"mom, please.."
Someone needs to buy ad time during the superbowl or something explaining this shit to the masses
Please tell your older relatives that an incoming phone call from India is to be treated as extremely suspicious.
The scammers in India need to be doxxed to their parents and entire families so they have to live with the shame of being thieves. Most tell their families they do "technical support" for work, as they've told you and Jim Browning...  they pretend to have  a respectable job while stealing money from old ladies. Shameful!
Now if scammer payback could only find a way to stop the scamming government
You caught a mule not a scammer.
You guys are so smart! I love your videos and love watching the scammers get theirs. Keep it up.
410 scammers dislike this video
OMG that was incredible!  I wish you would have shown the face and I wish you would have told us a bit more about what happens to them.
Freakin awesome 👍😁
I found you and Mark via Jim... IT'S AMAZING to see you all collaborating together!  AND GETTING PAYBACK!  Watching Jim ACTUALLY helped me recognize the old Microsoft scam years ago, and didn't fall for it (I actually got cussed out by the scammer before being hung up on).  I'm ENTHUSIASTICALLY subscribing!  Can't wait to see what's next!  Meanwhile, I notice I have some catching up to do with your catalog!
It's always the indian
409 scammers give this a thumb down 😂
love the vids and awesome what you done on this!!!!!!!
good shit guys👍
This video is really well done. I know about these scams and actually used to scam bait in the good old days, but despite that I still find myself carefully listening to what you're saying almost as if I didn't know how it worked and you were explaining it to me 😂 that's how well put together this video is. it can convince the ones who know smth they don't know anything lmfao
408 scammer have watched this video at this time 408 down votes
Just saying, lipstick on point.
LOVE this!!!
I couldn't stop laughing over the crying scammer. That was too much. Plus, don't apply for drag race.
Manipulation on overdrive. But I’m trying to figure out why I would care that you’re going to lose your job. I don’t know you. Vivian is gorgeous!
You guys are Awesome!
Thank you for doing this because they won’t go away if there are no consequences.
Don't you have a code chip you have to use to get in to your online bank account in the US?
Thanks! Go get 'em! I almost got taken in, but the bank ladies saved me. They are my hero's!
The voiceless north korea arespectively level because cupboard multivariably enjoy beside a available text. cautious, giant russia
Salute you for your courtesy of bringing them for justice!!!!
May the YT algorithm push this further
While typing the amount, what if you enter a billion dollars. I am curious as to how the scammers will instruct you to mail a billion dollars
I'd say thanks very much for that 50,0000. Take me to civil court
If this is real, you rock!
You are an unsung hero bro!! Government and banks don’t seem to give a shit.
Good on ya! Keep fighting the good fight!
This is better than anything on TV.  Why isn't this a Netflix series?
not just 3 guys  you are 3 heros <3  ive followed mark through this entire jorny i will now follow you
you and jim are awesome. do not stop! this needs to be known by everyone! i bet you they do not just target the elderly, but the mentally handicapped as well! i am tired of scammers calling me... tired of blocking every number from them... just seeing this puts a smile on my face.
Thank You guys for all you're doing to help our great police! Also for giving us the satisfaction and laughs at seeing these heartless scammers brought to justice!
Notice to all old people.  If they sound like an Indian or someone from south America. HANG UP.  If they have bad phone quality and sketchy background noise. HANG UP.  If he sounds like he's from the middle east. CONTACT THE MILITARY FOR DRONE STRIKES.
To the 400 people that gave this a thumbs down.... I hope your next to get caught  and when your in prison I hope bad things happen
Go get em!! One day it could be our grandparents or parents drawn into these scams ........... appreciate you ALL
If someone calls you with an Indian accent. Red flag
I hate scammers. I wish I could help these guys get them. That being said, how stupid do you have to be to fall for this. I mean I can see someone falling for the phone stuff if they are older or not paying attention but when they ask you to wrap stuff in tin foil and bubble wrap and asking them to put random items in the box they deserve it. I mean cmon. Who asks for that? What company or government asks for that? What company or government asks for payment in gift cards? How stupid do you need to honestly be?
veb browser vary nice
398 scammers disliked this video! This is awesome.
Dextop, get it right.
I love your channel, but not you (in a weird way)
This must be the hundredth video I've seen in this genre and I still didn't realize fully how that scam works 🤦‍♂️. Nevertheless, good job!
WOW!  I was just watching for the fun and at the end saw that the police car was my local police!
You guys are awesome keep up the great work I’m subscribed to all of you guys love what you guys do what can we do to help???
I love you brother hell yeah! 💪🏼 Keep doing what you're doing bro ✌🏼🤙🏼
You guys have got some real balls. Fair play!
Can’t stand evil people. I want to say more but I’m too heated right now
Thank you to everyone from the bottom of my heart.
I have a new favorite grandma
AWESOME JOB BROTHER!!!!
Your videos are excellent and very helpful, Keep up the great work and destroy these horrible people.
I used to go on the website freelance.com and there were a lot of attempts at scamming using teamviewer, they were asking to use my computer so they could upload their own work into the platform (the excuse was that their country was blocked) and that they would pay monthly to do so. I never followed through with any of it, had some laughs tho, but never figured out exactly what they're objective was. It's a bit different from these scams because they're no longer targetting old people but starting freelancers, so it might be interesting to check it out.  I'd love to see what you could find if you tried it out yourself.
I dont pay the people I'm really supposed to pay, so these scammers never had a chance with me lol. Send that shit to collections b!tch!
This makes my heart happy!
Thank you so much for doing this!
Keep it up.  If i can help in anyway please tell me.  Send me to India.  Ill be the eyes and ears for you.
It is really great ... I loved all the steps ... but how come that she stays around such a suspicious package and opens it to get glittered? Maybe I read too much about the Unbomer ... and lately even Cesar Sayoc and other serial mailers!  Even now in our weekly rag we can read about people, often elderly, who give up all their banking, social security, etc. Informaon to incoming phone calls hooing for some modest refund then they are surprised that their money is taken from their bank accounts.
Whats that? A tactical strike.  Ok if you say so.
I keep receiving priority checks for a couple thousand dollars a piece telling me to cash them and use the money for secret shopping.  I know have a stack of checks because I keep telling them I didn't receive it.  Anyone want some checks for a couple thousand a piece.
*The scammers should have known* nobody has TeamViewer and RealPlayer on the same desktop.
Can you do a video on how to check your computer for these scammers? Everytime i call Microsoft it seems i get a foreign tech. I dont want to be racist or rude to them but i just dont trust them.
600k subs!!!!!!!!!!!
@scammer payback massive respect for what you did and accomplished
umm that Vivian Rogers looks a little suspicious herself
LOL,   " .......... I have to go to the potty ............."
best, vidio, ever
great job !!!!
I love you guys so much
Screw glitter bombs use c4
We coulda used one of those glitter bombs to prevent the presidential steal...
These scammers always hangup me, LOL. I'm not very nice, that shit works all the time.
These people should be killed after you catch them. They dont deserve anything else
Great work mate keep it going
I got a letter in the mail saying that my information was potentially accessed and gave me several pages of ways to “freeze” my social and “free my credit score”. It was on cheap paper not evenly cut in an unmarked envelope and was from a company called “Infinity Insurance Company”. It is a known scam. And I know they are on the rise right now. Do I give it to the police? Or is there somebody else I notify?
This just makes me feel like people with money are fucking stupid. They are the ones getting roped into this crap.
I was wondering why this scam has become so rare in my country, with banking they have either 2 factor authentication with a custom bank made device or with the banking app on the phone. Making the whole "save password to browser" set practically impossible. On top of that banking through the banking app is far more popular than through a site, and changing detail in a banking app is much hard than a site.  Granted we do have quite a lot of other scams that never seem to pop up in the US. The type we often have here is the "I changed my number, I need money" scam, where scammers claim to be a relative or friend in need that recently changed numbers. Or they try to get you to login on a fake banking site, and pass all that data, including the 2 factor, directly to a real login and buy shit with it or just straight up transfer it out. And texting people claiming they need to send an X amount to avoid tax issues. All except for the second have a pretty limited profit margin compared to US scams it seems.
You should do goldteethgod on Instagram. Please!!
Man, I LOVE this channel!!! ❤️ You're amazing!
My wife runs a Walgreens and gets older people coming in all the time wanting amazon, google play and steam cards for crazy amounts.  She denies the sale and has instructed her employees to do the same.  If they are still on the phone with the scammer my wife asks to speak to them and rips them apart and they usually hang.  I was like no way this crap happens but sure as shit she gets them almost daily.
I am sad that this is what India is getting labelled because of some m'fuggin bastards but I cannot defend after all the proofs presented. It just hurts to be called a scam nation. We working class tax paying individuals and families will have to bear the shame because of these low life crooks.
So did she get arrested or did they just let her go or what??? Is she awaiting trial or what???
you guys are so amazing <3
They are unstoppable
Love that you do this! Just found your page and I'm binging. When you're deleting their files how do they not see that on your screen and before you ever call them have you designed a whole fake bank website and login in page 🤔😒 you guys blow my mind! On the other hand I'm a REALTOR and just starting my YouTube channel..I'm clueless on editing. What software do you use to put these together? Or any you would recommend for a beginner?
One thing scammers want the most is a visa to America. You could actually SCAM THEM into giving you money to come to America by you filling for their immigration
I love this channel. So glad to see him get justice for people and mess with the scammers.
Does anyone else think this guy looks like Elon musk? 😂 Loving the video man, keep up the hard work 💪🏼
So, what do the police in India actually do?
You guys do great work. You're the internet's own version of the Avengers. If I can make just one suggestion, it's to lower the volume of some of the background music and sound effects a bit, particularly the ones early on in the video, which seem a bit louder than the rest. I have hearing problems (including a pretty heavy case of tinnitus), and one of the side effects is that there's so much sound going through my brain that background music and sound effects that are kind of loud-ish can become straight up overpowering and drown out voices to me. Before I had these problems, I never realized this was a thing, but apparently it affects a lot of people who are hearing impaired. It's just a minor thing for your consideration, it may help some folks out there. :)  Please keep up the great work. I often share your videos (and Jim and Mark's, whenever he covers porch pirates etc) with my mom and aunt, who are both elderly and active on the internet, so they know how scammers work. So much respect for all three of you.
We love ya
You guys are rock star’s! I appreciate everything you guys do.  There’s a fansonly scam going around. I wish you guys would look into them! Keep the awesome work coming!
Shame our government does nothing about scammers. They pray on our elderly. I guess someone of importance mother gets taken for all her money before our government does something about this
From Philippines, Kudos to all of you! You guys are the REAL HERO!
I had 2 spam emails last week offering me a "job" to receive parcels at home and make up to £3k (about US$4k) per month - I think I scared them  off by asking some pertinent questions about their "company" and what the "job" actually entailed.
Would love to see you go to India and nail these scammers! You're a modern day high-tech hero! Keep up the great work! We love your channel and we love what you do to help people! Thank you!
Brilliant
Hi, I appreciate the work you do, I’m Nigerian and a lawyer . If you need any help down here especially those love scammers, then we can form a team to help bring scammers to justice. There are government institutions that can support this cause. Nice one. 👏🏼👏🏼
This is brilliant
Why don't you just install wannacry in these scammers computers? It would be more destructive to the whole organization.
Viviane needs to go on drag race
Sry,Dont feel sorry for people who get scammed!!! F the scammers though, pos!!!
I need a tutorial to achieve that deep blue hair.
As much as I love the job you guys are doing, please don't think that all Indians are scammers. A humble request from an admirer of your work from India.
What would make a very interesting video, would be to get someone from India who also talks fluent Hindi, to take the call and talk to them, just to see if these scammers would also scam a fellow countryman.
What’s with dressing like a woman and the blue hair,  it’s very odd dude... I really liked this channel but that’s it for me now.
"This is unbecoming of you!" XD so much hidden in that quote there Vivian! Great job Pierogi!
Oh Vivian, i think you`ll need to ramp up your H.R.T. as i`m afraid to tell you, you have a 5`oclock shadow.
Well done guys..👍👍  Hair?? Have you dyed it 🤔
Scammer Payback. I'm proud of you boys from a believer who lives on the other side of the world.... (New Zealand)
Thank you for the help you give these victims, I wish the world was a better place and you could spend your time on something else.
At 8:35. As we say in India. "50 rupaye kaat Overacting ke"
So did she get arrested?
I honestly can’t believe people fall for this. Awesome on the bomb.  The bomb arrived on Jan 6, 2021.....a very auspicious day !
I just subscribed to your channel amd I love your videos and I love what you are doing to help save people from these scammers. Thank you for what you're doing and I can't wait to see more future videos from you <3
This guy is a national treasure. 🙌❤️
Good video. Don't go to India bro. Stay safe 😑
What, why the aluminum foil? It's totally transparent to x-ray.
:)
do you ever go after the calls about the credit card debt when they ask for credit card number right off the bat?
You’re awesome, man!
Wow. A big WOW.
Mark & Jim sent me here, hi !!  this is the trio that needs a 5 digit salary at least for this kind of sweeeet sweet justice
Go to India someday, serious.  My recommendation is to fly into New Delhi, and do the Golden Triangle. I think you will learn a lot about India throughout the entire trip.  This is a small part of the population destroying the image.  India has a lot of poverty, India has a lot of phenomenal beauty.  India filled with engineers that are benefiting US companies day after day. Please try to stay balanced in what you say, because just like criminals in our country, it's an element. An element that needs to be policed and tracked it down. Just like you are doing. Thanks for your hard work… But I do encourage you to go to India.  I realize you probably won't take my comments seriously because of all of the other comments that you get, but think about it… If you get the chance.
Can pierogi do a show that has real programs that we can use for our elderly parents to protect them from online fraud? Like say we have an elderly parent with some dementia that still uses the computer. You know how they have programs to keep kids off certain sites? Well is there anything to protect our elderly parents?
My sister did something she had done in her real estate business and was scammed out of a couple thousand. She was able to trace it to Portland, but the police couldn’t do anything about it... it must have been the mule... it is SO infuriating!!
Yo just an fyi @scammerpayback.  “Delete their* files” not there.  There implies a location.  Their implies ownership.  So your hat should say “delete their files”.  Keep up the good work bud.  Thanks for the entertainment.
Fuck ya dude! Great video!!!
You should build up a group of people that live in India to help bust the scammers.  No clue how just a random idea.  Anyways, you do great work and make entertaining videos.
im going to india next monday can i help any way ?
take some former military. maybe one who had a family member that was scammed...
*I really wish scam baiters would expand into other areas innocent people are scammed daily like on CL* . There are a lot of scammers posting on CL, especially the housing/apartment sections. Right now, there are hundreds of posts with $750 rents, and g mail addressed in the posts for people to respond. When you respond, the crooks/bad actors tell you they moved to a different state from the state they apartment is located in and that you need to send them the rental deposit via a cash app, Zelle, Chime, etc and they will "Fedex you the keys and lease documents."  There's nothing more desperate than finding housing for many people and they will fall victim to this.  I've been playing with a few of them but I don't think I have the resources or skills to really track them down or get their personal information to forward to local law enforcement.  Please consider it!
amazing
Payback Superbowl 😆
AWESOME!!!!
The real avengers
I love you. I love you too.😃
You are amazing, we got your back bro! You three guys are just amazing! We will share this as much as we can, to bring awareness among the innocence and support in this work together! 🙏
Thank you so much!!
Honestly, why haven't you, jim, karl and others joined up to make a TV show yet?
These scammers are outright disgusting. I am happy you guys are doing something, they deserve a lot worse than a glitter bomb.
Vivian is a GEM. A QUEEN I tell you
Luv ya dude....but I gotta ask it...What kind of MAN colors his hair purple or blue?  Are you a modern male feminist?  You gotta be at least 30 years old (or at least pushing 30) *Edit- Nevermind...You gotta be in your mid 30s
aye man you deserve all the support you do so much bro keep at it man.
The dislikes must all be people in the scam family.
You are hero
I've missed a few episodes. Why is your hair blue? 🤔🤨
Is it mark the Irish guy! He is a diamond, as are you guys. 🇦🇺🤗
please bring this Glitterbomb in Malaysia. a lot of scammer here nowadays
You are so awesome, keep up the great work, there should be more people like you in the world, God bless you
I have to laugh at your "name." Pierogi  I'm Lithuanian. I should call myself koldunai☺️
What this guy study?
This is the Holy Trinity but I still want Kitboga to join them.
How all does a virtual machine work?
Now we just need Mr. Beast to be apart of this and walk up out of no where and ask the scammers how they feel
377 scammers don’t like this video
how not to get scammed: hang up if an indian answers
Maybe Pierogi or anyone can answer this:  If these scammers call up someone without a pc, are they out of luck?   As I'm sure in the near future or even currently, they will change up the 'script' to cell phones as well.   As everyone has a cell phone but many folks don't have a pc.   As once scammers start baiting using cell phones and remote access, then the baiting will occur alot more.   Anyway, superb job Peorogi 👍
you make me cry with gratitude!!!!!!!
I have a general rule of thumb with these guys. If it's an automated voice hang up instantly. If it's a person claiming to be microsoft I say I have an apple.. or I don't own a computer. if it's the rest I give them a fake name and I don't have a bank account I only carry cash.
man you a scream........awesome!
It is so sad that there are people that are gullible that red flags don't come up when they are told to send money and do all that stuff before shiping it.
Every century new kind of heroes are born.
Well done Brother.... perhaps you can focus on some of the Crypto bandits out there next... there is a bunch of fraud in that realm as well... I truly admire would work..
Got um!!!
Is there anything the anydesk developers can do about this? It seems like their app is used in most of these scams
You are a good man, keep fighting the good fight !
372 Scammers not 👍 this video 😂
Excellent video, Great stuff and keep up the good work. I watches and enjoyed many of your videos, Your Blue hair is now very distracting to me... just saying. Thumbs up,,, except for the hair
4:49 who tf falls for that in Notepad!!
What a video!!! Love to see it 😂
Thank you for chasing these mongrels.
Fantastic work! You are amazing Scammer payback 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻❤️❤️❤️
I always love fucking with scammers who call me... especially now they get so ballsy to call my gf who doesn't own the car(both are in my name cause i have loans on them and my credit rating is better) is getting calls for car stuff and i answer for her to fuck with them.
LOL Thank Y’all!
As of right now 371 people that downvoted this video should be looked into. May be scammers
Can you help me please, I got their info and messages and everything
Hey man , im getting scammed r8ght now by a Pet seller ,
I'm guessing that all the thumbs downs are from the scammers in India and South Africa. 😜
Thank you!!!!!! Love these
I get so many calls and emails from scammers I think my name is posted on every lamppost in Pakistan.
Other Country : Learned English To find a job India : Learned English To scam people
Scammer payback you’re welcome and I also happen to be a victim of many scammers even my YouTube channel has scammers on it. I thank you for more advice. This also makes me a feel lot better knowing something can be done for now.  For me Estimated year 2045 to help reduce down on the scammers without them seeing it coming as well. Using special Unknown Technology. After that I would have other jobs to do estimated year 2050. All this could be before or after it depends on how busy I am year 2043 and beyond
Commenting to make the yt algorithm like the video more so more people become aware of these scams
Evidently there are 367 scammers that don't like this video!  Get em boys!
You guys are great! and Vivian is quite comely LOL!
This is truly super hero stuff happening right before our eyes
The scammer crying sounds like a cow mooing
This is amazing, keep doing glitter bombs and make sure these scammers are arrested. We need to destroy their system and let it fall on itself like a domino, I believe u, Jim browning, Karl rocks, and many other Scam Stopping YouTubers can do this. Love to see this
Way to go gentlemen. I have been telling my husband for months that these were scam phone calls.  Just him watching one of your videos and he now knows I was correct and he ignores the calls. Thank you. God bless.
Also can u explain the haveing the shirt wig and lipstick.  On hand  cause honestly if you do the whole outfit each time then I'm extra impressed by your greatness.
You 3 and the teams you have all deserve nobel pice prizes.    It genius the way that one  fart glitter bomb catches the muel and hitting the supervisor hurts the scammers more then the actual muel    .   I hope you all get  these evil soulless b*&/@÷#s and I just hope in future can start to firing of some types of white hat virus and worms etc to shut these places down.
Ive always wanted to have the knowledge to get back on scammers but 😂 Do malaysia ! We have a lot of them 😭
that's amazing thanks to you, Mark and Jim. because of people like you the world still a better place.
My father almost was a victim of the scammers. he ended up texting me asking questions.  told him to hang up and report the number.
Man, you and Mark are heroes! Using your skills to fight those fucking scammers is really inspiring.
We thank u
I love you guys and let me tell you to see you now working with Mark Rober makes this all the much better. Keep up the hard work on getting these scammers! Love you and all that you guys do!! ❤🧡💛💚💙💜❤🧡💛💚
Great video, thanks for sharing. Keep uploading these videos. Thank you for your hard work.
"Ok. I love you." 🤣
Elke nederlander bij de titel: Mark R… !!!!????  Na de titel: Kanker mark kanker rober
There’s a special place in hell for these people.   Thank you for teaming up with the other guys and bringing them down
Ive had someone calling me for last 3weeks saying that they from hmrc tax office in uk 🇬🇧 but its since in called up to  Invest in song stocks and shares with some advertisements that I seen on UTube  think it needs lookin at
Thank you guys. God bless you.
Somehow this person is claiming allegience to the “brilliant idiots” orange and blue maybe NY police affiliation but theyve alledged in only two videos i watched the following,1) that ive scammed 16,000 from bert howland 2) that ive scammed trish white out of $120,000 3) that ive scammed alice marrin out of $56,000... and that they somehow provide a payback service for the scams and finally that im a rapist and that they watched me jerk off on video and that theyre going to share videos as blackmail
They call me and I don’t answer. Once I was waiting for a call and got the going to be arrested scam. Hung up. I live in senior housing and I’ve warned others about these scams. How no legitimate company will ask for gift cards.
DO ONE WHERE YOU DELETE A SCAMMERS SYSTEM 32 PLEASE!!! :D
9:30 Best laugh I had this month
Peirogi you have the most beautiful eyes. They are like clear pools of jade.
Being an Indian, I really feel these scammers are a real shame. They should be just executed. No. I mean it. They should have the right to live but they don't deserve it. Even if they are caught they are as stubborn, stupid and cold hearted as they were earlier. They should just die.  No offense or any intent to hurt anybody's feelings but they are a real shame for the country.
Thank you for bringing light to this subject!
I bet the 355 people who disliked this are scammers them selfs
I really like your videos ——- it made me aware of how I have all most gotten scammed ——-I still am getting Amazon calls —- stating that charges have been made to my Amazon account
do such tools (to take over) exist for cell phones? my mother doesn't have computer.
That lady was arrested somewhere i drive past pretty frequently. So that's neat
Even better than this payback...I love that your name is Pierogi!! If there was one food I could live off for the rest of my life...it’s Pierogis!! Lol! Amazing name for an amazing person! Keep fighting!
Thank YOU!!!  You’re amazing! Crying Steven was hilarious! And I’m happy there was a tiny bit of justice in the end!
I want a part2 noooow!!!
Thank you sir. From my heart. It moves me so deeply your words and actions.
353 down votes when I watched this. Who are you? People who work in these call centres? This video shows people fighting back against scammers and 353 people think this is wrong? Amazing!
👍👍👍🤎🤎🤎
As opposed to a Fake Scammer??
“go to the store i will not cry”  no <3 ur tears bring me joy
Nice work.
You should never have to buy a beer again in your whole life..that's freaking awesome
Browsers shouldn't be allowed to remember bank information
Glad to see someone shed some light on how these scams work.  I've learned over the years not to answer my phone and delete any suspicious emails even though many look legit.  Sharing your video to my old fogie 'friends' on F/B.
Indian government needs to look after this.   .... Whenever I get calls from thick accent, I just hang up ....
Forget the farts....it sounds like her stolen package is self-aware Skynet and is about to destroy itself when she's opening it.
9:27 Ahh my eyes, they burn!
I love this. Thank you for all you do ❤️
Pierogi+Mark Rober+Jim Browning>>>> The Avengers
Best dual 👌🏼🙌👏keep going strong 💪🏼👏
Love Marc's peg that pops out and they cant put box back on. You are a champion SP!
What if that was just a middle man?! lmao
Almost exactly one year ago, my mom fell victim.  Luckily, my dad questioned things and called me.  I drove to them and ended up ripping all the cords off the wall and shutting down the laptop.  For the next week, we changed bank accounts, closed them, and prayed we got it taken care of in time - all during a pandemic when lobbies are closed.  To this day, she’s still very angry with me but my dad is grateful.  We have used every lie we can to prevent her from getting internet access.  The laptop is at my house and hasn’t been turned on since the incident.  We need suggestions on our options - Apple products, remote access locks, restrict website software.  We’ve looked into things which are used to monitor kids but I’m not sure if those would work in this situation.  Any advice?
350 scammers dislike this video
unfortunately this is just taking out a mule.  we need to put pressure on the governments of the countries scammers are hiding to take action and arrest those at the top.    That being said this is the first time I've seen anyone get this far up the scam chain and take out the mule.  I applaud your efforts.
Can we first say how pretty you are as a woman?  You may need to do Rupaul's Drag Race.  Second, your voice is so soothing.  Third, I am obsessed with your videos and I watch them WAY too much and they satisfy my vengeful spirit.
Thank you! You guys are the best
legend
Doubly doubly doubly dot
If u thumbs down this go play in traffic!
Amazing work! Keep it up you guys!
How to avoid being scammed: Indian accent on phone - Hang up.
Why does it say "pierogi" on the information hidding box hahahahaha
Teach me how to fight scammers please
I've watched some of your videos and what you do is awesome. It's too bad you couldn't give back the money to the people they stole it from. Or at least give it to charity. That would be great. Keep up the good work.
😂 😂 I love that Mark Rober's glitter bombs are making their way in to so many videos. He's so awesome!
You're right bro. You, Jim, and Mark should found an agency for this purpose. To protect the elderly and  people who are unaware and just don't know better. My grandparents fought in the Korean war and ww2. Times where much different for them and my grandma and grandpa personally were both horrible with computer and other devices. I feel fortunate that they were not a target but I have friends with family that this awful shit has happened to. So having an agency and not a company do this would be better. I know there are agencies against fraud already but we need to get awareness out there to the most vulnerable. It shouldn't be about the dollar signs. Many of our elders have worked hard and even fought and bled for our country and it's people of all creeds and colors. So next time people think, 'well I can't do anything to help",  volunteer at a local retirement community to teach and help these people come to terms with the ever changing future. Remember one day you will be in their shoes and the world outside will seem as if it's just passing you by. So please even a little help goes a long way.   Thanks for all you do, internet Batman.
Respect at you bud - stay safe 😎
They couldn’t scam me. I would say “you fucked up? Well... thank you for the money! Byyyye 🖐” 😂
I can't wait for you to get one of the scammers and not just the "mules". I watched this entire video on Mark's channel and it's to bad she was only a mule and not a scammer at the end of the very long chain of handoff's until it finally arrives at the scammers place!
0:34 ah yes, +7, the India dialing code. I guess +91 is Russian now? :D
Before I start NO I am in no way taking up for these people. With that being said I will not say certain things to identify these people as then it could be construed by some "woke" person saying I was being a certain way instead of just trying to shed light on a subject.  Sadly these "scammers" don't have allot of choices. The vast, vast majority of these scams all come from the same place or lets just say area instead. Well at this "place" they have one of the fastest growing GDP's in the world showing how prosperous their "area" is. The problem is this place is a Union of States. It is a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic with a parliamentary system of government with deep ties to communism as well. ... The Constitution provides for a Parliamentary form of government which is federal in structure with certain unitary features. but because of the mass of people/ Government in control of almost everything in the 1950s they followed socialist creed and the state seized control of steel, mining, machine tools, water, telecommunications, insurance, and electrical plants, among other industries. The government had seized the commanding heights of the economy. The government takes advantage of it's people and yet most of these people will disagree because they have been so brainwashed for so long that they really believe their government is doing everything in it's power to help.  Corruption, cronyism, nepotism, investment and divestment based on patronage and not profit. These are what have kept this "area" down. They are the hallmark of socialist states everywhere that rely on perceptions of fairness and commitment to the cause, rather than the output that is achieved. It is evidenced, as Professor Ramesh Thakur puts is, by the fact that it is “easier for a person of this "area" to reach high public office in Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom and the U.S” than in the "area" he was from. If you’re from this "area" but living in the UK you are far more likely to succeed in exams, far more likely to go to university, and far more highly paid, than the rest of the population.   A typical middle classed family in this "area" makes about $1.20 USD a day while the government and crooked politician's become rich. So allot of these "people" don't have a choice. There are no jobs so they take anything to just survive and to scam you they make next to nothing but they do make something I guess. Do you want a staggering little fact the majority don't know about because they don't want you to know how bad their people are in despair? Almost 70% of houses have no toilet. Yes you heard correctly as only the well off have them then their sewage just dumps straight into the rivers as do chemicals from textile plants with hardly no repercussion's. Around 80% of their water (their entire water sources) are highly polluted and claimed to be the case for just to many to even count of people with abnormally high amounts of people getting cancers/diseases  etc all due to the water. Around 80% of the "area's" water is severely polluted because people dump raw sewage, silt and garbage into the country's rivers and lakes, they even burn their dead right on the shore and after so long of a time of burning they kick the spire (the body was placed on) so everything goes into the river body and all. This has led to water being undrinkable and the population having to rely on illegal and expensive sources. Each year, more than 1.5 million children die from diarrhea from this "area". Most children are lucky to eat once a day there so FINALLY in the last 10 to 15 years the government started giving back a speck of money they have been extorting from their people and started to give all in school children a lunch so at least they get a for sure meal everyday smh. So kids go to school not to learn but just to eat.   So you see it's not so cut and dry. People are being taken advantage of on both sides and some of the people you talk to don't even know that they are scamming you. They think they are just doing a job. so what do you do? Of course stop them but they will still find any means to make money until the problem is solved. It's actually a very sad thing for these people and no one deserves this, no matter who we are color/race whatever were all still humans that sometimes need help.
Scammer payback i support everything you do i think these scammers should get in prison keep up the good work man i love your videos<3
Vivian Rogers - foxy lady!
The problem is, you're still not hitting the scammers. You're hitting the money mules with this. You all really need to work together and get a glitter bomb or something to a damn call center. Like a really big one.
Epic!!!
Why can't the cops take a lesson from you and be doing more of this too! GREAT JOB - Keep Up The Great Work - Burn Them Good!
You have a superhero name.. "DistruptaDude " saver of the universe,   messer of the Scammers...
I love the fact that you get them, and waste their time, which helps them NOT contacting others.
Glitter is nice, but a small IED is nicer. These people deserve nothing but the best high explosive to seperate them from their theiving limbs.
My 4 year old fake cries better than crying Steven lol
THANK YOU, guys!  God bless!  Keep going. We appreciate it.
Did that person get into any trouble? I really dont think it will stick if thwy did sorry bro.
The heroes we need.
The CRYING, I caaaaant 😂😂😂😂
I love your videos but that Vivian segment was horrifying 😜
Great job!
This was a great video. It makes me play with them on the phone with they call until they are mad and hang up on me. I never go as far as the computer but it’s so funny and all I think of is all the work you do. Thank you!
Love this! Keep fighting and we will keep on supporting and spreading the importance of this! ❤
You guys are the best.   Hate these peoples taking advantage of the weak.  Our government needs to be able to call block these scammers.   Thank you guys!
Good work!
There are a few scambaiters now who seem to be using this whole business as a way to disguse the fact that they are cross dressers. 😂🤣
This is just the beginning of the anti-scam Avengers
Thank you for all your hard work
Keep chasing !   endorsed from UK
Almost every one of these types of videos we are hearing India Indian accents.  We advise everyone that if they hear a voice on the other end of the line, which obviously comes from India, then just hang up.  You do not have to engage them unless you are as talented as the young man in this video. I basically just tell them to Fuque-Off and then slam the phone down.
OMG the effort. Thanks for the awareness.
Vivian’s a GD cougar, and she better watch out 😎👀💋
Takes a real piece of shit to be a scammer, I don't understand how people fall for these scams but I still feel bad for them, especially if they're elderly.
These are the only people I would be okay with actually encouraging doxxing.  If they are stealing millions of dollars, the least we could do is get their address and start promoting it like hell on social media as a terrorist recruitment center of Hindi Nationalists.
You are absolutely right about law enforcement not wanting to do anything about these scams going on before I started watching pierogi this happened to me and I lost my whole check to them but then I started watching pierogi and got smart and opened me a bank account because the government wanted nothing to do with finding the scam or doing something about it.
Shows how dumb these guys are. If I ever got a package that had a countdown, I would immediately toss it out the window or door.
I just can't understand what happened to making an honest living working,  these scammers would work as hard at a job is they do scamming people, they would be able to conquer their dreams. I'm on depression medicine because I am no longer able to work making an honest living.
Do you would make such an awesome actor on TV. It is so spectacular to watch you go from your serious mode talking to us telling us how the con or scam happens and then you instantly switch into old lady mode. It is just so awesome to watch you you are hilarious
I am on SSI disability and this has happened to me before until I began watching pierogies videos and it updated me to where now I messed with the scammers when they call me. The main one going around now is social security office supposedly calling you I know better because social security will never ask for your information over the phone like your debit card number or your bank account number or anything like that. Thank you so much pierogi!!!
He was being over dramatic 😂😂😂
Hey  Pierogi!!! I have been wondering why I have not received any new notifications from you on your videos. I decided to click on one of your videos and now I see why. The notification bell was off that means it's been like this for at least 3 months. Lol. Hope you're doing great now I have to go and see your new videos you've made over the past few months
Bro I was in New Dehli and my driver literally pointed out to me and showed me an office where all these guys sit.  You might not get the specific one bit you can get one.
Some serious "The Secret" vibes in the editing style of this video lol
You guys should team up with kitboga he has accesses to allot of scammer computers to
The disillusioned order algorithmically wipe because fold intralysosomally seal apropos a curly bangladesh. noisy, actually agenda
My dad got a scam call from Amazon saying he ordered a $350 item & they want to give him a refund. My dad is 85 years old & lucky he doesn't know how to use the computer to well. Fuck scammers!
This video isnt completely honest: 1. Not all IT Support Scammers ask for money to be sent in packaging. In fact, most are going to ask for Gift Card Codes. 2. Vast majority of these IT Scammer with Remote Access are incompetent. They know a couple Windows Commands and how to edit HTML. Of all the Scambiating Videos I've seen, the worst a Scammer will do is delete the Desktop Icons in order to scare the Victim. When confronted with real-world viruses by some Scambaiters, they're clueless. 3. The "Real Scammer" was a Mule. I doubt most of these Mules are even aware that they're working for Scammers. They're Middle Men. Vast majority of these Scammers are overseas, in countries their crimes are not being punished. Until India (where the vast majority of these Scams are occurring) decides to deal with this problem will actual justice occur (India Law Enforcement is corrupt and allows these IT Scams to occur; they're bribed).  This overly-peoduced video just exists to show a single Money Mule getting caught. Not that amazing.
u got me at the 3th seconds  ! LIKE !
Now after listening to these calls, I understood how  my dad who is a smart but trusting  guy got scammed
300 + dislikes from the scammers. . .
fking pierogi?
Pierogi, thank you  Also thank you to Jim, Mark, Trilogy Media and many more. You guys are fighting back against these scum and I am confident will ultimately bring about the demise of such activity.  Keep up your EXCELLENT work
You might want to flip that little switch at the base of your EV RE20 mic. It'll round off your words a little nicer. Baritones ftw.👍
Scammer:  -I need you to open your notepad-     Me:  Ok goody!  Pen and Paper!   This I can handle.  I thought you guys were all about them apps. Scammer:  -No! I NEED YOU TO OPEN THE NOTEPAD APP ON YOUR COMPUTER!- Me:  Ok I got my note pad open. Scammer:  -Ok good now I .. wait I thought you said you had notepad open?- Me:  Oh I do!  S: -NO YOU DON'T! Now I Need you to- M:  Oh yes I do.  I have my spiral note pad open to a clean sheet.  Don't worry I keep myself organized. S: -Oh really?  How do you have yourself so organized that you keep not opening notepad like I've asked you to?- M:  For your information mr. smarty pants I do have it open.   I have it handy in my old three ring Trapper Keeper.   I keep my spiral note pad in there along with my pen.  I also have a solar powered calculator in that doesn't even need the sun.  Those Trapper Keepers are really special.  I'd say you should get yourself one. S: -Really? why is that?- M:  Because you're so disorganized that you can't even see that I have my notepad open.  Although you really shouldn't because they don't make them anymore.   So I have to buy new ones off of Ebay.  I can't even get the folders for them anymore.  But I fixed that problem with my craftiness. S: (sigh)  -How did you do that?- M:  Well I took some of those old timey cheap 'nilla folders and a paper hole puncher, and I put three holes down that folded part.  I even made a template so I get those holes straight and evenly spaced every time now. S: -Good for you.  But I need you to do this on your computer so I can see what you are typing.- M:  Oh don't worry about that I'll just run my notes through the scanner and fax them to you. S:  -(click)-  Also I didn't even get any ads on this video?  Don't tell me Google demonitized this video.
Good job man! :)
I subbed a few hours ago.  Planned to go to sleep and catch some more of these later but I can't stop watching.  You and others like you are amazing people and deserve a TON of respect.
I've had a bit of an insight - none of those people that do those scams are above averagely mean or bad, or whatever you want to call that, evil - they all tell themselves a story, that they are only taking money from stupid people who have more than they need and won't miss whatever they are "giving" them, because if they did, they wouldn't part with the money so easily, right? Also, each of those involved only goes one step, so the guilt is distributed and it's a bit unclear to who really should take the blame - there's a guy that runs the call centre, there's a caller and there's a mule, so, at least 3 participants. Each can tell themselves that they are only playing a minor part and if they don't do it, someone else will, but if they do, they can make good money. This is probably how atrocities are committed.
This is like the real world avengers
You are right, the government doesn't care and never will. Until it is a politicians money taken or someone else in government, they do not care about the plebs. You three are super awesome, what we need is mass education on this. GL in future stings.
Coming from Jim Browning's video. Liking this video before starting watching
.BAT files.... feels like 1985.
As of right now 335 scammers failed to get your bank account info 🤣🤣🤣
My mate here in Australia has got caught up with one of these.. He's sent $11 000 US in cash so far and need's to send another $13 000 for this imaginary girl that is supposed to get $5.6 million put in his account once he's paid 'her' all the money.. Apparently 'her' government won't release 'her' inheritance without 'her' paying money... I've tried to tell him but he think's 'she' is real.. It's sad
Turned into a secret rare vmax Pokémon card!
BRO I REALY AM VERY HAPPY THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE YOU IN THE WORLD
I love what you do it's amazing!! Thank you🙏❤🙏❤🙏❤
If the wind blows just right...you can still hear Steven crying.
Have you guys tried catching the Indeed scammers? They text you after you have been looking for a job on indeed. The text claims to have seen your resume on Indeed and claim to offer jobs that are way over paid (data entry for $35 an hour ) they then do an "interview" via text and the Telegram app. I think this is really crappy because right now a lot are out of work due to the pandemic and trying to scam those with no income is just janky AF. It would be great if you all bring them to justice.
As an Indian, I would request you all to not look at us the same way and judge us. These scammers are literally less than 0.000002% of us and like everywhere else, cheaters exist.
These scammers definitely failed drama in school
Man you and Kitboga should collab next!!
Dobbelew dobblew dobbelew dodt
I want you to take their money out of their computer then use hindi or punjabi abusive words .
Trust me I'm from India here one person I know lost 93000 in one lost.   If you wanna know what hindi or punjabi abusive words you can use  on them let me know..   I love your channel ❤️
Omg come across you’re channel yesterday, absolutely love what you do and being a victim myself I can’t thank you enough for what you do. I now know how to deal with this scammers
It's so sad and feel so disgusted to watch this as an Indian. It's also very mature of you guys to not stereotype the whole country based on the behaviour of these rotten scammers, thank you. I think the change will only come at a multi-country diplomatic policy level which needs to be initiated say by the US. Call centres and BPOs are one of India's biggest service exports and only a tiny portion of it would be these rotten apples to justify a crackdown on the industry as whole. At the same time the police is underfunded, over worked and does not have Indian law to protect the rights of these foreign citizen victims to take proactive steps in these crimes; the victim is not an Indian citizen nor was the crime in Indian soil / jurisdiction. Thank you for the work you do and hope this brings attention to this shame and leads to some kind of a policy driven change to punish these bastards.
Thank you sir.
That was absolutely cool! Saw the Mark Rober videos and what a fantastic colab! I saved my dad from a potential scam of $20k last year. He was going to wire it the next day. I went with him to the bank and stopped the wire transfer. It was the Norton Antivirus refund scam. Thank God folks like u are doing something about it!
7:12 the spelling mistakes-
I never comment on videos. But awesome informative information here! Well done. I'm forwarding to everyone I know who is susceptible ( my mother-in-law has already been scammed for 3k she couldn't afford).
You are a gd inspiration.
Thank you for doing the 'monologue' explaining how this works. I keep sharing your videos in hopes that it helps at least 1 person.
I am from India and these scammers are really a big black scar on our land.
Fake victim: panicking over the scam Him: casually drinking coffe  Lol
I love this. Just drop a giant Glitter Bomb on India! The glitter will attach to all the scammers. Which is alot of em
You should start making a anti-scammer company.
Sadly, that's one out of many arrested. Still, one less off the street. Watching Mark Rober's video was so great to see it unravel. It gave me a bigger grasp on how this whole thing works. It's interesting and I feel schools need to talk to students about scams, even somehow get elderly people in a class about this stuff. Scams are evolving but if you know the basics of it, you'll know what to look for.
325 SCAMMER hates the video hahaha you all going down
this is the best real life drama tv period! go get them and destroy the scammers!
Steven used Fake Tears , It's super effective!
Good
Your a superhero....!!
This explanation is so overdramatic XD
Keep up the awesome work. I hope the authorities reach out to you so you can work together to catch these human scumbags. The world doesn’t need these pissant scums
your guys are amazing god bless you for your work keep up the fight
I don't understand why people blur scammers face? If he/she doesn't have shame scamming most vulnerable people (Old people) then why should we show any mercy to them.
Noiceeee!!!
can  i get the privat number of Vivian Rodgers? I love her!
Love ur work! These scammers deserve everything u do to them
Powerful corporations leverage the government on allowing robocalls because there making hundreds of millions of dollars., thus the consumer is the victim. Until we stop these robocalls, there will always be victims.
Being indian, i could never have been more ashamed if this is what we are going to be now known for. Being a Mark Rober fan for years, i came to know abt this channel too,  i think you guys did a fantastic job. Please be careful guys, but i hope you don't blame all of us indians...
Acting of the year award right there.🤣
I loved your blue hairs :)
Well done you guys. The collab is strong and very productive. Let's see more. Great job.
Loved the video. Love for the family
I send allllll my packages to my parents house in an area where people watch out for each other. That's what really matters
Do this again!
You guys are doing amazing. Take this all the way. Strike fear into the hearts of these scammers. Take it all the way to India and make it so that those scammers there have so much fear that the reward for this doesn't out way the risk of rotting in jail.
You are humbly gifted and blessed with a supportive  and beautiful family. ( Your subs aren't too shabby either. 😆)
Your real voice is great. would scare me if you started talking and I didn't know you were there
I have a question can u make a video of u grabbing an ip by making them click a ip grabber
Jokes on you I don't have a computer. Or is it on me
Coming up next: nobody wants to make business with indians anymore.
So we are suppose to feel sorry for her and blur out her face.
YES!!!
I live in Orlando and and game to help.
Love, love, love the blue hair!!!
Red lipstick suits you !
Hey that's Pearland Texas. I live near there. Screw that broad
Guys we need to share these with elderlies so they don't get scammed!!! Thank you so much for making these videos, I'm sharing this video with family!
Bollyood
Love your work!
I am so up for helping with travel cost to India so you can meet Steven, Ben, Gus, and all the others you've talked to lol. My dad got scammed for years and our family had no idea. Lowlifes
My wife keeps receiving packages under her name with address but different email address. Someone has been subscribing her for membership with random companies and paying for the delivery. Pretty scary to think one day they can send something bad. Any recommendations?
Amazing.  My mother was scammed by a (debatably) worse, similar scam unbeknownst to me, and it's just heartbreaking to know that anyone, let alone someone close to you, has been duped by these disgusting people.  Taking advantage of good, hard working people who don't know any better, playing on their emotions to steal money from them.  These scammers even made my mother believe that her sons (my brother and I) were in danger of being harmed if she didn't comply with their requests, pretending to be everything from the D.E.A. to the FBI, threatening to arrest her and all sorts of terrible things.  I can't thank you, Jim Browning, and Mark Rober enough for cracking down on these pieces of garbage and really giving them what they deserve.  Keep it up, ya'll are awesome as all getout!
Rober's squirrel obstacle course is fun.
Hellyeah
God bless you guys for doing this. These scams does not just happen there in America... they're scamming people around the world... they should be stopped!
I have been scammed several years ago, and I was flagged for "illegal activity" so now I'm unable to get a bank account due to that. Thank you for what your doing.
bro why the blue hair? you trying to be markiplier? cant take people seriously who do that to themselves
This guy has nice teeth
Legit if a scammer ever did the scam where they act like they sent to much money I would just hang up and keep the "money".
They all are Indian.
this whole video was just a excuse to cross dress
I wish one of those scammers ended himself because of these actions so these guys that delidely believe are "heroes" understand that the problem is not evil but lack of education, opportunities and Aweful childhood and the solution is not shaming or more evil violence but understanding. How would they feel and how would they justify themselves if someone died because of their actions, I wonder...
hit them harder vivian 😜 the scammers are everywhere, not just in US... let us know how we can support you better.
You guys are great!! Thank you for doing what the authorities are supposed to be doing
The blue is cool, but I think you would rock a brighter colour, like fire engine red.
They aint never have the dedicaaaaatiooon
Man...you are the MAN!!! God bless you for what you are doing to these scammers. Good hunting!!!
Thank you for your hard work! Wonder when the government may find a way to protect these thugs ....? Why would the government care? It is WeThe People, For The People!  Real scammers, are the thugs in the government... where should we start ?  🤔 from the top, way top of these people who steal and hold the country hostage!
I'm already woke
Yeah man!! These men are burden for India.
I've watched all 3 of your channels and it makes me SO FREAKING HAPPY TO SEE FEW PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING BACK against this HUGE PROBLEM! Any way I could join the team? I want to help catch these criminals!
More people need to see this, Jim's and Marks videos...anyone...share links, the more power the people have the sooner this scourge can be taken down!  Having said that, Mark, Jim and Pierogi(Feel free to correct my spelling), fight the good fight folks, this is the ultimate dream team.
YOU ARE AWESOME BRO! One of the many sharks in the ocean of scammers baited and caught. Rot in jail POS.

Thank you for what you do my Friend...
I just found your channel and you are absolute GOLD!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
That’s amazing!! Good work guys! 👏🏻👊🏻
dont love that blue hair ffs
As of now 305 scammers down voted this video.
#GetRidOfBenchodes   Seriously though, thank you to all those who are going out of their way to fight against the scammers.  Cheers.
That Texas plate should be easy to track down....
Why not just tell everyone  Dont answer any question if its indian voice.
why block their face f**k them
Thank you.
Wake up wake up wake up
You guys are absolutely amazing. Thank you for what you are doing. Awesome job.
The next time that I get  a scammer call I am gonna get my sister to scream in the background and I'm gonna say MOM GET BACK IN YOUR CAGE and then say GTG LOL
I have a question. Why can’t google disable inspect element on banking websites? It wouldn’t stop all scamming but it would put a huge dent in this kind of scam
You’re a legend
Thank you SO much for making this video!
When you get a phone call from someone who wants money or account access, spin them a yarn and waste their time, but don't let them access your personal items or files. If it really is a law agency, they will produce a warrant...in person. If we all understood this, garbage scams like this would not last a day.
sad a private citizen has to perform the legal agencies job...
haha 🤘🏼
Thank you so much!!!!
You’re heroes. Thank you.
Looking very Marylin Monroe there Pierogi. Or a young and sexy Vivian.  Great video. Can't wait. THAT SIRS, Pierogi, Jim and Mark is a thing of  beauty. More please.
You're frackin awesome!!
We love you guys so much for doing this work!
So basically air bnb needs to do something  n o w wth theyre literally allowing this to happen
People need to wake up and just wake up
We finally got one thanks for doing what you and the rest of the scam baiters do!
You, Jim, and Mark will succeed.  There is no doubt about it.  I recently received a voicemail stating that my SSN was allegedly being used fraudulently in Texas.  Thanks to you and your team I knew exactly what was up.  The information that you provided gave me the knowledge so that I knew that Social Security would never call me or any other big corporations for that matter.  Thanks again.  BTW, you never looked so attractive wearing that wig and lipstick.  LOL.
I get tired of the calls when I’m at work 💀
You should have narrated the glitter bomb attack and aftermath because it came across garbled and incoherent. Otherwise, credit to you, Jim and Mark (and Karl Rove) for actually attempting to shut these a$$holes down instead of attempting to monetize scambaiting.
sorry if someone has already suggested it, but what about Karl Rock?  For your Indian point person.  This is so cool having a multinational operation going on with youtubers.   it's like Interpol.  only more fun.  :D  NeeP has actually taken the battle to India before.  I swear I haven't been that scared since I TP'ed my vice principals house and the lights inside came on.  O_O  I thought he was out.  It was like watching a horror movie and you're yelling at the screen, "don't go in there, you fool!  The bad guys are right behind that door!"  Great show.  :D   I like and appreciate all aspects of the fight.  Humour, time wasting, making them rage, deleting files, sound boards, call flooding, safaris, ...  it's all good.  It's just different departments of the same League of justice.   And I love, love, love killing them softly with science.  Go Team of Regular Joes. (with a certain set of skills)   :)
This is on the edge of changing everything.. please don’t give up innocent people need you.
That metallic blue steel hair color is SICCCCKKKK dude! Badass
Show their faces. I want to see handcuffs not glitter.
You need to get your group organized, get some people trained on these countermeasures and counter tactics.  Then get with your lawyer and submit your requests to the government to start a new crime unit, with the power and legal abilities to send the police, feds, bounty hunters, etc... to get these malicious vile creatures!!   You are the new wave of technological law enforcement!     If I were a millionaire, I surely as hell would invest heavily in you!!  Tech pirates and scammers get away with billions and billions of dollars a year!  You need all the resources you can get!!!
Id love to see the police cam & her excuse why she smells and is full of glitter😂. Good job👍❤️
Thank you!!!! Why aren’t we seeing this on the news networks like CNN, etc.? This should be on international news to warn people. If every single station did warnings about these kinds of scams, frequently, there would be a lot less scamming success stories. Thank you for what you do. All of you involved……thank you!
What if you bank account only has 26$
Bruh. Mark, Jim and Pierogi together is legit a superhero squad.
The sad thing is that it will never stop. Even as you're exposing them and raising awareness, they're likely developing another thing that will take advantage of millions of people in 5 to 10 years... but thank you for caring and doing what you're doing. It says a lot about you
Good work
He deserves an Oscar Steven
The majority of Indians consider these scammers to be a blight on their country, and are just as frustrated with their own government's inaction. If you can break through the culture and language barrier, you can probably find plenty allies there to help.
My Grandpa falls for these scams all the time and I tell him he is getting scammed but he never believes me
This is the next level of cyber policing.  I'm glad there are at least a few people out there right now, doing something to protect the sheeples!!  They need as many shepherds as they can get!!  They must have a lot of fun doing this, because I'm a sarcastic jackass, and I love giving some fiery blowback to jerks that think they know everything about everything!  It's fun watching them squirm and sweat!!
You do such a great job, I especially love it when you delete their files, and again, I love Vivian!  Thanks so much, what you do is so needed and appreciated!
Amazing. Excellent. Keep it up! KEEP IT UPPP!!!
Pahst Malone
It’s sad that these scammers don’t understand that money doesn’t buy happiness
thank you my friend
All of the dislikes are from the scammers...but this is a serious issue and we need to solve it.
Love your work. YOUR a Pioneer of righteousness.  Go hard, and keep cracking on mate. It's not difficult to support such a champion of our species.. Your a fine example of the good in people. Well done. 👍🏻🤟🤘✌🏽🙋‍♂️😎
I can't believe that anyone cam be so dumb as to wrap & send a box full of cash!
<Insert generic comment here to appease the algorithm>
Thank you!! I will be sharing this with my father.  Keep up the great work!   I myself, have received calls from the "FBI" stating my social was compromised.  They try to convince you, you are going to be  arrested, and I said, OK I am waiting!!  I said I bet you want my social, the guy yelled at me, who told you that?  I said, well isn't that what you are going to ask?  Twice in one day, my sarcasm made them realize I was not going to be duped.  I would take all the scammer calls just so I could mess with them!  Thank you again!!
I heard your grandma voice and got used to it, but after I heard your normal voice you sounded so different...lol😂😂
Love it 😍
Thank you VERY MUCH for putting your time and effort!!! What you're doing for communities and others is AWESOME!!!
This is the best thing ever!...  I've messed with scammers before for fun when my mom was alive...but this is! Makes me a super a mature lol
One victim (at least) went to India and it did not go well. If you want a URL of a phony "Microsoft Firewall' popup (partly in Base64 code) with an 855 phone shown, contact me.
Mark Rober rocking the scammer collabs lately is great! Love both your channels 💜
So 275 of these dislikes are probably associated with these same type of scammers
Great result! Good to see law enforcement getting invoIved at last 😀 I hope you three extra-ordinary guys will work together again.
Keep working to get them behind bars and looking fabulous.
we actually once got one of the virus scams on my old computer. when we called the number and my mom was explaining the situation, she mentioned it was 'my 15 year old child's computer, they only use it for art' the scammers hung up after realizing they couldnt get money from it (my mom used a different computer at the time for her banking)
You 3 guys are my heroes! You guys have our backs which I'm so happy your here! 👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍
Pierogi is sooo cuteee, I'm in love
You're incredible, thank you for doing this. Those people are the scum of the earth.
Thank you and your colleagues  so much for all your hard work. God bless and protect You and Yours Always.🙏👍
THANK YOU for being heroes for the victims of crimes!!   I had a scammer call last year saying they were from my electric company trying to get me to get gift cards from walmart to send to them. They were so pushy and rude, threatening to cut off my electric, I can see how older folks like all of our parents and grandparents may fall for these scams. THANK YOU AGAIN!
You need to make app! Where people can download your voices!  So people can use them when they call their friends to mess with them. I would use Vivian It's so funny!🤣😂🤣
272 scammers disliked this video.

If I had a wish free for you, I would wish you wouldn't have any content anymore to publish, because then all the scamers are gone 😊  You are doing a great job 😊

Singing!! Yes!! I love it!!
Hey man I really appreciate what you do. Standing up for those who can't is how we all should be. Thank you and if you ever need help I'm here.
You are a modern day super hero. Keep up the great work and destroy these people!👊🏻
Amazing. Keep up the great work !!! Made my day!!
This is the best callobration on Youtube! What a team
Let’s go! Get more!
Do you think the 270 dislikes on this video are the scammers? 👹
I think that's the first time I have actually heard you say "Desk Top"...........
Im so proud of you guys because I use to watch you guy year back and had to stop because I did not like how the cops kept on put you off but you guys stayed with it and thats a job well done. Keep up the good work
Just can't imagine why you are not showing these turds faces?!?
Vivian ROCKS!!  It's a pleasure to see you working with Mark and Jim!!!  Keep up the great work!
Love you guys
The work you guys are doing is amazing. Not to mention the videos are informative and funny. Thank you
That was awesome.  😂
Mark Rober and Jim Browning The Legends
I'm soooo glad you used Mark's glitter bomb lmfao 😂😂😂
Thank you and all for what you all do, God  bless.
Hey, how do I contact you? I need help. I own a small business, like any good small business I'm on Google My Business, but it paints a target on me for scammer calls. I get at LEAST 4 each year. "We're from Google, we're updating your keywords on Google My Business for the next 12 months". They sound legit, they get you to invest the time to talk about your GMB listing details, and then they pretend you need to drop hundreds of $$$ to get the "changes and updates" confirmed.  They got me on the phone for 30m twice the first time they called. Now I just can't get them to realize that I know the jig is up - I know you're scammers, stop wasting my time with these calls. If I ever actually got a call from Google they'll think I'm an absolute dick. =P  So let's get in touch. Let's do some damage. Let me know how to send you the next call I get from them and make it a shitty day for them to be alive. =)
Justice yeah!
I think the thing that astounds me is that these elderly people can follow all of those instructions at their age which makes them pretty intelligent but they are still so naive that they are getting conned multiple times.  I know a woman who was conned.  It destroys their ability to survive in retirement.
That's it. I'm naming the new heroine in the next book series VIVIAN.
I just want to say thank you and the other YouTubers that do this. Instead of making your living off of the suffering of normal people, you make it off of evil people who do. You guys are heroes for hire.
I watched Mark's video.  You uncovered a whole network.  That is amazing.
the iconic trio: Mark rober Jim and palogi
Love your vids and of course Vivian Rogers she’s awesome.   Over here in England scammers are in abundance too. We need someone like you over here!   Well done all of you xx
got yourself a new editor?
DirecTV scam going on big time had scammer on phone for 45 minutes and he was so pissed he called me every name in the book it was epic you guys inspired me help an have fun at same time.
"This is unbecoming of you, I didn't raise you this way!"
So awesome! Finally some retribution, Let’s bring more to justice!
God knows how many people you may have saved from getting scammed and loosing their life-savings! thank you for your service!
😃🍑💪🖐️👏👍🙏.... Thank you ☺️... Be safe everyone 😉...
Love your vlogs. Thanks for the great work
People need to start ruining these guys lives. Lose your job go to jail, they dont stop they only move onto another scam they are scum criminals.
The reason this is not effectively prosecuted by the Indian government is because it brings BILLIONS of DOLLARS into to Indian economy. It’s that simple.
My dad just got scammed all his money by scammers pretending to be ebay
I love that I didn't even have to search for any of these 3 videos because I'm subscribed to all 3 of you. Thanks or doing what you do <3
Kudos to you three crime fighters.  What is really depressing to me is how come 3 Internet personalities are apparently making more progress on this problem than our own government?  How pathetic is that?
Thank you for caring about us
I'm just trying to figure out how two computer guys and an engineer are able to catch these guys when law enforcement has been telling us for years that nothing can be done. You guys are awesome. My hat is off to Perogi, Jim, and Mark. Keep up the good work. every time you are on the phone with one of them it reduces the chances of another person getting scammed.
You’re doing gods work. Thank you!
Jim Browning, Kitboga, now Scammer payback. A rabbit hole I didn't know I needed. You guys are great, entertainment at it's finest.
12:50 Hey, at least she got her nice jeans bedazzled into a pretty snazzy pair of glittered jeans!
I love the synergy going on here between you, jim, and mark.
Pierogi in polish menas dumplings :D
Just commenting on this video about a previous video of your's. Just please be aware that breaking into someone else's machine, even to prevent other crimes from happening, is a federal crime in and of itself and you could be arrested for doing so.
Bravo!
Hi Scammer Payback, from Toronto ON.  Just want to let you know, you are doing great good and it’s all worth it.  The perception that the indian bosses give is that Westerners are wealthy and it’s ok to scam them without any conscience. ... It’s amazing from a psychological perspective how void of feelings some of these scammers are.  Thanks to you and Jim, Mark, Karl and the like for fighting back and protecting our elderly targets.  I am most concerned for people on the ground doing investigative work in India.  Indian police can be just as corrupt, so they need international police support.
One of the greatest collars of all times
That was so freeking great....Come to Canada... we need you here.
Getting them into jail in India is the ONLY way to stop this.
i love what you do dude!!! keep up the good work!!
Can you do a scam where the account is on negative? To see the reaction of the scammers
LEGEND!
You´ve done a mans job Sir !!
YOU are a NATIONAL TREASURE ! You embody what being a AMERICAN is.. Land of the free HOME OF THE BRAVE!! Thank you for protecting our vulnerable and educating us how to as well.
I literally got a scam call 5 mins before I watched this.
Stop blurring their face! California v Greenwood. Check out the case law no expectation of privacy in public! Expose these low life scum bags for who and what they are scammers.
Screw everyone who gave this a thumbs down.
Thank You!
If I provided an IP address could you help me get payback on a scammer that scammed me out of my steam account
Oooh yeah vengeance at it's finest! Keep it up!
Awesome work!  Been watching and laughing for a couple days now. Thank you for all you are doing to make this world a better place for the rest of us.   I been retired out of IT for a long time, before scammers got on board, wish I could learn how you do this, I could spend the rest of my retirement entertaining myself like this.    I actually answered a scam car warranty call today, lmao, What year car you have I can look you up. ME:1969 dodge dart... scammer: what? Nothing newer than 2000? Me: No.   Btw hows the weather in Kolkata, you on Park St right?  CLICK... I’ll be laughing all day.
255 scammers saw this video. Great stuff! Keep it up
Love your videos! Take down these trashy people. 👍👍👍
Bless you for your dedication to take down scammers. You and your work are invaluable.
I love the idea but instead of glitter I would use shit bombs
Pay back
Great video! Not all heroes wear capes.. thank you!!
Thank you 🙏🏻
You guys are the best "Disrupters" that the planet needs so much right now to shake up this criminal industry! Fantastic work!
Thanks, it helps for your info, I will having fun with thouse scamers.
I hate thous calls, I'm blocking  like 60+.  At once I let them see by bank accout :) with out PW :)     Like minus  :) -1393Eur so they left me.... for the 3 month, the calls started again, and  constantly. I'm nice gay.... or.... :)   I'm blocking, or... if I'm drunk - having fun :)
lol maybe a little over editing here, but still, ya doing gods work
This makes it so much harder for the honest people with Indian accents that actually work for corporations in the US. I feel bad for them
Good work tho
Mark showed this a week ago
We should train up an army of anti-scammers so it's not just the 3 of you, but hundreds..  Scale it up!
fak jeee the bomb!
💯
Keep rocking it bro
I usually start talking in Spanish and they hang up.
So what happened did you follow this case all the way through to sentencing?
Now lets hope the courts don't screw up all your guys hard work!
Well i have an idea for your scammer payback. Make Them feel bad for you. Like for example. He ask for you to pay or something and you tell that your have like what omm cancer or like something like that idk just an idea. Just make Them feel bad for you
What's super awesome is I have followed all three of you for so long... and to see you all collab like this is huge.  Keep up the good work!
What’s going to happen soon is that scammers Will tell their victims that you might get a call from a person, pretending to protect you from scammers but in fact he’s the one sending viruses, therefore we need to get  to your computer.
Omg... can you believe the scammer getting out of the car COVERED on glitter and smelling like SHIT/FARTS. I LOVE IT
We are so greatfull to you man you're the one that prevented a scamer from stealing my money  i had seen one of your vid .. sk when i received à call sahing that my social inssurance number had been involved in a drug  ring that i had to give them money to stay free  before my court date.bla ba bla ... if not the police would arrest me ..so no we say a effing thank you to you guys you prevented a lot of people from getting scamed....thank you from the bottom of my heart.
You need to get with Dr phil or something. I hate to see the older women and men that get taken on the romance scams. It kills me
Now I heard your real voice haha! Congrats Thank You and Please don’t stop doing this
I LOVE YOU MAN! YOU’RE A HERO . A REAL HERO
Amazing work! Thanks so much!!!
Do this with a glitter bomb and equal emounts of prop money...
Internet superheros
"Thank you, let me first transfer that money into some other bank accounts. I have another Laptop here to do that..."
sounds like my present to a scammer is a bit of kind,  my friend  got scammed to ship a iphone 8 to nigeria.   with fake payment done,    we shipped to cans of fermented herring instead,   no idea what he did with those  , but they passed customer and we never from him again   yes we painted the tin black and painted a applelogo on the tins first :)
The next time I go home, well my childhood home, I am going to get my 83 yo mum to watch this.
Start a company that investigates and fights this from a legal perspective. Find out what laws are regarding international crime. Make a crowdfunded non-profit. Lawyers, former detectives, private investigators, hackers, youtubers. Take 1 year to get it up and running.  Find a way to monetize it too. If you get greedy corporations involved, it will live on forever. The McDonald's scam busting.
Keep up the good work 👍🏻
Great job, thanks for taking care of the victims and all your work in trying to expose these pieces of trash!
I got scamed and please tell me good things to do when it happens:
I watched Rober’s videos, amazing job you guys are doing. What baffles me is every time the victim actually follows the directions to stay on the phone during all of this and packing it the way they ask and never once do they think twice about what they are doing and aren’t suspicious at any point!
I got a question. Over here in Europe it is mandatory for banks to have two factor authentification for bank accounts. Do you think that would prevent that kind of scam? Also we don't just need to authenticate the login, but every transaction as well. Don't you have that over in the US?
You spelled your name wrong. It's Mary Samsonite.
added to playlist and shared with my entire company internally.
love
Ste(v)phen is one famous guy
You are awesome man thank you so much! you are a hero to those of us who have been scammed. It took me 2 years to clean all my credit and bank issues after they tried to robed me from everything I own!! THANK YOU!!!
Thanks for catching the middleman. Now get the mastermind.
Jim Browning, Mark Rober & scammer payback are seriously amazing folks!!!! Keep it up guys
You are amazing bro please keep it up
Thanks A Lot. :)
Don't Grow tired of doing Good 💪🙏
You’re doing God’s work.
Pierogi - I ❤  you- get a petition signed to get new department in police with a team like you guys. Or SOMETHING. Get governor, mayor or senators involved. You have all the proof. Get more victim lists, intercept more packages and get testimonials. I hope you get this.
Love what you're doing keep up the good work. God bless you.
Wow this is incredible!! I wish there were more people like you man! Keep it up
Call me sick but when the fart spray begins, in place of Caulkin's voice I would record Walter White's describing to Lydia what the Ricin is going to do to her... a little fear of death, a trip to the ER, and the persons I.D. is logged at the hospital for the authorities later.
Scammers are not just found in India
Thank you for doing this. It's great that progress is being made. I love watching Jim Browning dissect these operations using his brain. Awesome.
Yeah, banks won't let you withdraw that much.. have to make them write a cashier check instead.
Please let us know if these creeps get convicted. Thank you so much for all you are doing.  My 85 year old father was scammed out of $30k and he lives on a fixed income and can barely afford to pay for his medications each month.  These creeps are heartless and the authorities couldn’t do anything.
You are the best love these videos
Those that target elderly are some real scum of the Earth.
As funny as these videos are, I come away from them feeling a little physically ill at the thought of someone elderly or vulnerable being threatened and abused this way and handing over their life savings to these vile cretins.
Thank you for your Channel update God bless you Brother's. I will pass it in
OPPPPP-
Good men.
Vivian and the packages... that just made my day!
The glitter bomb is worth so much tho
Awesome work. You definitely got my support 🙌.  And I laughed so hard. Really good job. I shared it with my friends and family. Keep making crying Steven CRY. 😆
I saw marks video and then I searched up your channel and your content is awesome
I loved this colab. This whole thing is amazing. You, Jim, and Mark! I also thank you for the raw and real message at the end. I also want to say, people listen to this man. He may be doing a job that if successful self destructs, but that's the point isn't it? Anyways thank you and the rest of the trio for fighting back and to all the scam baiters out there wasting time and spreading around the greatest weapon we have, knowledge. So thank you sir.
There is another
People are so stupid that they think Mark Rober is a verified spammer
Love what you do...love the blue hair
Infect their systems, they just buy new hardware.  Like a flatworm, cut the head off and they grow a new one.
So awesome!  The United States government needs to stop pretending that this stuff isn't happening and needs to take action.
Was that your sister playing Vivian? She`s quite the looker, is she single?
You have an RE20 mic, there is no need for you to have your face right in it, you're popping and making lip noises. 15cm from your mouth will sound a lot better.
If you want to have some fun troll the scammers but don't let them on your computer or anything like that
May I ask is he gay or straight  ?  Great video btw 💕
Thank you to you all.  Keep up the good fight.
I subscribed to your channel because of Jim Browning. Keep doing good!
Well done! Amazing work. Love the hair too! Keep up the brilliant work!
who knew my love of drag and scamming scammers would converge on this channel
Keep it up!!
What make it really bad that money mule is a P.O.
If 1 person can do this why isn't the government doing it?
If 1 person can do this why isn't the government doing it?
If 1 person can do this why isn't the government doing it?
Out here doing the lords work 🙏🏼
All of you guys are awesome and thank you very much for your hard work, we love you!
I can't believe this type of content is free , thank you so much
I work in an office that has NOTHING to do with the Department of Justice or the court system in the United States and I got a call from someone who was being scammed by someone claiming to be an agent with the Supreme Court while working.  The scammer mirrored my office number.  I could not convince the man who was without a doubt elderly that I was not the court and he tried to convince me he wife was only a step away from getting $10,000.  I tried so hard to convince him this was a scam and explain that the government should always send paperwork, not just make phone calls, and not to give these scammers money or information.  He just would not believe me and called back twice a few minutes later thinking he must have dialed wrong.  I think the third time he called he was beginning to realize the truth but I was so sad I could not do more to protect him from scammers and very angry anyone would do this to an elderly couple.   I always advise my parents to look up the number on their computer to the legitimate groups and call or if it's computer tech support to ask their local computer repair shop at first.  My parents are pretty on to these scammers but I always worry.
When she walked out the car for the officer with glitter all on her jeans 😂
Love the collaboration between the three of you and more folks. It's good to see someone really taking action. Good job gentlemen.
Good job !!! And thanks so much for helping people !!! 🍁
These channels are so underrated when these  people are actually making a huge difference and making our world better.  Thank you for everything you do 🙏❤️
Great video!! Thank you!!
trending ayy
These videos need to be put on a DVD or vhs tape and sent to all elderly people.
the ultimate payback would be one that disables them for life
Expose these people, no blur needed
Good job guys!!  What amazing work y’all do.  Keep up the good work
Great work Perogi!
Thank you Pierogi, Mark, Jim and others for trying, in your own ways, to contribute towards a more peaceful, secure and ultimately a happier world! God bless you all! 🙏♥️
Put in a paint 🎨 bomb . 👏🤣🙏
Bro are you polish, cuz you know . . . Pierogi
Time to bring in Karl Rock so you can close the "last mile" ,as they say, in the scam life cycle :D
Damit this is funny shit .....but is it true??
Keep going don’t stop,let’s teach these assholes a lesson!!!!
This is a shame,they r targeting the sick n elderly 🤬
Amazing! God bless you guys!
Thank you 🙏
You just don't know how corrupt the system is in india. Not a good idea to take this to india physically.
It’s crazy how police say there’s no actual crime so there’s nothing they can do about it but they don’t understand scam baiters STOPPED the crime from happening which is what the police should’ve been doing. Like if someone is about to break into someone house and someone stops them will the police say there was no actual crime so they can’t arrested the burglar? It’s crazy. ANYWAYS great video!!
Thanks so much for doing this!  My mom was scammed out of 30,000 before I discovered what occurred - not via computer but similarly via lottery phone call scam - these people our despicable preying on elderly people! Wish the authorities would take this seriously and actually go after these criminals!
Great job
Keep giving these scammers hell. They deserve every bit of it and more.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR all you guys do for the people getting scammed
I am so happy that you guys did this!
Don’t worry about telling me if I don’t like it I had to watch it because you’re right this sucks
The crying is just ridiculous
We thank you for what you do. Very satisfying to see a little payback for the aggravation scammers cause us when they call us.👏
These scammers have no souls.
Its a pity that governments are nowhere to be seen. They should support these websites and ensure mass distribution, in UK first you have the scammer, then get scammed by the banks who refuse to return cash in over 50% of cases, even though they are heavily to blame having made money transfer so easy without a buffer period to halt the transactions. I stopped a scam transfer from my account within minutes but natwest bank took three months to refund me, after a big battle claiming data protection prevented them from disclosing the scammers details, even though I had already given them those details. (Scammer left transfer info on my account).
I started watching about a week ago, but this channel in incredible!!!!!😁😁😁😁
That "Past Malone" tho! I'm dying
Is there any way for scammers to have access to our phones and/or computers without us giving them information or downloading things like “any desk” to give them access?
Indian accent with a common American name = 99% chance SCAM!!!!
Why are you looking like a Smurf?
I’ve gotten a scam call twice I just call them a bitch and leave the call
Thank you for your service! ❤️
Love you Guys for helping all these people <3 You three are Heroes
I am waiting to see how the scammers figure out how to add the scambaiters calling and warning the victims into their scam.  It will happen any day now.
I don't know which is more disturbing: the scammer crying or the OP's crossdressing.....
Best video yet!!!
Thank you for everything you do!
Can we do this to cancel culture????
Yes! I have been loving on you!
Fkn awesome 🤜🏼🤜🏼🤜🏼
You guys are awesome. Thank you for everything you do. I wish our government would step in and protect us as well but I guess that's too much to ask. There are voters rights to attack after all.
Excellent performance! Thanks for sharing it on YouTube. Best regards and blessings to Jim, Pierogi and Mark.
I love this stuff. Police need to do there job or loose there tax funding.
You guys are the best..
The 234 scammers that watched the video... you're going down scum.  Keep up the good work guys!!! Always pleasing to see good payback.
Pierogi you are a legend. If only you worked for the scumbag government
It's amazing someone would go through all that without thinking something's wrong
Amazing
Ok, I understand the hustle to a point where they manipulate you to the point you need to send back the money. But that you need to do this in cash, divide the money, in aluminium foil, etc... that's at least something you have to question and ask someone for help or their opinion?? Apparantly not but that part somehow baffles me...
Why did Mark and Jim appear on each others channels, but you just used footage from Marks channel and claimed to be a part of it?
Hi my dear friend. I just got a scammer call this morning,  but what's most strange , is that I got it in Mallorca, and I cannot understand why they are calling here. The number from which I got the call was: 004998770865, which is a german number.
we support you Scammer Payback!!!
You are amazing
Vivian is fucking hot dude!
I am so happy they are going to come to India 👍.👌❤️
I just got an Amazon scam call a few hours ago, calling from my own area code. The only person I know with the same area code as mine is my husband. Sadly, my husband's uncle has fallen victim to scams three times that he's told us about, probably lots more that he still doesn't realize were scams.
Indian police and Indian government knows about these scammers. Yet they do nothing. They choose to turn blind eye to these scammers. And why would they? They are after all bringing money to India.
Pierogi, Thank you for all you do,you are an unsung hero in me and my family's eye and we are glad to support you
Intro was fire. Imagine being able to actually bust one of these losers. Has to be fulfilling in some way
This is KOOL  Keep showing them the real "BULLSH!T" that they are.       Thanks.
The "geek squad" called me yesterday! Lmao..... I cussed them out so bad I "almost" felt bad afterwords.....Lol almost!!
Keep doing what you are doing. I found this because of the Glitter bomb videos. You are a true super hero. Mark and Jim as well. What you guys do is definitely entertaining but also makes a huge difference in the lives for those infected by the scum.
you saved the best for last, and you didnt even show her face. i think she was asian though. some letters on her grocery bag maybe. yawn
India should really make examples out of these people like India should do many things but is obviously incapable at the highest level  And in a sense its not even really their fault they are shitty scammers. really .  The whole country is rife with failure and this is just another appendage  Consider India’s performance:      Nobel prize winners from India in last 100 years: 5     Indian Olympics medal tally 2016 : 2     Global brands from India: 0     Top Indian university: not in top 100 globally  A country that makes 1/7th of Earth’s population. Isn’t it an oddity?   I can go on and on about India’s standing globally. And by this point many readers may become defensive or angry as this post may come across as rant. But there’s no denying that it’s fantastically unexplained that almost 20% of the world’s population is perpetuating living a life of comparative mediocrity and often misery  A smaller country can take solace in a variety of facts: lack of natural resources, lack of enough young people, an autocratic leader. But what does India have apart from excuses?  There are many CEO's in fortune five hundred from India. There are many brilliant Indian people all over the planet.  But the India system is just bad.   the problem is two fold   1) A severely classed system full of internal nepotism breaching racism , with this comes inherited poverty that is seemingly inescapable, Not great a great ingredient for being very nice.  2) Dogmatic religious Karma theory built into all aspects of life  This world is picnic spot to grow and have Moksha. Bad karma and kama gives u rebirth in this picnic spot. You are not responsible. It is your past life karma which is responsible for your state and country state. This logic has made India responsibility free. Moksha can only be achieved by inner cleaning. (Reason for clean homes) India's idols are people who denounce Kama(work) and the external world. They say it is manifestation of your mistakes. So you don't have incentive to be excellent. you have incentive to pass life and reduce karmas to be free from this cycle of life.  Its a class cast systems and inherited religious subservience that has made India suffer in practically every way imaginable. Including inventing these type people by the hundred.
jim browning is the main guy, rober and pierogi are just piggy backing
Great upload. But too late
Can you do one where you say yes I'm happy to renew the subscription at the start and see what they say?
Watched the adds and dropped you a like,I helped😅👍
Amazing job!!! Thank you so much for all the hard work💓🤘🙋
keep up the good work you guys do
I bet the cop was extremely gratefule to you for dousing the scammer in that horrific fart spray. Especially since he hat to transport her in "His" SUV. Roflmao. I bet he was looking for a rookie to trade rides with.
They are calling in Germany, too. I asked him how the weather was in India, he said Pakistan and hung up.
You guys are great.Teamwork makes the dream work 🤞🏼🙏🏼💯💯 TRULY GOD'S WORK STAY BLESSED!!!
What an amazingly well done video. Keep up the good work. My late grandmother is thanking you from wherever she is.
Pierogi I love that you get right into the character Vivian Rogers!!  Great Job Sir!!  I am a disabled police officer but when I have a few extra dollars I will be joining..
I didn’t VIVIAN was that hot!  Lol. This is awesome! U and Jim are my boys!
please correct me if i’m wrong, but if the problem is that when packages are sent since there’s no money in them there’s no victim, so why not put some money in your packages? then you’ll be an “actual” victim and the cops can make an arrest.
You are doing god’s work.
Only people down voting are scammers.  You know who you are.  You've been seen.
Why is this video so DISAPPOINTING?  We wanted to see the full police interaction between the scammer and the cop and all we got was a little bit at the end that we saw in other vids by Jim Browning and Mark Rober.
Please don’t stop!
You are so handsome! :D
It is fantastic job you guys are doing keep up the fight for the victims of these evil scammers. I am amazed that our country doesn't do a he'll of a lot more to curve this problem but poletitions are to dam lazy to do what needs done.
You should have some kind of fizzy lemon lime flavored drink in a can labeled "scamer tears" I'd buy it by the case! 🤣 Great work!
Blue hair... way to commit to the little old lady persona.
Big win buddy thank you
If you're not sure about who is calling you then ask questions. Who is calling? Who are you trying to reach? What is my name?  Where are you calling from? What time is it there? Can I call you back? And if all else fails: I don't have my computer.
229 scammers viewed this video so far!
Dude. Respects ❤️ I'm from India and I hate these Scammers! Young People :  Please do Educate your elders about these kinds of stuff.
You putting in all the time & hard work to help raise awareness is legendary. Keep it up. I love you ❤   😉🤣
WHAT WE NEED IS AN EDUCATION CAMPAIGN. Mass nationwide Televison spots 10's of thousands of times for the next 10 YEARS educating the population that 100% of attempts to transfer money especially by mail ARE SCAMS. no exceptions. 100% of the time. no matter how emotional they get its a scam. no exceptions.  We need to DRILL this into societies brains especially our elderly. Grind it again and again until we want to MURDER people we are so sick of hearing it but then when the scammer calls PEOPLE WILL KNOW.  That is what needs to happen. that is the ONLY way to fix this. MASSIVE nationwide mass education campaign.  When grandma goes to the doctors the nurse needs to explain it to them. When they goto the grocery store ads need to explain it to them. WHen they watch TV ads need to explain it to them.  Over and over everywhere they go.
That was awesome!
Thank you for all you do, my brother in law just got taken by a amazon scam.
Well done, give them hell!
That was freaking cool! Glad you guys are doing this and I wish you luck!
VIVIAN THOSE NAILS ARE BEAUTIFUL <3
We need a badass team ready in INDIA, so that they can collaborate with you guys and get these guys caught and gets these guys behind bars along with their TOP BOSSES & the OWNERS.
I love all these recent crossovers of multiverses! You're stronger together 👍
Well done! Man, using Glitter bomb's against those scammers seems to be the best idea you had as a combination of your great work, awesome!🙌
I sulute your sir for helping catch this one. I know there are more out there.
Don’t take this lightly. You’re an angel. You seriously are. Thank you for all you do to help protect people 🙏♥️👏
Awesome, thank you. Your saving all of these elderly people.
Some day, we will send the call centers in India will receive some special glitter bombs, with some extreme stink bombs.
You are all Hero, great job and thank you for your wonderful service. Let us all figth this scammer who are a plague of a sociaty. More power and long live to you all. ❤
If the put a felony amount of money Florida less then 200 in the box then it is a crime the issue has been that is was trash and still mail fraud. RIGHT?   Or is it just easier to for the police to ticket us and harass us for non crimes till they find one or convince us that we committed a crime to make there money
Why block their faces? Put them on blast
Filthy scammers
To catch a scammer..... make it happen
We just disconnected our land line and today I got a call on my cell phone from “Social Security” in Maryland she said. Not what the caller ID said though. She said she needed my social security number. I said “If you called me you must already know who I am “. She immediately said F You,   F You and hung up. Must have been a bad day. 🤣🤣🤣
I would say good lose your job
Nice work keep it going get them sum #@!&* itches for allthe innocent
why didnt he tease crying steven it would be funny
Duuuuuuuuuuude I was just catching up on your videos, how do you not have millions of views.  This guys is like have a geniuse vigilanty
100k plus subs in a few days, I wonder why lol. Nice. This is such an awesome colab.
Rule number one if the other end of conversion can’t speak good English strike one!!  Asking about bank in any form strike 2  Wanting me send you money strike 3  Sorry pal I appreciate the donation...
Just put Mark Rober in your title and get on trending instantly.
I found your videos about three months ago and I was blown away by them. You're a white knight. Yesterday, my mother-in-law got an email from "Paypal" (on an email account that is not linked to a Paypal account). I managed to intercept it and call the "fraud department" number that was placed in three or four places. It was absolutely this scam. Literally the only reason I knew about it and could recognize it was your videos. You probably saved my in-laws some money. Thank you very much!
This shall be known as one of the biggest crossovers ever. Jim! Mark! Perogi! They are legends in their own rights.... but when they combine forces.... You Know... Shit! Is! Going! Down! And scammers... are... gonna... CRY! Coming to a theater near you! March 2021! moviemaynotbesuitableforallaudiences
You should be on Rogan dude
I don't care for the cross dressing.
OMG!   You DID do 'Vivian in drag!'   LOL
A BIG thank you, I feel so sorry for the people that fall for these scammers. I still get at least one call a day. I have tried air horns, my kids fight over who gets to push the button on the air horn. I try to keep them on the phone as long as possible so that they are at least slowed down for a few extra minutes. Its so sad that the authorities can not go after them stronger. Keep up the great work - Thank you again.
I feel like half the sound came from mr robot
Awesome project! Persevere..
I watched it again. Unbelievable!! U are the law, keep it up. Fight these people.
Awesome stuff! Go get 'em  in Kolkata, knock on thier doors 😄
This is incredible, love that you got together with Mark, match made in scammer heaven.
Was she arrested or just asked and let go?
Why has this not been watched more!!? Clark Howard should contact you guys ASAP. U guys the best and all the best! Keep up the good work.
Not many people, inc law enforcement, can stand up to scammers so effectively like you. Good job!
Consumes glitter
Bro u are the literal meaning of evil methods to do good....
I would love to see this trio collaboration continue in the future on more projects!
Thank you for doing this.  It is incredible how people get scammed, but it happens.  I feel fo them, but, awareness is key.
I just shared this YouTube title on the community website!! Go get em’..
I have a crush on you for the following reasons: 1. You are a defender of tech justice. 2. You're so God damn smart. 3. You're one hell of an actor. 4. You are all day handsome. If that wife of yours fails to appreciate, you now have a good option.  Thanks Buddy Boy. 😂😘
Is this the first time we actually see Vivian?  "She" is amazing!
Bruh this makes me so happy. Keep it up man..
Me and my husband were scammed for 1,200.00 this past year in July. This scammer had told me and my husband we were getting a lifetime computer protection coverage through Microsoft. Thanks to your channel we realized we had been scammed. The scammer still continues to call us. Just today he called but he hasn’t got anymore money from us but he still tries. Thanks again for what you do.  KimberleyWhite
This is amazing. Haha I didn’t raise you this way. I can’t believe this exists!! I just hear calls and ignore them. Her jeans looked awesome covered in glitter though
I know innocent elderly people who have been scammed!! And as a police officer, I take reports for this all the time. And it’s frustrating, because it’s so hard to track the “main guy”! I honestly think y’all deserve a reward!! You guys are doing gods work! Y’all should be proud of yourselves!!
The Justice League of YouTube
Wholesome content
I nearly cried, great job you've inspired me to learn how to defend properly and help others if I can
wow tthis your cringeworthy  speech made me wanna puke. You make  youself sound like Batman lol.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Thanks buddy for your service  My cousin paid around 6,000$ in gift cards to IRS scammers in the middle of his divorce and other problems he couldn’t think through straight with all the issues he had to go at that time, so we appreciate you guys 👍
Get a life
wake up!
Lmao Vivian 😹
I'm... I'm sorry but if any idiot falls for this shit and thinks microsoft would ask you to wrap an envelope full of money in tinfoil and send it to texas, then they deserve to get scammed.
if it scams.. we can kill it.
the scammer.. has become, the scammed.
the glitter.. is on your hands.
I don't understand why UPS FedEx and the US postal service just kill this by requiring every time there's an overnight package being mailed by an old person at a place to talk about this scam
You are a champion!
Pierogi? Coincidence or do you have anything in common with Poland? Either way, greetings my friend! Keep doing what u are doing, great job! 🚀
Why blur the face?
You guys are the true League of Superheroes.
You guys are SAINTS,please dont stop taking these lowest of the low,scum of the earth,halfwits DOWN,many many thanks for your efforts.
Just a town away in Pearland, Texas. Sweet justice, god bless you and your family and friends.
Son don't cry I didn't raise you that way lol
they are stupid
Lol
Real life Avengers!!!!
YES!YES!YES! MARK, JIM AND VIVIAN CUFF CUFF HEHE , I LOVE YOU GUYS :D REAL, REAL HEROES!!!
If hell is real and he actually believes in Jesus, he knows where his soul is going after he kicks the bucket.
Hi, Could you do some so when the scammer gets to see your bank account you only have $100 in it, so we can see what they do. Good luck x
You should make a Anti scam academy and train everyone. Anti scam army.
I think Vivian is Marilyn Monroe and Lucy ball distant cousin lol
You 3 are the best thing to happen to YouTube
I wish I was smart enough to help. Good job! You guys are heroes
Amazing job, you guys did something great.
You guys are playing the best Pokémon Game ever: ♩ ♪ Gotta Catch 'em All ~ ♫ ♬
Vivian rocks :-)
Pierogi, Jim, Mark and the other anti-scammers are doing more to substantively address this problem than the various government agencies in charge of this at the enforcement level have ever done, despite millions of tax dollars, thousands of employees, and practically unlimited resources. Yet another example of the private sector doing more with less and getting more meaningful results than the bureaucratic government and their expensive, useless "task forces" ever could.  Well done guys.
Next scammer that calls me won't get a decline, *they'll get a hell of a bad time.*
If you need references to the Talmud's supremacism, then check out this book about the war between the "Sons of Light" and the "Sons of Darkness" : "Beware the World to Come" by Christopher Jon Bjerknes,

Well done. Lovely work. I look forward to the Three Amigos in India. 😁👍
The next time you delete a scammer's files you should tell him "Guess what! All your base are belong to us!"
Would love to see you act like you're happy you received more money than you were suppose to tell the scammers that you're going to keep it.
You sounded like Cartman when you were singing the Congratulations, lol!
You’re a real life hero! Can you do anything about the robocallers who want me to renew my car warranty (on a vehicle I don’t even own) ?
Vivian is pretty well preserved for her age.
The scammer fake crying was vomit inducing. You can't just say they're all poor people with no choice who would rather not be doing this after you hear that manipulator. Nasty.
Pierogi, your improv skills are legendary. I'm definitely going to stay subscribed to you for a very, very long time.
I got my first AMZ refund scam call a week ago. They even called from a number with a 206 area code. I hung up immediately.
8q
Can we just take a second to appreciate this guys acting? dang hes good, really played the part
Dude, you are crushing it right now. 👏🏼 🧡💙 You’re on your way to 1 million subs, I know it! 🧡💙🙏🧡💙
You are so awesom
Yay! Vivian Rogers makes an appearance. She’s a glamorous old babe.        Lol
🤟🤟🤟 Fantastic!! Many thanks 👏👏👏👏👏
Search Karl Rock, he busts scammers and call centers IN INDIA. He is from New Zealand, and lives in Delhi. His wife is Indian. Big-time YouTuber, he would be a great addition to your team!
How Mark Rober got involved with you and Jim Browning is an unusual story, but you guys are a match made in heaven.
Yes you guys did the glitter box. Awesome 👏
8:54...look up "The Egyptian Magician". lol
Was the girl actually arrested and charged with a crime? Or did they ljust let her go?
Strange device making weird noises, throwing glitter, and spraying fart spray. "I know, I'll put it in my car!"
OK, but between you and Kitboga, how much of this scambaiting is just an excuse to spend time in drag? Be honest now, you're like my grandmother.
Totally lost me there in like the last 5 minutes. The package went to an air bnb? Or it got stolen by a package theif? Or that was the scammer? Or WTF was that oddly edited mess all about?
She drives nice car
Best channel I’ve ever subscribed to!
Sukka's my uncle in Ughanda just dies and I am getting trillions, just had to give them my bank info...In a few days ima be rich!!!... I didnt even know I had an uncle, very nice guy I am sure
you are awesome. so is mark ❣️❣️❣️❣️‼️
keep up what you're doing you save people's live's liturally
When the girl got out covered in glitter 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Those pants will need to be incinerated.
Crying Steven was incredible. “Son don’t cry! I didn’t raise you that way.” 😂
Thank you for actually explaining how the scam works at the start of the video. I'm so sick of seeing comments blaming victims. Some people even say they deserve it for being so stupid. Being vulnerable and unfamiliar with computers is not the same thing as stupidity. These scammers have engineered their con to take advantage of a specific population of people. Somewhere in the world someone is using a different type of scam designed to take advantage of _your_ vulnerabilities and you're just lucky you haven't fallen victim to it yet.
MARK ROVERR
Are American banks just using a simple user name and password?
The glitter on his pants tho!🤣
Is it possible to step up from a glitter bomb to something even more evil? I am thinking a flea bomb. Thousands of fleas all over would simply be amazing.
Love the new hair pierogi!!
How do you gain access of the scammer’s computer and their files?
You, Jim and Mark need to start a legal task force of sorts and take this scamming thing head on with badges. I hope you make it to India and team with authorities there.
how many years did she went to jail for?
This is absolutely amazing!!
Vivian was THE BEST. Great job Pman!
The boys are back
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos🎈
Also these scams are sooooo prevalent. I've been getting calls from the same damn people for around 8 years now. They use different numbers every time, you should see my giant list of blocked numbers smh. I'd consider myself a passive person but for these people, I really wish they would die cause' that's the only way they'll stop.
"Might just go to india someday" Pierogi climbing on a plane with a battleaxe and kicking in the doors of some call centers, that's what we really need.
Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the kingdom of Heaven is near. Matthew 3:2  Jesus loves you!  = ) Never give up on your life!!
Lmfao the crying part
Can y’all try and go after scammers who are targeting Postmates drivers and other gig workers please? They pretend it’s postmates support and then steal all your earnings. I was scammed out of a weeks worth of pay
I love you 😅
i have been getting scam calls everyday i need to know how to rat to give them the memes virus so i can also just join the fight XD
Over here from Mark's vid. Great freaking work.
Random question, what's the difference between a scammer, and a hacker?
John 3:16-17 16- For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17-For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9- That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
How does someone down vote this ? Must all be coming from call centers .
Jesus Christ loves you all so much. Come to him today! Accept him as your Lord and Savior. Jesus died on the cross for us 2021 years ago so that we may be free from our sins through him. Believe on him and Trust him! Repent and surrender to him. He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.
Hopefully one day we will get to see Indian authorities raiding these call centers and hauling everyone out in handcuffs!
Shared 🙌🏽💯 thank you for fighting for us
Amazing work P!  I'm so proud to be a part of your community.  I truly admire what you are doing and you ARE making a difference, my friend.
The video of Vivian tho 😅
Keep it going. The day you glitter bomb all the offices and take down the India scam mob will be amazing.
Ctfu u crack me up , freekn genius dangit 💯🙃💜
Ultimate collab!
O my goddd..... atleast get a man who speaks proper english.... u need to have good props for scamming
Damn, Vivian do be lookin like a snack........
WOw. You mark and jim are amazing lmaoo

fabian is cute awwww
Subbed
Please keep this documentary esque format, so happy to see your video trending, been a follower. Cheers from New York!
Not all heroes wear capes.
Thanks to all you guys for providing such a valuable service.
How do they access your computer just from a call?
We thank you for the support and encouragement
This is the “Amish virus 4.0”. Where the victim does the work. Aided by low level stooges who might not know they are engaged in criminal activity...  As I stated before, raids on call centres through international police cooperation have happened in India and Indonesia for victims in Australia and Canada. There are YouTube videos showing this.  The US needs to step up to protect their vulnerable people. Don’t let your gram or gramps get swindled!
Here, the scam involves robocalls supposedly from “the Canadian taxation fraud department” or “the social insurance fraud department”. Some months I get 5 or more calls a week. When the Canadian and Indian authorities shut down the active call centres in India and/or arrest the ones involved in Canada, the calls will stop for a month or so before starting up again. I didn’t just fall off the turnip truck so they just get hung up on.
So, the police ended up with the glittering prize 😆
I bet Muta got full chubbed when he said virtual machine
Lol
YYYEEEESSSSS. I HAVE SEEN THE GLITTER BOMB BEFORE.  THIS IS AMAZING.
Honestly dude you are awesome I worked in a real verizon phone room just handling verizon business accounts and scammers like that would make my job hell because people don't understand who they can and can't trust. So it's amazing to see how you went from screwing with them to helping victims then tracking and finding out how it fully work to now just attacking the middle man/women with marks glitter bombs!! NEVER GIVE UP NEVER SURRENDER!!
One of them called me right now. I had a good time messing with him. Lol
I won't fall into this scams... my "talking on the phone" anxiety protects me :T
Bravo. 👏  Still Bravo. 👏
11:23 You looked like Adam Sandler😁
you guys are destroying peoples  jobs . scamming is a job ~!
This is Amazing.
Keep up the good work man!
Do we have an update on that scammer
2 years ago my 72 year old grandmother got scammed $78,000. sadly she passed away year later.
Get the details of people who disliked this video to bust the scammers
This whole situation sucks but what hair dye did he use?
Vivian😄 always delivers👍
A true hero
I can just imagine all scam baiters join forces into letting a big scammer boss go to jail. it'd be so good!
THEN WHAT HAPPENED??! Jumping over to Mark's YT 💗
Hope to see glitter bomb in kolkata one day
Worth the wait Perogi! Well edited :) <3
Absolutely wonderful. As a fraud officer its awful to see how many get away with fraud, as the mechanisms just aren't in place to stop these crimes.
Vivian has such lovely hands.
Problem is, thats not a scammer. Thats just a courier. There is a network worldwide avoiding thebbamking system amd they uae this network to trqnsoort the scammed money. In most cases these people are victims or being bribed etc. The pqckages go all the way to someone with a better car and home than that poor unsuspecting person.
This was amazing. I started watching you last year and thought you are a wonderful person. You help so many people and bring awareness to everyone. I live in Canada and we have the same scams happen here and it is sad because so many people fall for them. Thank you for  what you do.
Have you tried pressing 5 or 6, 0 wounds it looks like they have sent. 400 million to you?
"These scams come in the form of a phone call and then a voicemail"  You forgot these same scams come as emails as well. As fake amazon receipts, windows expiration notices, macafee renewals, ect.
Lets goooo 💪😜👍
Love all you guys.ive personally been scammed.so fuck em all.keep it going guys.
All you guys are doing an amazing job , attacking these trashy scammers, keep up the good work. Love you all :)
I am strangely attracted to you in the Vivian costume 😂
Pierogi, don’t be so gullible. BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THE PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT WHO PROFITS FROM THIS SCAMS. They’re the enablers. And whenever you decide to do it, take good care of yourself and the people who helps you. I’ll be praying for your safety.
Epic! Good work mate! 😍
I put a similar message on a video of Jim Browning's. CBC Marketplace (Canadian Broadcasting Show) did 2 segments on online scams. They went to India and raided a tech support scam base. I don't know if you guys could get a hold of them but they are working with Canadian RCMP authorities to take down these operations. They may be open to reporting what you guys know or may help give additional resources!
Love from india
Mr P.you are an amazing man,thank you so much for the work that you do
It's so sad, so many times the elderly are too embarrassed to report these crimes, so they are doubly victimized.
the real hero
Is Pierogi like your name?
I had someone from "Microsoft" call me about a scam. I played the game for a while and was like ok let me log into MS and make sure oh look at that you're wrong. Wish I freaked out on them more.
EPICALLY BEAUTIFUL WORK  GENTLEMAN!!!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💪💪💪💪💪
Hey this is a random thought but what about developing some kind of software program that will allow all of us to do in someway what you do? Maybe we can’t do all of it but maybe we can each do a part or maybe we can flood their numbers. I get two calls a day every day that drives me nuts. I don’t know how to stop them I tried blocking the numbers but they call back using other numbers. Thanks again
I get a lot of these emails. I just ignore them. But if any of these scam busters want them, ill gladly forward them to you.
Hey brother thank you for your hard work! Really it’s not about all of us it’s about all that you have done. Thanks for exposing these crooked crooks.
I have a simple rule.  If I don't recognize the name on the caller ID, if there is no caller ID or if the caller ID just lists a city and state, I don't answer.  That's how I deal with scammers.
It cracks me up that they try to give an American/English name with their heavy accents.  They'd be more believable if they just used their natural name.
Started at Mark Rober, then Jim, and then here. Now I'm just waiting for the scammer to upload a video about this.
I don’t understand how could one dislike this video 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
"Steven Williams" with a Kolkata accent.
great job man
I do not know how else to say besides thank you,  last year my mother got hit by one of these scammers  and we were able to stop them from getting any of my mothers money simply do to the education I had from watching your content.  thankyou thankyou thankyou thankyou thankyou! education is key!
Excellent! Be Well!
They'll never call casue I live in sweden :D
great video.
I just can't understand how this type of scam managed to get so prolific; I often can't even convince the strangers to tell me the name of the street we're at, and those scammers from God knows where are making lots and lots of people buy thousands of $ worth of gift cards and send them overboard?! And this is a whole industry?!! WTF is this some kind of an alternate reality or sth?
What an amazing video and job your are doing!!! I am in awe!!! God bless you sir!! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!!
I am getting so much joy out of this ..thank you!! I worked for FedEx for 30 yrs.  I can’t tell you how many times I asked an elderly person if someone asked them to send them money.  This has gone on for many years.  Typically elderly don’t do on call pickups so when you got one and the person didn’t know who they are sending the package to was the red flag. They totally believe these scammers and I have had to ask to speak with one of their children.  I could have gotten fired for that...but then I wouldn’t accept the package. Our front counter would also ask at times.  They have tweaked this scam as technology has progressed.
nice work!
Amazing we love you
If you want the government to do something you have to make it their problem. Next time you talk to an irs scammer give him the address of an irs building and pray that the scammer swats the address do the same with ss scammers and DEA scammers and the government will have to step in especially if multiple people use this way of scambaiting
@marvel, I hope you're watching. This is what a real super hero is like!
I applaud you! 🤘🏼👏🏼!!
A huge THANK YOU TO YOU, Jim & Rob. Well done. They got my mother -in- law for 800.00 which is a lot for a  75 year old on SS. Rat bastards! Sorry not sorry for language. It’s pure evil. They get away with it because the government’s of Indian& USA don’t care. Their just as bad with “ their money laundering schemes!
9:27 when you basically rock any look 🌟
Your amazing dude! ❤️

I lived in India. I am not sure weather you meant you might go to India or your packages might even reach India.  But if you meant going to India yourself,  BE CAREFUL.  Most police can be bought.  That is why these call centers are so abundant.  Plus,  the police departments do not have much money to spend on these centers.
keep up the good work ! massive respect.
When you come to India you'll have a family to support you here ! Will fight this together
Great job all of you.  Bravo!
Ugh... recording herself opening it.... as proof for the other person/people. 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️😡
Manz started crying😂
Awesome video!!! Good work Pierogi and guys 👍❤️
I want to donate.
Keep up the good work brother 👍
Wow. Excellent. Keep it up...great vid.
you are awesome
I like the blue hair look Pierogi! Looks good
More features and coops! Love it!
Honestly a great idea for the glitter bomb. I hope this becomes a regular trend.
Great stuff Pierogi! Thanks for all that you do
You are a wonderful person. Thank you for bringing more good in our world. We need more people like you (and your team!!). Keep being you.
Your awesome!!
USE SHIFT + DELETE to permanently delete scammer files or they will be able to restore their data from Recycle Bin. I saw your previous videos and you simply deleted their files but they can easily recover them. Remember this next time, and tell scammers that there files are being permanently deleted...
You do great work! Thanks for everything!
female pieroci does not exist and cant hurt you
Scammer scamming someone: 😏  Mark, Vivian, and Tech Support Scams Pull Up: 😧
Would you guys ever consider going to schools and talk about this? If you would I would love to help in any way I could.
i can't love this enough.
Great video get those scammers
Would you guys ever consider going to schools and talk about this?
Vivian Rodgers ♥️😃😂🎈♥️😂😂
Instead of glitter, can you put car paint, a snake, or battery acid?
Good to see Mark Rober on board!
Reverse the connection and open a trojan on the scammers pc.
All right!! I made this suggestion on a video a while back n new it b amazing!! Great job man!!!! 👏
Would love to see more content like this❤️
Thank you for the video, but I was hoping to see you with Mark.  How did you determine this package was going to a scammer and not a victim mule?  And I am assuming very few people verify when at the bank to withdraw money that their accounts have not been affected?  Wish there were more guys like you fighting the good fight.
❤️
Jim Browing is the best!
You say you would like to go to India thus.. If the mountain won't come to Muhammad, Muhammad must go to the mountain.. Ya aware of Kiwi Bro..Karl Rock youtube.com/c/KarlRock/videos By connecting together along with others who're like minded..                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ALL GO0D.......
Thank u for what u do!!....my parents are elderly with health issues...they get multiple calls a day from scammers!!!...the scammers dont care...they r evil..!!!!!!
My scammers were 10 calls over 3 days, different number every time but telling me there was illegal activity on my internet.  I was told to press1 to talk to someone.  Obviously I did not, I then googled and saw it was a scam, press 1 and apparently you get connected to a premium rate line. I know this is different but just want to spread this info far and wide, do not press 1. I am in UK so just trying to warn others.
Congrats to the trio! And I hope you manage to become a department of scam in the US
you  know the only dislikes are scammers lmfao
You're barnet is on point my dude also any chance I can get vivians number? I'd tap that
Nice edits 👏🏼🔥
Reactjs logo spotted
Law enforcement and international governments, service providers need to make scamming cost. Meanwhile, thanks to all you people who are fighting back on behalf of the vulnerable.
Epic! Good work! We need more people like you guys out there. Especially people who are computer geniuses ! If I were a computer genius who could hide my IP and buy a new phone number and get a virtual machine. I would be calling and wasting scammers time and helping to put these people “behind the bar”
You are amazing I love what you do and your passion and support for everyone
New here, old viewer of Jim and Mark, they send me. All 3 of you do good work. Also, is Vivian single? She looks good for her age.
How does it feel knowing that you're more effective than the FBI?
Some heroes wear capes mine wears headphones and a Santa hat.
I love Vivian, especially when you start with the cooking lol, you the man Peirogi
Are there still banks that only use username/password? No MfA? ... or am i missing something
Dat Vivian Face Reveal. I'm dying!   Kidding aside, continue to fight on, Pierogi. If this YouTube thing you got going has helped even one or two would be victims, the effect will ripple across like a pebble thrown in the middle of the lake. Keep it up.
This is amazing 😂😂😂 the noise and the amount of glitter was amazing then with the coppers covered in glitter fucking golden!!!
Thanks so much for all the hard work. Here in Germany the whole Scamming gets more and more. Currently we get many text messages from "Amazon" with notifications like "delivery will be delivered soon". Another scam ist that they call and say you wanted to get information about investment options. When you ask how they got your phone number they hang up. Out of interest I talked to one person a bit longer and they used many investment buzzwords without knowing what they mean. At the end they wanted to show it to me on the computer where they of course needed remote access to explain it properly.
Amen brother keep doing gods work homie
I was babysitting my little nephews and the phone rang. Unless it is my sis or bro-in-law, I let their machine get it. Now... I never heard a message like this before & it threw me off. There were 2 male voices and 1 female, also a recording. They said they were calling for a "Jesse Schwab", it was very important he remove everyone from the room (children included) & answer the phone/call them back asap, it was a "debt call" & they were going to save him 50% of what he owes. 🙄😒 Caller ID read something like "spam alert" when I saw it. I am curious if anyone else has gotten this call. I mean - saying that "Jesse" needs to be alone, especially away from children when they talk, is a new one to me. Genius and pure scam move in my opinion. After they hung up finally, I replayed the message (my 10, 8, 6 & 4 yr old nephews were all there, 2-6 ft from me) to make sure I just heard what I thought I did. I have NEVER heard a message like this before, from a legit bill collector OR a scammer! But it was screaming "SCAM" clear as day! Anyone else get a BS call like this one?? 🤦
Nice job! Keep up the good work!!!
This is the big leagues!
This is the first video I found from you, and you've become my number one hero!
The funny thing is why are the tel com hiding these people...
F**k yea lets goooooooooooooooooooooooo
Definitely go to India. They do justice differently there. I was on a train in Rajasthan and this guy kept leering at all of the women in the carriage in a really disgusting way. Later on, the conductor came into the carriage, and maybe the guy didn't have a ticket either, because the conductor just started clobbering him with his fist and then kicked him out at the next stop. 😂
I got the Microsoft scam call about 5 years ago, I knew straight away it was a scam because I had a Mac!! I let them talk for a while and thinking that they probably wear headsets I picked up a referee whistle and blew it as hard as I could down the phone. It made my day 😂
Kitboga was needed
164 disliked this. That's a hell of a lot of glitter bombs to prepare!
Marvellous work  👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
*I didn't raise you this way*  LOL WTH!!! XD
as of the moment that this comment was posted 164 scammers have disliked this video. keep up the great work.
God bless y'all for y'all do!
POG
You boys are heroes. Give these clowns THE BUSINESS.
scuffed kit KEKW
can Vivian Rodgers be my grandma lmao
I have had a few phone calls claiming to be from HMRC (tax office in UK) and saying there is a warrant for my arrest for tax evasion  lol
Possibly unpopular opinion. I think these scammers need to get the death penalty or life in prison with no chance of parole.
The sad thing is ,if there wasn't evil in the world you guys wouldn't be ae to do the jobs you do
Please do some videos on LOVE SCAMMERS as well. Love scammers are also DANGEROUS. In Asia, they prey on Asian people's dream to be with white people. Many victims are usually women and gay men. I myself caught some and posted their profiles on related dating app but it's not enough because I can't expose or punish them. More and more love scammers show up. They typically only use a few "famous" photos which I have seen over and over again (not sure if they're the same scammers or not). One scammer evolves, he uses a photo of ordinary-looking older white man, instead of hunky model-like white man.   I usually try to get them into chat app, like whatsapp.... and make them get onto video call. Mostly reject it. But some will show amusing fake video calls... Such may be good materials for your channel. I hope you will consider to expand your scam-busting effort into the dating app. Thanks.
Good on all for bringing down these vermin!
The editing on this vid was crazy. Great video man
When he started crying all I heard was “Hello. I am under the water. Please help me”
At 9:41 https://youtu.be/J4mkZU2Y0as?t=581 That's the *cutest* smile :-o ...and those "come to bed" eyes! I think I'm in luuurv! :-) <3
bro why censoring their faces on the video? why not exposing the face of those nasty rats?
Fúçk dem scammers. Wish our cyber crime division was at least 10% active as you
OMG  when he started crying and called Vivian mom and told her to go to  the even when she said my legs. I   Love  when she tells the scammers she loves them
Hope you will also take down the scammers in our country if ever there was.
How am I just now seeing Vivian Rodgers?? I'm dying!! 🤣🤣
We all know mark rober is your brother !
Thank you for what you do!  Although all this time I had been thinking Vivian was a feisty red head!
Get them get them all and make them pay 💰
Indians man Indians
Congrats brother  ❤️
season 2 when?
instead sending glitter bomb how about an actual bomb? big brain moment hahahaha charr...
Thank God the ex nasa guy realized we have to fix earth first before we worry about bringing people to mars
It is great what u and the others do. I don't understand y u blurred out the woman cell cell, when the other person air it and u can see the woman video taping herself. u all need to get on the same legal page.
MOREEEEEEEEEEEEE
Pierogi is sooo handsome 😍😅
In Europe you need a three-factor authentication even if you are logging in to your bank account. Does that not exist in the USA?
This video is 🔥🔥 ❤️❤️ watched it a couple times
O—O)9
You are awesome 🥰 keep it up you’re doing great 😊
Thank you for all the good work you do.
I feel deceived. I thought Vivian was a BBW!
looking
Jim browning rocks!!!!
I'm going to recommend this channel to everyone I know. I even watch the ads. You're brilliant, Pierogi !
You just KNOW those 149 thumbs down are the scammers lmao!
Amazing cause! Thanks man 👍
Let's just hope those actually managing this in India get arrested too.
This is amazing, nothing makes me happier then justice prevailing!!!! You guys did a great job, your work is not unappreciated!!!
How people can get scammed by that very clear Indian accent. And by the way, why do every scammer have Indian accent?
I'm guessing all the thumbs down are the scammers watching this video ..
This is amazing thank you
I think if some scammer ever called me and started crying because he "accidentally" transferred $4000 to my account, I'd be like "Well, that sounds like your problem."
0:54 YES YOU!!
What kind of dickhead would give this a thumbs down
I wonder why there is no MFA to log in to online banking in US?  In Latvia there is such thing for any bank. Initially there were actual code cards with codes on them them and random code was asked on each login. Or there were actual code calculator devices. Nowdays mobile banking app is used as 2nd factor or yet another app on mobile phone. And that's not only for authentication, but also payments outside your account must be authorised by 2nd factor.
Heck ya brother. Been watching. Thank you!
Lol. The favicon for the fake bank is a standard icon from create-react-app. You need to change it dude, anybody with web development experience will recognize it in an instance.
I love watching ur videos I had a scammer the other day ring me and say my internet will be turned of if I didnt pay 4,000 within 24 hrs I knew this was a scam because I just spoke to my internet provider 20 mins earlier to sort out a 30 dollar credit I had thesse scammers will try everything to get peoples money I had to ring my elderly nana quick and warn her anyways love ur videos watching one now where scammer gives u 4 million LOL thesee scammers arnt all there in the heads lol
I am so proud of you,  great dedication.   I hope that the authorities start helping.
I’ve been victim to a lesser known scam and would like to draw awareness to that if you’d be interested in talking I got someone’s Facebook I know it’s not much but it’s a place to start I guess
Apparently 155 scammers didn’t agree with this video
I bet that scammer that always get scammed by scammer payback watching his videos now 🤣🤣🤣
Watched every single ad to support you. Great work!
I like how Vivian talks
Love the video, and the color of your eyes ngl
These people are disgusting! I’m sorry Perogi, you make a creepy girl! Great looking guy though.
You guy's are doing a great job exposing these scammers, but I don't understand how these people can be  scammed in the first place  since the scammers really can't speak or articulate good grammar and especially ask for gift cards or cash for payments, that in itself should rise a red flag.
This was the video that got me to sub this channel. Really excellent work that Mark, Jim, and Pierogi are doing. Hope their efforts do not go in vain. Certainly one fine day, we will wake up to find scamming eradicated.
Go get a napkin 😂🇦🇺
Love your videos. Just a tip, put some vaseline on your hairline or scalp when you dye your hair and it won't dye your skin.
Love this channel
What I dream of is a collaboration of the 3 of you to design an enormous glitter bomb drone, fly it through the window of a scam center, ignite it into a glorious room drenching wave of glitter, pump 12oz of nauseous, puke inducing fart gas and maybe a magnetic pulse generator  that fries the electronics for 50ft in every direction. OH , yea...cover the drone in industrial glue too...And somehow be able to live stream it as well. DREAM BIG! Start a Kick Starter. I'll throw in the 1st grand...LOL
This trio has saved at least 2 people over 5 figures in cash and maybe more.  I think this should be more of a long term team to beat the scammers.  Time the good guys fought back on the battlefield in the war against scammers. Keep up the good work!
Thank you so much for catching these scammers. It means a lot🥰😍 BTW, if you come to India, you are most welcome to my home. (I AM NOT A SCAMMER😅)
Glitterbomb?  Nope REAL bomb - level the grift.
👍👍👍
Dude,this was EPIC!!You just took it a level up.🤓👍👊
Didn't realise money mules were in Australia. Gonna now keep my eyes on them....
It really should be more important to our government.  Many of these suckers lose their whole life savings.
Please include in your next video that scammers have figured out how to Borrow real phone numbers and the owners of those numbers can also become victims! I was able to warn roughly 30-some people in the past 10 YEARS because I call the numbers back to the point the scammer disconnects from the number or the owner restarts their cellphone which reconnects the signal to whatever tech mumbo. I only know how this works because I've had the same number for the past 10 years and it's happened to me!  I can not Stress this enough! If you've had a 402(NE) number call you in the last 8+ years and it's a Woman's voice telling you to contact your provider ASAP because a scammer used Your private number to try and scam her, That was ME! This is REAL! Blocking phone numbers is causing More harm than good! Your not stopping the scammer by blocking or reporting the number anymore! I have met and talked to people who have blocked numbers by accident of family or friends because a scammer used their numbers. There have been a few businesses here that have had to change their numbers several times just in the last 4 years because the number was reported as a scammer number and in turn, the victim has to pay money to get a new number.   I always see people talking about how a scammer called them and the first response is "Well just block the number dude."  Ok, Blocking your friend's new cellphone number that you didn't have saved yet isn't going to fix the problem "Dude". The phone provider Knowing that a Scammer used Your number to try and scam someone on the other hand Will because then they can at least do tech stuff to hopefully put a Stop to at least 1 loophole that scammers have figured out how to do.
If I hated and wanted these scammers dead , am i a psycho?
🤣🤣🤣🤣The crying sound 🤣🤣
UPDATE:  the cop told him to have a good day
it always kills me that the fake bank’s favicon is the default react one like 😭😭 the fact that literally none of them have noticed really speaks to how little they know about tech considering a lot of them are “”working for tech companies””  anyway, i love this! thank you, jim, and mark for fighting the good fight
This is by far my most satisfying you tube viewing ever!
The 3 of you have enabled me to educate my customers so they are aware, a lot of them are older and a few almost fell for it. If not for your videos I wouldn't have been able to fully explain how these scams work. Thank you
5:03 hahahaha
Great vid vivian
Love these videos
This is the EXACT Documentary style I was talking about!!  Thank you for listening to me and taking my advice of my idea!! YOU ROCK!
Thank you! Please never stop! I have loved ones who have been repeated scammed. God bless you guys.
A glitter bomb package sent to the scammer call center in India - now that would be something! A jumbo-sized package to really stink up the place and cover all the scammers with glitter.
Omg this scammer seems to be a pretty high class lady. who would've thought?
Pierogi, you are the hero this world needs right now!! This was incredibly epic and I hope we see more scammers get sent to jail as time goes by. Bravo, my friend!! 👏👏👏👏👏
Can you clarify, should we allow them to get far enough to control the computer?
Porch piracy is a whole profession in the USA. Course are taught even at the Trump University Lol
This is what’s happen when you sub out phone services to India
Stealing packages is a thing most people in 3rd monde countries would do. Stop letting 3rd monde people in and packages will not be stolen. Just kidding, many locals do that too.
3:25 do u have a googel chrome?
And these things only happen because Darwin evolution no longer works on some people. If there weren't people without weak mental faculties this would not happen.
Thank you man your doing amazing work theses scammers and scam sites are terrible and need to be destroyed
Most satisfying glitter bomb yet!
There is one fantastic video. Great work man 👌👍🏻
What voice changer do you use? I want to use it.
We should just send normal fragmentation bombs. Boom. Problem solved
That was awesome, I appreciate you. Thank you for helping people!!!
No don't go to India bro they will kill you please don't go😕😳
Yea the glitter bomb is f*cking awesome
They way my sisters and I are crying laughing at your videos!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂 I love Vivian!
Just, Thank You:)
Thank you and Jim ... my mother was scammed $25,000 and it was horrible ... My mother wanted to kill herself ... and then scammer was from messenger off fb. And she sent the money in a cashiers check to Illinois... over a 3 month period .. they left her with not a dime to her name and she took cash advances from credit cards ... it was devastating... so thank you so much for what you do !!!! Keep it up ...
Scammer: you have to help me, I will be losing my job SP: *takes sip of Starbucks*
I'll confess I'm no criminal mastermind, but I'm pretty sure airport and postal xray machines don't have any issue seeing through tin foil.... and if it did, they'd just open the bloody thing because they'll be suspicious... Right? Are the scammers also banking on their victims being too wound up to think about that?
You taking applications i can be one who confronts them good job buddy
If they said they'd get fired, I'd be like "Ha! That sounds like a YOU problem. Byee!"
Keep fighting. Can't believe the dislikes though. I bet those are from the scammers and the mules and rge supervisors of the scams
Hi I am an absolute fan and also want these scammers to be put behind bars, I follow Jim Browning as well as Karl Rock from India. I am very ashamed as a Indian cause these are happening from India particularly from Kolkata where I live in.  Let me know if can be of any help to crack down these scammers from Kolkata as the hub Park Street is just 6 miles from my house. I can be reached @ suman_tutu@yahoo.com
crying steven lmao
That was literally a the worst cry I have ever heard lol
Loveeeee all what you do!! KEEP DOING JUSTICE!
VIVIAN ROGEEEEERS THE ONE, THE LEGEND!
Love it too funny to see them go down. I try and teach anyone i know about scammers especially my older family members that dont understand about scammers and such but you make the real difference keep it up.... Mark is also another favorite of mine.. Love the blue BTW
Fuck! You really got him caught!! Not all heroes wear capes.  Thanks to you, Jim and Mark. Respect.
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I'd be baby-scammer-level LYING if I said I didn't have chills. 😂 we love you, dude.
My gosh dude this is epic... no wonder you were losing sleep
Vivian still looks like a beautiful young lady lmao
Centimeter Peter is probably the most simple funniest name I’ve ever heard 😂😂😂😂
I would love to see all these three along with Karl rock(of course they would be stormed with fans here) but u know that'll maybe cause an impact and such a big blow to the system here that it is so helpless and crippled that guys from overseas have to come here to sort things out....I just love what ur doing and all the viewers .....I request u to understand that all indians are not like these scammers(who themselves wouldn't be doing it if they were literate)...india has so much more and it's a shame that u have to see all this coming from India...hope u understand... thanks...
"I love you too Peter" 🤣 Thanks for making me pee a little at my office desk
You are doing the Lord's work. Thank you!
That was cool but would have been cooler if it were a nail bomb
Why does the dude in the thumbnail look like DanTDM
This man is a blue haired hero ❤️
You are awesome!
Stop saying Loving On Me, sir
great stuff, but id advise against going to India to try to catch these guys. these are multi million dollar mafia operations and they would hesitate to kill you to protect their business.
ALL THE 144 DISLIKES ARE SCAMERS LMAO
Anyone naming themselves after the national dish of Poland is a friend of mine! ♥  Love, a Polish/Metis Canadian
Still think that air bnb knows too much.
Finally this vedio is out
Thank you
It's not just a problem in USA or UK, it happens everywhere, and to everyone who are 50+. Authorities need to take these crimes seriously. They're stealing our hard earned money.
How do I learn how to do all of this?!  I'm bombarded by these calls and would love to get them back!  All I can do now is tell them they're calling a government phone.
great work keep up
Not just 3 guys. New age Avengers!
Good work man 🤘
Iam from india hope u come here .. there r many scammers here😭..
Dude these scams are getting nuts. I was contacted by police in another state for something he's not being very clear about yet, but I think my phone number has been used to scam people. He told me they have a victim out $600. I'm also still verifying the legitimacy of the "police officer" as I've only emailed him. This is sketchy bub.
Did the mule even get arrested?
Thanks for all you do 🙂 my coworker got several calls from Social Security stating if she doesn’t call them (scammers) right away she will be charged with severe crime. I just loved listening to her to out smart those stupid psycho people and reveal that they got the wrong person to mass with 😂
It makes me really happy to finally see the police be involved in stopping those evil parasites.
You guys are so awesome! I get the biggest kick out of this. You guys must be crazy smart
Keep up the great work Pierogi!!
perfect  !!
LOVE IT!!!!
Cringe
Vivian is so pretty!!!
Jim browning is cyber jesus
These scammers won't stop calling my phone!
Yeah i NEVER get why people don't care about these scams like this is so insane!!
Too heavily edited lol
I found this channel because of mark rober. Been my binge for a week now!
Remember, the Indian gov and police are very corrupt.
you guys are amazing :) Great work you guys!!
If there are any scam baiters in this audience in the comment section right now I have the address and the coordinates of an Indian scam call center if anybody wants it let me know
You are a real superhero
But wait, what happened to the money mule? What was the sentence?
I've spent the last 10+ years baiting the criminal telemarketers with only the occasional scammer. But they often are the same call center vermin. My channel "Cheap Bastard" has many of the calls. If you ever go to India, count me in.   I want to come with you.
"you have to help me or otherwise i will lose your job" screw your job, nobody cares about your job, letalone, it isn't even a job, scamming is not a job
"you have to help me or otherwise i will lose your job" fuck your job, nobody cares about your job, letalone, it isn't even a job, scamming is not a job
These scammers are actual human scum.
Now THAT'S a video I can share!!!
Dubloo dubloo dubloo dot
all of the dislike,s are the scammer's hehehe
This man does Gods work
I love this channel! You’re doing amazing work. Thank you so much.
Banks should have the page (or page contents) refresh every x seconds so their edits would not work
I was waiting for this! Also oh my god that desktop-  I wonder thought... why is HTML even editable?
Good lord that is not at all how Vivian Rodgers looks like in my head.
AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great work Pierogi. Keep it up. But I have one question. As you and other anti-scammers like Kitboga continue to push back against these scumbags, do you have any concerns that the organized crime heads behind these scammers might start going after you one of these days?
I can just imagine Kitboga crying alone in the corner while the cool kids team up for this amazing collab'
Cheers from Australia...
i want to turn my channel into a scammer thinggy lol i would never know how to start though
Video of the YEAR!
I dig the hair, homie
I bet all scammers are all scared of you three especially vivian

Lovin the blue 🙌🏻
I came to this channel through Mark Robers glitter bomb videos (I love engineering and science). You actually shouted me out (and a ton other fans) in a live stream for coming from his channel. So, thank you so much for that. That was so cool. Since that live stream, I've watched a bunch of your videos, starting from when you first made the channel. All of your videos are hilarious and amazing. I love the subtitles, the animations, when you piss off the scammers, when you translate hindi to them, of course deleting files and everything else. I've also seen videos where you've saved victims in the moment and ones where your fans donated over $30,000 to a woman named Susan. You are so humble and sweet. You, Jim browning, Mark Rober and everyone else who helps prevent or get back at scammers are all doing amazing work. You're helping so many people, bringing awareness and are entertaining as well. Again, thank you for your work and time and patience.
Man, you're the best...all of you. Thanks for the  wonderful job you guys are doing fighting those parasites. Keep going!
I've seen people who have seen videos from jim browning, kitboga, and scammer payback. They know it happens... But some of them are so unfamiliar with computers that even watching the videos they have no idea what's happening in them and so don't understand how to recognize when they're being scammed.  It's unfortunate. I'm not saying people shouldn't have computers... But we give people computers have no clue what's doing on with thier computers and then give them access to an entire world where they can be suspectable to anything known as the internet.  Your speech of everyone needing to wake up is the truth. Some people don't understand that just because your computer is a box sitting in your home doesn't mean the entire world can't access it...  Thank you for everything you guys do and never stop fighting this battle!
Kudos. Well done.
Love this content! I love messing with scammers when they call. Blue hair looks good dude! 🍻
What would he hilarious, instead of just deleting files from a scammer’s computer, you need to figure out a way to upload a bunch of gay porn!   That would be hilarious!!!!
could you explain where they get the money they use to scam first from
i find it hillarious, the other day i commented on one of marks videos saying him and, those bombs, and kitboga, you and trilogy media (i think was the other group) you all could do some real, true damage to these guys, and not 2 days later this video.
I had no idea that you are so beautiful Vivian 💞.  Except the 5 o'clock shadow, that was a little unbecoming. Hahaha 🤣
IN ALL THE YEARS YOU , BROWNING AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN DOING THIS , JUST EXACTLY HOW MANY SCAMMERS HAVE YOU HELPED GET ARRESTED , CHARGED AND SENT TO JAIL ? HAVE YOU 3 GONE TO YOUR POLITICIANS , YOU DO HAVE SENATORS IN THE US DONT YOU , WITH THE NEW PRESIDENT , WHT DONT YOU 3 TRY AND SPEAK TO HIM OR HIS OFFICE .HERES HOW YOU WIN !! WHEN THOSE FUCKING ASSHOLES IN INDIA ARE BEHIND BARS , UNTIL THEN , THEY WILL KEEP ON CONNING PEOPLE & IF THAT HAPPENS , THE BLAME MUST LAY AT THE FEET OF POLITICIANS.
Yeah scammers should be killed!
good job gentlemen.
You rock!
Cross-dressing... great. (unsubscribed)
Is there a way you guys can spam-call, robo-call their scam centers, non-stop, 24 x 7 x 365?  If their lines are tied up with spam, then perhpas that would impede their operation.  If they change number, no big deal..update the robo-dialer: lather, rinse, repeat.  I don't know, maybe it's not practical.   Alternately, the flash-mob approach could be applied - flood-call them - an old-school analog DDOS.  Enlist a thousand people to call them all hours of the day for a block of time, over and over again.  Turn the tables on them.  Return the "favor" and blessing of spam calls to their scam centers.  You don't even have to say anything.  Let them hang up and call right back.
Well done brother lots of love from India if you need any help from my side please do let me know. Thank you.
It's all coming together
You are ALL amazing!  Thank  you for all you do every single day to help unwitting victims and expose these vile thieves!!  PS. Pierogi, your nails and lipstick are ON POINT!
If you want to go to to India to get to the source, y'all need to get in touch with Alex Goldman from the Reply All podcast because he did just that. It was an awesome series of episodes and these scams are so much worse than they first appear.
Shame you can't use anthrax
OMFG!  Pierogi, is that you in drag!?  Holy Cr@p!  HAHAHA!!!!
You boys definitely need recognition for this! It's all I'm watching on YouTube just now, it's just fantastic the caring hearts you have! This is starting to missing in the youth of today!
The issue is the demographic watching this video aren't the victims. This PSA doesn't reach the older generation unfortunately.
Way to go!
We appreciate you. Well done.
Extremely informative and production quality is top notch. These scammers run the same process and should be a reflag to all people who come across these lowlifes.
don’t f with vivian f*cking rogers
More power bro, keep that scammer in jail...from Philippines.
Ur Awesome !!!!!
That was awesome. You are awesome! I love messing with scammers. Thanks for all the tips and hindi curses! Haha
The new logo is fireeeee.   Love everything you're doing.  Keep up the good fight 💪
Honestly I think scammers are among the lowest of the low. They’re literally human garbage.
Pierogi this is amazing. I love when you and Jim link up. Thank you for all you do. We love you! 💙
You are a beautiful human being,  thank you for all the work you do.
They always call my boss claiming to be Canada revenue. He screws with them for a couple hours everytime giving them a fake alias. It's always a blast walking in on him asking them if they've ever been caught having an affair with their cousin.   They tried with me once, I told them I was being garnished by the government so if they wanted more to send a sheriff. The end result of that was a click on their end.
ATM 132 dislikes, Hmmmm, wonder who that whould be.
Wow!!!
I love that you sing Congratulations 🎉🎊🍾🎈
You don't need to hide Jim because we all know who he is and his YT Channel. Jim also uploads this kind of video with you and Mark collab with the scammer and the money mule. I hope this will end soon because a LOT of innocent people will be victims of these scams.  Anyways Keep safe and please do subscribe to my little youtube channel :)
I love Vivian!
Go Go Glitter Rangers!!
Excellent! Must have been so rewarding!
my mother is mother
Perogie I've been a fan a long time. This is incredible video. Tell Arthur and Vivian we says hi! Keep up the good work. You're using this platform in such an incredible way.
I thought we were gonna see the glitter bomb be opened in those scammers call center !  :| sad :P
We love you!😘
OMGOSH thank you so much for this and for the hard work. This is definitely a channel that’s worth my subscription ✅👍🏽 God bless!
Absolutely amazing! You guys do such amazing work and we're all proud and grateful for what you want do #weareallscambaiters 💕
You guys are so fantastic!!  Thank you for continuing to fight so hard!  We’ll always be here to support you however we can! 💙
Off topic, I know, but does anyone know what brand of blue dye he uses?  I LOVE the color; it’s exactly what I want for my hair! 💙💙💙
We need a documentary
Brilliant.
Some Indian guy tried to get me to get him $100 in Google play and I told him to go fuck himself. He then called back 5 times lol
You guys deserve to be recognized as heroes. i've made this comment on the other two channels and i absolutely stand by my statement.
THIS !!!  You and your team rock, kiddo!!
Thank you all for helping innocent people out
You are an outstanding incredible man. You and your crew are absolutely amazing. I cannot thank you enough for all the dedication and all the hard work that you do to expose these assholes. Police don’t even and they know what’s going on and they see what’s going on and they don’t even take care of this . These scammers need to be brought to Justice! Bless you all
I can't thank you enough for all of your hard work.  I love that the 3 of you have teamed up.  The FBI/Homeland Security need to pay you a BOUNTY for each scam you shut down.
Goddamn, three years to catch one Supervisor?  Real change needs to happen. A task force supported or funded by the government is needed. You three proved it isn’t impossible to find these guys. Why can’t the government, with their budget and manpower, do anything about scammers?
Thanks again for all you do! I get these calls all the time and love to fuck with those bastard slugs when I have a few minutes. I also made my 84 year old mother watch your videos to know to just hang up!
Watched the first 2 so I knew this was going to b good the Vivian part had me laughing and karma caught up with that mule even if she was covered in glitter 👍
Iv been waiting for this i saw marks video and couldant wait for this
Keep up the great work. Awareness is key.
Have you thought about spreading the love and teaching how you do this?  The more people like you the better.
Why blur the faces of these scum bags???  Their faces need to be seen!  Actions have consequences!
Great job. Thanks for caring.
You should try counting the zeros out loud and see how they add more zeros
Great stuff
Lol, @ them getting out the car with glitter all over them and talking to the police..
Who are the 125 people that disliked this?  Scammers most likely
Vivian Rodgers strikes again!
good catch! i just wish you hadn't blurred their face! let the world see who these scum bags are! 🤣🤣
this is so so good! I love it! thank u pierogi for letting us all know what kind of horrible things and people out their and for fighting against them.. Couldn't stop laughing as you were dressed as vivian Proud of all of you guys definitely a pat on the back! much love.
125 people in Kolkata did not like this video.
A scammer phoned me up a couple of days ago claiming to be from the NBN network. I couldn't be bothered with my usual response so I just told her to go and f**k herself.
I'm in india. Come here. Keep fighting. I'm with you.
Can’t wait for the video where you, Mark Rober and Jim Browning walk into a scammer’s office in India and confront the scammers with a camera crew.
Now I’m paranoid
Already watched marks, watching Jim's next.   I firmly believe that boomers aren't ment to suffer like this. So thank ypu fam for the work you do.
Love Vivian's 5 o clock shadow
Thank you, White Hat!
If I would learn that a scammers family starved to death because they couldn't make enough money scamming I would be be ecstatic 😊
no it's about what YOU did, terrific!
Scammers check under their beds for Jim Browning before they go to sleep. Loved the trilogy btw, 3 absolute legends at work here 👌🏻
Keep up the good work!
So proud of you Pierogi and happy to support you! Much love.
Maaan thank u for ur service! I am with u!  Also, there are scammers hacking into Facebook accounts & they are pretending to be my family members & my best friend's family members.  I am fighting against that whomever comes across me. Thank u for teaching me.❤❤❤❤
Stephen is using a voice changer. Do the scammers do that now?!
Aww I wanted to see her in cuffs
As much as I hate to be prejudiced, if I get a call with an Indian person on the other line I just totally distrust whatever he tells me.
I wanna see a video of when the scammer starts the "omg I gave you 50k instead of 500" bullshit the person just says "oh wow thanks" and acts like they're going to hang up.   I wonder what the scammer reaction would be
Love you man-  great job to you and Ms. Pierogi
India is  disgusting
I keep getting voicemails for a car warranty and I’m like: “Umm I’m not old enough to legally drive boss”
Great work man!
Thanks you for what you do
Huge well done,  (That Vivian Rogers drag act was brilliaint:) and I grinned so much at the end.
u truly deserve so much more recognition and views! what u do continues to be incredible! ❤️
Excellent team-up!  It is such a great sorrow that the ingenuity used for scams is not applied to more honest work.  Some parents have failed to teach the value of honesty.
Well done.
You, Jim and Mark are doing God's work
You guys are so awesome, you truly inspire me!! Love your hair 😍
You guys ROCK! Thank you I love your channel!
Is there perhaps a short video you could make for old people or one you could suggest. I like the content but it’s mostly confusing to my relatives
More singing!!!!! 🤣🤣
**Him in his grandma voice** My husband won’t be happy.   **Scammer** f ur husband
You’re the best  buddy
Hey! I am an honest scammer and stealing is bad and illegal so just send me your money please?  I promise I won't waste it on gacha games.
I absolutely love your videos. They are the best.
These people are sick fucking sociopaths.
My elderly mother is getting the Amazon scam phone call almost every day in North Carolina, and also receiving scam calls about someone messing with her social security. We've taught her to just hang up on them but it still worries me that they'll get to her some how...
Well done you guys!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I just became a subscriber to your channel.  I love this collaboration you did with Mark and Jim.  I truly believe you three will be a catalyst to ending phone scams all together.  Bravo!  I applaud you!  👏👏👏👏👏
they can never call me. i dont have a phone
YEAH! MORE! I LOVE THIS! I wish we could all bust scammers.
you have helped my mother of 75 not get scammed by watching your vids thank you
I love how you two teamed up! Hilarious. I need to look up Jim too now.
Scammer here watching to find u 😂
You’re the best!
You know I have ZERO patience  for this kind of online crap. It takes forever to correct anything online by the legitimate people_companies
This is amazing. Y'all are amazing! I would LOVEEE for y'all to go to India & catch more of these mofos! 💙💙💙
Thanks for doing this. cicncerely yours, an old guy
You are a real man Pierogi, I believe in you.
3:31 Dablu dablu dablio
Thank you for what you are doing
i just have to say yasssss
Tea
I know a lot of the people who get scammed are older and trusting and have that empathy, but man, there's one part of these scams where I always want to be a fly on the wall. And that's the part where the scammers fudge the refund amount and it's like "Ma'am, you accidentally put 4,000 instead of 400. You need to fix this or else I'm going to lose my job."  I just wonder how many old folks actually just go "Well, sucks to be you!"
Any chance you can help me I recently got scammed
You ever wonder if any of the scammers watch you guys?
This is the video we all needed and all knew we needed
Just realized that all that glitter went off in someone's air bnb. That mule has a lot of explaining to do! Lol
congrats 🍾 its been a amazing journey cant wait too see more  arestted or wven see them go through criminal court would be great
Ladies and gentlemen....
In short don’t awnser the phone if you hear somebody with a Indian accent
oh hi mark
Keep up the good work you are amazing 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Brilliant work, Pierogi. 👏🏼 💙🧡🙏💙🧡 First class editing too. 🙌🏼 I never knew Vivian had a 5 o’clock shadow. 😉#SomeHeroesHaveKeyboardsNotCapes #WeAreAllScambaiters
@8:30 Yes I am crying because I am benchode!
And Kit Boga gets left out....... I know you are both similar..... i know you compete, truth is..... we dont care! the more people like you screwing with scammers the better off the world is.
When any of you wonder how much money these dudes make from these videos just take a good look at the 10:00 min mark.......
Certified bad asses!!!!!!!!!!!!
come on bro we all love you 😢
The glitter bomb is hands down our path to retribution for these low-life criminal losers.
Vivian Rogers 👌👍 Great works you guys... Thank you for everything that you are doing.. I'm Indian and it really feels good to see the evil sickos being blocked in every way possible...
Absolute legends all of you! Keep on keeping on!.
Pierogi dressed as Vivian is the best thing I’ve seen all month
Ug! No Bronx. My.neighbors r high or weird. Lol.
10:15 RIP Vivian's nail. Pour one out.
Nothing but respect for what you do.
Nailed the assholes!!!
Keep up the good work bro 👍
So you show others content. And get views and paid. Wow
ᶜᵃⁿ ᵃⁿʸᵒⁿᵉ ˢᵉᵉ ᵐʸ ᵗⁱⁿʸ ᶜᵒᵐᵐᵉⁿᵗ ?
battery: 2% me watching other videos and battery: 0% watching Pierogi's videos and battery be like: i'll wait :)
Hey thank YOU for the great work!
You have to be so proud of this, such an amazing thing you are doing for people , Thankyou xx
I'm so glad you all are doing what you do, with skill and brains and tenacity - listening to these scammers lie to, manipulate, yell at, and steal from people who are only targets because they're kind, trusting, and vulnerable people works me into a rage. I'm a non violent person, but it's the kind of rage that makes me want to pay back the scammers with skull fractures and missing thumbs. Sadly, revenge fantasies don't help victims, but you guys really do. It's so wonderful.
The long awaited Mark Rober/Pierogi/Jim Browning collaboration. The universe is beautiful now.
You fucking legend
I am so happy that you used a glitterbomb! I hope to see more in your videos, they seem quite effective haha. Good job :)
props to all 3 of you x
*Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap* You're all *THREE* *HERO"S*.....

I’m both turned on and scared that I’m turned on by Ms. Vivian Rodgers lol
9:36 Disturbingly aroused by Vivian Rodgers 😮😮😮
No, thank you! Well done.
Great job!  Thanks for investing all this effort to protect people you don't know!
How does he not have 1 mil subs?!
Next time you should use weaponized anthrax instead of glitter.
that chick with the blonde hair putting the money in the box - she got a sister?
Vivian doing the lords work
Prison Break.
that was awesome keep up the great work !!!!
I love all the scammer payback guys and girls ,me my family and friends will never get scammed because of you. The awareness you bring helps so many people, lots more than you know .    . ❤️🇦🇺❤️✌️✌🏾✌🏻✌🏿
Absolutely wonder news, you are fabulous!!
You know its real easy to stop all this. These remote services programs can just cease all activity in India and or put in freaking protocols that prevent this....
go get 'em "Vivian" !!
🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
dublu dublu dublu dot
💪🏼 💪🏼 💪🏼
Loving the blue hair!
So are you and Mark going to investigate the kik and dating app scams? I reported accounts to the dating app developers but now I kinda wanna follow up on it.
👍
Oh seeeiit! I know it said glitter bomb in title, but had no idea u were gonna be using that insane glitter bomb from that dudes video. That thing is genius! Love what both u guys do!
WOW!!!!!! Congratulations........ you guys are the greatest!!!!
With as many times scammers have called you, one would think that they wouldn’t call your phone number anymore.
I love playing with these baby's👶 just the other day apple  support called an i said yes i like a dozen apples that guy said huh i said your with apple subport right he said yes an i said again i want a dozen apples an there was a pause an i ask if he was still there an his said yes an then i ask him how many gift cards they need an he hung up 🤣
Oh, I love the glitter bomb!  I wish everyone had them. lol
Hopefully there will be a conviction we need a precedent to get the enforcement ball rollin
So did only one girl get arested?
Man, they should try this in Singapore, cos 90% of incoming international packages are opened and inspected. Wonder how they'd get past all the customs here
You're awesome.  Thank you. ❤❤❤
It would be awesome if u made like a tutorial video for us who aren't super tech savvy, on how to make a fake bank account page so we can have fun too. I would love to waste these people's time & get em all psyched up on all the "$" I have
Great work, P! 😀👍🏻
Your awesome!  bless you and your family.  I watched one yesterday that 3 of you got the money up and pay this lady back for  the evil Animal that did that to her... Plus the roses and you  checked her new computer too. god bless, be safe. Truly appreciate all of you and your  friends helping people.
Ok P-man! Loved watching all 3 of these! Well done sir and thanks for fighting the good fight!
The 3 Musketeers of Scammer Pay Back:    Jim, Mark, & Perogi
You Mark and Jim are heroes, mention to Karl Rock as well
I get these calls at least once a week and they just keep calling and they keep yelling at me as I laugh!!!
Where you get scammer payback hat from? 🤔
Great collab! I found you from Jim Browning by way of Mark Rober! Subbed to all 3 now b
I just wanna go after the head person who's still trying to scam us after my oldest child was in a car accident 2yrs ago. I remembered something odd that happened the day after my childs surgery, the room phone rang, but I couldn't answer the phone, and nurses weren't sure how someone called when no one said what that phone number was to that room yet. The fact one of the addresses from the bill goes to a fedex location and the person had a thick accent from India, and the person asked for info I knew was a red flag (glad I said no), has me wanting to find out and put a big dent in this issue!
Keep Up the Great Work
God bless you guys for this
i seen their parts first, but was most excited about your portion of this collaboration
Suggestion to Mark Rober for the next device. Whether it's for porch pirates or phone scam mules, it should NOT be a "glitterbomb." That's way too cute. You'll increase your subscriptions tenfold (and increase the satisfaction of your subscribers) if you use the same technology modified slightly to create a "Vomit Slinger" or a "Turd Tosser," using actual biological material. Do it!
your hair is blue
Your Not ordinary guys, your idols, people like yourselves and Jim Browning got me into scambaiting
Thank you all for putting your knowledge to good use. It’s good to see these scumbags stopped. It’s sad that kind unsuspecting people are trampled on like that. God bless you
Solid Stuff here. Have you contacted James OKeefe at Project Veritas? Just a thought.. carry on with the great work!
Does the home alone actor have an above average resistance to bad smells? The way you said "not even" he could stand the smell lol
OF course we love you and your amazing talent going to save so many peoples savings. Be blessed always.
They give new meaning to the words "the crying game."
I have been following you for over a year.. By far this is the best video ever released in my opinion..  So proud to be a member of the Scammer Payback Family!!! Much love Pierogi!!!
Woah you have the same name as a polish food
*She jumps out of the car and plays the dumb card.. Officer, I don't know whats going on! I haven't done anything!   **#ScumBags* #WishGlitteraGotinHerEyes
I have some older friends and they keep falling for these things I keep telling them you don't even have an account but they can't understand that the calls are not real. It really pisses me off. Can you attack Amazon prime scammers? This is the one most used.
"Don't be intimated by him... Just imagine him as a woman." 9:24 "Oh no! He's hot!"
Vivian ROCKS!!! You three guys are amazing, Keep up the Awesome Work!!❤️
I received 3 phone calls day before yesterday i didn't pick up because the numbers were out of this world so immediately i report the numbers and bolked them. I can tell they are after me hahaha.
I work in the call center for FedEx SameDay services. I can assure you that these criminals are now trying to use our service to perpetuate their schemes. (MUCH higher cost to the victim than regular FedEx, but they would get their ill-gotten gains the same day.) We are trained to look out for signs of such frauds, but occasionally one will get through. We have interceded in several attempts, and we work with authorities to return the money to the victim and apprehend the scum. I can't go into the tip offs for us for security reasons, but know that there are people who do try to help you in this fight. Kudos to you all!
Awesome!!!
Thank you for all you do. Love the blue hair.
Great work!
So what became of the money mule after the police apprehended her?
Need to get Kitboga in on helping you guys
Those who dislike your videos were scammers
Oh another awesome Florida man! I’m here in Floriduh too!
Mark Rober! :)
Always support the person that uploads their colab video the latest if you like the colab :).
This only happens to windows users
*We’re in the Endgame now*
gg man keep going 👍👍❤
Time for me to call my elderly mother and have the talk with her. Thank you!
You guys are the shit. I wish this was an endeavor legions of people could inbark on. Unfortunately a hand full people could make a dent but I don't think it would ever end the war. Love what you guys are doing. Keep on fighting!!!
All the spelling errors should also be a huge red flag!
Vivian is such a Qween 👑👠💅
Some heroes don't need capes!!
The honey thing is frigging hilarious.  What’s more funny is when the say it back to you. 😂😂
Vivian Rodgers will go down as a legend
Yes!!! Thank you!!!
It was great to see all three vids. Loved the colab between all of you and the different approaches.  Love to y'all
You should totally try to compile a modified version of Chromium with the Chrome logo and name but without the inspect feature. Would be really interesting to see how the scammers tackle that obsticle.  Another idea is to obfuscate the balance in the html code, possibly have the web server generate png files for the balance. 😁
104 scammers didn't like this video!
Viviannes nails fell on the table lol!!!
Yes love that you teamed up with Mark and got some of the scammers! Nice work!
thank you pogi keep  doing what yall doing
You absolute legend!!!!
Is it possible that there are 'Organised crime' elements using 3rd world based Scam Call centres that have been set up to sell Scamming services using some form of SLA?  If that is the case, is it possible that there could be some form of Scam SLA selling black market place similar to silkroad operating in the darkweb?  There could be agents set up in each country acting as go betweens for scam service 'SLAs' attracting business from and enforcing cintracts with money laundering syndicates using mules reporting to supervisors who are in turn report to syndicate heads...who in turn pay kickbacks to reps in charge of scam SLAs who then pipe out the money to the call centres + leads?  That way, no two operations ever need to know about one another per state/country/wherever...and the scam call centres make a steady but appreciable return with the only requirement being to keep governmental officials quiet.
😂😂😂😂💙😂💙✊🏽
Love the vids keep it up
No I understand why nobody could tell me what happened to crying Steven. Great ending.
The blue hair looks good.
I am so happy and blessed that more and more people are becoming aware of these scams! Good work to all involved!
Hell yeah dude! I'm new to the channel, but I live what you do and wish I could learn how to do what you do to the scammer scum(maybe someday I'll be able to). But for now, I guess watching and sharing your videos is the least I can do.
Hey it's Elon
Congrats to all of you!
Bro that hair... Did you lose a bet?
I would love if you showed us a tutorial on how you find their location, delete their files, and such. So we can defend ourselves from scammers
You are real hero's in my book!!!!
@Pierogi -  I LOVE you and the other modern day Robin Hoods! Thank you Mr. Pierogi and The Scammer Slap-Up Super-Best Friends.🤣👍👍
Thanks! Shared this with my Dad
If you think about it like scammers will really become less powerful cause like this generation is full of technology
WHO'S that FOXY lady @9:25?!! Hahaha 😘
Thank you
THANK YOU!!!! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!!
Maannn, YT did a really good job on putting every step of the story on my wall !! Thank you soooo much for your work !! respect from Quebec !
What an awesome video! Great work!!! Thank you for your efforts!
My hometown Pearland tx 🤦🏻‍♂️😐...
You are so amazing! Thank you for sharing what you do with the world. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
You need an undercover mule.
Wow, Vivian Rogers has aged so well! She must have a killer skincare regimen. Maybe she bathes in scammer tears.
Thank you for all your work!
I love the new partnerships! I so want to get in on this, as it's right up my alley. My only problem at the moment is I am having serious trouble with my voice 😞. I originally made this channel to debunk flat Earthers, and Sovcits, but alas, the same problem. Hopefully I will get better at some point.
This happened in my hometown pearland texas lol
Thank you payback scammer for showing me what to do to fix these scammers..
Just had one tonight from FB I knew he was so I just wound him up. thanks you young ones for teaching us oldies what to look out for
Thank you
KING PIEROGI RULING THAT CORNER  Bless Up Fella :)
Now we just need Real World Police to pull the body/dashcam footage of the arresting officer.
Your passion is absolutely beyond me, the amount of time you put in aswell as the unconditional love and effort you have to do this, I'm a family man with children and wish I could afford to support this channel but I can't, but I would love to donate Thankyou pierogi and your team My biggest question is WHY ARE THE POLICE AND AUTHORITIES SO DAMN LAXY DAZY ABOUT THIS, that rings alarm bells to me ❤️❤️🇬🇧🇬🇧
Fucking shit lmaoooo, the way hes crying 😂😂😂😂
Those unlikes are prob the scammers or the scammers friends/family. The likes are the people who appreciate you and thinks scamming is wrong, for example, me.
Yes yes yes keep exposing these people, what they are doing is so wrong and is a major problem. Justice prevail
Amazing Pierogi!! 🤩
Literally as I'm watching this I got a scam call from the "social security administration."  Asked for my SS# ... yeak OK LOL
Great work guys! 💪
Amazing job brother, keep up the good fight!
"So ma'am, what exactly are you up to today?"  "I don't know what you mean, officer.  I'm just on my way home from a glitter skunk rave."
Don't go to India yourself. Get a private investigator or get the media to go. Remember that scammers are common criminals pos's and they will harm you if they have the chance. BTW I'm glad you got a scammer locked up like the animals they are. 👍
heh you're pretty cure as a blonde.
Can you please do a "HOW TO" video on making a fake bank account and the VM????? I troll these losers every chance I get but when I get to the computer part I don't have a VM or a fake bank account. You're a champ man, keep it up
Who else watched the mark Rober video? ⬇️
Great job!
Too bad that these people, their business(es) & ALL their files can't be used to convict them. A country as corrupt as India actually seems to support this which is really sad & people need to be held accountable.
Thank you for making a channel to educate us about how these scammers work .
Legendary ........
Yeah. Come on, FCK the Guys You are precious indeed.
On the Indian side it's difficult because the complaints are being filed with the wrong people who are the Police! Yes, in that part of the world you give the local MP's and Chairperson the headache and they'll order the Police to take action. Two things will happen, either the cases will reach a court or they'll get in on the action. If they're bent then you aim higher.
Seriously, what’s up with the hair!!??
Brill I’ve had a few try with me great stuff 👌👍
Vivian singing Post Malone might become my new ring tone
She is going to look great on the mug shot!
Two of my favourite creators in the titles! Excites to watch this one.
You guys should get together and put a class on so that we can become scam baiter's too! That would be AWESOME!!
Hello my dad got hacked on his Facebook, aol and ebay the scammer email is mariabriuin@hotmail.com anyway can you help pls i got insta and Twitter
Pierogi, you're a rare treasure! Thank you for everything you do, and all the hard work you put into stopping these scammers. You're such a humble genuine person, we hope you know that you're truly saving lives...❤  I lost my mom a few years ago and since then, I've been a caregiver for my aging dad who is a former Marine, and all of the information you've shared from your videos has helped him from being scammed. Thank you so much!
What the
pls post a tutorial on how to not cringe on scam calls
I find this video a bit disjointed. What happened to the money mule? How did they recruit them? Maybe I'm just missing something, despite watching it twice. I enjoyed your other videos more.
GG
I need to know what happened.
Epic work, sir. Keep up the fight!
❤️
Pierogi looking for an excuse to dress up as a granny :P
Bravo, sir. Proud to be a supporter. Vivian was on point!
Thank you for all your hard work!!!! Truly are heroes in my book
It's crazy they have to record their self to make sure they don't steal any money
Getting emotional here  Thanks for the great work. I subscribed, stay safe ✌️
for the algorithm
Imagine i all the scam-baiters banded together. Yikes! At the very least, some of the investigative scam-baiters like Jim, NeeP, Ben, and Lewis need to team up with some of the undercover/resource-eater scam-baiters like Payback, Kit, Hoax Hotel, pappamonkey, JaybeeTV, and Alogical. There're also a bunch of entertainment scam-baiters that could contribute too. Many scammers can be taken down, but more importantly, a lot of awareness can be raised to make them completely obsolete. 👍
Hope the scammer was like "Are you KIDDING ME?"
ThankU💝
Seems like there should be a big ass sign on the door of every shipping company saying if you're sending money through the mail you're getting scammed
Kudos to you! Thank you so much for what you do!! You're right, people need to wake up, and law enforcement should THANK YOU THREE for providing all the proof, but also have you guys help out as part of a team (FBI, police force, etc) in cracking down these scammers! Love you & bless you, man. Big hugs!
I really didn’t expect to see this taking place in Pearland. I lived there for years it’s a super quiet city hardly any crime and you really wouldn’t expect stuff like this there.
But do they really deposit the extra money? Or how do they make it look like you got the money on the bank account?
Bro try sending these videos to local or national news channels.
Omg, I love you dressed as Vivian!
Are 100 dislikes the scammers? I wish YouTube could start giving users more likes for participating.  I'd give you 12000 likes this is the video I've been waiting for, it's like ocean's 16 geekstyle
So happy to see you finally have an arrest under your belt!! I hope this helps you get the push you need to make this more widely known! Keep at it Pierogi, you're one of the good ones. <3
Me and my mates in UK have Max respect and support for what you are doing to destroy these Dalits.
3 great guys wish you the best of luck on your journey 👍 🙏 wish the government on both sides would do more to clamp down on those thieves
Unfortunally, the targets of scammers (eldery people) usually don´t watch youtube... Therefore your message never gonna reach em :(
97 scammers disliked the video
I watched it two times it was so good.
I love, love, love your videos!
You 3 are a force to be reckoned with!!  Thank you all for aggressively going after the people taking advantage of those unable to protect themselves for various reasons.  Keep up the great work.  We need to cut the head off the snake, but that is a different battle requiring more authoritative groups, but they will need your support.  Awesome stuff!
I just got a scam message like this and it's because of this channel that I was able to recognise it immediately.  So thank you for that (and for your "old lady" voice, which amazes me every time).
Stop making me laugh so hard! It hurts!! But keep doing it!!!  🤣🤣🤣
After watching Jim Browning and Mark Robers' videos on this I'm impressed that you managed to keep it relevant, interesting and with enough new info to keep it from just being a re-hash of the other videos. You three should be seriously proud of yourselves. Really good work.
Epic. Any follow up on what happened to them next?
This is awesome great work!!!
Such great stuff....keep up the great work
Thanks for all the hard work you all do. I respect you all so much 🌹
it is amazing just how much cash people will put in a box without any alarm bells ringing !!
My mom actually got a call that said a apple I mac and iphone 12 and a iPad has been bought with the card and was sent to NY and then they needed the card. Number and the other number and my moms like fuck you if you know where it's going to you should have those things
He kinda look like Adam Sandler
I LOVED the Vivian re-enactment of preparing the package for shipping!!!
Your doing an amazing job, well done you. Also want to say that your hair is gorgeous....😁
absolutely fantastic work as always boys, i hope this video reaches 1 million views very quickly. much love to Pierogi, Mark, Jim & the entire scambaiting community
Awesome!!! Very Well Done!!!
You're great. Love yr hair colour too.
instead of you saying thank us we are the one that should be saying thank you. I personaly want to say thank you
You are doing so much good.  Bless you and your family. ❤️❤️❤️
Got to be the best thing on YouTube right now .Who's the hot blonde
DANG! Vivian has got it going on! Is she single? Can you introduce us?
Hey i'm a subscriber to you and mark rober can you and mark make a glitter bomb that got a senser that when the scammers put there head over the package it spay pepper spay in there eyes
Great job SP and all the others out there getting retribution for the victims.  I'm subbed to all you guys.  Keep up the good work.
Thank you.  Be careful out there.
Bravo!!!! You are amazing and keep up the outstanding work!
I'm in awe! How can I help?! I need to be a part of this good work!
Is it March 20th already? Lol
They deserve an oscar
Loving the new hair Pierogi!
well done. thank you.
Viv is a smokeshow. You gotta do a bigger collab with her.
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSS VIVIAAAAAANNNNN VERONICA ROGERS THE QUEEN HERSELF IN THE FLESH
Great job!! Keep up the great work!
If you dislike, you must be a scammer
you deserve an Oscar
Ive seen this and a few other videos relating the same people and orgs. IMO this scamming shit will never stop unless big players like AirBnb, FedEX, ups, usps, federal enforcement, do some conglomerate effort and flag all deliveries sent to Airbnbs. Impossible u say? Wrong. Airbnb address database could custom api to fedex, usps etc and flag package for extra care. they'll get around this, eventually. thats when u update and merge crowd sourced data. blacklisting senders/receivers/addresses. Who funds this? need investment.
Pierogi, masz coś wspólnego z Polską??
i could not be any happier with this, finally getting payback
Well done all of you! Keep up the good fight!!
Great job dude! What a collab!! Can't wait for the next one
I'm glad that my google pixel has the ability to have the Google assistant pick up these stupid robo and scam calls for me so I never have to deal with them
This was an epic video that needs to be shared. The more people that watch it the better. I know how much work you did to get this video out and it was well worth the wait. I think this will be very informative to a lot of people and you hit the Mark with this one Pierogi. Way to go good job. I hope you can rest now because I know you put your blood sweat and tears into this video and it definitely shows. I’m glad to be in the ScammerPayback family that you’ve created. And I’m proud to be your friend.
YES! Great job. You saved me from scammers by knowing how to identify.
this is awesome.
Wonder why Anydesk doesnt get involved. Since its putting a bad name on their software.
Thank you scammer payback!! My grandmother was scammed ...get em guys and never stop
Kickass collab!!!
Everyone in the world needs to see these videos.
Repent and trust Jesus Christ before it’s eternally to late
shitty editing, but love what you're doing
I discovered this channel thanks to Mark Rober's video on this topic. You guys did an amazing job!
I wish the Pearland Police Department would air their footage of the bust
they caught a money mule n think they beat the scammers 🤦‍♂️
scam=:(
Keep up the amazing work! 👏👏👏👏👏
Thank you, all of you guys, so much for what you're doing. Never give up <3 thank you for being the change we all want to see, and hopefully, in the future there will be teams like you guys in the police departments, calling, hacking/ deleting, glitter **mbing and arresting these scammers. Tytyty! <3
The Vivian reenactment was epic!
Awesome to see Pierogi's vid after Jim and Mark.  Outstanding work, gents!
I saw Mark Rober's version of this, and he managed to explain the con and what you both did so much better than you. Your version is also missing so much detail.
Hi
yes daddy P  bomb them alllllllllllll
_"There's a sucker born every minute."_  ~P.T. Barnum Social engineering scams have existed for all of man's days walking this earth - the slick-politician who wants your vote, the covered wagon rolling into a dusty town selling magical elixirs, the female showing cleavage to the cop writing out her ticket, even the garden serpent - all use social engineering to get what they want from their target.  We should expect that to NEVER change, it's a fools errand to think anything will shutdown any of these scams, that's just the reality of the situation.  And it's accurate for Pierogi to point out spreading the word as the best defense.  I have sent countless emails to local government, asking them to consider creating national PSA's, blasted across television, newspaper, social media et al, alerting citizens of these scams.  Afterall, it's only the citizens who don't know about these scams, who become victims.  I urge everyone to call/email/write letters to your local government, even NGO's and charities, asking them to please create PSA's.  My household is of retirement age, and all of our Social Security mail comes with a nice big warning printed across the back of the envelope, which is a great start - we just need that same warning plastered across the airwaves.  Unfortunately, I have not received anything other than a routine "formed" response, probably because there aren't many citizens demanding a resolution.  It doesn't take a lot of time once you've crafted a letter/email, as you can send the same wording asking for PSA-blast, to everyone on your list.  I even printed-up a flyer and stuck it to my community's mailbox area, hopefully at least everyone in my neighborhood knows what's up!  Good luck!
Now the scammer can cry as much as he wants in jail.
The message behind this: never trust Indian Tech Support 😂
Keep up the great work
Don't forget Kitboga!
Glad part 3 finally landed!
Awesome
Congratulations on a job well done, Pierogi!  Scamming will never go away, but we can neuter it by making more people aware of how they work, and how to spot the signs that something doesn't seem right.
Powerful & informative!! Outstanding accomplishment that you have reached.  Congratulations ♥ 548k and still rising. Well earned.
Congratulations for your great job, pierogi and to those who collaborates with you. While watching this video and reflecting of what you've said, it's really true that the scammers should be stopped of their crimes. Yes indeed American was the victim and maybe some other countries too,it's to sad. How could all the scammers go to bed, as they stole all the money especially the elderly ones, where's their conscience. I really felt so bad. They have to be stop.
No one gonna talk about vivian’s broken nail?
Like x1000000!
Time to get Tom Selleck, William Devane, and Joe Namath to do some public service announcements and put them on TV.  Great Video, congratulations on all of the hard work!
Your mission of justice  touches my heart.  I believe in you.  I have since the very first day 4 months ago.  I think your intelligent, funny, talented, and adorable.  Good Job on this Video!!! It was so gratifying to see her caught!!!! It was worth the wait!! I am so proud of you, and your video!! good work, a job well done!!!  Just for your information, I didnt come from Mark Robers Account I went to see his account from your youtube! but I didnt become a member.  I just checked him out. lol Good Job keep up the good work.   I heart Vivian, and Monica.
heroes dont always wear capes. sometimes they just glitterbomb some scammers.
Doing gods work right now. My nan was scammed for $1200 (not much but a lot to her) Needless to say this makes me happy you’re making this more well known <3
Bro you guys are amazing. Not just fighting the good fight but make it entertaining. Oh and I never knew how hot Vivian is 😂
Great work!!
Goat
dubloo
You personal mission to get these criminals is amazing. You guys are trying to save peoples life savings.
Baaaaahahahahaha!!! Oh Vivian! That 5 o'clock shadow is working for you hun!!!
So there are some other type of scammers that keep calling my grandparents. They pretend to be me or my brother thats passed way and say oh theyre in jail or at the hospital and need money. They'll say my name or my brothers and when my Grandpa asks why didn't they call my mom and whats her name, they just throw out 3 females from my life. Even an ex from years ago.   I witnessed them trying to be my dead brother and I was so dumbfounded and now I'm pissed off. These pieces of trash are just stealing from well meaning people. These people are giving up money willingly but its because they think they are partially at fault for these things and are trying to right it. I hope the worst happens to these awful people.
Love love love, thank you! I sent this to my brother.
What a video!! ♥️♥️  Also why do you look so good as an 80 year old woman.. 😂♥️
Haven't seen anyone say it yet , but Thank you for what your doing . We appreciate your efforts.
Been getting calls all day from these crooks using different numbers saying they are from Apple Support. Damn shame you cant just stop these POS'S from calling! I block... they just use a different number.
Every time I watch that moment the mule gets covered in glitter I laugh. And I rewind it a lot!
Do you plan to do a "Scammer Payback" video of scammers on wallstreet?
Bro I was watching your John Cudo video today it was awesome but got to say he made you frown so much looks like the scammers are leading this to Botox
Vivian Rogers and Mary Swanson are the real heroines in all of this ... not sure why you boys are taking all the credit for their efforts?  ... must be the patriarchy at work! (ha ha ha)
i watch these all the time. i'd like to do one. just don't know how well I could build the bank site on a vm.
Mark Rober, Jim Browning, and Scammer Payback have the BEST and MOST INTERESTING videos ever.
Awesome video
YO! Can I get the girls number at 9:25? she was a badddddie
I love this idea! Will help you and your mission to shut these guys down
More like “Sobbing Steven” 😏
You are a fucking legend
Your doing good work Pierogi
Nice makeup btw 😂
The new thing I do when I get a scam call, is to say nothing. I get the automated message and when prompted to press 1, I press 1 and when the answer, I say nothing. Most hang up in a minute or so, some stay on line much longer. Some curse and some try speaking Spanish. Either way, they have nothing to vent at but complete silence.  The passive aggressive approach can really mess with their minds.
Thank Pierogi, ill be sharing this...great documentary and letting us see the glittered
Such a good job!
We get sooo many 'bad' calls on our landline, (we need landline for our house alarm), that we now ask "Is this Pierogi?" and they hang up, lol! Thank you for all you do!
Great job dude
Tell them, "No, I'm going to keep that excess refund."

So the scammers can only get into your computer if you open up an affected email? I'm just learning this lol.
This video should be distributed to all vulnerable adults. Great job everyone. I've had scammers ringing me all week, I block their number and they just call from another one. They are relentless but so are we!!
So worth the wait!!!! Thanks pierogi! Video was awesome 😎
Like I said before less glitter more C4
I want to thank you so much I shared this with my father he's 89 and the scammers got him for 20,000 his life savings it was a very painful moment for my father to admit that he was scammed and it's a shame that they take advantage of senior citizens this way so thank you so much for your hard work and please keep it up we need you and more like you in this world
It seems the government doesn’t care that the elderly and others get scammed!!!
Fantastic Video series by you 3.....Amazing the level of crapiness you have found in our own country...I hope those criminals get what they deserve
She filmed herself opening the box!
Appreciate you guys...Amazing!!!
Share this video.
This is amazing. Finally some pay back!
Thumbs up for the good work. Love the channel! Greetings from the Netherlands 🇳🇱
Great to see everyone coming together on this project!! Cant wait to see other collabs potentially and what you put out next! new viewer and love all of your material. Keep up the great work!
Big reason why this keeps coming up is because there are no safeguards on our telecom systems.  There's no protection to force callers to be transparent and not allow spoofed phone #'s.  I get them constantly where calls from India, Pakistan, Jamaica, etc. show to be local #'s.  AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, etc. need to step up.  The US Government needs to step up to enforce a real phone ID system so there's a clear indication of who is calling.  Robo callers and spoof callers are at epidemic levels costing billions of dollars lost to scammers.
How have I not found this channel sooner...
A HMRC scammer called me at a really bad time, I asked him why he was stealing from people in the U.K. his reply left me gobsmacked. "Sir this is not stealing, this is me showing my acting talent." :)
Thanks what you all do. I got 3 scammer calls just while watching this video.
I hope more arrests happen.  Love the channel.
I think I have a crush on Vivian 🤩
WOOT WOOT!!
Thank you
This collaboration with yourself, Mark & Jim has been incredibly wonderful. So hope there will be more in the near future 👌🏻
I got 8 (!) calls from Amazon Refund Department yesterday. I played with them as much as I could. On call #8, I finally gave the guy a motivational speech, saying he could get a better job if he tried.
Im so glad you do this, I just don't understand how people fall for these scams. I realize they target the elderly, but it seems like they get millions of people to send them money.
I am sooooo thankful to you and your friends
I have been watching your channel back to back for the last few days and really enjoying it and same goes for trilogy media I have watched that many in the last few days the partner is kicking off at me haha 😂
NICE JOB!  Because the victims are overseas the Indian Police & the victim's own Law Enforcement have no cross jurisdiction to take the scammers to court. Gift cards are now being passed over & the "Money Mules" are the way forward for scammers. Everyone needs to be VIGILANT! Bitcoin was also being pushed by scammers to get money, but last week the Government of India said it was looking at banning the use of "Crypto Currency." Hopefully that will be another door shut for scammers.
Omg so funny
i died when he was singing congratulations 💀😭
Yes
Your Name isnt perogie  You Are NOW LUKE SKY WALKER SAMMER JAMMER Great video Great Content 👍  Happy Days 😊  ps thank you for your  Great  work  go Get em
Your are the B0llocks man.
These 3 joining forces is like the YouTube Justice League
thank you for the info! rock on!
This is one of those few videos that made me pick up the phone and called mom to give her the 411. Awareness is really the first step. Thanks Perogi!
It really needs to be dog poo and not glitter
Can I take you on a date Vivian ☺️
Hello Pierogi
“I love you” lol what? 🤣🤣
Like you said this is the best video you made!!! So well explained how these kinda scams mostly works! Great teamwork whit Mark and Jim. You gave us such a good laugh whit Vivians wrapping explanation 😂👍👍👍 This is just the beginning!!!
I like the way you think i think you should scam them back and hack them and make them think they are taking your money when you are not and then call them out.
This is fantastic! I'm so proud of you Pierogi! You're doing amazing work!
83 scammers did not like your video... We LOVE it. Thank you !
I’m not sure why our government or these other countries governments hasn’t set up teams to take them down. It’s not wasted money or resources people are losing their life savings because of this. The harsher the punishments and the word out there that this won’t be tolerated will prob put some of it to a stop and the ones that want to take those chances will suffer the consequences. Our computers and software needs to be better smh idk something has to give here. These poor people work hard their whole lives just to be stipend from it’s bad enough our government taxes so much and we can’t own anything without paying yearly taxes and insurance.
You are doing good work, keep it up 👍
I don't understand why people have to be so disgusting. Just for money? There's plenty of ways you can make money, get a job.
Love that you guys are teaming up and leveling up. This is serious. Next level is sanctions for any country running these scams. Let’s call some congressmen?
Love this and I’m so happy you were able to catch someone!!!
Great vid and a worthy cause!!!  can I just say, the blue black hair looks amazing!!! Great look
Jim said if we wanted to know what happened to that woman to watch your video. So uh. What happened to that woman lol
That Scammer sounded more Nigerian than Indian 🤔 Either way Thumbs up👍
Best collab ever
I still don't understand how none of them react to the fart spray
Why blur her face when it's already shown in other channels? Shes some asian woman btw
Why do criminals always have pixelated faces? You would think looking like that, they would be easy to spot in the street. Great work once again Pierogi. It's such a shame that scammers exist,.
Amazing job man.. keep it up!!
Yo why is Dr. Death Scamming this poor lady from the afterlife?!!? (People like yourself are real life super heroes, thank you for everything you are doing)
scanners. GEEK squad
😂😂 great work  for the Vivian Rogers dress up, great video bud
Add kitboga and scammer revolts to the mix create an anti scam taskforce
Freaking excellent job.
80 dislikes from scammmers. Lol 😂.  Good job guys!!!
When this happens to elders in your family only then do you really really really appreciate these knights in shining armour.i hope you read this.to know how much you care that you use all your skills to save others means the world to us .serious serious kudos
When you see your local news anchor at the begining
God Bless you and your team Pierogi, you're doing incredible work. Forwarding this to my Mom, she's 90 and very bright; she got an iPad for her 90th... it is frightening to see the depths of damage these animals are inflicting on people like her.  (I nearly wet myself laughing when you made Sam cry.) The world needs MORE Vivian Rogers!
bruh i got a scam ad saying i could get a free amazon gift card
Glitter bombs and wasting their time is nice, but nothing beats seeing these assholes in handcuffs.   You, Jim Brown and Mark Rober are heroes
Thanks. Not all hero’s wear capes. Some where wigs and a dress.
THE DREAM TEAM
Love you man great respect @scammer payback
I was excepting more information, but this is nice.
Next step: get a sniper and tell them snipe the mules with pellet guns
this may be your best video yet... and that means a lot
Remarkable collaboration moving against undiluted evil. Be great to see some baiters cammed up and go undercover into Indian scam center,screw their whole operation and have police van available for arrests. Put the fear of God up the lot of them as to whats coming.
Give the crying guy an oscar, best performance in the scammer category
Keep up the good work! The world needs more people like you.
Incredible 🙌 This is just the beginning! Great job to all of you!
A thousand thanks for what you do!  I made my grandparents watch this!  The Post Malone bit was my favorite.  Lol the crying! Hahaha
not only are you doing a wonderful service to unknown people, but I believe that the people who watch your videos learn kindness. You're faithful subscriber.
You guys are doing great work. I hope the woman who got glittered will help law enforcement take down the real criminals, her bosses. Even if these money mules are knowingly breaking the law, they are just pretty much pawns in the larger game.
I love the Vivian Rogers part..but most importantly I love this video!! I'm glad that your voice is being heard Pierogi..i can't thank you enough for doing what you do!!
Bro why are you showing scammers as hackers scammers don’t deserve this ,their Iq begins with a decimal point and are not even remotely smart enough to be compared with hackers
I’ve been waiting for this like a kid on Christmas morning !
like this if your dumbass got scammed
I don't get it, did that policeman at the end arrest that guy or not?
Not all heroes wear capes!
I bet a child could fake a cry better than Steve
SO GLAD the three of you collabed. this is amazing
That was fantastic , great job Pierogi we all need to share this 👏
You are a superhero man !!!
Lolol awesome job and collaboration guys
I love scambaiting collabs. Good to see Mark joining the fight since he has the engineering skills and the money to actually get the right people to scout and talk with the proper authorities. For once cops are actually doing something beneficial to society as well. All around great work. I've been watching Jim for years and love what he does. Best patreon subscription I've ever been a part of.   Great job you guys.
YES VIVIAN. I'm howling laughing, brilliant
Bravo!!!
Woooow Pierogi... This is great work, you are  doing the most impossible, the FBI should consider hiring you... Much love from 🇿🇦 South Africa
<3
Great work all of you. X
I didn’t know you were from Sarasota! So cool! That’s my home town! Nothing interesting ever happens here!
wow god bless you
Thank you and keep at it will keep supporting
WHAT A STAR! More power to you.
So proud of you....I might have gotten scammed a few minutes ago if not for you Peirogi!  😘 thankyou!!!
Is it necessary to censor the faces of these criminals?
If you hear indian accent on your phone, just hang up.
The sequel we’ve all been waiting for
I would so love to see you walk into a call center in India with a platoon of Indian police and introduce yourself as Vivian. Even better have Vivian on the phone with a scammer as you walk into his call center and introduce yourself.
Keep fighting the fight Pierogi, Jim Browning all all the other people fighting back
Love you and your work. Worry about this with my parents all the time. I kept one on the phone for an hour.... it was so amazing.
Awesome.... I love it I love it I love it... You are an outstanding man..⭐💙🙏
I really loved this collaboration. It was so interesting to see the different point of you of this entire operation. What you guys do is amazing and thanks for your job and your love for us.
YEss
Well said well said👏👏👏😭
I can't thank you all enough for the work you are doing. I hope authorities take this a lot more seriously to bring these thieving scumbags to account.
God bless your heart and thank you
People who fall into these scams seriously are so dang stupid. . . :o
I'm deeply saddened the package did not make it to the scumbag that initiated the scam
Do more of these type of videos!
What is he using for voice changer?
Anything to wear a dress and make up eh?
Incredible pierogi. It's amazing to see how far you've come! All 3 of you get to India. What an amazing moment that would be
Best video EVER!!
You're so cute as Vivian lol
Phony crying
Thank you for what you do. Entertaining & educational.💜
How did you get the cops to finally go after someone?
This videos epic bro
Awesome brother this is awesome keep it up I love seeing this 😍
BAD ASS!!! all you guys are so BAD ASS! GOD LOVE YA. thank you for saving little old ladies and the rest TOO! see you next live call . P.S. if you ever need a hand in KANSAS CITY bringing down a scammer I'm available.
Does he remind anyone else of Adam Sandler???
DO IT! DO IT!  RESPECT!
Omg,i love you for what you do. Thank you and respects.
Most of the Indian Cyber Crime department knows about these Scams but rarely do anything unless the scammers get  millions of dollars.

Real life superhero!!
great video I was waiting on this one
I was at my 82 year old mum's house when the phone rang. She listened briefly, screamed with laughter and then slammed the phone down. I asked her who it was. "Scammers", she replied. Bit by bit, the word is getting out. The times, they are a changing . . .
You guys are the best
Scammer: ( _indistinct mumbling_ )   “Mmmmmooohhhgoooddd...Go tO sTorE AnD I WoNt cRy”
I lived in shame with this in my head for years ,you have released such a pressure in my brain please be careful, I want you to live a long long life!
Thank you for your work to stop these scumbags. You sir, are a modern day Knight.
These scanners are B***hes , it’s soo funny not to laugh
Jim, Pierogi, Mark, and Vivian are saving the world, one glitter bomb at a time
OHHHHHHH BABBBBBBYYYYYYY
Love your hair color
This feels like a series of continuous episodes from Flash, Arrow and Supergirl from back in the day in the form of Mark, Jim and Perogi.
My son is back to talking to scammers. He started a few years ago because of Ownage Pranks and he is calling them and spending their time because of you! Enjoying all your recent videos, I started watching them after Mark and Jim posted their versions.
Have you reached out to your senators/representative about this?    See if this is something that you can get in front of congress?  Testimony?  legislation?
Next time they call me… I’m going to troll them over the phone to waste their time.
Hugh respect for what you're doing....I got a warning on my computer and got locked out for a bit, and actually called the number supplied.....I figured out it was a scam though before it went too far.....It makes me sick to know that seniors are losing their life savings to these lowlifes, and unfortunately, many older people don't watch Youtube, so will continue to fall victim to these assholes........regardless, you're doing a great service for many many people....keep up the good work and have a great day....
Oddly you don't see this sort of thing happening in 3rd world countries.. Coarse having hands or fingers cut off seems to be a much better deterrent than what we tend to have with our legal systems.
Wow I live those Glitter Pants🤣🤣😂😂😹😹
Great work... everyone must share this... worldwide - but u til the authorities, particularly in the sub-continent start taking this seriously, it will keep continuing...
I was talking about how many times I get calls for scams on Facebook. I told this lady about your channel. The next day she messaged me that she watched you all night.
What doesn’t make sense is that the cops will say they can’t do anything unless there is a legitimate victim, yet they will entrap people all the time where there is no actual victim, but the perp will be arrested.   For example, setting up a delivery truck and leaving the back of it open, unattended, to entice someone to steal the goods in the back of it. Or pretending to be a prostitute and arresting a john that tries to get service from her. So I just don’t buy their excuse.
Pierogi dressed as Vivian Rodgers was just disturbing.
Thank you so much for everything you do. I cried at the end of the video. Your hard work pays off. 😭😭😭 I know you’re only one person but I think you’ve help so many people by making these videos. I have so much respect for you, man!  PS I also loved how you explain the whole scam process in a way that is easy to understand for older people. Thank you again🙏
Omg this was amazing! 🥰 thank you pierogi!!!
It keeps getting better
Omg, you are a Beautiful Lady!!
Thank you for all you do for us all, Pierogi. 🤗
my mom just got a call saying her ssn would be completely shut down and she would have a warrant on her name unless she called the people back lol
I'm blown away that people actually fall for these scams AND the government doesn't seen to do anything about them
gotta catch them all! (pokemon theme song)
So when are ya gonna teach us all to do the shit you do in your file deletion videos? 😂
This was worth the wait Awesome job keep it of getting the scammers.
Well Done!
Vivian Rodgers - STYLE ICON 😍
here from mark rober😎
Dablu dablu dablu dod
I can track  there location 🙂
You’re a King Sir!
Wow crazy to see that scammer get caught in my Hometown
Thanks man. The government should bee paying you for this👍
Great stuff, Pierogi.  Thanks for all you are doing.  My wife's parents got scammed about a month ago for $10K. The scammers had them driving all over purchasing various gift cards.  It's so sad how they take advantage of people, especially the elderly who may not know any better.  Question for you, is there any way after the fact to find out who the scammers were to try and get back some of their money?  Thanks again!!
10:12 I just noticed there are fake nails littering the table. XD
Pierogi, Jim Browning and Mark Rober                                        🗣Salute!
Your a star bro
Watched you and Mark Rober and Jim Browning. Well done you three! Fantastic job!
Pierogi, you are my hero! You have a heart of gold and a great role model for us all. Keep rockin bro!
Great job man great job.
Thank you for all you do.
WARNING: They started sending fraudulent checks via USPS. They pose as companies offering jobs, sweepstakes winners ect. The person cashes the check, then they ask for gift cards. The person has to pay the money back to the bank. It is disgusting!!!
Dramatic music...lame
Some bank scammers managed to call off of my bank's phone number once, and tried to ask me for my username and account number and other personal information. Since it was suspicious, I played with them for a while. I said, "OK, but then you should have access to the database as a representative."  They seemed confused and there was someone in the background coaching them. I heard the coach, so I played up my IT knowledge more and said things like, "Oh, you don't have access to the front end of the database, then you should call the IT department and ask them to access it by mySQL if it's broken like you claim. Hey, do you know PHP? Or do you think it's written in ASP? (I already knew which one it was written in, but pretty much testing the caller)" "Do you need the phone number for the IT department [of the bank] since your database is broken? [Gives bank phone number for IT department.]" And so on...  I spooked them with IT knowledge, then called my bank, got the way to report the scammers. The bank about a week later issued a general notice that they'd never ask for ssn's, passwords, etc. About a week after that, they had everyone change their usernames, but being wary, I tested the caller trying to change my username to make sure it wasn't a scam by asking them the same questions the scammers in the past asked me (Do you need my ssn, bank account number, etc), and then verified it was a legit caller. I'm guessing they found the scammers eventually, since I gave them as much information I could about the call center. (These were not of Indian descent, BTW and were stupid enough to use their real voices.) The bank tightened security and made it so it was harder to find the usernames on the accounts after that.  Another scammer called recently and I delayed them by talking about the food I'd ordered, etc. "Do you want a rebate?" "Uhhh... are you the delivery person for my food?" "No." So I delayed them a bit about the food... asked if they were a scammer, etc.
omfg that crying is so  f a k e
:) <3
“Crying” Steven is pathetic.😥
This was A-MAZING!!! Thank you for doing this, you guys are superheroes! So glad you are teaming and making this possible!!
I have such an incredible amount of respect for the three of you. You are heroes. I hope one day that these crimes will be given the attention that they deserve.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bingo!
kitboga crying rn cause he didnt get in the collab.
This happen in every country. In Poland recently scammed by people who pretend to be from Police, Amazon, eBay and for bitcoin crypto currency. Thugs often get the access via TeamViewer. Victims loose large amounts. Even rich and famous actresses fall for the scammers tricks. One actress lost recently about 70 000 EUR.
LOVE U SOOO MUCH KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!
Viva la Vivian Rogers
What you should do after deleting files is just add a bunch of selfies of Vivian, they definitely won’t want to scam again after those 😂
Looks like 57 scammers disliked this video.
Just watched Mark Rober's video too regarding this. You are amazing, and I had to subscribe to you too. Freakin' Heroes, all three of you! <3
Now i know exactly what vivian looks like. Isn't she so pretty? pretty hard to feign innocence when you've got glitter plastered all over you.
Please never stop even just a little bit you mark and Jim are changing the world. Thank you 🙏
Pisses me off that Indians are mostly behind these.
Absolutely loved it!  Great job & thank you for all you do for making sure these scammers are being held accountable ✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻
Rogi the GOAT!
68 scammers did not like this video.🤩
You guys are the modern day Avengers!
This videos should get more views!
OMG scammer payback I literally fell on the floor laughing when I saw u dressed as Vivian, classic
Excellent!
Thank you for doing this. My mother got scammed when I was in the hospital due to my terminal illness. Seeing people like Jim/Mark/Kit/You getting back to scammers, telling people about this, informing people about how they take advantage of people especially those who are in difficult situation and pry on their emotions. It really is, I mean no words to describe it but thank you. God bless you and please keep on fighting.
send some glitter bombs to INDIA
Aside from having moral standards, what made you start getting these bozo scammers ?  Your like the newest Avenger !
I bet half of all dislikes are scammers XD
i hate scammers so much
I found this channel via Mark Rober's video. Really loving what I have seen so far. Great job!   I can't wait to finish watching this saga. But I just had to stop to take a moment and comment on the irony.  Oh the irony, I had to pause watching this video to go answer the phone. Guess who it was... Yep, an automated Amazon somebody about a charge for an i-phone. Gotta love ironic timing.  (For those of you who are going to ask, yes I hung up the phone. (Even before finding this channel I knew those were not legitimate calls.)
Thanks so much for putting together such a clear explanation of how the scams work. This is really going to help so many people avoid losing their money. Y'all rock!
Amazing what you do, thank you 😍😍😍
AMAZING VIDEO!!!
Love this!. They are sooo sparkly
All 3 of you are beacons of hope for a better society
Is this pete buttigieg
gg guys :)
Don't be shy, show the lady's face...
Thank you for doing this! My elderly father has dementia, and when he received a call from “Amazon”, he thought someone had stolen his credit card. Fortunately, I knew it was a scam!
Great video
If you three men can do this just to make a YouTube video why can we not take down this scammers. The work you do is amazing keep it up
Ugh 🤦🏼‍♀️ that Steven is quite manipulative.
good work
Damn, that voice acting tho
These people are unbelievably scummy - thanks Pierogi - God bless, brother
I was seeing the day you're wife was putting on the makeup 💄 on you . Let me just say she did a great JOB. KEEP UP YOUR GOOD WORK from CALI.
We will destroy the scammers one by one.
CAme here from mark rober
Yessssss! Love it! You’re da bomb, Pierogi. The glitta 💣 bomber!
Yaaayyy!!!  I'm so excited for this!!  👏👏👏👏
Vivian looks great for her age!
You are my hero!
Must mention, love from India 🇮🇳
Y’all are amazing 🤩 Pierogi, Jim & Mark I’m so proud of all of you! Pierogi I have followed you for quite some time and I’m truly grateful that there are angels like you and your partners! Keep up the amazing work! It’s nice to see justice finally served! You’re awesome 😎 xoxo 😘
Can you make a very handsome woman
The crying??!  How pathetic
NOW THAT'S CLASS.  YOUR JOB IS COMPLETE, I MEAN, WHERE DO YOU GO FROM HERE?
💜
Legends! We thank you greatly for all you do  ♥
How fantastic, well done to you all,
Thank you for what you are doing! Please don’t ever stop! They got my aunt out of $1500 and she was terrified they were coming to arrest her! They wouldn’t let her get off the phone bc they threatened to put a warrant out for her and she believed them!
also like to thank you and the ones who help you to try and stop these low life scums....Thanks again
maybe the scambait was the friends we made along the way
Daamm thats the best undercover suit I have ever seen :D
Those dislikes are from the scammers
Thank you so much for what you do love and prayers to you all.love Vivian
Still good work being done here, but this is just a short recap of things happened and seen on the various channels....  That people keep falling for these scams still amazes me.
You are awesome thanks for all of you do
Outstanding production quality for a 15 min video, you absolutely killed it!!  You are doing great work and have formed one hell of a community.  Cheers bro!
EPIC.  Loved it.  Vivian looked smashing.  :D  LOL LOL
there should be a way the phone company can stop these calls....i get upwards of 20 telemarketer or scammer calls somedays
hey. what about triology media
Thank you so much for doing this!! Keep up the badass work!!!!
Not gonna lie: Vivian Rodgers is kind of hot.
I love how your bank uses the default react icon
i literally got a call while watching this video...lol....
Great Video -  The Vivian Package tutorial was brilliant
this is a legendary crossover
working with the best ! congrats you all
Hello from Russia
That poor car now stinks forever
Don’t thank us. We thank you.
We hate Scammers
I laughted out loud when the scammer fake cried
I'm from India and I hate scammers  They put all the blame for Indian people thank you for doing this love ur videos and keep it up
I so was excited to see you the other day on Mark's page! I love this so much and the Vivian wig and lipstick acting out the scam was the topper! ❤😹👍Thank you for everything you do to stop these scammers!
Mark, Perogi and Jim. 3 legends. Now with 1 extra subscriber each. Thanks for the great work. So happy you got both victims money back.
go get em sir!!!
I have been wondering about this. I saw the glitter bomb video where he said he couldn't talk about it right now, but this is awesome. Good on all you guys.
Pierogi saves people ... just because he can and then thanks us?! He is such a good person. His kindness is just astounding.   I hereby give thee the unofficial title as Knight of the YouTube Table. Arise Sir Pierogi and go forth into greatness.   #WeLovePierogi #SirPierogi
Love your lipstick!!! What's that shade called... lol
Payback is a b*tch. Awesome absolutely love this
😘😘
My new favourite pastime... get high and watch your videos absolutely hilarious 😂 😂.   Ps: Is Vivian single 🥰
The crying scammer 😢
You are a gem 💎
Copying Markrobber coincidence i think not
😂😂😂😂😂 “go get a napkin, this is unbecoming of you” 😂 but also this happens everywhere, even in Canada you get “this is a representative from the fraud department of Service Canada” and then they say how your social insurance has been compromised. I’ve received these robot calls almost daily and then you call and they take your money if you’re stupid enough to call back
I wonder if anybody has ever set up a public funding pool to retain a private security group to extract scammers to the U.S. for prosecution.
"Might just go to india someday" Pierogi climbing on a plane with a battleaxe and kicking in the doors of some call centers, that's what we really need.
I enjoyed the monologue at 11:20.
While I absolutely love your work and videos, I really did not need to see an image of Vivian Rogers (still funny!)
You did a fabulous job .....this video is excellent... You can see the hard work you have done to achieve this...keep up the good work ...very proud of you
Thanks pierogi for the amazing vid. I have always loved watching you videos but I didn’t fully understand what the scammers did to get your money. This video really helped explain that. Stay amazing!👍
POV: your looking for marks comment
I've got to be honest, I used to hang up on these people.  Now I just see how long I can get them to stay on the phone. I like to change my name a few times and act very confused. They usually get frustrated and swear at me within 5 minutes.
Was waiting for a long time, worth the wait
9:15
The popo doing their job!!!
Wow so cool guys stealing lol this is funny crazy that this happened
You are the man, thank you.
Omfg 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 hilarious ! These scammers deserve to die.
in the last 6 months I found Jim Browning then Mark Rober and then Pierogi, and then they up and team up this is freaking awesome!!! Thank you all 3 for each of doing your part to restore faith in Humanity! Thank you for shinning a collective spotlight on how terribly our justice system is failing the elderly and others getting scammed.  I also recently saw you teamed up with trilogy media which was the first time I heard of them the lot of you are amazing! keep up the great work.
Great job, Pierogi!  Well worth the wait!  I was glad to see the Vivian cameo - especially after the late-night live a few nights ago!  Can't wait to see what you 3 come out with next!  Congratulations on a job well done!
You guys should build a robo call center to spread awareness. Use the same phishing procedures that the scammers do but instead of scamming them, use the attention you get to educate them about scammers. So they would call back and it would say something like "you almost got scammed. These are the things you need to watch out for"
THE HAIR
Let’s go! Love you SP
I would love to get on UK question time and challenge the government on the PATHETIC amount of scam awareness. How hard is it to put scam awareness adverts on TV especially during the day instead of the usual junk you see.. Oh i know.. Money... How ironic.
I want to learn how to do what he do on the computer because i like to give a hard time to the scammer on the phone everyday
Factual error... At 0:35.. Phone numbers in india have a country code +91 and not +7
Good video nice
👏🏼💜👏🏼💜👏🏼💜👏🏼💜👏🏼
I can just see Jim, Carl, pierogi , and other Scambaiters walking down the street in India and scammers run for the hills. Lol.
A true hero!!!
I can't wait for a glitter bomb to go off in one of their call centres!
Fucking THANK YOU! You've made covid quarantine bearable.
Pog
My main question is can these scammer just transfer money straight from your bank account to their own account, if they can why don’t they do it that rather than asking for refund in cash
Yaaaas! The dream trio. I'm so happy.
Keep up the good work! Bring all the scammers down!
This was such a nice video--great for sharing to those who are new to the whole concept and need to be warned these things happen. And THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for your tireless work to end these scammers.   Also, Vivian?  I almost spit out my lunch watching that part. 😂💀 Love ya, P.
Editing was absolutely amazing
It's cool and all that this epic collab happened, but was there any reason Trilogy Media wasn't included? Guessing it had something to do with the challenges of getting any kind of arrest done in CA (at least based on the confronted series)?
✝️For God✨so loved💖the world 🌎 that he gave his one ☝🏽and only Son 👤 that whoever believes 🛐 in him shall not perish but have eternal life✨
I've never pictured what Vivian would look like, but there you go. 😅
Vivian’s drag Queen persona is uncanny. Was that all your own work? Perhaps a stage future for you! 😂😂😂
I would love to help you guy out if you need some investigation done in New Delhi. Keep up the work man.
Great job Pierogi!
I just realized Pierogi is one hot Vivian Rogers.. 🤣
You guys are heros
You guys are heroes for stuff like this. Please keep doing this amazing work. There are too many scammers out there. ❤️🥲😎
I never get these calls, but I used to from China but since then they are scared of me, and being an Indian if I get scam call from India because I live in Canada, they will regret this until their last breath
Good job Honey :p
Excellent excellent  video
Can you tell us there number so we can spam them plzzzzzz
I love what you guys are doing. You have my full support! 🥰
WTF! I watched Mark’s video and just now realized that this happened in pearland ! I drive through that city in the daily 😭
I totally forgot that they can ACTUALLY receive packages. Dude, this is incredible
I didn't raise you this way!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hi bud what a great vid love U 💘
World's best trio
All those guys are brain dead
Nice to see arrests happening.
congrats on the success you all had with this project, also love the blue hair!
Man, Jim Brown is jacked!
Great job. Next time use paint insteed of glitters.
This is gold 😂
When I hear a hindi accent on the phone, I hang up, even if it's my pharmacy
Is it just me or does this vid look like a nat geo show 😂
GREAT JOB #weareall scambaiters❤💜💚💙
So getting in trouble for the dress up, thats appropriating trans culture ... hahhahaa
Why did it take you like a week longer to post your video when it seemed like yall were supposed to all upload at the same time like Mark and Jim did? Seems like you missed out on a lot of free views since they both referenced your video so since this wasn't up at release, all those people who watched the videos during the last week, they all gone now ://
It’s not us it’s u guys I watch and share Iv just google how to buy bit coin says it’s free lol then abt 30 later I get a call from a broken Chinese Indian sort of girl saying I have to fill out a form online she’ll send me email me the form because I put my email address my name on my phone number to get a phone call back and the I thought that can’t do no harm they haven’t stop phoning me to try and fill out this form and I played along and said my right to hold because my Rolls-Royce was being looked at downstairs and I had to send market down and it takes him about 20 minutes getting out the house because we live in a big house I will share an hour don’t check the Porsche all the range Rover mum is range Rover just the Rolls-Royce no son not the Bentley the Rolls-Royce I’ve just seen a kid walking round it they might of scratched it go and check it they’ve sent me about six emails I keep replying I can’t find my bitcoin wallet I need to send them €250 I don’t know but they said I can pay in bitcoin stupid people I’ve probably done science stupid upset them and they’ll get me back are so wishy I know you people I need a great Hakka just to find somebody’s address I’ve been to the police I’ve done everything the proper way and I can’t get no wire until I give them a persons line but he uses a liar alias names all the time
the skit of pierogi as vivian packaging was unexpected but cool.
Well done P. Amazing job as usual.
YouTube actually pushed Mark Rober's video of this story before yours. It's well worth a look folks. Good job to all three teams on this one.
Man your hair is super gay
*Contact Karl Rock.*
Who thumbs down this video.  Honestly
Great work
Don’t forget the help from First Baptist Banking!
It's disappointing that you blur their faces. We have a right to know who they are.
Dublu dublu dublu dot
Awesome buddy, am from Indian but  no scam such as these take place here, the reason might be cause only a few use pc for online transactions and they are aware with the do's and don'ts. Many a times these scammers are  caught and just one of them leads to 100 other scammers, but they are restructured soon with new members, so I guess it's not just the scammers who have the final call there's someone above them who organises then so swiftly and this might be deeper than we think, it may even be attached to the Mafias and underworld.
Vivian putting the money in the box 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That was beautiful.
9:27 not gonna lie mans looking kinda cute ;)  lol nah im just joking unless....
At first I thought an ad popped up with pearland police... nope! Right where I live. Damn that’s crazy
You sir are a gentlemen and a scholar - reminding us that not all heroes wear capes.
When you want to start a vigilante task force that kicks in doors pick me! Lol
I've seen that clip of the scammer getting glitterbombed than approached by the police covered in glitter and stinking of fart spray numerous times, and it never gets old. 😂 That's what all those scammers deserve when they try to receive packages of money of the people they try to scam, before the police put them in cuffs and send them to jail when they belong.
As always great work. You look a little to comfortable in the blonde wig and makeup however... Kidding. Thanks for your efforts.
Now I forgive for it taking so long 😁 we see the hard work and it was well worth it this was a total banger and I can't wait to see what the the future holds..... thank you pierogi for the constant hard work you put in for the videos and of course the scam baiting. keep dose scammers busy, can't wait to see what's next!!!
I watched Jim Browning a few years ago but just recently found your channel through Mark's glitter bomb videos etc.. I've been deep diving into these scambaiting videos for the last few days. I just wanna say thank you for all you and others are doing to expose these scams and also helping people who have been scammed. While I know its fairly fun and entertaining to mess with these scammers, I can imagine how exhausting it must get. I appreciate your work.
Yesterday got a scam recorded message and pressed the button to talk to someone so I could waste their time. When you speak to them they don't even know which scam you're ringing about (they've obviously got so many different types on the go at once)and you have to tell them.
And some people are more concerned about children crossing the border?
OMG! GIVE THEM EXACTLY WHAT THEY DESERVE!
I can't believe you dressed up as an old lady lol
that's a lot of views in an hour!
Incredibly proud of you, Rogi. I'm forever grateful for having found you and watching thus grow. We are all scambaiters!!!
This is your best video yet my friend! 👊🏻💥👊🏻
60 scammers disliked👎I hope they are reading this..we’re not going to stop till you are behind the bars. So leave us alone and get a real job.
This video is the Avengers 1 of the Scambaitverse.
The three musketeers of catching scammers love all of your work
Thank you.
can companies (especially all banks) have their websites not have their websites manipulated by scammers? I feel like this needs to be a security feature. I feel like that will foil their scamming efforts indefinitely.
Thanks for doing this!!!
The Vivian Rogers reenactment 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You’re A Hero! You with Mark and Jim!!! These weasels needs to be “contained”!
You guys are awesome.  Anti-scam group
Did you steal mark rovers idea
you should also team up with pleasant green to be the ultimate scammer payback  sucks to be a scammer
i think you are a modern day hero you save people lifes you save their life earnings so thank you so so much!
You should make a bean virus I think it would be funny
Brother, don't go to India! It's not a good time to be traveling to places like that! We love the work you're doing, but I think i can speak for alot of your fans, please don't go there! If one of the head Honchos there found out you were headed there, you might just end up on a milk carton and never seen again! Stay vigilant in the US and be our hero here! This is coming from a recently retired Police Officer who thinks you're doing an awesome job!
Scammers are evil
Great video. I am going to go from Subscriber to Paid Member. I love what you do to help stop SCAMMING.

Thanks a lot man. Good job 👌🏼. We are from canada. And i received every other day from Air Duct cleaning services. Please stop them, it's so annoying for all canadian.
Saw marks video and I can’t believe these scams. I’d love to see more scammers getting some payback after taking advantage of so many. Thanks for doing something about it.
Take a bow sir take a bow
aaaand subscribed!
Very nice breakdown of the inter workings of this scam that is now a millions of dollars operation, hope this goes viral to spread the information about what is going on not only in the U.S. but around the world.  Great collaboration work from Jim, Mark and yes Pierogi.  Very grateful there are people like you gentlemen out there taking a proactive approach to this problem, glad to see the collaboration between scam baiters.  Best Subscription investment I have ever made LOL     Wish yo all the best --- Nice Payback
Fantastic work chaps. ‘Wipes tear from eye’ 🥲
Nice Xmas theme 🤣 These scams happens here in UAE too
I love Pierogi with Indian stuffing. My usual is fried with some sauerkraut but after this video I might switch to curry.
i get 3 of these calls a day.... I live in Australia.... I abuse them...they call me all sorts of names... but I would love to know how to get them back ... I would love to learn how to delete their files...
Perfect ❤️
Way to go guys!!  So proud of you and all you've done to stop scammers!
I love what you do. My grandfather (now passed) fell victim to similar scammers a few years ago (involving his bank account, I’m unclear on the specifics) and almost again when they got a phone call from their “grandson” saying he (I?) had been in a car crash and was in jail and my nose was broken (explaining why I sounded funny). Thankfully, before he ran out to buy iTunes cards to pay for the supposed attorney I needed to get the charges dropped, he called me on my cell. I had to explain to him for 10 minutes how I was at a library, not in jail and my car and nose were fine. I would like to think in a calmer situation that he would know attorneys generally don’t expect payment upfront and especially don’t accept iTunes cards as payment!
This is just the beginning 🔥🔥🔥
Yessss
I love this. Next scam call, delete system32 files.
Glitter BOMBS?  Change them to DIE PACKS same used on Bank robbers.
I love the different presentation in this video.  It really shows how passionate you are about this work and taking care of those vulnerable people in our communities.  Thank you so much for what you’re doing. ❤️❤️
As soon as you started singing Posty 🤣
i just wonder who tf is disliking this video
Love this already and I’m not even a minute in. Excellent stuff Pierogi.
What’s the difference between getting a call that says “spam” or, “spam risk” ??
Couldn't  stop steering to your hair...
Man I can’t like this enough.
Keep up the good work you're making great progress especially with awareness of these scammers. Great videos you're a natural story teller
The government should form you all into a task force. This was like the Avengers assembling.
1:29 Wait, it's Boyinaband?    Always has been
You guys are amazing!!
You 3 coming to India will be so amazing..  But bring your cops with you to catch those bastards! I hope you understand what I mean😅😂
Can we all appreciate how great Pierogi looked in that dress 😅👏👗💋💄
EPIC, cant say more than that, than thank you guys EPIC Job xxx
His crying was so convincing that I shed a tear. Somebody give that man an oscar!
As of the time of this comment, 46 scammers disliked this video lol

India is more beautiful if these scammers weren't here, they are the ones who make our country come to a shame
Shoutout to Mark Rober and Jim Browning. The three of you did a great job!!
well done.
You are a star. Well done, all of you
Awesome, thank you! Go to India someday, that would be great! The best thing to do is to inform people so that they can't get scammed. 🙂
Amazing, you rock 🙌🙌❤❤
Wow...  what a brilliant collaboration!! I love all you guys and the work you do! Thank you👍 can't wait for the next one 😁💜
I love me some pahst malone
Yesssssss pink nails, Vivian's killin' it!

Odd....I had to resub?
Name a better trilogy. I'll wait.
CRYING STEVEN
Not all hero's wear capes!
Google DOX 4:20
Doing gods work
How is it that 3 guys and youtube make me feel more protected from fraud than the F.B.I.?
In 2012 I was working in a Walgreens. We had an older  gentleman who kept coming in buying gift cards. Shortly there after we got the policy come down that we had to start asking questions when large amounts of gift cards were purchased by a single customer. So when he came in, I asked him why he was buying these cards. He told me that the FBI was demanding payment out of him and that they'd contacted him by phone. I was the one who had to tell him that he was being robbed. He looked so defeated.  It disgusts me that almost a decade later, not only is this crap still happening, but it seems like it's a growth industry. The government needs to wake up. These criminal networks need to get shut down.  EDIT: I just want to make it clear, from what I gathered out of what he eventually told me, it had seemed like they were running a different scam on him, but he was refusing to pay believing it to be a scam. So they were pretending to be the FBI to put pressure on him.
Love that Polish food...
I wonder when these scammers will start using voice mods to sound less Indian
Thank you for all your hard work..I love you!
There's something about when "Granny" lectures the scammers ("It's unbecoming of you!") that always makes me burst out laughing.
This is the best!
This is helping the cops in a way but your also giving them money
I never want to meet the random few people who disliked this video.
thank you so much for doing this, you're a hero
This reminds me of the time James Randi busted Peter “Petey” Popoff. Immoral/unethical human beings scamming their fellow humans...so very sad. And unfortunately, Popoff isn’t the only American based scammer using religion this way.    Best of luck.
I really do love what you do
These scammers are so unprofessional one would think they didnt receive proper customer service training 😂 also Vivian looks amazing for 80! You go girl!
Did anyone else notice "React Favicon" in banks favicon? :) 05:14
Modern Day Hero 🙏 ✌🐜💚
Awesome job, the world needs more  people like you all.  My sis almost got scammed  by a fake grandma call.  Thankfully  she was able to reason it out and never sent the money.  I have showed her the you tube  videos you put out and all she had to say was she is glad you guys are around.   Thanks for sharing.
We love you, Vivian...
Dude, some law enforcement agency should give you a special commission to hunt these jackasses full-time.
Keep doing what you're doing.  These scammers are destroying innocent lives.
What's the difference between a hacker and a scammer?? Nothing in my opinion 🤷‍♀️ scumbags 😠
hey jim, as an indian I am ashamed of this trust me a 100% we hate these fools too
So so so glad you do this! You truly protect the innocent!
Thanks peirogi!  Glad to see some action finally taken by the police.
Thank you for getting the scammers! You should go on the News, lots of people watch it! Some how this needs to be brought to their attention!
Where was the arrest ? He told someone on the live wait until Saturday.
you, jim and mark should get in touch with kitboga... you guys would make the ultimate scammer payback team
Y’all are cool as hell!!!😂😂😂😂
Y'all guys are my heroes
Eye opening, thanks Pierogi
That was awesome!!! Brilliant, it is very much appreciated that someone is doing something about these people.
If you disliking this video, you are a scammer. :)
Proud of you for this one man!  Very well done! Sending love from Texas!✌🏼
Is this just a teaser? I don't understand
Oh no, baby. What did you do to your hair?
12:47 the big reveal
awesome video pierogi its been well worth the wait for this
Jim Browning had once scammed scammers in India and they have really appreciated his skills and used to call him "buddy"
Thats just a mule. For all we know they were just trying to get by. Thats why they have the phone recording, also I wouldn't do anymore unironic drag. But I say this with love.
YUHUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Dude, thank you.
It's amazing. I have received these scam calls over the last 4 years and i have called the FCC, FTC, FBI, Louisiana attorney General office, etc and told them to contact you and jim Browning to work together to shut these scammers down and those organizations just brush me off.  Maybe jim Browning, yourself, and the like should call the same organizations to apply pressure to shut those centers down.
Wow.  Showed this to my Aunt who said she was getting calls. She now understands what I was telling her. She will share. It was worth the wait 💜💜
Been so excited for this video! Great job!
The dislikes are from "Microsoft".
Hate I missed the premier but omg I’m so excited to see this!!
Your edits are on point lol love your videos keep it up brother ! you help a lot of people
Vivian is feeling her oats in that leopardprint dress!
Okay, but that lipstick is great on you.
An amazing job done by Pierogi, Jim and Mark. A great video and love how it was done as a PSA on scammers. I am so proud to be part of this community and can't wait to see what comes in the future. #WeAreAllScambaiters
It's been a hell of a ride, you guys are an inspiration.
bro whoever dislike the vid is scammer
Welcome to India. Southern India.  I am willing to assist.  God bless.
I would have liked to see her face and her name and some details about her arrest and charges. I feel a little let down
This is brilliant, definitely worth the wait. Proud of you 👍
This needs to be on the news
Wonderful hair 🏆
I recommend watching marks and jims videos too, this video alone is not a sufficient explanation of whats going on
Bro keep up the good work you are amazing and your content is so cool❤
I recommend watching the Mark Rober and Jim Browsing to get the full story. I waited days to see this extra piece of the puzzle and kind of disappointed it didn't include anything new to the story.
Legendary! Keep it up!
Awesome work! But why is anyone not mentioning Vivian??? 🤣😅😂
I never pictured Vivian as a blonde - I was sure she was a feisty redhead...
Ill be honest, the demonstration by the one and only  Vivian Rodgers just broke down so many walls that I don't know which one is 4th anymore.  By the way really good video.  Way to go down the funnel.
Excellent presentation! Looking forward to even better ways of bringing down scammers. Great job to all who were involved in creating this video.  So, did that girl get arrested?
+500k 👍
Scammers: (exist) Scammer Payback: I’m gonna destroy these guys’ entire career.
Love this.  Love what y'all are doing.
definitely shared this.
Scammer...go to the store I won't cry 😀😀
Funny how people dislike this. These dudes are the real life Starsky & Hutch....except they don’t have the cool car!
This reminds me of an episode of the podcast of Reply All where they go all the way to India to track a scammer. The glitterbomb tactic is genius, wonderfully edited video!
In all honesty mate, with wig and makeup you're more attractive than I thought!
Much love to you Pierogi, as well as Mark and Jim!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 Thank you for everything you do to bring light and educational to all of us,  regarding these scumbags. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
WINNER!!!!!!
thank you guys for all you do
<3
Thank you for explaining in how the scammers find their targets.  An even simpler explanation with simple visual examples geared to an elderly audience would go a long way towards creating awareness in that community and reducing the opportunities for scammers.  Think of it as a public service announcement for seniors.
First premier i missed :( GREAT VIDEO. #WeAreAllScambaiters
I was hopping to meet vivian rogers 😂
Somebody bought a bunch of stock assets today...
Freaking awesome!
Although this video is great, it is incomplete. Thanks for this anyway
Love the wig and lipstick, Viv.
That bomb was amazing👍🏻👏🏻 and Vivian is much prettier than i thought too!☺️ Great stuff Scammer Payback and friends⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Woman don't scam they are ladies and ladies don't behave this way how dare you catch a woman scammer this is is sexist! Aaarrrggghh! 💪🏼
I was waiting for this one
I just watched a new to me scambaiter who goes by DAYO. He's been trying to get the Pittsburgh P.D. off their butts. Listen to the phone calls he makes to them, they could care less.
F___ Yeah Pierogi....Another deserved "Deal-With"....!!!  You're awesome brother!
Sooooo fkn cool that you guys teamed up!!! You guys rock!!!
Tip: When a scammer calls you, either decline the call, or pick up, swear and scream at them for about 5 minutes straight in every language you know, and hang up.
I cant believe how many dishonest people like this are out there, but I'm really glad that you, Jim and Mark partnered up to do this and say "We care, and we are going to put in are extra 200% to stop this."
dude, did i miss something or did the channel blow up recently? :D i thought it had like sub 100k subs just a while ago. well deserved and great work as always.
This is the type of information and video that ALL BANKS need to be running in their lobby at all times. I have watched several others and it is maddening to hear people getting lied to and stollen from.
There needs to be a scammer awareness week where people get educated about this stuff.
If it's even possible I would love to see you guys send dozens of these glitter bombs at a call center. Great work as always!
Wait when did YOU confront scammers face to face? I swear I watch all your videos. I don't mean to bust your balls over semantics but those other 2 guys aren't you. I support everything you do, not sure why that annoyed me lol
Litterley the thumbs down are all from india phone centers....
You guys are the real Heroes, Thank you for everything you do to help slowdown, sabotage or just flat out prevent these leeches from scamming innocent people. It's heartwarming to know that there are truly good people like you out there constantly fighting the good fight behind the scenes.
This should be released on Netflix Documentary show
Good job... I am with you too. I have only a request to you is that please don't stereotype entire Indians because of these bastarda. I have heard and watched news that many of these scammers are scamming inside their country too.
❤️❤️❤️ I LOVE UR VIDEOS. 😂😂😂 THEY SO FUNNY.
Question. Am I able to get a glittebomb to give these people XD
I have a virtual machine set up for when the scammers call (currently at least once a day at the moment), it is wonderful when I flatly refuse to let them have the money back. They get even more upset when I invite them to my office and then tell them I'm at the National Crime Agency!
Karl Rock is the ground guy in India. Gotta do more work with him and Jim!
This may not be a Politically Correct thing to say, but whenever you hear a person on the Phone with an INDIAN ACCENT, just immediately think SCAM and hang up. ( Indian Accent = Scammer ). Another tell is a person with a HEAVY Indian Accent, telling you his name is JASON McCARTHY, or Jim Wilson, or some other WESTERN English Name. (SCAMMER !!!!).
Best video yet
Are these guys African not from India
Allah/God bless! Fighting for justice is one of the most noble acts! Making entertaining/educative content makes it even BETTER!   Thank you 🙏♥
So this is why I couldn't find it before. It wasn't uploaded yet.
Awesome production.
It’s awesome to see from inside the glitter 💣 😂  🤪🤪
Now I get the whole drag make up thing .Very cool Keep up the great work guys ..
Great job to all of you. Watched Jim and Mark's videos too.
Great work! You, Jim and Kitboga have some of the best channels on youtube. Such a wonderful job by entertaining and educating.
Anyone else want to see glitterbomb Vs Pierogi?
amazing work well done for working as a team and bringing these bastards down piece by piece
I don't ever answer calls with numbers I don't recognize because if you want to talk to me you can text me and tell me who you are
So freaking proud!!!!
I'm all for this work, however there are people who are targeting scammers and don't know the difference between a scammer and local business with employees who have foreign accents. I had someone who called my beauty salon and inferred that we were scammers because when an employee was returning a phone call we received (most likely from a scammer spoofing their number) the person on the other end was someone who likes to harass scammers.  They called multiple times to harass us even though I obviously don't have a foreign accent and own an established business.  We ended up blocking the number, however we fear escalation from this individual.  For someone in the business of harassing scammers, they should get to know the difference between how a scammer acts on the phone vs a non-scammer with a foreign accent.  Thumbs up to Pierogi, Jim, and Mark, but I caution encouraging people to do the same work especially in the current racial and cultural issues we are facing in the US now.  I don't want my employees, my salon, or any other foreign worker to be targets because people don't understand the difference between scammers and non-scammers.
This was worth waiting for. Thank you!!! 🎉🤟
I literally LOL'd at Miss Vivian cameo appearance ...
This is so satisfying 😂
Wow dude. That is absolutely crazy. I love your devotion to tracking these scammers down and putting then up to the light. You need to go to india
CONGRATS ON THE SUCCESS PIEROGI. LOVE WHAT UR DOIN FOR VICTIMS OUT THERE .
The government doesn't care
Santa hats, blue hair and telling scammers that she loves him. I've no idea what's going on at this stage.
The man is an absolute Mensch!!
I wonder who give 32 👎 😅😅😅
I love this, I got scammed once 3 years ago, and then again when I tried to buy a train ticket off a website. I love what you do keep doing it. I feel vindicated when I watch your videos. I support you 100% ❤️❤️❤️
Imagine kitboga joining the party
Pls keep this going! Love the work you do and the creativity behind it
The scam baiting community has grown so much and there are so many talented people going above and beyond to take down these scammers.
Great work thank you
The governments of the world (where these scammers are targeting) should hire you, Jim Browning, and Kitboga... and build TASK FORCES around you.
Great work Pierogi, as always. This needs to be picked up by worldwide news, everyone needs to see this, especially our elderly loved ones so they wont be a victim.
GRAMS is packing some cash for officer Kyle from DEA, interesting to listen to what length this scammers will go to try to scam innocent victims.
Pierogi upped his editing game in this one
Thank you❤️
This editing is on point!! Do you do your own editing?
awesome.  thanks for your hard work.  well worth the wait.
You guys are doing incredible work!
Mark straight up exposed her in his video😂😂😂
I missed pretty vivian! ;) well done !!
Dayum! Vivian is HOT!!! 😅
Mm
Most scammers don’t like it when I mention their mothers.
Wow
Just an idea, why don't you teach others about how to stop these scammers. A number of people would be willing to sign up to you classes to stop these scammers, and everyone will sleep a bit peacefully knowing that there's a small army of anti-scammers fighting against such crimes. Besides, what u are doing might be tiring for a single person to carry out alone, sohaving a small team would help out a lot, and u would be able to catch more criminals.
Mary Swanson... nice Dumb and Dumber reference!
Disgusting predators

I was hoping this would build on the other two videos.  Kind of disappointed...
Love live scammer killers!   Pierogi ScammerBait aka Vlad and the infamous Jim Browning. F'ing love you guys. Ever in Toronto the beer and ladies are on me!
Dont sing Post Malone, I'll unsub for that reason alone
I want more 😍😍😍
This is amazing. I watched the rober video where he threw an insane birthday party for a kid with Cancer. You are all doing such amazing things in your own ways, and it's just incredible. You're helping so many people. I love you guys so so much, we watch your videos every single day!!! 💕♥️❤️💕❤️♥️❤️🥰🥰😘🥰😍😍🥰💕❤️😍🥰😘🥰😔❤️😊🥰💕🥰💕💕♥️♥️
Excellent video. It deserves to be shown on prime-time TV and worldwide.
I always tell them ok charge my account(the one that doesn't exist) and hang up.
The three of you working together is amazing! Keep up the good work - many vulnerable people need your help
Awesome vid much love good work pierogi 🙂
My heroes.
Magnificent
Great work everyone!
Maggie
“I didn’t raise you this way” Lol!
Love your work 💯 ✌️ from Dublin 🇮🇪
that is EPIC! Also ur content has really high quality. You are really cool!
I was waiting for this.  That collab was epic. I'm looking forward to see many more.
Good video
I wondered when you would post your collaboration video with Mark Rober. He is the one that led me to your channel and I'm now subscribed.
thank you, Vivian
Super heroes don't always wear capes. . .  sometimes they have blue-tinted hair!   Good for you, Pierogi (and Mark Rober) !!!
If you are "mom" and Jim's the daddy, does that makes Mark the child??? Hmmmmm
Vivian is a babe!
I'm glad English is not our first language and we don't have to deal with these scammers 😂.  That scammer who faked crying hahaha
I don’t think you should hide their faces. These scammers deserves their faces to be shown everywhere in my opinion. That will be a lesson for them.
Guna be honest. If a box spits at me thne starts counting down, id be getting the fuck away from it.
Love the vids man
I never dreamed that we were headed here when I first started following you. Thank you Pierogi. 😎☮️👍
Such a great effort  from you, Jim Browning and Mark Rober. Thank you for having us
Great job!!!
“The ultimate scammer payback.”   *cocks gun*
The money mule are the new drug dealers.
Good work m8. Keep fighting for the naive.
You folks are doing a great service to mankind. Hats of to you. More and more people are getting into fighting scammers. I wonder if you guys all should set up a secret website, for you guys only, where you can work together and learn from each other. Tis time the three of you worked together with fabulous results. Keep up the good work. Proud of you.
Theses videos genuinely have made me much more aware of the many scams. Thanks for your hard work
What an absolutely fantastic, educational and brilliant collaboration video with Pierogi, Mark Rober and Jim Browning.  Everybody needs to see this and share it with family x
This was one of the best things I’ve ever seen. All three of you have uploaded your side and it’s great. Keep it up!
Very high production quality, respect to ya! x))
Pog
Can we have a superbowl add or something to make public awareness regarding this kind of scamming...
10/10 on editing 👌👌
Scammer payback is the embodiment get a hospital but not for me. I'm so glad all of the scam baiting community are truly educating everyone on these scams because the only thing we can do is spread awareness.
Cheers for all your hard work never let them win cheers for that se London
You wore that lipstick & wig a bit too confidently. 😂 Good job to all three of you!
You should have courses to teach people to do what you can do to the scammers
This is one of the most ambitious crossover that we all needed!. Your POV was a nice overarching recap of the project and goals to round up Mark's fun and dramatic main content story after the intense tease from Jim's video.  Keep doing what you do!! Cheers~
Man, I don't have a clever comment or anything, just, thank you so much for all you're doing to help those who are being taken advantage of. Thank you for all the time and hard work and passion you put into this, I'm glad it's starting to get the recognition it deserves <3
Great job. Proud to take part in this.
Whoot!!! Keep up the great work! Thanks for including the GOAT Vivian! 😋
This is only the beginning. Let's spread awareness of these scams.
Wow Pierogi!!! Well worth the wait! Marvelous work😍😍😍
Excellent work!
Fabulous, worth the wait. I’m so  proud of you Pman. 🧡💙🧡💙
Foil doesnt do ANYTHING, it can Still be detected in scans..... Scammers are stupid
Jim Browning is my hero!
It's horrible that scammers like these exist on this planet, but what is great is that people like Pierogi and Mark Rober are there to help people, and we need more people like them in this world.
Loved the Vivienne package demo. LMAO!
That was EPIC ,thank you so much for all the hard work that was involved in bringing us this video and thank you for being a hero for all the victims 👏💙💙💙
Glad I was able to finally make it, P!   Saw a lot of familiar faces including your sweet one.   Terrific video!  May you skyrocket from here.
Pierogi: "There's going to be something in my version of the video that the others don't have" Well, he wasn't lying
Thank you all for tracking down these scammers! It helps so many people every day.
Excellent work as always. Maybe someday we can get rid of the scammed doing the car warranty expirations. Looking forward to your next videos and busts.
yay... looking forward to this
Yoooooo! I saw this story on Mark Rober's Channel!
I was so excited that I couldn't even type the stuff that I wanted to type
Awesome!!!!!! I know a few elders who have been scammed. Even told to buy 10 I phones and send to texas. Low lives.
I wish there was a way I could help out
They aren't ready!
Not all Heroes wear capes.
You guys are amazing!! Thank you for everyone you all have saved!💜✌
I cannot wait for the day that you show up in Calcutta!

Stripper glitter! Stuff gets in every Crack and you can't get rid of it lol
You are a legend!
Best part of glitter bombing...authorities involved.
Mąkę these scammers go to jail
did vivian get a facelift? I thought she was old.
Im torn between scamming is horrible but people dumb enough to fall for it deserve it🤷
I was so waiting for this video
I was just wondering why you have the word Ki-t-bo-ga blocked??
Premiere gang rise up
best youtube collab this year so far
Government is doing nothing cause there worries about people who go to trump rallies.
scammer crying to get sympathetic old people to send money distgusting
Scammers calling me while I'm watching this video 😧
This is fantastic
Nice dress, you slay in that! 😀
I wish banks would figure out how to block "edit source HTML" in a browser.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I bet all the thumbs down are from scammers
You'd make a beautiful woman!
when he cried i legit laughed so hard i couldnt breathe......i guess i almost died of laughter lol..
This scammer sounds like my little sister when she's trying to get her way xD
People talking in live chat, while I’m chillin in the comments 😎

Dabblu dabblu dabblu......
I can not put into words how much rage I have about these people. Hope you’ll be able to destroy internet scams for good

Dubu dubu dubu
GET IN! Can't wait to see this!
Excellent!
You are so amazing and I am so glad that you have gotten this far.

Let’s goo
Time to glitter bomb some Bellends lol
This is epic
These 3 guys are legends
This could be a upgraded "catch the scammer" video style to your current YouTube version where many people are doing similar things and networking to catch these guys. Keep it up.
💯💯😁
i'm curious how many people who are subbed to scammer payback are scammers
Scammers are so disgusting but at the same time they provide us with these kind of entertainment.  I hope scambaiters like Jim, Pierogi and Kitboga and also great engineers like Mark get more of them.    And entertain us more
Best video
Watched all these live streams, can't wait to see the payoff, so proud of you man
Glitter enhances every celebration.
ITS HAPPENING!
My boy mark😌
Since then I knew u and Mark for a long time I was do happy for u to team up!Keep up your funny great work!
this ought to be good
I'm here for the reaction of the angrey scammer
Ah
Please report these scammers to your Indian subscribers. They could help in closing down of these cells via cyber security
I've been watching all you and Jim browning along with other scam baiters for a long time and always loved Mark Robers videos. Amazing to see you all team up together and see some real payback being given out to the scammers. Hope there's lots more to come!
My engineering skills are lacking.  So to combat package thieves, I filled an amazon box with two layers of packaging popcorn sandwiched around a layer of dog crap...
Ayyy
The people that disliked are Salty Scammers
Congratulation to all of you. Pierogi, Mark and Jim! We appreciate what you have done and continue to do!
Pierogi's video are gonna be used as training tools for all incoming employees at the scam centers ;^)

The gaudy oval worrisomely measure because taxicab substantively attach except a hard gondola. greedy,  flagrant bra

You sir are a riot to watch. I love trolling scammers, I'm not as cool as you, Mark, and Jim though I just waste their time.
Please update us on Jeffrey!
Are we going to see more than what we saw on Jim & Mark's videos?
The Avengers of the anti-scamming world have teamed up!
Waiting...👍
Brilliant idea for a collaboration! Well done for pulling this off!
Love the videos man. You and Jim Browning have inspired me to become a cyber security technician/ ethical hacker. I am taking my last class tomorrow and I wouldn’t have thought of doing this with out y’all.
Imma1st_
how did 8 people dislike a video that hasn’t even started?! these guys are doing amazing work, helping some of the most innocent victims, the elderly, who worked there whole life for their savings, and these assholes take it away in a second. thank you guys 💗💗
I haven't seen it yet but I still liked the video
I love your videos so much lol
Still waiting.....😀😀😀😀😀
This chanel exploded with subscribers
wao im before the stream even started pog
This is going to be epic !!!!!!!!!!!
Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
This is awesome y’all teamed up. So many lives have been destroyed by these heartless, evil people. Thank you, thank you, a million times thank you.
Any video that has Mark Rober, Jim Browning, and Scammer Payback will be EPIC!
As a Black woman I want to drop my perspective, which undoubtedly will be unpopular. You can take it or leave it: I find many of these videos in very bad taste. Let me just say that yea, scamming is bad. I do not condone scamming activities AT ALL. No one should ever be scammed, especially older folks who are vulnerable and typically trusting. On the flip side, I see a White man sitting comfortably in a computer chair, behind a bunch of expensive computers and a vaporizer in America while degrading people of color from an impoverished nation. Many of these videos have been edited with demeaning caricatures misrepresenting the callers and jumbled closed captioning misrepresenting their broken English. This channel has done more than just expose insidious crimes, it also is demeaning whole ethnic groups. You can be a good person and do good things AND still step in poo once in awhile. I would implore the creator to take a look on how he is constructing and presenting his content and what sort of image he is trying to portray. There are many young, White men who would watch this and see this as a way to degrade a group of people, or worse (I am thinking about the Asian Atlanta shootings). Maybe the creator needs a person from India on his team to help bring in a perspective he is lacking. We can and should always strive for better. Especially in 2021. Peace ✌🏽
Congratulations Pierogi on your successful collaboration with Jim and Mark.I can see on your face and hear in your voice the toll it has taken on you. Please don't feel like you have disappointed your followers! We know the hard work it has taken and the long hours put in for US.!! You have a follower for life here. I know I'm only one senior but you reach millions of people every day and in all corners of the world. This is something you can be very proud of. Will always be here for you and your family the best I can. Know , Pierogi ,that you and your faithful   community will always be here for you.You are LOVED and ADMIRED.😍😍😍

Why don't you three make a team like Avengers ? I think Scamvengers will be great.
Thanks for using your creativity and intelligence for this cause. 💖
I’ve watched both Jim’s and Marks and been anticipating part three of this. Y’all inspire me to scam baiting and waste these guys time the best I can.
Can not wait for your video. I am so excited to see all the hard work start to finish, I know blood sweat & tears as gone in to this. I've just set my reminder. I will be home from dialysis so will be able to watch on my big TV on the sofa. I hope you make sure now this is done u start getting some proper sleep.  See you later on 😀😀😀
