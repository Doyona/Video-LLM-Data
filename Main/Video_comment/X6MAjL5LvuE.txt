Apink es Apink, es el mejor grupo que ha logrado una trayectoria muy amplia y sigue activo desde hace 14 años ✨
노래 개좋네..
November 2025 and I can't wait for the new comeback on January 2026!! ✨
Kbizoom article extract: Apink is set to make a long-awaited full-group comeback, kicking off their 15th anniversary celebrations with a brand-new album scheduled for January 2026, according to a report from SPOTV News on November 17.
Apink é o único grupo de kpop que gostei. Apink forever 🐼💖🇧🇷
Any Panda from 2025 is here?🥲
Rewatching while waiting for another comeback. Its been 2 years tho. Really hope they get to sing this on university festivals. The adult version of NoNoNo for me. Really catchy sound and lyrics just not promoted enough
It's a song that I come back to visit often when life is overwhelming. I really grow up with apink.
힘든 시간들이 지나면, 정말 멋진 날들이 올 거예요. 여러분은 그걸 충분히 해낼 수 있어요! 여러분의 꿈은 이미 시작되었습니다. 지금은 조금 힘들어도, 그 끝은 분명히 빛날 거예요. 모든 일은 시간과 노력에 따라 이루어집니다. 여러분은 반드시 원하는 목표를 이룰 수 있을 거예요.
2023? wow already 2 years >>
보미의 보컬파트가 제일 좋다.
에이핑크 컴백은 축하드립니다 🎉😊
I miss Apink releasing new songs

Come backkkkkkk pleaseeee
Let's go 20m!
come back！！！please
언니들 콘서트 제발 ..
i love thiiiiiis
ヴォーカル力が半端ない👍️
今でも待ってる！
it's crazy to me that i never was at the beginning of apink, not even in their "prime" or whatever, they came to me in one of the most unexpected ways... and since then i never thought i could love a group this much, let alone so far away from me... what i'm trying to say is, i wish for apink so much more, because this industry can be so unfair, i just hope they can do what they really love forever, what really makes them happy and satisfied, and that that's what the whole world can see... i'm just so emotional today, and i just feel that not enough people knows how important this song is, and i can't seem to talk about my love for them with anyone else, so i'm leaving this now here as a wish for better things, for apink and for all pandas... wish we can hold each other for a very very very long time.
2025년도??

I like this song ❤🎉
Got my tickets! Feb Singapore
Naeun is experimenting with K-pop again. I'm one of those who wished her all the best with acting and still do. In the meantime, it's reported in the press that YG* is phasing out its actor management services.  *Last I heard, Naeun is with YG. Maybe a blend of K-pop and acting for her then. Good.
Feb 2025 ticket 🎟

When they sing orion their japanese song and remember with just 4 members.. all the nostalgic feelings resurface and I miss my ot6 😭
Shawol here and i give all my support for this beautiful song
i love you apink <3
Where is Naeun?😢
About one comment per day and snail speed with the views. There was such support (including defence) of DND when it first hit. But too soon those hyping it vanished.   I agree with the poster a few comments below about the meaningful lyrics. I suspect tho, most early praise of the sonics weren"t genuine.   They need another banger if Apink is going to remain financially viable for the members and their agencies. I hope they have at least one more full-blooded go.
DND 1
love you apink
God the lyrics are so good.  I felt so deflated after failing my driving test today. I was so disappointed in myself. Just made mistakes I don't normally make and my lessons have been going so well.  I instantly got cheered up.  계속 걸어 네 방식대로 Find your way Keep walking In your own way, find your way  If anyone's reading this, I just want to say if you're going through something, stay strong and keep at it. You're stronger than you think. ❤ I've been through a lot and made progress I once thought wasn't possible. You're absolutely not alone in feeling stuck.
This is not about DND  Stop polluting the search results
Necesito un concierto de ellas en México porfavor❤
i found u miss night .❤❤❤❤ 😅
This song brings me life in 2024, I miss Apink 💙
I’m a fan of Apink for a long time,and I felt love/hate feeling towards them,because my ultimate bias Naeun is left,and it seemed like I could not look at them anymore .But today I finally payed attention to this comeback without Naeun,and after listening to the lyrics and meaning carefully it opened up more.I feel relieved and I can finally love Apink again❤ I feel like this comeback is also has message for Naeun,to not look back,to let the regrets go away,Her girls are aside,but they can rebirth and shine even more, even being apart❤
Она разная днем и ночью!😂😊
👔 💐💐❤❤🌹🌹
Listening with headphones is a must 😊
❤❤❤
I hope Apink have an Comeback soon  I miss them 😢❤
As an old fan I really love apink's music style. hope that they can do more MV like nonono and Mr chu
There is no Na Eun

Still love this song and listen to it a lot! I’m still waiting for comeback 2024!
I thought Apink were having a comeback tomorrow according to sources but there hasn’t been no teasers and Namjoo is still promoting her song
涙の女王からきました
MDS como não fiquei sabendo disso , chocada amei
I'm just disconnected for some tym from k-pop and this song's starting was expressing my feelings and also a bit motivating too. Let's DND now. Love and support from India ❤❤
this song is so comforting
Just dnd now comeback apink
Omg =)

벌써 1년됐네..😢
Happy 1st Anniversary DND❤😢..Comeback with another BOP
Apink forever !!!❤
Fan Song commeth.  On March 30th, Apink announced that they would release a new song for fans on April 19th.  Celebrating their 13th debut anniversary this year.  The Kbizoom article makes the point that Apink is one of the few 2nd Gen groups to still be active. I've read elsewhere that second contracts in K-pop are as rare as 2%
Help to keep these ladies in the music industry with a few views at least. Please let the ads run.  Courtesy of allkpop via newsnow: Apink's Namjoo has dropped her performance music video for "BAD".  In the above MV, Namjoo performs against flashing lights. "BAD" is the title song of her second single album of the same name, and it's about being honest despite the world labeling you as bad.
Hellow
갓띵곡
lindas voces arrasaram aqui um dos melhores grupos APINK
I'm still in school when they debut in 2011, now in 2024 I'm doing my degree :)
❤
Apink =)
Allkpop: (Namjoo has dropped her highlight melody for 'BAD'.)   May the force be with her.
I wish that this year 2024, APINK will hit again!! I've been a fan of them since 2015, Apink will always have a place in my heart ❤

Waiting for December 11 to come! Let's go Apink 💗
Sayang Apink banyak banyak ❤
I just found out 4 members left the company. But will still be part of Apink. But can you think of a time that actually worked? Seriously can you? Because all I know are is Girl’s Generation and Mamamoo and from what I can tell GG had one comeback in 5 years and MMM well they hadn’t had a comeback for 2023 and isn’t this the her her contract expires and Hwasa left the “company” this year but not the group but I beginning to think left group but not company is code for silently broke up. I really thought Apink was gonna make it a few more years. There one comeback in April was almost becoming a holiday tradition for me
This music video feels like a Wes Anderson movie
Apink is really the best group!!!^^
missing the girlss
Essa roupa da Eunji é muito legal e combina com a personalidade descontraída dela.

Eunji with those vocals. Bomi with those visuals. Love this so much.
A few more comebacks and they will be a 2nd gen group in the time of 5th gen

It’s a bright song that somehow calms the heart❤
Thank u Apink for always being there , no matter whats era of kpop.. i'm very grateful
Apink is really consistent to their music type. Been loving this group since first year in high school and now just graduated in college. Can’t express how proud I am of these ladies.
"DND" means "do not disturb"?
this song is making me hard.. like.. hard as a rock.. idk why tho
この曲はイヤホンで聞くと良さが倍になります。
정은지님 딩고 뮤직 나와주셔서 감사합니다. 덕분에 노래 잘 들었어요..😊
Essa música é boa demais, pelamor de deus, mundo, apreciem isso.
Love this song! So catchy😍
Hayoung in maid clothes remind me to Momo Twice
them putting Namjoo for the final chorus was a very good decision, She really nailed that part
Faltan dos integrantes que pasó con ellas?
Apink👼🐼
Does "DND" mean Dungeons and Dragons?

omg
My favorite KPop group. And without Na-Eun they still have not disappointed me in the slightest.
Çok seviyorum sizi cokkk

Hi peapink2013
English ver please 🥺
This is a very cute and fun song. however, i must admit when i saw the title, i was expecting it to be about dungeons and dragons...
This is perfect to preface a great D&D night with my friends!
such a low key banger dang

Those of us still visiting here make for a tough audience. Someone effectively revealing that Apink had been a part of half their life and not a single tick.
Ohh 18M ♡
1:42 center girl’s biceps tho 🔥 the choreo reminds me of their cutesy days but the song has a slightly more mature feel
❤😊
Luvvv
Yaaayyyy
OMG
Apink is really the best team!!!^^
지금  아이돌은요  잠자고  일어나면   신삥  들이   딱  들어오고
Oioii
Baru nyadar Naeun udah hengkang. Pantesan kaya ada yg kurang.
Sigo a Apink desde que tenía 11 años de edad, son parte de mi infancia y ahora que tengo 22 años me hace sentir muy orgullosa de ellas, han sido un grupo que les tengo alta admiración ❤❤❤
Aoink
Ayodance 😎👊
Always loved Apink plus they are the opposite of what a friend said "they cant stay adorable forever"
Para mi una canción tan pero tan buena las de blackpink, twice o incluso las new jeans, que pena que no tenga mas vistas!
Kesini karena ada di iklan tv hehe
Happy birthday Bomi!
APINK Y PANDA FOREVER. 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
I love you girls, just keep going 😍❤️👍🏻
Kok gak ada orang indo
I was looking for a different DnD.. I guess Im in the wrong section.
i hope next comeback we can give wins to Apink to set a record for it. they deserve it so much. this kind of songs not cutesy but targetting those fans who grew up with them
kpop stans really sleeping on this masterpiece. this is much better than those kpop songs that are noise to ears.
https://youtu.be/vgy93HwOSJg
Omg
my girls, my best girls!! Thank you for cheering me up in my darkest times
these lyrics are really for adulting stage!
i was depressed in my room and suddenly i found this song, now i'm really happy  apink always cheers me up 🐼💗

Apink must still be doing something(s) right and certainly do NOT sound finished as some  try to insinuate. They're 13th on the list for K-pop Girl Group Brand Reputation ahead of 37 others from Gen 2, 3 and 4.   Source: koreaboo reporting on research done by The Korean Business Research Institute. June 2023
엥 노래 왜 좋누
so glad Apink is still alive.
恩地真的很帥氣
La sonrisa de eunji me enamora, es un encanto verla sonreír. Si fuera guapo para ella y ella estuviera solita, le propondría algo como comenzar con una bella amistad y luego, pero creo que eso solo en mis sueños va a pasar 😂 Ni siquiera se su estado civil y no puedo suponer que con lo bella que es este sola.
La canción que más me encanta de todas en la my muy y buen video, ha y por cierto, me encanta la sonrisa de eunji.
Esta es una de las canciones que me gustan de APINK, las canciones de la disco horn no me gustaron volveré a escuchar la disco para ver si algúna canción me gusta.
Be kind❤😊
Extrañaba apink ❤ Sus voces son increíbles
연기 살아있네~ㅎㅎ
apink настоящие королевы kpop, они будут популярны всегда, их группа легендарна! то как их голоса мелодичны и сочитаются друг с другом, а так же то, что в каждй песне виден их стиль и концепт делает эту группу такой прекрасной!💞💋💓
Happy birthday Hayoung!
happy they are back ♥♥♥ proud of them for keeping the groupe going !!!!
( !_! )
to be honest this comeback was very different from the other ones and It makes me love it so much, this song makes me feel like I'm doubting myself but I need to be confident, and it's exactly what I need to hear everyday of my life because i have trust issues with myself, so thank you apink for making this heartwarming song 😀
This is a poor comeback with an instantly forgetable song list. I think they've ran their course to be honest.
Waiting Apink comeback again
See you on the 23rd in PH ladies! My mom's coming with me and I'm actually more excited for her 😂
Đỉnh quá
❤
PERFECTION.
APINK BEST GG
Love the bridge so much so soothing and uplifting ❤

この子たちの曲はとてもかわいくてすごく好き。 こういう曲の他のグループを知りたいです。
아니 이노래 날씨 좋은날 산책하면서 들으면 개 신나는데.... 생각보다 못뜬거 같아서 존나 아쉽네
What beautiful and talented girls ❤️❤️❤️
See you in the Philippines, Apink!
아니 믕지 강지구 이미지 씨게 박혀서 겁나귀엽다..ㅋㅋㅋ
Let's hype it up again, guys!
Apink are legendary ! to bad one left
I play this song everyday on my way to work to feel inspired, I'm so glad we have our fairies like them who reminds us that they are always here for us... I love Apink!!!!!
everyday listening to this
esta canción es muy linda
Sorry i lose of track but where's Son Na eun?
I can't believe that's it's only been 2 months since DND. I NEED APINK TO COMEBACK NOW!!! 😭
I'm just curious  how park chorong never change.  She looks so beautiful
Sorry folks but, this one is just dire. I thought Dilemma was a stinker but no matter how many times I listen to this one, the tune just refuses to stick. Perhaps it is just that they both had to follow the excellent "Durumdurum" or maybe we are kept waiting too long between comebacks, so expectations are heightened. For now, this will just have to serve as the definition of Unmemorable".🐼🦨👂⛔
♥
volviendo aqui, es tan hermosa la letra de la cancion
i still have songs apink in my phone 😊😊😊
apink forever since  april 19 2011😍☺☺
이런 그룹은 아무리 생각해도 돌려 생각해도 몇 번을 생각해도 유일한 것 같아. 내 말은..그냥 계속 앞으로도 에이핑크해줘. 판다는 따라 갈게😊 내가 은지 에이핑크 뉴스 시즌1 때 망치 뿌신 모습부터 판다 입덕이였지
loveeee

you don't know how I love this song so much!!
bop tbh..
보고 싶었어요 guys❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
DnD my favorite ❤
iloveyou always apink^_^
Although the number of views do not seem low relative to Copycat and Dilemma they are low. But I read that with DND Apink had their best first week sales. So, mercifully, there does not seem to be a strong correlation between views and sales.   Stepping away from detail, I really hope they come back and more than two or three times. If they do not then a rare talent that is more than sufficiently confident and competent to perform live beyond  a show's rehearsal will be lost. I wish them and their agencies lucrative performances and sales in the name of sustainability.
Melody is really exited~!!! Korea culture is top of the world But Korea politics so bad!! Especially election... The citizens protested against the fraudulent election
I support apink forever. How much effort did they put into this song? we should definitely show love to apink and this song
Eunji so pretty😍❤❤

Giành giựt du do nó thế
Nung nó vay ,quen nhieu
Có giá
De thương ma thuong k de,hihi...
I really miss Apink, I knew Apink in 6th grade. they are still beautiful, melodious and I still remember all the songs <3

no dungeons and dragons?
the best!!!!!!!!!!!!
i love how apink is one of the only kpop girl groups that changed their old sound and transitioned to a more mature concept and didn’t end up being corny. i swear most kpop girl groups that start switching their concepts because the members got older end up sounding boring or just corny. (********)
APINK DOES NOT DISAPPOINT

DND = Do Not Disturb mode?
💖💖💖💖💖🥰
Apink =)
It's ok, that's life. Most Pandas are adults now with lots of problems and not fully updated in KPOP anymore. LOL
Better than Dilema
Namjoo attract me with her dancing. She's indeed one of the best dancers in industry ♡
BEST!!! LOVE APINK
As Panda, To be honest I believe DND it's for Do Not Dilemma~ XD
Actually  I keep cominggg  Buuut Idk how or what to write...  XD I am afraid others would get bored reading my comment everytime~  APINKEUUU SARANGHAE 🎉
I love apink more than i love god.
This is very cool! Really like it
I didn't get what DND stands for. Is it 'do not disturb'? I like the song and concept, because it is not about love, it is about making a decision to change your life to the better.
What does D N D mean?
What D N D stands for? thanks! :)
心に染み入るメロディ大好きです☆
Stay strong po
Miss u po❤

2013~2014년 에이핑크의 색깔을 느낄 수 있는 곡입니다.
아이고 에이핑크 센세님덜 Apink 에이핑크 'D N D' 검색하면 원더케이 49만뷰짜리 영상만 나오잔수 이거 어떻게 된거여요 엥핑크 채널 영상먼저 뜨도록 바꿔보셔
진짜 우리 언니들 언제나 사랑해 평생 행복하자
Ate as usual ❤
Eu tenho tantos momentos felizes com Apink, me doi muito pensar que não vou ver elas juntas de novo, sou do famdom des de 2020 mas ainda dói muito! 🥺
십년도 전 에이핑크 노래들 느낌도 나면서.. 적당히 트렌디하고.. 어떻게 이런 노래를 만들었을까 진짜 너무 최고다
miss sonnaeun nuna😑
에이핑크는 더 인정받아야 한다. 그들은 아주 좋은 노래를 가지고 있습니다!
Apink give me the best vibes. queens ❤
Please stay with us forever and moreee :DD let's gooo!!~

they had too little promotion and marketing for this :( A-Pink really didn't follow up the huge success of Dumhdurum in a good way. Dilemma came toooo late, and neither Dilemma nor this song are great enough songs to follow up Dumhdurum.  A real shame that this was how A-Pink ended...just 2 real songs released in 3 years. Their label did them and us fans dirty.
At first I thought the title is dungeons and dragons 😅
Dungeons n dragons
Dengerin dnd apink sebagai selingan jeda pas streaming mv btob wind & wish
Nothing brings me more strenght and motivation than these girls, it brings me into tears to see how much of help they are everytime I feel alone, anxious and worried about life and it looks like each an every single one of their songs have the exact words to make me feel better in the hard moments. My precious Apink, I treasure you with my whole heart and maybe not from the beggining but I'll be by your side until the end. ❤🐼
I still hate the fact that YouTube got rid of commenting on a YouTube video because it's on YouTube Kids and it's 'made for kids'; and I also hate the not being able to get all notifications because it's 'made for kids', and also, not being to add to 'Watch later'.
I'll still love apink forever❤

wow long time no see Apink MV
Welcome to the Once who asked 'which is which'. A good way to have repeated chances to see who is who is to search YT thus: 'apink dumhdurum m/v with members names'. Naeun left last year to further her acting career but the other members have just committed to contracts. DND is short for Do Not Disturb and Naeun is not in this vid.
디엔디 나우~
Walaupun bukan zaman mereka lagi tapi asal mereka udh buat comeback udh syukur. Tetap semangat.
Why they did not win in music show?
Next~ Go! Go! 18M👋👋👋👋👋

Love this song , alwys supporting Apink 💗
Where is Naeun , it she out of Apink 🥺
Well done to the members and both agencies for working something out contractually. Too many Gen 1 and Gen 2 greats have disappeared from the limelight. Soon the attrition will even accelerate with Gen 3 groups. These ladies from Gen 2.5 are from a tradition of performers willing & able to sing live and do so well. Long may Apink be active.
"Do Not Disturb" - Apink ♡
oh my i love their style
It needs more than 3 weeks, and one big news for me, then It makes me keep coming everyday WHAT A (:

All 4 of them did not renew the contract.Only eunji renew it,but they did not disband.They will active as group in the future,only the contract with the company expired

4 members have contracted with a new company and Eunji decided to continue with IST. Therefore Apink will still exist with PANDA. Please don't worry and panicked

After you guys left IST enterainment, we will always support Apink forever🥲😭13 years panda🐼
After hearing the news, this song hits differently now.. 🥲
4 members of Apink except for Eunji will quit IST entertainment. It never means they disband.They said they are always Apink in future.

Apink is like my oxygen in K-pop... I wish they NVR stop making music
김남주 미쳤나봐 진짜 몇달동안 이거만 듣겠다
احسن اغنية ممكن تسمعها في هذا الوقت ، الكيبوب صاير ممل بسبب الاغاني الصاخبة و المزعجة ، اشتقت للاصوات الناعمة و الموسيقى الهادئة ✨❤️ ايبينك مبدعات كالعاده 🤩
Nice
Wow, this is great. Feels refreshing with no rap parts, just vocals and their voices are great too. Man, I wished more songs are like this one. Especially with lot of veteran groups that (usually) having good vocalists. If the rap parts just mehhh, then don't do it (pls take the hint, RV managers and producers)  Definitely will add this to my playlist
What DND stands for?
love apink forever❤
Everybody here need to hear Apink's bside "witcha" too, Its such a good song
DND such a heartwarming and beautiful song. ♥️🐼
MY APINK DESERVES THE WORLD! PANDAS WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT YOU NO MATTER WHAT!!!
PLEASE GET 100K LIKES ALREADY!!!! THEY DESERVES IT!!!
DND means Do Not Stop Dreaming. Song basically tells us to never stop dreaming even in your mid 20s and 30s you should keep striving 🙌
=) Pandas
Dont stop streaming #DND 😊
I can't understand a word but from the MV I can say that it is 'meaningful'
No resucitation?
Who think this is better than jisoo's flower
This time  Naeum is not part of the come back
Apink is a group whose concept has matured slightly and naturally. Their songs bring a very good vibe, reminiscent of some old kpop songs but a little more calm and refreshing. I am very happy to see that they are still active and that they do it bringing a lot of joy, they have a lot of talent and effort.
❤
Just wooooooow 😭😭 My apinkuuuu 🥹😻 We’ve come along way 😭 Let’s stay together for a long time 😭

The song is good with great lyrics but it just not catchy enough dont have that sing along value like previous healing song. Too fast imo,  only the bridge part was memorable for me
Without the designed center, the other five look more outstanding than before

Love my besties🩷
morning
I've become inactive in the kpop world because of life. I was so active back in highschool but when I entered college, everything that I love suddenly just disappeared, like I don't have any passion for it anymore. Back in highschool, whenever I feel down or reviewing, I always listen to Apink. The wave was always my favorite to listen to when I feel down. And now that I'm in college and slowly transitioning to an adult, it's hard. Everything is just overwhelming. And today is my last day of exam for Midterms, I opened YouTube to search for something, then I saw Apink in the recommended section. I played it, took me back, and started crying. This song was exactly what I needed. It felt like I never left because they have always been with me the whole time. Thank you, Apink, for always healing my heart with your songs.
Healing song again🎉 Thank you Apink❤🐼 DND now, never waste your time~✨
GO Apink love this 🐼🐼🐼🐼💖💗💞💕💓
Holi Dalia
Forda gooooo
I'm an Alice but I am here to stream this song because 1. It's really good song, lyrics, their voices, concept and everything 2. They're VICTON's senior, I remember those days when Apink supported them especially during their debut days. Eunji is always there to hype them.   p.s. How I miss Plan A Family
SAY COMMSSSSS
❤ HI GUYS My Friends make a cover dance of LUV for this special month  Hope You enjoy it 😊 https://youtu.be/ZFsea4JHPLk  Happy 12 aniversari to Apink I was Panda in the high school too TuT
2:25 "FIND YOUR WAY" I noticed that they used 3 primary colors on candles (red, blue and yellow). Red and Yellow candle has already lit up and they lit up  together the blue candle. Blue color means Loyalty. It means Apink Forever!
DND dance practice?
go apink!!! best girl group!!! l really love this song!!
１位になるにはラップだらけの曲がいいのでしょうか。　アメリカでも１位になったヒップホップはすぐに忘れられて消えている。　歴史に残る名曲はどれも美しいメロディーを持っている。　ＬＵＶの１７冠がいまだに超えられていないのがその証明です。
Keep streaming #DND
❤❤❤
This simple thing that many bands can't do. knowing the right note and sing it with the right person and never over do it. just keep it simple
عرفت spink واني عمري 11 سنة واني هسة عمري 20 سنة ولحد الان احبهن

Apink(^_-)-☆ Eunjiiii(´▽`)ノ
this is such a beautiful comeback!!! thank you apink !!
나은씨도 나가고… 설마 이게 디.엔.드 마지막 컴백은… 아니겠죠…? 그냥 DND “do not disturb” 방해금지… 인거겠지…?
I’m so happy & amazed that somehow Namjoo looks like her former self prior to the Im so sick comeback, Namjoo looks as pretty & cute as ever!
Apinkちゃんは、やっぱこうゆう明るい曲が似合うしかわいい🩷🩷また日本来てね🎀♩
HOLY...... AMAZINGGGGGG
A - R - T - E.  Está canción va directo a mi Top de 2023.    👌🏻🫂
Everybody Ready .... Remember FIVE LUV
It's crazy how they still could pull off as a newly debuted group, they are always so fresh looking 🥺💕 great song! And for some reason I thought I was gonna tear up seeing the cheerleader outfit, reminds me of their old days ❤ it's so hard to find a group who still releases music like them from the old kpop days 🥹❤️ thank you so much!
Miss you 😢❤

I can't emphasise how much I love and needed this song right now. I feel like it was calling out to me. Especially the line ''Don’t disregard the dream you’ve put off''.  I've always struggled in my life to decide what I would like to do for myself, and even more when facing what I would like to study or work for my future. Since I was a child I really liked drawing and painting, but I would always set it aside telling myself that I should be realistic and find something that is stable, and adding to that I had the pressure from my family to make it worse. Also the fact that I know a lot of friends and people younger my age were in college and being so sure in their decisions made me feel like I was stray from reality. I was about to start college in a career that would make everyone but me happy, just to not feel I was lost.  Hearing this song just made my heart feel warm and understood. That ''It’s okay to say that you’re lost'', that everyone has their time in finding themselves. Now I'm feeling confident and want to pursue my dreams more than ever, I want to keep drawing and getting better at it, to do the things that really make me happy and enjoy what life has to offer.  From the bottom of my heart: Thank you, Apink, for this gift. You've helped me to accept myself for who I am and who I wanna be. I only hope the best to you in your careers and dreams, and also to the people who stopped by to read about my litte story. Much Love 💕
Cute melody and love the lyrics. Pink Panda  always 🩷
The harmonization at the end ✨

What's DND means?

glad d&d is so poular now
Se luon danh su yeu thuong apink chi apink thoi da chiem.tron con tim em roi vi apink la cuoc song cua em duoc nghe apink hat moi ngay lam em vui lam
I think it was about 4 days ago I noticed this, marked as NEW, on kworb. Off to YT I went but at first I couldn't find this MV by searching with 'apink dnd'. I wonder if other casual international Apink fans went up the same cul de sac but being busier than me simply gave up looking. Anyway, K-pop should hang on to this treasure so I hope they get adequate support for many a year.
Amazing song
🥺💖
what does dnd mean?
Consistently putting out great songs for many many moons. Brava.
Apink =)
Why YouTube always did this to Apink when they nearly reach 20m in a few days😊 pls don't do dirty like this..like no one is stre4ming here
ahhh so good!
خیلی اهنگتون قشنگه🥺🥺🇮🇷🇮🇷
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, so if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the kingdom of heaven and eternal life. To this, people would accept Jesus Christ in life in their hearts and told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and frees and gives eternal life for free 114
Hail Mary
You had such good songs, but I just can't listen to this one. It's horrible. It's just musically annoying. And the lyrics are too banal and simple.
Thank you for coming back, and for coming back with this kind of song, at the very time I'm in need to hear these words. Thank you
When Apink Will helated conser in Indonesia 😢😢
What happened where are REAL mothers

This song is a joy
Congratulations on your comeback, it brings a great message.❤🎉
VAMOS BATER 17 M  ❤
Miss u guys sm ❤❤❤
I think all of Apink's songs are wonderful...but I feel like PlayM lack of promoting them....also they only focus promoting Apink in South Korea only, in fact Apink used to have alot of international fans...even now they are still even though it is not as much as it used to. But the way PlayM always use hangul caption only in every posts relate to Apink is just annoying...I know we can translate it automatically but it will be better if they're trying their best to communicate with international fans also....and if Apink didn't make a comeback they are rarely post on their Youtube channel and their Tiktok account which is imo its really important to gain or just keep their popularity internationally...bcs Apink deserve better and I still remember how they weren't make any comeback for almost 2 years when they were on the top of their popularity bcs of their agency
Just turn on your "DND = Do Not Disurb" nice song o.o catchy too
the only one girl group who always exist since debuted in 2nd generation till 4th generation.. it from 2010 till 2023 and still counting, isn't it?
Apink❤❤
OMG...it's a bop! Bravo....Congrats TEAM...the best comeback for Apink! fighting...! YouTube girl...Muckbang???
love the lyrics 💞
So good is have
love the song!! but does anybody know what DND means?
Do Not Disturb
Does the view froze? :((
Best Group Ever 💘
A I PINK
PERFEITAS!!!!
OMG the lyrics tho 😢😢😢 Forever Panda ❤🐼
This song is waaayyy better than the last one. Go apink gooo!!!

This is the first time that they only 5 members because Naeun left the group. Super miss them thank you for the comeback
What happened....the views not increase 😢😢😢
Does anyone understand how the algo works? Because from what I see there is still ads, and a few hours ago I checked the number of views is actually the same number as it is right now....
They already finished promote this song and I'm still hoping they can do dnd challenge with svt later huhuhu 😭
We need our girls comeback more with new hit songs. Always support them.
Good Luck Sisters

I love how bright the song is!! Also they look more gorgoeus than ever ❤

La mejor canción del año
Mis amores
Let's go Pandas! 20M is close!
Apink is my first fav girlgroup and also will be my last....bcs I don't really stan other girlgroups for almost 11 years...idk why I just like their songs but not really into them...but for Apink I always support them...even waiting them to make comeback once a year feels like forever for me, and also with only one week promotion it will pass by so quickly...I hope they can make comeback atleast twice this year....so I don't feel empty and its kinda frustrating to wait for their cb bcs I only stan Apink 😭
기다렸따구~~~~🎉😊
Love you apink❤

為正身處各種煩惱或病苦、障礙特別多，或自覺會短壽的有緣人（請加油！），介紹一部專為此類問題而設的佛經——「聖無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經」。此經文雖少但福德神力廣大，若能讀誦、書寫、印經或轉發經文，讓更多人接觸到，即能得到消災、延壽、治病、滅罪、增福等等無量福德，轉業改命，復得健康長壽的快樂人生。即使你自覺無病無苦，它還是可以增加你無量福報，因為多念誦也能在冥冥中使此經典為更多此世界的人所接觸到，由此增加了他們的健康壽命等，從而使你累積極大的善業福德，人生各方面都能再更進一步。你亦可為有需要的親友念誦迴向亦能有效。所以奉勸各位多讀誦、轉發，累積無量改命功德。（經文在下面）順便為有興趣的人再推介幾部具有類似功效的殊勝經咒：「長壽滅罪經、準提咒、大日如來光明真言、百字明（都可在YT搜到）」都對消罪增福、治病延壽有極大功效。   大乘聖無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經. 西天中印度摩伽陀國那爛陀寺傳教大師三藏賜紫沙門臣法天奉　詔譯  *（）內為註音   如是我聞。一時世尊。在舍衛國祇（其）樹給孤獨園。與大苾（必）芻（廚）眾千二百五十人俱。皆是漏盡意解無復煩惱。逮得己利心善解脫。眾所知識大阿羅漢。復有智慧廣大功德。莊嚴威儀具足諸尊。菩薩摩訶薩等。為聞法故皆悉來集。於眾會中有大慧妙吉祥菩薩摩訶薩而為上首。爾時釋迦牟尼佛。愍念未來世中一切短命眾生。令增壽命得大利益。為說不可思議祕密甚深微妙勝法。  是時。世尊告大慧妙吉祥菩薩言。汝等諦聽。從是南閻浮提。西方過無量佛土。有世界名無量功德藏。國土嚴麗眾寶間飾。清淨殊勝安隱快樂。超過十方微妙第一。於彼無量功德藏世界之中。有佛名無量壽決定光明王如來無上正等菩提。今現住彼世界之中。起大慈悲為諸眾生演說妙法。令獲殊勝利益安樂。   佛復告妙吉祥菩薩言。今此閻浮提世界中人壽命百歲。於中多有造諸惡業而復中夭。妙吉祥菩薩若有眾生。得見此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。功德殊勝及聞名號。若自書寫若教他人書是經竟。或於自舍宅或於高樓。或安精舍殿堂之中。受持讀誦遵奉禮拜。種種妙華燒香粖香。塗香華鬘（曼）等。供養無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。如是短壽之人。若能志心書寫受持。讀誦供養禮拜。如是之人復增壽命滿於百歲。   復次妙吉祥菩薩。若有眾生聞是無量壽決定光明王如來名號。若能志心稱念一百八遍。如此短命眾生復增壽命。或但聞其名號。志心信受遵崇之者。是人亦得增益壽命。   復次妙吉祥菩薩。若有恒時心無暫捨。志誠思求妙法。善男子善女人等汝應諦聽。我今為說無量壽決定光明王如來一百八名陀羅尼曰。  *國語註音： 翁。拿摩巴葛瓦帝。阿巴啦密答。阿优哩阿纳。 苏必你。实执答。碟左啦渣也。單塔哥达也。 阿啦诃帝。三药三不达也。單你也塔。 翁。萨哩巴。桑斯葛哩。叭哩述答。 达啦马帝。哥哥拿。桑马烏哥帝。 莎巴瓦。比述帝。马喝拿也。叭哩瓦哩 娑喝。   妙吉祥菩薩。此無量壽決定光明王如來一百八名陀羅尼。若有人躬自書寫。或教他人書是陀羅尼。安置高樓之上。或殿堂內清淨之處。如法嚴飾種種供養。短命之人復得長壽滿足百歲。如是之人於後此處命終。便得往生於彼無量壽決定光明王如來佛剎無量功德藏世界之中。  當釋迦牟尼佛。說此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經時。有九十九俱胝（之）佛。一心異口同音。亦說此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。是時復有八十四俱胝佛。一心異口同音。亦說此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。是時復有七十七俱胝佛。一心異口同音。亦說此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。是時復有六十六俱胝佛。一心異口同音。亦說此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。  是時復有五十五俱胝佛。一心異口同音。亦說此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。是時復有四十四俱胝佛。一心異口同音。亦說此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。是時復有三十六俱胝佛。一心異口同音。亦說此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。是時復有二十五俱胝佛。一心異口同音。亦說此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。是時復有十殑伽河沙數俱胝佛。各各心無差別異口同音。亦皆說此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。  此陀羅尼經。若復有人若自書若教人書。如是之人於後。不墮地獄不墮餓鬼不墮畜生。不墮閻羅王界業道冥官。永不於是諸惡道中受其惡報。如是之人由是書寫此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經功德力故。於後一切生處。生生世世得宿命智。此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。若自書若教人書。如是之人則同書寫八萬四千法藏。所獲功德而無有異。此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。若復有人若自書若教人書。如是之人便同修建八萬四千寶塔。所獲功德而無有異。此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。若自書若教人書。如是之人若有五無間地獄之業。由是功德力故。其業皆悉消除。  此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。若自書若教人書。如是之人不墮魔王及魔眷屬。不墮藥叉羅剎道中。不墮非橫死亡。永不受是諸惡果報。此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。若自書若教人書。如是之人臨命終時。有九十九俱胝佛。面現其前來迎是人。往生於彼佛國土中。汝等勿生疑惑。此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。若自書若教人書。如是之人當來永不受其女人之身。  此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。若自書若教人書。如是之人常得東方彥達嚩（博）主持國天王。南方矩伴拏（拿）主增長天王。西方大龍主廣目天王。北方大藥叉主多聞天王。密隱其身隨逐衛護。若復有人為於此經。能以少分財寶布施之者。是人便同以三千大千世界滿中。金銀琉璃硨（車）磲（渠）瑪瑙珊瑚琥珀。如是七寶盡持布施。若復有人供養此經典者。便同供養一切真實法藏。若復有人能持上妙七寶。供養毘（皮）婆尸。試棄。毘舍浮。俱留孫。揭諾揭牟尼。迦設波。釋迦牟尼如來應正等覺。所獲福德不能度量知其數量。若復有人供養此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。所獲福德亦復不能度量知其限量。又如四大海水充滿其中。不能得知一一滴數。若復有人書寫供養。受持讀誦此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。所獲福德亦復不能度量知其限數。  若復有人書寫是無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。處所地位則是成就諸佛真身舍利寶塔。應尊重禮拜。若有眾生耳聞此陀羅尼者。此之眾生永不受飛鳥四足多足異類之身。當來速得成就不退轉無上正等菩提。若復有人。積聚金銀琉璃硨磲瑪瑙珊瑚琥珀。如是七寶如妙高山王盡能捨施。所獲福德不可度量知其數量。若復有人為此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。而能布施之者。所得福德亦復不能度量知其限數。若復有人書寫此無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼經。禮拜供養者。如是之人則為禮拜供養十方諸佛剎土一切如來。而無有異。   爾時釋迦牟尼世尊。說彼伽（加）他曰。  　修行布施力成就　　布施力故得成佛 　若入大悲精室中　　耳暫聞此陀羅尼 　設使布施未圓滿　　是人速證天人師 　修行持戒力成就　　持戒力故得成佛 　若入大悲精室中　　耳暫聞此陀羅尼 　設使持戒未圓滿　　是人速證天人師 　修行忍辱力成就　　忍辱力故得成佛 　若入大悲精室中　　耳暫聞此陀羅尼 　設使忍辱未圓滿　　是人速證天人師 　修行精進力成就　　精進力故得成佛 　若入大悲精室中　　耳暫聞此陀羅尼 　設使精進未圓滿　　是人速證天人師 　修行禪定力成就　　禪定力故得成佛 　若入大悲精室中　　耳暫聞此陀羅尼 　設使禪定未圓滿　　是人速證天人師 　修行智慧力成就　　智慧力故得成佛 　若入大悲精室中　　耳暫聞此陀羅尼 　設使智慧未圓滿　　是人速證天人師  佛說是經已。諸大苾芻眾及諸菩薩。一切世間天人阿素囉彥闥（踏）嚩等。聞佛所說皆大歡喜信受奉行。

When I was 7, My My was released and my mom, my sister and me started to call ourselves pink panda since then. During elementary school, I used to dance to Mr. Chu and Luv with friends. Now I'm 20, I didn't talk to them anymore but Apink is still releasing new songs till this day. Long live Apink 🐼💓

Buti pa Apink nag comeback na. Ka miss lang 😭
Apink hwaiting!!
how is namjoo looks like namjoo again?
niceee, feel like IU song tho
У меня подозрение, что они использовали разные эры из прошлых камбэков:  Чорон - Mister Chu, Боми - Eung Eung, Ынджи - My My, Намджу - I'm so sick, Хаен - Five Может я ошибаюсь, но их образы наталкивают на такую мысль
Apink forever
Apink is the best girl group ever!!!!❤❤
I will always be grateful to Apink for bringing me into Kpop. I will always love and appreciate you girls. <3
Hard to figure out which age group they’re targeting for, I really wish Apink can stand out in their own age❤
😍😍😍

I'm so happy to see Apink is still active. This definitely brings the old k-pop feel and it's exactly what I was missing. It's a new song but I feel nostalgic. Thank you Apink for still being there ❤
Apink comes back better and better
❤❤Let's fight to reach 20 million
역시 에이핑크네
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I love when the one candle blows out and then all three are relit... to me that means taking care of yourself/recharging so that you have energy again. I think it can also represent having a good support system because they are all together when it gets lit again (& in the end they are all smiling at each other)
I love APink <3
I LOVEE
LAS AMO
It's been a while! What a banger comeback. This is definitely the type of MV you'd have on repeat all day long!
Apink
Sooo After sad series and stories from ISS %% to Dumhdurum and came into such Dilemma, Finally They say BETTER BETTER BETTER MOVE FIND YOUR WAY~
I feel like this song is about living in the moment, and remembering that happiness is in the simple things like dancing in the rain, getting enough sleep, taking breaks, and going out to have fun!
They always slay
We'll be on waiting "WITCHA"...a special performance...
Does anyone know what Bomi's outfit is supposed to represent?
한국도 장수그룹들이 더 많이 나와야된다 아직도 어리기 때문에

DND cheers us up!!! Apink always give us much happiness!!! Let's enjoy this happy song again and again!!!
I just added on my list when I travel it feels like summer vibes. Thank you Apink for bringing back my Kpop fandom. I love you so much. You're the one girl group i like and idolize the most. Keep fighting and more years together with you..  love youuuuuuuuuuuu ❤️
necesitaba escuchar esto :,))
I think the triangle, round & rectangle shapes candle are definitions of their companies name changes. Plan A > Play M > IST 😅 Meaning APINK lights up their companies. Lastly, they agree to each other to stay together. ❤
GO 15M!!!

I AM SO LATE TO THIS! Did not know that Apink dropped a new mini!!!! I love the lyrics in this song, VERY relatable (and words I need to hear). Love this girl group and all their members, will always expect a a great song from them!
Views are not real or have been bought. This is shown by the number of likes.... This is sad. People never supported this comeback as it should.
보미 외모 무엇...???
확실한건 요즘 애들꺼 듣다보니 노래자체가 올드해보이긴하네
I can't stop listening to this songgggg ❤ I love you Apink❤

THE LOVES OF MY LIFE ARE BACK AT IT AGAIN WITH ANOTHER BOP!!!!!
I was 14 years old when I started stanning APINK <3 now I'm 23 years old and they're my one and only group that I really love from the bottom of my heart!! APINK FOREVER!!
they’re on their 12th year already, some people will think that winning is still their priority, but no. Groups disbanding, what a committment to stay! Apink has their own charisma now. They are one of the groups tat others look up to. Not because of wins, but because of longevity.
하영 음색 너무 좋다
this is what i need right now.... in the past weeks i think i lost myself from the things that made me overwhelmed and also with the same routine of life to the point that i don't have the will to finish the tasks i need to do.... but i think its better to move and trust myself for who i am and what can i do! thank you for this comeback and long live apink!! 💕

THE LYRICS IS REALLY COMFORTING
D N D now  Never waste your life  D N D now   我唔記得係幾時望住天空嘅 하늘을 바라본 게 글쎄 언제였더라  我都唔記得啦，日日都係辛苦嘅一天 생각도 안 나잖아 고단한 Daylife  有時會對住鏡子嘅自己對視 가끔은 Eye to Eye on 거울에 눈을 맞춰  話比你聽，我會搖頭微笑 입꼬릴 Up 더 보여 줄래 Smiley face    喺你細小嘅房間角落 자그만 네 Room 한구석에서  唔洗自己咁憂慮啦 긴 한숨을 Hoo 혼자 걱정하진 않길    在遺忘中度過的調色板中 잊은 채로 살았던 palette 속에  選擇吧 你的顏色 골라봐 봐 너의 색  你即將會遇見自己的可能性 만나게 될 거야 네 가능성  現在 一個一個地畫你的 frame Now 하나하나 Paint your frame    Just D N D now  無人可以攔住你 누구도 막을 수 없어  繼續前行 계속 걸어  憑你嘅方法，尋找你嘅方向 네 방식대로 Find your way    Just D N D now  時時刻刻活得像22歲咁 언제나 live it like you're twenty two   Better better better move  相信你自己，做自己 너를 있는 모습 그대로 믿어봐  與其做你應該做嘅事 해야 하는 것보단 하고 싶은 걸로  何不勇敢追求自己想做嘅事 과감하게 Take that 그래도 돼  幸福，其實好簡單 Oh 행복이라는 건 생각 외로 단순해  就喺那個地方，尋找失落嘅天堂 머나먼 저편에 찾아 헤맨 Heaven  其實，你就喺此處 사실 여기 있는 걸    你心靈嘅小房間 네 마음의 Room 한구석으로  唔好忽略咗夢想 미뤄왔던 꿈 더 외면하지는 않길    即使冇任何計劃 때론 아무 대책 없이  即使對明天感到樂觀唔起 내일을 낙관해도 괜찮아  你心中所有灰塵 네 마음속에 가득 쌓인 Dust  都應該清掃乾淨 전부 다 털어봐    Just D N D now  無人可以攔住你 누구도 막을 수 없어  繼續前行 계속 걸어  憑你嘅方法，尋找你嘅方向 네 방식대로 Find your way    Just D N D now  時時刻刻活得像22歲咁 언제나 live it like you're twenty two  Better better better move  相信你自己，做自己 너를 있는 모습 그대로 믿어봐    當生命中出現不安感 사는 게 문득 불안할 땐  請記得，我一直在你身邊 네 곁에 있는 나를 기억해  朝著未來前進，唔好回頭 앞을 향해서 Don't ever looking back  你會比雨後的花更加堅強 비가 온 뒤 더 단단해질 너를 알잖아    我會一直陪伴你 늘 함께 할 거야  為你在成長過程中 어른이 돼 가는 너의 과정에  提供幫助，即使你感到失落 헤맨다고 해도 괜찮으니까  尋找你嘅方向 Find your way    D N D now，躋身於光明之路 D N D now 희망이 비치는 Road  走過走過，讓明日更加耀眼 걷고 걸어 더 눈부시게 빛날 Days    Just D N D now  全世界都會充滿你 온 세상 가득해질 너만의  你嘅色彩，色彩，色彩 ooh Color color color ooh  喜歡你現在的樣子，活出自己 좋아 지금 모습 그대로 live your life    Just D N D now  冇人可以攔住你 누구도 막을 수 없어  咩都唔阻止你 계속 걸어  繼續行你嘅路 用你嘅方式搵到方向 네 방식대로 Find your way   Just D N D now  填滿你嘅二十四小時 널 가득하게 채워 24  Better better better move  好啦，以現在嘅模樣活出你嘅人生 좋아 지금 모습 그대로 live your life   You better better better move  信任自己留低嘅模樣 너를 있는 모습 그대로 믿어봐

Uri bubble and bright Apink is back.  Love this song 🐼💗 Apink Queens are back 💖👑😊  #Apink #DND
i think apink's time is almost over, they don't attract new fans anymore, just loyal fans. they're getting older for a girlband kpop, and their last 2 album just so so, not good and not bad either. just my opinion, don't @ me lol.
Apink❤

I love how Apink reflects on their feelings and incorporates their learnings through their music. It's like a friend guiding you to become better and enjoy life while also prioritizing yourself.  Stream #DND!!
Woaahhh apink is trending #17 ❤️🐼🥹🥹
멋진 컴백입니다. Apink는 내가 가장 좋아하는 소녀 그룹 중 하나이며, 의심 할 여지없이 항상 매우 긍정적 인 메시지를 전달하고, 노래의 가사는 너무 아름답고 긍정적이며, 분위기, 색상, 목소리, 풍경, 앨범 모든 것이 너무 아름답습니다. 팬더는 에이핑크에게 많은 응원과 사랑을 아끼지 않을 것입니다. 에이핑크의 소녀들은 그들만이 할 수 있는 것처럼 빛나고 있습니다.
The song is so bright but i bawl my eyes out so much
Apink is always No.1 in my heart <3
What a beautiful inspiring song. Praying for you success. God bless you APink.
에이핑크 화이팅~

D&D players after hearing this information: 👁👄👁
As a fan who spent her teenage years with Apink, this song hits me right in the feels. Adulting is really hard but their songs cheered me up and gave me strength to keep on going. Can’t help but to feel emotional with the lyrics because they’ve been literally on my side for 12 years now.
GO 5M!!!
Yo

As a nerd, just had to check if this involved Dungeons and Dragon in any way haha. Could never imagine Kpop and DnD crossing over.  Also this is a refreshing sound. Always happy to see groups from my generation make comebacks. Feelin old with all these new groups and 2000 babies haha.

THEY ATEEE 😍😍😍
My Favorite Lyrics to this song  “when you’re anxious about life, remember me who’s next to you, towards the front, don’t ever look back after it rains, you know you’ll be stronger  in the process of becoming adult, it’s okay to say that you’re lost find your way.”  I felt that because adulthood is real this song is masterpiece I cry that part
普通に良曲すぎて涙止まらん！！🥹
guys their contract will end at the end of this month and tbh nobody knows if they’re gonna renew or not, if they won’t that’s understandable , but as for now please let’s do our best with streaming in YT and kcharts and voting for the music shows it might be our last time together that’s sad but we need to wake up and see the reality....
Healing idol❤
Wow the queens are back❤❤❤. Looking absolutely stunning and the MV is 🔥🔥🔥🔥. Sarangey  Apink❤❤❤
Apink never disappoints us❤ let's be together forever apink!!

favorite part @ 1:54  “when you’re anxious about life, remember me who’s next to you, towards the front, don’t ever look back after it rains, you know you’ll be stronger  in the process of becoming adult, it’s okay to say that you’re lost find your way.”  THE LYRICS ARE SO MEANINGFUL
Y a todo esto que significa DND? Me encanto la canción pero me quede con la duda 😂
Queeens are back!!!!
I've been a Panda since My My era and all of their songs keep getting better and better!   I will always support Apink forever and I hope that you win many awards on your latest comeback!

제가 판다는 아니지만 에이핑크를 보면 항상 대단하고 부럽다는 생각을 하게 되네요 이렇게 오래 활동을 하면서도 꾸준히 좋은 모습과 곡들을 보여줄 수 있다니 팬들이 정말 행복할 것 같습니다 8년차 부터의 활동은 정말 팬들에겐 기적과도 같은 시간들이라 활동들 하나하나가 정말 소중한데 그 소중한 시간들을 누릴 수 있는 팬덤이라니 정말 몇 안 되는 행복한 팬덤이네요 이번 활동도 부상없이 행복한 활동이 되시길 바랍니다
First comeback without   Naeun Naeun you be always in my heart

this song goes back to its roots. The prechoruses are so magical like their songs from their earlier days but it's also mature
이 노래 지짜 좋아
🎉好聽
When you asked me what group has done their concept change successfully. Apink is my immediate answer. Their music has matured at a natural pace as they've matured themselves. No sudden whiplash concept changes. They've done it in a way that just feels right. I love this song so much 💙
Let's support APINK forever!! 🙏🙏

Y quién pensará 12 años de carrera y siguen sacando canciones frescas y geniales, realmente Apink nunca decepcionada
노노노 때 처럼 희망을 주는 메시지 담은 곡 너무 좋아요 ❤
I LOVE IT!! Love the lyrics! I got into them when I was 17, I’m 27 now T.T and I like how the lyrics are for those of us that have grown with them, how life changes and becomes stressful, how it’s about work and we forget to live a little, it’s a song to remind us to be happy and find happiness in the smallest things! I hope they have a tour I saw them in Dallas in 2015~   Thank you rong mama for keeping our girls together!! <3
Eunjii ❤️❤️❤️
Huaaa!!!
What a cute song. It's not about love and being on top in every chart, but it's a life lesson.   The music itself is not my taste, but the song as a whole is really fantastic. Great job!
I am forever PANDA. LOUD and PROUD. I love you forever 😍😍
The lyrics are so emotional! I’m about to cry. Thank you girls. This is a masterpiece

What does "D N D"  refer to?     Dungeons and Dragons is the only thing that comes to mind.  And it still fits the lyrics somehow.

D N D now ! 💖💖💖💖💖

^^
Chorong with a unhappy face in front of cam, now being so smiley.  Bomi who is afraid of rain, is now ready to be wet.  Eunji who looks overworked, now finds happiness with her work.  Namjoo who can't draw anything, is now able to create a masterpiece.  Hayoung who looks exhausted, is now able to find joy in her job.  Apink told Panda just turn on mode DND now.

#DND linda canción Saludos desde Ecuador #Apink #Eunji
¿Dónde están los fans latinos que AMAMOS  a Apink? a reportarse yaaaaaa
LITERALLY MOTHERRRR ❤❤❤ STREAM D N D ❤❤❤❤❤
Apink always delivers <3 the power vocals! and the lyrics and message are so lovely (even if I had to look up what D N D stood for because all I could think of was D&D...but if they were singing about bringing joy into your live via tabletop gaming that'd be cool too lol)
Beautiful song as usual. I love it <3
오늘 하필 기분 안좋았는데 컴백 뮤비 보고 싹 풀림!전체적으로 뮤비 느낌이 심플하고 개개인마다 서로 다른 테마인듯한 상큼하게 통통튀는 매력과 색깔로 또 베일을 벗으니 에이핑크랑 넘 잘 어울리고 본모습으로 보이고 가사땜에 진짜 눈물나네 열응할테니 앨범 대박나자❤❤
This song is wonderful and quite upbeat and happy and i like it.   though what do they mean by DND?
This song makes me so emotional 😭  Idk why :))

Grup fav gw pertama kenal korea
♡
This one is going to take me a lot of listens to like. I rarely have been this excited for a comeback. Apink are my favorite active girlgroup I love them so much and going to have my eyes on them no matter what. But this song, it left zero impact, it feels right now like I just listened to a b-side that I would in usual forget about. Since it's their title track I'm going to listen to it and try to like it. But I don't understand why they chose a song like that, it doesn't even make their vocals shine or make them stand out. If they're happy I'm happy but that is just miles away from satisfying my need for a new Apink song of the year.
1M naaaaaa!!
Apink will always be my fav kpop group  ever ❤🐼❤
❤️❤️❤️
ขอให้ต้าวความสดใสของฉัน มีความสุขในทุกๆการเติบโตน๊าาาาา ^^

Hm.. i'm not sure if this meets the expectations of such an awaited comeback. The song feels a bit plain and more b-sideish than their other title tracks :( Hopefully they will still do well

Welcome back my queens❤
The message of this song hits me so hard, as a millenial who is sometimes lost with myself, finding my way to my purpose, and the rat race of this world, anxious about life as I move forward, everyday is a battle. Thank you Apink for this. ❤😢😊
Missed you Apink ❤❤
노래 좋으니깐 잘됐으면 좋겠다 에이핑크 언제나 고맙고 화이팅!!
as expected from the Queens...The song is amazing...Thank you for coming back😘
Apink still young and beautiful😍😍
Great concept
APINK HWAITING~!💕
I love this song a lot. So catchy❤
I love you girls and I’m always here for you!!
One member missing?
Gass......
Waaaaaaa😍😍i love it
Cute
노래가 너무 상쾌해요!! 나는 컨셉, 가사, 음악, 안무, 분위기, 모든 것을 좋아해!! 우리는 딜레마를 겪고 나서 마침내 우리의 진정한 모습을 발견했다. 우리에게 필요한 것은 긍정적이고 경쾌한 노래로 우리 자신을 위로하는 것이다. 언니들의 노고에 고마워요! 🫶🏻🐼 또한, 에이핑크의 컴백을 축하합니다!!🥳 DND 파이팅💞
So good. What does DND stand for?
No matter if people said "Apink isn't popular anymore after Naeun left the group", but the real Pandadeul will support the queen forever. Please spread ur love for them guys <3

The lyrics are very encouraging in our process of becoming an adult .   Our beloved Apink, who are in the same age group as we are,  face the same life issue. Our Apink becomes our life partner for supporting us to walk our own path. To the world,  please DND , we 🐼and Apink , to optimistically walk our own path and pursuit our dreams .   As an adult fan， Apink really touches my heart in my life path as an source of comfort and happiness . Thanks Apink ❤ . I will continue to be 🐼 forever until you retire . Thanks 🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶  Thanks Apink 💛💛💛 DND really touches my heart . We 🐼 will always by your side to have your life path DND, as you are also always by our side.

Hayoung maid cafe
Love the melody and lyrics!! Let's make it THE trend because everyone needs a song like this sometimes  Ps: Love the comfortable fashion too
Apink makes me feel we can be together forever, even longer then with my boyfriend😻
❤❤❤
the lyrics…
It’s giving 2012-2016 dance pop vibes and honestly I do not mind. Also the lyrics are so encouraging, as if Apink are telling us that despite all the stresses that the world brings to you —don’t take it too seriously—just DND 💙💙💙  Keep slaying my KPOP Queens
❤️
pinkpanda since 2013 here!!!! 🐼💕
很好聽欸
Apink as its finest, queens slay this era, it's really depict on our situation right now like many people want to give up on their life but here's Apink give us an inspirational vibe and give us a cheer up song. They remind us that God (It depends on what your religion is there's no an exemption) always with us and let's live in the way we want that no one will disturb us. Always trust in your self that you will overcome it one day, coz they said trust the progress of your life. This DND of Apink is absolutely a BOP. A truly masterpiece. I'm thankful that it relieve my stress this days. No one can change my mind.  #SELF #DND #APINK
Клип шикарный и божественный, хореография прекрасный и потрясающий, наряды шикарные и потрясающие, песня изящная и божественная, голос и вокал шикарный у всех девушек, мне очень понравилось это шедевр.
wheres naeun
Hari ini aku mengalami hari-hari dengan penuh beban. Beban kehidupan, percintaan, pekerjaan, dan beban yang tidak bisa percaya pada kemampuan diri sendiri. Aku berdoa kepada Tuhan agar diberikan kekuatan dalam menjalani hidup maupun pekerjaan dengan baik. Sampai akhirnya aku membuka YouTube dan melihat Apink comeback dengan judul DND. Awalnya aku kira lagu cinta, ternyata liriknya sangat menyentuh & mewakili apa yang aku rasakan saat ini. Terimakasih Apink sudah memberikan kekuatan lewat karyanya. Semoga sukses selalu untuk Apink & para membernya 🎉
omg
Namjoo <3
I love Apink!
wow, they look so young <3
I love this omg ❤
Apink congrats on the comeback! Let's get the 100M views!
Apink is a great storyteller. They show us deep and touching story of 5 different people in just 3 minutes.
A pink always are the best 🥹🫶❤️❤️
absolutely love the lyrics.  as idol groups get older, its really  great to see them move towards growing up / growing pains and life-themed songs ^^ really resonated with this, especially when everyone seems to feel they have an opinion in your own life but its your life, get your DO NOT DSTURB mode on and just do you!  congrats on the comeback Apink <3
내설수 융버메가 도라와따...ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ♡
Yoon Bomi so pretty 🤩 ❤
I thought this song wasn't good, but it turned out to be really good. Not too good, not too bad. But the music is easy to listen to, not difficult to listen to. In general, I agree. The music I listened to for the first time was pleasing to the ears, very catchy, easy to watch, I also like this MV. 100 score ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
슬퍼하지 말라고 혼자가 아니라고 얘기해주던 에이핑크가 이젠 해야하는 것보단 하고싶은 걸 하래ㅠㅠㅠ 나 울어ㅠㅠㅠ

They're my inspiration to be a better me and to remember that it's okay to live freely sometimes. And even though I'm still in my youth, they are a part of my youth. They gave me happiness and joy. They showed me that no matter how many times you encounter barriers, if you have faith in yourself and others, you can get back up. This is one of their other masterpieces, and I love it:> Happy comeback Apink!!🥳🤩 Thank you for everything!!
Wow... you're beautiful APINK

I miss Naeun they'll always be Ot6 in my heart ... But their comeback was so good!! I love the meaning of the song, it's about not looking back into the past and moving on to a new chapter into your life which as someone who's struggling with past traumas can really to and in end the finding the light to your road in the future, plus the visuals and vocals are insane ❤️❤️ also they aged like fine wine 😭 can't wait for their 12th Anniversary this month!! So proud of my girls!
APINK IS BACK!! I MISSED YOU 🥹🩷
很好听 谢谢Apink❤️❤️❤️
에이핑크 방식의 응원송이라니.... 너무 좋잖아 !!!! 2차 티저 보고 기대하긴 했는데 기대 이상이다 ㅜㅠ 멜로디 가사 안무 삼박이 딱 맞아지면서 무대도 기대되고,, 이렇게 에이핑크의 건재함을 보여주는구나 ㅜㅜㅜㅜ 이번 활동도 화이팅 !!!!!
As maiorais e perfeitas!!
진짜 10몇년전에 에이핑크에도 빠진적도 있었지만 갑자기 탈덕을해서 에이핑크 관심도가 떠나있었는데 작년 다시 재활동과 더불어 올해 4월경 컴백한다는 소식듣고 에이핑크도 다시 재입덕을 할수밖에없는이유 솔직히 이번4월 아이브 키치에 주목을 하고있었는데 이번엔 에이핑크 컴백도 상당히 주목이됨 에이핑크도 계속 오래도록 활동 부탁해
MY GIRLS DID REALLY A GOOD JOB OMG IN LOVE WITH THIS SONG
DND me from loving them!!
chao mung nhom nhe, comback thanh cong nha
너무 예쁘고 귀엽고 우리 에이핑크 여러분 사랑하고 앞으로도 영원히 사랑할 특히 은지야 제일 사랑해.

"Always be with you, in the process of becoming an adult" I'M GONNA CRY :'(  That is literally my life as a Pink Panda, was in middle school when they first debut and now I'm like past my 20's! I love all Apink and will support them forever. Favorite part of this MV: Chorong's outfit, Bomi's rain set, Namjoo's art set, Eunji in a suit (best decision), and Hayoung's insane side profile in that one scene!!!!
i'm always proud of you, apink! i won't get tired listening to all your songs and watching your videos!
진짜 사랑해❤ 오래가자 에이핑쿠
멜로디 듣자마자 소름이 돋는데 중독성이 강한 그런 멜로디에 너무 좋아요 재미있어요 그리고 계속 생각나고 매일같이 들을것 같아요❤❤❤ 언니들 이번노래도 짱!짱! 너무 좋아요

It’s a bright song but I feel like crying. There’s so many emotions inside me now. They have went through a lot in these 12 years. I’m so proud and happy for them. The lyrics is really good! I’m glad that they emphasise on the message a lot.

As a fresh young adult trying to find myself while also living up to the ridiculous expectations sociaty has set on myself and others...this song really spoke to me...😢❤ first Apink song I think I actually cried... Thank you for this empowering lyrics, I'm proud to call myself a panda 😊❤❤.
이게 몇년만에 힐링 컨셉일까,,, 많이 돌고 돌았지만 에이핑크는 청춘힐링할 때 그 누구보다도 극락 자체네 노래랑 잘어울린다 사랑해❤🤍

i don’t know how one song from apink saves a year but they always do
이전 곡도 좋았지만, 에이핑크의 청순하고 활기찬 색깔도 가끔 그리웠는데 이번 곡이 딱 그 색깔이면서도 성숙한 시원함이 한 스푼 추가된 거 같아요. 언니들, 좋은 노래 고마워요🐼💕

As time goes by, we lose ourselves more and more in the process of growing up. Listening to this song, reading the lyrics and feeling the happiness of each members voice, simply tells me to keep living like you're young and free. Set yourselves in your DO NOT DISTURB modes when you want to be alone and live life exactly as you want it.  Been with these girls since 2011 and have never been disappointed since ❤ thank you Apink for reminding me that there's so much to life other than work. Will continue to love you guys till the end
9살 때부터 에이핑크 팬이었고 이제 20살이다.  소중한 시간을 내어준 에이핑크 너무 고마워요 항상 소중히 간직할게요💗🥺🥺
