Incredible fuken shet man, incredible. God!
The voiceless is right over  It’s different love it 🤘🏼🤟🏼
this one goes hard
Needs more cowbell.
🖤🐈‍⬛🦇🎵⚫🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🔥🔥
Drop-Z tuning
god level music straight to your soul
The drums sound like 80s disco ;) What happened to the sound from 'Finale'?
I love how casually they all absolutely shred
❤
And Scotty is the best here.By the way.
If you kick out the vocalist, the style will go from being terrible to simply incomprehensible.
Tim stop being so good 😂
This drummer is crazy af
Ok playing same melody several times seems good, but there is no syphonic parts…
They are clearly very talented but I just don’t get it. It’s empty, almost soulless…
If fl studio was real
Lyrics:  "i cannot sing without autotune i cannot sing without autotune i cannot sing without autotune i cannot sing without autotune i cannot sing without autotune"
I hope the rapper paid them a lot of money to have a part in this video
good fits bros
My fave song.
The first second sound like the simpsons intro
The closing shreds at 3:30 just do something to me idk its just so good
The guitarist without the stupid nec k thing is actually the better player
kesini gara2 dengar podcast  bg tretan muslim😬
Imagine compose a masterpiece like that only for a lil something to autotune the shit out of it
That hypnotic riff from Scottie is something never heard before.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

The mumble dummy ruined it. Rest is so good
Bring West to Toronto with you
🔥😎🔥
What kind of Diabolical BS is this?  Too much Satan worship in these latest clips.  Too much androgyny.  UNSUBSCRIBED !!!
Awesome song until the dude starts talking with the bored robotic voice.
pls do this type of shit more 🙏🏼🙏🏼
Scott has his own nose mask... You f*cking bet he does.
Perfect.
the bass tone is so DEEP and PUNCHY
Needs more cow bell
Chimera ant
Sounds like gay mariachi music and i fucking love it.
8-string guitars? why the fuck not?
I cannot find a place for whatever genera this music is. There is nothing like it, but it's perfect.
beautiful 150 seconds!
Imagine having the skill to play music and you choose to play this instead.
Wasn't a fan of the rap
Scott was just 🗿🗿
banger song!! 🫂🥰
New to me! Loved it!!!😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩 GOOD DRUMMER!!!
Your music is very nice
Damn, that was a fire 2 and a half min intro to Lil West's drop
That was a beautiful stoneman
erm what the sigma!
Lil wesst is ruining everything
Loving this song lately
uhhhhhm...WOW🤙🏻
great until the generic travis scott comes in and just says bakalaka baboohoon
Essa música é de matar! ❤
This is the most genuine, authentic song I’ve ever heard. Dudes conviction is what really sells this
fans of Polyphia would love the band ANYONE..  Riz Story is the greatest musical genius on earth and plays all the instruments.
Fabulous thanks
I would call this track a conversation of geniuses without words through the melody of genius
For some reason the thought mixing 4 incredibly talented musicians with an auto-tune talking vocalist was a good idea 😅 This song is great until he starts his crap trap rap nonsense at the end
The music was perfect until he started singing, then it went perfect again when he closed his mouth
what a song, so happy I discovered this
This music is so slept on
If rap turned into this i would not be mad
i mean i get the instrumentals are great but this band really leaves a lot to be desired
You guys are all amazing players! Tim I want u! V**V
Wish it didn't have the "featuring". Bleh.
Great track until some auto tuned singer ruined it
Making Garfield and odie happy brodie
Legends of the Independent scene.
Polyphia has an incredible ability to incorporate external objects—sometimes unrelated to music—into their performances. Their creativity knows no bounds, and their latest move has left fans intrigued. It seems they ran out of room for tattoos, and their latest stunt has only added to their mystique.
Music was nice but then vocal came in :(
1:58
im 2 years late to the party but I digg this. subbbed I can totally get blazed to this music
Bassist Clay doesn't get enough appreciation
Ex wrote this in an apartment in Killeen Texas called Park place.
Vou usar
Man of rapper dude would’ve been talking about something legit over this masterpiece of music What’s he talking about some fat chick like dude for real?
As a lifelong music student I want to thank you for inspiring me to one day be good enough to listen to your music.
iloveu att manuel
I can’t believe I went 35yrs with out hearing these guys 🚀🚀🚀🚀🔥🔥🔥
Yeah well I can play twinkle twinkle little star on the keyboard, so.
Nice !
man im such a sucker for rock/hiphop renditions
TOO GOOD
I was wondering who the hell "Lil West" was. Then his part came in. Now I know who he is. He's the guy who ruins great songs.
Sooooooo goood  🤘☠️🤘

Tim's neck just be moving ↘️↗️⬅️➡️😂😂
1:04
Love this sound so much.
Espada vibes from ‘Bleach’ 🖤
Beginning made me think Yo soy Pablo Escobarrrrr
Let’s be real. The only metal thing about this track is the distorted guitar. Still a banger riff, and terribly well made
Those "vocals" are horrible, as that thing can't sing at all.
😎💜🙏
CHIMERA- 1.(in Greek mythology) a fire-breathing female monster with a lion's head, a goat's body, and a serpent's tail.  2.a thing that is hoped or wished for but in fact is illusory or impossible to achieve. "the economic sovereignty you claim to defend is a chimera"
You guys looking for a singer
lil west part is so fire
perfekt skladba.super.
Vildhjarta riffs
0:08. 1:40
man they made me like a song with autotuned lyrics
After hearing the vocalist come in.. I realized what kind of "singer" Polyphia needs.
weird how i like the song with lyrics the least.
Slick, Smooth. Thank you, love from Poland
The strange but fun kind of a chime in between sounds so cool 😎
Someone’s missing….
.
Started listening to them when they were just kids... They're all extremely individually talented and they progressively keep getting better and better... However, I still only like them instrumentally don't like how they have been incorporating vocals in their new music.
Wow... But not in a good way
drummer is sick, those stop beats
sicccc
Nothing comes to Chimaira (band)!
whats that one guys name that plays guitar really good? Ask him to play No Scrubs TLC his way!
The guitar metla part is fresh
Wow that's new
The rapper is ruining the piece.
Wuùùut🎉
Why have all but one got hair from the seventies...?
🤘🏻🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🤍 Honestly a fave♡♡♡
"Something funny I"'m saying it because someone asked me 2 say something funny so I did right now .. 9:30p.m.   Hamilton, ontario
Is extremely good. Incrydible 👌👍🤩
I think I found the inspiration for the demon's design in the vid: William Blake, The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the Sun, c. 1803-1805.
Every single one of these musicians is amazing!
Leave the satanic crap out and do the music.  The entertainment types worship a POS that hates them.  Stupid.
just here waiting on the inevitable Polyphia / Igorrr collab
someone tell these guys covid is out of fashion
De plus en plus demoniaque,   c'est dommage.  É cé neg-la ki plis diab Ké yo tou t' !!!   Tchiiiiip,   Awa !!
Scott's touch in this one is exceptionally badass!!! 😩🔥
Clay,tim,clay,scott i love you so much you are the goodest guitarist in the world.
Big props to Luke Holland and Clay A (and others which I'm sure) who did the drums. Absolutely monster grooves!
Lil West ruined it.
Chimera is such a deadly band and I think your tone would complement their sound!
HOW DID I NEVER KNOW THERE WAS A MUSIC VIDEO?.!?!?
Could have done without the random black dude
u all got me🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍
REAL COOL song, until ol Holmes decides to open his mouth XD
Alot of people will think that that style of guitar is Spanish but let this be heard the Spanish learned thier guitar playing frmm my people the roma aka gypsys that style is ours not the Spanish
These guys should do the next DOOM soundtrack
💀🤘💀🤘💀🇹🇷🇹🇷For the love of death
mind blown
Shoutout for knowing really underground rappers like lil west, who is kinda sick imo
sounds addictive
😜💗⚡️
Lil West did his thing with his verse, but man… Pop Smoke would’ve killed this track too.
How tf am I just finding this... holy shit it goes hard w percussion and sick riffs that I really can't describe.
How has no other band done this before?! Be SO good, with no words?!
🔥🔥🔥
*Hip hop meets flamenco meets mild metal. Crazy!!! Absolutely odd mixture. But people clearly love it.*
Perfect pairing. Please give me more Polyphia x rappers
Some WACK lyrics on such good music is a disgrace. Turned into total cringe that fast 🤦‍♂️
Banger
When i first heard some Polyphia, I did not know rock could sound so chill like that
The Porsche engine noise is fire
Tim's nylon riffs always give me chills, they're so cool
this shit is banger
🔥🤘
read chapter 69-70 of mercenary enrollment while listening to this song best shit ever, had me hype as fuck
☠️
My fav song!!!!!!!
ONE OF THEIR BEST
This is the same chimera that did trigger finger and pure hate?? Wtf😮 2024 is weird af. But now it's coming out that alot of these rappers worship satan. And all the years I got called a devil worshiper but they'll Blair about shaking ass,doing all the drugs,shooting up the rival gang. You can't look me in the face and tell me that imagery isn't satanic. All the years I got shunned. Smh 😂😂😂😂
Sorry, but that ever so popular subservient mumble ridden male autotune vocal is so tired and boring.
Stangely reminiscent of an 'Animals as Leaders' clip.
Lil West sucks, I'm here for Scottie's metal riffs
Bro when are you guys gonna release new music
Some times it's good. Yet mostly just a mushy mash up of noises.
wtf? Salsa rock hip hop jazz all in one song
The guest "rappers" all kind of ruin their music
Tim Henson and Scott LePage are equally matched, I think. Just my personal opinion, don't unalive me.
sounds like ronald jenkees at some point
Scott's djent riffs and tone are wild man. Love it. And clay 24/7 in the pocket as always. Shit is mint.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ooo gahhh damn, this is how you bend those genres so beautifully!!! 😍😍😍
И за что здесь люди лайк ставят!? Полная безвкусица. Да, всё красиво подано и сыграно вроде виртуозно, но ведь не о чем музыка то. Не гармонии, ни мелодической линии. Черепа и демоны. И это я должен принимать за искусство. Так мы перестанем различать красоту от безобразия.
Сатанисты!
That rap crap ruined it
this song is crazy

You guys need someone on the oboe or bassoon?
Y’all don’t need words… no raps or lyrics… just vibration … don’t sell out …  Deuteronomy 4:12 – The Lord Spoke Out Of the Fire  Then the Lord spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice.
so beautiful drumming
This song has been growing on me so hard. It's almost becoming the best song in the world.
lil west? really? ruined the whole song.
Total bad assery!! Love it.
Baphomet Gobbledygook.
👌👌
Кто пишет про музыку,кто пишет про вокал,а я пишу про то,какой красивый клип,просто шедевр!!!!)
cacophony
For other people this music is nothing, for me this is treasure. Salute to Polyphia and those musicians who innovate. Fxck this is so good!

Savants the entire band
Horrible. You just had to go hip-hop on us, didn't you! Disastrous.
So unique I like it a lot :)
Clay is a good instrument player
Vocals made be barf.
Make the drums more natural, all of you in the band are fucking awesome, let it shine.
It was good until Lil West's part. It felt like they put hubcaps on a Lamborghini at that point.
This rapping is the equivalent of me playing hot cross buns on a recorder during the middle of their compositions.
the rapping makes it garbage
All rap artists sound the same.
The drummer knows his beat,the guitarist know his time to lead,the rocker know how to smash dgent.👍
My first time hearing this band. Three guitars and a drum? Always the right recipe.
Kamikaze You chanel Hello 😛  bye
where can i buy that metallic covid mask
You need someone who can play mayonnaise
Not sure how I got here exactly, but I'm glad I did
Nooooooooooooo !
Gods.
They need to make a full album with him !!!
lil west dancing like a monkey cought me off guard
I need more rapping and shredding/creative guitar together.
this song is so fun to play ngl
Where are you GOD ? Cause', i'm dying right now. Music saves. Not you I guess, even if with pray.
These guys are ridiculously amazing. I would love if they pursued light-filled, Godly videography with their insanely talented music. The demonic imagery kills the vibes for me. They are incredibly blessed to be so talented. Think about how far they could go bringing inspiration instead.
Play this song acoustic as a band! :#
I’m addicted to this band.
The 8 string riff is simply insane😱😱💣
I love that the verse is just a BIG CHUGGY BOI
This shit go HELLA HARD!!!!🤘💯🤘
Polyphia is truly amazing; however, our tendency to overlook their brilliance stems from banner blindness. They played a pivotal role in pushing the instrumental music genre closer to the mainstream, notably with "Strife." As they gained popularity, societal stereotypes emerged, leading to the formation of distinct groups. Among these are novice guitarists who, having just picked up the instrument, elevate Polyphia to god-like status after learning their riffs in a year or two. The intense scrutiny and criticism they face result from the heightened expectations and the magnifying glass through which we view their art.  The pressure intensifies as Polyphia grows, garnering both admirers and detractors. In a smaller setting, the band would receive tenfold praise, but with growth comes an increasing number of critics. Detractors often pinpoint perceived flaws, though these critiques aren't objectively wrong; rather, they reflect the perspective of individuals who have chosen to focus on the band's shortcomings. This phenomenon isn't exclusive to Polyphia; it's applicable to any artist or art form. It's akin to the min-maxing concept in video games, where enthusiasts meticulously analyze and critique every aspect.  As the band develops a devoted following, a cult-like atmosphere can arise, prompting a closer examination that reveals negative aspects. In the yin and yang of artistic appreciation, negative perspectives inevitably accompany positive ones. Art, including music, is subject to intense scrutiny, much like the meticulous analysis of a video game's mechanics. The key is recognizing that, in this dance of positive and negative perspectives, there will always be a counterpoint to the praise that art receives
insane track wasted with autotune imho
The rapping killed the song ngl. Ruined my vibe
🤟
um dos meus favoritos
The whole piece sounded extremely fancy, until the hiphop came in. That kinda ruined it for me
Seriously what planet did these guys come from 🥹🥲
I have only just found you guys. How long you been together an how do you mix an match such complex rhythms.💯💯💯🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
I'm gonna call stevie t
Hey do ya'll need a cow bell player?
The song could end at 2:35🥰
I would like to hear a Symphony Version of this.
Best discovery I’ve made in recent history
This must be the next theme song to the next antagonist in Dragon Ball.
One of their best and most badass tracks. It's going in my workout playlist for sure.
Nice song, but that Lil guy? Nah, you don't need it.
so many people whistling polyphia tunes on the streets and in elevators.
Scott's first riff lands so hard
Literally one of the most important bands of our time. LONG LIVE POLYPHIA!
Unpopular opinion - I like Chimera more than ABC. BOTH are great. But I like Lil West's sound paired with this band much better.
The intro by Scott is the most disgustingly beautiful thing I've heard in a long time.
This is my new favorite Polyphia's song. Combining my favorite genres.
The song would be so much better without the auto tune rapper dude
Nope...
Just found these guys. New fan for life!!!
0:45
🤌 this was straight up Art, thank you all for you hard work and sharing your genius.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Would love to see a feature of Synyster gates in a song like this.  Not a rapper with no skill in anything
Didn't Luke Holland right some of the drum parts for this one?
Damn that guitar is growling
The drumming is epic.
Amaziiiiiinh
Come to brasil guys
I love how unique this is ❤
Never again, please
This is fucking amazing why have I not heard it until today?
Polyphia - Zombie
This song is amazing until the shitty singer with the shitty lyrics comes in, unlike with Sophia black which brings some form of singing(lyrics are garbage though), and other more pleasant attributes, this guy just feels out of place, specially after such great metal riffs. There used to be good rap metal mixes in the 90s, this semi mumble garbage is just exactly garbage. Example, the sound track of the movie "Judgment night", or the sound track of Spawn its got great rap and metal bands collaborating And Christ the drummer is insane, that tightness...
2:05
This reminds me of the electric cello stuff i learned in college. Very jazzy and dark. Gonna have this one stuck in my head for hours. ❤
fave
When Scotty is like "But...let me play metal!"
Hear me out... violin
This song kinda feels like Tim and Scot having a rap battle but with guitars. The way the go's back and forth between them.
Oh gee we all supposed to wear masks again. Full off maye
No one is talking about that sick mouth piece Tim's wearing
What the dawg doing with vocals!!!!! Omg vocals in polyphia. Huh!!!!!!
hell LHO,YOU GUYS ARE TOO AWESOME, BuT...THIS IS THE Chimera!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2E7Jl7m7D8
Guys, check in the discription, it says that this is playing god featuring lil west....😂😂😂
Fbbhbjk
Drummer sounds like a $99 drum machine
the man ram caught my attention... what does it really mean?
There is always an Asian that will do it better, faster, and more intelligently than you. That is the basis of this band.
Polyphia and Jabawakeez need to collab. Their precision are made for each other.
Love it , I was a aspiring Guitar Player in my youth. Now have Parkinsons and can't play anymore. I can normally hear a guitar part and know what the Player is playing, this blows my mind, keep doing that ❤❤❤❤
One of my favorite ones 😢
can someone help my dumbass idk the song 😔
I love this song but I CANNOT defend that horrible rap, it never fails to make me laugh
Does Scottie have a metal nose cover? 😂
I can't stop. Soooooo good
Damn.
Ive been searching for this song for months 😭 😭 😭 😭
All the complaints about lil West are exactly why Tim went on a media run shitting on rock fans
This is some of the best music I’ve heard in decades. 🤯
That drummer is so insanely good!!! Why is this song not trending right now!!! Found this by accident and loving 🔥
Very underrated song right there!  The drum part on this track is just outta this world!
I’m here for hype Clay, drummer Clay can get it too 😂😂😂
the 1:59 -  2:18 part was what made me loop the song like a madman
Lil West looks like fairy tail.
Damn this is great. The contrast in Scotts and Tims sound is awesome and I really dig Scotts parts. And both drums and bass are unbelieveble... the timing, the attack, the power... what a foundation for the guitar players.
Great! 🖤
Loved it until he started rapping
im a dichead but yall re pretty
nah they ot respect
What the fuck is this creature? The antichrist is real, soon he will come into the world, but Jesus will also return, repent while there is still time, seek him while he is accessible, because when he returns many will wish for death but will not be able to die...
Could do without little goofy rapping. Ruins the song
Tim put the COVID mask away, ronas over.  Great song tho
Drummer is afraid of catching corona from the drums.
This song gives me hope for an eventual JID feature  as well as being a legit banger.
Good song, dont know why theres the most generic sounding rap over part of the song.
You all are talking about the song and it is cool but those guitars and chrome face masks... I want them
amigos eu acho que o som de vcs é brabo de mais mas humildemente quero deixar meu feedback aos músicos, seria infinitamente mais brabo se usassem bateria acústica ao invés desse beat eletrônico totalmente sem vida, sem dinâmica ,sem oscilação de tempo, fica parecendo que a musica foi toda programada por um computador
Before Polyphia showed up on the scene, no one had ever made acoustic guitars look so sexy
Not a fan of the rap part but over all really good! Keep doing you Polyphia. Guitar work is insane as always
Run it gun it, ain't nobody frontin, hit em with the hands or the gunplay. I only make it out alive like one way¡¡¡
Needs Phil boseman or Trevor strnard (rip)
We need an instrumental only version to this song asap!
Is that a nose-mask at 3:34 ? 😂
Amasing what drugs can do.forgive me i don't judge people just the substance xxx
00:53 i hear some part of "ayonima"
Enjoying up to vocals, then it killed it, lil west should go south onto another video, polyphia don’t need him, don’t fix something that isn’t broke
Tims little head nods when playing are funny as hell Idek why 😂
Making of chimera pls
5 months later, i'm still pissed at that terrible rapper for ruining the first bad Polyphia song, it was all good, until the toddler started *_"rapping"_* ("rapping" is bold and italics to imply that he was in fact, NOT rapping and was instead being a toddler. Eminem is a rapper. my cousin Jimi is a rapper. the guys from NWA are rappers. Twiztid are rappers. Sir Mix-A-Lot is a rapper. but NOT this guy...)
Lyrics about as basic as it gets, but good song.
The Red Dragon imagery was pretty damn epic, tbh
You guys are pure evolution of guitar and music rn always admire you beautiful human beings
Really want to see this or a song like this on the Spiderverse movies, I was thinking about Lil West’s hair, costume, and vocal style while listening to the soundtrack especially for the Prowler Miles scene. Would have been chefs kiss.
Wonderful..
lil west gave me travis Scott vibes on this, this song is so hard.
How could he turn my mood in the first 5 seconds into such beautiful?.. And after 19 seconds it gets demonic and satanic like driving to he'll. And quite after 3 minutes it takes you on a little new age rap trip. So perfectly strange.
Just success, too beautiful Final Fantasy  ❤
love your music but this looks like some satanic F!!!!!kery, say it isn't so
Pareciera que es un metal bien brutal por toda la estética, pero de verdad me.gusto el concepto es fantástico
Spectacular! x
Y’all should get a singer literally y’all’s the best at the base and the drums shit br 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Só eu que sou Brasileiro e adoro o som desses caras? 🇧🇷
Really with the face diapers guys? o.0
Just one question what religion do u follow?
you guys looking for classicla piano player?
I like these skins on some of the guitars,.Can some one tells me more of it?
Great track. Except for the singing bit, makes the ending pretty lame...
another music video featuring the  👿
Wicked
Ukinana nagpangit met jay nangisit nga agkankanta. Kapaaryek rupa na sika
Really like this 1. Pushing limits in so many ways as far as drum samples and the mix of math rock classical with the rock / tap riffs.  I appreciate bands or artists who take risks. Playing it too safe or generic is boring imo in 2023. That’s what I’m trying to do with my fretboard invention.  I really like LW vocals I just wish he’d play it less safe lyrically and go more poetic abstract rather than try to rap about trap style lyrics. That’s my advice or taste but overall I liked the entire track and structure / build up to vocals.  I appreciate bands that take risks Wish lyrically it was more abstract.
Wests part shoulda been a lot longer mannn
3:33 the warhorse nose mask lol
You know a song is a straight up fucking banger when the “most replayed” section according to YouTube is literally 0:00.
Needs more cowbell!
Amazing.
I can play cowbell
This one's just Tight as  shit. Love that heavy riff Scotty's ripping off.  then with the acoustic Flamingo coming in. DAMMM. You guys just keep getting better and better which is f****** hard to do when you've set the bar so f****** high. RLTW 3/75
We need MORE  - metal - ethnic - metal - folk - metal - rapcore - metal - alternative - metal - christian - metal - vegetarian- metal - metal - metal - and metal from  theese guys  thnx fr0m Russia <3
I heard you guys were looking for a triangle player
Lil West be looking like a fool.
You guys need a singer?
Is the video based off the red dragon painting?
Something so mesmerizing about this song. Perfect blend of heavy electric and nylon
Monster!
nice
F autotune 😂 lil west
The rap just screws up the song
Me encanto que belleza.😊
For a second I thought it's "Feat. Lil Wayne"... please make one with him playing a guitar solo.
They ate on this
I only clicked on this because I heard they were a Christian group 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ there is nothing Christian about this wicked ass group and then you got the flunky black rapper dressed as Satan. Our race is going out back the sad way.
soo clean it kills 99.99% of germs.
fui al unico que le sono como corrido tumbado el inicio ?
What a badass anime soundtrack
This might be the most boring shit I've ever heard in my life.
Damn it
this hits my music g-spot 🔥 🔥
Music and Clay was flipping his hair finnese this video
Somewhere in the world, someone is twerking to this 1:31
Cringe.
Sick!
I listen to this when my black metal friends aren't around
the best part of this song is “tyaudyaudyaudyaudyau”
dudes...chill with the video cuts.  thats like 42000 cuts in a 4 minute video.
Dark
this is so damn good!
Needs more cowbell
Live raw music...enter autotune😢
Ah finally a modern band without satanic imagery ...well $#!+ NM
my favorite one is the guy in black and white
I can play car
Was that the Red Dragon??? Holy shit that looks good
Soy el comentario en Español que estabas buscando...
Son unos cracks
the rap section was good.
The riffs in this song really capture the beastly vibe of a chimera.
Lost me with Lil West. Get Dr. Octagon.
You guys just need some Cow Bell to make it to number 1.
I looooooooooove thiiiiiiiiiiiis
1:26
3:1
1.25
Full heavy album please - EMBRACE IT! See you guys at the end of June in Brissie! <3
clay (drum) is fucking nuts
I know these guys are insanely talented, like i mean seriously gifted, but does anyone actually think this sounds good? i cant seem to like this song, no melody just random dark noises kinda bad tbh?
lil west looks a lot like the real lion chimera i seen on youtube. a while ago... no way I'm ever going to share it.
How I wish Ren was on this track insted of Lil west
bro i gotta learn guitar
Love the trap beat!!
Talk about ruining a great song, soon that guy started singing
Why they wearing stupid face masks? Another indoctrination band?
I love this song 👌🏻 polyphia are just getting better with each release
Polyphia and Sleep Token NEED to tour the states. Co-headline.
For now on, this belongs in my plalist❤
love it
Best song on the album imo
me thinking this is a great one and then 2:36 drops 🤯🤯🤯
good girl in a costume
Was going good until y'all put in that mumble rap that didn't make a bit of sense!! Just bullshit lyrics 😂. But everything else was awesome 😎!!!
Drummer all day on this
Why laud the Devil and what goes around inside the LGTBQ+ ? Suckers! Couldn't you just play your beautiful music?
What guitar does Tim use on the first beginning of the song??
Could be better lyrics and vocals, but this is a testament to how polyphia can play and harmonize anything
Todo iba muuy bien hasta el min 2:35 🤣
This but without Lil West🙏💯
Perhaps the best Guitarists and instrumental band in the world right at this moment, these guys are Far Beyond the Sun.
Owh gitu ya lagi sama mamah dan bapa..
Awesome
Last of Us...
After exploring your music and whole vibe I can really say that I cannot wait to see you all at @aftershockfestival this october in Sacramento Ca!! Gonna be one epic 4 days of festival and  100 bands !!!!!! lets go 🤘🤘🤘🤘#afterhock
Dear Polyphia   Please re release most hated with Clay actually performing. ❤️
Tim Henson đẹp điên
This band just writes better songs each time excellent I can't wait until your in L.A. for a show ❤
I'm am RnB/Funk kinda girl but I am hooked on these guys and memorised by the talent of the drummer! ❤ Goes to show good music/talent transcends genre!
More than anything, I love the mask.
Still cant believe the band that played ABC is the same band that played this song
this is why i admire them they do not discriminate other artist, don't restrict themselves and wasn't afraid experimenting+collabing  with other artists+genre w/c resulting to more interesting creativity for both & producing fresher style+sounds
nice to hear you guys play a groove
I don’t know what this is but it’s 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It was awesome until the autotune kicked in. If you can't sing without autotune, just stop. It ruins the virtuosity of the rest of the performance.
You don't know me and probably never will. I was born in San Antonio, Texas with my siblings and my parents.  My parents were physically and mentally abusive. At 18 I moved away to MT and now your song is coaxing me back from self harming. You guys are hero's physically and mentally. You guy's are hero's, better than Tony Stark and Spiderman.
crazy W
Good on Clay for considering the others while drumming with COVID😂
God damn this song is so smooth holy shit
Satanic elements are all over.
when the track got you making an ugly face then you know its good lol
This song is a 3 Michelin Star steak for your ears
This tickles every spot in my brain in the best way.
I'm just tired of this rap delivery tbh. Too many people use it. And I'm fuckin sick of it.
I love this song Album but, I still with clay squared got more shine. This song I think is the best for them but they still feel like back ground chars ....
man I'm a sucker for a trap beat in a fat Bass
This is absolutely masterful. The delicate layering and the way it all comes together. Really brilliant.
This vocal style ruins the song in my opinion...
Was the rap really needed?
Me mié
One of my top favorites for sure <3 Can't to see you all again in Minneapolis, MN!  (EDIT 10/22/23) Came back here to say that my two siblings and I actually saw Polyphia in Milwaukee, WI. The crowd there was definitely a better vibe than our home state MN. The three of us will be looking forward to seeing Polyphia at their next concert ❤❤❤❤
Can’t wait for Polyphia - Syncopated One Note Solo featuring Lil Wayne.
Ufff temazo 🔥
The intro is so long
I’ll never get over this song
These lyrics suck please don't do this on the regular this band is to good for this
hello what good style😮❤
Awesome fade out with that Juicy reverb
The growl in this one is pure delicious, ecstasy... I felt it all the way down.... Shivers....
Perfect Soundtrack for the NWO. I still dig it.
I just discover this because Steve Vai featuring and i was surrender! this guys are f crazy and make master pieces for sure. WTF
Song ruined by the shitty auto tune rapping
unpopular opinion: the rap part sucks. it's just ruined this amazing song
That was sexy
I like when scottie goes. Nee nee nee nah neee
Música do demo?! Pra fazer um som legal tem que cultuar o cão?! Estou fora...  Music from the demo?! To make a cool sound you have to worship the dog?! I'm out...
Been going crazy over this album every single day since it dropped
OMG! That is incredible fusion of hard-core musicianship, metal, classical, Jazz, hip-hop, … it defies names. it is glorious!!!
I love the subtitles
Woooooooow!!!!!!😎💯🔥🎶
This collab is fire 🔥🔥🔥
The best musicians and song writers for decades... Thankyou from one music lover to another.. MORE MORE MORE
Lucifer Fled Mikael beat him once and shall win again Lucifer Fled In the valley of the wicked, good shall prevail
Art of music......
Take off the covid mask you clowns.
Good song.  Love it
love polyphia but these are kindergarten bars by lil west though
love it !!
Linkin Park paved the way but ya'll perfected the fusion. Absolutely stunning.
Love you guys. Can we get some bass playthroughs from Clay? We have playthroughs from all the other members and we want to see his chops!
Look, children, please stop hating on me... Just because I supplied ALL the floating bubbles for this video, as a worldwide respected bubble expert doesn't give you the right to attack my superior talent in bubble procurement! Grow up Plebes!
Drake song
Polyphia song with vocals is insane whoat
Where has this been all my life. GOD why haven't  you put this band in my life before!
Everytime I listen to this Lil west ruins this song
Wow, the perfect combination of hearing and vision!!!
"Baptized in the money"
Think its random they choose this collaboration video to wear masks??!...  ..guys stop doing this to yourselves.   .. if you don't understand what I'm saying that's probably for the better... make sure you get your boosters bros.
Am I the only one who thinks this type of playing is mediocre. there is no soul it sounds nice sometimes mostly notes randomly going over each other, not everyone is a virtuoso. I really don't understand this shit. It's like the Beatles they were average but everyone freaked out over them now they be famous.  Cover Trevor Green - only then will Henson be good, it's just nylon strings slapping randomly my bru. T Henson prove me wrong and play Trevor Green - Another Brick in the Wall.  fancy sounds does not mean your music is good, think in the terms of Hendrix. Trevor Green cover if you dare, I doubt you would stoop so low to play any inferior music according to poliphelia.
This would fit so well in Bleach
can someone remix the guitar parts to sound like farts?
That little pinch in  3:20-3:26 with the vocals gave me chills dude;///
Great instrumental piece. But that maxed out autotune is killing the song.
dope
I hope y’all understand this comment, but you are the Angus Young and Malcolm Young of the proficient musician Style Bands! Can’t have one without the other, and they both make each other legendary!    This rhythm section is up there with Led Zeppelin, Rush, and KXM!  Yeah, the old guys have a pretty bad ass Band too!   Can’t wait to see you guys change everything in music !   By the way, I was a heavy metal rock singer back in the 80s and 90s in Dallas Texas so I just love the fact your from Plano ! 🎉👍🏼👊❤️
Rap is crap
Rap + rock= greatness
I couldn't stop bopping my head to this.
Everything was amazing up until 02:36
Metal Flamenco. Right? Heavy distorted guitar with a clean one over the top?
bad ass song!
Someone's gonna twerk on this 1:31-1:40
Everything is Cannon, except no thots. You know what they say. "Thoughts before THOTS".
decadent, only bad music... too bad
Hearing lyrics felt so jarring 😅
For real one of the best "sound check" songs ever made for DJ's.
Credit to Luke Holland, he wrote some insane complex drum beats
Hear me out ababcde right
The seven tho!! Breh!!!! Ducking heithens
Please collab with Roman Kim and other instrument modern virtuoso
Hey, ABC and O.D. works really well together as a medley, you should try it out!
nose mask moment
The very, very generic rapping takes me out of this one. The only miss on the album for me.
Where's the lyrics?
good work
0:29 - the BEST pinch harmonic of the song and one of the BEST I've ever heard ❤️
The devil movement at it's best! The dude rappin is horrable!
Every Video Simply Amazing PERIOD!!!!!!
0:18 Enter Scottman. That was sick by Scottie, and for God's sake when will Tim ever stop flexing? The guy is so overpowered
is weird to hear a polyphia with distortion bruh
Bruh!! Scott page's silver beak at the end got me 😅 thats fire 🔥
pro-tip: listen to this with boosted bass
would be much better as an instrumental IMO.
God you guys are so amazing
Had me until the "vocals." Not a match. Lil West is talentless. EVERYTHING ELSE is simply elegant, precise, and beautiful.
Are we not going to talk about Scottie's bejewled nose?
Song needs a sequel
Amazing song, terrible vocals/rap. Please release an instrumental version.
If this is not on repeat there is something wrong  going on so just play and play again  and then play more
Perfect 🔥
Man, fucking awesome.. Are the visuals in the video, at all inspired by "The Great Red Dragon" by William Blake??
Is Clay pulling Tim’s arm to his crotch in the thumbnail? 😂
What’s with the shitty auto tune singer 😂
This is something the Rothschilds would listen to
I been trying real hard to stay away from rap lately. But this song is great. Easily my favorite off the whole album. The other rap song on this isn’t my cup of tea tho… need more music that blends these genres. Please let me know of more music like this.
it is bad...
this tune is sellout shit
Huh
I’m straight outta Delaware an NOBODY knows lil west he gotta be a industry  🌱
Without question the most innovative band in the world right now
Spanish music with metal again... Ok
This video is giving me mad Daredevil Netflix Intro
was this supposed to have destruction and lots of VFX? i wonder
az ének geciszar xdddddddddd
They Speak thru the music ❤. The feeling comes from the music.
I just received my second "Telegram" me message in 2 days - via YouTube. One just came after commenting here. The, I won something, message.
The door is wide open. I just wish this song was a lot longer :) Those double entendres are sick.
God this song makes me feel like I gotta like fight for my life, it's envigorating!
It is a pity for the non sense hip hop vocals. The music is amazing (despite the drum machine…) but a hip hop vocal “singing” on such technically superfine music has ruined everything.
This entire album blew my mind Polyphia are fucking amazing composers holy shit like <3 O_O
The collab we didn't know we needed
The band is awesome, the rapper is trash. If you want to make it big don't do what you're doing here
umm, is this what they call illuminati?
So I'm guessing rappers can't actually sing and that's why they are auto-tuned to buggery.
This goes hard asf at 75% speed 🔥🔥🔥
Oh man, that rap at the end messed up a great song.
Can you guys pls produce something with Ethan Bortnick, he got some crazy piano skills and a style that could work good together with your guys style.
I like the fact that the drum kit is bare bones. .  Minimalistic. .  All you need to make your drumming statement. .  Nothing excessive. .  Not a 10,000 drum kit
Hopefully the tattoo addiction comes to an end. It would be sad if the tattoos continue onto his face.
É uma musica feita para o diabo ... Olhem o vídeo como adoram o demônio ... Simples , eles fizeram pacto e ta tudo bem,
Trap ate polyphia
Can someone explain why Luke holland is credited on iTunes ?? I don’t get it
Did a bot write the rap lyrics?  They make no sense just a bunch of random lines 😂
I don't listen past 2:34   That guy destroyed this masterpiece
Sweet googly moogly this is outstanding
best song I've ever heard right until 2:35 need a 2:35 length cut version
<3
Omg Tim is very attractive so of course I'd grab his arm like clay looks like he does in the thumbnail in a heartbeat! Maybe he thinks same I mean I don't know who wouldn't hehe 🤭😘😉😏
I just wanna know how Lil west came up with the lyrics to this instrumental and shits Lol. Polyphia gave him a concept and boom...here is ya rap part man, or did they co-write it from the beginning.
After the release of this album, I have been listening to this song the most. Definitely my favorite of all the tracks 😇
That nylon riff is making me moan
This is so weird!!
Lyrics ########## Good girl in a costume It's your world when I'm with you Forever with you like a tattoo I paint a picture in a bad mood She feel the breeze like a parachute I got cheese, get a pair of shoes Big body, need a lot a room She keep callin' when I'm never home I'll be what you need lowkey on the east I can see everything that you went through I'll be your tool, I can fix you Even if I lose, it'd be nothing new She old news to the whole school It's my rules when I make moves I make it rain like a monsoon My new bae, can you come soon? The best high was the best ride She said that she really wanna come out to the west side If she comin' with me, she can hit me with her best side She can be my Mrs, give me kisses on my best side Lowkey, when we in the night You want me but it's never right Hold me, I'm a low life You know me 'cause I'm on the rise
yuck
I don't understand why this song has only 2M views, this is so good.
really disturbing
Rap would sound way better with rock band instruments
I confess I cried tears of joy listening to this song.
Why is a character from star trek wrapping on a polyphia track
*SICKY*
PLS COLLAB WITH SUNGHA JUNG ! 😁
Didn't need the rap. Pass.
The lyrics here are all about seducing a girl into Satanism, from the point of view of Satan
@Polyphia   You are one of the best bands I've ever heard.  But honestly, it needs to have the symbolism GOAT, Baphome, in the songs, alias, in almost all of them. Need Guys?  Keep playing, but remember GOD is bigger.
What’s with the masks lol
This is a whole new level right here. Dayumm
Unique
Please! I need more clay gober in the music videos, hes so fine
I absolutely LOVE the combination of different genres that Polyphia is able to blend. Their music is so unique. Almos like genre onto itself.
Dont like the rap. The music being played is way too complex and sick. for "she keep calling when I'm not home. Gtfo of here.
What is this ornate prog metal trap flamenco sounding thing? It fucking blows minds. You can't listen to it once and walk away... you have to listen over and over and over again.
This goes hard! I'm not surprised though.
Pussy crush’n as always
Is this nu metal
the random rapper guy kinda ruins it, it's like Mozart with some ghetto trash talking all over it. there's literally zero talent in whoever that guy is, i'd be embaressed for him, but im sure he somehow has millions of dollars for talking like a child with autotune. good for him. but this ain't his stage. he should go be talentless somewhere else.
So much going on musically, all the harmonized notes and synched percussion. Truly beautiful. Fan For Life.
Wow! Sounds so cool!
STATUS Between Pro buds make this song sound exactly as intended!
What’s that horned creature?
Magical goes in your ears yet enters the blood stream  and stays  Your pure POlyphia 🤘🥰❤️
Been listening to lil west for years so crazy to see him pop up in a polyphia song he needs to blow up already
bad move
Polyphia won't reach a peak. They are immortal. Only the body dies. Maybe they didn't know that before putting out this record. I take my original comment about rap being a problem for it. Just was thinking that tuning back to 432hz... And annoyance about the rap box that rappers have designed. We have much more than that optimism in store
Because I am an internet rando and I have a vital, important opinion:  You guys might consider reaching out to Steve Stevens if you're open to additional guest guitarists going forward - though a lot of people know him only as Billy Idol's songwriting partner and lead guitarist, he's an amazing flamenco player whose nylon-stringed work would dovetail nicely with you guys, and he's all about finding new musical ways to keep it alive, so I bet he'd love to contribute to some of your trap-inspired grooves. And, flamenco aside, he can prog-shred with the best of them.   Plus - ray guns.  Although "Flamenco A Go Go" can show you how he was looking to evolve flamenco & "Memory Crash" would demonstrate some of his shreddier stuff,  "Falling In Circles" off of Bozzio/Levin/Stevens "Black Light Syndrome" (for a quick listen); "The Sun Road" off the same album (for a more patient exploration) better demonstrate what I'm talking about in terms of the the flexibility of his value add to a potential future Polyphia track.  If your management doesn't know him, pretty sure Steve Vai has a way to get in touch with him - Stevens appeared on a Vai-released Christmas album awhile back.
guitar guy stole David Bowies outfit
Lil West dressed like Lucian from league of legends
Tim got the coolest guitar i ever saw
How can somebody Not love this Song, Tim and the guys :D
Who ever did the mix on the drums deserve an award! Pure crisp gold
COOL
When Satan looks like a yogurt covered raisin
Please no more trash rap garbage
Maybe no more trashy guests u guys do t need that baggage on your beautifully crafted (REAL MUSIC)please don’t mix it with trash
Probably an unpopular opinion, but I wish there was a version of this incredible tune without the rhythm slowing and somewhat “whiny” rap bit at the end… 🤷🏻
3:43 هل يستطيع أحد أن يخبرني ماذا يعني هذا المخلوق ، ما هو تمثيله؟
This has definitely become my favorite Polyphia song . How the fuck are these youngsters so talented? I'd swear this confirms reincarnation. Tim and Scotty had to play guitars in a past life.
Your music is excellent.  Stop having stupid rapers sing.  Your music is perfect.  No more stupid singers
Sick! The dude started raping on his guitar  on Lil West's lyrics!
Lmao. Playing is still epic, but for fucks sake man. Whatever record executive is whispering in their ear will surely make them millions. But at what cost? This is officially music for low information people who want to feel intelligent. That dude probably cant even read.
This song blows my mind!! My only "complaint" is that the face melting ending shred gets mixed out too soon! If you listen to it in the playthrough video, you get more of that tasty goodness.
I wonder what came first.. the vocals or the instruments
🔥
I imagine Polyphia rolling the dice to figure out what to put in a song. "OK, it's a three, so we need to start with some flamenco guitar. Now it's a five, so we need to add some trap beats. And then a six, so we need to end with some neoclassical shredding". And somehow it works!
Man have a demon in the vid, wtf.
Post Malone is very into metal. Now would be the time to collab with him
they gotta stop ruining their majestic songs with some trashass vocalist, second time already...
Troppo bello sto pezzo! Un mix dei miei generi preferiti ❤
chimera ant
People who want to look like inhuman idiots should expect to be treated like inhuman idiots.
stupid autotune lil west part :/
Make Bulgaria a destination on one of your tours, guys. I'm certain many people would love to see you live as much as me.
Y’all went crazy and Lil West complimented this song so well. Good work by all 🔥
It was awesome before the mumble rap.
wish there was an instrumental version of the album ...
For the curious ones, that demonic creature actually comes from a painting by William Blake called The Great Red Dragon :)
What does the bassist do?
Bossanova + Progressive Metal + Drill + Trap = Holy Shit 😳
Great tune till the crap rap. Definitely could have done with out it...
I will never enjoy the stupid EMD bullshit they've been putting in their music for a few years.
🤮🤮🤮🤮
I can't decide whether or not I like this song but these guys are talented musicians :)
Honestly not bad
Making space for cut price rappers has not been their greatest move
gay
Why does the rapper look like a moron non human. And sing very boringish.
From "Walk This Way" to this, the world is evolving.
Cirikas mereka sudah mulai dihilangkan sendiri
This song is absolutely one of their best. I love these little guest appearances from vocalists too. I'm hoping they incorporate singers a little bit more 🤏
Anyone knows what guitar Scott is playing? Looks a hell of a lot like a Firewild but they do not exist in 8 strings.
Is there an instrumental version?
This song is so sexy.
if I didn't know better I'd say this is Hair Metal bc they definitely have the best male hair on the music industry holy shit, no homo.   I tried having long hair and it looked like shit compared to both Clays' hair, actually. XD
Love the guitar, bass and drums, basically polyphia. But oh gosh the rap was cringe af. Atleast a skilled and good rapper would have been better
Os caras conhecendo Polyphia depois de ver o Cap tocar kakakakakakakak
@polyphia I saw a wrist watch vibrating metronome recently you guys might like it
scott with the schnozer shield
Interesting..
I'm in love 🥰😍
https://youtu.be/PuIyAr0ZBKI tim can you cover this please?
Tim's nodding is everything.
These classical guitars are very reminiscent of The Brain Dance by Animals As Leaders, which was probably my first favourite song from that weird new genre.
Awesome
3:13-3:25 pure ecstasy
As a old...er person from the old school who was worriedd about the future of music, I don't have to worry anymore. This band is beyond extaordinary. There is so many good things about it.  The drummer, the guitars, the bass, the sound. the back and forth. It's like watching a great battle on a movie screen. It's been a while since I've seen this in music. Just outstanding artistry these young men.
So glad I listened to these guys back when they were still not as big. 30 years from now, polyphia's playstyle will influence the next generation just like Vai, Hendrix, EVH, and many other legends did. I cannot fathom what instrumental guitar would be like in the future, 200 years from now this will be considered ancient which to me is fricking crazy. Marcin, Ichika, Jason, Tim, Manuel, Plini are all millenials! Can't wait to see what the next generation of young virtuosos will sound like!
Mind-blowing! Insane! Love it!
Love you guys. Can’t stand the hip hop auto tuned vocals.
best one on the album
People actually like this? Too much purple drank, Tim. He’s starting to think he’s a black female r&b artist
lost a fan in one song
😯😯😯😎😎😎
They've got the skills. They're continuously honing their image and sound. I'm so inspired by these guys (and Lil West).  I think they could do some serious damage with Roddy Ricch, Rae Sremmurd, or Posty. It'd need to be a full-song collab though, not a feature that shows up 2/3 into the song.
fucking banger
Sound like from a retro games on final boss, pretty dope!
Good to see Polyphia is into Stoicism
The freaking low-end man🔥
Good up to about 220
Bro!😎🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
why do they make the video look  like a setanic song 🤦
used this song to test my new headphones my ears have been blessed i can now die in peace ong
it was going so well until they brought in the rapper. it's like having a nice dinner party and then the crazy uncle shows up and starts ranting
💙
Masterpiece 😭😭.
😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
I was enjoying that, till the (c)rap section came in.
Dragon
I love the way you're mixing the two genres together unique and original 🔥🔥🔥
Music to listen to whilst pumping up your car tyre!...... We've all been in that zombie state...
Can't listen to Polyphia without some kind of bass boost now, once you get boosted Gober you never go back.
Such amazing musicians…so talented. why’d you have to ruin the song with a no talent rapper. He’s horrible. Rap is the worst thing to happen to music in the history of music
I would love to hear what some Randy Blythe vocals would sound like with these guys.
3:30 I'm feeling like I'm hearing Infant Annihilator with Arch Enemy after a trap song lmfao
I like it getting heavy tones drums killing it as always!!!! Rap is alright
Voice ruins all
you guys are obviously awesome but continue wearing those tyrannical useless virtue-signaling face diapers and get no respect from the critical common sense crowd which is on the rise day by day! Just saying, there a reminder of the oppressive tyrannical lockdowns that ruined people's lives and dreams over a planned false medical emergency!  I mean come on don't musicians have common sense and critical thinking skills along with all that talent? WTF are you guys thinking or is that the problem you weren't thinking?
Okay, now just get with Berried Alive and you'll have the whole set. You'll make music together eventually so just get it over with
These guys are from Texas they need to link up with Travis Scott who's also from Texas their sound his flow would be so sick !
Hey Hip Hop, jump in a time machine and set the dial to 2002. The whole genre sounds like a dying old man waiting for oblivion these days. It's like the amount of effort you don't put in is directly proportional to how successful you are. If you listen to mainstream modern Hip Hop you are a bad person. These motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre.
Lil west part destroys the integrity of this song. It was at a place of high intellect but it got stupefied with meaningless lyrics.  Smh. It's considerate of you guys to put some kind of "rap" to make it "stand out" but that sort of innovation kills all the potential this had to begin with.
OMG ❤ this left me "Musically rewired right now@ ❤️💙❤️
Tim's guitar is never loud enough and the drums and distorted guitar are way too loud!!
Uuhm can we get instrumental pls?
Thanks for the Beato interview BTW... I didn't realize I wasn't subbed, am now
scottie's tone in this is unreallll. He sniffs out the best tones
Was all in, about to recommend this band to several people, in fact, copying link to share, and then 2:37 happened.  It's like having a Michelin star chef concoct rhe perfect dish, and then 💩 in it.
This is fucking insane thats the best band i discover in my life this is life changing i can't stop listening to this masterpiece polphia you fucking killed it
What the fuck ! Crasy song !
Dopeness
Gross. I was anticipating the vocals…soo looking forward to it. Why oh why, can’t mainstream rap be more creative? Nothing this rapper says is deep, only surface level. Polyphia created such an amazing song and this rapper ruins it with dr. Seuss rhymes meant for school kids. Im positive the rapper could have been much more creative with his words and actually conveyed something worth telling. He ruined the song In My Opinion.
Polyphia and Stevai  playing together will be in history , could u guys collaborate with Joe Satriani also?
E 👏 MI 👏 NEM 👏😤🔥🔥🔥
Anyone know I similar band or artist? Or just something you’d recommend? This bangs so hard
This is like slapping up a finger painting next to a Picasso
And just like that my new favourite genre of music has been made. Being a MASSIVE metal and rap fan this is the blend ive always been looking for! Absolutely killer!🔥🔥
Should try to link up with Denzel Curry or J.I.D they'd be the most likely to play ball and play it well over something like this.
song needs another verse
I think for a rap verse Tech N9ne would be perfect for this.
Adding hip hop is such a cool idea and I think it will work really well but this rap verse was way too cliche, it kinda lessened the impact of the music for me.
https://youtu.be/WInf_9JOBdA
Day 1 of asking Polyphia to remix "positions" by Ariana Grande.....👀👀👀
You can say a lot of things about Polyphia, but none would be more accurate and encompassing than... "Man you sure do your own thing. And do it well."
The same way eminem has stans, polyphia fans are now known as polywogs. Take that, spread it round.
That tone tho..
I really like the thall mixed in with the original style they had
That time polyphia turned djent
this is the closest to metal theyve made in a long time, im not that into metal but im all here for this one, i love the "grungy" parts so much
I love
Love everything in this video! ❤️
What instrument does Lil West play??
W
Great drummer!
Guitar innovative. Rapping generic.
Damn this shit hits hard!
This song makes me emotional. Idk why or what it is about it, I’m still trying to figure that out. But something about this song makes me emotional. Idk
Latin Djent
It keeps getting better after every listening, damn.
This song is SICK! Plz pursue this style. (not always rap, the song just had a nice vibe.
This is disgusting 😤
Introtune for a horror/ survival game 😂
Hello I'm new and finally I'm not late. Usually I find good stuff three to six years later but I'm here now and enjoying this amazing piece of work. So happy to be alive to see this!
Close but still a miss for me.
I hope you guys go back to straight instrumentals.
why these trapper sing all in the same way?
eww why the auto tune guy
damn
Confirmed! Polyphia sold their souls for God Tier Virtuosity!  You guys are the ish.
Not a fan of the rap shit personally but to each their own.  Awesome music as always though.  Peace.
This looks like a satanic video
This hits as hard a wet noodle for me, I don't get it as it is s technically brilliant. Best part is the trapper tbh.
This is song is underrated.
Wtf is that scott doing? It's a motherfuckin killer
Definitely need more rap in your music it fits so well. That ending I probably played 1000 times
Calling demon's... To darkness
i wanna see a sleepy hallow and polyphia collab
if it wasn't for big people like metal heads of youtube pushing these artists and giving them fake view counters and such no one would even herd of or cared of polyphia.
I'm not saying they can't do both I'm saying they rather be a showoff artist than to barely reach actual legend status.
Polyphia play with speedy technique and skill rather than Emotion and feel.
they are okay I mean Steve Vai is still better in my opinion than Polyphia.
This goes kinda ridiculously hard.
I love music video rock
Nossa,como estés caras estam famosos.nunca tinha os visto. Muito bom 👍.     Me pareceu um novo conceito de música. 😲
This is the TRUTH 💯
Polyphia for Bleach TYBW ?
THIS SONG IS INCREDIBLE DAMN 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I like this band....but every song sounds like the last one. Can you get a singer and kinda change it up? And not some rapper please!
🤨
What genre is this? Asking for a friend
You guys should have a singer, maybe one of you, I can hear the melody already or feature a different singer each song or album or maybe an AI
Travis that you … oh nah
JID, Denzel, or even Kendrick will be rapping a verse in a Polyphia soon, I just know it
I love how this chimera 3D vision is inspired by William Blake's "The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in Sun"
Hope it was worth it! If you know, you know.
me doing the side to side head thrusts before seeing Tim doing it.
The audio quality of West's vocals are super underrated - recorded/mixed/treated so damn well. The chill delivery works perfectly with the part
Got cheese, buy a pair of shoes
We seriously need more of this
This shit slaps yo mama !!!
Omg
👍🤘keren abis
Did they go to the nearest high school and ask for the least talented rapper? He's so incredibly unskilled and low effort it's like borderline dadaism compared to how transcendent their playing is. I hate it.
This on paper would have looked weird, reality this one of the dopest songs I’ve heard for a while.
i hate all these crappy rappers now. theyre all kanye pest to me now. rap can die
https://youtu.be/FRTvCUVeiMo to hear the guitars better.
Remember That You Will Die has been my favorite album of this year. Followed by Motomami in hot second. If they were to collaborate with Rosalía’s vocals it would be the song of the decade.
if more Lil rappers and radio artists carried on Piggie-backing fame like Lil West is here.. maybe there'd be better music on the radio xD  edit: lmao like how Post Malone's fans, think that Malone made Ozzy famous LOL
I keep trying to like this band but I can't, ugh. Insanely overrated! Can't stand the way that girly guy plays, he never really adds to the song, he tries to go above it. It's just not good.
So much talent in one band almost unheard of
Synthesizing an 808 with an actual kick and bass and playing metal riffs over it??? That’s was fucking dope bro
they keep getting better and better, i'm scared
I don't even know how to describe this orgasm for my ears and my face all at the same time but it just makes me feel like I want to turn into a Super Saiyan
yngwie...are you watching ?
I love this song! Bloodbath too with Chino. Nobody can touch this band right now! As soon as somebody gets close, they go in the studio and come out with a track like this one. Dope dope dope dope dope!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Well it was good until the auto tuned “singing” kicked in.
Lyrics killed the mood for me on this one xD
i like the part.....mew,,,,mew,,,wooww....woow.....,this so tight😁
That was badass
Well that was completely awesome
Kid laroi or like powfu would be a fun collaboration.
Seems pretty demonic for a Christian band. Now someone go "Okay Boomer." But seriously fucks, Scott's blinged out nose mask is comedy GOLD...enberger.
cool
One has to listen this with some quality headphones! It is incredible!
some of their best riffs ever on this song
That opening riff was so beefy 🥩
best 8 string riff ive ever heard
Alright till the bullshit rapper dressed as a devil 🙄😂🤡
The Guy with the long hair is actually by far the better player....
Polyphia now seems like animals as leaders 🔥
need a featuring with lil durk
I love your music so much Polyphia. I don't know how to explain it but it has helped me have a calm, relaxed and clear mind.
We finally answered who's hand is on The Most Hated EP
I like how polyphia stands in this song as the main figure, and the rapping from lil west is as how one places vinegar in food. It's just enough to give it that contrasting taste  This was very well played
Dang this is so dope I’m obsessed and probably being weird banging my head in the library while revising for midterms BUT IDC DAMN MASTERPIECE I SAID MASTERPIECE
What kind of garbage trash 😂😂😂
Clay Gober with a beard is kinda… intimidating.. lmao
This song so lit, that my sleep paralysis demon  wakes me up at 3 am to jam to this banger!!
Polyphia
THIS IS FIRE 🔥  Next up, Polyphia feat. 100 gecs, PLZ  plz PLEAASE id cum and die simultaneously
Could we have a version... without the rapper????
Could have done without the shit rap but this song is amazing
Impostor 0:38
Lame
Good girl in a costume It's your world when I'm with you Forever with you like a tattoo I paint a picture in a bad mood Shoot through the breeze like a parachute I got a cheese, get a pair of shoes Big body, need a lot a room She keep callin' when I'm never home  I'll be what you need low-key on the east I can see everything that you went through I'll be your tool, I can fix you Even if I lose, it'd be nothing new She old news to the whole school It's my rules when I make moves I make it rain like a monsoon My new date, can you come soon?  The best high was the best rise She said that she really wanna come out to the west side If she comin' with me, she can hit me with her best side She can be my Mrs, give me kisses on our bedside Low-key, when we in the like You want me but it's never right Hold me, I'm a low life You know me 'cause I'm on the rise
Polyphia, you're changing the meta of how guitars are played. About time someone did🗿
Any Rappers not hopping on this style are going to be Trapped in 2008. Polyphia is making that change in multiple music styles that no one else is doing at the moment. "Nu-Metal 2.0" or Prog-Rock 2.0. Its definitely gaining popularity.
Сост играть надо на хомаге а свое говно выбросите
Best collaboration ever. Respect!
headache
Love this band. But that rap part just ain’t for me. Didn’t dig it at all. Rest of the song was great.
Did Polyphia fix nü-metal?
Had me up too that rap garbage. Sorry I'll just check out your instrumental stuff.
chimera, a hybrid creature for a hybrid song. i see what they did there
This one is a story about me and a girl I loved. Or at least that is something I enjoy thinking
Love this. They have an Yngwei Malmstien latiny vibe. Then the heavy hit..very nice
This is God-level playing. Truly, absolutely UNBELIEVABLE
tim’s guitar looks alien 😮
Mfer turned into a Klingon 😂
The guitar riffs are HUGE, but damn, why this featuring.... poor lyrics, terrible flow..
🔥🔥🔥
Were these lyrics written by a 10 year old?
The beat drop with the rapping. Crazy. Best song of the album imo
I like this version best, perfectly zeroed on every lick and corner... but I do miss the flirting...
This kills! Next level shit! 😱
Ótimo som para game de guerra!
@Polyphia - Check this out: https://youtu.be/StDEhnY6HYc
It's such an earworm; I can't get it out of my head!
what i would do to hear this for the first time again
William Blake  'Red Dragon'

PURFCET SARCASIM!!! I DIG YOU VIBE SO FAR. I UNDERSTAND HOW IGNORANT OUR SO CALLED FRIENDS ARE,I HAVE TO SOMETIME, we have to put on clokeish layerz just to be hsppy around one another becaide ee wsnt to nony who can ot nog
the contrast between classical guitar and 8 strings is just awesome
Classical progression right into dirty groove metal.  Great job yall.  Following in the footsteps of (look but dont touch) by keeping the vocals isolated at the end of the track is better in my opinion.🤘 P.S. KICK GOMER IN HIS SHIN WHEN HE ISNT EXPECTING IT 😉
Absolutely killer song; wish he'd shut the fuck up a lil, though.
Pretty decent track ruined by shitty rap, what a shame
They couldn’t have found a rapper that wasn’t rapping about the same tired sh*t? This song was epic. It didn’t need someone talking about money and shoes.
This is the most creative piece of music I heared from 2022
3:35 Scott is wearing a metal nose prosthetic😂 😂😂
Too talented
Does anyone know musical influences of these riffs? It reminds me some flamenco/tango/thall mash-up 😀
<3
How  does this only have 1.1 mil views......
Wow amazing....👍👍👏👏👏
Hey guys, been a big fan since Transcend ⚧ and absolutely love all the new features and collaborations with the great artists of all genres, respect. All the new grooves yall come up with are as immaculate as a bow tie, yall always make it rain like a monsoon 🌪 🐙
Se e loko, muito bom, top do Brasil.
The creatur in clips like evil... so scary...😱
If u wanted a rapper you shoulda got tech n9ne. Big metal and alternative fan. He been repping for that while genre for 20 years. Absolute legend.
When you go so far into the future that you kinda go back to flamenco
ficou do caralho 🤟🏾
why rap tho? rap is breathing?
no one is talking about how good the guitars are during the rap verse, especially starting at around 3:11. shame they aren't just a bit louder, I'm addicted to those leads.
Rigatoni
I think this is a creative new genre but I really dont like autotune and its gives a suffocating feeling . Not enjoyable .
The guys singing here is such a drab boring verse. I hope polyphia find better singers to partner with in the future. Thus verse was so unoriginal and boring 😴
this song is so fucking sick
This song is so badass.  Got the mexican vibes to start then the hardcore soul rockin rock lines.  That electric oboe just rips too.
At first, the haunting latin melody alternates with the brutal riff, then they fuse into a Chimera? 🤔
Oh god... After listening to this masterpiece for the 5th time in a row, I realised i was searching for an analysis on the Chimera Ant Arc ....
Hey Polyphia, big fan of the music. If ever you're looking  for a music festival to join and play with a great crowd, I suggest looking into the FEQ (Festival d'été de Québec). Quebec is the capital of the Province of Quebec, CA and we love rock, prog, and punk music. Crowds vary between 20k to 120k ppl, it's during the summer on a beautiful stage outside and I would love to see you guys there. If that isn't a possibility or you guys don't want to go, no problem with that. It would raise another question though, would you ever consider playing in Canada?
Yall don't make enough merch lol.
I'm down if the apocalypse is lit like this. Rapping demons n shit
insaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaane
This was awesome. Thank you.
Are these guys like the Ed Sheeren of bands who can play any style and collaborate and adapt with anyone?
1:59 bro that tapping part is so good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StDEhnY6HYc one guitar G.O.A.T cover
The first 2 minutes of this song is absolutely 🔥. Please keep giving us more content like this!
polyphia W
I literally need a daily dose of this song
Their current guitars can be friends with Jonathan Davis' mic stand.
yo
Bach ? Paço de Lúcia? E essa distorção? Belos riffs! Mas o que é isso tudo ? Que bateria é essa ? Fiquei bugado principalmente depois do êxtase inicial, o vocal ...sei lá...rap? Hip hop ? A obra ficou totalmente soberba sem qualquer rótulo....que som mais enigmaticamente delicioso......
MARILYN MANSON VIBES! 🔥🤘🏼🔥
SO, CHRIS HERIA HAS A BAND NOW.
Best rap & metal track of 2022.
Bro, when are u guys coming to Portugal? I'll get u some good food if u come (trust me, we have sum great cuisine)
intro classical,, djent riff.. r&b drum style.,, hip hop in the middle.. wawwwww... your GOAT., fucking amazing
As time passes this song is establishing itself as the best on the album
Wow
Epic music
Epic
Wow, just WOW, Polyphia is top tier music.
Man if only destiny could bring Polyphia and Mick gordon together for a banger collab, I can then die in peace.
I get a LOT of King Crimson vibes from these dudes... I dig it!
Their music is not my thing, but I’m really glad to see what they’re doing. It’s a refresh for guitar scene. It took me years to understand Hendrix greatness, and I think it will take me years to understand Tim Henson’s greatness as well.
Bagels are good, but this is great 👍
Not liking the sound of the drums 😬
Maybe in-between now and next album make a NLND v.2 with more added guests, I know I'd buy it!!! Promo baby
Taaao nao dhaon dhaon dhaonao dhao.... nao nao dhanao dhaon ... naonao na nao .. dhanao dhao...    On repeat.
Polyphia is like the Avatar the way the genre bend and control the elements.
i love this! 😊
you are right
Not a fan of the vocals boys, please go back to instrumentals.
Please do a track with Tech N9ne 🙏
If the rapping parts lived up to expectations, this would have been one of the top 10 guitar playing tracks in the history of music
Man, they got really advanced here. They made the guitars rap lyrics this time.
Song is incredible as always but whoever that rapper is at the end was sub par. They coulda chose someone much better
I love the fact this video doesn't glorify any one musician.
i love lil west drip. he is on fire.
Nice one 🔥🔥
Can we please appreciate how amazing scott is on that electric!🔥🤧
this song's really awesome
Esta gente es talento puro
Clay (drummer) has some of the most amazing fills EVER
Finally a black elf, its about damn time!
When are we getting a RTJ collab?
i ve killed this LiL west guy in wow
what a blend wow
Idk why but after hearing this I want a Lil Nas X collab
Как-то ни о чем, мелкая халтурка
Pause at 3:34 and you can see Scottie trolling his nose
That is such a sexy riff exchange back and forth between the distortion 8 string and nylon 6 string.
🎸 Sounds ☣️ Definitely 🎧
Will an instrumental of this song be released without the rap?
Love the lighting and grayscale choices. Night nostalgia feel. Beautifully matches the music.
I think this is the future of Trap Rock/Trap Metal 🤟🔥
This is hands down my favourite song off the new album and my favourite song from 2022 across all genres.  Scott’s bending djenty guitar parts contrast so beautifully with Tim’s intricate nylon string sections. And those gorgeous synths in the background add to the melodies perfectly.  But Lil West, holy fucking shit. As someone who never really got into the whole rap metal/nu metal thing back in the day, it’s so cool hearing Polyphia and Lil West combining elements of metal and hip hop in such a fresh way that doesn’t come across as corny, tacky, or obnoxious in the slightest. This is just straight fire, and their individual vibes work so damn well together. Lil West is honestly the most perfect choice of feature on this song. More people need to be talking about this sweet, sweet, unbridled excellency.
you're too good to listen to a producer less talented than you guys. I feel like you guys were painting the Sistine chapel and when you were about done the village idiot shit in his hand and wiped it across your masterpiece. That ego clown is lucky to stand on the shoulders of Masters.. there for a second was he talking about shoes? From Steve Vai to this guy
Where was Lil West during all of my life?   Please send him back there and don't let him come back
3:31 I have no religion anyway more but this moment I feel like to pray
Is there a version of this without Lil` anybody?
999k views. I may watch it on repeat until it hits a milli.
God darn Scott your guitar sounds like an animal
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this is the best way for polyphia to do features let tim and scott do their thing and then the features has a verse
Just being picky but I wish the drum clips lined up better with the audio.
Gerudo valley vibes. Yes
This is a piece of heaven on my ears! Love the opening riff, insane! Countless repeat. This album is just above my expectation n greed, also collaborate with more artists, so satisfying!
the more I listen to Polyphia, the more I listen to Polyphia
this song is horrible, you guys got pretty satanic. Not cool
mmm dat BASS
What an interesting and original concept! And boy how great it works... It is genius to combine the deep voice of Lil West with the Swedish death metalesque riffs and rhythm. I for one want more. And that outro is great.
First listen : why do they need a vocal?  10th listen : hmm the vocal is fine 20th listen : I need more vocal!!!  It’s not that the rap part itself is great, but all of them together sound just so fucking 🔥🔥🔥
BOM PRA CARALHOOOOOOOOOOO
"I got cheese get a pair of shoes" sounds like a toejam problem
Dude the baphomet imagery, they've sold there souls.. .but damn, Scott needs a bigger creative lead in this band. Fuck this Tim Henson eye liner shit.
Poor lyrics
Yup, that's a peak for sure.
That riffing though
I have been listening to you guys since your first album and this album kinda makes all the other albums feel a bit outdated.  Not that I don't love them, but this one is on a whole new level.
Simply Majestic Love you guys 🥺❤️
My favourite song off the album, each part is perfect! feel like its underrated
Can someone tell me the entity that seems to come to life there towards the end? The visuals here are bananas.
🧩✊🍁🍂 Grrrraahhh!!! All the vibrations  in the air, sure enough it's there.
The first true rap over rock n roll song
Get this band on SNL
This is amazing BUT I feel without the rapper or someone better, would have made this far better. Great song though.
would be better without the rapper.
Their best track imo
Def hearing some THALL influence here
Hi , How can I pay by PayPal ?  I tried couple times but it still not work , Any Service support ?😂😅
waw it's amazing ... i like
That main riff was too good to waste the rest of the song with that weak rap part IMO
THE GOAT.
Scott LePage riff is mesmerising, eargasm 🎸🎸🎸😘😘😘😘
Polyphia is the shittiest band in the universe it is literally the opposite of Saetia
I love everything about this track, its soooooo good.  I just ignore the vocals (so, maybe not "everything")
You have no idea how talented this guy's are , it's insane . I need them to keep paying more then ever, and I have discovered them just a few days ago, Keep going please
Jezz, this is fucking awesome
Guys go back to the plain instrumental. Auto tuned rap is stupid.
I just went from commenting polyphia are the drake's of modern prog to hearing this song. Holy shit, Scotts a mother fucker. More of this , por favor.
Not a big fan of hiphop or rap but wow somehow that worked.
@ㅇ@ ♤
Amazing. All good. Drumming superb, guitar great, Base superb, Overall it holds amazingly well :) All the best. Super. Oh the Rap with lyrics about shoes etc. ruined it all. I wish my  African American Rappers brothers move ahead from the material and move towards the ethereal which Polyphia is about. Lil west and the whole American Rap Scene. Move away from material and towards the ethereal. Just saying. You KNow ! If you are going to add words to music, the stakes better be high. We all are battling daily and its not about tattoos and shoes.
Scott u the man on this one
I've tried & I just don't get it at all, it comes across as Babymetal, Ghost, Ramstein & I never understood any of the hype around them either. I mean an actual vocalist would be a good start as this just sounds like someone making a beat on some cheap phone software, it hurts.
Chimera ants? MERUEM SAMA???
This song is great right up until the rap starts
Scottie is a hottie. I'm glad he keeps his metal roots
This is for sure the best song on the new album. It just hits on so many levels and so many genres. Brings the heavy, the hip hop at the end, got dang it's good.
I'll take that instrumental please 😅
Man, Scottie is playing fcking THALL. Dang.
Please collaborate with Travis Barker, it will be awesome
The shredding guitars are one hell of a thing for sure, but that MASSIVE Bass and its presence in the mix take this song to an upper level for me, alongisde the godly drums, very rhytmical
I remember seeing Lil West in a nothing, nowhere. track and now he’s with Polyphia. Amazing.
Chimera in this video look like The Great Red Dragon painting
🤖🌞🔥yo that's crazy...!!! I love Lil West!!🔥🌞🤖
Scottie ain't playin'
Tim Henson 😫
These mf'ers are monsters.
Eminem needs to get on some of these
this was just amazing
This song makes this my new fav album all together-
good song so far...
Good girl in a costume It's your world when I'm with you Forever with you like a tattoo I paint a picture in a bad mood Shoot through the breeze like a parachute I got cheese, get a pair of shoes Big body, need a lot of room She keep callin' when I'm never home I'll be what you need, lowkey On the east, I can see everything that you went through I'll be your tool, I can fix you Even if I lose, it'd be nothing new She old news and I'm old school It's my rules when I make moves I make it rain like a monsoon My new bae, can you come soon? The best high was the best ride She said that she really wanna come out to the west side If she comin' with me she can hit me with her best side She can be my missus, give me kisses on our bedside Lowkey when we in the night You want me, bet it's movin' right Hold me, I'm a lil' vibe You know me, 'cause I'm on the rise
Waittt isn't that Frederick's signature Scott's using ?!!?!?!?
I always listen..and I like it...
I want the instrumental
3:34 took me ages to realize Scott got one of those weird metal things specifically for his nose lmao
"I make it rain like a monsoon"  Perfect timing
mannnnnn this is so fire
Yo I'm just so baffled by the red dragon inspired artwork in background
2:35
cool
Future music start from polyphia
I remember singing this in the car all the time
I've waited until I've heard enough of these guys to comment, and I'm now convinced.  AMAZING talent and technique.  That is the ONLY difference between these guys and Nickelback.  They are the guitarists version of Nickelback.  It's the same rhythms, the same concepts.  Over and over and over.
I drop this comment just for the melody line in 01:59 and Scott's titanium nose mask in 03:33.... Thanks!
that autotune singers is the only thing I dislike of the album, a really bad choice, there are more talented and original singers than this poor vocals
Scottie's nose bling is still pure gold
My favorite song from lombok indonesia 🇲🇨
OMG what a great fucking song!! This and Chino Moreno's 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1 million, congratulation gentlemen.
Please more of these down tuned heavy tunes, it would be sick live
mrithunjoy
Ive been waiting for a proper metal/rap combo to scratch that itch. consider me itched.
Dang.
Love it when I decide to check out one of my favorite bands after not keeping up for a while and find new music by them.
🤘🏽💪🏽🙌🏽
Polyphia ft. Drake would be sick.
sweet
they make music that is me as a song and i love it so much !!
The visual message of this is mixing iron & clay & the evil that ensues with the will for eternal life on this planet by becoming trans human. All very talented musicians I can say that with certainty & that means a lot as ima musician of many talents with no name or fame so my opinion is very important. I’m sure you can all see the importance of my opinion on the music & imagery produced. I do strictly mean the music as the vocals had very little impact on if the song would be great or not.
Clay is just a madman on those drums. Such tight intervals for those fills and he just hits the damn mark with every strike.
Give rap song 😆😆
Nice
1M subs! Congrats guys
Jesus, I had to wipe melted skin off my face and tears outta my eyes
Господи, здесь есть всё: музыка для меломанов-ценителей прог-рока, слащавые мальчики в модных одеждах, от которых писают кипятком девочки и читающие рэп афро-американс! Вот она, ребята, формула успеха!
a BAND SO FAR UP THEIR OWN ASS
Wow!!!
Yeah steve vai and yngwie should have feature r&b or rapper for modern sake with mass sampler loop .
Oh, and metalcore has grown branches. Nu-Metalcore, Alt Metalcore, Pop Metalcore maybe even Djent Metalcore. But there's def something new going on lately that isn't full on metalcore! I love it all though, man! Rock, metal, hardcore, punk is a tree we share to me, and I can jam to just about anything so.....!
I feel like these guys and even the metalcore gone alt rock guys are doing something or can do something real game changing here. Like bringing real rock and metal back to the radio and really experimenting with softer pop, rock, nu, sounds. This might be an onset into something that changes mainstream variety, man.   Instead of lab hat fills, it's real ones, instead of software coded beats, it's real guitar and bass. Different talent(sound engineering is def a talent, not saying it isnt). I think this fusion could easily fit in post modern radio, man, and I'm psyched!   PS- still love my heavy tho, don't be afraid to scream at me lol
SO  SHWEEEETTT...much  love  Tee with  LIONS  NAMED LEO.[the music  worldwide} AND  SOOOOOOO  cool....LOVE  YOU  ALL.!!!!!
HAPPY 1 MILLION
Am I the only person who gave this a thumb down?
1 million subs inc
The best song from this album after playing god of course
lil west sounded good on this.. they meshed together well.
I prefer Big East over Little West, but that's just me.    oh, and rap sucks.
what the lil west stuff should've been the whole song
Number 1,000,000 sub. Cheers
1M GO GO GO
The best <3
Great song totally ruined by auto-tune, shit rap and garbage bars.
id love to hear a TECHnical RAPPER. you guys are so perfect technical it would be amazing if you had a rapper like that on a beat.
shit just slaps some times maKES U wanna cry
I wish for more of Lil West on this song. The blend of modern rap and metal I would never thought I needed.
this rocks
Cooooooool!
clay is literally a human trap drum machine
Lil West lookin like the first rappin elf I done ever seen..
Only song where rapper comes in around the 3 min mark..
It's all fyre
This fuckin band rocks mf socks across the damn globe. That guitar coming in heavy and then Tim with the light .. muah Perfecto bulisimo
Ауе
ROAD TO 1M Subs - YAYYYYYYYYYYYy les goooo
It was a fantastic jammy, chunky groove until the stupid vocals started...
Polyphia is addicting like drugs guys , approach it carefully😁
Vocal destroyed this good music
I want those 1 million subscribers !!☝
This is chimera in hunterxhunter feel like ❤
Кайф
Wow this is amazing il loved it
🔥🔥
Lyrics: Good girl in a costume It’s your world when I’m witchoo Forever witchoo like a tattoo I paint a picture in a bad mood She feel the breeze like a parachute  I got cheese, get a pair of shoes Big body need alotta room She keep callin’ when I’m never home Ill be watchoo need low key On your ends i can see everything that you went through-oooo Ill be your tool i can fix you-oooo Even If I lose itll be nothing new-oooo She call news that im old school? It’s my rules when i make moves? I make it rain like a monsoon My new deck it’ll come soo-hoooon? Last night was the best ride since when i came out to the west side? If she coming wit me she can hit me with her back side She can be my misses gimme kisses on my bed side? Low key we’ll be getting high-eye(high) You wanna leave but there’s no more rye-hide(ride) Hold me I’m a low life???? No need cause I’m gonna rise
Love that. Would love to see more of that style.
we all need a drum play-through pleaseeee
Please collab with lorna shore next
🤟❤️❤️❤️❤️🤟
Bravo! 👏  This will always beat that pure screaming nonsense vocals! 😱🚫
ESQUISOFRENICO...muita informação e nenhuma mensagem, não agrega valor. Músicos tecnicistas de um nível até alto mas que não fazem arte, anos luz de fazer algo que inspire. Precisam "sofrer" muito para poder entender o que é sentimento, igual o ET do Jacob Collier.
🔥
Baddies.
ギターの流れる演奏、最高にカッコいい！
"Коробейники" в интерпретации Polyphia 🔥
What a backbone the drummer brings, the guy is insane.
BEAUTIFUL.....ROCKIN.
The sales of 8 strings about to skyrocket😂
Damn this is history in the making already made
This is fantastic I love.
Я  в восторге ! )
Scottie just keep killin it.
Rick Rubin’s dream
This song is way too short I need more.
content kings
Scottie on THALL mode.
Ez igen!👏😁🤘🍺🍺🍺🍺🥃🥃🇭🇺🇸🇰
2:36 I'm outta here............
Find a better rapper so as to not cheapen the amazing music. It’s like polishing a classic car with a turd.
I will try to play after I am done with University exam
How much for Scottie's nose piece?
I'm conflicted about this track.   Instrumentally it's solid, and they're testing creative boundaries by mixing genres.  It's a flex, and I'm here for it - but I don't know if there is a rapper alive that could be featured that contributes the same level of talent and audible skill to affect the music without bringing down the quality.  And I'm not saying rap/rock can't work - some bands have done it well; but Polyphia is beyond what most rock/metal bands can do, and I don't know that a counterpart exists at the same level in the rap genre.  It really feels like a bumper sticker on a Lamborghini scenario...
Bass player could be so much more, so basic and a pic meh
😍😍😘😘😍😘😍😘
it isnt bad instrumentally but i fuckin hate this junk oh now i hear the vocals god damn that sucks
Emo rap
Modern Stuff 🔥
Why Scottie dont use mask?  Scottie: 👃👌  Greetings from Argentina
Oh wao
This is giving me Posty vibes and now I really really REALLY want them to collab w Posty!
i hear similarities
and of course more satanic signs. omg its so cheap, what the music industry do here now. and in the end jesus will judge them all. never sell your soul to evil for success.
This is my favorite track off the new album so far
Red dragón ?
Cant stop shaking my head in dismay. I cant believe this much talent can sound so fucking horrible
They kinda djent here
lil West would do good with no auto tune. once he went high pitch in his voice it was like any other "rapper"
0:38 Among Us (Role Reveal) Reverence
I fucking love this song because it has a similar feel to TLC "No Scrubs" 🔥🔥🔥
been 8 years still dreaming of another Rick Graham collab with you guys.
Lil west and polyphia!?! Unreal!!
Clay on drums is really that icing on the cake that's also layered multiple times inside
Clay's part in 1:40 oh my!!!
There a version without vocals?
west wasn't essential, the track was good without him...
Great song but I feel the rap comes in too late, need more verses, but what do I know. Entire album = stellar
Your all fawns never daring to ask where it comes from.
Absolute🔥
Damn good!!!.hope i can see my comment 10years from now
@polyphia do you have a telegram?
Oh we goin Los Maridjento
I wish i could like this a thousand times
Let’s gooooooo
Denzel Curry would have killed this.
Seems like just yesterday you guys were only kids dressed up in suits playing champagne, now look at you. So amazing the way your music and styles have evolved over the years. Keep getting better guys! I'll never stop listening!
Crazy like a Flippergame
song is better without the west the dude
Why are these rappers so damn little
damn son
Metal, Flamenco, and Hip Hop in one song?!?🤯
is it only me but this sounds like a trap metal song.
THIS IS THE FUTURE MILLENNIALS WANT
What kind of guitars are those? Probably custom
Espectacular!!! Además me encanta esa guitarra de cuerdas de nylon Yeah!!!
Sorry, but is there a version without Lil West?
Anyone else think they are stuck in 2x playback mode when Polyphia songs start?
THALL
По моему набор звуков .
As more and more artist get with Polyphia, the rapping techniques will have a whole new face on a whole new level! Thank you for not being underground and staying above ground! ❤
I guess I have to give up on Polyphia at this point. Just not my kind of music anymore. But hopefully it can be a gateway band to get Mainstream audiences interested in handmade music again. Especially in the day and age of 08/15 Trap garbage being at the forefront of popular music. I guess this is what selling out is these days, but still interesting genre blend musically and creatively, just not my cup of tea. :-D
At first I thought it was gonna be a polyphia and chimera collab.....that would be interesting! But I'm diggin this. Love everything y'all put out ❤️
Polyphia + autotune...
I like it, but people are going to hate so hard.
The mask are F disgusting, and looks like you guys got a demon you're serving at the center.. You guys are in trouble... Good luck with that. Unfollow.
Trying to be original is so hard to accomplish, after all there are only so many cord,s and scales to work with, and the band has done just that and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.🎸😎. Rock on guys 💪.
Masks?  Adoctrination(?) Love the song AND the generes
For a second I thought this was a collab WITH chimera
Why ruin a great song with a stupid rapper??
that diabolic eary outro took it to the next level esp the part where we see the chimera about to turn its head
I don‘t Know
Ima need Polyphia and Post Malone pls
need to hear it twice to understand the greatness of this song, damn my ear's failing me.  and that flamenco is a  nice prelude man.
waiting feat mateus asato
More rap collabs, less Spanish classical guitar plz 🙏🏼
the first part is just insane, I hope you can create an entire music in that rhythm!
I can confidently say this is my favorite polyphia song
IMHO - the poetry does absolutely nothing for the musicality of this track.
Joji collab when
The song is amazing, im not a big fan of lyrics myself, but the song is great
Not sure about this fusion of metal and Balenciaga…
I think we can ALL agree this was worth the wait
Everything was great until Lil west....auto-tune should never replace a voice. Learn to sing or don't.
Poly n rap is god tier
this albums sucks
Good song until the rapper came in.  Rap isn't music, and this guy was just dogshit.
8 strings guitar!
Arte, belleza, perfección, sonidos celestiales.
Amazing 🔥🔥
Stop using FACE DIAPERS!
Not a fan of the imagery here
Wow this extra heavy distortion sounds amazing on this track. This is so good, as usual. There's something weird about the recording though. When I listen on my computer I can hear a guy's voice start around 2:30. He's talking about cheesy Tinder pickup lines.
Wonder what this would sound like in a vehicle with good set of 6×9s and set of subs.
anybody have any idea if clay (gober) used a synth plugin on this track? or maybe the archetype rabea plugin from neural? i know it has a synth in it. i suck at creating the beat elements when i'm working on a track that needs it and would love it if there was a way to just use my bass for tracking 808's.

Drummer 👍👍👍
Make this a song! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7HuR6pmX1c&ab_channel=EverythingPolyphia
So this is the crap people like now?
The power of genre-blending has been detected. 🙂
its no surprise the least talented artist in this video is a black dude
Can I get a Post Malone Polyphia song
epic style
Was digging it until Lil penis stepped in. Ruined the entire song Tim. Leave that shit at the door.
PLEASE- NO RAP, HIP-HOP, ETC. Don't F*** UP a good thing!!   Though I'm an average musician, I can do with words ( NOT rap),  what you do with harmony and melody. ERGO, I'm gonna steal from Ur muzik, morph it, and use it.  GENTLEMAN' "Don't go Gentle into that Good Night..." Dylan Thomas.  Oh... I VEHENTLY APOLOGIZE for thinking the young gentleman (who's playing the classical/ flamenco part on the electric guitar 🎸 ), was female. I've already scheduled an appt. with my optometrist and get prescribed a new pair of "COKE BOTTLE BOTTOMS."
Here I am, misreading the Title as „featuring Lil Wayne“.   Got me so excited as well…
All these songs with lyrics are... ehhh
This has to be one of the greatest Polyphia songs of all time
Turns out rap and 8 string guitars do go well together
Perfect 😼😍
Apenas la primera canción que escucho de ellos y estoy completamente ENAMORADA
Holy..
Este si que es un verdadero temario, temazo jajaja 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥
wtf is that thing projecting sounds with mouth?! kill it with fire! burn the house down just to be sure..
A rapper with no musical talent shouldn't hang with a group of phenomenal musicians.
overpowered 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this one going for the books!!
The video is killer 🤘🏻
How do I ruin a great track? Let's put some kid talking like a toddler at the end of it, and throw some autotune in there
This sounds sick. Like trap prog. Really cool.
Wtf is happening? Every album you guys drop gives me a new favorite song. I dunno what it is but I wanna burn some toast n eat the walls. This shit is amazing.

Muito bom piazada, show de bola  Vou por no carro quando for viajar.
That Lil West bit at the end goes so fucking hard
Edward?
Getting Great Red Dragon vibes from the visual
I'm going to have step out on these types of tracks. Good music though
so fantasy
You guys gotta try harder to compete with Frosted Bits. Crank it to 11 and soak it all in...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu4BsOJ_5g&t=152s
Lil West ruins it for me.... would have been better to have a guitar solo in his place.
Polyphia needs more vocalsssss
Amazing ... then he spoke... Really think in this case the lyrics take away from the music. Song had a totally different vibe... still amazing
Don't see what difference Lil West makes. With all those autotune modifications any half decent rapper could have done it.
And with this, I have failed No Nut November
Man these guys are awesome so glad I just found them. Most other bands don't know how to play different notes but not these guys they play different notes on every song. Kind of remind me my other favorite for person band The Beatles never heard of them I think not. They also know how to play songs with different notes.
Lo de bozal no lo entiendo?en fin🤦🏻‍♂️ Por otra parte vaya técnica de Tim😮👏👏👏
Whoa -- Scottie goes full-on Darth Vader in this one. Love it.
Pretentious bollocks...
Drums are way too loud imo
Excellent !
What's this shit?
The dead wait, but sell the lite to the hiest bidder. B si lent. U hath no power or' r the seeders.  #serentywaits
EPIC 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
👍🏽
bad colab, no meaning in it
the singing part sucks im skipping those
Wow 😍❤️ it’s amazing ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This synths araound 1:34 reminds me the music from Sol Sanctum from Golden Sun 1 lol
literally unlistenable
I N S A N E
Satanic Assholes! You‘ve done the thing with the Destiny 👿
If only this shit got the right vox..
Sounds alot like the santana riff used in wild thoughts
When you see musicians wearing a mask it means it's over. These guys have come to an end, the piece is then the umpteenth nuance of G.O.A.T. They ran out of ideas. R.I.P.
They couldn't find a good virtuoso rapper who stands out. Tons of under ground rappers who can keep up with them.
God tier song up until the shitty rap part
what am i going here
Spanish Djent
Damnn niceee🔥🔥🔥
You know they make good music when you disable your sound apps to make music vibe better. It was to much with the boost. They had us covered.
Collab with Tom Morello!!!
This new level of Polyphia is God tier
Was enjoying this right up to the point some rapper appeared ...
Straight dun dirty!!! worst part of this song is that it ends. ....can i have a looped into infinity version please? 🔥
Feature Post Malone into yo stuffs lads.
Istimewa.
I recall Tim saying that there were 2 MVs left in the prerelease stream. I really, sincerely, very much hope that it's Bloodbath
Not gunna lie, dream colab would be  Polyphia Pomegranate Tiger  Protest The Hero
This song became my favourite with "Neurotica".
Boom💣!!!🔥
Amazing!!!🤩 next do a country song
Such great guitar work and song writing, but the verse is trash. Needed a better hip hop artist
Randomly found about these guys from a random on FB. 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
Lyrics:  Good girl in a costume It's your world when I'm with you Forever with you like a tattoo I paint a picture in a bad mood Shoot through the breeze like a parachute I got cheese, get a pair of shoes Big body, need a lot of room She keep callin' when I'm never home I'll be what you need, lowkey On the east, I can see everything that you went through I'll be your tool, I can fix you Even if I lose, it'd be nothing new She old news and I'm old school It's my rules when I make moves I make it rain like a monsoon My new bae, can you come soon? The best high was the best ride She said that she really wanna come out to the west side If she comin' with me she can hit me with her best side She can be my missus, give me kisses on our bedside Lowkey when we in the night You want me, bet it's movin' right Hold me, I'm a lil' vibe You know me, 'cause I'm on the rise
This is the track chino and maynard should have been dropping vocals on! This shit is soo dark and sexy!...props to every member of this group!.... I get having this guy on here  right but he did not bring it or meet the opportunity!
HO-LY-SHIT
what a journey in my mind.  I love this band.  Plano, TX HELL YES>
are y'all gonna release an instrumental version of the album?
How is the rhythm section so solid when it’s made of clay
My favourite on the album. Glad we got a video to accompany it!
I find it quite difficult to grasp something out of it, a bit blurry to me, technically speaking it's amazing but musically speaking I'll pass.
This song and video are living in my head rent free
Idk wtf to even call this fusion smash-up, but I’m fucking here for it! 🤘
Alright Denzel Currry, I don't want, but I need you to collab with Polyphia lol
Glad to see the drummer still staying safe from the COVID.
This is just insane.
Why is everyone Lil? Lmao
<3
What guiatr is Scottie using holy shit
It's a regular riff revolt.  Is it weird to wish they could do a collab with Allan Holdsworth? (Of course they can't, he died... but I can wish.)
Great right up to the generic autotuned boredom.
I think these boys listened to a fair deal of THALL during this album.
just found them today and im obsesseddd!!
I wonder if anybody realizes what this is going to be in for the music industry
What's your favorite song from the new album, and why is it chimera?
Would love Chino singing over this track
Why do you guys have to make visualizations of demons 🤦‍♂️ disappointing
a very talented band with a guy singing thru auto tune and rapping.  should not be on the same stage.
Those djenty lows... fuck!
Ребята, вы безбашенные... И это круто... Делайте музыку дальше!
I want the instrumental version. Don't care for this lil west kid.
Need a better bass sound in this song.   The bass should be present.   The rapping sucks.   The guitar rifts , especially the non-Tim sounded the best
Imagine Polyphia (feat. Eminem) 🤔
the rapping is the weakest part of the track, ngl im glad its at the end, cuz the songs done when he starts rapping
CAN WE JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO APPRECIATE THEI MPECCABLE MIXING AND PRODUCTION ? WHAT IS THIS
i want the instrument ver
oooooh i get it, Lil West is the Chimera
Meh...
Never thought I'd hear autotune vocals on a Polyphia track.   I like it though.
These guys are just awesome 😁
Polyphia Djents again!
How to lose the metal fanbase: 101
why did Lil West not just rap on the whole thing?! why is half the song empty?? Lil West made this song decent, but his verse is not long enough......
Man that moment when you almost read "Lil wayne" instead of Lil West. You realised you getting old.  #Millennials #GenerationY #GenY #LilWayne
OMG
The riffing in this one is otherwordly..... Massive track-  by far the best song on this album for me !
Ok I Like this band since the beginning; so nice this kind of  "Fresh air" in guitar world scene (we can't call it Rock or Metal scene, It's a Guitar-world music) imho! But (again) the same chord and key throughout the entire song, no progression, and Always the exact same rhythmic figures of the other songs/(and now) albums: It's the same song repeated to infinity! Not a big deal, ok, lots of musical genres are like that... but I hope in the future to listen something more, that give justice to these talented guys! Last thing. From the start they tried to break the musical genere barrier,  appearing in a more "fluid" way, more inclusive (not totally inclusive because most of the time the elements are just electric guitars and trap rhythmics or  modern pop music), etc. Now Lil West... It's ok but, again imho, this whole thing starts to show its own limit and to feel uncomfortable / tedious to the listener.
The way the vocals drop... Oh my god. I legitimately can't say this enough. Your music sends chills up and down my spine. It's sonic ecstacy... Ouf. Another banger
Absolute bengjer
We are witnessing greatness. They will be in the history books forever, legends.
Kereeen 👍
nice song
Although i’m not a fan of rap music I’m glad they put some vocals on one of their tracks. They’re pretty good musicians and made some awesome music but i have to admit they sound boring to me (feels like i’m listening on the same track on every song). Being technically good wouldn’t always give you the following you long for. Sorry but it’s just me but I’m happy for them that more people are appreciating their music. Hope they continue to grow widen their fan base. Cheers!
Scott is on fire in the whole album. I loved that.
Sounds awesome 😎

Polyphia ft. Buckethead
You guys Rock! Any chance your songs would show up on RockSmith?
They should do a collab with Chimera and name the song "Lil West"
vocals poo poo
Obviously the instrumental was a banger but man do I hate when they let people sing on them. I just prefer to have the instruments do the singing.
Scottie's nose mask 🤣
I want to see Davie504 reaction so bad
My favorite track on the album. Glad they made a video for this.
thall
The perfect matrimony between hip hop 808s and gent and metal guys are fantastic
really dont care for this djent stuff. Let that badass bass tone handle the low end!
Is it just me or did I just see a member of Korn?
Great music. But the rap part is not what you need
What a tune 🤔
Disappointing blend of random shredding, rehashed flamenco & late coming trash autotuned vocals without intent. Won't move crowds in a stadium... Polyphia might be trying to do everything metal pop rap, but this song succeeds in none of those genres. Don't make patchwork music Polyphia, make music with soul and intent, convey a message, get a groove going together as a band !
This is actually sick
These men have incredible hair
that kind of songs could be 15 minutes long
WTF?....take a killer track and lay some autotune on the last half a minute........😖🇭🇲
Hey guys, love the track!  I'm just curious about something.  Luke Holland just posted another vid and I'm just wondering why he's not in the song credits?  I have my own suspicions, but just wondering if you guys might share what happened.  Thanks for your music!
Can i say this a the best song
Ta aí, algo inovador.
yeah
People we are living in the guitar renaissance.
👎👎👎 Flying Music unrecognizable Melodie’s 🤮🤮🤮 I don’t like this kind of music
I TOTALLY SUGGEST WE COLLABORATE TIM HENSON! 🙏 YOU GUY'S WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED BUT MORE THEN INTRIGUED! 🤣
quite an enjoyable song till the lyrics begin
u guys r way better without any vocalist
Great! But I want this with a natural drumsound :(
It's the worst fusion of styles I've ever heard. I'm sorry guys, I adore you, I love the way you play, but... I hope you accept criticism. Greetings
I liked it until 2:36
Lil West ruined it
Aww... I'mma fellin like i would litrally fly fcking high while listing to this masterpiece🗿💖
fire
Perfect
Maybe they will get good enough to do a ft. Little Wayne.  It would do wonders to learn from the master.
So goooooood
bro scottie's entry was dopeeee
Nice trap flamenco but not sure what the rap adds.
Apart from the silly covid masks, that was awesome! 👌
Polyphia can make every style it will still be amazing. The sound at the end is amazing, I would have loved you used it as an interlude, and big sound after that.
An Autotune rapper on Polyphia is like ketchup on ice cream
So intense, amazing job guys.
Why fuck the song up with the Martian dude.
This is fire ❤❤❤❤❤
Where's the love for how sick the drums luke holland wrote for this song are? Shits fire.
Chimaira or impression
I turned off, when heard another Lil... I like hip-hop beats, trip-hop genre, but modern rap...with auto-tune - it's lame!
thall
Lil West ruins it
Good track but the mumble crap ruined it for me. I hope they release an instrumental version.
I thought it was Lil Wayne. It was just his cousin, Lil West.
Polyphia= epic Lil west= Dobby the elf
Didn’t think anything could ruin a Polyphia song, but having someone with “Lil” in their name is certainly a valiant effort hahah.  Is there a version of this song without that garbage?
The cheesy mainstream “singing” fucking ruined the song. Rap and hip hop so annoying
This is like LBDT 2.0 I love the Español hook but the heavy guitar parts Tim got composing catchy hooks going on. This is a good vocal collab I like the Chino song too good sounds for the group go polyphia go
Arrangement become awful in 2:35
I need this song in an extended version and only instrumental, please!
Another straight fire track from Polyphia
Feature BUCKETHEAD on your next ep's. It will be one of the most legendary song other than Vai's.
Wow.!!
Just turned my friend on to your band... He said why no lyrics till the end. I told him... from perspective... just go with it.. thanks guys. One new fan!!!
Nylon 7/8 string when?
This is definitely a more chunky one, and I am all here for it.
' shame about the monotonous and entirely un-original "singer" clown...  He immediately 'dates it' back to the time of Craig David which is a bummer because the rest of the track is really pretty good.
La están rompiendo con la combinación de géneros mientras mantenienen la consistencia y la identidad, algo extremadamente difícil!!!!
Indonesiaa hadir ☕🔥
Song should be 2x longer.
Did polyphia join the illuminati too?🤔
Please make polyphia feat carlos santana
Session players meet professional rapper. The drums sounds like ass tho.
As soon as I heard the Auto-Tune, I switched it off.
this song is too hard for my brain to digest. My brain can't handle it lol
This gives me vibes of that Nightmare Weekend mashup someone did. Its how I discovered Polyphia years ago. It was randomly in my feed and I was hooked.
Vocês    serão    condenados    ao    fogo   eterno    junto    com    lúcifer   satanás   o   diabo   a   antiga   serpente    (    Apocalipse  20 : 7 - 15    )     O   diabo   enganou    todos    vocês    diz    YHWH  .
Chimera is a nod and a hat tip to GOAT
Crazyyyyy😮❤
Wtf is that?
Woah this is so Damm dope wish they would feature more and more artists like this for their songs.
They should make instrumental only versions of the album mainly cause that was the main appeal of polyphia in the first place as they didn't need vocals.
Love this band it's like Muse plus that Esteban guy
I have no words for polyphia and all the guys but felt little cheesy lyrics. Video playing and everything is so dark and god level rap is nice as well but lyrics in my opinion should be little angry vibe as well. Just my thought. Thanks for all your effort. ❤
An extraordinarily powerful voice without a word!
The vocals from this guy add nothing to this song.
Besides the part with the braindead autotuned rapper it's great
Not enough substance in words
Dont like your lyric
I really want a drum play through of this. I for real can't tell when Clay is playing vs if it's a drum machine!
Go to Trending
This ones got some real rip yo.
"So what genre is this?"   Polyphia.
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤫🤐🤐🤐
Apenas obra ❤️
The Ibanez stoneman!!! looks sick!
This sounds bad
How are they going to play this live? They’re using 6 string on the verse and 8 strings on the heavy part.
Idk if it's been anounced or not, but i think this song will be in a movie
Man that’s so good 💎
I feel like people I see complaining about lil west just don't like rap music, like his part isn't amazing or anything but it's not that bad.
Is the visualizer the Blake painting?
Virgin here, listening for the first time, thank you for breaking me in so sweetly. 🤭🤟🏽🎉 Now I’m hooked
ребята, вы очень крутые. Я в восторге. Спасибо за музыку )
3:34 SCOTTS NOSE?
That custom meshuggah 8 string that scottie has is just to die for.
I love their stuff but this is all i have ever wanted from a poly song.....that little bit of HEAAAVYYYY
Make sure to fvxk off døuxhe bag
I'm blown away, this song is awesome!
This song is soo hypnooootiiics..  the ambience of this song, the accoustic feel, the drum ans bass werks and scottie jobs is mezmerizing
You guys should hire Justin Bonitz for it, vocal outro would be crazy cool as scream part 😶
Think these guys need to take a break and step away for a bit. Maybe go back to work at the factory.
It is called chimera but why does it bring sweet dreams instead of nightmares?
How do you guys play so many different notes but everything sounds the same. Would a consistent riff really kill you. Don't be a 1 trick pony.
If you skip 2:30-3:30 - this is epic!
Fav song from their entire album and on repeat! Hope they get Santana as their next guest would be sick to see them collab
Anyone else stop it as soon as lil west open his mouth? Just me?
When is your next album coming out? need more
I CAN NOT stand modern hip hop AT ALL.  BUT THIS IS AWESOME.
Swing and a miss, love the visuals though!
What happened to Scott's forearm tattoo?
SO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
My personnal favorite from their new album, if all their songs could have that mood, I'll be glad
Oh no.....
Can we be honest? I do understand why.. but in the same time... WHY? I have no idea who is the "singer" with so bad voice and with no "sync" with a song but it is absolutely terrible...  This seems to me like complete lack of inspiration and this song was written in 2 hours and then they had to "add" some "feat" to it... very very bad I am not a huge fan of the band, but I do respect musicanship of the members (same as for example Dimash because of his voice), but this is really bad
Bro Scott killed it!!!!!!!
yeah, I needed a robot rapper on the new Polyphia album. What in the fuck?
Moreish, like ear candy.
Putting auto-tuned vocals on Polyphia instrumentals is like putting hubcaps and training wheels on a Bugatti. If you think I'm wrong then replace Tim with an algorithm because why work on perfecting your craft when a program can do it for you? Auto-tune can make a asthmatic donkey with uncontrollable flatulence sound like Maynard J. Keenan. Imagine being an incredible guitarist and watching the worlds best singer higher the Chuck E. Cheese robot guitarist to feature on tracks. Fucking stop it, please. I mean no ill will towards Lil West or anyone else using auto-tune, there's a time and place. Polyphia, the auto-tuned vocals are making you sound like everyone else which is a shame because you definitely don't sound like everyone else.
Can't wait for the instrumental version of this song
Was Lil Wes necessary 🙄
Love how this album has been Scotty's chance to shine!
Another really odd mix of genres
It was exactly like this on Earth 4000 years ago before the great flood
Is this not the tetris theme?
Elden Ring DLC looks dope..
Damn, it was good until the rap shit started up.
crap singer ruins it
Are they into demon worship now?  Is success going to their head?
Shoutout to Lil West for ruining the best song in the album
All good until the auto tune mumbling started.
why are they SO good
Did I just watch Cell evolve?!
Dare I say it... I think the drums are slightly too loud in the mix
I wish you could collab with Santana.
Hows that magic workn fellas?
The muscles throbbing looks like hallucinations.
Awesome👍👍
2:53 The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the Sun.
Why to bring a low level singer who use auto tune? Stupid mistake.
Yeah
damnnnnnnnn ❤️‍🔥
Not a fan of rap, but musically this track rocks so much
Pretty good.... Then came the vocals.
Awful singing ,totally ruined the great musicianship.
Both these guitarists are truly amazing. I'm not so sure of the vocalist. This is my first time at looking at polyphia video I wasn't expecting that style of  singing, the  guitar playing was out of this world.
this is insaneeee
Polyphia killin it as always, but the rap was pretty lame and unoriginal.
Lil West sounding better than Travis Scott  Gotta give him props 👏
So why is an acoustic drum set making electric drum sounds?
That was dope. Imagine my animation style for one of their music vids lol 😅
I love the beat drop. Fresh asf
The most unlistenable music.
It was really good until you added the mumble rapper.
i like to think that they titled this chimera as wordplay on how 2 genres, rap and rock, can mash together as is the creature
So I've listened to the new album about 8 times. While this is high concept and nutty. Silly and complete nonsense. Based on the character of the album, track listing, and the promotional videos associated my mad lad brain came up with this large companion idea (or something) that the album sorta wrote up in my head lol. its long but, enjoy   I propose that “Remember That You Will Die” by Polyphia is a cosmic horror epic about four beings being created from an immemorial being at the center of a collapsing space time haunted by fading celestial entities and a starving Death.   Genesis  A thought formed from a cosmic entity manifests a tangible group of 4 living* (of Matter) beings. The Source Entity, dateless as it is, does not heed notice of its creation. The beings observe their creator for some time*, longing for its recognition. The beings begin to produce soft sounds that manipulate the space surrounding them from its seizless black towards a shift to more colorful hues.  Playing God   A Being creates an etude, the four follow on cue. The source Entity remains still.  Their echoes travel in intangible direction through space attracting many grand planetary conscious celestial bodies. The audience of celestial bodies study the beings, curiously, cautiously.   One body, made of deep green, dissolves into well lit particles that forge into the shape of a voluptuous woman. The female entity lulls the four into a blissful and less aware state of being. The four discover themselves immersed into an entirely white space that's cornering darkness promises some primal comfort, the multiple wombs of this great white structureless place.   The Audacity   Entering the dark of the blank space the four are molded into something humanoid-adjacent. From the darkness they emerge into a large  bustling city. Suddenly aware of their sentience. The Hollow City is abundant with distractions curated to serve the fours new senses.  Reverie   The four become desired playboy-like subjects to the illusory denizens of the Hollow City. Wealthy in pleasure and sensations. The celestial-female coils about the atmosphere of her suspended City, now in the form of a colossal Dragon.   With boundless sensory stimulants across the Hollow City, the four take up a psychedelic concocted from an illusory denizen to indulge the four’s desire for otherworld knowledge, unaware that they themselves are of no real world. A flaw in the celestial design of the Hollow City to fulfill the wishes of our four.  With matured and newly awakened sentience the four begin suspecting not all is what it seems, suddenly imprinted with memories surrounding their creation  Realizing its* mistake, the celestial dissolves once more into a like-bodied female humanoid to the four and makes its descent.    ABC   In its new corporeal form, the entity approaches the tripping four, a beautiful and lewdly-clad woman.To sway the four into new higher concepts of control, the seductress imparts onto the four an alphabet and further, speech. Attempting to communicate up to this point outside of pure sensory stimulation speaking unto the four does little “I can't speak it's all phonetic”.  The Celestial’s composite body defects here and there as her eyes, ears and mouth phase in and out of observable form. As if manifesting the Hollow City was already pushing its limits.  Once communicable, the four receive the Celestial’s bargain- no longer able itself to keep the Hollow City tangible, violently destructive storms of erasure begin removing pieces of its geography and architecture from itself. The Celestial explains that the "known" universe The Hollow City occupies is held captive by the remains of a long-dead God. Since it's decay set creation halted and everything that ended was no longer recycled into further creation. Eventually* time itself lost concept and ceased to exist. This universe is something else, an absolute nothing, void.   Momento mori  Suddenly from beneath the Hollow City an Angelian mammoth like creature rips through and into the atmosphere, So total in scope that it resembles a geographic landscape collapsing more than a creature. The creature appears covered in chain link that morphs according to the appendages it creates  The female celestial discharges from its form into a mass of some kind and enters a struggle with the chain-like beast, her corporeal form violently ripping into a flurry of particles and light   The four are absorbed into a new space where the Hollow City and conflict stand still. A humanoid approaches them from still-space. The entity explains its using its connection to Source to actively create “Time” and is halting it momentarily. The entity suggests the being that created them is the center of Source and its creative properties. The four are the first creation of true Matter that has existed since the literal "end of time" event. Past the EoT Event space is a "place" ; we're even ancient celestial bodies that created many galaxies now decay. They hold little ability to create anything past temporary illusions. The unknown entity tells the four that prior to the EoT , celestial bodies lost sense of their purpose and led to the immediate surroundings. It urges the four to use their pure source in collaboration with the Source Entity to recreate the universe as it was in the beginning. The unknown celestial with its last connection to source dissolves itself sacrificially into an instrument of Matter that can warp existing space.  All falls apart  As time once more ceases to exist so does the concept to stop it The two dueling entities catapult far into the distance. The Hollow city decays back to an absolute nothing around the four.  NEUROTICA  Unclear to the truth of the Mad God / Dying God the four trek their way through space towards the source entity. Evading what celestial bodies hope to cannibalize their connection to source with their warping instrument. The four begin to question whether regardless of the state of things that they should create their own world inside this space and enjoy the life the Hollow city offered  Chimera   Closing in on the source entity, the four encounter Death. Death informs the four that it's not fed since consuming Time itself. When the Source Entity's creations ceased, Death consumed much of all existing things. Death warns the four he/she/it intends to consume them as well and allow this space to collapse, suggesting its already found layers beyond even source creations that are just fine for it to leave to. Death pursues the Four, consuming the instrument. With no way to defend themselves , Death begins consuming the Four.  The female-celestial however reappears, noticeably lesser and fragmented. Using the last of her/its connection to source the celestial presents itself as a womb and ingests the four into her corporeal form. Death begins savagely eating away at the cosmic womb, The four from within her failing body, desperate to create, echoe once more. These echoes suddenly begin warping the surrounding space, seemingly targeting Death. In a violent attempt to flee the force of the warping Death separates into many serpents and slug abominations, essentially digesting himself and releasing from a vacuum into many waste versions of itself. The echoes once again call audience of existences last celestials towards the struggle  Blood bath   Death Abominations enter a battle against the remaining entities. The four struggle to warp space any longer until they cannot. Death consumes all remaining celestials with relative ease, the universe itself conscious of its creative purpose all but totally lost begins decaying itself. The four acknowledge the time brought to them by the celestials in a newfound rage towards their purpose echo once more. Their Echoes create physically tangible vast oceans of blood in space, finally understanding their connection to source is incredibly powerful. The Sea of Gore expands indefinitely and swallows Death. Death is drowned in the chaos and fury of the building viscera of sea. His many abominations in panic begin slowly ripping into Death as an attempt to save themselves. Ripping Death completely apart at an astrally sound level and ending its existence   Ego Death    As the surrounding existence folds the Four warp into the realm of the Souce Entity. A Nothing envelopes space towards the source entity and our four. The Source Entity begins manifesting a corporeal for itself as a planetary eyeball. The size of the form pulls space in around it , almost consuming its subjects. The Four begin coming into one shape together, like water collecting. They emerge a large bright mass of whites and metals resembling a great silver sun-beetle birthing a sun from a skeletal womb structure in it's chest. In some unknowable tone the form of Source Entity echoes, sounds like light falling from an inconceivable height. As existence collapses across the two beings , their approach whipping existing matter into the enveloping nothing. The two entities connect. A large white space is painted. A large black space over it. And white again. Clipping.
Industry plants 100%
well, thats a bore
Play God rock n hiphop
Such a huge polyphia fan now.  sick vibes.  Im gonna start polyphiating my own music now.  Polyphiate Everything.
so you have some of the best recent musicians and then ruin all with some auto-tuned vocals? Why?
Gotta be really real.. tf is up with everyone and weird ass MVs?!
ya la cagaron tenian que meter a un chango.
Godd damn these riffs are cold
not impressed...
This is the best song they’ve ever composed.
Pretentious shite...
Wow this amazing
Guitar sounds fine, but this rap…all this crap rap sounds same nowadays
love this genre blend
Polyphia is a genre.
I have never been so sure that the "Pick of Destiny" is a real thing.  These fellas clearly sold their souls for that kind of talent.  :)
I love latin trap thall
Could have done without the autotuned mumble bullshit.
Hardest video from the album so far, y’all don’t stop putting out great shit🫡
Out of all their new tracks, this is my least favorite but it's still pretty fire. I fucks with it.
Hopefully Bloodbath is next!
I love these 8 string sounds Polyphia makes magic with those strings and drums
Loving the nylon features on this album! This may have been my favorite riff to cover 😎
Honestly never really understood the appeal of 8 string guitars until approx 0:18 of this song, when all was revealed to me
on numara
hate not hope?  it's not a Spanish guitar Poly    haha
Цой могет
the drummer looks like Dennis's opponent in Ghost Fighter forgot the name
you are absolutely lack of originality  I’m so bored of your one pattern  you are just copycat
Kick kick kick 1:13
This song was great until the one dude started "singing".
Imagine polyphia feat Travis scott
Lil West kinda ruins it for me, sorry.
Up next: Polyphia feat. Daft Punk :p looking forward for it :D
❤Banned Video Leak " https://youtu.be/TCiZ4ZgP2yk " Banned Video Leak ❤
King Crimson & Dream Theater 🎭…on steroids 💪! 😅
thanks for this
Sickkkk!!! 🔥🔥🔥
NGL the auto tune guy ruined it
<3
off the first album listen, this one's the one that stuck out to me so much. I loooooove the heavy distortion oh my goodness, I needed that lol
Hardest one yet, killed it
.. the perfect balance of shred, jam,  and rap. Its heavy yet accessible ..   Incredible .A.O.T.Y..
Great song. Except the guy in the end
Is that tosin abasi's old signature guitar that Tim is playing?
The best form of artist is a spiritual one with profound insight.
iam waiting for reverie now
Fuck yeah! 🤘🏽 What a banger!
the di of that acoustic is just horrible pls stop
The ass clap in that song though 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fav song from the album
I miss the snare / floor tom hit at 1:39
Polyphia is like a bridge between pop fans and rock fans. I'm glad to know them.
The lil west bit lets the song down
this entire track had my face like this 😦stank all the damn way
My mind is absolutely blown by this song!
RIP TAKEOFF😞
can u cut this lil west guy from the track?
Can't get enough of it..... Mighty music... 🔥❤️❤️❤️ Love from India
What the heck! my 12 years are just wasted after watching  this 🎥....  Nah  I'm quitting to play guitar  now
you rock
I don't mean to be that guy but man, this really do be sounding like Bleach fight music
Another masterpiece 🔥
beautiful
I was listening to music then this untalented guy started talking over it.  What happened?
Scary clip. Are you occultists?
The most beautiful intro ever.
I expected better with the rapper but hey, he tried with My band. 🤣
well… they cant all be zingers
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Отстой редкостный!
I'm worried about me bro
This song is killing me 🥱
Scottie and Clay (Drummer) killed it in this track!! So sick!!
AI art is the inspiration behind modern art.
Santana wait for feat
I got excited for a minute thinking it was a collab with Chimaira.
more polyphia rap metal plsssssssssssss
love scottys guitar tones and parts in these songs. killer
amazing!
WOOOHAHHA
Now that was certainly interesting, brief, but quite interesting!
Those little "omega low tune guitar" traks are always incredible and i just love to find those special tracks in a new release of polyphia. they are quite rare and exceptional but damn it had so much chunk and power to it. i have been so much impressed when listening the album at the firts low notes of Chimera and Bloodbath cause i knew what it was about! and damn i love those two songs! So much love to you guys, RTYWD is a classic <3
https://youtu.be/JT4xW7zIAbQ?t=214 - nose armour
Polyphia is good but they can't bigger than Metallica, iron maiden, Megadeth, Sepultura.. Why??? Simple coz they don't have genre. "Metal Up Your Ass".
Sheesh
For a second I read lil wayne. I was so hyping for his legendary solo untill I realized.
@Polyphia we need a Polyphia X Project Pat song.
It was great until the singing started. It dropped my music high on to a concrete ground. It's dead. Sometimes songs can be without commentary. Not every song needs lyrics. This bad is Cleary good enough to portray a masterpiece without it (at least from what I've heard so far.) Sorry, not sorry. I take my music buzz very seriously.
everything is great but the auto tune c-rap
I smell Tosin 😊
Lil West could've been replaced by any other D-tier rapper. 🤮  As usual, Polyphia's awesome!
polyphia but make it prog djent
Sounds the same as their whole catalogue.
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Can't wait to see feat rich brian
Before Scottie got his right hand tattooed
indah dan kenang oleh masanya
Scottie‘s part goes haaaaard 🔥
Would love to see an Version of this album without any lyrics.
In the making of video of the song, Playing God off this album Tim mentions a band called Alluvial.  I bought their newest album, Sarcoma and it really just blew me away.  I’m not the biggest death metal fan but these guys all bring it.  One of the best metal albums I’ve heard in the last few years.
I've been really enjoying all kinds of music for the better part of my life, but in 30 years, never have I heard anything that brings me as much bliss and joy as this album does.
Scotty bringing the Metal here, sounds sick
This band is like the pied piper for me, I'm a few notes in and completely hooked and just got to hear it all. Fantastic band!
Holy fuck!
O.m.g 🔥👍
These guys are one major hit away from changing the way rap and rock can blend forever, I can feel it. Maybe that's what they mean by Chimera? A blend of two creatures, two genres.  Edit: My zoomer ass offended some boomers/ older millennials with my wording. I know this has already been done to some degree. What I MEANT is that this brand of Math Rock has never been so mainstream and I would love to see them get popular enough to infect MODERN rap/trap, since it all sounds the same. Imagine an Eminem or Drake song with them backing it!
Тяжёлая нежность
They've got a song nasty but everything they make is nasty
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Amazing...! Melon plz
Wow.I dreamt about Poliphia and 8 strings guitar Наконец-то.
Pls do collab with denzel curryy 😢
That’s one muscular back
Sooo loouwww
Seems like everything is AI generated <3
This song should of ended at 2:35
Scottie is awesome....love his parts in this album.
did not expect scotty pulling out a fredrik thordendal signiture guitar lmao
It's nice to see Scott is shredding to his hearts content, bring tears to my eyes
Faak me!!! This is absolute killer. Props to all Polyphia <3
idk I think I prefer what Waxamilion was trying to do with "Kühles Labor, Saki (feat. ALäZ & Rocky Angelini)" This is different sure but I can't honestly say I'd repeat a playthrough on this one, just me tho
i realy waned this to become a music video the past couple of days and me dream has come through
Polyphia officially joined illuminati.
Love the track but loathe the autotune.
This is Bob.  😊  👚  👖  👞  He is 0 years old. Every like this comment gets he gets 1 year older. How old will he get?
Insane track
Ah yes, that Fredrik's Stoneman 🤤
The thall is strong on this one. I love how they're experimenting so much. Gave a vildhjarta vibe with the intro
2:35  Personal replay button for that fire rap 🔥
woah this was really nice
Yes now I see it, Scott’s signature shape is iceman for life.
Why he look like a Klingon tho ?
Amazing
My favorite
Sick
Have u ever live concert like everyone?
What's wrong fellas. Smoke from the fire bothering ya?
polyphia and slipknot need to happen
Sold. Pure Evil. Condemned. Talents put at service  of the Death Cabal. Tremendous betraying towards the light. I m sad for these people. They r not aware.. Used as bitches
This tune is really awesome. It’s really sad that lil west’s zero taste rap with tons of effects on is ruining it…
I can't believe how far not only Polyphia has come, but music in general. Never once did anyone even 3 years ago think that one day artists would be mixing 8 string djent, prog, jazz, some flamenco, and modern rap together.  My ears are blessed as well as my eyes. Polyphia is my top #1 group riding into 2023.
Aside from the actual track being dope, as always. The visuals here stuck out for me as well. Reminded me of "The Great Red Dragon" painting by William Blake
Carlos santana is waving..
As a rap fan, I feel like the bars were flat. Music was dope but I've always though Tech nine or Dax would be the best fit with Polyphia
This absolutely SLAPPED. Every single note Scottie played was absolutely disgusting in the best way possible. Not a huge fan of featuring rap but it wasn't bad at all. As far as the instrumentals... simply blown away. Would love to see more of this heaviness!
What the fuck have we become
Polyphia lost my respect
Give West his Flowers... !!!! MOST UNDERRATED VERSAITLE ARTIST... NO KIZZY !
I don't think the drummer gets enough credit
rock🎉
Polyphia meets thall ?
This is probably my favorite off this album next to playing god
Love this song to death and the album is totally amazing but I could honestly do without all the mediocre rap features.. none of them really stand out as even comparably sick as the instrumental genius that is Polyphia.  Just my opinion but I know I’m not alone.
They just keep pushing the envelope, and blending all the best parts of every genre of music! Thank you Polyphia!!
This is honestly the direction I saw Polyphia heading towards a while ago, and it's fantastic!! Steve Vai one track, lil West the next?! And it all works phenomenally... bravo dudes, bravo 👏
Not a fan of the feature. Don’t know who that artist is, but the lyrics are soulless and empty in comparison to the great instrumental work.
Yet another banger straight from the depths of the cosmos with complex sounds and riffs. 🔥
Bro, TO POLYPHIA, If u read this! I hope u can explore ur effect guitar sounds, so it always fresh and progressive, luv you all bro
🔥🔥🔥
That tone be like some thick Memphis bbq boi sheeeeeeeeeee
Lil west reminds me of Avatar
Make a fuckin' collab album like this, it's really good.
Lil West flow after his first few bars are insanely cringy
Omg.. That Stoneman though....
Love you guys <3
This was my fav track on my first listen to the full album. I knew it was gonna pop off too!
scottie has conjured some absolute filth here
🦁🐐🐍🔥🔥🔥
i was like meh.. till the djent kicks in
I liked it, then lil west started, why?
Every song on this album, I hear and think « that’s my favourite «
La verdad las guitarras y el bajo esta bien pero el baterista demaciado simple mucha computadora le metio
Hell Yeah!
Why can’t I listen to anything else right now damnit Tim and Scott and clay x2
Absolutely love the instrumental but tbh I can`t say I understand what the vocals are doing for this song. Music is a goddamn killer track. Vocals are like generic autotune from 2005. The contrast in talent is too much. Feels like some college team assignment where everyone did some stellar work then the last guy shows up with some botched stuff he wrapped together 15 minutes before showing up.
That was a sick ass video! You guys are fucking killing it
Trap Metal
Was great until that guy started talking over the music.
sound so crunchy
To be able to blend genres at this level and push the limits of musicianship is greatness 🙏🏼
Oh damn
Yes!!!!!!! I need more!  ❤❤
Pop version of TOOL
Do you take some studient ?? stagiaire belike
😱😱😱OMG .. 😶😶😶 SPEECHLESS 👏👏👌👌.. 🤘 regards from 🇮🇩 #pkngtown INDONESIA
The vocals weren't for me, an instrumental fan.
LOL @2:36 WTF
who asked for this auto-tune gargabe? I'm puking.
My favorite with rap vocals. Reminds me of a gorillaz song structure just to have the feature on part of the song like this
Drum so loud can't hear guitar 😭😭😭
Really getting some heavy Vildhjarta vibes from Scottie's riffs. Love it
I've loved you guys since the very early days! This track I absolutely love! But.... what on earth are these lyrics.
Okay, their musicality is no doubt at a whole another level and everyone here knows that already. Now let's talk about that nose accessory scottie wore on 3:33
Love this Album!
Cool song!  I really dug the Lil West section!!!  👍🏻
Scot is using the Meshuggah guitar😎
I love this song also because I feel like it's going to finally put the nail in the coffin for all the gatekeeping "metal" guys and pop haters, surely you guys can leave now and let more music enjoyers take your place and then some :D
BESTO ALBUM OF 2022🔪🔥🔪
Esses caras estão um absurdo só!! 😱
It's  awesome!!!
polyphia plz come to arizona i'm begging you
What is that thing😳 3:43
Crearon un universo musical propio. Cada track es un viaje diferente por ese universo repleto de paisajes sonoros, atmósferas, climas, virtuosismo (  al servicio de la obra ), y visualmente acompañan muy bien sus músicas.  No pensé que algo así volviese a conmoverme. Larga vida a estos chicos. Son excepcionales en el más amplio sentido del término.
That is just sick as all heck
Oh wow nice rap touch
I gave them 3 chances.....no more....all their shit sounds the same....dont fucking say it doesnt....only,ONLY! A musician  ( anyone who practices playing guitar) can HEAR THE DIFFERENCE. If your not a musician,....everything they play sounds the same.
mantap kas ,nice buddy 🤘🤘
Polyphia // Post Malone next please!!!!!
скучно.джэки винсент круче этой гопши  в сикстиллиарды раз. а до ванька тунчи им как до звезды небесной
flimed in the void
Well would you look at that...after saying this was the best off the album out of all the non-singles...it becomes a single aha! 😂 you love to see it!!! Would love to see them do one for Bloodbath next...get Chino involved 😏
Crazy how versatile this album is. Lol Tim said if you like “music” you’ll love our album
T H A L L
I died at 2:40 from meh voice and then died again at 3:04 from autotune. Pls post instrumental thx
Polyphia do not Worship Satan ! Don"t worship Satan! He"s a backstabber ! The Music is cool!
Berried Alive vibes madgenius
terlalu gila cok ini bocah2 bandel. bangkeee skill macam apa ini
why do all rappers wanna be "Lil" something and not BIG something? Big Pun, Big Sean, etc...there should be more "Big" rappers. real talk
Maaan they are hard workers. It's like there is a new song or video every other day. 👍👍👍👍
I love Polyphia, they're incredibly talented, but for me at least, I don't like the addition of rappers, especially ones who don't deviate at all from the typical sound of today's rappers, like this guy; I mean he even has "lil" in his name. These guys must have a checklist of "how to be a rapper in 2022," it's just all the same shit over and over again. It takes away from the track. Rappers are an additional percussion instrument, while singers and screamers are more an additional melody instrument. It's hard to add more percussion to already perfect drum track. I just wish they'd feature more technical rappers to match their technical style, like if they got MF Doom (rip), or Aesop Rock, it'd probably sound so good. Even guys like Busdriver, Death Grips, and JPEGmafia would add a bit nuance that is otherwise extinct with these copy-paste rappers.
What’s the name of the short one
One of the first polyphia songs that's just immediately a bop to me. Maybe I'm just getting accustomed to their style?
This may be the most natural marriage of two major genres of music I've ever heard.  There's something very special happening here. Something evolutionary.
I hope they Collab with Oli Sykes
good song but they did lil west dirty makin him wear all that on his face lol
Now do something with Ye.
When can one purchase Scottie's nose armor!? Same nose size but mine is not as beautiful as his! 🤘🖤
lil west style is like a night king isn't?
Is it just me or does parts of the song sound like "I don't won't no scrubs"
Trash vocals ruin it...
Great job guys a and Happy Halloween 🎃!
me hearing in 144p quality : 😭
The hip hop hi hat crap ruins it for me
awesome untill the rapper started --ruined the song
Vocals made it only worse. That damn autotuned shit is boring. All the same and lame.
I hope they do one for Bloodbath tbh
I would love to hear polyphia and J.I.D mashup
that don dong dodong dooonnnn riff works really fine with the tring tweaang trititiing ting ting tweang.. Its fabulous
This might be my favorite on the album! So fire
not sure why yall added a whack rapper to your masterpieces. Dissapointed but still love you guys. Total legends. I hope you go back to what got you where you are.
Holy fuck you guys always have the coolest videos!!! The style, the symbols, the props, the matching guitars and jewelry! Get the fuck outta here with this shit! Groovy as fuck guys! Great feature! Love the Travis Scott vibes!
Now take dude off the song with his less than generic lyrics, and it'll be a great song.
WOW! Superb!
While I appreciate your musical directions,  I really hope you release an Instrumental version of this amazing Album,  so the OG fans can still salivate and experience the full instrumental perfection ❤
Ok. No se q decir. Polyphia es excelente banda y q se habrán a distintos estilos musicales es genial aunq en lo personal buena canción aunq no sea de mi gusto
didnt know the winter soldier could lay down some sick ass drum lines
Real ones remember when this song leaked before playing god
I'm gonna beat off to that opening acoustic flamenco trap riff
3:11 on is actually the most godlike thing i've ever heard in my entire life. I've listened to this part (and song) over 100 times since the album dropped. seriously
Yeahh 🔥🔥🔥
damn shes good
this is by far my favorite on the album!
What's the creature in this video? Looks dystopian af
At the risk of sounding like a jaded boomer, how do you go from Steve Vai and Chino Moreno to this talentless cookie cutter rapper? "i got cheese gonna buy shoes"??? Come on!
When MathRock combine with genre Metal it's call MathMetalRock🤘
Damn!!! That groove is really hypnotic! I've always been a metalhead, but you guys, you make me appreciate some others musical styles! Incredible talents and skills in this band!!!
Good Music👍👍👍👍👍👍🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘👍
hunter x hunter
It's inspirational to see Tim's evolution from anime watcher to anime character.
Happy to see them embrace their hip hop vibe to the fullest.
My 53 year old dad loves you guys, he’s normally very picky with his music taste, but the Latin sound that you guys have drawled him in. He really enjoys Playing God, he told me it sounds like “Latin techno,” and I couldn’t be happier
Love the idea of singing in just one particular part
I love how this song is labelled as explicit on YT Music despite not having any swearing
This was great
Thall approves
I love when they do flamenco on acoustic.
Best rap feature by far
Scottie beast mode
Sound Fire 🔥🩸
Such a nice song as always, anyways youre so close to 1m subs! Keep up the good work
this kinda reminds me of their old music video style
Muito foda tudo.
Lyrics:  Good girl in a costume It's your world when I'm with you Forever with you like a tattoo I paint a picture in a bad mood  Shoot through the breeze lika a parachute I got cheese, get a pair of shoes Big boody, need a lot of room She keep calling when I'm never home  I'll be what you need lowkey on the east I can see everything that you went through I'll be your tool, I can fix you Even if I loose, it'd be nothing new  She's old news to the whole school It's my rules when I make moves I make it rain like a monsoon My new date can you come soon?  The best high was the best rise, she said that She really wanna come out to the west side If she commin' with me she can hit me with her best side She can be my mrs. give me kisses on our bedside  Lowkey when we in the light You want me but it's never right Hold me, I'm a low life You know me 'cause I'm on the rise
Now it feels like Halloween music
Vildjharta vibes
Break into the dark feat
Holy shit they just keep getting better!!!
Drummer work is so amazing 👌
Vocals sucks!
Yeaahhhh....🤟🤟🤟
Sounds sick boyz
T H A L L
Go Scott go
Woah ❤
boost
OS MAIORES
...🌹
Scott with the nose bling.
the only good song in this album lol
This had a different kind of flow, a little heavier. I dig it.
Excuse me whilst I go peter griffin for a second: do you know what really grinds my gears? That theres some songs out there with more views than polyphias highest viewed YT video, that someone got the idea from watching a Music 2000 play through off PS1, and slapped some monotone rap over it that uses swearwords every nine seconds  It frustrates me to no end that not every school teaches music, or takes music education seriously.  Because if they did? These video views would be in this millions a couple of days into release.  And that's what really grinds my gears
These boys have worked their ass off this year. Kudos
THIS SONG THOOOOO. What a combo. Yet again have masterfully chosen people to collaborate with and they’re so willing to try new genres and styles. It’s just incredible and so inspiring. Thank you for this 🙏🏼
Mr LePage shining like a diamond on this one
Lil West fucks this whole song up… ridiculous
I just don't know why Tim's playing remembers me so much of Paco DeLucia
I love that Scott is doing all the more shreddy, metal solos this album
bro ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥🤘
this album has such a unique horror styling
we need a chimera face reveal
Legit heard Travis Scott on this - the rap/djent mix is crazy good
Damn, there're eight strings on Tim's guitar !
THALLyphia
Awesome, as always!
I swear, this song is like the accumulation of all their styles. Jesus christ what a banger.
This track should be in future Doom internal games
I swear this is music 2.0
This album rlly is Scott’s love child
i dont get that car ;D
Been a fan since inspire
The musical presence is quality. They really give it all !!!
wanna see Polyphia x post malone 😎
This song is just amazing.. Love the scottie solo
POLYPHIA
Flamenco meet progresive rock..nice
The band that brings guitar back to live
The last part remembered me to what Berried Alive does. Trap/Rap with sick guitar riffs as a base.  That heavy part was amazing despite the dude was talking crap about metal the whole week 😅
Way too soft 😅
Fuck yeah Scott
I wish that was a longer song! This is so good!!
Scott went beast mode on this album.  Love it
Generic rap aside, this is so MUCH better than the alphabet song nonsense. Feels like there's something just on the edge of knowledge in the melody but you can't quite  grasp it. Just like the video hints at something you think you know but you can't be certain. Full marks!
Really dig the music in itself! Polyphia in all their greatness but not a fan of the heavy autotune voice that is in almost every rap song nowaday..
YES SCOTTIE GO OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love the music as always. Definitely not a fan of mixing it with really poor lyrics and auto tuned vocals though. I know, I’m too old.
I straight up thought lil west was one of MF Dooms guys cuz of his mask
beautiful Song, but Lil west.... No.... Why?
As someone who loves Polyphia and hip hop, that Lil West part was.... Ungood...
Another nice Ibanez ad.  Scott rocking those metal models, first the Xiphos and now the FTM33 🔥
Nice. Way to steal Vildhjarta’s next riff they were gonna write
This is peak Polyphia. Each new song feels like a historic event that we get to witness. Gonna be on this vid for a while.
That Meshugga ftm33 8 string Scotties playing sounds sick as fuck ! Another banger!
A mixture of new and old Polyphia, fucking love it.
I get enough vocals in the world, I come for the feelings
Thanks lads, another magical gift to the world.
Such lame rappers on this album. Great song until the guy comes in rapping about bitches and money
👍👍👍
can we get a version that is just polyphia ? and dosent have the vocals ?
They did it again! Maaterpiece
William Blake in the house
Dope and also noticed the YouTube stuff looks different lol like the like buttons and the chat box
I cant stop listen this ! BRAZIL HERE 🇧🇷 🇧🇷
Are Polyphia going for a new grammy category called: I don't know what the fuck this is and we aren't smart enough to tell you so let's throw a Grammy at em' award? Cuz they deserve it. This is alien territory.
Is Tim touching clay's balls ?!
Interesting having the red dragon on this new video
won't be surprised when Tim has neck surgery in the future
Idgaf what anyone say homey thst look like a girl but is a guy . Home boy gay as hell fr gtf
that nose mask(?) on scottie's nose 🤌
Nothing like a little SATAN.
Alright, I'll be the one to say it. Lil West cheapens this song so much. He is nowhere near as good at rapping as the band members are with their instruments. His lyrics are trash that a stoned middle schooler could write in 5 minutes at their desk.
if I played bass I'd play it just like clay and Mike Starr
Obra de arte
This is awesome but the autotuned vocalist held it back in my opinion.
Thallyphia!
i need "Fuck Around and Find Out feat. $not" vídeo.
Bruh i want to see the demon's face
5 out of 7
Even though these guys might be involved in the dark arts, that's not going to stop me from listening.
Polyphia shredding in the upside down too 😂
Y cuando rompe el tema...? Porque no me di cuenta...
Edge
One collab with Tommy Emmanuel?
охуенно
The music, the video, it's a masterpiece
人造人間ですか？
I lsitened to this whole album last night with some relatively high end headphones. I highly recommend doing that.
The rap isn't bad, just doesn't suits with this song.
How the drummer remembers all of these intricate parts for songs that are almost arhythmic, blows my mind.
Lil West corny AF LMAO Instrumental when
Sh!ts dope

Neurotica Guitars and Masks is back.😍
Hum lyrics always feel weird on Polyphia , love the musical part though
My god why did ye ruin an epic song with absolute rap bollox
More. :)
I didn't know who Lil' West was but my man's legit ELEVATED the song and I didn't think that was possible vocally lol
so sick
Definitely my favorite on this album!
easily the best track from the non-singles and its not close
I couldn't be more proud of this band. I've been following these guys since 2019, and it makes me so happy to see how much they've blown up
Aaaah the famous Flamenco Djent 🔥
Lil West (I have no idea who he is) didn't ruin the song, so I'm happy about that. That was a ridiculous trap beat by Polyphia, so good.
NO WAY YOU COLLAB'D WITH LIL WEST
str8 up
Nice re-imagining of William Blake's The Great Red Dragon 👹
The riff that Scott plays is dope. Of course tim is tim.
I wasn't expecting nothing from Lil West and he gave us everything, so precious song, stuffs like that i wanna see more, long live Polyphia and all they diversity, one of the best album in industry nowdays.
Not a big fan of this song or video, I think these boys are hitting the end of the unique train.
from Steve Vai to this...
And I thought this album couldn’t get any better
My first thought when I saw the white puffy things was “cauliflower!” So now the video just looks like them all demonic playing to a cauliflower and I adore it
Flamenco + Hip Hop .. okay we're in the game
Todo lo que hacen lo hacen bien! 🤯 Me encanta!
I can’t just seat still listening one of the most progressive bands of our time just spills that ignoble disgusting rappy shit right in the middle of the great album. I feel like some crappy wall painter ruins my Sistine Chapel with huge strokes of brown infernal substance. As a result we have three tracks from the album to throw directly into the garbage.  Nice experiment. Sorry
damn! scott use the Fredrik Thordendal Signature guitar:D
Ohh. This is amazing
Go Scottie!
Are they both playing 8-string guitars?
YO THIS IS SICK!!!! Everyone's killin' it on this track and BRUH the outfits...chef's kiss
I love the X-files motif from 2:17 till the end. Very otherworldly and the perfect icing to this two toned cake. 🙏
Very Demonic! The talking part was stupid...just my opinion
Epic guys!
what a way to ruin a good song
Start good, middle good, rap part - not needed, ending good.
Not their best work, and still magnificent.
Sick!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I cant wait bloodbath music video
💖🙏 🇳🇵 Devraj.
Dude looking like he should be playing an ocarina.
Bravo!!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😃👍
Smoke N Mirrors guys….don’t be DECEIVED. 😎
This is better than metallica.
Man I'd love to hop on a track with Polyphia.
🔥🔥🔥
🔥⚡🎶
His baby is the abomination. But the sweet music it makes, kills!
Every Polyphia song sounds the same. I literally want to understand the hype. Its just their drummer doing triplets on a closed hi-hat, with Vape commercial guitar riffs for like 99 songs. The music is so overproduced that its just one flat sound going out the door, nothing sounds full because they're a studio band, live its just a bunch of dynamics being thrown in 99 different directions with no cohesive sound.
Most of the comments on your videos prove your "fans" are mostly an attention seeking cult probably teens who think different and good are the same thing.
que brutal
Is that a meshuggah signature 8 in his hands?
Game changed y’all! Say goodbye to the same old music you listen to since high school. Polyphia is the new sound/band to chase. Epic
Tim looks like Overhaul with his mask.
I love this album, except the rap stuff. I just skip that. I’m in my 40’s, I grew up with rap in the 90’s but I’ve lost all taste for it in the last few years.
THALL
Honestly probably my favorite fuckin song ever....every single piece of this song i feel like describes my life and my journey
These dudes are soooo fucking sick.
need instrumental (:
Once again, that rhythm section is lit AF. All Clay, all day.
thall
Tim’s guitar looks like some HR Giger art
Can any D&D players tell them what a Chimera actually is? lol
This is awesome!!! So… dark(?)
Think this might be my favorite one on the album
The instrumental is good.
wow lilwest looks like some dark elf from skyrim
Tim looks more like Yvette Young every video.
I hate the rapping, but the song still slaps. Polyphia never fails
Still digesting this album but I gotta say that polyphia sounds better without vocals imo. They sound great either way though
Was listening to this last night.. video's here again.. fuckin awesome.. na pi beli u
Generic nickel a dime rapper as a feature
This new Mortiis era ain't nothing like he used to sound, still lit tho. Cool collab.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 WOOOOOO
Probably the most badass fusion track ever. And holy fuck that video! Just wow !
We need a whole Chino side project and a Post collab
it's funny how we went back to mixing metal with rap. I mean it as a compliment thou, it's like the direct evolution of the Nu Metal formula, but with the style of metal and rap of nowadays
Could you release a version without these lyricists. Ruining the tracks for me
Oh God, it's the 8 String!
Next its Katy Perry ? 🤣
fix yall shit the vid is like .5 sec off and screwing with me
God damn. When Tim said on the podcast that he's just waiting on Scott to finish the rest of his parts I didn't expect them to hit so hard
Asides from the other guitar masterpieces like Playing God and Ego Death, this is my favorite song from RTYWD in pure vibes🙏
Monumental album. They are doing what nu tried to do in 00s and many shredders in 10s failed miserably - to bring instrumentals to masses. Unique composing style that works brilliantly.
Great music, but the choreography and satanic symbolism is very pathetic
3:34 Scott's nosejazzling on point
🇺🇦🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🇺🇦
We needed a video like this for the Song with Chino on it. That Would have been dope.
Dude this has become my favorite track of the album, the mix between the 7-string (or 8??) and the acoustic guitar is sick and the final beat when Lil West enters sounds just awesome, just make you headbang hahaha
I was blown away when I saw this album's guests. They just do whatever they want, and it's always brilliant. These guys are unreal.
Sooooo goood 😍😍❤️❤️
These guys are…pretty cool.
i LOVE that they're bringing back some heavy shit for this album
If you had a choice of another someone else besides lil west, who would you choose?
Amazing 👏👏👏
The autotune part is not my vibe but the instrumental part is amazing i love it !
The cgi and visuals are insane here, they literally look like the guys from polygia 😍🥰
Amazing song. Elementary lyrics. Oh well
Djent-Hop
Glad to see Tim took off his gloves for the video. Om nom nom
606
605
604
Wish they found anyone in hip hop on their level of skills and musicality for the collabs, that shit's just embarrasing and brings the band down.
mfs got a guitar for every song
red dragon 😮
This is sickkkkkk
this album absolutely slays!
This was such a great song!! Right up until the point the overly auto-tuned dude (Lil West I assume?) started opening his mouth. What a shame.
最高
Love this!
Virtuosos! To be honest, the Lil West segment was probably my least favorite. Polyphia has a bright future ahead! We need another video with Steve Vai! BTW, the DRUMS!!! WOW!
Huge level 👏🏻
This song. Holy hell
They had me up until that singer.
Song: WOW ... Video: WOW ... Polyphia: ❤
First a 7 string Xiphos and now an 8 string Iceman? Scottie coming in with shreddies!  Edit: It's not an Iceman. After watching the chimera playthrough video it's obvious it's an FTM33. Cool to see Scott rocking someone else's signature. It might get Ibanez to be like, "Maybe he needs his own..." lol wishful thinking.
Loved the video concept, it really fits the vibe
https://youtu.be/ValqXAh1EXs 🎃
There should be a new Grammy award category - "Best Polyphia song"
Not a big fan of autotuned mumbling but the rest holds up
I apreciate that you have gone to black metal style
Yo Spanish vildhjarta + modern pop!? These mfs will really combine any genre and make it gold
One of my favourite songs from the new record
Fucken brilliant. Thank you.
I need a playthrough of all songs in the álbum!!!!
Fuck--this is DOPE
Great song, garbage vocals
Instrumental version when?
So soft I could just swallow it So crunchy needs to be dipped on a vinegar.
C est toujours pareil avec eux, où comment faire une musique simplette sur trois accords en lui donnant l' air "vachement compliqué"...
Crazy🗿 looking forward to the bloodbath clip
I'm just amazed it took this long for a rapper to collaborate with non-digital instrumentalists. And it sounds dang good!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I like the song until the rap part... didn't really care for the video either. If I was this rappers friend for the the rest of my life if I saw id be like hey man remember when you dressed up as a gay vampire in that music video?
Lil West costume 🤣🤣
Ugh, they go from something amazing (Ego Death) to trash autotuned rap 🤮🤮
Tim: ☠️😷☠️  Scott: ✨👃✨
thall
thall. Love how much Scottie shines on this album!
Lil West is ruining everything, his « flow » is so whatever… he doesn’t fit Polyphia AT ALL
Dropping dope content on the regular.
damn scottie killing it
Gotta be honest, this is kind of not so great for a music video. I love the song, I love the album, I'm constantly playing it on repeat. But this video? Kinda wack, I mean, just not very creative. Maybe videos like 40oz, ABC, and Look But Don't Touch spoiled me.
Instant classic isn't it ?
Amak thin mang e.. A nalh lutuk tlat
3:34 my mans Scotty with the schnozz mask. Big ups to all my big nose brothers out there.
This is a weird Polyphia Song but i like Scorrs guitar Tone on this One
I am a new talent support him
https://youtu.be/3uO-evMHEus
Sick video
Hf
this album gonna hold me over for the next 5 years EZ
Fuck this is good.
I stopped at like 3:24.. I heard the message before the vocals came in which didn't match the story of the music.. the music is amazing as always though... Guys, you are so beautiful! The baphomet imagery was done so tastefully.. I hear the goat channeled through you guys in this one! hats off to your director too! 😜
Bubbles: Greasy
trap metal rock?
Scared me for a sec, thought you were having an antisemitism feature
"instrument armor"
I see scotte as real MVP in every song.
That was absolutely sick. Until the vocals. Just gets in the way of what I want to hear, which is just the four of them. Felt the same way about ABC. Unpopular opinion, maybe, but...I just want my Polyphia, and nonvocal features!
Wow
id buy thos masks
song is so dope...until lil west shows up. autotuned rap and rap with that kinda flow (or lack thereof) needs to stop.
Totally read “feat. Lil Wayne” 😅😂
that's expensive
Awesome!👍😎
so are we not going to talk about how good their instruments look? Like those plates on top of the guitars here and in Neurotica look so good! 🔥
Man I would  loved it to have stayed instrumental... This song is sick.
I wish they would do less spacey themed music. You don't need to overlay everything.
and there is me who try to cover this with my 6 strings haha
This is quite good.
@meshuggah would love this
yall are playing with fire with all this demon stuff. more creative music less devils please.
3:35 Scottie fully embracing the nose meme
Love this song already.
They traveled back in time to when things were still black and white to find chimera and found it 🎸
Vildhjarta vibes anyone??
That Ibanez stoneman looks nice
The black and white fits perfectly. Sick video. Also, I love the juxtaposition of the vocals and the  8-strings.
Yes!!! Super catchy hooks. I love it!
Love and love 😍😍🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hey guys, my album keeps doing this weird thing where every time I listen to it it sounds better..
🔥🔥🔥
Креатив ради креатива, не более. Технично? Разумеется. Но, увы, на фоне предыдущих ваших работ эту нет желания переслушивать. Смешение стилей и эксперименты это хорошо, когда они не мешают основной идее
More collab with hiphop artists please.
I love this song! awesome video!
I think this is boring tbh. Takes forever to go anywhere. Wish the finding finally comes in, it's about as generic as anything.
Hey guys, my album keeps doing this weird thing where every time I listen to it it sounds better..
🌲🙏🌿
lil west estropea la canción
The hooks and mix is just (chefs kiss)
Cool music & great band, pity about the autotune mumble rap nonsense collab! Different strokes for different folks.
man im still learning the other songs hjahah i cant keep up! bbeautiful work as always!~
When is polyphia x post Malone coming out?
Ufff que bestialidad ... lo de Tim es maravilloso
mind-blowing drums on this one
Red Dragon is back
cool visuals
I'm waiting to see when that asian guy releases a Guitar cover in like 4 hours. Including the editing and uploading
🔥🔥🔥🔥🤘
Great song going to trash at the moment this auto-tuned dude comes in.
Polyphia Thumbs up, Autotune guy thumbs down
damn. seeing all these colabs just makes me want to hear what they came up with for the Tillian colab, but unfortunately we might never hear that.
Best song on the album
Shit vocoder
Waiting for instrumental version
Yeah man I'm definitely down for this genre bending now. Metalhead at heart but this is just executed so well.
This is one of my fav's on the album.
Polyphia x Lil NAS X when?
It's a great sounding band but that's not going to save Washington fron bad karma or anything... It's like tool.. know that
Man , i try to like this style but i cant. Its not for me  I cant hear music in there instruments  Seems to robbotic with many effects
Nice but too bad they had to put stupid rap in it.
New album is so solid musically, but these vocal features need to hit the trash can, ruining the music entirely.
This is so fucking awesome. The combination of fingerstyle and the heavy shredding is gold.
Came for the guitars, but i love Lil Wests vocals on this.
Tim's custom acoustic guitar is so beautiful. Love this dark design.
Best song on the album
Yes, 4 privileged white kids having THAT word in their lyrics. I'll pass 👋
dark thall trap?
Favorite one from the album ! Make me feel like a Bad ass villain 🔥🤘
😭
Why do u even need this guy, for the name?
Ibanez rules
amazing... l am from indonesia
Fire!
goosebumps on every note
Ah my favorite track on the album. I'm glad you guys did a video for this one next.
It would have been better with Cory Taylor or something like that...growl voice, and so on
It's incredible how much I dislike the vocals. Should that be...cool or what? Dude can't sing, can't dance, weird text. Wtf.
Those djenty riffs are killer
Fffffffaaaaaaaaaaak yeh!
I might be in the minority, but I hope the release an all instrumental version of the album.  This song is epic but the vocals don't fit imo.  The only song on the album where I like the vocals is Bloodbath.  I can deal with ABC vocals because it is a fun song but would really love an instrumental of these songs.  And I know it is weird because most people don't listen because of no vocals.  So yes, probably in the minority with this.    Overall, this album is amazing and can't wait for my vinyl edition to ship
I can’t wait  bloodbath with chino in the video !!!! 🙏🏻
song potential 10 out 10, song outcome IMO 7 out of 10.
This would have been great without the mumble rap. Ruined music.
Cool
Sickening
Song should have ended at 2:35
2 minutes and 35 seconds intro for Lil West
Insane
William Blake 🤌
Bravo
Ngl, wasn't excited about the possibility of rapping being on the track, but honestly that was my FAVORITE part and now I'm upset his verse was so short 😅 Polyphia killing it as always! 🥰🥰🥰
We still doing covid though?
Vocal melody really reminds me of The Trooper by Iron Maiden, ahah
Hands down album is one of the most boring regurgitated pieces of turd I’ve listened to in a while
Love the headbanging at the end, Tim. Wish that the part with vocals was a lot longer - it was just getting good!
CRAZY AMAZING! I friggin love Polyphia! Much gratitude! I feel your music through my entire being! Ase’ Bless! 🤲🏾🖤🌈🎶🧜🏾‍♀️🎸🪷🥁🦄🎹🧡🙏🏾
Whoa, this is over the top!  Completely... *mind blowing* 😮🖖💛🌹🪐⚡💥🔥💕
WHERE ARE ALL THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS? I mean, this is just pure boredom, coming from such an inspiring band as Polyphia...
I can't remember where but the acoustic guitar is sooo similar to a Mexican or Colombia traditional music in harp lol. I have to figure out which song exactly. I'm sure I heard those notes in that exact order before 🤔
Really interesting because this song gave me imagery of a destroyed city, and look what we have in the music video.
The best song for spooky season
This album is unbelievably good
Damn!! There this New Genra called Polyphia ✨
Drummer, awesome, bassist amazing, both guitarists, super talented Vocals, needs a pitch corrector but can speak seven to eight syllable sentences
Love this song so much, the vocals are incredible
It was great until the vocals came in.  Thankfully, the vocals were short-lived.
Best song off the album 🥶🥶
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Man..that drop at 3:12 slaps SO HARD!
GHOSTEMANE X POLYPHIA?
no Yngwie special guest?
Damn. I wonder who does the visual effects. 🔥
why trap ...
Be carefull.. so adictive!!
nose
The thumbnail, cursed my eyes
thall
I always thought the upside down would make a perfect set for a Polyphia music video
Dang bro, lil Wayne look straight outta the new Wakanda movie
Scottie using a stoneman is final boss levels of cool.
Great song
So when is Ibanez dropping the Scotty Iceman 8 string? 😆
Keren bgt , salam dari Indonesia ❤️🇮🇩
THALLYPIA
Love that heavy tone.
Scottie is the bomb!!
what time did this come out lol
Lil elf 🧝🏾‍♂️✊
Hope they release an instrumental version
A Fcking ART <3
❤️
at 1:50  is that the "UH!!" from GOAT?
It gets better and better. Polyphia is creating an unstoppable musical universe.
Most bands don't have a single virtuoso....this band has 4 lol
FIRE
👍👍👍  Как всегда крутизна!!! Синкопа ëпта рулит😆😉
hxh reference
boa
Maybe it's me coz I'm an old fart but the lyrics sound so detrimental to the rest of the song. All three instrumentalists are killing it and then Lil West comes and says things like "I make it rain like a monsoon". Come one, man, this song deserves better!
Polygon
Scottie with fredrik thorendal ibanez model ! this is epic !
Dope!🍻
Out of all their latest songs this one is the least likable to me. It lacks the technicality that the other ones do.
Kolkata West Bengal India🇮🇳❤
My least favourite track on the album, doesn't mean it doesn't slap though
Did Scott have a codpiece on the schnoz?
The demon back looks like from that in Hannibal Lecter's Red Dragon.
will Lil West be playing his own guitar solo? (writing this before watching the video)
up next polyphia x Country music
Hellll yeah! Crazy how they got all those styles to fuse so damn well!
Oh my, this song is literally soo amazing!! You guys are so talented 👏💝
If they had humor, they should have brought Lil Wayne and make him play the guitar.
Puttin a verse down on a Polyphia tracc.... thats illmatic
Shit goes hard af.
My last favourite super band was The Jimi Hendrix Experience. Now with Polyphia I'm confident that I'm listening to this era's best super band that is out there. Thanks you Polyphia for keeping the music real with passion. I love you all <3
And yes, this will be blasting in my VW golf MK4 for the next weeks.
I don’t know man…none of the vocal features were on polyphia’s level tbh! I get why they’re having these features from a marketing standpoint but musically, different levels man!
awesome! this group is sooo talented!
tell me.. how can u tell me if what genre this song would be? it has mix genre's in 1 song tf! i love rock music but if u add some rap on it like this it will be a hell of a twist! 🔥🔥🔥
This album is a blast to listen to. Incredible performances from everyone.
Espada soundtrack for new bleach
Long time until they release new album, but man it is worth the wait. And this video is just killer.
Ehhhh, I see what they were going for, but this is meh. Trying to cash in on the satanic imagery that producers are pushing these days isn't super original
Am I the only one who got suggested here while listening to the song “Sayo- Ndrangheta “ ??
Polyphia is the new genre
omg
this has a thall vib and mariatchi combined it works so well xD
The song would be 100 times better if you took out lil west and his ridiculous crap he's wearing.
Video isn’t as epic as I’d hoped I mean the demon looks so much better in pink but music is still sick as fck
LFFFGGGGGGGGGGG
How did Lil West's performance enhance this track?   SPOILER: it didn't enhance it at all.
Scott's parts gave me deftones vibes
Glad they're bringing back some of the 8 string sauce 🤘🤘
This song is so good I don't even know what to say! Polyphia just keeps evolving and you can hear it everytime.
I love those 8 string riffs 🤘😤
As usual they’ve simply nailed it again. They slowly fine tuned their music to another level. You’ve got to think what’s next from these guys. And oddly maybe I’m 66 and I get what they’re doing and it’s on point.
I mentioned it in another comment... wonderful to get excited about music again!!!! Listening every day now.... Hoping to travel to Nashville next year to a live show... Thank you guys!!!!
Collab with Avenged Sevenfold, Angel Vivaldi, John 5, or Joe Satriani next! I wanna hear some Evil Sounding Trap :D
So fckn good🔥🎸🎶
My favorite song on the album. The whole thing is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 #POLYFIA4PREZ
Como siempre: TAN DISFRUTABLE 🤘🏼
Wena jiles culiaos
Imagine Polyphia featuring Corpse. Jesus Christ.
Please stop this autotune-shit!
God tier 🔥
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
The detailing on Scott's nose is sending me
This made me realize that I need a Polyphia track with Posty. And it's pretty insane to think that it doesn't even sound that farfetched anymore.
Polyphia bleach arc confirmed
Polyphia has under 1 million subs? Sry, just found out and subscribed.
I'm so happy and proud to be a witness to these younger torch carriers shred the music scene a new hole. 🤘🏾
My brain + My heart = SCREAMING WITHIN SAYING!!! "MORE POLYPHIA!!!!!" 😌
Happy Halloween Boys
awesome
If you didn't know who Lil' West was, you will now. Gonna be great exposure for him!
The fact that it is giving us the (Look but don't touch )vibe
MFrs got to the point where they're playing 8 string guitars
this is the hardest music video of all time
The premiere was a vibe
So sick Tim.. you guys each complement each other’s playing well just all goes Together beautiful 🎃
Hermoso video
What a song, but I'll wait the instrumental version!
Math rap?! Wtf? (It works though!)🙂
Охренительно 😌👍
I've been listening to this non-stop from Luke Holland drumthru, I'm so pumped to see this release! LOVE THIS SONG!
Some says Polyphia brings the same kinda plays in all their songs,meanwhile they put millions of notes in one song and still manage to arrange another vibe...🤘🏼🔥🔥🔥
F'n sick guys!
Hmmm sounds flat to me, drums are way on top. And why are guys still waving their hairs like teengage school girls? Go forward ladies.
polyphia writes thall
At first i was listening it on my phone, but after about 20 secs I was like: time for the speaker ;)
mid
I Can't Resist Thinking about how Similar the Vibe of the Nylon Guitar in this Track is, to that of the Guitar Riff in the intro of the Song BROWN MUNDE...
Another banger!!!! I'm always blown away with this band. Amazing 👏 💯👊🏽🏁🏁🏁
the set looks like Polyphia went to help John Connor with the resistance
Hey next time get someone who can actually rap at the level you're playing your instruments
Why the fuck the prog band plays with the trashiest type of music:trap  Just why
The only thing I hate about this album is it ends and was pretty short.
SANTA MIERDA! Esto es lo mejor que en escuchado en mi vida weonnn!!! Polyphia no puede dejar de brillar en cualquier aspecto, simplemente una joya.  🧡
This beat is so good
SLAYYY
This album feels like a final chapter almost. The old polyphia's almost djent sound combined with the newer catchy riffs based on rap music with a rapper as feature. These guys just keep on giving
Polyphia is unstoppable.
Fkn amazing 🔥
lol the makeup on the rapper is kinda bad but the song is fire as always
Clay looks so hot with that bass and that hair whip No homo
Unless there’s more on the way, I’m surprised this is the one you did the last music video for considering the featured artist isn’t even in the song for a full minute. Memento Mori, FAFO, Bloodbath, even Audacity would have made more sense to me. Not upset or disappointed or anything, just a bit confused.
did it again, goes hard.
Rappers Are going to ruin polyphias amazing music
A caray
Is it possible to remake PMW by Asap with Polyphia? What do ya guys think?
ok ok... I become a fan of Polyphia
Best band on earth
So glad I pre-ordered it :)
I'm getting tired of Tim making me gay!!🤣🤪
The ending to this track is absolutely mind blowing
Probably my favorite track on the album, that opening riff is addictive as hell and the metal meets hip hop vibe comes together so cleanly.
So disappointed it’s nu metal rap crap.
🍻🔥🔥🔥
My favourite of the tracks with guest vocals on the album - this is how rap metal always could/should have been!
can we just take a minute to appreciate how GROOVY scotties writing is!
Fuck yes!!
please still be the polyphia i fell in love with.. you guys are one of a kind.
Tim Henson is the most genius guitarist in the world, the first time I saw his guitar playing I was blown away!
As an old fart, who likes bends in his guitar playing, I must say this was not bad at all. Beautiful video by the way, kudos to the artistic director!
The epitome of music is Polyphia
FODAA DEMAISS PICA TA??? ELES SAO PICA !!!
This new hip-hop/R&B Polyphia is definitely not my jam. Pass.
Absolute fire song
Always so amazing!!!
woowowowwwww    niceeee
0:47 why they didn’t use this beat for the rap blows my mind. Pretty fire song otherwise though.
I thought the music video was going to explain why there were car noises in this track...  but apparently not. 😅🚗
The whole city on 🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
Goksssss 🍻
amazing
Hello you are super duper bro 😎
slaps
Fuaaaaaa que obra de arte 100000/10🤩
Yo! Def one of my fav tracks off of Remember That You Will Die. Glad we got a music video for it.
3:35 even in 2022 the nose jokes still live on 🤣🤣
Amazing polyphia  This is extreme❤️❤️
god
Fuckin LIT🔥
are they in the upside down
vile satanic clip from vile satanic band
such good drum lines that Luke wrote, I don't really notice anythign changed between what he did and what Clay does in this song
Chimera 🕷️🕷️🕷️
Autotune: the cancer of the music.
I love this, hands down, 3rd best song on the album :)
This band just gets better and better.
Is this this track on the new album? I hope so since it kicks a monkeys @$$!! Soooo good!!! Keep killing it lads!!
Is...Scottie wearing a nose shield?
This song has been better then befores. Becoz drum rythms are more minimal end complement. I like this. Bass rythms even then.
When can I get a video for THE AUDACITY? 😏
Dope , I was recommended here while listening to the song “Sayo- Ndrangheta “ ✊✊
Pffff 🤯
This is very polyphia
заебись, охуенно, круто, заебись
🖤
That was so amazing. 😀👍👌 Love from Norway 🇳🇴
Scottie playing the Murshuhgur sig like a lord!
Surreal
Why ruin it with rap?.
Flamenco inspired riffs 👍 Lyrics 🤢  Glad y'all are trying new things and pushing the boundaries though. Growth isn't always comfortable. Hope there's some good ole instrumentals in the mix as well.
Remember the times when polyphia's drums were not overdone and sounded well with much simpler rhythms? You know when the drummer didn't hit every 16th of a beat? Yeah... I miss those times.
You wanna know how I know polyphia has made it? All 4 of my young daughters dig them, they all groove and dance to their music like crazy.
Now I want to hear the next album with the other collabs, and I only learned about them like two months ago. Good timing I guess haha.
Vibes 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sweet video!!
This song is like when main character work his ass off before fighting final boss
😩👌
Damn that tone is sick!
Not the nose mask 💀🤣
Vildhjarta?
cool
Foda demais <3
the whole band really got to shine on this album and it sounds incredible
YES!
Polyphia finally getting the attention they need lately 🔥🔥🔥🤘
A master piece kinda ruined starting at 2:36. Any suggestions for a piece of software to remove vocals? or is there an instrumental version?
Man I hope they drop another full band playthrough but of The Audacity this time 🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞
Polyphia, not only making Guitars relevant again but re-inventing the art of shredding.
These guitars are looking more and more like heavy metal band logos
Awesome!!
😎
Holy shit you guys
omfg this is the most beauty album of all
Praying god to someday I achieve to create a genre like them, I just insanely love their music, I made a lot o music inspired on polyphia on my channel, but is nothing compare with their master pieces
I can dig how they made it basically half instrumental and then changed gear halfway through, yet kept the same, but a different vibe. \m/
The guitar parts are OK,.. but great drummer!! 😁🤪
SURABAYA APA KABAR
yo scott nose hhh cool
1:46 dun look at me la'dat Clay 🤤
es una genialidad esto
..okay we are seeing the history beeing made.
This looks like it was directed by Robert Eggers holy shit.
Never have I listened to a metal track that made me want to throw it back
Those guitars are getting more and more gorgeous
sounds so freakin good damnit.
i am trying to figure out whats going on with the creature at the back 🤔
Damn!!
Sheeesh🎃
.-.
Now we have to get Yellow Submarine lmao
Bro this is no trust mixed with o.d and look but don’t touch
this shit is nutty frrl
Surely polyphia could find a much better rapper than this
🔥🔥🔥
I just missed the entire video because I didn't read the title, thinking it was just an audio visualizer. 😢
Nice noir
Are Tim's and Scott's guitars and Gober's bass signatures? They are pretty unique. Aeshliman makes great use of his kit! Rap works really well with Polyphia's style.  Edit: Why isn't Lil West wearing a costume?
Per CDC regulations, that type of mask does not protect you from post-apocalyptic airborne debris
Lil west is dressed like my shadowrun character 😳
I love how unique and out there their soundstyle is. Meshes together so well.
polyphia is getting better and better, i bet they will one day be known as the best prog band
One thing I love about this band is the fact that they're very consistent. A major issue I've had with metal bands over the years is inconsistency and poor social media presence
War
it remind me the video from Woodkid Pale Yellow in your video where you hand and guitar stopped, it would be unimaginably cool if it was done in an 3D art sort of face/guitar figure where the other part of that is the shining thing on your face, it is soooo cool just by imagining it. Great songs, many love to Polyphia, thanks for keep going and making real music for the world.
Fucking awesome
Good to see that Thall still lives in your DNA 🤘🏻🎸
If you guys ever feature Vicente Amigo it'll be the sickest thing ever. So compatible it's insane
I prefer the visualizer version better tbh 😶
can't get enough polyphia baby
Для меня это лучшая работа Полифии For me this is the best work of Polyphia
I lov you!
Awesome video 👍 Love Scotties guitar!! 😁
GUITAR SHRADING, DRUM KILLING, BASS HITTING, *vrum...*vrum... RAP
Every song with lyrics has the cringiest lyrics. Polyphia don’t quit your day job stick to the music lul
Bass tone is nuts
For me... This song it the best with Ego death and Playing god  Thanks you polyphia for your innovation! 🤟🏼
OMG the composition ❤️ is out of this Universe 🎴
Scottie using Fredrik Thordendal's (Meshuggah) signature is something I didn't know I needed
Man Scottie straight up killed it on this album all his guitar parts are killer
Musically brilliant. Crazy expressive, intricate, melodic and every listen through I find new things to enjoy….  …..then the vocals come in. Lil West is a fine artist, no doubt. And this is just my opinion, but rap lyrics, so often is the case, are so generic. They can be lifted and put into any song. I feel like it’s no different here, and it ruins what I feel is an otherwise expressive composition.    Not hating on Lil West, it’s just my opinion.
this reminds me of acoustic vs electric by marcin and ichiko. so you know im putting them one after the other on my playlists. lol
Love it! The video is insane!!!
This video is like the worst from all, I think, but is still pretty sick, also Scott has that V guitar with the decoration and looks nice!
please tim, give me  a child
failed NNN after hearing the riff 😔
\m/ ♥
We all live on a Sussy Submarine
Plus whats up with all the Satanic Imagery now? Sell ya'll soul to the devil for this fame or what????
