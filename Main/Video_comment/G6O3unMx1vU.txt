Before commenting understand that deliberately exploiting is cheating, not a tip
Also if you want to get rid of any useless items just drop or throw them in fireplace it will burn away in few seconds.
proo tip for hayseed as a npc,. i found that he not only good at just farming, he is an amazing cook and will cook up some decent food for you if you set him as a cook
Biggest tip, if you find dynamite barrels, bring them to base...
I go ahead and make an upgraded bench and lumber mill in my cave, along with chests and I mine and fill all the chests and craft more tools as needed.  Granted I'm only into the grassland caves, but it does make it more convenient to get all the mining out of the way and carrying home what you need.  What you can't carry, just go back and grab as needed. Might not work as well I'm the other caves with the dynamite throwing and all
To get fortnite Lego
The bubbles on for next
My tip is • Do NOT build in the beginning where your just in grassland and snow. If you build there you’ll start hiring and finding out you need to release your villagers because you have the capacity of 15 villagers. • Find a line between Deserts, grassland and snow.  • Built in between Desert, Grassland, and the Snow.
building a base next to a cave helps because trees grows out of it
easy solution for gliding post build a tower with 2 tall post and dynamic floor switch and a rocket under it
They need to add bigger backpack, so you can have as many items as you can in your backpack.
From my son: Bye
H😮😮😮😮
Hell nah
And my 2 if sons have a headset
🎉🎉🎉
My 2 sons have a ps5 and they are playing it right now haha
I love thiss
They should really add a little damage bonus for a jump attack that would be nice👌
the only village job that isn’t working for me is the smelter 😭 I crafted 2 for 2 villagers and they haven’t produced anything only says they are 32% done and sometimes the % changes
Never thought I'd have to make a report like this - If you haven't looked at your Lego game settings, you should change the game to Invite Only as someone who I had let onto my friends list but never really spent time playing with and they tried to steal resources from my camp and one of my caves - when I kicked them they had a backpack FULL of my resources directly from my camp storage and they had destroyed beds for my villagers and they nearly left my camp and they added their own bed in my house.
our base is right by the desert and the snow. maybe 5 min run either way and you are there. its super nice. we are going to build a railway system above ground to get anywhere.
Bones are not useless lmao
Sorry dude, your tips mean nothing. I got the best seed in the game, all these were basically given to me hand over fist
if yall find a way to stack items in chests let a brother know cuz its annoying af
Took me 40 minutes running around to find the dessert just to die as soon as i find it
Jesus that world is UGLY as sin
I'm just waiting for villages in cave
Map: desert is clearly west Aura: go south
Ty I am downloading Lego Fortnite but I’ve never played Fortnite before
Not the 20,000 grills. Just build!
Who wants to join my server on friday
Honestly I Love Valheim but my homies lack the Patience and Big brain for it so I always join them in this Lego mode and Im Ngl I’m equally as Hooked
Thanks for your content. best video at there. Made me want to play way more. I was just lost before. Now I found a purpose 😂
511924 is the best seed
HOW do you turn off the environmental drama? I’m FRRRRREEZING and can’t get anything done in the snow!
There is @Andrew11707 that has used clips of your video for a short that got 16k likes  (I’m posting it here because it’s kinda bad to copy :< )
I personally think temp don’t matter as much,but stam will literally make you op in the beginning bc u can just outrun most early in things like wolves
Stamina bar is important, when youre flying with a glider, it consumes your stamina while up in the air, by the time you run out, you will drop from fall damage and die.
So do you need to actually start a new world after world just to find a map with desert/superior enviromnent? Or is everything still available no matter what world you end up in at random? I just started building up a village but need to know if it's all for nothing LOL
Had to walk for an hour to find a desert. Ended up just making a whole new village near the desert. Sucks lol
Got 3 blast cores last night and my inventory was full while i was mining obsidian and i meant to drop like 2 marble which was right next to my blast core and i ran all the way to my base which is near the snow biome and i realized i dropped the blast cores🥲

I was trying for like 30 mins to get of this cliff in a cave and never thought to build… I come to the conclusion that you need a charm for higher jump or somthing like that 😂
Make glider , build staircases 11 high. Make platform and u now got a jump pad that will take u way further then the geysers and as soon as I land I build another one so I can basically do the whole map under 10 mins instead of an hour lol I even put a marker on every staircase jump pad so I know the direction they follow back to back , helps tons on the map
Destroying bushes is actually easier with a sword
Man, this was one of the coolest surprises of the year.  I've always thought a minecraft style game in the lego world would be awesome.  Who'd have thought it would be fortnite to do it
Do you need to be a level 10 village to make another village?
You can use brutes to farm flexwood since their attacks break everything in its path it really boosted my run
i spawned near a snowy biome, but i have yet to find the desert 😭😭
*YOU’RE ON TRENDING*
I have a seed where you spawn in plains by a cave beside a snowy mountain and dry valley with a dry valley cave exactly when you enter
Now way you have the same seeed as me
Destroying bushes is actually easier with a sword
My npc’s are not spawning,even when I upgrade my village
Ya know verlis I've been following for quite some time as I've never been a subscriber I was around when all of the Pokemon things where going on. Great too see ya going onto better things though! Thanks for the content bud keep it up.
you don't have to have 100 work benches, just build your village, add houses, storage buildings, use furniture in your houses and your level will get there before you even have the materials to upgrade.
I found the perfect map spawned in grass land and takes like  2 min to run to the snowy part or the dessert part. Love this survival mode tbh
I spawnd with all the biops 100 m from spawn
Use swords instead of axes for bushes
My village rating glitches from level 8 to level 5 from destroying a staircase I used to help me build a shack
Has anyones leader disappear? Mine just completely vanished before even upgrading to lvl 4 on my 2nd world and on my first they’re still there after lvl 10 village, anyone know what to do when the leader disappears?
how do you turn off temp and stanima
I have a glitch that my first npc was hired by a random friend and when he left, she says she still busy and I can’t get her to do anything
Can you turn off the stamina meter anytime? Or must it be changed when creating the world?
how do you have so many hearts
If your weapon durability is low you can put your weapon in the chest and then destroy the chest and then your weapon durability is full on your weapons that were in the chest
I just wish you could destroy tools.  Hate picking up a basic pickaxe on accident and having to drop it
im the type of person who gives every work station its own house
Bro yesterday I just went on one trip and found the desert 😂
Really Fantastic Synopsis and Tips. You nailed it! I would add:  -Build Your First Village at the Edge of a Desert Border AND Near a Knotwood cave, NOT where you spawn into the game. Make your life easier and everything more efficient! -Build a Bed at the Mouth of a Cave as a Save Point. If you die, you respawn in your bed; you won't have to travel back to your quest point. -Empty almost ALL of your Backpack before beginning a Quest. You'll need the inventory slots. -Pack for a trip! MAX Wood Planks to build Repair Chests, Cooked Food, Snowberry Shakes or Cheesy Burgers
My seed 2135 has a desert really close just head east maybe a little south east. Loads of good caves too. Got lvl 8 village in like a day lol
Please make a perfect loadout to get that many hearts
I’m gona chuck this in the comments DONT VISIT THE SNOW AREA FIRST IT COMES AFTER THE DESERT I got one shot by a snow roller I had 9 hearts and 9 defense and it insta broke my shield
Can i build multiple villages?
Wow Verlis been a while since I've seen your channel! Hopefully lego fortnite can help you pull the viewers you deserve
People should care little moee about astetics in a crafting game bacuse your shit looks like a crack shed
You’re lucky - the desert is a 10 minute run away from my spawn point and that’s with infinite stamina.  However, the cold biome is 2 steps away
Bro don't be like, " I don't want to build this, I don't want to build that... You must explore everything, we are here to see that, if you see something new, build it.
I build stair ramps from my base towards snow and desert so i can get there faster with the glider. Ive almost explored my whole map already 😂
i noticed when you broke your grill the village points didn't go down, so technically ig you could just place down a crap ton of grills, lumber mills, work benches, etc. then destroy them to get the materials back and do it again and again
Anyone else experiencing a chest glitch like me and my friends put stuff in chest its there but not visible except to like 2 of us
I made different safe boxes for different materials
Traveling is underrated fun ngl, the nearest cave for me was small, but i found another one a bit down and… oh boy… its on the lizzo scale
How can you disable the temperature meters??
I never had villagers from the start in my world which is now very advanced so I don’t wanna restart I’ve left and rejoined several times, is there something I have to do to get the villagers to come?
Don’t just throw away tools that you don’t use. Use a villager as a follower and you can give them those tools and they will use it. They can hold multiple tools and just swap to the best one depending on the situation.
Bro me and my friend died with so much good stuff and we are now spawning in the middle of nowhere and what what seems like infinitely far away from home base and from our backpacks.I don’t know why this happened. We got full reset 💀.
Underrated channel
something I always do with the spare pickaxes is give it to one designated adventuring villager and whenever I need to collect granite I take that villager and start going at some rocks. unfortunately they still use the pickaxes for fighting even over axes, even tho the brown pickaxe does less damage per second compared to just punching, so keep that in mind if ur messing about in the dark with them
Imagine not having a skin. L bozo 😂😂😂
7:56 cracked me up, I have an entire green chest of bones 🫠 Great video! Very helpful!
I have stairways to heaven all across the map as jump points. I end up re using them constantly
The loot in the chests ist mostley trash
I built the garage from pleasant park and put like over 10 chests in it as a storage area for my food materials and junk like feathers claws and what not. Even a weapons chest
The way i get the sand shells is by using a shield and getting one of my villagers to follow me. That way my follower can get the attention and i can go ham for the shells. And the shield helps if the randomly start going for you
I found dry valley like 5 mins away from my village shit was stressful af
How do you get a glider
How do you stay warm when your in the cold
Where do I get amber ( I don't got a blue axe so I can't cut it )
Why are your beds outside?
does anyone know how to move brite bomber? i started my village away from the spawn point and she doesnt follow me
My favourite seed is 9 9s
Don't make a bunch of crafting stations, just build the pre made homes, thats all you have to do to level up the village
i learned more from this video than my 4 years of highschool
I love to make a village stylish and neat, it is the most important thing! 😊
Everything dies in the water, I have a ton of brute scales cuz they just like to spawn next to water
Go on top of moutains that have large trees, cut them down, roll the log down to farm granite and wood super easy
Where did you get the cheese 🧀 to make the pizza ?🍕
I'm pretty sure your wrong about the pickaxe against the rollers. Sword does more damage... I think. 🤔
Swords can one tap bushes.
How do you disable temperature and the stamina meter
I was looking for a dessert for 2 hours and made it to the edge of the map
2:52 it works on brute’s also I have 4 just from drowning it in early game
Omg it took me 3hours the other night to find the desert
You can also build campfires inside of caves instead of using torches , yes it costs more wood however it’ll light up the cave for you so it’s easier to find whatever your looking for
If you find a boulder on a hill and you need mats just push the boulder down hill towards whatever you need and it’ll destroy everything for you
i plotted a village on the seed 69420 on a weird granite platform near the spawn area and all my villagers kept getting stuck and i couldnt communicate with any of them. tried restarting the world a ton of times and they are still stuck there, any help?
What do we do when we get bored of the map we are currently playing lmaoo
One thing I like about the prefab builds is they're modular; You can knock out the walls on a double shack and replace them with Shack Doors to create passible outbuildings. Biggest building issue I've had is there doesn't seem to be a way to change the elevation of your non-prefab Foundations, making it hard to keep things at the same level.
Hey I have a question. What if I leave cuddle bear leader? Can the other villagers tell me where to go
There's no shame in playing this game without the stamina/temperature meters.  😊
I let the Dragons farm for me just keep dodging and let them destroy the environment
I just kept running to see what i would fing then build aroun a dessert a plains and snowy mountains a little further away
Its good to stack lumber mills, it makes crafting so much quicker
I just pressed the vid so idk if it’ll answer my question or not. What is that big crate thing you find at the pillagers area?
How is your health so high ?
All my villagers randomly disappeared, did this happen to anyone else and how can I resolve it?
I have the best seed because I spawned right next to the ice and I can see the desert so yay
I broke my village square and placed a new one but now my villagers won’t work for me anymore I can only choose for the explorer button even tho my village is lvl 9…
How can I fix the glitch where I can’t build in a certain spot?
I've played it some. Gets pretty boring pretty quick.
What if i upgrade my workbench and break it? What happens? Cause id like to upgrade / change my base.. but im afraid to lose all the upgrades i made to it if i break it
No villagers come to my base any idea why not?
for me rn traveling is the main issue, it cant be that u have to walk 10 mins just to get to a cave once u mined the 2 caves kinda nearby your village or walk 20 mins to the next dessert just so you can die bcs u didnt know that the mobs there are way stronger
Yo Verlis, do you have plans on getting into DragonQuest Monsters: The Dark Prince? The PvP competitive scene is almost entirely dominated by the Japanese player base and it’d be interesting to see you climb the ranks.
Bones are not useless
can you bring villagers out exploring with you?
I lost my team leader. Anyone know how to get it back?
what’s your world seed
Destroying bushes is actually easier with a sword
throw meat and move out of vision. Crabs will spawn
also sand crab can spawn in coastlines aswell as sand wolves
When the NPC's are glitching out like that, then try talking to them first.  If that doesn't work, then continue doing what you're doing
Lego griddy
Any clue what the Tiger NPC is ? She near me base and one was one of the first things I briefly stopped to look at until I shining object that led me to a llama popped up
Cool to see you making Lego Fortnite content. ❤️
