RIP TAKE
Words cannot explain how much I LOVE this song! … In the mix, it is a VIBE, but at the core it is a representation of what 3 or more souls could accomplish, coming together as one to create a masterpiece! I can feel the bond, I can feel the vibe and I can feel the togetherness…. Sadly, those are the things that I will miss the most when it comes to this group. But I do believe that individually, each artist has the ability to shine and has the potential to become a major force in the music industry. My prayers to your success 🙏🏽 in Jesus name.
Rip take😢

My heart continues to be saddened when i see or hear about  this young man  on my phone or wherever.  My mother  and i are both elderly  women.  As we sat and listened to  the wonderful things that  people  in Atlanta ga  had to say , other elderly people.  They  talked about  how humble  he was and  respectful.  We talked and wondered  why would you  killed someone  who doesn't  bother  anyone.   What kind of mindset do  you have to be that evil and  demonic to lure this young  man and set him up to be murdered.  God said in his word that he  hates hands that shed innocent  BLOOD AND THAT VENGEANCE IS MINE SAITH THE LORD  GOD OF HOST, I WILL  REPAY.  SLEEP NOW K. K. BALL💙💙💙🩵🩵🩵💙💙💙💔😞

this music isnt my type of music but Migos has to be one of the greatest characters/trio to modern day rap. people be impersonating too much that they forget to be themselves. imo, new rap has flow like Migos but again.. there can never be another Migos.

Boomba🎉
BIG RIP TAKEOFF 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This song is telling you how they sacrifice to get in the industry 🌈
turn to Jesus Christ he loves all of us more than anything and he literally died for us. He took in the punishment for our sins thru  on the cross. It wasn’t cuz we deserved it, but cuz he loved us. 1 John 4:10 “This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins” it was thru his love that he died for us and we can be forgiven
Rip man
Takeoff 🤲🤲🤲🙏🙏🙏

What distinguish from Lamar from Drake. Lamar is a real, authentic artistist , about he's tatlent. A precise crafted skill for example Tupac, Jay z ect and others. Drake is one of those studio artists thats very fictitiously,  👉 a actor playing a role
Better than anything the Migos put out
NOOOO TAKEOFF 🛫 R.I.P💔😔

Hey there! I really enjoyed this video, and I think it would be fantastic to see some talented artists from the Philippines like EZ Mil, Hev Abi or Loonie featured here. Their unique music style and storytelling would be a great addition to the content. It would be amazing to see a collaboration with them in the future😊
Unfair….😓😭❤️🚀

Migo gunners out the jungle 🌲🌴🐅🐯🐻😅 💓 🚨 lol
Takeoff verse is what sets the tone and straight fire. Quavo absolutely took the song where it needed to go. I can listen to this 100 times a day and do 200 the next
TAKEOFF😇😇😇😇🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Take off not being here real hurts. He so talented
We miss you TAKEOFF 😭😭
Damn Chris brown was right. Takeoff was the better rapper but their energies mesh together. Quavo by himself might not pull it off on his own or maybe he will ❤ but the energy with takeoff was different  And offset   They all blend nicely
Fml… everyone of this genre sounds exactly the same. I’d rather just hear their instrumentals but at that point it wouldn’t even be the same person.
Rip🙏🏾🙏🏾
Tough!
*CHRIS BROWN vs QUAVO* 😂😂😂😂😂
rip the goat.
"Everybody really wished it was you instead...."
Quavo really trash lol it shud've been him fr fr lol
Mumble mumble mumble. No thanks.

Rip takeoff 😢
The way Rakim changed the way rappers put there words and change the cadence,is the same thing Takeoff did for Rap.
How couldve they called this music?
No cap this song still 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Long live takeoff
That first verse hit, then it was down hill from there
Take-off 🎉
Let's get it.🔥
Just why 😢 Hurts so much watching people walking around alive and stuff, while one of the most precious souls to ever walk the planet in my lifetime is gone 😢 I didn't really support their music outside of a few songs, but man oh man..... When I watched them on Carpool Karaoke with James Cirbin(sp) I freaking feel in love with Takeoff. The energy he gave was unbelievable 😊 He made me smile every time he would put in a bit of feedback 😊 If you ever watch the interview you will see that he truly was THE MIGOS 💪🏽 He never needed the other 2.  They needed him.  From the beginning  and excelled because of him. Darn it......This one hurts really bad 😢
I'm mad Take only got 1 verse 😠🙏🏿
Why is nobody saying rip. Nobody care or know takeoff died incredibly sus… his own family set him up. Nobody cares
Underrated
Allons-y Descendons d'un bus de seize passagers C'est un G5, non, ce n'est pas une voiture de défi J'ai quelques membres avec moi et les folles prennent des sièges de classe économique Ce sont des cannibales Ils aiment devenir défoncés, boire une bouteille entière, se réveiller et recommencer Elle a pris un peu de chut, mélangé avec le calme Maintenant, elle dit qu'elle voit en 3D Je vais dans la jungle et je n'ai pas de manteau Je parie que je vais en sortir avec un vison Je fais ça pour la famille, parce que c'est plus grand que moi Des pierres colorées dans mon maillon d'infini et dans le chef-d'œuvre de l'usine Je l'appelle jumeau car c'est mon frère, on a la même Rolex, il me fait écho Non, sérieusement De l'eau sur moi comme dans un sauna Certains carats, certains indices Toutes ces virgules, je ne vais pas trébucher Les Migo Gunna sortent de la jungle Achète tout, nique une avance et Tu ne peux pas me dire que je ne suis pas sincère La capote en bas me fait sentir comme un sensationnel Ne joue pas, ne cours pas, on y va Portefeuille Chrome Heart, fume mon pilote, prends trois vibes vers les tropiques Les négros n'étaient rien, j'étais dehors à servir des narcotiques Revendiquant ce bâton, et a fait un mauvais mouvement, je l'ai juste flingué Mettons ça sur le dos de mon pote avec la prostituée inondée dans le hall de l'hôtel  Les diamants dansent comme Bobby Ne le touche pas, ce flingue est arrogant Champignon et G6, la fête, on y va Les filles vont être à la mode, je suis le sujet La façon dont je débarque, je vais le faire éclater, aucun de ces négros ne va m'arrêter Mets cette goutte, prends une tasse pour la goutte Je suis un putain de robinet Baisse-toi, continue à empiler, ton compte en banque va grossir Jamais je ne jetterai de l'ombre sur aucun négro (je suis têtu) Petit négro, ne joue pas avec ces négros Je vois le tableau d'ensemble, on est au-dessus de ces négros Le Huncho, c'est celui que tu vas appeler, mec Je t'ai dans le dos, tu peux tomber sur moi, mec Quand on se relève, on va éclater ces négros On fout tout en l'air parce qu'on bat le système, c'est parti De l'eau sur moi comme dans un sauna Certains carats, certains indices Toutes ces virgules, je ne vais pas trébucher Les Migo Gunna sortent de la jungle Achète tout, nique une avance, mec Tu ne peux pas me dire que je ne suis pas sincère La capote en bas me fait sentir comme un sensationnel Ne joue pas, ne cours pas, on y va Portefeuille Chrome Heart, fume mon pilote, prends trois vibes vers les tropiques Les négros n'étaient rien, j'étais dehors à servir des narcotiques Revendiquant ce bâton, et a fait un mauvais mouvement, je l'ai juste flingué Mettons ça sur le dos de mon pote avec la prostituée inondée dans le hall de l'hôtel

RIP takeoff😪🤧
🎵🎵
still missing take! ❤
🚀
Catchy song. I wish they had a broader vision tho. Rappers aspire to competence and even excellence; they want to be lords of their world. But their world is dealing drugs, that is their instrument, and their goal is money and women. Lords of a mud castle, that's the scope of their imagination.
rip
Quavo very nice, takeoff rest in peace 😢
rip take, we love you dawg
RIP
Is take off the one on the left or right ?
Damn takeoff😢
Rest in Paradise, Takeoff…
What the Hell type of Satanic bullshit are they mumbling in that first 16 seconds?
Love your spirit #takeoff

I sincerely ADORE a simple beat like this. Rest Easy Takeoff.❤ & ✌️
RIP TAKEOFF🚀🖤🖤
Ni parece que partió de este mundo R.I.P Takeoff 💔
"not gonna try anything with shoeonhead" probably the best decision you've made in a while Jersh. The last thing you need now is a relationship with a YouTuber with a bigger sub count than yourself, which you don't often react well too. Fantastic set of teeth and seems to be good at self-deprecating humour, of which we all know Jersh loves a lil laugh at his expense. She's a stunner 2bf. (and thats the long and short of it😂)
This is what it do
I wonder what the distorted message said at the beginning🤔
Where k.p.
quavo for life
R.i.P. miss you❤
Это наши уйгуры да?)
Quá hay
RIP TAKEOFF 😢
Seeing these two, remind me of versace. That song made me a migos fan. RIP Takeoff.
Just love these guys... Sick song

Takeoff was underrated... Check how much of the song is Quavos in comparison, yet Takeoffs 30 second part ends up being much better in my opinion (most social media post using this song uses Takeoffs part)
"Na for Real".............

That's crazy how QUAVO paid for the hit on TAKEOFF. TAKEOFF was a threat to QUAVO's number one spot in the group. Now QUAVO got that number one spot with no threats in sight. Well played my man! This chess not checkers and it's business y'all, not personal. Congratulations to QUAVO! TAKEOFF had to go and he was expendable and in the way, those are the facts.

Legendary
الي جايين من التيك توك صفو جنبي 😂🫡♥️
I really could go ahead and end the track after Takeoff, but I go ahead and let it play. Both should have had equal time on the track, but for some reason, Quavos verses were longer. On Tik tok, they only use Takeoffs verse. I like it that way
good 👍
It’s the orange for me
Yeah quavo you shouldn't have played with them n*****. This is what happens when you act too gangster. You didn't catch the play and Yeah you did fumble on this one. He made one wrong move and he popped it
thank god they made this before take off died
Le démarrage de takeoff est légendaire
Rip the realest migo to do TAKEOFF🚀🙏🏾
R.i.p take off
Ríp takeoff 😥😥😫
Sad Takeoff will never see any of the profits from this, I mean it's doubled in views since he was killed. Shame.
I pretty sure he said “follow me” r u sure he says “fall on me”?? And the way Quavo puts his hands up like “come on”
Rest in piece my brother 🙏😎❤️
this beat is better : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDXjB_AYkQQ
Miss you takeoff........

0:26 What does that mean???
If just one person read this, it will honestly make my day. I am a guitarist, songwriter and I know people write this all the time but I believe I’ll be the one you’ll be happy to listened to. I do all my songs and my videos by myself and I make a new music video every week with my guitar. If one person could give this a thumbs up, you’ll be one step closer to helping a musician’s dreams come true. You won’t be disappointed. Just give one chance and 3 minutes of your time. Thank you 🙏🙏🏿 🇨🇦🎶🎶💫🌍🎸🎸☘️🎸🎸🎶🎶🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🎶🎶😇💯🌞🙏🏿🙏🏼💯💯💯🔥🇨🇦🇨🇦

How J Prince Speaking Up More When He Was'nt There! Let Mike $ Jr Speak
I love Migo, I swear I do. I been a fan since No Label but it’s funny to me, that this is prolly the one song on here that sounds reversed at the beginning. I don’t ever think I’ve heard a Migo song start off like this and “mysteriously” TakeOff is Gone.
RIP to the best Migo

RIP TAK OFF  TT
🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️
Quavo sound so good without autotune
Rip take off your the best rapper of the group
21 savage would be murder this beat
I think they killed Tupac twice <>> Why killing all the Gemini rappers ??" June 18 and June 16 <>Lord have mercy! 😞
A very quite young man who is so much talented just died because of some fools who can not control themselves if you don't know how to control yourself why have a weapon in your hands in the first place.Those goons who killed takeoff must serve prison time if possible they should get the maximum sentence.
Rip to
Forever my favorite group, Migos🫶🏾
Love you 😘😘
The chemistry they had is just amazing to watch ☯️
So I guess they want to do a 2 pac Jr narrative
"make one wrong move, just pop him." Yes they did
Rip take off💭😞
Which one is quavo and which one is takeoff?
She seeing in 3D DAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMM BOOOOYYYYYYYYYY
I hate the industry always taking someone from us

2:08 Look how sassy the dude is.
Take wrote for quavo, prove me wrong
💔💔🎗🥺😭
What language is Quavo reciting right before the beat drops? Right before he starts dancing? Sounds demonic, especially with him saying it directly at Takeoff while his head is down. Weird.
For me take didn't die🧠
BIG ONE ❗❗❗

RIP...! Takeoff 🙏🥺🥺🥺😢😥😓 like yes  I ❤️ love 👆

Quavo slid on this song!!! They were going to make monumental moves as a duo.  GA is know for having legendary duos. Take will surely be missed
Rip legend 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Take and Quavo str8 floated on this beat. LL 🚀
RIP Takeoff. This is why black people hate other black people the most. We take out our own always plus us fighting each other daily.  Fact: Wealthy Africans went to villages and captured other Africans and made them into slaves and then sold them to the whites during the beginning of time. Blacks invented slavery.
❤️🕊️takeoff
Repeat
On real lyrics cold I fuckin love it yeah yeah yeah yeah
Why wasn't offset in the vid?
This wasss a banger before he passed il be honest I didn't rate them, this song I can understand
Takeoff is so good
This is so unreal smh... RIP 🚀🚀
Even if you don't like rap I want you to look me in the face and tell me the first 30 seconds of this song Don't go hard AF
Takeoff was always the best lyricist. Every 3 or 4 songs he would drop bars like these where you just have to respect the cadence, rhythm, and substance of the words themselves (he's not just putting words together, hes painting a scene). In many ways Quavo was the face, Offset was the muscle and Takeoff was the heart.
Over dice. Damn shame
RIP take😭😭
Quavo really love takeoff u see how he hypes him up while he spitting his verse.
These boy soooo in tune with each other R.I.P BRO
“Now she say she see in 3D !!!”
Rip takeoff ahead of his time
They created the style. They created their own ERA.
i just realized the mike is fake
Every day I start to realize the power we lost

Saw Charles that day faith a year later time for us
On drugs faith

Rip takeoff
Takeoff is my favorite Migo. He fuckin ripped this and Qua is always the ultimate closer. Straight 🔥. Rip 🙏 Takeoff Rap in peace.
This album gave us the whole of Takeoff damn😍😍😍
They complimented each other well rip takeoff😢
descansa en paz takeoff
Let go ✊✊✊✊✊✊👍👍👍👍👍✊✊✊✊✊✊
RIP takeoff  navždy v srdcích !!!!!!!
Takeoff is a good lyricist RIP
Anytime I heard a migos song I always looked forward to hearing takeoff’s verse . R.I.P. mega loss
Orange is my favorite color. This one is extra special 🙏
Miss you bro
Ayoooo takeoff , I still rock my true religion too
Tak off RIP ♥♥♥
Rip Takeoff🕊💔
Why unc got on Halloween colors? Hmmm.  We luv you TAKEOFF!  ❤️‍🩹💝
A lot of Albanians listen to this
This beat go hard af! Rip takeoff
Takeoff deserves his flowers but Quavo is the truth for me. His voice, cadence, style is why they usually have him as the closer. This song no exception...
R.I.P T
Nah RIP Take ♥️
Gone but not forgotten Take ,your Legacy will live forever😭😭😭#legends dont die actually they REST ..
I've never hurt of this rapper his flow soft af! RIP  G!!!!
Long live takeoff ❤️🕊LEGENDS NEVER DIE🚀
Rip Takeoff 💔💔💔💔
Love how only Quavo throwing up Satan Signs. 👁 👌🏿  🤟🏿. Before anyone says conspiracy, please look into the history of Satanism, the Enochian language. Read into Albert Pike, and understand that the world is more than just fun, games and people doing random things with their bodies. Symbols have always ruled man. Example one cave drawings, example two hieroglyphs, example three emojis, example four social media. Energy rules the world! Why you think take off the only one to ever talk about speaking with God for real, he prays. Offset n Quavo always been bought by that bag, and bout themselves . Everyone has their struggles, Takeoff with his drugs and women, Pray he got saved. Overall ! GOD WINS. Rest In Peace, Takeoff Gang 🦾
Had me at…”let’s get it” 🙏
RIP Take off 🌑☄️💥
That's 🔥fire
"Let's get it"  I love how Qua raps in this song.
I'm a lyrics type of guy and I love this song but.. glocky be cocky 🤣 that's just stupid! RIP Takeoff.
Their voice is in reverse in the beginning.. somebody decipher it and see what they're saying
Rip takeoff 🙏
Obviously everything talked about in this video was bullshit because takeoff isn't here anymore 😒
The beat the lyrics 💥🔥 R.I.P. #TakeOff 😇🚀 They slept on U now woke 💔😭
Quavo stay strong bro live for the legacy..Don't get involved in some dumbshit ..Tired of losing great ones so early..
I'm so devastated I can't believe he gone

Long Live Takeoff ✊🏾
R.I.P TakeOff! Am very sorry for it beacuse TakeOff is/was the best in Migos .. His Freestyle is legendary
Quavo dancing like the church praise team when they Come o u t with the flags
Repeat repeat
On real
On real
I love it on real hood just like that
You are the best Tupac net
Rest in Peace Takeoff. He always seemed like such a good dude, very sad to see something like that happen to him.
I like this a lot  their style is unique!, i just noticed that one of the members of MIGOS started in the netflix series ''NARCOS''.
Feeling vibe ☺️
Hurts when you grew up with them watching these guys come up do shows make it big. Being the same age it’s tuff. Praying for quavo and the whole family. 🕊️
Takeoff is really trapfloow
Dedicated to the 🇬🇭 soccer team that game was awesome!
Literally don't know what slid the most take verse...the adlibs or the quavos moves 😂😂😂  Rip take!
what are those earbuds they wearing? look fire
They didn't need Offset they could carry a hit on their own. Quavo went ballistic and he killed this track RIP Takeoff you were a legend 🙏🏾
When take said Nah Fr that was enough for the whole song just say it on a loop to the beat  😂😂😂❤🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥

You can tell how laid back Takeoff is. Beautiful soul. ❤
Am so sad RIP takeoff
I’m glad they did this. It really captured how happy they were
buena @luchitofs
Takeoff knew it was his time. That's what happens when you sell your Soul to the Devil for some fame & fortune for a few years. He didn't have ANYTHING in his cup that night but he was acting like he was drinking out of it. He was different that night, secluded & not saying much. He knew..
That beat is superfly
🔥🔥🔥👌🏾
Rip my boy
Love this song
Nall for real
Ts give me chills I wouldn't know what to do
[*] [*] [*]
The way takeoff hops on the beat is so good 🔥🔥🔥🥴

Rip takeoff
Its like they shot a video but didn't shoot a video 🤔. Either way. 🔥🔥🔥🚀🚀🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I'm here i finally watch the whole video. Was stuck on the 60secs they put on YouTube in reels
I never listen to Rap, but after I read about this young man's passing on yahoo, and found out who he was, I searched for and decided to listen to his music for a while. His style and talent blew me away. I will never understand why humanity kills each other instead of helping one another. I will never understand the anger and ugliness that motivates one to hurt another. Rest in Peace Takeoff ... 🙏
A rotation regular 4eva💯🙏🚀🕊
I would give my life  If I could bring Takeoff back 💔😞
RIP take
Takeoff's cadence is perfection 😩❤️‍🔥🚀
Survived the hood, got touched unexpected. The good die young. Makes me think of Nipsey.
Vibin still

He never compete with his Uncle because he had Respect for him
Only real OG rappers appreciate new forms of rap. Those who hate, are jealous and are closed minded. The Migos and Jaseh (XXXTENTACION) had unique flows that only went unrecognized by haters. Just how Nicki hating on Cardi and Megan.
Beat super cold but lyrics are beyond garbage.  1st dude got potential though
RIP TAKEOFF🕊🖤

Migos got swag and style than any other rappers in the industry
R.I.P TAKEOFF🚀🚀🚀🕊🕊🕊
I’m glad they did this. It really captured how happy they were
Got to admit a lot of Migos fan but the first flow was so clean almost perfect his delivery was picture perfect. It went well so well with the guitar damn man this young dude still had a lot to give that's so tragic to me we got to protect our young Stars I feel so bad. I didn't know this young man but I feel for him to be honest I couldn't get no sleep thinking about it and that's crazy.
bumpin nothin but migos for a while
This is so amazing 🔥🔥
The duo really were about to Takeover. Justice for Takeoff 🚀🕊  Prayers with uncle Quavo and family 🙏🏽
Takeoff was at another level. 🔥
This go too hard 🔥🔥🔥
The SWAGG on these two is amazing , i love how one is so humble and shy and the other one just is hyper and crazy may Takeoff rest in peace ... we love you and always will thanks for being so awesome and so sorry to Quavo i can imagine his pain the Duo was so amazing ...
I want takeoffs verse to be longer...  RIP

Rip takeoff .
Watching this is so sad for me. RIP TAKEOFF! MEGOS deserve way better than how they've been treated these last few years. The record label FINALLY supported them after not paying what was owed bc they were too busy focusing on Lil baby. Then this happens. I'm outraged at the label too! They should have gave them proper security especially after a new album dropped.  Record label is straight trash.
Rip takeoff
RIP Takeoff. A MF legend taken away too soon because dudes is bitchmade
Rest in Power Take 😤😭
You know damn well Take 🕊 killed it on this one...

Is this like live???
Ima REALLY miss these two together ☹️😞 I looooovvveee how Quavo was vibing to Takeoff's verse. You can tell that Qua was honestly one of his biggest fans😞 they had brotherly love, Unc and Phew. I can't imagine Quavo's broken heart. He spent almost every moment with Takeoff. My heart is breaking everyday for him I wish I could give him a hug. Condolences to his family, friends and loved ones. RIP mighty King Takeoff🕊️🕊️
RIP TAKE🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Ain’t gonna lie.. I slept on takeoff R.I.P
man rip take😢
This was there best track yet.
Qua rapping a takeoff verse for sure 🦻🏽
Eterno Takeoff 😭🖤
Ironic listening to their lyrics about shooting and promoting that lifestyle after Takeoff was shot and killed. Surely Quavo or any rapper that cares/has sympathy, after such events, can’t listen to any lyrics about shooting and being bout it and all the other crap hip hop promotes the same way again. You’d think after everything it would be less promoted or rapped about
🗣😩Just heart broken💔R.I.Power Takeoff and condolences to The Family  For Real...🙏🏾🫂💯
migo yeah that way.... RIP TAKEOFF
King of Kings 🙏🖤
Best song I love this R.I.P. Takeoff

A whole vibe RIP TAKEOFF
Una enorme pena la muerte de Take off, el único grupo de trap o rap que escucho o escuchaba es Migos. Eran muy creativos! Y el se veia posiblemente el de la actitud más (low profile) pacífico, reservado. Que hacian estos chicos millonários en una fiesta y con armas...típico un US. 🇨🇺🇵🇹🇨🇺🇵🇹🇨🇺🇵🇹  Una perdida grande para Quavo, su familiar!!! Creo son primos o tios los 3

Take 🙏🕊️
R.I.P. Takeoff, this song slaps like a motha...
foda é que nego só valoriza os rappers quando eles morrem, maluco foi uma lenda viva no quesito de adaptação pro trap br, quanto gringo
This was unforeseen… may his soul Rest In Peace
Ridiculously consistent flow. Straight up rapper vocals. Him and Migos made ad libs important to trap music. No rapper rode that fine line between “staying on” and “staying out the way” like he did. Gone waaay too early😢
The echos during this performance makes this version so much better than the original. I just wish Takeoff verse was a little longer 🕊🚀
I wasn’t a big migos fan I knew a few of they songs but this isn’t about music it’s about a man losing his life over nonsense RIP TAKEOFF
#FreeTakeoff
I don’t even want to ever imagine the pain Quavo going threw n offset that really a big scar for both of them forever
rest in peace ma brotha
R.I.P 🫶🏽
Poor Quavo, they were so close 💔
RIP  A  BROTHER.  BUT ALWAYS A TYPICAL GHETTO STATISTIC
My lord…I don’t know if we will ever get over this loss…wow..he was amazing
R.I.P takoeff 🤕🤕
R.l.P. Takeoff. You will be missed, and the rap game will not be the same without you...

I Can't Accept That He's Gone🤦‍♂️
This song hit hard on repeat. Rip takeoff
R.i.p takeoff desde México 🇲🇽
It remains of you... It remains of you what you gave. Instead of keeping it in rusty chests. There remains of you from your secret garden, A forgotten flower that has not faded. What you have given, in others will bloom. Whoever loses his life, one day will find it. It remains of you what you gave Between open arms one morning in the sun. It remains of you what you lost That you've waited farther than revivals, What you suffered, in others will live again. Whoever loses his life, one day will find it. There remains of you a fallen tear, A smile germinated on the eyes of your heart. It remains of you what you sowed Which you shared with the beggars of happiness. What you have sown, in others will sprout. Whoever loses his life, one day will find it. Bon voyage Takeoff, you will forever mark the generations to come with your flows, you were and you will forever remain a legend, I love the Migos, I love you, Quav and Off, so please Quavo and Offset, become a family again, start again to send heavy in honor of Take, who cares if now the name of the group must be Brothers and not Migos, Thank you Take for everything, your flows have carried us far, very far.
It's bigger than me
he had a very unique flow. wasnt biting nobody. and the adlibs were perfect timed . a legend . RIP

I've always liked his voice and flow. I can really hear that Southern twang. It reminds me of my family. My cousins and my brother. I got to see them at the hole in the wall club in Atlanta right when no label 2 was blowing up. That night was epic. Takeoff was chillin in the cut, vibin. May God rest his soul, give him wings to fly, and heal their family. RIP, Mr. Ball.

Sad day, quavo gotta feel somewhat responsible and takeoff never got to make mends with his brother before he passed. Whole thing honestly sad and we lose a rapper damn near monthly now.

From a public eye this man Takeoff did not go out anywhere looking for trouble. One of the three Migos who was truly about his business and stayed in his lane, no drama, and still was able to get caught up and hurt. Just sad. RIP legend 🙏🏿

This group really will give takeoff time to shine more as a performer and a writer . We could all agree he was always the better lyricist in the group
Bruh the only thing the songs missing is offset 🗣 the song hard but if offset was on it , it would be charting top 10

Takeoff is the very strong
Ef. A fronta

Take off 🔥
😢bring back offset

With everything they're going thru, Quavo is really on some different sh*t right now! Vengeance mode on full display here and throughout the whole album!
I happy that Takeoff getting the shine that he need...He was always the best...
Sad we can’t get offset on this, he would’ve killed just as as they did
MAGAD
I love how takeoff is always so chill
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
they lip-syncing??
How they shared that space without bumping each other is Insane 😂🔥
I like quavos first dance moves😂
Takeoff 😍😍😍🇨🇮
Beat goes hard!
take off the strongest migo without doubt
Quavo dances just like my drunk uncle
It was raw to see how Animated Quavo was during this performance, on his verse and even wit Takeoffs adlibs. I’m definitely excited for the album♾ 💿
Quavo and Takeoff are loyal and each so unique and masters in their own right.  This the real Matt G....EL Martian/Saturn
They need to do better with part distribution.
BIG Uncle & Nephew energy from them
Amigo literalmente violo la instrumental con tanto flow, esto es impresionante
Dude looks Hella soft compared to home in orange lol

Best in tha game period
Take off is the best rapper amongst the Migos
In the beginning it was (2) . Go back to the Origin. No disrespect to Offset but these (2) held it down in the beginning when he was lock up.
Qauvo 🔥🔥🔥

Som desses cara é foda
Quavo is a group on he's own,
AYOW DAAAAAWG
Factory 🥶
It's a shame they're not actually performing it for real, and before you ask, I matched both this video and the track on Spotify and it is exactly the same, word for word, ad lib for ad lib, there is zero difference in the sound, speed, timing.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥FLaVaEnT/BadBoy4life 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🏁💯💙💙💙
wtf quavo is taller ?
I just wanted to here take off, ok bye
I always felt that quavo was the most famous one and offset was the most talented one.  but uncle And nephew just proved that even if the Migos do break up they're going to be a powerhouse Duo anyways. This was fire.
Certified Fire 🔥 100% 🔥
That was clean ..flow smooth asf.
This song updated my fone
They is so goofy, I love it.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🌪🌪🌪🌪

🫡
This song makes me wanna get rich
So they left offset off set
UNCLE AND NEPHEW GOT RICH TOGETHER. I LOVE IT💯💯💪🏾
The start is insane
Migos aint no more after they lost offset
My favourite thing about migos is you can make a compelling case about who’s the best for all of them
How is this song not more famous?
Take off is spectacular😎😛
Flow un poco adelantado 👽🔥🔥
10/10
What the hell does Quavo have on his feet lol
You gotta respect the beat alone.🥶
Would've loved this infinitely more if this was live. No backtrack, just an instrumental. Qua & Take doing each others' adlibs.
migos never de lacking
why'd takeoff only get like 30 secs and quavo gets the rest of the song?
os cara são o absurdo 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I heard that during every colors show there is no microphone, it's actually added in post, now I can't stop starring at the mic
Mamma
Takeoff come off the hardest out of all 3 to me.. the quiet leader ...quavo got the swag (Drip) and offset the gangsta hothead out the group
No cap Offset would have punished this beat 🎶
This hard
AlwAyz a fan of ALL 3... Sweet beat.! Send me da INSTRUMENTAL.!
polcu deu
Takeoff coulda killed this beat alone
I love u takeoff 🥰💪🏾💯
I just realised  the microphone is just a jpeg and my immersion is forever broken
Takeoff part should have been longer!! He was destroying it!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Im not a Migos fan, but I actually like this one
Diamonds be dancing like Bobby
I wish Takeoff had longer part....Could listen to em all day, He just got that vibe in his voice
Ew those skinny legs 😂 song went off tho
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Quavo really pulled up with the gym teacher fit
TAKE! WE GONE!!
They good without set… let him go go Cardi coattails
Song So Mfn Hard 😂😮‍💨
Damn I wish takeoff had more time in this song.
THIS IS MY TUNE. MY LIFE

ensevdugum sarkı alla carpsın
Takeoff a savage
Quavo is just the worst rapper.
Me when they made us dance in elementary 2:20
takeoffs fit goes hard. matches the background too
Almost on every song takeoff goes way harder than offset for some reason, and on this song takeoff verse is on repeat for me because the rest of the song is not that fire to me after his verse was done, idk if it’s flow of the way he rap but he always been the best out of the group to me.
Anyone know what glasses Quavo’s wearing?
Gave me the Conway vibe them spitting on the MIC like this , they can't touch this, I'm talking them goofy rappers! Respect
Takeoff always been the best migo
Takeoff verse 🔥
man takeoff is the best, let him rap some more
💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Takeoff is cold. A lot of substance in his bars and wordplay
Both went in there and killed itt
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Do they actually do this live?
Dang shout out 2 the producer
Damn , take off woulda slide
Migos really got a different sauce one of a kind!!
Riding that beat flow God's
Need more takeoff and less quavo
takeoff🚀
Im so in love with this song
this song is too good frrfrfrfrfrgrffrfr
Amazing
Offset?
The 5 heart beat temptation stylistics extended hand palm up with that rotation classic smooth move 🔥🔥 💪🏾 old heads get it lol
JESUS THE KING will return‼🤍of men are cold in the last days 🖤turn now,for What is the deal if you gain the whole world but still lose your own soul 💉🧬💯☠God will judge the world.Repent‼just like in the days of Noah . ..

The migos just sound cool. That's about it.... that's probably I don't listen to them all that often
Damn 🥰
테꼽이 라이브 뒤1지긴한다 시이~벌
Takeoff

https://youtu.be/kgjbKbqVUyA
BRUV! I love them so much i could cry - no matter if its 2 or 3 i love THE MIGOS
I really love these guys. Always on time salutes to the Migos . If you only get one of them you still have a Hit!!!!!
So Hard 💪💪
Os Brabos 🥶🔥
This is better than original one
Quavo is trying some of Choppa's dance moves
🔥🔥🔥
Ice ice💎💎
All these fake Migo fans who learned about the them after Bad and  Boujee 🤡🤡
1. Takeoff 2. Offset 3. Quavo  Always been like this
🔥
😎😎😎😎😎
For those of us who, like me, don't follow trap rap 100%, I only follow the artists, the Migos project is one of the best I've ever heard... creative, enthusiastic, cultural, dynamic and musical. Others for me have been 21 savage, future, drake, blocboy and of course kodak black. Even so, the one I listen to the most is Migos!  Cuba en la casa 🇨🇺 🇵🇹 🇨🇺!!
Should be takeoff”” quavo takeoff starts the bars
They rlly from another planet
Omg🔥🔥🔥
🍊
Incroyable vraiment
LEAN!!
Yo os lo digo yo por si acaso que el tema fue muy buena pero una lastima que eminem y el tío Snoop se juntaron. Gracias por el tema y el ritmo pero el tema queda fuera del panorama
Colors has never disappointed I found many new artist through them. Migos always goes hard!!!
THESE 2 ARE THE GROUP
this beat is bananas
Essa ficou braba 🔥 Escuto todo dia
Where’s offset
Takeoff = flow  Quavo = voice & adlibs Offset = lyrics Migos got it all 🤷🏽‍♂️
두 분 다 ㄹㅈㄷ... 온 몸에서 본새가 흐르네 게다가 처음 듣는 노래인데도 빠져들게 만드는거 진짜 멋있다
🥰👌👌👌👌🔥💃🏻
Takeoff need a whole album lol
I guess I took a nap 👑👑🤮🤮💪🏾💪🏾
All these comers I won't fumble🔥
I missed that last ad-lib 🔥
This that BAPPP!
Takeoff never hit the last “ufff” at the end . They man lit. lmao 😂
Takeoffs verse is so hard
Damn everyone sleeps on takeoff 😳
SO’’ FIRE🔥🔥🔥
Other than the track blazing through.. and a proper delivery...Im interested in that Quavo attire.  The shorts and sneakers.
Play back …
Stay savages
Takeoff est tellement sous-estimé alors qu'il est hyper chaud
Takeoff always been the best migo
takeoff glasses was sliding off he was having trouble with them he was lifting them like hole video
TAKEOFFS verse needed to be longer
Those leggs
Th3se two together are giving OutKast vibes。。。and I like it!!!
Listen NO MÁS (MURDA BEATZ feat QUAVO,J.BALVIN, PHARRELL & ANITTA)
This is probably my favorite COLORS performance thus far 🔥
This might B real without Him
hmm. i was expecting an actual color show. :/
How take off have the best part and it’s like 20 seconds 😂
Sweet beautiful colors cause it’s a interesting video
Chris Tucker voice “Gaaaaah Damnnnn”
Takeoff is ridiculously underrated
The whole migos was actually in this video, the third dude was just off set.
TAKE OFF MY GUY, BUT QUAVO DID HIS THING!!! LAWD
My Father Juan Cordero aka Johnny help build the Orange room where all these rappers come to. Shot out O-solo
Vi amo
This beat 🔥🔥🔥 especially first verses
If they had a podcast this would be a good intro song
TakeOff is FIRE 🔥🔥🔥 sheeesshh
TakeOff has landed and to me is showing what he can really do .. Unc and Phew
With or without him bro em going to be good......
Favorite 2022
Quavo
TakeOff trop sous-coté dans le trio
those quavo moves tho
Best colors ever💯  but you can notice that he is disappointed to have forgotten his grillz in the backstages #Thetruth 0.45 ---> 3.01
Migos is na the same right now 👁👌🏻👌🏻
🚀
Quavo vibin like A MF
This channel has come so far.... omg
Orange 😁😁is a color  Like style @Quavo 🔥🔥🔥🔥miggos
ay man why they dont give takeoff more verses? that man spits better than the other two in my opinion
❤️
🔥 🔥 🔥
I can listen to this all day 👊
Takeoff went so hard for like 45 seconds and then I gotta change the song.
Do it look like offset was left off hotel lobby?
I Like
Where’s offset?
Anyone know what jeans takeoff wearing ?
🔥🧡🔥🔥🧡🧡🔥🔥🧡🧡
Take off ....Took this freestyle to the sun 🌞 then back to Earth🌍 n we loved it the moment theY dropped it ..
DJ Take
Blast this in your car I promise you will thank me later
The orange caught my eye !

Takeoff verse was waaaay too short
chemistry unmatched

Best way to cry after a Migos song
This channel is forever so beautifully goated! 🥹
Real Goat 🔥🐐
Takeoff 🛫 with that tone
Anybody else realise the mic is edited in? 💀
Take off shoulda had verse at end
Tɪᴍᴏ Xᴜᴍᴇ😡
ADASHA CAR !!!🏎
2:26 😂😂 wtf is #Quavo doin I'm on the ground cryin lol 🔥
Channelling his inner UNCLE ROGER
Maybe they don’t need him 👀.
this is my gym song
🔥🔥🔥
Naa for real.
Song has no right going this hard 🔥
Damn quavo sounds so good without autotune. Both killed this performance, they might be the most “lyrical” rappers but the flow and chemistry takes real talent.
First time I heard this song was when I was in Vegas last week…sheesh. Huge vibe! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Unc & Phew
I thought these were supposed live performances?
Let's get it! Thst start launches you into it so well, love this 🔥
Takeoff should of took more because he snapped🔥🔥
Take off carries. Hair line isn't low enough to be popular though
Quavo killed it💯💯
unnecessarily hard.
Hetetepetetehehehe hö hö hö scrrr pap mamaaa
You can tell they either took Offset off the track or he didn't want to be on the track.
🔥🧨
Ufff kill it🥵
俺がoffsetやけん？
Why takeoff split short like that!?
Solo 40 segundos se takeof? Quavo, menos protagonismo que ya no estáis en eso, por ese problema el grupo se quedó con dos... Quavo, movimientos más inteligentes.
That’s y I love them they to real 🔥🤎
that last “ ughhh “ hit diff 🔥🔥🔥
Why quavo dressing up like uncle roger 😭😭😭
Killed it this the Migo's I like. Take back to 2013 on that hunger tip
Takeoff🔥🔥🔥
Takeoff is so underrated out the migos, he’s always snapping
Edgar Davids vibes
When set was locked up these 2 made Migos
they need to go head and drop that album
Brabos demais
say what you wanna say about them, they're too saucy and fun to watch while performing
This is art
🛫 🚬💯QUAVO 💎 s dancing like bobby😅
New QUAVO - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqTgktyjkr0
かっこよすぎです
https://youtu.be/0Pn7nDP9ujI
That “Uhn” tho @ 2:38 tho 🔥 real fans know that was a Dab lmao
Bah ou est passé off
"we gone"🔥
🎧👁️🎧
im
I tinkz they combining the adlibs change in flow and taking the mumble rap out and spitting fire makes this style of rap dangerous
“That be my twin , I call him my brother, we got the same Rollie he matching me . Nah fr “
https://youtu.be/a44bIVXfFG4 piazada, da uma conferida no som aii, vai ajudar dms, tmjj🔥 JACK TYLER - MANDA BALA 🚀💫
Baggy pants 😎👍
As cool as this is they’re just lip syncing to the song
I love how they vibe off each other 😭❤️❤️
🔥🔥🔥
Damn they did it with take off that taking off with our take off and they took you off see why your name take off lol
Quavo sempre na estilera
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"I call em twin cos that me brother, he got the same rolie, he matching me" 🔥
Im not even That big of a Migros Fan - I’ve been listening to just like 3 or 4 songs over the past years but damn this one on repeat - one big vibe
I feel takeoff could have did another verse
If y’all say this is the migos it’s NOT. Offset I isn’t there so it’s not the migos so stop calling them that in the comments.
zu gut amk
Quavo 😱😱😱😱😱🔥🔥🔥🔥
🧡🧡
Cake on me No Funnel!!!!!! Cash!
It’s funny how bad takeoff was meme’d for being left off of bad and bougie only to be considered the most talented Migo down the road
Unc and nephew 💯
Why are they on Colors????? 🙄
666 signs every moments …
Incroyable
This sh is fireeee
Takeoff really carried this with the amount he spit.
Let’s goooooo
🔥
I sweaar takeoff dont get nowhere near the credit he deserves!!
THAT FAKE MIC THO
Is that a Streets of Rage 2 sample on the track?
Fire. Quavo gets better and better.
🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍
Takeoff kilt this
It’s the ad-libs and the syncs for me! this is Chilled as ice 🧊🥶
This song is fiyah
Takeoff looks like a throwback to mid-2000s T Pain and I love it soooo much. These two are so amazing :')
SLAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPP 🔥💯🔥💯🔥🔥💯🔥💯🔥🔥💯🔥💯🔥🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥🔥💯🔥💯🔥🔥💯🔥🔥
They definitely got that “naw fr” from them boys in alabama
Fire af but can’t say I wouldn’t want to hear offset go off at the end after quavo on this fire beat 🔥 he always switches up the flow
yes sir, quavo, yes sir.
Takeoff dancing like a white wit some flow
yeah doesn't hit the same without set
Sick
⭐
Why do I feel like they lip synching over the track 🤔
Take off fly 🚀
Real music real lyrics dope beat
Yessirrrr unc and phew until the migos reunit 😤💥🙈🙉🙊💥
F Definitely not the same without offset. That's the truth. I'm sorry @takeoff and @quavo but tbh. I literally intended on listening to him too but quickly exit. But yall great too. It's just yall were Trifecta!
this is the migos i remember
Takeoff always got the best part but always the shortest smh 😔
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤝🤝🤝
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Take needed another verse. He needs more of the spotlight
Quavo : Moves' Master ! BIG ONE...
Takeoff flows ✨
this song better take off
I liked that song
TF IS OFFSET AT ??? DONT SOUND RIGHT WITHOUT HIM
Takeoff hard ash 🔥🔥
Offset definitely had to be there. But takeoff.....omg 🔥🔥
" *Hold* *on* *takeoff* "
https://youtu.be/UM3Ge_YK80E

🔥🔥
This isn’t bad but they got the sane flow just like snoop said in that interview
Is this lip synced?

#blackbeatles#shitsstraitdope@takeoff@quavo#Thegoats
The simplicity itself hard
Damn they stretch dem 4 dance moves
i prolly hated on these dudes when they first came out. but it's been a few years now that i really rock with their stuff
Takeoff bodied that beat quavo eh everyone sleeps on takeoff
Take off is fighting an invincible force
Tight beat.

BLESSINGS

I Go Into The Jungle I Bet  I Come Out Wearing a Mink...i bet i
Quavious hit the taxi-driver dance.  Shout out to OkMalumKoolKat.
Listening to migos in 2022 is crazy 💀
Fizeram a música dentro do estúdio e soltou por cima, podia ter feito pelo menos um ao vivo remasterizado. Parecendo que colocaram uma musica por cima do vídeo.
Didnt think Id ever see them on here. really surprised how good it is!
This needed more take and less Quavo 🤷🏾‍♂️
cake on me no funnel?
I want them to do a song with Earthgang so badly! Till then, this is a vibe!
lobby ooooo
Takeoff my favorite since day 1🔥
Take off is like that friend who seems as though he can't harm a fly when he is the most dangerous.
https://youtu.be/7UVpQndgAQU
00:14 the beat was roughly abused 🥵
Q bien hubiera quedado offset en este beat 😢
soutien de la france😁
W
magnificent
They don’t miss..MIGOS‼️❤️‍🔥
Fire
Lourd sa mère
Takeoff went ☄️☄️☄️☄️ growing up means: takeoff the best of migos
🔥
If only Takeoff would have keep going smdh bruh really is the goat when it comes to word play... I guess when u that good all you need is 8 bars 😆 🤣
I like the way takeoff just hop on the beat from the jump! He legit tookoff!!! 💯🔥
Quav gon crazy 🔥🔥🚀
I go in the jungle and I ain’t got a coat I bet I’ll come out with a mini bar is wild when you break it down
Offset lives up to his name in this one ! he is off this colors show...
Fire, are they Twins? that’s. highway Banger.
SO COLORS changing up the vibe of the platform???
Yea this it
this version is better than the original one.
nah the beat is insane, especially the piano, idk why but it fits perfectly
Straight Fire, we needed this.
Bro fr they went so hard in it
Sheeeesh 🥶🥶
Not gonna lie this should have been a takeoff solo track
🔴 JUICE - GANGSTA 🟠 JUICE - LAGIARE 🟡 JUICE - ŠTA NIJE JASNO 🟢 JUICE X LACKU - PETAK JE
JUICE - GANGSTA
J'adore la voix de Takeoff
This is what I need from you guys! Keep this vibe
Would've sounded better to me if takeoff did the first and a last verse. Just kept Q on the second part.  It went kinda lame after the second hook.  Producer should've caught that.  Maybe they'll do a remix.
Cake on me no funnel cake🙊🙉
🔥🔥🔥All day
Are they blind artists?
now they back again with Quavo and Takeoff only Migos
Simple Beat, Simple Video, Maximum Impact. Very good track and keeping it simple will make a good song stay good long
They killed it
It’s amazing how quavo’s voice matches his flow. Always impress me
Why did Takeoff stop smh 🤦🏽‍♂️ should’ve ended the song on another takeoff verse
Fire af 🔥
🔥
I…love…..this…song ..AHHH🤍
BEAT
This just proves again, why takeoff is the greatest migo alive
Takeoff finna take off!
These dudes are stereotypically black rappers. Lmao!
Take off voice is 🔥🔥aaaaah!!!
Randomly popped up on my Spotify radio. Been on repeat ever since. Beat is fuego!!
That BASS after takeoffs LETS GET IT.....its insane 💣

найс вы картинку микрофона вставили напердели еще в лужу, а типо бюджета у квавы и такофа не хватило на микро, в райдер не входит? а цепи может из пластика еще у них и очки с шейна?
Production goes crazy
Love it! How do we get on colors?
What shades are quavo wearing
This is the hardest song out right now !!!
quavo still having an outstanding flow with those clean asf moves
I’m sorry but Takeoff is Migos hidden gem! That man is COLD ASF 🥶

😉
Imagine a Offset verse in this song.. 😅
Whoever's reading this, i pray that whatever you're going through gets better and whatever you're struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day!
💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽

Migos will still stand without set!
Quavos like “look at meee”  Takeoff likes “damn is it over yet?” 😭
Sending love from south Africa 🇿🇦 Gang went hard
7/18/23 we’ll play this on a hotel in Milwaukee!
pure fire
look's like takeoff forgot how to move
💩
Yes sir🥰
this is trash
Pop up on my feed , never listen to them, definitely heard of them, main stream of course, I wonder if artist actually sing/rap or they just lip sing with studio edit editions,  but this track definitely sounds good
THIS SONG IS ON REPLAYYYYYYYYY WHAT A BANGER!!!
I usely don't comment but this joint hit💯 Takeoff the GOAT fr out the migos.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I LIKE OFFSET PERIOD
Offset don't have the time a full time daddy now since him and cardi Wave

Quavo lowkey looking like dora the explorer
🔥🔥🔥
Muito sucesso guerreiros sou fã de vocês
notice how the “Most Replayed” is literally at the beginning of the song. 🔁🔁 THIS SH*T SLAP
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥✌🏾
yoo who made this beaaat they goes so hard hard on it
Offset would be sick on this
Takeoff should had a longer verse, all that space Quavo had....lol
The other guy must have been off set ?
I personally feel like takeoff needs more verses on songs in the future. I hate to compare but he was the best rapper out of the groups and hes always been over looked ion like det😂😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👌🏽
ROMANIA loves MIGOS !!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OMD okok I stop everything and listen all the projects...

Still can’t believe the mic is edited in
I remain quavo's biggest fan♥️♥️
Why Quavo dressed like GHG Hussle? Lol!🤣🤣
haha being rich is a substitute for style.. what are these pants
If you watch takeoff non stop. You see he's very awkward actually 😄
👍👍👍
What is bigger than me and you is spirituality and the essence of eternality. Focus makes us bigger and experience expands on that focus.
Il fait chaudddddddd
hope we get more of this duo
takeoff carried this ho 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Check your boy too here https://youtu.be/ptBCnM5y_aU
Dam I was looking for Takeoff to slide again🔄 even though he didn't need to🔥

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sounds like Zombie music
Why these mumble rappers on a colors show?... 😂
Offset is offset
💚💚💚💚
Takeoff just killed it

Yo
This makes me wanna be front row at a migos concert asap
Its so cool 🙅
Love it
MAMMA!!!
I went to a concert back in 2018 when Offset didn’t performed. This 2 guys are amazing as a chemy and vibe ! Made the whole show look like nobody was missing! They are destined for greatness changing once with it !
cuando ves que el microfono es falso y no paras de mirarlo
karalho muleke hahahaha 🤩🥰
They even do the adlibs live!🔥🔥🔥
I like tha song too much 🥰🎶
Takeoff is just on another level, his flow is ridiculous.🔥🔥🔥
Il rappe mtn Edgar Davis ?
Love this ♥️🔥
Take off is goat
🙌🏽
Quavo can bop
I see takeoff and quay making independent moves without the least talented offset... This sounds better than a lot of sh*t they got out. This is haaard...
Too hard
og'S
amo esta cancion
Takeoff bro!!!🔥
Daamnnnn
Qua sound like a savage though 🥰🥰😍😛🔥🔥🔥
It's Lit!🔥🔥🔥
Dude they crushed this
Skrrrrttttt 🔥🔥🔥
All I can think of is the reel of the fat guy belly twerking.
I appreciate this video so much to see take off not wearing tight closes and dressed like a man from the 90 my era and a dope track as well
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
k wait - did offset quit migos? is migos alive? huhhhhhhh

Someone tell me that mic is fake
Who said Does it look like I was left outta colors
heavy !!!
Whoelse just see shorts on Quavo?
🔥🔥🔥
Takeoffs the GOAT man I've been saying it!!!
So incredible.
Can we agree that every song that goes through a COLORS cover and just becomes better?
the contrast between takeoff quick flow and quavos catchy Corus is nuts
instant banger
song is dumb hard but how you gonna lipsink you colors show ?
It slaps tho
bruh why are they using a png mic? i prefer when they used to put a real mic
Legends
It’s trash
If people only understood its the music that is making yall move & vibe. I'm listening to this clown jack Moneybags style & and senseless jibberish from Quavo. Smh
Takeoffs part smashed qauvos can't lie
Takeoff!! 🛫
TAKEOFF 🚀 🔥🔥
This is the song we have been needing, the beat just everything is perfect 🔥🔥🔥

Rockstarsss 🤟🏽💥🔌🔊🔊🇧🇷🇧🇷❤️
Takeoff 🔥🇫🇷
Back to the sound that officially blew them up!! Y’all remember when Offset was in jail, so TakeOff and Quavo had to hold the team down for a couple of mixtapes ?
I think it's the beat that got me listening, nah for reals‼️🔥🔥🔥🤣🤣🤣
Uff hit

*and once again, Offset was off set 😂*
QUAVO KILLED IT !!!!!!!
Unpopular opinion: This a banger but they got big platforms already I like when you guys bring the underrated stars here😬😬💯🤷🏽‍♀️
Quavo look it this feel bad not being there 💀
I need a second Takeoff verse
Pega 🔥🇧🇷
Has that Yo! MTV rap vibe when Redman and methodman would spit 🔥 keep it 💯 you can tell when the energy is genuine
Quavo’s voice and presence on a song is 1 of 1
I’m getting “2015”, “Free Offset”, “Pipe It Up” vibes
Fireeeee !!!
Nah for real
Buddy out here playing wit that Rico
T A K E O F F!  🔥
Quavo slid on this ho
take off is gaining weight.
Where offset at 😂🫣
Quavo x Takeoff is a DEADLY DUO, they so clean with it 😤💯
but why is this playback? ....
🔥🔥💯💯👏🏿👏🏿
Is the mic animated??
動きがいちいちMigosで好き　なんかもう一人騒がしいの居た気がするけど
shout out to big money meesh !!!!!

Hard af as always from diz guys 🦾
I don’t know what’s going on with the group as a whole and it’s crazyyyy cause they have been together so long. And there music together is incredible but if one has removed themself for whatever reason the train got to keep running there’s money to be made🤷🏽‍♀️. Loved this song and the beat❤️. I hope they work out what’s going on❤️❤️❤️
TAKEOFF 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Vegas x Migos
Nahh For Real!!!
Migos will always remind me of 2016
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Deux martiens les gars sorte d'une autre planète
Take 📴 went off!! Dope
They lip singing :/
l'ennemi qui l 'a semée, c'est le diable; la moisson, c'est la fin du monde; les moissonneurs, ce sont les anges. Or, comme on arrache l'ivraie et qu'on la jette au feu, il en sera de même à la fin du monde. (Matthew 13:39-40) - Repent. Jesus is coming soon.
I swear quavo got nothing on offset and takeoff lyrics are just on a different level,quavo cool but lyrics don’t be up there like the 2 others just my opinion sorry not sorry
Offset 'does it look like I was left off a colors show?'
Legs 😂
📈📈
Tema la gestu de Quavo au début😻😭✨
ابداع يازول  مكنات عديل

All you lot watch skepta colours then your guna understand that uk break you yanks simple
Really interesting how they rap into the mic and doing the adlips at the same time
so much for the fact that they supposedly always have hardly any text and only mumble haha
Love thehout out to Johhny Depp, Wayne should be proud
Beat is fire they killed it
You guys you must change the voice because you are still sounding like Migos 😂😂😂but offset still the woo
Lit
I never expected Migos in here 😭
Takeoff still needed more in this song. At least a part in the hook cause I love the song but he’s needed more.
Literally the 1% Who's reading this, God bless you, stay safe and have a wonderful day.
wery few rappers can do dat !!!! ICECOLD TAKE !! TAKEOFF IS THA BOSS!!!!!
😎😎🔥🔥
Very nice
🥶
Bro showed up in the T Pain drip

Quavo came with that 3WAY flow
Old Migos 🔥
Whoa,,,🚀🥃

The hand gestures always get me 🤎

Fire! Putain Migos c'est jobar!
Damn what happened to offset?
They really don't need offset
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lip Syncing For Colors 👎🏾
🚀🚀🚀🚀
They just sound amazing on wax and live to me
Fire they spitten 🥴 it's like NOBODY never LEFT 😲🤣..
Should have been another Takeoff verse
takeoff is the goat his flow is fire
Offset would go crazy
Hmm… Okeeyy
TAKEOFF I like the fit 🔥
SHEEEESH ils flexxxxxxx
What are quavo sunglasses ? Please
Leggo 🔥🔥🔥 Big Up from T.O 🇨🇦
Offset would’ve elevated this song and we all know it ..
Diamonds been dancing like Bobby😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🙌🏾🔪
unique style to another level🔥💣💥
So hayyy❤❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥
🥶🥶🥶🥶
damn quavo slid
Rien que leurs bijoux c'est le salaire au rap FR
If offset was on this, this would’ve been the migos best song till this day 🔥🔥🔥but this is song is 🚀🚀
Where offset
Falaaaaa 🙅🏽‍♂️
Quavo a fuckin vibe
takeoff needed more time in that mic gaa damnnnn🔥🔥🔥
C est une tuerie 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
Colors have the best artists, from new faces to monsters like Quavo and Takeoff. It's amazing !
I thought Colors was for more underdog/on the rise artists. We're losing the essence of the channel by featuring already super famous rappers.
MIGOS ONE DAY, MIGOS FOREVER ! BEST GROUP IN THE WORLD ! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Takeoff never dissapoint.
Takeoff traaaash
Very Perfect
Naaah Takeoff c’est le meilleur des migos bravo monsieur 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Big respect from France
uff wachoo
They killed it! But damn Offset would’ve been perfect on this beat as well.
🔥
Y’all need to get Iniko - The King’s Affirmation on here
Goooood
Nahhhhhhh! Colors is too commercial now! I used to like COLORS cause I get to discover gems!
REMIXXXXXX!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Heavy 🔥🔥
Ils font semblant
KEEP LOW KEEP STACKING YO BAG WILL GET BIGGER
takes verse was only 40 seconds💀 Quavo literally had the whole song to himself smh this is so unfair, Takeoff has always been hiding behind quavo and offset's shadows...most slept on migo if you ask me, prolly the best in the group he deserves so much more credit and a bigger spotlight but ya'll aren't ready for that discussion.
No offset??
3 or 2 the music must go on
It seems like every since offset got married to cardi b he wants to separate himself from the group shaking my head
Their adlibs are on another level
damn, this is defition on freshness
Love it 😎
Ses gars sont des stars du rap interplanétaire
MIGOS WILL NEVER SPLIT. PURE BLACK TALENT
Color palette in this is crazy
yes🎉
I NEED a Take off solo project...he’s always been da MF’n one on their joints
pure sauce 👑
I always thought that Quavo and Takeoff were better off without Offset. Their chemistry on a beat is unmatched. They released classics together, without Offset.
Yo this track straight 🔥
Where offset?
Takoff 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn🔥
Suu Suu Suuu Suuu .
.
That beat HARD
Takeoff 🔥🚀 underrated migo
🖤
idk why takeoff make me SO DAMN HYPE!!🔥🔥

Great Vibes to a WHOLE another level watching and listening these guys in a live performance. Lets goooo
🔥🔥🔥🔥🪂
The mic is fake…
Yoooo! Never thought I’d see the day Migos would be on COLORS. Love to see it 😌🔥😬
People forget that Quavo and Takeoff carried Migos when Offset was in jail
This is what you get when you pull two junkies of the street and tell em their "rappers" now
Fire
Lets go Migos!!
This is insanely hard.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🇧🇷🇧🇷💫💫
Need culture IV

TakeOff probaly best rapper with Offset as a close second. Quavo most well rounded, he can rap, do hooks and produce. Great session.
The migos 🚀🇺🇸😮‍💨
Que beat loko
Takeoff X Quavo 🔥🔥💯
🔥🔥🔥🗣🗣
Cake on me no funnel!
That boy Takeoff dance like he don't wanna get his clothes wrinkled. Too cool.
The fact they ran it up as a trio, then guest features, did solo projects, now as a duo 🔥🔥🔥
Yrrr
Vocês são os melhores
Yesssssssssssssssssssssssssirrrrrrrrrrrr
Quavo  going  crazy  that  chorus !!!!!!!👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Migos are corny
Promoting tf out this song but it’s hard so I don’t mind
good 👍🏽🔥🔥
Who else wanted a second verse from @Offset🔥 that dude be fire all time
Free gunna and young thug🙏🏿🅿️✊🏾
Sooo I think this is the first lip rapping I’ve seen on colors😩🤦🏾‍♀️. Dope song none the less😅
I didn’t even listen to it’sharp download😂❤️
Pesadoooo....

Hard as a mf
Unc & Phew franchement le son est mortel, un big up pour le beatmaker
Wassup with Quavo voice?
this goes hard
Takeoff went better if we talkin bout dis version
"Now she says she seeing 3d," WOW QUAVOS expression classic 00:28
I Don’t Mean No Harm But They Don’t Need OffSet It’s Looking Like OffSet Need Them🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🏾
Love you ❤❤❤🙌
Is that a live performance?
No Offset is needed for them to slaughter this session
10 Years deep, I remember when Migos was just these two holding it down while Offset was locked up. I dig the performance.
trap fathers? gadam
Migoooo
Vous allez faire moins de vus que Freeze
This goes hard as hell
Fire

LLLeeeeeetttssssgOOOoooo!
Let's get It !
Slowed on my page 🧏🏾‍♂️💯💨🔥🔥
v
Tbh this is whack. COLORS became my fav platform to watch live underground eclectic eccentric artist of all ethnicities. This is suppose to be a safe place for creatives who don’t get the same exposure as mainstream artist as such or before people notice the talent. I do not wanna see anything like this again or they will lose a follower lol. Fans of color come here to get a BREAK from mainstream but whatever colors do you boo. What the colors day one viewers think of this?!?
Team Takeoff 🔥
I am confused: is this channel going up or Migos' career taking a dip?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯🥊
its 2022 and people still sleep on takeoff for some reason
brabos dms 🇧🇷🔥🔥🥋 brazil presente
🔥🔥🔥🔥🚷⬅️⬅️⬅️⬅️✌👍😉💯
TAKEOFF! 🚀🚀🚀
Seeing Migos on Colors makes me so happy. Quavo and Takeoff went offffff😭😭
Ye ye ye yee 🧡🧡
Day 4 of asking for a Shiva (w/ Earthgang and JID) COLORS Performance
Man 😭🔥🔥
Man this tracks too short! Too wavy we need some features on this

Let’s get it 💪🏻
They need a new stylist
P*****
Dont wanna be hating but I think colors is not the place for extremely famous artists like migos.... Id rather be put on to someone I didnt know before ya digg
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
YAAHH..   Ils ont chaud !!!!!!!! CULTURE 💜
Love all three of The Migos! Came a long way since ‘RIP (Pimp C)’! 🔥🔥🔥  ‘Hip Hop Runs The World!’ 🔥💪🏾
🪢🦉
Takeoffs outfit is so damn clean, sheesh!
Maane dis one right heeere🔥🔥
Now WHY THIS HIT THO !! They killin it finally
Migoooooooo let’s get it pfffff ✈️✈️✈️
The song ain't nothing if it wasn't for takeoff. They gave this man one verse.
This is hard but it’s still weird without offest
Yall forget who held the group down with Offset was in & out of jail….better go listen to Back to the Bando mixtape
o ma freakin god
Loveeeee the color sequence!!! They look great 🤩
Quavo is takeoff's uncle in real life.

This song goes unreasonably hard, especially like this. Unexpected, but very welcome surprise!  Edited to add RIP Takeoff. You've changed the game forever.
I like the color orange now...
Fou
Love them
Linstru je la trouve folle !!
That's decent🔥
DOPE🔥🔥🔥🙅🏾‍♂️
Ok it's the biggest colors show ! no cap
Quavo snapped fasho
Is it just me or are they lip singing?  Otherwise we would hear the jewellery making noise right?
Question….are they still gon go by “Migos” orrrrr…
sick
Gunna et Lil Baby béton ils ont sauté sur l’occasion pour revenir
Dude on the right has a NMPLOL stance LUL
Why they let em lip sync colors ain't the place for that. All natural here Bois.
this bumps
foort
pure artistry my goodness
Fuegooooo🔥
why takeoff had only 50 sec part ? 😩
MIGOOOO 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
how can takeoff flow so hard but move so whack to the beat hahaha
I can’t click on the damn video it doesn’t charge. There is a problem with the video.
Bruh !!! Never seen this coming 💯💯🔥

BRUH
Is that mic part of the scene or put in after?
🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
Le flow c'est ouf
wtf takeoff doin there?
Not a fan - but big ups to their success
🤨 What are they talking about tho?? Full song.. said nada. #bringBackCulture and I don't mean their album.
ناار
Slaps harder than a graphite 🥂
The only thing missing is offset and his dance moves & energy
I love take off SO MUCH
Why are they lip-syncing? Is that like… normal for a colors show??
I feel like people who hate the Migos have never understood how it is to vibe to their music.  This video is the exact mood I feel whenever a Migos song comes on.
the drip is immaculate
WHAT VIBEEEEEEEESSSSSS SO FRESH
That beat though... I'll always have a place in my heart for hip hop because I grew up on it. But these days I am all about the beats and the cadence of the delivery.
When Quavo opened up his arms and said "BIG", I felt that.
That boy takeoff done took off once again 💯
Sou sou sou
