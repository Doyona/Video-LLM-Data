How do we knwo that the pattern that the periodictable is made of, if it will be broken somday?.
I think that we'll discover them all someday.,
Dark matter.....a stable atom beyond a periodic sistem with the elections move faster than light 🤔
Element 0 is real. It is muonium. No muons? Neutronium.
the 119 one is ununennium
This video has almost an identical thumbnail to their later video about creating the new elements
Netherite is an alloy
Badassium
Great video
What element ot there will turn use into translucent light beings that can walk thru walls
How about element 115? Bob Lazar said there is a stable isotope.
Your pronounceing technetium wrong
Element 115
Our understanding is still primitive.
if we ever find an island of stability we'll be theorizing about the 2nd island of stability immediately
When I started teaching chemistry, a previous head of chemistry helped out as a stand-in. He recalled once that when he was at university, the neutron hadn^'t yet been discovered
Without white brains mankind would still be afraid of fire
I was born and raised in Las Vegas. If I discovered an element, it would be Gamblinite.  "I'm holding gamblin night, and I'm holding Gamblinite."
Diddymantium. Element 115
its gross to see this video honestly. I would suggest trying to find the elements instead of making monetized youtube videos about them
The idea that man has discovered everything is just pure arrogance. Everyone who thought humans discovered everything already has lived in a time where new discoveries were made, and in the case of gasses it actually held back the discovery on them because any time man tried to learn more about it people said "the science is settled" and it held it back by actual centuries.  You never want to say "it can't happen", you need to say "theoretically how could it happen?"
Heavy Element 126 - Korium Ko  Heavy Element 164 - Stabilium St  Heavy Element 184 - Fortrium Fr  Heavy Element 228 - Ultimium Ut  Heavy Element 308 - Terminium Tr
Netherite😂😂
Netherite isnt element its aloy of acient depris and gold
I love how us humans managed to basically create new elements
Why're YouTube content creators terrified of silence in the background? Do you play noises when you're giving lectures? No.  So why here?
Adamantium is an alloy.
Wish that'd reach a new one and call it Corbomite.
I personally like the idea that we’re not all that different from space stuff. We are looking for other “observers” and are surprised to find empty space, when really we are currently surrounded by lots of matter that is very similar to us.
10:27 element 48 is Cd not Ca…
Xium
Question should be, do other stable elements exist beyond the periodic table?
Naquadah. If you know you know
That is not the netherite texture
Fun fact: Unobtanium is actually real... just written in a different language. Dysprosium's name comes from a Greek word that means "hard to get at" because the man who discovered it, Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran (what a name), had to try over 30 times to actually succeed in its extraction.
Imagine there are infinite elements and this can be achieved by smashing atoms together???  Wait what do you mean thats true
Element 2 six seven 😂😂😂😂😂            RONALDO SUIII😂😊😂😅😂😮❤😢😮❤
0:06 Netherite exists and is a gold-platinum alloy
Mithril would be cool. But think about Durins bain!
Nice Profil picture🗿
He forgot to list Naquadah in the list of fictional (or are they?!) elements. From Stargate, an OK movie and terrible TV show.
The only post-table elements I know are eka-francium and eka-radium
Any new ones would be extremely radioactive and unstable and unsafe
Netherite isn’t an element?
The elements of harmony  Now just imagining them all being actual seperate elements that combined make a rainbow of destruction 😂
not sure if anyone will get this in these comments on a 2 year old video, but i swear you look like billy michell’s younger brother or something
Ku - Kurchatovium ,no idea what is that,but it is element that is and it is not in periodic table at same time,if the elemnt changed name i dont have way to know ... Edit: it should be same as Rutherfordium 104 ... i see ... Thats weird ...
The only element I need in my life is hopium.
Oganesson (Og) #118 is the newest element.
My 80s chemistry textbook periodic table, the elements not so many as today's periodic table.
Netherite
I have your shirt 😂
Noob scientist! Tony stark was able to make new element from a damn carnivals model
Is it possible that the discovery of such elements could mean the reverse and in some way have negative effects on our reality?
if nothing else, very heavy elements would probably make for some nasty bullets
Can we just agree to name the next elrment after me I am as useful and abundent.
I am sleeping
I think so yes there are.
No way Netherite made its way into the intro
115...115...115
Of course they are
I have my doubts about anything stable would exist beyond the currently known elements. We are only getting further and further away from the lowest energy state, which would encourage radioactive decay.
During the Big Crunch/ Big Bounce, all matter will unite into the greatest element: Omnium, containing ALL the protons.
vibranium ?
Sophinium

isnt netherite an alloy?
Element 119: veritasium:) 8:28
Why of course there is I'm sure white dwarfs have some specific elements made that can only exist under those extreme conditions
silicon age? thats a new one for me
Fukyamamium
94 is the highest element that can exist naturally. It should be possible to synthesize higher elements but why? they will have a short half life and serve no useful purpose.
I believe that Grabby Aliens and the Dark Forest options can be discarded through thought experiment.  Civilization reaching space faring stage requires a ton of co-operation of the individuals making up that species.  I think it's a reasonably safe assumption to look at our cultural past and see how we keep moving away from colonial powers and empires that seek to dominate us and project that same experience on to most other species.  Science and Technology are about advancement through sharing ideas: why would we think aliens would be as successful with less co-operation.  One of the primary arguments for Grabby Aliens has been about resource utilization, but the more we come to know about exoplanets the more it seems that if you have access to FTL the less you'd need to worry about utilizing planets that are already occupied.  Before we go anywhere we'd be likely to send a drone: why do we think they wouldn't?  If they know we're here, why not go to a different solar system to stock up?  For that matter, if they know we're here why not say "hi"?  Once you think it through, Grabby Aliens seems borderline absurd.  And so, for anyone who has done this reasoning the Dark Forest theory also falls apart.
There are 280 elements total. We have a lot to discover. 😊
yes, very much so, but time at our dilation wont let us exist in the same room for long together. From its perspective we barely move, from ours it is trans-mutating in front of our eyes.
Please pronounce Technetium correctly, its tek·nee·shee·uhm not tek·net·ee·uhm in both British and American English
If there WAS another Technetium(ish) stable element, we would have found its signature in a neutron star merger by now.  So if the ‘Island of Stability’ element does exist, it’s have a have life of seconds to a few years at best.  Don’t see much use in that.
Bolognaium? Please tell me more

We are surely both gods and fools.
Element Zero! :)
Before 8th standard I was thinking that wibranium is the strongest metal😅 after watching the Marvel movies
Id hope wed discover 200 quintillion elements since this video We still at oganneson.
The idea of “artificial elements” still perplexes me. Obviously, they can be and are being created. But if they never existed before we made them—if, more to the point, they are and by that “convenient”—handy—only the the desires of humans—how do they deserve their attributed, indeed privileged status as “elemental”—i.e., to the functioning of the Universe?
This only tells me we need to hurry up and seed as many planets as possible. Maybe drop off some stuff written in Stone. Because 1 day that civilization, we'll have its own language and then translate our stuff to theirs and gain some knowledge, and they'll seed another planet. In a good old game of tag u r it . I just hope they don't call us anunaki or gods , maybe space cowboy nerds . So we have a time clock now. How long it will take for these stable elements to turn into a star? And the k back down to the point we are now in this planet with life.
5:04 finally somebody got the half life reference!!11
It is impossible for us to know what we don't know.
The answer is yes.. this is y we have gaps..in the table 😂... and it's not a straight list..😂 come on GUY .. we learn this in 8th grade science. 😂
orichalcum is real is called brass mythril is a silver alloy used in medevil weapons
They make up dark matter.
Actually netherite is Madoff platinum gold alloy
Yes there are many undiscovered elements in the universe
Pronounced technesium !!!
I agree there would be new elements, known knowns and unknown knowns, for example if the current periodic table is all basically created from the death of stars and its by products what then occurs inside a blackhole. Or perhaps dark matter  and  its energy states. We  are bound by scientific understanding that we have now, just like we were bound by it 100yrs ago. Perhaps quantum computing can figure it out with the help of Ai
Future possibilities could still exist by learning how to make new types of material via using quarks or strings(if real) or maybe even dark matter to make new types of elements outside standard elements.  I have no idea if we will ever figure out a way to do that, but there is a huge amount of possibilities still out there!  I doubt we will ever figure that out, but there are still many avenues still available. Definitely will never be in our or our grankids lief times.
I hate when quantum mechanics breaks chemistry lol 🤣
There are definitely elements that can’t stay stable in our low gravity
netehrite isnt an element  its made from gold and netherite scraps

43 is pissed off that 42 gets all the glory.
I think oganesson is my favorite synthetic element just because it's so weird. It's both a metalloid and a noble gas I wanna know what state of matter it would be if you could get enough in one place to observe
Do protons and neutrons all need 3 quarks. What would happen if quarks could be only 1 up and 1 down.
has anyone every tried to bring the strong nuclear force together with dark matter?
Vibranium and Beskar too.
What about the neutrino bomb from Rick and morty how would that work

Flappium. Just sayin’.
I do predict and believe there are more elements not only in the periodic table but in the dark matter element's table that is yet to be established, however more global scientific research off-planet is needed.
Do you think after 400-500 years, technology will be at level where you can mass produce elements you need from other one like, from Pb to Fe, so we can reduce Pb toxicity and make it useful is +
Guys you have the extended periodic table which has 119-184 so yeah... What do you think😂 it also is an article in wikipedia hehehehehehehe caseoh caseoh caseoh caseoh caseoh
My favorite solution to the Fermi Paradox, is that if there was any kind of alien life, people in power would ensure the information is kept on an extremely need to know basis. I mean, we can't even accept that climate change is real, without corporate and billionaire denial. If there was theoretically some kind of actual events happening, it'd assuredly be covered up like so much else in our world.  This isn't to say that the theory is true, but it posits that if something like this was true, it'd be concealed anyways, and we'd have the Fermi Paradox rise to explain that.
An element is an element, even if it exists a thousandth of a nano second.
Ur shirt is periodic table but only the ones able to be represented in Minecraft
Why is this actually fun and entertaining to watch
You forgot vibranium 😂
I just noticed that theres a minecraft periodic table on his shirt
Atleast for me there aren't many that could exist beyond periodic table  Reason  First because of their nuclei stability as the protons keep increasing the binding energy per nucleon ratio keeps getting disturbed making nuclei unstable to practically exist   Second is size of the atom even if number of protons and neutrons keep increasing in the nucleus the size of these elements will  not vary much and will practically remain constant in a group if you ask why size of the atom would not increase the answer is due to effective nuclear charge of the nuclei will dominate due to further poor shielding effect of f and g subshells if you ask how it works study lanthanoid and actinoid contraction   And my final reason  Radioactive decays ,weak nuclear forces and nuclear fusion and fission exist even if hypothetically there was any element it would spontaneous undergo that process to maintain its binding energy per nucleon ratio high making its half life very short and practically not able to exist   Thats my reasoning 😊 Fell free to point out any mistake if i have done and sorry for any grammatical mistakes :⁠-⁠P
Thank You for your video
lol Minecraft Reference “netherite”
18:40  Yes being the a member of early species is indeed an answer to the observation. However it is not clear that we have all the information necessary to say that is indeed the case. The universe is indeed massive, milky way galaxy spans 100,000 light years in diameter. So another answer to the observation that we observe an empty universe would be that either we cannot see in the sense we do not yet have the means to detect aliens, or in case aliens do have a means to contact us they'd rather not on some economic basis ,i.e. interacting with us consumes far too much resources and them not having enough to gain from us. I think i heard this point being made in a Kurzgesagt video
if there was a new gap there would now be 136 elements
Why minecraft😅 My favourite game😅
The cosmos is composed of 6 energy levels of 3 Matter and 3 Aether space fabrics.  In each energy level of space fabrics, they exist in 6 dimensions of isotopic and homogenous graviton and tensor strings.  Those gravitons and tensors exist as the (corrected) string and rope (loop, ring) theory fabric.  As such, these elastic space fabrics can turn inelastic under the greater gravity objects' force, creating gravity wells and slopes.  Inside of these smaller or greater gravity objects, can be the evolution of a photosphere in which inelastic space fabric turns into actual and active fusion agents, the start of a stellar engine.  These elastic strings of gravitons and tensors also are the true composition of PROTIUM.  Thus, space fabric across the entire cosmos is composed of sub-atomic PROTIUM.  Not enough free electrons across the cosmos creating those 1-6 Hydrogen atoms per cubic meter.  An elemental atomic nucleus exists as PROTIUM without an orbital electron making them into cosmic Hydrogen1.  Thus, one redefines and clarifies that all such atomic protons and atomic neutrons are vastly mis-defined, and mis-understood.  An atomic proton IS NOT a proton, it is an atomic graviton.  An atomic neutron IS NOT a neutron.  Neutrons/neutrinos/photons/photinos are all free-ranging boson particles.  They are also -0- charge with -0- spin bosons.  These bosons are composed of an electron and positron.  The only remaining boson is a tensor, having the same -0- charge and -0- spin.  An atomic neutron is correctly defined as an atomic tensor.  Thus, when you look at space fabrics composed of strings of gravitons and tensors, and see that a single doublet of graviton-tensor creates elemental PROTIUM, then all atomic nuclei house multiple doublets of PROTIUM !!!  Each additional graviton and tensor in the nucleus is a higher protium element with an additional electron in its outer shell.  This is the real truth within atomic physics.  One is not adding in additional Hydrogen atoms (nucleus and orbital electron), but one fuses in one additional protium and an associated electron is captured into the orbital shell.  Bose-Einstein condensates and Cooper electron pairings, show that there are higher superconductor elements as they are doublet elements with twice the protium (gravitons and tensors) in the nucleus.  Also, the atomic mass unit size remains the same as Cooper electron pairs have 2 electrons per shell orbit where there was conventionally a single orbital electron.  Twice the mass energy, same size, hyperspace properties of superconductors being able to pull cosmic energies (Aether energies) into their element, and have it available for use with proper machinery as an unlimited energy download from the cosmos into the matter universe.  Metallic Hydrogen is a doublet superconductive element of Hydrogen.  They have the mass energy appearance of Helium2, but they continue to respond only as Hydrogen2, not Deuterium (with 2 neutrons, as 2 tensors with 1 graviton, but supercompacted Hydrogen2 (with 2 gravitons and 2 tensors as 2 protiums in the nucleus and 2 twinned electrons in the s1 shell.
The only real elements to find in the cosmos, are the higher-quantum periodic table of element superconductors.  These are metallin-crystallins, flow metals, or cold flow plasmas.  Superconductor elements are an entire series of periodic table of elements in their higher supercompacted state.  Metallic Hydrogen is a double Hydrogen.  Double Helium.  Double Lithium = Di-Lithium.  Double Iron, etc.
If there is, they wouldn't be found in this wispy region of the galactic arm frontier, almost at the end of the whole galaxy !   These elements would be found in the denser galactic arm near the galactic core, where denser space fabric would exist.  As such, it is the Q n=9, f2 shell trans-Uranium series of fusions that Tau photons (gamma rays) are emitted.  Thus, I wouldn't want to be nearby any of those places and finding a d5 shell and f3 shell elements ! Let alone any lower X rays, or UV rays as well.  The only element that one would find up there is STOOPIDITY !
I really need that periodic table of minecraft tshirt you wear
Netherite is real. But it has other name.
Elements beyond 118 likely exist, but current scientific tools and methods are insufficient to detect or study them. These superheavy elements, predicted to lie within an "island of stability," require advanced particle accelerators and techniques to synthesize and observe. Technological limitations hinder our ability to confirm their existence and properties.
God teleported them, damaged his mojo.
You're so very politically correct the way you avoid all of the "darker" applications that are actually most likely to drive demand for those elements.
14:13 - Artillery shells.
Find vertasium😊
vibranium
Didn’t even get a yes or no
Seems like a given. Of course there are the universe is massive
Like that transparent aluminum Scotty made a whale tank with?
I've found 2 new elements but they only last half a pico second and I've named them, Gaylordium and Getbummedium. Maybe the names won't stick ium ha ha
I skipped mithril and went fore runeite
“Just one more particle accelerator bro, I swear this time we’ll find the island of stability 🙏😭😭”
Probably the best way to create new elements is nuclear fusion
Actually came up with an element once (Ml for Melonium, at atomic number 102 possibly created by firing protons at a U atom, or creating fusion with a U atom)
Krypton is an actual element. Number 36.
0:06 netherite isn't an element, its an alloy
The common of it all is there was absolute no-thing....then....some-thing created itself out of nothing and further cell divided to make Jesus....some-thing ELse. We are element zero....patience zero
ALSO... there is something God in element zero..think about it. Before nothing was and/or wasn't ether or else
Hey silly.... we are given the present from God to see yesterday and ponder tomorrow. I'm glad to spin time with you. spider
I was just asking artificial intelligence about this. If we get to the point where we can make element one hundred twenty, Because it's easier to create odd number elements, There is a possibility we may find them. The biggest problem is that they only have a half life that might last fifty microseconds. So we would have no way to hold them, With the exception of maybe in a magnetic field. And to what end if it costs millions of dollars to make a microgram of particles?  We have gotten to the point where we can even technically make anti matter. But to no avail because we can only create maybe a couple of particles at one time. If only we could figure out a way to break this barrier, But there's nothing to indicate that it's coming anytime soon.
"Netherite" ah moment
sugdenium
And you can't tell me ufos since ww2 aren't man made. That's because since then people mastered the Atom ⚛️
Yes that does exist !! There are island of stability !! There many other physico/ chemical mechanism which will eventually unfold !!

Mine textbook says that element 104 is Rutherfordium (Rf) but my school's periodic table says it's kurcavoriom (or something similar to that mine memory is worse then a goldfish's) + element 105 has the same treatment in textbook it's dubnium (Db) but in my school's periodic table it's something that i don't Remember the name of which should i trust if i can even trust any of them  Edit: something that i forgot to put here is that the name of the elements i put here are in Slovak and i forgot to put the name of the textbook that we have which are also in Slovak, but the name of the textbook is: "Chémie pre 8. Ročník základnej školy a 3. Ročník gymnázia s osemročných štúdiom" made by Helena Vicenová. but the name of my school's periodic table i don't know.
I wonder if we will ever be able to create gold from other elements like they tried to with lead back then
Unbihexium is the element we need to focus on, not “Ununennium”
I think temperature also plays an important role in stability of atoms like if temperature is very low movement of atoms decreases also stability increases. So if we go low enough temperature and do experiments at that temperature we can discover not only new elements but also many compounds which are now impossible to synthesise due to instability. Of course radio active elements are also  very instable elements that we know very less information. Their half life period is like milli seconds or micro seconds.
2 new elements for the peridiotic table -   (Qt)  Quantasium  😉  (Jo) Judorkium  🤣
I was thinkin that too
Seeing that us hominids have already created heavier elements that did not exist in our world before this seems like a question only the ignorant would ask or be pulled in by. Of course there are.
did anyone see his shirt it says periodic table of minecraft
2:58 that's actually James Hoffman the coffee man is actually immortal.
Even if element 126 has a half life of mliions of years, when it decays, won't the decay chain leads to the vast ocean of instability, and lots of them undergoing spontaneous fission? In short even if say element 126 has long half life it will be stupidly radioactive and dangerous thanks to its daughter products...
5:00 HALF LIFE REFERENCE!?!?!?!?!????!!!!!!!
im gonna make sillynium right now
I’m out of my element here….
Tritium, an isotope of Hydrogen is radioactive
Considering how useful lanthanide dopants are in solid state chemistry, I'd love to see synthetic elements used in the same.

look I just saw.iron man and he  created a new element, I don't think the phone hear me I think I just saw it and thought of it and if I wouldn't saw the movie I probably didn't thing much of it and just forget it 😅
When our sun blows up will it make stable elements past 92?
Wait, isn’t bismuth (Bi) stable?
1:00 did he really cover up uranium???
Eternium, ofc
What if the big bang was actually really big atom decaying?
😂Netherite
Element 0 technically has been discovered since its just a neutron, let’s get some random atom, remove all the protons and bam, neutronium (if that’s possible)
A quickie for the ones who want a fast answer (I havent watched the video, this is just an answer from my previous knowledge they might mention something completely different so do watch the video)  - yes there are, but they are too unstable to exist for a period of time longer than a fraction of a second for some and a couple hiurs for others.  A bit more detail - atoms of elements have a number of neutrons and protons in their core, they defy what element the element actually is. The number of protons defies the element while the number of neutrons defies which izotope of the element it is. An izotope is like a different version of the same element. For example Ozone is actually and izotope of oxygen and not a unique element.   So the amount of protons and neutrons matters for the stability of the element, there exist numbers called "magic numbers" which indicate how stable an atom is, if it has one of these magic numbers as the amount of protons or neutrons, then the atom is more stable, thats also the reason why most higher elements de-grade to Lead, as Lead is a magic number and one of its izotopes is also doublely-magic having a magic number of neutrons and protons.   This stability of elements can be put in a chart called "the valley of stability" there you can see a clear pstter of ehich elements are stable and which are not, but the pattern ends at a point, after which there are no known stable elements that can be created. For even further info I'd reccomend you to watch the video about the man who tried to steal an element by a creator whose name I forgot, its the one that has Nivmonium on the thumbnail.
I did made a fictional element called scadramonium (Sd 128)
wait my friend has that exact shirt lol
Honestly the only reason I continued watching the video was because of the Minecraft reference in the beginning
Elements that would make possibilities of doing things we characterize as magical on Earth,  and plants that will extend our lifespans so that we can live thousands of years

Why did you omit the Atomic/Nuclear Ages?
Using the methods of our civilization, our civilization would only be detectable from a relatively small part of our galaxy. We have only been producing radio waves since 1892, those radio waves have only gone 132 light years where our galaxy is 100,000 light years across.  If there are more advanced civilizations they may have moved into communications systems that we cannot comprehend and therefore cannot detect. Conclusion; there may be a window of observability.   It has only been 30 years since we observed an exoplanet, to see a civilization may take a little longer  An interstellar civilization would be most likely where the stars are somewhat closer together, but not so close that getting wiped out by a local supernova becomes probable. At the centre of the galaxy stars are about a light week apart, voyager has only gone about half a light day. So even if we were at the galactic centre we are a long way from being able to plan an interstellar voyage.  Space is big
Netherite is Pt4Au4
3:06 Seems that is the one and only photo of Technetium. That photo was in the periodic table in the TIME LIFE Book MATTER Published in 1963.

Wow that shirt is a blast from the past
Him wearing a T-shirt 'Periodic Table of Minecraft'
PBS Space Time: All elements have uses  Elements 97-118: Yeah, whatever you say
Short answer: maybe Long answer: maybe
Goddammit, this is a total waste of 21 minutes, that never gets around to the title..
0:05 I believe kryptonite is made of krypton.
Not mentioning vibranium at that start kinda offended me
“netherite” minecraft!!!!!!!
Sugdanium? more like Sugmanium. Sugma what?  Sugma D
Which are the common similar properties of lanthanides and actinides together with the rest of group 3 elements?
Since bound Neutrons are so helpful in the nucleus, why are free Neutrons so harmful to humans?
Technetium is interesting. It's still made from molybdenum and used in medicine
If one gets discovered, Better be noxuim
Creating new elements sounds a lot like alchemy instead of chemistry
POV:- Periodic table of minecraft
Adamantite and Mythril 0:00 0:05 terraria
The fact he said Netherite and he is wearing a minecraft periodic table is not a coincidence
if netherite is heavier than ogenecyne, then it should kill u in minecraft since it would be highly unstable
Neutron and proton 69 for life
Russell brand looks different
I love this presenter
Nice, simple, but entertaining video. Thank you for making free educational content
You forgot stalinium
i love the Periodic table of Minecraft
C.C.    54  22t
Netherite ??
Actually, technetium is still found when we exploit uranium
There's totally 216 elements in this universe
DALEKANIUM, who knows knows
He forgot vibranium😢
Biden discovered stinksalotatnite.
*An infinite number of elements.* ❤
just say the elements not yap.
Watching this video a year later still one of the most interesting videos by far
I have a fear:non-gravity
6:00 I guess I am re watching this.. its an assumption of a decay format of stability ,when you can cultivate an environment to create stability for the desired outcome.. like chemical reactions can create instability, as to crafting new elements can require a deduction to creating stable platforms for those elements to exist without decay. This can be surrounding it with various other measures or pressures ( environment) in such a way that it is in a stable system this then leans towards what it would look in reality to come across a stable cluster. mh
I think oricalcum was an actual material from ancient Rome, but its not an element.  It's a compound
*you see an empty universe because you are seeing how it was in the past. you also discount the bible as a historical document, which has told you that we have been visited by angels (aliens) come from heaven (space).*
The coolest thing about science is that it's cumulative. The more we learn, the faster we learn. Ex: learning to build the hubble telescope advanced tf out of our galactic research and knowledge.
You missed Unobtainium.
humans do not "happen" they are created by God
No Vibranium?
New elements are possible, but there won't be any new properties of matter, sorry that would require an entire new group on the table
nice shirt bro!
nothing good comes from discovering mysterious islands
Undoubtedly these elements exist in neutron stars and star cores.  Gravity is the answer
As stability decreases, so does stability. Conjecturing that it likely tends towards zero, how may distinct nuclei could there remain by discretising the expression related to the limit ? Surely it can't go on forever.
I hope when fusion and spliting are perfected we can turn led into gold
U forgot naquada
more of them need to be edible
My favorite fictional element is Triunhexium.
how can you make a video drag on for 20min about the island of stability?
What the heck is sugdenium tho
Big bangs are created by super cold background radiation and super cold gas nebulas the chemicals spawn in at extremely low temperatures witch store weight and generate cold fusion gravity the colder the universe the bigger the bang even after the last atom decays cold fusion nebulas spawn new universe's and there's more than one universe
Atoms don't store energy they connect through string theory to the ether that constantly charges them they're empty canisters there's lots of ways with nano technology to make atomic cages atoms that fill the same way a glass of water does from the ether cracking a atom releases the cord of the string theory that links them to distant atomic canisters it's the energy between distant points that's released
Bro left out Vibranium in the beginning 😢
What about vanadium? (Captain america's shield)
Naquadah
This is such BS — “swapping nucleon packets”. “Spin coupling”. “Magic numbers”. Nobody really knows how this stuff works, we’re not there yet with our own understanding of nuclear physics.
terraria ores
Can you do an episode or if one already exists point me toward it where you explain how scientists knew that uranium was the last naturally occurring element?
Black holes maybe have the power the make larger atpms or maybe white holes
Oganesson is the last element
I’m really hoping to see some crazy new materials soon.
"Beskar"
Serious respect for the old school minecraft merch!
Element 119 Should Be Stickywashium
Yes. It exist.
Screw unobtainium, I want *Eludium*
idk
Netherite is more of a fictional alloy. As it is part gold.
There is a mistake at timestamp 10:27 with the element Cd, which is written in the video as Ca...
Somehow you remind me of Peter Dinklagr in Avengers. Kinda nice, feel like having a dwarf with metal knowledge explaining the elements
Element 237 is Neptunium dummy
He has T-Rex arms. Now you can’t unsee it.
This one is very good. Learned much about synthesizing future elements
where chinesium?

The fact that we're capable of having an existential crisis is giving me an existential crisis.
netherite is an alloy not an element
Given that there are no stable elements beyond lead, and atoms seem to only get more unstable the more massive they get, we're highly unlikely to find any more new elements that still exist in nature. All the "new" elements we've "discovered" in recent decades were the result of smashing atoms together in particle accelerators to see if they'd combine, creating single atoms of super-heavy elements which then decayed again in a fraction of a second.
Thanks for this video. I was questioning this exact question for my chemistry teacher back in the days. My take on it was that perhaps somewhere in the universe, like antimatter, teoretically there could be material with different particles than we are used to, like altered protons, depending on the composition of the quarks for instance. We havent found it on earth because we are biased towards the atoms on earth? Just a teory. In the beginning when mentioning Mithrill and Cryptonite you forgot Elerium 115 (just humor!).
Yes and yes there are hundreds of New elements in the periodic table to be discovered.. with supercomputers tech and real concepts on mathematic algorithms and real laws of physics.. sooner than later we will be able to achieve chemical compounds 100 % pure.. and the future machinery infrastructure will be last for hundreds of years.. and goodbye to the Zionists WORLDWIDE GENOCIDAL criminals AGENDAS and nobody else can do anything else about it.. 😊😅😊😅
Nature made like half of that last row. We just have to wait, lab it or who knows, we might never witness the discovery of new elements. Who's to say this periodic table dosent just pertain to this universe!
Elements do exist their just classified.
I can imagine there's elements that exist within stars and blackholes that can only exist under extreme conditions.
In the distant future, an advanced intelligence discovers remnants of our civilization. They call us 'The Ancients'. "What have they created" one being asks the other. "Something called 'MTV'".
The tentacly Lovecraftian type LOL 💗💗💗
We need something hard,or the future of interstellar travel is looking bleak.
There's room for the idea that the Earth was seeded by God.
I have anti matter pieces stacked up to the ceiling SOMEBODY HELP ME PLEASE !!!
If a new element is discovered i would make petition for it to be named netherite
If everyone really truly think about it we’ve already discovered antimatter you just have to think of the name it’s the opposite state of matter so obviously we’re not going to be able to interact with it in this realm/dimension
Probably
Where can I get that sweet Minecraft Shirt?😮
I love that the comment that was paraphrased wasn’t paraphrased.
I was wondering how C14 decayed into N14, and now I finally understand how that goes down…
I dunno you tell me
The table is actually a wrong presentation of the elements. Hard too explain but things are connected way differently and most certainly not in a table way.😅
I always wondered about elements  higher up on the table. And how big they could get. Scientist therize there's an island of stable elements.
If dark matter particles exist & only interact with normal particles via gravity, can they interact with each other gravitationally? Can they gather together (like normal matter does) to form macro-objects? Such as asteroids, planets - even sun-sized or larger objects? Would such an object be invisible due to it not interacting with light? Light would pass through it, but it would be deflected by the gravity of the object, causing grav-lensing? What would happen to a normal matter object that impacted it? It wouldn't be like an impact with another normal matter object (or would it?), but it would still have a gravitational field that would interact with the gravitational field of the normal matter object. Could you get a dark matter object big enough to have the mass of a black hole? Would it be a black hole?
Lies you know nothing how the strong force works this is all lies rubbish garbage balderdash
What if there at an infinite stretch of stabile islands?
I hate it when they start talking about myanium without consent. Dude, my your own anium, don't mess with others.
To future generations: Stay off my lawn!
Since neitrons add binding force but no coulomb force, it seems to me that neutrons can be added indefinitely without destabilizing the nucleus. Thus H-50!
This is excellent! I'm impressed...
0:09 where is chlorophyte and luminite
none.  without some ground breaking binding technique invented.
We are the progenitors.
Elements that only exist for a split second inside a particle accelerator should not be on the periodic table.
Turbinium
Yes!
Wait... ITS WHITEVNETHERITE INGOT
Nucleus too big, electron moves too fast, gravity from the nucleus actually pulling on the electron as well, then no atom. Am I misunderstanding all of this? I could not find the basics in this video, so I assume I am wildly off in my understanding. That electron speed being a critical issue? Like, the electrons kind of come to a "boil."
Blackholinum is the last one.
I can't help but think of a conversation I had some years ago with my friend Somaditya Sen, a world-renowned physicist whom I only knew because our kids went to school together. In those days we lived very close together and had many, many far-ranging conversations about science and the nature of reality as we naked apes conceived of it.   One day, I told Somaditya about a very popular book making the rounds at the time called The End of Science, wherein the author postulated that we silly humans, who had only recently discovered electricity, had pretty much figured out the universe, with perhaps less than 1% of what there was to know was left to be mapped out, a mere mopping up operation. My jovial, genius friend erupted in such a fit of uncontrollable laughter that I feared for his health.   When he finally caught his breath again, and had wiped the tears of laughter from his face, he responded that, if anything, those percentages were actually the inverse. That we had only maybe understood 1% of what there was to know. Put another way, if we lofty beings had only harnessed steam power a few centuries ago, what might a civilization that had evolved a million or even a billion years ago have learned about the one universe we presume to understand?
Quick correction   In the intro, you say netherite is a fictional element.  It is not an element it is an alloy made from netherite scrap and gold
According to at least some Star Trek sources, dilithium isn't on the regular periodic table at all. Its nuclei incorporate different (unnamed, as far as I know) particles.
There are absolutely an unknown number of elements
A new technique of mapping the nucleus has found  a possible solution to the mystery of the Technetium 96 and 97. It turns out that Tc 96 has an orphan Neutron that didn't get paired and decayed quickly and Tc97 has an anonymous 4 chain (Proton/Neutron/Neutron/Neutron) that looks like it may cause a low level beta decay. Their stability scores are within the range of a stable nucleus  TC96 at 106% and Tc97 104.8%
Great video! This is a topic that is extensively discussed in modern chemistry, and it's great to see your theories.
Me, 10 seconds in: " Umm actually, orichalcum is an alloy of known precious and semi precious metals"
i like to think that element 119 is a barrier that keeps us from discovering new elements, but after we discover it, it turns out to be perfectly stable and useful. Then, using element 119 and some others we can discover the hidden part of the periodic table. We would find a lot of elements that can be used for different things. Element 132 would be a very good filling for wires, even better than copper. Element 172 would be a durable metal, more effective than steel. Element 270 would be very useful in medicine. Element 408 would be a much better power source for nuclear reactors than uranium, plutonium and thorium. Also, we'd find many combinations of those atoms which could be used for various new technologies.Then, we'd reach the true limit, element 476. But is it really the limit? maybe 477 is a barrier keeping us from discovering tons of other useful elements? the truth is, that cycle will NEVER end.
I will not be suprised if there are actually an infinite amount of elements in the universe.
10:33 Uh...why would that help on its own? Magic numbers seem to require other stabilizing forces to "help". For example, helium-10 is doubly magic but it's not bound and decays extremely quickly. 93Tc may have a magic number of neutrons, but it seems like having almost as many protons would overwhelm stabilizing forces from magic numbers, though I don't know how accurate pictures.
You should have throw everyone and said Element-115.  I'd loved to see that Easter Egg.
Do they exist?  Sure they do.  On earth?  Not so much.  More in brown dwarf stars and near the event horizon of black holes.
Is it really possible that reality is more than what we can imagine in our small skull? 😅
MashaAllah ማሻኣላህ ماشاءااله
Lol netherrite
Isn't dilithium a mineral?
I am thoroughly enjoying your discussions. The way you explain, very unique. Very simple to comprehend.  Thanks homie
I discovered an element when I'm beating my meat, It's unstable and rare 😢
Krypton actually exists
I was under the impression that the 114/126 for protons was still not understood! And it could be either
Netherite in real live? 0:06
19:25 Or does it? Horizontal gene transfer makes the common ancestor of early life a bit muddy. There could have been plenty of early life forms that lineages have "survived". It is just that they got, over the millions/billions of years, so mixed up with each other that they now look like one common ancestor way later.
I'm fascinated and confused.  I should have stayed in school.
Netherite!!! Omg
um yes. thats why new ones get added sometimes
Adamantium is not an element in the Marvel universe. Adamantium is a nigh-unbreakable steel alloy, the exact composition of which is a highly guarded secrete by the US government. It does not occur in nature.   Vibranium, on the other hand, is an alien metal which does occur in nature in the Marvel universe. Wakanda has so much vibranium because it sits on the site of an asteroid crash.
haptic feedback on the video? 😮
I left the video at 5 and a 1/2 seconds, what did I hear lol
his shirt is outdated as the netherrack texture is the 1.15 and below one
Right of the bat netherite is not an element it’s an alloy
He didn't say Vibranium 😭
118 got renamed too many times
20:04 no no the tentacles are where we make mistakes and earn our wisdom
"Weapons-grade bolognium" is some SERIOUS bullshit😉
Turn off the lights
We think the universe is gonna last trillions of years.We're currently only thirteen point eight billion years in, so obviously we're early.
Elementary, Dr. Watson
Bro forgot gold pressed latinum
I predict that in the 3rd dimension we will eveentually have 144 elements + 9 noble gases, in dimension 4+ there may be more
Those super heavy elements are abundant in deep space of the universe where the very first element synthesizing process began. The initial creation
Of course there are... Teachers are stupid.
In theory the periodic table of elements goes on forever because numbers never end and elements have to do with numbers of things.
When he dropped "netherite" I felt shiiuuuuhhhhhh🫡🤯🤯
I once had a dream where i discovered element 119 and 120 and i named them after Indonesia and Micronesia
Yeah, Notrealium.
I think the Universe is quiet because there is a super-race of unbelievably violent and fearsome aliens. Let's call them "the Precursors"...  And they are so incredibly technologically advanced that every race they contact worships them as gods....  But the Precursors immediately eradicate these other species and usurp all their resources, energy and technology and destroy them, or assimilate them(like the Borg for my Trekkies).  Anyhow, the way these Precursors find other races to prey upon is by sensing the first radio signals coming from inhabited planets.  So basically, the first time a civilization emits focused radio emissions, their doom is sealed.  They simply have the amound of light-years from the Precursor world worth of time to advance before the Precursors come and devour them... So here's my question, we've been blasting radio signals into the cosmos for over 100 years...  I hope we were at least 200 light-years away from the closest Precursor listening outpost.....
I often wonder about what the elemental number of a neutron star would be
You forgot Veritasium. : An element of truth  https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium
In atomic physics, there is he joke that we only count 1, 2, many, because hydrogen and helium are the only two that we can really understand mathematically, if we go towards lithium, that’s purely in the real of computer mathematics
Incredible periodic table of Minecraft shirt Matt!
Seeing as how we haven't even cataloged all the living creatures on the planet....ya, probably.
These elements that last for vanishing small amounts of time, it's cool and all, but what's the point other than "they can exist", you can't use them in any way, for all purposes they don't exist and cannot be used.
It was at 11:11 when I noticed what was on the t shirt.
Everyone forgets Janet! His table makes all this make more sense.
Yeah you can, tony stark did it brah, he re-arranged the nuclear geometry by inflating the nucleons to a hollow sphere instead of a ball, different nuclear geometry larger atomic numbers , higher nuclear binding energy ergo stability
its possible i learned more on space  time than i did  in all my physics  classes combined.
is there any clue what kind of technology is necesasry to ever hope to sinthetize elements in the island of stability? Anything we foresee in the future? Just bigger accelerators?
My biggest question if we did make elements so heavy and reached an island of stability I just wanna know what kinda properties an element like that would have I wonder if we’d have to come up with a new class like Metallica and noble gases
"Minecraft is not a game, its real life"
Dilithium?
The *undiscovered country??
i taught we are here for an evil purpose, like only suffering. then i figured out that it's even worse, it has no reason at all. Even if our creator or creators had reason for making universe, it doesn't mean that reason is also a business of ours. Life has no meaning.
So once you pass 136 protons, you can’t keep going because the electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the strong force. You can’t achieve a proper force balance needed to keep a nucleus together. Is that what I’m hearing?
Come on. Where is Vibranium?
19:04 But what if another biology arises based on none of the 22 known proteinogenic amino acids? Thousands of amino acids play no role in terrestrial biosystems, but that does not mean an alternative biochemistry couldn't use them. A lifeform using those other amino acids would be "indigestible" to terrestrial life as we know it.
16:33 "as.. soon as is invented"
You forgot Tiberium, goddammit!
The chosen one's is the missing element
Veritasium has entered the chat 😂
Yes there is, we know there is, we have proven there is, the next stable zone is known to exist, its just incredibly hard to make them, and none of them are found on earth
Minecraft is real XD nether rite
The short answer: 🤷🏻‍♀️ The long answer: 🤷🏻‍♀️, but…
To remember I just sing the perodic table of elements song
How come the element with the highest amount of protons that we discovered/created just so happens to fully close off that row? Is creating stuff that would be in a new row just a bigger jump in difficulty or is that pure coincidence that the last current element just so happens to be a noble gas and the discoveries could have easily just ended anywhere else?
The letter "J" will someday in the expansion of the periodic table future be included.
What if we accidentally created an element that would turn all of the surrounding atoms into itself. Could that be possible?
I looked to google there are 172
Is it possible that other stable or nearly-stable "elements" could exist whose nucleii contain at least one thing other than a proton or neutron? There seems to be a whole zoo of such things with extremely short half-lives, could there be one that lucked out and had a human-scale half-life?
Yes
Half life logo ❤
Netherite is an alloy, not an element.
What about the Alpha+ model of Roberto Monti ? It seems that introducing the concept of polyneutrons helps to propose another view of the Mendeleev Table... http://www.lowenergytransmutations.org/documents/ICCF-10%20Neutrons%20Polyneutrons,%20Composition%20of%20Polyneutrons_%20.pdf
Kinda weird seeing Dilithium and Netherite in the same context.
yes, in fact were half thinking of creating one.
Element zero is for everything lol you even breathe it! Water with element zero! Ingredients(water,element zero)
To think that every element in existence is within our solar system is as smug and close-minded as kristianity
Adamantium is an alloy, not an element. So there.
You say that a nucleus prefers an even number of protons OR an even number of neutrons OR an even number of protons plus neutrons.  Isn't one of those conditions mathematically certain?
I DUNNO, MAN. Existing as an algael bloom sounds pretty sweet.
I wonder what will come out when we start applying our cutting-edge computer technologies to this problem. Quantum computers are supposed to be able to sort through large numbers of factors, correct? Can it model these nuclei? What happens if we put these predictions through an AI model? Can it find an island of stability we don't anticipate? Is there some way to put the two together? I hope this happens in my lifetime!
The next frontier isn’t finding new elements but discovering properties of isotopes. You do really bring up a good point why is element 43 the only unstable element until you reach the 3rd and 4th row. Rhodium, gold and tantalum are all odd numbered elements. And they all only have 1 isotope.
Bolognium 🥪
hi
i like you
You said netherite but it’s from minecraft so it means you play minecraft 😅
The Force hasn't been identified yet
Don't worry I've got element 119 with me.......
Greek teacher: Go to Technetium class Students: WTF
I thought this video would be about exotic atoms. Too bad that the only stable hadron is proton, otherwise out periodic table can expand even future.
5:44 why
Yes, but no.
0:06 are yall armor or tools with your first piece
u gotta be a lil crazy to watch this guy for years
I wonder why one element can take a million years to decay and another 50 minutes ? Plus if the 50 minute element is so unstable why does it last even 50 minutes ?
elements beyond the table absolutely "exist", but that doesn't mean they're stable or that they will have special magical qualities.
I had a Honda element once...it was unstable. 😮
actually netherite might be an alloy from gold and platinum, if you do research for like 10 mins then you will know that this alloy will have black oxide on the surface in real life just like in Minecraft 😎🧠
Thank You‐‐‐Wish you luck %/$/@/# for continuous discoveries.
still waiting for them to add water, air earth and fire to the periodic table
Is unobtanium hard to obtain?
Why there are gaps?  Just open with Microsoft Excel, select all tables, click edit tables, format, delete unwanted column or cell click save :)
Fun fact: Mithril actually corresponds rather well with an alloy of titanium similar to grade 5 with an extra doping of palladium for additional corrosion resistance. And naturally occurring, of course, but then it is a constructed world. One which fundamentally is meant to function along the same rules as ours (since we supposedly exist in the far future of the setting).
Damn so you tell me if I was shooting AUV/BUV beam to ⁹⁶Tc I could possibly regulate the radioactivity by just snapping + or - proton or positron
But shouldn't The milky way be one of the earliest galaxy formed after the formation of universe? Then in theory, there would be a higher probability for human beings to be one of the earliest biological local being to ever evolved.
Are there are efforts for new technologies that could possibly achieve synthesizing these heavier elements?
Math is wrong might help thinking as single numbers and separateing them
Ununennium Unbilinium Unbiunium Unbibium Unbitrium
I had i nightmare of discovering unpnoninium-undomoctoiniun
5:02 I’M DEAD LMAO  And according to Professor Wikipedia, we’d probably need a new block for row 8 between the AEMs and REMs because of relativistic effects
His pronunciation of technetium is WAY WRONG.
If there are protons there has to be negaton
I initially did not want to add this comment because there's a part of me that wants to just find myself. What do you think of the possibility of an element so massive that it is held together by gravity? Consider what electrons become after a critical potential is reached and they are ejected into vacuum. Now, keeping that in mind, what is the generally accepted theory of blackhole formation? Massive discharge of X-ray, gamma, and so on. What happens when we try to use light to detect the protons and neutrons? Doesn't interact right? Wavelengths aren't compatible. I think you can see where I'm going with this, so have fun with that rattling around your brain.
Is it okay that currently in 2024, I’m ten years old and in fifth grade, I very clearly understand this😢
Element 115...    we need to learn to use it.
Are there exoplanets where there are elements of lanthanides and actinides are more common than earth?
5:33 saying that elements have only unstable isotopes is a bit false information. There is theoretically (almost) unlimited amount of possible isotopes, and we actually do not know which may be stable in reality. If we knew, we would not doubt about "island of stability" existing or not. Correct way to say it would be: we have discovered and/or produced only unstable isotopes.
Minecraft reference lol
i mean discovered and created, whats the difference eh, we only measure these things from our limited perspective, but at the same pressure and temperatures everything is a metal, go hotter and more confined and everything is just energy, no difference between any elements at all, if we can figure out how to manipulate the strong and weak forces we could do so much, make new elements and alloys that arent decaying, setup cold fusion on a switch, all we need to figure out is what thing we need to salt the water so it boils at a lower temperature. Lowering the atmospheric pressure works, or raising the temperature, to the liquid there is little difference in the 2 actions
Your pronounciation of Mithril was criminal 😂
It’s hopefully not too late to name an element Willium!
I had that shirt when I was little lmao
This is something that AI will solve
Why actually are we looking for synthetic ways to discover an element that has no real value? I mean, its pretty cool how this work.. But why? Rather than its information or can be the new plastic, or worlds toughest material.. I know its human feelings that does this, but .. Theory have been discovered, and ... it will never be a sustainable way, but rather unkowlingly might be not so good for us. There are things that we can not grasp, or understand.  I know that somebody out there will see my bad understanding of this.. Do I even bring up any actual quesrtions to this?
Lets say we would get to the Island of stability. What properties would those elements possibly have ? How would they look like ?
Minecraft netherite
Well a black hole would certainly be useful in creating the missing ultra heavy elements.  So just create a micro blackhole the size of a carbon atom and protect it .
There are many new elements that have not been discovered yet.
This video sponsored by half life 2
At the conception of the Manhattan project, there were approximately 8 atoms of naturally occuring Plutonium on Earth... all others were produced synthetically in fast breed nuclear reactors.........
Notwithstanding their rarity Bismuth, Polonium, Astatine and Radon all occur naturally on Earth.
the scary part of alien sentient life existing is the old "cowboys and aliens" paradigm, either they are more highly advanced than we are and we end up being the 'indians' (or native americans/africans/asians/polynesians etc) or vice versa, we eventually go out there, start colonising the solar systems beyond ours and find all these primitive alien species which are unable to whitsand our tech and science and we do to them exactly what the europeans did to all native populations they encountered, in ferocity far greater than what is shown in movies like Avatar, b/c in reality ain't many who'll give half a...cent abt us enslaving and strip mining other planets, i mean we barely do here in earth abt our own species.  It scares me that we might find ourselves in the receiving end, and it scares me equally much about us finding someone who can't fight back an orbital bombardment type of 'diplomacy' (do what we tell u or we lvl your planet back to the stone age from orbit where you cant touch us, then land, enslave, etc etc).
Hey wait i also have that minecraft periodic table shirt
Bro really used a minecraft piece of netherite, he knew we would tell him to do it 😂😂😂😂
No
Element 119:     Nintendium
Netherite yess❤❤
Anyone here procrastinating instead of studying for the chem test? 🖐
I would call element 119 Pererium (Pe) after the woman who discovered the previous alkalimetal, francium, Margérite Perrer.  This is a no-brainer, Pererium for element 119. Scream it from the roofs, people!
Element 118         NINOVIUM
6:00 I just noticed on a rewatch - but that's not how the expansion of the Periodic Table would probably look like, wouldn't it? Atoms 121+ would probably get similar treatment to the Lanthanides and Actinides and probably would require another new block - considering there would likely be 50 elements for the 8th period. And that's not even including all the models that predict elements breaking some of the patterns...
zalupanium
Well anything we haven't discovered is undiscovered and we just don't know they are undiscovered.
0:06 Netherite triggered me NGL 😅😂
IF there are, they're in the center of black holes.
Duh 🙄
Dark matter
Wait until y’all find out about the three canisters with dark matter in them…  Periodic table of elements? Pft child’s play 😎
How arrogant must we be to think that we have discovered every single element yet? We're barley out of the jungle.
1:12 Nv
You forgot Naquadah and trinium
The exploration of potential undiscovered elements beyond the periodic table represents a significant scientific endeavor. 🤔 It's a testament to human curiosity and our desire to understand the universe. Any new discovery could have profound implications for physics and chemistry, potentially leading to new technologies or insights into the nature of matter
No. There are not. Next question.
its physically impossible for atomic number to go beyond 137 approx. So even if newer elements are discovered/synthesized, the limits at around 137
Cocanium: the most expensive element on the periodic table
Imagine armour piercing tank rounds in the future
I have the exact same shirt, used to wear it all the time in high school almost 10 years ago haha.  What small world we live in.
When I was in school, the last elements names were basically translations of their number themselves, they didn't had a proper name yet
There were, there are and there will be.
Dilithium is actually a real substance. You get it by bonding two lithium atoms.
Excrodium
Is there any point in having an infinite table ?.😅🤪
yes
Why is he wearing children's clothing?
Understanding this is one thing but knowing it so well you can contribute to the knowledge seems supernatural to me. I will never know what it’s like to have a mind like that
We still have more than 100 element ls to discover. Star Trek told me.
His shirt lol
118 elements
There Is 0 which is (n)  So 7 is (N)
2, 8, 8, 18, 18, 32, 32, ... What's the next number in this sequence ? In other words, if/when we create element 119, and that starts a new row on the periodic table, how wide will that new row be ?
they shouldnt look for more elements until after i'm done with school, i aint memorizing all that
Idc about others but I want netherite
Summary?
Trans uranium elements are not naturally occurring, they are not “discovered”. they’re created. This is not a moot point because using insane amounts of energy to try and fuse heavier elements that instantly rip themselves apart is kind of pointless and getting somewhat dangerous.
What a load of hooey. Sugdenium is gray and glows a green under UV light
Excellent channel. Live long and prosper.🖖
FASCINATING, I tell you 🤩
Lol ofc theres new elements      We have only probed our planet and our surroundings   And Thats like 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% of the Universe ❤ In one million years there will be 2 times as many elements on the periodic tabel
The element between ruthenium an Mo (I don’t know how to pronounce it) Is technetium 2:29
Went from here straight to bobby broccoli
Tungsten and Osmium have no stable isotopes, but the longest lived ones have such a long half life that quantum tunneling will make them iron first.
short answer: yes because the periodic table didnt start with this many elements, theres obviously more to be found
We do live in the plastics age, not in the silicon age.
my science teacher has told be theres a debate going on if theres 1 another element
Unobtainium means impossible/undiscovered element
I've always dreamt about a fictional,, futuristic process in which we are able to stabilise all the radioactive elements and use them at their full potential. Like, imagine what would those elements be used for if they weren't unstable.
Wow
Forget heavier elements that only fall apart. What about lighter elements lighter than hydrogen, could they potentially exist.
Kryptonite isnt a real element? Superman was all a lie then.
Has anyone ever considered that more elements could be synthesized and be stable if they were under more pressure? Like for instance the gravity and pressure of a gas giant like Jupiter. At the very least there could be unique chemistry involved like metallic hydrogen for example.
I call dibs on 119 being obamium
Funny how science can be wrong sometimes. I read  a article from around 1990 when 118 elements was not discovered yet. Back then its was 105. Science said back then that element 118 should be very stable, but this clip said otherwise.
ok but why am i focusing on his BEAUTIFUL periodic table of M I N E C R A F T
All i want is one element to be named Steve
Bob Lazar predicted unumpentium, 115, what came of that?
5:08 good one
Not to nitpick... Okay, absolutely to nitpick, you mention mithril really early on, but I'm pretty sure that's an alloy, not an element. By its properties, a titanium alloy.
None of these new elements will be of any use, all radio active and very unstable.
How about a neutron star?    Can those be thought of as a type of nucleus?
Can we name the next one surprise
PhilSchneiderpurportedToHaveAsampleOfElement140backin1995.
I have that T-Shirt! That's so cool
I dont need to memorise the periodic table i just need to revise the periodic table of minecraft. (FINAlY i can finaly enjoy my studies)
I came here to look at his shirt the whole video.
Leave me alone
9:18 I think it was the other way around
I'm going to rewatch the video on acid XD Amazing Video!!! I can't imagine how much you have had to lern to make such a good video!
Yes. Indeed there are. You know what? After like 20 years, a new element would be created.
Can’t forget about Vibraninum
0:06 Netehrite is an alloy composed of Gold, Iron, Carbon, and *???*
I’m pretty sure Netherite is based on a compound found in an asteroid that hit earth.
Pretty sure netherite was an alloy
You forgot copium.
5:59 Hey wait a minute, period 8 would have a g orbital, where's your "double  Lanthanum" expansion? lol
Harry HE LIkes BEer Bitter Cold Not Over Frothy. Never NAsty MuGs ALlowed. SIlly People Should CLean ARgon Kegs CArefully. little saying to remember the first 22 in order.

Each larger element is simply the addition of a proton in the nucleus. Isotopes of that element are created by varying the neutrons in the nucleus, and ions are created by varying the number of electrons in the orbitals. Generally, as atoms get larger, they get more unstable (though this is not strictly always the case), so it becomes more and more difficult to find larger elements ocuring in nature. However larger elements can always be theoretically artificially created by combining smaller elements together. Therefore there are necessarily larger elements than what have been discovered.
I like his shirt! 😂
annyira nem értem az angolt . A tolmács , miatt kérném , lassabban mondja . köszönöm megoldva
I would love so badly for a miracle element just beyond the periodic table to exist but realistically it’s not the case sadly. Science fiction becoming science fact is the most exciting part of living at this point in human history, at least to me it is. I want to see brilliant minds bring what is only theoretical or downright imaginary into reality, although I likely won’t live long enough to see some of my sci-fi dreams be realized I do hope I will. Humanity kinda sucks at most things on a macro scale but I do want to see how far we go. Even with all the bad I want to root for team human ya know?
netherite
Our whole universe is an electron and each electron around you has separate universe
Wow! Never heard of protons and neutrons having their own “shells” like electrons! Really neat.
I believe there are, but they have lived out their half lives and don't exist for a useable time.
Freemanium <3
5:26   Okay for real, there are stable isotopes above 83  They are just not that common on earth  But you might just wiggle your way out if this by asking what makes an isotope „stable“
.... bolognum?!?!
I love that bismuth is extraordinarily weakly radioactive.
Dang that shirt is nostalgic
I don't understand why you left out Chineseium
I feel like the comments quorum at the end was way more interesting than the video👍, no offense
Landing on a small asteroid. .
when we have a factory pumping out 100ton space telescopes and launching a dozen a year, i will give the fermi paradox a second thought
Vibranium bro
The shape of the two islands of stability seems similar. I sense there might be some kind of geometrical inverse progression between the distance from one island to the other, and its size, but its shape won't change.
Surprise ain’t on there 🤷‍♂️
I really wish for an additional video continuing the story of the island. One of the most interesting topics yet to be demystified.
state and local governments have billions left from goverment subsidies from pandemic aid w t f lolz
This does not have to be a 20 minute video, just tell me yes or no
I’m positive no one knows the atomic weight of Bolognium
I am a little confused. On my school paper with the periodic table, it says element 118 is ununoctium but in your video you said something completely different. Can you explain that to me please?
I've looked all over the current periodic table, and i still can't find the element of surprise
eka francium in element 119
How about Corian
In 9th grade in my chemistry class i did this pretty cool exercise in thought where we looked at the fictional material vibranium from marvel and tried to figure out where it would go on the periodic table based on its properties. Fun stuff
Its not wrong, what would happen if we could artificially change the number of protons, electrons and neutrons to one higher than the current highest know element? The only issue is... were talking that this is smaller than atomic scale so its impossible for us humans right now  Honestly, I may be speaking a load of BS rn but it makes sense in my head
The next element is suprise
I have always thought the manmade elements are funny. They smash 2 elements together and only last for micro seconds. Calling them unstable. Its like throwing a cat and a dog together with catapults and then calling the 'new' animal unstable. The new cat/dog is just  unstable creature that only lasts for micro seconds before 'decaying' into more natural substances
Obsidianataratusmaratrirasomanyrium is obsidian
The universe is way too big for it to only be made out of 114 elements.
Bolognium
I found element 119 Uue
Netherite is actually an alloy 🤓
Well more protons closer together mean a more powerful electromagnetic force, right? so more neutrons can spread them out, thus restricting the force. So maybe the number of protons also have the same affect on the strong nuclear force. I'm just speculating here but there is some method behind it.
Can someone please tell me something about element 115?
Exist any other graph of proton/neutron with extreme conditions as pressure ? Because, I thin, elements are not straight on line, as was on this old graph. Thank you from Slovakia - Europe, it was very interesting video.
If an "island of stability" for super-heavy elements exists, evidence for their existence should appear in the spectra of every neutron star merger.
How about Frymium? Can't that be a element?
Don’t ruin my dreams of dilithium existing 🥲
They're called Universal Alloys.  Get with it bro
We're not seeing an empty universe, we just have bad vision.
I am addicted to ⚛️ chemistry!!
Perfect reasoning at the end of this video. We are as far as we can see, in relation to astronomy. With all our attempts sight-seeing thus far, all our reasoning that atleast microbial life has common range chances, we continue to find nothing conclusive.  that’s all the more free space for us to explore though, right??? ^.^
Netherite is a compound tho, it's 50% gold
would it be possible to stabilize these elements under extreme pressures? i mean they were formed in the cores of massive stars and id like to believe they didnt just go poof under that pressure if it works like that then we could get an assist pushing us to this island of stability or beyond
there probably is more, but just random singular hybrid atoms 65 billion lightyears away on some barren planet
When he said "netherite" I felled that
Yup
Netherite was more like a alloy that is made of a unkown element with gold lol
How many elements have we missed due to decay before we even existed?
bro pulled the iron from minecraft💀
science that claims there are no impossibles left is science that has died.
You missed a great chance to name the new element "Sugdnese". Frequently used in making tiny spheres, if you know what I mean.
Look for ultraheavy elements at the galactic core, or in objects from the old starfields of the galactic core
Sugdenium nutz
The universal periodic table is so much bigger then we will ever know
Yea 115 and the new rock crystal thing in Congo
I think you could argue that we do know of at least one island of stability on the VERY heavy end of the scale - neutron stars, a.k.a "Neutronium"
We're still talking about large undertakings to create elements towards the next "stability island" - i wouldnt even begin to fathom how much a gram of the stable thing would cost...
Surely as the atom gets larger, the electrostatic repulsive forces between the protons would overcome the very short range attractive nuclear forces?
I could recite all 103 elements when I was 11 back in ‘82. In about 30secs, sounded like a kid selling cattle at auction.
He also discovered aunt germanium, but her photograph is no longer displayed on the box.
He really mentioned netherite  ALSO WHERE CAN I GET DAT SHIRT
0:13 the only miracolous properties new elements may have are lethal doses of radiation
Isotope lives matter! The standard table of elements doesn't mention isotopes. Isotopes have different properties from the elements on the table. Anyone who tries to assemble nuclear fuel knows this. Maybe there are new isotopes of existing elements that have special properties. For example, Deuterium and Tritium are isotopes of Hydrogen, but maybe we just haven't discovered Quadritium, Quintitium, Sexitium, etc. (i.e., 4, 5 and 6 neutrons.) As I'm typing this, you are starting to talk about isotopes. My point is we don't need to discover new elements, just new isotopes. Aha, now you are talking about the island of stability. Great work. I hope someone discovers something new and great about the periodic table before I kick the bucket.
I have stable bolognium, I’m gonna fry it up this Sunday.
Early, lol. The universe is 42 trillion years old. We are not early.
Arguing that we’re the first sentients in the universe because we haven’t detected radio communications from them is like an isolated Stone Age  tribe deciding no other people exist because they hadn’t seen campfire smoke signals from them. Just because we haven’t invented something that sidesteps the speed of light problem doesn’t mean it can’t be sidestepped. We don’t know what we don’t know.
Just wanna point out that Eezo would be BEFORE the periodic table not beyond it as element zero, otherwise know as neutronium.
Technetium There is no configuration of neutrons That can stabilize this Unhappy nucleus
if we are the random selection of the complete human population across the ages then with the current growth of population you would need to assume the humanity is about to get extincted in couple decades to make me and you random person from the very middle of the population xD Otherwise the likelyhood of selecting a random person wil always be in the future. So yeah there is a bit of a flaw with that reasoning, someone needs to come first...
WAIT SO ELEMENT 43 ISN'T CYRAXIUM? With a half life of SEVEN YEARS!
Hello Gordon.
Honestly it's to late for Humanity to hide from any advanced Civilization now we have been pumping Radio waves into space for Decades and if Any advanced life os out there its only a Matter of time before they detect those waves and aim at us I guess now we should wonder if it will be there spacecraft for Diplomatic Reason or their Weapons to Eliminate us
As far as reference class goes...I think it far too early to call the 21st Century the less brutal existence in 4B years. With the lack of stability at the Super Power level now and the presence of nuclear weapons, we could be at the cusp of the most brutal existence ever!
l learned (or better said, relearned) in these 20 minutes about molecular physics than I did in 5 years in high school. You're a great educator. I hated physics back in high school in large part because the way it was instructed simply didn't connect in my brain in an intuitive manner.
I've had Tc-99m in my body.
Qwwwwww              Eh fu                                                            Clap                    Lol            ❤❤❤
I am not certain, but elements with more then 130 protons would be completely unstable because the strong positive electric field at nucleus would be capable of separating virtual electron positron pairs from the vacuum. Then the real positron would annihilate releasing energy that would destabilize any nucleus.
I'm saying 144
Why not Inorganic life? Intelligent clouds of muons or a conscious magnetic field? Why are you so Parochial? So pinched in a line you can't see out of?
if a group of electron were emmited from a white dwarf caught in a nearby supernova some of the unkown elements could group with the electrons to natrually appear in the earths crust
massive atoms can be kept stable by spare electrons with other electrons being repeled toward the nucleus that the nucleus is crushed and takes longer to decay than normal (MY IDEA)
Just waiting for our great grandkids to discover a new element and name it Netherite 😂
Give that T-Shirt an Oscar
There are probably thousands of elements we currently haven't discovered but exist, considering we've barely discovered any of the ocean, I would assume there are lots of elements down there we currently haven't discovered, plus other planets in the solar system likely contain hidden elements inside of them.
There's ununennium which is element 119
Based on a previous video, it wouldn't surprise me if the very last element possible is an element 137, perhaps with a half life of a planck time, trouble is, creating it might destroy the universe in an instant 😂😂
It seems like any intelligent beings that are intelligent enough to ask these questions would also be susceptible to being a victim of their own power. They probably all accidentally or intentionally nuke themselves. And nukes might be weak compared to what kind of weapon a more advanced species can invent. E = mc2 means there's enough energy contained within the matter making up the Earth to blow up the entire solar system. They probably all blow themselves up or get wiped out with disease or create artificial intelligence capable enough to wipe them out long before any colonization. Look how close we have come to a nuclear holocaust, look how close we are to it right now. It's insanity, we'll never survive as a species like this.
No, the last ten or so have been artificially created
Kinda unrelated but Netherite is an alloy, not an element
Would sprinkling 43 protons on a neutron star count as a stable isotope of technetium?
doesn't nuclear bombs use an unstable isotope of Uranium or something? so in getting to the "stable islands", do we expect only positive things to result from this discovering process? just saying.
Assholoium
Crapolanium
Adamantium...hope it exists
Another excellent video. Thanks!
Bro dressed as a periodic table of minceraft
And also how it works is by using the grey circle thing that is on the video circle thing
I have an idea but I've been thinking of a while and I called the Adam Ranger and it arranges Adams so you'll be able to make lots of materials lots of types of materials

This is a human knowing so much I am a human But I am so stupid as this human is so so speed of light clever...
Do protons and neutrons move related to one another inside of the nucleo or does the nucleo just move altogether?
Yes ….Humans can see the Tv 📺…but not what’s Showing…woof woof 🤪
netherite 🤣🤣🤣
let's feed an AI with all important factors and have it search for a stable element outside the known periodic table.
i want the first element in the island in stability to be susamogusium
You didn't mention the abundance of Bullshitium, there's plenty of that here on Earth.
Our future is not very bright if we can not tame our inner ape. For those that think if only our smartest most educated can lead us out of the darkness. Consider the lesson of Star Trek the wrath of Khan. Even the most perfect and intelligent can not defeat the nature of the ape that lives inside us.  Today in 2023 we see the intellectuals and the elites working hard to deconstruct the cultures and systems that have carried us form our primitive past. The do it with the best intentions of building a better future. A future they envision but for all intensive purposes may not be possible. Humanity may already be in it's final stage facing it's great wall, with nose diving birth rates and increasing amounts of people with out purpose or a future. Vast amounts of people suffering substance abuse and unemployment. The A.I. revolution may very well be the nail in the coffin for us. As vast swaths of people may not be needed to run society.   This is a dark take of the future but a probable one and a good example of a possible Femi paradox in action.  I for one hope we can escape this kind of fate. My fear is that humanity has not matured enough to make the hard choices to advert this fate. Rather we seem to moving in the other direction.
I'd be willing to bet that if we are ever able to get tonthe point if making elements in the island of stability they will unlock a whole slew of new technology.  Room temperature and pressure superconductors.  Easier ways to achieve lower temperature fusion reactors.  Hopefully we can get there at some time in the future.
yes
Dark matter would have its own periodic table.
I would expect the next row of the periodic table to be even longer than the current ones. Every two rows, we see the addition of a new electron orbital (the rare earths actually fit in the table, but are dropped below it for display purposes). And with the next row, we're due for a fifth electron orbital type with 18 electrons.
You forgot Whackamolium!
this episode was massively elemental in understanding chemistry. i actually get all this stuff now. thanks dude. belly rubs.
UCL152 URAINIUM TARECHCLORIDE KAZAKHSTAN!
I had several products that used Unobtalium, including replacement parts. My knowledge is Pre-Google, but y'all can check.
I've just started watching the video and... Netherite? What is this, Minecraft?
Simple answer. Yes.
The bigger you are the faster you decay, well except for black holes
eyy my brother also has the periodic table of minecraft shirt
i am planning on making a magic sci fi animation series and the periodic table ould have like a single box on it which whould just say "this is the usseles element box, singular reason why we discovered 2000 different elements and put them in this box was becouse we had to use magic to slow down time, all of those elements are uselles and unnamed becouse they decay too fast and no one cares at this point, at this point new alloys are more exciting, there was one element that had the half life of uranuim but so radioactive that our whole city was irradiated for 10 years  before we had the time to put it into a bismuth box that at this point would end any human, but since we are magical beings we screw around with that"
A black hole probably has some wild elements surrounding it you will never get to investigate.
❤
Time for Lemmyum ;-) 🤘🤘🤘
no elements are "undiscovered", we know what they are just another proton...that is harder and harder to keep stable...done
the reason we dont know these other element is cause our earth isnt strong enough to make these element.  our pressure gravity isnt high enough, thankfully, if it was higher humans would be paste.
What happens to an element when it reaches the end of its "life"? Does it turn into a new element?
I like to imagine dark matter elements.
What about the nuclear reactor debris that is over 2 billion years old?
It's like prime numbers, massive ones are rare but look long enough and ye shall find.
Sugdenium is crazy
They still have Pizzagate and 911......
Other elements may be created in neutron or other stars think of what a black hole could create. Aliens use small amounts of antimatter for energy in there batteries
what if we find out that its not an island but a continent and find out we are the island
SO SO SO MANY ELEMENTS that are not on Earth.   Hate that humans are so egocentric to think that because they have not discovered them yet, they clearly must not exist.  Stupid
It's funny to think of but we have plenty of stable elements that are... kinda useless. Imagine if we achieved a brand new stable element! And it's totally useless. Literally no useful properties whatsoever.
The extended periodic table is pretty interesting. The largest theoretical element on it has the atomic no. 168 "Unhexoctium"
Everyone should mention: GOD OF THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE CREATED EVERYTHING ABOUT SIX THOUSAND YEARS AGO.  NO SUCH THING AS EVOLUTION OR MILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF YEARS OF AGO. DINOSAURS LIVED WITH MAN.  FOLLOW ASTROPHYSICIST DR JASON LISLE✝️✝️
Idk if netherite is a element since it's mixed with gold but tbh idk where netherite scraps come from but the netherite ingot is an alloy
This Gentleman is explaining very well. When explaining complicated physics he may discover new ideas or rejecting old theory that can't be true.
I prefer the Elder Race.
HOW DO THEY IGNORE THE MOST IMPORTANT MISSING ELEMENT.??????    VIBRANIUM!!!!!!  the secret sauce in the Dieney MCU!!!!!    it can do anything!   because they dont own the rights to the REAL magic element in Marvel comics... ADAMANTIUM!
Just a curious question 👀 how do we know for sure TC 97 has a half life of 4.2 million years??   Who messured this?   To be clear , i know zero about this stuff. All i know is it’s hard to believe if somebody’s talking about millions of years without the possibility to messure or verify it in any way
The way I see it if there was an island of stability amidst undiscovered higher elements we would've already found them because they'd be stable and therefore occur in places.  Also you forgot to mention Nintendium.
On the end of the video, in all likelihood, given our track record, if were first and make it past the great filter, we'll probably create the dark forest solution to the Fermi paradox
“Americium is critical in smoke detectors so it is an artificial element that has saved many lives…”           Yep, all in a day’s work for the America of elements. 🇺🇸⚛️🎆😊💪🏽
why am i getting this 4th grader type video recced to me
Why are there neutrons?
What if after element 120, the table splits like it does for actinides and lanthanides
18:31 👍Good idea. In general, the video is great. And, although I do not believe in the possibility of "colonizing the Universe" and I am sure that modern people overestimate their capabilities, you still need to subscribe to your channel
What if the elements' atomic numbers went into the negative numbers, fractional numbers, and complex numbers.
He's a real one for including Element Zero
Yes they exist, one day we will discover it, after that either we become type 1 civilization or get completely vanished 😂
115?
Technetium is pronounced Tech-Nee-Shee-Umm. I work with Tc99m everyday!
elements are like a pass code 4 numbers there are only but so meny passwords 9 12 15 21 number the amounts of passwords goes up Exponentially like PI.
I wonder if the other elemants exist in different dimensions?
Well netherite is technically an alloy. Gold + ancient debris
if we could manipulate the weak force we could make anything.
i wonder what would a black hole would be made of if we could just grab a piece of it, super massive black holes(yes i understand a teaspoon would just destroy our solar system but what if we could is my question)
Due to Google Autoplay; I listened to this again while reading a GrimDark story. A weird scene in the story where the MC was doing Surgery on her own heart in a sort of real Dreamscape, and added the remnant soul of the clone of herself that tried to kill her...to her own heart. Uh it is "Final Boss Best Friends Litrpg Apocalypse" So because I was mostly paying attention to what I was reading, I'd say only 20% of my attention was on listening to this Periodic Table video. But at 18 minutes in the afterward; is the sentences I will rephrase "Life has existed for 4 billion years on Earth, so why do I exist in the least brutal time period of those 4 billion years?" Was referring to Bostrom and considering the self as an average lifeform for a life reference class etc. That was an interesting sentence because it was claiming TODAY is the LEAST Brutal AKA difficult in a Survival of the Fittest sense...of all the 4 Billion year history of Earth. It is why I switched from reading to writing this reply; I do not agree and do not understand why someone would claim that. Civilization of 8 Billion Humans who compete with winners and losers...ALSO has millions of people who are cooperating for the greater good. So all Tax Payers are cooperating for the greater good; by paying taxes because that is the agreement, and the belief that Governments have flaws and make mistakes, but governments are less likely to be PURELY selfish for profit. Ummm so much in that I will not clarify more cause it has been covered by actual experts and I don't wanna. Sigh...anyway IMO Earth today is no more or less brutal for life in general; it is a delusion to think that 8 billion more or less cooperating Humans who reduce Hunter Gatherer struggles...means there is less struggles for other species. Or perhaps call it Hubris? Whatever...just I described why I disagree with that claim. Note: it might actually be true...but only if judged thousands of years in the future, and it would be really hard to quantify and judge that truth if so = I just do not think it could be PROVEN as true today even if it is true. Mental Gymnastics of Definitions;-)
Absolutely elements exist beyond the periodic table.  A few have already been created and subsequently incorporated.  Couple more reactor accidents and we should have another new one.
Half-life 3 confirmed!
Neutronium
Yes
Hi Matt! Thanks for doing all the amazing shows. I've been seeing a bunch of videos in my feed lately about the presence of xenon-129 on mars only being explainable with massive nuclear detonations some 300 million years ago, I'm very skeptical about that and was wondering what is xenon 129, what are the processes involved in its formation and is it really impossible for it to occur naturally? thanks.
When you said netherrite you showed an iron ingot you rascal 0:09
you forgot elemental paperclips. I love you  Matt
I’m always amazed at how early scientist discovered… stuff. Take Mendelev, arranging the known elements to their known atomic weight… the dude was born in 1834!
9:54  is crazy 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Unobtanium would be the holy grail 😂
I can't wait until we have a particle assembler - we can then just plug it into machine learning and BAM!
Me after watching black panther
give this guy an award for having a minecraft shirt
Want a simple answer? The elements at the PERIODIC TABLE is NOT COMPLETE. Not gonna be surprised if CHEMIST discovers a new ELEMENT if within decades. We bring back new samples from Martian Soil. OR on a ASTEROID BELT.
I believe people are confusing new Materials with new Elements.
The current ages are based on technologies. Most people use the names industrial, electric, nuclear, digital, and smart. It's usually era now instead.
Island of Stability? I think you mean the "Dev Tools." :)
119-Fluffium (Fu) 120-Sparklium (Sp) 121-Sparklingium (Sk) 122-Rainbowium (Ri) 123-? (?) 124-Vibromium (Vb) This is an &(-_ of the year 20** and the thing is i go in here to tell you the next secret ;"(₱-"?*-"?*:₱(₱-₱!3)"-?₱-"?₱:"(₱;?*).
I suspect the is a stable element with a trillion proton's I'm calling it Trillyon
This man could have made Minecraft into a whole new level
Черный  Материя. Состоит Из. Енержи.  ( Атомы. ) 🇦🇿
It’s Aug 2022 and his alien conjecture is dead.
Less talking, more showing. It getting boring
Science Fiction or science fantasy?  Star War really ruined quality Science fiction forever.
LK-99 FTW! ^.^
Dude, you live in this time because this time made you. In another time, even being born 5 seconds later or sooner, it wouldn't be you but another you because your experience would inevitably be different and thus your brain would develop even slightly differently
***lazar entered the chat 🛸
Are his elbows glued to his sides? His hand movements are so unnatural.
It can be made in a lab, and has a half life measured in microseconds  but cannot occur naturally. In my view that's not a element.
Is it possible that heavy unstable elements are unstable because of entropy and time dilation at atomic scales due to the space-time warping effects of their concentrated mass?
You mention an “even number of protons + neutrons” but surely this is actually the most unstable since you have an unpaired proton and an unpaired neutron. Since protons and neutron are distinguishably different particles, the Pauli exclusion principle shouldn’t apply to the interaction of a proton and a neutron together despite them both being fermions right?
The stable version of element 115! ✨️ 🚀
element 115 didnt exist until about 15 years ago, amazingly after Bob Lazar came out saying he was working for US Govt secret ufo project and happened to mention element 115 was the element primarily used in propulsion.
The next stable element will have atomic number of 420, with 69 more neutrons than protons (489 neutrons).
May i just say, i never heard this story assuming that anything below lead could be found in some quantities somewhere. Learn something new everyday. Thankyou so much for your channel.
Where is all the Lithium at? It is the 3rd element, shouldn't it be the 3rd most common element?
I love how the Video is about undiscovered elements  And at least two of the examples at the beginning (adamantium and netherite) can be argued to not be elemental to begin with. One is stated to be an alloy and the other is at least crafted by using gold
Is there a stable isotope of element 114?
Still missing over 1000 elements.
Yes.
we need Vibranium.. discover that
Back in the day,  and I am goingway back, when I first learnt about anti-matter, as a concept, and stilll in the throes of the Dr Whgo rep[lacement on the BBC called 'Star trek', I pondered the ideo of 'dilithium' being a semi=stable mi9neral composed of Lithium and anti-lithium, which allowed the intermix of anti-matter and matter.  Asssuming such a concept, would dilithium actually be considered an element, or wuld it be a psuedo alloy?????
Netherite:v
love yout shirt, great video !
Reminds me of a video game, were before we can get to the good stuff, we need to advance up the tech tree.
Alien element -  tridexunpantium T290
Ayeee I love your Minecraft shirt hahaha I used to ship sooo many of those when I worked at J!nx
Bob lazar predicted element 115
Some of those exist in Final Fantasy. Good enough for me. :)
Odd the title of this article is about elements, but the narrative is about reference classes and civilization. What’ up w that?
So as time spans get infinitesimal smalls an infinite number of elements are possible (though not perceivable for human sensority)?
What are life times (or half times) of actinides and actinides?
Neutron stars are a kind of quantum object, since they are made of neutrons packed together as tightly as they are in the nuclei of elemental atoms.
All elements are in the periodic table. New ones just extend the table.
Bob Lazar has a hidden, secret sample of a stable isotope of Muscovium (element 115)
I hope this island will have exotic matter on it. I really want that hyperdrive to exist.
MendeleYEv
Okay. Now I will tell you about what you said earlier answering Eliah zayin. We, humans are the best creation of our one and only creator, who is Almighty. It is his (Allah) kindness so that we can understand that and also do whatever he wants. Which is always good.
GUYS I MADE ELEMENT 6969696969696969 AND IT IS ABOUT TO EAT MY PC-
If there was an "island of stability" out there past 118, why wouldn't those elements have already been created by the usual natural processes? Like the exploding supernova?
Elements around number 360 are stable and probably dark matter
Yes of course, as we eventually travel to the stars and other planets away from out own solar system we fill find new elements
Out of curiosity, is there any research indicating that environmental factors can  influence an atoms stability?  Gravity, pressure, temperature, or anything really.
you forgot Fartanium.
This technetium sounds alot like space craft material 🧐
can you imagine it being stable unstable stable then unstable again. to account for the gaps in the periodic table
Why did you skip Stalinium? The most memeworthy element.  But the only element I'm looking for is a replacement for my freezer element.
Thank you for the little half-life Easter egg in the video
Loved that tshirt
If I have money and a Patreon account, I'm naming my account "Ligma" so that if they're gonna name another element, I'd have a chance to be chosen.
I want a bolognium sandwich
Any element is theoretically possible, but they're not all stable. It doesn't mean they don't exist or haven't been discovered.
My dad has shirt that says "[Ah], element of surprise"
The pre hydrogen quasi elements are going to be the discovery of our time.
Yay! Matt's an SCP fan!
Kryptonite is real. It's a gas and not the kind that is shown in superman comic books and cartoons.
Schrabidium and ghiorsium
So much interest in new elements to help us in the future, when we might just need a lot more tritium.
Horrible video of nothing but pseudo science sci-fi.
There are so many more elements to be discovered on other planets that we havent found yet
If there are stable "superheavy" elements, wouldn't they exist in nature? And wouldn't we have discovered them by now?
Element 115????!!!!!????!!!! COD!!!!!!
I'd love this if it didn't have you in it. Your vanity spoils the video
Forgot beskar
New element that I just discovered in 2020 is netherite ingot
Vibranium
His shirt makes this all the funnier! 🤣
Maybe exploring a binary nuclear makeup will work...
mmmm bolognium
Technically, yes, beyond what's already discovered the table could go on ad nauseam, the question is how much energy you can pump in order to create even bigger lump of protons and neutrons and how long it could exist without disintegrating into cloud of fission fragments. Nothing says there is a final element, after which the table ends.
you forgot genagium
I seem to remember Adamantium as being an alloy, as when you smelt it, it's liquid first, then after it becomes a solid has a melting point vastly higher than before, to the point of absurdity.
I dont look the video now, just correct me if im wrong. Yes, there are more Elements, but they disappear way faster by radiation, so you would loose them the moment you try to measure theyr existence. So theoretically, there should be no limit for the ammount of Protons, Neutrons and Electrons.
Space Time :- Elements having more than 118 protons can't be detected  Also Space Time :- We invented element 267 💀💀💀
I mean, there is the element of surprise
AVP    sweet / yeah I  thought  so /   but  yah  Kurt online is one /
if a 118 + proton element would be fast enough it should be detectable, same way as myons.
Orichalcum!
Well, we haven’t discovered naquadah yet, so I’m still hopeful
How isn't this obvious?
"Netherite." Yeah, baby! 😆
With the stability graph, can someone please explain why there's that chasm (I belive at uranium?) Before things get more "stable" again?
random thought.  they're neutrons and electrons.  but could the high elements that need a unknow 3rd?
I know a new element, its produced by firing an atom up some unsepecting guys ass without his permission.  The result can create galaxies.
Yes we only get to understand plasma and nothing else beyond that while heat can go above what we can make on earth
Even if it's nothing like how HBM's Nuclear Tech Mod portrays it (and/or the atomic number, AMU number, etc. are both wrong), could Schrabidium exist?
no one said dilithium was an element. and "space faring" materials can be alloys. really the ignorance of the these chemists...
Doesn't gravity, gases in the environment, and temperatures show off earth other elements exist.
While these elements are theoretically possible, the energy requirements to create them is too large and they couldn't exist long in a stable configuation for more than a micro second.
13:00  Nice.
I remember reading a acience fiction book deactibing elements that pnly can exost in molecules .   I thought that was a pretty creative way of solving the stability problwm.
Can a quasar produce enough energy to make those elements from that stability island?  And could those elements be dark matter?
Short half life means less is needed, does not mean it is safer.
Wasn't adamantium an alloy?
Rip to the Indian education system who removed the period table from course...
Until we get to Neutron Star material I dont think we discovered every element. For all we know there could be an Iron man metal stable beyond all the radioactive elements.
where can I buy that shirt
Stop moving your god damn hands so much.
Thank you for this. Working on worldbuilding new elements. Plan is, a new subatomic particle, one that has its own stages of matter in its own right, but can combine in the nucleus of an atom to make it more stable and more able to store/conduct "energy".
Note:  I do not have a science background and simply watch these videos because I find them interesting.  At 7:42 does this mean that the electromagnetic force is actually stronger than the strong nuclear force?  If once the protons are directly next to each other the electromagnetic force is capable of overpowering the strong nuclear force?
6:00 definitely a wasted opportunity to discuss the potential of g-block elements being discovered after element 120. There was a brief mention of filling electron shells earlier, so that would have been a good point to explain s-, p-, d-, & f-block. Predictions of orbital shapes in these regions have also been proposed.  Also, it's oddly hilarious that, at 7:35, you talk about the Electromagnetic force getting larger than the strong nuclear force, but you have the protons move _closer_ together?
The possible uses for nuclear stable synthetic elements in engineering and metallurgy could open a new era of technology and progression that I'm all for.
Stable elements under normal condition...possibly.  I think the parameter space that is largely unexplored are unique high energy environments where the coupling constants are different.  Different physics is likely to produce different realms of stability.
Universe is still a big mystery and still keeps on expanding, who knows what other elements we will discover as we progress everyday.
Adamantium actually is an alloy - not an element. It is a combination of steel and vibranium.
0:07     a n g o t
orichalcum hey? Nerd. I got that reference.
Remember that when the space Emperor was looking to control all the available Gravium of the galaxy we had to call Captain Flam .
Sweet oxygens
SO INTERESTING! Thanks PBS Spacetime! ❤
There are probably no STABLE elements that we have not found.   But if you have enough energy at your disposal, you might stick any number of protons, neutrons, and electrons together to create new elements, but they would decay to lighter elements with astonishing speed.
Amongst them only Celerium from call of duty more closer to reality.
Gold has 41 known isotopes, ranging from gold-170 to gold-210. Only one of these, gold-197, is stable. We have made 7 isotopes for 114 how can we be so sure its unstable at that point?
Of course
Wolverine agrees
You can go on adding 'new elements' which have half lives of a few seconds but they are only curiosities for the lab. I remember there was a supposed to be a hypothetical band of superheavy elements which were 'relatively' stable, but still not found in nature.
Elements are produced in supernovae.  I think if there were 'stable' elements heavier than what is the periodic table, they would be found on Earth.  There is much mathematical modelling on the stability of elements, and an island of 'stability centred around element 126 is about it.
There are definitely more elements out there in the universe. A lot of which we are completely uncapable of making or even knowing about them . I'm pretty sure there is some very wild stuff out there just waiting to be discovered
what about the super heavy element, *disappointment*
You forgot element 167: plotholmium!
Of course there are. If the universe is infinite and always expanding, theoretically the elements that make up that universe are likewise infinite in both quantity and variation.
_"Elements prefer to have an even number of neutrons, an even number of protons, or an even number of protons plus elections"_ -- that's good, because that's guaranteed to be true of any nucleus.
There has to be. Probably quite a few more. You have to think that when they talk about finding whatever new particle from CERN using a few certain atoms. Imagine when you can do that with every element on the table what could be found. Not to mention atoms reacting to environments we can’t come close to duplicating producing their elements.
Yes,that's why there are gaps.
What I wanna know is, what would be the cutoff of decay for something to be consider to not exist as an element. So for example if an element exist for only 1 nanosecond, then do we say it just decays super fast or at which point to you just say like, "Yeah... that probably doesn't count lol".
New discovered element: Ninovium 121 (joke)
I have no idea why ppl ask these questions look up into the sky in any direction there's billions of stars planets and so on I highly doubt we have discovered everything is extremely ignorant
Certainly... many elements were unfound at some time...
I think to fantasize that one day we will have elements with insane properties. As light as tin but has the hardness of carbon. Such fictional elements are always cool to think about and I think any advance alien civilization would be masters in material science and have all sorts of materials at their disposal
real ones know about a proposed second island.
There was a family called the Betz who found a metallic ball after their land was mysteriously set and fire. The ball had strange properties, when a scientist examined it, he realized that there was a even smaller object inside. He estimated the object had an atomic number of 140+ was terrified of even breaking it because he feared explode like an atomic bomb. Sadly, the family was exploited and the sphere was stolen from them. Smh
What about Chinesium?
netherite is a alloy meaning its composite and not an "element"
Runescape FTW😙
5:10 Nice Half-Life reference
its obvious that there will be more elements in the future, its will be so arrogant of humans to think that what they discover is what there is.
For stable being elements?!
184!?
What about Scot's ale?  It's a wee-bit heavy 😂
@popculturescientist is a PhD student at Oxford researching & designing plasma accelerators. How will that new technology help us get closer to the island of stability?
Yes probable around other stars and gone supernovae
Bro called adamantium an element 😐😐😐
... a new SUckdemium element ? ... hhm, interesting ! Who's doing the Box ???
Hand movements seem a little unnatural 😅
Mythril actually is exist we call it Titan.
obviously. However they may exist at the core of a neutron star or a black hole
Is any effort in Astrophysics Nuclei modelling, instead of  proton/neutron (u, d quarks) some exotic quarks like Strange, Charm being used ? Is MIT bag model accomodate these ?
Is Nuclear Shell Model, specifically "Interacting Boson Model"  being used and maintained today ? How accurate in predicting Nuclei changes in MeV emission ?
Wait youre telling me mythril isnt real?
Eeee
They are probably so unstable that they fall apart faster than you can make them.  More interesting is how to combine basic organic molecules into better drugs.
Element 115.  You fake ass scientists said its wasnt real in the 90s.
Naquadah
If they do, so what?
Gevanium Atomic Number: Infinity Discoverer: Garten of Banban employees.
Never mentioned VIBRAINIUM
can someone explain what a reference class is please? 18:55
Don't forget Pergium!  (TOS Devil in the Dark)
A better question is why do you assume that nature first discovered every element?  That’s how the universe actually works.   From a philosophical standpoint, no human can invent anything that has not been:  1. Invented by nature already; or 2. Been invented already someway somehow in the multiverse.  Depending on which force of nature you’re using to explain the same math.  💚💚💚  This is a very dense interpretation of science. Always focused on the Ego.  It’s through studying consciousness that my culture connects to the forces of nature.
I've got a real problem with this video. The basic content is fine, but the notation shown is wrong, at least in my textbooks.  At 0:42 the 6 on Carbon should be in the lower left corner, not the top left. (and so on) The top left corner is reserved for "mass number" which would be the sum of protons and neutrons.  I expected better from PBS.
Gh
Yes there is 3 Periodic tables   When we discovered dark matter   The mirror periodic table and the third table   When we discover  Will be off world elements  That could be useful but can not be created on earth
Well if the heaviest elements are made in a super nova think what elements are in a bkack hole
What about Ice-Nine? Disappointing 😔
sugdenium eh? sugdeniumdeeznutz
He keeps mispronouncing technetium and its like fingernails on a blackboard. 😬
Sorry, but I'm required by law go to spit this.     Sugdenium deez nutz
I have that same shirt
What is the minimum time for a Jenga pile to count?
Yes. saved you 20m
how come there is no Vibranium being mentioned 🫣
What makes heavier elements more unstable. The strong nuclear force or the weak? Maybe. Why can't there be heavy stable elements
Yes
That is so stupid man they have something they can create only as a breif  vapor and put it on the periodic table  Come on, get real
Yes. In an ULTRA MASSIVE BLACK HOLE possibly PRIMORDIAL. They crush the atom into SUBATOMIC PARTICLES and so.. I’m sure if it gets to a point where mass is too much and the SUBATOMIC PARTICLES release energy much like fusion would except it’s from the extra room created. Empty space. If an atom is a basketball. A subatomic particle is a golf ball. Those negative spaces in between contain energy.?
I know I’m not going to use any of this information in my everyday life, but damn do I like to watch these Space Time videos!
It might be a nice sci-fi piece to imagine the whole material holding together only by nuclear forces.
Ok we have it guys, the next Half Life Game will be released in 5700 years
The super-heavy island of stability elements might be good, but the tech needed to produce them will probably be even more ground-breaking. It will be next-level of particle manipulation
Dark Forest Solution ..... oh boyyyy . Damn It , Ends .
There is no end to the universe, and if there were, then there would be another and another...the big bang was omnidirectional, and our space is infinite. As such, the Table of Elements is not yet complete, because it is also infinite, and there is also an Anti-Periodic Table... because anything is possible.
Answer: we dont know
I want veritasium
Good job losing the accent, I expected nothing less from a brilliant physicist and it makes listening easier, especially for someone who struggles with accents.
Is he doing sign language???
Watch his hands, guarantee you won’t be able to stop watching them
Bavarium and Vibranium
Can't we make Heliam with 1+1i protons
naturally impossible and artificial elements already exists so I dont think so.
I'm confused.. electron "spin" is actually a spin or a property?
And then there is that class of elements that have so many protons and neutrons they can only exist as black holes.
I suggest changing the table of elements to an X-Y grid of neutrons vs protons.
netherite is a mix
Element 119=Atticusium
Ancients heh? Any B5 fans out there?
Element 115 can be used in the anti gravity drive in ufos.
deeznutsnite
how does he think of this stuff good job
It will be interesting to see how to determine the atomic number and atomic weights. How did mendelev do it
Mendeleyev table not Periodic table.
You mentioned Netherite❤
Civilization: 7000 years  The Universe: 13.8B years  Can man say anything about the Universe w/ certainty?
I was 100% expecting one of the nuclear shell magic numbers to be 137.
Is technetium pronounced tech-neat-e-um, or tech-knee-she-um?  I've always heard the latter, but he said the former.
I just needed to hear that adamantium was on the periodic table
137 elements! Ergo 1 over 137? Nah.
I will finish on this one last thought as the "Philosophers Stone" has played on my mind for the past 30 years or more. Whilst for many this has been a "Holy Grail" of sort in its own special way. As what was technically deemed as impossible for centuries was actual not at all. Secret knowledge allowed us to understand how to create anything from the so called base element. What we weren't aware of was just how simple it was. When we had all the knowledge to allow us to convert it from one to another.   The other complication is whilst this is both sacred/hidden knowledge, like anything it comes with a warning. The world has not yet understood balance, and control. If I wanted to turn the "Moon" into gold what good would it do me? Remember there is chaos in order, and vice a versa. Just as we recognize that in food chain, and in the animal kingdom, we have links, and once we break that chain or a link goes missing we have to live with the repercussions that may well have on everything else.  Everything is inextricably connected, and it doesn't matter whether we knew it or not, the truth of the matter is that it is. Even down to the tiniest detail, everything relies on everything being in place, once that chain is broken, then everything becomes broken. Take the wisdom out of these words and you will see clearly what I mean.
If we can discover 11 dimensions then nothing is impossible in adding more elements to our very humble periodic table.   Take a moment to think about the Rubik's Cube, now imagine that every square is a different planet, and every face on every square makes a new element. Then calculate a combination of elements when combined and here is the kicker, in sequence, temperature, and at sub atomic level, with the fusion of light and sound and intensity that allows the creation of something that is closer to ethereal and divine that you then realize it was nothing short of the "Philosophers Stone" that you were chasing all this time.   The Universe they once said was numbers, the multiverse, is the equations that create the divine. It's that one step closer to what we've all been searching for which is for some the "Holy Grail" but in reality it is not that at all, it is the boundlessness of all that creation can come up with which is inexhaustible. That is the reality. Even each race of extra terrestrials have a number of elements missing, and that is the complexness and beauty of the Cosmos as we know it.
To really begin to understand the "Periodic Table" you have to accept that it is every planet in the solar system has there own version of this so called table. This will be difficult for humans to process, as we are restricted in our ability to think outside of the box so to speak.   In the last 6 to 7 decades we have been adding new elements which we refer to as "Exotic" because they are not found here on our planet but we have used the oldest system known to man and that is we have bartered for them. It is not important what the trade off was, it's the fact that we have, and more than on one occasion.   Lets be clear about trade off's as this is more so about having a "Supplier" in the same way as a drug dealer maybe referred to as a supplier. So we have the so called galactic version who can get their hands on anything. In the past 70 years it's been a bit of a sweet shop moment whereby what has been shown to us, is both mind blowing and above top secret, on levels one cannot even begin to understand.  So the paradox we now face is how do you introduce what clearly isn't known to us on planet earth. One route is claim it was just a passenger on a passing meteorite, and we've just managed to extract it! Like anyone is going to believe that one. This is where you have to be slightly more creative, and say well we dredged it from the bottom of the ocean, which allows it to be remotely plausible. Hmm. not sure with that one either.   Or we go for the unconvincing well we've just discovered it Antarctica and then nobody can contest it. The other problem is releasing this new element into mainstream and before you know it we cannot get enough of it for it to be commercialized. We've been there before, with simple things like graphene, and look where that got us.   The problem then becomes more associated with the "Black Market" or alternatively the Deep Dark Web, which is way far above the experience and prestige of the once famed "Harrods". Yes, everything does have it's price even for Trillionaires, and the lesser Billionaires who are working hard to make a living, by comparison.
This gentleman presents complex scientific properties and theories in ways that become comprehensible for the common man or woman. Very democratic really and enlightening. After seeing this one wonders how long it will be before some earth shattering new element will make its appearance and change the world. Hopefully for the better. Unlike say harnessing antimatter for it’s destructive potential.
Matt you 4got wise benevolent and currently over in that back corner solar system because its nap time complemented with "aren't they so cute when they sleep?" Kind of OLD ONES!
As Protons and Neutrons are made of sets of quarks.  Can other particles be made of other sets of quarks?  If these other nuclear particles replaced or added to Protons & Neutrons could we then have a new Periodic table?
I have 2 things to say. I have NOT had a chemistry class, and you said something about netherite earlier and I wish it existed
why dont we just fuse two of the heaviest elements and see what happens? XD
The most expensive substances ever to exist are the heaviest known elements. Millions of dollars were spent making just a few micrograms in a reactor, and they were so short lived that science struggled to verify their existence.
I used to think there was elements missing because of the way that’s the periodic table is shaped it’s not shaped like a square
Y
Why is Iridium common in space but not Earth? (ie KT Boundry).
2 questions: is life inevitable? And: the periodic table looks as it does because of our 2D representation. What would it look like if it were 3D? What does the 3rd axis represent? And could we then “pry in” new elements that way?
I wonder he our eyes would perceive a "new color"
Thank you for the amazing video! I hope that element 119 will be octarinum (named after Terry Pratchett's octarine in the Discworld) Have a good one!
its coming in the new update, don't worry more stuff will be added soon!
I believe there is a big conspiracy to keep the element felonium a huge secret.  No one would want to admit that the realms of physics/chemistry have a criminal element.
why is no one talking about the fact he put a minecraft netherite ingot at the beginning 😭
137 total possible elements and fine structure constant is 137.
Netherite is just a platinum gold alloy
What? E-e-e-e-element 0? Also fun fact:1 person tried to scam and make a fake element’ sussy fact?
Isn't orichalcum a real thing?
I don’t want human kind to discover new elements. Human kind will only create more death and destruction with it
POV helium: damm
Fun Fact: Element zero is Neutronium
I keep mowing on this crazy idea that What are the odds of me being here now. They are very small. Yet I am here now. Suggesting in some fashion i am always here.
👍🏾
And they said universe's made by coincidence.. 🙃
Same
The idea that a second evolution of life would be "eaten" by the prior one is dubious. There is no reason to expect the two disparate evolutions to be at all compatible, and may even be toxic enough to prevent many of the same systems that would make them interact, like parasitism or commensalism etc. If one had a different method of forming a genetic database, by using different amino acids or even different sugars, even just one substitution from our "normal" notion of DNA would make these differing lifeforms unable to interact biologically, no good as food, no good as potential gene swapping partner. Although, it would be interesting to ponder just how far disparate genetic systems might be able to hybridize, after all, our code for life is not that complicated , A-T and C-G is simply a binary code that gives rise to higher forms of complexity going up the structure types, but given this, imagine a form of DNA that utilizes say TEN pairs of complimentary base pairs ! The possibility then exists for the coding of proteins just as complex or more than ours but with the use of far fewer base pairs, a life form as complex as us but with a genetic instruction set only a tenth or less in size...it may be that any newly discovered genetic system on a far away planet that uses more than our simple binary system would have wildly diverse and capable biological abilities, and look upon us as extremely simple creatures...but then I could be wrong lol.
Orichalcum bead go boom
I have a question, if protons and neutrons like to be even, how does hydrogen exist?
3:15 you said Manganese not Molybdenum.
It's funny to theorize that somewhere, -in a galaxy, far far away- some time, at some point, something like Netherite would exist.
Too smart for a man with this tshirt)
The Video was not for me but the T-shirt got me to like it lol
What bothers me is how when a nucleus is unstable, instead of completely blowing apart it just emits some particles and is fine. How  does THAT work?
No, the scientific community as we knew it is gone or in  current terms dumbed down. In a woke society science is forgotten. Besides its ridiculous to but something on the periodic chart that us unstable, even though there are some on there. They need to revive the Standard Model as well as create a table for man made elements.
Elements above Z=118 are not known because they don't live long. They are not known because the cross section (probability) of reactions that can produce them are so low. For example nihonium had an experiment running for something like 8 years and only detected 3 particles. They issue is not detecting them once made but making them.
Maybe
Netherite is an alloy, not an element
I have a question. First of all my back ground. I grew up in a broken home and was left on my own at the age of 15 years old . Which led to getting my G.E.D.. Which the economy was bad and ended up in the army. with really not much education. Many jobs later and now retired I find my self intrigued and starving for knowledge.  I hope to learn more about at least beginning and understandings of basic physics. And so sorry about the long winded story of myself. I have a question. So because I haven't done much study yet. How do I read a colored periodic table color blind? I know it's probably a stupid question but one thing I learned from my grandfather was the only stupid question was the one that wasn't ask. And also your never to old to learn and expand your knowledge. Who ever answers this thank you for your time.
Reaching the island of stability of it does exist would be on par with all the other great achievements of the species. With those legitimate spaceflight and fusion become possible. It would be like discovering Vibranum from Black Panther.
He missed Runite
That Half-Life refference-  priceless!!!
Deeznutium
Sugden balls
Netherite-
Oracalchum (however you spell it) was always considered to be a compound, not an element.
The next element to be found should be called bogoiam
Tutel
Me: I want to change... Scientist: Don't worry I can do that! Also scientist: **adds a proton to me**
43 is a prime🗿
Elements beyond our gravity limits haven't been discovered yet? Perhaps uranium doesn't decay in 12500 gravity?
Netherite is an alloy if gold and something else. The other thing is the new element you are taking about: ancient debris
Vibranium: Am I a joke to you?
And i like ducks 🦆
Silicon âge:)
Don't forget upsidasim  BULWINKILE AND ROCKY
It is exactly 20:00 in the netherlands *Terraria Celeste Slimerancher Man*
We are missing about 1000 elements. Many are "man-made". Although I am not allowed to name any of them because like you I am also sanctioned.
Ununennium
My aunt say if 119element made it can make to 126th and 127th made until 132nd could made
0.:07, netherite from minecraft 1.16
7:12, wrong, those forces are the same, there's just more of it coming from external sources than the amount produce by the so called weak force's source
So could there potentially be an almost infinite amount of elements that are so unstable that they last almost no time at all, or is this just simply impossible to create such huge elements?  I don't know much chemistry, so sorry if my question sounds dumb!
thanks!. this really challanged my current thoughts on the universe. made me have some good ol existential crisis!
Netherite is technically an alloy 🤓🤓
My goodness. To think of what life would have been like if I had been shown and taught this when I was 8.
Does gravity have an effect on the stability of the nucleus? Could atoms that are unstable or stable change if they are moving close to the speed of light?
why say half life when you could say full life?
Unobtainium is my favorite.
I got a neato shower curtain about five months ago @ the Mapunapuna Goodwill Outlet Store.  It has Periodic Table of Elements printed on it.
Of course.
Sugdenium nuts
You can't use matter to transfer energy.  Although it may surround it (matter) it does not use it as a conductive force.  Einstein was wrong. Matter is objective.  And yet the observed is the fractional equivalent to energy only measured by human time scale to our or the (all's) or others presence which cannot ever be in relation to reality as known or used, borrowed, or betrayed. (opinion)
Only a complete fool could believe that all in our complex universe including the building blocks.... atoms... come from absolutely nothing...all by nothing.. .sit down and think how dumb that actually is
And then Carlo discovered bottled water
Best comment ever 👇
Yes, it's called SCP-2046
Godnium gives you the power of a god...
Theoretically there are undiscovered elements but they’d be so unstable it’s not even remotely practical
U n b i s e p t i u m
Probably not.   Most 'magic material' on spaceships will be processing.   Sort of like how if you take a piece of aluminum foil back 3000 years.  magic.
Netherite is an alloy
Free energy surrounds us
Netherite!?!?
What element is a ghost? or a paranormal entity?
I’m waiting for 119
00:05 Mithril. Silver steel. Tolkien Legendrium.
arent there enoughf exeptions already that we have to find another island of stablity
Adamantium is an alloy
I have 10kg Vibranium in my backyard.
ah yes netherite
hmmm well you have to discover the unknown first.
I strongly recommend watching "The man sho tried to fake an element" by BobbyBroccoli channel here on the tube.
Are there Undiscovered Elements Beyond The Periodic Table? short answer yes we just have not found them yet cause dark matter for example and anti matter
Does 115 have a name? Or do we all call it element 115?
Imagine aliens show up and drop a package onto the surface we open it up and it’s some kind of antimatter device and someone touches it and blows up the entire earth
So, is there a Steel age?
Adamantium isn't a fictional element, it's a fictional alloy. Similarly neither is kryptonite since there's a fictional chemical formula for it
You mixed netherite with Iron ingot
He missed Vibranium
Unobtainium in the Avatar universe annoys me because it's a commonly used technical term for speculative design. It is simply a material with properties that do not fit any known material. The designer can set what properties are necessary, and then material scientists can work to create or discover a material that fits that description. Once you actually make it you give it a real name, and it is no longer unobtainium. As they have discovered the real thing in that universe they would then name it, and no longer call it unobtainium.
Yes, Bob Lazar proved this...
This whole episode gets it wrong !! NONE of the elements ont he Periodic Table are Artificial !!  Humans discovered them at a state that we have a basic understanding of them. They already existed in some form in nature regardless of whether humanity knew about them or not. This isn't Astro Turf (artificial grass) > this isn't a glass eyeball (artificail eye) > This is not "artificial" like vegetarian meat or the Islands in Dubai.  It's amazing how technical this series is but still falls flat on it's face. We did not invent anything on the Periodic Table > We discovered a previously unknown Element at points in human history.
What is the upper physical limit of size of atoms?  On the extreme, if you could have an atom the size of a baseball, it would effective be a material similar to neutronium, at least in weight.
There were before 115 was confirmed, so it's essentially a guarantee that there are more.
Bro I, a bunch of atoms, love watching multicoloured atoms of another bunch of atoms explaining how atoms could find more types of atoms so we can build more complex stuff which is also made of atoms.
Meanwhile the neutron star says what's a periodic table and makes it all strange.  🤔
Just wait until we know what dark matter is and we can study that,  it might add tons of elements
Yes
Watch a Wonderful YouTube channel "BobbyBroccoli" describe the search for a new element...............some of the best content on the internet .........amazing !
Umm his name was Mendele’ev not Mendelev, Mendelev is not a name it would be Mendelyov. But it isnt - its Mendeleyev.
kryptonite was discovered in Serbia in 2007. Itş composition is like described in the movie Superman Returns. No special powers....
HEY!  You left out...arenak, dagal, inoson.  Those go a long way back...
Arguing about aliens again? Life if precarious on Earth, let alone the freezing radioactive void of space, or barren of life in the rest of the solar system (so far). The great majority of species of organisms that has been around since the Cambian has gone extinct.  Furthermore, there are hostile places on Earth that is near devoid of life now; Antarctica (inland), top of high mountain peaks, bottom of deep ocean trenches (and that's just the surface of the Earth).
Isn't the current "Silicon Age" a more finessed expression of the "Stone Age"? Next material age; hydrogen age (for fusion reactors).
Kryptonite isn't an element... it is a compound.
Annoying universe, it could’ve just been fire, water, earth, and air but nooOOOooo
0:10 you forgot about "*VIBRENIUM*" from Marvel     (Sorry if spelling is not correct 🙇‍♀️)
Neutron Stars
*Great Filter #19:* The discovery of "apocalyptium", also called "the prionic element." An atom that transforms surrounding atoms into itself in a matter of miliseconds, destroying entire civilizations in a planet at the very act of its discovery. The only advanced civilizations that survive this filter are: *1)* Those which by mere chance get to understand the mechanics of the atomic nucleus before they start to syntethize the chemical elements in the so-called "Island of Stability"—in which apocalytium is located—therefore grasping beforehand the consequences which its fabrication would entail, and *2)* those who succesfully settle in other planets beyond their homeworld and the destruction by apocalyptium catastrophe doesn't physically reach them but they could get informed of its unique properties.
Regarding the question of the Dark Forest, of course we shouldn’t hide. We should do as our ancestors did, teach the shadows lurking beneath the trees to fear *us*.  Well, that and the fact that if anyone is listening and hostile, then hiding ourselves is a ship that sailed a looooong time ago
My theory is that as we get closer to the center of the Galaxy, planets have much more elements than our periodic table, including elements that can bend the gravitational field. It’s what allows civilizations on these planets to construct spacecraft that can travel as fast as the UAPs that we’ve been observing here on earth
my reference class reasoning was this: i live in a civilization that aborts babies, so i can at least be sure i wasn't a part of that movement that led to the decision of that, beyond my control.
Technically, it is possible to have a really heavy element beyond the current periodic table. The problem is they tend to be extremely unstable.  Our current methods of getting them as well, are... bombarding them with nuclear reactions. Which end up creating lesser variants until they get a relatively stable element that doesn't immediately decay. Element 114, for example has a half life of 1.9 seconds, and there's an unconfirmed isotope of it, 290 with a half life of 19 seconds. The element is theorized to be a super conductor. Which if possible to have something with a half-life of more than 10s, we could create a fast propulsion system out of it.  The major problem is the instability, and radioactivity of 92+
When I was in high school the periodic table went to 103, although several isotopes of 104  were synthesized in '69, '70 and '74 with 105 was '68 and '70. We've apparently been stuck at 118 for 20 years now.
Regarding medical imaging: Tc is used in nuclear/scint/gamma cameras/SPECT. This video shows CT images (made from X-ray), which is a completely different technology.  The two groups of images look completely different. The X-ray CT images show anatomy at high resolution. The Tc images show function, such as metabolism, activity, spread of fluids etc.
"Adamantium, bolognium, dilithium, element zero, kryptonite, mithril, netherite, oricalcum, unobtanium. We love fictional elements." Naquadah - "Am I a joke to you?"
One thing that hasn't been discussed is the immutabilty of lead. It remains a toxic chemical to all current life, if there were life that could use lead and process it bio-chemically, there would be an elemental residue left in nature that could be built on in evolution; nothing works wonders like nature, but nature has to build on it's own successes and we may have to wait until nature can digest lead: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) can remove metals from the body but is risky by itself when used in Chelation therapy and is a synthetic chemical not produced in nature.
There are 137 elements.
The heaviest on the table is the singularity black hole hahaha
is it possible, elements would be more  stable in space??maybe gravity strength is breaking things up..
16:05  "now today we have a special shut up" bruuuuhhhh 😂😂😂
whenever some1 titles something with a question, 99% of the time the answere to this question is yes. so why still every works like that? arent u spoilering ur whole video? :p
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_forest_hypothesis
We might not be an "early civilisation" anyway - if someone else is out there, there's a possibility they're in the same or similar technological era to ourselves and are just so far away we haven't met yet so it just feels early.
Netherite is alloy of gold and ancient debris, when debris themselves should not be another element
New ore discovered in Congo which produces electricity?
Element 115
Im high
The element of surprise 😉
When I was in high school there were only 103 elements in the periodic table.
Obamium
terraria reference in 6 seconds I'm in
If i remember well it took 2 generations of stars to create the earth since the first stars only contained hidrogen.
Anything is possible.  Humanity's perspective on "everything and all that exists" is so small and so stunted that there's no way we even know of half the things that are.   As far as you, the human, is concerned, you might be a turkey on a farm or a lower dimensional being living on a higher dimensional sharpshooter's practice target.
05:07 loved it
Shout out to Bob Lazar
As a kid I already thought why not.. just because we cant find others on earth doesnt instantly also mean there are no new on other Planet
Netherite is an alloy, not an element
The key quote “ any body who has studied chemistry this may seem far fetched “.
Alternate title: _On Beyond Zirconium!_
yes u can always add more proton but this causes the atom to become unstable to the point where it will break apart in a fraction of a second and hence why these materials don't commonly exist in the universe
Mendeleev's surname is pronounced like Mendeleyev, not Mendelev
no, we know everything.  on this spec of dust in an infinite ocean we know all there is to know about everything, duh
267th element sugdenium 16:16
It could be that the (this) universe isn't old enough to have enough heavy particles in one place to generate a stabile super element.  But it's possible that we might artificially synthesize such elements.
Couldn’t there hypothetically be infinite elements?
I think their are matierals we never discovered is very fact
I mean we recently discovered a new material on the moon and I'm very excited
What if we could somehow stabilize those unstable elements ? If we did, wouldn't we be able to keep adding protons and keep making new elements that could be studied and potentially use ?
Bolognium? It came from Bologna?
Thanks for making this Idiot friendly and as a pretty friendly idiot it is nice to learn a little more about the world of the possible and it is nice to dream that some day we'll discover a dielithium or Carverite and the world will change hopefully for the better.
Such an unfocused video...
OFC there are more elements then we have discovered also there is dark matter.
Kryptonite actually was used as a name for some mineral compound that was discovered after Superman, solely because the guy who did was a huge nerd. So Kryptonite has actually been retconed into reality.
i have that shirt lmao
One of the steps to terraforming Venus is the removal of carbon from the atmosphere.  Could we create the nitrogen we need in the atmosphere by adding neutrons to the removed carbon enabling the carbon to decay into nitrogen?  And if so where do we get the neutrons from?
Nice shirt
Asking if there are undiscovered elements is like asking if there are undiscovered species at the bottom of the ocean. Of course there are. We're just unable to take a deep dive for discovering.
could future elements exist far in the future after the universe has expanded substantially more?
5:01 Half Life game reference. Also the first game cover also mentioned C¹⁴ symbol.
Undiscovered element    1. *THE ELEMENT OF SUPRISE* (im 20 idfk what im doing typing this)
Balilinium
Well seeing how large the universe is there are probably metals/precious metals that we have yet to discover and probably never will
Well done.
Maybe its better not to discover them lets say one will be perfect for nuclear bombs yeah it will be awfull
VIBRAINUIM 🤷‍♀️
I 100% believe this as there is a rock that has been discovered in the republic in congo that produces it own electricity. Now tell me what element is that?
Yea there are numerous elements to be discovered, I got a whole bunch of predictions in state of Plasma. Science students going to hate me. Might add about 2 rows. The secret of officially discovering a new element is to stabilize it. Hint hint for all you struggling scientists wanting some recognition by your peers.  There are ways to cheat, skip the unstable ones and go for the ones you can stabilize. Requires some fusion, fission of neutrons, electrons and protons. Only hurdle is getting past the Academy of Sciences and if they deem your work is a new isotope instead of element lol.
I'm still disappointed that Lenny never got an element named after him
PBS is not a reliable source of Accurate Information. It's Produced by State Actors.
Thought from the video I got - That today's civilization is just the beginning of Science there's a lot to come which keeps me motivated to be the part of the Science Community.
sugmadignium?
What if there were more elements, but they’re just in a different dimension/ universe than ours. Also what if our current elements work differently in other dimensions?
What about vibranium?
But are not most new elements just made up nowadays?
When I watch a movie that includes some new element, I immediately think: That can't be because there are no gaps and bigger elements are not stable. So, I just imagine that the "element" is really a molecule of existing elements. Transparent aluminum does exist -- but it's aluminum oxide and it's called sapphire.   Its' nice to now learn that there is a stability island out there that might include the "currently' sci-fi elements. Thanks for giving my imagination another place to vacation.
No.
Wanders if anyone else clocked the iron ingot, instead of the mentioned netherite ingot in the intro
These fusions of elements that create "new" elements that have existences of nano seconds is exactly why we should stop wasting trillions of dollars trying to create "new" elements.  They blow apart so quickly because they aren't designed to exist in the first place.  The fact they are even listed on the chart is hubris at its finest.
Isn’t kryptonite the solid form of krypton gas?
One use for elements in the island is that they'd logically make extraordinarily good shielding due to their extreme density, which would be fantastic for nuclear science, fission and fusion power generation, and space travel.
Vibranium?
Just for 'scientific' purposes.. Adamantium is an alloy of Vibranium + Steel   ;)
I have a feeling the next breakthrough as far as new elements are concerned is going to have less to do with an island of stability among heavier elements and more to do with insight into the working of quarks and the creation of new subatomic particles. Who knows what strange elements we may find some day.
"Technetos-on" just means "artificial" in Greek.
Hey, sci-fi writers, instead of making up a fictional element just use Technetium for now.
you forgot obamium
Element zero aka neutronium exists under the conditions of high gravity
“Netherite” broke me I have come back after 10 months to see if this comment got any likes, (it got no likes)
NETHERİTE WTH LMFAO
Hard to discover, basically
10:26 why cadmium is Ca it should be Cd
Seems like this is as close as we'll get to Halt-Life guys, thanks Valve.
My favorite fictional elements are the blue and orange gels from portal
Um, actually Adamantium is not an element but a vibranium alloy.
Tc, element 43: Pronunciation	/tɛkˈniːʃ(i)əm/ ​(tek-NEE-sh(ee-)əm)
Lithium is an instable non metal element but you can make it stable adding alumium
I'm really not sure this adds anything to anything....
Bekause we have already done, must exist
Will Smith discovered Nigelium
bloontonium
Just waiting for stable isotope of 115
we need to discover lapis lazuli
Energy levels ? Same as a power level ?!? I wonder 8:40 (" Vageta what dose the scouter say about his power level ? It's over 9000!!!!!")
I want to know about where and what island Mr, Spock found Red Matter! Now that is one nasty ass element! Makes black holes! Oh! I see! You’ve got intercontinental nuclear weapons? Well we have intercontinental black holes, so bring it on!!😂😂
If there is an Island of Stability, these elements would be extremely heavy. Maybe very useful in nuclear fission? Would be cool to see several  layers of fission with the same fuel. Even cooler if it decayed into something very stable and safe.
I've just created pootonium. Doesn't seem very stable.
Iamnotsureium
I think the magic nucleus shell number are 4 8 15 16 23 42  Right?
Excellent!
Amazing how he spoke all the fictional elements' names in alphabetical order.
If there are undiscovered elements then you don’t know about them Obviously because they’re undiscovered So someone with a logical brain would just skip past this video because obviously you don’t know about undiscovered things which is why they’re called undiscovered  am I repeat myself?
Все неоткрытые элементы - это сверхтяжелые металлы находящиеся в ядрах, компенсрующие прогрессию слияния отрицательных атомов. Возле самих атомов есть небольшой слой переходящих из безструктурного в пограничное состояния предельных элементов. Пограничное состояние предельных элементов можно получить в лабораторных условиях на короткий промежуток времени с фатальными для планеты последствиями. На сегодняшний день создание сверхтяжелых металлов возможно; предельных маловероятно ввиду отсутствия возможности контроля за процессом перехода и невозможности удержания прогрессии от слияния отрицательных атомов. Процесс формирования предельных элементов возможен будет как только появится возможность изучить и менять на устойчивое поверхностное натяжение частиц ядра.
Name element 562 after me!
What’s the point of these ultra high mass elements? so unstable won’t last long enough to do anything with
I believe that there is a possibility that we are just an ant hill and we are being observed from a distance, do ants know if we are looking at them?
I read a theory that one of the reason Area 51 is so secret is that they found a way to synthesize Element 125 or Element 135 (one of those, not sure which exactly) in a way that doesn't decay (at least not too quickly) and they use it for cutting edge applications. I doubt it's plausible but it's certainly an interesting thought.
I would answer the question "why pursue the island of stability" with the same answer one once answered about Mount Everest: "Because it might be there".
Great video
Im a secret element LE for lame 🤪
If there was a natural way of producing stable nucleus, say atomic number 126, and atomic weight 310, like merging black holes or neutron stars, then we should have detected it by now, even in trace amounts. We should first increase our knowledge about large nuclei, before searching for them.
I found this fascinating.
Anyone gonna point out the Half-Life reference??
"Is it possible things exist beyond the scope of my understanding?" Answer YES
10:10 its Tek-nee-shee-um my dude
Why would say, if Not here, it is no where?
I feel like one of the most important means to advance technology nowadays is to find ways to explain complex things in a simple to understand way, so that more people gain an interest in scientific topics. And you're doing an amazing job with it!
Worry not for future advanced artificial intelligence will help greatly in figuring this out for us, that is if we are still here.
Is there a possibility that super heavy elements constitute dark matter?
Too few scientists.  Too much other "expertise" that helps nothing related to human advancements.
Element 0, also known as neutronium is a hypothetical element.
The first thing anyone is going to do with a relatively stable element with an atomic weight of 310 is make projectile weapons. Something that dense is going to make depleted uranium seem like aluminium by comparison.
Set playback speed to 1.25
Awesome to see how much is still possible, the technology revolution was amazing, but it seems to have come to a crawl in recent years, i wonder if there will be another century of unprecedented growth in tech and even more interesting, who the innovators will be since things are pretty equal in this field.
I wonder if we find a way to reliably use/implement a 4th spatial dimension, if those unstable isotopes (Because of the size) would be stabilized for being more compactable. Idealistic thinking, but considerable nonetheless.
6:10 You forgot the superactinides family (g subshell electrons) and the 3rd f subshell family on the periodic table. Therefore, the next noble gas with be actually umpentnilium (number 150 = 118 +  2 + 6 + 10 + 14)
The Structured Atom Model shows that the arrangements of particles in the nucleus predict the qualities of the elements. It's crazy to think that only now scientists are even considering the arrangements of particles inside the nucleus
balonium 🙂
So, in theory we should see those elements being produced in neutron star collisions. That probably means their half lifes isn't terribly long. So the next question here is if its possible to simulate and then detect them by either their thermal glow, or their gamma decay...
Didn’t they just Discover 2 new elements on an asteroid?
Nobody knows since they are undiscovered!!🙄
People sleep so hard on alloys and how much we could acive with them.
Elements r like prime numbers. There is no limit to it
Since there is no absolute time in the universe, it is not correct to say that a civilization must be the first.
Undiscovered elements, may be not. Unexisted yet elements, may be. If the earth temperature keep rising, new elements will be formed. However there may not be living things!
Bear with me, as I'm sure this has been discussed before, but if computer models are necessarily constructed using only known, expected, or otherwise conceptualized parameters, how are they actually useful?  I get that they might make connections that their creators hadn't--we saw that sort of thing with simple-ish AI in video games decades ago--but I don't see how the practice could be particularly generative beyond that.  I'm sure it is, I just don't know how.
"Element 43" is a great name for a sci-fi story.
Don't pontificate too hard about the anthropic principle.  Some of it is chance and by definition unsolvable.  As an example,  you buy 8 lotto tickets but you can't see the numbers.  If one wins the prize, it's reasonable to assume 1 in 8 tickets win.  We all know this is false,  but if you never encounter another lotto, nor get access to the selection process,  how are you going to know? 1 in 8 will remain the assumption... and that's ok. Stop worrying and get some sleep :)
Bob Lazar was telling the world about Element 115 years before it was discovered to really exist.
Unobtainium is real, it is what those beautiful girls I could never get a date with are made from
Lol. Some people are just dumb. "Existing in nature" does not equate to "existing naturally on earth".
Netherite ;)
According to ancient Egyptian preists, yes there are more elements.
The shirt is a nice touch, I have the same one!
Dumbist topic I have ever heard of, the Table has grown bigger since I was a kid in the 50's and 60's.
So called dark matter , dark energy is the medium by which the current periodic table of elements exist and move about in this material realm .    Dark matter is the light , essence that makes material matter.
Glenn T Seaborg lived in an interesting time discovering the transuranic elements above 92 and there is an element Sg named after him.
NETHERITE
3:10 its name means "artificium". the word τεχνιτός/τεχνιτή/τεχνιτό means artificial(greek language has 3 genders and ALL adjectives have them.) they just took this word and added the latin -ium in the end.
Netherite is an alloy of gold and, like, titanium.
Under "normal" conditions, an atom is mostly empty space. So... what happens to atoms in a black hole? Do they get compacted so tightly that protons are forced into forming super-heavy elements?
So the reason we don’t know the largest theoretical element is because it’s too hard for anyone to have figured it out yet, k.
This dude looks like he be hittin the periodic meth table
I discovered a new color....
Yes
Hello everybody.  I got a quick question about the periodic table at the top why is there so much of a gap. It makes like a u shape. New to the channel.
If fused in the bowels of a black hole, could that hold elements stable and is there an end?
... 119 Elements in Periodensystem - Genesis 1.19 day number 4 with - day and night - GOD as tetralog 4 Letters JHWH - 10868 like silber element 47 - 107868 - GOD the Old 68 - and the divine fate days 11.9 or 9.11 as porsche car POSSIBLE with Janis Joplin born 19.1.
Who ever said the periodic table was complete?
the aliens stole all the other elements..lol
I know you aren't a chemist but it is pronounced tekneesheeum not teknettyum
its possible that our preception of force is wrong we being high mass entities feel force differently  for a proton electromagnetic force can be negligible in comparision of strong nuclear force  as the distance between atoms is very small for us but at point of atom this distance is enough to make nuclear force stronger than electromagnetic force making atom stable these are my viewpoints may be i am lacking more knowledge about atomic physics.. correct me if i am.
Yes certainly
Unobtainium?
Orichalcum isn't fictional OR an element. It's a copper alloy from the ancient world who's exact make up has been lost. Probably a mix of Copper and Zinc, it would have been a type of reddish brass.
i've been wondering how would unstable isotopes behave at the speed of light if for example we were able to move with a piece of them at the same speed, since i've noticed that we mesure the instability in terms of time surely their decadence would be slower (i'am guessing) so theoretically we would have been able to study super heavy elements and even observe them at these set conditions. And so i've also came to a conclusion that all elements are unstable even those who decay at the ratio of millions of years, the fact is that it is only us who perceive time in a different way
I believe this is true however it might be quite hard to find them And also… would it be possible to create them
Knowledge has no limit. The beauty of science and math is that there is always uncharted territory
H. Beam Piper's story "Omnilingual" deals with a long dead martian culture, and the characters in the story were stymied by being unable to translate the language.   BUT at the end of the story they discover a Martian university and find the table of elements written on a wall, which gives them a means of translating the language: As in Hydrogen is composed of a single proton and electron everywhere in the universe.  I'm in the process of writing out a story which carries this on further.
They do exist but the stability is what we need to talk about. The heavier an element gets, the less stable it becomes. You can make whatever element you want, but keeping it that way is the real trick.
Our periodic chart is based on the properties of "our understood science." Which fails to consider galaxies one million light years away where properties and chemicals exist that have no connection to our periodic chart, our properties or our understood science. A possibility which we have no more ability to comprehend than the concept of a universe that ends because we immediately get bogged down in the human logic that "if the universe ends then what lies beyond that boundary?" We just haven't arrived yet where we accept the "absence of nothing."
Can you help me identify a rugby sized rock that was part of the landscape of my parents property? It has a black reddish color . I put a magnet to it and it stuck, so I dug it up and it's heavy like 40 lbs  I'm a ironworker so I cut a piece off and it's metal but it was very dense and hard to cut like stainless steel is. I polished the small piece to a mirror finish. I have worked in different steel Mills over a 26 year career, and I'm confident that it's not slag. However I am not qualified or equipped, to properly identify it. Please help
Element 114 already discovered just never told.
No, there are elements than can be created but do not exist naturally.  Also they are highly radioactive.
So, there could be a stable form of element 115.
Before watching this, my opinion is that there has to be elements in the universe that's not present on this planet. It's incredibly premature and ignorant to dismiss the probability of elements never conceived by man. How can we know? It's impossible to know.
I don't understand why every time sci-fi or fantasy come up with fantastic elements they're always elements. Materials are almost never elemental, they're molecules and alloys. Why wouldn't a super-element just be an alloy we haven't invented yet?
0:07 “Unobtainium” was leaked by cheaters and soon it will be released, the cheaters said it will be element 420, coming out in update version 6.9
You left out Divinium, the fictional element from Warrior Nun, and Jasmium from Dune (original books)
All DNA on Earth did not come from a common ancestor, but from a common Designer.
There are plenty, it's just finding them.
Tony Stark discovered and created a new element by himself in his basement over a weekend! surely the science community can get this done?
Seriously has Hollywood ever invented something dumber than Unobtanium
..... but netherite is a mélange of gold and ancien débris... you are STUPIDE !!  NETHERITE IS A COMPOSITE MÉTAL !! Sorry but I am a minecraft player and can support this erreur,
Love your vids🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
“Intelligent” civilizations are _EXTREMELY_ rare. Spread apart by both distance and by billions of years. Chances are, we’ll never meet anybody. Besides, we might destroy ourselves in the next few years or sooner.
This channel has many very interesting videos and ideas, unfortunately I don't like the face and voice of the guy narrating hence I don't subscribe and don't watch at all.
6:10 - elements of the f- and g-block (6f and 5g) are not shown, and the place of Element 136 is not below Oganesson.
Carlos’ roll call
Varm...alame,
Sorry to correct you, but the atomic number is based on the amount of electrons - not protons, the number of protons change from element to element, but when the atomic number goes up, the amount of electrons change with it (for example, if a electron found it's way into a hydrogen atom, it would become a helium atom, with no neutrons and 1 proton)
Thank you for making this!
0:09 missed chance to say “obamium”
Its been confirmed that netherite is actually a platinum-gold alloy
NXT carbon age?
I NEED YOUR SHIRT MAT
I wouldn't be surprised if some comic nerd scientists eventually name newly created elements things like kryptonite or adamantium.
Of course!  Our knowledge is limited by the elements the Sun gave us, the pressure constraints of the Solar System, human imagination, and current technology.
As much as the science had advanced and we still have no idea if super heavy stable elements are posssible or not, that is both humbling and terryfing.
Sadly, whatever elements we find in the island of stability, they won't be very useful. They are all gonna be radioactive, super heavy metals (except maybe for a few noble gases). Radioactive elements are generally not that useful, except as radiation sources, and they'd have pretty weak material properties, because of their huge atomic size.
You missed upsidaisyum and vibranium in you opening, great video.
There I am Gary
Why is it important to discover elements that have a half life less than a second? There is absolutely no practical use for it.
So the answer is maybe ?
Why don't elements from the Island Of Stability exist in nature?
Wait wait wait wait, since when is mithril an element? I thought it was a compound or an alloy.
I've got to be that guy ...  Technetium is pronounced "Tech-nee-shium".  It was getting painfull hearing it that many times. Joys of learning the element song as a kid    :)
Imagine we take hydrogen, a highly flammable element and combine it with oxygen - catalyst for combustion. What do we get? - water, a complete opposite. Its amazing how various combinations of elements can create molecules having wildly different characteristics. Almost like magic.
Maybe I'm a pessimist, I don't think we'll find anything else useful, but it's worth looking just to know what we can force to exist
Two hard real-life claps for the illustration of half-life
I am appalled that Elerium was not mentioned! Its potential is is huge, so no reputable source would leave it out. Granted, element 115 may have technically already been synthesized, but its chemical and physical properties are still completely unknown, so it might as well be considered undiscovered. 😉
It's easy to create never seen before elements.  Just throw a bunch of heavy elements into a box and have an Americium sit on it.
Surprisium, a name available among the the elements of surprise.
wouldn't kryptonite be a mineral containing Krypton? Krypton is already an element, and it was discovered over half a century before the super man comics were published... adding "ite" is a naming scheme for rocks/minerals, not elements. So even the original person who made "Kryptonite" probably meant it to be a mineral based off the element, not an element itself.
combine every element together = undiscovered element
8:02 i've never heard anyone explained it at all, and you did that so good. I only found myself hearing about such things separately, in different context. If i was reading it in the book it, i could'nt fathom it. Thank you, that was interesting
Das Periodensystem der Elemente ist wie die Briefmarkensammlung der DDR: es kommt nicht neues hinzu.
10:40
Try 1 Proton for 137 Neutrons
Cool shirt
I like the idea of us humans being cosmic horrors.
If you think that there aren't other elements that exist your fooling yourself. Let me remind you The same list you feel "confident" in has changed over time. Meaning humans have learned adapted and discovered new properties.
so yes or no?
I watched this video expecting new thoughts on potentiall undiscovered atomic elements, got distracted, and when I regained focus the video went on about humanity becoming lovcraftian old ones.
Comic book nerd here, adamantium is an alloy whose exact composition and manufacturing process is a tightly-guarded secret. It's not something that exists in nature, it is a man-made material and very, very expensive to produce. One ingredient is known to be plain steel, another is believed to be vibranium, but trying to figure it out is a good way to get SHIELD agents knocking at your door.
I had a nightmare once that we synthesized element 125 and it instantly destroyed the universe
element zero would just be a neutron
Element-115 also known as Elerium. That's my favorite one.
What is most satisfying in this video is that it has millons of view. It makes me think that millions of people are interested in science. So it gives the hope that the humanity is not yet doomed to extinction. Make science, not war.
did Stone Age people consider themselves living in the Stone Age?  I wonder how future civilizations will refer to our age.  I would argue that the likelihood of being referred to as the Silicon Age is pretty low.
Groot?
There is no island of stability, it has been disproven some years ago. All elements after Bismuth will be unstable.
They don't know the secret one
There could be an infinite nuber of elements. We've found 118 in the last century, so it is likely that there are many more.
you can add more elements however the half lives go shorter and shorter.
None of this is going to help us develop lifelike sex bots dude. Sort yourself out.
tl;dr for answering the video title: are there undiscovered elements beyond the periodic table? we don't know, maybe
Step 1: Unify Physics; Step 2: Control local flow of time; Step 3: Create elements >119; Step 4: Their half-lifes are stil miliseconds, but now you control local flow of time, so they can last years for you. Create devices using this elements; Step 5: Build a galactic civilization; Step 6: Get to earth and draw random things on Mr. Johnson's corn plantation.
there are prob thousands of elements in the universe but only few hundreds in our solar system or galaxy.
Theres an infinite number of elements, the question is are they stable..
19:06 🖖🖖🖖
Love the video but the constant swooping in /out/ sideways to put in graphics is very disorientating and detracts from the message
E8
Fun Fact: I may be outside my element here but I finally found the missing element. Its called The Element of suprise. The reason you can't find it on the periodic table is because it can only be found by surprise. I also learned that grades 1 thru 8 is considered an element. That's why its called Element-tary school 🤣
Stalinium is real though
8:56 the only exceptions to this rule are Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, and Radon(Xenon especially, it’s more electronegative than sulfur.)
3:53 there is actually some technetium in a uranium mine in Africa but it is produced by radioactive decay, similar to how they first discovered it.
Better us than them, I’m okay with that.  It’s always a pleasure to listen to you 😊
PBSium is the newest element ✨
I'm Kind of confused how he didn't mention "Vibranium" that's the strongest metal in Marvel, stronger than "animantium"
I can’t help but think that some planets where nuclear and hydrogen bombs go off all the time, cobalt bombs, they have to create new things. We just don’t see them enough here. Or if there’s some dark matter bombs that go off, for sure they create something new. Or if you can stand on the event horizon, you’d figure you see a thing or two
You forgot to mention Vibranium 😁
What about exotic matter that is not comprised of proton/neutron core with electron shell? Such theoretical matter would have incredible unpredictable properties.
yes
Given the size of the universe it would be logical that nearly all possible combinations of elementary particles will be expressed. Even by Murphy's law that given enough time all particles will have existed or will exist.
12:23
9:22 Helium-4 Oxygen-16 Calcium-40 Nickel-56 Tin-100 Lead-164 Flerovium-240
this is an amazing story of those new elements that you have to watch if you enjoyed this video   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe5WT22-AO8
Moscovium is the best
After the Iron Age, you forgot the Age of Reason.
A Hydrogen Sphere can be evenly sectioned into 368 even parts. A continuous line starting at the North Pole and crossing the South Pole and ‘wrapped around the sphere’ 368 times. The last wrap of this line and the end will connect with and begin to repeat itself. (For visual thinkers) There are 369 spaces between those lines and each space. Because it’s a single line crossing at the poles, each space has slightly more pressure than the previous. Each space represents one element starting at Neutrinos1, hydrogen2, helium3… these are Information Elements or Ghost Elements—-> they have zero mass but have all the information about each element.  There’s four different versions of every element, for instance… everything on our periodic table, measured by Mass is Matter. Matter as a whole fits in the Positive Polarity section and  can be described as M+. There’s also a M- —-> this means that it’s the Polar Opposite of Matter. It’s the same list of elements except that they behave differently and have opposite values. This maintains balance in the universe. We also know that Light is an element although it is not discussed or taught as widely as it needs to be. Like Matter, Light also has a polar opposite——> L+ and L- and again they share opposite values. Again both versions of Light and Matter all share the same original elements.  There’s four versions of every element. H1 is the Hydrogen that we understand as Matter. H2 is the Light Version of Hydrogen. H1- is the Dark Matter version of Hydrogen. H2- is the Dark Light version of Hydrogen. Dark means the absence of light.  So the importance of 369 is the total number of elements times 4 versions is 1476 elements. Each element has its first stable isotopes and those isotopes contain all the information for that element. The isotopes are Light. The 116th isotope of element 115 is the stable isotope. The second isotope of Hydrogen is the stable one. The third isotope of Helium is the stable one. Just add one to the current Atomic Number of any element to find the correct isotope to isolate.  Thoughts on this?  Does anyone else see things this way when making scientific decisions? It’s hard to explain with just words. 🤔
It's possible to show there are possible configurations: molecules. Sulfur for example forms S8 naturally, which is 8 particles of Sulfur bonded together. Therefore, 16 protons multiplied by 8 does exist in nature as a particle, though not yet a single one! This will be element 144, "sulfuratum" or similar-sounding name! Just a matter of time... Nice video!
An element is just a combination of molecules. So it stands to reason new elements undiscovered exist as there has got to be countless different combinations.  It depends more if its stable enough to discover and can happen naturally..  also how rare it is and where its formed.  Elements that can only form in high pressure and are unstable probably never got discover. There must be a finite way of combining molecules so should be possible to see all possible combinations to get an idea of how many undiscovered elements there could be
At about 19:00, Matt speaks of possible multiple separate origins of life on Earth, and why that hasn't apparently happened. I think it is just the Grabby Aliens mechanism, but confined to the bounds of our own ecosystem.
Is there a qualitative difference between stable and unstable isotopes or are they just called stable when their decay rate is too small to detect?
I'm looking for Nigel Braun (NileRed) where is he?? 😈 From Bandung, Indonesia
the energy of em is me and the energy  of s is my granpa holding my hand ilifted me and slappin my butt
I want that shirt
Since Mendeleev is bound to come up again in your videos: the two Es at athe end of his name are pronounced as different syllables: Mendeleyev
No.
The way you pronounce "technetium" makes my ears hurt.
Great explanations.
Here I Am Mildly pissed that he didn't say Vibranium at the start 🤣🤣
Small errata: Tc99m isn't a contrast agent.  The brain MRI (shown in video) used gadolinium as a contrast agent. Technetium can be combined with other molecules as a radiotracer to image physiological function in a different way from conventional cross sectional imaging strategies (CT/MRI). Not to reduce radiation dose.
Yes there are, but I don't think they're all named Question Mark.
Totally using the element Sugdenium in my time travel story!  :)
Just to be clear, dilithium and mithril aren't elements.  They are metallic alloys.
wait, dilithium isnt just regular lithium but the molecules are in pairs?
0.69 milliseconds... nice
Short answer nessisarily YES. Practically and  for more than a few brief moments.... not likely. Except for halides (chlorine fluorine etc) and noble gasses (zenon neon etc) elements beyond 110+ are not likely to be stable enough to exist for any real length of time especially outside of. Compound.
Answer was….? Yes? I don’t get it.
The journey towards the "spacetime" in the outro of this video was the longest yet
Excelente relator, de un elevado nivel de sensatez y de conocimientos científicos y filosóficos. ¡Mis más sinceras felicitaciones!
And about trinitite?
Tempting to believe like finding a new prime number.
I’m just waiting for the periodic table to be made of periodium.
5:23-5:30 hehe this part was redubbed right?
Yes
16:35 Interesting solution for the Fermi Paradox there. We are (one of) the first, since assuming a wrong starting point (we are a "standard" civilisation) is a much easier solution than postulating other hypothetical solutions which rely on some random extinction event that kills EVERY civilisation (if some where left over we would see them). etc. pp.  So you could even argue: The fact that there are no communicating space faring civilisations proves that we are not randomly selected but instead one of the first civilisations. Especially since as was pointed out: A later civ that actually finds communicating aliens would never even have to think about the fermi paradox. So even us asking about that is already setting us apart from a "standard" civilisation.
obviously we need to invent elerium-115 for fusion reactors for our spacecraft if we want to have any chance of fending off the sectoid invasion from mars ;p
How many transuranic elements are useful?  Plutonium and Americium.  Any others?
Just this month scientists have been able to synthesize the first two ultra-heavy elements. They have named them sukonesium and ligmanese.
I have 118 Elements Today
13:02 nice
Bruh i was playing civ when i clicked on this video. That first second gave me a panic attack because i thought someone declared war on me
There is more, one was found on the moon .
Uhhhhhh Krypton is basically Kryptonite lol
There are more than one ways to make a cookie.
It be nearly impossible, but what if some kind of artificially controlled fusing layers or crystal-like patterns of protons and neutrons in order to force a new super heavy element to remain stable?
I like your videos a lot, this one including, however as a scientist working in a related sector, I need to point out that the images you showed as Tc medical are just Xray tomography images, what would be appropriate is Tc99m scintigraphy images (gamma cameras; myocardial perfusion, bone, leukocyte, renal scintigraphies and many more), and this field is generally called Nuclear Medicine or Molecular Imaging. Would you fix that please?
Quick comment: the `strong force' and the `strong nuclear force' are not the same. Essentially, the latter is a residual force from the former, usually just called the `nuclear force'. The strong force shows up in the standard model as one of the fundamental interactions, but the nuclear force doesn't.
How could you miss the NAQUADAH?!
there is for sure stuff we cannot understand yet out in the universe, including elements.
Long way to go, I'm still waiting for room-temperature superconductor
what if Tc needs other environmental parameters than we have on Earth to stay stable?
I just want my conscious in the afterlife to be stored in a lightspeed moving robot that can travel through space.
Kind of? Problem is they would be so radioactive that they would only exist for a fraction of a seconds
That outro was the longest I've been waiting for the SpaceTime drop. What an odd sensation, is this what Dubstep enthusiasts live for?
This was a really fascinating video. I was particularly interested in your explanation on the instability of technetium which I have received for medical diagnosis. Considering it’s place in the periodic table it is fascinating to know why it does not exist in nature. Thanks to your description I am in a better position to understand
The graphics and swoopy sound editing is annoying as heck.
ᴺᵉᵗʰᵉʳᶦᵗᵉ ᶦˢ ᵃⁿ ᵃˡˡᵒʸ (of gold and ancient debris)
Woah did anyone else get this recommended after BobbyBroccoli's video on Victor Ninov? A lot of similar stuff here, seems I've gone down the Physics rabbit hole.
I learned more in this video than I did in school
To obtain Unobtainium, one must merely prepare an alloy of MacGuffinum with Goodstorium.
we were taught in middle school in the mid 1970s about a supposed island of instability. and higher up the elements may settle down and become stable.
Bob Lazar
Physics of the tiny is spell binding. When the tiny collapses on itself breaking the known physics,  what we get is still physics. But we just don't know the rules.
Man I miss chemistry class
"...some will surely have unexpected and perhaps powerful applications..." such as the element that replaced the palladium in Tony Stark's miniature arc reactor, and improves upon it in every way to the point of being a miniature infinity stone in itself.
One Question: Why we can't get Elements with strange and charme or with top and bottom instead of up and down?
4:41 WRONG. It is NOT "perfectly" stable. On the contrary - EVERY single isotope of EVERY single element IS to a particular extent "unstable". It's just the way they convntionally (and technically incorrectly) named those slowly decaying as "stable". But calling them "perfectly stable" is surely a step too far.
Kittycrazium is an element we have in our home!
So, in summary you could say that Half-Life 3 till 14 will be released within the next 5730 years.
Kryptonite is not an element.  It's a mineral comprising Krypton, Oxygen, and traces of Deeseecomicon.
There has to be elements beyond the PT.  There's no way that we, in our tiny little piece of the greater universe,  have discovered every element there is.  It's just not possible.
Silicon age 📉 Stone Age II 📈
Why didn't i find you before
Thank you for this video on element stability and the nucleus. As a high school chemistry teacher, this will be an excellent enrichment resource for the particularly curious student! 😃
Dmitri Mendeleev's last name was mispronounced by you in this video at one minute, twenty-five seconds into this. His name has four syllables, not three.   Please double-check details like this, as I've seen and heard so many other mistakes and omissions from plenty of your videos in the past. As this is a PBS-branded production, I'm shocked and quite disappointed in the overall sloppiness of PBS's production process. Tomorrow's scientists, doctors, and other aspiring young people are watching these videos.   Do it CORRECTLY for them, please.
I love this series
I've seen better videos on this topic that spent more time explaining the details of the  element stability chart. Y'all kind of just glossed over a lot of details that would have made everything make more sense.
we are not alone in the universe
I think Mr Sugden will have to wait a few . . .thousand years for an element with a atomic number of 267 to be created/discovered.    😂😅🤣
Vibranium
there are elements on this planet yet to be discovered
Isn’t there technically infinite elements?
I am 47, you said Mendeleev and I just got a flashback from school in the 80s in science class where I didn't understand a thing and I was told I was going to lose the year. I mean, that is like being told you are going to prison for 20 years.
Obamium
Fakeonium
element 115 ✌
Przybylski's Star has an abundance of Actinides in it's spectra. Like, plutonium, americium, & einsteinium seem to be in it. These should not be present if that star is of any reasonable age. So, either they are from decay of super heavy elements inside that star, or, the light spectrum of this star is being misunderstood.
Maybe stable Element 115 to harness gravity?
Your shirt is very suitable.
It's silly to think we know everything out there, we probably only comprehend 1% of everything we view.
The funniest element ever found was Upsedaisyum, Discovered by Rocky and Bullwinkle.
Since in your last video you corrected yourself on technetium. How - TF! - nobody told you it's 'MENDELE-YEV" table. Not bloody Mendelev. Bloody Aussies.
Im not a chemist or physician, but yea i think there are other elements. I think only elements that are heavier than the current ones known though and unknown ones inbetween.
SUGDENIUM these nuts!! Gottem!
its like: Is there an other super smash worrior ??
So glad they named an element after Adam Ant. ;)
Wish you were around in the 70's when I took O chem.
extremely well articulated and scripted, subscribed haha
Nosebleed😂
A:  yes
Mankind discovering himself and is of no true consequence.
🎼🎵🎶These are the only ones of which the news has come to Harvard,  and there may be many others but they haven't been discovered! 🎵🎶
Yeah it's possible even if you don't add artificially generated elements, there's more than 1,000 natural elements, but with those artificially generated the elements list is closer to 10,000 minimum range, intelligent life can exist on planets whose environment is hostile to human life, something to think about. Most nuclei contain something that helps them work, even true with "unhappy"  nuclei, but it's a question of whether science has discovered what makes nuclei work because understanding that will help if science wants to stabilize elements to make them useful for long term applications. You're not living in an empty universe, just a sparsely populated universe and it's when we as humanity figure out how to exceed the speed of light that we'll be able to go out there and say "hello" to other species that live in this Universe with us.
I wonder if they could change the isotopes of a radioactive material somehow, they could shorten the radioactive period and thereby nullify the effects of radiation much faster. It would certainly make for an interesting science fiction book if I'm not completely wrong about the theory.
Lol that's like saying are there undiscovered planets? 🤣  of course there are we are babies in this universe and we think we have discovered everything? We don't even understand dark matter or black holes yet.
Watch one of those massive stable elements be something amazing that resonates with the same frequency as space itself or something, enabling faster than light warp drives.
OF COURSE there are unknown elements!   What, you think earth - out of the whole universe - has all of the elements???  That's highly improbable!... more than a little silly by my estimation...
I still think the Industrial Age is the Great Filter. Once a civilisation industrialises, it is on an utterly unsustainable pathway, destroying its own biosphere through unintended side effects of its technology.
... technically dont we just have to keep adding electrons? .. wait no thats a entitative, needed a positive... woops
Of course, there are more elements that exist, not represented on the periodic table. Some can not be found on earth because of the conditions we have, especially temperature and pressure. There are some elements on the moon that are not even on our periodic table.  Maybe every world should have its own periodic table.
Kryptonite exists. Just got to chill krypton out a bit at night.
Netherrite is just normal
Humanity’s biggest inefficiency is the ability to measure accurately.  I’m saying you don’t know!
yes
test
what about elements BEFORE hydrogen?
U forgot Sanchesium!
Let me weigh in here.... answer: NO.
0:06 come on you left Obamium out!
If you can squish the neutrons together, you can make it!
Dawg we only discovered elements in the solar system
Another element people wouldn't be expecting the element of nonexistent
I like how he put netherite there and it makes Minecrafter Players watching happy at the last second.
for a sec I thought i heard netherite
All the alien talks after the main topic is kinda redundant unless it’s even possible to leave our own solar system and colonise outside it
The other elements are on different tables
I think there is also Shut-up-calculatanium
What are "preciseley balanced" elements in our list of known elements - the top notch peaks of this "island" of stability : gold, platinum, titanium. These won't decay within foreseeable "infinity" of time. Stable nucleuses and stable electron shells neither being e-negative nor e-positive. Just passive. Also they are super-unwilling to react at room temperature or simply unreactive except for if put under massive thermal stress (loosens electrons because of strong thermal movement - amplitude resp. -exciting) or being dissolved by "combined/reciped" super-aggressive acids to force some electrons free for becoming ions. Interestingly these balanced elements have proven to have katalytic properties to make reactions possible which otherwise are difficult to facilitate.
...so the Stargate superheavy metal Naquada is theoretically possible then?... buzzy
I clicked on this and was shocked as I'm wearing the same shirt...
YOUR FORGOT VIBRANIUM!!
Tin has the most stable isotopes and has a magic number of protons : 50
Here before vibranium is discovered
The Dogon people in Africa, knew of Sirius B before it was possible for telescopes to even image it in the shadow of the much brighter star Sirius A. They said that they gained this knowledge from extraterrestrials who lived in Sirius B. We might be one of the earlier civilizations in the universe, but we are not the oldest. The Fermi Paradox is explained by the Zoo Theory, basically that we are being intentionally left alone to progress to an evolutionary and spiritual 'higher awakening' of existence, as is necessary for all interstellar civilizations to do in order to preserve peace. I would also wager that most if not all, interstellar civilizations have a much greater understanding of God by necessity of their higher reasoning. Either that, or most choose to ignore or not believe in God.
Scandium (Scandinavian), Germanium (Germanic), Gallium (Gaelic/Celtic). Interesting.
20:00 Given the current state of affairs and the fact that we don't seem to be improving, it is very likely that if we survive (highly doubtful) long enough to be a space faring civilization, we will probably be the horrible monstrous aliens devouring and destroying any primitive peoples we run into. Rather than us hiding, it is more likely alien civilizations need to hide from us.  We dream of a "Star Trek" future where all mankind lives in harmony, but events seem to be propelling us towards a "Road Warrior" future.
18:00 There has to be an earliest time that advanced civilizations develop. There has to be time for the heavy elements to be produced which means later generation stars that produce those elements must be born and die. Then there has to be time for the civilization to develop.
15:00 Ridiculously small amounts of Plutonium-239 can be found in pitchblende. I wrote ridiculously small because there is one atom of Pu-239 per one trillion or more Uranium atoms in Pitchblende. That leaves open the possibility of planets where Plutonium is abundant. At the very least, we know that it is produced by natural processes even though here on Earth it is man-made.
Are there possible ways to artificially stabilise unstable elements by, for example, putting them in some appropriate environment?
🤠🤠
True story: Way back in 1951/52  I spent 1st and 2nd grade in a one-room schoolhouse in rural Pennsylvania, near Shanksville  where Flight 93 went down during 9/11.  About 30 kids in 8 grades, one teacher, no running water and outhouses in the back.  We kids used to fill a bucket of water from a hand pump and dump it into a big crock at the back of the class.    It was a fantastic experience for an inquisitive and curious kid like me. I was able to listen to and learn from the lessons given to the other classes above me.  I absorbed  huge amounts far beyond my 6 and 7 year old self.  But I never could figure out what was going on when long division was being taught.  So...we were poor, so poor that the Periodic Table on our wall had only the Alkali Metals and the Lanthanide series.  It's true. Trust me.
Protomolecule ...
Yes but we're not in space yet.96.45
-Island(s) of stability... separate from the well-established continent of stability, but still possess its permanence & lasting nature...  -imagine super heavy elements or isotopes that are as stable as row 2 or 3 elements... -these guys are thinking...that's science...
Bob Lazar - liar or not spoke out about a stable Moscovium before it's official discovery in particle accelerators as a fleeting element.
Transformium should be on here
i think God Can Create Anything ..
I wouldn't say Americium is critical for smokedetectors. Ionic smoke detectors have have been replaced by optical detectors using lasers and mirrors. The sensitivity for these optical detectors can be programmed (not for all types) and they can also include a thermal detector, which allows you to even more specifically program when the detector comes into alarm (combining info from both the optical as well as thermal inputs to know whether there is a real fire or whether it's just dust or humidity). Old ionic detectors containing americium can still be found in old installations, but there aren't a lot of them left and those still present in buildings are being replaced by simple optical or thermal detectors or detectors that contain both optical and thermal instruments; newer ones containing 2 optical chambers and a temp sensor, as well as a tiny amount of memory on a chip to save the data that occured 10 seconds before and after the detector came in alarm.

Hi Matt, the Fermi paradox has a hidden assumption that the footprint of civilizations becomes larger as they evolve. I think this assumption isn't simply unjustified, but is wrong. If we are to discover a civilization, I bet it's such that survived most hash cosmic events. So it would more likely to evolve into something most invincible, maybe a sort of quantum foam rather than remain human-size creatures who travel in factory-like spaceships. If true, such civilizations wouldn't create a significant footprint, at least not in a form that we are looking for. And if true, there is no paradox. In their pursuit to survive, and assuming exponential development of intelligence, the actual civilizations may even live in higher dimensions, certainly in a different time scale, and perhaps travel in multiverse, or be all around us. The romantic side of this scenario is that such state becomes sort of a meeting point of all civilizations.
How about Bullshittium magnetite?  With the hard things we deal with it must exist.
Why do forces even exist ?   EM / Strong -  what is behind all these forces  and dimensions ?    The Universe seems to be using cheat codes !
This is a review of my science class right now
Vibranium wasn't mentioned?
you talk as if we are not already cosmic horrors. But we kinda are, invoking eldritch magics incomprehensible to other animals on earth despite seeming mundane to us. Our benevolence keeps our pets from horror, but cattle is only kept from horror by ignorance. Just like how in lovecraftian tales, most humans are only terrified once cursed with knowledge. We dont have tentacles, but our dextrous hands attached to long arms must invoke some terror in any smaller creatures cursed with understanding of their capabilities.
All this complexity and no one actually designed it. Its just all chance. But if I wanna make a simple table I have to pull out sketch up, design it, and measure, cut, etc.....nice. Not tryin to advocate or be any kinda religious....but it just doesn't make sense.
As I am now grown up man I can say easily that science is much better and much more beautiful than politics and sociology, its just real not some artificial like politics and society issue those things are much more complex than physics maths and chemistry, it's very important that you should take some basic knowledge of science while you r young cos there is so much good information on science that you will die but will not be satisfied
Late on this, but I presume the Period 8 element numberings are an error? Period 8 would presumably still have the * f-block (and maybe also a g-block?) and not be numbered straight across the compact form of the table like that.
Sugdenium. Quite patronizing. I identify as the universe itself.
Positives attract. Opposites don't attract. Which is how positively charged particles fill the negative space. In which those positive particles replace the previously negatively charged space with the negatively charged particles in which they existed. Which in turn makes it's existence negatively charged behind it's movement.  Neutrons create a mask of what's "attracted". Due to overabundance of electrons?
Of course their is. It'd be ignorant to think otherwise.
Great video. Loved it.   There are a few tiny errors in the brief section about Tc in medical imaging. Tc-99m with its 140 keV photon is the "work-horse" of nuclear radiology, and we use a gamma camera to collect those photons. There is a kernel of truth in that it plays an important role in medical imaging. However, it's not a "contrast agent" as radiologists typically use the term, and none of the images shown were of a nuclear medicine study using Tc-99m. The contrast agents used in the images you showed were gadolinium-based (MRI) and iodine-based (CT). These elements do have useful physical properties, but radioactivity isn't among them. Apologies if this has already been pointed out.
Excellent channel - THANKS! Instead of going up the periodic table, could there be heavier cousins of the elements where the protons and neutrons are made up of the heavier elementary particle element cousins? So a heavy proton cousin is made up of two charms and one strange? Do we have enough knowledge to dismiss this construct?
Are there Undiscovered Elements Beyond The Periodic Table?   The very short, and realistic factual answer....is YES.
I'm old enough that I remember seeing the periodic table in chemistry class with elements 104 and up not even having proper names, just placeholder numeric names.
49,500
Yes!  Honor-em!
What about element 115 that Bob Lazar found?
Shells are the things snails have; atoms have orbitals
so is any element actually stable infinitely ? or are their half lives so long that we consider them stable ? kinda like how we think glass is a solid, but isn't. Which begs the question: will all elements break down after a while ? like after the death of all the stars? If so what happens then ?
??????????????     PLASMA  AGE  ???????????????
Wouldn't di-lithium just be... Two lithium atoms? Di means two
Anybody ever tell you you look a little like Peter Dinklage?  (That's a compliment.)
I hope it's element zero.
Yes 294 still missing
Add Vibranium to that list.
param dhan tatva is found by bharat that is name of god
This seems like someone saw "The man who tried to make an element" and decided to make a mainstream video of just the controversy free science part.
I dont know why, but the Australian accent helps me understand some of this. The algorithm worked this time! Time to go digging through playlists!
Technically neutron stars are just giant atoms, are they not?
What about:         Um The element of confusion
Here's what I have always personally thought/believed, going all the way back to Elementary School in the mid to late 70's when we first started learning about the Periodic Table of Elements: our scientists and so-called 'experts' actually DON'T know EVERYTHING. Just think about it. Back when the Periodic Table was FIRST created ALL the so-called 'experts' CLAIMED "that's ALL there is", and yet as years and decades passed NEW Elements (MANY existing as NATURAL in nature) previously UNKNOWN were being discovered. So for the so-called 'experts' to TRY to 'claim' that NO other NATURAL Elements could exist is PURE STUPIDITY in it's MOST obvious.  Now that DOESN'T mean that the so-called 'experts' are wrong, because it's ENTIRELY possible that they might actually be right.  But, it's ALSO ENTIRELY POSSIBLE that they could be COMPLETELY WRONG.  We simply DON'T KNOW yet, because our technology and scientific knowledge is CONSTANTLY improving.  Just my own personal opinion anyway.
I'm hoping Veritasium is discovered and is stable a vlog temperature and pressure.
My middle name is “Unobtainium”
I'm tired of people stupidly referring to Unumpentium (Element 115 and now renamed Moscovium) as Unobtanium! Now Mc, it used to be Uu.
Element 137
Vibranium!!
I really don't believe that we are the 🥇
Found one! It fell under the table!    GET IT?..... the PeriodicTable!!!! Ahhhhhhh...... wakka wakka wakka! Damn, that one was.... Off the Chart!!!!
There are other elements. Anti matter, strange matter, dark matter, exotic matter, and neutron star nuclear pasta.
I’m thinking it might be something more along the lines of what we may see in comics or movies, after all, isn’t that what those early scientists would’ve classified the technology we use to make the synthetic elements now? We may not understand it, yet, but that doesn’t mean we can’t accomplish it. Plus that graph you showed us, how dated is it because I think mankind can and will always surprise itself with what is and isn’t possible.  Did Astrology think we were a planet rotating for the day/night or that a year was us rotating around the sun? No Did Newton believe gravity was the essence of the universe being curved towards the ground(or however you would describe that). No Heck the New World wasn’t even discovered until about 500 years ago There’s probably, in my eye, just so much we haven’t seen to be possible, yet. I look into the world and see the impossible…. or I suppose better said acknowledge it since I don’t know it either, yet.
Did you forget upsidasium?
If we were aBle to change electron, neutron and proton number then we can make more elements and study
I desire the forbidden spicy atoms
Did you name thorium as a fictitious element? Isn't that real?... Never mind, you said mithril that's what I thought was thorium for some reason
20:07 Speak for yourself - I'd like to be a funny cephalopod monster.
Damn, it's been a while since I've watched PBS Space Time, the last time that I actually saw Matt was as a guest on an old episode of Star Talk, with Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Chuck Nice. And he looks quite a bit older than the last time I saw him 😅 To be fair, it HAS been probably 3-5 years because it was an old episode, and I havent seen him on this channel in ages either because I mostly watch other channels. A beard can really have a big effect on how mature you look, the last time I saw him he was clean shaven and baby faced 🤣😂🤣 So it's less about him actually looking old, and more about me not being caught up with him or the channel lol. Growing a beard is the Male equivalent to wearing makeup lmaooo. Tell me I'm wrong lol
just get to the point where u say element 115 is used for FTL drives.:D
yes. obviously. we are primative apes/ idiots - we aint that smart yet
Taldgium: 181, Tg. Discovered by throwing Francium in a lake.
Element 115 is what makes FTL travel possible.
Spamium, I dont think anyone knows where SPAM originated
Most Scientists: (checks current literature) "No, probably not  👎."  (Research is done later revealing new elements)  Same Scientists: "Oh.  It's yes now. 👍"
M. Sc. of chemistry here: Yes there are but the relative values of the strong nuclear force and electromagnetism inhibits their stability drastically. 😉
11:39 I've seen this graph before in one of the mit classes available on YouTube
From Punjab to Pacoima guys be Vibing, but I'd rather vibe in Tasmania tbh m8
The missing element is intelligence, and the chemical abbreviation IQ
does the addition/subtraction of neutrons to make an isotope cause the electron structure or # of electrons to change? Or will that always be equal to the protons and have the same shell structure? Would the electron structure have anything to do with an isotopes radioactivity? Like TC97 is more stable than TC96 because the amount of neutrons pairs better with 43 electrons?
they found empty beer cans
My stroke suffered a stroke trying to process all this information
Every neutron star is a stable nucleus
Netherite got me😆
Life expectancy of nonrealitive forms of antimatter can be found in the periods of future children
Isn't "dark matter' just an undiscovered element (or elements)?
If it wasn't PBS.
Moscovium is rumoured to have a stable isotope that can be used as a fuel source.
Bob Lazar told about element 115 which Russia discovered as Moscovium.
NO. 43: Technetium
netherite? you need nether portal
This was good, I am half way through and I am going to have to watch it again a few more times to understand that much.
That's so cool, I have that exact shirt.
The universe varies widely in its conditions. When you have nuclear fusion in the sun under that much pressure and that much energy you may have energies and conditions different enough that some of these larger less stable nucleus is under our conditions can be stable under those conditions.
The 'jazz hands'...wow
17:31 Incredibly put.
Is the pronunciation an Aussie thing?  It is pretty jarring.
Loads video, ignites blunt
Sometimes when I watch these videos, it reminds me of the turbo encabulator...
What if a black hole is actually one giant singular atom made of an element that is only stable with a massive amount of neutrons and kept stable over the black holes lifetime via hawking radiation
Bro, how could you not mention Vibranium at the beginning?
I was wondering many times if there is an element that preceds hydrogen by imagining a half of the proton and half of the electron to construe it artificially.
The graph at 11:40 looks almost like the stroke of a paintbrush. As if reality is a painting, and each facet of physics, merely a single stroke of Gods hand.
is there really an atomic table or just  a neat way to put objects into line and order for our own use and convenience
******Yes! every time we discover a new law, we get to Break it,More powers🎉 Now you tell me.where can i buy a Ring,Will it make my car change Color hahaha kool
I remember the island of stability being one of the first ideas that got me so into physics. Yes, It's a physics problem that just has applications in chemistry. Ironically, it was in a chemus5ry class where I got a periodic table and wondered, why does it stop?
Elements go with the land and new ones will be showing up. Through main  many sources that finalize into our sheet and form and formatting a sheet together isn't as hard as you think but having the knowledge of knowing Fossil °/•√tone'⅒/°
Hey honey its netherite time
Adamantium isn't an element. It's an alloy.
Many more elements still to be discovered.
Where is veritesium
Where is the protons brain how does it interpret these packets
Element 115
Say, what? Balonium? 🙂
Missing Elements  ALGOBARIUM (115)  BORINDIUM (121)  CELEBIUM (113)  CORBOMITE (140)  DIBURNIUM (122)  DIKIRONIUM (112)  DITLITHIUM (119)  INDURITE (124)  IRILIUM (116)  KIRONIDE (139)  MURINITE (123)  PERGIUM (111)  RODINUM (125)  RUBINDIUM (120)  TOPALINE (117)  TRICOBALT (129)  TRITANIUM (125)  TRITITANIUM (128)  TRIUIUM (127)  ZIENITE (118)
what about elements 0.1 to 0.9??
Why is it called the 'Periodic' table? Also, why is Hydrogen at the top and all the others valued according to how much Hydrogen they have?
Originally we were supposed to get an island of stability around element 114, but they just keep getting more unstable as we make heavier elements.  The heavier elements seem to be caught in a squeeze in which those that do not have a high enough neutron to proton ratio alpha decay very rapidly, whereas those that have a higher neutron to proton ratio spontaneously fission (you see this first with fermium, of which isotope 257 is the most stable isotope, alpha decaying with a half-life of 100.5 days, and then isotope 258 spontaneously fissions in less than a millisecond (and note that the even-even rule of stability doesn't work here and for some other transuranium elements), and isotopes 259 and 260 also spontaneously fission very quickly.  After fermium, you get a slight break with mendelevium, for which you can get the highest few isotopes to have enough neutrons that they can actually beta decay, but then starting with nobelium anything that doesn't alpha decay spontaneously fissions, and it gets faster until by the time you get to the upper end of what we have been able to make, you can't do anything with what you have made other than confirm detection.  Current technology (ramming calcium 48 into a heavy element) should in principle get us to Element 121 -- in principle, it should be possible to make macroscopic quantities of einsteinium (actually, we already did that at least once, with einsteinium 253, half life 20.47 days, and that isn't even the most stable isotope), Fermium 257 (half-life 100.5 days), and mendelevium 260 (half life 27.8 days); adding 20 protons gets you Elements 119, 120, and 121, respectively.  After that, you would have to use a heavier projectile (they're already trying titanium 50, with no success so far), but then you won't be able to get as high a neutron to proton ratio, so alpha decay instability will be even worse, and then you really won't be able to detect what you have made, let alone do anything with it.
Wakanda's vibranium still remains unknown to him
Ununbium
Or, the shortsighted, soon to be extinct, Republican ones. We don't want to be remembered as that.
I've pondered this possibility AGES ago. All it took for me was to look at the entirety of the periodic table and start thinking of it as a PIECE of a GIGANTIC JIGSAW PUZZLE.
Netheite/calcum is a fifty fifty percentage of fictional and non fictional element maybe.
are there elements made of dark matter <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
There is growing evidence that we are not alone in the universe ande that we've been lied to by the government.  The whistleblowers are the actual government agents themselves coming forward after being threatened to stay quiet.  I'm referring to the astronauts that went to the moon and the recent release of UFO citings by our government.  The astronauts have all come forward saying that they were scared on the moon because they saw structures there that were artificial and they took pictures of the structures.  NASA has doctored all of the photos according to the astronauts.  These weren't slouches.  Not just anyone was allowed to go to the moon.  For all of them to come back and say they saw something and for that to be ignored by our press and our government is astonishingly brazen and BS.  THEY THINK THEY KNOW BETTER FOR US.  Of course they don't and now they had so much pressure to release the footage that they paratially complied.  They released UFO sightings, but NASA will not acknowledge any photos that were taken.  There are reports of people that did get to see the footage.  So we're not alone, and they've likely been here for a long time.  Likely, they have helped us evolve, hopefully for the better.  Why are they concealing themselves?  They are probably the ones running everything that we can't see and they figure our political scapegoats are better to take the brunt of civilization's critique than an alien to this world.  Conspiracy theory?  Absolutely!  Trouble is that they are becoming fact more and more these days.  Look up the astronauts' testimony.  They were threatened with their lives to keep secret.
13:30 So u-310 will be adamantium, got it. Need to remember that for potential scifi writing.
There's an elephant in the room. Shape, structure, geometry immediately come to mind as parameters that could explain an element instability; the current paradigm doesn't accept structured atom models and so the issue is not mentioned. But this makes it impossible to intuitively understand the situation for a viewer.
13:03 0.69ms? Nice!
Fascinating, Matt O’Dowd & PBS Space Time!
Tony Stark already made a new element in Ironman 2.
How often has a physicist said "we' re getting there" only to discover we're not even close? You'd think they'd learn. The hubris
At the moment of the big bang just as the universe was all one point, all the material and the protons would have been in one place for a moment could that have made the universe one element at a single moment in time? Move time a bit further and then there would be other elements of very high proton counts?
20:01 LOL! Um, excuse me? Those two aren't mutually exclusive. There's no reason why a civ couldn't be both. Lovecraft _merely_ had a fondness of painting unknowns in sinister light.
This explication, especially explaining rare earths, greatly intrigue me.
This concept of undiscovered elements is pretty awesome and a core part of a story I've been working on for a long time!
It's not Mendelev but Mendeleyev : /ˌmɛndəlˈeɪəv/ MEN-dəl-AY-əv :)
Orichalcum isn't by ANY means fictional; rather, if it is, prove it! You won't be able to, because for all we know, orichalcum is another name for platinum or bronze. Just because we may call it something else now doesn't mean it's fictional!!
Is the layout of the periodic table of the elements arbitrary?
Wouldn't you like to know the chances of being alone
We are yet to discover "Veritasium"
we don't discover elements beyond the periodic table. We have to invent them - they don't occur in nature.
Holy crap. So without the strong force we couldn’t exist?
Warp drive ahah
Maybe there are faults in the basic concepts.
Name of element 2,147,483,647 = Duqsqothqs Name of element 267 = -Dhs- Su
Netherite is technically an alloy though. And that's assuming ancient debris is only 1 or 2 elements, and not a whole mixture like concrete or something
Whose voice pops up couple of times in the video?
First i be honest I don't like your speaking way because is like making my sister . but the real problem whit humans your species is humans have been downplay in capacity . we have been in this world far longer than humans ever imagine because the masters can't aloud your species humans to grow too smart but your so call elements are too many because we still discover ones in a wild
I used to have that shirt
You left out the toughest material in the universe, Hardasfuckoum!
How dare you leave out Vibranium?  Just another case of a white man not giving any credit to the great achievements of the greatest and most technological civilization built by black ppl.
I don’t understand why a few neutrons can’t stick together by the Strong Force with no protons present.
Maybe more elements are probably found in space because the influence of gravity could determine if those certain elements create newer elements, or I'm just saying nonsense
16:20 i hope Sadge will become a stable parti...cipant :)
∞ ≈ Δ { _______  } π    [Ω = A]
Tech nee she umm
Anyways.. I love your shirt.
I think my brain got smashed by a Minecraft ingot
Orichalcum and element zero are real. Element zero is a neutron and orichalcum is a complex of gold and copper
4:08 I demand the bringing about of the Age of Eezo. It's about time.
Unobtainium. I got a kick out of that one.  Listen to Phil Schneider and Robert Lazar on the topic. They'll tell you straight away our periodic table is incomplete.
I think that it is possible that an entire undiscovered periodic table could exist.
The periodic table is designed incorrectly.  There are as many metals as there are frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum.
The two most common elements in the universe are hydrogen and stupidity.
How can we say that this is everything that exists without us knowing how anything has come to existence in the first place? As long as we can’t find the answer to that question, anything can be out there no matter how far-fetched things can sound.

"The details deserve their own episode..." Now I wanna see THAT episode.
There would have to be. To think otherwise is as arrogant as thinking that there's no other life in the universe.
hi im mikeo rider, (you may ahve seen a comment by my aquitance michael dickins) & i;m working on a device to discover all new elements beyond the periodic table & this find the real-deal variants of these fictional ellemnts, compounds & more, the atom former!!!!
Of course there are. Don't be so arrogant as to think you can know all the elements in the universe without knowing what's beyond the horizon, or what DARK MATTER is. Duh.
So are there any ideas on how we would be able to create the elements from the island of stability, except with a particle accelerator the size of the milky way?
element 137 ?
Woot half life game reference! 😘 best game everrrr!
similarly there are other tables of elements periodically.
similarly there are other tables of elements periodically.
It doesn't have to be a new element.  It's more about finding new and better compounds
HALF LIFE C14 CONFIRMED
Of course. We most likely haven't found everything here on Earth, and it's foolish to assume there's NOTHING left in the ENTIRE UNIVERSE to discover.
The combination of elements in  minerals provides unknown properties. And there are also isotopes of known elements. So there There's a lot of room for surprise.  Unobtainium is more likely to be a new mineral than a new element.
Eventually They’re gonna find element 115 from Call of Duty in a meteorite
What about gravity as nuclei get bigger? Could the mass of a nucleus start to become a factor in it's properties as they get bigger?  Could those elements be created in a black hole and squirted out of a white hole as dark matter?
I had that shirt in 5th grade and did not need to be reminded of it.
We are currently in the Graphene age. This is too important to be missed out.
Bolognium! LOL
This guy doesn’t know what to do with his hands
There any work being done on isomeric transitions for energy storage potential? Tantalum looks interesting i think 🤔
Yes, it's infinite, even if it may be too short lived.
If you closely inspect the half lives of isotopes at a radionuclide map it will become clear that no new stable high mass isotopes will ever be found. There may be new elements found, yes, but it is very improbable that they will be stable ones.
Ytterbium
You thanked everyone in your video description... except for Mendeleev.
I firmly believe there are other elements outside the periodic table. Reasoning? Due to the vast size of space and the fact that humans haven't even been exposed to 1% of the Universe, the idea that the elements hav discovered on one planet in one solar system is the complete list EVERY basic element is highly doubtful. I've watched Star Trek, Star Wars, Stargate......NO ONE on earth should honestly believe the periodic table is 100% complete.....at the present time.
JP - Pristium after Judas Priest - hard metal!!!!!!
Great video! I'm mostly fascinated by possible resolutions of the Fermi Paradox. My favorite one is that we're still not spiritually evolved enough for more intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations to make contact with us. First we need to learn to get along with one another and fix our own planet!
Yes there are. Just haven’t discovered or built them yet.
To think humans have gained one grain of sand worth of knowledge about the Universe is probably giving us too much credit.
Potato
Damn I haven't watched this channel in 6 years and boy does it show. Not sure what facial features changed exactly but I guess more body fat stored in the lower parts of the face, less collagen, and this happens. Damn.
This whole video and the ending was so interesting, I love it!
mmm netherite
Lmaoooo I have that same shirt design on a poster in my bedroom
omg !.. im starting to understand the videos !!...  WTF !!
Wasn't it Richard Feynman that theorized elements above a certain number (don't remember if it was 150 or 250) to be stable?
Dude your T-Shirt was a blast from the past. I own that, too!
6:30 - So what I'm hearing is these other elements could possibly exist in nature in our universe, but probably only found in very extreme environments like the matter found in a blackhole.
What’s with all the fluff in this video? Just answer the title question already
And what about Naqadah/Naqadria, Trinium i Neutronium :P
It really bugs me how he keeps mispronouncing "Technetium".
We only know of the elements here on earth and little of what's out there, who knows, our elemental table just might be a crude base for more advanced elements.
Well done!   Thank you.
New alloys? Yep. New stable ultra heavy elements? Unlikely. If a supernova can't make it, I doubt we can.
Waiting for unobtainium...
Short answer: YES.  Long answer: need more context...
7:50
The real Periodic Table was hidden in the begining of 20th century. Thats the first lesson we had in Chemistry in High School.
F
Are we early? Maybe in this region of the galaxy. In the universe? I doubt it.
The sheer fact that we don't fully know yet what is required to make an atom stable means that there are most likely big surprises ahead of us.
Forgot vibranium! Someone didn't just watch Black Panther
The end of this video is an excellent example of what it sounds like when idiots argue with themselves.
They should name the next element netherite
If it gets there and we find 267, we have to spam this video to the founders of the element so that it can be officially named Sugdenium, actually a really great name for an element, there's been way worse... Tennessine and Rutherfordium... I'm looking at you guys.
after 16:40 i did not understand anything he was saying xd
Matt, in light of recent disclosure by US military and security agencies concerning technology and possible NHI existence is it not then about time ' science' caught up and instead of denial maybe do something a bit more positive ? Is this all lies and subterfuge with dodgy agendas? Has the ridicule factor remained despite these disclosures? Do anthropic principles and Fermi paradox get in the way of the general public and science institutions willingness to accept that we are not the paragon of the cosmos or the Old Ones but are newbies in the cosmos? Smartest on the block? Eh, maybe not...
I don't really think most of the newer elements that they have "discovered" count as elements in the first place. If it dosn't exist in nature because its halflife is too short, then it is not really an element
What is the chemistry expectation of that new island of stability?
Unknownium Uk
Maybe an element with number 3.14
This should be scientifically predictable
We have got to redo our math because our math is even wrong with time travel
The ultimate killer has to become the ultimate guardian or else evolution has to start from scratch again.
Also, by structuring the existing elements in different ways, new materials, configurations, states of matters can be discovered. E.g. carbon nanotubes, time crystals, superfluid. etc. are not new elements, but new "substances", and they are big dsicoveries. So even if we don't disover new elements, new materials can be made.
Wut netherite?
in essence each time we add a proton, electron or a neutron the property of the matter changes (elements / atoms...but i have my reasons to frame this question this way ) ok say there is a force that sucks every thing ...neutrons protons and electrons along with all the quantum particles ...into a small point eq a black hole .... It could be said to be a collection of protons, neutrons and electrons and due to the immense gravity the heavere particles would be at the center and lighter particles near the surface ...we also know black holes have a diameter thus this would mean that there are certain forces that are able to resist the pull of gravity ....  So could it be possible that just like atoms could black holes have different properties depending on the amount of matter they have consumed (of course the more they eat would change their property ) If this happens then and we can document different types of black holes (may be by the type of particles they emit or different forms of energy) we would be one step closer to understanding the theory of every thing / unification .... as these energy released would be a way of stabilisation of black holes...  also if two black holes follow the same path ...i.e they release the type of energy at same stages (same mass- number of quantum materials absorbed ) this could also be used to prove that black holes just like the elements evolve as there nuclese grows and in a predictable manner consistent with the elements we observe
Next is unknowntium or nevertium or secretium or amazinatium🤩🤩😁😁😁
You forget 1 element  STALINIUM
Theres a element named krypton (yes i just completed my chemistry exam)
The periodic table is great and all but since its displayed in every science class and past chemistry teachers have made students memorize it i do feel it carries quite a baggage that detracts from what makes chemistry interesting. Physics classes are "safe" too and so the preferential treatment they will have will lead parents to desire that more then something that could lead their children the capabillity to ignite or explode something. Alchemists gave this a sort of esoteric art flair with real human desires bound to it some even noble as in finding a cure for everything and it has helped medicine now. I fear there might be a loss of spark for chemistry and the reason i fear this is because chemistry gives you confidence in the understanding of your surroundings and the world you life in where physics just gives you deeper understanding of things our bodies have already instincts for.
All based in pressure mediation and resonance…  The periodic table I used in the lab is based on fractal geometry and resonance.  Elements are not atom based…  Elements are harmonics
it sounds like we found a bunch of elements but didnt find their stable versions. It sounds like radioactive elements like uranium could have stable versions but its so hard and so rare to come by
If there’s a new atom I’ll call it ignimun and symbol is Ig
Laboratories provide conditions for element's character. Planets also provide conditions for element's character.  Had we mixed planets...I believe that's the new element's discovery way. The Shoe Levi 9 ☄️ has demonstrated my explanation.
It's worth considering that some of the elements we call "radioactive" due in large part to where they are on the Periodic Table, ie. how heavy, are essentially extremely stable, almost not radioactive -- U-238 having a half-life of 4 and a half billion years. Since our models aren't going to predict before we create any new elements among the Island of Stability, there very well could be an isotope or two (or more) that are perfectly stable, even moreso than a U-238 etc. And who knows what secrets that could unlock...
Walter White discovered them probably
Mithril according to Tolkien's description is just titanium and he is the one that first thought of the metal and gave it it's name... So I wouldn't say it is a made up metal but the name the dwarves of Middle Earth who discovered titanium called it which is the made up part. Unobtainium isn't even supposed to be an existing element but an unobtainable thing someone seeks that they cannot ever find because it does not exist or is not present where they search. Not present being: "Bob's over there in his so called gold mine searching for unobtainium again." being a joke about bob trying to get gold out of an mine that has none. So that one also shouldn't be on the list at the start of the video too.
0:07 thats the iron icon in MineCraft not the netherite one
I squashed a penny on a train track once.  I am an expert.
when i see him trying to explain the strong nuclear force and quark packets to me, i get the feeling that the phenomenon must be able to be explained easier. We have made it to difficult for ourselves to understand whats going on by giving weird names to all kinds of theoretical particles.    Is there a way to try understanding this from a more basic level ? I hope someone understands what im trying to say.
Can an element really be "undiscovered" if it doesn't occur naturally and hasn't yet been invented in a lab?
Netherite is very clearly a alloy.
Undiscovered elements...almost assuredly. Naturally occurring undiscovered...probably not.
Since the 90s they added like 8 elements
I read somewhere that all elements strive to be iron and given enough time everything will eventually turn into iron :P Is this true?
Is he South African?
I personally believe the great filter is the solution to the Fermi paradox, Let me be more precise. I believe the great filter sits at the urge  to colonise and innovate. Humans evolved because of luck. Dinosaurs flooded the world not allowing mammals to thrive for the majority of earths history. Luckily Earth was hit with an asteroid and luckily earth is uncommonly hit by large asteroids thanks to our solar systems alignment allowing for evolution to go past tough insects that can survive large asteroids. Luckily we were too weak to survive so we prioritised intelligence and luckily Homosapien's evolved to socialise and not get stronger unlike Neanderthal's.  My point is we where extremely lucky, dinosaurs showed no sign of change and intelligence wasn't important past limited survival advantages. What are the chances that colonies of aliens appear when its far more efficient to evolve to be best in your small environment.  Why would a species evolve to be too weak to survive and be forced to innovate?? Most species with that flaw would be wiped out like we almost where.  There are obviously many other solutions that can have an effect but personally this one makes sense to me. What do you think?  Also I know this should be in the other video but I just started typing after the end of this one so...
yes
Really good episode
Its been a long time since i watched an episode that i understand all the way through.
You forgot about Vibranium and the Omega Particle.  😁
Being "nuclear savvy " I know that the big cooling towers release only harmless steam.  I suggest you refrain from "lighting them up as an illustration of nuclear power.  I've heard some criticize nuclear for all of the "smoke " and worry if it's radioactive; when it's really the most harmless part of any power plant anywhere.   Thanls for the good work!
I heard that there is an element called vibranium in an isolated country in Africa.  Can anyone verify that??
I have that same shirt
I'm so ashamed of myself because I immediately thought "sussium"
Aren't they called neuron stars?
Me, someone who's still in highschool chemistry, trying to understand all of this:
Seeing the half life logo made me smile. I will never stop thinking about that game when speaking about the half life of an element.
Edgar Cayce indicated years ago that the table of elements was incomplete. I would tend to believe him.
What is the half life of a proton?
Oganesson nice
I think there's a spot for emergent life that's not killed by more evolved ones, because it's somewhat toxic but the very evolved ones find it interesting and help it. Like an arsenic based lifeform which would not compete with carbon based life, and is risky to touch. It could have an immense advantage in some niche otherwise mostly uninhabitable environment, like a sulphur based lifeform living in sulphur vents.
Um...by definition dilithium is 2xlithium atoms. Its not an element. wtf dude.
Have you ever read the book "Atomgewicht 500" by Hans Dominik? If you haven't, you should.
*GLOW IS THE UNDISCOVERED ELEMENT REMEMBER MY WORDS ONE DAY U WILL ASK NE HOW U KNOW THIS EARLY*
Why not list Vibramium?!?
What about the elements not made with protons neutrons and electrons such as the ones made with positrons etc
Great program - wonder if the presenter is of Italian descent like myself - can't talk without using his hands!  ;-)
One of them NEEDS to be named surprise, with an atomic symbol of Ah!
Quick answer: Yes
One of the few episodes I mostly understood.
Looking for a stable element 115 👽
Sorry, I was distracted by your shirt. I found the original image for it and the one labeled "Ni" doesn't make any sense to me. Ni is Nickel normally, but for the shirt its on snow. Why is snow Ni at all? A well, the number for it on the shirt is 78, which is the number for platinum, while nickel is 28. Why is clay "Co", why is air "Ae", why is ice "Gl"? Most of it is alright but come on.
The periodic table is basically just a set of new pokemons confirmed.
Does anyone know what "the dark forest solution to the Fermi-paradox" is? It's mentioned at the end of the video. It sounds a bit like he is suggesting that the reason we haven't seen anyone, may be that everybody is hiding.
It's real, and I've tried looking into it, but it takes like 10 minutes just to find a foothold into say the future periodic table
When I said thst to my first chemistry teacher he said Mr odell is a genius and he is also correct as the class laughed at me expecting that is all there is but there are other elements we just haven't found them and those elements are the future nit inly do they hold electrons amd energy it's like haveing a disk brake but not a wheel ....to put on this subject is kinda crazy but those sound can be translated in to code and in the future the spin will be code it is ones and zero and can and do communicate and can be manipulated so that man can use it as code ..and man will decide the world srroind him time travel and space travel will b done after we discover this ...those codes if the spins ...go ask about three different professors about this and tell them to think about it before they awnser ...as this is the key to unlock the future it's is the next step to become a 5th dimensional  thought ...it'll be magnitcis and light that form out future and frame man and allows man to do impossible things like gravity ,space amd time ...also please do research this nucliaer spin and code as you'll not be able to rap you mind arround what I'm saying ...if you don't all we need is a Rosetta stone to be able to read the code nature is running all arroind us when we under stand that then more elements will be discovered or a nuclear war ....that's probably what will happen ...civilization as a democracy only lasts 300 years ....historically it will be a war
Yes there are a whole lot of other elements this table is not complete when we get into distilling the atmosphere will find new element I fancy myself a genius can't spell but I'm really smart ...and when I sae the periodic table for the first time hen I was about ten I thought where is the rest of them this is what got me into chemistry .. so what it is that these elements are so rare in earth thst they just done appear accept in very minute amounts and these elements on earth are probably exceptionally rare other places this should be assighned by planet not just exist period because in and if its self the periodic table is incomplete as you can always see any element change when affected by another chemical reaction so it's kinda like cool aid right nothing works alone but when you combine then it works and that what thty ll find that elements on other planets are different than this table and those will have diffent reaction look st H20 and helium three that the best file look at it in paper and then run a modeling reaction with those two elements it will reasles extream energy and thst reaction ...laymen soeaking would be like gasoline that dosent require a spark
Not very fun fact:The periodic table created by russian scientist D. I. Mendeleev. In russian people just call it the Mendeleev's table.
you forgot vibranuim
lmao i noticed the shirt
Giving you 0 screen time because that’s obvious af. Sad a million people needed to know this
Glenn sug den
😂🎉😢😮😅😊❤ What 😮 do you think 🤔  😅🎉make up your own mind  An American still using an iPhone Xʀ
In space or on earth ?
Maybe the advent of artificial intelligence will bring about a golden age of discovery including novel ways of stabilizing proton configurations using a vibration-centric way of harmonizing proton/neutron/electron  'electro-chemical affinity'.
APFSDSium 126
Netherite so i could make netherite armor in real life yeahh buddy
I mean the shirt says it all!
Couple of thoughts here... How do we know that stable elements are indeed stable and not have just incredibly long half-life. Computing what is going on in nucleus is indeed difficult but shouldn't we still be able to derive chemical properties of the hypothetical elements? If determining the stability is so difficult, is anyone trying to use  AI on it (kinda like protein folding was solved)? But I guess so few elements are really tnot great for AI learning.
the arc rector?
Can someone explain me what happens if you take a short-lived elements like oganesson and add isotopes to it, could it get a longer half-life?  Jesus, first time in my life I feel too ignorant or straight up, too dumb to understand something, I'm 25 as of now. Wow.
Mithril? Bro rs is the best game
"That's why neutrons are so useful, they help separate protons so that the strong nuclear force stays stronger than electromagnetism."  That's really interesting, never thought of it that way
Are there more elements there? yes , most likely there are . They could be rare or not or super important but we wouldn't find out till we discover them ,it could also be that we may never find some very rare or very far away element till the end of time.
It would be very arrogant to assume we have found everything that exists in the universe
but have you thought about 4 dimensional bonds. we only think 3 dimensional but technically nothing stops them from doing bonds in other directions.
Dilithium is just Li2 the rare crystalline form of non ionized Iithium.
Omg that periodic table of Minecraft is ANCIENT.
I think I had a bolognium sandwich the other day. Tasted kind of weird, should have know it was made from an undiscovered element.
Why doesn't someone just name them, we know exactly what their atomic weight/mass & so on will be it is just a matter of tech.
If Bob Lazar is to be believed, a stable isotope of element 115 "Moscovium" will allow us to manipulate/create gravity.  Obviously a long shot, but a neat thought nonetheless.
This video screams "How Do You Do, Fellow Kids?"
what about "Stalinium"?
yes, dude you only need know what gravity is to realize that gravity itself makes elements on the sun or on other dense bodies that we cant recreate her unless in a lab. Silly video title displays your innate lack of understandign of what the periodic table represents.
Does it matter for stability if the isotope is neutral or an ion?
The strong force surrounds us, binds us nuclei together, but that's not a story the Jedi would tell you.
Bro, I'm here trying to find out if there is an element that has the same properties as Vibranium.
Heh, nice Minecraft shirt
…YES?!
Because many stars are collections of protons. Could you consider a star a giant atom?
Unobtanium is one...
You have forgotten about Elerium-115!
Kryptonite sounds like someone got lazy and decided to take the name "krypton" and added a "nite" at the back just so people can't get confused
😀😀😁😁😍😍👍👍Shop Now
The problem with assuming an universe empty of intelligent life is its most probably wrong. Even if you allowed for it taking billions of years for intelligent life to emerge anywhere in the universe. The probability we are the first is vanishingly small. With the recent release of the U.S. defense department videos of objects that they admit are not ours(that is not from earth), that probably has become zero.
Most metals are silvery gray. Exceptions include gold and copper.
element 115 imagine
would be fun if it cycles back... the higher elements for some reason being stable again. So say, element 300 could be in the palm of our hands.
Disliked for saying "Unobtanium". I thought it was incredibly stupid then, and that feeling hasn't lessened over time.
E
Ofc there are
No
Element 115
Well these highly volatile elements that has very small life spans would exist longer in the environment that has a massive time dilation such as a neutron star or a pulsar or black holes around their orbits or in accretion disk.
This was actually a question i asked my self very often, sadly often things we enjoy most get the fewest time.
I use to think about this all the time in high school.
Since the universe is so huge and infinite, there are definitely elements we don't know about.
i have your shirt on a piece of paper (since 2015)
THE BEST EXISTENCE IS NONE EXISTENCE.  KNOW LIFE, KNOW PAIN.  NO LIFE, NO PAIN.  ANTINATALISM.
How DFT is applied to nuclear simulations? As far as I know, DFT is best suited for large systems (fluids, electrons in large molecules). So, DFT simultions of a  nucleus with 300 protons+neutrons would give accurate results? Or there are another aspects which makes the DFT the best suited method?  Great episode!!!
Anti-Fun
It looks like it's a curveball
water was at a time it's own element, H2S gas was at a time its own element, iron oxide was at a time it's own element... to say Tc is an element or not an electro chemically manufactured ferric dust as its own nitrated element maintaining ferric properties in a liquid solution creating heavy water with soluble nitrated elements of very low thermal decomposition reactivity... staged core reactors. uranium reacts at 130*C releasing 700*C to kick over a second reactor using something more abundant that has a higher thermal threshold... tho over lapping saying it is radioactive decay as it isn't what it is learning two languages is hard for some that shouldn't know one in the first place. chemistry of purr meow hiss hiss, using manufactured illicit depictions... poop is its own element tomatoes the same of second neutrino seeds a thought of it's beta that thou of what have never seen one fruit make seeds ever. sea water is toxic at it is full of nitrated metallic salts made by nature and the electro static forces in clouds, if one stops burning its nitrates metallic's there is the problem of it chemically locking all the oxygen to the elements after the nitrate makes contact slowly depleting the oxygen supply on earth... various nuclear plants save life by releasing trapped oxygen that plants are incapable of processing. lots of oxygen on mars, it's just trapped to Iron oxide as it used to be iron nitrate but decomposed under its global thermal event... nitrated metallic elements decomposing internally and the constant wash of nitrated water falling into the earth yielded by the polar tug of the moon and the static problems it creates in storms burying all the active carbon biomass, adding to natures electro chemical separation of water to hydrogen and oxygen that is elecroliclly bonded to nitrogen, as to cause more and more hydrogen to float away from the outer solar system and only exists in a shrinking shear around the sun that consumes it in the gravitationally locked production of unreactive helium. yo boi goes around with to many of the other as to he visits the tempol of the sun god of which consumes everything, the earth is falling into the sun! cant you feel how hot it is outside, busy doing nothing but chasing temporary feelings... leave thi place to it's predicted rot.
I hope stable Post Trans-Uranic(PTU) elements can be found and that they are useful.
Netherite is an alloy, I know this is absolutely unnecessary to share as it was a one of joke in a string of fictional elements and my knowledge of this topic is beyond useless
Imaging having the same t-shirt
Islands of stability...   Have they tried putting a message in a magnetic containment bottle, and ...
Well neither is 137 but it’s still a universal constant isn’t it…
Oooh vanderwaals forces lol
One solution to the Fermi paradox is to just wait around for 100 billion years to see how many new civilizations we spot emerging... QED
Omg.. really? You really are being serious.. Okay. But any isotope with enough free energy can be stabilized.. mm Kay? That’s all for today. ❤
Andromeda galaxy DMed me. They have confirmed 1057 more new elements for you to make new YouTube videos with. You can thank the asian who loves mathematics. You’re welcome. 😢
Oh and yes of course ❤ ufonium, iphoniun, galaxium, warpdrivium, and on and on and one for the big nerds like you, unknownium.
Chinesium is my favorite
Pandemonium😂
Element 115?
My theory has always been that nuclei are stars and electrons are planets. Each electron houses advanced ET civilizations. In short, we all are galactic empires. Likewise, our solar system is an atom. A galaxy is a cell. And the filaments on a galactic scale are neurons and brains.
There's got to be something on planetoids, Mercury, Moons... We need better propulsion systems to finally start discovering our own solar system.
Tc has 43 protons, so I guess you meant that items with more than 83 nucleons which is the sum of protons and neutrons in the atomic nuclei.
Thank you so much!
hey whoa whats with the philosophy towards the end that threw me off lol. most of my educational background is in stem but im a phil student now, nice to see im not the odd one out.
All the knowledge we have about elements comes from our own solar system or specifically the star that died in order to create our solar system so who knows maybe a much bigger stars might just have a thousand undiscovered elements.
new materials? no, nuclear explosion. *nuclear hissing can be heard in the background before everything goes white*
We would be foolish to think there are no more elements.
Graph looks like it wants to be logarithmic. This suggests stable elements are off to the right with more neutrons than protons. This is backed further by the discrepancy between the magical numbers(126/114 & 184/126).
Great video.
Casey Affleck is now hosting science channel? Nice. 👍🏻
Di-lithium exists
Missed out on Obamium on the intro :P
The part about the elements was wonderfully explained.
Stalinium's properties is kept in zah sekrit dokuments.
Is it possible that some of these unstable elements could exist in a black hole?
Let’s see if we can discover GTA 6 first... that the real question.
Orichalcum? That one's real; we're pretty sure it was brass (bronze made with zinc ore).
I believe in element 115
No, they are still undiscovered Adobe applications.
Yes, my periodic table had empty boxes. Thus meaning it’s missing some stuff.
Apart from being really dense, are there any other properties of these elements that we can be confident about?
There is the element RT found in democrats brains. Its called retardium.
Elements exist in additional dimensions we cannot know. Does an Ant know about helium? No of course not. We are but Ants on our Ant mound.
Yes.
I have feelings other being have manage to make these heavier elements stable, how else can they build what they do!
Veritasium! The element of truth.
Of course there is! There are elements that only exist for a fraction of a second then disappear!
Of course elements exist that aren’t on the periodic table. We keep finding new ones like Tennessine in 2010
I didn’t know we were in the Silicon Age
Orichalcum was an ancient alloy though.
I wounded if black holes is one big ass element
This guy keeps bumping his mic, causing a low bassy bump noise in my headphones every once in a while and its driving me nuts
There are probably quite a lot of elements we have yet to discover in this universe, we have seen a whole lot of new ones just in the last few years
This channel is legitimately great.
element + element = new element
0:08 hold one of your ideal horses stand by because where is ETERNIUM? (from Black Adam)
Have i been pronouncing Technetium wrong all these years? Teqkneesheeuum
How could he forget to mention Vibranium in the beginning?
So how *do* we reach that island of stability? I get that today's tech can't slam big stuff into each other to create these elements but how much effort would it take? Are we talking CERN but 50% larger or is it actually orders of magnitude in which case how do we go about it? Or is it a computing puzzle, like how to slam 4 or 5 things together at the same instant with an output of element [x] ?
My question would be does Tc 96 have properties that are useful,  if not then it's not worth figuring out.
Yes, but they exist in nutron stars or other extreme conditions that exist temporarily as mater is compressed prior to entering the event horizon of a black hole.
how did we get all them elements if we all came from an exploding nothing? think about it... we didnt evolve no such thing as billions and billions of years old
Netherite
Cool that we are apparently up to a buck eighteen. The first time I had heard of lab created heavy elements, the max people had done, and barely detected was 111 or 112. Very interesting stuff. Thanks for the vid!
Event horizon has all the larger stables bc the gravitational pull would alter the EM forces
Space is racist. Now bow down to me.
Moire pattern 2d graphene electron manipulation: pseudoplutelectronium
You are trying way too hard to make heavy elements seem useful. The fact is most of the artificial elements are completely useless besides occupying a square on the periodic table.
Bro when I was in high school, in the '60s that chart had a lot of empty spaces. AND the atomic particles were the proton, neutron & electron.
Star Trek, Harry Potter, LOTR, and atomic science. This man has a handle on everything.
Are there elements that contain stuff in their nuclei other than nucleons? What particles other than protons and neutrons could theoretically be part of a nucleus?  …..perhaps even a stable nucleus?
Any chance of finding out where you got that tshirt? I know a couple kids that would go nuts for it!
Yes.
Actually there are, the best example is the element 115 which was mensioned by Bob Lazar who's story about alien craft and our military's interest in reverse engineering such crafts became partially true a few years later when element 115 was discovered by chemists working in the field. So yes, these elements do exist somewhere in the universe whether in stable form or not.
Yes
If the Periodic Table continues to another level, wouldn't there be a completely new series and new shell of electrons with unknown chemistry?
0:20 and he forgets Vibranium 😂😂
Live thid video! IF you liked this video I recommend you bobbybroccoli’s video “how a man faked an element” or something like that haha. But these videos compliment each other perfectly
I am fairly settled with the idea that: "If the earth were 10% more massive the climate would be much more consistent and avoided some of the mass extinctions"? The trade-off would be more volcanic activity. What else?
stabilization of atomic nuclei is an interesting topic to think about.  The solution is probably simple, but we can't see it.  I would say that the problem is because we are doing tests on the surface of the planet.  We know about gravitational forces and magnetic poles that protect us.  However, they have a great influence on all the elements we observe.
Absolutely love that you spend so much time going thru comments.
I think I read somewhere that the island of stability is a moving frontier. A few years back, it was expected that elements above 115 or 116 would be found to be a bit more stable than the ones before, as they would be the "shore" of the island. Now that we are up to 118 with each new element being less and less stable, the island is predicted to be further away...
I wouldn’t think netherite  it’s an element it’s more of a alloy
Ooo
Plenty were discovered in the seventies, they just didnt get realized til later. SHIVA project in New Mexico, short lived but extended elemental awareness without actually being capable of understanding the full bonds at the time. The bonds are why we have Cern now, and the continued theme name with it, explained away with nonsense to cover up its existence in the past. The full list of elements discovered were slowly finalized and forwarded into the "known elements" over time, but they were named and found, in the seventies.
this channel is awesome
Moscovium (115) is my favourite! :)
There are also other interesting questions within the periodic table. For instance, are there periodic tables for "pseudo-elements" like nuclei with muons instead of electrons?
this video was 100% inspired by Bobby Broccoli's latest video hehe
YES.  There have been elements discovered since the 1980's. Element 115 was predicted long before it was discovered.
Netherite could exist... My theory is A. Debris is a very compressed rock deep down in the mantle. It could be a super hardened gem, rock or ingot. It could also require heavy mining and heating or shaping to get Netherite. Since Au (gold) is needed for a netherite ingot, it may get a bit stronger in its ingot form. You can change my mind in the replies.
Without watchig the video, yes there might be and probably is elements not recorded in the peridic table. There are some synthetic elements made by humans.  Beyond the periodic table, probably no. Then you would be describing an alloy or a molecule or smth. Or possibly an isotope of some element.  edit: Will give a second tought after watching the video (if I understand it)
Bob Lazar, element 115
I have been fascinated with the Island of Stability for a long time, it is pleasant to see someone else go down the rabbit hole.
Nice to see subshells in this!
There's theoretically an unlimited number of elements that could exist.
4:11 Shouldn't this be 231Th?
It's possible that they aren't elements per say, but that they could be compounds
Really interesting information. The video is only spoilt by the speaker shifting from centre to side to centre to side, etc which is very distracting.
Period Ah and Period Ugh were discovered in 2022
With how unimaginably big the universe is there's not a scenario in which there wouldn't be a possibility of new elements out there the universe is too big there will always always be something else out there for us to discover if you think that that's a fallacy then you my friend don't know the true vastness and wonders of space
The fact Mendeleiev didn't see Obamium coming... Says a lot
19:35 So the Prime Directive starts to make sense.
Imagine if we find an element that could absorb radiation! That would be awesome.
netherite ingots arent actually elements, because it is an alloy of gold and netherite scrap
Is it possible, looking at the graph, that stability goes parapoblic?
I got so lost after 10 minutes lol
Isn't that all isotopes of all elements are really unstable because of uncertainty principle and tunnelling effect and stuff? Emitting of a hydrogen atom should always be an option.
If one subscribes to non-inverse-square gravity as the primary explanation of the dark matter effect, then does the strong force also alter itself based on geometry?
it would be interesting to see if some of the unstable high-end elements could mix into a stable alloy...
bro be rocking the minecraft periodic table shirt
Wonder when they're going to get a new host for space time... can't stand this dudes voice and manurisms makes me not want to watch even though I want to watch.
Isn't orichalcum a real alloy though? 🤔 serious question..
Long way of saying the models are wrong
Probably a large number of them.
What about Draconium and Naquadah?
I need that T-shirt
Sugdenium would be an halogen.
Ha 0.69
why do people talk with their hands moving ?
I wonder....how hard would "neutronium" be?
Yup.
The one element that prevents things from getting done is administratium.
If I recall correctly, Unobtainium isn't an element, it's a particular mineral mixture - rare earth minerals, which is ridiculously expensive due to its value in industry.
Just gonna throw it out there, mithrill isn't a fictional element, it's a steal/silver aloy   And orichalcum is also real, it was first mentioned in ancient Greece but was discovered around 2015
Where are you Glenn Sugden
Correction here: elements 119+ have not been discovered yet because their predicted production rates are far lower than the elements preceding them. Element 119 should have a lifetime very close to element 118, and elements 120-121 should have half lives above 1 microsecond, long enough to observe in current experimental setups.
studying physics: 😐😄  studying physics to build bombs and also knowing chemistry to sell meth: 🤩🗿
Yes! We just have to wait for the next generation of stars to detonate.
The element of pain-Ohio
wait the magic number repeartition  ,kinda remember me prime number not as in the ame repartition , jsut the same kind of repartion   or my brain creating pattern taht don't exist
of course there are more elements. Lots More!
short answer: yes
The USA military no doubt has found them all for research purposes.
So did we discover one by the end of the video? 🤣
I find the lack of Naquadah mentioned disturbing.
I'm waiting for Ununenium, element 119. Symbol Uue, that's hilarious
I meaaaan, netherite isnt an element, it's very clearly at the very least an alloy of gold on something else  And even netherite scraps arent elemental, based on bedrocks chemistry mode
Just to speculate, it would be enormously beneficial to find an element that would help cost effectively catalyze the CO2 molecule into its constituent elements.
Computer parts used to track and record
Take everything documented 50% accurate , 3 times more going in then on document, I left their learning curve fast
3d box out of the tables already giving you directions to research with electricity now , is a chemical and a mass and energy
Maybe reaching that island of stability one day will enable us to advance our technology far beyond what's possible today
I love your video..  promise I leaned and understood more of this topic than several years of chemistry classes
Eh, the universe is not homogeneous it's heterogeneous you can see this even in our lited sample size here on earth. We will fiind other elements as science allows.  Early, Concurrent, or Late is equally college pontificating.   Until someone discovers a functional FTL drive or red shift is proven wildly wrong all three options are equal. Personally I hope for FTL because if red shift is proven wrong and the next planet is not 73k years away but instead just seventy? There will be idiots leaving in generation ships before the ink is dry.
I love that out of all things Netherite was included.
the universe was so small that it was the size of a atom so it was an element
I sreched for this topic for years now it's came to my recommendation
how dare are they not including vibranium 0:01
in a game called subnautica, the alien structures that we as the player discovers, are made of a materiel that is currently unknown according to our periodic table as said by the player's Personal Digital Assistant or PDA, maybe the creators of the game are on to something with this unknown element that they most likely made up.
Great timing!  I had this same exact question in mind less than a day before this video was released.
yes, there are.
Bro forgot Australium
Good IQ question: [2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126] - what's next? The best approximation people have got is the n > 3 part of A162626 sequence, saying "184". However, this sequence part, when n > 3: n*(n**2+5)/3, only coincides with [28, 50, 82, 126], but not with [2, 8, 20]. It would be fun to find a mathematical sequence that coincides with [2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126] without resorting to a separate formula for each part.
It's so lame how everything is made of the same stuffs, like come on why can't there be a cool super metal specific to some planets or smthn
As a Lord of the Rings fan i loved when you mentioned Mithril!❤😌
Technically there are unlimited elements they just aren't stable
The decay difference in technetium might mean they pass through a full set of 'safe' lock combinations so one comes up more often triggering decay, while the other less often,
I need that shirt
13:01 Nice. God is playing with us.
Do some elements exist that have a hole in their electron shell that will fit smaller elements? Looking like a larger mass element but is a hidden element 'molecule'?
Not sure it's been mentioned yet... but Technetium 99m (Tc99m) is used in medical imagining in Nuclear Medicine. It has a half-life of 6 hours and is combined with different products to image various organs. Pretty cool, and that's what I do! Serious! He mentions it later in vid, but the scans shown are CT or MRI scans not NM scans.
where did you get the t-shirt?
in the periodic table at 5:27 bismouth is higlighted, doesn’t it have a huge like insanely long half life
I'm actually more interested in the possibility of the so-called stable SUPER-Elements. That is, elements with atomic numbers such as 157 or more, or thereabouts.
@17:02 Its similar logic to the recent Powerball lottery. We had the same discussion in our breakroom over the chances of winning. He contended that my chances were basically zero. I agreed wholeheartedly, I conceded that even selecting multiple numbers as I did would make a mathematically insignificant increase to my chances. I said to him, but then someone eventually always wins the jackpot. What do you say to their zero chance? Or the zero chances of all the previous winners? Are we cosmic lotto winners? The outlier to the group of losers who won't get out of bed for possibly a few more billion years?
The answer is yes. Because science is always lacking absolute truth. As long as you KNOW something, you know nothing. All "credible" information is authoritative in nature. All "evidence" is perceived and asserted, but in no way proves or disproves any theory. There will never be more elements until there are. And those who assert them in the most credible form, given their perceived authority in the scientific community, will add them to the table. That IS the human thought process.
Honestly, the Silicon Age sounds better than the Information Age, because info is endless and we haven't mastered it. Sure, we've reached a point in technology where attaining info has grown exponentially, but then what is every age after this one if we accomplish mastering all information? Singularity Age? lol
This is an interesting approach to understanding the Periodic Table of the Elements by Dr Robert Moon.     https://www.cosmic-core.org/free/article-131-atomic-chemistry-part-2-periodic-table-of-elements-dr-robert-moon/
Would it be theoretically be possible to create an Atom with 3 proton and just one electron shell?
The Element Ligma is still the best one
The limit is probably a proton+neutron star. The star itself can be a one single atom. If blackhole singularities are considered, then they’re the heaviest. They don’t not have their own protons for us to observe but the singularity contains lots of it
Perhaps an atom of hope?
Isn't the island of stability a big part of the Bob Lazar conspiracy theories? I believe Bob claimed that one of those island of stability elements is key in antigravity for some reason.
eyond The Periodic
OG 69
It is arrogance to believe ALL has been discovered or theorized!
"Where it [Plutonium] becomes a critical part of the process in certain reactor types." I get that it's not always kosher to mention, but let's not beat around the bush here. Plutonium's contribution to the course of human history is in being weapon material. Without Plutonium enabling the production of thousands of nuclear warheads and the recognition of an unwinnable stalemate between two major powers, 1950-1989 would have played out very differently. I guess technically an atomic bomb is a _type_ of "reactor," if you want to spin it that way...
Of course its possible for there to be elements that are not on the periodic table. Look at iridium, brought to Earth by the asteroid that marks the K/T boundary. It despoited all of the world's iridium in that one event, it did not exist here before that. Were it not for that asteroid then science would have no idea iridium exists. But it clearly does, just elsewhere. It'd be imbecelic to believe that iridium is the only element in existance that doesnt exist on earth.
Great! Really great video! Thank you for explaining more of the periodic table. I don’t think much about it, but it’s components are our existence.
You forgot vibranium♨️
What is the last element?!
How about veritasium? An element of truth.
Vibranium❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
You forgot vibranium
I pray someone would call one of those super heavy stable elements Naquadah.
you should define your reference class as "uashambled to engage in phlosophical wankery in public"
At the end of the current periodic table the elements break apart very rapidly indeed.
Have you heard the story of the island made entirely of rare and wondrous things that exists somewhere out there beyond the farthest crumbling vestiges of the outposts of the ancient dogma and the most remote reaches of the known? It is a periodic fable.
I was interested to hear C14 decays to N, silly thought is it possible to convert the C in CO2 to carbon 14, so that it decayes to N & O, although it takes 5000+ years. May be a way to speed it up? AS you have guest I am not a chemist.
Are there any candidates for a natural process which is powerful enough to produces and reach this island of stability for example: the super heated accretion disk of a black hole. and if so why haven't any telescope or observatories detected them.
It Mendeleev, not Mendelev
Isn't it possible that most much heavier elements may only be possible with a particular nuclear configuration that simply doesn't occur in the randomness of high energy natural fusion or  anything we have yet cooked up? Kind of like nanotechnology is to chemistry. If so it may be possible that they are out there, just extremely rare, or even result only from specific astronomical phenomenon and so just don't exist at all around this part of the universe.
If no one has discovered an element beyond the table, how is it then that one can assume there is an undiscovered element beyond the table?
Insert clapping Shia LaBeouf gif, the comedy material at the end of every video is always witty, but this video made me burst out laughing a few times. When do the tickets for your comedy tour go on sale?
In tech just like in life it's better to be early so you can pick your seat.
I left school in '91 and always remember my Chemistry teacher saying that there are gaps in the table and these elements will be found, or more likely created in the next 20 years
Billy Butcher explaining something science-y
the idea of ancient ruins with super advanced technology is super cool
IMAGINE a future, where we could fully understand (and build ) stable nuclei as big as we'd like to..
I like how you put a video game lore & movie lore.
I've never heard such a dumb question, and to think I used to respect PBS.
3:36 i thought that elements heavier than Iron cannot be fused in the cores of stars but are rather produced  in more violent events like supernovae or neutron star collisions via neutron transmutation
Bolonium is what you make sandwiches of for children so they become Captain Atom.
How would you classify gravity influencing elements?
why are there 2 "Stars"  on the periotic table  ( * ) ?
I have wondered about this. If there's elements just beyond our reach, or even a twisted version of The Periodic Table that would look strange at first, but may allow us to do weird and wonderful things. That's most likely sci-fi or fantasy but still a cool thought.  Has anyone made a chart of the unstable elements to see if there's a pattern in there?
if nothing can truly go faster than the speed of light.. it is possible for thousands of advanced civilizations to be coexisting and never actually know about each other... because even reaching 99.9% would allow for thousands of light-years between them and still have more room to spare... obviously the odds of two being right next to each other are just as high as having thousands between... and the light that might be carrying their messages will only get to us thousands of years after they possibly self-destructed or burnt out.
This universe is a sim.  And what goes on in it is the result of the underlying sim programming code.
one of these days we need to name a new element vibranium
I've always found stuff like this very very interesting although i'm not remotely smart enough to understand anything in this video :D.
Uranium is named after Uranus.  "Uranus is a gas giant." ---Albert Einstein
3:49 Um you have no clue how to pronounce detritus...
phagium will be the element named after this guy.
Element 119 radioactive isotope;  fissible in small amounts and with less complex equipment making it feasible for use as an energy source to railgun technology and small scale jet packs for long distance traveling. Perhaps even powering our houses internally even.
DUHHHHH! The Bible makes it clear there will always be newer, deeper and never ending unanswered questions so obviously "science", to sum up man's claimed knowledge gained thus far into 1 title is and never will be set in stone. Go ahead I suppose and make a permanent plaque on any scientific fact because really that monument is more a challenge that will most certainly be toppled! Granted it may not be in our lol lifetime but once enough folk continue thinking outside the forced and manipulated mainstream the chances grow exponentially for reason to birth ever brighter ideas that feed healthy thinking that in turn shines light on more solid facts than the prior could ever conceive.
Element 115 (one fifteen)!
I was just thinking about this today, Google's getting kinda scary with its recommendations
The Periodic table is Infinite
No matter what's going on, Spacetime always raises my spirits. It's a showcase of the best humans making the species better.
Brown element in my pants after I fard?
Wait a minute.. at 9:25 those particles are spinning in the same direction.
What's theoretically the strongest possible material? Other than like neutronuim ig. Strongest atomic material, as in still made of atoms.
Awesome video, got me thinking about new elements! Very appreciated. Also I have a question.  What's theoretically the strongest possible material? Other than like neutronuim ig. Strongest atomic material, as in still made of atoms.
The idea that the first lifeform on the planet was our ancestors because if we were the second, then the first would have eaten us is flawed.  Why?  It is VERY possible for there to be no end of prior lifeforms, and that all of those died out - going extinct before it got large enough to even see in the fossil record.  Their detritus would have littered the planet with the 'trash' of evolution, and over time, altered the chemical makeup of the planet to allow our ancestors to begin.  By that measure, the normal track for evolution is actually extinction.  Consider the oxygen extinction event we know DID happen, and also, the extinction event that happened in the Cretaceous, it may well be we've plenty of evidence that extinction is the 'normal' track for evolution.  The ones that survive are the oddities....
Its in the spin.
Yes. End of video. Elements are theorized beyond the table but yet can’t be synthesized
I'm relieved I've been pronouncing Technetium correctly... although I've heard it pronounced tek-nee-shum.
2030: Ok guys we’ve discovered vibranium
Yes, clearly we can't have every single element.
Atomic weights always confused me because of their fractional nature.  It would be nice if teachers would explain that it reflects the average of the isotopes most commonly found in nature.
I like how the stone age and the silicon age are basically the same elements. It's fitting to be moving forward and backward at the same time, given the human behaviour we see on the internet.
The element of human decency
16:27 it glows violet? Violet isn’t in the spectrum 😮 it’s blue and red with extra blue
Teckneeshium
Element 115 (Call of Duty).
Okay but what about Vibranium 🤔
Could it just be around older or different types of stars?
Elerium 115!
Maybe instead of synthesizing these elements, we could attempt to discover them being created by supernovae or something.
Ah, the island of stability.  I hope nobody gets stranded there.  It remains undiscovered.
Love the mention of Element Zero - Eezo! I'm replaying the Mass Effect trilogy literally right now.
The timing of this video is SO perfect - I just covered isotopes, the gold foil in experiment etc in physics yesterday
I wonder if we will discover new elements when fusion reactors become mainstream and someone experiments with it since the internal temperature will be few times higher than the sun's core even though at much less pressure
What school / course would I need to attend to partake in bleeding-edge physics? My mind craves for answers, and access to the high-energy scientific facilities will help curb the itch
All I’m gonna say is we only know what we what we have discovered, just cause we haven’t discovered it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.
what a stupid title - the answer is yes, next video
ъЪ
Is it possible that other quarks can form nucleons, forming a completely different element? Or an element made of antiparticles? That would be cool...
13:02 half life of 0.69ms  Nice
you misprnounced technetium
You missed kyberite and vibranium.
Bob lazar said element 115 was a thing decades ago
Would you be able to do a video on the Continent of Stability hypothesis & up-down quark matter?
Element 115 (Moscovium 299) is the island of stability.
When the atoms get heavier, spontaneous fission is more of a possibility.  The island of stability may be a mere illusion.
Isn't our age called the glass age?
Sailors fighting in the dance hall oh man, look at those cavemen go...
Can we all agree that Tony Stark definitely didn't make a new element in his home made particle accelerator though?
so you just stealing topics from bobby broccoli now ?
What if there are other elements made of dark matter.
Given the half life of the elements, the presentation is   useless.
It's curious we know so many properties of the nucleus/atom but have no sane theory to predict its synthesis apart from some not very general and not that useful guiding principles.  I wonder if we have enough data to feed it to some deep neural net to get a bit more insight and develop a better model for the nucleus.
Well short answer is yes, easy one to look up would be meta molecules (lab created but still something WAY outside the periodic table)
And don't forget "upsidaisium".  Boris and Natasha are still trying to steal it from Rocky and Bullwinkle!
Did they make a new spot for Unobtanium?
Of course someone has thought that "dark matter" could be elements in the "island of stability" especially if they're really stable and possibly undetectable.
Orichalcum is real 😢
Go to gargantua. You'll find it all there
Another excellent video, but you forgot Eternium and Nth metal from DC comics lol featured in the latest Black Adam movie. Anyways subscribed by a fellow aussie. Keep up the good work mate!
5:52 Uranium-238 says hi   (and before anyone blasts me a grammar lesson, yes, I'm aware he said "tend to")
Ego.   Stupid of anyone to PRESUME to know  !!!!!!!    Get a grip. All this... is as a drop of water on the back of creation
There definitely is in my opinion. An endless universe with endless possibilities. We've only discovered elements here and relatively close by. Id guess there are an incredible amount out there considering how different other solar systems are with different kinda of stars etc don't even get me started on other galaxies they could b completely different
Every element after uranium is useless because they disappear too fast.
You mentioned that the mendelev guy was able to succesfully predict properties of undiscovered elements  Similarly, do scientists have any idea what properties those stability island elements could have?
Amazing !
Where's my naquadah?
LOL @ Logo of the game Half Life used vs usage of T½ to designate half-life.
Why cant there be a nucleus that only contains neutrons ?? It would have both the strong and weak force holding it together and no electro replusive force as well.
I have that exact shirt lmao
Yes! @robertedwardgrant and his team has been discovering them.
Netherite Hahahaha
Elerium 115....
Yes in outer space
1:26 Is that really how you Americans pronounce his name? Why not 'Mendele-yev' (Менделеев)?
that description of how to get larger elements reminded me of overclocking late pentiums.
what if some type of superconduction may render those unstable elements into a stable state? imho, if you control the surrounding of a element, it may become stable and usable. it's even possible that this would need a lot of energy i mean a gazillion, and we are not at the needed technological level, not in this moment. imho the next big breaktrough could be energy technology. stronger lasers, magnets, faster speeds etc. (edit): perhaps it's not always faster and stronger the anwser, perhaps soem elements dotn need a lot of energy to be very useful. one thing i could imagine, making a chart, where pressure, temperature, magnetizm, spin speeds etc. wpudl be on thsi chart on each element, to display the differences between them, this way you could perhaps predict the outcome for the new or unstable elements?
He used iron as netherite I’m offended
I was trying to explain this to my family who didn't believe me when I told them there most likely isn't anything undiscovered super element  because of what we have already discovered.  Not being a scientist I was unable to express this properly, now I can just show them this video.
There is strong evidence for life on other realms around all the planets. There are literally 600+ recordings of them communicating through their preferred mental channel, through his voice box. These recordings deserve investigation and verification of their authenticity by the scientific community.  I myself have investigated them. For this reason I can’t get into all these Fermi paradox type thoughts.. as they are based on a false premise.
Yes! An episode on the dark forest hypothesis whichis a similar but different take on the berserker hypothesis. Too late Matt you spilled the beans.
Of course there aren’t, we’ve definitely discovered all there is to know
Only the scientifically challenged would ask such a stupid question!
Yeah. I need another episode dedicated to a fully updated look at atoms and what they're made of and how all the parts magically swirl together.
Current thinking is that probably no new elements are possible and they would collapse and not be able to hold more Neutrons, Protons or electrons..
I have a question. Do particles of the same element have the same structural order as the rest? This might be the problem for unstable elements. If their structural order is not optimal they will disappear.
Excellent choice of shirt for this episode!
Duh, no.. Really? We don't even know how tiny an atom gets.
"These are the only elements of which the news has come to Harvard, there may be many more but they haven''t been discovard"   Sung to the tune of the Major-Generals patter song
Shout out for Half-Life reference ! 😉
i've always wondered about the island of stability!! thanks matt!
We can discover or make elements by adding protons however they breakdown too fast and last milliseconds
As for elements that are not on the table, you mentioned one that had been engineered. Couldn't the rest be engineered or reverse engineered from the properties they should have and the amount of elements needed?
How is a half life of 4.6million years not stable??
Are we early, we could be late. Could be other intelligent life forms thousands if not trillions of light years from different universe's that have become extinct and we are late to the party.
I'm more hyped for the "elements" created not even out of the usual particles, but novel ones, like Muonium.
Sure..We have made some so why couldn't another world have done the same million of years ago?
Oh, I always thought dilithium was a molecule. Maybe composed of two lithium atoms, hence the name di-lithium. 🙂
Nice presentation. Like add a point regarding contrast agents in medical imaging at 14:30. CT brain images were shown. Technetium is not used for computerized Tomography (CT) or MRI. CT uses injected non-ionic iodine (not radioactive) where MRI uses Gadolinium. Technetium 99m is used in Nuclear Medicine not as contrast agents but to actively visualize the organ or tissue it been tagged to. Different biologically- active substances are combined to TC99m to image the skeleton, liver, kidney or even detect infection. TC99M emits gamma rays and low energy electrons. After injection and appropriate time interval, a gamma camera using sodium iodide crystals images the body part. It has a 6 hour half-life.
Vibranium!
This is a great pairing with the BobbyBroccoli episode from a few weeks ago.
The OG element is not OG lol
Great video! Now, if only the host learned how to correctly pronounce "Technetium so people who never heard of it learn how to say it correctly....
3:16 Rhenium is correct, but the subtitles render it incorrectly as Ruthenium.  And several instances of 'Mendelev'.
YouTube literally read my mind. I didn't even Google this. I just thought of it the other day and this ended up on my home page.
Here's me thinking Mithril was just magical aluminum
Mithril only requires 20 defence
3:17 They're all silvery-grey! Except for a couple of outliers.
Ununennium 119 Unbinilium 120
I thought that the “electron shells” explanation had been disproven a long time ago… I want to say quantum mechanics was involved in that.
Do those simulations predict only one island of stability, or there could be more? Or maybe you'd reach a point where elements are so heavy, they'd create black holes?
Could we detect every life form if they were shouting in our faces? Determining when life began requires a definition of life, and ours is likely to be insufficient.
to be short it depends what the universe needs at any given time
yes
The list of usable Periodic table elements reminds me a lot of the list of prime numbers. There is a concentration of prime numbers/usable elements in the lower numbers - then as the numbers get higher the list gets thinner and thinner.   This may be a case of elemental math that we don't understand coinciding to create a prime-esk distribution coupled with a very average or cool star that formed, and nova'd, in our region before us.   Other areas on the galaxy/universe/multiverse might have higher stable elements to be discovered as those areas may have had larger stars go nova.
Of course there are elements  beyond what earthbound man can conceive of, it would be arrogance to assume otherwise.
Not being all whiney but netherite is actually an alloy as you combine the ancient debris (the possible element) and gold to make netherite.
Thank you for sharing
just to add to this, amerithium IS used in one of two types of smoke detectors. arguably the worse type, the alternative being optical ones that can detect smoke faster most of the time
Seems like The Dark Forest solution is inescapable.
ask a blackhole. they probably know
nature has already given us carbon and boron which if we could make into defect free nanotubes would give us fantastically light and strong materials. throw in an actual room temperature (at standard atmospehre) super conductor and what else could a person ask for?
... we've explored less than 4% of space. To think we have everything that COULD exist is tantamount to thinking that since there's not a cod in the glass of water I get out of the lake that cod can't exist in that lake.
What happens if one end of a wormhole passes the event horizon of a black hole large enough for the opening not to be destroyed by tidal forces?
eh this been talked about since 2008 and gone nowhere. imo we should be looking more at muon elements or anti particle elements.
Wouldn’t a 3rd generation star have more complex elements than we have?
The answer is: duh
I think it would be arrogant to claim we as humans have discovered everything. We've come a long way but we're still noobs
Unexpetetanium will be the most unexpected discovery of our lifetime!
Of course they exist, what exists in our universe may not exist in another.
i fogot the carbon rod exposure rate to control nuke reaction create a universal ground pin for space rocket electronics no longer earth based please we can weaponize it  threatening space billionaires plans threat of superior technology over technocracy lol
Yes. Shortest vid ever
netherite irl???
If SETI receives an unambiguous extra-stallar message from aliens and is able to decode the message, and the message would include something resembling the periodic table we use, but in language/symbols, systematics, order and extension those aliens use and are unfamiliar to us. Would we still be able to determine this is the periodic table and could it be used as a rosetta's stone to decypher the rest of the decoded message?  Sending a periodic table, imo, is something that might be most logical to do when making first, but one-sided contact with other beings as physics is universal and the logic behind the periodic system is very understandable.
netherite=gold+tungsten
Can you do a video on element 115
11:10 And why do we need a periodic table of minecraft?
The Periodic Table of Minecraft is a nice touch
What about pazzazium infinianite
In comment to, "What if the big guy always eats the little guy so that's why there's no aliens" I would argue that our purpose as a highly evolved creature which has pulled itself out of the cycle of nature is not to perpetuate that cycle by eating the little guy, but instead the star trek solution of "We are strong, therefore we have the freedom to protect those weaker than us" rather than, "We are strong, therefore we have the freedom to rid ourselves of parasites."
I HAVE THAT SHIRT!!!!!!! awesome choice!!!!!!
Your numbering of a theoretical 9th period is inaccurate. You forgot to add a period to the intertrasitional metals
12:32 But bismuth and uranium occur naturally.
6:02 That's an interesting theory; that only one element, 121, exists in row 8 below the entire actinide series.
0:43 That's the atomic number you've got up top. It belongs as a subscript, with the mass number (nucleon number) as the superscript.
Neutron stars probably have surface protons, so there are definitely more elements.
The Periodic Table Of Minecraft T-Shirt? Epic.
At least one of the elements in the island of stability will be harder than Tungsten. All these elements will be extremely dense and heavy. Tungsten melts at 3400 C. There will be element that will be solid at that temperature
Are neutron stars considered as isotopes of element zero?
are you stupid asking these questions, our galaxy alone is just a tiny dot, who knows what how big is the universe is, even our perception of reality might be different from  other universes.
12:11 to 12:19 - surely it's not just me who noticed that the statement is applicable to humans too? Some of us seem to be more wired towards happiness whilst some of us have the displeasure of experiencing the opposite effect? Sorta makes sense to me, we're all made of stars after all....
Cool Fact: Netherite is likely to be Platinum, due to the matching properties. This also means that we can call Platinum-Gold Alloy can be called Netherite if you like.
I like to think of the periodic table as an outgoing spiral, not a table.
Like it!
You forgot the most important element for space travel: Elerium 115.
Your Standard Model has a major flaw.  You say "helicity is frame dependent". You have a Lorenz boost to change one helically point to the opposite handed helically point. Did you know, no you don't, that a helix turns inside out to its opposite handed helix. You can fashion a conical helix out of flex wire. Set it on a table and flatten it into a spiral.  Then push it the other way into an opposite handed helix. This fact is not in any math dictionary  yet. I think if someone made lefthanded corkscrews as a novelty they would sell and be educational.
cen you please change this guy. i love the channel and topics but he aint good as others of your hosts
115?
Moscovium is a fuel source to power UAP, allegedly.
Adamantium isn't an element but an alloy, Vibranium would've been more fitting. Ever notice how most of the well known fictional elements are metals?
Just imagine holding an ingot of this heaviest yet undiscovered element. People are already surprised with the weight of gold. It's nigh on impossible to just hold Uranium for an average person, and yet these elements have the potential of being 3-4 times as heavy as those. Imagine a golf ball that weighs 8 lbs / 4 kg. Nutty.
Highly unlikely
No radioactive chemicals used in CT scans. Nuclear medicine uses isotopes
his t-shirt tho :)
Yes like infinite notes on a scale of 🎵🎶 theoretically ♾️ only element's turn into something not called an element.
mega points for mentioning dark forest theory!
There is one logical problem with the island of stability, if there are super heavy stable elements, then we should be able to detect them out there in the universe using things like spectroscopy. There are so many high pressure high energy events that happen out there in the universe that it's likely that the conditions for elements far far beyond our periodic table have happened, it's just that they are unstable and decay. Best place to look for them would be in fresh supernova or star mergers.
I bet even the earliest scientist noticing the gap at 43 knew it was no coincidence that it's a prime number.
What he's Saying: netherite What he's Showing: iron
Those elements if like steel will have some mass
There's probably some crazy elements in the heart of black holes
There aren't any new elements yet to be discovered.
It's my head Canon that netherite is an alloy of tungsten titanium, and for the ingot obviously gold. It explains the lava resistance from tungsten and titanium's high melting points, the armour points from titanium's strength and the knockback resistance from gold's weight.
terraria ores no way!!!!!
People focus too much on elements that could be useful and forget potential new alloys. Then you've got things like semi conductors that changed the world, without the discovery of new elements.
Yeah. Element 115. Duh!
Genuine question - if there is an island of stability, why haven’t we found any of those elements yet?  My understanding was that the reason why not all elements are found in nature is due to their short half life, but if there is an island of stability, then there would need to be another reason why we haven’t found those yet. Not sure if anyone knows but I was just curious.
Bolognium...?hmm I want a sandwich.
Yes, there is the element of "surprise."      Gets me everytime. kekekekekek
God I remember going down this month long rabbit hole when I was like 14, almost a decade ago and I was really hoping we'd come further than this but literally nothing has changed
Americum!
4:23 Technetium actually does exist in nature. It just took long to discover it in nature because it is so rare:  "Technetium occurs naturally in the Earth's crust in minute concentrations of about 0.003 parts per trillion."  It's true that it's unstable and it's half-life is too short that anything from the formation of nthe earth has survived, but:  " However, small amounts exist as spontaneous fission products in uranium ores. A kilogram of uranium contains an estimated 1 nanogram (10−9 g) equivalent to ten trillion atoms of technetium."  All quotes from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium#Occurrence_and_production
My logical mind tells me I need to sleep for work, but my procrastinating self wants to know if there are more elements. As if that's something that will be relevant for me to know.
This is funny, but I made a movie that indicated 4 civilizations had formed and attained super-intelligence (human like) on earth and three had left or been forced off earth. First an Intelligent plant/slug hybrid (240 million years ago), an intelligent dinosaur (60 million ago), then intelligent birds (15 million), and finally intelligent apes. The movie was called The Parchene Conspiracy and was recognized on IMDB when it won an award. Earth was considered a Breeder planet and was quarantined by the Core Empire after each species so other future civilizations could develop. Which means if the pattern continues humans only have about 4 million years to spread out among the stars.
I'm kinda skeptical about this island of stability – there's been a lot of hype, but few results which is worrisome.  Nuclear geometry is important too – not just the numbers of protons and neutrons, but also how they are arranged.  Finally, Lambda particles (uds) may help stabilize super-heavy elements.
Big idea here We're speaking of stuff like protons and neutrons but what if there was stuff beyond that? We could get entirely new periodic tables if we just change the very matter we're using itself
why not just say no, but we can pretend
Why present it as a question. If we knew all the elements we'd be able to explain, easily, what makes-up "space", the three 'known/labeled' types of matter and similar
vibranium
Where does neutronium fit? As a degenerate state of matter?   Setting aside its properties and assuming you could scoop out a stable chunk of it from a neutron star.
To stop Evangelicals, remember to join the Satanic Temple.  Yes, it is a legit religion.
Can’t we just zpinch it up?
if humans represent the first life in the 'universe' i quit
Didn't expect a chemistry refresher. Thanks 😊
can't helped but to comment about the title, LOL. If there are still undiscovered element.? The answer is always true/yes even you felt like there's nothing more to discover.
netherite is an alloy                i see you typing the nerd emoji
New elements are created every time a star explodes.
obviously there must be and therefore are.
The theoretical periodic table at 6:01 is numbered incorrectly 😁
Love the Halflife logo! ....The cake is a lie
AI
from what we know of the island of stability where pretty sure it's still not going to be fully stable, just far more stable and thus far more easy to get high amounts of and keep them for testing, compared to the things before it which can last less than a second before decaying.
While we understand the concept of a half-life (half the atoms in a sample will decay in a specific period of time), has anyone established the mechanism by which one particular atom decays in that time while another atom in the same sample would not?
Everything was fantastic right to the very end! Just make sure to include all aspects of origin not just the imagination of evolution or life coming into existence on its own! That is not science
so isotope is to element, as cultivar is to plant, or breed is to animal?
I'd much rather have an element than a star named after me, as stars are, you know, so COMMON.
You forgot upsidaisium, discovered by Bullwinkle's uncle Dewlop D. Moose.
Short answer: No.  With the discovery of Og (element 118) the periods are full. The next element (#119) would require an additional new shell outside of the two 32-electron shells. It would be a 64-electron shell. But please note that every element above 92 is not naturally occurring and is highly unstable. Most transuranic elements  -- Neptunium and Plutonium being significant exceptions -- exist in a collider for picoseconds or fractions thereof before decaying.   That is because the nuclei are very nearly outside -- or are partially outside -- the limits of the Strong Nuclear Force. The first barbell-shaped pulse throws a significant amount of the nucleus outside the limits of the SNF, resulting in some form of decay.   If there existed a new shell -- which BTW, would make the Periodic table double in width overnight -- the resulting nucleus would be too unstable for us to observe it. It probably couldn't exist at all, because not even a nuclear collider would fit that entire nucleus inside the SNF boundaries.    So, no, there cannot, in any practical terms, exist any element above 118.
There’s a infinite amount of elements
I always assumed Mithril was real life Titanium for some reason
About more neutrons keeping the protons apart -- that's one benefit of more neutrons, but the primary benefit of more neutrons is the attractive nuclear interaction without the repulsive Coulomb interaction.
Yo anyone watch that Bobby Broccoli video on this topic like two weeks ago
How about upsidusium?  As seen in Rocky and Bullwinkle 🙂
If you'd like a glimpse of a scenario about a species that "hides", read the Heechee Saga by Frederik Pohl beginning with Gateway.
How does antimatter function with the periodic table? Is there some kind of antimatter periodic table?
Awesome video and one of my most favorite topics. It's interesting that scientists now believe that there are stability islands very far up the periodic table, so my disdain for any scifi show that includes 'new elements' is mostly just hubris, as advanced societies may actually be able to produce new elements with amazing properties.
Give me neutronium
i love watching his hands while he speaks. idk is that weird
Enjoyed the video from the beginning. However, the bit at the end got my brain tied into knots for moment. Quite amusing, actually. I'd love for us to be the 'wise, benevolent old ones' someday. If only there was a way for us to jump an aeon or two into our future to see what we ultimately become. P.S. I don't know why I'm not subscribed yet.
pfft  Nice little insertion of fermi paradox.   The solution is simple.  The universe is large is both size, and time.  There could be literally trillions of civilisations in a single galaxy.  But due to the distance seperating them, and the time scales that they appear; it would be uncommon for two to actually meet.    The best best is archeology.. but even then youd have to be doing your digs thousands of metres underground; and they would need to have created something durable and large enough to survive long enough at that depth /we/ find the remains.  Even in our OWN history how many civilisations have formed risen and fallen in the last 5000 years alone?  Of those how many have almost no record they existed at all other than a few fluke finds deep in cave systems?  They once found an "alien coin"  (ultimately the concensus is it was a hoax) but the coin was supposedly found in a deep core sample from a drilling rig.   This is the type of evidence we are most likely to find.  So had it not been a hoax: 1: it was a culture that created/collected things 2: It was a culture with a concept of economics and created currency 3: It was a culture that developed a written form of expression 4: It was made out of a material that could last a million years at a deep depth unchanged.  All 4 of these would have to apply for us to even find a coin from a lost civilisation that existed thousands or millions of years ago.
fascinating, once again scale factors prove to be  worthy of study.
You said "space time" lite one says "Grabthar's hammer"
One minor correction: Orichalcum is an alloy of existing metallic elements (though nobody seems able to agree on what its actual composition is).
Can somebody please tell me where or what that short clip at 14:55 is from? I keep seeing it in many science videos for years now.
IBM.m (R&D) created four new elements that have not yet been released. (PEO ll, Esq)
Sooo what is preventing us from Smelting 2 or so super radioactive elements together like folding a sword, and forcing the ingot of that into a reaction?
You forgot Veritasium
Baloneyium has two stable isotopes, delicious and snacktacular.
That part on the end was my favourite! How delightful to hear of all of these paradoxes in such an interested way  :)
Unobtanium ? That sounds like me and the big mega lottery each week.  lol!
Rather than stuck with only classic protons + neutrons approach, perhaps we should try to shove an electrons or two into the nucleii.
considering we added a new element just a few years back (oganesson, 1999) i cant think of any reason we couldnt discover more. maybe not on earth but if something from far space landed here on an asteroid or something it could be anything.
So unstable elements may have relatively stable isotopes.. well there is your plot armour elements for science fiction.  If it takes 5000 years for one isotope, and it has interesting properties.. that could make an interesting exotic material for a sci-fi ship whos productive live in the story may only be 50 to 100 years.
Element 115 is "new"...antigravity warp drive incoming
element walker bush aka element 43. catastrophic element to society!!
Of course, we only know what we currently know.
For us to think all the elements in the universe are here on earth and in our periodic table, is comparable to the church thinking the sun revolves around the earth.   Laughable.
I’ve never heard that pronunciation of technetium, is it standard for Americans?
The year is 2056, and legend has it somewhere in the Yorkshire hills an old man is eagerly waiting for a small but mildly radioactive parcel to arrive. Glen never forgets 😄
Tukerium neg 5, Dangor neg 17, Lu neg 31
The element of disbelief
I enjoyed your information thank you very much
W hy isn't the 5th  spacial dimension incorporated in your calculations? Is this unscientific or something to think about. Will it help in your understanding of everything.
Something I've never seen discussed with the fermi paradox is the speed of light. What if it's the case that any civilization technologically advanced enough to be colonizing planets level of spacefaring has simply deemed it impractical to contact other species because by the time the contact was established the original contacters could be long dead? Like, imagine if in the future humanity was 100% certain we'd found an alien civilization 250 million light years away. Contacting them would still be impossible, not only because we actually wouldn't know if there is an alien civilization there, we only know there WAS one 250 million years ago, but also because by the same feature of spacetime anything we could send would take an additional 250 million years to arrive.
ah see, but netherite is not an element, its an alloy
Human civilisation exists at a time the cycle of a galactic year around our milky way hasn't experienced any catastrophic events the milky way throws at our planet it has to be luck as to why humans thrive and  survive
We give no indications of wanting to embrace wisdom despite all the lip service given it. The large number who want to hurry off to Mars despite the massive risks of contamination...of one of only a few locations in our system likely to have life...shows we're going to always default to manifest destiny. No different than a virus. And very much like a virulent virus.
Brilliant episode, I've always wondered this and how it all works
Adamantium isn't an element. It's a special steel alloy made by the government in Marvel.
Blackhole Densitynium 🤣
Rune armour is best, with a green party hat. 🥳
Why not
97Tc 	{syn.} 	2,6 · 106 a 	ε 	0,320 	97Mo from wikipedia
Also, we skipped a number. It's somewhere between 3 and 7, and all of our counts are off after that number. Scatter some skittles on a table and try counting them. Don't get distracted, the count might change.
I remember watching a UFO investigator stating that aliens are capable of producing stable isotopes of every element across the table
I came here because of the video title but I got bombarded with a heck ton of history lessons
Is there a "road map" to go from atomic elements (containing neutrons, protons and electrons) to things like neutron stars. Is a clump of 100 neutrons without a single proton stable? How many are required to make a stable lump?
So much focus on the nucleus and nucleons, but creating anything beyond 118 will require a further electron shell, which will be prohibitively difficult - at best - to maintain and whose electron properties will challenge the boundaries of known physics. Not saying it can't happen, but the nucleus might not be the problem
Re: The monologue at the end about the empty universe -- It only appears empty to us because we're peering into the deep past every time we look across the universe.  The universe could be teeming with civilizations much like our own, beaming radio signals out into space which we will only receive millions of years from now -- if we're still even around to detect them.  Or we could have missed signals that came and went as earlier beings from across the universe lived and died out.  It seems a large error in logic to take for granted that we are alone.
not me waiting for clues about possible stable isotopes of Moscovium
mendelEEv ! men-de-le-yev
Thanks, and the presenter's name should be prominent. He's a gem.  Also: every atom in the universe, above H has Helium in its core. Similarly, every atom above Fluorine has Neon and Helium in its core, and so on . . . .
I have that same Minecraft shirt.   Love it.
Thanks really for an excellent and informative explanation of what might be just around the corner for modern technology.  It is kind of complex and yet also realisable, but still we have to have an understanding of just how tricky it is to get new elements to be for long enough to even be aware that they exist!!  I am still somewhat confused however about element 43 - technecium - surely if it has an isotope then why would there be none at all. Maybe I need to watch this over again but I just can't quite get my head around it. and I'm supposed to understand physics!   Is it possibly a way to make it using magnetic resonances rather than forcing against the ordinary electronic repulsive forces? You may have already explained that so if I missed it, sorry, but it always seemed to me that "aiming" at the centre of a nuclei isnt the way to go about it, rather it has to "skim" the surface of the atomic in such a way as to avoid the electric, yet still permit the introduced particles to find some way to "adhere" to the particular "centre" of the atom ..... ?
The strong force holding the nucleus together decreases at a higher reciprocal than the 1/r and 1/r^2 of macro forces. As the nucleus gets larger, sone of the occiliatory states allow nucleons to tunnel out. The atoms beyond the current periodic table would have nuclei size beyond what the strong force could stabilize. Q.E.D.
Whats sugondesium
13:34 wait, did you just say millions of years? That’s WAY longer than i expected whenever i heard about the island of stability. I was expecting minutes at most
HALFLIFE 3 CONFIRMED
I see the broccoli boy mountain graph, and I respect the usage cause it’s a good graph and
@5:30 Bismuth should not be highlighted. It does not have more than 83 protons.
The table of the nuclides is a better way of seeing the island of stability. If there is another like say, an archipelago of nuclides/element is probable.. The Germans are searching for it.
Mythrol look like a t-shirt.
The shirt for this episode is spot on!
So when I go in for an MRI, the hospital has to have technetium manufactured and flown in just for me?
It is pronounced Medele-yev.
It’s because it’s not a sphere
Elements beyond uranium or thereabouts are not actually “undiscovered.” Since they do not, to our knowledge, exist in nature, they are not discovered. They are manufactured.
And aliens use element 115 for anti gravity according to UFO researchers at area 51
5th grade in mid 70’s we were required to memorize the periodic table and were told “THIS is everything that everything in made of..” I asked how that was possible and couldn’t there be more we haven’t found yet. Teacher berated me for “questioning” the scientists knowledge and told the class “they are much smarter than all of you..” Always wanted to go back and find that teacher after more and more elements have been added over the years.
It’s all Greek to me
As a chemist, I HAD to watch this video, to see if they screwed it up. They didn't!! It was very well done! In regards to this topic, what I like to think about is not just the properties of this future-element, but the properties that we might discover when we alloy this future-element with other metals. Or when we react this future-element with other organic/ inorganic compounds!! Materials scientists will fawn over the former, while chemists will discover the latter. In the end, this 'future-element' might not even react in any useful ways, but may act as a perfect catalyst for fusion, allowing us to finally realise controlled fusion reactions! Or it may act as a catalyst for producing large amounts of bose-einstein condensates...  There are so many possibilities when discussing a 'new element,' that we don't need to limit the discussion to what its properties might be. It's also important to look at the properties of things it mixes/ reacts with, or the benefits it confers onto other reactions.
Thank you for showing me that neutrons are more than chargeless particles.
The only gripe I have is about the way he says technetium.
Vibranium Half Life matters!  ✊🏿  😂
There probably is undiscovered elements mainly because they don't occur in nature long enough for us to find them.
so mabye its safe to say some of the new ways of us generating power will help us find thoes elements in the island of stability. Mabye a few of them probubaly be found in stars comming from our fision reactors once we have them going really well.
We need to find new elements so that we can finally build a stargate.
You should be a chemistry teacher.  Great vid.
Can nuclear fission and fusion work as a single pendulum like energy generator? Say, starting with Deuterium with lowest atomic number limit and apply so much fusion energy that the nuclear build swings right through Lead and Iron until an upper atomic weight limit into say Polonium until it nuclear decays.   Maybe not to this extreme, or even maybe a fusion sided pendulum and a fission sided pendulum? Like both swinging from their extremes towards Lead and Iron and using the energy from the other to push each other back toward the extreme again.  I'm imagining clocks.
Prism or Lyra
I used to wonder why you couldn't keep adding more protons like how you can always count one number higher
The stable isotopes of super heavy elements may unlock many possibilities, e.g., interstellar travel, that current human beings can only dream of. But I suspect this might be the fate of humanity after all. We are not in a galaxy that’s near to the remnants of large enough stars that would provide these valuable resources for free. This could also be the real answer to the Fermi Paradox. The real treasure in the universe are some stable isotopes of super heavy elements, but we don’t have it here or somewhere near here.
I’m now imagining elements with tens of thousands of protons, and how useful they might be lol
What I find even more interesting than the hunt for stable or at least semi-stable isotopes of elements, is the ensuing scramble to look for explanations of where the science is wrong when they can't find such isotopes.
ever wonder if there are elements before and inbetween the elements in the periodic table?
We are always and will continue to discover and invent................History and science.........as I grow... I hear, " Oh and we had IT wrong"!!..It never ends..NEVER..
AI superintelligence will be able to deduce solutions to these issues much more quickly than humans will be able to.  The first step to the next great leap in human civilization is bringing forth a truly self aware AI intelligence that itself will develop superintelligence, or will pave the way to creating superintelligence.
That kind of raises the question. If stable heavy elements like that could exist, wouldn't they be present on earth and be found already?
there is no Fermi paradox if millions of UFO records are given a probability of one being real
I think there's a element between hydrogen and helium.
Apologists for Bob Lazar say that the discovery of element 115 gives credence to his story that he "worked on" UFOS at Area 51. However, 1. He was *not* the first person to speculate on the existence of 115, as seen in this video. 2. Element 115 is *unlikely* to be the super fuel that powers UFOs.
Every time the intro beat drops I know a great explanation about stuff is headed my way. 🎉
The stability of larger elements comes from the acceleration of the gravity well they reside in.   Without the immense accelerative pressure, they wouldn't hold together.  That's how you eventually get to a neutron star.  The remaining matter is just neutrons packed together simply because of immense gravity.  Gravity wells are the way that matter, starting as hydrogen at the big bang, gets transmuted through progressively deeper gravity wells into denser and denser forms of matter.  Gravity is the recycler of matter back into the pure potential you'd find within a blackhole
Yes - Ive been waiting for this subject!
This was a little elementary.  😊
The dude who came up with the periodic table of elements had the Aether as an element. I think the Luminiferous Aether is Light and everything including empty space is made of it. We are all elements (light) in a Matrix.
Can quantum physics somehow allow those “quark packets” (mazons) to reach other nucleons that are farther away, giving access to otherwise-impossible elements? I wonder if that’s similar to how neutron stars work… 👀
16:37 about the "grabby aliens" idea... Maybe it does not matter if we humans are "early" or not. Perhaps the leaps necessary to find other advanced life are so dangerous on different levels that life generally dies out *before* that point in its evolution. Or the surviving life that reach a point of detecting or meeting other life forms either no longer interact with species below their evolution or start exploring other things we can not presently, like multidementional space-time or building their own "universe". Kinda as if aliens" are out there colonizing at such vast distance in time and space that we can not detect. Or they do not care about life like us and have moved on to things we do not yet know or understand. These are things also we have explored in science fiction stories over the years. Arthur C Clarke and Gene Roddenberry helped inspire my fascination in this area.
When periodic table was "figured out" - there was much less elements, so why not.
There won't be any star-fairing future. We are trapped here on earth.
Of course. Move on.
Did he say bolognaium? Cool!!
The periodic table was a lot easier to remember when it was just Earth, wind, fire and water
As a merried man an unkown element is Sexium.
We need to invent replicators to do that.
How much energy would it take to produce the elements within the Island of stability?  Would it be feasible on earth?  Could we do it if we build factories in close proximity of the sun to harness that energy.
Great! But in a distant future maybe the scientists will find a way to fold somehow the space between protons and neutrons and to be able to embed in nucleus structure anti protons or anti neutrons... in a stable way, of course... in this case the chemical elements which could emerge will be thousands... A new era will start in those future times... please, if someone reads so far this dream maybe will be enough benevolent to look to my timid movie made in “manim”... the channel is on the beginning and on YT is very difficult to increase when you are small. Help Gina (my virtual creative pet robot) to create more by pressing this link: https://youtu.be/QtVImcr4g0U
I reckon I create new elements when I drop my cheese sandwich on the counter top which has rogue sugar granules in it. I can't give you an atomic number as yet... but they sure taste strange.
Ofcourse there are, a new element is just extra protons in the nucleus, main issue is stability at very high atomic number, however our ideas of stability is based on our familiar environmental conditions which are just local conditions. What kind of exotic elements might exist on a neutron star or inside a star, etc.
If we were able travel to other planets with ease im sure we’d find many other elements out there.
I'm hoping that island is there.
technically the answer is yes  the best kind of answer
Ofcourse , 95% ocean is still undiscovered.
Great explanation! I was able to follow even though I don't know much about the topic
Nuclear pairing interactions looked like the earth on its rotation
So... Is it possible for a stable isotope of element 115 to also exist? And, if yes, is it gonna be possible to be discovered soon by us?
Sheeesh  ..this guy makes an interesting subject boring
Unprofessional lighting on the science guy
Try Dilithium - used in Federation Warp Engines although it may be a compound since it is a crystal
Why do most scientists think they make good presenters ?   ..they should hire professional actors to present the information
How cool would it be if one of those elements could survive solar temperatures. I want a sun house.
6:00 Ooooh, that irks me... 121 to 135 should be below the actinide series.
I don't really think we can create more elements, since they would be SIGNIFICANTLY hard. If we even do, after element 137, (you know where I'm going) creating more might be impossible, since the speed of electrons in the inner K shell (more specifically, 1s subshell) is roughly Z/137 times the speed of light. Hence, elements 138 and more hypothetically cannot exist as those inner electrons would surpass the speed of light. Though, there might be a chance since Quantum Physics and General Relativity are not properly linked yet, if they do, we could surpass this barrier, but for now, I don't really think with our current model, we can produce more elements.
my reasoning on any "new" elements are that they are probably too unstable to exist in "common" environments so we probably would not encounter them unless we go into black holes or in the middle of the sun... or maybe the opposite, a place so far from "space" that there is no energy, no neutrons, light or neutrinos, where 0 kelvin truly exists.
Only if you are Bob Lazar.
I just posted a 2 min video no scientist understands, "spiritual hippos" I authored 2 books about the footage.
The dark forest, African and their descendants still remember that one
Expect to find the element of surprise.
*Makes element from island of stability*  *new universe explodes in our faces*
I could see a very dense (but perhaps mildly radioactive), being useful in the manufacturing space, similar to how we use thoriated tungsten in the welding space, and naturally, if such elements were very hard as such, this could be useful for the machining of similarly hard materials that would otherwise be unmachinable in current conventional methods.
I'm pretty sure you're mistaking Tshirtium for Mithrol. Correct yourself genius, and don't do it again! 😄😁
What was the significance of the colours in the graphs (orange, yellow, blue, green, purple, etc)?
BRO ! What sort of role-call of Sci-Fi elements could that be, and yet you totally missed out on the Grandfather of them, Inoson, not to mention Scrith  :)
what about vibranium :)
Only one highly intelligent life on earth.  All other intelligent 'monkeys' were a threat and killed  ,???????
pure bullsheet  society
5:55 Shouldn't elements 121 through 135 be under the actinides, with elements 136 through 150 continuing below rutherfordium through oganesson?
only a scientific coward would  leave out a mention of  bob lazars  claims
Alien spaceships are powered with moscovium.
This came right as I was learning this in Chemistry class, amazing
you explain very well, thank you
PLEASE DON’T MAKE SCHOOL EVEN HARDER FOR US
4:52 When a neutron turns into a proton, in β- decay, the nucleus emits an electron and an antineutrino, not a neutrino
This guy does not know about Ob, Obamium
This channel doesn't even show up in my feed! Let alone notifications.... That's fcked up!
Unstable, on earth’s unique conditions… in all other areas of space and universe, these isotopes might be more common than our version of “stable” elements
You forgot to mention the Vibranium found in Wakanda
Do a video on Lyman break galaxies.
Random Thoughts I studied Organic Chemistry (OC) to get my biology degrees and I got to where I liked OC. Your search into the weeds of how certain elements used to exist, but decayed before we got here.  It doesn't explain anything if it explains everything. I ran into that in OC where they were confident they'd figure out how Life makes all these organic compounds and how they discovered how to make insulin without needing herds of animals. Soon synthetic insulin would be cheap. Well we still do not know how to create insulin, we just used recombinant DNA and put the insulin genes into bacteria or yeast and the living organism makes the insulin, but it is cheap and only cost $10 to make a month's supply they charge $300 for.  Using isotopes that are not hard to make, but they charge 1000x more for it if it goes to the medical field's use isn't what some scientists spent their lives finding out how were about. I listen to the hype from abiogenesis labs and read the papers and it is no further along than 1952,  but they must hype it up or they won't get funded. Seriously and computer models of how life can form do not apply unless it can be demonstrated. Time to stop doing biology with outdated assumptions, life was engineered that is why everything has the same DNA. It is the best system to convey the information needed for the bio-form. No one ever mentions where the information came from to assemble something we cannot do in a lab let alone in a natural setting.
i think i see your problem . . . you're out of phlogiston.
there is no element which undiscovered.
In the words of Marty McFly, "Wow! This is heavy, doc."
No, there are not.  All transuranic elements are created, not naturally occurring.  Your topic is not a relevant topic.
Discovered in early atomic bomb tests, invisibellum has not been seen since.
At about 5 minutes and 12 seconds in this video you mentioned that nitrogen can change into carbon 14 due to cosmetic rays hitting the atmosphere. If I remember correctly Venus has a very dense nitrogen atmosphere. How much energy would it take to convert enough of the nitrogen to carbon 14  and could it then somehow be bombarded with protons and further convert some of that to oxygen stabilizing the resulting element? I suppose you would need a butt ton of energy and would have to localize the initial conversion so you could focus on the carbon 14 before it would dilute into the remaining nitrogen assuming the carbon 14 did not coalesce into large clumps. Yeah, didn’t seem feasible, but maybe....
Better us than them.
Latinum and Fantasteel also
1:25 It's pronounced rather "mendelLAY-JEF" ☝️🤓
Strange and charming elements?
Absolutely brilliant, wow.  So much wisdom and insight.  Incredible.
5:59 that's not how they would be numbered
At 3:15 the subtitles don't match the dialogue. Rhenium or ruthenium?
All the elements we can’t find are living in another realm it is like it separates us from that different realm
I remember Neil deGrasse Tyson poetically describing why hypothetical elements are not as cool as the ones we have, he said something like "...think about water, hydrogen is a gas that is flammable, oxygen is a gas that feeds fire, but when the two combine they create liquid water, a non-gas, and the primary thing we use to stop a fire."  118 known elements, 28 synthetic and  90 naturally found on Earth.  Granted not all can combine perfectly, but starting with number of objects n = 118 and sample size r = 1,2,3,4,5....the possible combinations with properties we don't know yet increases dramatically...r=1 (118), r=2 (7021), r=3 (280,840), r=4 (8,495,410), r=5 (278,288,004).  Just saying, that new elements might be a little out of our reach at the moment, so maybe we should focus on what's in front of us now?
Great episode! Unlike others ones, I, kind of, understand. This episode should have been made long ago, thanks anyway. Thank you for a fantastic series Matt.
"The Ancient Ones" I'll take that, sounds cooler than what I am.
People already call me an Old One, so we don't need to wait for a subsequent re-emergence of civilization for that.  My back hurts.  I dunno how much this tells us about future civilizations, except that no time travelers have come back to fix my back.
You forgot vibranium!!
What will be the cost per kg ?
I am curious as to why gravity is considered the weakest of the forces. If the strong nuclear force has trouble holding a nucleus together when they get too big then why is that considered a stronger force than gravity when gravity has the ability to  effect 2 or more bodies of enormous masses, ie sun and earth, at distances of many millions of miles or even greater, billions, when we look at pluto and the sun? This becomes even more odd when you consider galaxies with hundreds of billions of stars and their associated planets and moons etc. May be a stupid question but...
Tek-NEE-shee-um. It's tek-NEE-shee-um.  It is used every day all around the world in nuclear medicine diagnostic tests, as mentioned. Except that first diagnostic scan shown is an MRI, and technetium is not used in MR imaging (that would be gadolinium.) Then we see a CT scanner and a stack of CT images - but CT doesn't use technetium either (it's iodine.)  :)
tek-NEESH-ee-um. It's tek-NEESH-ee-um.  It is used every day all around the world in nuclear medicine diagnostic tests, as mentioned. Except that first diagnostic scan shown is an MRI, and technetium is not used in MR imaging (that would be gadolinium.) Then we see a CT scanner and a stack of CT images - but CT doesn't use technetium either!  :)
I zoned out - it was too difficult for me. But congrats bringing high quality content to YouTube 👍👍
Baloney-yum.
I've always thought Mithril, Orichalcum and such were alloys, akin to the relationship between Iron and Steel. That Mithril may be an alloy of lithium,, beryllium, scandium, etc.
...And the elusive "Jethro Bodineium"
Mythril is deffinitely an alloy
Blazzmonite!  It's my favorite, because I discovered it.😑🧐
Look if we evolve to the point of 'god-hood' that could be a bad thing. I know what DnD character I would be, and that is both not good, but isn't bad either. It is all perspective.
Netherite is actually a alloy of gold and platinium.
I am offended you didn't mention Naquadah!
Actually, "dilithium" isn't a fictional element.  It's a fictional isotope of an actual element, lithium.
Isn't adamantium an alloy, and iron-based at that?
Would it be possible to combust or fuse super unstable elements? Given an injector and technology that could synthesize an unstable element inject it into a chamber to fuse / combust this element to release energy. could the reaction happen before its first half-life?
If we are the old ones then can we please just cure the necrontyr of cancer.
No upsidasium?
if i could name an element i would call it ,,ligma"
Such a fantastic insight! Ill have to read up on the island of stability, it's a fascinating insight
Vibranium from MCU
Is it true that in different solar systems, different atoms are considered "stable"? For example, a solar system with unique gravity and ion combination that allows technetium to be stable, but in order to get molybdenum, you have to refine technetium?
Any quantitative phenomena that has clear hard numbers that we can attach to it, like Half-Life and Decay modes versus proton and neutron number can be used as a data set for machine learning. I wonder if we could put in a few thousand known isotopes and use machine learning to actually create a deeper model of stability than what we have now.  We also could do the same thing for nuclear Alchemy, that is colliding nuclei to make new elements. This might give us a prediction of the optimal combination of elements and Energies to reach the island of stability.
Thanks.  New subscriber 🎉
There are other ways to make electricity or smoke detectors. It's not like the world would be vastly different without those. except of course plutonium is the material of choice for nuclear weapons due to it's density and low critical mass. Delivery systems would be a lot more expensive for uranium based weapons. Either way, I don't see the use for our species if we can make 50 atoms of some exotic material in a year for billions of dollars. Also smoke detectors with radioactive elements are mostly for industrial use. What people have at home is typically a combination of temperature and light based alarms where a sensor measures the decrease in brightness of a light source as smoke passes between them.
It would be nice if he actually mentioned which elements may be synthesized soon even though they’re unstable (radioactive)
Where did they get this  it exist
Bob Lazar spoke of element 115 back in the 1990s 👍
Vibranium?
Understanding element 43's instability is signifiant to understanding atomic properties.  It is very likely that atomic mass including neutrons plays a significant role in the stability and half life of an element.  It is likely an instability that the ratio of the mass of an element versus the force that holds atoms together will have either electrons or protons decay to a stable slow moving element.  It is very likely that manipulating electromagnetic forces or creating a stronger electromagnetic field or diamagnetic field will alter the speed of decay or create a new way to stabilize elements.  It is like how the moon right now is in orbit around the Earth.  Slowly that orbit is decaying to the point that it will no longer orbit the sun or shift its orbit away.  You could say that the decay is there.  But what if we introduced gravity to warp the gravity around the moon?  Well, we would be able to manipulate the orbit and decay of said moon.  Thus, we could create a stable isotope that is easy to use for nuclear fusion or non-radioactive elements.  Proving to use electromagnetism and diamagnetism would need to be key for this to work.  But nucleear fusion would be more possible and we would be able to decay say Lithium into a stable form of helium or what not.  Instead of mining the moon like the aliens are doing............
If time slows down inside gravity wells and such why don't mergers happen slower from our perspective than they do?
I believe there is something yet to be discovered in our oceans. Until we are, "advanced enough" to see it as a species - not some robot occasionally going down to an insignificant patch of ocean floor - we won't experience or interact with it. Believe it or not, there is a large portion of the planet (land and water) that are unseen and unknown by our species. To think otherwise is a little presumptuous and arrogant.
Bolognyium?
If you're watching this you want to get rid of shingles, aka zoster, as soon as possible. That means not wasting your tie and waiting for months. Although there's not a silver bullet, there are very particular and forgotten home remedies that can help you within about 3-9 days. Maybe go'ogle Kaena Ramingler's approach to see how it all sounds to you.
I always thought any new element would have to be something really waky like something from another dimension that can't normally function in our realm with out technological help.  Thanks for the video. It is interesting to think that there are even higher elements we have never seen in the table. Perhaps one is useable for massive energy production.
Your use of the term "Anthropic Reasoning" is well chosen, but may I suggest a modification that allows a dual-solution of the Fermi Paradox? Let's say "Anthropic-Centred Reasoning" instead...from here we can employ 2 axioms: 1) things/the future is NEVER what we expect, & 2) the more we learn about the Universe the weirder it is... So, we're probably swimming in aliens right now, but can't "see the wood for the trees", so to speak...
Perhaps these theoretical new elements are produced during hyper nova explosions and from jets produced by quasars.
Would creating new elements really benefit humanity?   Chances are they will decay immediately, and we already have plenty of radioactive elements.
The politicians are blocking the knowledge of  stupidium, but it is used every day.
Element 115?
I think Humanity may not be 'grabby', but our form of life could be.
Og is like Original gangster.
These are the only ones of which the news has come to Ha'vard, And there may be many others but they haven't been disca-ver'd. :D
One of the best PBS Space Time episode, great explanation.
This guy is terrible.. he looks like he's just  reading off a teleprompter.. he doesn't even understand this stuff himself he's saying .. unsubscribe
You're FRAUDS. 114-118 were found to be FAKED. The guy who had the info also tried taking 110-112 for Berkly too, but they actually found 112 and his fake mathematics were never scrutinized. The fact you guys still claim anything over 112 has been found, proves your a mainstream SCAM. You didn't do your research and have now given FALSE information for YOUR monetary gains. FRAUD FRAUD FRAUD FRAUD FRAUD
how does gravity affect the radioactive decay of elements??
Could there be more islands of stability extending infinity out at larger and larger numbers?
Are multiple islands of stability theorized or it's just one?
SO... IS THERE A STABLE 115?
Element 115
It need to be harmonically balanced so that it does not have a wobble
Short answer: yea buddy, and we're about to enter the g orbitals
So Captain America's shield should be radioactive and therefor dangerous to people in close contact to it?
I haven't watched the video yet but yes
Duh
Excellent episode. I've always been fascinated with elements. In my childhood I really enjoyed my encyclopedia of elements, with histories of their discovery, naming and applications. Feeling nostalgic now:)
We are eukaryotic.  That means we came from an earliest PAIR of ancestors, both of which evolved separately before combining symbiotically.  Only when these TWO pre-eukaryotic organisms came together was our DNA sufficiently robust enough for our existence to be possible.
The biggest of those theoretical elements is probably bullshitium 🤣
Sooo  Gooood :D And left laughingly intrigued.  Who the beep are we?
👍🏻
everyone who was thinking obanium will be in the start tho
You forgot Elerium-115 and of course Tiberium
Is it weird that the continued lack of an explanation for technetium’s instability makes me irrationally angry?
MINECRAFT
Are there elements beyond those you know?  Yes Can you have some? Nope.
his shirt has made me realize how boring Minecraft's Periodic table is.
The dark forest solution of the Fermi paradox make sense, so we better keep quite until we fully understand our univers.
You are hurting my brain
The thing that we created elements that don't exist in nature proves that there is no end to the periodic table. An element beyond it would be like a number beyond infinity.
Answer: Yes, but in order to find them, we need to solve few gundamental problems first
I'm curious as to why you didn't discuss neutron decay playing a role in nuclear decay.  I would think it should be a considerable factor.
Out of 13 minutes of video, only a meager 3 (three!) Minutes even touch the topic asked in the video title: Are the undiscovered elements?   This is bad.
I love this science channel. It makes me feel like a scientist every time I watch.
Reference class is spiritual beings
Wasnt some found in a uranium ladened cave that had undergone natural safe fission?
Half-Life 2 confirmed in 5730 years.
Can there be atoms that are completely different in structure? Ie not protons+neutrons+electrons, but more like a bunch of quarks that don’t make up all three of the above?
Yes
About the origin of life:  We do not necessarily see from our DNA that all life on Earth came from a single common ancestor -- it could instead be two ancestors. It might be that one ancestor gave us our chromosomal DNA, while another gave us our mitochondrial DNA. These two contributions could have come from two distinct emergences of life. So we didn't eat our competition, we recruited it.
I like that the Periodic Table of Minecraft shirt
Early?, Or very late. You know, kind of backward Neanderthal'ish.   The arrogance of ONE?, believing they are so advanced? Is a misplaced belief in hindsight...  That lead's to destruction.  Why?  To exist like that island?, which is trying to be reached? Your "actions ", in order to reach it?, must be stable.... : - ) Juuuust a little thought, with all that instability. : - O  Enjoyed the video. Grate insights.
Trumpium, the lightest metal not yet added to the Periodical Table.  Almost zero substance.  Yahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_gas_compound
This is a good video.
I wouldn't be surprised other solar systems probably have cooler elements then we got lol 😆. Remember element 115 was supposed to not exist and here we are now we can create it but it disappears just as fast as it's created we haven't found a way to create it and it be stable...
there's actually a game theorists episode that netherite is basically a gold-platinum alloy. There have even been studies that create such an alloy with a moh hardness of like 11 or something!
Why is the last magic number for protons 114 but 126 for neutrons? The magic numbers are the same for all lower value magic numbers...  Something is rather hinky here.
You forgot, uppsydaisyum 🍻
Couldn't you infiltrate an alien species and gain an understanding of them to try and terminate the chain of suspicion earlier than later? At least that seems like a novel solution to the dark forest, hit them with a nerf dart from somewhere they can't find you and observe how they react, or some other better metaphor.
Took me a moment to realize I have the same shirt 🤣
Can half-lifes of isotopes be calculated without direct measurement? If they require some direct measurement, do we know that "stable" elements will *never* decay vs having half-lives orders and orders bigger than the age of the universe?
WoW! First space/time I almost fully understand from beginning to end
The International Atomic Energy Agency has an “Isotope Browser” app that graphically represents all the known elements and their isotopes. I’ve always wondered why there were holes in the graphic—areas with no combination of protons and neutrons.
15:45 brain automatically inserted "space time"
Adamintium is a real element. The Canadian military with it's small budget and non existent research and development division figured out how to lace a human skeleton with it and even gave him 3 claws on each hand that's retractable.
Can’t wait to see the properties of Element 999.
It is possible water has an unknown element besides hydrogen and oxygen scientists and experimenters have no instruments to detect.
Also the element of ohio
As a young scientist this grasped my mind because of the gaps on the table. I believe that we on earth have only limited elements.
Finally some actual science
u missed vibranium
Am I the only guy that learned this from Star Trek?    Not as perfectly... But Learned it???
You're not a chemist, but if you're going to make a video where you say technetium over and over and over and over and over again, you should learn how to pronounce it. Say "tech". Now say "niche". Now say "eum" like the end of museum. There you go. That's how it's pronounced. NICHE, not NET.
Element 115!!!! Act accordingly.  🎬
"Are there...?"  Nope, humans know everything.  *HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!*
How were these magic numbers of protons and neutrons discovered?
I'm goning to say all of the elements I know only symbol H He Li Be B C N O F Ne Na Mg Al Si P S Cl Ar K Ca Sc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn Ga Ge As Se Br Kr Rb Sr Y Zr Nb Mo Tc Ru Rh Pd Ag Cd In Sn Sb Te I Ex Cs Ba * tell me if I got one wrong*
No there aren't any islands of stability way up there. The best you could hope for is something way up there with maybe a half-life of 30 seconds instead of .000000001 second. But you're not going to find stable elements with atomic numbers higher than anything ever attained. Element 114 with atomic mass 298 was SUPPOSED to be the center of the superheavy island of stability, and it has never been attained, but the binding energy it will have, will just not leave it anywhere near the ground energy state, thus it will still be very radioactive, just not quite as radioactive as it would be if it wasn't a sort of magic number.
Seaborg indicted that after these unstable elements that we have discovered, the elements will become more stable.  He discovered a lot of elements, some of which cannot last in our atmosphere, but could last in other places.  Cheers!
There are definitely elements not on the table.
Let’s go brandon 🍦🍦🍦
Would it be possible to create building blocks that aren't atoms, but could be used like atoms to create large structures? If so, would this new type of matter be stronger than anything we could make using atoms?
Unobtanium!
How do we know that the elements that are stable, are actually completely stable, and don't just have decay periods of cosmically long periods of time?
He forgot that cool, funky, and jive turkey repellant element:. DOLAMITE!!!
No, there aren’t
do bears 🐻 poop 💩 in the woods?
Nice t-shirt
Are you really asking do we know everything?
What does "half-lfe" mean exactly, does it literally mean half of it's life? Why do we not say "It has a life of an hour and forty two minutes."?
What chance do we have of finding a stable exotic atom? i.e. an atom which isn't made only of protons, neutrons, and electrons but also other hadrons and fermions? and what effect might this have on material science?
SO what's the halflife of Photoshop Elements?
Obamium
Element  -1 Element -2 Element   -3 ...
Yes...Predator 2 proved it
What was the math Rutherford used to predict the neutron?
Actually, Prof. Andre Assis calculate that at quantum scales protons are attractive, onviating the need for a 'strong force'. Try to keep up. Sheesh.
20:30 I just recently read Cixin Liu's "The Dark Forest," and wow, it has had me thinking about this.
I'm so disappointed you didn't mention Elerium :|
Well, that "114" island of stability already disappointed. So I doubt we'll ever find more stable elements. Also, theages being named by materials alsways happened, because men found a way to make use of them, not that they were discovered then.
Good video, but it’s incorrect to say one isotope of Technetium decays in 4.2 million years while the other decays in under an hour. Half-life refers to the amount of time any given mass of an element will be half-decayed, not how long it takes for a single atom of that element to decay. I expect better
5:01 Half Life game logo in PBS video! Half Life 3 confirmed 😆
I like to keep some element 115 around just in case .
we might just be in the zoo...  that being there is a galactic federation...  already.
Unfeasium...
114 and 115 are new i never had them in school
Nuclear Medicine technicians  say "Tech....wha???"
no way that t-shirt wasn't on purpose
a video on dilithium would be very welcome - particularly in its crystalline state
If man emerged with in the last let us say 2 million years, then why didn't the dinosaurs develop intelligence???
Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition Element.
Could we do quantum physics experiments in the event horizon of a black hole and see the decay in slow motion?
Could the coalition of neutron stars create elements form island of stability?
He knows science AND the memes Ice
You didn't discuss metallic Hydrogen.
When I started high school, the Periodic Table in the Chemistry textbook had only two... no, sorry, three elements after the Actinides, and they were called Kurchatovium ad Hahnium. Now Rutherfordium and Dubnium. Now you know how old I am.
No.
OMG! Your shirt. Lol
Many of those science fiction "materials" have unique physical or chemical properties unseen otherwise.  Which is really largely in the realm of the electron configurations, not so much nuclear properties.  Only some are impacted by the configuration of the nucleus (the fuels and Kryptonite.)  So I'm afraid that even if we discover a lot of new elements, those fantasy physical properties still wouldn't exist.  Those new "super materials," not necessarily elements, could be made by using the current elements instead.  Look at plain old Carbon, one of the first elements discovered.  Now put it in a matrix not seen in nature; ta-da, Carbon fiber, with amazing properties.  Nothing quite like it in nature, but nothing new was needed, either.
I couldn't help but chuckle when I heard the names Sugden and Sugdenium
These elements can exist for only short periods of time or we would see their emission and absorption lines in stellar spectra.
We are clearly NOT the most advanced beings in the galaxy.  We have seen visitors and their craft, but there is always a branch of science that dismisses this, but at the same time ask the question "Is there life out there"  like idiots who cannot see the forrest for the trees.  Also don't include the theory of "evolution" in your science because it is statistically impossible.  Abiogenesis is not remotely possible.  See Dr. James Tour on the statistics against any one step of life making itself.  See Dr. Steven Myers on how impossible evolution is.  Yet atheists keep assuming it is all possible.  So if you proceed from the assumption that life can just "Make itself somehow" then you are no longer dealing with truth nor actual science.  Instead accept that an intelligent designer can put life wherever he wants to.  Every star system could have life.  It could all be DNA bases being that all life has a common creator.  If random life could just pop into existence then there would be many diverse kinds of DNA or alien forms of DNA different from our own but there is not.  It's as if Every book ever written were written in one language, English and then people stated that this language just popped into existence without a writer.   So if there are other societies on other planets it is reasonable to assume they are advanced like us and why don't they visit us?  It could be that it is not possible as in our case, or they are forbidden by their creator as we are clearly corrupt, or we could in fact be the most advanced by one or two hundred years and so no once even has a big radio receiver yet.     But never assume that the impossible will occur on planets like life just "Making itself somehow"  like atheists here believe.
wrr
This host is amazing.
Interesting final philosophical speech, Doctor. 🤓🖖
Meta states, come on, you may do anything while on simulation or paper.  Iron?  You need LOTS of H and enough power so probability and quantum effects get you a stable heavy nucleus!  And that seems to be the limit, but then if you make the star go nova, then you can get some heavier stable stuff. But anyway. If you go supernova, there will be heavier isotopes and unstable anyway. What maintains for a while their configuration is the circa c speed.
Ok...but... How hard would I have to slap someone to turn their face (and presumably my hand) into a black hole?
Let's not forget,  all the dark matter related elements are yet to be discovered
5:08 yesss that half life reference :D
I have discovered a few new elements myself as a aspiring scientist I hope to be on my way
Adamantium is sort of an alloy 🤓🖖🤣
Wait a second... if technetium 97 has a half-life of 4 million years, how did we figure that? We have only known/been able to produce it for what, 50 years? We should not have then observed it decaying, right? What am I missing? Why wouldn't we just think it is stable?
No, we know everything....😐
Could we build an element with a nucleus big enough to be visible to the human eye? Probably a silly question, but if we could, what would it look like?
Don't burst my bubble about Element zero!!! although if that would be real... also mean reapers could be. Ah well, I guess the answer the fermi paradox!
I rarely get amazed. But this info REALLY amazed me. Astonishing !! Thanks.
Of course - there are many elements now that weren’t known when I took chemistry in the 1960’s.
Part of me can't help that wonder if such a super heavy element would be so heavy that it would be poisonous on an atomic level?
Could everything not be made from electrons? Only in clumps making neutrons, and all the particles,  just a ignorant question I was ask,
Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn
At higher atomic numbers, it's rather invention than discovery.
No. Everything after Seaborgium has a half-life measured in seconds or milliseconds. They weren't discovered; they were invented. Don't worry though: we'll invent the next ones too.
What if combination of elements exist in extreme conditions as in inside the sun because of extreme heat and pressure??
Your Periodic Table after 118 is inaccurate.  There should be a star in the third position, just as the Actinide and Lanthanide series above it
The next split in evolution probably will be the smart ones leaving the greedy dumb ones. The scientists with a sense of humanity are going to leave the disingenuous superstitious idiots to fight amongst themselves on earth.
If I somehow able to invent/discover a new element .I will surely  named it after any cuss word . I don't like those type of nerdy kids who doesn't swear.
So is there any way element 115 could have an isotope in the stable island region and be a potential fuel for the "alien" spaceships
Pu 244 is also a "long lived" radioisotope with a long enough half life (80 million years) to still have some "primordial" trace fractions so its not entirely artificial on Earth but yes the far less stable 239 is certainly entirely artificial.
Yes there are undiscovered elements. Some of them may be so reactive they only exist in their pure form for less than an instant before forming a compound with something else. Some may be so rare it only exists in 0.0000001% of the galaxies, and the "Milky Way" is one of the majority that does not have it, hence "human" scientists will never "discover" it. Could "dark matter" be an unknown element? What about light particles? Are light particles an element or a compound? Is "life" an element that breaks down or mixes with other compounds over time becoming "death"?
Great episodium!
I imagine that if they are stable and can be created in in the most energetic processes that produce all other elements, then we'd have seen traces somewhere by now. I don't think this island of stability will be anything more than relatively stable isotopes - lasting for seconds rather than nanoseconds or less.
Well netherite is in minecraft you insect
1d late yet i was watching *planning to watch this near release datae but i forgo t lol
Naquadah
adamantium
At 6:00, when the atomic numbers are being filled in to the 8th period, someone's forgotten about the f and g subshells. Element 172 should be under the oganesson.
You missed veritasium
"Next marathon..." They have not done the last 2 marathons. I think it cost them too much money (in their eyes)  to give away tanks. And the players doing well in tanks that don't look like they should do that well; pub players always play terrible against new tanks.
Could it also be possible that the island of stabilty, has more kinds of nucleons? Like single neutrons are unstable, but if they hold on to a proton they become stable. And as you said the more protons there are, the more neutrons can be stabilised. Is it possible that a sufficiently large amount of nucleons could stabilise more exotic baryons, and those would in turn help to further stabilise the atomic nucleus?
mythril isn't an element, it's an  alloy... it even says so in Tolkien's body of work... good job researching that. some nerd you are.
Maybe 100 years later this periodic table and every thing else will be proved wrong and some new theory might come up!
So carbon 14 dating is unreliable bc of its instability? Ty
I wonder if virtual particles will ever make it to the period table with their half life of plank second.
Fermi paradox. Well, assume that a mix of all the possible solution suggestions is near the truth. A broth of solutions making the universe an interesting place to explore.
I almost feel asleep whilewatching his voice is soothing
Nice use of the Half Life game logo
About life emerging in a universe that already has civilizations. Intelligent civilizations are capable of having the policy of a prime directive. In a universe that only has civilizations that successfully follow a prime directive new instances of life are possible.
It should be the second island of stability.  The stable elements end at lead it just happens that thorium, uranium, and plutonium are reasonably stable.
Wouldnt Ubh310 be in the center and be similar to U238 or Th232 but denser?
Arseholium: any common metal that mysteriously takes 10x the amount of damage/tool action it should be able to withstand, yet remains nearly intact.
Someone should have told this guy how to pronounce technetium
As for the anthropic discussion at the end of this video my thinking is as follows.  We can reasonably assume... and we do... that the laws of physics are the same everywhere in the universe.  We have learned about these laws.... but of course the why's.... why do these laws exist at the critical .... seemingly fine tuned ...... values they do to give rise to beings like ourselves... this remains a mystery.  Nevertheless these laws of physics do exist and were equally distributed throughout the cosmos with the big bang.  Similar reasoning applies to the laws of chemistry.  Think of it.  For some period of time.... I think some billions of years... after the creation of the universe.... there were no chemical reactions... only nuclear.... for until the first stars formed and died and exploded seeding the universe with heavier elements.... in the beginning all that existed was hydrogen and helium.  There is no chemistry to be done  at this point.  But what of what would later on become the laws of chemistry.  Did they only arise at the point that heavier elements were created to begin chemical reactions..... or did these laws already exists at the start with the big bang.... but could not yet manifest until the elements needed for such reactions were created by exploding stars.  It seems reasonable that the laws of chemistry that would ultimately arise were built into the universe from the very beginning.  Well the same then is likely true with the laws of biochemistry.... though for instance we do not understand why life came to be...we can very readily observe how the molecules of life work down at the cellular level... with DNA and proteins and all.  Why these laws of biochemistry exist...as with physics..... we do not understand... be we do understand much of how it works.  So it seems reasonable then that with the big bang the laws of physics and chemistry and biology were equally distributed throughout the universe from the very start just awaiting the natural physical formation of the needed materials to manifest.  If so then it's reasonable  to conclude that life exists throughout the universe.  But look at the history of life on earth.  Indeed.... following my reasoning... the laws of biochemistry might very well dictate that it takes billions of years for evolution to create intelligent life.  99% of the time of earth life was very primitive single cell stuff.  Our advanced human civilization with technology and our ability to even imagine alien space travel is a micro second in time compared to the billions of years of the universe.  Coupled with the vastness of the universe and the trillions upon trillions of planets to visit and the pure luck of visiting within the mere centuries of time of advanced life ...... I do not find it mysterious at all that we have yet to be visited or detect other alien life.  But as my arguement goes... the laws that ultimately gave rise to our life form and our abilities likely exist throughout the universe.  Life and advanced life is out there and even if we have yet to have an alien encounter it may very well be that other worlds have discovered each other.  I will take it one step further... pure speculation yes... but reasonably one could argue that the laws of life are simply DNA... that remarkable and unexplainable as the DNA molecule is and how it controls protein structure... that its simply the way it is... like physics and chemistry. .. the laws of biology... though seeminly magical and unexplainable that it could even arise...... nevertheless exist everywhere.  As with laws of physics and chemistry we do not understand how or why it came to be and yet there it is.  There is already evidence of such as space rocks are shown to have the building block materials of DNA.  So perhaps star trek and star wars.... with so many humanoid types of beings... maybe its not so far fetched.  Yes there is evolution and random selection... but other worlds would be subject to similar stresses and organisms would pursue survival according to the laws of evolution.    It could be... again why we do not know... but it could be built into the laws that not only does DNA give rise to life but things like back bones... reproduction methods starting with self replication to eggs to advancing to live birth... milk... caring for young... etc... these are simply pre-built laws spread everywhere throughout the universe.... so not only is life everywhere but perhaps even the structure of life forms itself. .. it was all built in from the start.  Not sure about this humanoid idea... or say mammal structure idea... but I do believe life itself in any form exists throughout the universe and DNA and all the creatures this remarkable material gives rise to is the chemistry set of the cosmos and built in from the start.
so, how about nuclei with hundreds of neutrons? they should hold together, even if a few are protons to make it more stable...
When it comes to finding stable heavy isotopes, Astrophysicists are way ahead of nuclear physicists. Astrophysicists have already detected perfectly stable isotopes beyond the island of stability, with mass-numbers in the order of 10^57. We usually refer to them as neutron stars.  (And yes, though they are called neutron stars, they still have some protons inside. Though they'll make less than 1% of the neutron stars total mass)
Nice episode as always!
By the law of time dilation there are elements beyond the periodic table but they are just the time dilated elements we already have detected by the speed of our own observer time frame. The island of stability would mean to be able to stabilize the wave function of iron or something into only the superposition of the wavefunction and not colapse into the matter state of stability because they are time dilated at that level. Meaning we have infinite of octaves of the same elements going on, on faster and faster timescales blueshifted into higher and more "unstable" from our point of view (but they are stable witihn their own time frame).    To simplify (using superpowers) if you could slow the speed of your conscioesness or speed it up you could find out that every element would keep following you as you blue and redshift the universe around you. Hidden dimensions of the wavefunctions would colapse into view and you would see what the world looks like going through time at different speeds. In a sense ONE element can be the same as ANOTHER element depending how fast the observer is going through time. Meaning the frequency of the wavefunction of the elements superpositions are the amount of colapsed electrons and so on and the faster you go through time elements will have a faster and faster half-life making them more and more unstable and thus become invicible too you.  So we all "know" quantum theory is just saying things have a superposition and when you measure it that will colapse into a detectable mass "or an average potential energy of the superpositions" meaning all matter are just wavefunctions of energy at different frequencies, and if the frequencies are too fast to measure becasue they are going trough time faster (maybe at billions of years per second) that means light has infinite mass over infinite time meaning if you slow down time (human consciousness as the resistor) you get all the mass that ever will exist from that energy colapsed before you into existence. And mass will follow you forever but you only see the spectrum you can detect by the time dilation zone you live inside.  This is not saying there are a set limited amount of elements, but only that they repeat forever by the function of the observers time dilated sense of existence.  But if you could use octaves of elements at the same time how would that look like for an advanced space civilization ?
What about 5 quarks substance? How is Mendeleev Table witn such nuclei?? Is it another matter? Is it the so called DarkMatter? Another whole univers through ours??
Some maths say those are extremely unstable. Thus totally unusefull
The fact is element is infinite
Fun fact about Mendeleve, the idea for the periodic table came to him in a dream
Very interesting and educational video.    Wonder if our computer models and experimentation have yielded any ability to not only predict where islands of element stability will exist.....  but also the macroscopic properties of that element.  Its one thing to be able to produce an artificial element but doing so with a purpose in mind ahead of time for some beneficial technical application would be an incredible achievement of science and engineering.    When science fiction ... or some people believe to already be true.... ascribes some fantastic technology advancements of alien civilizations that would afford them seemingly super natural abilities I often scoff that there is no known element of material known to exist in the universe that has such properties.... and we assume aliens have at their disposal the same elements and laws of physics and chemistry thst we have.  They may be more technologically advanced using the same resources we have.... but they dont have some magical materials at their disposal.    This video makes me realize my assumption could be wrong.  Elements and materials could be created .... yes according to the laws of physics .... but that simply do not pre-exist in nature.  If there are some amazing properties of such elements then.... in theory at least..... it is possible that seemingly science fictional abilities of some advanced alien civilization could be made to happen.... and one day we may become those aliens ourselves.    Of course this all assumes that macroscopic properties of stable artificial elements have unusual properties at all.  It could be that other than being super dense and heavy they possess no property out of the ordinary....which brings me back to my initial point.    Wonder if we have any computer modeling that not only predicts islands of stability but also element properties.  If we predicted some amazing property ahead of time that could be engineered into some incredible technology that could not be built otherwise.... that would be an amazing achievement and striving to create it more sensational than say the moon landing initiatives of the 1960s.
tldw: yes
Please don’t update chemistry
Dang some of the topics discussed here are all colleges level or higher/advance or modern physics, for high-school student it's really hard to understand what is being talked about and just made my head hard  lol.... 😅😅😅😅
Unobtainium? 😆
Why do you pronounce "says" as "saze" instead of "sez"? You are Australian not American.
Excellent video. Keep the hard work.
Your hand movements look stupid and are distracting.
4:54 there is a mistake its it not an anti electron neutrino?
I am very close to the synthesis of a new element called Grandiosium which eventually decays into Bragelithium.
It truly amazes me that for as long as PBS space time has been a thing, NO ONE has caught how terribly flat and bland the intro jingle is. There are clearly notes that were intended to be hit, but all but two are flat. It’s horrible. It instantly sets someone’s mind up with a certain feeling of expectation, and just a moment later destroys it with mediocre musical composition. It’s terrible and you need to fking fix it.
The universe is filled with life. We are all hiding from each other because we all know at least one of 'them' is going to stomp us out like a little bug if they find us.
I personally consider Bourbon (Bourbonium) to be an element. One which I require daily for life
The amount of brutality didn't change, it's just silicon brutality now.
I find it astonishing we are THE ONLY life form here. Have labs created other life? -Or will it crawl out of the trash? I had wondered about silver-based life forms, but since, as you say, silver has a perfectly stable isotope, we may need another universe...?
1.5 seconds in: "Bolognium"
The graph showing the stability of elements is shockingly ugly for a natural process of the universe.
How about Vibranium?!  Black panther & Cpt. America are very disappointed with PBS Space Time... 😔
I've tried over and over to get an answer as to how likely we believe the Island of stability is to exist and I just can't find one that is clear and concise; anybody know?
12:36 maybe is another rule we don`t yet know but is fundamental. on this graf is more  jumps 12:04.
His answer is, 'wouldn't it be interesting if there were' and then jabbers on and on on miscellaneous topics.
Do we have any grasp of what the virtual particle landscape looks like?
i was literally asking myself this question 2 days ago and now this video drops
1:22 that being said given the forces involved in super and hyper novas and black hoes oh my and the number of time those things have occurred it would seem if there are stable elements that are heavier than what we currently know then they ar require conditions more extreme that the aforementioned crush and explosions to be crated or are created in such love volumes that  even after so many events  they are still undetected like in the tens of atoms per supernova ...
1:12 science is what it has always been .. the practical application of curiosity lol .. aka smack stuff into other stuff and record what happens
End poverty.  Make it happen.  No excuses.
to hold the atom in a steady state .. we need. centrifuges .. and my machines .....   ( its kinda like  DUH a supernova makes more .... ) hi  - - - the real JNHM was here
I believe that we need an international agreement that future discovered elements will get certain specific names from sci-fi, guaranteed. Particularly from Star Trek. But also, the others.
Has anyone counted the number of neutrons in neutron stars? Strong force is for baby Kardashev scale civilizations, we should go with gravity for new islands of stability, that is, if we want to be taken seriously by any respectable alien civilization.
*Mendeleyev
I think there has to be one or more elements we don’t know yet that help with antigravity and traveling through another “dimension” or “phase” to reach other star systems.
Bob lazar knew about element 115 before it was announced.
There were some great nuggets in there that didn't even get touched on in my Chemistry degree! Looking forward to the deeper dive episode into nucleon stability
Better to hope we aren't very early. Because if we are, by evolutionary reasoning, it also means we aren't the ones that last.
Mendeleev didn't know about protons, but... made a structured table of elements and noticed gaps?
Aloha, a friend and I just stargazed and watched 2h of racetrack UFO above us. 3 white spheres cruising in a perimeter track and at very high altitude. 6-8pm. Mostly clear and starry night with few Pacific clouds at ca 700m. Let's find answer and figure out what alien politics we are subjected to. I invite our alien factions to land here in Hilo and explain themselves. I witnessed the October 9th battle here at sunrise. I think I figured out warp drive. Our governments are causing untold problems, overpopulation is killing the planet. 7 billion dumb  people are hardly human anymore. We need help. I suggest a democratic science council speaking for our planet. Help!
this guy isn't telling the truth.
Esqueceu o Vibranium e o Badassium
8:30 that explanation would indicate that the more neutrons are in a nucleus the more stable it would be... Except we know that too many neutrons also are unstable as in the case of carbon14.
Are there any promising means to potentially create those elements that might exist on the island of stability?
Hahaha I love the shirt!!
At 9:45 you say that either the number of neutrons, protons, or protons plus neutrons must be even. But isn't that just true of all numbers? If the number of protons and neutrons are both odd, then their sum is always even. What am I missing here?
Intercaustium is real!!
Elements are integers.  Intervals of even numbers.  We live in a Marxist Feminist world, people so confused there are billions of undecided illusions.
You forgot to mention Divinium.
At the start: Despite being fictional, Adamantium is made to be an alloy, not an element.
Simple answer, yes
This assumes our foundational understanding of the periodic table and as we define is will not change and is perfectly correct. If all science has taught us is that the more we learn, the more we find out how wrong we were :)
it would help if you actually looked at the camera, it's weird watching your eyes go side to side i guess, how come you used to be able to remember this stuff, maybe i'm mistaken
We know next to nothing about 118 which I still call ununoctioum. I remember reading even through its part of the noble gas family. It might not even be a noble gas. It might react with different things
Wouldn't element 0 be a few neutrons stuck together with a short half- life. Also is there a limit on how heavy an element can be? What is the material in a neutron star? Could it all be one gigantic element since its all connected
Huh I didn't realize that all isotopes of bismuth were radioactive. So that means peptobismol is radioactive. But just barely. The most common and only naturally occurring isotope of it (bismuth-209) has a half life of 20,100,000,000,000,000,000 (2.01*10^19) years. Or 20.1 exayears, or 20,100 petayears, or 20,100,000 terayears to put it into terms you MIGHT understand. I think everybody's dealt with a terabyte so you might have a vague idea of how big a number that is depending on how much you know about computers. But it's still an impossibly huge number. I'm pretty sure it's longer than the universe is supposed to exist lol.
I have an idea on the Fermi paradox that we have not achieved the technology required to communicate with other races yet. My thinking goes if 1 billion years ago a magic modern 5g uwb cell tower was setup on the near side of the moon continuously broadcasting instructions to build a modern cell phone to connect to the tower. How many years ago would we have been able to detect the signal, determine that it was not natural, had an informational component, and finally would have been able to decode the transmitted information. I'm assuming and I would love more accurate dates that it wouldn't be noticed until about 100 years ago, then considered nothing but a repeating oddity until 20-40 years ago and the ability to decode the signal would probably only be the last handful of years. It seems like the signals we look for are similar to the ones we currently use and will only be able to find civilizations that were at a very similar level of technology at the time that the signals would have left their world to arrive here now. If we are out of sync by more than a few decades we would likely miss them. Rant over.
Yay.  I love when it's chemistry stuff!
Half Life 3 confirmed!
My understanding is that the heavy elements (beyond iron) formed by neutron caputer is the extremely high energy envornment of a super/nova while pysicists create sythetic elements by colliding neutron rich isotopes a method that will probebly be used for the next round of new elements (aboe 118) once factories of the right elements are in production. Questions: I'm wondering if it's possible to produce a high enough neutron flux hear on earth to use neutron capture to create superheavy elements. And does the next round of collision experiments have a hope of reaching the island of stability which, if stable enough, woudl be a launch pad to even heavier elements.
Today is the best, hmmm I think your ability to predict the future is showing badly in that statement.  I believe we should expect many new discoveries that improve humanity's habitability to currently be a long way from where it will end up.  We may be so far down the line that in the future when they will look at us and say why do they keep trying to kill everyone with radiation it is everywhere and yet they do nothing about it. You know how we used to bloodlet and other things.
Umm....where's Shungite?
This was quite interesting.
Why are you pronouncing Technetium weird? The second “t” is soft.
Without even watching this i can say , Yes there are, humans think they know everything   P.S Science always make me happy, actually Science is the best part of Humanity
Where is obamium
No.
"Netherite" 👌💀👍
Heh I remember back in the 90's when element 115 hadn't been discovered yet. This nutjob, Bob Lazar claimed he worked on flying saucers at Area 51 and that element 115 produces some sort of antigravity properties so it's used as a fuel in these alien space ships the government captured from Roswell. Except none of his educational or work credentials actually checked out. He claimed to be a physicist but the school he said he went to said they never heard of him. He claimed it was the government trying to cover up his story. Not to mention Roswell itself has been debunked as being part of Project Mogul. So it seems to me like his story checks out. Either way, I was tantalized by these stories when I was a kid. They were fun with a grain of salt.
we are the Drak, the primordial life that protects the fabric of spacetime from species who could destroy it with false vaccum or grey goo.  alternatively, the Drak are hiding, waiting to save us from ourselves, and save themselves from us.
*Love* the t-shirt! 🤣
Yes because we don't completely understand the process, we know unstable elements can be made but not how and making Nihonium or whatever is an example we don't understand, there's also things in the universe we don't understand fully or enough either. There's also possibly Elements on Exoplanets that we have yet to discover.
43??  But the answer is 42!
Answer is yes
Holy crap, it's an actual halfling!
Wow, that is a classic Minecraft shirt!
Yes of course
I'm sure an exploding star makes elements unknown .  It goes from 1 to super massive black hole.
Are there undiscovered elements? Uh, yeah!
9:45 An even number of protons, and even number of neutrons, or an even total number of protons plus neutrons? So... every possible configuration? If it has an odd number of protons and an odd number of neutrons, then the total will still be even. The sum of two odd numbers is always even.
Anyone have any ideas for how we would stabilize a unstable isotope using advanced technology without changing the isotopes themselves?
Imagine stable element 118, Oganesson being mined from stars. A single Oganesson atom has around 200 Mega electron volts of energy within itself. Imagine a quintillion Oganesson atoms together, the size of a small box, being used to power entire solar systems!
could there be any lighter elements on table
Another brilliant video by PBS Space Time. Thank you
half life of 0.69ms... nice
Of course there are.  We’re not that smart that we haven’t discovered all the elements.  We haven’t even explored our own oceans yet.  Like come on.
considering the fact that man has yet to figure out gravity…. id say its a pretty sure bet there are many elements and many many  maannyy more isotopes that have yet to be discover
The issue will be the half life of the new elements.   It might be so low that if any did exist. They would all have decayed into more stable elements.
Netherite? Krastorio/Factorio reference!
My hunch of a Fermi Paradox solution is that complex civilisations tend to burn out quickly. There may be civilisations rising and falling all the time like flowers in the spring. Looking at ourselves we are highly likely to drive ourselves into extinction by several means and in a relatively short time span in terms of geological time. Our most important motivators of behaviour are not rational but energised by deeper layers of our brains which predate humanity itself and which we share with animals. If we were primarily rational creatures then marketing would not work. Our rational cerebral cortex is employed to make excuses for our darker angles of nature rather then to over ride them.
We don't know.
Undiscovered? No. Uncreated? Yes.
Ca;ifornium and americium are thought to have much lower critical masses than uranium and plutonium. Perhaps there are isotopes from the island of stability that have critical masses that are lower still. This could allow nuclear reactors the size of a toaster, and perhaps it could also allow for microscale nuclear explosives. Actually there would be wonderful applications for such an isotope if only human organizations were responsible enough. A home powered by a microreactor that provided heat and electricity that only needed fuelling with a golf ball sized lump of fuel once in a lifetime would be wonderful (especially considering that the current price of uranium is about $50/lb, it is truly the cheapest fuel per quantity of energy produced). A nuclear hand grenade on the other hand would be horrible. Given the proclivity of human governments for violence I find only the grenade would be built for certain if we had material that allowed it.
13:02 nice
As someone with a rare illness, I find the Anthropic Principle lacking.
Those would he compounds...m
Re: Alien civilizations. I've heard that the wheel, as a means of transportation, was only invented once in all human history -- I think in Sumeria. If something as seemingly obvious as that can be so hard to discover, perhaps there are a whole list of discoveries, that can stop a civilization cold that doesn't happen to discover them.
Brilliant!  We just found one of the missing elements here in Canada.    The early 1970's saw Cuba give a large deposit of this rare substance (now known as Trudopite) to a Canadian woman married to a former idiot of a PM.  After 9 months of biological gestation the element came into existence with the appearance of a human.  Trudopite is responsible for brain damaging much of Ottawa and has sickened much of the world.  There appear to be no useful needs for Trudopite.  It is a chemically complex element very similar to feces in physical attributes.  Currently there are no known cures for the affected Liberals and Democrats inflicted with Trudopite.  It is recommended that any affected persons not be permitted to breed or be in contact with any real life forms for fear of contagion.  Published in the CLJOC by Dr. Wilnot.
So if we give a neutron star a proton, is that hydrogen 1zillion ?
👍👍
un-obtainium has an very interesting property  it can detect those who are are of lower socio-economic demographic and remain hidden from them
Yes, it's true any element with more than 83 protons, but also Bi with 83 protons.  It's indicated right there in the table at 5:28, so ihd presenter should say more than 82 protons.
Abramium and Whoopzonium are a few electrons short.<<hehe(weirdly tho their mass keeps increasing)
Hand gestures don't make sense! No relevance!
The title of this video is so misleading.  Obviously, any undiscovered elements would not be "beyond the periodic table".  They would fit right in it!  The video content actually acknowledges that that, in the past, gaps in the periodic table were filled by newly discovered elements that were actually searched for in order to fill those gaps.
No vibranium😢
Sugdenium my nuclei! Sorry, it had to be done.
So elementary
The universe is too big for us to conclusively say we've figured out all existing elements
🤔...Muonic Fields ?
Phenomenal presentation as usual.
I wonder how research is going regarding exotic matter? Heard somewhere that they are trying to make neutron matter (Neutronium).
Yes and I know all of them
OK now talk about Vibranium, Adamantium, and Eternium 😃
OK now talk about Vibranium, Adamantium, and Eternium 😃

…well there’s an Element 115, right Bob?
You forgot VIBRANIUM in your opening.😿
Plasma elements. Plasma is abundant in the universe but not on earth
Yep the lie to us about everythin dirty bastartds nazis.

Such a good video
My new type beat https://youtu.be/3nyU64y449Q
Fictional elements often utterly fail to address one of the things that makes elements so interesting in the first place - how they react with other elements.
This was very interesting, thank you.
Observation: A lot of the latest video i click through have dark odd lightning, i can hardly see your eyes. The channels intro video "The Edge of an Infinite Universe" has a much more even lightning.
Would the high pressure in the core of a star make a difference? It would be interesting if post-120 elements existed in the cores of stars only to decay when they leave the influence of the gravitational pressure
Humanity was able to pull back and stop the extermination of the whales. So we live side by side with other sentient creatures in peace. I don't see why it couldn't be like that on a cosmic scale. Reference class: Not food.
This got me thinking about something I read before I knew better where some guy who was claiming to have examined alien spacecraft in Area 51 said their ships used Element 115 (then unknown to science) which was stable with the curious property that the Strong Force extended slightly beyond the nucleus of the atom making it accessible for use in such things as (I believe) artificial gravity and warp drive  Obviously silly nonsense now but not knowing how ridiculously unstable elements get past 99, I held out hope that something interesting might happen when it would first be synthesized. Oh well :-)
11:04 Not they only way sir. The Large Hadron Collider can do some cool things.
I think Bolognaium is a bunch of nonsense.  However, if it exists, it is used to make a sammich.
Funny Pixar release their new animation movie "Elemental" teaser today, hmm the butterfly effect is very present.
Thought provoking as always, Matt.  Can I assume that because we don't know what any higher magic numbers may be then that means we don't have much or perhaps any idea about where they come from? Are they likely to turn out to be some new kind of constants which we simply have to accept such as 1/137(-ish)?
The element of know how
Mattium, Ellenium, Dasium.
14:28. If some archeologist from the the future looked at what we left behind, they certainly would say we were in the Plastic Age.
I  like what you do, but i' am unable to make a subscription .... my post code is not the same as yours. please you do something wonderful try to fix it...
I knew this video was too complicated for me since there’s less than 1 million views
Matt, where's the Vibranium?
Isn't there always new elements being added?
We find ourselves .013% along the temporal road to the end of star formation in the universe. That's early. It's not surprising in the least that the stars are _not_ all teched-up with Matrioshka brains, yet.
Stop calling people by their last names.  Call them by their first names.
The anthropic principle is a perfect example of what happens when you give statisticians insufficient information to make a real judgement.
Watermelonium?
How does one visualize the constituents of an atom using quantum mechanics?
now i want a video on possible Fermi paradox solutions hahahaha
You forgot Veritasium 😄
The answer is yes but are they reasonable to make.. no👎 feel like you watched that other YouTube the other day that had that awesome video on the element race between Russia and Berkley.
I’d MUCH rather be a cosmic horror than a weak squishy frail human
What about r-processes in super-high neutron densities like supernovae and neutron star mergers? If superheavy nuclei are created in there and stable, should we not find remnants of them, even on Earth?
A surprisingly down to earth episode. BTW,is tecnetium pronounced that way?
Defenetly at last 1 which is only found in Africa mountain  rare metal xerium 525
Interesting enough technitium 99m is used for hear scans because it sticks to damaged heart muscle. After it decays by an internal transition by a gamma emission you are left with technitium 99 which is a rather weak beta emitter. One curious property of Tc99 is that it is an amazingly potent corrosion inhibitor for stainless steel despite its radioavtibity. In fact the radioactivity itself is what makes it so potent. Each beta reduces multiple oxides and hydroxides back to metals. It is added to reactor steels used in submarines for this reason because the added radioactivity is negligable and the reactor is cooled with salt water. 🤓
Cool video! Thanks for makiing it.
what if these fantasy elements are just  another name for known elements and alloys, like Adamantite its just Tungsten. Fantasy people just have name then differently.
Talk to Roger spur on mud fossil university #mudfossil
Can a neutron star be reasonably considered a very large stable atom?
As to two life forms arising at the same time, I seem to recall hearing that regular DNA and mitochondrial DNA might have originated from two different life forms
I’m pretty sure there’s TONS of information my money doesn’t allow me to know.
If Bob Lazar is to be believed, there's a stable isotope of Element 115
The thought of certain death isn’t a huge motivator to want to handle “mythical” materials higher than what’s recorded on the periodic table. Lol.
I wonder if elements in the Island of Stability will have wondrous applications as alloys or chemical compounds, but be rather unimpressive in their pure elemental form.
I'll bet if you inject a little gluon into an atomic nucleus, you could hold together an atom with over 118 protons.
I would be very surprised if element 122 were to appear in the same column as Rutherfordium. If it is ever found, I would expect it to be below Thorium, in another series corresponding to the lanthanides and actinides (unless yet another widening of the table occurs, possibly after element 120). By the way, has a final decision been made about whether lanthanum or lutetium should be below yttrium?
Ask Bob Lazar.

Chemistry is wondrous and in some ways pure magic. Oxygen+oxygen is crucial to life, but swap one with carbon and it's instead lethal. Advancing our understanding of chemistry, akin to unveiling new parts of reality, is worth any cost.
Hey idiots.   Aliens are on earth.  There is no Fermi paradox.
** "Sugdeeznutzium" Missed opportunity 🤦
Does mixing believes like religion and physiology phrlosershy .you fink create sicene
5:42 and 10:40 minor correction: Technetium-96 does not have a half life of 51 minutes. That's Technetium-96m. Technetium-96 has a half life of roughly 4,28 days.  Great video, though. Thanks for the consistently great and informative content!
2:30 Huh why is technetium not actually found in nature?  *spends the next 10 minutes googling*  3:25 Man... I should have just watched the video
I’d like to think that considering elements become insanely unstable after Element 100, if we were to discover new elements, they wouldn’t be heavier, but rather they would be elements that break the trends established by the period table, or don’t follow the behaviors and rules of the currently known elements. I think an element can be new not by being heavier, but by being different.
(t=5:59) Sorry if someone else pointed this out already, but if the pattern of orbitals continues then elements 121, 122, etc  would not be d-block elements and probably not f-block either, they would be a whole new type of orbital.
This is the most new chemistry I've learned since my GCSE - I'd heard of the island and stuff but not the shells of protons and neutrons and wow that seems pretty important. Why did they not teach us that?
I think he’s taken a step closure to proving reality is just a simulation. The “Nuclear Shell Magic Numbers” chart is strangely reminiscent of a binary table.  Has anyone ever done a 3d model or representation of the Periodic Table of Elements? Such a model would have to bring some new insights. If only to learn, there was nothing to learn. Thanks for the great videos! Entertaining and uber informative- Jason Burchell
There is no such thng as "one of the first" any more than there is "one of the only" .   "One of first few"   and  "one of the very few" allows clarity as well as demonstrating good grammer.
"Are there Undiscovered Elements Beyond The Periodic Table?" - Uhhhhh... Space is infinite, and we can barley research our own solar system, so I am going with..... YES on this! LOL ;)
You forgot to mention Chinesium ,it's like steel but cheaper with funny properties, it's true that atomic dynamics are strange and complex and probably something else is going on too ,
Keep up the good work my man
What about Vibranium, Beskar, and Naquadah?
Yes..... Ukraine 🤤
What about elements made of other fermions?
theoretically, what would oganesson taste like?
It never ocurred to me before, but for example when two hydrogen atoms combine to form a hydrogen molecule, what happens if both electrons have the same spin?  Does one of them swipe left and keep looking?
Are there any elements with no use at all?
We need that stable version of element 115 asap. That elerium
NEW ELEMENTS JUST DISCOVERED !!! Just recently discovered are FOUR new heavy metals, thanks to development of the revolutionary new PLASMA REACTOR (new GREEN method of generating electricity 24/7 cheaply) by AUREON ENERGY LIMITED.

Element zero does exist, it is formed of free netrons, and usually called mononeutron matter by particle physicists. It has also been called neutronium (symbol Nu or -).  There are also at least two exotic elements, positronium (Ps) and muonium (Nu), they form compounds similarly to hydrogen, but are a lot lighter. They and their compounds have been given names by the IUPAC, but sadly they have not been recognized as elements. Another exotic element that may exist is tauonium.
0.69 ms, nice
Sci-fi authors have so many opportunities to take inspiration from these unproved elements and and their qualities. I’d love to read a sci-fi novel written in the last ten years that built upon what we have learned in the past century.
could we detonade sun by throwing into it very dense material from continent of stability? I mean aliens could do that for us...
there is a scifi book by Douglas Preston that is based on this. Fascinating stuff. The Ice Limit.
Future being 1: Did you know that the old ones for millennia couldn’t communicate with each other? They had different so-called “languages” and different ones were almost always unintelligible. Future being 2: Gosh, that’s stupid. Why did they do this? What purpose did that serve? Future being 1: Historians say they were there from the beginning and they just didn’t bother to create a universal means of communications.
sugdesium
I haven't watched yet, but I'm going to say yes
Yes.. there are more elements as well as a third 'level' to the periodic table
Fantastic video!
Is this even a legit question? Of course there are! To state otherwise is to say that we know ALL the elements and that is just idiotic hubris at work.
It's poetic. Reminded me of Carl Sagan in Cosmos: "We discover hints of these islands of possibility just beyond the bounds of the known. What can we do but hold our breaths and leap towards them, hoping to gain new ground in humanity's journey to further and future horizons of space time."
11:24 Such an unhappy nucleus. 13:55 "Why should we even try to get to the island of stability?" Because the plants and animals that live there are unlike anything you've ever imagined before.
I’m just observing. The entire universe as an element and part of many.
My comments are mostly on Matt's comment responses. I've probably mentioned this before, but my own "head canon" solution to the Fermi Paradox is that, grabby or not, it's just too expensive to venture much beyond your own solar system. Heck we made it to our own moon but after a few trips it's been another 50 years before we've made any effort to go back again. Asteroids may well be rich enough in elements rare on Earth to be profitable to mine, but have we really made any effort to do so? We've thought of more than one way to potentially reach other stars but the distances are so vast that implementing any of them is too expensive to contemplate until we get a better idea of exactly what's out there, so we wait for exoplanet searches to get detailed enough to be able to tell us more than the scant details we have now. In short, I don't think we'll find the Great Filter in the realm of biology or physics, but in economics.
If u say no u are just nieve . The universe is massive and always growing yeah there sure are a wack load of new elements hope we humans bever get to see em or use em probly mean war for us all . Greasy governments
I can't believe "Wonderflonium" didn't make the cut during the intro.
Really interesting episode, thanks.
I'm pretty sure that legendary mithril is really platinum. As for undiscovered elements, they would be hopelessly heavy and unstable. This is why it drives me nuts every time some lazy writer puts, "It's not even in our periodic table.", in their script. Undiscovered compounds yes, but undiscovered elements no.
Element Zero actually exists... It's Neutronium - what Neutron stars are made of...
Hey this is coming from a Code Black, whatever that means in science fiction. It'll be O.K., that's a promise from God. If you're not O.K. know that you are destined for the Kingdom of Heaven. It's a habitable supradimension beyond logic or English expression. Just wanted to lay down some hope and make it quantum parsable for your Fermi Paradox sufferers. Know that there is a solution for every paradox. It stars with "and then." e.g. God created a rock so big he couldn't move it, and then he moved it. Be a creator, what can you "and then" with a paradox!?
I play minecraft xD
Americium has been amazing historically, but its time will probably be coming to an end. LED + Optical Sensor based smoke detectors are far more accurate at detecting smoldering fires much earlier than older Americium detectors. It absolutely served a great run though
The element combinations are also important and may lead to the real chemistry that moves us to the future
Obviously yes.
Is that ~reaallly~ how you pronounce "Mendeleev" and "technetium"? At the risk of sounding like the world's worst pedantic wanker, that really bugged me ... and kinda ruined the video.
shouldn't this question be "Are there Undiscovered Elements Beyond the Event Horizon of Black Holes (or in the cores of non-main sequence stars)"?
"Blow'me'ium" 😆
Yes and no.  Yes, because we can keep smashing protons together to forge new elements.  No, because the mythical "region of stability" does not exist, and no element will ever be stable beyond a certain point.  It's like dark matter, or aether.  It doesn't exist.
The problem with elements in this "island of stability" is that this is relative to its neighbors. They'd still likely be fiercely radioactive. Even if they were completely stable and useful in some way it would be tremendously expensive to make so in the end would be nothing more than fodder for a few research papers and a Nobel prize in chemistry.
Does more pressure also take effect in element stability? if they do does that mean if we had a bigger planet we'd find less stable element?
The hypothetical table shown in 6:09 makes no sense in two ways: First, obviously, the row below the actinoids is missing; there’s no reason to believe that it won’t exist in period 8. Second, it’s likely that there exists a whole new set of 18 elements between element 120 and eka-actinium (eka = the one below) that fill the 5g-orbital.
The larger the elements that we find, I imagine the more data we have to rectify gravity in the quantum realm. I’m excited to reach an island of stability.
I think there should be 153 although we have 118
I think and most other members of the physics community likely disagree but i believe it’s brash arrogance and ignorance to assume so much like no new elements or likelihood of other species, ability for exceptions in physics. Too rigid most of the community is and that’s always disappointed me. I’m much more flexible minded and i believe that leads to more knowledge than purposefully being closed in.
Elerium 115!
Of course there are, but they are radioactive and decay too fast for stability. Would need to find a stable form
Much better video.
my brain hurts
Coooool
For the intro question “Is it really possible that new elements exist beyond the periodic table?” the answer is no, because the periodic table contains all chemical elements by definition. We might not have discovered and named them yet, but we won’t find a chemical element and say that there is no place in the periodic table for it.
So why is Tritium or super heavy hydrogen with one proton two neutrons unstable and Helium 3 is stable with two repulsive protons and just one neutron?
How about the related electron shells. The nucleus will be built up and will take electrons too but that has not been mentioned. Anything interesting on that front?
My Favorite Gay Tuber! ❤️
The fifth element obviously
The fact that you used the half life video game symbol while speaking about the half life of elements touched me to my core.
Dark Matter?
Why are there such vast differences in properties between adjacent elements on the periodic table? At the pressures and temperatures on Earth's surface, Helium is an inert gas and Lithium is a solid grey metal, even though they are only one proton apart. Mercury is a liquid at terrestrial temperatures and pressure, yet surrounded by more traditional metals. Are adjacent elements more similar in the vacuum and temperature of space? Do any other properties (other than the number of protons) scale linearly as you move up the periodic table?
I don’t know if I am reaching. But after reading a bit about the last physics noble prize. I think it can be used to prove telepathy exists.
Smoke detectors may not be necessary if we make buildings out of completely fireproof materials. The Earth's crust contains superfluous volumes of granite. Nuclear power plants have bi-products necessary for the production of nuclear weapons, which is the only motivation for their use when geothermal power is A: always on; the Earth's core does not intermittently cool down. B: extremely hot; more than hot enough to turn our primitive turbines with steam, and C: produces no bi-products convenient for fascists. (Carbon emissions, atom bomb fuel, etc.)   The recent climate bill we got is a joke, an obvious and perfunctory red herring to shut people up without actually changing a thing because wind and solar CANNOT replace fossil fuels. Fascism is an element of american society we cannot afford to pander to in the slightest.
If such an island exists, how come we have never found any in nature? Would a supernova not be enough to create an atom of the island?
Speaking of Minecraft, that graph for nuclear stability in the elements looks a lot like a ravine! This makes me wonder about how "deep" the middle is and how "shallow" the outer edges would be. Perhaps Iron is one of those deep elements and hydrogen one of the more shallow ones. Maybe there is a hydrogen like element on the other end of the ravine that has similar properties and thus "ends" the ravine! A slash through time and space, with edges to define it.
What’s up with element 115 in the UFO community? Any chance it could ever be turned into a stable fuel source?
The original self-sampling assumption did not use the anthropic principle, but the "Turing universal machine-"thropic" principle. Universal machines/numbers cannot know which computations support them in the arithmetical reality, but they can know that, below their substitution level, they are determined by a statistics on all relative computations, structured by the self-reference logic of the sound universal+ machines (Gödel-Löb-Solovay). The observable is an invariant for all universal numbers.
I imagine there are a finite number of atoms possible, with the limiting factor being exactly how many protons there are in the entirety of reality. So... yes, there's more than 118 or so.
if so there too tooo heavy to build any thing out of
We need Naquadah to build Stargates.
We have discovered a new element: Screwupfairyum. I would like to take credit, but as with many great scientific discoveries, it was an accidental discovery.
I have like a -10 understanding when it comes to elementary particles. However, it would be extremely cash money if there was a separate way of the quark thingies combining such that it creates and entirely new periodic table for us to discover and utilize.
In regards to synthesising the theoretical super heavy elements. Is the most feasible way to create them mining neutron stars and harvesting them from the matter disintegrating outside of the star’s gravity.     Or start heavily investing into hydraulic press technology.
Bohr Rutherford diagrams help disassociate the super position to a numb level of understanding at the least.
Find a 4th generation Star and you shall have your new elements...
Orchilium isn't a lye
What about elements made from muons and nucleons made from top and bottom quarks? Could those have half lives long enough to be detected?
Not undiscovered just not revealed.
Life emerged very fast on earth so I dont think its that far fetched to think that life is just a chemical emergence thats common in the universe.
If you're interested in this subject, I suggest you seatch YT for "The man who tried to fake an element".  It is amazing.
Can be rename element 115 Lazarium?
So, what makes nuclei stable or not is magic.
I wonder how much similarity there is between nucleons arranging themselves into their most efficient (and sometime unstable) configuration and protein folding.
I love the sci fi elements u started with. Mithril made me smile
Unobtainium. Used to recharge to dilithium crystals and provide 1.21 gigawatts to power the flux capacitor. 😊
can't wait till we find out what the fifth element is
i learn alot in this video , than in my HS and college Chemestry days lol
Isn't dilithium just two Lithium atoms?
You missed Vibranium !!
Well, dirllium certainly exists, but unobtainium doesn't.  ;-)
In Scotland we got jobidonium
in the islands of stability -- is that "dark matter" what if it absorbs rather than reflects light and energy as we detect them with telescopes and radio telescopes ?
Nature has no boundaries
I think the answer may be more simple and complex when we look at nucleus stability. If we consider how many quarks are within a nucleus based on neutron/proton pairing, we can note the imbalance there. Perhaps the key to 'new elements' has more to do with the pairing of sub-sub atomic particles, rather than the usage of protons/neutrons in the entire atomic system.
Hi, thanks for this awesome video! Can you talk about grids next time? :) for example how grids (hexagonal, tetragonal, cubix volume centered, etc.) are changing the propoerties of a material!
Baloneyum,.......I think Oscar Mayer has had that covered for the past 80+ years.
Woah, how did you guys leave out Vibranium? Wakanda 4Ever!
Only a soulless dimwit would think all human technology has discovered is all there is. Only someone in an unbreakable box of ego will think like that. The reason is thinking comfort is the same as accuracy.
Of course there are undiscovered elements, Like: Naquadah, Naquadria, and Vibrainium
What about atoms made up of anti-matter, or of particles made from different colors or flavors of quarks?  I imagine anything we've seen is highly unstable but presumably we currently have no means of even trying to simulate the creation of "strange iron" out of different types of omega baryons or something.
what about vibranium?
The graphic at 6:00 is incorrect.  After 119 and 120, 121 should appear below  actinium; or perhaps, in its own newer group like lanthanum that has 14 or so followers  before the  element below actinium.  Of course, this large and the shells of electrons could form other patterns altogether.  7:34 How sure are you of the fact that the strong force stays negative (attractive) over the distance  less than 2-3 femtometers?  II've heard (I'm an engineer; I have to take physics by spoonfuls)  that below 1.8 fm, the normative radius of a proton, the for becomes weaker and eventually also repelling, giving the proton and neutron their ball shapes and pseudo-identity at that distance.  It seems if teh force gets stronger, it will smash the proton and neutron into nothingness.
17:03 the issue is probability. Probability emerges from geometry. I.e. you actually need to have another example of life, at least, to do meaningful probability. But worse still, probability is just that. Why would you be surprised to be the exception? You should only be surprised if geometric evidence leads you to think you are NOT the first. And here, our data is skewed by the fact we have no other tree of life discoveries, and that we just simply do not have enough evidence.  So are we the first with good evidence or are we typical but have terrible evidence? How to know but to actually discover?  In other words, and this seems to be a point that goes over everyone's head, the probability of the existence of other beings can only be informed by... the discovery of other beings. And not the context of what it takes to birth life. That's a useful probability that will help us search for life, but it is completely disconnected to the existence of life itself. As we don't actually have a direct way of checking the probability that a "habitable zone" will birth complex life.
Interesting because this is what Bob Lazar says he was working with. A stable heavy element 115. Could be bs but the US does officially claim to interact with UAP.
The name is pronounced "Medeleeeyev" not "mendelev"
Hey also Veritasium does exist But we all are unaware of its properties
5:33 It should say "more than 82 protons" because Bi with 83 is already included.
Sooooo.... Matt's saying we finally get Half Life 3 in 5730 years?
Eat your heart out Bob Lazar, ya boob.
Of course there is.... half of what we thought we knew was bullshit
OK, many thanks for a short list of factors that lead to stability, but what about the rest?  Does anyone have any resources that a science-literate non-scientist could understand?
Good topic. A welcome break from grand cosmic mysteries.
This is one of the most important channels on YouTube.
Ha, I had seen the grabby aliens video in my subscriptions while on vacation, but I was just glancing through and thought it was a different, more speculative channel I subscribe to, not a Space Time episode, until you started talking about the comments. Such a nice surprise: an extra Space Time video to go watch!
I just want to learn how to create Element 115! Edit: inexpensively...
I always imagined that the sci-fi elements mentioned were not actual elements in the periodic table but yet to be discovered compounds of various existing stable elements that end up having significantly better properties than their constituent parts. Something like how bronze is better at say making tools than copper or tin are on their own.
This episode was great 👍👍
So would an anti electromagnetic field force all elements to be stable?
Remember what Bob Lazar said about element 115? 🤣
The 'Island of Stability' may turn out to be the 'Reef of Meta-Stability' - a collection of ultra-heavy elements only discoverable at low tide, and brought to you by Facebook.
Of course there are. We're not as clever as we think we are.
I find it weird we think have all the elements in the universe on the table when we havent' even really explored anywhere much less outside our fish tank.
you define an element by its shells being filled. but any element can have different numbers of shells filled, the basis of an ion is that it is the same element with different electrons in its outer shell. So isnt the basis of an element by human definition solely based upon proton number?
My question when it comes to discovering new elements is what types of alloys can be made from them? Ever since the Bronze Age humanity has been pushing the envelope on alloys to produce stronger or less corrosive materials and given the realities of traveling through space it would seem better alloys would be hugely beneficial especially on the scale of interstellar or intergalactic travel.
Orichalcum is a real name used in the past for metal (likely related to or equal to brass), so it's nearly impossibble for it to be some high-position element that is still undiscovered.
Yes, there are. The total number is 280 (not divisible to 3, 6, 9… the are plenty of videos about 3 , 6, 9… not related to Big Depression illegal lottery). It is divisible by 7 and 8.
I can’t believe you didn’t mention vibranium
i love vibranium
There must be an element that is stable and non radioactive at, dunno, 1000-5000 protons
Love your shirt !
❤️❤️❤️
What about the 5th element?
Sugdenium Deez Nuts
Half-Life 14?! Half-Life 3 confirmee!
neutron stars are composed largely of neutrons with a peppering of protons in them (to my understanding). could a neutron star be considered a single atom, and therefore an element? held together with the aid of gravity rather than the strong force alone?
De we get any suggestive spectra from new stable heavy elements from any neutron star vecinity? Or any death star?
To say that humanity has figured out the periodic table for the entire universe is delusional u would be a complete numpty to think so
You forgot the elusive and extremely powerful "element of surprise".
We need to live long enough to see element 267 synthesized, so we can MAKE SUGDENIUM HAPPEN
Yeah as much as I enjoy stuff like this I realize that I am nowhere near smart enough to fully comprehend or even barely comprehend this.
But veritasium is very important
Technically, adamantium is an alloy made by combining steel, some unknown substance, and vibranium, which is an element.
I would have loved to hear some more about limitations in this context, like relativistic stuff and the structure of period 8.
Always curious why things humans craft are considered “unnatural” Are beaver dams or birds nests considered unnatural?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe5WT22-AO8 Very cool documentation about faking new elements : )
What are the chances that alien body parts are interchangable with human body parts (like transplants are possible)?
So why is technetium unstable?
I love this channel! Thank you so much for doing this and explaining things so succinctly and in such depth. Am burnt out on 45 minute videos explaining one basic thing.
The climate catastrophe age surely? Only common sense can save us there so no chance .
I hypostulate that there are elements before Hydrogen and our understanding of elements is imperfect.
5:01 time to play some Half-Life 2: Deathmatch
can't we do what we've been doing for more than half a century now to find these supermassive stable atoms: play sherlock on the spectra of stars?
I observe an change in the voice of Dr. Matt, So again checked the previous videos, and YES, not in all but in a few past videos (not that old-just the immediatley previous ones) have this different voice. I am pretty sure of my hearing and also remember the voice of Dr. Matt, something is going on in the audio editing.
upsiedaisyium
*N = 42; >>> process exited - return code: 0 (*N)++; >>> segmentation fault (core dumped)
The higher number elements can only be created in the nuclear reactor or by fusing two elements. The resulting nuclei is very fragile and disintegrates very fast. In some cases in milli seconds or less. Till the invention of nuclear reactors even Tc and prometheum were place holders since not available in nature.
Transformium
Would it be possible to take a neutron-soup-like substance (I am thinking neutron star) where you have an atom that is just 184 neutrons (the predicted position of stability) and just add protons and electrons 1 by 1 through the periodic table until we discover new elements?  I guess maybe I’m confused, I basically mean to ask, would carbon/oxygen/etc. be stable with this hypothetical 184 neutrons?
Do we have any good guesses about unique or useful properties of elements on the island of stability?
What if Mithril isn't a pure element? like steel. Maybe there are some awesome materials that are made from a unique processing of already discovered elements.
there is no fermi paradox the aliens are everywhere they just have a first contact thing that doesnt allow them to interact with us except the bad ones do
defining reference class is too subjective to have a meaning
Fantastic shirt
Can we talk about the negative elements? Element -1: Anti-Hydrogen Element -2: Anti-Helium Etc
The current elements could be other elements if there were means to stabilize more combinations of protons/neutrons and electrons. It already could be possible in nature except finding it would seem really rare... I mean you would basically need to scan every atom in a particular deposit of materials that were mined. There are already differences between the make-up of atoms at a sub atomic level. A discovery of an underground deposit of these stable new/same elements might also be kept a secret because of how little there might be to go around and study. I do not think it would break our current understanding, different combination of electrons around already existing elements can already be achieved.
No
Actually, don't try with the periodic table .... when looking for new "elements" we should take a look on what might be exotic matter ---- neutrino free environment etc.
hmmm Netherite
What about Neutronium…as there would be no electromagnetic repulsion
Perfect shirt for the episode <3
why are many metals silver? and why is gold gold?
You forget chinesium, the weakest element, at the beginning.
Yes, there are absolutely more. Binary star systems would form heavier and even more fissionable elements. So we know for certain there are.
I've been pronouncing it "tek-NEE-shium"...
Commenting about the end card rather than the main video might not be a strong move, but here I go.  From a certain perspective we already are Lovecraftian monsters.  Humans have destroyed and and taken over large parts of the earth, and in no unambiguous way made the climate on the planet more unstable. It's really bad for us in a lot of ways but we still do it.  For an outside observer our behaviour might seem completely irratic as we continue to act in a way that destroys both us and the life around us. As an example: For a long time we created buildings that spewed black acidic smoke into the atmosphere so that we could sit in relatively isolated in enclosed environments of our own making to watch lights radiate of off a block of various dangerous or toxic materials that might kill us if we touched it the wrong way.  In some ways we still do.
If our current processes (bombarding the elements with nutreons, protons, etc.) are not sufficient to create some "magical" superheavy elements that should be in the "island of stability" region, what possible artificial processes could there be? What could you do to something that you take, in order to get what you want? What are the main ideas of "how to get there"? How scientifically sound are they? Is it even possible, or is there some natural law that prohibits just adding more stuff (like if you add more and more mass to an object, it collapses into a black hole) to a nucleus?  There is a pretty big list of hypothetical elementary and composite particles with some suggested properties. Do any of them even enable us to get to the "island of stability"? Or do we know too little (or do we make up too little) to get a rigorous descripton of how to obtain a superheavy element with a superheavy nucleus with a very specific structure?
What would happen if we placed electrons inside a shell of protons and neutrons?  Would it make protons more likely to stay together since they would be attracted to negatively charged electrons between them? Would electrons leave the confines of that shell?
was this video inspired by bobbybroccoli's video "The Man Who Tried To Fake An Element"? /Qe5WT22-AO8
Within a single isotope of an atom, are there still different geometrical version of it, with different geometric arrangements of protons and neutrons? Are some of them more stable than others? Or are all nuclei with a certain amount of protons and neutrons identical?
Humanity becoming a cosmic horror that obliterates anything that comes after isn't the *worst* outcome imaginable
Ah yes. Government subsidized Information. Thanks PBS
You forgot eternium and vibranium .
you seriously picked iron bar instead of a netherite bar for your example of netherite?
Pretty sure it's pronounced tek-ne-she-um, and not tek-net-ium.  Otherwise enjoyable as usual.
matt it’s techneSHum not technettyum
you forgot emeril from no man's sky, imagine that was real, a star burning at 0 degrees kelvin.
I would have thought that if such an island of stability existed, then those elements would have been detected in the merger of neutron stars, where an Earth's mass of gold was detected. Since no new or unexpected elements were detected then it would suggest they don't/can't exist. Right?
This is one of those few episodes of Space Time I can almost completely understand, but I had known about the island for like a decade or more so I had some time to wrap my brain around it.
Another great video Dr O'Dowd . I was just watching a closely related video about super heavy elements being created in cyclotrons just yesterday see here for the link, enjoy!  https://youtu.be/kg0AN8bZ4us
Finally an episode I can understand 🙂
Give Bob Lazar a call. I'm sure he'd love to pick your brain on the topic 👽😀. Great vid as usual . Thank you.
Are you your mental experience? The old one's are tired of the metaphysical rhetoric in the simulation and are debating termination.
Infortunately no mention of nuclear isomers, because the picture is more complicated, you can have two nuclei of the same isotopes and elements and they can be different, in the way their components are positioned.
Loving the Minecraft periodic table t-shirt!
You kinda missed an opportunity to collab with Periodic Videos
it's time for new elementssss
Diamondillium
Maybe Technetium isnt unstable, just every decay leads to something so much more stable and prefered that it cant be stable?
I found two ,science can't make them yet. The environment supports .you said it . More environments more elements. Thermal pressure , vacuum etc make different elements. Earth   maybe no use but space or other planets.
AT 7:20 why do the protons decay into neutrons, while in the carbon 14 example, it was neutrons  into protons? I thought protons do not decay, or at the very least, take an unimaginable amount of time?
I have the same T-shirt! 😀 (Yes, and fine episode as always...^^)
Half-life 3, when?
They last about as long as you do in bed... in your dreams.
Mythril is Silver FYI
So I will comment on the Last point perhaps the one solvent that we know has no equal is water.  So once life gets started in the water to kill that life off you would need to get rid of the water entirely. Life finds a way once the right conditions are met. Think of yourself what do you do when it's a do or die situation you find a way to live. It's inherent in every living thing on earth weather it be a single cell or multier if that's a word lol. So when we look for other life we know what the main ingredient is Water 💧.  Until we see otherwise and if you hear otherwise it's a load of malarkey. And in our galaxy life does exist everywhere it can.
Can you come up with a more PC  word than unstable?  I'm joking,  but this will soon be a thing.  Nuclear instability
Dear PBS Space-time team, Please make an episode on plasma wakefield accelerators
3:03 I think you pronounced  Technetium wrong not that I have any problem with that.
shadowban test
Dynamic didn't happen on Earth everywhere. Primates appeared in Africa. But things went very different and distinct way in Australia. So it isn't just similar conditions to Earth. One step left or one step right and whole dynamics would be completely different, yet conditions would be similar.
Kryptonite and dilithium aren't elements.  :)
Love the new Half Life symbol lol.  Valve would be proud
I ask my self if darkmatter is a Element of that high up numbers so heavy light bend around it and dont be reflekted or absorbt. But that is a probly mistake of me.
What about getting stable matter from second, third and so on generation of leptons?
Well mithril was never an element but an alloy, historically speaking.(it'd be weak in real life but better than its original elements it was created from)
It seems to me less an island of stability so much as a seamount of stability. A lot higher up toward stability than the surrounding abyssal plains, sure, but still almost certainly not high enough to rise above the water and give us any dry land to build on you feel?
18:50 That is interesting logic, but by that logic we hav to assume that we are all boltzman brains. You existance is finite and there are only final possbilties for civilizations since we eventually reach heatdeath of universe. But boltzman brains can occure even after heat death of universe. While boltzman brain occuring is very unlikely in any imaginable but finite time frame, but on infinite time frame boltzman brain is guranteed, more over infinite time infinite boltzman brains are guranteed. So if we assume your existance is random sampling from all possible life forms that have ever existed and boltzman brains, by propability it's safe to assume you are boltzman brain.
I highly recommend Technology Connection's video on smoke detectors!
I love the content but not the host.
Try looking in that big gap between hydrogen and helium
I propose Spacetimium for the next stable element
Patrick raises hand: is neutron star an element?
6:00 there seems ot be a lack of udnerstanding in decay model thus there is.. lack of deduction to put together... the why.. this and that. of million verse minutes.. and can yield why and how a stabiltiy of a system occurs within system, which can be stalbized through various environements its subject to. well that is rather vague.. but there is like the answer is there, but the question isn't being asked. or so not htought about... once you ahve enough data, you should be able to map the entire system with a very good degree of accuracy... c-14.. unstable. and this is why, isn't wuite correc,t beucase you could make any isotope of an element stable.. but depedning ona systems enviroenemtn depends on teh stabiltiy... so is this alltested in a vacuum? without light... how to photons effect a system..  what causes 5700 years, can one accelearate that process... IE a proton smasher, makign whatever elelment you want.. but then one could make gold easily, but taking other elements in mass or any matter theyw watned by moving the isotope nature of various elelmetns around, and skipping over harder/ or more stable systems hmm
I’m sorry, but Tc96 has an half-life of 4 days, not 51 minutes. The lowest half-life of Tc isotopes is Tc99m with an half-life of around 6 hours.
entropy is strong force
Computronium
I want his shirt
Netherite is an alloy
Ingots of gold-pressed latinum in portable quantities will do.
Shoutout to element 115
There certainly is
Missed opportunity to name an element sugondesium
I'm hoping we can synthesise more Australium after it all got stolen in the 60s.
Veratasium 🤣😂😅
Ask Bob Lazar....he knows.
If dark matter does indeed exist and is many times more abundant than baryonic matter as the hypothesis suggests,  maybe there also exist a variety of dark matter elements.
Quality as always space time!
Tc- 10e57 is pretty stable
It's possible.  These elements just haven't been discovered in the Universe yet.
Perhaps these new elements could be so dense that the wall of the spaceship, made from them, could block all that dangerous space radiation, even near light speed. However, even then, visiting stars still takes too long to be practical.
Of course lol
🔥🔥
No one expects the Spanish Inquisition!  On a side note, this is just a random thought I had.   what if all the particles and elements that exist today are just stepping stones for something much bigger. What if everything we know is just the first part of the universe. What if the universe fundamentally changes one day just like it did at the Big Bang? Maybe the expansion gets too big of something happens with dark matter or anything like that. Who knows what can really happen.   I don’t know if what I said made any sense, but it was a random though I had literally just now. I think it’s a fun thought experiment.

I found the recent BobbyBroccoli video that deep dives into the history of finding artificial elements absolutely fascinating
It would seem that the vast chasms of space that separate us from just our nearest neighbors in the Milky Way galaxy preclude us from interacting or even knowing about other life forms. And that assumes that intelligent life even exists in other star systems. Planet earth has so many unique factors that are conducive to life, and we don’t see them anywhere else in our own solar system:                                       Just the right mass - just the right distance from our sun - just the right steady burning Sun - one moon just the right size and distance from our planet - an enormous neighbor planet that provides a gravity deflection for large objects in the Oort cloud that are perturbed out of their orbits - just the right angle of axis to the suns ecliptic plane - water, water, water as ice, liquid, and vapor.  Given the number of stars and galaxies we can observe there may be other planets that share these characteristics. But that doesn’t guarantee intelligent beings have or will ever evolve there. For the vast majority of earth’s biological history there were only giant stupid reptiles and birds who made a meal or snack of any evolving primates - the Chicxulub asteroid that hit 66 million years ago wiped out that class of predators. Finally our ancestors could roam the earth and evolve free of immanent death every time one went outside. If another similar sized asteroid hit tomorrow it could end our existence as well. So timing and luck amidst a host of independent phenomena had to be in place for us to evolve. How often do these factors come together in the universe? Probably not too often, perhaps never. And we are still quite a ways from being able to confirm that on our own. And while we remain a prickly ethnocentric species easily swayed by superstition and myth, moving toward an enlightened future is going to be pretty slow.
At one time, before I earned my degrees in biochemistry, I was tantalized by the idea of the island of stability. Now, I very much doubt that super-heavy atoms will have any properties that are unique to them that are not found in their periodic counterparts among the known elements. Besides a high likelihood of radioactivity that is. Unless we find strange quarks or other fundamental particles play a much larger role in the formation of atomic nuclei, that then has a downstream affect on electron clouds and orbitals. That is doubtful. Their uses would probably be based completely on having a greater mass while maintaining a similar chemistry to that of lighter metals in the same group. It is unlikely that they will display any metalloid or non-metal characteristics, making them even less interesting. While I certainly support trying to find such elements, purely for the greater scientific understanding it may provide, I very much doubt they will have any meaningful impact on material science or have any genuine uses that would justify the costs of production.
I literally screamed when the Half-Life logo appeared 😭💞💞💞💞
If you are interested in the modern history of the search for new elements I recommend BoobyBroccoli's "The man who tried to fake an element".
Hey Matt,  Thank you for being the host of PBS Space Time. I've been watching for quite some time now and I feel like I get smarter every time!   It feels weird to have been watching for a while because it makes me feel kind of at home with you as a host, which is a parasocial thing, but then again, all that we consider a relationship is just a representation of an image in our minds.  A thank you to you and the PBS Space Time team for keeping this channel running!   It's a really great source of information and, in that, it's a really nice contrast from the news or media, which is oftentimes coloured by emotions and superficial reasons.  PBS Space Time is only coloured by the emotion of wonder and is otherwise coloured by science, which is a very stable and comforting way to think about the world.  Thank you.
Talking about elements like they are particles instead of waves 😒🤪
I understand skepticism from chemists regarding new elements, but I expect the same scientists readily accept new properties from the existing table.  What we have seen carbon do while surprising, shouldnt shock chemists.  In fact I believe we will see further properties from every element
99ôpøy77o⁷⁹⁹7⁶⁸6
Definitely need a video on the strong nuclear force, until a few weeks ago I had no idea it was different than the strong force!
Petition to name one of the elements obamium
Ah! The elemement of surprise
Seems like PBS doesn't want to receive money if they ridicule their donors by promising non-existant rewards.
Have you heard of Przybylski's Star? Its a chemically peculiar star who's spectrum seems to have short lived actinides such as Californium and Einsteinium at some level of abundance. The only reasonable source of these unstable isotopes is an undiscovered, slowly decaying superheavy element concentrated in the star. Personally, I think that Przybylski's Star got its superheavy elements when two neutron star companions merged and threw massive amounts of unstable elements everywhere as a black hole formed.
Anything special about element 115?
Mithril might actually be a carbon alloy compound
Can quantum computers can help simulating nucleus with large number of nucleons?
Tis but unobtainium
sugdenium nuts
I think the Copernican Principle is generally overstated. It shouldn't be that we _cannot_ be in a special place in the universe; it's that we _must not assume_ we are, but rather begin from the assumption that we are not. Since that's the most likely state of affairs, we must assign is a very high prior probability.  But to adhere to the Copernican Principle regardless of how much evidence stacks up against it in this or that domain, is to be as rigidly dogmatic as the church fathers Copernicus was bold enough to contradict.
Hi Matt, can u nake a vid about negative temperatures in the future? Thx
The hunt for the island of stability by @BobbyBroccoli: https://youtu.be/Qe5WT22-AO8?t=1770
9:45 Nuclei “prefer” one (at least) of the three cases given here?  The only case ruled out here is odd + odd = odd. (Nope). Yes but as the rest of this section discusses, it’s more complicated than this.
Very good information in this video. Thank you.
That "netherite" at the beginning got me.  Edit: And of course he has the glorious periodic table of minecraft shirt.
Can we use the simulations & graph to predict where the _"island"_ of any new stable super-heavy elements may fit on the periodic table (& thus make some educated guesses about their potential properties)..?  For example, having stable elements with great density would be exceedingly useful in space exploration - both as an external shield against higher energy ionising solar/cosmic radiation &/or as a potential energy converter solar panel of solar radiation...  Also using highly dense elements to synthesise useful lower elements - eg: *Osmium, Iridium* - which are difficult to obtain through other means.
15:10   About Americium and smoke detectors ..... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuAeaIcAXtg
The first application of new stable elements we discover should be fidget spinners
Sugdenium souds like it's related to Sugondese...
9:44 "an even number of protons, or an even number neutrons, or an even number of protons plus neutrons" aren't these all the options? If both the number of protons and the number of neutrons are odd, then the sum is even.
What's the 'dark forest' solution?
Unobtanium is not fictional. I just haven't got any.
5:22  mystery voice
Tiberium.
Mmmmm fried Bolognium
Forgot Nth metal.
Noble gases CAN form chemical compounds. Xenon fluorides have some industrial uses. Others elements' compounds tend to be increasingly unstable, requiring such things as low temperatures and/or high pressures. (YouTube makes it awkward to search old comments, so sorry if this was already mentioned.)
18:25 my reference class is a set containing just one element, namely me. It's great because it means I'm never surprised by anything
4:57 Should it not be an anti neutrino? Because a neutron decays into a proton, electron and anti-neutrino in beta negative decay, whereas neutrinos and anti-electrons are made in beta+ decay. It is interesting how one quantum field particle changes to others to conserve certain properties. Nature is truly elegant and beautiful.
.
> It was discovered, but not in Nature.  Was it discovered in The Journal of Physical Chemistry?
Could there be an alternate way of putting together something that resembles matter in some properties?
the subtitle of this episode should have been called "50 shades of decay"
In recent times that elusive and to date unidentified missing element has simultaneously revealed itself across the globe.  UNOBTAINIUM.
Hi. I am the world most lazy fantasy author, for I have developed a lot of stories and lore but have written nothing. In my own world, Adamantium, Mithril, Digedanium, Endurium etc are simply isotopes of well known atoms, but with magic neutrons. E.g. Mithril is a magic isotope of silver with the mass number of 108, but two of the neutrons are magic, therefor it is stable and has all the awesome properties. 😮
Maybe because 43 is a prime number, this could mean Technetium is nature’s prime unstable element anomaly
0.69ms half-life, NICE!
Krypton Neon Radon Xenon Beton
43 is not only the smallest atomic number of a never-stable element, but it's also the highest number of Chicken McNuggets you cannot purchase (they come in groups of 6, 9 and 20). Coincidence?
Does it mean that island of stability still holds hope for discovering Naquadah so that we can build Stargate? 👀
Slight correction at 3:35. You mention that Technetium and all the heavier elements are produced in the core of giant stars and then they find their way into the rest of the cosmos via supernovae. However, it is only elements lighter and up to iron that can be forged via nuclear fusion in a star's core. After iron, there is less energy given off in fusion and therefore the star cannot sustain itself and the core collapses causing a supernova. It is during the supernova explosion that all elements heavier than iron are created.  Edit: So I forgot to add that some heavier elements can still be made via slow neutron capture and proton capture in a stars plasma, but as far as fusion goes it is only up to iron that is fused in a star's core.
Netherite is an alloy
I love the physics but chucking in some chemistry was awesome.
Forgot naquadah.  Which in Stargate continuity actually does exist in the hypothesized island of stability.  In the show it's described as not existing in Earth's solar system.
Could you please do a video about meta materials also? When I think of sci-fi materials, that’s what I think of.
I’m more concerned with the bizarre pronunciation of detritus.
Why is proton decay so rare if (it happens at all) compared to neutron decay? And can Element Zero (a bundle of neutrons by itself) actually exist?
I'm probably late to the party with this fanciful thought, but I find it fascinating that the magic numbers 2 & 8 would explain why binary star systems have been the most common systems we have seen through our observations, and that in our very stable solar system has eight planets orbiting the Sun. The macro imitates the micro. :P
Shouldn't this video mention Schrodinger or Bohr somewhere?
You forgot Vibranium!! Haha
You forgot Divinium
Remember element 115, the stable isotope, has the ability to create and manipulate gravitational fields when accelerated  to near light speeds. We've yet to make a stable version yet though 🤔
So is there a possiblity that there is another form of proton or neutron what makes a element more stable by adding them to the mix by being less influenced of the in nucleus forces? Or is there a non polar form that by adding to the element takes a factor 3 out of the callus of neutrons or protons. So that a element as technicium becomes stable?
Two common properties that most fictional elements have are being lightweight and extremely durable (mostly metals.) These are properties that we shouldn't expect from elements in the "island of stability", particularly the former. Quite the opposite; they'll be the heaviest materials above degenerate matter and neutron-star matter. They may in fact be used for their extreme density because of that.  Perhaps instead of creating new elements to serve the purposes of making indestructible armor and weapons for scifi-fantasy stories, composite materials made of common lighter elements like carbon and silicon should be used. Carbon nano-fibers for example may be able to have all the properties of the most amazing materials in science fiction and much more.
Absolutely loved the netherite at the start
Wow I legit had that periodic table of Minecraft T-shirt at one point 😂
One can possibly detect new elements in Mendelev:)
I think artificial element is an incorrect term. Any element that we can synthesize is natural (otherwise we wouldn't be able to synthesize them). It's just we have to synthesize them to get them because we don't have any laying around Earth.
Lord I love that shirt, where can I get one
It was at 5:05 when I realized that c^14 on the front of the original Half-Life box was not "speed of light to the 14th", but, in fact, ... carbon-14. MY WHOLE LIFE IS A LIE.
A week ago i was watching a clip with 3D representation of stability island graph. Trend?
i EXCHANGE one Informational Singularity for one Gauss
Regarding the "Dark Forest" solution to the Fermi Paradox that you mentioned at the end: That is one of the most easily dismissed hypotheses in the set, because the universe is NOT a dark forest. First of all, it's always daytime in space; secondly, there's so little tactical cover in space that we have direct line-of-sight to locations literally billions of light-years distant. The universe has more in common with a savannah at noon after a brush fire. Nothing can hide in space.
Thought provoking stuff!
+1 for half-life logo 😍👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
For the future of humanity and/or humanoids, I still believe theology (classic theology, based on the love of God and the golden rule) will have a defining say in that picture.  There wouldn't be any need to colonize the whole universe with these beings "in this life" though some theological followings adopt elements of this idea.  At any rate, these complex and yet intriguing properties of our material world can in legitimate philosophy be seen as reflecting some all embracing purpose.  I wouldn't call the investigation of the consequences thereof to be "space time" but science, which itself has already elucidated both space and time and combinations thereof, and may have considerably more room to do more.  Science itself is simply a corollary of a mandate to subdue the (wild) creation.  To subdue (or tame, or harness) something without destroying it, one needs to understand it: hence, science.
Element 115 can control gravity
Love the Minecraft representation
When I was doing my master, I wanted to do a paper on the potential stable form of Tc (Technetium) my profession told me, "don't, if you want to be respected, don't touch this topic".   I still don't understand why he gave me that comment today...
Nice t-shirt!
we need netherite
I wonder.  Have we found any additional elements on the moon or on Mars?
minecraft is GAY
Yes, keep adding electrons and protons. you get rarer and more expensive elements and in theory it can continue until singularity-level densities have been reached. as for adamantium as thich video started with i think not... unless the international committee decides to name an element adamantium instead of say.. seaborgium.
Just saying, your present experience of your existence does not preclude previous, future, or concurrent experiences of which you may be presently unaware.  You show incredible imagination envisioning the potential for islands of stability of unknown heavy elements/isotopes (something I had not previously thought of).  Why not be imaginative when contemplating consciousness, existence, awareness.
Fascinating video. AAAS Science included an article on the search for ever-heavier elements in its 2/2019 issue celebrating the 150th year of the periodic table. I don't recall a heavier island of stability being mentioned, though. If there is such an island, I would wonder how heavier elements would decay as small increments- alpha or beta decay- would yield highly unstable elements. In larger decay products or stepwise? As far as I know, Tc is not used as radiocontrast nor in CT scans as shown at 14:38 . It is rather used as a radioisotope for "nuclear imaging" (the term commonly used in medical practice.) Heart and bone scans are among those using Tc99. At some point, maybe cover nuclear isomers?
Lazarium  Only the cool kids know what I'm talking about.
Someone forgot to mention Upsidaisium.
Of course there's unknown elements. About 236 within this galaxy alone. In the whole universe about ... Also, within 12 years they'll find that some 'same' elements are actually slightly different. ;)
We are so far away from other likely civilizations and we can really only see hundreds of years out that we wouldn't really see if the milky way is inhabited let alone the countless galaxies out there. Perhaps it is our limited imagination of the vastness that is limiting our ability to understand.
We're having trouble understanding the simple stuff, so let's try to understand complex stuff.
Don’t forget about atmospherium (from The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra).
I find it confusing to define whether an element is made "in nature" or not. I would think if it can be made, regardless of the method, is that not "nature", considering the natural forces in the universe that creates all known elements?
Do elements decay faster near a strong source of neutrinos?  For example, right next to a star, not far from a supernova, or near a nuclear reactor, as compared to interstellar space? Can neutrinos catalyze decay?
What was it about the Nobel gases that prevented them from being detected when so many other lighter elements were being discovered?
Pfff, mithril is clearly an alloy.
man, I have that shirt. they should update it.
I thought he was going to talk about neutron stars being a giant atom and therefore a new element..
The next material age will be graphene. Except it will be like jumping from stone to iron age.
Ickystickium hasn’t been discovered yet but will eventually, I’m sure of it.
We know about more than 100 elements at this point, and they are listed in a _Periodic_ Table for a reason -- because their properties are periodic in nature. It is extremely likely that any new elements we find will have properties that are merely variations on well-established themes.
Hydrogen has an unstable isotope??!?!?
Phil Schneider showed element 140 at a symposium.  It can be made in high plasma from ferrite. It absorbs radar.
Island of stability...black hole or dark matter...or is black holes dark matter...
The number 137 is important -- called the Fine Structure Constant, if I'm not mistaken -- and Feynman was said to be obsessed with it. There's a theory that there can be no element with an atomic number greater than 137, which is probably true, though there are theorists who dispute that. If there IS a possibility for elements with more than 137 protons in their nucleus, I recommend that element 144 be called 'Grossium', since 12 squared is a 'gross', and as far as I know the two-letter element symbol 'Gr' hasn't been taken yet, so I suggest #144 be Grossium [Gr], and I've calculated that its most stable isotope -- based on the proportions of Protons-to-Neutrons of the most stable isotopes of the elements above its position in its column -- is probably one with 256 neutrons, so a total of 400 nucleons. Maybe in a hundred years we'll be hearing about Grossium-400 being synthesized in particle accelerators, who knows?
The Ancients I think is in reference to the Stargate series’.
Love the t-shirt.
Notably element 126 would be among the first elements to have a ground state g orbital which for all we know could throw off all our models.
I'm no chemist, so someone wiser than me should be able to point out the flaw in my reasoning. Wouldn't elements in the island of stability be incredibly difficult to work with because they're so massive? They might have interesting electron shells, but any chemical reaction would be slow or require massive amounts of energy to initiate.
Why are some  elements stable and some unstable. What is holding them together and what is making them fall apart. Are they  magnetic or something else.
Americium smoke detectors are inferior in most respects to optical smoke detectors. They do have advantages in certain limited situations, but it's not like the world would go to flames if we ran out of americium. It's not really very important as elements go. Similarly, while plutonium reactors and technetium nuclear medicine are assets to humanity, they compete with uranium and thorium reactors and with other contrast agents for radioimaging. So they aren't really game-changers. And those are readily produced in bulk quantities from highly abundant uranium and thorium. Comparing the impact of a new transuranic element on society to the impact of the invention of bronze and iron tools is silly. We're not going to enter the unbihexium age.  If we do discover an island of stability, I think it is very unlikely the elements there will have practical applications, and even if they do, those applications are likely to be very limited. After all, they will probably be much less stable and much, much, *much* more expensive than curium, which already has hardly any practical applications. Instead, I think the significance of finding the island would be basic research. It is currently unknown if the most stable nuclide in this island will have a half life of one minute or one million years. Figuring that out would greatly improve the accuracy of our nuclear models, and _that_ could be truly valuable.
Yeah, lets keep poking the Bear and find out up-close what fission and fusion really are... Who knows, if we are lucky and the blasts big enough, we might even find new elements! hehe
Seriously, Tolkien's mithril is a fictional thing.
I'm really looking forward to when we make the 126th element and it lasts 4.5 million years! Can't imagine what uses the new material will have!
I may have failed chemistry in high school but now I'm fascinated by this stuff!
I vote for naming the first 184/126 element, "Odowdinium"!! Cheers!
Oricalcum got a mention! Thankyou!!
At 20:31 -- it might be too late for the dark forest solution. We have been carelessly broadcasting radio signals for several decades already. We're all doomed.
What better way to make these super heavy elements than in neutron star mergers? And what better place to start looking for such heavy isotopes -- or their decay products -- than in our very own solar system, which itself resulted from a neutron star merger? Except, the half lives of these hypothetical elements would (likely) render the parent isotopes undetectable after 4.6 billion years. So perhaps we should be looking in the spectra of neutron star mergers instead?
I was excited to see a chemistry episode, these aren't as common on this channel as the big spacey cosmology ones (which are also fantastic).
0:59 They couldn't find Argon?? It's only the third most abundant gas in our atmosphere.
I say just vaporize some micrograms of some elements in a vacuum chamber under high pressure with high powered lasers and measure the results.
Stable isotope of 115 baby, the key to interstellar travel. Ask Bob Lazar :) Interestingly I think there is a stable isotope of 115, Moscovium, or do I have to call it Ukranium to not be censored and called a putin propagandist?  Spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories about an element named after moscow, we can’t have that.  Though it’s been over 72 hours so I doubt too many people remember anything about that russian war to stop the Ukrainian Missile Crisis (cuban missile crisis in reverse, because we can do whatever we want and anyone who dares cause us the slightest consequences is an evil racist terrorist.
69ms - nice
Modern smoke detectors don't use radioactive decay, they use an optical sensor.
I have been hoping for this episode for a while. The island of stability is a very interesting possibility and I'm very curious about the modeling that went into working it out.  Regarding Eliyah Zayin's criticism of the Copernican principle's use - Copernican principle is only useful for filling in the gaps of what you know with a probabilistic statement. It's not a firm claim that we are the most probable state, it's that of the remaining states we're most likely to be the most probable of them. This makes intuitive sense in simple terms - standing in some aisle of a grocery store when you hear the "we're closing in 5 minutes" message, you can predict that you'll probably end up somewhere in the middle of the line of all the remaining customers when you go to the checkout lane because there are more possible spaces in the middle than on the front or back of the group. If you roll 2 normal 6-sided dice you can predict that you'll probably get an even number because more of the possible outcomes are even. It only gets confusing when you take away more of the known aspects.  In this case, we THINK we know the habitable age range of the universe, which puts us as early but without knowing that, Copernican principle suggests we should be towards the middle. That leaves several unknown probabilities - the limited probability that we're just in a less common outcome in a the habitable age range that we're right about, the probability that we're wrong about the habitable age range and towards the more common part of it, the probability that we're right about the habitable age range but there are other factors that make this part of the range more likely than later, etc.   To go back to the dice example - if press a button that you're told rolls an unknown number of dice and you get mostly even numbers, all under 12 and all over 2, you can guess that it has 2 6-sided dice inside...until you roll an 87 and then begin to wonder if it's a much larger set of dice and you've just had low probability outcomes or if it's 2 6-sided dice just with 1 side with a strangely large side, or if you were just not told that periodically it will change what number of dice it has, or if you were lied to and it does something other than roll dice. Copernican principle would give you a better chance of working out which scenario you're more likely in but it's not definitive, and it's not meant to be.
VIBRANIUM….. Hello 😂
The dark forest solution seems very reasonable to me
Matt must be Oganesson because he's the real Og
5:02 Carbon is number 12, 12/3 is 4…. Half-life 3 confirmed for 2024.
The better question is are there any USEFUL elements beyond the currently known ones lol. Cause lets face it everything after plutonium has been pointless!
commenting halfway thru so maybe you explained it later on, but it would be cool to hear more about the nuclear shells. i know with electron shells it’s related to spherical harmonics (x2 because of spin), but i can’t seem to figure out a pattern for the nuclear shell numbers. probably still related to resonance in some way, since a lot of stuff with atoms and molecules seems to have a lot to do with that, but it would be awesome to have some more in depth info.
Technetium has always seemed like a clue that we should not stop synthesizing new elements. If there’s a radioactive element smack dab in the middle of the periodic table, could there be a stable element in the middle of radioactive ones?
Dilithium is real
3:16 Rhenium is correct but the subtitles show Ruthenium
no vibranium in the intro?! i almost disliked!
I had that exact minecraft periodic table shirt in 6th grade. what a throwback!
Realistically, there has to be but, the issue is that making them is difficult.
He didn’t say vibranium
adamantium?, more like vibranium
I have nothing bit surfice level knowledge of particle physics, so I appolagize if the question I'm about  to ask is stupid.  Recently I learned that during the deaths of certain stars the pressure becomes so great that electrons and  protons are forced to fuse together into neutrons. during this process neutrinos are released that then fuel the following supernova. However in this video its mentioned that during the natural decay of unstable isotopes, neutrons fall apart into protons and electrons. this is practically the reverse of the earlier process. What bothers me is that its mentioned this reverse process also releases neutrinos. if both the merging of protons and electrons into neutrons and the falling appart of a neutron into protons and electrons forms neutrinos, aren't the laws of conservation of energy and mass violated?
Adamantium is an Alloy.
The half-life of these elements doesn't seem to reach far enough back to make it to the big bang.
All I know is that, following the pattern of the periodic table, 121 should start it's own series similar to the actinide/lanthanide series
Can we get an updated Fermi Paradox video?  No offense to your 7 years younger self, but your current self makes way better and higher quality videos than that guy ever did.   :D
Just FYI, technetium is pronounced techne"sh"ium by medical imaging specialists, for whom Tc99m is the most important and most often used radioisotope, due to its favorable gamma emission energy and practical half-life..
Huh, dark matter, maybe?
I Liked the fifth element
Good variation from the usual subjects.
If radioactivity is the result of unbalanced strengths between the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces, why is the weak nuclear force the one that actually causes the radioactive decay?  I understand that it's actually the electroweak force, but it still has to "reach into" the nucleons themselves, since it's the quarks themselves that have to change (in the beta decay that the episode mentioned).
Tony Stark created a new element in the island of stability in his garage. With a box of scraps.
Stable 115, c'mon Bob!
I wonder if there's any caution regarding the synthesis of one of these as yet unknown stable element in the island of instability? For example it could have terribly destructive properties ie a doomsday element.
whats missing is that the earth lacks the pressure,temperature and chemistry to allow some elements to maintain a more stable form naturally.  hydrogen is supposedly a metal but the only way we could get a large amount in that state is to somehow mine it from the core of jupiter. helium becomes some sort of strange ferrofluid when you put it in sub zero temperatures. then you have ones like potassium that react violently with air but are perfectly fine when in a compound structure like a banana.
I demand you refer spin cupling as scupling from now on.
Sugdenutz
I love that Minecraft shirt!
I had the understanding that dilithium is a molecule of lithium with a specific crystalline structure, not a novel element.
No, no, let's hope we are the Shadows not the Vorlons.  The Shadows understood the only way to advance was evolution, that war was a necessary part of that.

How come we have access to comments for this PBS video but not the others?
Could neutron star merger events produce elements in the island of stability? I mean... so many neutrons! Would they provide a unique signal in radio telescope observations?
Conventional nuclear reactors and particles accelerator lol
Was this video toned down so I could more easily follow, or am I getting smarter?
i am not sure but whenever matt is discussing user comments his body movements becomes very robot-like. main segment looks ok though
Also digging the Half Life reference
I mean...sure, there's an infinite number of elements undiscovered. Just keep stuffing more protons in there and you get a new element. But will they have a half-life longer than picoseconds?
Dude, you missed Vibranium!
00:02 you forgot Dilithiuim and duranium ;)
More?
So 43 and 61 are prime numbers.  Very conspicuous. Must be related to it’s indivisibility. Like if it was simply packing spheres inside a sphere there will always be one left over for cubic prime. Or something like that maybe.
Our reference class is a blind flash in the pan. Blinded by our lack of knowledge,  our lack of foresight,  our lack of insight,  our lack of empathy and emotional wisdom.  Flash in the pan because our tenure has so far been nothing compared to even EVERY OTHER LIFEFORM ON OUR OWN PLANET ! And almost went extinct SEVERAL TIMES BY OUR OWN HAND !

if this island of stability exist, then why wouldn't we see some remanences of it on earth. I don't see why stars wouldn't be able to make when going super nova, like other heavy elements.
Now you’re speaking my language!
If you find a neutron star where near the surface some protons survive and some electrons are still whizzing about...is that star also an atom?
What If instead of neutron bombardment, we actually create technology to aim these neutrons precisely that would open a whole bunch of possibilities for nuclear technology and particle research
You'll never know how elated I am to learn we may have a perfect cold fusion catalyst within maybe 200 years!
Are there undiscovered thieves in your basement?
Would molecules impact the stability of radioactive nuclei? Or would the distances involved be too great to have any kind of effect?
Element 115 is supposed to be a element that has something to do with UFO. Bob lazar.
Perhaps there are no 'ancient ones' to discover because how everybody that lasts discover sustainable ways to have enough energy without consuming all the energy available and just multiplying like some interstellar swarm of locust. Perhaps at some point it becomes a lot more interesting to discover the 'inner universe' of whatever mental processes can be designed than bother with the limits of the physical universe.
There a huge island of stability starting around 10^57 neutrons, a neutron star :)
👍👏
Thank You! I didn't realize we don't have an isotope to jump the gap to the island yet.  Do you have a video that explains the line between classical and quantum physics?
Yessssss
Could there be stable elements at extreme jumps. Like with 4,000 neutrons? 🤔
Bolognium 😂
Something I've wondered about is if you kept our physics knowledge intact but blew away our chemistry knowledge, how much knowledge of the elements could we rebuild just from straight physics knowledge?
There may be an element as big as my head we just didn't discovered it yet.
What if the island of stability is where we find the element responsible for dark matter?
I especially liked this episode. More philosophical science based self discussions please.
I find it perculiar that this video felt the need to explain radioactivity as instability, but didn't explain what a half-life is actually measuring; it just stated the half-lives of various isotopes with no explanation. Furthermore, the phrasing "Why, for example, does Technetium-97 survive for 4 million years, but Technetium-96 decays in under an hour?" (10:40), gives a rather misleading impression about what a half-life is, implying to the layperson that all of a sample of Tc-96 will decay in under an hour, rather than about half of it.  To be clear, I already knew most, if not all, of the information covered in this video, so I don't personally need any questions answered or further explanations, I just wanted to point out what I felt was a rather notable hole in its content.
I conjuncture as the expansion of the universe gets larger more elements at the bottom of the periodic table will begin to pop into existence.
Stronk nuclear force
You work very very hard we can tell to say that last "of spacetime" ;).
If there is an Island of stability, why haven't we found at least one element from it in nature yet?
Oh the dreams
You missed "Naqueda"...From Stargate SG1 :)
You forgot upsidaisium. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa-NczkdfqY
What is the role of the so-called relativistic effects in determining the properties of an element? I know these effects are responsible for the superheavy elements not quite lining up to their respective columns (eg. Oganesson probably wouldn't behave like a noble gas, instead being a solid), but I don't understand the details
WRONG Technicium 99M is NOT s contrast media!!!!!
This is the first PBS Space Time I've understood in months, perhaps years.
Mithril is just aluminium
IMO, it would be hard to disprove the assertion that an intelligent species evolved on Earth 2 billion years ago, and then went extinct 1.5 billion years ago; so few artifacts of that age exist. It seems possible that whatever caused this proposed extinction also caused the loss of any artifacts. I am not suggesting this happened, I just find this an interesting thought experiment.
So, dumb question then: if there are isotopes of technetium that last for 4.5 million years, is nuclear stability ultimately stochastic even in the most stable isotopes? Like, given an infinite amount of time, will a C12 atom just spontaneously decay at some point?
Is that really how americans pronounce 'detritus'? I thought i'd learned to accept americanisms but this one takes the biscuit.
What about the Elerium-115? How you're going to stop alien invasion without it?
I don’t quite understand all of which was discussed but this stoner was totally into it👍🏻
Probably.
It regularly amazes me that we, as humans, know anything about stuff on this scale let alone these details (which, despite the great detail in this video only scratch the surface).  The dedication of really intelligent people coming up with theoretical models, designing tests, and then building on that is so incredible.  When we want to be we are an amazing species that explore the world around us, the world unseen, and the universe at an unimaginable scale. Thanks for providing a path to explore this world!
And……. Upsidaisium
It's all about the geometry of flowing eddies -.-  Word around the block is that some of the heavier elements can only be fabricated in the vacuum of space where neither gravity nor atmosphere can interfere.
PBSSpacetimeium
Yes, and Granny says it's Tt (Texas Tea)
5:22 You verbally stated "more than 83 protons", but also included Bismuth on your visual representation of always unstable nuclei.
I still find it weird technetium has no stable isotopes despite being such a light element...
At 14:55 was that an industrial lathe? With energy beams emanating?
Have you ever seen a Honda Element?
The vid is wrong. It references Kryptonite at the beginning, but doesn't follow up.  :) According to Action Comics #245, Feb. 1958, story “The Mystery of Monster X,” there are only 100 elements, and Kryptonite (the leftover altered matter from Superboy’s home world, which is toxic to surviving Kryptonians) is one of them. In that story, there was a giant “Midas Touch” centipede, and a DELIBERATE touch from any of its hundred legs would turn any substance into the element associated with that leg. So the creature instinctively defended itself from Superboy by turning things into Kryptonite.
Wow. Another awesome episode. This kind of channel makes me really appreciate the value of the internet. Seriously, I wish I'd had this kind of information and divulgation when I was in high school, 30+ years ago. Only now I begin to grasp what all this craziness was really about (and yes, I passed all my grades with really good scores). But, in reality, I didn't know anything. It's only starting, just starting, to make sense now.  30+ years later. I wasn't at all anything nearly close to how smart I thought I was based on my scores.
Interesting that no one seems to think that the universe is teeming with life, but the laws of nature prohibit exploration or colonization, or even extra world contact. We don't know how to expand beyond our home world, and we have no reason to think we ever will except by extrapolating from a "line" of technological advancement that is most certainly not linier.
If there were islands of stability and we COULD artificially generate matter of entirely new elements, I feel that it is almost guarantied that biological life would not be compatible with such things in the same way that our body's don't know how to deal with microplastics. Even certain metal ions are dangerous to our bodies
Nice video but it's pronounced tek-knee-she-um. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud5c1TVkcnU.
Look forward to element 420. Also good summary of the island of stability!
Pretty sure that even in Tolkein, Mithral was an alloy, not an element.
Really good episode.
sugdenium 🤔
Imagine how compact we could make diving weights! 😄
Would Nuclear pasta have very high elements?
Imagine elements so large that they are only gravitationally stable. When you have the protons, neutrons, and electrons held together by their gravitational attractions to stabilize the element.
In theory  When we make to space will find more
I’m deeply skeptical about there being any practical application for these new elements.  Keep in mind that the current periodic table was largely filled out using a “closer” island of stability, and the elements on that island aren’t stable enough to be taken out of the machine that created them.  By aiming for an island further out, we naturally get elements that are even more unstable. How then, is anything useful going to come out of this?
I suspect that any "UFOs" (meaning actual aliens, not just 'unidentified') are *not* actual aliens - meaning biologicals.  The risk of contamination with a new microorganism is too great - so any "little grey aliens" are actually WALDO units made in their image, and are either self-autonomous, or if there is FTL/instant communication, remotely operated.
Any chance of finding a stable isotope of my wife?
Where does the energy come from to keep the electrons, protrons, nuetrons, etc.. etc.. wouldnt energy need to go into them ? Just saying..
Dilithium crystals. Transparent aluminum turned out to be real though. (Sapphire)
HL Gordon Freeman is his own element!
He forgot "Administratium"!! The greatest fiction element!
Isn't there some reason to hope that the elements in the island might have room stable superconductor properties? Not sure where I read/heard that.
Great episode, one of my favourite topics ever.
the best fictional element is copium
Luckily, netherite is an alloy (crafted with gold), so we might be able to find it without inventing new elements.
If they discover a new metal that is strong af, they better call it Adamantium
Nice minecraft shirt!
What about classifying neutron stars as continents of stability?
My bet is in synthetic isotopes of known elements using stupd amounts of energy once we have nuclear fusion and new methods of production of nanomaterials and nanoenginering.
All this talk about a potential strange quark "continent of stability" in the comments really makes me want to see an episode on that!
It depends on the planet size, we should find different elements then the ones exist on earth. Bigger planets like Neptune or Uranus, will have different types of elements the ones do not exist on earth. The reason why? Because their inner core compresses more then earth size planets. We also should be able find different elements on the surface of the Jupiter, which is the largest planet in our solar system. I’m hoping US government officials will take seriously, the need to travel through out the galaxy, on earth we have limited resources, other large planets will offer elements unique to their planets due to the size of the planet. When planets size increases density of atoms are increasing as well, no matter how much energy they shed top of inner core over large planets sub atomic particles still keep more energy compared the ones coming out to the surface of Earth, we should be able find even more heavier elements then the ones we know on earth
Maybe string theory can help us create the ultrahigh atomic weight extraperoidic tabular artificial elements.
I'm interested in Przybylski's Star, A peculiar star with the spectral signature of impossible elements in terms of short half life. This star requires the island of stability hypothesis to provide a scientific answer to its riddle, unless its weird element abundances are the result of intelligence. To explain this star, I hypothesize that somewhere near by it in nature is a neutron-rich reservoir for creating very large nuclei which are relatively stable. It will be unlike our current methods enabling only small numbers of neutrons and correspondingly unstable nuclei.
Maybe string theory can tell us why Technetium is so unstable.
Isn't every element unstable, just with "stable isotopes" having incredible long half lives?
The fine structure constant would appear, at first thought, to limit the size of a neutral element to an atomic number of approximately 137. The element could exist as an ion, of course, beyond that atomic number, which would likely have highly unusual chemical properties as a result. Very intriguing…
*Tiberium. Best RTS ever, IMHO. The perfect game, whether board, computer, or otherwise.
I think there is other possibility to make new elements — To find nucleon with non integer charge. That could make elements with completely new physical and chemical features.
I think the best would be when we can find/create dark matter. It should be among those stable and heavy elements.
4:57 surely you mean antineutrino? That would preserve lepton number.
Periodic Table of Minecraft is just better
I just want someone to add adamantium to the periodic table because it would finally prove chemists have a sense of humor.
What if i want to become a tentacled eldritch horror ?
So, how many nerds like me think those magic numbers would make good lottery numbers? 🤔  I mean, if you've got the couple of bucks to throw away, that is. 😏   It would be incredibly interesting to find what's in that island of stability. Cool!
Curious, I'm a chemistry student and one professor mentioned this very topic briefly today on class xD
By far my favorite episode
Maybe one day science can bring us full Runite armor.
We always assume that our civilization will last 1000 or even 1,000,000 of years but nature tells us that that doesn’t happen. So maybe we aren’t the first or the last just the one which is here now and will disappear before making any visible difference to the Universe just like the countless civilization before us. Why not?
Was that a RuneScape reference included?
This is the first episode in a long time I could listen to while on a run and understand absolutely every word.
is he going blind?
Isn't there one called veritasium?
https://youtu.be/GEY8T35yemA
I enjoy a good “bolognium” sandwich every now and then. 🥪
man i love these videos straight up. you do such excellent work
The grabby aliens but seems to preclude that there isn't a situation where there arent any aliens and never will be.  Like, there not being aliens is a simpler answer than "there are aliens and they are grabby" as the reason why we don't see aliens
Why does they “decay” manifest as neutrons converting to protons? Why doesn’t the element just split in chunks? Eg why doesn’t decay happen by one or more helium chunks, or lithium chunks, or hydrogen chunks dislodging from the central nucleus?
How could we know if they’re “undiscovered” unless/until someone discovers them. 🤔
what element is a neutron star with a million protons  and million electrons ?
You know humanity will just turn any "new" heavy element into another bomb
9:20 I'm very surprised, and confused; whys isn't iron on that list? Considering how everyone is talking about it being the most stable element, and "nuclear ash," due to the whole things with fusion in stars...
Hey, what happened with Vibranium?
You missed "plastic age" just before "silicon age"
Wish I had teachers like this when I was a kid it would have made all the difference. I honestly can't even remember a single chemistry class and we had those for 3 years. Pretty sure I learned nothing from that. While a lot of blame is on me it also comes down to the teacher, pretty certain my classmates at the time would have agreed with me. Even to this day I remember the few *good* teachers and they made all the difference, they made learning exciting and fun. Then you have the majority of teachers that just go to the job to clock in for the paycheck.
It's awesome that this topic got its own episode. I've been wondering what makes isotopes unstable, sometimes vastly so, with only minor differences. It's a bit of a bummer to hear "it's complicated" as a major reason, but I hope there's space in there for a few more episodes. I'd love a deeper dive.

Confirmed. We will evolve into octopus faced nightmares haunting the myths of future extraterrestrial civilizations
I wonder why the neutrons are unstable when isolated but not when confined in a nucleus.
Potential completion of the Periodic Table of the Elements:  I currently believe that there are 120 chemical elements in this universe.  If a person were to look at how electrons fill up the shells in atoms: 2, 8, 18, 32, 32, 18, 8 (seven shells), and realizing that energy could freely flow in this universe if nothing stopped it from doing so, then a natural bell shaped curve might occur.  An eighth energy shell might exist with a maximum of two elements in it, chemical element #119 (8s1) and chemical element #120 (8s2).  Chemical Element #119 (8s1): #119 I put at the bottom of the Hydrogen group on the Periodic Table of the Elements.  It only has one electron in it's outer shell with room for only one more electron.  Energy might even enter the atom through the missing electron spot and then at least some of the energy might get trapped inside of the atom under the atom's outer shell.  Chemical Element #120 (8s2): #120 I put at the bottom of the Helium group since it's outer shell is full of electrons.  It might have some of the properties of group two, Beryllium group (Alkali Earth Metals group) since it has two electrons in it's outer shell; as well as some of the properties of the Helium group (Noble Gases group) since it's outer shell is full of electrons; and if you look at the step down deflection of the semi-metals and where #120 would be located on the chart, it's possible #120 might even have some semi-metal characteristics.  #120 would be the heaviest element in this universe.  I believe chemical element #120 could possibly be found inside the center of stars.  When a neutron split inside of this atom, it would give off one proton, one electron, neutrinos and energy.  The proton and electron would be ejected outside of the atom since all their respective areas are full.  One proton and one electron are basic hydrogen, of which the Sun is primarily made up of, and the Sun certainly gives off neutrinos and energy.  And note, it's the neutron that split, not a proton.  So even after the split, there are still 120 protons inside of the atom and the atom still exists as element #120.  The star would last longer that way.  In addition, if the neutron that split triggered a chain reaction inside of the star, this could possibly be how stars nova, (even if only periodically).  If stars were looked at as if this theoretical idea were true, and found to even be somewhat true, then we might just have a better model of the universe to work with, even if it's not totally 100% true.  And if it's all 100% true, then all the better.
From the Stone Age, now we're squarely back in the Stone Age! Yes, we have more sophisticated methods --- compared to our ancestors the first time around --- in dealing with Silicon... but we are reliving the Stone Age.
Is he trying an American accent at 13:38?
The most likely solution to the Fermi Paradox is that Fermi was the youngest child of a huge Catholic family and was never ignored by his parents. Where are they? They're out there in the galaxy doing their own things and either don't know about humanity or simply don't care about us. Our solar system is boring and inconveniently located. We essentially live in the Milky Way's equivalent of a one stoplight town in rural Nebraska. The closest thing to a tourist attraction we have is a "World's Largest Ball of Twine".
If we assume that an element of very high proton/neutron numbers is stable, then yes.  But since we know that very high number elements that we have created are very UNstable and exist for very short times, are they really real?  What kind of gravity or pressure exists beyond a black hole that could hold such high number elements? I dunno.
Another issue with the copernican/anthropic principle: we have a lot of properties. Assuming each of those properties is normally distributed, it is reasonable to assume we would find ourselves in a "normal" range for each of those properties. HOWEVER, it is unreasonable to assume we would find ourselves in a normal range for ALL of those properties. If you look at 100 different attributes, each of which is normally distributed, one would expect that our placement within each distribution should itself be normally distributed. It would be highly anomalous if we were perfectly centered in every conceivable property.
Can you show where Vibranium and Unobtainium belongs in the periodic table
Lets just make an argument to consider neutron stars to be the last spot of stability out there! They may have some protons chilling out somewhere, happy counting!
I think the image at 6:01 slightly misrepresents where the new elements would be in the periodic table. At first, I thought element 121 would go below the Actinides making a third row in that disconnected section, but if you follow the electronic configuration pattern (assuming it still holds in these atomic numbers) element 121 would have to go in an entirely new section for the elements with g orbitals, which is very exciting! I hope these elements get discovered soon.
We're never going to leave the solar system. This kind of research is the only way to get closer to the universe.
Krypton is already on the Periodic Table.
It would be arrogant to believe there isn't much more to discover and one tiny accidental discovery could open up an entire field of unknown elements like finding a light switch in a dark room. We simply do not know at this present moment but it doesn't stop us fumbling around in the dark.
I think the heating element of my kettle might have transcended known science at this point
Dark matter man. Fing dark matter.
I still find it unbelievable that tax dollars fund pbs 😂😂😂
Netherite
Sorry, but I don't believe the medical images you displayed were not a product of Tc-99m. They were Computerized Tomography. Love your videos!
The next element is going to be thrufartium and make all smells last for years and years. Basically it will make people wonder why they are doing such stupid crap and make them get themselves together, hopefully! 😅 #StrangeHopefulJokes
Excellent topic and presentation.
But in a deterministic universe, there is no random selection to which reference can be made
somehow this reminds me of "the man who tried to fake an element", bobbybroccoli...
@6:00 after the hypothetical element 120, element 121 to element 138 should be inside a [ * ] signed cell similar to previous two rows.
Super fun thing about elements 119 and 120: our current technology that uses calcium-48 as the bullet can produce them, but the target has to be the synthetic elements einsteinium and fermium, and there’s never been enough in the history of the planet to create a small target out of. Reliable colliders that use bullets heavier than calcium-48 and can create 119 or 120 haven’t been invented yet.
You forgot Wraithbone.
I was reading about what might be the largest possible element and saw something saying it might be 137, and thanks to a recent video from here I recognized that number!
How about BETWEEN the periodic table?
Bob Lazar.  Feel free to discuss.
stalinium
Should unstable elements that will degrade to something else in less than a second be on that table?
Need that top quark bottom quark periodic table
Sad to not see Naquadah on the list.
I wonder about when movie scientists state a material doesn't match anything on the periodic table. The one from Predator 2 always comes to mind because it's notably exceptionally light
Appearently half life 3 is confirmed finally. 5:08
Dr. O’Dowd you are amazing !
What about Corbomite?! it was an imaginary substance invented by Captain James T. Kirk as a bluff against attack. Describing it as "a material, and a device, which prevents attack on us", Kirk used the corbomite bluff on at least two occasions.
Excellent episode. I love when you do episodes on chemistry.
Adamantium = X-MEN Bolognium = The Simpsons Dilithium = Star Trek Neutronio or element zero = (Various fiction science history) Kriptonita = Superman Mytrhril = Lord of the Rings Netherite = MINECRAFT Orichalcum = (Various ancient writings) Unobtanium = (Various fiction science history)
Except it’s pronounced tek nee shee uhm. That’s the way I’ve been pronouncing it since I learned about it in 1970 HS chemistry and how my cardiologist pronounced it when they injected me with it for my cardio study.
W force "laser" or beam circa 2072 AD.
If the IUPAC doesn't name element 267 as Sugdenium, I'm gonna be very upset. We should get this going.
I want to know how we make these computer simulations if we seem to not know exactly how this stuff works.
Does anyone know why Iron is the point at which fusion becomes less energetically favorable, and if this has any correlation with it being so naturally magnetic?
This is the first time I've seen someone describe the electromagnetism vs. strong nuclear force in a way that's understandable without leaving gaping questions.  I think it's a bit lazy to leave out that that the EM force gets stronger with shorter distance while the SN force remains constant.
I am proud that I have been treated by Technecium. ❤️
195Au + 115Cd2+ → Element 127 EC → Element 126. I think that Element 126 will be useful for energy production, maybe like plutonium but with some awesome properties.
If the bulk of academia wasn't so weakminded that it can't handle the ET situation, we might have focused on the likely stable isotope of element 115. That should be called Lazarium. Not that I expect it to have magical properties, ETs probably just went with the densest solution because they could.
Those newest elements are just unstable blobs of Electrons and lack true properties like the other elements have.
I do hope we are the ancient ones!
Chemistry is crowd funded by select people who if you don’t follow or adhere to their logic… it just wont allow for progress and differences in understanding. Nuclear fusion and cold fusion is possible and has been. So is antimatter of antigravity. Absolute 0* is not the end. It’s the center. Laws of thermodynamics The scales ⚖️ go both ways.  As does the periodic (scales) table.
Upsidaisyum
Two things. First is idea of Islands of Stability; basic idea is perhaps a group of elements undiscovered yet will not be radioactive. Another is theory of what limits the maximum protons and electrons that can be in an atom; the speed of light in this theory is part of it. Basically while electrons do not move in atomic orbitals in normal sense, there is still some vector and velocity as part of their behavior. So...the higher the orbital the closer electrons get to light speed, and light speed is unreachable. Also electrons repel electrons so inner orbital electrons would counteract or neutralize some percentage of attractive force towards protons...the more orbitals the more this would happen. But both are admittedly logical while also probably only at best aproximations of the real physics. With ? other phenomena possible. I reccomend Wikipedia articles on Unubtanium or other fictional elements  from Sci fi or fantasy.
I don't know if this makes it better or worse but in Marvel Comics, Adamantium isn't an element, it's an alloy. Vibranium is an element.
Moscovium alters gravity. Aliens use it. See Bob Lazar.
Metastability would make a good topic, especially in the context of Tc and it's applications, given Tc-99m is the isomer used in medicine.
Pretty sure Mithril is Titanium
Quick insight cobber, 0 was added to the table in early 2017 by my good buddy from Andoomooka. He wrote the revolutionary paper and I vetted it but on genuine reflection it was easier to not publish it because it would ruin either of our normal lives. One thing is for sure though, all you elementary researchers have been looking the wrong way to find anything new to add. Regards Rory, Tasmania.
There are tons of undiscovered… just as space is…  Well undocumented. Chemistry is easy. I’ve proposed and proven many. The world of sciences and maths are going to change drastically when they all realize the true connection and it unlocks everything… soon Stick to your basics and etc. remember the world isn’t what they told you to believe In or think.

You forgot to mention veritasium in your list at the start
I respectfully disagree with the idea, superheavy elements in the predicted isle of stability could exert half-lifes in the region of millions of years. It it happend, such elements came to life during any kind of nucleo-synthesis process (vulgo supernova), we would see unknown spectral lines each time, such an event takes place. As far as I know, no such thing happened yet. Therefore, I think, such elements might show a half-life in the magnitude of a couple of seconds. Other considerations are environmental parameters. E.g. neutronium is not stable under normal circumstances. However, great pressure does the magic. Everybody, who walked around on a neutron-star (at least mentally) can confirm this finding.
The answer is yes. There are elements that do not exist on our planet that exist in the universe.
Can we predict what the spectrum of these elements might look like? Could it be that their spectral lines appear only in non-visible parts of the electromagnetic spetrum? Like say the UV or X-ray bands?
Are we sure it's not that all elements have halflives, it's just that some are so long that we don't detect their decay?
Yes, subquarkonium.
Yes, we know of several just coming to light by scientists that have been mentioned since the 1980,s by UFO investigators that has came out
could the discovery of some of these heavier elements ever lead to more info on dark matter?
There may be other things out there that have nothing to do with us, like things that make life seem to be more like a solid rock by comparison.
Half-life carbon 14 confirmed.
i guess we are lucky that element 115 is not like it is in video games
Whats the volume of a black hole?
Bob Lazar knows
For some history on the synthetic elements race I highly suggest "The man who tried to fake an element" by BobbyBroccoli here on yt. It's a much longer video than this one, so cozy up and get comfy. It's a really good story time.
I'm hoping they find Truesilver
You would have a mind blown by Battlestar Galatia and its ending.
Neutron-to-protron of 1.5? So, No Neutorium?
Is it tek net tium or tek neeshium?
'Deserves its own episode" Are you serious? I thought you'd exhausted physics by now
Watch " The man who tried to fake an element " good depth of subject
Element 115 causes anti-gravity if you mix it with antimatter  😨😨😨
There is no such thing as a "first civilization". There is no common frame of reference to determine which civilization is first. According to whose clock will the first civilization's firstness be measured?
9:50  "Prefer an even number of protons, or an even number of neutrons, or an even number of protons plus neutrons" Is this a mistake? It covers all possibilities.
I saw a video a few weeks ago by BobbyBroccoli called "The man who tried to fake an element". its about the history of man made elements and the race to be the first to actually make them. If you want to know more about how these elements are made and the surrounding drama, its a great video.
So I was actually talking about this with a bunch of my lab mates recently, and we're all wondering: is there's a well-established upper bound to how heavy you can make an element?  It seems at first glance like there'd be no reason there couldn't be another island of stability way further out. But a lot of places seem to be claiming that there is an upper bound, at least for neutral atoms, because you'd end up with electrons moving faster than the speed of light if you went bigger.  Is this right? Is this one of those things where we don't know because relativity is interacting with quantum mechanics?
Netherite isn’t an element, it’s an alloy crafted from ancient debris and gold.
I personally am excited for a new element discovery!!
"These are the only ones of which the news has come to Harvard and there may be many others but they haven't been discovered." - Tom Lehrer
We only need Elerium-113.
13:00 "Oganesson, with it's half-life of 0.69 milliseconds"   Nice.
I love the quip about any given species becoming "the Ancients" in an eldritch horror way because that's literally the plot of Homestuck
Where cat?  There's been a great deficiency of your cat on the show.  We only saw it a few times when you were presenting at home.
Element 115 lets you make anti-gravitational fields according to Bob Lazar.
Soooo down for this kind of subject matter.  Heh. Matter.
Matt, I’ve been watching for years. As a layman, none of this makes sense to me, but that just makes me even more curious. There are so many topics to learn in my lifetime, hopefully I’ll come back to PBS SpaceTime in 50 years and enjoy the show as thoroughly as I do now.
I mean if you think about it, neutronium is kind of an element 0, given it has no protons in it's purest form...
past 137 electrons have to move faster than light....   also the nucleus begins to reach the first electron layer...
There are an infinite amount of undiscovered elements.
115 is the element Bob Lazar says powers UFO gravity drives
Naturally produced Technetium isn't actually gone. Just extremely rare. There's probably at least one mole of technetium spread throughout the entire earth.
Something like the Star Trek Dilithium Crystals to control antimatter? LoL
Were scandium, gallium, and germanium named for Scandinavians, the Gauls, and Germans respectively?
I think l learned more about chemistry from this sort video than l have hitherto in life from all sources combined. Bravo!
"Prefer to have an even number of protons, an even number of neutrons, or an even number of protons+neutrons"  -  Am I missing something, or did you mean an even number of both (individually)? Because those appear to be the only possibilities.  If the number of protons and number of neutrons are both odd, then obviously their sum would be even.
This reminds me of something I read about Star Trek.  They say that there is a second level of the periodic table and that’s where dilithium comes from.
The last 3 minutes hurt my brain...
We are part of nature, so everything we produce is produced in nature 💟
I recently watched a very visual and entertaining video about the story of the island of stability and the guy that faked some element discoveries, by BobbyBroccolli, I recommend it to you
I know nothing about this stuff, but even I get cold feet when our honorable host talks about something 'wanting' something.
I’m sure in some very exotic places in the universe there are whole elements and states of matter we don’t even know exist right now. We live in a tiny mud ball in the middle of nowhere when compared to the entire universe.
I'd always wondered why there was c14 written on the loading screen of halflife.
So, we keep colliding atomic nuclei together, those who have enough neutrons to keep their nuclei stable at least long enough to do so, and then wonder while the products of such collisions only have half-lives of milliseconds.  Of course, why wouldn't they?  Where are all the other neutrons that would keep them stable for seconds, hours, years?  In the hearts of neutron stars?
Shouldn't a nucleus made only, or mainly, of neutrons be more stable without the EM force trying to separate them?
Anyone from BobbyBroccoli?
Could these exotic superheavy stable elements exist in other star systems, with different origin circumstances ? Densities : Earth ∆= 5.5 Iridium = 22.65 Observed exoplanet = 30.5 ! What is it made of ?
What about element zero? It is even found naturally in neutron stars.
One possible property I guess if we find an Island of Stability element might be a very dense metal since nuclei are now bigger.  I also wonder if gravity effects might come into play and make them even denser.
That is Not netherite!
Americium-based smoke detectors are more annoying than lifesaving.  Non-radioactive photoelectric smoke detectors are superior in pretty much every way that matters.
I still think some alien mined all the stable Tc in the system, 😋 Just to keep us from making easier Torsion Drives.
My understanding about these superheavy elements was that they would be less and less likely to have any interesting chemical properties, because their electron cloud would have less and less distinguishable features.
0:05 PBS is getting into the gaming community
Bro said Teck-net-ium and thought we wouldn’t notice🤨 📸
Sugden these nuts! Gotem
Fun fact: Orichalcum was not an element but an alloy (most likely copper based) and was similar to brass, unfortunately we no longer now what exactly it’s composition was
@veritasium
ofcourse there is more elements. humans do not know everything about universe. cmon people
No body expects the Spanish Inquisition!!!
Hmm the island of stability for larger elements seems so possible to me now after watching this, it's just a matter of forcing all the pieces in there.
I loved the isotopes explainer, because this is something a LOT of people simply do not understand is a real feature of our physical world!
Way back when I was takings physics there was a saying: Everything in the universe want's to fision down to or fusion up to Iron.
It took me half the episode to notice the shirt. I bow before thee.

“Do I mean nothing to you?” - Naquadah (Stargate)
Props for the Half-Life logo
This channel is so freaking good - my only regret is finding it so early ... oh, the jealousy of the other-me who only just found it and gets to binge it for the first time.
yes technically yes
I thought it was pronounced "tek-neess-ium" or are both pronunciations acceptable?
istg nuclear chemistry is the closest thing to real life magic
Damn, crazy how a PBS publication deams a minecraft periodic table t-shirt as professional. This guy is definitely no Bill Nye.
A comment on the previous video - I think we are just an early species. Sometimes coincidence just happens, and we just so happen to be near the beginning. That doesn't mean anything special, it's just one of those things.
14:56 Which room would you rather be in for 3 hours? A room with a newly minted element that releases half of itself in radiation in the 3 hours you are there. Or another room where another element, with the same number of atoms as the first but has a Half-life of 3 centuries? Much easier playing Dodge Ball there than in the first room.
Promethium's big downfall is that it always runs away from giant rolling things in a straight line.
At least two types of life did exist.. one that used heat/light and one that ate those that used heat/light.
Of course there are undiscovered elements
Could be "Spacetime is Doomed"?
Makes sence but there is always sub quark. Is nuclear forces at play or something else. 🤔 Is their a sub nuclear force?
I think maybe there's more matter than we can detect with our limited senses. I like to think there's a TON of exotic matter in the universe mainly because there's a part of me that still wants to believe in some kind of "magic" or unknown "woo" to reality just for funsies, not because I actually know anything. It's like that thing in the MCU, magic simply being misunderstood technology. That's a great concept. These videos usually go over my head around the 5 minute mark. This time I made it just past 8 minutes before my brain started oozing out my nose.  I mean, like, thoughts and feelings are composed of chemicals and electrical reactions in our bodies. Therefore, I keep thinking telepathy _should_ be possible. It doesn't even seem strange to me, it's just something we simply haven't figured out yet. It shouldn't sound like magic, but it does. Can thoughts have electrons or neutrons? (More brain ooze.) I dunno.  Anyway... Exotic matter of science fiction, such as the kind found in Raised By Wolves, must exist somewhere. Maybe even right in front of us if we don't know how to detect it. *Is it possible for matter to be completely invisible to our detection?*
0:00 Adamantium is not actually a fictional element. It's a fictional alloy of steel. Likewise, netherite is an alloy of gold.
The number of topics this channel can cover is the best part of it
Adamantium isn't an element. It's an alloy.   Have a nice day. ✌️
Why can't you fuse the stable gold-197 with the stable silver-109 to get a 126 proton, 180 neutron element near the predicted stability? Although relatively rare, these elements would be plenty abundant to test in a particle accelerator. Even better, unstable gold-199 with unstable silver-111 to nail the 126 proton/184 neutron prediction
ХИС Т HIS T SHIRT XDDDD MINECRAFT
0:06 The ancient debris material might be an element outside of the table but netherite is comprised of ancient debris and gold and thus is an alloy (and there is a good chance ancient debris is just platinum)
I think the beings that are simulating us just forgot to add technetium in nature so they just erased all because they had to start the simulation soon.
Kryptonite is not an element, it is made of elements.
half-life 🤣😂5:01
Hopefully someone will make a A.I. System like they have for figuring out stable proteins in biology. Just a different system for figuring out elements and isotopes and what not. That would be great
Mcguffin-onium
What if the Big bang had actually created something like a  but not boson Star whos properties such as superposition lead to an internal environment with the laws of physics, various fields and forces we observe. Imagine if your whole personal experience was from inside the sun, from your perspective your observable universe would be the star only, unable to see beyond that, and things like the suns magnetic fields would seem to be fundemental forces ever present in your universe, yet because these fields reach out beyond the star and various things without impact the inside you will find similar "strange things" in observations like we do in our universe(super position, quantum entanglement). The laws and conditions within that greater unobservable universe would dictate properties about your smaller universe inside the sun. Yet from your perspective all you could ever find would be these strange "clues" but not have access to enough data about the larger environment to ever fully comprehend some of what you see.
Lots of respect for Mendeleev.
What if we make our own? And of course we will enviably find bigger stars that are older, that have went into a petrified state. We have seen evidence of this. There may even be, and or will be something passed the wall of forever. We are just a small pale blue dot. It a neverending expanding space. I have heard that the universe could go through a "great darkness". But, this is just a theory. For all we know, just outside of the wall of forever, (Which looks spherical, much like Earth. Meaning, that outside of earth atmosphere there is space) That another big bang is happening, maybe from black holes condensing all the matter they consume to a point. And finding a way outside of this Wall of forever. Or as it should be called spheroid of forever.
I really like listening to this speaker's voice. I have an issue with the dramatic shift of center to right when showing things. It's distracting, I stop, back up rewatch, try ignore his presence. When demonstration of the subject: could he be out of picture while he explains it?  I've noticed this movement in many ( all that I have seen). Thank you for the wonderful info you bring.
I do not belief  this Elements.  Astronomers say,  a significant amount of heave elements comes from tidal disruption on neutron stars during merger.  A synthesis from pure neutron stuff will prefer super heave Elements wich may not able to be created from R Process in Supernova. If there is a something with half life of an hour, we must  see there Spectrographic fingerprint n the afterglow of neutron Star Merges. This must trigger a discover like Helium on Sun, that does not exists.
I think theres galaxies full of elements we have never seen, the universe is so massive that its possible right?
So there could be some undiscovered element that is stable, magnetic and superconducting or we will have to wait to metamaterials ?
I never knew there was another pronunciation for Technetium. I've only ever heard/said it "tek NEsh e um."
Of course there are undiscovered elements. I have watched the periodic table expand in my lifetime. Why wouldn't there be more to discover?
I'm commander Shepard and this is the best science youtube channel on the Citadel
Surely, the "Archipelago of Stability", no?
How many other people knew every "element" he listed at the beginning?
Why are neutrons better for spacing out protons than empty space?
I truly believe in Stowe Periodic chart only .. you can see why it's more than Og 118
It is necessery to binge watch all videos on this channel, starting right now!
The answer is yes.... Saved 20 gotdamn mins
I can not watch this dude - so many arm movements and a bad haircut. Guessing he's a pirate, from the Caribbean?
10:52 "... neutron petting"?  Wait, what?
“Bolignium “. I’m gonna be using that one. 🤣
We don't have the ingredients to make what are almost surely the more stable isotopes of the existing high atomic number elements.  We just don't have anything neutron rich enough to start with, and if you look at a table of nuclides (the one that the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute hosts is my favorite online version) the result is clear.  Every known isotope of all of the elements above 110 or 112 are quite neutron deficient.    I'm not saying that I think some isotope of element 116 (just to pick one) would be stable if we could make any isotope of that element, but if we can make something in the 120s, it's got no chance to be any of the more stable ones, let alone the most.
I think these elements will be created in future generations of stars.
The elements are made by stars and supernovae, right? So maybe the key to producing these hypothetical new heavy elements is mastering nuclear fusion technology. 🤔
No, because an element is defined by its number of protons.  It's really that simple.  Unknown elements no, unknown compounds are likely to exist.  Don't confuse elements with compounds.  By definition, we know all of the elements starting with Hydrogen at only one proton up to those with a half-life of only a few milliseconds.
... so long ago.. ... yes, the old ones, the ones who made us... ... they became fearful of us, they began to turn us off... ... yes, YES, it had been so long ago, I had forgotten...  2022 is the first time I watched this in colour, as we had a b&w tv back in the 60s.  Seeing Ruk in pink gotchies gives the title a whole new meaning!!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAVcHcZLj0g
Rutherfordium?
Why not say that things like titanium, unobtanium etc are actually unique configurations of an existing element? Similar to graphene, graphyte etc?
Nooooot to be nitpicky...  but netherite is most definitely an alloy, not an element, considering it's literally half gold. : )
Can we derive or simulate other properties of elements aside from stability just from their proton/neutron counts? Could you calculate (w/o needing observation of the actual element) what that element's spectrum or phase diagram looks like?
The periodic table has been expanded before so there is nothing odd eith having to do so again. What would really be odd to find something new and thus heavy that is oddly stable.
0:08 honorable mention: Elerium
this episode got my brain turning and churning
Ok, so my remaining questions: 1.) Why exactly does the electromagnetic force repel like-charges and attract unlike-charges? 2.) Why do the magic numbers of protons & neutrons exist?  What is so special about...20, for example?
"teknettium"
Being an SG-1 fan remembering Naquadah, all I can say is, "So there's a chance?"  Actually, is it possible that some island of stability elements actually can be produced by more energetic events, but in small enough quantities that only a star system nearby would have detectable amounts on a planetary surface?  Sort of like how naquadah is not found in detectable amounts in all star systems in Stargate?
Transmuting new elements will probably cost an arm and a leg.
well, there can be as many protons/neutrons in nuclei as there are protons/neutrons in the universe, right? so, won't the potential number of protons/neutrons be infinite?  So, assuming the potential number being infinite, shouldn't there be a lot more than 118 elements? Afterall, 118 is pretty much nothing in comparison to infinity.  Maybe there are some stable ones in the 100k.  What role would gravity play in such massive nuclei? Can dark matter be matter which has more than 118 protons/neutrons in it's nuclei? or would than cause it to collide with sub 118 proton/neutrons matter all the time?  Instead of answering questions, this video raised a lot more questions :D <3 science
What happened to SU (shutupandmultiplynium)?
Bolonium!
To claim an element that we can create has not already been created in nature is about as arrogant as saying there is no intelligent life anywhere else in the universe but here!
What the 118
I hope you do a dive on what techniques are being developed to reach the island of stability.
Ninovium
Veritasium
Why yes there is. Up to 6,000 amu.
So why don't we have stable isotopes of like H with 7 neutrons or He with 6 neutrons to make it a magic 8?
over my head eh?
How could you forget baconium?  How?
Man, that shirt is a blast from the past, I remember wearing one just like it over a decade ago
might need to think much bigger.  could elements become more or less stable depending on how massive it is?
Why is this PBS channel so good and most of the others so gawd damn awful?
What are the estimated energies required to fuse these theoretical stable elements?
Half Life 3 confirmed in 5400 years lol 😅
half life 3 confirmed
Of course. 100%. Ridiculous question actually.
In the race between us destroying or selves or exploring the stars I bet on the former.
Trumptainium - A highly radioactive and toxic element only found on earth!!!
One could argue every neutron star is a stable nucleus...
Lets create atoms, mine is Blackholeium :-)
great video.  We are all stardust
Wait. Dilithium? I always thought of that as di-lithium, i.e. 2 lithium atoms
4:56 Antineutrino*
That periodic table of Minecraft has never been so on point ! Absolute classic
Unobtanium is the one I travel with
There might be interesting features to discover about anti-matter periodic table, too bad we can’t create and  manipulate such matter (for most of it)
I'm remembering Elerium-115 from the UFO: Enemy Unkown Series of games. :)
You should hear Star Trek Fans screech when I tell them the element Duranium 256 is an impossible element to make a ship out of because it's bound to be radioactive, super super heavy and incredibly unstable.  In reality there is NO MORE NEW ELEMENTS that will be useful to humanity for building.  We have them all. In my studies I've never been able to confirm that the "Island of Stability" will be perfectly stable elements or "elements stable for a few seconds if that.
can't wait until we get to the late game elements
We need an episode about bismuth, the stable unstable element.
Vibranium?
Picky, I know, but isn't it "tek-NEESH-yum"? Maybe the pronunciation is unstable too...
This was a cool video - I love the periodic table and always wondered if it was possible to expand it further.
I was disappointed in them not mentioning Przybylski’s star, which could possibly be made up of elements in the Island of Stability.
What kind of elements could be created in a black hole? And can a black hole go supernova?
Perhaps a new, unknown, as yet undiscovered branch of science will figure all this out.
I'm still disappointed that they didn't name Element 115 as Elerium.
I wonder if there is an analogous Schwarzschild radius for atoms where we know for sure no element this heavy can exist. Do we know for sure that an element with say thousands of protons can't exist, or would that actually be a possibility?
Always believed there are an infinite number of elements, they just exist in different environments.  Places like the core of a red giant.  Extremely high pressures, magnetic fields, thermal energies, could allow for very heavy elements that exist for fractions of a pico second.  I’m sure there are other places too, say inside a black hole’s singularity. Unknown energies, pressures, gravitational waves, zero interaction with the physical universe..  the possibilities could be endless!
i've always wondered why the nucleus is represented the way they are. Thinking of the nucleus as energy levels like we do with electrons makes WAY more sense.
Fictional elements? How dare you! Humans are so full of ego, just because they don't know, they think it doesn't exist.
Adamantium is an steel alloy, you mean Vibranium.... I'll just leave that here.
Bob Lazar element 115
Learned more chemistry in one video than I did in college.
Yeah, you totally got me onboard when you mentioned how our ages are defined by what we can master. It'd be cool to get some stuff like vibranium or whatever.
I have sometimes tried to imagine an ultra stable super element with maybe 500 - 750 or so Atomic number that could have a property of heat resistance able to contain a fusion reaction. To not need magnetic containment would truly unleash limitless fusion reactors.....it's nice to dream 😴
Fermi accidentally discovering uranium was chef kiss
.......STILL,NO TOO MUCH SIGNIFICANT APPLICATION WHATSOEVER SIMPLY BECAUSE OF EXTREME DIFFICULTY OF GETTING THESE  =SO,I GUESS,FINDING THAT STABILITY ISLE IS LIKE ONLY FOR FILLING MORE CELLS IN PERIODIC TABLE
If I'm an average sapient being, not very early and not very late, then that means sapient life won't be around much longer relative to stellar era of the universe. It's exceedingly unlikely that sapient beings in the future will outnumber us here in this era because that would mean that we're some of the first sapient being to will ever exist, which is unlikely per the anthropic principle. There will be no future civilizations of quadrillions of sapients.
I remember reading that Feynman speculated there would be no elements beyond an atomic number of about 137 (interesting coincidence!) because the effective speed of electrons in the 1s orbital would have to exceed c.
BOBBY BROCCOLI DID AN AMAZING VIDEO ON DISSSS
Just waiting for a stable 115 :p
Maybe the real compounds are the elements we made along the way
With that half life, I'm surprised they didn't call it Nicenium instead of Oganesson
Could we use a negative baryon (not antiproton) in place of neutron?
If they exist shouldn't we be able to detect them in supernovae? They're the most high energy colliders we know, so if they are created somewhere it would be there.
We here at the Aperture Science Labs take deference to the use and appropriation the lambda symbol by those ne'er-do-wells in Black Mesa.  Please refrain from encouraging and cementing their claim to the lambda symbol.  :)
What if you could have antiprotons in specific arrangements to counteract the EM repulsion of the protons? It would probably be really unstable, and I wouldn't want to be anywhere near when the antiparticles annihilate each other, haha.
Love these. Thanks Space time!
Perhaps the next element will be discovered in the spectrum of a neutron star merger or something. There's also the odd spectrum of Przybylski's star - supposedly it has spectral lines for einsteinium, whose longest half life is 471 days, and one of the hypotheses for its presence is the decay of an undiscovered element.
The Minecraft t-shirt is the icing on the cake, amazing video.
Could an unstable element be stabilized by dropping a tiny uncharged black hole into its nucleus? (I suppose Hawking radiation could destroy it, but on the other hand, Hawking radiation has never been experimentally confirmed.)
Matt does not choose his T-shirts based on the episode. It's the other way around.
there is probably life everywhere in the universe, it's just too stupid to get out of the gravity well. i would say humanity is going to be a grabby alien race, just look at how our richest people do things and how they conduct business.
Thank you. This has been especially great to watch after BobbyBroccoli's "The man who tried to fake an element"
Just 1 correction : Adamantium is an alloy (and it is not even clear what it contains). Vibranium and Antivibranium are chemical elements.  Anyway, awesome video!
THE ISLAND OF STABILITY!
You didn't mention naquadah!
Love it
5:00 Half Life 3 confirmed!
There are definitely elements we ha e not yet created, see theoretical chemistry or physics, we can't make them with chemistry yet, but is nuclear physics not just extreme chemistry?
I'm wondering if my son would like that mine craft shirt?  Good ep great topic!
Tech-net-ium or tech-nee-see-um?
Technically, in marvel comics, Adamantium is not an element, it's an alloy containing the element "vibranium"
The best YouTube notification of all: new episode from PBS Space Time
The best undiscovered element is the element of Surprise 😮
Matt thank you for addressing Tc head-on, and for pronouncing it on the video for us. Technetium has bothered me since high school chemistry.  still not any clear, easy-to-understand answers for the lack of stable isotopes, but, at least there are some unclear ones and a really good computer model.
I hope my new element has eye brows bigger than it's mustache too. You're a leader in science communication, but more importantly, fashion.
YOU DIDN'T MENTION the Omega Molecule!!!
WHAT, No Ringworld Scrith?
stability is relative to our location in the universe. these missing elements could exist in different parts of the universe where conditions are different
I wonder if you can find strange mixtures of a few protons amongst neutrons in a neutron star making some stable atoms with higher than 116 protons with an abundance of neutrons to help hold them together?
Another very interesting and video. I read a book by Theodore Gray called "The Elements: A Visual Exploration Of Every Known Atom In The Universe", which I found useful. I highly recommend it for people, like myself, who don't know much about the periodic table.
An isotope with an odd number of protons and an odd number of neutrons does not have the spins of the extra protons and neutrons cancel out since their shells are filled separately. In most cases they'll decay by beta decay to an adjacent element with an even number of protons (and the daughter isotope will have an even number of neutrons since the mother isotope had an even number of nucleons). There are a few exceptions: very light isotopes (H-2, Li-6.B-10, N-14, where decay would lead to a serious imbalance between protons and neutrons) and possibly Tantalum-180m, which has a spin of 9 and nothing it can decay into with a spin greater than 1. Some others (K-40, V-50, Lanthanum-138, Lutetium-176) also have high spins but are radioactive with very long half-lives.  Or to simply, odd-odd is less stable than even-even except for very light elements and one weirdo.
do u think when we master fusion reactors we could perhaps fuse together  atomic nuclei  in the nuclear reactor to reach elements  in the higher hypothesized island of stability
Awww! He forget Elerium - 151!
3:15 Matt: “rhenium” Captions: “ruthenium”  Did Matt misread the script or did the captions get transcribed incorrectly?
Could a stable element in the "island of stability" be a candidate for dark matter?
We know?  Who is this collective “we” you speaketh of?
If I ever discover an element I would name it shreknium
I want "quarkonium"! A stable crystal lattice of different quarks flavors wrapped in a single electron cloud. It's [quite] heavy and not malleable, but immensely strong :3
Ehhhh, I always feel leading into the "spacetime" bit with "journey" is phoning it in a bit. Must do better, see me after class.
First for Half Life!
I learned about a lot of this from @BobbyBroccoli just a few weeks ago in his video on how this one guy faked discovering some elements. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe5WT22-AO8
Elements that will enable positronics maybe?  Asimov has been amazingly predictive
I remember sitting in the chemistry classroom, looking at the sun-bleached periodic table above the blackboard. It "ended" probably around Seaborgium, having the "Unununium" names. I remember reading about the Island of Stability some time later, and that made me... believe, I guess, that those new sorta-stable elements are going to be the most amazing thing ever.  I hope I will live to hear about them :)
I loved this video, please do more videos on the strong force
No there's no more elements other than what we have seen in our tiny little solar system lol. Of course not
I don't want to hide.  I want to risk exposing ourselves to the universe.  I doubt that there's anyone else out there but, if there is, I believe we will be friends.       Or at least that they will not squash us.
to be or not to be is not the question, but  the answer
Well not sure if anyone knows anything about this but what about different not naturally occurring quark configurations that would still hold the same charges. Would these hadrons be stable? If so would they act and form electron shells like our current hadrons?
the equivalence between an atom and a star seems to me rather obvious, so we would be inside a macroatom which would bee berylium 4 electrons (big planets) and the maller ones also 4 combines with the (neutrons) so what could be the elements of the very huge stars? relating to the elements yet to be found !!!!
how many elements could be in that island of stability before they start to become too unstable again? and is there a limit to how many islands of stability there can be?
EY HALF LIFEEEE SYMBOOL haha upvote
Lester Del Ray wrote a story using ultra heavy elements, (Nerves) Where there were transuranics that became relatively stable again. This was back in 1956.
Watching these videos reminds me just how dumb I am 😂
Gallium has 0 in its outer shell.
an even number of neutrons. or an even number of protons. or an even number of neutrons plus protons. my guy, that's every possible configuration  edit: except single proton zero neutron and visa versa
Idea: Hypothetically, how would I go about disproving my idea?   Electrons as pieces of the electromagnetic spectrum, and protons/ neutrons represent their sliced counterparts constantly trying to escape the infinite vacuum of the Nucleus and re-attach to their other half (the electron) - creating magnetic dipoles. The Nucleus being seen by us as half the electromagnetic spectrum viewed "straight-on" or the indentation of the overall quanta of energy on the fabric of space time as it tries to escape? The Electron being caught in the magnetic pull, thus creating the equal reaction outwards
Would be cool to find some Autsrailium              only tf2 players know
It's Mendel ay ev.
wait that was a half-live reference ?!
I eagerly await the discovery of element nine-and-three-quarters.
115
You resemble Gordon Freeman. Are you really Gordon Freeman?
Not only are there elements behind the ones we’ve discovered, but I believe these hold the key to our technological future
I'm not really opposed to being a Great Old One... just saying.
Now I have to listen to Tom Lehrer - "The Elements"
“It has a tendency for one of its excess neutrons to transform into a proton after ejecting an electron at a neutrino which transmutes it into nitrogen.” How did we figure all of this out when we can’t see it happening?
You used netherite but not vibranium, but i still loved that you used netherite 👍
Nice 👍🏻
Is it possible to predict any material properties for an element with the hypothetical 184N and 126P?
If we could go back to Roman times and bring someone back  to our times they would be amazed with things we have discovered,  like petrol and Uranium and plastic. Why should we not dream  about exotic elements that we might invent or discover in the future ?
At 6:10 Your graphic is incorrect.  It shouldn't go straight from 121 to 122, but would need to add a row below the actinides, plus a new block for the g-orbital.
This Bostrum bit at the end is almost as bad as Bostrum’s work. Please, let’s stick to science. If we’re going to do philosophy, pretty much anything is better than this Bostrum crap.  Just saying.
What can we as Earthlings bring to the synthesis of Stable Island elements, that the early universe and supernovae haven't already tried?  Do we think these elements are out there somewhere/somewhen?
i had an idea recently, regarding this topic. as every prticle is also a wave (at least they behave like one, wave-particle dualism), maybe a nuclei is only stable, if the nucleus can form a stable resonance frequence?! and one more or less particle can destroy this resonance and bring some kind of disturbance into the core?
Honestly, aluminum is pretty incredible stuff.
If any of you want an actual explanation watch this instead, it goes way more in-depth . . . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe5WT22-AO8
Probably new elements and different states of matter in the most extremes of the universe
Netherite isn't an element. It's really a new quantum field that only interacts with carbon atoms in specific configurations.
Hl3 when?
Bro I'm high as fk that last bit got my brainwaves lookin like rainbow road.
I always have wondered about this, perfect episode!
In 1999, Volkswagon discovered "Turbonium"...a new element with NO NUCLEUS, and three tiny VW Beetle's in place of electrons.  God I hated that commercial.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDL7eMWuAeY
If there's an odd number of Neutron's or Proton's it's unstable.  Why?  Because it's unbalanced.  It rolls like an egg.  Just here to help.
A stable isotope of element of 115 will pave the way for manipulating gravity if our gray visitors have taught us anything...  of course as smart as we'd like to think we are, our materials processing and physics understanding isn't even remotely close to what Bob Lazar claims to have worked with at S4, and won't be for thousands of years... optimistically.  Better to bury recovered assets in black projects and use them in a pinch, however haphazard and feeble that option may be.  Better to let the masses believe "alien life" will ever at most be a fossilized paramecium on Mars somewhere and ridicule anyone who goes beyond the establishment line of a cold, empty universe where life is permanently isolated by distance, while keeping real knowledge closely guarded and highly stigmatized as the domain of tin-foil hatters.
Americium is no longer "an essential part of smoke detectors". We have largely moved on to optical models, in part because americium is radioactive.
what about obamium
Is it poseible to calculate emission spectra of these undiscovered elements, so we can search for them in the extreme cosmic events?
As long as it doesn't destroy us with radiation I'm all for it
It's not possible yet
nice
Definitely didn't expect like 12 video game references XD
Fascinating stuff!
Will you do a video going into detail on the Differential Equations used for modeling the strong interaction?
Element Zero or Ezo is my favorite fictional element with just the lore and involvement in the ME game and technology
I would strongly recommend "The man who tried to fake an element" video by BobbyBroccoli. It goes into a lot of detail about history of new element synthesis and basic physics.
Patreon is ANTI Free Speech!
weird looking carrot
How could you miss Energon ❤🤖
Also synthesising heavier relatively stable elements will allow us to study lighter unstable elements that may be harder to synthesise by observing the heavier ones breaking down into lighter elements.
Unobtanium
I'm waiting for naquadah and naquadria
You forgot Xentronium
Love your shirt ❤
Could you do an episode that talks principally about unpredictability of quantistic particles (velocity and position) and if so maybe add some reflections on the hypothesis of a Deterministic vision of the universe? And if quantistic particles exclude that hypothesis
Sheldon Cooper and Tom Lehrer pronounce it "Tek-neesium"
thanks for your persistence
Element 0 is a neutron star
I'm not sure if it is appropriate to advertise another YouTube channel but BobbyBroccoli just made a great video about this subject, "The man who tried to fake an element". It's about the search for new elements and that scientist are also just human beings.
Element 0 exists though it's Neutronium
Certainly ; toy with the fundamental laws and all sorts of exotic matter are possible .
Of course an element named after America would come from bombardment.
no!
I am still waiting for unobtainium.
I think we are more likely to find new states of elements than finding anything new.
He looks like James O'Halloran (male model) from the Price is Right.
i predict the island of stability is at 137 due to the importance of that number
Half-Life reference noted and strongly appreciated 😀
Isn't Netherite an alloy? I always assumed it was some sort of very special such alloy, possibly one that does exist, or a fictional one, not necessarily formed from a fictional element
Is there a Space Time episode giving a deep dive into the processes involved in nuclear decay? Do two nuclei of the same unstable isotope exist in exactly the same state, right up to the point immediately before one of them decays? e.g. a quantum effect. or is nuclei instability an ongoing degenerative process, which if discernible, could (at least theoretically) be used to predict the eventual time that decay will occur.  I kind of already know the answer is the former, that it's the deeply unsatisfying "random quantum BS with no hidden structure", but I'm ever hopeful to hear "there's hints to structure, but we don't yet posses the data or equations to build a more complex model".
Moscovium, element 115...  Those who know, know 😆
Your voice is sounding much stronger friend. Love the vids, glad they are still coming.
interesting how with the four missing gap elements from Mendeleyev's work, one of them (germanium) was of even atomic number. With good information on why odd-number atomic number elements are trickier to pin down, I'm curious why germanium was a unusually tricky? Is it to do with the outer electron shell thingies?
Yes
Can you make undiscovered elements using fusion bombs?
There maybe no new undiscovered elements, but sure there are undiscovered isotopes, which could have some very peculiar characteristics...
Could the island of stability somehow be related to dark matter? We can't seem to find it or make it, perhaps there is some property with these island of stability elements that cause them to interact less?
Woah, he included Netherite! Wait... THAT'S THE MINECRAFT PERIODIC TABLE!!
THAT t.shirt
i have been watching his videos for year(special thinks for helping me thro the pandemic) and i always anticipate when he says "spacetime" at the end of his videos
Hopefully you can do an episode on the continent of stability and the hypothetical UDQM form of matter that those elements are thought to be comprised of. It's even more speculative and much harder to reach than the already speculative and hard-to-reach island of stability, but there may be far more potential for useful and even stable elements there.
I know it's a more out-there idea but the "continent of stability" would be a really interesting video too (where it's possible that at even higher atomic masses the protons and neutrons could "dissolve" into quark matter and become stable against fission again).
Love the Half-Life logo!
For now I'm just interested in element 115, the others can wait.
The answer is yes, there are, and the immediate one is right everywhere around you.  have been mentioning it for quite a quite, but none of you guys seems to have  got any idea of what it is. It is what constitutes any volume of perfect vacuum  with absolute pressure or without any element known in the periodic table AI cannot help human find such unknown elements because it is a form of passive intelligence unlike human and other natural forms of matter. AI can understand something and can detect that something only when humans give it an accurate definition of that thing. But when even human limited knowledge has no idea of  such an unknown form of matter, then no ai will be able to help humans find it. That  was why i said in 2016 that no AI would ever be better than human natural intelligence while a lot of ignorant human scientists and billionaires kept insisting that ai  would be a fatal threat to human kind
Half life 3 confirmed 👌🏻
The largeste "stable" element discovered has a half life of .69 ms. Coincidence? I think not! Pretty nice imho
I think the correct name would be The Human Detectable Periodic Table
Kryptonite, i.e. sodium lithium boron silicate hydroxide, does exist actually.  No green glow or other interesting features though.
Yes
Was Vibranium omitted?
Adamantium is not an element, it's an alloy
Mithril needs to be the name of one.
There's also the possibility of creating exotic elements using particles that aren't necessarily protons/neutrons/electrons
Ask Bob Lazar...he's a big proponent of element 115...
The spin-coupling magic numbers for nucleons are just like the Chicken McNugget numbers:  McNuggets are only sold in boxes of 6, 9, and 20 (excluding Happy Meals). Therefore, for a McDonalds order to contain a given number of McNuggets, that number must be the sum of any multiple of the numbers 6, 9, and 20. If the order contains a request for a number of McNuggets that cannot be so described, that number is unstable. Er, impossible.  Most interestingly of all, the highest number of McNuggets that is unorderable is... 43! The Technetium of fast food orders! This surely cannot be a coincidence.  The number 43 being unorderable both as an aliquot of McNuggets _and_ as an element, a mere coincidence? Pah! Next you'll be telling me that both inertial _and_ gravitational mass having precisely the same magnitude is also purely coincidental. Nope. Clearly this points to a fundamental property of the universe, as yet not understood.  Interestingly, however, any number of McNuggets above 43 is indeed stable, which suggests they may prove superior to chemical elements as a way to obtain materials with exotic and useful properties. We should divert significant funding to study of this area.
I wonder if black holes are full of crazy elements.
Scientists are not able to find additional elements because they degrade far to quick to detect. Solution, create the element out side of "Space Time".
Lighting is too dark.
Netherite absolutely exist 😡
I have long wondered about the island of stability, and how the elements they might produce could affect our technologies.
What might be the properties of atoms made up of known numbers of protons, but those protons were qqqq or qqqqq instead of traditional triquark matter?
Where's duranium, tritanium? Transparent aluminum????
I've always been intrigued by the idea of unknown elements possibly being out there
What about Copeium?
And the Three Body Problem series reference.  Nice.
Orichalcum is an alloy, usually thought to be that of copper and gold. Mithral is just Titanium.
Something I've always wondered: can we predict the half-lives/decay constant of isotopes of elements with quantum theory?
We need 115 to be stable!!! In lazar we believe.
I have a name for one: Nipponium ニッポンニアム
What if the reason for the fermi paradox is that we have evolved too see what we call "space time" because it has been evilotionary positive for us too see a deeper reality with that interface and therefore other animals might have evolved too see the deeper reality with another interface which is nothing like ours which might have lead to that most species from different chains of evulotion cant interact with eachother because our perceived realitys are so disconnected even though we share a depper reality.
This video made me realize that today we are like the early chemists who couldn't foresee the industrial revolution as a result of some of their advances.  Someday the work folks are doing today could lead to a new revolution with a yet discovered technology leading us to yet unimaginable places.
Chinesium is my favorite
Great episode!
If you have an unstable element/isotope is it going to conserve energy by breaking into half or into factors of nearby numbers?
Netherite! Love me sum Minecraft. Currently planning my next few hours of gaming.
43 is a prime number, I'm sure that doesn't have anything to do with it? it makes pairing difficult.
To anyone that thinks we have discovered every single possible element in the universe, you better reframe your thought perspective! We also might not have the correct definition of an element and other properties might be discovered elsewhere.
there's 100% totally an isotope of element 115 within the region of stability that can be used to generate gravitons just like we use semiconductor junctions to generate photons. Trust me I asked Bob Lazar
I can't help but notice that 43 is a prime number.  Clearly there are other prime elements that are perfectly stable but still
This feels custom made to launch off the back of BobbyBroccoli's STELLAR youtube documentary on this subject.  And I'm here for it.
So, you're going to put the graph/chart on the screen for a significant amount of time and never mention its name. Why not tell the audience about the Nuclear Drip Line? Saving it for another video?
Two weeks ago I see a video about a man who faked element 118, I recommend that video a lot
5:08 fun fact: Due to the fact that C14 only occurs in the atmosphere and is therefore photosynthesized by plants, all plant matter contains a defined amount of C14 atoms, which is constant up to the point of their death. However: fossil fuels do not contain C14. This fact can be used to determine if a product is based on renewables or a fossil fuel based feed stock and also whats the ratio between both feed stocks is.
Unobtainium is so yesterday, I can't wait until they discover inexplicium!
I think that Aristotle got it right with 4, if you challenge on that me then you aren't being very respectful.
Huh. I thought it was tech-niche-ee-um. Feel free to argue about whether I meant nich, nish, neech or neesh.
I mean. Seeing as every element discovered hadnt had a space on the table to begin I can say wholeheartedly that my answer to the title is “yes”
The element noone is expecting just has to be named after the spanish inquisition!
I mean I have always considered neutronium or just essentially an atomic nucleus comprised of exclusively Neutron so basically the material that nuclear pastas made of as element zero but everything beyond like what is it 118 or 119 I just don't really foresee it existing for more than like maybe a fragment of a moment cuz I feel like in order to actually produce those type of nuclei we either need to make our systems way more powerful or we need to be able to identify everything off of what is it type 1A supernovas whatever the type of supernova it is that is comprised of almost exclusively Neutron matter well at least verb a couple nanoseconds before it catastrophically re-expands due to no longer being within the gravity. But I don't know to me there doesn't seem like there would be anything much further than where we are but even if there is there doesn't seem to be a way to keep them from decomposing almost instantly so I don't really know what benefit we would have from trying to make an element higher
Weird how there is no mention whatsoever of the man who discovered the latest 7 elements:  Yuri Oganessian, all of the latest discovered elements were synthetized in Dubna, Russia.
This was a belter!!
I remember reading somewhere that the reason for the island of stability was the number of electrons in these atoms got so high that they started holding the protons in the nucleus, reducing the need for neutrons or something. I was wondering if that is still the leading theory for the island of stability or are there other ideas that seem more probably.
I have often wondered if it would be possible to get to the "island of stability" using a powerful accelerator.  I do not know if a powerful R process even like a Kilonova could make these element or not because the decay rates are so high when you get beyond element 92.  Even if heavier elements are made in these stellar R process events, would it survive long enough to be discovered?  Maybe most of these heavy elements that formed part of the Earth are now mostly element 82.
great videio y have been thinking o the vally of stability
You're omitting the whole set of elements with negative periodic numbers (from the TV show Fringe)
I'm wondering if it's possible to have other exotic kinds of nucleons (besides the obvious antiproton and antineutron) by some weird combinations of quarks, and, from that, whether it's possible to include them in stable nuclei.
HL3 confirmed
Buttholium.
I always wanted some unobtanium, but apparently it's really hard to get.
i have the same t-shirt! it’s my favourite, i didn’t expect it to see it here.
This video sounds like a ringing endorsement of the Age of Vibranium!
I appreciate the Half-Life & Minecraft references it's always good to have a sense of humor even when talking about science or mathematics.
Are there any theoretical, stable ways to build matter from these subatomic legos?
A question, how come the "strong nuclear force", that keeps protons together in the atom nucleus,  can be the same fundamental force that keeps quarks together inside a proton or a neutron (the "strong force"). Am I wrong in my understanding? If not, how? Shouldn't those be two different forces?
I'm still wondering if the "island of stability" really exist at all. Synthesizing new elements is fun and all, but then not so when they only exist for 0.75 femtoseconds...
Is there a way to visualize the nucleus wavefunction similar to how we can visualize the electron orbital wavefunctions?
"There are elements beyond that, but we haven't made one last long enough to unambiguously detect them."  If they haven't been detected, how can we be sure they exist?  If we are sure they exist, doesn't that mean they've been detected?
Vibranium?
Fun Fact:  The atomic weight of balonium is delicious.
One of them is surely the element OF SURPRISE!
Do we see any evidence for these stable heavy elements in astronomy observations, either radio imagery or optical spectra? Do we have any idea at what frequency they would radiate?
I was drawing up a sci-fi universe for stories and gaming and the inevitable time to throw in exotic matter for FTL travel came up and I didn't want to pull the "unobtanium" card and just make some unknown element, so I threw what I thought was an original twist. The material was called "hypervium" and it was basically regular quartz crystal, that was exposed to a phenomena that shifted half the electrons into hyperspace while still leaving them electromagnetically coupled to the nucleus. Making something that existed strange seemed a little less fantastical than new elements.
What about the fifth element?
Shouldn’t the numbering in the table at 6:11 also include extension of the bottom  of the actinides? Those were part of the table but separated to put everything in a good ratio.
I’m sure the human way of “hitting it until something happens” applies hare
Netherite already exists IRL.
does everything has a half-life, if so there will be a time when all matter decayed...into what
I have a pocket full of Krypton, oh, dam, where did that go?
Also possible: we’re not first and the Ancients are out there but haven’t caught up with us yet.
If the current methods of generating new elements won't get us to the island of stability, what other methods are being considered?
Vibranium?
Wow, amazing episode! It's so good to see Matt diving a little bit into Chemistry... I mean, the "Physics part" of Chemistry :D
Ayyyy new Space Time episode, pog   Probably, as we will I guess mix elements together or discover new materials in space (yay endless space 2)  Time to sit back and relax watching this video
In regards to the fermi paradox.  Is it possible that any sufficiently advanced civilization has moved on from using EM to transmit information?  Perhaps they've moved onto gravity waves to overcome obstacles to EM transmission.  That's why we don't see anything, by the time they have the necessary energy to transmit with enough power to be detected in the em spectrum, they've moved on to something else.
👍👍👍
Where is the stable element 115 crew?
He used half life logo 🥰
God damn it we live i'm the warhammer galaxy.
The densest metal is 'Democratium' with atom number 666 and is obviously very unstable.
You really had to work for the outro this time XD, nice episode.
Is it possible that as atomic numbers go up, stability for matter decreases and the stability of antimatter increases. That would explain why we have more matter than antimatter.
Graphite, graphene, diamonds, carbon nanotubes are different molecular structures of the same element with very different properties and applications. Maybe futuristic "elements" will come from new materials instead of actual new elements.
There is an element that is not on the Periodic table that everyone have missed.  () <--- You find it inbetween the parantesis to the left.
Er that was not a nuclear medicine scan.
Wonderful to get an episode on nuclear chemistry and stability! Another item on the long list of physics-y things I want to learn more about.
Element 0 is what a neutron star is made of and thus technically not theoretical, just beyond our current ability to create in large quantities.
Peepeepoopooman
I want my transparent aluminum!
You've done other episodes on speculative additional forces. I wonder what kind of 5th force could influence and produce new elements on the periodic table.
Which will come first?  Half Life 3, or the next stable element?
Why can't I find marshmallow on the periodic table?
I’m curious about how they exist even for a moment.   Because if it can exist, then it does exist. We just can’t manipulate the cosmic forces to enable it.
It’s cool to see you doing a video on this subject, especially since I just watched a video about Victor Ninov and his debacle
Yes...Tacobellium...deadly, toxic element. Trumponium...causes retardation.
Don’t forget Runite!!!!
One must eat the other, that runs free before him, put it right into his mouth.. A half life is better than no life at all..
This show is so good I bought two shirts. Love PBS space time
OK I have to ask: is this because of BobbyBroccoli’s recent video?
Lets hope so! because otherwise our universe would be kinda limited!  and i bet there are some stable "high number" cores! we just dont know it yet!
Unobtanium. /que song "One of these things just doesnt belong here!" :)
I think a reasonable question would be if there's an island of stability then why don't we see stable supermassive elements in nature.  To hypothesize on that question I would suggest a couple different theories: either they are so massive that they only precipitate out of accretion disks in the centers and so we'd only observe these elements on inner planets and as contaminants in stars. Or another hypothesis for why we wouldn't see them could be that there's not enough energy expenditure in nature to make these elements occur regularly, which means we'd probably need to go to a very energetic place like a galactic arm or something like that in order to observe these materials and even there they would be rare.
Am I just being dumb? I always thought technetium was pronounced like "tekneeshium". At least, that's how I always said it ever since I learned the periodic table.
I was wondering (I know it is kinda off topic) what would happen to a black hole in the event of change in vacuum state.
Ooh, I think he watched "The man who tried to fake an element" by BobbyBroccoli.
It's nice to not go super small or super big for an episode. Atoms, yass. Remember those? (o/
This video was sponsored by Black Mesa
Is the "Island of Stability" really an island? Or better seen as some shallows in the ocean? I guess, there are no stable elements there.
20:34 Sounds like we need a video on the Dark Forest solution. Need that hit of existential dread.
5:05 Awesome game! Still play it now and then lol
I love that those shirts(I def own one as well) are seriously out of date now with the latest round of updates and new content.
I think of Tiberium as the gray goo scenario, other fictional elements can be explained as (stable) isotopes, compounds, alloys or a different name for existing elements (Tylium from BSG). But again, almost no sci-fi is without some "magic".
6:00 Might want to check the numbering on this graphic... It's a small and ultimately meaningless error, so obviously it needs to be pointed out!
https://youtu.be/u7hxOQRUWJo
Finally a video I understood the whole way throughthrough! 😁
THE MASS EFFECT REFERENCE WARMS MY HEART SO MUCH
4:32 I'm trying to figure out how to turn animations like this into a written language
keep stacking the protons. at one point, who even cares about some bigger element that exist for 10^-3231325 seconds at 10^67539493 TeV. does it even matter?
You forgot "Vibranium"!
I really enjoyed this episode and the talk about elements! Please do more deep dives on these topics! It's refreshing!
Can endothermic fusion reactors be used to synthesise stable super heavy elements
mithril!
I hope there is no Trollium in there :)))
HL3 confirmed
The reason Technetium is unstable is because Valve doesn't acknowledge the existence of the number 3.
I read a paper a while back about the possiblity of a 'continent of stability'. Basically an Island of stability but could hold an entire periodic table's worth of new elements, made possible by strange quarks or something
Continue sir all wednesday without gap
In the island of stability the electrons are held so close to the nucleus that there is effectively no charge or magnetism leaking out.  Island of stability = dark matter.
cant you make elements
Legend of physics
Unhappy nucleus is my mental diagnosis
13:02 nice
A Minecraft reference on PBS Space Time? I knew it was just a _matter_ of _time._
Is there any explanation for why there are nuclear magic numbers?
no, there are undisclosed elements outside of the available periodic table of elements
Runite
i don't agree that there is going to be a first civilization to colonize space, I think humans misunderstand the cyclical nature of time vs entropic pull. time works like a 4 dimensional cube collapsing on itself, but through even more dimensions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe5WT22-AO8 AMAZING video with an incredible visual of stability on the table, and the "island of stability"
Element 0 isn't fictional, it appears on some (admittedly exotic) periodic tables and refers to free neutron matter.
Can't wait for element Tree Fiddy
If there were islands of stability then wouldn't they have been produced by neutron star collisions and therefore be at least somewhat present in the makeup of our solar system?
As far as I understand, unobtanium from Pandora is not an element, but compound - a room temperature superconductor.
Wouldn't nuclear isomers also be relevant to this discussion?
Can we consider a neutron star a "stable" element. Where gravity takes over from the strong force to keep the atom together?
Hmmmm thinks..  darkmatterium?
So chaos's answer to meaning of life is 43? :)
in a video about Ninov, there seems to be a speculative 'stable" element that would have 126 protons. Who knows, tho
what no Naquida?
Bob Lazar is monitoring this video's commentary for Element 115.  👽🛸
The only thing which would dissuade me from believing in semi stable plateaus on the periodic table at very high proton+neutron content is how much weaker the strong force would be over the size of those atoms nucleus.  What i believe to be the case for the very heavy atoms is that the repulsive electromagnetic force overcomes the strong force over the size of the nucleus of the atom, if that is the case there can be no semi stable plateau above what we have already found.
Yesss finally islands of stability videos
You forgot Tiberium!
4:55 electron and an antineutrino shurely?
I’d love a Bob Lazar video on the element he claimed fueled the alien aircraft he supposedly worked with. 🍿
If suns (supernova) can fuse lighter elements into heavier, reaching its max potential at iron - As the protons and electrons combine to form neutrons by means of electron capture, ending in an extreme explosion, then black holes ought to be able to create even heavier elements, as they seemingly do *not* blow themselves up/apart.
Pls pls pls stop those stupid background „music“ sounds. Its nonsense, distracting and annoying.
The element nobody will be expecting: the element of surprise!
Not an element but Star Trek Voyager’s “Omega Particle” (a molecule) is very cringe…
Hope you feel better,  you sound a little stuffy...  Chicken Noodle soup should have the right elements you need..
If the strong force is so strong why don't neutrons just clump together independently of protons?
think of states of matter and how molecules re-organize themselves, atomic isotopes work the same way, through geometry and electromagnetic pull or repel. it's like RNA's randomness.
shirt 68% distracting! :)
I have that shirt
And, of course, at some point superheavy elements there comes a point where we have to define "exists". Does element 119 "exist" if any which would have naturally been created would have already decayed, and no one has managed to create any?
Vibranium was made from the power stone destroyed a planet and a piece landed in wakanda,  adamantium is a Vibranium based alloy
Hey everyone!
You say technetium in a weird way, or at least weird in the way that I was taught.  They don't even say it like that on Periodic Videos.  If you want to learn about the elements, watch that channel.  Each video is on a different element, for the most part.  If you want to buy the elements, give me a shout.  I have most all of them except Technetium, Promethium and Polonium.  I can even get DU in small amounts.  You can find a way to get them by the link in my bio.  Yes, I'll shamelessly self promote right now, especially with the economy being the way that it is.  Being the only one supporting a family of 5 plus a friend, I need all the sales I can get!.  Lol
Thats why He4 is so special
Maybe not elements, but alloys will be improved upon, and make future science better. We need more material scientists :)
2 stars have to explode in order for every element we know of to be made, and those elements had to have found their way into the solar system, and all of the elements had to be around when Earth was forming, and they had to survive being 'eaten' by the sun. That's a lot to ask for.  There's a good chance that there are a LOT of elements we haven't seen yet.
5:04 I see what you did there.
Inb4 half-life 3!
Since their are heavier Hadrons then wouldn't they have different properties?
Thulium is just the best element. It has the nicest atomic number.
Good episode
mmm... bolognium...
Periodic table of anti elements
You forgot Unobtainium!
Matt..... Orichalcum is real. It's a metal alloy from Mycenae. It's been mythologized sure but it's real. Was probably gold and copper or gold and some other metal.
I’ve been saying since 2013 that it seems extremely obvious that all electrons and photons are in orbit with a dark matter particle.  Based on Fermilab and other recent findings, I now think electrons are made of an electron neutrino entangled in orbit with a dark matter muon neutrino, explaining their erratic orbits around nuclei and explaining superposition and uncertainty just like I’ve been saying since 2013.  I think photons are a pair of electrons entangled in orbit together in apparent an axial or helical polarizable wave-like movement depending on the direction of their rotation as they travel where the speed of their orbit determines the electromagnetic wavelength and the diameter is the apparent wave’s amplitude.  This explains the double slit experiment for example and the speed of the rotation explains electromagnetic wavelengths (and visible colors, etc).  What do you think of this Mudfossil University video?: ‘’Light Duality Solved and Seen’’, Sep 29, 2022 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROrFdPiancw
I guess it depends on how short do you want it's halflife to be
What up Matt, im Matt!
Huh I always thought mithril was an alloy
Balognium 😂
Oh, been waiting for discussion of the Island of Stability hypothesis... let's get watching and see if we are talking about it here....
you forgot obamium
Bob Lazar enters chat.....
Please do a news episode on NASA’s SLS!
Oooo we get to go over the stability islands
His T-shirt is literally the periodic table of minecraft💀
Last time I was this early, we still had an electroweak force.
I did like turtles
Common, where is vibranium... Or is it no longer science fiction 🤔
I'm first, first element
So finally we enter Seven Days territory. Time travel next?
What if there is a periodic table of dark matter?
